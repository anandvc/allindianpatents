DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a multilayered sliding member exhibiting<br>
excellent frictional wear properties in use under hydrodynamic lubrication, mixed<br>
lubrication, or boundary lubrication conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Patent document 1: U.S. Pat. No. 2,689,380<br>
Patent document 2: JP-B-31-2452<br>
Patent document 3: JP-B-41-1868<br>
Patent document 4: JP-B-61-28846<br>
Patent document 5: JP-B-62-33275<br>
[0003]<br>
Polytetrafluoroethylene resins (hereafter abbreviated as PTFE) are widely<br>
used in sliding members such as bearings since they excel in self-lubricating properties<br>
and have low coefficients of friction and high chemical and heat resistance. However,<br>
a sliding member made of PTFE alone is poor in wear resistance and a load carrying<br>
capacity, so that the defects of the PTFE are compensated for by adopting the<br>
following measures according to the application of use of the sliding member: (a)<br>
incorporating into the PTFE a solid lubricant such as graphite, molybdenum disulfide,<br>
or the like and/or a reinforcing material such as glass fibers or carbon fibers, and (b)<br>
filling the PTFE in the pores of a porous sintered metal layer formed on a steel backing<br><br>
plate and coating the surface of the porous sintered metal layer therewith.<br>
[0004]<br>
The sliding member having the above-described form (b) is so called a<br>
multilayered sliding member, and multilayered sliding members have been proposed in<br>
which PTFE or the PTFE containing a filler composed of lead or a lead oxide is filled<br>
in the pores of a porous sintered metal layer formed on a steel backing plate and is<br>
coated on the surface of the porous sintered metal layer (refer to patent documents 1, 2,<br>
and 3).<br>
[0005]<br>
In addition, a multilayered sliding member has also been proposed in which a<br>
melt moldable fluororesin composed of a tetrafluoroediylene-hexafluoropropylene<br>
copolymer or a tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoroalkylvinylether copolymer is contained in<br>
the PTFE as another filler (refer to Patent documents 4 and 5).<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]<br>
In the above-described various sliding members, fillers are selected which are<br>
suited to respective working conditions including numerous different working<br>
conditions, for example under hydrodynamic lubrication, mixed lubrication, or<br>
boundary lubrication conditions, and therefore, it is difficult to say that these sliding<br>
members satisfy all of these working conditions.<br>
[0007]<br>
In addition, in the PTFE composition for a sliding member, attempts have<br>
been made to use, for example, graphite, molybdenum disulfide or other metal sulfide,<br><br>
a metal oxide, or inorganic fibers such as glass fibers and carbon fibers, which are used<br>
as fillers for numerous engineering plastics. However, although these fillers, in fact,<br>
contribute to the improvement of the wear resistance of the resin layer, they often<br>
cause the problem of hampering the low frictional properties peculiar to PTFE. In<br>
particular, lead as the filler is widely used as it improves the wear resistance of the<br>
resin layer without hampering the low frictional properties inherent to PTFE.<br>
However, from the secondary standpoint of such as the environmental pollution and<br>
public hazards in recent years, the situation is such that there is no other alternative<br>
than to abandon the use of it.<br>
[0008]<br>
The present invention has been devised in view of the above-described aspects,<br>
and its object is to provide a multilayered sliding member excelling in frictional wear<br>
properties under numerous different working conditions, such as under hydrodynamic<br>
lubrication, mixed lubrication, or boundary lubrication conditions.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0009]<br>
As a result of the present inventors' earnest studies for attaining the<br>
above-described object, it has been found that a multilayered sliding member which<br>
comprises a resin composition filled in pores of, and coated on the surface of, a porous<br>
sintered metal layer formed on the surface of a steel backing plate, and which uses the<br>
resin composition having specific amounts of a phosphate, a carbon black, and a melt<br>
moldable fluororesin compounded in a PTFE or further containing at least one of<br>
graphite, molybdenum disulfide, and a low molecular weight PTFE in a predetermined<br>
amount, is capable of exhibiting excellent frictional wear properties under different<br><br>
working conditions, such as under hydrodynamic lubrication, mixed lubrication, or<br>
boundary lubrication conditions.<br>
[0010]<br>
The present invention has been completed on the basis of this finding. Its<br>
first gist resides in a multilayered sliding member comprising a resin composition<br>
filled in pores of, and coated on a surface of, a porous sintered metal layer formed on a<br>
surface of a metallic backing plate, the resin composition comprising 3 to 25% by<br>
weight of a phosphate, 0.3 to 3% by weight of a carbon black, 3 to 30% by weight of a<br>
melt moldable fluororesin, and the balance of PTFE.<br>
[0011]<br>
Further, a second gist resides in a multilayered sliding member wherein the<br>
resin composition contains 1 to 5% by weight of graphite or 2 to 10% by weight of<br>
molybdenum disulfide and/or 3 to 15% by weight of a low molecular weight PTFE.<br>
ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012]<br>
According to the present invention, a multilayered sliding member is provided<br>
which exhibits excellent frictional wear properties under different working conditions,<br>
such as under hydrodynamic lubrication, mixed lubrication, or boundary lubrication<br>
conditions.<br>
[0013]<br>
Hereafter, a detailed description will be given of the present invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
[0014]<br><br>
Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional view illustrating an embodiment of a multilayered<br>
sliding member in accordance with the invention.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0015]<br>
The multilayered sliding member in accordance with the invention comprises<br>
a resin composition filled in the pores of, and coated on the surface of, a porous<br>
sintered metal layer formed on the surface of a metallic backing plate. The resin<br>
composition is formed by compounding a phosphate, a carbon black, a melt moldable<br>
fluororesin, and a PTFE serving as a principal component, and is preferably formed by<br>
further containing graphite or molybdenum disulfide and/or a low molecular weight<br>
PTFE.<br>
[0016]<br>
The phosphate used in itself exhibits no lubricity, but by being compounded<br>
with a mixture of the PTFE, the carbon black, and the melt moldable fluororesin, the<br>
phosphate exhibits the effects of promoting the formation on the surface of a mating<br>
member of a mixed film consisting of the PTFE, the carbon black, and the melt<br>
moldable fluororesin in sliding on the mating member, enhancing its retentivity on the<br>
surface of the mating member, and enhancing the durability.<br>
[0017]<br>
The compounding amount of the phosphate is normally 3 to 25% by weight,<br>
preferably 10 to 20% by weight. If the compounding amount is less than 3% by<br>
weight, the effects of formability on the surface of the mating member of the mixed<br>
film consisting of the PTFE, the carbon black, and the melt moldable fluororesin, its<br>
retentivity on the surface of the mating member, and the durability of the mixed film<br><br>
are not exhibited. Meanwhile, if the compounding amount is more than 25% by<br>
weight, a problem arises in the formability of the mixed film on the surface of the<br>
mating member, so that the formation of a satisfactory mixed film on the surface of the<br>
mating member becomes difficult, with the result that the frictional wear properties can<br>
deteriorate.<br>
[0018]<br>
As the phosphate, it is possible to cite metal salts of such as orthophosphoric<br>
acid, pyrophosphoric acid, and metaphosphoric acid, and a mixture thereof. Among<br>
them, the metal salts of pyrophosphoric acid and metaphosphoric acid are preferable.<br>
As the metal, an alkali metal and an alkaline earth metal are preferable, and calcium<br>
(Ca) and magnesium (Mg) are more preferable. Specifically, it is possible to cite by<br>
way of example calcium pyrophosphate (Ca2P2O7), magnesium pyrophosphate<br>
(Mg2P2O7), calcium metaphosphate ([Ca(PO3)2]n), magnesium metaphosphate<br>
([Mg(PO3)2]n), aluminum metaphosphate ([Al(P03)3]n), and the like. Among them,<br>
calcium metaphosphate ([Ca(PO3)2]n) and magnesium metaphosphate ([Mg(PO3)2]n)<br>
are preferable since they exhibit the above-described effects most satisfactorily.<br>
[0019]<br>
The carbon black exhibits the effects of reinforcing the PTFE constituting the<br>
principal component and of improving the wear resistance. In addition, since it<br>
possesses the property of retaining oil, even under the boundary or mixed lubrication<br>
conditions where an oil or grease shortage is likely to occur in oil or grease lubrication,<br>
it is possible to retain the oil content and prevent the occurrence of a defect such as<br>
seizure due to the oil shortage.<br>
[0020]<br>
The compounding amount of the carbon black is normally 0.3 to 3% by<br><br>
weight, preferably 0.5 to 2% by weight. If the compounding amount is less than 0.3%<br>
by weight, the above-described effects are not exhibited sufficiently. Meanwhile, if<br>
the compounding amount is more than 3% by weight, its proportion in the resin<br>
composition becomes large and can lower the wear resistance to the contrary.<br>
[0021]<br>
As the carbon black, it is possible to cite acetylene black, oil furnace black,<br>
thermal black, channel black, gas furnace black, and the like. In particular, preferable<br>
is one whose primary particle size is less than approximately 200 nm, preferably 10 nm<br>
to 100 nm, whose DBP absorption is not less than 100 ml/100 g, preferably not less<br>
than 300 ml/100 g, which has a hollow structure and is provided with a kind of a<br>
porous structure, and which has an appropriate chain structure. Specifically, it is<br>
possible to cite by way of illustration "Ketjenblack EC (tradename)" and "Ketjenblack<br>
EC-600JD (tradename)" manufactured by KETJENBLACK INTERNATIONAL<br>
COMPANY as being preferable ones.<br>
[0022]<br>
The melt moldable fluororesin exhibits the effects of reinforcing the PTFE by<br>
being mutually dissolved with the PTFE constituting the principal component and of<br>
improving the wear resistance which is the drawback of the PTFE.<br>
[0023]<br>
The compounding amount of the melt moldable fluororesin is normally 3 to<br>
30% by weight, preferably 5 to 15% by weight. If the compounding amount is less<br>
than 3% by weight, the above-described effects are not exhibited sufficiently.<br>
Meanwhile, if the compounding amount is more than 30% by weight, the amount of<br>
the melt moldable fluororesin becomes large and impairs the low frictional properties<br>
peculiar to the PTFE although the wear resistance is further improved.<br><br>
[0024]<br>
As the melt moldable fluororesin, it is possible to cite a<br>
tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene copolymer (hereafter abbreviated as the FEP)<br>
or a tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoroalkylvinylether copolymer (hereafter abbreviated as<br>
the PFA). Specifically, it is possible to cite by way of example "NEOFLON FEP<br>
(tradename)" manufactured by Daikin Industries, Ltd. as the FEP and "Teflon<br>
(registered trademark) MP powder" manufactured by DU PONT-MITSUI<br>
FLUOROCHEMICALS COMPANY, LTD. as the PFA.<br>
[0025]<br>
As the PTFE constituting the principal component of the resin composition, a<br>
PTFE for fine powder is used. Specifically, it is possible to cite "Teflon (registered<br>
trademark) 6CJ' or the like manufactured by DU PONT-MITSUI<br>
FLUOROCHEMICALS COMPANY, LTD., "POLYFLON F201 (tradename)" or the<br>
like manufactured by Daikin Industries, Ltd., "Fluon CD076 (tradename)," "Fluon<br>
CD090 (tradename)," or the like manufactured by Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.<br>
[0026]<br>
The compounding amount of the PTFE in the resin composition is the<br>
remaining amount obtained by subtracting the compounding amounts of the fillers<br>
from the amount of the resin composition, and is preferably not less than 50% by<br>
weight, more preferably 50 to 75% by weight.<br>
[0027]<br>
In the resin composition in the multilayered sliding member of the invention,<br>
1 to 5% by weight of graphite or 2 to 10% by weight of molybdenum disulfide may be<br>
compounded for the purposes of further improving the wear resistance and improving<br>
the affinity with lubricating oil.<br><br>
[0028]<br>
In addition, the resin composition in the multilayered sliding member of the<br>
invention may contain 3 to 15% by weight of a low molecular weight PTFE for the<br>
purpose of improving the affinity in an early period of sliding with the mating member.<br>
The low molecular weight PTFE is a PTFE whose molecular weight is reduced by<br>
decomposing a high molecular weight PTFE (molding powder or fine powder) by such<br>
as exposure to radiation or by controlling the molecular weight during the<br>
polymerization of the PTFE. Specifically, it is possible to cite "TLP-IOF<br>
(tradename)" or the like manufactured by DU PONT-MITSUIFLUOROCHEMICALS<br>
COMPANY, LTD., "Lubron L-5 (tradename)" or the like manufactured by Daikin<br>
Industries, Ltd., "Fluon L169J (tradename)" or the like manufactured by Asahi Glass<br>
Co., Ltd., and "KTL-8N (tradename)" or the like manufactured by KITAMURA<br>
LIMITED.<br>
[0029]<br>
Next, a description will be given of a method of manufacturing the metallic<br>
backing plate, the porous sintered metal layer formed integrally on the surface of this<br>
backing plate, and the multilayered sliding member having a resin composition filled in<br>
the pores of, and coated on the surface of, the porous sintered metal layer. The<br>
metallic backing plate is used by being appropriately selected from a cold-rolled steel<br>
plate (SPCC), a pure copper plate of such as oxygen free copper (type 1 or type 2 of<br>
oxygen free copper billets and cakes defined in JIS-H-2123) or tough pitch copper<br>
(tough pitch copper billets and cakes defined in JIS-H-2123), and a copper alloy plate<br>
of such as phosphor bronze, depending on the application. As for the metallic<br>
backing plate, it is preferable to use a continuous strip which is provided as a hoop<br>
wound in coil form, but the metallic backing plate is not necessarily limited to the<br><br>
continuous strip, and it is also possible to use a strip cut to an appropriate length. In<br>
the case where such a strip or a steel plate, in particular, is used, the plate may be<br>
provided with such as copper plating or tin plating, as required, to improve corrosion<br>
resistance.<br>
[0030]<br>
The metal powder for forming the porous sintered metal layer is formed of a<br>
copper alloy excelling in frictional wear properties, such as bronze or phosphor bronze,<br>
but may be formed of, for instance, an aluminum alloy or iron other than the copper<br>
alloy, depending on the purpose and application. As the form of particles of these<br>
metal powders, it is possible to use a metal powder having massive shape, spherical<br>
shape, or other irregular shapes. Their particle size is preferably of such a degree that<br>
the particles pass through an 80-mesh sieve but do not pass through a 350-mesh sieve.<br>
It is required that the metal powder particles of the porous sintered metal layer are<br>
strongly bonded to each other and the sintered metal layer is strongly bonded to the<br>
aforementioned steel plate strip, and that the sintered metal layer has a predetermined<br>
thickness and the required porosity. The thickness of the porous sintered metal layer<br>
is generally 0.15 to 0.40 mm, preferably 0.2 to 0.3 mm. The porosity of the porous<br>
sintered metal layer is generally not less than 10% by volume, preferably 15 to 40% by<br>
volume.<br>
[0031]<br>
A resin composition with wettability imparted thereto can be obtained by a<br>
method in which the PTFE and the aforementioned fillers are mixed, and a<br>
petroleum-based solvent is then added to the resultant mixture and is mixed under<br>
stirring. The mixing of the PTFE and the fillers is effected at a temperature not more<br>
than the room-temperature transition point (19°C) of the PTFE, preferably from 10 to<br><br>
18°C. Further, the resultant mixture and the petroleum-based solvent are also mixed<br>
under stirring at the same temperature as described above. By the adoption of such a<br>
temperature condition, fibrillation of the PTFE can be inhibited, thereby making it<br>
possible to obtain a homogeneous mixture.<br>
[0032]<br>
As the petroleum-based solvent, naphtha, toluene, xylene, or a mixed solvent<br>
of an aliphatic solvent or a naphthenic solvent is used. The ratio of the<br>
petroleum-based solvent used is from 15 to 30 parts by weight based on 100 parts by<br>
weight of a mixture of the PTFE powder and the fillers. If the ratio of the<br>
petroleum-based solvent used is less than 15 parts by weight, the ductility of the resin<br>
composition with the wettability imparted thereto is poor in the below-described filling<br>
and coating step of me porous sintered metal layer, so that uneven filling and coating<br>
of the sintered layer is likely to occur. On the other hand, if the ratio of the<br>
petroleum-based solvent used exceeds 30 parts by weight, not only does the filling and<br>
coating operation become difficult, but the uniformity of the coating thickness of the<br>
resin composition can be impaired, and the adhesion strength between the resin<br>
composition and the sintered layer becomes deteriorated.<br>
[0033]<br>
The sliding member in accordance with the present invention is produced<br>
through the following steps (a) to (d).<br>
[0034]<br>
(a) A resin composition with wettability imparted thereto is supplied by being<br>
spread over a porous sintered metal layer formed on a metallic backing plate selected<br>
from a steel plate and a copper or copper alloy plate, and is subjected to rolling by a<br>
roller, thereby filling the resin composition into pores of the porous sintered metal<br><br>
layer and forming on the surface of the porous sintered metal layer a coating layer<br>
composed of the resin composition having a uniform thickness. In this step, the<br>
thickness of the coating layer is set to from 2 to 2.2 times the coating layer thickness<br>
required for the resin composition in a final product. The filling of the resin<br>
composition into pores of the porous sintered metal layer substantially proceeds in this<br>
step.<br>
[0035]<br>
(b)	The backing plate thus treated in the step (a) is held in a drying furnace<br>
heated to a temperature of from 200 to 250°C for several minutes to remove the<br>
petroleum-based solvent. Then, the dried resin composition is subjected to pressure<br>
roller treatment using a roller under a pressure of 300 to 600 kgf/cm2 to obtain the<br>
predetermined thickness of the coating layer.<br>
[0036]<br>
(c)	The backing plate thus treated in the step (b) is introduced into a heating<br>
furnace, and heated at a temperature of from 360 to 380°C for a period between several<br>
minutes and 10 and several minutes to sinter the resin composition. Then, the backing<br>
plate is removed out of the heating furnace and is subjected to roller treatment again to<br>
adjust the variation of the size.<br>
[0037]<br>
(d)	The backing plate subjected to the size adjustment in the step (c) is cooled<br>
(air-cooled or naturally cooled), and then subjected to correction roller treatment, as<br>
required, so as to correct the waviness or the like of the backing plate, thereby<br>
obtaining a desired sliding member.<br>
[0038]<br>
In the sliding member obtained through the steps (a) to (d), the thickness of<br><br>
the porous sintered metal layer is set to 0.10 to 0.40 mm, and the thickness of the<br>
coating layer formed of the resin composition is set to 0.005 to 0.15 mm. The sliding<br>
member thus obtained is cut into an appropriate size, and is used as a flat sliding plate,<br>
or used as a cylindrical winding bush by being bent round.<br>

mixed solvent of an aliphatic solvent and a naphthenic solvent ("Exxsol (tradename)"<br>
manufactured by Exxon Chemical Company) was used as the petroleum-based solvent.<br>
[0045]<br>
First, the PTFE and the fillers shown in Tables 3 to 7 were charged into a<br>
Henschel mixer, and mixed under stirring. 20 parts by weight of the petroleum-based<br>
solvent was compounded with 100 parts by weight of the resultant mixture, and mixed<br><br>
at a temperature (15°C) lower than the room-temperature transition point of the PTFE,<br>
to obtain a resin composition.<br>
[0046]<br>
The resin composition thus obtained was spread over a porous sintered metal<br>
(bronze) layer formed on the surface of a backing plate formed of a steel plate, and<br>
rolled by a roller for filling the resin composition into pores of the porous sintered<br>
metal layer and coating the surface of the porous sintered metal layer therewith,<br>
thereby obtaining a multilayered plate having a resin composition layer on the porous<br>
sintered metal layer. This multilayered plate was held in a hot-air drying furnace<br>
heated to 200°C for 5 minutes to remove the solvent. Then, the dried multilayered<br>
plate was rolled under a pressure by a roller, such that the thickness of the resin<br>
composition layer coated on the porous sintered metal layer was set to 10 µm (0.01<br>
mm).<br>
[0047]<br>
The multilayered plate thus pressure-treated was then introduced into a<br>
heating furnace, and heated at a temperature of 370°C for 10 minutes to sinter the resin<br>
composition. Subsequently, the plate was subjected to pressure treatment again by the<br>
roller to make the dimensional adjustment and correction of the waviness and the like,<br>
thereby fabricating a multilayered sliding member. The multilayered sliding member,<br>
upon completion of the correction, was cut to obtain a multilayered sliding member<br>
test piece having each side length of 30 mm. Fig. 1 shows a cross-sectional view of<br>
the multilayered sliding member thus obtained. In the drawing, reference numeral 1<br>
denotes a metallic backing plate formed of a steel plate; 2 denotes a porous sintered<br>
metal layer; and 3 denotes a coating layer (sliding layer) composed of the resin<br>
composition filling pores of the porous sintered metal layer 2 and coating the surface<br><br>
of the porous sintered metal layer 2.<br>
[0048]<br>
The results of the thrust tests (1) and (2) for each of the multilayered sliding<br>
members are shown in Tables 3 to 7. The compounding amounts in the tables are<br>
shown by "% by weight". It should be noted that "Ketjenblack EC-600JD<br>
(tradename)" manufactured by KETJENBLACK INTERNATIONAL COMPANY was<br>
used as the carbon black, and "NEOFLON FEP (tradename)" manufactured by Daikin<br>
Industries, Ltd. and "Teflon (registered trademark) MP powder" manufactured by DU<br>
PONT-MITSUI FLUOROCHEMICALS COMPANY, LTD. were used as the melt<br>
moldable fluororesins.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0054]<br>
From the above-described test results, the multilayered sliding members in the<br>
examples of the invention exhibited low coefficients of friction and stable performance<br>
and showed very low values as their amounts of wear throughout the test time even<br>
under boundary or mixed lubrication conditions. Meanwhile, the multilayered sliding<br>
members in the comparative examples showed high coefficients of friction and large<br>
amounts of wear, and were inferior in the frictional wear properties.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br>
MULTILAYER SLIDING MEMBER<br>
A multilayer sliding member has a resin composition filled in pores of, and<br>
coated on the surface of, a porous sintered metal layer 2 formed on the surface of a<br>
metallic backing plate 1. The resin composition is formed by compounding a<br>
phosphate, a carbon black, a melt moldable fluororesin, and a PTFE serving as a<br>
principal component, and is preferably formed by further containing graphite and/or a<br>
low molecular weight PTFE.<br></td>
