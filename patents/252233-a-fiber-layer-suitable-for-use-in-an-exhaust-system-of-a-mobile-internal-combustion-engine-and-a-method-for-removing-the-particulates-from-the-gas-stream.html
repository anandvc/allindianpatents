				<td>Method for removing particulates from exhaust gases,<br>
and corresponding fiber layer and particulate filter<br>
The present invention relates to a fiber layer which is<br>
suitable for use in an exhaust system of a mobile<br>
internal combustion engine. The invention also proposes<br>
a particulate filter for the same use. Moreover, the<br>
invention relates to a method for removing particulates<br>
from the exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine<br>
having a gas-permeable filter layer.<br>
To reduce the level of particulate emissions from<br>
exhaust gases from combustion processes, it is known to<br>
use particulate traps which are constructed from a<br>
ceramic substrate. These traps have passages, so that<br>
the exhaust gas which is to be purified can flow into<br>
the particulate trap. Adjacent passages are closed off<br>
on alternate sides, so that the exhaust gas enters the<br>
passage on the inlet side, is forced to pass through a<br>
ceramic wall and escapes again along an adjacent<br>
passage on the outlet side. Filters of this type<br>
achieve an efficiency of approx. 95% across the entire<br>
range of particulate sizes which occur.<br>
In addition to undesirable chemical interactions<br>
between the particulates and additives and special<br>
coatings, the reliable regeneration of a filter of this<br>
type in the exhaust system of an automobile still<br>
causes problems. It is necessary to regenerate the<br>
particulate trap, since the increasing accumulation of<br>
particulates in the passage walls through which the<br>
exhaust gas is to flow causes the pressure loss across<br>
the filter or the back-pressure to rise continuously,<br>
which has adverse effects on the engine power. The<br>
regeneration generally comprises brief heating of the<br>
particulate trap or the particulates which have<br>
collected therein, so that the particulates are<br>
converted into gaseous constituents. This can be<br>
achieved, for example, by briefly raising the<br>
temperature of the exhaust gas to levels which are<br><br>
— 2 —<br>
sufficient to convert the particulates which have<br>
accumulated in the particulate trap, with the aid of an<br>
upstream exothermic reaction (e.g. oxidation of<br>
additional fuel injected into the exhaust pipe:<br>
"afterburning"). However, this high thermal loading of<br>
the particulate trap has adverse effects on the service<br>
life. Moreover, under certain circumstances it is<br>
necessary to monitor the extent of blockage of the<br>
particulate trap in order that a thermal regeneration<br>
of this nature should be initiated only at the required<br>
times.<br>
To avoid this discontinuous regeneration, which<br>
promotes thermal wear, a system for the continuous<br>
regeneration of filters or particulate traps has been<br>
developed (CRT: continuous regeneration trap). In a<br>
system of this type, the particulates are burnt at<br>
temperatures of well over 200°C by means of oxidation<br>
with NO2. The NO2 required for this purpose is often<br>
generated by an oxidation catalytic converter arranged<br>
upstream of the particulate trap. In this case,<br>
however, the problem arises specifically with a view to<br>
use in motor vehicles using diesel fuel that there is<br>
only an insufficient level of nitrogen monoxide (NO)<br>
which can be converted into the desired nitrogen<br>
dioxide (NO2) in the exhaust gas. In this respect, it<br>
may under certain circumstances be necessary to add<br>
substances or additives which yield NO or NO2 (e.g.<br>
ammonia) so as to ultimately allow continuous<br>
regeneration of the particulate trap in the exhaust<br>
system.<br>
These fundamental considerations have given rise to a<br>
new filter concept, which has mainly become known under<br>
the name "open filter system" or "PM cat". These open<br>
filter systems are distinguished by the fact that there<br>
is no need for the filter passages to be designed such<br>
that they are closed off on alternate sides. In this<br>
context, it is provided that the passage walls are at<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
least in part composed of porous material and that the<br>
flow passages of the open filter have diverting and/or<br>
guiding structures. These internal fittings or<br>
microstructures in the passages cause the flow or the<br>
particulates contained therein to be diverted toward<br>
the regions made from porous material. In this context,<br>
it has surprisingly emerged that the particulates<br>
adhere to and/or in the porous passage wall as a result<br>
of interception and/or impacting. For this effect to<br>
occur, the pressure differences in the flow profile of<br>
the flow in the exhaust gas are of importance. The<br>
divergence or microstructures additionally make it<br>
possible to generate local subatmospheric or<br>
superatmospheric conditions, which lead to a filtration<br>
effect through the porous passage wall since the<br>
abovementioned pressure differences have to be<br>
compensated for.<br>
In this case, the particulate trap, unlike the known<br>
closed screen or filter systems, is "open", since there<br>
are no flow blind alleys and/or (at least almost) every<br>
passage has a cross section which, although it may<br>
vary, can ultimately still be flowed through freely.<br>
This property can also be used to characterize<br>
particulate filters of this type, which means that, for<br>
example, the parameter "freedom of flow" is suitable<br>
for descriptive purposes. A more extensive description<br>
of "open" filter elements of this type is to be found,<br>
for example, in documents DE 201 17 873, WO 02/00326,<br>
WO 01/92692, WO 01/80978, the content of disclosure of<br>
which is hereby incorporated in full in the subject<br>
matter of the present description and can also be used<br>
below for more detailed characterization of filter<br>
elements of this type in the context of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The provision of suitable materials for the porous<br>
passage sections has to be matched to a large number of<br>
factors,   in  particular  material,   resistance   to<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
corrosion, thermal stability, manufacturing<br>
suitability, filter efficiency. By way of example,<br>
metallic fiber layers which have been configured with a<br>
protective sheath so as to comply with some of the<br>
factors required in the automotive industry have also<br>
been proposed. These are described, for example, in<br>
DE 101 53 283 or WO 03/038248.<br>
The known "open filter systems" or the filter layers<br>
used therein have already proven very successful.<br>
Important factors in this context are the low pressure<br>
loss and the possibility of arranging filter systems of<br>
this type relatively close to the internal combustion<br>
engine, where the particulate traps are usually exposed<br>
to an elevated temperature. Nevertheless, the intention<br>
now is to demonstrate a way of making the known<br>
particulate filters even more efficient in terms of<br>
their purifying action. Moreover, it is intended to<br>
provide a fiber layer or filter layer which can be<br>
produced at low cost even as part of series production<br>
and is suitable for use in metallic particulate traps,<br>
so as to be able to withstand the high thermal and<br>
dynamic loads in the exhaust system of an automobile<br>
for a prolonged period of time.<br>
These objects are achieved by a fiber layer and a<br>
particulate filter in accordance with the corresponding<br>
independent apparatus claims and a method for removing<br>
particulates in accordance with the independent method<br>
claim. Further advantageous configurations of the<br>
apparatuses and methods are described in the respective<br>
dependent claims. In this context, it should be noted<br>
that the features given individually in the patent<br>
claims can be combined with one another in any<br>
technologically expedient way and represent further<br>
advantageous configurations of the invention.<br>
The fiber layer according to the invention is suitable<br>
for use in an exhaust system of a mobile internal<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
combustion engine and comprises an assembly of fibers.<br>
It has a layer thickness which extends from one surface<br>
of the fiber layer toward an opposite surface. The<br>
fiber layer can in this context be characterized on the<br>
basis of at least one of the following parameters:<br>
porosity, fiber diameter, fiber type content. This<br>
fiber layer is now characterized in that at least one<br>
of the parameters listed has magnitudes which vary in<br>
the direction of the layer thickness, with an extreme<br>
of these magnitudes being at a distance from the<br>
surfaces of the fiber layer.<br>
In the present context, the term "fibers" is to be<br>
understood as meaning elongate elements, the fiber<br>
length of which is a multiple of the fiber diameter.<br>
The fibers have been combined with one another to form<br>
a sheet-like layer. The assembly may be of ordered or<br>
random nature. Examples of ordered assemblies include<br>
knitted fabrics, woven fabrics, meshes. An example of a<br>
random assembly is a tangled layer. The fibers may be<br>
directly cohesively bonded, but it is also possible for<br>
the fibers to be joined to one another by additional<br>
means. The fibers or fiber layers are made from a<br>
corrosion-resistant material which is able to withstand<br>
high temperatures, so that they are able to withstand<br>
the ambient conditions in an exhaust system for a<br>
prolonged period of time. Important variables for<br>
describing the fibers are fiber length, fiber diameter<br>
and fiber type content. It is preferable for the fiber<br>
length of fibers of this type to be in a range from<br>
0.05 to 0.4 mm [millimeter]. The fiber diameter is<br>
usually in a range of less than 0.09 mm, preferably in<br>
a range from 0.015 to 0.05 mm. The arrangement of the<br>
fibers with respect to one another can be described,<br>
inter alia, by the porosity. In this context, the term<br>
porosity means the proportion of regions through which<br>
medium can flow freely within a cross section of the<br>
fiber layer. The porosity is usually in a range from<br>
50% to 90%.  The assembly of fibers generally forms<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
cavities, openings or pores, the maximum extent of<br>
which is in the range from 0.001 to 0.1 mm and can be<br>
selected on the basis of the particulates that are to<br>
be removed. A further parameter is what is known as the<br>
fiber type content, a term used to describe the<br>
proportion in which the fibers are present when<br>
different fiber types or configurations are used to<br>
form the fiber layer. For example, if the fiber layer<br>
includes a number of fibers (Fsmall) with a small fiber<br>
diameter, on the one hand, and a number of fibers<br>
(Flarge) with a larger fiber diameter, on the other hand,<br>
the fiber type content results from the ratio of Fsmall<br>
or Flarge to (Fsmall+ Flarge) . The fiber type content of<br>
one type of fibers preferably varies in the range of at<br>
least 10%, in particular 20%, over the layer thickness.<br>
In the case of the fiber layer proposed here, at least<br>
one of the characteristic parameters varies in the<br>
direction of the layer thickness, with an extreme in<br>
the interior of the fiber layer. In this context, the<br>
term "fiber layer" is actually only to be understood as<br>
meaning the combination of fibers; it does not include<br>
additional components of other forms of material (such<br>
as for example sheet-metal foils) for producing a<br>
filter layer. This does not mean that components of<br>
this type may not be present, but rather they are not<br>
taken into consideration in connection with the varying<br>
parameters. This has no effect on the configuration of<br>
the fiber layer with different types of fiber or fiber<br>
layers arranged adjacent to one another, which are<br>
intended to set the desired fiber layer parameter. This<br>
means in particular that the fiber layer is of<br>
different construction in edge layers than in central<br>
layers.<br>
The term "extreme" is to be understood as meaning a<br>
maximum value or a minimum value for the parameter<br>
under consideration. In this context, a variation in<br>
the magnitudes which is substantially symmetrical with<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
respect to the middle or center of the layer thickness<br>
is preferred. This has the advantage that the fiber<br>
layer has the same effect from both sides in terms of<br>
its filtering action and is therefore easier to<br>
produce, transport and process further in terms of<br>
manufacturing technology aspects. It is very<br>
particularly preferable for the respective extremes to<br>
be arranged substantially in a common cross-sectional<br>
plane of the fiber layer, i.e., for example, all to be<br>
at approximately the same distance from the surface of<br>
the fiber layer.<br>
The configuration of the fiber layer proposed here<br>
produces different flow resistances to a gas stream<br>
flowing through and/or particulates entrained therein<br>
at different depths of the fiber layer. The result of<br>
this is that the gas stream advances into different<br>
layers or depths of the fiber layer in accordance with<br>
the external flow forces and/or pressure differences.<br>
This fact can be exploited in order to achieve more<br>
effective purification of the gas streams, with an<br>
undesirable rise in the pressure loss being avoided at<br>
the same time.<br>
According to one advantageous refinement of the fiber<br>
layer, the latter comprises metallic fibers. In this<br>
context, it is preferable to use iron materials which<br>
contain a proportion of at least one of the following<br>
alloying elements: aluminum, chromium, nickel. The<br>
material itself can preferably be sintered, which means<br>
both that the fiber itself is made from sinterable<br>
material or produced by the sintering process and that<br>
the fibers have been joined to one another using the<br>
sintering process.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed that the fiber layer have a<br>
plurality of subregions, in which at least one of the<br>
parameters is constant, in the direction of the layer<br>
thickness. In other words, this means that the fiber<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
layer is of stratified structure, with the parameter<br>
under consideration being substantially constant within<br>
one such stratum. A stratified fiber layer of this type<br>
may in principle also include a different fiber<br>
material, with the strata ultimately being joined to<br>
one another. However, it is preferable to form a fiber<br>
layer from one material, in which case the fibers<br>
themselves and/or their arrangement with respect to one<br>
another is configured in such a way that individual<br>
strata are formed. This has the advantage of ensuring<br>
more stable and durable cohesion of the layers, which<br>
is not necessarily the case with strata comprising<br>
different materials and/or strata which are joined to<br>
one another by additional joining materials.<br>
With a stratified structure of the fiber layer of this<br>
nature, it is particularly advantageous for there to be<br>
an odd number of subregions, with a centrally arranged<br>
subregion having the extreme magnitude of the<br>
parameter. It is preferable for a fiber layer of this<br>
type to have three (or if appropriate five) subregions,<br>
with the parameters in the edge layers being selected<br>
to be substantially identical and with a differing<br>
magnitude of the parameter being present in the<br>
centrally arranged subregion. The parameter may in this<br>
case have a magnitude which changes suddenly or<br>
continuously in the boundary region between the<br>
individual subregions.<br>
In principle, the layer thickness of a fiber layer or<br>
filter layer of this type is in a range of less than<br>
3.0 mm, preferably in a range from 0.1 mm to 2.0 mm.<br>
Fiber layers with a layer thickness in the range from<br>
0.3 mm to 0.5 mm have given good results for mobile<br>
use, with subregions with a thickness of approx. 0.1 mm<br>
being formed. The layer thickness may but does not have<br>
to be divided into subregions which form equal<br>
proportions of the overall thickness.<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
If the fiber layer is configured with a varying<br>
porosity, it is proposed in particular that the extreme<br>
represent a minimum value. In other words, this means<br>
that the porosity of the fiber layer is lowest in an<br>
inner, in particular, central region of the fiber<br>
layer, i.e. the highest flow resistance for a gas<br>
stream flowing through it is present there. This means<br>
that for complete flow through the fiber layer there<br>
must be a considerable pressure difference, whereas the<br>
flow of gases through the edge region can take place<br>
even at relatively low pressure differences. Moreover,<br>
it should be noted that experience has shown that these<br>
subregions of reduced porosity are the first to become<br>
blocked with solids or particles, which means that they<br>
may be partially blocked until the particulates have<br>
been converted into gaseous constituents and the fiber<br>
region has been regenerated. Nevertheless, the fiber<br>
layer usually still has some filtering action at these<br>
locations, since the exhaust gas or gas stream can<br>
still flow through the edge layers of the fiber layers<br>
and can therefore continue to be purified.<br>
If the fiber diameter is configured to be variable over<br>
the layer thickness of the fiber layer, it is<br>
preferably proposed that the extreme represent a<br>
minimum value. In other words, this means that fibers<br>
in an interior subregion of the fiber layer have a<br>
smaller fiber diameter than fibers in the edge layers.<br>
Tests have shown that the efficiency of the fibers in<br>
terms of their purifying action and/or their potential<br>
to accumulate particulates increases as the fiber<br>
diameter decreases. This therefore means that in this<br>
case there is a fiber layer which is particularly<br>
efficient in central regions, whereas edge regions are<br>
less efficient. By way of example, the fibers in the<br>
central region may, for example, be used with a fiber<br>
diameter of less than 50 n [micrometers] or even less<br>
than 25 urn, whereas, for example, fibers with a fiber<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
diameter in the range from 50 m to 100 m may be<br>
present in the edge region.<br>
Furthermore, by way of example it is also possible for<br>
the fiber type content to be configured so as to vary<br>
across the layer thickness of the fiber layer, in which<br>
case fibers (Fsmall) with a smaller fiber diameter and<br>
fibers (Flarge) with a larger fiber diameter are mixed or<br>
combined with one another. It is particularly<br>
preferable for the FSmall to have a fiber diameter in the<br>
range from 20-25 m [micrometers] , whereas the Flarge are<br>
designed with a fiber diameter in the range from 35-<br>
4 5 m. The extreme of the fiber type content parameter<br>
is in this case preferably in the range from<br>
Fsmall = approx. 0.3-0.4 to Flarge = approx. 0.7-0.6. A<br>
fiber type content of this nature has given<br>
particularly advantageous results with regard to<br>
particulate separation if it is kept substantially<br>
constant across the layer thickness. However, further<br>
advantages can also be achieved if the fiber type<br>
content close to at least one edge region is in the<br>
range from Fsmall = 0.0-0.2 to Flarge = 1.0-0.8.<br>
According to a refinement of the fiber layer, at least<br>
some of the fibers have a fiber diameter which varies<br>
over their fiber length. In other words, this means<br>
that the fiber layer does not have to be produced with<br>
fibers of different configurations, but rather at least<br>
some of the fibers themselves are provided with a<br>
varying fiber diameter. This considerably simplifies<br>
the production of fiber layers of this type having<br>
varying parameters, in particular in series production.<br>
In this context, it is particularly advantageous for<br>
the magnitude of the fiber diameter to represent an<br>
extreme, in particular a minimum value, in a central<br>
portion of the fiber. In other words, this means that<br>
fibers which have two thick ends and a slender middle<br>
portion are provided. These fibers can then be combined<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
with one another in such a way that, for example, the<br>
portions of the fibers having the same fiber diameter<br>
are arranged adjacent to one another (in particular<br>
substantially in a cross-sectional plane parallel to<br>
the surface) , and in this way different strata are<br>
formed in the fiber layer.<br>
A further aspect of the invention proposes a<br>
particulate filter which is suitable for use in an<br>
exhaust system of a mobile internal combustion engine<br>
and comprises at least one fiber layer and at least one<br>
at least partially structured sheet. The at least one<br>
fiber layer and the at least one at least partially<br>
structured sheet together form passages of a honeycomb<br>
body, at least some of the passages having at least one<br>
honeycomb structure. In the particulate filter<br>
according to the invention, that at least one fiber<br>
layer has at least one parameter, selected from the<br>
group consisting of porosity and fiber diameter, which<br>
varies in the direction of a layer thickness. In this<br>
context, a particulate filter having a configuration of<br>
the fiber layer which has been described above in<br>
accordance with the invention is very particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
This particulate filter is preferably what is known as<br>
a "open filter system" as described in the<br>
introduction, in which context the content of<br>
disclosure of the abovementioned publications<br>
DE 201 17 873, WO 02/00326, WO 01/92692, WO 01/80978<br>
can be used for additional explanation over and above<br>
the following description. All currently known methods,<br>
in particular continuous and discontinuous methods, can<br>
be used to regenerate the particulate filter according<br>
to the invention, but continuous regeneration using the<br>
"CRT" method is preferred.<br>
The configuration of the particulate filter with a<br>
honeycomb body is fundamentally known. In this case, a<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
multiplicity of passages arranged substantially<br>
parallel to one another are formed, connecting an inlet<br>
side of the honeycomb body to an outlet side of the<br>
honeycomb body. The exhaust gas which is to be purified<br>
flows in via the inlet end side and passes through the<br>
passages as partial exhaust-gas streams. The<br>
microstructures effect pressure differences in the<br>
interior of the honeycomb body, so that the partial<br>
exhaust-gas streams at least partially penetrate<br>
through the fiber layer and are purified in the<br>
process. Honeycomb bodies of this type are preferably<br>
designed with a cell density of at least 100 cpsi,<br>
preferably in the range from 150 cpsi to 400 cpsi<br>
(cpsi: cells per square inch; 1 cpsi corresponds to one<br>
passage per 6.4516 square centimeters). The passages<br>
are usually each delimited by a subregion of the<br>
structured sheet and a subregion of the fiber layer.<br>
The sheet is likewise made from a corrosion-resistant<br>
material which is able to withstand high temperatures,<br>
in particular a metallic material. It is designed with<br>
a sheet thickness (foil thickness) of less than 100 um<br>
[micrometers] and preferably has a recurring<br>
(macro-)structure, e.g. a corrugation. Both the sheet<br>
and the fiber layer may be at least partially provided<br>
with one or various coatings, if appropriate also<br>
including catalytically active material. To ensure a<br>
permanent joining of sheets and fiber layers, they are<br>
joined to one another, in particular by soldering or<br>
welding.<br>
In accordance with a refinement of this particulate<br>
filter, it is proposed that the at least one<br>
microstructure be arranged in such a way in a passage<br>
that a gas stream flowing through it be diverted toward<br>
the at least one fiber layer. For this purpose, the<br>
microstructure may be designed as a guide surface,<br>
elevation, projection, etc., in order to provide<br>
pressure differences and/or flow-facing edges and<br>
thereby to divert the gas stream, which usually flows<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
in laminar form inside the passage, toward the fiber<br>
layer. Together with the gas stream, the entrained<br>
particulates are also diverted toward the fiber layer,<br>
where they ultimately accumulate as they pass through<br>
or come into contact with the fiber layer. The<br>
residence time of the particulates in the interior of<br>
the passage, the fiber layer or the particulate filter<br>
is then maintained until at least a large proportion of<br>
them are converted into gaseous constituents. For this<br>
purpose, it is possible to carry out thermal conversion<br>
and also conversion or regeneration using nitrogen<br>
oxides.<br>
In particular, the particulate filter is configured in<br>
such a way that the microstructure and fiber layer form<br>
a gap with a gap width of less than 1.5 mm. It is<br>
advantageous for the gap width to be approximately<br>
1.0 mm or in a range between 0.5 mm and 0.8 mm. In<br>
principle, it should be noted that a plurality of<br>
microstructures may be provided in the interior of a<br>
passage, in which case the gap does not have to be of<br>
identical design either within a passage or in adjacent<br>
passages. However, the provision of a gap ensures that<br>
an "open filter system" is produced. Consequently, at<br>
least part of the gas stream flowing through the<br>
passage is made to bypass the microstructure without<br>
completely penetrating through the fiber layer. The<br>
size and/or shape of the microstructure has a<br>
considerable influence on the flow diversion toward or<br>
through the fiber layer.<br>
In the configuration of the fiber layer with parameters<br>
which vary in the direction of the layer thickness<br>
which is proposed here, the result of this is that some<br>
of the exhaust gas or gas stream penetrates through the<br>
fiber layer and in this way enters an adjacent passage,<br>
while a further part of the exhaust gas or gas stream<br>
continues to flow along the passage, bypassing the<br>
microstructure.  Configuring the fiber layer with an<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
edge layer which represents a lower flow resistance to<br>
the gas stream than centrally arranged layers allows<br>
this "bypass" partial gas stream to at least partially<br>
penetrate through the edge layer and thus likewise<br>
enables some of the particulates entrained therein to<br>
be deposited on the fibers. This increases the<br>
efficiency of the particulate filter with regard to the<br>
removal of particulates, in particular carbon<br>
particulates, from a gas stream, in particular an<br>
exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine.<br>
Moreover, the invention proposes an exhaust system for<br>
an internal combustion engine which comprises the<br>
particulate filter according to the invention. The term<br>
internal combustion engine is to be understood in<br>
particular as meaning engines which produce an exhaust<br>
gas containing solid particulates. A mobile engine<br>
which burns diesel fuel is of particular importance in<br>
this context.<br>
Furthermore, the invention also proposes a vehicle<br>
comprising a particulate filter of the type described<br>
above. Vehicles are mentioned as a preferred use in<br>
addition to other application areas (lawn mowers, chain<br>
saws, etc.) since statutory provisions require<br>
particularly efficient purification of the exhaust<br>
gases from vehicles. This applies in particular to<br>
passenger automobiles and trucks.<br>
A further aspect of the invention proposes a method for<br>
removing particulates from a gas stream using a gas-<br>
permeable filter layer, the filter layer having<br>
subregions with a parameter of differing magnitudes in<br>
the direction of the layer thickness. This parameter<br>
relates at least to the porosity or the fiber diameter<br>
of fibers in the filter layer. In the method, the gas<br>
stream is divided into partial gas streams which are<br>
each passed through different subregions of the filter<br>
layer. In other words, this means that although the<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
partial gas streams may equally well flow through one<br>
subregion or a few subregions of the filter layer<br>
together but are ultimately divided, with one of the<br>
partial gas streams flowing through other and/or<br>
further subregions of the filter layer. This is<br>
intended in particular to express the fact that<br>
separation into the respective partial gas streams<br>
takes place not in the direction of the surface of the<br>
filter layer, but rather in the direction of its layer<br>
thickness. This means in particular that a partial gas<br>
stream completely flows through the gas-permeable<br>
filter layer, whereas another part of the gas stream<br>
only penetrates into the gas-permeable filter layer but<br>
emerges again on the same side or surface without<br>
completely flowing through the filter layer. The<br>
partial gas streams differ in this context, for<br>
example, with regard to their direction of flow, their<br>
flow velocity, their temperature, the extent to which<br>
they are laden with particulates, etc.<br>
As has already been stated above, it is particularly<br>
advantageous for a partial gas stream to be passed only<br>
through at least one edge layer of the filter layer,<br>
whereas a further partial gas stream flows through all<br>
the subregions of the filter layer. In this context, it<br>
should also be noted that the term filter layer is to<br>
be understood as meaning both a fiber layer of the type<br>
according to the invention and also a filter layer<br>
composed of other materials or substances which<br>
likewise have magnitudes of the above mentioned<br>
parameters which vary in the direction of the layer<br>
thickness, with an extreme of these magnitudes being at<br>
a distance from the surfaces of the filter layer.<br>
According to a further configuration of the method, the<br>
partial gas stream which flows through only the edge<br>
layer is guided along a filter distance through the<br>
edge layer, this filter distance at least corresponding<br>
to the layer thickness of the filter layer. This means<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
that the partial gas stream which does not completely<br>
flow through the filter layer (bypass) is in contact<br>
with the filter material over at least the same<br>
distance of flow path. As has already been stated, the<br>
efficiency of the layers or subregions of the filter<br>
layer may differ, but by ensuring the filtering<br>
distance described here it is ensured that at least a<br>
proportionate filter action is achieved for this<br>
exhaust gas which is only passed through the filter<br>
material in the edge layers. It is preferable for the<br>
filter distance to be lengthened by the factor by which<br>
the adjacent strata differ in terms of their efficiency<br>
or another parameter. The filter distance can be<br>
effected by the targeted provision of pressure<br>
differences or forced flow profiles, for example by the<br>
specific configuration of microstructures in a flow<br>
passage which is delimited by a gas-permeable filter<br>
layer of this type.<br>
Finally, it is also proposed that the quantitative<br>
determination of the respective partial gas streams be<br>
effected by the filter layer itself. In other words,<br>
this means that the configuration of the filter layer<br>
itself has means responsible for dividing the overall<br>
gas stream into partial gas streams. These means may be<br>
realized by different configurations of the parameters<br>
of the fiber layer, i.e. may also be inherent. For<br>
example, the configuration of the filter layer with<br>
different flow resistances or porosities in the<br>
direction of the layer thickness constitutes one<br>
possible way of effecting a quantitative determination<br>
or division of this type.<br>
The method described here can be realized particularly<br>
successfully with one of the proposed fiber layers<br>
according to the invention and/or a proposed<br>
configuration of the particulate filter according to<br>
the invention.<br><br>

The invention and the technical field of the invention<br>
are explained in more detail below on the basis of the<br>
figures. The figures also show particularly preferred<br>
embodiments of the particulate filter according to the<br>
invention and/or the fiber layer according to the<br>
invention, but the invention is not restricted to these<br>
embodiments. In the drawing:<br>

is suitable for the method according to the<br>
invention,<br>

to the invention;<br>

configuration of the fiber layer according to<br>
the invention;<br>

of an embodiment of the particulate filter;<br>
Fig. 5 shows a diagrammatic and perspective view of a<br>
vehicle having an exhaust system; and<br>
Fig. 6 diagrammatically depicts the structure of a<br>
particulate filter.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a diagrammatic and perspective view of a<br>
filter layer 23, which is usually provided in a<br>
predetermined layer length 29 and layer width 30. The<br>
filter layer 23 (and also the fiber layer 1) is<br>
delimited by two surfaces 6 which ultimately define a<br>
layer thickness 5 of the filter layer 23. In the<br>
direction of this layer thickness 5, the gas-permeable<br>
filter layer 23 has a plurality of subregions 10 (10.1,<br>
10.2, 10.3) which differ on the basis of parameters<br>
which describe the filter layer 23. Parameters which<br>
are characteristic of the filter layer 23 include, for<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
example, the porosity 7 or the fiber diameter 8 of<br>
fibers 4 if the filter layer 23 is designed as a fiber<br>
layer 1.<br>
As can be seen from the detail view, a gas stream 22<br>
which impinges on the filter layer 23 will partially<br>
penetrate into inner regions of the filter layer 23.<br>
After the entire gas stream 22 has penetrated through<br>
the first subregion 10.1, it reaches the second<br>
subregion 10.2. This subregion 10.2, which is arranged<br>
in the central region, has a porosity and/or fiber<br>
diameter which is impenetrable to part of the gas<br>
stream 22. Accordingly, this partial gas stream 24.1 is<br>
deflected at the transition to the second subregion<br>
10.2 and flows back through the first subregion 10.1<br>
before leaving the filter layer 23. Another partial gas<br>
stream 24.2 which, for example, has a higher flow<br>
velocity, a lower level of particulates, etc., however,<br>
also penetrates through the second subregion 10.2.<br>
Then, the partial gas stream 24.2 passes into the<br>
adjacent subregion 10.3, flows through the latter and<br>
emerges again on the opposite surface 6. Both the first<br>
partial gas stream 24.1 and the second partial gas<br>
stream 24.2 were in contact with at least a first<br>
subregion 10.1 of the filter layer 23. However, whereas<br>
the first partial gas stream 24.1 only flowed through a<br>
subregion 10.1, the partial gas stream 24.2 was passed<br>
through all the subregions 10.1, 10.2, 10.3. In this<br>
case, the quantitative determination of the partial gas<br>
streams 24 was effected by the filter layer 23 itself,<br>
since it presents different flow resistances in its<br>
subregions 10, leading to such a division of the gas<br>
stream 22.<br>
Fig. 2 diagrammatically depicts a detail of a fiber<br>
layer 1. Fibers 4 with a first fiber diameter 8 are<br>
provided in the vicinity of the surfaces 6 which<br>
delimit the fiber layer 1. Fibers 4 are also provided<br>
in a central region but have a different fiber diameter<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
8. The differently shaped fibers 4 are permanently<br>
joined to one another and form a random assembly, with<br>
a porosity 7 being realized at the same time. In<br>
addition to this detail view of a fiber layer 1, the<br>
left-hand and right-hand sides of the figure<br>
diagrammatically depict profiles of magnitudes of the<br>
parameters porosity 7 and fiber diameter 8 over the<br>
layer thickness 5.<br>
The left-hand side of figure 2 illustrates the profile<br>
of the porosity 7. An extreme 9 where the porosity 7 is<br>
lowest is located in the central region, i.e. at a<br>
distance from the surfaces 6. The profile of the<br>
porosity 7 is substantially symmetrical with respect to<br>
a middle stratum of the fiber layer 1 and configured<br>
with continuous transitions.<br>
Similarly, the right-hand side of figure 2 illustrates<br>
the profile of the fiber diameter 8 over the layer<br>
thickness 5. On account of the fact that fibers 4 with<br>
a small fiber diameter 8 are provided in the central<br>
region and fibers 4 with a thicker fiber diameter 8 are<br>
provided in the edge layers, there is a sudden change<br>
in the fiber diameters 8, as illustrated on the right-<br>
hand side. An extreme 9 is once again formed in the<br>
central region.<br>
Fig. 3 once again diagrammatically depicts a fiber<br>
layer 1 with a particularly pronounced detail. This<br>
detail shows the fiber layer 1 with a coating 31 on<br>
both surfaces of the fiber layer 1; the coating may, of<br>
course, also extend into inner regions or even over all<br>
the free surfaces of the fibers 4. The fiber layer 1 is<br>
in this case configured as an ordered combination of<br>
fibers 4, the fibers 4 being designed with a fiber<br>
diameter 8 which varies over their fiber length 11. For<br>
this purpose, the fibers 4 have a central portion 12,<br>
in which the fiber diameter 8 reaches an extreme 9, as<br>
can also be seen diagrammatically on the right-hand<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
side from the profile illustrated. In the example shown<br>
here, the fiber diameters 8 are designed to be<br>
different in the vicinity of each surface 6, so that in<br>
this case the profile of the fiber diameters 8 is not<br>
symmetrical over the fiber length 9 or layer thickness<br>
5. The identical, ordered orientation or alignment of<br>
the fibers 4 once again causes the formation of edge<br>
layers 25 which provide a configuration of the fiber<br>
layer 1 with parameters which vary in the direction of<br>
the layer thickness 5. With the configuration of the<br>
fibers 4 illustrated here it is also possible to<br>
provide further fibers 4 (for example of a different<br>
material or with a constant fiber diameter) in a<br>
subregion of the fiber layer 1, which further fibers<br>
are integrated in the fiber combination.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a diagrammatic view, in the form of<br>
partial cross sections, of the structure of a<br>
particulate filter 13 according to the invention which<br>
is suitable for use in an exhaust system of a mobile<br>
internal combustion engine. The particulate filter 13<br>
comprises a fiber layer 1 with at least one parameter,<br>
selected from the group consisting of porosity and<br>
fiber diameter, which varies in the direction of a<br>
layer thickness 5 and at least one at least partially<br>
structured sheet 14, which together form a plurality of<br>
passages 15. In the embodiment illustrated, the sheet<br>
14 has microstructures 17. A passage 15 of this type is<br>
illustrated in detail and in the form of a longitudinal<br>
section in the upper part of Fig. 4, indicated by "A".<br>
Beneath this, indicated by "B", a cross section through<br>
the passage 15 is diagrammatically depicted, the cross-<br>
sectional plane also being shown in illustration "A",<br>
indicating the direction of viewing.<br>
The mode of action is explained in more detail below. A<br>
gas stream 22 carrying particulates 21, in particular<br>
an exhaust gas stream, flows through the passage 15,<br>
where  it  impinges  on  the  microstructure  17  which<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
projects into the passage 15. The result of this is<br>
that the gas stream 22 is diverted toward the fiber<br>
layer 1. The fiber layer 1 has edge layers 25 and a<br>
central layer in the interior. Whereas the entire gas<br>
stream 22 penetrates through the first edge layer 25,<br>
the middle layer, on account of its parameters (such as<br>
for example porosity and/or fiber diameter) , forms a<br>
flow resistance to a partial gas stream 24 which is<br>
such that said partial gas stream does not penetrate<br>
through this layer. Rather, this deflected partial gas<br>
stream 24 flows along a filter distance 26 through the<br>
edge region 25 before ultimately emerging back into the<br>
passage 15. Another part of the gas stream 22<br>
penetrates through this middle layer and also the edge<br>
layer 25 which adjoins it and emerges again on the<br>
opposite surface. As the gas stream 22 flows through<br>
the fiber layer 1, the entrained particulates 21<br>
collect on the fibers 4 of the fiber layer 1, so that<br>
ultimately the gas stream 22 is purified.<br>
The microstructures 17 are provided for the purpose of<br>
flow diversion and/or for producing pressure<br>
differences in adjacent passages 15. These<br>
microstructures 17 comprise projections which are<br>
worked into the material or structure of the sheet 14.<br>
It is possible to use pure deformation steps, but it is<br>
also possible for microstructures 17 of this type to be<br>
produced by stamping or other cutting processes, in<br>
which case openings 32 are generally introduced into<br>
the sheet 14. This also provides flow communication<br>
between adjacent passages 15, so that the exhaust gas<br>
which is to be purified can be mixed again and again.<br>
The microstructures 17, which are in this case formed<br>
as guiding surfaces, form a gap 18 together with the<br>
fiber layer 1, which gap has a predetermined gap width<br>
19. The configuration of the microstructure 17 and the<br>
configuration of the fiber layer 1, and also the<br>
characteristics of the flow of the gas stream 22, now<br>
effect quantitative division into various partial gas<br><br>
- 22 -<br>
streams 24.<br>
Figure 5 shows a diagrammatic and perspective view of a<br>
vehicle 20 comprising an internal combustion engine 3<br>
with an associated exhaust system 2. The exhaust gas<br>
which is generated in the internal combustion engine 3<br>
flows through the exhaust system in a preferred<br>
direction of flow 33 and, after it has been purified,<br>
is released to the environment. The exhaust system 2<br>
comprises an exhaust pipe 28 in which a plurality of<br>
different exhaust-gas treatment devices are provided in<br>
series. In the present case, the exhaust gas flows<br>
through the following components in succession:<br>
oxidation catalytic converter 27, particulate filter<br>
13, catalytic converter 27. In principle, however, the<br>
particulate filter 13 can be integrated in any<br>
combination of known exhaust-gas treatment devices.<br>
Connecting an oxidation catalytic converter 27 and a<br>
particulate filter 13 in series as shown here in<br>
particular allows continuous regeneration of the<br>
particulate filter in accordance with the "CRT"<br>
principle described in the introduction.<br>
Fig. 6 diagrammatically depicts an end-side view of a<br>
particulate filter 13 which comprises a housing 34 and<br>
a honeycomb body 16 located therein. The honeycomb body<br>
16 is formed with a plurality of stacks 35 of fiber<br>
layers 1 and sheets 14 which have been wound together.<br>
The alternately stacked fiber layers 1 and structured<br>
sheets 14 form passages 15 through which an exhaust gas<br>
can flow. Microstructures 17 (not shown), which cause<br>
the gas streams 22 to flow through the fiber layer 1,<br>
are provided in the interior of the passages.<br>
The invention described here allows particularly<br>
efficient removal of particulates from exhaust gases<br>
from mobile internal combustion engines.<br><br>

16.	The method as claimed in claim 15, in which the<br>
partial gas stream (24) which comes into contact<br>
only with the edge layer  (25)  flows through a<br>
filter distance (26) which corresponds to at least<br>
the layer thickness (5) of the filter layer (23).<br>
17.	The method as claimed in claim 14 or 15, in which<br>
the quantitative determination of the respective<br>
partial gas streams (24) is effected by the filter<br>
layer (23) itself.<br><br>
The invention proposes a method for removing<br>
particulates (21) from a gas stream (22) having a gas permeable filter layer (23) which has subregions (10)<br>
with a parameter of differing magnitudes in the<br>
direction of the layer thickness (5), this parameter<br>
relating at least to the porosity (7), the fiber<br>
diameter (8) of fibers (4) or the fiber type content of<br>
the filter layer (23) . In the method, the gas stream<br>
(22) is divided into partial gas streams (24) which are<br>
each passed through different subregions (10) of the<br>
filter layer (23) . The invention also describes fiber<br>
layers, particulate filters, exhaust systems and<br>
vehicles which are based on this method.<br></td>
