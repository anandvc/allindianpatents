Title: Method and device for removing contaminant trace species, especially arse-<br>
nic, from water<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method and a device for purifying water from contami-<br>
nant trace species, especially arsenic, by treating said water with iron and co-precipitating<br>
trace species during oxidation and precipitation of iron compounds with subsequent sepa-<br>
ration.<br>
Background Art<br>
The presence of substances harmful to the environment or health in drinking water, even<br>
in very small amounts (so called trace species), has become a focus of attention for indi-<br>
viduals as well as authorities, as knowledge and analytical techniques improve. Arsenic<br>
(As) in drinking water, for example, increases the cancer risk of human beings. Therefore,<br>
authorities have lowered the limit for As in drinking water from 50 ug/l to 5 ug/l. However,<br>
this resulted in a large number of waterworks failing to comply with a limit of 5 u.g/1 using<br>
existing methods, and hence had either to close down or to invest in expensive purifica-<br>
tion equipment. To this day, no profitable methods for this purpose are known capable of<br>
reducing the content of arsenic from a frequently encountered level of 20-35 u.g/1 down to<br>
below 5 jig/I. The problem is particularly pronounced in waterworks having groundwater<br>
with a low iron content.<br>
In waterworks with groundwater having a high content of iron compounds, the problem is<br>
less pronounced, since arsenic is co-precipitated with oxidized iron compounds, when the<br>
water is treated in a conventional way by oxidation, typically aeration, until iron precipi-<br>
tates in sand filters or precipitation basins. However, it is not possible to remove arsenic<br>
by conventional oxidation of water, if the iron content of the water is not sufficient to en-<br>
sure the desired co-precipitation of present arsenic and other contaminants, including pes-<br>
ticides.<br>
DE 197 45 664 A1 discloses a method for treating arsenic-containing water, where the<br>
water flows through a reactor filled with an iron-containing granulate, said granulate being<br>
produced by mixing sand and iron powder and subsequent firing under exclusion of oxy-<br><br>
2<br>
gen. In the reactor, the iron is oxidized by the oxygen dissolved in water generating Fe(lll)<br>
ions, said ions together with As forming poorly soluble iron arsenate Excess Fe(lll) ions<br>
are precipitated as iron hydroxide binding As by adsorption. Thus, As binds to the granu-<br>
late, wherefrom it has to be removed at suitable intervals. When precipitating Fe(lll) com-<br>
pounds, the granulate used agglomerates comparatively quickly and has to be exchanged<br>
frequently. The manufacture of the granulate requires work and energy. Moreover, the<br>
method requires the supply of additional oxygen to the reactor prior to treatment, if the<br>
treated groundwater is low in oxygen. In conclusion, the known method is work-intensive,<br>
complicated and expensive-<br>
US 5 951 869 describes a reactor, where water is treated with iron while simultaneously<br>
supplying oxygen. The treatment takes place in a fluid bed with iron particles as the<br>
source of iron. The use of a fluid bed is a high-cost and complicated method.<br>
EP 0 737 650 A2 and US 5 368 703 provide the enrichment of water with iron using an<br>
electrolytic method. The use of electrolysis is energy-intensive and complicated.<br><br><br>

WO 98/57893 (Nikolaidis) discloses the treatment of arsenic containing water with metallic<br>
iron under anaerobic conditions. The arsenic compounds are reduced and the iron is oxi-<br>
dised providing iron ions leading to co-precipitation of arsenic compounds, but siili under<br>
anaerobic conditions.<br>
US 5 358 643 (McClintock) discloses treatment of arsenic contaminated water with an iron<br>
salt, an acid and an oxidant until the water contains more iron than arsenic and has a posi-<br>
tive oxygen/reduction potential (ORP) of about plus 600 mV ensuring that the arsenic will<br>
be pentavalent (step a). Then the water is made basic (step b) and the formed reaction mix-<br>
ture is reacted to precipitate compounds of As and Fe (step c) followed by separation of the<br>
precipitates from the water (step d). The steps a and b, and in a preferred embodiment also<br>
step c, are carried out without exposing the water/reaction mixture to air. Thus, an inten-<br>
tional active oxidation during the co-precipitation of As and Fe is not disclosed.<br>
US 2002/003116 A1 (Golden) discloses treatment of arsenic containing water first with an<br>
oxidant (hydrogen peroxide) and thereafter with an iron salt (ferric sulfate).<br>
JP 2003 126874 A (Hitachi) teaches to feed the water to be treated to an oxidizing vessel<br>
where the water is aerated with an aerating means.<br><br>
2b<br>
The above-mentioned methods have the common feature that the iron treatment takes<br>
place concomitant with aeration or requires that the water has a suitable oxygen content<br>
from the very start Accordingly, there is an increased risk that the system is clogged by<br>
the precipitated oxidized iron compounds.<br>
Hence, there is still a need for an uncomplicated and profitable method for removing arse-<br>
nic and other trace species harmful to health from drinking water, especially drinking water<br>
based on low-iron groundwater.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
It has been found that arsenic, optionally residual pesticides and other trace species<br>
harmful to health, are removable from water, especially drinking water, in a considerably<br>
less complicated and at the same time more efficient manner, if the water to be treated is<br>
first enriched with iron, while the oxygen content of the water is comparatively low, and<br>
subsequently exposed to strong aeration.<br><br>
3<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method for purifying water from contami-<br>
nant trace species, especially arsenic, by treating said water with iron and co-precipitating<br>
trace species during oxidation, and precipitation of iron compounds with subsequent sepa-<br>
ration, characterized in that<br>
-	first, the water is contacted with an iron-containing material for enriching the wa-<br>
ter with iron compounds,<br>
-	then, the iron-enriched-water oxidizes for co-precipitation of the contaminant<br>
trace species together with oxidized iron compounds, and<br>
-	finally, the precipitated compounds are separated from the water.<br>
The iron compounds may be added to the water in a simple and reliable manner at ac-<br>
ceptable cost by contacting the water with an iron-containing material, preferably iron ore<br>
or metallic iron, particularly iron filings or swarfs, available as an inexpensive waste prod-<br>
uct in the form of calcinated waste iron from cutting machines. This may be accomplished<br>
by leading the water through a bed of iron ore, iron particles, iron filings or swarfs or any<br>
other natural iron-containing material having a large surface. The water may be distributed<br>
across the bed, e. g. by naturally spraying the bed, and after treatment, it may be removed<br>
from the bottom of the bed by means of suitable openings.<br>
Next, the iron-treated water is led to a conventional aerator and, if necessary, a suitable<br>
filter, e. g. a sand filter, to remove arsenic and other trace species. This treatment is car-<br>
ried out in a conventional manner and ensures precipitation of iron compounds necessary<br>
for co-precipitation of arsenic and other trace species.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the water is returned once or several times after precipitation<br>
and separation of the iron compounds for renewed contact with the iron-containing mate-<br>
rial. With this treatment, the content of arsenic and other trace species may be reduced<br>
even further.<br>
Thus, the method according to the invention permits to lower the content of substances<br>
harmful to health and environment, such as As and residual pesticides, in drinking water<br>
to a harmless low level below limits currently in force and in a profitable manner.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, water is contacted with an iron-containing material<br>
under low-oxygen conditions, e. g.. in a suitable closed system, such as a closed box.<br><br>
4<br>
Thus, the formation of Fe(lll)-containing compounds and premature precipitation of iron<br>
compounds is reduced.<br>
The scope of the applicability of the invention will appear from the detailed description be-<br>
low, it is apparent, however, that the detailed description and the specific examples illus-<br>
trating preferred embodiments of the invention are only given by way of example, and<br>
various alterations and modifications falling within the scope of the invention will become<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the detailed description.<br>
Best Modes for Carrying out the Invention<br>
During conventional treatment of groundwater to be used as drinking water one treatment<br>
process is the removal of the iron and manganese content from groundwater. This is ac-<br>
complished by simple oxidation and filtration at waterworks, Traditionally, this treatment is<br>
carried out, because groundwater often contains iron in such high concentrations that it<br>
has to be removed prior to distribution. The content of iron compounds in the groundwa-<br>
ter, said compounds mainly being Fe(ll) compounds, is not harmful to health, but may<br>
cause problems with bacterial growth (iron-oxidizing bacteria), precipitation in the water<br>
distribution system, discoloration of clothes and basins, bad taste and clouding. Iron is<br>
removed by means of aeration and subsequent precipitation and filtration.<br>
As mentioned above, several contaminant trace species co-precipitate with iron com-<br>
pounds, so that it is normally not a problem to comply with established limits of such sub-<br>
stances.<br>
However, not all waterworks have groundwater with such high iron concentrations. In such<br>
waterworks, the new more restrictive limits, in the case of As lowered by one order of<br>
magnitude from 50 µm/l to 5 µm/I, cause serious problems, since co-precipitation with<br>
modest amounts of iron compounds is not sufficiently effective.<br>
It has now been found, that the concentrations of As and other harmful substances in<br>
drinking water may be lowered in a surprisingly simple manner to well below the obligatory<br>
limits according to the present method by ensuring a sufficiently high iron concentration in<br>
the water prior to conventional oxidation and precipitation of oxidized iron compounds,<br>
typically Fe(lll) compounds.<br><br>
5<br>
Preferably, the iron concentration in water is increased by contacting the water intimately<br>
with an iron material having a suitably large contact surface. An inexpensive material is<br>
iron swarfs, available as a waste product of machining, said swarfs having being calci-<br>
nated prior to their use to remove residual cutting oil. Another material is iron ore.<br>
in practice, the contact between water and the iron material may be achieved by spraying<br>
a suitable bed of iron material, for example a layer of iron swarfs having a thickness of<br>
10-30 cm and arranged in a perforated tray made of plastic or stainless steel. The thick-<br>
ness of the bed of iron swarfs is adjusted so that the desired amount of iron to be added<br>
to the water is achieved. The tray is provided with a plurality of holes, e. g. having a di-<br>
ameter of 3-4 mm, at the bottom of the tray. The water is supplied to the bed of iron<br>
swarfs in a manner ensuring a good and uniform distribution This may be accomplished<br>
in a manner well-known to a person skilled in the art, for example by means of a suitable<br>
number of nozzles or from an overhead distributor tray adapted as a drip tray with a plu-<br>
rality of holes so that the bed of iron swarfs is constantly sprayed with water. The water<br>
thereby takes up rust/iron, and the content of iron in the water increases.<br>
The water thus enriched with iron is subsequently treated in a traditional manner by oxida-<br>
tion, precipitation and separation, usually by means of sedimentation and/or filtration, thus<br>
obtaining pure drinking water, said water not only being freed from iron and manganese<br>
again, but also freed from various contaminant trace species, such as for example As and<br>
pesticides co-precipitated with Fe(lll) compounds.<br>
As mentioned above, iron oxidation may be accomplished in a manner known per se in a<br>
conventional aeration device, such as a splasher, drip-type sheet, cascade aerator or by<br>
blowing in air or oxygen, resulting in precipitation and separation of Fe(lll) compounds. In<br>
an advantageous embodiment, oxidation is accomplished in an aeration device of the type<br>
described in EP Patent No. 1 070 022. Usually, this device achieves an oxidation of water<br>
10 times more effective compared to common known cascade aerators. Using suitable<br>
dimensioning a saturation of about 95% may thus be obtained.<br>
EP 1 070 022 provides an aeration device for the treatment of water by means of a perfo-<br>
rated plate being a plate formed with holes where water flows through at the beginning of<br>
the treatment and is changed into drops. Below the perforated plate, there is an assembly<br><br>
6<br>
of ensuring a division of the drops The assembly comprise several layers of tubular ele-<br>
ments, the walls of each of said pipes being constructed of a wire net. The tubular ele-<br>
ments in each layer are arranged horizontally and mutually in parallel, while the tubular<br>
elements in adjacent layers are arranged perpendicular to each other.<br>
The method of operation of the aeration device includes groundwater being pumped to the<br>
top of the unit and running down over the tubular elements so that the water drops im-<br>
pinge on obstacles 60-80 times and are divided into microdrops prior to the water being<br>
collected in a collection container or basin, wherefrom the purified water may be with-<br>
drawn. Oxidized iron compounds are precipitated in the collection container, wherefrom<br>
they may be removed as necessary by light flushing. Subsequently, the water may be fil-<br>
tered, if required, typically in an sand filter, to ensure further precipitation of iron and trace<br>
species. In many cases however, separation in the collection container is sufficiently ef-<br>
fective so that sand filtration may be dispensed with.<br>
In combination with the above-mentioned aeration device the bed of iron material men-<br>
tioned above, for example a bed of iron swarfs in a perforated tray made of plastic or<br>
stainless steel mentioned above, may be arranged directly above the aeration unit. Ac-<br>
cordingly, groundwater may be pumped directly to the distributor tray above the bed of<br>
iron swarfs, where it passes first through the bed of iron filings without further pumps,<br>
where it is enriched with oxidizable iron compounds, whereupon it passes through the<br>
aeration device ensuring precipitation of the iron compounds and co-precipitation of con-<br>
taminant trace species<br>
As mentioned above, precipitation in the collection container or basin is often satisfactory<br>
in the known aeration device, if necessary however, residual iron compounds with bound<br>
trace species may be precipitated during subsequent filtration, e. g. in a sand filter.<br>
In practice, the bed of iron-containing material is dimensioned such that it is ensured that<br>
water takes up the amount of iron compounds necessary for binding present As, pesti-<br>
cides and other harmful trace species for binding them effectively to the iron which is pre-<br>
cipitated during the aeration process.<br>
To begin with, the invention was tested with respect to fulfilling the new more restrictive<br>
limit for arsenic in drinking water. However, initial experiments have also confirmed co-<br><br>
7<br>
precipitation of pesticides and MTBE (methyl t-butyl ether) together with the oxidized iron<br>
compounds.<br>
One potential application of the method according to the invention relates to the removal<br>
of residual arsenic from chemically treated waste materials, such as chemically treated<br>
timber waste. Timber waste is immersed in a water basin, where residua! arsenic eventu-<br>
ally permeates into the water The water from the basin is continuously pumped through a<br>
bed of iron-containing compounds and further through an aeration device and from there<br>
recycled back to the water basin. Precipitated iron compounds bind the arsenic dissolved<br>
in the water and settle at the bottom of the basin. The process continues, until the arsenic<br>
has been washed out of the wood to a satisfactory extent.<br>
The method and device according to the invention are uncomplicated and inexpensive.<br>
The enrichment of water with iron requires no critical precise dosing of iron compounds,<br>
since a suitable system for distributing the water across the iron swarfs in a plastic tray<br>
having suitably dimensioned holes has been found to work in an effective manner over a<br>
long period of time, such as 6 months, until the iron swarfs ought to be exchanged. Ac-<br>
cordingly, the device may be monitored by persons without any special training and is just<br>
as usable in industrial countries as it is in developing countries.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawing<br>
The invention is explained in detail below with reference to the drawing, in which<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic view of a device according to the invention having a bed of iron<br>
swarfs arranged above an aeration device, and<br>
Fig.. 2 shows the bed of iron swarfs in a plastic tray.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, groundwater is pumped with a pump 1 over the top of the device to a<br>
drip tray 2, wherefrom it is uniformly distributed across a bed of iron swarfs 3 approx.<br>
10 cm thick, said bed being arranged in a perforated plastic tray 4. During its passage<br>
through the bed 3 water takes up iron, predominantly in the form of Fe(ll) compounds.<br>
From the plastic tray 4 water drips down to an aeration device of the type described in<br>
EP 1 070 022, where it is aerated effectively in an aeration chamber 5 filled with special<br>
tubular elements as described above, said tubular elements ensuring an air saturation of<br>
up to 95%, The aerated water is directed to a collection container 6, where precipitated<br><br>
8<br>
iron compounds settle with co-precipitation of arsenic and other trace species. In a simple<br>
embodiment, pure drinking water may be taken out directly from the collection container 6,<br>
since sedimentation of the iron precipitate ensures sufficient separation. To improve<br>
sedimentation, the water from the collection container 6 may be fed to a sand filter 8 by<br>
means of a pump 7, wherefrom the pure drinking water 9 may be taken out.<br>
In another embodiment, the aeration chambers may be formed as an empty gravity<br>
chamber, where water drops from the perforated plastic tray 4 are aerated during the free<br>
fall down in the collection container 6.<br>
if the treated drinking water has an As content of above the limit 5 µm/l, the water in the<br>
collection container 6 may be recycled to the drip tray 2 at the top of the device through a<br>
pipe 10 using a pump for renewed treatment with iron addition and subsequent aeration<br>
and precipitation.<br>
Example 1<br>
Above an aeration device of the type described in EP 1 070 022 (Microdrop-MP1 L, avail-<br>
able from MicroDrop Aqua, Taastrup, Denmark), there is arranged a bed of iron filings<br>
having a thickness of 10 cm in an approx. 700 x 550 mm perforated plastic tray, said bed<br>
having an overhead drip tray for distributing the water. Groundwater having a low iron<br>
content and 30 ppm As was introduced above the drip tray in an amount of 0,5 m3/h.<br>
When passing through the bed of iron filings, the water took up approx. 1 mg iron per litre.<br>
After aeration to a saturation of up to 95% with precipitation of iron in the collection con-<br>
tainer, the water withdrawn therefrom had an As content of 10 ppm, i e. one third of the<br>
original As content.<br>
After a single passage, the water may be recycled for a new iron treatment, aeration and<br>
precipitation, thus reducing the As content to approx. 3-4 ppm, a value below the new<br>
more restrictive limit for drinking water.<br>
Example 2<br>
The present example illustrates a device according to the invention provided for a flow of<br>
0,05-1,0 m3/h and set up at a waterworks. Iron swarfs are arranged in a bed with a thick-<br>
ness of 10 cm in a perforated 800 x 605 mm plastic tray. Before start-up of the device, the<br>
iron swarfs were sprinkled with water for 4 days to ensure rust formation on the surface of<br><br>
9<br>
the iron swarfs. On the first day after start-up of the device, the supplied groundwater, the<br>
water after passage through the iron filings, the water in the collection container (tank) af-<br>
ter the aerator and the water in the outflow of a sand filter, respectively, were analysed.<br>
The results are shown in table 1.<br><br>
As is apparent, the limit for As of 5 µg/l has been complied with.<br>
The iron swarfs used are an inexpensive material usable for 6 months, based on experi-<br>
ence. When treating groundwater with iron swarfs prior to aeration, severe coating of the<br>
iron swarfs are avoided, said coatings being capable of blocking the release of iron com-<br>
pounds into the water. To avoid the formation of coatings, the water ought not to remain in<br>
contact with the bed of iron swarfs over a longer period. In practice, the water is treated<br>
immediately after iron enrichment by passing through a bed of iron swarfs in an aeration<br>
device with strong aeration, whereupon iron and arsenic are precipitated, partly in the<br>
subsequent collection tank and partly in the sand filter.<br><br>
10<br>
The invention having been described herein, it is apparent that it may be modified in many<br>
ways. Such variations are not to be considered as deviating from the scope of the inven-<br>
tion, and all such modifications apparent to those skilled in the art are to be understood as<br>
being comprised by the scope of the appended claims.<br><br>

	Application no. PCT/DK2006/000250<br>
	Our ref: 82125 2eu/NG<br>
38 June 2007<br>
8.	A device for purifying water from contaminant trace species by co-precipitating<br>
the trace species comprising an aerator (5) for oxidation and precipitation of iron com-<br>
pounds with subsequent separation, characterized in that a non aerated assembly (2, 3,<br>
4) for supplying iron compounds to the water is Incorporated prior to the aerator (5).<br>
9.	The device according to claim 8, characterized in that the assembly for supplying<br>
iron compounds comprises a distributor means (2) for distributing water across a bed (3)<br>
of iron particles, iron filings or swarfs, iron ore or any other natural iron-containing material<br>
having a large surface, as well as one or more openings below the bed for the outflow or<br>
iron-enriched water.<br>
10.	The device according to claim 8 or 9, characterized in that the assembly (2, 3, 4)<br>
for supplying iron compounds to the water is arranged above a perforated plate to form<br>
drops, said perforated plate being positioned above a drop division assembly composed<br>
of a plurality of tubular elements in the form of pipes having pipe walls made of wire net,<br>
said tubular elements being placed in horizontal layers of several parallel tubular elements<br>
stacked in such a way that the longitudinal axis of the tubular elements in one layer are<br>
angularly displaced in relation to the tubular elements in the one or more adjacent layers,<br>
preferably with an angle of 90°.<br>
11.	The device according to claim 8 to 10, characterized in that it further comprises a<br>
recirculation pipe (10) for recycling the treated water to the assembly (2, 3, 4) for supply-<br>
ing of iron compounds to the water.<br><br>
A method and a device for purifying water from contaminant trace species, especially arsenic,<br>
by co-precipitating trace species during oxidation and precipitation of iron compounds<br>
with subsequent separation. The co-precipitation is improved by contacting the<br>
water with an iron-containing material prior to oxidation to increase the iron content of the<br>
water. Arsenic and other trace species harmful to health may be removed from water effectively<br>
and in a simple manner, thus being able to comply with the more restrictive limits<br>
of arsenic in drinking water.</td>
