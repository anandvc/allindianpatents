AMORPHOUS SILICA ALUMINA COGEL: SUPPORT OR CATALYST<br>
Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved silica-alumina catalyst compositions, more particularly the present invention relates to a highly homogeneous amorphous silica-alumina cogel material.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Silica, alumina and their amorphous mixtures are well known as catalysts used in hydrocarbon conversion process. The method of preparation clearly controls the resultant activity (such as hydrocracking, hydrodepolymerisation or deoxygenation activity), and physical properties (such as pore structure and volume, surface area, density and catalyst strength). There exist a need to develop a silica/alumina catalyst or support for catalyst which can be used particularly in reactions that require acidic catalysts, or can optionally be combined with metal oxides.<br>
Previous researchers focused mainly on the preparation of a cogel for a particular operation i.e. hydrocracking, hydrodepolymerisation etc. With the existing cogels it was not possible to detect how or which parameters of the support or catalyst are responsible for the improvement of the reaction. Therefore, there exists a need to develop a catalyst support having both good activity and high product selectivity, and a process for the preparation thereof. So a broad area of hydrocracking, hydrodepolymerisation or deoxygenation have been covered and the support preparation is defined in terms of its acidic sites, surface area etc.<br>
Objects of the present invention:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a silica alumina cogel.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a silica/alumina catalyst or support<br>
for catalyst that can be used particularly in reactions that require acidic catalysts or<br>
support.<br>
 <br>
Description of the invention:<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of an amorphous silica alumina catalyst or support for catalyst, used specifically for hydrocracking, hydrodepolymerisation or deoxygenation, aliphatic unsaturation-reductions etc. of fuels obtained from petroleum, coal, biomass etc. The catalyst or support are particularly appropriate for the conversion of petroleum oils, refractory oils, solid fuels or biofuels or solid carbonaceous matter to high valued low boiling oils or benzenoid products. The catalyst or support comprises a unique cogelled silica-alumina matrix.<br>
The present invention provides a highly homogeneous, amorphous silica-alumina cogel material, which is useful for the hydrocracking, hydrodepolymerisation, deoxygenation, aliphatic unsaturation-reductions processes etc.<br>
The cogel of the present invention is preferably composed of silica, alumina and their amorphous mixtures. The method of preparation controls physical properties, such as pore structure and volume, surface area, density and catalyst strength, which in turn governs the resultant activity such as cracking, hydrocracking, hydrodepolymerisation or deoxygenation, aliphatic unsaturation-reductions etc. of biomass, coal, petroleum or any carbonaceous matter. It must be noted that seemingly very minor differences in the preparation factors discussed below can make significant differences in the make-up and effectiveness for a particular purpose of the matrix and a catalyst of which it may be a component.<br>
The numerous specific factors that are involved in preparing materials containing alumina-silica amorphous mixtures include: the mole ratio of silica to alumina, the molar concentrations of the silica and alumina in water, the source of silica and alumina, the pH of the solutions when combined, the pH of the mixture during precipitation, the pH of the mixture after precipitation, the rate of mixing of two solutions, the kind of solution for optimization of pH, time duration for complete precipitation, method of filtration and maintaining the temperature of furnace.<br>
 <br>
The properties of the composition are highly sensitive to each of these factors, and variations among these factors, especially in combination, will greatly influence the particular properties of the final cogel produced.<br>
This cogel is surprisingly active for the cracking of large molecules such as biomass. This cogel is particularly used for support of cracking or reduction catalysts such as cobalt-molybdnem, nickel-tungstate amd iron-chromate etc.<br>
The obtained products have high gasoline character. This is the indication of high octane<br>
value. The cogel can be made in either a batch or continuous mode. Among the unique<br>
characteristics of the fresh/non-steamed cogel are:<br>
High MAT (microactivity testing, according to ASTM test method D-3907) conversions<br>
obtainable between about 50% and 75%;<br>
The specific surface areas were determined by the Brunauer-Emmell-Teller (BET)<br>
method. Characteristics of the studied ASA are summarized in table-1<br>
 <br>
IR spectroscopies of probe molecules (Pyridine, carbon monoxide) give a new insight into the acidic sites of amorphous silica alumina (ASA). ASA samples are heterogeneous compounds that contain a silica alumina mixed phase as well as aluminium clusters and silica zones.<br>
A preferred aspect of the present invention provides a process for preparing a silica-alumina cogelled catalyst comprising steps of:<br>
 <br>
1.	adding a sodium silicate or tetraethoxy silane solution to an aqueous solution of an acid<br>
aluminum salt, such as aluminum nitrate, aluminum carbonate, aluminum oxalate or<br>
aluminum formate and an acid, such as nitric acid, carbonic acid, formic acid or oxalic<br>
acid but preferably a weak acid such as acetic, to form an acidified silica sol in said<br>
aluminum salt solution; the pH of said mixture being in the range of 1 to less than about<br>
3;<br>
2.	raising the pH of the mixture by adding base, such as KOH or NaOH, preferably KOH, to a pH range of about 5-8;<br>
3.	Stirring the cogelled slurry and keeping it for over night for complete precipitation and homogenicity;<br>
4.	removing the filtrate to recover the cogelled mass;<br>
5.	adding an acid, such as nitric, oxalic, or formic acid to adjust the pH to 5-7.<br>
6.	washing with diionised water to remove the counter ions such as Na+ and K+ for at<br>
least 3-8 times.<br>
7.	washing the cogelled hydrogel to reduce the Na20 content to less than 1 weight<br>
percent.<br>
First, the silica sol described in Step (1) is preferably defined as a colloidal dispersion or suspension of the metal oxide in a liquid. In a step (3), cogelled slurry or hydrogel may be described as a coagulated colloid with an imbibed liquid phase condensation reactions among the units present in the hydrogels. Any factors which promote or disrupt these reactions affect the structure of the hydrogel and also the structure of the final dried cogel. Cogelification of high silica-containing ASA appears as the best mean to prepare homogeneous amorphous aluminosilcate, which exhibits the strongest Bronsted acidity.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Surface composition of the ASA samples can be inferred from quantification of silanol groups and compared to what is expected from chemical analysis (Figure 1). The results show that surface composition depends on the Si/Al ratio and on the method of preparation. Oxide prepared via impregnation of alumina with silica gel presents a gradient of concentration between bulk and surface since surface Si concentration is greater on than that expected from chemical analysis. By contrast, cogelification favors mixed oxide formation.<br>
An aspect of the present invention provides a catalyst composition comprising a silica-alumina cogel prepared by the method comprising steps of:<br>
(a)	mixing a silicate solution with an aqueous solution of an acid aluminum salt and an<br>
acid, to form an acidified silica sol in said aluminum salt solution, and adjusting said<br>
silica sol/aluminum salt solution mixture to a pH in the range of about 1 to 4;<br>
(b)	slowly adding sufficient base with vigorous stirring, to said acidified silica<br>
sol/aluminum salt solution mixture to form a cogel slurry of silica and alumina, and to<br>
adjust said slurry to a pH in the range of about 5 to 9;<br>
(c)	adjusting the pH of said cogel slurry to about 5-9;<br>
(d)	keeping the cogel solution for overnight.<br>
(e)	recovering a cogelled mass from said slurry;<br>
(f)	washing said cogelled mass;<br>
(g)	adjusting the pH of said cogelled mass to between about 4 and 7h. forming said<br>
combination into particles.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides a catalyst or support for catalysts of homogeneous and amorphous structure, containing silica, alumina having specific surface area of 400-600 m /gm a crystallization temperature greater than or to 600 C. In still another aspect of the present invention said cogelled, silica-alumina matrix is comprised of silica between 10 and 90% by weight.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention said silica is about 60% by weight.<br>
 <br>
In a further aspect of the said base comprises potassium hydroxide.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention said cogelation takes place at ambient temperature for a period of between 1 and 24 hours.<br>
In still another aspect of the present invention cogelification of high silica-containing ASA exhibits the strongest Bransted acidity.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention cogelification of high silica-containing ASA exhibits the strongest Lewis acidity.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention enhanced acid site leads to the use of other reducing gases (eg carbon monoxide) that can be produced by the gasification of fuels (solid, liquid, bio) because we can not afford to use a large amount of expensive hydrogen solely.<br>
In a further more another aspect of the present invention the carbon monoxide can be used with steam (water gas shift reaction) for the production of hydrogen to seat on the active sites.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention high acidic site of this cogel catalyst or support enhance the CO grabbing and therefore facilitate the deoxygenation of the substrate oxygen linkage (hydroxyl, phenolic, epoxy, ether etc.).<br>
The catalyst or the support of the present invention is useful for hydrocracking, hydrodepolymerisation, deoxygenation, reforming, aliphatic unsaturation-reductions etc. of any organic fuel (solid, liquid, biomass).<br>
This ASA cogel catalyst or support shows high Lewis acidic strength and Bronsted acidic strength. Pyridine was first used to characterize the acidic properties of ASAs. Pyridine presents the advantage of giving rise to very distinct vibrationnal bands according to its<br>
 <br>
mode of interaction with the surface. Regarding the site strength, the wavenumber is a good indicator of the Lewis strength.<br>
Carbon monoxide, a week base secondly used to characterize the acidic properties of ASAs. It can coordinate on Lewis acid sites, and if adsorbed at low temperature (-98° C). It can also form a hydrogen bond with acidic-OH groups. Depending on its interaction mode, wave numbers of CO bands can be directly related to the acidic strength of Lewis acid sites or hydroxyl groups. The vibration frequency of CO in interaction with LAS can reach 2230 cm"1 for very strong LAS and shifts down to 2157 cm"1 for very weak LAS. For CO in interaction with acidic OH groups, the CO frequency range is located between 2180 and 2152 cm"1 depending on the OH acidic strength. Thus, discriminating between CO in interaction with LAS from CO in interaction with acidic OH groups is not always staightforward from analyzing the CO stretching frequency zone. A parallel study of CO and OH zone is often necessary to distinguish between CO interaction via coordination or via H bonding. CO in interaction with OH groups of metal oxides or zeolites leads to the formation of H-bond and is proportional to the OH group acidity. Thus, these two values are good indicators of the acidic strength of the OH groups.<br>
Example 1:<br>
A solution of diionised water and of 1M Nitric acid was added to a solution of aluminium nitrate hexahydrate and which had a pH 1.3. The solution was stirred for 10 minutes and had a resultant pH 4. Into a different reaction vessel a solution of sodium silicate in diionised water was prepared. The solution was mixed and kept it for 10 minute and had a result pH 10.1.<br>
The sodium silicate solution was slowly pumped into the solution containing the aluminum nitrate. It took 30 minutes to add the silicate solution; the final solution was clear and had a pH of about 2. The aluminum nitrate solution was stirred vigorously for 10 minutes.<br>
 <br>
A dilute solution of KOH in diionised water was slowly added into the silica-, alumina-, nitric acid solution, with vigorous mixing, until a pH of 8 was reached. It took approximately 35 minutes to add the KOH solution. The Potassium hydroxide solution addition rate must be sufficiently slow to prevent the contents of the vessel from hydrogelling too quickly.<br>
The resulting slurry was stirred for 3 hours and the final pH was readjusted to 8, if necessary. The slurry was filtered at room temperature. The slurry was filtered through Whatman-41 filter paper.<br>
The filter cake was washed with diionised water (DI) for 8 times. The residue on the filter paper was dried in the oven at 100C for over night and finally roasted at 600C in the muffle furnace for about three hours.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Additional cogel catalyst samples were prepared as in Example l.The results are shown in Table I.<br>
Example 3:<br>
Amorphous silica alumina was soaked overnight in 5% solution of cobalt nitrate which was evaporated to dryness followed by heating over a hot plate till most of the N02 was removed. Then it was kept in a furnace at 400C for about an hour. Cobalt oxide was thus deposited on the surface on silica alumina cogel. The solid mass was finally heated at 600C for four hours in a furnace. Cooled mass was then soaked over night in 10% solution of ammonium molybdate. . The previous procedure of evaporation and heating was repeated.<br>
Example 4:<br>
Nickel (5-35%)-Tungstate(7-25%) on silica alumina cogel support was prepared as described in Example 3.<br>
 <br>
Example 5:<br>
Iron (3-25%)-Chromium (4-35%) on silica alumina cogel support was prepared as described in Example 3.<br>
