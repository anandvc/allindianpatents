"ASSEMBLY FOR SUPPORTING THE FLOating roofs OF TANKS FOR STORING LIQUIDS".<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an assembly for supporting the floating roots of tanks  for storing liquid products, particularly petroleum and its derivatives.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Storage tanks arc widely used in the petroleum industry and aw<br>
essentialy to the functioning of an operational unit. They may be intended, for example for storing crudc oil, intermediate products or final products.<br>
Given the highly volatile nature of these products, these storage tank's have a roof  rapable of floating over the stored liquid, as a way of preventing the undeirable accumulation of gases between the layer of liquid and the roof<br>
The floating roof should in no way touch the bottom of the tank, as this would risk causing damage to the installations. It is therefore necessary to limit its travel to prevent it reaching a level which is below a specific minimum height, referred ID by specialists as the "minimum operating height".<br>
On occasions, it is necessary for the floating roof to be stationed at a specific higher level to enable workmen to enter the tank in order to carry out maintenance operations, this height being referred to by specialists as the "maintenance height".<br>
A minimum operating height is established which prevents the rool coming  into contact with the layer of sludge which is generally deposited on the floor of the storage tank. In some situations, this minimum operating height represents 20% of the total height of the storage tank. If the level of liquid stored drops bolow this height  support legs of the roof touch the floor of the tank and prevent the roof from descending further.<br>
These suppoit legs slide inside guides which are rigidly fastened to the floating rool and make it possible to adjust the operating and maintenance heights of<br>
the floating roof. The support legs have at least two transverse orifices which an-intended to receive locking pins. The guides also have orifices for the locking pins In<br><br><br><br><br>
fact that the support legs are in permanent contact with the product being stored throughout the period during which the tank is in operation. This significantly reduces, the service lite of the support legs, owing to the effects of the corrosion to which they<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention proposes the use of an assembly for supporting Moating roofs which requires the use of support legs only when the roof is  in maintenance mode.<br><br><br>
I<br>
Figure 2a is a detail section taken on the line C-C of Figure 2 Figure 3 is a side view of the assembly of Figure 2 which has been<br>
adjusted to operate with the storage tank in operating mode.<br>
Figure 4 is a side view of the assembly of Figure 2 in a position in<br>
which the bottom of the guide is resting on the floor of the tank.<br><br><br>
When the tank 41 is in operation, these support legs 47 have no structural function at all; they only slide inside the guides 45, and only act as element for sealing the longitudinal interior spaces of these guides 45.<br>
in order to place the floating roof 44 in maintenance mode as shown<br><br><br><br>
having been selected in the present embodiment as this is regarded as the most<br><br>
suitable arrangement.The guide 7 acts as a support for the floating roof <br>
4 when the roof has desended as far as the lowest operating position. When such a situation occurs, (he flower end 16 of the guide 7 rests on the floor 6 of the tank, as shown in Figure 4<br><br>
Generally speaking, use is made of reinforcements 2 on the floor 6 at the points where the quide  7 rests, as a way of increasing the strength of the tank floor 6.<br>
Although the assembly for supporting the floating roofs of tanks for slo.ing liquids is composed of the three principal components described above (the guide 7. the looking pin 11 and the support leg 5). the present invention makes it possible. optionally, at times to dispense with use of the support leg, which has a structural function only when the floating roof 4 is in the maintenance mode.<br><br><br>
The flange 20 has dimensions which are greater than those of the orifices 13 and it acts as a stop limiting travel of the locking pin 11 As the stop 14 has dimensions which are greater than the dimensions of the shaft 19, as may be seen in detail in Figure 7a which is a section taken on line A-A of Fig 7, the locking pin 11 is prevented from moving longitudinally in either direction and it then acts as a stop for the support log 5, as may bo seen in Figure 6. enabling the floating roof A to be supported.<br><br><br>
