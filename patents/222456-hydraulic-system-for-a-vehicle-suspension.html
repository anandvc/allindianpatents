				<td>HYDRAULIC SYSTEM FOR A VEHICLE SUSPENSION<br>
The present invention is generally directed to suspension systems for<br>
vehicles, and in particular to a hydraulic system providing control of one or more<br>
suspension parameters.<br>
There are known many alternative interconnected suspension systems<br>
which have the ability to passively differentiate between different modes of wheel<br>
motion with respect to the vehicle body and therefore provide a variety of<br>
alternatives in functionality. For example, the applicant's US patent number<br>
6,270,098 provides a pressure balancing "load distribution" unit between two<br>
pairs of diagonally interconnected double acting wheel rams. This system<br>
provides different heave, roll and pitch stiffness rates with zero warp stiffness and<br>
different damping rates in all four base suspension modes (heave, roll pitch and<br>
warp). This system supports the weight of the vehicle, so as the loads on the<br>
vehicle change, or as the fluid temperature changes, the volume of fluid in each<br>
of the six volumes in the system must be adjusted. Also, as the six volumes in<br>
the system can in some load conditions, all be at different pressures, there is the<br>
possibility for fluid to leak across seals, which also requires fluid volume<br>
adjustments to be made to maintain the correct vehicle attitude. This requires a<br>
high pressure fluid source, sensors, control electronics and valves, making the<br>
cost of the system relatively high for a passive system.<br>
An example of a passive system providing high roll stiffness with low warp<br>
stiffness and negligible heave stiffness and providing high roll damping with<br>
lower, more comfortable and isolating heave damping can be found in the<br>
applicant's PCT/AUOO/00312. As the system does not provide significant heave<br>
stiffness, separate support springs are required.<br>
The support means may provide varying degrees of roll stiffness from<br>
conventional independent support means providing roll stiffness through to<br>
completely interconnected support means providing zero roll stiffness. Details of<br>
examples of support means with varying degrees of roll stiffness that can be<br>
packaged in current vehicle designs are shown in the applicant's US patent No.<br>
6,217,047 and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The variations of support means shown in US 6,217,047 with an anti-roll<br>
bar roll control system are also suitable for use not only with that anti-roll bar<br>
system and with the hydraulic system of PCT/AUOO/00312, but with any roll<br>
control system.<br>
An example of a system having just roll and/or pitch damping can be found<br>
in Yamaha's US patent number 5,486,018 and Kayaba's US6,024,366. The<br>
system in these documents uses a device between a pair of wheel damping<br>
rams, each wheel damping ram having a damper valve in its piston to provide<br>
double-acting damping but make the ram single-acting (i.e. there is only fluid<br>
port). The device provides for independent levels of damping for in-phase (i.e.<br>
heave) and out of phase (i.e. roll and/or pitch) motions. However this system<br>
does not provide significant stiffness in any mode, so in addition to the need for<br>
support springs, generally anti-roll bars will be required for a good balance<br>
between bounce and roll stiffness. Additionally, as the wheel rams are effectively<br>
single acting (having only one fluid port) the amount of damping that the device<br>
can provide is limited. There are improvements made to the system to combat<br>
this problem, which can be found in Japanese patent office publication number<br>
11291737, but these add to the complexity of the system by providing more<br>
plumbing and spool valves.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a hydraulic<br>
system for a vehicle suspension that may overcome at least one of the<br>
disadvantages of earlier vehicle suspension systems.<br>
It js a preferred object of the present invention that the hydraulic system<br>
provide roll stiffness, roll damping, pitch damping and heave damping, all of which<br>
can be designed and tuned substantially independently from each other to enable<br>
optimisation of each parameter.<br>
With this in mind, according to one aspect of the present invention there is<br>
provided a hydraulic system for a vehicle suspension for a vehicle, the vehicle<br>
including a vehicle body and at least two forward and two rearward wheel<br>
assemblies, the vehicle suspension including front and rear resilient vehicle<br>
support means between the vehicle body and the wheel assemblies for resiliency<br>
supporting the vehicle above the wheel assemblies, the hydraulic system<br>
including:<br>
at least two front and two rear wheel rams respectively located between<br>
the wheel assemblies and the vehicle body, each ram including at least a<br>
compression chamber and a rebound chamber;<br>
wherein the compression chamber and rebound chamber of each said<br>
front wheel ram is in fluid communication with the rebound chamber and<br>
compression chamber respectively of a diagonally opposed said rear wheel ram<br>
to respectively provide two fluid circuits, each fluid circuit providing a front and<br>
back compression volume therein, the front compression volume of one said fluid<br>
circuit being in fluid communication with the back compression volume of the<br>
other said fluid circuit, and wherein damping means are provided for damping<br>
fluid flow within each compression volume and between the front and back<br>
compression volumes such that suspension parameters provided by the hydraulic<br>
system can be independently tuned from each other.<br>
The hydraulic suspension system according to the present invention allows<br>
for the independent tuning and design of suspension parameters including roll<br>
stiffness, roll damping, pitch damping and heave damping. This enables<br>
optimisation of as many of these suspension parameters as possible.<br>
The vehicle may be primarily supported -by the resilient vehicle support<br>
means.<br>
The vehicle support means may be any known support means such as coil<br>
springs, air springs, torsion bars, leaf springs and rubber cones. The vehicle<br>
support means can, in the case of coil springs and air springs, be mounted<br>
around the wheel rams or mounted separately.<br>
Additional valves may be provided to block the two fluid circuits for failsafe<br>
and/or wheel lift lockouts.<br>
As the vehicle support means are the primary means of vehicle support, all<br>
of the volumes in the damping and stiffness system can be run at the same<br>
pressure. Also, as the system contains hydraulic fluid and gas, both of which<br>
expand with increasing temperature, a pressure compensation arrangement is<br>
required in order to maintain the system static pressure and roll stiffness within a<br>
design range over the design temperature. This pressure compensation<br>
arrangement can also be used to compensate for any fluid loss over time.<br>
Therefore, there is provided a pressure maintenance device connected to each of<br>
the system volumes through respective restrictions or valves. For example, the<br>
pressure maintenance device may be connected to the left and right compression<br>
volumes.<br>
The accompanying drawings illustrate preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention. Other arrangements are possible, and consequently the<br>
particularity of the accompanying drawings is not to be understood as<br>
superseding the generality of the preceding description of the invention.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Referring initially to figure 1, there is shown a suspension system for a<br>
vehicle. Four wheel rams (11, 12, 13, 14) are located between the vehicle body<br>
(not shown) and four orthogonally disposed wheels (not shown) of the vehicle.<br>
Each wheel ram includes a cylinder (15, 16, 17, 18) connected to a wheel hub or<br>
other suspension geometry to move with the wheel, a piston (10, 20, 21, 22)<br>
slidably housed within the cylinder, and a rod (23, 24, 25, 26) fixed between the<br>
piston and the body of the vehicle. The connection of the rod to the vehicle body<br>
may be by any known means, usually through a rubber bushing which in the case<br>
of MacPherson strut geometry usually includes a bearing.<br>
For ease of understanding, the vehicle resilient support means are shown<br>
as "coil-overs", ie coil springs (27, 28, 29, 30) positioned around the wheel ram<br>
and located between a lower spring plate (31, 32, 33, 34) fixed to the cylinder and<br>
an upper spring plate (35, 36, 37, 38) which may be connected to the vehicle<br>
body or the rod (directly or indirectly such as via a bearing or bushing). It should<br>
be understood that the resilient support means may be of any alternative known<br>
type such as for example air springs and may be located around the cylinder as<br>
shown with the coil springs or separate to the ram, which broadens the<br>
alternatives, for example, to torsion bars connected to the geometry providing<br>
wheel location. Also the wheel ram may be inverted with the cylinder inside an<br>
outer tube, the rod being fixed to the outer tube which in turn supports the lower<br>
spring plate - the upper spring plate then being mounted either to the cylinder or<br>
directly to the body.<br>
The wheel rams shown in the figures are basically conventional doubleacting<br>
rams for simplicity. Taking the front left wheel ram 11 as an example, the<br>
piston 19 (which may be formed as an integral part of the rod 23) has two<br>
grooves containing a bearing 39 and a seal 40. In some cases, the individual<br>
bearing and seal parts can be replaced by a single item (not shown) which may<br>
be bonded to or formed around the piston for ease of assembly and low cost.<br>
The cylinder end (41) has three grooves containing a rod seal 42, a bearing 43<br>
and a rod wiper 44 or other form of secondary seal such as an excluder, Each<br>
ram therefore has a compression chamber (45, 46, 47, 48) and a rebound<br>
chamber (49, 50, 51, 52) formed by the piston (19, 20, 21, 22) within each<br>
cylinder (15,16, 17,18).<br>
The direct damping of each wheel ram can be accomplished by the<br>
provision of compression (53-56) and rebound (57-60) damper valves mounted<br>
on conduits (61-66) close to the compression and rebound chambers of each<br>
wheel ram. These damper valves can be single-acting, working on restricting<br>
fluid flow out of either a compression or a rebound chamber, or they may be<br>
double acting, in which case only one valve (on either the compression or<br>
preferably on the rebound chamber) may be utilised. These damper valves can<br>
be located in the wheel ram body where there is package space, or attached to<br>
the wheel ram body or in the conduits as shown.<br>
The direct damping of each wheel ram may alternatively be accomplished<br>
by the provision of damper valves/arrangements, within each wheel ram.<br>
The four double-acting wheel rams are connected by a pair of diagonal<br>
circuits to provide passive de-coupling of roll and pitch stiffness from heave<br>
stiffness. The first diagonal circuit comprises two fluid volumes, a front left<br>
compression volume and a back right compression volume. The front left<br>
compression volume includes the front left compression chamber 45, a front left<br>
compression conduit 61, a back right rebound conduit 67 and a back right<br>
rebound chamber 51. The back right compression volume similarly includes a<br>
back right compression chamber 47, a back right compression conduit 63, a front<br>
left rebound conduit 65 and a front left rebound chamber 49.<br>
The second diagonal circuit similarly comprises two fluid volumes, a front<br>
right compression volume and a back left compression volume. The front right<br>
compression volume includes the front right compression chamber 46, a front<br>
right compression conduit 62, a back left rebound conduit 68 and a back left<br>
rebound chamber 52. The back left compression volume similarly includes a<br>
back left compression chamber 48, a back left compression conduit 64, a front<br>
right rebound conduit 66 and a front right rebound chamber 50.<br>
This simple diagonal connection arrangement would displace fluid as<br>
follows: in roll and pitch, fluid volumes corresponding to a compression chamber<br>
and the annular rebound chamber of the diagonally opposite wheel ram are<br>
displaced (into or out of any resilient device such as an accumulator); whereas in<br>
heave, only a fluid volume corresponding to a rod volume (compression chamber<br>
minus annular rebound chamber) would be displaced (into or out of the resilient<br>
device). The high relative volume displaced in the roll and pitch modes relative to<br>
heave gives a higher roll and pitch stiffness than heave stiffness.<br>
However the first and second diagonal circuits are connected by first and<br>
second pitch conduits (69, 70). The front left compression volume is-connected<br>
to the back left compression volume by the first pitch conduit (69) forming a left<br>
compression volume and the front right compression volume is connected to the<br>
back right compression volume by the second pitch conduit (70) forming a right<br>
compression volume. The piston seals on the pistons in each wheel ram (11-14)<br>
provide the seal between the left and right compression volumes. If the fluid flow<br>
along the first and second pitch conduits (69, 70) is completely restricted or<br>
blocked, the pitch stiffness of the basic arrangement of the two diagonal circuits<br>
remains, as does the warp stiffness. It should be noted that while the pitch<br>
stiffness is related to the roll stiffness, it is therefore high, but the warp stiffness is<br>
related to the heave stiffness and is therefore low. If there is any flow permitted<br>
along the first and second pitch conduits, then the pitch stiffness is removed, but<br>
damping of the flow along the first and second pitch conduits gives damping to<br>
pitch motions of the hydraulic system and therefore the vehicle. To this end there<br>
is shown, in-line on each of the first and second conduits, a pitch damper valve<br>
(71, 72). This pitch damper valve may be a passive orifice, a passive multi-stage<br>
damper valve or any form of variable damper valve and may even provide for<br>
complete blocking of the pitch conduits. The pitch damper may be a single,<br>
double-acting valve or two single-acting valves and may include a lock-off or<br>
blocking valve or any other known form of controllable restriction. Alternatively,<br>
the pitch damper may be of any known form, such as a simple switched damper<br>
incorporating a switchable bypass around each pitch damper valve or a simple<br>
controlled bleed orifice.<br>
One arrangement for providing resilience in the two volumes (left and right)<br>
is to provide a single accumulator (73, 74) for each volume. In order to provide a<br>
higher amount of roll damping than heave damping, the connection between each<br>
accumulator and the associated volume must include a damper valve. To be able<br>
to tune the front and rear roll damping, a front roll damper valve (75, 76) and a<br>
rear roll damper valve (77, 78) may be provided for each accumulator (73, 74).<br>
These roll damper valves may also be passive or controlled, the control being of<br>
any known form, from a simple switched damper valve to a completely<br>
continuously variable damper valve. The simple switched damper valve may be<br>
of any known type such as a switchable bypass around each roll damper valve or<br>
a simple controlled bleed orifice.<br>
Indeed at every point where there is a damper indicated in the Figure, that<br>
damper valve can be either: a single damper valve having the same<br>
characteristics in both directions; a single valve having different characteristics<br>
from one direction of fluid flow to the other; a single valve having flow restriction<br>
characteristics in one direction and being relatively free-flowing in the opposite<br>
direction; two single-acting valves, one damper valve to control the restriction to<br>
flow in one direction and a second damper valve to control the restriction to flow<br>
in the opposite direction, the two valves being used in parallel, or in series with a<br>
non-return valve in parallel with each valve as is known in conventional damper<br>
valve technology.<br>
The operation of the hydraulic system is basically as follows:<br>
In heave, fluid volumes corresponding to the left and right rod volumes are<br>
displaced into or out of the accumulators. The rod volumes are generally small in<br>
relation to the accumulator gas volumes, so the pressure change in heave is also<br>
small, which acting over the rod areas, provides little change in wheel force.<br>
Therefore the hydraulic system has a very low heave stiffness.<br>
In warp, fluid volumes corresponding to the rod volumes from one diagonal<br>
circuit are passed into the other diagonal circuit through the first and second pitch<br>
conduits (69,70). Therefore the hydraulic system has negligible warp stiffness.<br>
In roll, for example when making a right turn causing the vehicle to roll to<br>
the left, the left compression sealed volume increases in pressure (due to fluid<br>
from the left compression chambers 45, 48 and the right rebound chambers 50,<br>
51 entering the accumulator 73) and the right compression volume reduces in<br>
pressure (due to fluid entering the right compression chambers 46, 47 and the loft<br>
rebound chambers 49, 52 from the accumulator 74) thereby providing the<br>
necessary roll couple.<br>
In pitch, for example when braking, fluid is displaced out of the front ram<br>
compression chambers 45,46 and out of the back ram rebound chambers 51, 52.<br>
This fluid flows through the first and second pitch conduits (69, 70) and is hence<br>
transferred into the expanding rear ram compression chambers 47, 48 and the<br>
front ram rebound chambers 49, 50. As can be readily understood, in braking (or<br>
in any similar direction pitch motion of the wheels with respect to the vehicle<br>
body), fluid flows in this single direction through the first and second pitch<br>
conduits and the pitch damper valves. During pitch motions of the opposite<br>
sense, for example when accelerating, fluid flows in the opposite direction<br>
through the first and second pitch conduits and the pitch damper valves.<br>
Therefore it is preferable to use different damper characteristics for flow in the two<br>
different pitch directions, to thereby give independent control of the braking<br>
direction pitch damping and the acceleration direction pitch damping. This is<br>
obviously desirable as the pitch velocities, accelerations, peak forces and general<br>
requirements (such as trade off between forces for control and comfort) can be<br>
very different in the two directions.<br>
If the vehicle pitches with no change of average height and if the rod<br>
volumes are of equal size front to rear, then there is no net change in fluid volume<br>
in the system (excluding accumulators) so there is no pitch stiffness. However, if<br>
the rod volumes are not matched front to rear for a pure pitch motion, there can<br>
be a small pitch stiffness introduced by the hydraulic system.<br>
Depending on the roll moment distribution of the hydraulic system, the<br>
front and rear chamber volume changes may or may not be matched. If the roll<br>
moment distribution is close to 50% then the pitch damping provided can be of<br>
similar magnitude at both ends of the vehicle. If the roll moment distribution of<br>
the hydraulic system is not 50%, or due to geometry or other effects, the pitch<br>
dampers may produce a larger magnitude of damping force on one end of the<br>
vehicle than the other. The wheel damper valves can be used to compensate for<br>
any difference in front to rear pitch damper effect, especially as this difference is<br>
usually in the same direction as any imbalance in roll damping, which can also be<br>
additionally provide by the wheel damper valves, the hydyraulic system still<br>
providing a better compromise than a conventional suspension system.<br>
So in pitch, the fluid transferred from front to rear along the first and<br>
second pitch conduits (69, 70) passes through the pitch damper valves (71, 72)<br>
thereby providing pitch damping. The fluid can also pass through the front and<br>
rear roll damper valves (75, 77 and 76, 78) which are parallel with the pitch<br>
damper valves (71, 72) and can enter the accumulators (73, 74). The overall<br>
pitch damping provided for a given input is therefore dependent on the flow<br>
restriction and pressure balance between the pitch damper valves, the roll<br>
damper valves and the accumulators.<br>
As the roll moment distribution of the hydraulic system may not match the<br>
roll moment distribution of the suspension system as a whole (due to the coil<br>
spring rates, front to back bushing stiffness differences, etc) it may be necessary<br>
to provide different levels of roll damping on the front wheels compared to the<br>
back wheels. This can be done as shown in figure 1 by using separate front and<br>
rear roll damping valves either side of the pitch damping valve. However, it is<br>
possible on some vehicles to gain additional roll damping at one end of the<br>
vehicle using a simpler arrangement as shown in figure 2.<br>
In figure 2, there is only one roll damper valve (91, 92) for each<br>
accumulator (73, 74). Each accumulator is connected to the respective pitch<br>
conduit (69, 70) through this single roll damper valve and forward of the pitch<br>
damper valve (71, 72) in the pitch conduit. This ensures that the pitch damper<br>
valve (71, 72) acts with the roll damper valve (91, 92) to increase the roll damping<br>
on the back wheel rams (13, 14) in relation to the roll damping provided by only<br>
the roll damper valve (91, 92) acting on the front wheel rams (11,12). This gives<br>
additional roll damping on the rear wheel rams which can be desirable, as<br>
discussed above for figure 1. As with the figure 1 arrangement with a similar roll<br>
damping distribution, it also gives stronger pitch damping to the end of the vehicle<br>
with the highest roll damping from the hydraulic system.<br>
Figure 3 shows another modification to the basic arrangement of figure 1,<br>
Here the accumulators have been moved towards the front wheel rams to reduce<br>
the distance between the front compression chambers and the accumulators,<br>
which can reduce fluid acceleration effects when there is a significant forward<br>
bias in the roll moment distribution of the system. To reduce the distance<br>
between the rear compression chambers (47, 48) and an accumulator, additional<br>
rear accumulators 93, 94 with roll damping valves 95, 96 can be added as shown.<br>
When the rear accumulators are added, it can be preferable to replace the front<br>
accumulator and roll damper in parallel with the pitch damper valve arrangement<br>
shown with the simpler single roll damper and accumulator in front of the pitch<br>
damper valve arrangement from figure 2.<br>
Figure 3 also shows another modification to figures 1 and 2, including a<br>
lockout valve (97, 98) in each of the first and second pitch conduits (69, 70).<br>
When these lockout valves are closed, the operation of the system reverts to that<br>
of two independent diagonal pairs of volumes. The mechanism used to generate<br>
the roll stiffness also now generates a pitch stiffness and the hydraulic system<br>
also has a warp stiffness. The lockout valves can reduce wheel lift, but have the<br>
additional advantage of returning the system to four hydraulic volumes so if there<br>
is a failure - closing the valves should leave 3 volumes operational for a limp<br>
home mode.<br>
Figure 4 shows a further alternative layout of figure 1, although in this<br>
case, the components and their connection sequence is identical to figure 1. The<br>
reference numerals used correspond to the equivalent parts in figure 1. This<br>
shows how changing the direction that the plumbing runs in, but not the<br>
connection sequence, can reduce fluid flows around the hydraulic system to<br>
provide better response. By linking the front wheels with lateral conduits, the fluid<br>
flow paths for the front wheels are generally reduced, especially for a front twowheel<br>
input such as a surface change or expansion joint.<br>
Figure 5 is a further development of figure 4. As the wheelbase of the<br>
vehicle is generally longer than the lateral spacing between left and right wheel<br>
rams, it can be beneficial for the response, cost and weight compromise of the<br>
system to connect the laterally spaced wheels at both the front and rear of the<br>
vehicle to reduce the fluid flow required down the conduits running the length of<br>
the vehicle. Therefore, additional third and fourth pitch conduits (which'are<br>
effectively in parallel with the first and second pitch conduits) have been added to<br>
cross-connect the chambers of the back wheel rams and similarly improve the<br>
rear two-wheel input response of the hydraulic system. The third pitch conduit<br>
101 (which is in parallel with the first pitch conduit 69) connects the back left<br>
compression conduit 64 with the back right rebound conduit 67 via third pitch<br>
valve 103 which has a third accumulator 109 in parallel, with roll damping valves<br>
105, 106 in series with the accumulator 109. Similarly, the fourth pitch conduit<br>
102 (which is in parallel with the second pitch conduit 70) connects the back right<br>
compression conduit 63 with the back left rebound conduit 68 via fourth pitch<br>
damper valve 104 which has a fourth accumulator 110 in parallel. Roll damping<br>
valves 107, 108 are in series with the accumulator 110 as they are in the<br>
arrangements at the front of the vehicle.<br>
A preferred simplification of this system arrangement is shown in Figure 6.<br>
The rear accumulators have been omitted, along with the damper valves which<br>
connected them to the third and fourth pitch conduits 101, 102. Although these<br>
omissions reduce cost, it may not always be practical to size the hydraulic<br>
suspension system for the optimum performance without the rear accumulators<br>
on some vehicles (i.e. some trucks and long wheelbase luxury vehicles).<br>
Also shown in Figure 6 is a pressure maintenance system. As the<br>
hydraulic system is not the primary means of support (ie the coil springs - or air,<br>
torsion, etc. springs provide a large portion of the vehicle support) both of the<br>
volumes in the system (the previously defined (eft and right compression<br>
volumes) can be operated at a common static pre-charge pressure. The<br>
advantage of operating both systems at the same static pre-charge pressure is<br>
that pressure differentials across piston seals throughout the system are<br>
eliminated and so therefore are roll attitude changes caused by fluid leakage<br>
between the systems, and the need for a powered control system which can<br>
pump fluid between the volumes.<br>
The left and right compression volumes are connected via restrictions<br>
(121, 122) to a common conduit or passage 123 which is in turn connected to a<br>
pressure maintenance device 124. Each restriction is typically a micro orifice with<br>
filters either side to prevent blockage, although any known restrictive means may<br>
be used. The orifice is sized to provide the characteristics required to maintain<br>
the pressures in the left and right compression volumes within an acceptable<br>
range whilst preventing significant fluid flow during cornering to maintain the static<br>
roll attitude within an acceptable range when returning to straight line running.<br>
Although the pressure maintenance device 124 may be omitted, changes<br>
in the volumes of fluid and gas in the hydraulic system and its accumulators<br>
through the operating temperature range of the vehicle are usually large enough<br>
to require some form of compensation device. The complexity of this device can<br>
vary significantly, depending on the design parameters and the functionality<br>
required.<br>
In its simplest form, the pressure maintenance device (124) can be a<br>
simple accumulator with any known construction (for example bladder-type with<br>
gas spring, piston-type with gas spring or with mechanical spring).<br>
Alternatively the pressure maintenance device (124) can use a fluid<br>
pressure source (such as a tank with a pump, or another vehicle system such as<br>
the power steering) to maintain the pressure in the hydraulic suspension volumes<br>
to either a fixed or a variable pressure. If a fixed pressure is chosen, the<br>
components required can be simple, cheap, passive, mechanical parts, however<br>
as the system temperature changes, the system stiffness will change slightly. To<br>
maintain the system stiffness characteristics constant with varying temperature,<br>
the pressure in the systems must be adjusted in dependence on their<br>
temperature, which generally requires one or more temperature sensors, at least<br>
one variable pressure switch or pressure transducer and an electronic control<br>
unit.<br>
Also, the roll stiffness of the hydraulic suspension system can be adjusted<br>
by changing the pressure in the systems, so if a pressure maintenance device<br>
(124) with variable pressure set-points is used, the pressure can be varied in<br>
dependence on the load in the vehicle and/or by a driver operated mode selector<br>
or a variable selector.<br>
Obviously, if the pressure maintenance device is designed to provide two<br>
regulated pressures and is connected to the left and right compression volumes<br>
by independent conduits (with or even without restrictions) then the pressures in<br>
the two volumes can be controlled to be different to each other to offset a static<br>
i • •<br>
roll load on the vehicle for example due to an offset payload. Alternatively, or<br>
additionally, active roll control components can be added on to the system to<br>
provide an offset in the passive roll angle of the vehicle during turning, or<br>
completely compensate for all resilience in the hydraulic system and maintain a<br>
zero roll angle. The components (pump, tank, valves, sensors and controllers for<br>
many different algorithms) are all well known.<br>
Figure 7 is a three-dimensional view of the components shown in<br>
schematic form in figure 6. The components are located in their approximate<br>
relative positions as they would be installed on a typical vehicle.<br>
Figure 8 shows a more complex improvement of the hydraulic system.<br>
The front and rear laterally cross-connected arrangements are basically the same<br>
as shown in figure 5. However front to rear lockout valves 131-134 are provided<br>
to allow the front arrangement to and the rear arrangement to operate separately.<br>
When the valves are closed, the hydraulic system provides front and rear roll<br>
stiffness, front and rear roll damping, warp stiffness, pitch damping and low to<br>
negligible heave and pitch stiffness. The valves 131-134 may be used to prevent<br>
free warp motions at undesirable times (i.e. wheel lift). Alternatively or<br>
additionally, the valves may be used to isolate the front and rear arrangements<br>
and form four volumes in the event of a system failure. Additionally or<br>
alternatively, it may be desirable, if some form of active pressure control is<br>
available, to control the front and rear pressures independently, to thereby<br>
influence the roll moment distribution of the hydraulic system and therefore the<br>
dynamic behaviour of the vehicle.<br>
Also shown in Figure 8 is a version of the pressure maintenance system<br>
adapted for use on the system with the valves 131-134 closed forming four<br>
volumes. The front two volumes are connected to the each other through<br>
restrictions 135, 156 and through a passage or conduit 137 to the pressure<br>
maintenance unit 138. The two rear volumes are similarly connected to each<br>
other through restrictions 139, 140 and through a passage or conduit 141 to the<br>
pressure maintenance unit 138. If the valves 131-134 are used as a failsafe, then<br>
the pressure maintenance unit 138 should be equipped to maintain the pressure<br>
in passage 137 independently of maintaining the pressure in passage 141.<br>
Alternatively, an additional pressure maintenance unit (not shown, but ie a simple<br>
accumulator) could be provided for the rear volumes, separate to that for the front<br>
volumes. Alternatively, the pressure maintenance unit could be used to maintain<br>
the pressure in the volumes at only one end of the vehicle (for example being<br>
connected to only the front volumes), then it would maintain the pressure in the<br>
whole system during normal operation when the lockout valves are open and<br>
when the lockout valves have only been closed for brief periods (for wheel lift<br>
limitation), only being unable to maintain the pressure in all four systems in the<br>
event of a failure. Alternatively the pressure maintenance unit could be much<br>
more complex and have individual connections to each of the four volumes (two<br>
front and two rear) for controlling the pressure individually to allow for active or<br>
passive roll attitude correction and/or selectable roll stiffness and roll moment<br>
distribution.<br>
An alternative layout of the system can be seen in Figure 9. This is<br>
essentially the same as the layout in Figure 6, the most significant difference<br>
being the accumulators 73 and 74 and the accumulator damper valves 75, 76, 77<br>
and 78 al all moved rearwards on the vehicle. Instead of the accumulator and<br>
accumulator damper assembly being on the front compression conduits 61 and<br>
62, it has been relocated between the longitudinal conduits 163, 164, 167 and<br>
168. Note that each longitudinal conduit is connected directly to a conduit from a<br>
wheel ram chamber which can be used to denote the conduit, i.e. 167 and 168<br>
are front compression longitudinal conduits being connected directly to the front<br>
compression conduits 61, 62 and the back rebound conduits 67, 68. Similarly,<br>
163 and 164 are back compression longitudinal conduits, being directly<br>
connected to the back compression conduits 63, 64 and the front rebound<br>
conduits 65, 66. This connectivity is equivalent to that of Figure 6, however it has<br>
the benefit of moving the accumulators back to be between the front and rear<br>
wheel rams. It is possible to design the cylinder and conduit sizes such that only<br>
two accumulators are needed on the vehicle with acceptably high system natural<br>
frequencies and response time, but in order to minimise the operating pressure<br>
and conduit diameter, it can be advantageous to position the accumulators at a<br>
position which is a portion of the distance between the front and rear wheels. It<br>
can also be beneficial to package the accumulators under the floor or under the<br>
front foot-well area for example, to free space in the engine bay.<br>
A further alternative layout of the system is shown in Figure 10. While the<br>
basic layout is the same as Figure 9, the accumulator and accumulator damper<br>
positions are different. Four accumulators 73, 74, 109 and 110 are located at the<br>
front and rear, as in Figures 5 and 8. In this case however, the accumulators are<br>
located between the compression chamber of the nearest wheel ram and the<br>
pitch damper, rather than parallel to the pitch damper. In the previous<br>
arrangements, the accumulator dampers were in parallel to the pitch dampers, so<br>
the pitch damping performance was affected by the accumulator dampers,. In the<br>
arrangement in Figure 10 the pitch dampers 71, 72, 103 and 104 are direct acting<br>
and therefore more effective and unaffected by the accumulator dampers. The<br>
accumulator dampers 175, 176, 177 and 178 still damp roll motions more than<br>
any other mode.<br>
Throughout all of the preceding drawings, as already discussed, each<br>
damper valve indicated can be either: a single damper valve having the same<br>
characteristics in both directions; a single valve having different characteristics<br>
from one direction of fluid flow to the other; a single valve having flow restriction<br>
characteristics in one direction and being relatively free-flowing in the opposite<br>
direction; two single-acting valves, one damper valve to control the restriction to<br>
flow in one direction and a second damper valve to control the restriction to flow<br>
in the opposite direction, the two valves being used in parallel, or in series with a<br>
non-return valve in parallel with each valve as is known in conventional damper<br>
valve technology.<br>
Figure 11 shows an alternative arrangement of the hydraulic system. This<br>
alternative arrangement is similar to the other arrangements disclosed, but shows<br>
a modification possible when each damper valve is considered as at least one<br>
single direction restriction, as previously discussed in relation to Figure 1. The<br>
restriction symbol with a non-return valve in parallel, as used in this figure is<br>
commonly used to denote the base valve of a twin tube damper. These base<br>
valves have a valve stack on one side of the damper body and a lightly sprung<br>
intake plate on the other side of the damper body, the intake plate acting as a<br>
non-return valve. The restriction can be of any type such as a simple orifice,<br>
multi-stage, variable or switched.<br>
The modification is to position the accumulator 73, 74,109 or 110 between<br>
two halves of the pitch damper 185 and 186, 187 and 188,189 and 190, or 191<br>
and 192. if all valves used are single-acting, this modification can reduce the<br>
number of valves required, compared to most other arrangements of the hydraulic<br>
system. The active direction of each pitch damper valve 185-192 can be<br>
reversed from that shown if desired. Two accumulator damper valves 193 and<br>
194, 195 and 196, 197 and 198, 199 and 200 are also shown between each<br>
accumulator and the system. It should however be rioted that it is also possible<br>
to use only one accumulator damper valve. For example, if the compression<br>
direction damper valve (193, 195, 197, 199) is omitted, the vehicle height will<br>
temporarily reduce as the vehicle rolls. In Figure 11 as with the previous figures,<br>
jnless lockout valves are provided to separate the system into more than two<br>
cluid volumes, then only two accumulators (one per fluid volume) are necessary.<br>
Lockout valves can be provided in alternative positions to those shown in<br>
Figures 3 and 8. As mentioned previously, the valves can be used in the event of<br>
a detected loss of fluid pressure in one of the fluid volumes, or the fluid pressure<br>
not matching a mapped fluid pressure for the dynamic conditions on a vehicle, ie<br>
in the event of a system failure or malfunction. The valves can also be used<br>
when the dynamic conditions on a vehicle or a combination of for example lateral<br>
acceleration and throttle or brake position are used to indicate that wheel lift is<br>
likely to occur, in which case, the lockout valves can be closed to increase the<br>
stability of the vehicle. For example, the pitch damper valves can either have one<br>
or more lockout valves in series with them (similar to their connection sequence in<br>
Figure 3, so in lines 69, 70, 101 and 102 in Figure 10 for example), or the pitch<br>
damper valves themselves can be switchable or variable valves that can be<br>
controlled to completely block fluid flow through the valve..<br>
An alternative method of changing the roll stiffness of the hydraulic system<br>
is to use additional accumulators which can be connected to the hydraulic system<br>
through switchable lockout valves. This allows for the roll stiffness to be switched<br>
between a high and a low setting. These settings are generally either side of<br>
what would be chosen as a multi-purpose single setting, so that the system can<br>
provide improved handling and control with high stiffness and improved comfort<br>
with low stiffness, as selected or controlled automatically by any known means<br>
(acceleration sensors, throttle and brake sensors, position sensors, etc). An<br>
alternative to hydraulically switching a whole accumulator in and out of the<br>
systems, is to use an accumulator design with two gas volumes, then simpler,<br>
cheaper gas switching valves can be used to vary the gas volumes available to<br>
the systems by switching the lock-out valve to between the two gas volumes to<br>
isolate one of the volumes.<br>
A further alternative method to switch the roll stiffness is to employ<br>
'bridging valves' which connect the two (i.e. the left and right compression)<br>
volumes together. This method can be employed more cheaply (only the bridging<br>
valves are required), but it removes all roll stiffness and the roll damping effect of<br>
the accumulator damper valves from the hydraulic system. Generally, it is<br>
cheapest to connect the bridging valves between the front and/or rear<br>
compression conduits 61 and 62 and/or 63 and 64. A further alternative is to<br>
design a controlled switchable or variable bypass valve into the piston between<br>
the compression and rebound chamber of each wheel ram. As this effectively<br>
short-circuits the system, it reduces fluid flow through the system greatly and can<br>
give the best comfort performance given the low fluid accelerations. Ideally the<br>
control is electronic, sensing steering angle and/or steering velocity, vehicle<br>
speed and lateral acceleration.<br>
Many other obvious alterations to the basic arrangement of the<br>
components whilst maintaining the connection sequence essential for the<br>
functionality of the hydraulic system are considered to fall within the scope of this<br>
application. For example, it is obvious that, in a production design of the system,<br>
it is possible to incorporate not only the wheel damper valves (53-60) into the<br>
main body of the wheel ram, but also the accumulators, roll and pitch valves. For<br>
example, the front left wheel ram may include the wheel damper valves 53 and<br>
57, the accumulator 73, the roll damping valves 75 and 78 and the pitch damping<br>
valve 71.<br><br>
