				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of para nitro toluene. More particularly it relates to the said process using nitric acid over a beta zeolite catalyst. Still more particularly it relates to regioselective nitration of toluene to para-nitrotoluene by vapor phase nitration of toluene using dilute nitric acid over beta zeolite. By the process of present invention para-nitrotoluene has been prepared in high yield in a continuous process without any waste byproduct formation making it an environment friendly process.<br>
Nitrotoluenes are important intermediates in organic synthesis of dyes, perfumes, drugs, pesticides and explosives. Nitrotoluenes are convertible by reduction iiito primary amines, which in turn are valuable intermediates in the synthesis of dyes, Pharmaceuticals, photographic developers and antioxidants.<br>
Conventionally nitrotoluenes are produced by liquid phase reactions employing mixed acids (Nitration Methods and Mechanism, VCH, New York, 1989, pp. 5-15). A sulfuric acid/nitric acid mixture is the most commonly used nitrating agent. Even though the process has the advantage of using cheaper and readily available reactants its main drawbacks are the non-selectivity, low yields, formation of oxidation byproducts because of excess nitric acid, corrosive nature of acid mixture and handling hazards. Large quantity of dilute sulfuric acid is generated as a waste and its disposal or recycle is very expensive. Generation of large amount of dilute sulfuric acid, organic wastes and products oftheir neutralization makes the nitration one of the most environmentally harmful processes.<br>
Other process has been reported wherein use of these acids have been avoided by using nitrogen dioxide/ozone mixture (J. Chem. Soc. Commun, 1049-1050. 1991 Suzuki et.al.), but this process suffers because of powerful nature nitrating agent that selective production ofmononitrated products is difficult.<br><br>
Catalytic vapor phase nitration of toluene with aqueous nitric acid over solid acid catalyst would be an interesting alternative environmental friendly route for the production ofnitrotoluenes, A number of heterogeneous catalysts have been proposed for this process.<br>
In the prior art, vapor phase nitration of aromatic compounds, benzene and toluene at temperature ranging from about 275° C to about 310°C is described in McKee and Wilhelm, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, 28(6), 662-667 (1936) and U.S. Pat. No. 2,109,873. McKee and Wilhelm catalyzed their reaction with silica gel. Bauxite and alumina were reported to be ineffective as catalyst in the vapor phase nitration of toluene. US Patent No. 2,431.585 describes vapor phase nitration of aromatic hydrocarbons at temperature from 130°C to 430°C, using metal metalphosphates of calcium, iron, magnesium and solid supported phosphoric acid catalysts.<br>
Vapor phase nitration of toluene has been described in U.S. pat. No. 4,112,006 where silica and/or alumina-catalyst impregnated with high boiling sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid and optionally with metal salts of such acids is used as catalyst. The reaction is carried out under reduced pressure at temperature from 80 to 180°C.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,966,830, Jpn. Pat. No. 58-157748, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,426,543<br>
describes the nitration of aromatics using zeolite catalysts.  Preliminary screening<br>
studies (D. Vasa.na, D. Malossa, A. Kogelbaur and R. Prins, proceedings of 12th<br>
International zeolite conference 1999) using 65% nitric acid as industrially preferred<br>
nitrating agent confirmed that the zeolites provide a higher para to ortho ratio and<br>
zeolite beta in its proton form showed promising results. Nevertheless, activity and<br>
selectivity   decreased   over   a   period   of five   hours   on   stream   due   to   pore<br>
filling/blockage by strongly adsorbed products/products. The lower conversion of<br><br>
toluene to nitrotoluenes and faster deactivation of zeolite catalysts are the drawbacks of these processes for commercial application.<br>
International patent WO 96/36587 describes a solvent free process for the nitration of aromatic compounds in which the aromatic compound is reacted with nitric acid in presence of an acid anhydride wherein the process is catalyzed by an aluminosilicate catalyst. Nitric acid and acid anhydride react with each other in-situ to form acyl nitrate and this acts as a nitrating agent for aromatic compounds. For example benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, toluene etc. are nitrated to mononitrated compounds. A mixture of orth-meta-para nitrotoluenes is obtained which is then distilled at a pressure of 30mm Hg and a temperature of 30° C to remove acetic acid as a byproduct.<br>
U.S. patent 5,946,638 and European patent 0949240 Al describe nitration of toluene using concentrated nitric acid over ZSM-5 and modified clay catalyst respectively.<br>
These prior art processes for the vapor phase nitration of toluene for the preparation of nitrotoluenes use 65 to 70 % nitric acid which favors the formation of side chain oxidation products. These products deactivate the catalyst, which leads to low conversions, low space time yield, short catalyst life, contamination of the nitrated aromatic hydrocarbon products by undesirable by-products.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of para nitrotoluene in high yield.<br>
Another objective is to provide a process with high selectivity by vapor phase nitration of toluene using dilute nitric acid over beta zeolite catalyst.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of para nitro toluene which comprises reacting toluene in vapor phase in an inert atmosphere characterized in that with dilute nitric acid of concentration in the range of 20 to 30% in a molar ratio of toluene to nitric acid in the range of 1:1 to 4:1 in the presence of beta zeolite catalyst having Si/Al=30 and particle size -10 to +20 mesh, at a temperature in the range of 100 to 300°C, at an atmospheric pressure, at a weight hourly space velocity in the range of 0.1 to 1.0, for a period of at least 4 hours and collecting the para nitro toluene in a receiver having temperature 0-5°C.<br>
In one of the embodiment, the catalyst used is a commercially available beta zeolite in powder form or formulated extrudate form using alumina as a binder.<br>
In another embodiment, strength of dilute nitric acid used as nitrating agent is preferably 20 to 30%.<br>
In another embodiment, the molar ratio of toluene to nitric acid is preferably in the range ofl.5:lto3.5: 1.0.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the reaction temperature used is preferably in the range of 140 to 200°C.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the WHSV (Weight hourly space velocity) is preferably in the range of 0.2 to 0.5.<br>
The vapor phase nitration is carried out in conventional down flow reactor containing inert ceramic packing as preheater and granulated zeolite as a catalyst. Toluene and dilute HNO3 are fed to the reactor using syringe pumps along with a carrier gas. The product is condensed and collected in a container and washed with alkali and then analyzed by gas chromatograph after extraction with diethyl ether.<br><br>
