				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an immune-modulating peptide. The formyl peptide receptor family (formyl peptide receptor (FPR) and formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1)) that is expressed in phagocytic cells such as neutrophils and monocytes plays an important role in host defense against pathogen infection (1, 2). The receptors have been known to couple with pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi proteins (1, 2). Activation of FPR induces dissociation of Gpy subunits from Gai subunits, and the Py-subunits mediate the activation of phospholipase CP or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (1, 2). Activation of these effect molecules induces complicated downstream signaling leading to diverse cellular responses such as chemotactic migration, degranulation, and superoxide generation.<br>
Most full agonists induce a lot of complicated cellular signaling that evokes eventual complex immune responses. Among the immune responses, many of them are essentially required for the proper functioning of host cells to clear out invading pathogens, but some responses are unwanted side effects in immune responses. In the area of drug development, it has been a hot issue to reduce or remove the side effects of drug candidates. To obtain this objective. many research groups have tried to develop selective immune response modulators or selective antagonists for specific receptors via several approaches (3, 4).<br>
A variety of agonists for FPR have been identified from endogenous<br>
sources or artificial synthesis (1, 2). They include bacterial peptides (N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF)), HIV-envelope domains (T20 and T21), and host-derived agonists (Annexin I and AJ342) (5-7). Previously, the inventors of the present invention reported a synthetic peptide ligand, Trp-Lys-Tyr-Met-Val-D-Met-NH2 (hereinafter, referred to as "WKYMVm") that stimulates leukocytic cells such as monocytes and neutrophils (8-11). Le et al. demonstrated that WKYMVm binds to formyl peptide receptor (FPR) and formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1) (12). Since WKYMVm is a short peptide with a high affinity for a broad spectrum of receptors, it can be a useful material for the study of FPR- or FPRL1 -mediated signaling. However, research to develop selective immuno-modulators or selective antagonists for specific receptors, as well as screening of molecular diversity, consists of small compounds and thus far has been very limited, and therefore there are continuing demands for identifying novel compounds.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Formyl   peptide   receptor  (FPR)   and   formyl   peptide   receptor-like   1<br><br>
(FPRL1)  perform   an  important role  in  immune  responses.     The  present invention  provides  peptides derived from WKYMVm.     Many peptides  can stimulate FPR or FPRL1 resulting in calcium increase, but the peptides of the present invention such as WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1), WKRMVm (SEQ ID NO: 11),  and  6th  D-Met substituted  peptides  effect  a  calcium  increase just in FPRL1-expressing cells but not in FPR-expressing cells.    A competition assay using 125l-WKYMVm shows that not only do many peptides effect a calcium increase in FPR-expressing cells, but WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1), WKRMVm (SEQ ID NO: 11), and 6th D-Met substituted peptides can also compete the binding of 125l-WKYMVm to FPR.   Unlike a phospholipase C-mediated calcium increase, WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1), WKRMVm (SEQ ID NO: 11), and 6th D-Met substituted peptides can stimulate extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and   Akt   activation   in   FPR-expressing   cells.       Regarding   the   functional consequences of WKYMVm, the peptide stimulates degranulation and cellular chemotaxis via Ca2+ and  ERK pathways,  respectively,  in  FPR cells.    The peptides such as WKGMVm, WKRMVm, and 6th D-Met substituted peptides, however, stimulated FPR cells by just inducing chemotactic migration but not degranulation.     Taken  together,  it  is  demonstrated   that  as   an   important chemoattractant receptor, FPR can be modulated differentially by distinct peptide ligands in a ligand-specific manner, for the first time.<br>

Fmoc amino acids were obtained from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Rapidamide resin was purchased from Dupont (Boston, MA). Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) separation medium (Histopaque-1077), cytochrome c, and fMLF were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Fura-2 pentaacetoxymethylester (fura-2/AM) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). RPMI 1640 was obtained from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY).

RPMI1640 was obtained from Invitrogen Corp. (Carlsbad, CA). Dialyzed<br>
fetal bovine serum and supplemented bovine serum were acquired from Hyclone<br>
Laboratories	Inc.	(Logan,	UT).	CpG	ODN<br>
(S'-TCGTCGTTTTGTCGTTTTGTCGTT-S' with wholely phosphorothioate backbone) was synthesized by Genotech Inc. (Daejon, Korea)<br>
Tumor cell line preparation<br>
CT26, EL4 were maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5 % C02 atmosphere in RPMA1640 medium supplemented with 20 % (vol/vol) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. For animal experiments, the cells were passaged two to five times after re-growth from frozen stocks. Log phase CT26 cells were detached from tissue culture flasks with 0.25% trypsin and 0.03% EDTA.. CT26 and EL4 were washed and resuspended in PBS immediately before injection.<br>
Animal experiments<br>
Specific pathogen free male Balb/c mice and C57/BL6 mice were purchased from Hyo Chang Bioscience (Taegu, Korea). All mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in the animal facility of the Immunomodulation Research Center, University of Ulsan, Korea and used at 6-8 week of age. CT26 and EL4 were injected s.c. to Balb/c mice and C57/BL6 mice respectively, on day 0. WRYMVm (SEQ ID NO: 4) and CpG ODN were administered systemically (i.p.; 200 fd) from day six for every 4 days while a control group received PBS or 100 /zg/mice for CpG ODN.    Vincristine was administered via<br>
i.p. injection on the same days just before 8 hours from peptide or CpG ODN injection. On every 2 days after inoculation, tumor mass was measured using digital Varier calipers. Tumor volumes were calculated as [length x width x height x JI /6]. The date of death is recorded as the date when mice spontaneously<br>
succumbed to tumor or were sacrificed because of a moribund state, or when the tumor width measured 20 mm (a width at which the tumor is not going to regress).<br>

Example 1: Isolation of neutrophils<br>
Peripheral blood leukocyte concentrates were donated by the Ulsan Red Cross Blood Center (Ulsan, Korea). Human neutrophils were isolated according to the standard procedures of dextran sedimentation, hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes, and a lymphocyte separation medium gradient as described above (9).    The isolated human neutrophils were then used promptly.<br>
Example 2: Effect of peptides on superoxide generation in human neutrophils<br>
The activity of the peptides, WKYMVm, peptides of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 24,<br>
and wkymvm on superoxide generation in human neutrophils was measured. Superoxide anion generation was quantified by measuring reduction of cytochrome c using a microtiter 96-well plate ELISA reader (Bio-Tekinstruments,<br>
EL312e, Winooski, VT) as described (14). The human neutrophils (1 x 106 cells/100 pi of RPMI 1640 medium per well of a 96-well plate) were preincubated with 50 uM cytochrome c at 37°C for 1 min and then incubated with the indicated concentrations of peptides. The superoxide generation was measured as a change in light absorption at 550 nm over 5 minutes at 1 min intervals. From at least four independent experiments, peptides with active amino acids at each position were chosen.   These results are shown in Table I.<br>
Stimulation of neutrophils with various concentrations of the peptide, WKYMVm caused superoxide generation in a concentration-dependent manner, showing the maximal activity with 100 nM of the peptide (data not shown). While some of the peptides such as WRYMVm (SEQ ID No: 4), WEYMVm (SEQ ID No: 5), WKFMVm (SEQ ID No: 13), and KYMVm (SEQ ID No: 21) stimulated superoxide generation in the cells, many of the peptides were weaker regarding activity on superoxide generating activity with 100 nM of peptides.<br>

 Superoxide generation was measured by monitoring cytochrome c reduction. b The concentration of the treated peptide was 100 nM.<br>
The effect of the peptides on superoxide generation with a 10 pM concentration was also measured. The results are shown in Table II. All of the peptides except wkymvm stimulated superoxide generation as potent as WKYMVm with a 10 uM concentration. Among the peptides, WKWMVm (SEQ ID NO: 10), WKFMVm (SEQ ID NO: 13), and WKYMVW (SEQ ID NO: 19) showed more potent activity than WKYMVm.<br>

Example 3: Effect of the peptides on [Ca2+]j increase in FPR- or in FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells<br>
The activity of the peptides, WKYMVm, peptides of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 24,<br>
and wkymvm on [Ga2t]j-increase was measured in FPR-expressing RBL-2H3<br>
cells.    FPR-expressing RBL-2H3 cells were stimulated with  10 uM of each<br>
peptide, and [Ca2+]j was determined. The level of [Ca2+]i was determined fluorometrically by Grynkiewicz's method using fura-2/AM (15). Briefly, prepared cells were incubated with 3 uM fura-2/AM at 37°C for 50 min in a fresh serum-free RPMI 1640 medium under continuous stirring.    2 x 106 cells were<br>
aliquoted for each assay in Ca "free Locke's solution (154 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM KCI, 1.2 mM MgCI2, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 10 mM glucose, and 0.2 mM EGTA). Fluorescence changes at the dual excitation wavelengths of 340 nm and 380 nm and the emission wavelength of 500 nm were measured, and the calibrated fluorescence ratio was translated into [Ca2+]i.. The peak level of the increased [Ca2+]j was monitored.    The results are shown in Table 111 and Fig 1 A.    Data are<br>
representative of three independent experiments.<br>
Table III. Effect of peptides on intracellular calcium increase in FPR-expressing RBL-2H3 cells3<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Intracellular calcium increase was monitored from fura-2 loaded cells.<br>
in FPR-expressing RBL-2H3 cells, the peptide WKYMVm induced a [Ca2+li increase in a concentration-dependent manner, showing maximal activity around 300 nM (data not shown). EC5o of the WKYMVm for [Ca2+]rincreasing activity in FPR cells was 47 nM (Table III). Among the peptides of the present invention, while WHYMVm, WKWMVm (SEQ ID NO: 10), and WKFMVm (SEQ ID NO: 13) showed more improved affinity for the FPR against the peptide WKYMVm, the other peptides were not as active as WKYMVm (Table III). In particular, WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1), WKYMGm (SEQ ID NO: 2), and 6th D-Met substituted peptides did not effect a [Ca2+]j increase until 20 uM treatment in<br>
FPR-expressing RBL-2H3 cells (Table III and Fig. 1A). N-terminal- or C-terminal-truncated peptides are also inactive for the [Ca2+]j increasing activity in FPR cells (Table III). These results suggest that Tyr3 and D-Met6 are critical for the activation of FPR in [Ca2+]j increase.<br>
The effect of the peptides, WKYMVm, peptides of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 24, and wkymvm on [Ca2+]j increase was checked in FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells. FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells were stimulated with 10 uM of each peptide, and [Ca2+]j was determined.   The level of [Ca2+]i was determined by the<br>
same procedures  as  above. The peak level  of the  increased  [Ca2+]j was<br>
monitored. The results are shown in Table IV and Fig. 1B. Data are representative of three independent experiments.<br>
In FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells, WKYMVm showed maximal activity with a 10 nM concentration (data not shown). EC50 of the WKYMVm for [Ca2+]j-increasing activity in FPRL1 cells was 0.6 nM (Table IV). Unlike in FPR cells, all the peptides were active on [Ca2+]Hncreasing activity in FPRL1 cells (Table IV). Some of the peptides, such as WRYMVm (SEQ' ID NO: 4), WKWMVm (SEQ ID NO: 10), WKFMVm (SEQ ID NO: 13), WKYMYm (SEQ ID NO: 14), and WKYM(F/W)m (SEQ ID NO: 15), showed a higher affinity to FPRL1 (Table IV). WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1), WKYMGm (SEQ ID NO: 2), and 6th ) D-Met-substituted peptides that could not effect a [Ca2+]j increase in FPR cells also showed [Ca2+]Hncreasing activity in FPRL1 cells, with a little lower affinity to FPRL1 (Table IV and Fig. 1B).    N-terminal or C-terminal truncated peptides also<br>
stimulated a [Ca2+]j increase in FPRL1 cells (Table IV). These results indicate that Tyr3 and D-Met6 are less critical for the activation of FPRL1 against FPR resulting in a [Ca2+]j increase.<br>

 Intracellular calcium increase was monitored from fura-2 loaded cells.<br>
Example 4: Effect of the peptides on [li£tTJ WKYMVm binding to FPR<br>
or FPRL1<br>
From the finding that some of the peptides (WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1), WKRMVm (SEQ ID NO: 11), D-Met6 substituted peptides) could not induce a cytosolic calcium increase, it was checked whether the peptides can bind to FPR or not. Displacement of 125l-Iabeled WKYMVm binding to FPR or FPRL1 by the peptides was monitored. FPR-expressing RBL-2H3 cells were incubated with [125l] WKYMVm in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled WKYMVm or the peptides of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 24.<br>
A ligand binding analysis was performed as modified from the previous report (16). The radioiodinated WKYMVm (125l-labeld) was purchased from NEN Lifesciences (Boston, MA). Briefly, FPR- or FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells were seeded into 1X105 cells per well of a 24-well plate and cultured overnight. After blocking the cells with a blocking buffer (33 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% BSA in RPMI) for 2 hr, a single concentration of 125l-labeld WKYMVm was added to cells with a binding buffer (PBS containing 0.1% BSA) in the absence or presence of 50 uM unlabelled peptides and incubated for 3 hr at 4°C with continuous shaking. Then the samples were washed 5 times with ice-cold binding buffer, and 200 pi of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100) was added to each well. After 20 min of lysis at room temperature, the lysates were collected. Bound 125l-labeld WKYMVm was measured for radioactivity for a y-ray counter.<br>
Ligand binding analysis results are shown in  Figs. 2A and 2B  (2A:<br>
FPR-expressing   RBL-2H3  cell,  2B:  FPRL1-expressing   RBL-2H3  cell).     As<br>
shown in Figs. 2A and 2B, not only unlabeled WKYMVm but also WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1), WKRMVm (SEQ ID NO: 11), and D-Met6 substituted peptides of WKYMVm inhibited binding of [125l] WKYMVm in a concentration-dependent manner. These results indicate that although WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1), WKRMVm (SEQ ID NO: 11), or D-Met6-substituted peptides of WKYMVm could bind to FPR, all the peptides could not induce cytosolic calcium increase in FPR-expressing RBL cells.<br>
Example 5: Effect of the peptides on ERK phosphorylation in FPR or RPRL1 expressing RBL-2H3 cells i) Stimulation of Cells with Peptides<br>
Cultured RBL-2H3 cells were aliquoted into 2 X 106 cells and stimulated with the indicated concentrations of WKYMVm and the peptides of the present invention for the indicated lengths of time. FPR- or FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells were stimulated with 1 uM WKYMVm for various periods of time (Fig. 3A). Two cells were preincubated with a vehicle or 100 ng/ml of PTX (24hr), 50 uM of LY294002 (15 min), 5 pM of GFX (15 min), 10 pM BAPTA/AM (60min), or 50 pM PD98059 (60 min) prior to 1 pM of WKYMVm treatment (Fig. 3B). FPR- or FPRL1-expressing RBL2H3 cells were stimulated with 10 pM of )     the peptides of the present invention for 2 min or 5 min, respectively (Fig. 3C).<br>
After stimulation, the cells were washed with serum-free RPMI and lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 150 mM NaCI, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3V04, 10 ug/ml leupeptin, 10 pg/ml aprotinin, and 1<br>
mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The detergent-insoluble materials were pelleted by centrifugation (12,000 X g, 15 min, at 4°C), and the soluble supernatant fraction was removed and stored at -80°C or used immediately. Protein concentrations in the lysates were determined using the Bradford protein assay reagent.<br>
ii) Electrophoresis and Immunoblot Analysis<br>
Each sample (30 g of protein) was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and<br>
phosphorylated ERK was determined by an immunoblot analysis with an<br>
anti-phospho-ERK     antibody.	Protein     samples     were     prepared     for<br>
electrophoresis by addition of a concentrated sample buffer. The portions in the samples were then separated by an 10% SDS-polyacryiamide gel using the buffer system described by Laemmli (17).<br>
Following the electrophoresis, a western blot analysis with an anti-ERK2 antibody was performed to confirm that the same amounts of samples were used for the experiments. The proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose membranes were then blocked by incubation with TBS (Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween-20) containing 5% non-fat dry milk. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with anti-phospho-ERK antibody, anti-phospho-Akt antibody or anti-Akt antibody washed with TBS. For a PKC translocation assay, an antibody for PKC isozyme-specific was incubated. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized after incubating the membrane with a 1:5000 diluted goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG antibody coupled to<br>
horseradish peroxidase and using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system.<br>
Mi) Results<br>
The effect of the peptides on cellular signaling via FPR or RPRL1 in FPR- or FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells was evaluated, and the results are shown Figs. 3A to 3C. Results of Figs. 3A to 3C are representative of 3 independent experiments.<br>
Since, although some peptides could bind to FPR, they could not stimulate a PLC-mediated calcium increase, their effect on other signaling (ERKs and Akt) that are independent on PLC in the downstream of some GPCRs was checked. Stimulation of FPR- or FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells with 1 uM WKYMVm induced transient activation of ERKs showing the maximal activity in 2 min or 5 min after peptide treatment, respectively (Fig. 3A). When FPR- or FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells were pretreated with several inhibitors prior to WKYMVm stimulation, WKYMVm-induced ERKs activation was sensitive to PTX, and PD98059 indicatingthat this event is PTX-sensitive G-protein(s) and MEK-dependent (Fig. 3B). Pretreatment of a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002), PKC inhibitors (GF109203X or Ro-31-8220), or a calcium chelator (BAPTA/AM) could not effect WKYMVm-induced ERK activation (Fig. 3B). This suggests that this event is independent on PI3K, Ca2+, and PKC activation. So it appears as if WKYMVm induces a [Ca2+]i increase and ERK activation via independent signaling pathways. The effect of the peptides of the present invention on ERK activation  was  checked  by Western  blot  analysis  with  anti-phospho-ERKs<br>
antibody. Unlike cytosolic calcium increasing activity, the peptides (WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1), WKRMVm (SEQ ID NO: 11), WKYMVR (SEQ ID NO: 18), and WKYMVE (SEQ ID NO: 16)) stimulated ERKs phosphorylation in FPR-expressing RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 3C). Keeping in mind that the peptides could not affect on PLC-mediated [Ca2+]i increasing activity, this is a very interesting result. When FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells were stimulated with WKYMVm and the peptides of the present invention, most of the peptides also caused ERKs phosphorylation in FPRL1 cells (Fig. 3C). This result correlates with the previous result that all of the peptides can stimulate a cytosolic calcium increase in FPRL1-expressing cells (Fig. 1B).<br>
Example 6: Effect of the peptides on Akt phosphorylation in FPR- or RPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells<br>
It is well known that activation of chemoattractant receptors induces Akt activation via PI3K (19). Stimulation of cells with the peptides, electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis were performed according to the same method as in Example 5,<br>
FPR- or FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells were stimulated with 1 pM WKYMVm for various periods of time (Fig. 4A). Two cells were preincubated with a vehicle or 100 ng/ml of PTX (24hr), 50 uM of LY294002 (15 min), 5 uM of GFX (15 min), 10 pM BAPTA/AM (60min), or 50 uM PD98059 (60 min) prior to treatment with 1 uM of WKYMVm (Fig. 4B). FPR- and FPRL1-expressing RBL2H3 cells were stimulated with 10 pM of WKYMVm and the present peptides<br>
for 2 min or 5 min, respectively (Fig. 4C). Each sample (30 ug of protein) was subjected to 10 % SDS-PAGE and phosphorylated Akt was determined by immunoblot analysis with an anti-phospho-Akt antibody. A western blot analysis with an anti-Akt antibody was performed to confirm that the same amounts of samples were used for the experiments. The results are shown Figs. 4A to 4C. Results of Figs. 4A to 40 are the representative of 3 independent experiments.<br>
It was observed that WKYMVm stimulation induced Akt phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner in FPR- and FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 4A). WKYMVm-induced Akt phosphorylation was sensitive to PTX, LY294002 but not to GFX and BAPTA/AM, indicating PTX-sensitive G-proteins(s) and PI3K-dependency (Fig. 4B). Stimulation of FPR-expressing RBL-2H3 cells not only with WKYMVm but also with the present peptides (WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1), WKRMVm (SEQ ID NO: 11), WKYMVE (SEQ ID NO: 16), and WKYMVR (SEQ ID NO: 18)) caused Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 40). WKYMVm and the present peptides also stimulated Akt phosphorylation in FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 40). These results correlate with ERKs phosphorylation by the peptides in two types of cells (Fig. 30). Since WKYMVm-induced ERKs and Akt activation were mediated by PI3K activation, it appears as if (WKGMVm ) (SEQ ID NO: 1), WKRMVm (SEQ ID NO: 11), WKYMVE (SEQ ID NO: 16), and WKYMVR (SEQ ID NO: 18)) successfully induce PI3K-mediated signaling in the downstream of FPR.<br>
Example 7: Effect of the peptides on exocytosis.<br>
Granule secretion is one of the most important function of mast cells (20). The effect of WKYMVm on granule secretion was checked by measuring P-hexosaminidase secretion as described above (18).    Briefly, RBL-2H3 cells (2 x 105 / well) expressing FPR or FPRL1 were cultured overnight in a 24-well tissue culture plate.   The cells were washed twice with Tyrode's buffer (137 mM NaCI, 12 mM NaHC03, 5.6 mM glucose, 2.7 mM KCI, 1 mM CaCI2, 0.5 mM MgCI2, 0.4 mM NaH2P04, 0.1g/100 ml BSA, and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) and stimulated with each peptide. Various concentrations of WKYMVm were treated in FPR- or FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 5A).    1 uM of WKYMVm was used to stimulate two cell lines in the absence or presence of 10 uM BAPTA/AM (Fig. 5B).   The reaction was terminated 20 min after stimulation by placing the plate on ice.   Secretion of p-hexosaminidase into the medium was determined by  incubating   50   ul   of  supernatant  or  cell  iysate  with   25   ui   of  5   mM p-nitrophenyl-/V-acetyl-p-D-glucosamide in 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer (pH 3.8) at 37°C for 2 hr.   At the end of the incubation, 50 pi of 0.4 M Na2C03 were added. Absorbance was monitored at 405 nm.   The results are shown in Figs. 5A and 5B.    Data are means ± S.E. of a single representative of three experiments performed in triplicate.   Values (means ± S.E.) were expressed as a percent of total p-hexosaminidase present in the cells.<br>
Stimulation of FPR- or FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells with various concentrations of WKYMVm caused P-hexosaminidase release in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5A).    The maximal activity was shown<br><br>
with 100 nM or 10 nM peptide stimulation in FPR- or FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells, respectively (Fig. 5A). It has been reported that cytosolic calcium increase is critical for the secretion of granules in mast cells such as RBL-2H3 (18, 20). It is also confirmed that chelation of intracellular calcium by BAPTA/AM treatment prior to the peptide stimulation almost completely inhibited WKYMVm-induced granule secretion (Fig. 5B).<br>
From the new finding that cytosolic calcium release was induced by WKYMVm and many of the substituted peptides of WKYMVm but not by some of them (WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1), WKRMVm (SEQ ID NO: 11), D-Met6 substituted peptides), the effect of the peptides on granule secretion in RBL cells was checked. 10 uM of each peptide was treated in FPR- (Fig. 6A) or FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 6B). The peptide-induced secretion of B-hexosaminidase was determined as above. Data are means ± S.E. of a single representative of three experiments performed in triplicate.<br>
When FPR cells were stimulated with peptides (WKYMVm, WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1), WKRMVm (SEQ ID NO: 11), WKYMVE (SEQ ID NO: 16), WKYMVR (SEQ ID NO: 18)), granule secretion was observed with some substituted peptides, except WKGMVm-, WKRMVm-, and D-Met6-substituted peptides (Fig. 6A). The WKGMVm- (SEQ ID NO: 1), WKRMVm-(SEQ ID NO: ) 11), and D-Met6-substituted peptides could not effect granule secretion in FPR-expressing RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 6A). These results absolutely correlate with the previous results that WKGMVm-(SEQ ID NO: 1), WKRMVm-(SEQ ID NO:  11) and D-Met6-substituted peptides could not induce cytosolic calcium<br>
release (Fig. 1A). Unlike in FPR-expressing RBL-2H3 cells, all the peptides (WKYMVm, WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1), WKRMVm (SEQ ID NO: 11), WKYMVE (SEQ ID NO: 16), WKYMVR (SEQ ID NO: 18)), but not fMLF or wkymvm, stimulated granule secretion in FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 6B). It is also perfectly correlated with the previous results that the peptides stimulated cytosolic calcium increase in FPRL1 -expressing RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 1B).<br>
Example 8: Effect of peptides on cellular chemotaxis<br>
Chemotaxis assays were performed using multiwell chambers (modified Boyden chamber assay) (Neuroprobe Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) (18).    Briefly, polycarbonate filters (8 urn pore size) were precoated with 50 ug/mi of rat type I collagen (Collaborative Biomedicals) in a HEPES-buffered RPMI 1640 medium. A dry coated filter was placed on  a 96-well  chamber containing  different concentrations of peptides.    RBL-2H3 cells expressing FPR or FPRL1 were suspended in RPMI at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells / ml of serum-free RPMI, and 25 ul of the suspension were placed onto the upper well of the 96-well chemotaxis chamber.   After incubation for 4 hours at 37°C, non-migrated cells were removed by scraping them out, and cells that migrated across the filter were dehydrated, fixed, and stained with hematoxylin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). )     The stained cells in five randomly chosen high power fields (HPFj (400 X) in that well were then counted.    Fig. 7A shows the results of the chemotaxis assay. The vehicle, 50 uM LY294002 (15 min), and 50 uM PD98059 (60 min) pretreated cells were subjected to the chemotaxis assay with 1  uM WKYMVm, and the<br>
results are shown in Fig. 7B. The numbers of migrated cells were determined by counting them in a high power field (400x). The Data are presented as means ±SE of three independent experiments each performed in duplicate.<br>
It has been reported that WKYMVm can induce chemotactic migration of phagocytic cells such as monocytes and neutrophils (11). Le et al. demonstrated WKYMVm-induced cellular chemotaxis via binding to FPR and FPRL1 (12). As expected, WKYMVm showed chemotactic migratory activity showing bell-shape concentration-dependency in FPR- or FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 7A). The WKYMVm-induced cellular chemotaxis was sensitive to LY294002 and PD98059 (Fig. 7B). The results suggest that WKYMVm-induced cellular chemotaxis is PI3K- and MEK-dependent WKYMVm stimulates chemotactic migration of FPR- or FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells via PI3K and MEK activity.<br>
The effect of the peptides of the present invention on cellular chemotaxis in FPR- or FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells was measured. Various concentrations of each peptide were used for the chemotaxis assay with FPR- or FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells. The numbers of migrated cells were determined by counting them in a high power field (400x). The Data are presented as means ± SE of two independent experiments each performed in duplicates.<br>
In FPR-expressing RBL-2H3 cells, not only WKYMVm, but also the substituted peptides (WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1), WKRMVm (SEQ ID NO: 11), WKYMVE (SEQ ID NO: 16), and WKYMVR (SEQ ID NO: 18)) induced cellular<br>
chemotaxis (Fig. 8A). The concentrations needed for chemotaxis by the substituted peptides are higher than by WKYMVm (Fig. 8B). On the signaling pathways involved in substituted peptides-induced chemotaxis, the involvement of PI-3 kinase and MEK-mediated signaling was tested. When FPR-expressing RBL cells were pretreated with LY294002 or PD98059, the WKYMVm and the substituted peptides-induced RBL cell migration was almost completely inhibited (Fig. 7B and data not shown). In FPRL1-expressing RBL-2H3 cells, WKYMVm and the peptides (WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1), WKRMVm (SEQ ID NO: 11), WKYMVE (SEQ ID NO: 16), and WKYMVR (SEQ ID NO: 18)) also induced cellular chemotaxis showing concentration-dependency (Fig. 8B).<br>
In the present invention, it is demonstrated that FPR can be modulated by distinct ligands leading to differential cellular signaling and functional consequences, for the first time. To demonstrate the ligand-specific modulation of FPR, the diverse peptides, a potent ligand for FPR were generated as listed in Table I. Among the peptides, WKGMVm-(SEQ ID NO: 1), WKRMVm-(SEQ ID NO: 11), and D-Met6-substituted peptides bind to FPR, just inducing PI-3 kinase-mediated Akt and MEK-mediated ERK activation resulting in chemotactic migration of the cells. These peptides could not effect a cytosolic calcium increase. Since the peptide WKYMVm stimulates not only ERKs activation but also cytosolic calcium increase leading to chemotaxis and degranulation, it can be suggested that FPR can be differentially modulated by distinct ligands.<br>
Recently, several reports have demonstrated that some GPCRs could be modulated   by  distinct  ligands  (21,   22).     In  the   process   of ligand-specific<br>
modulation of GPCR, a different ligand has been suggested to induce distinct conformational change of the receptor and induce selective coupling of the receptor with certain effector molecules or G-proteins.    In Table III and Fig. 1A, it is demonstrated that that WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1), WKRMVm (SEQ ID NO: 11),  and  D-Met6  substituted  peptides  could  not stimulate a  PLC-mediated cytosolic calcium increase in FPR-expressing RBL-2H3 cells.    However, these peptides stimulated ERKs and Akt phosphorylation in FPR-expressing RBL-2H3 cells  (Fig.  3C).     In  the WKYMVm  and  the  present peptide-mediated  cell signaling, a cytosolic calcium increase is induced by the hydrolysis of PI through PLC-0 activation, but ERK and Akt phosphorylation is mediated by the activation of MEK and PI3 kinase, respectively.    Keeping in mind these results, it appears as if binding of a peptide ligand to FPR induces a conformational change of FPR, and   the   conformation   change   offers   the   coupling   of  the   receptor   with G-protein-mediated PLC-f3 or G-protein-mediated PI-3 kinase.    Since some of the  present  peptides  that  could   not  induce  a   cytosolic  calcium   increase (WKGMVm  (SEQ   ID   NO:   1), WKRMVm  (SEQ  ID  NO:   11),   and  D-Met6 substituted   peptides)   could   stimulate   ERKs   phosphorylation   via   the   PI-3 kinase-dependent pathway, it appears as if the peptides bind to FPR and induce a   conformational   change   needed   for   the   activation   of   PI-3   kinase   and MEK-mediated signaling, resulting in chemotactic migration of RBL-2H3 cells.<br>
Two different receptors of the formyl peptide receptor family, FPR and FPRL1, have been reported to serve important roles in innate immune responses (1, 2).    Until now, several different ligand origins including the formyl peptide<br>
lipoxin A4 have been reported to bind FPR or FPRL1 (1).    Le et al. reported that WKYMVm could bind to FPR and FPRL1 (12).<br>
In the present invention, the inventor demonstrated that substitution of Tyr3 or D-Met6 with other amino acids abolished PLC-mediated cytosolic calcium-increasing activity of FPR but not of FPRL1 (Fig. 1). This result indicates that Tyr3 and D-Met6 are critical for the activation of PLC by FPR but not by FPRL1. From this result it can be deduced that the ligand-binding site of FPR and FPRL1 will be different.<br>
GPCRs including FPR induce intracellular signaling via binding to hetero-trimeric G-proteins(s), and many research groups have tried to reveal the critical amino acid residues of receptors involved in G-protein coupling (23, 24). In FPR, Miettinen et al. constructed 35 mutant FPRs and checked the effect of mutation on G-protein coupling and cellular signaling of FPR. According to the paper, S63, D71, R123, and C124/C126 are important for G-protein coupling to FPR (24). Among the mutants, the R123A mutant that was unable to mediate calcium mobilization could induce ERKs phosphorylation by fMLF (24). It has been also postulated that Asp122 and Arg123, which form the conserved (D/E)RY motif (DRC in FPR), participate in a hydrogen bonding network that stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor (24). In the postulation, a ligand binding to a receptor causes alteration of the hydrogen-bonding network, and certain amino acid residues, for example arginine in the DRY motif, become exposed to enable interaction with G-protein (24). It was found that some peptides such as WKGMVm could induce ERKs phosphorylation but not calcium<br>
mobilization. It will be important to determine whether ligation of WKYMVm or WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1) to FPR induces a differential conformational change of the receptor; i.e. although WKYMVm can induce a conformational change of FPR including alteration of the hydrogen bonding of the DRY motif, WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1) just causes a distinct conformation change of the receptor without affecting DRY hydrogen bonding. In the case of FPRL1, it also contains the DRY motif (DRC in FPRL1), but its role in G-protein coupling has not been checked. In the results, not only WKYMVm but also WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1) induced calcium mobilization In FPRL1-expressing RBL cells (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that WKYMVm or WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1) do not affect hydrogen bonding of the DRY motif in FPR or FPRL1. Other binding pockets would be involved for the peptide binding, and as a further work it will be important to identify the residues involving in the differential binding pattern for WKYMVm or WKGMVm (SEQ ID NO: 1) to FPR.<br>
	Until now, it has not been reported that certain natural ligands could<br>
modulate FPR differentially. In immune systems, differential regulation of degranulation or chemotactic migration will be required for more defined regulation. In view of this, it is important to identify ligands that modulate FPR differentially, as in the present invention.<br>
	Example 9: WRYMVm attenuates tumor growth in  CT26-injected<br>
mice<br>
In order to assess the antitumor effect of immuno-modulating peptide, Trp-Arg-Tyr-Met-Val-D-Met-CONH2, (WRYMVm; (SEQ ID NO: 4)), CT26, colon<br>
carcinoma was tested in Balb/c mice model. Tumor mass was measured in size every two days after 6 days from tumor cell inoculation. As shown in Figs. 9A and 9B, 2 /ag/mouse of WRYMVm successfully inhibited tumor mass growth<br>
(50   %   against   PBS    control)   on   day   22.        100   //g/mouse   of   CpG<br>
oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) was tested for comparsion, but the CpG ODN-treated group didn't show any effect on tumor growth. This result suggests that immuno modulating peptide, WRYMVm has significant effects on the suppression of CT26 tumor.<br>
Example 10: WRYMVm attenuates tumor growth in EL4-injected mice<br>
To confirm the antitumor effect of WRYMVm, another tumor model, EL4T lymphoma cells was tested. In order to form the tumor mass of EL4, EL4 (2 x 105 cells/mouse) were injected s.c to C57/BL6 mice. As shown in Figs. 10A and 10B, WRYMVm was able to suppress tumor mass of EL4. This result correlates with CT26 experiment. Overall, it appears obvious that WRYMVm has a tumor growth-suppressing effect in mice model.<br>
Example 11: Low dose of WRYMVm is the most effective in CT26 model<br>
To find the effective tumor-suppressing dose of WRYMVm, 0.1 ^g/mouse, 0.25 ug/mouse. and 1#g/mouse of WRYMVm were administered to CT26/Balb/c model.    As shown in Figs. 11A and  11B, 0.1/zg/mouse treated<br>
group showed the highest effectiveness in the tumor suppression. Interestingly, in 1//g/mouse dose, the tumor suppressing effect was lowered. This result strongly suggests that antitumoral function of WRYMVm is via very sensitive machinery, which are desensitized at a high concentration. A similar phenomenon is easily found in chemotactic migration of leukocytes. In view of the fact that FPRL1, which is a target receptor for WRYMVm, is related to the chemotactic migration event, it is concluded that WRYMVm-induced antitumor effect might be derived from leukocyte infiltration event. Therefore, it is quite necessary to reveal the direct relationship between the WRYMVm-induced antitumor effect and the leukocyte infiltration event.<br>
Example 12: Combinatorial trial of WRYMVm with vincristine enhances antitumor effect<br>
To enhance the antitumor effect of WRYMVm, a combinatorial trial with anticancer drug, vincristine was practiced. Vincristine destorys the microtubule homeostasis, and results in cell death. By using vincristine, tumor specific antigen to the immune system can be provided.   Therefore, i.p. 2 «g/mouse of<br>
vincristine was injected 8 hours prior to the peptide injection. Single vincristine-treated group showed the similar tumor growth suppression pattern ) with WRYMVm-treated group (Fig. 12A). As expected, combinatorial treatment of WRYMVm and vincristine showed most effective antitumor activity. The combinatorial   trial   showed   15   %   improvement   than   WRYMVm-only   or<br>
vincristine-only treated groups. Similar result was also found in the survival rate (Fig. 12B). Although the combinatorial trial didn't show significant improvement compared to the single-treated group, three groups of combinatorial trial, WRYMVm-treated, and vincristine-treated groups still have an ability to suppress tumor growth, whereas PBS control and CpG ODN failed to prevent death. Taken together, it is concluded that immune modulating synthetic peptide, WRYMVm has the antitumor activity.<br>
The WRYMVm is obviously capable of suppressing the tumor growth. Furthermore, WRYMVm functions better in combinatorial trial with vincristine, indicating that WRYMVm can be used in cancer therapy with other agent Furthermore, a short peptide-derived anticancer effect, which modulates immune cells was first invented in this invention.<br>
