				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The subject of the invention is a novel method for detecting the flocculation of asphaltenes as well as a related detection probe for measuring light in heavy hydrocarbon products, waste oil, polluted water or any product containing an emulsion and, in particular, for measuring the flocculation threshold of a colloidal medium. STATE OF THE ART<br>
Petroleum products, and in particular fuel oils or residues from the distillation<br>
i of petroleum, generally called "Black products" (Black oils) in the industry, are<br>
colloidal systems constituted by asphaltenes - i.e. very aromatic heavy molecules having paraffinic side chains - which are dispersed (or also said to be "peptized") in the form of micelles in an oil phase. These colloidal systems can be destabilized more or less easily, for example by thermal cracking or by dilution. Thus, in a refinery, the conversion method, called viscosity breaking (visbreaking), can lead to a precipitation of the asphaltenes as a result of the high temperatures of the method (generally higher than 400Â°C). Likewise, the constitution of mixtures containing such colloidal systems can cause a precipitation of these asphaltenes by flocculation, in particular if the dilution environment is of the paraffinic type.<br>
It is therefore necessary to know or to estimate the characteristics of these asphaltenes in black products, such as a petroleum product or a mixture of hydrocarbon products, in order to evaluate its inherent stability as well as its associated stability reserve. In fact, the greater the stability reserve the less the black product is subject to problems of precipitation of asphaltenes, or of compatibility by dilution with other chemical species, in particular paraffinic bases.<br>
It will be noted that fuel oils or petroleum residues are constituted by a malthenic matrix (resins + paraffins) and asphaltenes dispersed in a colloidal form. The asphaltenes which have a very aromatic character (polar molecules) are insoluble in paraffins (apolar molecules). In order for a residue to be stable the asphaltenes must be maintained in suspension (or dispersed or peptized) in the oil matrix. The peptization of the asphaltenes is ensured by the resins which have both an aromatic character and an apolar character. When a residue has been destabilized, the asphaltenes flocculate aggregating together in the form of large particles which<br>
can cause blockages in filters present in the different treatment units or also cause damage to the metallurgy, for example the pipework.<br>
The characteristic known as the value P, or inherent stability, for example of a black product, is defined in the industry by the following expression:<br>
P = aromaticity of the malthenes/aromaticity of the asphaltenes, or P = Po/(l-Pa), in which,<br>
-	Po represents the ability of the medium to solubilize asphaltenes, i.e. the<br>
aromatic character of the medium. The more aromatic this is the greater the Po is.<br>
-	Pa is the aromatic character of the asphaltenes.<br>
-	1-Pa represents the aromaticity of the medium necessary for solubilizing the<br>
asphaltenes present.<br>
If P &gt; 1, the asphaltenes are peptized and are therefore stable. P-l represents the stability reserve (the greater this reserve the less the black product is subject to problems of precipitation or compatibility).<br>
The severity of a thermal shock such as that produced by a distillation or a visbreaking directly effects the aromaticity of the asphaltenes because the thermal cracking causes the detachment of the alkylated chains and the condensation of the asphaltenes. The asphaltenes which are more condensed and less branched (weaker Pa) will require a stronger solvent in order to remain dispersed. Thus, knowledge of the value of P, associated with that of Pa makes it possible to specify the settings for the operating conditions of the unit concerned so that it is operated without risk of precipitation of the asphaltenes, and consequently to satisfy the various requirements of the operator in terms of quality.<br>
Moreover, knowledge of the solvent power values Po and of the aromatic character of the asphaltenes Pa is necessary in order to optimize the mixture of the different constituents of fuel oils. Thus if a flux (product capable of reducing the viscosity of a mixture) with a weak solvent power is added to a black product, for example visbroken, and having high Po and low Pa values, the value of the Po of the mixture is reduced which can lead to a destabilization of the black product, and consequently to flocculation of the asphaltenes because the resulting Po and Pa values are too low to satisfy the relationship P&gt;1, i.e. the condition required for said asphaltenes to be peptized and therefore stable.<br>
Conventionally the values of P and Pa, and then by calculation Po, of a black product are determined in the laboratory by a dilution in stages using a paraffinic solvent of said black product previously mixed with an aromatic solvent. The moment when flocculation occurs is recorded. The measurement is repeated for at least one other mixture with a different dilution rate. Results are thus obtained which<br>
make it possible by linear correlation to obtain the desired values of P and Pa and then to calculate Po from them.<br>
In an experimental fashion the flocculation threshold in a given mixture can be detected by means of several optical probes operating in the infrared (IR) or the near infrared (NIR).<br>
For example, the technique described in the patents FR-A-2 596 522 or US-A-4 628 204 of Texaco Belgium SA, allows the measurement by IR of the flocculation threshold of a colloidal solution during its dilution. This measurement requires the correct choice in advance of the optical measuring probe (there are several probes) as a function of the nature and in particular of the magnitude of the presence of asphaltenes in the black product to be tested. In the event of a bad choice by the operator it is then necessary to carry out cleaning of the equipment, then to prepare the sample again for another measurement with another probe which leads to a waste of time which can be greater than one hour of operator time while the duration of an analysis is approximately 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours, in particular if the choice of a different probe proves to be judicious.<br>
Another example is the method developed by Shell in collaboration with its Dutch partner Zematra, a manufacturer of analytical apparatuses. This method, in which the detection of the flocculation threshold of the colloidal medium is carried out using a single probe, constituted by a single optical fibre surrounded by glass, unfortunately cannot be used for the whole range of black products. In fact, the systematic heating of the sample at 150Â°C, aside from the safety problems, can cause, for certain types of black products, degradations which are detrimental to the measurement of the flocculation threshold. As regards the duration of an analysis it is relatively long because it can be greater than 5 hours.<br>
Another method is also proposed for measuring the value of P in black products with a "Porla" apparatus manufactured by the Finnish company FMS (Finnish Measurement Systems Ltd), and marketed by the English company Med-Lab. This apparatus uses a measuring cell with continuous circulation of the sample to be analyzed with an optical detection of the flocculation threshold by means of a prism operating in total reflection. The measurement range is very wide and a result can always be obtained even with black products the flocculation threshold of which is reputed to be difficult to measure. However, these results are obtained after modifications to the operating parameters of the method which are then a function of the nature of the product, which is unacceptable when the range of products to be analyzed is very variable, as in the petroleum industry.<br>
The methods currently proposed for measuring the flocculation threshold of asphaltenes in hydrocarbon products therefore have a certain number of drawbacks.<br>
They do not necessarily provide the required simplicity, rapidity and precision of results, in particular for an effective continuous control of a treatment unit, for example for visbreaking, and/or a mixing unit. Nor do they allow the direct analysis of a wide range of products according to their asphaltene content. They use techniques which are not easily automated and/or which are not very simple to use.<br>
The present invention aims to remedy one or more of the drawbacks mentioned above. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
With reference to Figure 1, the method using the standard probes proposed by Texaco Belgium SA are described for the determination of the values of P, Po and Pa, for a given mixture of black product.<br>
The inherent stability of any colloidal system is quantified by a dilution using a paraffinic solvent of a black product, such as a fuel oil, a residue from the atmospheric distillation of petroleum (or under vacuum), a crude oil, previously mixed with an aromatic solvent. This inherent stability (P) depends on the aromatic character of the asphaltenes (Pa) and on the aromatic character of the medium (Po), as was described above. Thus the inherent stability P of a colloidal system is determined by measuring the flocculation threshold of at least 2 different mixtures. Starting from at least these 2 points, a straight line is plotted, called the precipitation of a black product (Fig. 1), which makes it possible to obtain the parameters Pa and P, and then by calculation the value Po.<br>
By the addition of a paraffinic solvent into the black product, the mixture becomes unstable starting from a certain dilution rate called the "minimal dilution rate".<br>
The following definitions are used:<br>
Dilution rate (ml/g):<br>
total volume of solvent (aromatic + paraffinic) in millilitres/mass of black product in grams.<br>
inherent stability P of the black product:<br>
P = 1 + Minimal dilution rate. Here we find the concept of P-l as stability reserve.<br>
For the experimental measurements, two types of solvents are used, the first is binary, essentially constituted by aromatic molecules for the dilution of the sample (for example toluene, xylene, or also 1-methylnaphthalene) and the second is apolar of the paraffinic solvent type (for example n-heptane, cetane, or also isooctane) in order to produce flocculation of the asphaltenes.<br>
The aromaticity of the binary solvent is defined as follows:<br>
volume of aromatic solvent /volume of total solvent. The value 1-Pa is equal to the limit aromaticity of the binary solvent allowing the stability of the mixture to be maintained.<br>
In the case of strong aromaticities of the solvent, the mixture remains stable. In the case of weak aromaticities of the solvent, the mixture becomes unstable. A limit aromaticity of the solvent therefore exists allowing the stability of the mixture to be maintained.<br>
The aromatic character of the asphaltenes is defined by: Pa = 1 - limit aromaticity<br>
The function which, at a given dilution rate of the black product, shows the minimum aromaticity of the solvent in order for the mixture not to precipitate, is called the precipitation curve. The equation of the precipitation curve is given by the formula:<br>
Aromaticity of the solvent as a function of the dilution rate, or in this case: 1 -Pa = f(l/ dilution rate) =A + B/dilution rate.<br>
A and B are constants which depend solely on the sample and make it possible to obtain the values of P, Po and Pa.<br>
The procedure is as follows. A first mixture with a given mass of black product in a given quantity of aromatic solvent is started with and a paraffinic solvent is added in successive increments. The flocculation threshold is determined (in particular by a method using an IR probe) and the dilution rate and the aromaticity associated with the mixture analyzed are recorded. A first point, identified by the point PI on the graph (Fig 1) is obtained. The operation is started again, with a starting product which is initially less diluted in the aromatic solvent. Another measurement is then obtained marked by the point P2. With the two points PI and P2 it is then possible to plot the straight line passing through these points and to obtain limit values (1-Pa) on the ordinates axis (limit aromaticity or infinite dilution rate) and 1/(P-1) on the abscissae axis (nil aromaticity). It then becomes possible to obtain the values of P and Pa then of Po through calculation.<br>
This technique, which cannot refer to a standardized method as it does not currently exist, and which consists in the construction of a precipitation curve, using at least two measurement results, in order to then determine the values of the limit<br>
and nil aromaticities, is the one generally followed in the invention. The masses, the volumes and the products used are perfectly common in the state of the art of this type of analysis.<br>
With reference to Figure 2, the device (1) according to the invention comprises one the one hand a probe (2) operating in direct transmission, and on the other hand, at least one probe, preferably two probes (3, 4), operating in indirect transmission by reflection. The probe (2) comprises an emitter (21) and a receiver (22), creating between them a detection zone (23), here for example of 0.5 mm. The emitter is a standard IR emitter, as is the receiver. The useful diameter of the emitter is in particular of 0.6 - 0.7 mm. This probe (2) is of a type common in the art; it corresponds to a probe commonly used in the IR method proposed by Texaco Belgium SA. The probes (3, 4) are of a type which is new in the art. They are based on a principle of transmission by reflection, using a waveguide. For example the probe (3) comprises a first NIR emitter (31) coupled with a waveguide (32), for example a glass cylinder. This glass cylinder can have a diameter for example of 3 to 5 mm, typically approximately 4 mm. This waveguide transmits the light at the level of a first detection zone (33) which is situated between the lower end (32a) of the waveguide (32) and the aperture (34a) of a second waveguide (36). Two reflecting mirrors (34) are arranged as close as possible to this aperture and in such a way that they return the radiation to the receiver (35), by means of the waveguide (36), preferably made of glass. Preferably, the mirrors (34) and the return waveguide (36) are formed in one piece, and the system consequently has the general shape of a J. The appreciably lengthened part of the waveguide (36) preferably has a crescent shape for the sake of the compactness of the equipment (the plane face is preferably covered with black insulating material in order to prevent interference by the waveguide (32)). The reflecting planes of the mirrors are generally made of glass and are covered with a material suitable for the mirror function. For example, the probe (4) also comprises a first NIR emitter (41) coupled with a waveguide (42), similar and preferably identical to the waveguide (32) described above. This waveguide emits at the level of a second detection zone (43) which is situated between the lower end (42a) of the waveguide (42) and the aperture (44a) of a second waveguide (46). The reflecting mirrors (44) operate in the same way as above and the radiation is returned to a receiver (45), by means of the waveguide (46), similar to that already described above. Here, in a manner which is also preferred, the mirrors (44) and the return waveguide (46) are formed in one piece. Particularly preferably, the mirrors (34, 44) and waveguides (36,46) are combined as mirrors and waveguides in one unit, as are the receivers (35) and (45). An improved compactness of the system is thus obtained. The measurement zones (33) and (43) have distinct dimensions which<br>
can vary, for example, from 1 to 5 mm, and preferably from 1 to 3 mm, respectively. Thus, each probe (3,4) carries out measurements under different conditions of optical path length. It is possible to place the emitters (31, (41) and receivers (35-45) not in contact with the fluid to be tested, which prevents any contamination. The fact of having waveguides with a light-reflecting operating mode is particularly useful for products containing few asphaltenes. In the standard techniques, the probes and emitters are face to face (which requires a practically complete immersion of at least the receiver in the product to be analyzed) and have a relatively small useful area (diameter of the emitters/receivers of the order of 0.7 mm), which means that for these types of products there is a risk of dispersion of the measurements due to saturation phenomena related to the receiver. The use of a waveguide with a larger surface and cross-section (in particular more than 10 times the cross-section of a standard probe) makes it possible to overcome this drawback by encouraging the absorption of light all along the optical path length.<br>
The operation of the device according to the invention is described below.<br>
The probes (2, 3, 4) of the device according to the invention are dipped in the medium to be analyzed and the apparatus automatically determines the probe to be used as a function of the results of preliminary measurements of optical transmission on the product to be analyzed, before the addition of the paraffinic solvent, i.e. before flocculation. These preliminary measurements are controlled automatically by a computer program which is predetermined during construction of said apparatus. Incremental additions of paraffinic solvent are then carried out and the drop in transmission corresponding to flocculation of the asphaltenes is recorded. This determination is carried out by means of standard techniques, for example, by measurement of the absorption peak.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment, the integrated character of the device according to the invention which combines the three probes is used. Firstly, the apparatus selects the probe (4) and then sends an increasingly strong signal, for example of 0 to 100 mA. If no signal is detected at the receiver, this means that the product is too absorbent and then probe (3) is used which operates with a smaller detection zone (1 mm compared to 3 mm for example). The operation is then started again. If at this stage there is still no signal detected, the product is still too absorbent and there is then a switch to probe (1) (small detection zone, 0.5 mm). Measurements will then be carried out with this probe. If, at a point of the method as the emission increases in strength, a signal is noticed, the probe will be kept which is then chosen for measurement of the current sample. When a signal is detected, the emission value of the emitter is set to the threshold value of the signal. In this way, it is possible to choose the probe "in situ", which affords the operator a significant time saving.<br>
Moreover, the integration of 3 probes in the same device makes it possible to obtain a possible spectral application range for the measurements which is very wide. The device according to the invention is suitable for the determination of the values of P, Pa and Po for all residues and fuel oil types and has practically no limits in terms of the nature of the medium to be tested. Since the probes are integrated in one and the same device, it is possible to carry out several measurements in less time, which at least makes it possible to carry out 3 measurements and therefore to obtain 3 points of the curve and thus a good repeatability of the measurements for P, Pa and Po. Finally, the method of determination according to the invention can be carried out at ambient temperature and requires no heating during measurement.<br>
Generally, the aromatic solvent/paraffinic solvent pair used in the invention is the toluene/n-heptane pair.<br>
The different constituent elements of the device according to the invention are available from the ROFA company. EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention without limiting it. Example 1.<br>
Comparative measurements were carried out on 8 samples of different black products for which the P, Pa values were measured and the Po value was calculated, on the one hand with a method using the probes proposed by Texaco Belgium SA ("Measurement method A" in Table 1 below) and on the other hand with the device and the method according to the present invention ("Measurement method B").<br>
In this example, the black products referenced PN1 to PN8 correspond to:<br>
-	PN1 and PN2/ Residues of desulphuration of an atmospheric residue;<br>
-	PN3 and PN4 / Fuel oils;<br>
-	PN5 and PN6/ Visbroken residues under vacuum;<br>
-	PN7 / Charge of a visbreaking unit (Residue under vacuum + 20 %<br>
atmospheric residue);<br>
-	PN8/ Visbroken residue under vacuum<br>
Table 1: Comparison of the results of the P and Pa measurements, and the calculation<br>
of Po, with the Texaco probes (Measurement method A) and the device and method<br>
according to the invention (Measurement method B)<br>
<br>
(Table Remove)In this table, it can be seen that with the device and method according to the invention, it is easier to obtain the measurement of the flocculation threshold of a clear product (PN1) and also of a stable product (PN7) which is made clear by a significant dilution. These two products could not initially be measured in terms of P, Pa and therefore of Po with the standard manual method using the Texaco probes. For each of the 8 measurements, the correlation coefficient R2 of the precipitation curve (aromaticity as a function of the reciprocal of the dilution) constructed with 3 points (PI, P2 and P3) varies from 0,976 to 1,000.<br>
Moreover, automation of the analysis, including the choice of the probe most suited to the measurement, makes it possible to carry out the complete analysis in less than one hour. Example 2<br>
In order to compare the repeatability values obtained with the measurements of P, Pa then of calculated Po, which can be obtained by the manual method using the Texaco probes (Measurement methods A) and the automated method the device and the method of which are the subject of the present invention (Measurement method B), 3 samples PN2, PN3 and PN8 were chosen from the corpus defined in Example 1 above.<br>
The results for 8 different measurements, with the 2 methods, on each of these 3 samples are shown respectively in Tables 2, 3 and 4 below. The average values calculated, as well as the standard deviations and the repeatabilities are shown in these same tables.<br>
Table 2: Measurement of the repeatabilities of the values P, Pa and Po on the sample<br>
PN2 obtained with the Texaco probes (Measurement method A) and the device and<br>
method according to the invention (Measurement method B)<br>
<br>
(Table Remove)Table 3: Measurement of the repeatabilities of the values P, Pa and Po on the sample<br>
PN3 obtained with the Texaco probes (Measurement method A) and the device and<br>
method according to the invention (Measurement method B)<br>
<br>
(Table Remove)Table 4: Measurement of the repeatabilities of the values P. Pa and Po on the sample<br>
PN8 obtained with the Texaco probes (Measurement method A) and the device and<br>
method according to the invention (Measurement method B)<br>
<br>
(Table Remove)It can be seen in Tables 2, 3 and 4 that the average values obtained with the 2 measurement methods are more or less identical and above all that the values of the standard deviations and the repeatabilities are smaller by a factor of approximately 3 when the measurement method uses the device for detecting the flocculation threshold and the related method according to the present invention (with a complete automation of the measurement method in this case).<br>
