				<td>A WHITE LIGHT EMITTING PHOSPHOR BLEND FOR LCD DEVICES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to a white light illumination system,<br>
and specifically to a ceramic phosphor blend for converting UV radiation<br>
emitted by a light emitting diode ("LED") to white light.<br>
White light emitting LEDs are used as a backlight in liquid crystal<br>
displays and as a replacement for small conventional lamps and fluorescent<br>
lamps. As discussed in chapter 10.4 of "The Blue Laser Diode" by S.<br>
Nakamura et al., pages 216-221 (Springer 1997), incorporated herein by<br>
reference, white light LEDs are fabricated by forming a ceramic phosphor<br>
layer on the output surface of a blue light emitting semiconductor LED.<br>
Conventionally, the blue LED is an InGaN single quantum well LED and the<br>
phosphor is a cerium doped yttrium aluminum garnet ("YAG:Ce"),<br>
Y3Al5O12:Ce3+. The blue light emitted by the LED excites the phosphor,<br>
causing it to emit yellow light. The blue light emitted by the LED is<br>
transmitted through the phosphor and is mixed with the yellow light emitted<br>
by the phosphor. The viewer perceives the mixture of blue and yellow light<br>
as white light.<br>
However, the blue LED - YAG:Ce phosphor white light illumination<br>
system suffers from the following disadvantages. The LED color output (e.g.,<br>
spectral power distribution and peak emission wavelength) varies with the<br>
band gap width of the LED active layer and with the power applied to the<br>
LED. During production, a certain percentage of LEDs are manufactured<br>
with active layers whose actual band gap width is larger or smaller than the<br>
desired width. Thus, the color output of such LEDs deviates from the desired<br>
parameters. Furthermore, even if the band gap of a particular LED has the<br>
desired width, during LED operation the power applied to the LED<br><br>
frequently deviates from the desired value. This also causes the LED color<br>
output to deviate from the desired parameters. Since the light emitted by the<br>
system contains a blue component from the LED, if the color output of the<br>
LED deviates from the desired parameters, then the light output by the<br>
system deviates form the desired parameters as well. A significant deviation<br>
from the desired parameters may cause the color output of the system to<br>
appear non-white (i.e., bluish or yellowish).<br>
Furthermore, the color output of the blue LED - YAG:Ce phosphor<br>
system varies greatly due to frequent, unavoidable, routine deviations from<br>
desired parameters (i.e., manufacturing systematic variations) during the<br>
production of the LED lamp because the color output of the blue LED -<br>
YAG:Ce phosphor system is very sensitive to the thickness of the phosphor.<br>
If the phosphor is too thin, then more than a desired amount of the blue light<br>
emitted by the LED will penetrate through the phosphor, and the combined<br>
LED - phosphor system light output will appear bluish, because it is<br>
dominated by the output of the blue LED. In contrast, if the phosphor is too<br>
thick, then less than a desired amount of the blue LED light will penetrate<br>
through the thick YAG.Ce phosphor layer. The combined LED - phosphor<br>
system will then appear yellowish, because it is dominated by the yellow<br>
output of the YAG:Ce phosphor.<br>
Therefore, the thickness of the phosphor is a critical variable affecting<br>
the color output of the prior art system. Unfortunately, it is difficult to<br>
control the precise thickness of the phosphor during large scale production of<br>
the blue LED - YAG:Ce phosphor system. Variations in phosphor thickness<br>
often result in the system output being unsuitable for white light illumination<br>
applications, causing the color output of the system to appear non-white (i.e.,<br><br>
bluish or yellowish), which leads to an unacceptably low blue LED - YAG:Ce<br>
phosphor system manufacturing yield.<br>
The blue LED - YAG:Ce phosphor system also suffers from the halo<br>
effect due to the separation of blue and yellow light. The LED emits blue light<br>
in a directional fashion. However, the phosphor emits yellow light<br>
isotropically (i.e., in all directions). Therefore, when the light output by the<br>
system is viewed straight on (i.e., directly at the LED emission), the light<br>
appears bluish-white. In contrast, when the light output is viewed at an<br>
angle, the light appears yellowish due to the predominance of the yellow<br>
phosphor emission. When the light output by such a system is directed onto<br>
a flat surface, it appears as a yellowish halo surrounding a bluish area. The<br>
present invention is directed to overcoming or at least reducing the problems<br>
set forth above.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the problems in the prior art, it is desirable to obtain a white<br>
light illumination system whose color output is less sensitive to variations<br>
during system operation and manufacturing process, such as due to<br>
variations in the LED power, the width of the LED active layer band gap and<br>
the thickness of the luminescent material. The present inventors have<br>
discovered that a color output of the radiation source - luminescent material<br>
system is less sensitive to these variations if the color output of the system<br>
does not include significant visible radiation emitted by the radiation source,<br>
such as an LED. In this case, the color output of the system does not vary<br>
significantly with the LED power, band gap width and the luminescent<br>
material thickness. The term luminescent material includes a luminescent<br>
material in loose or packed powder form (a phosphor) and in solid crystalline<br>
body form (scintillator).<br>
The color output of the system does not vary significantly with the<br>
thickness of the luminescent material if the white light emitted by the system<br>
lacks any significant visible component emitted by the radiation source, such<br>
as the LED. Therefore, the amount of transmission of the LED radiation<br>
5<br><br>
RD-28071<br>
through the luminescent material, such as a phosphor, does not affect the<br>
color output of the system. This can be achieved in at least two ways.<br>
One way to avoid affecting the color output of the system is by using a<br>
radiation source that emits radiation in a wavelength that is not visible to the<br>
human eye. For example, an LED may be constructed to emit ultraviolet (UV)<br>
radiation having a wavelength of 380 nm or less that is completely not visible<br>
to the human eye. Furthermore, the human eye is not very sensitive to UV<br>
radiation having a wavelength between 380 and 400 nm and to violet light<br>
having a wavelength between 400 and 420 nm. Therefore, the radiation<br>
emitted by the LED having a wavelength of 420 nm or less would not<br>
substantially affect the color output of the LED - phosphor system irrespective<br>
of whether the emitted LED radiation is transmitted through the phosphor or<br>
not, because radiation having a wavelength of about 420 nm or less is not<br>
significantly visible to a human eye.<br>
The second way to avoid affecting the color output of the system is by<br>
using a thick luminescent material which does not allow the radiation from<br>
the radiation source to pass through it. For example, if the LED emits visible<br>
light between 420 and 650 nm, then in order to ensure that the phosphor<br>
thickness does not affect the color output of the system, the phosphor should<br>
be thick enough to prevent any significant amount of visible light emitted by<br>
the LED from penetrating through the phosphor. However, while this way<br>
to avoid affecting the color output of the system is possible, it is not preferred<br>
because it lowers the output efficiency of the system.<br>
In both cases described above, the color of the visible light emitted by<br>
the system is solely dependent on the type of luminescent material used.<br>
Therefore, in order for the LED - phosphor system to emit white light, the<br>
phosphor should emit white light when it is irradiated by the LED radiation.<br>
6<br><br>
RD-28071<br>
The present inventors have discovered that a when a first orange<br>
emitting phosphor having a peak emission wavelength between about 570<br>
and about 620 nm and a second blue-green emitting phosphor having a peak<br>
emission wavelength between about 480 and about 500 nm are used together,<br>
a human observer perceives their combined emission as white light. Any<br>
luminescent materials, such as phosphors having peak emission wavelengths<br>
between 570 and 620 nm and between 480 and 500 nm may be used in<br>
combination with a radiation source to form the white light illumination<br>
system. Preferably, the luminescent materials have a high quantum efficiency<br>
at a particular emission wavelength of the radiation source. Furthermore,<br>
each luminescent material is preferably transparent to the visible light<br>
wavelengths emitted by the other luminescent material.<br>
Figure 1 schematically illustrates the above principle. In Figure 1, a<br>
radiation source 1, such as an LED, emits radiation 2 incident on two<br>
luminescent materials, such as a first phosphor 3 and second phosphor 4. The<br>
two phosphors 3, 4 are separated by a schematic diagonal line in Figure 1 to<br>
indicate the two phosphors may be blended together or that the two<br>
phosphors may comprise discrete overlying layers. The diagonal line is used<br>
for definitional purposes only and not to indicate a mandatory diagonal<br>
boundary between the phosphors.<br>
The radiation 2 may have a wavelength to which the human eye is not<br>
sensitive, such as 420 nm and below. Alternatively, the phosphors 3,4 may be<br>
too thick to allow the radiation 2 to penetrate to the other side. After<br>
absorbing the incident radiation 2, the first phosphor 3 emits orange light 5<br>
having a peak emission wavelength between 570 and 620 nm, while the<br>
second phosphor 4 emits blue-green light 6 having a peak emission<br>
wavelength between 480 and 500 nm. The human observer 7 perceives the<br>
7<br><br>
RD-28071<br>
combination of orange 5 and blue-green 6 light as white light 8. Figure 1<br>
schematically illustrates that orange light 5 and blue-green light 6 emanates<br>
from discrete phosphor areas to illustrate the concept of color mixing.<br>
However, it should be understood that the entire phosphor 3 emits light 5 and<br>
that the entire phosphor 4 emits light 6. Both orange light 5 and blue-green<br>
light 6 may be emitted from the same area if the first and second phosphors 3,<br>
4 are blended together to form a single blended phosphor layer.<br>
The radiation source 1 may comprise any radiation source capable of<br>
causing an emission from the first 3 and second 4 phosphors. Preferably, the<br>
radiation source 1 comprises an LED. However, the radiation source 1 may<br>
also comprise a gas, such as mercury in a fluorescent lamp or high pressure<br>
mercury vapor lamp, or a noble gas, such as Ne, Ar and/or Xe in a plasma<br>
display.<br>
For example, the radiation source 1 may comprise any LED which<br>
causes the first 3 and second 4 phosphor to emit radiation 8 which appears<br>
white to the human observer 7 when the radiation 2 emitted by the LED is<br>
directed onto the first 3 and second 4 phosphors. Thus, the LED may<br>
comprise a semiconductor diode based on any suitable III-V, II-VI or IV-IV<br>
semiconductor layers and having an emission wavelength of 360 to 420 run.<br>
For example, the LED may contain at least one semiconductor layer based on<br>
GaN, ZnSe or SiC semiconductors. The LED may also contain one or more<br>
quantum wells in the active region, if desired. Preferably, the LED active<br>
region may comprise a p-n junction comprising GaN, AlGaN and/or InGaN<br>
semiconductor layers. The p-n junction may be separated by a thin undoped<br>
InGaN layer or by one or more InGaN quantum wells. The LED may have an<br>
emission wavelength between 360 and 420 nm, preferably between 370 and<br>
405 nm, most preferably between 370 and 390 nm. However, an LED with an<br>
8<br><br>
RD-28071<br>
emission wavelength above 420 nm may be used with a thick phosphor,<br>
whose thickness prevents the light emitted from the LED from penetrating<br>
through the phosphor. For example the LED may have the following<br>
wavelengths: 370, 375, 380, 390 or 405 nm.<br>
The radiation source 1 of the white light illumination system has been<br>
described above as a semiconductor light emitting diode. However, the<br>
radiation source of the present invention is not limited to a semiconductor<br>
light emitting diode. For example, the radiation source may comprise a laser<br>
diode or an organic light emitting diode (OLED). The preferred white light<br>
illumination system described above contains a single radiation source 1.<br>
However, if desired, plural radiation sources may be used in the system in<br>
order to improve the emitted white light or to combine the emitted white<br>
light with a light of a different color(s). For example, the white light emitting<br>
system may be used in combination with red, green and/or blue light<br>
emitting diodes in a display device.<br>
The first luminescent material may be any phosphor 3, which in<br>
response to the incident radiation 2 from the radiation source 1, emits visible<br>
light having a peak emission wavelength between 570 and 620 nm. If the<br>
radiation source 1 comprises an LED having a peak emission wavelength<br>
between 360 and 420 nm, then the first phosphor 3 preferably comprises<br>
APO:Eu2+,Mn2+ where A comprises at least one of Sr, Ca, Ba or Mg. Most<br>
preferably, the first phosphor 3 comprises a europium and manganese doped<br>
alkaline earth pyrophosphate phosphor, A2P2O7:Eu2+,Mn2+, which may be<br>
written as (A1-x-yEuxMny)2 P2 O7, where A comprises at least one of Sr, Ca, Ba<br>
or Mg, 0 
phosphor is preferred for an LED radiation source because this phosphor<br>
emits visible light having a peak emission wavelength between 575 and 595<br>
9<br><br>
RD-28071<br>
ran and because it has a high efficacy and high quantum efficiency for<br>
incident radiation having a peak wavelength between 360 and 420 nm, such<br>
as that emitted by an LED. Alternatively, the first phosphor may comprise<br>
A3P2O8;Eu2+,Mn2+, where A comprises at least one of Sr, Ca, Ba or Mg.<br>
In the Eu2+ and Mn2+ doped alkaline earth pyrophosphate phosphor,<br>
the Eu ions generally act as sensitizers and Mn ions generally act as activators.<br>
Thus, the Eu ions absorb the incident energy (i.e., photons) emitted by the<br>
radiation source and transfer the absorbed energy to the Mn ions. The Mn<br>
ions are promoted to an excited state by the absorbed transferred energy and<br>
emit a broad radiation band having a peak wavelength that varies from about<br>
575 to 595 nm depending on processing conditions.<br>
The second luminescent material may be any phosphor 4, which in<br>
response to the incident radiation 2 from the radiation source 1, emits visible<br>
light having a peak emission wavelength between 480 and 500 nm. If the<br>
radiation source 1 comprises an LED having a peak emission wavelength<br>
between 360 and 420 nm, then the second phosphor may comprise any<br>
commercially available phosphor having the peak emission wavelength<br>
between 480 and 500 nm and a high efficacy and quantum efficiency for<br>
incident radiation having a peak wavelength between 370 and 420 nm. For<br>
example, the following five phosphors fit this criteria:<br>
a)	A4D14O25:Eu2+/ where A comprises at least one of Sr, Ca, Ba or Mg,<br>
and D comprises at least one of Al or Ga;<br>
b)	(2AO * 0.84P2O5* O.16B2O3): Eu2+, where A comprises at least one of<br>
Sr, Ca, Ba or Mg;<br>
c)	AD8O13:Eu2+, where A comprises at least one of Sr, Ca, Ba or Mg, and<br>
D comprises at least one of Al or Ga;<br>
10<br><br>
RD-28071<br>
d)	A10(P04)6Cl2:Eu2+/ where A comprises at least one of Sr, Ca, Ba or<br>
Mg;or<br>
e)	A2Si308 * 2ACl2:Eu2+, where A comprises at least one of Sr, Ca, Ba or<br>
Mg.<br>
The preferred, commercially available compositions for the above five<br>
phosphors are:<br>
a)	Sr4Al14O25:Eu2+ (also known as the SAE phosphor);<br>
b)	(2SrO * 0.84P2O5* O.16B2O3): Eu2+;<br>
c)	BaAl8C13:Eu2+;<br>
d)	(Sr,Mg/Ca)10(P04)6a2:Eu2+; or0<br>
e)Sr2Si308*2SrCl2:Eu2+.<br>
These phosphors, having peak emission wavelengths ranging from 480 to 493<br>
nm, are described on pages 389-432 of the Phosphor Handbook, Edited by S.<br>
Shionoya and W.M. Yen, CRC Press, (1987, 1999), incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Therefore, the second phosphor 4 may comprise one or more of<br>
phosphors a) to e) in any combination. The SAE phosphor is preferred<br>
because it has a quantum efficiency of at least 90% for incident radiation<br>
having a wavelength of 340 to 400 nm and has little or no selective absorption<br>
of the visible light.<br>
However, other phosphors having a peak emission wavelengths<br>
between 570 and 620 nm or between 480 and 500 nm may be used instead of<br>
or in addition to the phosphors described above. For example, for radiation<br>
sources other than LEDs, phosphors that have a high efficacy and high<br>
quantum efficiency for incident radiation having a peak wavelength of 254<br>
nm and 147 nm, may be used for fluorescent lamp and plasma display<br>
applications, respectively. The mercury gas emission in a fluorescent lamp<br>
11<br><br>
RD-28071<br>
has a peak emission wavelength of 254 nm and Xe plasma discharge in a<br>
plasma display has a peak emission wavelength of 147 run.<br>
According to a preferred aspect of the present invention, the first<br>
phosphor 3 and the second phosphor 4 are interspersed. Most preferably, the<br>
first phosphor 3 and the second phosphor 4 are blended together to form a<br>
uniform blend. The amount of each phosphor in the blend depends on the<br>
type of phosphor and the type of radiation source used. However, the first 3<br>
and the second 4 phosphors should be blended such that the combination 8 of<br>
the emission 5 from the first phosphor 3 and the emission 6 from the second<br>
phosphor 4 appears white to a human observer 7.<br>
Alternatively, the first and second phosphors 3, 4 may comprise<br>
discrete layers formed over the radiation source 1. However, the upper<br>
phosphor layer should be substantially transparent to the radiation emitted<br>
by the lower phosphor. Furthermore, one of the two phosphors 3, 4 may<br>
comprise discrete particles embedded in the other phosphor layer. If desired,<br>
one or both of the first 3 and second 4 phosphors may be replaced by a single<br>
crystal scintillator having peak emission wavelengths between 570 and 620<br>
nm and/or between 480 and 500 nm.<br>
According to the first preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the first and second phosphor powders are placed into a white light<br>
illumination system containing an LED radiation source. The white light<br>
illumination system according to the preferred aspect of the present invention<br>
may have various different structures.<br>
The first preferred structure is schematically illustrated in Figure 2. The<br>
illumination system includes a light emitting diode chip 11 and leads 13<br>
electrically attached to the LED chip. The leads 13 may comprise thin wires<br>
12<br><br>
RD-28071<br>
supported by a thicker lead frame(s) 15 or the leads may comprise self<br>
supported electrodes and the lead frame may be omitted. The leads 13<br>
provide current to the LED chip 11 and thus cause the LED chip 11 to emit<br>
radiation.<br>
The LED chip 11 is encapsulated within a shell 17 which<br>
encloses the LED chip and an encapsulant material 19. The encapsulant<br>
material preferably comprises a UV resistant epoxy. The shell 17 may be, for<br>
example, glass or plastic. The encapsulant material may be, for example, an<br>
epoxy or a polymer material, such as silicone. However, a separate shell 17<br>
may be omitted and the outer surface of the encapsulant material 19 may<br>
comprise the shell 17. The LED chip 11 may be supported, for example, by the<br>
lead frame 15, by the self supporting electrodes, the bottom of the shell 17 or<br>
by a pedestal mounted to the shell or to the lead frame.<br>
The first preferred structure of the illumination system includes<br>
a phosphor layer 21 comprising the first phosphor 3 and second phosphor 4.<br>
The phosphor layer 21 may be formed over or directly on the light emitting<br>
surface of the LED chip 11 by coating and drying a suspension containing the<br>
first 3 and second 4 phosphor powders over the LED chip 11. After drying,<br>
the phosphor powders 3, 4 form a solid phosphor layer or coating 21. Both<br>
the shell 17 and the encapsulant 19 should be transparent to allow white light<br>
23 to be transmitted through those elements. The phosphor emits white light<br>
13<br><br>
RD-28071<br>
23 which comprises the orange light 5 emitted by the first phosphor 3 and the<br>
blue-green light 6 emitted by the second phosphor 4.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a second preferred structure of the system<br>
according to the first preferred embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
structure of Figure 3 is the same as that of Figure 2, except that the first 3 and<br>
second 4 phosphor powders are interspersed within the encapsulant material<br>
19, instead of being formed over the LED chip 11. The first 3 and second 4<br>
phosphor powders may be interspersed within a single region of the<br>
encapsulant material 19 or throughout the entire volume of the encapsulant<br>
material. The phosphor powders are interspersed within the encapsulant<br>
material, for example, by adding the powders to a polymer precursor, and<br>
then curing the polymer precursor to solidify the polymer material.<br>
Alternatively, the phosphor powders may be mixed in with the epoxy<br>
encapsulant. Other phosphor interspersion methods may also be used. The<br>
first phosphor powder 3 and the second phosphor powder 4 may be<br>
premixed prior to adding a mix of these powders 3, 4 to the encapsulant<br>
material 19 or the phosphor powders 3, 4 may be added to the encapsulant<br>
material 19 separately. Alternatively, a solid phosphor layer 21 comprising<br>
the first and second phosphors 3, 4 may be inserted into the encapsulant<br>
material 19 if desired. In this structure, the phosphor layer 21 absorbs the<br>
radiation 25 emitted by the LED and in response, emits white light 23.<br>
14<br><br>
RD-28071<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a third preferred structure of the system<br>
according to the first preferred embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
structure of Figure 4 is the same as that of Figure 2, except that the phosphor<br>
layer 21 containing the first and second phosphors 3, 4 is formed on the shell<br>
17, instead of being formed over the LED chip 11. The phosphor layer 21 is<br>
preferably formed on the inside surface of the shell 17, although the phosphor<br>
layer 21 may be formed on the outside surface of the shell, if desired. The<br>
phosphor layer 21 may be coated on the entire surface of the shell or only a<br>
top portion of the surface of the shell 17.<br>
Of course, the embodiments of Figures 2-4 may be combined and the<br>
phosphor may be located in any two or all three locations or in any other<br>
suitable location, such as separately from the shell or integrated into the LED.<br>
According to the second preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the first and the second phosphor powders 3, 4 are placed into a<br>
white light illumination system containing a fluorescent lamp radiation<br>
source. A portion of a fluorescent lamp is schematically illustrated in Figure<br>
5. The lamp 31 contains a phosphor coating 35 comprising the first 3 and<br>
second 4 phosphors on a surface of the lamp cover 33, preferably the inner<br>
surface. The fluorescent lamp 31 also preferably contains a lamp base 37 and a<br>
cathode 39. The lamp cover 33 encloses a gas, such as mercury, which emits<br>
UV radiation in response to a voltage applied to the cathode 39.<br>
According to the third preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the first 3 and the second 4 phosphor powders are placed into a white light<br>
illumination system containing a plasma display device. Any plasma display<br>
15<br><br>
RD-28071<br>
device, such as an AC or a DC plasma display panel may be used, such as the<br>
devices described on pages 623-639 of the Phosphor Handbook, Edited by S.<br>
Shionoya and W.M. Yen, CRC Press, (1987, 1999), incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Figure 6 schematically illustrates one cell of a DC plasma display<br>
device 41. The cell contains a first glass plate 42, a second glass plate 43, at<br>
least one cathode 44, at least one anode 45, a phosphor layer 46 comprising<br>
the first 3 and the second 4 phosphors, barrier ribs 47 and a noble gas space<br>
48. In an AC plasma display device, an extra dielectric layer is added<br>
between the cathode and the gas space 48. An application of a voltage<br>
between the anode 45 and the cathode 44 causes the noble gas in space 48 to<br>
emit short wavelength vacuum ultraviolet radiation (VUV), which excites the<br>
phosphor layer 46 causing it to emit white light.<br>
The individual phosphors 3 and 4 may be made, for example, by<br>
any ceramic powder method, such as a wet chemical method or a solid state<br>
method. Preferably, the method of making the first phosphor 3 comprising<br>
europium and manganese doped strontium pyrophosphate phosphor<br>
comprises the following steps.<br>
First, the starting compounds of the first phosphor material are<br>
manually blended or mixed in a crucible or mechanically blended or mixed in<br>
another suitable container, such as a ball mill, to form a starting powder<br>
mixture. The starting compounds may comprise any oxide, phosphate,<br>
hydroxide, oxalate, carbonate and/or nitrate starting phosphor compound.<br>
The preferred starting phosphor compounds comprise strontium hydrogen<br>
phosphate, SrHPO, manganese carbonate MnCC3, europium oxide, EU2O3,<br>
16<br><br>
RD-28071<br>
and ammonium hydrogen phosphate (NH4)HP04 powders. The (NH4)HP04<br>
powder is preferably added in an amount comprising 2% in excess of the<br>
stoichiometric ratio per mole of the first phosphor produced. A small excess<br>
of the Sr compound may also be added if desired. Calcium, barium and<br>
magnesium starting compounds may also be added if it is desired to<br>
substitute some or all of the strontium with calcium, barium and/or<br>
magnesium.<br>
The starting powder mixture is then heated in air at about 300 to 800 °C<br>
for about 1-5 hours, preferably at 600 °C. The resulting powder is then re-<br>
blended and subsequently fired in a reducing atmosphere at about 1000 to<br>
1250 °C, preferably 1000 °C, to form a calcined phosphor body or cake.<br>
Preferably the starting powder mixture is calcined in a furnace in an<br>
atmosphere comprising nitrogen and 0.1 to 10% hydrogen for four to ten<br>
hours, preferably eight hours, and subsequently cooled in the same<br>
atmosphere by turning off the furnace.<br>
The solid calcined phosphor body may be converted to a first phosphor<br>
powder 3 in order to easily coat the phosphor powder on a portion of the<br>
white light illumination system. The solid phosphor body may be converted<br>
to the first phosphor powder by any crushing, milling or pulverizing method,<br>
such as wet milling, dry milling, jet milling or crushing. Preferably, the solid<br>
body is wet milled in propanol, methanol and/or water, and subsequently<br>
dried.<br>
The second phosphor 4 may be selected from any combination of one<br>
or more of the following five phosphors:<br>
a) A4D14O25:Eu2+, preferably Sr4Al14O25:Eu2+ ("SAE");<br>
17<br><br>
RD-28071<br>
b)	(2AO * 0.84P2O5* O.16B2O3): Eu2+, preferably (2SrO * 0.84P2O5 *<br>
O.16B2O3): Eu2+;<br>
c)	AD8O13:Eu2+, preferably BaAl8O13:Eu2+;<br>
d)	A10(P04)6Cl2:Eu2+, preferably (Sr/Mg/Ca)10(PO4)6Cl2:Eu2+; or<br>
e)	A2Si3O8 * 2ACl2:Eu2+, preferably Sr2Si308*2SrCl2:Eu2+.<br>
A method of making these phosphors is known in the art, as described on<br>
pages 389-432 of the Phosphor Handbook, Edited by S. Shionoya and W.M. Yen,<br>
CRC Press, (1987, 1999), incorporated herein by reference. For example, the<br>
SAE phosphor is prepared by mixing alpha alumina, europium oxide and<br>
strontium carbonate with a borate flux, firing the mixture at 1200°C for<br>
several hours and subsequently cooling the mixture in forming gas (98%N2 /<br>
2%H2), pulverizing and sieving the calcined body, re-firing the resulting<br>
powder at 1300°C in wet H2/N2 gas mixture and then re-pulverizing the re-<br>
fired body to form the second powder 4. The preferred composition of the<br>
SAE phosphor is (Sn1-X Eux)4Al14O25, where x ranges from 0.1 to 0.01, and<br>
having a preferred value of 0.1. A similar method may be used to form the<br>
BaAl8O13:Eu2+ phosphor, with barium carbonate being used instead of<br>
strontium carbonate.<br>
The starting materials for the (2SrO * 0.84P2O5* 0.16B2O3): Eu2+<br>
phosphor are SrHP04, SrCO3, EU2O3 and H3BO3 (99.5%). Firing is carried out<br>
at 1100 to 1250 °C in a slightly reducing atmosphere for several hours. The<br>
phosphor preferably contains 2 to 3 mol % of Eu. The starting materials for<br>
the (Sr,Mg,Ca)10(PO4)6Cl2:Eu2+ phosphor are BaHP04, BaCO3, CaCO3, MgO,01<br>
NH4Cl and EU2O3. Firing is carried out at 800°C in air and then, after re-<br>
pulverizing, in a slightly reducing atmosphere. The starting materials for the<br>
Sr2Si3O8*2SrCl2:Eu2+ phosphor are SrCC3, SiO2 and SrCl2 in a 2:3:2 ratio with<br>
O.1EU2O3. The starting materials are mixed with water, fired at 850°C in air<br>
for 3 hours, pulverized, re-fired at 950°C in a slightly reducing atmosphere<br>
18<br><br>
RD-28071<br>
and re-pulverized. The re-pulverized calcined body is then washed with<br>
water to remove the remaining SrCl2. However, any of the five second<br>
phosphor 4 powders may be commercially obtained, and thus, their exact<br>
method of manufacture is not significant.<br>
The first 3 and second 4 phosphor powders are then blended or mixed<br>
together to form a phosphor powder blend or mixture. The powders 3, 4 may<br>
be manually blended in a crucible or mechanically blended in another suitable<br>
container, such as a ball mill. Of course, the phosphor powder blend may<br>
contain more than two powders, if desired. Alternatively, the first and<br>
second calcined bodies may be pulverized and blended together.<br>
The composition of the phosphor powder blend may be optimized<br>
based on the composition of the first 3 and the second 4 phosphors and the<br>
peak emission wavelength of the radiation source 1. For example, for a<br>
radiation source having a peak emission wavelength of 405 nm, the phosphor<br>
powder blend preferably contains 89% by weight of (Sro.8Euo.1Mno.1)2P2O7 and<br>
11% by weight of SAE. In contrast, for a radiation source having a peak<br>
emission wavelength of 380 nm, the phosphor powder blend preferably<br>
contains 77% by weight of (Sro.8Euo.1Mno.1)2P2O7 and 23% by weight of SAE.<br>
The phosphor powder blend is then placed into the white light<br>
illumination system. For example, the phosphor powder blend may be placed<br>
over the LED chip, interspersed into the encapsulant material or coated onto<br>
the surface of the shell, as described above with respect to the first preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
If the phosphor powder blend is coated onto the LED chip or the shell,<br>
then preferably, a suspension of the phosphor powder blend and a liquid is<br>
used to coat the LED chip or the shell surface. The suspension may also<br>
19<br><br>
RD-28071<br>
optionally contain a binder in a solvent. Preferably, the binder comprises an<br>
organic material, such as nitrocellulose or ethylcellulose, in a solvent such as<br>
butyl acetate or xylol. The binder enhances the adhesion of the powder<br>
particles to each other and to the LED or the shell. However, the binder may<br>
be omitted to simplify processing, if desired. After coating, the suspension is<br>
dried and may be heated to evaporate the binder. The phosphor powder<br>
blend acts as the phosphor layer 21 after drying the solvent.<br>
If the phosphor blend is to be interspersed within the encapsulant<br>
material 19, then the phosphor blend may be added to a polymer precursor,<br>
and then the polymer precursor may be cured to solidify the polymer<br>
material. Alternatively, the phosphor blend may be mixed in with the epoxy<br>
encapsulant. Other phosphor interspersion methods may also be used.<br>
If the phosphor blend is placed into a fluorescent lamp or a plasma<br>
display, then a suspension of the phosphor powder blend and a liquid is used<br>
to coat the lamp or plasma display interior surface. The suspension may also<br>
optionally contain a binder in a solvent, as described above.<br>
While the phosphor coating method has been described as a coating of<br>
a phosphor blend, the first 3 and the second phosphors 4 may be formed as<br>
overlying, individual layers on a surface of the white light illumination<br>
system. Furthermore, the luminescent material(s) may comprise single crystal<br>
scintillator material(s) instead of or in addition to the phosphors, if desired.<br>
The scintillators may be made by any scintillator fabrication method. For<br>
example, the scintillators may be formed by Czochralski, float zone, or other<br>
crystal growing methods. The scintillators may then be placed over the LED<br>
chip or used as the shell or as a top portion of the shell of the white light<br>
illumination system.<br>

The following examples are merely illustrative, and should not be<br>
construed to be any sort of limitation on the scope of the claimed invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
A first (Sro.8Euo.1Mno.1)2P2O7 phosphor was prepared by<br>
blending SrHPO4, MnCO3, Eu2O3 and (NH4)HPO4 powders to form a starting<br>
powder mixture. The (NH4)HPO4 was added in an amount comprising 2% in<br>
excess of the stoichiometric ratio per mole of the first phosphor produced.<br>
The starting powder mixture was then heated in air at about 600 °C for 1<br>
hour. The resulting powder was then re-blended and subsequently fired in a<br>
reducing atmosphere comprising nitrogen and 0.5% hydrogen at about 1000<br>
°C for eight hours to form a calcined phosphor body or cake. The solid<br>
phosphor cake was converted to a first phosphor powder by wet milling and<br>
subsequent drying.<br>
The first phosphor powder was blended with a commercially<br>
obtained SAE phosphor powder in a ratio of 89:11 by weight to obtain a<br>
phosphor powder blend or mixture. The phosphor powder blend was<br>
irradiated with a light source having a peak emission wavelength of 405 ran.<br>
The phosphor emission appeared white and its CIE color coordinates were<br>
determined to be x=0.39 and y=0.42 from photometric calculations. The color<br>
coordinates are indicative of a color output which appears white to a human<br>
observer.<br>
21<br><br>
RD-28071<br>
Example 2<br>
The experiment of Example 1 was repeated, except that a radiation<br>
source had a peak emission wavelength of 380 nm and the phosphor powder<br>
blend contained a 77:23 ratio by weight of strontium pyrophosphate to SAE.<br>
The phosphor emission appeared white and its CIE color coordinates were<br>
determined to be x=0.39 and y=0.42 from photometric calculations. The color<br>
coordinates are indicative of a color output which appears white to a human<br>
observer.<br>
The preferred embodiments have been set forth herein for the purpose<br>
of illustration. However, this description should not be deemed to be a<br>
limitation on the scope of the invention. Accordingly, various modifications,<br>
adaptations, and alternatives may occur to one skilled in the art without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the claimed inventive concept.<br>
