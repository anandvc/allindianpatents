				<td>Digital data watermarking system using novel watermark<br>
insertion and detection methods<br>
The present invention relates to the field of<br>
watermarking of digital data. It relates more1<br>
particularly to a system for watermarking data using<br>
novel watermark insertion and detection methods as well<br>
as to devices for implementing these methods.<br>
Recent methods for protecting against the<br>
illicit copying of digital data use the principle of<br>
data watermarking which consists in inserting a marking<br>
item, commonly referred to as a "watermark", into a<br>
multimedia content (still image, video, sound, etc.) in<br>
an imperceptible manner. The watermark can for example<br>
be a signal indicating that the content may not be<br>
copied or any other item allowing the supplier of the<br>
multimedia content to detect illegal copies.<br>
In order to play its role perfectly, the<br>
watermark must be robust to transformations of the.<br>
watermarked content, whether these transformations be<br>
made intentionally by a pirate who wishes to erase the<br>
watermark, or whether they result from distortions<br>
which occurred during the transmission of the signal<br>
containing the watermarked data.<br>
Various data watermarking techniques are known<br>
from the prior art. Reference may in particular be made<br>
to the documents EP-A-0 828 372, EP-A-0 840 513, WO-A-<br>
98/03014 or WO-A-98/54897 which describe methods for<br>
inserting watermarks into data to be protected and<br>
methods for detecting the presence of such watermarks<br>
in the data,<br>
A scheme which is generally used to describe<br>
the principle of data watermarking is that of Figure 1.<br>
A first part 1 relates to the insertion of a hidden<br>
item W (the watermark) into a content to be protected<br>
C. This results in a watermarked content CT. Part 2<br>
relates to the detection of the presence of the item W<br>
in the content received CT. An additional datum K is<br>
also necessary in the process for inserting and<br>
detecting the watermark. This datum K which must be<br>
shared in a secret manner by the device for inserting<br>
and detecting the watermark is referred to as the key<br>
by analogy with so-called symmetric or private-key<br>
cryptography systems.<br>
For example, a known watermarking technique<br>
consists in adding a pseudo random noise sequence to<br>
data which are to be watermarked. The detection process<br>
is carried out, in this case, by performing a<br>
correlation calculation: the data received are declared<br>
watermarked if the correlation with the reference<br>
pseudo noise sequence (used for the insertion of the<br>
watermark) is greater than a given threshold. In this<br>
example, the reference pseudo noise sequence<br>
constitutes the key K of the data watermarking scheme<br>
of Figure 1.<br>
The problem with this scheme is that each<br>
entity capable of detecting the watermark must share<br>
the same key K as the entity which inserted the<br>
watermark. In this case, the entity capable of<br>
detecting the watermark can furthermore delete it or<br>
modify it, thereby doing away with all the benefit of<br>
the initial watermarking of the data. Consequently, a<br>
supplier of content protected by watermarking should<br>
not communicate his key K, which served for the<br>
insertion of the watermark, other than in a secret<br>
manner to trusted entities. This considerably limits<br>
the possibilities of using data watermarking in<br>
numerous fields.<br>
In particular, in the field of consumer<br>
electronic appliances, it is well known that it is<br>
almost impossible, at any event at reasonable cost, to<br>
store secret parameters in an appliance or in software<br>
contained in such an appliance. Smart cards, which are<br>
regarded as the only pieces of equipment allowing the<br>
secure storage of a secret parameter, are not<br>
themselves powerful enough to perform the calculations<br>
connected with a watermark detection process.<br>
In the example described above where the<br>
watermarking is carried out by adding a pseudo random<br>
noise sequence to the data which are to be watermarked,<br>
even if the reference pseudo noise sequence is stored<br>
secretly in the watermark detection device, it has been<br>
demonstrated that a pirate can theoretically discover<br>
the reference sequence and thus delete the watermark<br>
from the data by observing the output from the detector<br>
as a function of a large number of different input<br>
signals.<br>
The invention aims to solve the aforesaid<br>
problems.<br>
To this end, the invention relates to a method<br>
for inserting a watermark into data representing a<br>
content to be protected. According to the invention,<br>
the method comprises the steps consisting in:<br>
a) supplying a pseudo random noise sequence to<br>
the input of a filter with predefined impulse response;<br>
and<br>
b) adding the filtered pseudo noise sequence to<br>
the data.<br>
According to a preferred aspect of the.<br>
invention, the method furthermore comprises the steps<br>
consisting in:<br>
c) performing a pseudo random interleaving of<br>
the data before step b); and<br>
d) performing an inverse interleaving after<br>
step b) so as to obtain the watermarked data.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for<br>
detecting a watermark in data representing a content<br>
received, characterized in that it comprises the steps<br>
consisting in:<br>
i) performing a spectral analysis of the data;<br>
and<br>
ii) deducing therefrom whether the data include<br>
a pseudo noise sequence which has been filtered by a<br>
filter with predefined spectral response.<br>
According to another preferred aspect of the<br>
invention, a pseudo random interleaving of the data<br>
received, which is identical to the interleaving-<br>
performed in step c) above, is performed before step<br>
i)<br>
The invention also relates to a system for<br>
watermarking data using a watermark insertion method<br>
and a watermark detection method as those above.<br>
According to the invention, a first series of<br>
parametersr the private keyr is used for the insertion<br>
of the watermark and a second series of parameters, the<br>
public key, is used for the detection of the watermark,<br>
so that:-<br>
- knowledge of the public key does not make it<br>
possible to know the private key; and<br>
- knowledge of the method of detection and of<br>
the public key does not make it possible to delete or<br>
modify the watermark.<br>
The invention also relates to a device for<br>

Other characteristics and advantages of the<br>
invention will become apparent on reading the following<br>
description of a particular embodiment, which is non-<br>
limiting, of the invention given with reference to the<br>
appended figures, among which:<br>
- Figure 1, described previously, illustrates a<br>
known scheme for watermarking digital data;<br>
- Figure 2 schematically represents a watermark<br>
insertion device according to the invention;<br>
- Figure 3 schematically represents a watermark<br>
detection device according to the invention;<br>
- Figure 4 illustrates a novel scheme for<br>
watermarking digital data according to the invention.<br>
Represented schematically in Figure 2 is a<br>
device according to the invention for inserting a<br>
watermark into a signal representative of a content to<br>
be protected. This signal can in particular be a<br>
digital video or audio signal or else a signal<br>
representing a still image such as a photograph or a<br>
computer-calculated synthetic image, or more generally,<br>
any signal representing a multimedia content.<br>
Firstly, the content to be protected is<br>
transformed by a transformation module 10 into a<br>
sequence of digital data x = {xn}, n lying between 1<br>
and N. For example, if the content to be protected is<br>
an image comprising N pixels, the coefficients xn can<br>
correspond to the luminance of each pixel of the image.<br>
These may also be coefficients of a Discrete Fourier<br>
Transform of the signal representing the content to be<br>
protected, or else coefficients of a Fourier-Mellin<br>
Transform or coefficients of a wavelet decomposition<br>
when the content to be protected is a still image.<br>
The data sequence x representing the content to<br>
be protected is transmitted on the one hand to a module<br>
HPM 12 which outputs a modulation sequence m = {mn}, Vn<br>
e [1-N], The module HPM calculates this modulation<br>
sequence as a function of algorithms based on human<br>
perception models, such as Sarnoff's model of the eye.<br>
This sequence m = {mn} represents the maximum amount of<br>
noise which can be added to each coefficient xn without<br>
perceptible loss of quality.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the.<br>
data sequence x is transmitted moreover to an<br>
interleaver 20/ which performs a random permutation p<br>
of the coefficients xn so as to supply a sequence of<br>
interleaved coefficients x = {xP(n)}. The purpose of<br>
this interleaving of the data sequence x will be<br>
explained subsequently.<br>
The modulation sequence m is also transmitted<br>
to an interleaver 14 which performs the same<br>
permutation p of the coefficients mn as that performed<br>
by the interleaver 20 so as to output an interleaved<br>
modulation sequence m = {mp(n))}.<br>
In order to constitute the watermark which will<br>
be inserted into the data sequence x representing the<br>
content to be protected, a pseudo random noise<br>
generator (not represented} firstly supplies a pseudo<br>
noise sequence v = {vn}, "n Î [1..N], with Gaussian<br>
distribution. This pseudo noise sequence v is<br>
transmitted to the input of a filter 16/ of Linear Time<br>
Invariant (LTD type, whose impulse response is:<br>
h = {hn}, "n Î [1..L] where L is an integer<br>
corresponding to the length of the filter;<br>
and whose spectral response is H(f), H(f) being<br>
the Fourier Transform of h;<br>
At the output of the filter 16 one obtains a<br>
filtered pseudo noise sequence w = {wn}, Vn e [1..N]<br>
satisfying the following equation (1):<br>
4.In which Ä represents the convolution product.<br>
From this may be deduced, from the interference<br>
theorem, the following two equations (2) and (3):<br>
in which jw(r) and jw(r) respectively represent<br>
the auto-correlation functions of w and of v; and<br>
in which jw(f) and jw(f) respectively<br>
represent the power spectral densities of jw (r) and<br>
jw(r) , that is to say their Fourier Transforms.<br>
Since v is a pseudo random noise sequence with<br>
Gaussian distribution, its spectrum, that is to say the<br>
function jw(f), has a substantially flat shape. On the<br>
other hand, once this sequence v is filtered by the<br>
filter 16, the resulting sequence w exhibits a spectrum<br>
jw (f} which is no longer flat on account of the term<br>
|H(f) l2. It is also important to note, so as to<br>
comprehend the rest of the invention, that knowledge of<br>
|H{f) l2 (and by the same token, knowledge of the<br>
modulus of H(f):lH(f)|) does not make it possible to<br>
retrieve H(f) (and hence h) since there is an<br>
uncertainty with regard to the phase of H(f).<br>
Returning to Figure 2, the filtered pseudo<br>
noise sequence w is multiplied (multiplier 18) by the<br>
interleaved modulation sequence m and the resulting<br>
sequence, which constitutes the watermark, is added<br>
(adder 22} to the sequence of interleaved data x.<br>
The output sequence from the adder 22 is<br>
denoted y = {yP(n)} and satisfies the following<br>
equations (4) and (5):<br>
The power spectral density of the sequence of<br>
watermarked interleaved data y is qiven by the<br>
following equations (6) and (7):<br>
In equation (7), md and aj respectively<br>
represent the mean and the standard deviation of the<br>
sequence j = {jn) with j e {x, m, v}r d(f) corresponds<br>
Co the Dirac pulse and the expression is<br>
equal to a constant.<br>
The sequence of watermarked interleaved data y<br>
is then transmitted to an inverse interleaver 24 which<br>
performs the operation inverse to the permutation p<br>
performed by the interleavers 20 and 14 so as to supply<br>
a sequence of watermarked data y = {yn} whose<br>
coefficients are in the same order as the initial order<br>
of the data x = {xn}.<br>
A transformation inverse to that performed by<br>
the transformation module 10 is then performed by the<br>
module 26 so as to obtain the marked content (or<br>
watermarked content) which is thus protected against<br>
illicit copying without the watermark being perceptible<br>
within the content.<br>
We shall now describe, in conjunction with<br>
Figure 3, a device tor detecting a watermark in a<br>
received content when this watermark has been inserted<br>
into a content to be protected by a device such as that<br>
of Figure 2.<br>
The principle of the detection is based on the<br>
spectral analysis of the signal received.<br>
The signal received is representative of the<br>
received content for which one will seek to determine<br>
whether or not it is watermarked. This content is of<br>
the same type as the content to be protected described<br>
previously. In the example which follows, it will be<br>
assumed that the content received is an image<br>
containing N pixels.<br>
The content received is firstly transmitted to<br>
a transformation module 30 which performs the same<br>
transformation operation as the module 10 of the<br>
watermark insertion device of Figure 2 so as to supply<br>
a data sequence r = {rn}, Vn e [1..N] representing the<br>
content received. In our example, it is assumed that<br>
the luminances rn of the pixels of the image received<br>
are obtained as output from the transformation module<br>
30.<br>
If the content received were to correspond<br>
exactly to the watermarked content emanating from the<br>
device of Figure 2, that is to say if no transformation<br>
or distortion of the signal had taken place during<br>
transmission between the watermark insertion device and<br>
the detection device, then one would have:<br>
r = {rn} = y = {yn}<br>
In practice, this is not always the case since<br>
the signal sometimes undergoes transformations during<br>
its. transmission.<br>
Since the watermark has been inserted, in the<br>
device of Figure 2, into a sequence of interleaved data.<br>
x, the data sequence r will, in order to detect the<br>
possible presence of a watermark in the content<br>
received, be transmitted to an interleaver 32<br>
performing the same permutation p of the coefficients<br>
ra as that performed by the interleavers 20 and 14 of<br>
Figure 2.<br>
A sequence of interleaved data r = {rp(n)} is<br>
obtained as output from the interleaver 32.<br>
It was seen previously that when the watermark<br>
inserted is a pseudo noise sequence filtered by a<br>
filter with impulse response h and with spectral<br>
response H(f), the power spectral density of the<br>
(interleaved) data obtained y is expressed by relations<br>
(6) and (7).<br>
The purpose of the interleaving of the data<br>
sequence x and of the modulation sequence m will now be<br>
apparent. Indeed, if the data sequence x represents the<br>
pixels of an image/ its spectral density has a very<br>
Structured shape with very large amplitude differences.<br>
The role of the interleaving of the data is to sever<br>
the statistical coherence of this sequence so that the<br>
spectral density of the sequence of interleaved data x<br>
has a substantially flat shape, such as that of a<br>
pseudo noise sequence with Gaussian distribution.<br>
Thus, if a watermark consisting of a pseudo<br>
noise sequence filtered by a filter with spectral<br>
response H(f) is added to this interleaved sequence, a<br>
data sequence is obtained whose power spectral density<br>
can be expressed by relation (7) in which the<br>
significant term |H(f)I2 can be detected.<br>
The principle of the detection will therefore<br>
be based on the spectral analysis of the sequence r and<br>
on a Maximum Likelihood Ratio Hypothesis test (MLR<br>
Hypothesis test), the hypothesis tested being the<br>
following: if the sequence of interleaved data r<br>
contains noise, is it noise which has been filtered by<br>
a filter whose spectral response has a modulus similar<br>
to lH(f)(? If the response is yes, one will deduce<br>
from this that the noise present in the sequence r is a<br>
watermark and, in the contrary case, one will conclude<br>
from this that the content received was not<br>
watermarked.<br>
In practice, this analysis is based on<br>
calculations relating to spectral analysis and the<br>
likelihood testing of hypotheses which are described in<br>
detail in the work by K. Dzhaparidze, "Parameter<br>
Estimation and Hypothesis Testing in Spectral Analysis<br>
of Stationary Time Series"/ Springer Series in<br>
Statistics, Springer-Verlag, 1986, to which reference<br>
may be made for further details.<br>
Returning to Figure 3, the sequence of received<br>
interleaved data r is transmitted to a module 34<br>
performinq a Periodogram calculus. This calculus is<br>
aimed at estimating the power spectral density of the<br>
sequence r. A quantity IN(f) given by the following<br>
relation (8)<br>
is obtained at output.<br>
This quantity is then transmitted to a module<br>
36 performing a MLR Hypothesis test so as to determine<br>
whether the content received is watermarked (output<br>
response "Y") or not (output response "N").<br>
The module 36 tests the likelihood of two<br>
hypotheses:<br>
- according to the first hypothesis Go, the<br>
content received is not watermarked/ hence the spectral<br>
density of the sequence r is substantially flat and can<br>
be estimated via the following relation (9):<br>
- according to the second hypothesis G1, the<br>
content received is watermarked and the spectral<br>
density of the sequence r can be estimated via the<br>
following relation (10):<br>
in which C is a constant and av is equal to 1<br>
(one preferably chooses the pseudo noise sequence v at<br>
the level of the insertion device so that av is equal<br>
to 1, but one may equally choose other values),<br>
Furthermore, fim is normed at the level of the insertion<br>
device and equals for example 3,<br>
To estimate the likelihood of the hypotheses GQ<br>
and G1, the module 36 calculates two numbers UN,0(r) and<br>
UN,1(r) representing the likelihoods of the hypotheses<br>
Go and Gx according to the following relation (11) :<br>
By then comparing these two numbers, the module<br>
36 deduces from this:<br>
if UN,i(r )&gt;UN,o(r), then the response of the<br>
detector is "Y" signifying that the content received is<br>
watermarked; and<br>
- if UK,i(r)<umfo then the response of></umfo>
detector is "N" signifying that the content received is<br>
not watermarked.<br>
It is also possible, in a preferential manner,<br>
to calculate the difference (UN,l ( r } -UN,0 (r }) and to<br>
perform the above comparisons only if this difference<br>
is greater than a predetermined threshold, this being<br>
so as to guarantee better exactness of detection.<br>
The watermark insertion and detection methods<br>
just described with reference to Figures 2 and 3 make<br>
it possible to produce a novel watermarking system<br>
which is illustrated by Figure 4. In this novel system<br>
and according to a preferred aspect of the invention, a<br>
parameter which is referred to as the "private key" KPRi<br>
is used for the insertion (100) of a watermark W into a<br>
content C, whereas another parameter which is referred<br>
to as the "public key" KPUB is used for the detection<br>
(200) of a watermark in a content received CT. The<br>
terms "private key" and "public key" are used by<br>
analogy with public key crytographic systems; It will<br>
be noted that here the watermark W is binary, that is<br>
to say that, either the content C is watermarked, or it<br>
is not, but W does not contain any item of its own.<br>
In the embodiment described above, the private<br>
key Kpm is formed by the pseudo random noise sequence v<br>
as well as by the impulse response h of the filter 16<br>
(Fig. 2) . The sequences v = {vn} and h = {hn} are in<br>
effect indispensable to the calculation of the sequence<br>
w = {wn} which is itself, after having been multiplied<br>
fey the interleaved modulation sequence m, inserted<br>
into the data representing the content to be protected.<br>
The public key used to detect the watermark in<br>
the content received is for its part formed from the<br>
modulus of the spectral response of the filter 16<br>
IH(£)' Indeed/ in the spectral analysis calculations<br>
performed (modules 34 and 36 of Figure 3) to detect the<br>
presence of a watermark in a content received CT, only<br>
the knowledge of lH(f) I is necessary. In particular, it<br>
is not necessary to know v and h (the private key) to<br>
perform the detection of the watermark. In actual fact,<br>
as was seen earlier in the description, the knowledge<br>
of IH(f)) does not suffice to know H(f) and hence h.<br>
A system is therefore obtained in which<br>
knowledge of the public key does not make it possible<br>
to deduce the private key from this. Also, not knowing<br>
the private key, it is impossible for the device<br>
performing the detection of the watermark to delete it<br>
or to modify it. The detection can therefore be<br>
performed in a non-secure environment with no risk of<br>
the watermark being erased.<br>
