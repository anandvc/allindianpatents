Tower for Wind fcnergy Plant<br><br>
Modern wind energy plants arc mostly constructed with pipe towers, especially steel pipe<br>
towers, as this shell type construction is the simplest and most economic lower design.  In<br>
large wind energy plants with more than 70 m rotor diameter and more than 80 in lower<br>
height, as well as a capacity of over 1.5 MW, the required tower diameter in the lower<br>
tower region is an important technical limitation.  Diameters of more than 4.3 m can only<br>
be transported with dilticulty. as often the drive through height under bridges allow only<br>
smaller measurements. Furthermore, the total length and the dimensions of the to was<br>
requirc division into several tower sections that are bolted to one another by a ring flange<br>
joint. The large ring flange joints in lowers for very large wind energy plants (3 - 5<br>
MW), apart from the logistics of transportation, also involve a significant tost factor.<br>
Therefore, on account of transportation difficulties, one is increasingly using concrete<br>
towers, which are either manufactured at the erection site of the wind energy plant or<br>
consist of small individual units that are adhered to one another and braced. Both types<br>
of towers are however significantly more expensive to manufacture than steel pipe<br>
towers.  Due to this reason, even individual steel pipe -/concrete hybrid towers are built.<br>
in which the upper tower portion is constructed, as far as possible, as steel pipe tower,<br>
and only the lower tower part having dimensions that are too large for transportation is<br>
made of concrete. In this construction form however, the transition from steel tower to<br>
concrete lower has proved to be technically complex and cost-intensive.<br>
Besides, there are the widely known grid towers as current masts that are already being<br>
used for large wind energy plants up to a height of 114 m and a capacity of 2 MW. Apart<br>
from the advance of smooth transportation, these towers however have the important<br>
dteadvantage. that they have sinificantly larger hoizontal extensions than a comparable<br>
steel pipe tower or concrete tower, which frequently poses problems with the required<br>
distance between rotor blade tip and lower (blade free flow),  If the rotor blade bends<br>
through heavily in a storm. there exits the danger of towcr contact, which is very<br>
dangerous for the emtire construction.<br><br>
2<br>
On the other hand, the larger horizontal extension of the grid tower allows an altogether<br>
more effective material utilisation. This generally known advantage of expert design<br>
allows smaller total dimensions and hence alfeta a lower purchase prica. This economic<br>
advantage however is neutralised generally by the costs incurred in maintenance of the<br>
grid lowers over their life span of 20 years. For example, the bolt joints in the highly<br>
dynamic loaded lowers in wind energy plants have to be periodically checked, which in<br>
the case of grid lowers having a large height implies an activity that is dangerous, time<br>
consuming and physically demanding, that can be carried out only by extremely<br>
specialized people used to working at heights.<br>
From the documents DE PS 736 454 and DE 198 02 210 Al it is known that the tower<br>
can have an upper and lower tower section, whereby the lower tower section is designed<br>
as grid tower and the upper tower section as pipe-type.<br>
Here however, problems occur with respect to the transition from a shell construction<br>
(pipe tower) to a special design (grid tower), as this is technically very demanding. In<br>
existing grid towers for wind energy plants therefore, generally a relatively short pipe-<br>
shaped component, the so-called 'cup", is used only indirectly under the machine car;<br>
this allows the transition to the machine car provided with a ring flange. There the<br>
transition is generally realised, in that four comer posts of the grid tower are screwed on<br>
to the cup directly on the outer side by means of bun strap joints. This concept is<br>
possible because the tower is subjected to only relatively low bending loads directly<br>
under the car. Thus, in this case, mainly only the horizontal (acting as transverse force of<br>
the tower) rotor thrust has to be transmitted. Further below, where the tower is mainly<br>
loaded by the bending moment acting from the rotor thrust though the lever arm of the<br>
tower length, such a design is not possible in a cost-effective manner,<br>
It is therefore the task of this Invention to present a lower design for large wind energy<br>
plams. which eliminates the disadvantages of the staic-of-the-art technology, particularly<br><br>
3<br>
with respect to the transportability, the cost-effectiveness, the maintenance and the blade<br>
This task is fulliledd with the help of a lower for a wind energy plant having the features<br>
as mentioned in vlaim 1.<br>
As is known from the state-of-the-art technology, the tower according to the invention<br>
consist of an upper pipe-shaped tower section as wall as the lower tower section that is<br>
designed as grid lower with at least three comer poles.  Both tower sections are connected<br>
to one another in a transition region, whereby the dimensions of the upper tower section<br>
in the transition region are designed clearly leaser than the dimensions of the lower towcr<br>
section in the transition region.<br>
According to the invention. it is foreseen that the upper tower section is designed to form<br>
at least one sixth of the total tower. This offers the advantage that in the upper region of<br>
the tower a favourably standard design can be used.<br>
Besides that, the torsion loads occurring in the upper tower section are significantly<br>
higher than in the lower tower section on account of the smaller cross-section. As a pipe<br>
tower has high torsion rigidity, the torsion forces occurring can be better absorbed than<br>
by a grid tower.<br>
As already explained above, the transition from the lower to the upper tower section<br>
poses, a problem. The reason is, that the force flow from the pipe cross-section of the<br>
upper tower section has to be passed on to the three or even four corner poles of the lower<br>
lower section. The simplest solution would be a plate to which the upper and the lower<br>
tower sections are fixed. However, such a plate would have the disadvantage that the<br>
plate would have to have large measurements in order to withstand the loads coming into<br>
play, which again would translate into significantly more expenses.<br><br>
4<br>
According in the invention. it is also foreseen that the cross-section of the lower tower<br>
section below the transition region is greater than the cross-section of the upper tower<br>
section, whereby however the transition region is deigned in such a way, that a force-<br>
flow-optimised adaptation of the cross-section of thc lower lower section to the cross-<br>
secntion of the upper to war section takes place. The invention thus offer the advantage<br>
that a transition region is foreseen. that is designed in such away that thc force flow from<br>
the upper to this lower tower section is conducted in an optimum manner, so that the<br>
entire transition region does not have to be designed in an over dimensioned manner.<br>
The synergy of the above-mentioned features of the invention leads to an optimally<br>
designed lower   The tower according to the invention has a standard tower in its upper<br>
region, In the lower tower section, which for example cannot be designed as pipe lower<br>
on account of its measurements, as it would then not be transportable, the tower<br>
according to the invention has a grid tower design. The prevision of a grid tower section<br>
in a wind energy plant erected offshore additionally has a big advantage that it offers<br>
lesser contact surface for the shaft loads than a pipe tower. The adapted transition region<br>
leads to a grid tower section whose comer poles and struts have lesser wall thickness, so<br>
that the dimensions of the lower and hence the costs for the tower, that account for a<br>
significant cost factor with respect to the total wind energy plant, gets reduced.<br>
Each comer pole can have an inclination with respect to the vertical axis of the tower that<br>
can be sdected in such a way that in case of a desired extension of the corner poles their<br>
longitudinal axes cross at a virtual intersection point. it is advantageous to design the<br>
tower according to this invention in such a way. that the virtual intersection point of the<br>
comer poles lies in the region above the transition region, which starting from the car can<br>
stretch over one-third of the tower length upwards of downwards. as the comer poles<br>
would thus be stressed mainly by normal forces and not by binding.<br>
Generally, grid towers have sinits between the corner poles for addition absorption of<br>
forces coming into play. By arranging the intersection point in the upper region of the<br>
wind energy plant, it is achieved that the force flow takes place predominantly through<br><br>
5<br>
the corner poles and the force flow pussing though the siruts is significantly lower. In<br>
this way the loads occurring in the struts can be imimized, whereby the struts could have<br>
smaller dimensions. i,e. the wall thickness of the struts can be selected lesser, whereby<br>
again the volume of weeding scams on thc leg connections can be reduced (cost saving).<br>
According to an advantageous extension of this invention, the transition region is<br>
designed  in such a way that the cross-section of the lower lower section tapers-to the<br>
cross-section of the upper tower section and conforms to a length that it is at least hair the<br>
pipe tower diameter.<br>
According to further advantageous extension of the invention, the transition region is<br>
formed by a transition piece that is designed in such a way, that the horizontal extension<br>
in the lower region is significantly greater than the extension in the upper region. The<br>
bends thus occurring in the outer contour of the tower actually contradict general design<br>
rules, as particularly in the shell type constuction any kind of bend leads to increases in<br>
stress that could weaken the bearing structure. However, with the help of the pleasures<br>
mentioned in the sub-claims it is possible to neutralize the undisputed disadvantages of<br>
both the bending, points or to completely avoid the bending points, in order to fully utilize<br>
the advantages of the hybrid type construction according to the invention.<br>
In the state-of-the-art technology, such bends in the shell type construction are known<br>
from only very small wind energy plants, in which thy stress optimisation has never<br>
played any sigrnificant role. Instead, in the forefront was thc production technology that<br>
enabled joining of two pipe diameters easily available in the mariiet in a very simple<br>
manner. In such small machines (capacity below 300 KW), partly even available short<br>
pipe towers \were mounted on. lower parts made of pipes with larger diameters with the<br>
help of highly conical transition pieces.<br>
In modern wind energy plants with capacities greater than I MW, only pipe towers with<br>
slight bends (max- 5 - 8º) are economic in the state-of-the-art technology, whereby the<br>
bend is basically situated relatively close below the machine car. This design, know from<br><br>
6<br>
the document F.P 0821161.and referred to as "double conical pipe tower" mainly allows<br>
use of a large fastening flange on the joint position to the machine car and furthermore.<br>
serves thc purpose of adaptation of the self-frequency of the components to the<br>
rcquircments.<br>
According, to a further advantageous extension of the invention, it is a great advantage vo<br>
design the transition between the upper and lower lower section (if required, directly)<br>
below the horizolal plane, that is defined by the rotor blade tip when the rotor blade is<br>
standing vertically below. This measure allows us to avoid all the disadvantages present<br>
in the state-of-the-art technology in a simple manner.<br>
In the upper tower section, on account of the design as pipe tower, the requirements of a<br>
slim construction with cost-effectiveness not achieved so far is fulfilled, but also the<br>
simple maintainability with weather-protected risers and working space is significantly<br>
advantageous for the great height. As soon as the pipe tower reaches its transportation<br>
limits, the grid tower is used in the lower tower section beJow the level of the blade tip.<br>
With Us significantly greater horizontal extension this could facilitate material savings<br>
and hence also greater cost-effectiveness. The maintenance problem in the lower tower<br>
section is less important, as in the state-of-the-art technology one has hoist risers that<br>
allow accessibility for the maintenance personnel in the lower tower region in a simple<br>
and yet safe and comfortable manner.<br>
A further disadvantage of the grid towers, that has to be taken into account in winter<br>
when the large surface of the special design gets covered by ice and leads to additional<br>
mass is greatly reduced, as the addition mass now acts only on lower tower sections that<br>
are statically and dynamically much less critical.<br>
Due to the mentioned reasons it is advantageous to design the transition region at a<br>
distance from the rotor axis that could be 1.0 - 1.6 times, especially 1,0 - 1.3 times the<br>
rotor radius.<br><br>
7<br>
in order to facilitate the transportability) May of the transition. piece, it is of particular<br>
advantage to design the upper region of the transition piece in such a way, that while<br>
asscmbling the wind energy plant at the erection site it can be joined with the upper tower<br>
section, preferably by means of a detachable joint.<br>
Similarly it is also particularly advantageous to design the lower region of the transition<br>
picte in such a way, that the transition piece can be connetted to each corner pole of the<br>
grid tower by means of a detachable joint.<br>
It can also be advantageous it in addition to the corner poles, also a few struts are bolted<br>
with the lower region of the transition piece.<br>
The flange joint in the pipe tower should be categorised as particularly critical, as<br>
experiences with steel pipe-/concrete hybrid towers have shown.<br>
Therefore, another design form of the invention foresees that the detachable joint<br>
between the upper region of the transition piece and the upper tower section has an inner-<br>
lying double row boh flange as joint on the transition piece and a matching T-flange<br>
arranged on the upper lower section.<br>
Equipping this joint position with a large dimensioned double row flange additionally<br>
provides the advantage, that the flange simultaneously also serves as dent brace for the<br>
force deflection occurring in the bending point of the outer contour. In this way, the<br>
danger of a dent being caused by excessive stress is eliminated effectively to a great<br>
extent.<br>
The lower region of the transition piece is preferably designed in such a way. that it has<br>
joining points for butt strap joints to the corner poles of the grid tower.<br><br>
8<br>
As the lower grid tower gets the load of a significant additional mass due to the upper<br>
pipe tower. it is extremely advantageous to design the corner poles of the grid masts as<br>
hollow profile in order to prevent buckling due to the weight load of the pipe tower.<br>
The transition piece is further designed in such a manner, that the allowable<br>
transportation height is maintained by the structural height of the transition piece. The<br>
maximum possible iransportation height, on account of the limited drive-through height<br>
tinder bridges, is generally 4.3 m in Germany; in selected stretches even 5.5 m high goods<br>
can be transported.<br>
If in case of very large, wind energy plants (e.g. 3-5 MW capacity) transportation of the<br>
transition piece in one piece is not possible on account of the measurements, then for<br>
such cases an extension of this invention provides for design of the transition piece in at<br>
least two part-pieces joined to one mother in a detachable manner at the joining point.<br>
The joining, can. be done by ball flanges or butt strap joints; even welding of the part<br>
pieces at the construction site could be art economic solution, if the joining points are<br>
placed in zones, having less load.<br>
In this case, the transition piece can be divided into at least two part-pieces through a<br>
vertical division plane. Division into a number of identical pan-pieces conforming to the<br>
number of corner poles of the grid towers should be regarded as particularly cost-<br>
effective due to production-technical reasons.<br>
Another advantageous extension of the invention provides for a division of the transition<br>
piece in at least one horizontal division plane.<br>
Of course, in case of particularly large wind energy plants, even both division<br>
possibilities can be combined with one another.<br>
In order to fully utilise the maximum permissible transportation height to the greatest<br>
estent possible, an advantageous extension of the invention provides for a design of the<br><br>
9<br>
transition piese or the part-piece of the Transition piece in such a way, that it can be<br>
transported as boiler bridge with the help of adapter pieces that arc mounted on the<br>
available joining points or points that are created for this purpose.<br>
Dcpending on the measurement and weight of the transition piece or the part-picces of<br>
the transition piece, the transportation of several transition pieces or part pieces joined to<br>
one another directly or indirectly (through adapter pieces) can be foreseen in a boiler<br>
bride. This offers ihe possibility of bolting the part-pieces of a two-part transition piece<br>
having a very great structural height at the (half) ring flanges and then to transport it in a<br>
lying position as boiler bridge, adhering to the permissible transportation height.<br>
According to a design form as per the invention the transition piece can be designed in a<br>
particularly efficient manner, if it has a waiting and is finished in shell-type constuction.<br>
It is of particular advantage, if the basic shape of the transition piece largely conforms to<br>
a highly conical pipe whose average inclination of the wall to the centre axis is greater<br>
than the inclination of the wall to the lower region of the pipe tower and/or than the<br>
inclination of the upper region of the corner poles of the grid towers.<br>
The average inclination is defined as the angle between the vertical (even the centre line)<br>
and an imaginary line from the maximum horizotal extension in the upper region of the<br>
transition piece to the maximum horizontal extension in the lower region.<br>
In order to realize the strong expansion of the horizontal extension of the tower in the<br>
transition piece as per the invention, with respetf to the force flow, in a particularly<br>
advantageous manner, the average inclination of the wall of the transition piece to the<br>
centre axis should be 15°. preferably more than 25°.<br>
While using the conical pipe us basic shape of the transition piece, one can think of any<br>
random pipe cross-section, i.e. triangular rectangular, multi-cornered (e.g, ] 6-comered)<br><br>
10<br>
or event mund cross-sections. The invention further comprises of exelusvety conical<br>
pipes whose cross-section shape changes over the length.<br>
In a particularly advantageous extension, the cross-section of the transition piece changes<br>
from an almost Circular cross- section in the upper region. flowing into an almost multi-<br>
cotnered. prefecrably triangular or rectangular cross-section in the lower region. Almost<br>
round could also mean here multi-cornered. e,g. 16-cornered.<br>
If the joining to the pipe lower takes place through a ring flange, then with the help of<br>
this the transilion from the say l6-cornered transition piece to the round pipe tower can<br>
If at least the lower part of the pipe tower is also designed as multi-cornered, then the<br>
joining can also take place without any problems with the help of a butt strap joint. In<br>
case of different inclination of the side surfaces of the transition piece to the wall of the<br>
pipe tower, if required, in this case an additional dent brace has lo be provided.<br>
For saving on material and weight, it is particularly advantageous if the wall of the<br>
transition piece is provided with at least one recess. By skilfully shaping the recesses it is<br>
possible to improve the force flow as compared to the version without recesses. This<br>
holds good particularly for arch-shaped recesses that stretch from comer pole to corner<br>
pole.<br>
Further optimisation of the force flow can be achieved with the help of bulb-shaped or<br>
door frame shaped reinforcements at the edges of the arch-shaped recesses.<br>
For increasing the rigidity of the transition picce it is advantageous, if in thc lower region<br>
of the transition piece horizontal beams are formed between the comer poles of the grid<br>
tower, which join thc adjacent corner poles and/or the diagonally opposite comer poles<br>
with one another.<br>
These horizontal beams can be joined to the transition piece as a single piece, or even<br>
fastened through the butt strap joint between transition piece and corner poles.<br><br>
11<br>
Similarly, for increasing the rigidity of the transition piece, another extension of the<br>
invention provides for a design with libs iti a version with at least four corner poles; these<br>
ribs reinforce the joining lines of diagonally opposite corner poles.<br>
In a particularly advantageous design form, the transation piece is finished as cast<br>
component.<br>
The shaping flexibility of cast components allows a Shaping in such a way. that by means<br>
of soft, rounded transitions the stress excesses in the bending point of the welded steel<br>
construction variant can be avoided.<br>
A design particularly compatible for the force flow is achieved, if the wall of the<br>
transition piece is convexly bent when viewed in vertical section, as such a particularly<br>
smooth transition from the flange in the upper region to the corner poles in the lower<br>
region is achievable.<br>
Especially the inclination of the joining points in the lower region of the transition piece<br>
should he particularly designed in such a way that it conforms to the inclination of thc<br>
upper region of the comer poles of the grid towers.<br>
The cast design is also particularly advantageous in cast of multi-part transition pieces<br>
with vertical division planes, as in that case 4 identical cast parts are combined to form a<br>
transition piece (number effect).  Casting materials preferred for the casting variant are<br>
steel casting or ball graphite casting, e.g. GGG 40.3.<br>
If the tower according to the invention is constructed with lesser number of pieces, then<br>
the finish of the transition piece as welding design is of particular advanuge, as the high<br>
costs incurred for form construction of the casting design is no longer applicable.<br><br>
12<br>
In the case of convcntional Lowers, as the transition to thc concrete base is often executed<br>
similarly with V-flanges, an advantageous extension of the invention provides a modular<br>
towcr construction series with the help of the hybird concept according to the invention.<br>
in which an existing pipe tower (e.g. a 80 m-lower for a 1.5 to 2 M W machine) with the<br>
help of the transition piece according to the invention is placed on under-parts in the grid<br>
towcr construction system of various heights. e,g. 30. 50 and 70 m high, in order to<br>
achieve total lower heights of 110, 130 and 150 m depending on the Silc location. In this<br>
way, even sites in interior, remote regions, considered as uneconomic till now, can also<br>
be considered for economic wind energy utilisation.<br>
According to another advantageous extension of the invention, the lower tower section<br>
designed as grid tower has several platforms arranged above one another, whereby a<br>
platform comprises of the corner poles and at least one strut running diagonally between<br>
the comer poles.<br>
According to a further advantageous extension of the invention, the inclination of the<br>
diagonally running strul in all platforms is designed identically, so that on account of the<br>
same inclination of the strut the joining points between the legs and struts are designed<br>
identical. This extension offers the advantage, that for joining the corner poles and the<br>
struts, identical nodes can be used. In this way, the structure of the tower can be<br>
optimised. Till now. the comer poles and the struts were adapted to one another while<br>
mounting together and then Welded in a very complicated marker.<br>
In comparison to welded nodal points, casting nodes can be designed much more<br>
compactly and hence in a more economic manner. Due to reasons of stability, welded<br>
nodal points should generally be finished in such a way, that welding seams do not<br>
overlap. This frequently calls for an extension of the nodes in the region of the pipe<br>
transitions, which is not necessary in case of a casting finish. For further improving the<br>
economic viability, between the modes ons can use standard pipe profiles, e.g. from<br>
pipeline construction, as comer poles or even as diagonal struts. The joining can be done<br>
either by bolt flange or by welded joints.<br><br>
13<br>
1, sing identical nodes offers the advantage that the notes can be produced be forehand<br>
and thc corner poles and the struts have to be welded or bulled during composition of<br>
luwer only in the nodal points. This means a significant reduction in workload during<br>
construction of grid tower. Besides there could be significant savings in costs during<br>
the production of identical nodes, on account of the series effect.<br>
Especially in offshore plants that have a grid towei, additional pipes will have to be<br>
provided for laying the cables for power connections.  In offshore plants this offers an"<br>
additional contact surface for shalts, whereby additional loads act on the grid tower.<br>
Therefore. according to an advantageous extension of the invention, the cables for<br>
connectine the wind energy plant to the electrical supply mains are laid in the comer<br>
poles of the grid lower section, whereby one can achieve reduction of shaft loads,<br>
According to another advantageous extension of thc invention. cable protection pipes are<br>
pre-laid within the corner platforms, within which the cables run. These should<br>
preferably be finished as plastic pipes, and allow smooth drawing-in of the cables after<br>
the tower has been, erected, and anchored on the seabud.<br>
Further features, aspects and advantages of the invention are revealed partly through the<br>
following description and partly explained by the description or can be seen in the<br>
practical application of the invention. Two design forms of the invention are explained in<br>
details. It is obvious that other design forms can be used and changes effected without<br>
leaving he scope of this invention. Therefore, the following detailed description should<br>
not be viewed in a restricted sense; even details of both design forms can be exchanged as<br>
desired.<br>
The invention is supposed to be described in details on the basis of the following<br>
diagrams.<br>
The following are shown:<br><br>

Fig.5:   Development of the wall of the transition piece from fig. 4.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the depiction of a wind energy plant as in the state-of-the-art technology, in<br>
which as supporting lower (10) two tower variants, a pipe tower (10A) and a grid lower<br>
(IOB), are projected above one another. The tower (10) supports a machine car (30)<br>
fixed in a binged manner around the vertical tower axis, on which a rotor (20) with at<br>
least one rotor blade (22) with a blade tip (23) is pivoted around an almost horizontal<br>
axis. Here a design as, three-blade-rotor is shown, whereby the horizontal plane of the<br>
rotor blade lip (23) in the lower position is marked by a dished line (25).<br>
Apart from the rotor bearing, the machine car (30) generally contains a generator, if<br>
required a gear system, a wind follow-up system, various electrical components and<br>
additional auxiliary systems. These elements are not shown due to reasons of better<br>
overview.<br>
Due to transportation reasons, the pipe tower (10) has several flange joints 12A. These<br>
flange joints arc designed in the state-of-the-art technology as single-sided ring flanges<br>
gcnerally pointing inwards. Only the lowest flange acting as transition to the base (18A)<br>
is designed in the state-of-the-art technology as T-flange (double row flange pointing<br><br>
inwards and outwards).<br>
In a design variant as grid lower (10B). the transition to the ring-shaped flange of the<br>
machine car is generally realised by means of a relatively short transition piece (14B)<br>
known an cup. The grid lower rests on bascs (18B) generally designed individually for<br>
each corner pole (HB).<br><br>
15<br><br>
From the towcr variams. pipe lower (10) A) and grid tower (10B). projecting above one<br>
another it can X very clearly seen in the level of thc rotor blade tips (25) that the<br>
distance of the blade up to thc anker blade free run) in case of grid tower (I0B) is very<br>
much lesser and hence is more critical than in the case of the pipe tower (I0A).<br>
Fig. 2 shows the total view of the wind energy plant with a tower design according to the<br>
invention. As in fig. 1. (20) denotes the rotor and (30) denotes the machine car.  in thc<br>
lowen section (41) the lower (40) consists of a grid lower (42) that is equipped in the<br>
shown design example with four comer poles (43) and a large number of diagonal struts<br>
(44), and in the upper section (46) is consists of a largely pipe-shaped pipe tower (47).<br>
Joining of the grid tower (42) and the pipe tower (47) takes place in a transition region<br>
that is designed in such a way, that a force-flow-optimised adaptation of the cross-section<br>
of the grid tower to the pipe tower takes place. Here, by force-flow -optimised adaptation<br>
one refers to a design finish that either creates a smooth geometric transition between the<br>
different crosa-section forms of the upper and lower tower section by means of a<br>
continuous change in geometry, and thus avoids stress peaks in the transition region,<br>
and/or diverts stress peaks in the transition region through suitable ribs and/or struts in<br>
the joining design. The pre-requisite for force-flow optimum transition in the erected<br>
        condition is a vertical length of the transition region of at least the length of the radius of<br>
the lower pipe lower diameter and/or application of bearing elements (shells, ribs, struls)<br>
that essentially join the corner poles of the lower grid mast with the wall of the upper<br>
pipe tower.<br>
In the design example shown, the transition region is designed in such a way, that directiy<br>
below he horizontal plane (25) of the rotor blade lip (23) a transition piece (50) is<br>
arranged. whose horizontal extension in the lower region (70) is significantly greater (by<br>
more than 50%) than in the upper region (60).<br><br>
16<br>
The upper tower section (46) has in the lower region an (slight) inclination of the pipe<br>
wall it the vertical which is denoted by a. In an analogous manner, the inclination of<br>
the uppcr region of the corner pole (43) of the grid to wet (42) in the lower tower section<br>
(4) is; denoted by b.<br>
For as  optimum grid tower section, the corner poles (45) have an inclination that is<br>
selected in such a manner, that the corner  poles (43), in ease of a desired extension of the<br>
corner poles (43) (shown in fig, 2 by a dashed line). meet at a virtual intersection point<br>
VS. The position of the virtual intersection poim is arrangcd in the shown design<br>
example in a region that, viewed from the car, extends downward by one-third of the<br>
lower length. Depending on the combination of the tramsverse force and bending moment<br>
in the dimensioned load case, the optimum virtual intersection point can lie above the car.<br>
The average inclination of the transition piece (50) that is defined as the angle between<br>
the vertical and an imaginary line from the maximum horizontal extension in the upper<br>
region (50) to the maximum horizontal extension in the lower region (70), is denoted by<br>
X<br>
h\ the siovm design form of ihe invention, that is piailit\iiady advantageous, ^ is<br>
significantly greater than the inclination ({J) ol'the lower tower section (41) as well JIS the<br>
inclination (tit) of the upper tower section.<br>
However, it is also conceivable that the individual corner poles are bent and hence have<br>
different inclinations, whweby h^re too an average inclination of the corner poles<br>
analogojus to the transition piece can be defined.<br>
Fig. 3 shows &amp; detailed depletion of a possible design variant of trie tower according to:<br>
the inve ilitin, with a transition piece as muJti-part casting construction. To the right of<br>
ihi; svmmeln line the side view is ahviwrv. on the laft sida is itwi depittion in {vertical)<br>
actiion. The \wcr tower section is fonrted by the grid tow^r (42) Lhat is shown sectioned<br><br>
17<br>
and mainly consists of four corner pales (43) and the diagonal struts (44). The upper<br>
lower  section is formed by the shown sectioned pipe tower (47) with its wall (48).<br>
A version of the transition piece (50) according to the invention is designed as casting<br>
contraction in shell type construction with a wall (52) and arch-shaped recesses (53).<br>
The transition piece is joined in the upper region (60) to the pipe lower (47) by a flange<br>
joint (61) and in the lower region (70) to the comer poles (43) of the grid tower (42) by<br>
four butt strap joints (71).<br>
In the upper region (60) of the transition piece (50) the wall (52) smoothly flows into a<br>
ring-shaped, double row boll flange (64). The wall (48) of the pipe tower (47) is welded<br>
with a T-flange (62). which is bolted through an inner bolts circle (63) and an outer bolts<br>
circle (68) to the flange (64) of the transition piece (50). The inner bolt joint (66) is<br>
executed as a penetrating bolt joint generally used in steel construction. the outcr bolt<br>
joint (48) is designed in the shown example as blind hole bolt joint, because in this way a<br>
wall thickness distribution of the wall (52) that is particularly favourable for the force-<br>
flow is possible. Obviously the wail (52) of live transition picce (50) can also be drawn<br>
out somewhat further outwards, so that even the outer bolt joint (68) can be executed as a<br>
penetrating bolt joint; however, in that case the transition piece (50) will become<br>
some what heavier and hence costlier.<br>
In the lower region (70) the wall (52) runs across four joining points (72) to the comer<br>
poles (43). The joint is done as butt strap joint (7l) through an outer strap (76) and an<br>
inner strap (78) that are screwed with several bolts to the joining points (72) and the<br>
corner poles (43). As the inclination of the joining points (72) and the inclination of the<br>
tipper re gion. of the comer pole (411 are identical., smooth platcs can be used as joining<br>
straps (76, 78).<br>
With a view to reducing, the number of parts, yet another design form of the invention has<br>
a direct rolled joint joining the comer poles (43) with the joining points (72) of the<br><br>
18<br>
transition picce (50). Howere. in this design form, the force flow from the corner pule<br>
(43) into the wall (52) of the transition piece (50) is somewhat more favourable.<br>
For rein forcing the lower region (70) of the transition piece (50). horizontal beams (45)<br>
are fixed between thc comer poles (43). These beams could join either the adjacent<br>
corner poles (43) or the opposite corner poles (43) and hence the diagonals of the grid<br>
lower (42) to one another.   If required even both possibilities can be used together in<br>
order to facilitate a particularly rigid and hence advantageous construction.<br>
Joining of the diagonal struts (44) and the horizontal beams (45) to the butt strap joints<br>
(71) is not shown due to reasons of simplicity. Such joints are however very well known<br>
in the state-of-the-art technology, e.g. for joining multi-part comer poles.<br>
For an outer diameter of the T-flange (62) of the pipe tower (47) of 4.3 m the shown<br>
transition piece (50) shows a transportation height of similarly above 4,3 m with a lower<br>
transpanation width of about 7 m. A these measurements can only be transported in a<br>
      restricted manner, another preferred design form of the invention provides for a multi-<br>
part desing of the transition piece (50). For this, the transition piece (50) is divided into a<br>
left part-piece (57) and a right part-piece (58) through a vertical division plane. The part<br>
pieces (57, 58) are boiled with one another by bolt flanges (56). As an alternative to the<br>
bolt flange (56), another advantageous extension of the invention provites butt strap<br>
joints for joining the part-pieces (57, 58) of the transition piece (50).<br>
By means of the division, the transportation dimensions for transportation in a lying<br>
condition for both part-pieces (57, 58) get reduced to a transportation height of about 2.5<br>
m for a width of 4.3 m, whereby within Germany transportation is possible without any<br>
problems.<br>
Another advantageous extension of the invention provides for a four-division of the<br>
transition piece symmetric to the centre line, so that either even smaller transportation<br>
dimcnsions can be achieved, or even larger transition pieces can rcmain transportable in a<br><br>
19<br>
smooth manner. In case of very large transition pieces. The invention provided for<br>
division of the transition pieces additionally in a horizontal plane.<br>
'Ihe shown design example of the transition piece as casting construction has the<br>
advantage, that thc wall (52) can be designed without any problem, with vaiying wall<br>
thickness, whereby one can obtain a very efficient material utilisation. The regions<br>
having high load. e.g. the convex bent transition to the ring flange (64) or the joining<br>
point (72) in the corner poles (43) of thc grid tower (42) designed as butt strap joim (71)<br>
can be designed with larger wall thickness than regions having lesser loads.  Similarly,<br>
the bordering of the arch-shaped recess (52) can be provided with bulge-type<br>
reinforcement  Furthermore, the casting construction allows a sliding transition<br>
optim sed for the force flow from the round cross-section in the upper region (60) of the<br>
transition piece (50) to the shown case of rectangular cross-section in the lower region<br>
(70) of the transition piece (50).<br>
Especially in the offshore application of the tower concept according to the invention, it<br>
is advantageous to utilise the space available in the transition region in a sensible manner,<br>
in that electrical operating agents (converters, switching devices, transformers), a spare<br>
parts storage (if required, with a small workshop) or an emergency accommodation for<br>
maintiance personnel or even a visitors room is accommodated there. For this, the<br>
available supporting structure can be supplemented with addition walls to form a closed<br>
space, which is obviously equipped with the required emergency entries and exits and<br>
eventually also with windows and air-conditioning systems. For the insulation of the<br>
electrical operating agents in the transition piece, an advantageous extension of the<br>
invention foresees that these operating agents are installed already in the factory and<br>
tested and the transition piece with the installation is transported and installed as a so-<br>
called power module.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the detailed depiction of another design variant of the transition piece<br>
according to the invention as welding construction. In the lower part of fig. 4, a top view<br><br>
20<br>
is slawn from the lop on to the transition piece (50). as well as in the upper part a vertical<br>
section through the transition piece along the section line A-B is shown.<br>
As the basic structure is very similar to the design explained in detail in fig. 3, one is<br>
referring only mainly to the differences.<br>
The wall (52) of the transition piece (50) is formed by 3 plate having constant thickness.<br>
which is rollcd-in in the upper region and founded in the lower region (70) for adapting to<br>
the geomeiry of the corner poles (43).  The average indination (x) of the transition piece<br>
(50) that is defined as the angle between the vertical and an imaginary line from the<br>
maximum horizontal extension in the upper region (60) to the maximum horizontal<br>
extension in the lower region (70). is significantly greater than the inclination of the<br>
corner polcs (43) of the grid tower (42), and obviously eiso greater than that, of the pipe<br>
tower, as this is designed in the shown example as cylindrical.<br>
Use 01 a cylindrical pipe tower allows a cost-favourable production and is only possible<br>
because the grid tower is designed very as very rigid/stiff and hence the total structure<br>
can also be designed in a sufficiently rigid/stiff manner, if a reinforcement- increasing<br>
expansion of the pipe tower is dispensed with.   Using a cylindrical shape for a pipe tower<br>
       is ideal if the azimuth bearing (rotate-able arrangement of the car on the lower) is<br>
selected sufficiently large. as in that, case a sufficiently rigid finish of the pipe tower is<br>
possible without expansion.<br>
In view of a simple design of the welding structure the joining point (72) has in the lower<br>
region n70) of the transition piece (50) an inclination that is different from the inclination<br>
of the cpmer poles (43). Therefore, the joining takes place through sufficiency thickly<br>
dimensioncd, bent butt straps (76) (hat have to take up the deflection of the force flow.<br>
The bent straps could be made of steel plate and weided if required, but an extension of<br>
the invention also provides for designing the straps as casting components.<br><br>
21<br>
As the forcc deflection deforns the butt strap joints inwards (towards the lower axis).<br>
thickly dimensioned hanizontal bearas (45) arc provided diagonally between two cormer<br>
poles (43) lying opposite to one another. (Due to reasons of simplicily, in the lower<br>
poles of fig. 4 only one such torn (45) has been shown as dashed line).  With ihe help<br>
of this type of coustunction the deflection of the force flow can be safely controlled and<br>
one also obtains a very economic, but however a so me what hcavier structure than in the<br>
ease of the cast structure.<br>
Just us in the cast structure, an advantageous extension of the invention provides<br>
reinfdrcemenl of the arch-shaped recesses (53), that are designed in the fonn of a welded<br>
plate strip (55) (as in a door frame). The advantages of desk; nine as wclded structure are<br>
the favourable manufacturing costs for lessor numbers, and the simpler testing procedures<br>
with the construction authorities.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the progression of the wail of ihe transition piece according to the invention<br>
shown in fig. 4. This structurally very favourable skapc can be produced in a very simple<br>
manner by plates out-out from a steel plate in a single piece or as in the depicted case of<br>
the grill tower, with four corner poles in 4 pieces (indicated by dashed line). The plate(s)<br>
is/arc additionally roiled in conically, in the transition region to the corner poles<br>
additional rounding off is of advantage, in order to ensure a belter transition to the comer<br>
polts. If sufficiently large rolling machines Eire not available, then the largely round<br>
shape at the transition to the upper flange can also be created by several smaller<br>
chamfers.<br>
