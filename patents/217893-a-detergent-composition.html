FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to particular types of alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures containing branching and adapted for laundry and cleaning product use by controlling compositional parameters, especially a 2/3-phenyl index and a 2-methyl-2-phenyl index, as well as to improved detergent and cleaning products containing these surfactant  mixtures, to alkylbenzene precursors  for the surfactant mixtures,  and  to methods of making the precursors as well as the surfactant mixtures. The present compositions are especially useful for fabric laundering.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Historically, highly branched alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants, such as those based on tetrapropylene, known as "ABS" or "TPBS", were used in detergents. However, these were found to be very poorly biodegradable.    A long period followed of improving manufacturing processes for alkylbenzene sulfonates, making them as linear as practically possible, hence the acronym "LAS".   The overwhelming part of a large art of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant manufacture is directed to this objective. All relevant large-scale commercial alkylbenzene sulfonate processes in use today are directed to linear alkylbenzene sulfonates.  However, linear alkylbenzene sulfonates are not without limitations; for example, they would be more desirable if improved for hard water cleaning and/or cold water cleaning properties.   They can often fail to produce good cleaning results, for example when formulated with nonphosphate builders and/or when used in hard water areas.<br>
As a result of the limitations of the alkylbenzene sulfonates, consumer cleaning formulations have often needed to include a higher level of cosurfactants, builders, and other additives than would have been needed given a superior alkylbenzene sulfonate.<br>
The art of alkylbenzene sulfonate detergents is replete with references which teach both for and against almost every aspect of these compositions.   Moreover, there are believed to be erroneous teachings and technical misconceptions about the mechanism of LAS operation under in-use conditions, particularly in the area of hardness tolerance. The volume of such references debases the art as a whole and makes it difficult to select the useful   teachings   from  the  useless  without  repeated  experimentation.      To   further understand the state of the art, it should be appreciated that there has been not only a lack of clarity on which way to go to fix the unresolved problems of linear LAS, but also a range of misconceptions, not only in the understanding of biodegradation but also in basic mechanisms of operation of LAS in presence of hardness.<br>
Also, while the currently commercial, essentially linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants are relatively simple compositions to define and analyze,  compositions containing both branched and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants are complex. In general such compositions can be highly varied, containing one or more different kinds of branching in any of a number of positions on the aliphatic chain. A very large number, e.g., hundreds, of distinct chemical species are possible in such mixtures. Accordingly there is  an  onerous  burden of experimentation  if it is  desired to improve  such compositions so that they can clean fabrics better in detergent compositions while at the same time remaining biodegradable. The formulator's knowledge is key to guiding this effort.<br>
Yet another currently unresolved problem in alkylbenzene sulfonate manufacture is to make more effective use of current LAB feedstocks. It would be highly desirable, both from a performance point of view and from an economic point of view, to better utilize certain desirable types of branched hydrocarbons.<br>
Accordingly there is a substantial unmet need for further improvements in alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures, especially with respect to those offering one or more of the advantages of superior cleaning, hardness tolerance, satisfactory biodegradability, and cost.<br>

In like manner, the  invention  encompasses  a  novel  alkylbenzene  sulfonate surfactant mixture comprising, preferably consisting essentially of: the product of-a process comprising the steps, in sequence, of: (I) alkylating benzene with an alkylating mixture; (II) sulfonating the product of (I); and (III) neutralizing the product of (n); wherein said alkylating mixture comprises: (a) from about 1% to about 99.9%, by weight of a branched alkylating agent selected  from:  (i)  C9-C20  (preferably C9-C15,  more preferably C10-C14) internal monoolefms R'LR2 wherein L is an acyclic olefinic moiety consisting of carbon and hydrogen and containing two terminal methyls; (ii)C9-C20 (preferably C9-C15, more preferablyC10-C14) alpha monoolefms R'AR2 wherein A is an acyclic alpha-olefinic moiety consisting of carbon and hydrogen and containing one terminal methyl and one terminal olefinic methylene; (iii) C9-C20 (preferably C9-C15, more preferably C10-C14) vinylidene monoolefms R*BR2 wherein B is an acyclic vinylidene olefm moiety consisting of carbon and hydrogen and containing two terminal methyls and one internal olefinic methylene; (iv) C9-C20 (preferably C9-C15, more preferably C10-C14 primary alcohols R'QR2 wherein Q is an acyclic aliphatic primary terminal alcohol moiety consisting of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen and containing one terminal methyl; (v) C9-C20 (preferably C9-C15, more preferablyC10-C14) primary alcohols R'ZR2 wherein Z is an<br>

In accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention, a variety of detergent compositions, especially laundry detergent compositions, comprising the modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture of the first embodiment are provided. Such detergent compositions generally contain an amount of the modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant useful to help clean fabrics, and amounts of laundry detergent-specific adjuncts which distinguish the preferred compositions herein from compositions used in non-laundry detergent fields. One such detergent composition in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention is<br>
a novel detergent composition comprising, preferably consisting essentially of: (a) from about 1% to about 50%, preferably from about 2% to about 30%, by weight of modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture of the first embodiment, wherein said modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture has a 2-methyl-2-phenyl index of less than about 0.3, preferably of from 0 to 0.2, more preferably no more than about 0.1, more<br><br>
preferably still, no more than about 0.05; (b) from about 0.000001% to about  10%, preferably from about 0.01% to  about 2%,  of a member selected from the group consisting of optical brighteners, dyes, photobleaches, hydrophobia bleach activators and transition metal bleach catalysts, preferably at least two of said member components, more preferably at least two of said member components including an optical brightener as one of the member components; (c) from 0.1% to about 40% by weight, preferably not more than about 30%, of surfactants selected from the group consisting of cationic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, anionic surfactants, and amine oxide surfactants (more preferably at least one cationic surfactant is present at a level of from about 0.2% to about 5% by weight, or at least one nonionic surfactant is present at a level of from about 0.5% to about 25% by weight, or at least one alkyl sulfate surfactant or alkyl(polyalkoxy)sulfate surfactant is present at a level of from about 0.5% to about 25% by weight); and (d) from about 10% to about 99% of conventional cleaning adjuncts (other than any of (a) - (c)); provided that when said detergent composition comprises any alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant  other  than  said modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture  (for example as a result of blending into the detergent composition one or more commercial, especially  linear,   typically  linear  C10-C14,  alkylbenzene  sulfonate  surfactants),  said detergent composition is further characterized by an overall 2/3-phenyl index of at least about 200, preferably at least about 250, more preferably at least about 350, more preferably still, at least about 500, wherein said overall 2/3-phenyl index is determined by measuring 2/3-phenyl index, as defined herein, on a blend of said modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture and said any other alkylbenzene sulfonate to be added to said detergent composition, said blend, for purposes of measurement, being prepared from aliquots of said modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture and said other alkylbenzene sulfonate not yet exposed to any other of said components of the detergent composition; and further provided that when said detergent composition comprises any alkylbenzene  sulfonate surfactant  other than  said modified  alkylbenzene  sulfonate surfactant mixture (for example as a result of blending into the detergent composition one or more commercial, especially linear, typically linear  C10-C14, alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants), said detergent composition is further characterized by an overall 2-methyI-2-phenyl index of less than about 0.3, preferably from 0 to 0.2, more preferably no more<br>
than about 0.1, more preferably still, no more than about 0.05, wherein said overall 2-methyl-2-phenyl index is to be determined by measuring 2-methyl-2-phenyl index, as defined herein, on a blend of said modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture and any other alkylbenzene sulfonate to be added to said detergent composition, said blend, for purposes of measurement, being prepared from aliquots of said modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture and said other alkylbenzene sulfonate not yet exposed to any other of said components of the detergent composition. These provisions may appear somewhat unusual, however they are consistent with the spirit and scope of the present invention, which encompasses a number of economical but less preferred approaches in terms of overall cleaning performance, such as blending of the modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants with conventional linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants either during synthesis or during formulation into the detergent composition. Moreover, as is well  known to practitioners of detergent analysis,  a number of detergent  adjuncts (paramagnetic materials such as certain transition metal bleach catalysts, for example, and sometimes even water) are capable of interfering with methods for determining the parameters of alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures as described hereinafter. Hence wherever possible, analysis should be conducted on dry materials before mixing them into the detergent compositions.<br>
The invention, on the other hand, is not intended to encompass any wholly conventional alkylbenzene sulfonate compositions or the derivative detergent compositions, such as those based exclusively on linear alkylbenzene sulfonates made by any process, or exclusively on known unacceptably branched alkylbenzene sulfonates such as ABS or TPBS.<br>
In accordance with a third embodiment of present invention, a novel modified alkylbenzene mixture is provided.

Other modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures herein are made by the above-outlined processes wherein in step (I), said alkylation is performed in the presence of an alkylation catalyst, said alkylation catalyst is an intermediate acidity solid porous alkylation catalyst, and step (II) comprises removal of components other than monoalkylbenzene prior to contacting the product of step (I) with sulfonating agent.<br>
Also encompassed is the modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture according to the above-defined processes wherein said alkylation catalyst is other than a member selected from the group consisting of HF, AlCl3, sulfuric acid and mixtures thereof. Such is the case when the alkylation catalyst is selected from the group consisting of non-fluoridated acidic mordenite-type catalyst, fluoridated acidic mordenite-type catalyst and mixtures thereof. Catalysts are described in more detail hereinafter.<br>
The processes are tolerant of variation, for example conventional steps can be added before, in parallel with, or after the outlined steps (I), (II) and (HI). This is especially the case for accomodating the use of hydrotropes or their precursors. Thus the invention encompasses a modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture according to the above-outlined processes wherein a hydrotrope, hydrotrope precursor, or mixtures thereof is added after step (I); or the hydrotrope, hydrotrope precursor or mixtures thereof is added during or after step (II) and prior to step (III); or a hydrotrope can be added during or after step (III). Sulfonation and Workup or Neutralization (Steps II / III)<br>
in general, sulfonation of the modified alkylbenzenes in the instant process can be accomplished using any of the well-known sulfonation systems, including those<br>
described   in   "Detergent  Manufacture  Including  Zeolite  Builders   and  other  New Materials", Ed. Sittig., Noyes Data Corp., 1979, as well as in Vol. 56 in "Surfactant Science" series, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1996, including in particular Chapter 2 entitled   "Alkylarylsulfonates:   History,   Manufacture,   Analysis   and   Environmental Properties", pages 39-108 which includes 297 literature references. This work provides access to a great deal of literature describing various processes and process steps, not only sulfonation but also dehydrogenation, alkylation, alkylbenzene distillation and the like. Common sulfonation systems useful herein include sulfuric acid, chlorosulfonic acid, oleum, sulfur trioxide and the like. Sulfur trioxide/air is especially preferred. Details of sulfonation using a suitable air/sulfur trioxide mixture are provided in US 3,427,342,  Chemithon.  Sulfonation processes  are further extensively described  in "Sulfonation Technology in the Detergent Industry", W.H. de Groot, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, 1991.<br>
Any convenient workup steps may be used in the present process. Common practice is to neutralize after sulfonation with any suitable alkali. Thus the neutralization step can  be conducted using alkali  selected  from  sodium,  potassium,  ammonium, magnesium and substituted ammonium alkalis and mixtures thereof. Potassium can assist solubility, magnesium can promote soft water performance and substituted ammonium can be helpful for formulating specialty variations of the instant surfactants. The invention encompasses  any of these  derivative  forms  of the  modified  alkylbenzenesulfonate surfactants as produced by the present process and their use in consumer product compositions.<br>
Alternately the acid form of the present surfactants can be added directly to acidic cleaning products, or can be mixed with cleaning ingredients and then neutralized.<br>
The hydrotropes or hydrotrope precursors useful herein can in general be selected from any suitable hydrotrope or hydrotrope precursor, including lower alkyl (CpCs) aromatics and their sulfonic acids and sulfonate salts, but are more typically based on a sulfonic acid or sodium sulfonate salt of toluene, cumene, xylene, napthalene or mixtures thereof. The hydrotrope precursors are selected from any suitable hydrotrope precursor, typically toluene, cumene, xylene, napthalene or mixtures thereof. A hydrotrope<br><br>
precursor is a compound that during step (HI), namely the sulfonation step, is converted into a hydrotrope.<br>
In terms of process conditions for alkylation, the invention encompasses a modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture wherein in step (I) said alkylation is performer! at a tempeT'aturs of from r.bout 125°C to about 230°C (preferably from about 175°C to about 215°C) and at a pressure of from about 50 psig to about 1000 psig (preferably from about 100 psig to about 250 psig). Preferably in step (I) said alkylation is<br>
performed at a temperature of from about 175°C to about 215°C, at a pressure of from<br>
       about lOOipsigio about 250psig.)and a time of from about 0.01 hour to about 18 hours<br>
   10     (preferably, as rapidly as possible, more typically from about 0.1 hour to about 5 hours). If<br><br>
           desired such alkylation may be conducted in one or more stages. Different stages of the<br>
          process can be conducted in different manufacturing facilities. Typically in practice, LAB<br>
manufacturers will conduct step (I), with detergent manufacturers conducting step (IE). Step (II) is typically conducted by either, or can even be conducted by third party manufacturers.<br>
In general it is found preferable in step (I) to couple together the use of relatively low temperatures (e.g., 175°C to about 215°C) with reaction times of medium duration (1 hour to about 8 hours) in the above-indicated ranges.<br>
It is possible even to "target" for desirably low 2-methyl-2-phenyl index in the present inventive compositions by selecting a relatively low reaction temperature, e.g., about 190°C, and to monitor the progress of the reaction by any convenient means (e.g., sampling and NMR analysis) to assure adequate completion while minimizing 2-methyl-2-phenyl index.<br>
Moreover, it is contemplated that the alkylation "step" (I) herein can be "staged" so that two or more reactors operating under different conditions in the defined ranges may be useful. By operating a plurality of such reactors, it is possible to allow for material with less preferred 2-methyl-2-phenyl index to be initially formed and, surprisingly, to convert such material into material with a more preferred 2-methyl-2-phenyl index.<br>
In terms of sulfonating agent selection, the invention encompasses a modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture wherein step (II) is performed using a sulfonating agent selected from the group consisting of sulfur dioxide, sulfur trioxide/air<br><br>
mixtures, and sulfuric acid (including oleum). Chlorosulfonic acid or other known sulfonating agents, while less commercially relevant, are also useful and are included for use in the invention.<br>
Although in general, neutralization step (IH) can be carried out with any suitable alkali, the invention  includes  a modified alkylbenzene sulfonate  surfactant mixture wherein said step (III) is performed using a basic salt, said basic salt having a cation selected from the group consisting of alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium, substituted ammonium, and mixtures thereof and an anion selected from hydroxide, oxide, carbonate, silicate, phosphate, and mixtures thereof. Preferred basic salt is selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, sodium silicate, potassium hydroxide, potassium silicate, magnesium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, and mixtures thereof. Alkvlation Catalyst<br>
To secure the modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures of the invention, the present invention uses a particularly defined alkylation catalyst. Said alkylation catalyst is an intermediate acidity solid porous alkylation catalyst defined in detail hereinafter. Particularly preferred alkylation catalysts comprise at least partially dealuminized acidic fluoridated mordenites, at least partially dealuminized acidic nonfluoridated mordenites, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Numerous alkylation catalysts are unsuitable for making the present modified alkylbenzene mixtures and modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures. Unsuitable alkylation catalysts include any of: sulfuric acid, aluminum chloride, and HF. Also unsuitable are non-acidic calcium mordenite, and many others. Other catalysts, such as the DETAL® process catalysts of UOP are also unsuitable, at least in their current commercial executions. Indeed no alkylation catalyst currently used for alkylation in the commercial production of detergent C10-C14 linear alkylbenzene sulfonates for use in laundry products are suitable.<br>
In contrast, suitable alkylation catalysts herein are selected from shape-selective moderately acidic alkylation catalysts, preferably zeolitic. The zeolite catalyst used for the alkylation step (I) is preferably selected from the group consisting of mordenite, HZSM-12, and offretite, any of these being in at least partially acidic form. Mixtures can be used and the catalysts can be combined with binders etc. as described hereinafter. More<br><br>
preferably, the zeolite is substantially in acid form and is contained in a catalyst pellet comprising a conventional binder and further wherein said catalyst pellet comprises at least about 1 %, more preferably at least 5%, more typically from 50% to about 90%, of said zeolite..<br>
More generally, a suitable alkylation  catalyst is typically at least partially crystalline, more preferably substantially crystalline not including binders or other materials used to forrrTcatalyst pellets, aggregates or composites. Moreover the catalyst is typically at least partially acidic. Fully exchanged Ca-form mordenite, for example, is unsuitable whereas H-form mordenite is suitable.<br>
The pores characterizing the zeolites useful in the present alkylation process may be substantially circular, uniform pores of about 6.2 Angstrom, or preferably may be somewhat elliptical, such as in mordenite. It should be understood that, in any case, the zeolites used as catalysts in the alkylation step of the present process have a major pore dimension intermediate between that of the large pore zeolites, such as the X and Y zeolites,  and the relatively small pore size zeolites ZSM-5 and ZSM-11, and preferably between about 6 Angstrom and about 7 Angstrom. Indeed ZSM-5 has been tried and found inoperable in the present invention.   The pore size dimensions and crystal   structures   of  certain   zeolites   are   specified   in   ATLAS   OF   ZEOLITE STRUCTURE TYPES by W. M. Meier and D. H. Olson, published by the Structure Commission of the International Zeolite Association (1978 and more recent editions) and distributed by Polycrystal Book Service, Pittsburgh, Pa.<br>
The zeolites useful in the alkylation step of the instant process generally have at least 10 percent of the cationic sites thereof occupied by ions other than alkali or alkaline-earth metals. Typical but non-limiting replacing ions include ammonium, hydrogen, rare earth, zinc, copper and aluminum. Of this group, particular preference is accorded ammonium, hydrogen, rare earth or combinations thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the zeolites are converted to the predominantly hydrogen form, generally by replacement of the alkali metal or other ion originally present with hydrogen ion precursors, e.g., ammonium ions, which upon calcination yield the hydrogen form. This exchange is conveniently carried out by contact of the zeolite with an ammonium salt solution, e.g., ammonium chloride, utilizing well known ion exchange techniques. In certain preferred<br><br>
embodiments, the extent of replacement is such as to produce a zeolite material in which at least 50 percent of the cationic sites are occupied by hydrogen ions.<br>
The zeolites may be subjected to various chemical treatments, including alumina extraction (dealumination) and combination with one or more metal components, particularly the metals of Groups HE, ffl, IV, VI, VTI and VHL It is also contemplated that the zeolites may, in some instances, desirably be subjected to thermal treatment, including steaming or calcination in air, hydrogen or an inert gas, e.g. nitrogen or helium.<br>
A suitable modifying treatment entails steaming of the zeolite by contact with an atmosphere containing from about 5 to about 100% steam at a temperature of from about 250°C to 1000°C. Steaming may last for a period of between about 0.25 and about 100 hours and may be conducted at pressures ranging from sub-atmospheric to several hundred atmospheres.<br>
hi practicing the desired alkylation step of the instant process, it may be useful to incorporate the above-described intermediate pore size crystalline zeolites in another material, e.g., a binder or matrix resistant to the temperature and other conditions employed in the process. Such matrix materials include synthetic or naturally occurring substances as well as inorganic materials such as clay, silica, and/or metal oxides. Matrix materials can be in the form of gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides. The latter may be either naturally occurring or in the form of gels or gelatinous precipitates. Naturally occurring clays which can be composited with the zeolite include those of the montmorillonite and kaolin families, which families include the sub-bentonites and the kaolins commonly known as Dixie, McNamee-Georgia and Florida clays or others in which the main mineral constituent is halloysite, kaolinite, dickite, nacrite or anauxite. Such clays can be used in the raw state as originally mined or initially subjected to calcination, acid treatment or chemical modification.<br>
In addition to the foregoing materials, the intermediate pore size zeolites employed herein may be compounded with a porous matrix material, such as alumina, silica-alumina, silica-magnesia, silica-zirconia, silica-thoria, silica-beryllia, and silica-titania, as well as ternary combinations, such as silica-alumina-thoria, silica-alumina-zirconia, silica-alumina-magnesia and silica-rnagnesia-zirconia. The matrix may be in the form of a cogel. The relative proportions of finely divided zeolite and Inorganic oxide gel matrix<br><br>
may vary widely, with the zeolite content ranging from between about 1 to about 99% by weight and more usually in the range of about 5 to about 80% by weight of the composite. A group of zeolites which includes some useful for the alkylation step herein have a silica:alumina ratio of at least 2:1, preferably at least 10:1 more preferably at least 20:1. The silica:alumina ratios referred to in this specification are the structural or framework ratios, that is, the ratio for the SiO4 to the AlO4 tetrahedra. In practice, silica:alumina ratios as determined by various physical and chemical methods are acceptable for use herein. It should be understood that such methods may acceptably give some variation. For example, a gross chemical analysis may include aluminum which is present in the form of cations associated with the acidic sites on the zeolite, thereby giving a somewhat low experimentally determined silica:alumina ratio. Similarly, if the ratio is determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of ammonia desorption, a somewhat low ammonia titration may be obtained if cationic aluminum prevents exchange of the ammonium ions onto the acidic sites. These disparities are well known in the art. They can be troublesome when certain treatments, such as the dealuminization methods described below which result in the presence of ionic aluminum free of the zeolite structure, are employed. Due care should therefore be taken to ensure that the framework silica:alumina ratio is correctly determined to the extent acceptable to a practitioner of the art.<br>
When the zeolites have been prepared in the presence of organic cations they are typically catalytically inactive, commonly because the  intracrystalline  free space is occupied by organic cations from the forming solution. They may be activated by heating in an inert atmosphere at 540°C for one hour, for example, followed by base exchange with ammonium salts followed by calcination at 540°C in air. The presence of organic cations in the forming solution may not be absolutely essential to the formation of the zeolite; but it does appear to favor the formation of this special type of zeolite. Some natural zeolites may sometimes be converted to zeolites of the.desired type by various activation procedures and other treatments such as base exchange, steaming, alumina extraction and calcination. The zeolites preferably have a crystal framework density, in the dry hydrogen form, not substantially below about 1.6 g/cm3. The dry density for known structures may be calculated from the number of silicon plus aluminum atoms per 1000 cubic Angstroms, as given, e.g., on page 19 of-the article on Zeolite Structure by W.<br><br><br>
M. Meier included in "Proceedings of the Conference on Molecular Sieves, London, April 1967", published by the Society of Chemical Industry, London, 1968. Reference is made to this paper for a discussion of the crystal framework density. A further discussion of crystal framework density, together with values for some typical zeolites, is given in U.S. Pat. No. 4,016,218, to which reference is made. When synthesized in the alkali metal form, the zeolite is conveniently converted to the hydrogen (acidic) form, generally via intermediate  formation of the  ammonium  form  by ammonium  ion  exchange  and calcination of the ammonium form to yield the hydrogen form. It has been found that although the hydrogen form of the zeolite catalyzes the reaction successfully, the zeolite may also be partly in the alkali metal form and/or the form of other metal salts.<br>
EP 466,558 describes an acidic mordenite type alkylation catalyst also of possible use herein having overall Si/Al atomic ratio of 15-85 (15-60), Na weight content is less than 1000 ppm (preferably less than 250 ppm), and there is a low or zero content of extra-network Al species; the elementary mesh volume as defined in EP 466,558 is below 2,760<br>
nm~US 5,057,472 is likewise useful for preparing alkylation catalysts herein and relates to concurrent dealumination and ion-exchange of an acid-stable Na ion-containing zeolite, preferably mordenite, effected by contact of the zeolite with a 0.5-3 (preferably 1-2.5) M HNO3 solution containing sufficient NH4NO3 to fully exchange the Na+ ions for NH/ and H* ions. The resulting zeolites can have a SiO2Al2O3 ratio of 15:1 to 26:1, preferably 17:1  to 23:1, and are preferably calcined to at least partially convert the NH.T/H+ form to the H form. Optionally, though not necessarily particularly desirable in the present invention, the catalyst can contain a Group VIII metal (and optionally also an inorganic oxide) together with the calcined zeolite of'472.<br>
Another acidic mordenite catalyst useful for the alkylation step herein is disclosed in US 4,861,935 which relates to a hydrogen form of mordenite incorporated with alumina, the composition having a surface area of at least 580 m2 /g. Other acidic mordenite catalysts useful for the alkylation step herein include those described in US 5,243,116 and US 5,198,595. Yet another alkylation catalyst useful herein is described in US 5,175,135 which is an acid mordenite zeolite having a silica/alumina molar ratio of at least 50:1, a Symmetry Index of at least 1.0 as determined by X-ray diffraction analysis,<br><br><br>
and a porosity such that the total pore volume is in the range from about 0.18 cc/g to about 0.45 cc/g and the ratio of the combined meso- and macropore- volume to the total pore volume is from about 0.25 to about 0.75.<br>
Particularly preferred alkylation catalysts herein include the acidic mordenite catalysts Zeocat™ FM-8/25H available from Zeochem; CBV 90 A available from Zeolyst International, and LZM-8 available from UOP Chemical Catalysts as well as fluoridated versions of the above commercial catalysts. Fluoridated mordenites can be prepared by a number of ways.   A method of providing a particularly useful fluoridated mordenite is described in US 5,777,187. The invention encompasses preferred embodiments in which the mordenites are fluoridated, but also has other preferred embodiments in which the mordenites are non-fluoridated.<br>
Most generally, any alkylation catalyst may be used herein provided that the alkylation catalyst can (a) accommodate branched olefins as described elsewhere herein into the smallest pore diameter of said catalyst and (b) selectively alkylate benzene with said branched olefins and optionally mixtures thereof with nonbranched olefins. Acceptable selectivity is in accordance with a 2/3-Phenyl index of about 275 to about 10,000 as defined herein.<br>
In other terms, the catalyst selections herein are made in part with the intention of minimizing   internal   alkylbenzene   formation   (e.g.,   4-phenyl,   5-phenyl   ...)      The formulators contributing to the present invention have unexpectedly discovered that control of internal alkylbenzene sulfonate isomers in the present inventive surfactant mixtures in conjunction with introduction of limited methyl branching is very helpful for improving their performance. The present invention connects this discovery to discoveries of the synthesis chemists in the present invention, who have determined how to control internal  isomer content while providing limited methyl  branching in the modified alkylbenzene   sulfonate   surfactant   mixtures   in   accordance   with   the   formulators' prescriptions.<br>
The extent to which internal isomer content needs to be controlled can vary depending on the consumer product application and on whether outright best performance or a balance of performance and cost is required. In absolute terms, the amount of internal isomer such as internal alkyibenzene isomer is preferably always kept below 25% by<br><br>
weight, but for best results, from 0 to 10%, preferably less than about 5% by weight. "Internal alkylbenzene" isomers as defined herein include alkylbenzenes having phenyl attachment to an aliphatic chain in the 4,5,6 or 7 position.<br>
Without intending to be limited by theory, there are two reasons for which it is believed that the prefered alkylation catalysts are the above-described shape selective zeolitic type catalysts, especially mordenites. The first reason is to provide the selectivity of formation of preferred compounds such as branched and nonbranched 2-phenyl and 3-phenylalkylbenzenes. This selectivity is measured by the 2/3-phenyl index. The second reason is to control the amount of quaternary alkylbenzenes and thus quaternary alkylbenzenesulfonates.<br>
Results with alkylation catalysts such as HF can give quite high levels of quaternary alkylbenzenes as shown in the literature (see J. Org. Chem. Vol 37, No. 25, 1972). This contrasts with the surprising discovery as part of the present invention that one can attain low levels of quaternary alkylbenzenes in catalyzed reactions of benzene with branched olefins, as characterized by 2-methyl-2-phenyl index.    Even when the olefins used are substantially dibranched, as illustrated herein, a low 2-methyl-2-phenyl index of less than 0.1 can surprisingly be obtained.

From outside the autoclave cell, 2000 g of benzene (contained in a isolated vessel and added by way of an isolated pumping system inside the isolated<br>
autoclave cell) is added to the autoclave. The autoclave is purged twice with 250' pisg N2,<br>
^and then charged to 60 psig N2-   The mixture is stirred and heated to about 200°C for about 4-5 hours. The autoclave is cooled to about 20°C overnight.   The valve is opened leading from the autoclave to the benzene condenser and collection tank. The autoclave is heated to about 120°C with continuous collection of benzene.    No more benzene is collected by the time the reactor reaches 120°C.   The reactor is then cooled to 40°C and 750 g of n-hexane is pumped into the autoclave with mixing.    The autoclave is then drained to remove the reaction mixture.    The reaction mixture is filtered to remove catalyst and the n-hexane is removed under vacuum.    The product is distilled under vacuum (1-5 mm of Hg).   A modified alkylbenzene mixture with a 2/3-Phenyl index of about 550 and a 2-methyl-2-phenyl index of about 0.02 is collected from 76°C - 130°C (167g).<br>

Methods for Determining Compositional Parameters (2/3-pbenvl index, 2-methvl-2-phenvl index) of Mixed Alkylbenzene/ Alkylbenzenesulfonate/ Alkvlbenzenesulfonic Acid Systems.<br>
It is well known in the art to determine compositional parameters of conventional linear alkylbenzenes and/or highly branched alkylbenzenesulfonates (TPBS, ABS). See, for example Surfactant Science Series, Volume 40, Chapter 7 and Surfactant Science Series, Volume 73, Chapter 7.    Typically this is done by GC and/or GC-mass spectroscopy for the alkylbenzenes and HPLC for the alkylbenzenesulfonates or sulfonic acids; 13C nmr is also commonly used. Another common practice is desulfonation. This permits GC and/or GC-mass spectroscopy to be used, since desulfonation converts the sulfonates or sulfonic acids to the alkylbenzenes which are tractable by such methods.<br>
In general, the present invention provides unique and relatively complex mixtures of alkylbenzenes, and similarly complex surfactant mixtures of alkylbenzenesulfonates and/or alkylbenzenesulfonic acids. Compositional parameters of such compositions can be determined using variations and combinations of the art-known methods.<br>
The sequence of methods to be used depends on the composition to be characterized as follows:<br><br>

Standards required for this method are 2-phenyloctane and 2-phenylpentadecane, each freshly distilled to a purity of greater than 98%. Run both standards using the conditions specified above to define the retention time for each standard. This defines a rentention time range which is the retention time range to be used for characterizing any alkylbenzenes or alkylbenzene mixtures in the context of this invention (e.g., test samples). Now run the test samples for which compositional parameters are to be determined. Test samples pass the GC test provided that greater than 90% of the total GC area percent is within the retention time range defined by the two standards. Test samples that pass the GC test can be used directly in the NMR1 and NMR2 test methods. Test samples that do not pass the GC test must be further purified by distillation until the test sample passes the GC test.<br>
DESULFONATION (DE)<br>
The desulfonation method is a standard method described in "The Analysis of Detergents and Detergent Products" by G. F. Longman on pages 197-199. Two other useful descriptions of this standard method are given on page 230-231 of volume 40 of the<br>
Surfactant Sience Series edited by T. M. Schmitt: "Analysis of Surfactants" and on page<br>
272 of volume 73 of the Surfactant Science Series: "Anionic Surfactants" edited by John<br><br>
Cross. This is an alternative method to the HPLC method, described herein, for evaluation of the branched and nonbranched alkylbenzenesulfonic acid and/or salt mixtures (Modified Alkylbenzensulfonic acid and or salt Mixtures). The method provides a means of converting the sulfonic acid and/or salt mixture into branched and nonbranched alkylbenzene mixtures which can then be analyzed by means of the 1C and NMR methods NMR1 and NMR2 described herein.<br>

The HPLC elution time of the 2-phenyloctylbenzenesulfonate defines the lower limit and the elution time of the 2-phenylpentadecanesuifonate standard defines the upper limit of the HPLC analysis relating to the alkyibeazeoesulfonic acid/salt mixture of the<br>
invention. If 90% of the alkylbenzenesulfonic acid/salt mixture components have retention times within the range of the above standards then the sample can be further defined by methods NMR 3 and NMR 4.<br>
If the alkylbenzenesulfonic acid/salt mixture contains 10% or more of components outside the retention limits defined by the standards then the mixture should b^ further purified by method HPLC-P or by DE, DIS methods.<br>
HPLC Preparative (HPLC-P)<br>
Alkylbenzenesulfonic acids and/or the salts which contain substantial impurities (10% or greater) are purified by preparative HPLC. See L.R. Snyder and J.J. Kirkland, "Introduction to Modem Liquid Chromatography", 2nd. Ed., Wiley, NY, 1979. This is routine to one skilled in the art. A sufficient quantity should be purified to meet the requirements of the NMR 3 and NMR 4.<br>
Preparative LC method using Mega Bond Elut Sep Pak® (HPLC-P)<br>
Alkylbenzenesulfonic acids and/or the salts which contain substantial impurities (10% or<br>
greater) can also be purified by an LC method (also defined herein as HPLC-P).<br>
This procedure is actually preferred over HPLC column prep purification.<br>
As much as 500 mg of unpurified MLAS salts can be loaded onto a 10g(60ml) Mega<br>
Bond Elut Sep Pak® and with optimized chromatography the purified MLAS salt can be<br>
isolated and ready for freeze drying within 2 hours. A 100 mg sample of Modified<br>
alkylbenzenesulfonate salt can be loaded onto a 5g(20ml) Bond Elut Sep Pak and ready<br>
within the same amount of time.<br>

DISTILLATION (PIS)<br>
A 5 liter, 3-necked round bottom flask with 24/40 joints is equipped with a magnetic stir<br>
bar.  A few boiling chips (Hengar Granules,  catalog #136-C) are added to the flask.  A<br>
91/2inch long vigreux condenser with a 24/40 joint is placed in the center neck of the<br>
^<br>
flask. A water cooled condenser is attached to the top of the vigreux condenser which is fitted with a calibrated thermometer. A vacuum receiving flask is attached to the end of the condenser. A glass stopper is placed in one side arm of the 5 liter flask and a calibrated thermometer in the other. The flask and the vigreux condenser are wrapped with aluminum foil. To the 5 liter flask, is added 2270 g of an alkylbenzene mixture which contains 10% or more impurities as defined by the GC method. A vacuum line leading from a vacuum pump is attached to the receiving flask. The alkylbenzene mixture<br>
in the 5 liter flask is stirred and vacuum is applied to the system.   Once the maximum vacuum is reached (at least 1 inch of Hg pressure by gauge or less), the alkylbenzene mixture is heated by means of an electric heating mantle. The distillate is collected in two fractions.   Fraction A is collected from about 25°C to about 90°C as measured by the calibrated thermometer at the top of the vigreux column.   Fraction B is collected from about 90°C to about 155°C as measured by the calibrated thermometer at the top of the vigreux column.   Fraction A and pot residues (high boiling) are discarded.   Fraction B (1881  g) contains the alkylbenzene mixture of interest. The method can be scaled according to the practitioner's needs provided that sufficient quantity of the alkylbenzene mixture remains after distillation for evaluation by NMR methods NMR1 and NMR2.<br>
ACIDIFICATION (AC)<br>
Salts of alkylbenzenesulfonic acids are acidified by common means such as reaction in a<br>
solvent with HC1 or sulfuric acid or by use of an acidic resin such as Amberlyst 15.<br>
Acificication is routine to one skilled in the art.   After acidifying remove all solvents,<br>
especially any moisture, so that the samples are anhydrous and solvent-free.<br>
Note: For all of the below NMR test methods, the chemical shifts of the NMR spectrum<br>
are either externally or internally referenced to TMS in CDCl3, i.e. chloroform.<br>

Detergent Compositions in Detail<br>
The novel modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures of the present invention can be incorporated into cleaning compositions, typically termed "detergent compositions" herein since the preferred of such compositions are for laundry cleaning, especially in domestic washing machines or for hand-washing use. These compositions can be in any conventional form, namely, in the form of a liquid, powder, agglomerate, paste, tablet, bar, gel, or granule.<br>
The detergent compositions of the present invention can more generally be used in a wide range of consumer cleaning product compositions including powders, liquids, granules,  gels,  pastes, tablets, pouches,  bars,  types  delivered  in  dual-compartment containers, spray or foam detergents and other homogeneous or multiphasic consumer cleaning product forms.  They can be used or applied by hand and/or can be applied in unitary or freely alterable dosage, or by automatic dispensing means, or are useful in appliances such as washing-machines or dishwashers or can be used in institutional cleaning contexts, including for example, for personal cleansing in public facilities, for bottle washing, for surgical instrument cleaning or for cleaning electronic components. They can be used in aqueous or non-aqueous cleaning systems. They can have a wide range of pH, for example from about 2 to about 12 or higher, though alkaline detergent compositions having a pH of from about 8  to about  11   are among the preferred embodiments, and they can have a wide range of alkalinity reserve which can include very high alkalinity reserves as in uses such as drain unblocking in which tens of grams of NaOH equivalent can be present per 100 grams of formulation, ranging through the 1-10<br><br>
grams of NaOH equivalent and the mild or low-alkalinity ranges of liquid hand cleaners, down to the acid side such as in acidic hard-surface cleaners. Both high-foaming and low-foaming detergent types are encompassed, as well as types for use in all known aqueous and non aqueous consumer product cleaning processes.<br>

Laundry or Cleaning Adjunct Materials and Methods:<br>
In general, a laundry or cleaning adjunct is any material required to transform a composition containing only the minimum essential ingredients (herein the essential modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture) into a composition useful for laundry or other consumer product cleaning purposes. In preferred embodiments, laundry or cleaning adjuncts are easily recognizable to those of skill in the art as being absolutely characteristic of laundry or cleaning products, especially of laundry or cleaning products intended for direct use by a consumer in a domestic environment.<br>
The precise nature of these additional components, and levels of incorporation thereof, will depend on the physical form of the composition and the nature of the cleaning operation for which it is to be used.<br>
Preferably, the adjunct ingredients if used with bleach should have good stability therewith. Certain preferred detergent compositions herein should be boron-free and/or phosphate-free as required by legislation. Levels of adjuncts are from about 0.00001% to about 99.9%, by weight of the compositions. Use levels of the overall compositions can vary widely depending on the intended application, ranging for example from a few ppm in solution to so-called "direct application" of the neat cleaning composition to the surface to be cleaned.<br>
Common adjuncts include builders, surfactants, enzymes, polymers, bleaches, bleach activators, catalytic materials and the like excluding any materials already defined hereinabove as part of the essential component of the inventive compositions. Other adjuncts herein can include suds boosters, suds suppressors (antifoams) and the like, diverse active ingredients or specialized materials such as dispersant polymers (e.g., from BASF Corp. or Rohm &amp; Haas), color speckles, silvercare, anti-tarnish and/or anti-<br><br>
corrosion agents, dyes, fillers, germicides, alkalinity sources, hydrotropes, anti-oxidants, enzyme stabilizing agents, pro-perfumes, perfumes, solubilizing agents, carriers, processing aids, pigments, and, for liquid formulations, solvents, as described in detail hereinafter.<br>
Quite  typically,   laundry   or   cleaning  compositions   herein   such  as   laundry detergents, laundry detergent additives, hard surface cleaners, synthetic and soap-based laundry bars, fabric softeners and fabric treatment liquids, solids and treatment articles of all kinds will require several adjuncts, though certain simply formulated products, such as bleach additives, may require only,  for example, an oxygen bleaching agent and a surfactant as described herein.    A comprehensive list of suitable laundry or cleaning adjunct materials and methods can be found in US Provisional Patent application No. 60/053,318 filed July 21, 1997 and assigned to Procter &amp; Gamble.<br>
Detersive surfactants - The instant compositions desirably include a detersive surfactant used as a co-surfactant with the essential surfactant mixtures.  Since the present invention is surfactant-related, in the descriptions of the preferred embodiments of the detergent compositions of the invention, surfactant materials are described and accounted for separately from nonsurfactant adjuncts. Detersive surfactants are extensively illustrated in U.S. 3,929,678, Dec. 30, 1975 Laughlin, et al, and U.S. 4,259,217, March 31, 1981, Murphy; in the series "Surfactant Science", Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York and Basel; in "Handbook  of Surfactants",   M.R.   Porter,  Chapman  and   Hall,  2nd  Ed.,   1994;  in "Surfactants  in  Consumer  Products",   Ed.  J.  Falbe,  Springer-Verlag,   1987;  and in numerous detergent-related patents assigned to Procter &amp; Gamble and other detergent and consumer product manufacturers.<br>
The detersive surfactant herein includes anionic, nonionic, zwitterionic or amphoteric types of surfactant known for use as cleaning agents in textile laundering, but does not include completely foam-free or completely insoluble surfactants (though these may be used as optional adjuncts). Examples of the type of surfactant considered optional for the present purposes are relatively uncommon as compared with cleaning surfactants but include, for example, the common fabric softener materials such as dioctadecyldimethylarnmonium chloride.<br><br>
In more detail, detersive surfactants useful herein, typically at levels from about 1% to about 55%, by weight, suitably include:    (1) conventional alkylbenzene sulfonates, including the hard (ABS, TPBS) or linear types and made by known processe such as various HF or solid HF e.g., DETAL® (UOP) process, or made by using other Lewis Acid catalysts e.g., A1C13, or made using acidic silica/alumina or made from chlorinated hydrocarbons; (2) olefin sulfonates, including α-olefin sulfonates and sulfonates derived from fatty acids and fatty esters; (3) alkyl or alkenyl sulfosuccinates, including the diester and  half-ester types  as well  as  sulfosuccinamates and other sulfonate/ carboxylate surfactant types  such  as the sulfosuccinates derived  from ethoxylated alcohols and alkanolamides; (4) paraffin or alkane sulfonate- and alkyl or alkenyl carboxysulfonate-types     including     the     product     of    adding    bisulfite     to    alpha    olefins;     (5) alkylnaphthalenesulfonates; (6) alkyl isethionates and alkoxypropanesulfonates, as well as fatty isethionate esters, fatty esters of ethoxylated isethionate and other ester sulfonates such as the ester of 3-hydroxypropanesulfonate or AVANEL S types; (7) benzene, cumene,   toluene,   xylene,   and   naphthalene   sulfonates,   useful   especially  for   their hydrotroping properties; (8) alkyl ether sulfonates; (9) alkyl amide sulfonates; (10) α sulfo    fatty   acid    salts   or   esters   and    internal   sulfo    fatty   acid   esters;    (11) alkylglycerylsulfonates;   (12)  ligninsulfonates;   (13)  petroleum  sulfonates,  sometimes known as heavy alkylate sulfonates; (14) diphenyl oxide disulfonates; (15) linear or branched alkylsulfates or alkenyl sulfates; (16) alkyl or alkylphenol alkoxylate sulfates and the corresponding polyalkoxylates, sometimes known as alkyl ether sulfates, as well as the alkenylalkoxysulfates or alkenylpolyalkoxy sulfates; (17) alkyl amide sulfates or alkenyl amide sulfates, including sulfated alkanolamides and their alkoxylates and polyalkoxylates; (18) sulfated oils, sulfated alkylglycerides, sulfated alkylpolyglycosides or     sulfated     sugar-derived     surfactants;     (19)     alkyl     alkoxycarboxylates     and alkylpolyalkoxycarboxylates,    including   galacturonic   acid   salts;   (20)   alkyl   ester carboxylates and alkenyl ester carboxylates; (21) alkyl or alkenyl carboxylates, especially conventional    soaps    and    α,-    dicarboxylates,    including   also   the   alkyl-    and alkenylsuccinates; (22) alkyl or alkenyl amide alkoxy- and polyalkoxy-carboxylates; (23) alkyl and alkenyl amidocarboxylate surfactant types, including the sarcosinates, taurides, giycinates,   aminopropionates  and  iminopropionates;   (24)  amide  soaps,   sometimes<br><br>

In any of the above detersive surfactants, hydrophobe chain length is typically in the general range C8-C20, with chain lengths in the range C8-C18 often being preferred, especially when laundering is to be conducted in cool water.   Selection of chainlengths and degree of alkoxylation for conventional purposes are taught in the standard texts. When the detersive surfactant is a salt, any compatible cation may be present, including H (that is, the acid or partly acid form of a potentially acidic surfactant may be used), Na, K, Mg, ammonium or alkanolammonium, or combinations of cations.  Mixtures of detersive surfactants having different charges are commonly preferred, especially anionic/cationic, anionic / nonionic, anionic / nonionic / cationic, anionic / nonionic / amphoteric, nonionic / cationic and nonionic / amphoteric mixtures.  Moreover, any single detersive surfactant may be substituted, often with desirable results for cool water washing, by mixtures of otherwise   similar   detersive   surfactants   having   differing   chainlengths,   degree   of unsaturation or branching, degree of alkoxylation (especially ethoxylation), insertion of substituents such as ether oxygen atoms in the hydrophobes, or any combinations thereof. Preferred among the above-identified detersive surfactants are: acid, sodium and ammonium C9-C20 linear alkylbenzene sulfonates, particularly sodium linear secondary alkyl  C10-C15 benzenesulfonates though  in  some regions ABS may be used (1); olefinsulfonate salts, (2), that is, material made by reacting olefms, particularly C10-C20 a-olefins, with sulfur trioxide and then neutralizing and hydrolyzing the reaction product; sodium and ammonium C7-C12 dialkyl sulfosuccinates, (3); alkane monosulfonates, (4), such as those derived by reacting C8-C20 a-olefins with sodium bisulfite and those derived by reacting paraffins with SO2 and Cl2 and then hydrolyzing with a base to form a     random     sulfonate;    a-Sulfo    fatty    acid    salts    or    esters,    (10);    sodium alkylglycerylsulfonates, (11), especially those ethers of the higher alcohols derived from tallow or coconut oil and synthetic alcohols derived from petroleum; alkyl or alkenyl sulfates, (15)a which may be primary or secondary, saturated or unsaturated, branched or unbranched.

Amphoteric or zwitterionic detersive surfactants when present are usually useful at levels in the range from about 0.1% to about 20% by weight of the detergent composition. Often levels will be limited to about 5% or less, especially when the amphoteric is costly. Detersive   Enzymes   -   Enzymes   are   preferably   included   in  the  present   detergent compositions for a variety of purposes, including removal of protein-based, carbohydrate-based, or triglyceride-based stains from substrates, for the prevention of refugee dye transfer in fabric laundering, and for fabric restoration.   Recent enzyme disclosures in detergents useful herein include bleach/amylase/protease combinations (EP 755,999 A; EP 756,001 A; EP 756,000 A); chondriotinase ( EP 747,469 A); protease variants ( WO 96/28566 A; WO 96/28557 A; WO 96/28556 A; WO 96/25489 A); xylanase ( EP 709,452 A); keratinase (EP 747,470 A); lipase ( GB 2,297,979 A; WO 96/16153 A; WO 96/12004 A; EP 698,659 A; WO 96/16154 A);    cellulase (GB 2,294,269 A; WO 96/27649 A; GB 2,303,147 A); thermitase (WO 96/28558 A).

Preferred selections are influenced by factors such as pH-activity and/or stability optima, thermostability, and stability to active detergents, builders and the like.   In this respect bacterial or fungal enzymes are preferred, such as bacterial amylases and proteases, and fungal cellulases. Suitable enzymes are also described in US Patent Nos. 5,677,272, 5,679,630, 5,703,027,<br><br>
5,703,034, 5,705,464, 5,707,950, 5,707,951, 5,710,115, 5,710,116, 5,710.118, 5,710,119 and 5,721,202.<br>
"Detersive enzyme", as used herein, means any enzyme having a cleaning, stain removing or otherwise beneficial effect in a laundry, hard surface cleaning or personal eaie detergent  composition.     Preferred  detersive  enzymes  are  hydrolases   such   as proteases, amylases and lipases. Preferred enzymes for laundry purposes include, but are not limited  to,  proteases, cellulases,  lipases and peroxidases.  Highly preferred  are amylases and/or proteases, including both current commercially available types and improved types which, though more and more bleach compatible though successive improvements, have a remaining degree of bleach deactivation susceptibility.<br>
Enzymes   are   normally   incorporated   into   detergent   or   detergent   additive compositions at levels sufficient to provide a "cleaning-effective amount".    The term "cleaning effective amount" refers to any amount capable of producing a cleaning, stain removal,   soil   removal,   whitening,  deodorizing,   or   freshness   improving   effect   on substrates such as  fabrics, dishware and the like.     In practical  terms  for current commercial preparations, typical amounts are up to about 5 mg by weight, more typically 0.01 mg to 3 mg, of active enzyme per gram of the detergent composition.    Stated otherwise, the compositions herein will typically comprise from 0.001% to 5%, preferably 0.01%-1% by weight of a commercial enzyme preparation. Protease enzymes are usually present in such commercial preparations at levels sufficient to provide from 0.005 to 0.1 Anson units (AU) of activity per gram of composition.   For certain detergents it may be desirable to increase the active enzyme content of the commercial preparation in order to minimize the total amount of non-catalytically active materials and thereby improve sporting/filming or other end-results. Higher active levels may also be desirable in highly concentrated detergent formulations.<br>
Suitable examples of proteases are the subtilisins which are obtained from particular strains of B. subtilis and B. licheniformis. One suitable protease is obtained from a strain of Bacillus, having maximum activity throughout the pH range of 8-12, developed and sold as ESPERASE® by Novo Industries A/S of Denmark, hereinafter "Novo". The preparation of this enzyme and analogous enzymes is described in GB 1,243,784 to Novo. Other suitable proteases include ALCALASE® and SAVINASE®<br><br>
from Novo and MAXATASE® from International Bio-Synthetics, Inc., The Netherlands; as well as Protease A as disclosed in EP 130,756 A, January 9, 1985 and Protease B as disclosed in EP 303,761 A, April 28, 1987 and EP 130,756 A, January 9, 1985.  See also a high pH protease from Bacillus sp. NCMB 40338 described in WO 9318140 A to Novo.   Enzymatic detergents comprising protease, one or more other enzymes, and a reversible protease inhibitor are described in WO 9203529 A to Novo.   Other preferred proteases include those of WO 9510591 A to Procter &amp; Gamble . When desired, a protease having decreased adsorption and increased hydrolysis is available as described in WO 9507791 to Procter &amp; Gamble.

Useful proteases are also described in PCT publications: WO 95/30010 published November 9, 1995 by The Procter &amp; Gamble Company; WO 95/30011 published November 9, 1995 by The Procter &amp; Gamble Company; WO 95/29979 published November 9, 1995 by The Procter &amp; Gamble Company.<br>
Amylases suitable herein include, for example, a-amylases described in GB 1,296,839 to Novo; RAPIDASE®, International Bio-Synthetics, Inc. and TERMAMYL®, Novo. FUNGAMYL® from Novo is especially useful. Engineering of enzymes for improved stability, e.g., oxidative stability, is known. See, for example J. Biological Chem., Vol. 260, No. 11, June 1985, pp. 6518-6521. Certain preferred embodiments of the present compositions can make use of arnylases having improved stability in detergents, especially improved oxidative stability as measured against a reference-point<br>
of TERMAMYL® in commercial use in 1993.  These preferred amylases herein share the characteristic of being "stability-enhanced" amylases, characterized, at a minimum, by a measurable improvement  in  one or more  of:  oxidative stability,  e.g.,  to  hydrogen peroxide/tetraacetylethylenediamine in buffered solution at pH 9-10; thermal stability, e.g., at common wash temperatures such as about 60°C; or alkaline stability, e.g., at a pH from about 8 to about 11, measured versus the above-identified reference-point amylase. Stability can be measured using any of the art-disclosed technical tests. See, for example, references disclosed in WO 9402597. Stability-enhanced amylases can be obtained from Novo or from Genencor International. One class of highly preferred amylases herein have the commonality of being derived using site-directed mutagenesis from one or more of the Bacillus amylases, especially the Bacillus a-amylases, regardless of whether one, two or multiple amylase strains are the immediate precursors. Oxidative stability-enhanced amylases vs. the above-identified reference amylase are preferred for use, especially in bleaching,  more preferably  oxygen bleaching,  as  distinct  from chlorine bleaching, detergent compositions herein. Such preferred amylases include (a) an amylase according to the hereinbefore incorporated WO 9402597, Novo, Feb. 3, 1994, as further illustrated by a mutant in which  substitution is made, using alanine or threonine, preferably threonine, of the methionine residue located in position 197 of the B. licheniformis alpha-<br>
amylase, known as TERMAMYL®, or the homologous position variation of a similar parent amylase, such as B. amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, or B. stearothermophilus; (b) stability-enhanced amylases as described by Genencor International in a paper entitled "Oxidatively Resistant  alpha-Amylases" presented at the 207th American Chemical Society National Meeting, March 13-17 1994, by C. Mitchinson.   Therein it was noted that bleaches in automatic dishwashing detergents inactivate alpha-amylases but that improved oxidative stability amylases have been made by Genencor from B. licheniformis NCIB8061.   Methionine (Met) was identified as the most likely residue to be modified. Met was substituted, one at a time, in positions 8, 15, 197, 256, 304, 366 and 438 leading to specific mutants, particularly important being M197L and M197T with the M197T<br>
variant being the most stable expressed variant.  Stability was measured in CASCADE®<br>
and SUNLIGHT®; (c) particularly preferred amylases herein include arnyiase variants<br><br>
having additional modification in the immediate parent as described in WO 9510603 A and are available from the assignee, Novo, as DURAMYL®.  Other particularly preferred oxidative  stability enhanced  amylase  include those described   in  WO  9418314  to Genencor International and  WO  9402597 to Novo.    Any other oxidative stability-snhanced amylase can be used, for example as derived by site-directed niuiagenesis from known chimeric, hybrid or simple mutant parent forms of available amylases.   Other preferred enzyme modifications are accessible. See WO 9509909 A to Novo.<br>
Other amylase enzymes include those described in WO 95/26397 and in co-pending application by Novo Nordisk(PCT/DK96/00056.) Specific amylase enzymes for use   in   the   detergent   compositions   of the   present   invention   include   a-amylases characterized by having a specific activity at least 25% higher than the specific activity of Termamyl® at a temperature range of 25°C to 55°C and at a pH value in the range of 8 to 10, measured by the Phadebas® α-amylase activity assay.  (Such  Phadebas® a-amylase activity assay is described at pages 9-10, WO 95/26397.)   Also included herein are o&gt; amylases which are at least 80% homologous with the amino acid sequences shown in the SEQ ID listings in the references.    These enzymes are preferably incorporated into laundry detergent compositions at a level from 0.00018% to 0.060% pure enzyme by weight of the total composition, more preferably from 0.00024% to 0.048% pure enzyme by weight of the total composition.<br>

Lipase and amylase variants stabilized against peroxidase enzymes are described in WO 9414951 A to Novo. See also WO 9205249 and RD 94359044.<br>
Cutinase enzymes suitable for use herein are described in WO 8809367 A to Genencor.<br>
Peroxidase enzymes may be used in combination with oxygen sources, e.g., percarbonate, perborate, hydrogen peroxide, etc., for "solution bleaching" or prevention of transfer of dyes or pigments removed from substrates during the wash to other substrates present in the wash solution. Known peroxidases include horseradish peroxidase, ligninase, and haloperoxidases such as chloro- or bromo-peroxidase. Peroxidase-containing detergent compositions are disclosed in WO 89099813 A, October 19, 1989 to Novo and WO 8909813 A to Novo.<br>
A range of enzyme materials and means for their incorporation into synthetic detergent compositions is also disclosed in WO 9307263 A and WO 9307260 A to Genencor International, WO 8908694 A to Novo, and U.S. 3,553,139, January 5, 1971 to McCarty et al.   Enzymes are further disclosed in U.S. 4,101,457, Place et al, July 18, 1978, and in U.S. 4,507,219, Hughes, March 26, 1985.

AC13 giving proteases, xylanases and celiulases, is described in WO 9401532 A to Novo.<br><br><br>
Builders - Detergent builders are preferably included in the compositions herein, for example to assist in controlling mineral, especially Ca and/or Mg, hardness in wash water or to assist in the removal and/or suspension of particulate soils from surfaces and sometimes to provide alkalinity and/or buffering action.   In solid formulations, builders sometimes serve as absorbents for surfactants. Alternately, certain compositions can be formulated  with  completely water-soluble  builders,  whether  organic   or   inorganic, depending on the intended use.<br>
Suitable silicate builders include water-soluble and  hydrous  solid  types  and including  those  having  chain-,   layer-,   or  three-dimensional-   structure   as   well   as amorphous-solid silicates or other types, for example especially adapted for use in non-structured-liquid detergents.  Preferred are alkali metal silicates, particularly those liquids and solids having a SiO2:Na20 ratio in the range 1.6:1 to 3.2:1, including solid hydrous 2-ratio silicates marketed by PQ Corp. under the tradename BRITESIL®, e.g., BRITESIL H2O; and layered silicates, e.g., those described in U.S. 4,664,839, May 12, 1987, H. P. Rieck. NaSKS-6, sometimes abbreviated "SKS-6", is a crystalline layered aluminum-free 6-Na2SiO5 morphology silicate marketed by Hoechst and is preferred especially in granular laundry compositions. See preparative methods in German DE-A-3,417,649 and DE-A-3,742,043.    Other layered silicates, such as those having the general formula NaMSixO2x+ 1-yH2O wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, x is a number from 1.9 to 4, preferably 2, and y is a number from 0 to 20, preferably 0, can also or alternately be used herein. Layered silicates from Hoechst also include NaSKS-5, NaSKS-7 and NaSKS-11, as the a, p and y layer-silicate forms.    Other silicates may also be useful, such as magnesium silicate, which can serve as a crispening agent in granules, as a stabilizing agent for bleaches, and as a component of suds control systems.<br>
Also suitable for use herein are synthesized crystalline ion exchange materials or hydrates thereof having chain structure and a composition represented by the following general formula in an anhydride form: xM2O-ySiO2.zM'O wherein M is Na and/or K, M1 is Ca and/or Mg; y/x is 0.5 to 2.0 and z/x is 0.005 to 1.0 as taught in U.S. 5,427,711, Sakaguchi et al, June 27, 1995.<br>
Aluminosilicate builders, such as zeolites, are especially useful in granular detergents, but can also be incorporated in liquids, pastes or gels. Suitable for the present<br><br>
purposes are those having empirical formula: [Mz(AlO2)z(SiO2)v]-xH2O wherein z and v are integers of at least 6, M is an alkali metal, preferably Na and/or K, the molar ratio of z to v is in the range from 1.0 to 0.5, and x is an integer from 15 to 264. Aluminosilicates can be crystalline or  amorphous,  naturally-occurring or  synthetically  derived.   An alurninos-ilicate production method is in U.S.   3,985,669, Krummel, et al, October 12, 1976. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are available as Zeolite A, Zeolite P~(B), Zeolite X and, to whatever extent this differs from Zeolite P, the so-called Zeolite MAP.  Natural types, including clinoptilolite, may be used.   Zeolite A has the  formula: Na12[(AlO2)12(SiO2)i2]'xH2O wherein x  is  from  20  to  30, especially 27. Dehydrated zeolites (x = 0 -  10) may also be used.    Preferably, the aluminosilicate has a particle size of 0.1-10 microns in diameter.<br>
Detergent builders in place of or in addition to the silicates and aluminosilicates described hereinbefore can optionally be included in the compositions herein, for example to assist in controlling mineral, especially Ca and/or Mg, hardness in wash water or to assist in the removal of particulate soils from surfaces.  Builders can operate via a variety of mechanisms including forming soluble or insoluble complexes with hardness ions, by ion exchange, and by offering a surface more favorable to the precipitation of hardness ions than are the surfaces of articles to be cleaned.    Builder level can vary widely depending upon end use and physical form of the composition. Built detergents typically comprise at least about 1 % builder.  Liquid formulations typically comprise about 5% to about 50%, more typically 5% to 35% of builder.    Granular formulations typically comprise from about 10% to about 80%, more typically 15% to 50% builder by weight of the detergent composition.   Lower or higher levels of builders are not excluded.   For example, certain detergent additive or high-surfactant formulations can be unbuilt.<br>
Suitable builders herein can be selected from the group consisting of phosphates and polyphosphates, especially the sodium salts; carbonates, bicarbonates, sesquicarbonates and carbonate minerals other than sodium carbonate or sesquicarbonate; organic mono-, di-, tri-, and tetracarboxylates especially water-soluble nonsurfactant carboxylates in acid, sodium, potassium or alkanolammonium salt form, as well as oligomeric or water-soluble low molecular weight polymer carboxylates including aliphatic and aromatic types; and phytic acid. These may be complemented by borates,<br><br>
e.g., for pH-buffering purposes, or by sulfates, especially sodium sulfate and any other fillers or carriers which may be important to the engineering of stable surfactant and/or builder-containing detergent compositions.<br>
Builder mixtures, sometimes termed "builder systems" can be used and typically comprise two or more conventional builders, optionally complemented by cbelants, pH-buffers or fillers, though these latter materials are generally accounted for separately when describing quantities of materials herein.   In terms of relative quantities of surfactant and builder in the present detergents, preferred builder systems are typically formulated at a weight ratio of surfactant to builder of from about 60:1 to about 1:80.   Certain preferred laundry detergents have said ratio in the range 0.90:1.0 to 4.0:1.0, more preferably from 0.95:1.0 to 3.0:1.0.<br>
P-containing detergent builders often preferred where permitted by legislation include, but are not limited to, the alkali metal, ammonium and alkanolammonium salts of polyphosphates exemplified by the tripolyphosphates, pyrophosphates, glassy polymeric meta-phosphates; and phosphonates.<br>
Suitable carbonate builders include alkaline earth and alkali metal carbonates as disclosed in German Patent Application No. 2,321,001 published on November 15, 1973, although sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium sesquicarbonate, and other carbonate minerals such as trona or any convenient multiple salts of sodium carbonate and calcium carbonate such as those having the composition 2Na2CO3.CaCo3 when anhydrous, and even calcium carbonates including calcite, aragonite and vaterite, especially forms having high surface areas relative to compact calcite may be useful, for example as seeds or for use in synthetic detergent bars.<br>
Suitable "organic detergent builders", as described herein for use in the cleaning compositions include polycarboxylate compounds, including water-soluble nonsurfactant dicarboxylates and  tricarboxylates.   More typically builder polycarboxylates have a plurality of carboxylate groups, preferably at least 3 carboxylates. Carboxylate builders can be formulated in acid, partially neutral, neutral or overbased form. When in salt form, alkali metals, such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, or alkanolammonium salts are preferred.      Polycarboxylate  builders   include   the  ether  polycarboxylates,   such   as oxydisuccinate, see Berg, U.S.  3,128,287, April 7, 1964, and Lamberti et al, U.S.<br><br><br>
3,635,830, January 18, 1972; "TMS/TDS" builders of U.S. 4,663,071, Bush el al, May 5, 1987; and other ether carboxylates including cyclic and alicyclic compounds, such as those described in U.S. Patents 3,923,679; 3,835,163; 4,158,635; 4,120,874 and 4,102,903.<br>
Other suitable organic detergent builders are the ether hydroxypolycarboxylates, copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethylene or vinyl methyl ether; 1, 3, 5-trihydroxy benzene-2, 4,  6-trisulphonic acid; carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid; the various alkali metal,   ammonium   and   substituted   ammonium   salts  of polyacetic   acids   such   as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid; as well as mellitic acid, succinic acid, polymaleic acid, benzene 1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, and soluble salts thereof,<br>
Citrates, e.g., citric acid and soluble salts thereof are important carboxylate builders e.g., for heavy duty liquid detergents, due to availability from renewable resources and biodegradability. Citrates can also be used in granular compositions, especially in combination with zeolite and/or layered silicates. Oxydisuccinates are also especially useful in such compositions and combinations.<br>
Where permitted, and especially in the formulation of bars used for hand-laundering operations, alkali metal phosphates such as sodium tripolyphosphates, sodium pyrophosphate and sodium orthophosphate can be used. Phosphonate builders such as ethane-l-hydroxy-l,l-diphosphonate and other known phosphonates, e.g., those of U.S. 3,159,581; 3,213,030; 3,422,021; 3,400,148 and 3,422,137 can also be used and may have desirable antiscaling properties.<br>
Certain detersive surfactants or their short-chain homologues also have a builder action.    For unambiguous formula accounting purposes, when they have surfactant capability, these materials are summed up as detersive surfactants.   Preferred types for builder functionality are illustrated by: 3,3-dicarboxy-4-oxa-l,6-hexanedioates and the related compounds disclosed in U.S. 4,566,984, Bush, January 28, 1986. Succinic acid builders include the C5-C20 alkyl and alkenyl succinic acids and salts thereof.  Succinate builders    also    include:    laurylsuccinate,    myristylsuccinate,    palmitylsuccinate,    2-dodecenylsuccinate (preferred), 2-pentadecenylsuccinate, and the like.   Lauryl-succinates are   described   in   European   Patent   Application   86200690.5/0,200,263,   published<br><br><br>
November 5, 1986. Fatty acids, e.g., C12-C18 monocarboxylic acids, can also be incorporated into the compositions as surfactant/builder materials alone or in combination with the aforementioned builders, especially citrate and/or the succinate builders, to provide additional builder activity. Other suitable polycarboxylates are disclosed in U.S. 4,144,226, Cnitchfield et al, March 1.3, 1979 and in U.S. 3,308,067, Diehl, March 7, 1967. See also Diehl, U.S. 3,723,322.<br>
Other types of inorganic builder materials which can be used have the formula (Mx)i Cay (CO3)2 wherein x and i are integers from 1 to 15, y is an integer from 1 to 10, z is an integer from 2 to 25, Mj are cations, at least one of which is a water-soluble, and the equation - 1-15(xi multiplied by the valence of Mj) + 2y = 2z is satisfied such that the formula has a neutral or "balanced" charge.   These builders are referred to herein as "Mineral Builders", examples of these builders, their use and preparation can be found in US   Patent   5,707,959.      Another   suitable   class   of   inorganic   builders   are   the Magnesiosilicates, see W097/0179. Oxygen Bleaching Agents:<br>
Cleaning compositions of the present invention preferably may comprise, as part or all of the conventional adjunct materials, an "oxygen bleaching agent".    Oxygen bleaching agents useful in the present invention can be any of the oxidizing agents known for laundry, hard surface cleaning, automatic dishwashing or denture cleaning purposes. Oxygen bleaches or mixtures thereof are preferred, though other oxidant bleaches, such as an enzymatic hydrogen peroxide producing system, or hypohalites such as chlorine bleaches like hypochlorite, may also be used.   Oxygen bleaching "systems" in general contain two or more materials contributing to oxygen bleaching, commonly a source of oxygen bleach, such as perborate or even oxygen from the air, and a catalyst and/or a bleach activator<br>
Common oxygen bleaches of the peroxygen type include hydrogen peroxide, inorganic peroxohydrates, organic peroxohydrates and the organic peroxyacids, including hydrophilic and hydrophobic mono- or di- peroxyacids. These can be peroxycarboxylic acids, peroxyimidic acids, amidoperoxycarboxylic acids, or their salts including the calcium, magnesium, or mixed-cation salts. Peracids of various kinds can be used both in free form and as precursors known as "bleach activators" or "bleach promoters" which,<br><br><br>
when combined with  a source of hydrogen peroxide,  perhydrolyze  to  release  the corresponding peracid.<br>
Also useful herein as oxygen bleaches are the inorganic peroxides such as Na2O2, superoxides such as KO2, organic hydroperoxides such as cumene hydroperoxide and t-butyl   hydroperoxide,   and   the   inorganic   pcroxoacids   and   their  sail;;   such   as   the peroxosulfuric acid salts, especially the potassium salts of peroxodisulfuric acid and, more preferably, of peroxomonosulfuric acid including the commercial triple-salt form sold as OXONE by DuPont and also any equivalent commercially available forms such as CUROX from Akzo or CAROAT from Degussa.    Certain organic peroxides, such as dibenzoyl peroxide, may be useful, especially as additives rather than as primary oxygen bleach.<br>
Mixed oxygen bleach systems are generally useful, as are mixtures of any oxygen bleaches with the known bleach activators, organic catalysts, enzymatic catalysts and mixtures thereof; moreover such mixtures may further include brighteners, photobleaches and dye transfer inhibitors of types well-known in the art.<br>
Preferred oxygen bleaches,  as noted,  include the peroxohydrates, sometimes known as peroxyhydrates or peroxohydrates. These are organic or, more commonly, inorganic salts capable of releasing hydrogen peroxide readily.   Peroxohydrates are the most common examples of "hydrogen peroxide source" materials and include the perborates, percarbonates, perphosphates,   and  persilicates.     Suitable peroxohydrates include sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate  and  equivalent  commercial  "percarbonate" bleaches, and any of the so-called sodium perborate hydrates, the "tetrahydrate" and "monohydrate" being preferred; though sodium pyrophosphate peroxyhydrate can be used. Many such peroxohydrates are available in processed forms with coatings, such as of silicate and/or borate and/or waxy materials and/or surfactants, or have particle geometries, such as compact spheres, which improve storage stability. By way of organic peroxohydrates, urea peroxyhydrate can also be useful herein.<br>
Percarbonate bleach includes, for example, dry particles having an average particle size in the range from about 500 micrometers to about 1,000 micrometers, not more than about 10% by weight of said particles being smaller than about 200 micrometers and not more than about 10% by weight of said particles being larger than about 1,250<br><br><br>
micrometers.   Percarbonates  and  perborates  are  widely  available  in   commerce,   for example from FMC, Solvay and Tokai Denka.<br>
Organic   percarboxylic   acids   useful   herein   as   the   oxygen   bleach   include magnesium   monoperoxyphthalate   hexahydrate,   available    from   Interox,    m-chloro perbenzoic     acid     and     its    salts,     4-nonylamino-4-oxoperoxybutyric     acid     and diperoxydodecanedioic  acid and  their salts.     Such  bleaches  are disclosed  in  U.S. 4,483,781, U.S.. Pat. Appl. 740,446, Burns et al, filed June 3, 1985, EP-A  133,354, published February 20, 1985, and U.S. 4,412,934.   Organic percarboxylic acids usable herein include those containing one, two or more peroxy groups, and can be aliphatic or aromatic.        Highly    preferred    oxygen    bleaches    also    include    6-nonylamino-6-oxoperoxycaproic acid (NAPAA) as described in U.S. 4,634,551.<br>
An extensive and exhaustive listing of useful oxygen bleaches, including inorganic peroxohydrates, organic peroxohydrates and the organic peroxyacids, including hydrophilic and hydrophobic mono- or di- peroxyacids, peroxycarboxylic acids, peroxyimidic acids, amidoperoxycarboxylic acids, or their salts including the calcium, magnesium, or mixed-cation salts, can be found in US Patents 5,622,646 and 5,686,014.<br>
Other   useful   peracids  and   bleach   activators   herein   are   in  the   family  of imidoperacids and imido bleach activators. These include phthaloylimidoperoxycaproic acid and related arylimido-substituted and acyloxynitrogen derivatives.   For listings of such  compounds,  preparations and their incorporation   into  laundry  compositions including  both   granules  and  liquids,  See  U.S.   5,487,818;   U.S.   5,470,988,   U.S. 5,466,825; U.S. 5,419,846; U.S. 5,415,796; U.S. 5,391,324; U.S. 5,328,634; U.S. 5,310,934; U.S. 5,279,757; U.S. 5,246,620; U.S.  5,245,075; U.S. 5,294,362; U.S. 5,423,998; U.S. 5,208,340; U.S. 5,132,431 and U.S. 5,087385.<br>
Useful diperoxyacids include, for example, 1,12-diperoxydodecanedioic acid (DPDA); 1,9-diperoxyazelaic acid; diperoxybrassilic acid; diperoxysebasic acid and diperoxyisophthalic acid; 2-decyldiperoxybutane-l,4-dioic acid; and 4,4'-sulphonylbisperoxybenzoic acid.<br>
More generally, the terms "hydrophilic" and "hydrophobic" used herein in connection with any of the oxygen bleaches, especially the peracids, and in connection<br><br><br>
with bleach activators, are in the first instance based on whether a given oxygen bleach effectively performs bleaching of fugitive dyes in solution thereby preventing fabric graying and discoloration and/or removes more hydrophilic stains such as tea, wine and grape juice - in this case it is termed "hydrophilic".  When the oxygen bleach or bleach activator has a significant stain removal, whiteness-improving or cleaning effect on dingy, greasy, carotenoid, or other hydrophobia soils, it is termed "hydrophobic". The terms are applicable"also when referring to peracids or bleach activators used  in combination with a hydrogen peroxide source. The current commercial benchmarks for hydrophilic performance of oxygen bleach systems are: TAED or peracetic acid, for benchmarking   hydrophilic   bleaching.   NOBS   or   NAPAA   are   the   corresponding benchmarks for hydrophobic bleaching.   The terms "hydrophilic", "hydrophobic" and "hydrotropic" with reference to oxygen bleaches including peracids and here extended to bleach activator have also been used somewhat more narrowly in the literature.  See especially Kirk Othmer's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Vol. 4., pages 284-285.   This reference provides a chromatographic retention time and critical micelle concentration-based set of criteria, and is useful to identify aijoVor characterize preferred sub-classes of hydrophobic, hydrophilic and hydrotropic oxygen bleaches and bleach activators that can be used in the present invention. Bleach Activators<br>
Bleach activators useful herein include amides, imides, esters and anhydrides. Commonly at least one substituted or unsubstituted acyl moiety is present, covalently connected to a leaving group as in the structure R-C(O)-L.  In one preferred mode of use, bleach activators are combined with a source of hydrogen peroxide, such as the perborates or percarbonates, in a single product. Conveniently, the single product leads to in situ production in aqueous solution (i.e., during the washing process) of the percarboxylic acid corresponding to the bleach activator.   The product itself can be hydrous, for example a powder, provided that water is controlled in amount and mobility such that storage stability is acceptable.   Alternately, the product can be an anhydrous solid or liquid.   In another mode, the bleach activator or oxygen bleach is incorporated in a pretreatment product, such as a stain stick; soiled, pretreated substrates can then be exposed to further treatments, for example of a hydrogen peroxide source.<br><br><br>
With respect to the above bleach activator structure RC(O)L, the atom in the leaving group connecting to the peracid-forming acyl moiety R(C)O- is most typically O or N. Bleach activators can have non-charged, positively or negatively charged peracid-forming moieties and/or noncharged, positively or negatively charged leaving groups. One or more peracid-forming moieties or leaving-groups can be present.    See, for example, U.S. 5,595,967, U.S. 5,561,235, U.S. 5,560,862 or the bis-(peroxy-carbonic) system of U.S. 5,534,179.    Mixtures of suitable bleach activators can also be used. Bleach  activators  can   be   substituted   with   electron-donating  or  electron-releasing moieties either in the leaving-group or in the peracid-forming moiety or moieties, changing their reactivity and making them more or less suited to particular pH or wash conditions.    For example, electron-withdrawing groups such as NO2 improve the efficacy of bleach activators intended for use in mild-pH (e.g., from about 7.5- to about 9.5) wash conditions.<br>
An extensive and exhaustive disclosure of suitable bleach activators and suitable leaving groups, as well as how to determine suitable activators, can be found in US Patents 5,686,014 and 5,622,646.<br>
Cationic bleach activators include quaternary carbamate-, quaternary carbonate-, quaternary ester- and quaternary amide- types, delivering a range of cationic peroxyimidic, peroxycarbonic or peroxycarboxylic acids to the wash. An analogous but non-cationic palette of bleach activators is available when quaternary derivatives are not desired. In more detail, cationic activators include quaternary ammonium-substituted activators of WO 96-06915, U.S. 4,751,015 and 4,397,757, EP-A-284292, EP-A-331,2,29 and EP-A-03520. Also useful are cationic nitriles as disclosed in EP-A-303,520 and in European Patent Specification 458,396 and 464,880. Other nitrile types have electron-withdrawing substituents as described in U.S. 5,591,378.<br>

Nos. 1,246,339; 3,332,882; 4,128,494; 4,412,934 and 4,675,393, and the phenol sulfonate ester of alkanoyl aminoacids disclosed in U.S. 5,523,434. Suitable bleach activators include any acetylated diamine types, whether hydrophilie or hydrophobia in character.<br><br><br>
Of the above classes of bleach precursors, preferred classes include the esters, including acyl phenol sulfonates, acyl alkyl phenol sulfonates or acyl oxybenzenesulfonates (OBS leaving-group); the acyl-amides; and the quaternary ammonium substituted peroxyacid precursors including the cationic nitriles.<br>
Preferred bleach activators include N,N,NrN'-tetraacetyl ethylene diamine (TAED) or any of its close relatives including the triacetyl or other unsymmetrical derivatives. TAED and the acetylated carbohydrates such as glucose pentaacetate and tetraacetyl xylose are preferred hydrophilic bleach activators. Depending on the application, acetyl triethyl citrate, a liquid, also has some utility, as does phenyl benzoate.<br>
Preferred   hydrophobic   bleach   activators   include  sodium   nonanoyloxybenzene sulfonate (NOBS or SNOBS), N-(alkanoyl)aminoalkanoyloxy benzene sulfonates, such as 4-[N-(nonanoyl)aminohexanoyloxy]-benzene sulfonate or (NACA-OBS) as described in US Patent 5,534,642 and in EPA 0 355 384 Al, substituted amide types described in detail hereinafter, such as activators related to NAPAA, and activators related to certain imidoperacid bleaches, for example as described in U.S. Patent 5,061,807, issued October 29, 1991 and assigned to Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft of Frankfurt, Germany and Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application (Kokai) No. 4-28799.<br>
Another group of peracids and bleach activators herein are those derivable from acyclic imidoperoxycarboxylic acids and salts thereof, See US Patent 5415796, and cyclic imidoperoxycarboxylic acids and salts thereof, see US patents 5,061,807, 5,132,431, 5,6542,69, 5,246,620, 5,419,864 and 5,438,147.<br>

Bleach activators may be used in an amount of up to 20%, preferably from 0.1-10% by weight, of the composition, though higher levels, 40% or more, are acceptable, for example in highly concentrated bleach additive product forms or forms intended for appliance automated dosing.<br>
Highly preferred bleach activators useful herein are amide-substituted and an extensive and exhaustive disclosure of these activators can be found in US Patents 5,686,014 and 5,622,646.<br>
Other useful activators, disclosed in U.S. 4,966,723, are benzoxazin-type, such as a C6H4 ring to which is fused in the 1,2-positions a moiety ~C(O)OC(R1)=N-. A highly preferred activator of the benzoxazin-type is:<br>
(Formula Removed),<br><br>
Depending on the activator and precise application, good bleaching results can be obtained from bleaching systems having with in-use pH of from about 6 to about 13, preferably from about 9.0 to about 10.5. Typically, for example, activators with electron-withdrawing moieties are used for near-neutral or sub-neutral pH ranges. Alkalis and buffering agents can be used to secure such pH.<br>
Acyl lactam activators are very .useful herein, especially the acyl caprolactams (see for example WO 94-28102 A) and acyl valerolactams (see U.S. 5,503,639").   See also U.S. 4,545,784 which discloses acyl caprolactams, including benzoyl caprolactam adsorbed into sodium perborate. In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, NOBS, lactam activators, imide activators or amide-functional activators, especially the more hydrophobic derivatives, are desirably combined with hydrophilic activators such as TAED, typically at weight ratios of hydrophobic activator : TAED in the range of 1:5 to 5:1, preferably about 1:1.   Other suitable lactam activators are alpha-modified, see WO 96-22350 Al, July 25, 1996.  Lactam activators, especially the more hydrophobic types, are desirably used in combination with TAED, typically at weight ratios of amido-derived or caprolactam activators.: TAED in the range of 1:5 to 5:1, preferably about 1:1.

Cobalt bleach catalysts useful herein are known, and are described, for example, in M. L. Tobe, "Base Hydrolysis of Transition-Metal Complexes", Adv. Inorg. Bioinorg. Mech.. (1983), 2, pages 1-94. The most preferred cobalt catalyst useful herein are cobalt pentaamine acetate salts having the formula [Co(NH3)5OAc] Ty, wherein "OAc" represents an acetate moiety and "Ty" is an anion, and especially cobalt pentaamine acetate chloride, [Co(NH3)5OAc]Cl2; as well as [Co(NH3)5OAc](OAc)2; [Co(NH3)5OAc](PF6)2; [Co(NH3)5OAc](SO4); [Co(NH3)5OAc](BF4)2; and [Co(NH3)5OAc](N03)2 (herein "PAC"). These cobalt catalysts are readily prepared by known procedures, such as taught for example in the Tobe article and the references cited therein, and in U.S. Patent 4,810,430, to Diakun et al, issued March 7,1989.<br>
Compositions herein may also suitably include as a bleach catalyst the class o: transition    metal    complexes    of   a    macropolycyclic    rigid    ligand.    The    phrase "macropolycyclic rigid ligand" is sometimes abbreviated as "MRL".  One useful MRL is [MnByclamC12],        where        "Bcyclam"         is        (5,12-dimethyl-l,5,8,12-tetraaza-bicyclo[6.6.2}hexadecane).  See PCT applications PCT/IB98/00298 (Attorney DocketNo 6527X)- PCT/B98/00299  (Attorney-Docket-No.  6537),  PCT/IB98/00300  (.Attorney Docket NO_6525XL&amp;), and PCT/IB98/00302 (Attomey Ducket NO-6524L#).    The amount used is a catalytically effective amount, suitably about 1 ppb or more, for example up to about 99.9%, more typically about 0.001 ppm or more, preferably from about 0.05 ppm to about 500 ppm (wherein "ppb" denotes parts per billion by weight and "ppm" denotes parts per million by weight).<br>
As a practical matter, and not by way of limitation, the compositions and cleaning processes herein can be adjusted to provide on the order of at least one part per hundred million of the active bleach catalyst species in the aqueous washing medium, and will preferably provide from about 0.01 ppm to about 25 ppm, more preferably from about 0.05 ppm to about 10 ppm, and most preferably from about. 0.1 ppm to about 5 ppm, of the bleach catalyst species in the wash liquor.   In order to obtain such levels in the wash liquor of an automatic washing process, typical compositions herein will comprise from about 0.0005% to about 0.2%, more preferably from about 0.004% to about 0.08%, of bleach catalyst, especially manganese or cobalt catalysts, by weight of the cleaning compositions. Enzymatic sources of hydrogen peroxide<br>
On a different track from the bleach activators illustrated hereinabove, another suitable hydrogen peroxide generating system is a combination of a Cj -C4 alkanol oxidase and a C\ -C4 alkanol, especially a combination of methanol oxidase (MOX) and ethanol. Such combinations are disclosed in WO 94/03003. Other enzymatic materials related to bleaching, such as peroxidases, haloperoxidases, oxidases, superoxide dismutases, catalases and their enhancers or, more commonly, inhibitors, may be used as optional ingredients in the instant compositions. Oxygen transfer agents and precursors<br>
Also useful herein are any of the known organic bleach catalysts, oxygen transfer agents or precursors therefor.    These include the compounds themselves and/or their precursors, for example any suitable ketone for production of dioxiranes and/or any of the hetero-atom   containing  analogs  of dioxirane   precursors  or  dioxiranes   ,   such   as •sulfonimines    RlR-C=NSO2R3,    see    EP    446    982    A,    published    1991     and sulfonyloxaziridines, see EP 446,981 A, published 1991.   Preferred examples of such materials include hydrophilic or hydrophobic ketones, used especially in conjunction with monoperoxysulfates to produce dioxiranes in situ, and/or the imines described in U.S. 5,576,282   and   references   described   therein.   Oxygen  bleaches  preferably  used   in conjunction with such oxygen transfer agents or precursors include percarboxylic acids and salts, percarbonic acids and salts, peroxymonosulfuric acid and salts, and mixtures thereof. See also U.S. 5,360,568; U.S. 5,360,569; U.S. 5,370,826 and US 5,442,066.<br>
Although oxygen bleach systems and/or their precursors may be susceptible to decomposition during storage in the presence of moisture, air (oxygen and/or carbon dioxide) and trace metals (especially rust or simple salts or colloidal oxides of the transition metals) and when subjected to light, stability can be improved by adding common sequestrants (chelants) and/or polymeric dispersants and/or a small amount of antioxidant  to  the bleach  system or product.     See,  for example,  U.S.  5,545,349. Antioxidants   are   often   added   to   detergent   ingredients  ranging  from   enzymes   to surfactants. Their presence is not necessarily inconsistent with use of an oxidant bleach; for example, the introduction of a phase barrier may be used to stabilize an apparently incompatible combination of an enzyme and antioxidant, on one hand, and an oxygen bleach, on the other. Although commonly known substances can be used as antioxidants, For example  see US Patents 5686014,  5622646, 5055218, 4853143, 4539130 and 4483778.      Preferred  antioxidants  are  3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene,   2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone and D,L-a!pha -tocopherol.<br>
Polymeric Soil Release Agent - The compositions according to the present invention may optionally comprise one or more soil release agents. Polymeric soil release agents are characterized by having both hydrophilic segments, to hydrophilize the surface of hydrophobic fsbers, such as polyester and nylon, and hydrophobic segments, to deposit upon hydrophobic fibers and remain adhered thereto through completion of the laundry<br><br>
cycle and , thus, serve as an anchor for the hydrophilic segments. This can enable stains occurring subsequent to treatment with the soil release agent to be more easily cleaned in later washing procedures.<br>
If utilized, soil release agents will generally comprise from about 0.01% to about 10% preferably from about 0.1% to about 5%, more preferably from about 0.2% to about 3% by weight, of the composition.<br>

Clay Soil Removal/Anti-redeposition Agents - The compositions of the present invention can also optionally contain water-soluble ethoxylated amines having clay soil removal and antiredeposition properties. Granular detergent compositions which contain these compounds typically contain from about 0.01% to about 10.0% by weight of the water-soluble ethoxylated amines; liquid detergent compositions typically contain about 0.01% to about 5%.<br><br>
A preferred soil release and anti-redeposition agent is ethoxylated tetraethylene pentamine. Exemplary ethoxylated amines are further described in U.S. Patent 4,597,898, VanderMeer,  issued July  1,   1986.     Another group of preferred clay soil  removal-antiredeposition  agents are   the  cationic  compounds   disclosed   in   European   Patent Application  111,965, Oh and Gosselink, published June 27,   1984.     Other clay soil removal/antiredeposition agents  which  can  be  used  include  the  ethoxylated  amine polymers disclosed in European Patent Application 111,984, Gosselink, published June 27, 1984; the zwitterionic polymers disclosed in European Patent Application 112,592, Gosselink, published July 4,   1984;  and the amine oxides disclosed  in U.S. Patent 4,548,744, Connor, issued  October 22,  1985.    Other clay soil  removal and/or anti redeposition agents known in the art can also be utilized in the compositions herein.   See U.S. Patent 4,891,160, VanderMeer, issued January 2, 1990 and WO 95/32272, published November 30,  1995.    Another type of preferred antiredeposition agent includes the carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) materials. These materials are well known in the art. Polymeric Dispersing Agents - Polymeric dispersing  agents can  advantageously be utilized at levels from about 0.1% to about 7%, by weight, in the compositions herein, especially in the presence of zeolite and/or layered silicate builders.   Suitable polymeric dispersing agents include polymeric polycarboxylates and polyethylene glycols, although others known in the art can also be used.   It is believed, though it is not intended to be limited by theory, that polymeric dispersing agents enhance overall detergent builder performance, when used in combination with other builders (including lower molecular weight polycarboxylates) by crystal growth inhibition, particulate soil release, peptization, and anti-redeposition.<br>
Polymeric polycarboxylate materials can be prepared by polymerizing or copolymerizing suitable unsaturated monomers, preferably in their acid form. Unsaturated monomeric acids that can be polymerized to form suitable polymeric polycarboxylates include acrylic acid, maleic acid (or maleic anhydride), fumaric acid, itaconic acid, aconitic acid, mesaconic acid, citraconic acid and methylenemalonic acid. The presence in the polymeric polycarboxylates herein or monomeric segments, containing no carboxylate radicals such as vinylmethyl ether, styrene, ethylene, etc. is suitable provided that such segments do not constitute more than about 40% by weight.<br><br>
Particularly suitable polymeric polycarboxylates can be derived from acrylic acid. Such acrylic acid-based polymers which are useful herein are the water-soluble salts of polymerized acrylic acid.   The average molecular weight of such polymers in the acid form preferably ranges from about 2,000 to 10,000, more preferably from about 4,000 to 7000 and most preferably from about 4,000 to 5,000.  Water-soluble salts ofsuch acrylic acid polymers can include, for example, the alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium  salts.     Soluble polymers  of this  type  are  known  materials.     Use   of polyacrylates of this type in detergent compositions has been disclosed, for example, in Diehl, U.S. Patent 3,308,067, issued March 7, 1967.<br>
Acrylic/maleic-based copolymers may also be used as a preferred component of the dispersing/anti-redeposition agent.   Such materials include the water-soluble salts of copolymers of acrylic acid and maleic acid.    The average molecular weight of such copolymers in the acid form preferably ranges from about 2,000 to  100,000, more preferably from about 5,000 to 75,000, most preferably from about 7,000 to 65,000.  The ratio of acrylate to maleate segments in such copolymers will generally range from about 30:1 to about 1:1, more preferably from about 10:1 to 2:1.   Water-soluble salts of such acrylic  acid/maleic   acid   copolymers   can   include,   for   example,   the   alkali   metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts. Soluble acrylate/maleate copolymers of this type are known materials which are described in European Patent Application No. 66915, published December 15, 1982, as well as in EP 193,360, published September 3, 1986, which also describes such polymers comprising hydroxypropylacrylate.  Still other useful dispersing agents include the maleic/acrylic/vinyl alcohol terpolymers. Such materials are also disclosed in EP   193,360,  including,  for example, the 45/45/10 terpolymer of acrylic/maleic/vinyl alcohol.<br>
Another polymeric material which can be included is polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEG can exhibit dispersing agent performance as well as act as a clay soil removal-antiredeposition agent. Typical molecular weight ranges for these purposes range from about 500 to about 100,000, preferably from about 1,000 to about 50,000, more preferably from about 1,500 to about 10,000.<br>
Polyaspartate and polyglutarnate dispersing agents may also be used, especially in conjunction with zeolite builders. Dispersing agents such as polyaspartate preferably have a molecular weight (avg.) of about 10,000.<br>
Other polymer types which may be more desirable for biodegradability, improved bleach stability, or cleaning purposes include various terpolymers and hydrophobically modified copolymers, including those marketed by Rohm &amp; Haas, BASF Corp., Nippon Shokubai and others for all manner of water-treatment, textile treatment, or detergent applications.<br>
Brightener - Any optical brighteners or other brightening or whitening agents known in the an can be incorporated at levels typically from about 0.01% to about 1.2%, by weight, into the detergent compositions herein when they are designed for fabric washing or treatment.<br>
Specific examples of optical brighteners which are useful in the present compositions are those identified in U.S. Patent 4,790,856, issued to Wixon on December 13, 1988. These brighteners include the PHORWHITE series of brighteners from Verona. Other brighteners disclosed in this reference include: Tinopal UNPA, Tinopal CBS and Tinopal 5BM; available from Ciba-Geigy; Arctic White CC and Arctic White CWD, the 2-(4-styryl-phenyl)-2H-naptho[l,2-d]triazoles; 4,4'-bis-(l,2,3-triazol-2-yl)-stilbenes; 4,4'-bis(styryl)bisphenyls; and the aminocoumarins.

Generally, such dye transfer inhibiting agents include polyvinyl pyrrolidone polymers, polyamine N-oxide polymers, copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole, manganese phthalocyanine, peroxidases, and mixtures thereof. If used, these agents typically comprise from about 0.01% to about 10% by weight of the composition, preferably from about 0.01% to about 5%, and more preferably from about 0.05% to about 2%. See US Patent 5,633,255 to Fredj.<br><br>
Chelating Agents - The detergent compositions herein may also optionally contain one or chelating agents, particularly chelating agents for adventitious transition metals. Those commonly found in wash water include iron and/or manganese in water-soluble, colloidal or paniculate  form, and may be associated  as oxides or hydroxides,  or found  in association with soils such as humic substances.   Preferred chelants are those which effectively control such transition metals, especially including controlling deposition of such transition-metals or their compounds on fabrics and/or controlling undesired redox reactions in the wash medium and/or at fabric or hard surface interfaces. Such chelating<br><br>
agents include those having low molecular weights as well as polymeric types, typically having at least one, preferably two or more donor heteroatoms such as O or N, capable of co-ordination to a transition-metal. Common chelating agents can be selected from the group consisting of aminocarboxylates, aminophosphonates, polyfunctionally-substituted aromatic chelating agents and mixtures thereof.<br>
If utilized, chelating agents will generally comprise from about 0.001% to about 15% by weight of the detergent compositions herein. More preferably, if utilized, chelating agents will comprise from about 0.01% to about 3.0% by weight of such compositions.<br>
Suds Suppressors - Compounds for reducing or suppressing the formation of suds can be incorporated into the compositions of the present invention when required by the intended use, especially washing of laundry in washing appliances. Other compositions, such as those designed for hand-washing, may desirably be high-sudsing and may omit such ingredients Suds suppression can be of particular importance in the so-called "high concentration cleaning process" as described in U.S. 4,489,455 and 4,489,574 and in front-loading European-style washing machines.<br>
A wide variety of materials may be used as suds suppressors and are well known in the art. See, for example, Kirk Othrner Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, Volume 7, pages 430-447 (Wiley, 1979).<br>
The compositions herein will generally comprise from 0% to about 10% of suds suppressor. When utilized as suds suppressors, monocarboxylic fatty acids, and salts thereof, will be present typically in amounts up to about 5%, preferably 0.5% - 3% by weight, of the detergent composition, although higher amounts may be used. Preferably<br><br>
from about 0.01% to about 1% of silicone suds suppressor is used, more preferably from about 0.25% to about 0.5%. These weight percentage values include any silica that may be utilized in combination with polyorganosiloxane, as well as any suds suppressor adjunct materials that may be utilized.    Monostearyl phosphate suds suppressors are generally utilized in vomits ranging from about 0. i% to about 2%, by weight, of the composition.    Hydrocarbon suds suppressors are typically utilized in amounts ranging from about 0.01% to about 5.0%, although higher levels can be used.   The alcohol suds suppressors are typically used at 0.2%-3% by weight of the finished compositions. Alkoxvlated Polvcarboxylates - Alkoxylated polycarboxylates such as those prepared from polyacrylates are useful herein to provide additional grease removal performance. Such materials are described in WO 91/08281  and PCT 90/01815  at p. 4 et seq., incorporated herein by reference.   Chemically, these materials comprise polyacrylates having one ethoxy side-chain per every 7-8 acrylate units.   The side-chains are of the formula -(CH2CH2O)m(CH2)nCH3 wherein m is 2-3 and n is 6-12.  The side-chains are ester-linked to the polyacrylate "backbone" to provide a "comb" polymer type structure. The molecular weight can vary, but is typically in the range of about 2000 to about 50,000.   Such alkoxylated polycarboxylates can comprise from about 0.05% to about 10%, by weight, of the compositions herein.<br>
Fabric Softeners - Various through-the-wash fabric softeners, especially the impalpable smectite clays of U.S. Patent 4,062,647, Storm and Nirschl, issued December 13, 1977, as well as other softener clays known in the art, can optionally be used typically at levels of from about 0.5% to about 10% by weight in the present compositions to provide fabric softener benefits concurrently with fabric cleaning.    Clay softeners can be used in combination with amine and cationic softeners as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent 4,375,416, Crisp et al, March 1, 1983 and U.S. Patent 4,291,071, Harris et al, issued September 22,  1981.    Moreover, in laundry cleaning methods herein, known fabric softeners, including biodegradable types, can be used in pretreat, mainwash, post-wash and dryer-added modes.<br>
Perfumes - Perfumes and perfumery ingredients useful in the present compositions and processes comprise a wide variety of natural and synthetic chemical ingredients, including, but not limited to, aldehydes, ketones, esters, .and the like. Also included are<br><br>
various natural extracts and essences which can comprise complex mixtures of ingredients, such as orange oil, lemon oil, rose extract, lavender, musk, patchouli, balsamic essence, sandalwood oil, pine oil, cedar, and the like.. Finished perfumes typically comprise from about 0.01% to about 2%, by weight, of the detergent compositions herein, and individual perfumery ingredients can comprise from about 0.0001% to about 90% of a finished perfume composition.<br>
Other Ingredients - A wide vanety of other ingredients useful in detergent compositions can be included in the compositions herein, including other active ingredients, carriers, hydrotropes, processing aids, dyes or pigments, solvents for liquid formulations, solid<br>
A<br>
fillers for bar compositions, etc. If high sudsing is desired, suds boosters such as the C10-Cig alkanolamides can be incorporated into the compositions, typically at  1%-10% levels. The C10-C14 monoethanol and diethanol amides illustrate a typical class of such suds boosters.   Use of such suds boosters with high sudsing adjunct surfactants such as the amine oxides, betaines and sultaines noted above is also advantageous.   If desired, water-soluble magnesium and/or calcium salts such as MgCl2, MgSO4, CaCl2, CaSO4 and the like, can be added at levels of, typically, 0.1%-2%, to provide additional suds and to enhance grease removal performance, especially for liquid dishwashing purposes.<br>
Various detersive ingredients employed in the present compositions optionally can be further stabilized by absorbing said ingredients onto a porous hydrophobic substrate, then coating said substrate with a hydrophobic coating. Preferably, the detersive ingredient is admixed with a surfactant before being absorbed into the porous substrate. In use, the detersive ingredient is released from the substrate into the aqueous washing liquor, where it performs its intended detersive function.<br>
Liquid detergent compositions can contain water and other solvents as carriers. Low molecular weight primary or secondary alcohols exemplified by methanol, ethanol, propanol, and isopropanol are suitable. Monohydric alcohols are preferred for solubilizing surfactant, but polyols such as those containing from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms and from 2 to about 6 hydroxy groups (e.g., 1,3-propanediol, ethylene glycol, glycerine, and 1,2-propanediol) can also be used. The compositions may contain from 5% to 90%, typically 10% to 50% of such carriers.<br><br>
The detergent compositions herein will preferably be formulated such that, during use in aqueous cleaning operations, the wash water will have a pH of between about 6.5 and about 11, preferably between about 7.0 and 10.5, more preferably between about 7.0 to about 9.5.   Liquid dishwashing product formulations preferably have a pH between about 6.8 and about 9.0.   Laundry products are typically at pH 9-11.   Techniques for controlling pH at recommended usage levels include the use of buffers, alkalis, acids, etc., and are well known to those skilled in the art. Form of the compositions<br>
The compositions in accordance with the invention can take a variety of physical forms including granular, gel, tablet, bar and liquid forms. The compositions include the so-called concentrated granular detergent compositions adapted to be added to a washing machine by means of a dispensing device placed in the machine drum with the soiled fabric load.<br>
The mean particle size of the components of granular compositions in accordance with the invention should preferably be such that no more that 5% of particles are greater than 1.7mm in diameter and not more than 5% of particles are less than 0.15mm in diameter.<br>
The term mean particle size as defined herein is calculated by sieving a sample of the composition into a number of fractions (typically 5 fractions) on a series of Tyler sieves. The weight fractions thereby obtained are plotted against the aperture size of the sieves. The mean particle size is taken to be the aperture size through which 50% by weight of the sample would pass.<br>
Certain preferred granular detergent compositions in accordance with the present invention are the high-density types, now common in the marketplace; these typically have a bulk density of at least 600 g/litre, more preferably from 650 g/litre to 1200 g/litre. High Density Detergent Composition Processes<br>
Various means and equipment are available to prepare high density (i.e., greater than about 550, preferably greater than about 650, grams/liter or "g/O, high solubility, free-flowing, granular detergent compositions according to the present invention. Current commercial practice in the field employs spray-drying towers to manufacture granular laundry detergents which often have a density less than about 500 g/1. In this procedure.<br><br>
an aqueous slurry of various heat-stable ingredients in the final detergent composition are formed into homogeneous granules by passage through a spray-drying tower, using conventional techniques, at temperatures of about 175°C to about 225°C. However, if spray drying is used as part of the overall process herein, additional or alternative process stens as described hereinafter must be used to obtain the level of density (i.e.. &gt; 650 g/1) required by modem compact, low dosage detergent products.<br>
For example, spray-dried granules from a tower can be densified further by loading a liquid such as water or a nonionic surfactant into the pores of the granules and/or subjecting them to one or more high speed mixer/densifiers.    A suitable high speed mixer/densifier for this process is a device marketed under the tradename "Lodige CB 30" or "Lodige CB 30 Recycler" which comprises a static cylindrical mixing drum having a central rotating shaft with mixing/cutting blades mounted thereon. In use, the ingredients for the detergent composition are introduced into the drum and the shaft/blade assembly is rotated at speeds in the range of 100-2500 rpm to provide thorough mixing/densification. See Jacobs et al, U.S. Patent 5,149,455, issued September 22, 1992, and U.S. Patent 5.565,422, issued October 15, 1996 to Del Greco et al.  Other such apparatus includes the devices marketed under the tradename "Shugi Granulator" and under the tradename "Drais K-TTP 80).<br>
Another process step which can be used to densify further spray-dried granules involves   treating   the   spray-dried   granules   in   a   moderate   speed   mixer/densifier. Equipment such as that marketed under the tradename "Lodige KM" (Series 300 or 600) or "Lodige Ploughshare"  mixer/densifiers are suitable for this process step.     Such equipment is typically operated at 40-160 rpm.    The residence time of the detergent ingredients in the moderate speed mixer/densifier is from about 0.1  to  12 minutes conveniently measured by dividing the  steady state mixer/densifier weight  by the throughput (e.g., Kg/hr).   Other useful equipment includes the device which is available under the tradename "Drais K-T 160". This process step which employs a moderate speed mixer/densifier (e.g.   Lodige  KM)  can   be   used  by  itself or sequentially  with  the aforementioned high speed mixer/densifier (e.g.  Lodige CB) to achieve the desired density.    Other types of granules manufacturing apparatus useful herein include the apparatus disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,306,898, to G, L. Heller, December 29, 1942.<br>
While it may be more suitable to use the high speed mixer/densifier followed by the low speed mixer/densifier, the reverse sequential mixer/densifier configuration also can be used.   One or a combination of various parameters including residence times in the mixer/densifiers,    operating    temperatures   of   the   equipment,    temperature    and/or composition of the granules, the use of adjunct ingredients such as liquid binders and flow aids, can be used to optimize densification of the spray-dried granules in the process of the invention.     By way of example, see the processes in Appel et al, U.S.  Patent 5,133,924, issued July 28, 1992; Delwel et al, U.S. Patent 4,637,891, issued January 20, 1987; Kruse et al, U.S. Patent 4,726,908, issued February 23, 1988; and,  Bortolotti et al, U.S. Patent 5,160,657, issued November 3, 1992.<br>
In those situations in which particularly heat sensitive or highly volatile detergent ingredients are to be incorporated into the final detergent composition, processes which do not include spray drying towers are preferred.  The formulator can eliminate the spray-drying step by feeding, in either a continuous or batch mode, starting detergent ingredients directly into mixing equipment that is commercially available. One particularly preferred embodiment involves charging a surfactant paste and an anhydrous material into a high speed mixer/densifier (e.g. Lodige CB) followed by a moderate speed mixer/densifier (e.g. Lodige KM) to form high density detergent agglomerates.   See Capeci et al, U.S. Patent 5,366,652, issued November 22, 1994 and Capeci et al, U.S. Patent 5,486,303, issued January 23, 1996.    Optionally, the liquid/solids ratio of the starting detergent ingredients in such a process can be selected to obtain high density agglomerates that are more free flowing and crisp. See Capeci et al, U.S. Patent 5,565,137, issued October 15, 1996.<br>
Optionally, the process may include one or more recycle streams of undersized particles produced by the process which are fed back to the mixer/densifiers for further agglomeration or build-up. The oversized particles produced by this process can be sent to grinding apparatus and then fed back to the mixing/densifying equipment. These additional recycle process steps facilitate build-up agglomeration of the starting detergent ingredients resulting in a finished composition having a uniform distribution of the desired particle size (400-700 microns) and density (&gt; 550 g/1). See Capeci et al, U.S. Patent 5,516,448, issued May 14, 1996 and Capeci et al, U.S. Patent 5,489,392, issued<br><br>
February 6, 1996. Other suitable processes which do not call for the use of spray-drying towers are described by Bollier et al, U.S. Patent 4,828,721, issued May 9, 1989; Beerse et al, U.S. Patent 5,108,646, issued April 28, 1992; and, Jolicoeur, U.S. Patent 5,178,798, issued January 12, 1993.<br>
In yet another embodiment, a high density detergent composition using a fluidized bed mixer.    In this process, the various ingredients of the finished composition are combined in an aqueous slurry (typically 80% solids content) and sprayed into a fluidized bed to provide the finished detergent granules. Prior to the fluidized bed, this process can optionally include the step of mixing the slurry using the aforementioned Lodige CB mixer/densifier or a "Flexomix 160" mixer/densifier, available from Shugi.  Fluidized bed or moving beds of the type available under the tradename "Escher Wyss" can be used in such processes.<br>
Another suitable process which can be used herein involves feeding a liquid acid precursor of an anionic surfactant, an alkaline inorganic material (e.g. sodium carbonate) and optionally other detergent ingredients into a high speed mixer/densifier so as to form particles containing a partially or totally neutralized anionic surfactant salt and the other starting detergent ingredients. Optionally, the contents in the high speed mixer/densifier can be sent to a moderate speed mixer/densifier (e.g. Lodige KM) for further mixing resulting in the finished high density detergent composition. See Appel et al, U.S. Patent 5,164,108, issued November 17, 1992.<br>
Optionally, high density detergent compositions according to the invention can be produced by blending conventional or densified spray-dried detergent granules with detergent agglomerates in various proportions (e.g. a 60:40 weight ratio of granules to agglomerates) produced by one or a combination of the processes discussed herein. See U.S. Patent 5,569,645, issued October 29, 1996 to Dinniwell et al. Additional adjunct ingredients such as enzymes, perfumes, brighteners and the like can be sprayed or admixed with the agglomerates, granules or mixtures thereof produced by the processes discussed herein.<br>
Laundry washing method<br><br>
Machine laundry methods herein typically comprise treating soiled laundry with an aqueous wash solution in a washing machine having dissolved or dispensed therein an effective amount  of a machine  laundry detergent  composition   in   accord  with  the invention. By an effective amount of the detergent composition it is here meant from 40g to 300g of product dissolved or dispersed in a wash solution of volume from 5 to 65 litres, as are typical product dosages and wash solution volumes commonly employed in conventional machine laundry methods.<br>
As noted, surfactants are used herein in detergent compositions, preferably in combination with other detersive surfactants, at levels which are effective for achieving at least a directional improvement in cleaning performance. In the context of a fabric laundry composition, such "usage levels" can vary widely, depending not only on the type and severity of the soils and stains, but also on the wash water temperature, the volume of wash water and the type of washing machine.<br>
In a preferred use aspect a dispensing device is employed in the washing method. The dispensing device is charged with the detergent product, and is used to introduce the product directly into the drum of the washing machine before the commencement of the wash cycle. Its volume capacity should be such as to be able to contain sufficient detergent product as would normally be used in the washing method.<br>
Once the washing machine has been loaded with laundry the dispensing device containing the detergent product is placed inside the drum. At the commencement of the wash cycle of the washing machine water is introduced into the drum and the drum periodically rotates. The design of the dispensing device should be such that it permits containment of the dry detergent product but then allows release of this product during the wash cycle in response to its agitation as the drum rotates and also as a result of its contact with the wash water.<br>
Alternatively, the dispensing device may be a flexible container, such as a bag or pouch. The bag may be of fibrous construction coated with a water impermeable protective material so as to retain the contents, such as is disclosed in European published Patent Application No. 0018678. Alternatively it may be formed of a water-insoluble synthetic polymeric material provided with an edge seal or closure designed to rupture in aqueous media as disclosed in European published Patent Application Nos. 0011500,<br><br><br>
0011501, 0011502, and 0011968. A convenient form of water frangible closure comprises a water soluble adhesive disposed along and sealing one edge of a pouch formed of a water impermeable polymeric film such as polyethylene or polypropylene.<br>
