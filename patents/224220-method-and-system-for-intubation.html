BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <br>
The  present invention will be understood and appreciated from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the drawings in which:<br>
Fig.   1  is a simplified pictorial illustration of a intubation system and <br>
15     functionality constructed and operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention; and<br>
Figs. 2A, 2B, 2C and 2D are simplified diagrammatic illustrations of four alternative embodiments of the system of Fig. 1.<br>
20	DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 1, which is a simplified pictorial illustration of an intubation system and functionality constructed and operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As seen in Fig. 1, there is preferably provided an intubation system and<br>
25    method wherein an endotracheal tube 10 is inserted into a patient airway. An inflatable cuff 12 is preferably associated with the endotracheal tube 10 and arranged to be located at a location in the patient airway 11 below the vocal cords. Both the endotracheal tube 10 and the inflatable cuff 12 may be entirely conventional or alternatively may be adapted to integrate features of the present invention, as described hereinbelow. The<br>
30   endotracheal tube 10 may be coupled to a ventilator (not shown) in a conventional manner and the inflatable cuff 12 may be connected to a manually operated or automatically operated inflation device (not shown), also in a conventional manner.<br>
4<br><br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention a<br>
carbon dioxide monitor 14 is provided and is operative to monitor carbon dioxide<br>
concentration in the patient airway  11  at a carbon dioxide monitoring location  16<br>
between the cuff 12 and the vocal cords. Preferably a carbon dioxide monitoring conduit<br>
5      18 is provided for coupling the monitor 14 to the monitoring location 16.<br>
A suctioning device 20 is preferably provided for suctioning secretions at a suctioning location 22 between the cuff 12 and the vocal cords.<br>
It is a particular feature of the present invention that the carbon dioxide<br>
monitor 14 provides an accurate indication of adequate sealing of the patient's airway 11<br>
10      by the inflated cuff 12, thus enabling minimum effective inflation to be provided,<br>
thereby to minimize damage to the patient's airway 11. The accurate and minimally<br>
invasive sealing of the patient's airway 11 combined with operation of suctioning device<br>
20 for removal of secretions at suctioning location 22 upstream of the cuff 12 enables<br>
infections to be reduced by effectively preventing such secretions to enter the airway 11<br>
15      downstream of the cuff 12.  This effective preventing is the result both of highly<br>
effective sealing of the airway 11 and of removal of such secretions upstream of the cuff<br>
12. It is appreciated that the efficacy of the suction produced by suctioning device 20 at<br>
suctioning location 22 is enhanced by the provision of highly effecting sealing of the<br>
airway at cuff 12.<br>
20	It   is   appreciated  that  in   accordance  with   one  embodiment  of the<br>
invention, the cuff inflator may operate automatically based on an accurate output from<br>
the carbon dioxide monitor.<br>
