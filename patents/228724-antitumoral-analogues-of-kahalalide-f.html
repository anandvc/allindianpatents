DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
We have identified analogues of kahalalide F that show significant improvement in activity with respect to kahalalide F.<br>
The present invention is directed to compounds of formula 1<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein one or more exocyclic or cyclic amino acids have been substituted by other natural or non natural amino acids, have been masked with organic groups or have been removed. The present invention is also directed to compounds of formula 1 wherein the aliphatic methylhexanoic acyl group has been substituted by other acyl groups or has been removed.<br>
Exocyclic Amino Acids<br>
Preferred compounds of the invention include those of formula 1 wherein one or more amino acids of the exocyclic chain have been<br><br>
substituted by other natural or non natural amino acids, have been masked with organic groups or have been removed.<br>
In particular, preferred compounds include those with 1, 2 or 3 replacement amino acids in the exocyclic chain; and those with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 removed amino acids in the exocyclic chain.<br>
Especially preferred are those compounds of formula 1 wherein one exocyclic amino acid has been substituted by another natural or non natural amino acid, and/or has been masked with one or more substituent organic groups. This preference is specially applicable to the L-Orn amino acid in position 8.<br>
Thus, in one aspect of the present invention, there are provided compounds of formula 1 wherein there is not L-Orn at position 8.<br>
The L-Orn can be replaced by D-Orn, or by another natural or<br>
non-natural amino acid. For example, the L-Orn can be replaced by a<br>
natural amino acid, such as lysine; or a masked natural amino acid,<br>
such as arginine or lysine with one or more alkyl, phenyl or<br>
oligomethylene subsituents, for example N(Me)2,N'(Me)2-Arg,<br>
N(Me,Ph),N'(Me)2-Arg,	N(CH2)4,N'(Me)2-Arg,	N(CH2)4,N'(CH2)4-Arg,<br>
NE(Me)3-Lys.<br>
The L-Orn can be masked. For example, the amino group of the L-Orn may have substituents, notably alkyl substituients that may be further substituted, notably with heterocyclic groups, for example N6(CHN(CH2)4,N'(CH2)4)-Orn; or more complex substituents as in biotinylornithine or Orn(N5Tfa).<br>
Cyclic Amino Acids<br><br>
Other preferred compounds of the invention include those of formula 1 wherein one or more amino acids of the cyclic chain have been substituted by other natural or non natural amino acids, have been masked with organic groups or have been removed.<br>
In particular, preferred compounds include those with 1, 2 or 3 replacement amino acids in the cyclic chain.<br>
Especially preferred are those compounds of formula 1 wherein one or more amino acids have been substituted by other natural or non natural amino acids, and/or have been masked with organic groups. This preference is specially applicable to the L-Phe amino acid in position 3.<br>
Thus, in one aspect of the present invention, there are provided compounds of formula 1 wherein the L-Phe at position 3 has been replaced or masked.<br>
The L-Phe can be replaced by D-Phe, or by another natural or non-natural amino acid. For example, the L-Phe can be replaced by a natural amino acid, such as tyrosine; an alkyl-substituted amino acid, such as N-methyltyrosine; an aryl-substituted amino acid, such as 2-amino-3-biphenyl-4-yl-propionic acid, 2-amino-3-naphthalen-2-yl-propionic acid or aminophenylacetic acid; an heterocyclyl-substituted amino acid, such as 2-amino-3-thiophen-2-ylpropionic acid; or a cyclic amino acid where the amino group is part of a heterocycle, such as l,2,3,4-tetraisoquinoline-3-carboxilic acid or octahydroisoindole-1-carboxylic acid.<br><br>
The L-Phe can be masked. For example, the phenyl ring may be<br>
partially or fully saturated, and may be substituted with one or more<br>
substituents. Substituents for the phenyl ring may be as indicated,<br>
preferably   halo   or   nitro.	The   amino   group   may   have    1   or   2<br>
substituents,   notably   alkyl   such   as   methyl,   especially    1   methyl substituent.<br>
Terminal Acyl Group<br>
Besides the modification of the amino acids of the exocyclic chain and/or of the cyclic part, there can also be compounds with a modification in the terminal acyl group of the exocyclic chain.<br>
For example, the acyl group can comprise one or more substituents, especially aromatic, heterocyclic or carbocyclic groups which in turn may have one or more subsitutents, for example can be a benzoyl group which may have one or more substituents, a phenylalkanoyl which may have one or more substituents or a cinnamoyl which may have one or more substituents. Additionally, the terminal acyl group can be another fatty acid typically a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid with 3 to 26 carbon atoms, more especially 12 to 20 carbon atoms.<br>
Typical groups for adoption in place of the terminal acyl group in formula 1 include:<br>
- Straight chain alkanoyl with up to 26 carbon atoms and with one or more substituents, especially substituents chosen from optionally substituted cycloalkyl such as 4-methylcyclohexyl; alkyl, especially short chain alkyl such as methyl; optionally substituted aryl<br><br>
especially phenyl such as difluorophenyl; halo such as fluoro up to perfluoro; oxo; amino; or imino.<br>
-	Optionally substituted benzoyl such as benzoyl itself, p-<br>
methylbenzoyl acid, p-trifluoromethylbenzoyl acid, piperonyloyl.<br>
-	Arylalkenoyl group with preferably two carbon atoms in the<br>
alkenoyl especially a cinnamoyl group such as p-<br>
trifluoromethylcinnamoyl.<br>
Moreover, the acyl group can be replaced by another acyl group, preferably of formula R'CO-. R' is as defined and is suitably alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, heterocyclyl, or carbocyclyl, and may itself be substituted.<br>
Finally, there can be compounds with a unique modification located in the fatty acid of the exocyclic chain, the provision of a 5-methyhexyl terminal group.<br>
Combined Changes<br>
The possible changes in the exocyclic amino acids, cyclic amino acids and terminal acyl group can be taken in combination.<br>
Thus, other preferred compounds of the invention are those of formula 1 wherein one or more amino acids of the exocyclic chain and/or one or more amino acids of the cyclic part have been modified, as mentioned above and/or the terminal acyl group has been modified.<br>
The compounds where the L-Orn at position 8 has been replaced or masked may adopt other preferred modifications, including a 4(S)-methylhexyl or other group in the terminal group of the sidechain.<br><br>
The compounds where the L-Phe at position 3 has been replaced or masked may adopt other preferred modifications, including a 4(S)-methylhexyl or other group in the terminal group of the sidechain.<br>
Examples of substituent groups include C1-C18 alkyl, C2-C18<br>

The terms alkenyl and alkynyl as used herein refer to both cyclic and noncyclic groups, although straight or branched noncyclic<br><br>
groups are generally more preferred. In a general sense, we include alkylidene within alkenyl, they both being substituents with a double bond.<br>
Suitable aryl groups in the compounds of the present invention include single and multiple ring compounds, including multiple ring compounds that contain separate and/or fused aryl groups. Typical aryl groups contain from 1 to 3 separated or fused rings and from 6 to about 18 carbon ring atoms.

acceptable   derivatives   or   prodrugs   thereof.	A   "pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable derivative or prodrug" means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, salt of an ester or other derivative of a compound of this invention that, upon administration to a recipient, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound of this invention or a metabolite or residue thereof. Particularly favoured derivatives and prodrugs are those that increase the bioavailability of the compounds of this invention when such compounds are administered to a patient (e.g., by allowing an orally administered compound to be more readily absorbed into the blood), enhance delivery of the parent compound to a given biological compartment, increase solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism or alter rate of excretion.<br>
Salts of the compounds of the present invention may comprise acid addition salts derived from a nitrogen in the compound of formula 1 or 2. The therapeutic activity resides in the moiety derived from the compound of the invention as defined herein and the identity of the other component is of less importance although for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes it is, preferably, pharmaceutically acceptable to the patient. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from mineral acids, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, metaphosphoric, nitric and sulphuric acids, and organic acids, such as tartaric, acetic, trifluoroacetic, citric, malic, lactic, fumaric, benzoic, glycolic, gluconic, succinic and methanesulphonic and arylsulphonic, for example p-toluenesulphonic,<br>
acids.	Preferred   salts   include   the   trifluoroacetate   salt   and   the<br>
hydrochloride salt.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to the synthetic process described in WO 01 58934, or according to the improved process as described herein. Therefore also encompassed by the invention is a process to prepare a compound according to formula 1.<br>
The key steps of the optimized process for a more economical and safe synthesis of kahalalide F and its analogues are: (i) partial incorporation of Fmoc-D-Val-OH onto the chlorotritylchloro-polystyrene resin for a initial loading of 0.5 mmol/g; (ii) use as coupling method of DIPCDI-HOBt, instead of HATU-DIPEA, for the sequential incorporation of the protected amino acids and aliphatic carboxylic acids; (iii) cyclization step with DIPCDI/HOBt/DIPEA in CH2CI2; these conditions avoids two side reaction: epimerisation of the Val residue, which is involved in the activation, and trifluoroacetylation of the Phe or its replacement; (iv) use of sodium diethyl-dithiocarbamate after removing Alloc to avoid presence of Pd (0) in the final product.<br>
The synthesis is preferably a solid phase synthetic process.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the synthetic process of the present invention is best represented in the Scheme 1, which is directed to the formation of the target compounds.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Scheme 1<br>
As shown above in Scheme 1, the preferred process for the synthetic formation of analogues of kahalalide F is based in a solid-phase approach, see for example Lloyd-Williams, P., et al. Chemical Approaches to the Synthesis of Peptides and Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton (FL), 1997 and followed with modifications of the method already<br>
described for the preparation kahalalide F and some of its analogues (WO 01 58934).<br>
The process of Scheme 1 comprises the sequential steps of:<br>
(a)	incorporating an Fmoc-DVal-OH onto a chlorotrityl chloro resin, forming an ester bond;<br>
(b)	elongating the peptidic chain with three amino acids [Dalle, DaThr (free OH), Dalle) using a Fmoc/tfBu strategy;<br><br>
(c)	incorporating [Val(l)] using an Alloc/ £Bu strategy;<br>
(d)	elongating the peptidic chain with the remaining amino acids and aliphatic carboxylic acids using a Fmoc/ffiu strategy;<br>
(el) incorporating the dipeptide Alloc-Phe-ZDhb-OH, which has been combined and dehydrated in solution;<br>
(e2a) elongating the peptidic chain with two amino acids, preferably Thr and Phe. The OH of Thr is unprotected and the amino group of Phe, or its replacement, is protected with Fmoc or preferably with Alloc; in some cases if it is protected with Fmoc, this is removed and Alloc is introduced in solid-phase;<br>
(e2b) dehydrating in solid-phase to give the didehydropeptide;<br>
(f) removing the Alloc/Fmoc group of Phe, or of its replacement, while the peptide is still anchored to the solid support;<br>
(g) cleaving the side-chain protected peptide from the solid support;<br>
(h) cyclizing the peptide in solution;<br>
(i) removing TFA labile side chain protecting groups.<br>
(j) Further modifications of functional(s) group(s) in solution phase.<br>
Therefore the process can be conducted as follows:<br>
Fmoc-DVal-OH is incorporated preferably to a chlorotrityl-polystyrene resin, see Barlos, K.; Gatos, D.; Schafer, W. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1991, 30, 590-593, in the presence of DIPEA keeping the level of substitution of aprox. 0.5 mmol/g. The use of higher loadings brings the presence of terminated peptides in the final product, see Chiva, C; Vilaseca, M.; Giralt, E.; Albericio, F. J. Pept. Sci. 1999, 5, 131-140.<br>
All solvent ratios are volume/volume unless stated otherwise.<br>
Removal of the Fmoc group can be carried out with piperidine-DMF (2:8, v/v) (1x2 min, 2 x 10 min). Couplings of Fmoc-aa-OH (4-5 equiv) and the acids at the 14-position can be carried out with DIPCDI-HQBt (equimolar amounts of each one respect to the carboxylic component) or PyBOP-DIPEA (equimolar amount of PyBOP and double amount of DIPEA) in DMF or DMF-Toluene (1:1) for 90 min. After the coupling ninhydrin or chloranil tests are carried out and if it is positive the coupling is repeated in the same conditions, otherwise the process is continued.      Washings between deprotection, coupling, and, again,<br>
deprotection steps can be carried out with DMF (5 x 0.5 min) and CH2CI2 (5 x 0.5 min) using for example each time 10 mL solvent/g resin.<br>
Incorporation of Alloc-Val-OH (5 equiv) can be carried out with equimolar amount of DIPCDI and 10% of DMAP. This coupling is repeated at least twice.<br>
Removal of Alloc group can be carried out with Pd(PPh3)4 (0.1 equiv) in the presence of PhSiH3 (10 equiv), see Gomez-Martinez, P.; Thieriet, N.; Albericio, F.; Guibe, F. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I 1999, 2871-2874, and washing the resin with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate in DMF 0.02 M(3x 15 min).<br>
The dipeptide Alloc-Phe-ZDhb-OH (4 equiv), which was prepared in solution from Alloc-Phe-OH and H-Thr-OtBu with EDCHC1, and posterior dehydration and treatment with TFA, can be coupled with DIPCDI-HOAt (4 equiv of each) for 5 h to overnight. The use of other coupling reagents based in HOBt, such as HBTU or DIPCDI-HOBt, has led to incomplete incorporations of the dipeptide.<br>
Dehydration can be carried out in solid-phase with EDCHC1 (water soluble carbodiimide, 20 equiv) in the presence of CuCl (12 equiv) in CH2CI2-DMF (9:1) for 7 days. EDCHCl/CuCl has been used by dehydration in solution of a residue of Thr in a fragment of Nisin (Fukase, K.; Kitazawa, M.; Sano, A.; Shimbo, K.; Horimoto, S.; Fujita, H.; Kubo, A.; Wakamiya, T.; Shibe, A. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1992, 65, 2227-2240) and in solid-phase for the preparation of didehydropeptides from Thr, Ser, and phenylserine (Royo, M.; Jimenez, J.C.; Lopez-Macia, A.; Giralt, E.; Albericio, F. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2001, 45-48).<br>
Cleavage of the protected peptide from the resin can be accomplished by TFA-CH2CI2 (1:99) (5 x 30 sec).<br>
Cyclization step can be carried out with DIPCDI/HOBt/DIPEA in CH2CI2. These conditions avoid two side reactions: epimerisation of the Val residue, which is involved in the activation, and trifluoroacetylation of the Phe or its replacement.<br>
Final deprotection can be carried out with TFA-H2O (95:5) for 1 hour.<br>
It will be appreciated that the particular choice of protecting groups is not critical, and other choices are widely available. For example, Bzl type groups can replace tBu/Boc; Boc instead of Fmoc; Fmoc instead of Alloc; Wang resin instead of chlorotrityl.<br>
Further detail on the synthesis is given in the examples.<br>
The process of this invention can be carried out from starting materials in an enantio-, stereocontrolled and fast manner, taking advantages of the solid-phase synthetic methodology, where the molecule in construction is bounded to an insoluble support during all synthetic operations.<br>

Step 1 H-D-Val-O-TrtCl-resin.<br>
Cl-TrtCl-resin (1 g, 1.64 mmol/g) was placed in a 20 mL polypropylene syringe fitted with a polyethylene filter disk. The resin was then washed with CH2CI2 (5 x 0.5 min), and a solution of Fmoc-D-Val-OH (238 mg, 0.7 mmol, 0.7 equiv) and DIPEA (0.41 mL) in CH2CI2 (2.5 mL) was added, and the mixture was stirred for 15 min, when extra DIPEA (0.81 mL, total 7 equiv, 7 mmol) and the mixture stirred for 45 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of MeOH (800 jiL), after a stirring of 10 min. The Fmoc-D-Val-O-TrtCl-resin was subjected to the following washings/treatments with CH2CI2 (3 x 0.5 min), DMF (3 x 0.5 min), piperidine as indicated in General Procedures, and DMF (5 x 0.5 min).

Biological activity<br>
The bioactivity of compounds of this invention is demonstrated by the results in the following tables obtained in accordance with the methodology described as follows:<br>
The finality of this assay is to interrupt the growth of a "in vitro" tumor cell culture by means a continued exhibition of the cells to the sample to be testing.<br>
Cell Lines<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
A colorimetric type of assay, using sulforhodamine B (SRB) reaction has been adapted for a quantitative measurement of cell growth and viability [following the technique described by Philip Skehan, et al. (1990), New colorimetric cytotoxicity assay for anticancer drug screening, J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 82:1107-1112].<br>
This form of the assay employs 96 well cell culture microplates of 9 mm diameter (Faircloth, 1988; Mosmann, 1983).     Most of the cell lines<br>
are obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)    derived from different human cancer types.<br>
Cells are maintained in RPMI 1640 10% FBS, supplemented with 0.1 g/1 penicillin and 0.1 g/1 streptomycin sulfate and then incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 and 98% humidity. For the experiments, cells were harvested from subconfluent cultures using trypsin and resuspended in fresh medium before plating.<br>
Cells are seeded in 96 well microliter plates, at 5 x 103 cells per well in aliquots of 195 µL medium, and they are allowed to attach to die plate surface by growing in drug free medium for 18 hours. Afterward, samples are added in aliquots of 5 µL in a ranging from 10 to 10-8 µg/mL, dissolved in DMSO:EtOH:PBS (0.5:0.5:99). After 48 hours exposure, the antitumor effect are measured by the SRB methodology: cells are fixed by adding 50 µL, of cold 50% (wt/vol) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and incubating for 60 minutes at 4°C. Plates are washed with deionized water and dried. One hundred µL of SRB solution (0.4% wt/vol in 1% acetic acid) is added to each microtiter well and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. Unbound SRB is removed by washing with 1% acetic acid. Plates are air dried and bound stain is solubilized with Tris buffer. Optical densities are read on a automated spectrophotometric plate reader at a single wavelength of 490 nm.<br>
The values for mean +/- SD of data from triplicate wells are calculated. Some parameters for cellular responses can be calculated: GI = growth inhibition, TGI = total growth inhibition (cytostatic effect) and LC = cell killing (cytotoxic effect).<br>
