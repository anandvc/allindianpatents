				<td>The invention relates to a heat exchanger for a <br>
dens fluxelesed bed designed<br><br>
in particular to be installed in an external dense fluidized bed equipping a circulating fluidized bed hearth.<br>
Such a heat exchanger conventionally comprises ar. inlet fluid manifold and an outlet fluid manifold, the manifolds being interconnected by at least one group of tubes extending in zigzag manner in a vertical plane between the inlet manifold and the outlet manifold.  The zigzags define; hairpins having adjacent branches which slope relative to one another (at an angle approximately in the range8° to 15°) while leaving empty space: between them.  The elope in neccuaary to enable bubbles of fluid vapor to flow naturally in the tubes.<br>
Eigh-pow&amp;r installations require relatively large heat exchange areas.  Obtaining such areas involves providing a greater number of heat exchangers or providing a heat exchanger that ia large in size and whose design is dictated by the cross flow of the solids.<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a heat exchanger that, is compact:, i.e. a heat exchanger having dimensions analogous to those of a heat exchanger of the zigzag-tube type, but that offers a larger heat exchange area.<br>
To this end, the invention provides a heat exchanger for a dense fluidized bed, said heat exchanger being characterized in that it comprises at least one first crroup of tubes extending in a vertical plana and forming a first sheet of tubes for connecting a first inlet fluid manifold disposed at the bottom and on one side of a case to an outlet manifold disposed in a central top portion of the case, and at least, one second group of tubes extending in said vertical plane and forming a second sheet of tubes for1 connecting a second inlet fluid manifold disposed at the bottom and on one side of the case to the outlet manifold, in that each of the first<br><br>
and second sheets of tubes comprises first tubes which extend substantially horizontally and parallel to one another in the bottom portion of the case, second tubes which are connected via multiple bifurcations to the first tubes and which extend substantially vertically and parallel to one another between the bottom portion of the case and the middle portion of the case, and bent third tubes which are connected via multiple bifurcations to the second tubes and which extend parallel to one another between the middle portion of the case and the top portion of the case where they are connected to the outlet manifold; the third tubes of the first sheet of: tubes and the third tubes of the second sheet of tubes! being disposed to form a channel along which the solids can flow, which channel has an O-shaped cross-section, and in that said first and second sheets of tubes are stiffened at their bottoms by continuous fins disposed between the adjacent tubes.<br>
_'"n a particular embodiment of the invention, the first and second sheets of tubes have different numbers of tubes so that the two sheets of tubes are juxtaposed in said vertical plane along a vertical line that is offset relative to a vertical midline of the case.<br>
I[n another particular embodiment of the invention, the h«at exchanger comprises a first set of first and second sheets of tubes disposed in alternation in parallel vertical planes and connecting the first inlest manifold to the outlet manifold, and a second set: of first and second sheets of tube;3 disposed in alternation in parallel vertical planes and connecting the s«cond inlet manifold to the outlet manifold, the sheets? of tubes in the first set of sheets of tubes further being disposed in staggered manner with the sheets of tubes in the second set of sheets of tubes so that a sheet of tubes having ;a small number of tub ess in the first set of sheets of tubes is "juxtaposed in the same vertical plane with a sheet of tubes having a larger number of tubes in<br><br>
&gt;the second set of sheets of tubes, and a fastening system is further provided for securing together the bottom portions of the sheets of tubes having the larger number of tubes in the two sets of sheets of tubes.<br>
The present invention relates to:<br>
A heat exchanger for a dense fluidized bed, said heat exchanger being characterized in that it comprises at least one first group of tubes extending in an vertical plane and forming a first sheet of tubes (3A) for connecting a first inlet fluid manifold (4A) disposed at the bottom and on one side of a case (1) to an outlet manifold (5) disposed in a central top portion of the case, and at least one second group of tubes extending in said vertical plane and forming a second sheet of tubes (3B) for connecting a second inlet fluid manifold (4B) disposed at the bottom and on one side of the case to the outlet manifold (5), in that each of the first and second sheets of tubes (3A, 3B) comprises first tubes (31) which extend substantially horizontally and parallel to one another in the bottom portion of the case, second tubes (32) which are connected via multiple bifurcations (33) to the first tubes (31) and which extend substantially vertically and parallel to one another between the bottom portion of the case and the middle portion of the case, and bent third tubes (34) which are connected via multiple bifurcations (35) to the second tubes (32) and which extend parallel to one another between the middle portion of the case and the top portion of the case where they are connected to the outlet manifold (5), the third tubes (34) of the first sheet of tubes (3A) and the third tubes of the second sheet of tubes (3B) being disposed to form a channel along which the solids can flow, which channel has an O-shaped cross-section, and in that the first and second sheets of tubes (3A, 3B) are stiffened at their bottoms by continuous fins (36) disposed between the adjacent tubes.<br>
An embodiment of the invention is described in more detail with reference to the drawing, in which:<br>
Figure i is a diagrammatic view showing a heat exchanger of the invention as mounted in a fluidized bed; and<br>
Figure 2 is a very diagrammatic view in section on II-II of the heat exchanger shown in Figure 1, as equipped with a plurality of sheets of tubes.<br>
Figure 1 is a very diagrammatic cross-section view showing a portion of a dense fluidized bed and more precisely showing a case 1 made of sheet metal reinforced with stiffeners and with an internal layer of concrete, the case defining a chamber 2 into which the solids pour and flow aizter they have passed over a sill downstream from a chamber for receiving said solids.<br>
The chamber 2 is normally equipped with a bottom box (not shown) for feeding in fluidization air, with fluidization air injection nozzles (not shown) which are disposed in the bottom wall 2A of the chamber 2. A hsat exchanger 3 c-£ the invention is shown installed inside the chamber 2.<br>
The heat exchanger 3 comprises a set of txibes serving to convey a coolant, fe.g. steam, between two inlet manifolds 4A, 4B for the fluid F disposed at the bottom and or. either side of the case and an outlet manifold 5 for the heated fluid, which outlet manifold is disposed at the top and in the center of the case,  It is in the chamber 2 that the dense fluidization of the solids Lakes place, enabling the fluid to be heated in the tubes of the heat exchanger.<br>
Each of the inlet manifolds 4A and 4B is constituted by a tube extending horizontally along the side of the<br>
case 1 on the outside thereof, manifold 4A being on the left, and manifold 4B being on the right in Figure 1.<br>
The outlet manifold 5 is constituted by a tube extending horizontally in the top central portion of the chamber 2, and more precisely under the top wall 2B of the chamber 2.  The outlet manifold 5 is connected to a pipe 6 that passes through the top wall 2B via a slot 7. The pipe 6 is coated with concrete 3 that packs the slot 7 so that the outlet manifold 5 is suspended from the top wall 2B of the chamber 2.<br>
The heat exchanger proper 3 comprises a first group of tubes extending in a vertical plane and forming a first sheet 3A of tubes which connect the first inlet manifold 4A to the outlet manifold 5, and a second group of tubes extending in the same vertical plane and forming a second sheet 3B of tubes that connect the second inlet manifold 4B to the outlet manifold 5,<br>
As shown in Figure 1, each sheet of tubes 3A or 3B includes first tubes such as 31 which extend substantially horizontally and parallel to one another in the bottom portion of the case.  The tubes 31 passs through a side wall of the case via a slot packed with concrete, the tubes 31 of the sheet 3A passing through the left wall in Figure 1 and the tubes 31 of the sheet 3B parsing through the right wall in Figure 1.<br>
each sheet of tubes 3A, 3B,further   includes second tubes such as 32 which are'connected via multiple bifurcations such as 33 to the first; tubes of the sheet in question, and which extend substantially vertically and parallel to one another between the bottom portion of the case and the middle portion o£ the case.<br>
Each sheet of tubes 3A, 3B further includes third tubes such as 34 bent into C-shapes which are cormecteid via nvultiple bifurcations; such &amp;e 35 to the second tubes of the sheet in question, and which extend parallel to one another between the middle portion of the case and the top portion of the case where they are connected to<br>
the outlet manifold 5.  The bend configuration of the tubes 34 defines the profile of the dense fluidized bed, and more particularly thes tubes 34 of the first sheet 3A and of the second sheet 3B form a channel along which the solids flow that has an 0-shaped cross-section, which makes it easier for the cross flow of solids to pass through becaus;e the solids encoianter almost no obstacles.<br>
Figure 1 shows that the tubes 31 and 32 are relatively close together, and they form a heat exchange area in the bottom of the: caae that is relatively continuous in the vertical plane while allowing the solids a certain amount of mobility between the adjacent tubes.  This configuration thus makes it possible to obtain a heat exchange area that is quite large while the heat exchanger is relatively compact.  Although the heat exchanger includes horizontal tubes such as the tubas 31, the coolant flows properly through the heat exchanger by means of the vertical tubes 32 which contribute to ensuring that the natural-flow feed operates properly.<br>
Each sheet of tubes is stiffened in its boztom porticn at the; level of the tubes 31 and at the bottoms of the tubes 32 by means of continuous fins 36 disposed between adjacent tubes, these fins 36 being shown by hatching in Figure 1.<br>
In the bottom of the heat exchanger 3, the tubes 31 of the sheet 3 A are connected to the inlet manifcld 4A via a manifold pipe 9A which extends vertically and the tubes 31 of the sheet 3B are connected to the inlet manifold 4B via another manifold pipe 9B which extends vertically.<br>
In addition, in the top of the heat exchanger 3, the tubes 34 of the sheet 3A are connected to the outlet manifold 5 vie. a manifold pipe 10A which extends horizontally, and the tubes 34 of the sheet 3B are also connected to the outlet manifold 5 via another manifold pipe lOB which extends horizontally.<br>
The tubes being disposed in. the heat exchanger as: indicated above makes it possible to design a heat exchanger configuration with a plurEility of first and second sheets of tubes so as to increase the heat exchange area without considerably decreasing the compactness of the heat exchanger.<br>
In Figure 1, the sheets 3A and 3B comprise different numbers of tubes 31 (or 32, 34) .  In the example show sheet 3A has 7 tubes 31 and sheet 3B has 5 tubes 31.  In this embodiment, the two sheets 3A and 3B are juxtaposed in the vertical plane along a vertical line at C that is offset, relative to a vertical midlirie 11 of the case. Such a configuration makes it easier to mount a plurality of sheets 3A and 3B in the case.<br>
Figure 2 is a very diagrammatic view in section on II-II of the case shown in Figure 1, showing one configuration of a heat exchanger of the invention comprising a plurality of sheets 3A and 3B.  it can be seen that a plurality of sheets 3A and 3B are interposed in the longitudinal direction of the case.<br>
More particularly, this configuration includes a first set of £?heets of tubes 3A and 3B disposed on the left in Figure 2 in alternation (i.e. one sheet 3A and one sheet 3B alternately) in parallel vertical planes. The first set of sheets of tubes 3A, 3B connects the inlet manifold 4A to the outlet manifold 5.  The configuration includes a second set of sheets of tubes 3A and 3B dispose-sd on the right in Figvire 2 in alternation in parallel vertical planes.  The second set of sheets of tubes 3A, 3B connects the second inlet manifold 4B to the outlet manifold 5,<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the sheets 3A, 3B of the first set of sheets are disposed in staggered manner with the sheets 3A, 3B of the second set of sheets, so "hat a sheet of tubes) that has a small number of tubes in the first set, i.e. a sheet 3B, is juxtaposed in the same vertical plane with a sheet of tubes that has a larger<br>
number of tubes in the second set, i.e. a sheet 3A.  The sheet 3A and 3B o£ the of the two sets of sheetB o£ tubes are thus interleaved in one .another.<br>
This staggered configuration of. the sheets 3A and 3B makes it easier to mount them in the caae.  In addition, a fastening system is provided to secure together the bottom portions of the sheets of tubes having the larger number of tubes in the two sets of sheets of tubes, i.e. the sheets 3A, so as to make tha structure of the heat exchanger rigid in the vertical direction while allowing the sheets the possibility of moving relative to one another in the horizontal direction.  This fastening system is represented by way of example in Figure 2 by two rods 12 which pass through fins 36 disposed in the bottom portions of the sheets.  The two rods 12 are also shown in Figure 1.<br>
By way of non-limiting example, Figure 2 shows a heat exchanger structure of the invention, in which 3 sheets 3A or 3B of a set of sheets as defined above a:re connected to a pipe 9 welded to an inlet manifold, respectively 4A or 4B, the pipe 9 securing the sheets 3A or 3B together at their bottoms.<br>
Figure 2 also shows a heat exchanger configuration of the invention including a plurality of pipes .such as 9 and thus a plurality of triplets of sheets 3A or 3E of a set, disposed in adjacent vertical planes.  It can be understood that it is easy to increase the heat exchange area by increasing the number cf pipes 9, and thus the number of sheets of tubes.<br>
To stiffen the sheets connected to the same tube such as 9 at their tops, an additional clamp such as 13 (shown in Figure l) is provided at the level of the tubes 34.<br>
Since the pipes such as 10A and 10B are also welded to the outlet 5, the heat exchanger of the invention is self-supporting.<br><br><br><br>
