				<td>Device or Connector Adapter<br>
The invention relates to a device or connector adapter, having a base element, in which contacting units with contacts for making electrical contact with bus bars of a bus bar system are received, and having a holding device for the releasable fixation in place of the device adapter in respect of the bus bar system, as well as the use of such an adapter.<br>
Device or connector adapters of this type have been known in various designs in connection with bus bar systems with mounting units; such as shown in DE 103 00 723 Al, DE 93 06 013 Ul and DE 100 61 939 Al.  There, the connector and/or snap-in elements are formed in one piece on the bus bar holders, on the platform of the mounting unit and on the device or connector adapters and are only used for mechanically connecting mounting units and device or connector adapters matched to each other. Tliis considerably narrows the range of employment of the adapters.  For example, an installed system with a mounting unit laid out in a defined manner cannot be connected to different device or connector adapters.<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to make available a device or connector adapter whose application and variation range is increased, and to disclose an advantageous employment poss ibi1ity.<br>
This object is attained by means of the characteristics of claims 1 or 13.  It is provided here that the holding device has various module-like connecting means and clamping feet which can attached, at least in part releasably, on the base element, in order to mechanically fix the device adapter in place selectively<br>
oil a support device of the bus bar system, or directly on at<br>
one bus bar.<br>
It is possible by these means, along with a simple mounting and simple operation, to mechanically connect the adapter having the same base element and simple-to-connect different connecting elements selectively directly with the bus bars, or with a platform receiving the bus bars, wherein a dependable electrical contact is assured.<br>
An advantage of the invention also arises from the use of such a device or: connector adapter in connection with a bus bar system with a mounting unit, which contains several spaced-apart bus bar's in ."insulated bus bar holders, or an insulating platform.<br>
An advantageous embodiment of the adapter here consists in that a portion of the connecting means is attached on a narrow side of the elongated and approximately cube-shaped base element, and a further portion of the connecting means is attached on the oppositely located side of the base element, and that the connecting means on at least one narrow side have snap-in elements.  The connecting means matched to each other on the two narrow sides of the adapter result in simple manipulation during attachment and a dependable connection.<br>
a connection, for example on the edges of a trough-shaped receptacle of the platform, advantageous embodiments consist in that the oppositely located connecting means on both narrow sides of the device adapter have connecting sections which ase facing each other or away from each other.<br>
Furthermore, in case of different utilization, steps are advantageous for the mounting and operation, wherein the connection mean.-; on at least one narrow side of the device adapter .is/are art ached to a attachment piece which is or can be<br>
y connected with the base element.<br>
In this case various embodiment variations consist in that the connected state the at least one attachment piece is snapped  plugged together and/or screwed together with lie base .<br>
For: mounting and manipulating, those steps are furthermore advantageous wherein, on a narrow side of the device adapter, the connecting means is connected in one piece with the base element via a narrow side section formed thereon.<br>
An advantageous construction for the simple fixation rn place on at leas': one bus bar consists in that the at least one clamping .Leg in a hook shape is or can be releasably attached for extending behind the associated bus bar, or a section of the same, at the appropriate underside of the base element.<br>
In this case the connection of the clamping leg can take [dace in a simple way in that the at least one clamping leg is snapped, screwed and/or plugged into a wall attachment formed on the underside of the base element.<br>
A further advantage is here achieved in that the wall attachment Laterally borders a bus bar receptacle on the underside of the base element.<br>
Those measures contribute to a dependable fixation in {dace of the adapter on bus bars wherein, for the lateral delimitation  of a side of a bus bar to be assigned which is located opposite a side facing the wall attachment, a locking element, which is seated in the base element and can be displaced or pivoted perpendicularly in respect to the underside of the base element, projects into at least one bus bar receptacle.<br>
Mounting and operation are here furthermore favored in that the locking element can be removed.<br>
The mechanical fixation in place, as well as the provision of electrical, contacts at the bus bars, are aided in that the contacts are resi1iently supported in the base element for making<br>
(.in electrical contact. with the bus bars.<br>
For the rapid and simple establishment of the mechanical connection when using the adapter it has been provided that the connecting elements of the device or connector adapters, which are embodied as snap-in elements, are cushioned in the device or connector adapter and can be adjusted in a limited way parallel with the fastening surface of the mounting unit and perpendicularly :; n relation to the bus bars, and that the snap-in elements of the device or connector adapter, which are provided w i. Lh a snap-in ramp and a snap-in tip, snap into a snap-in receptacle of the platform of the mounting unit or snap-in receptacle of the bus bar holder when the device or connector adapter is placed on the mounting unit.<br>
The invent ion will be explained in greater detail by means of exemplary embodiments represented in the drawings.  Shown are i 11:<br>
Fig. 1, a Lateral view of a bus bar system consisting of a mounting unit with a platform and a connection adapter placed on top of the platform and maintained thereon,<br>

Fig. 5, the assembled state of the two differently assembled adapters in accordance with Figs. 4A to 4C.<br>
As the exemplary embodiment of Fig. 1 shows, three spaced-<br>
apart bus bars /O have been fixed in place in an insulated manner.  In this case the platform 1.1 can have a sort of a trough '•) and can extend over the entire Length of the bus bars 20.  The platform 11 can also be equipped with several insulating bus bar holders 8 arranged on the trough 9, or be replaced by several insulting bus bars, which are spaced apart from each other in the longitudinal direction of the bus bars 20.  Connecting elements 1.4 and Id are attached to the sides of the trough, or platform 11, which extend parallel with the bus bars 20 wherein, facing the device adapter 30, the connecting elements 14 and 16 terminate in plug elements in the form of holding sections 15 and 17, which for example are oriented toward the outside parallel with the fastening surface of the trough 9.  In this case the fixation on a support is provided, for example, via fastening flanges 18 of the connection elements 16.  In a similar way the holding sections 15 and 17 can also be formed by outwardly angled end sections of the narrow trough edges.  In accordance with Fig. 1, the fastening of the device adapter 30 is provided at the holding sections 15, 17 on the one side by means of a hook-like connecting element 40, and on the other side by means of a releasable connecting means 50 which, for example, can be snapped in and has a snap- in projection 51 on an attachment piece 35 on the appropriate narrow side of the device adapter 30, as Figs. 1 and 3 show.<br>
In the present case, a foot 21 of the bus bars 20 has been inserted into receptacles 12 of the bus bar holders 8 or of the platform 11, wherein filler pieces 13 fill up the receptacles, and cover plates 19  the feet 21 and the filler pieces 13 in pI ace.  The bus bars 20 project outward by means of sections 22 and 23 in an L-shape at the top of the mounting unit 10.  On the side facing the mounting unit 10, the device or connector adapter 50 has three bus bar receptacles 31, into which the electrical contact elements 32 project.  The wall attachments 33 divide the<br>
bus bar receptac les 31 and can have removable clamping feet 36 (Pig. •-) , which extend behind the end sections 23 of the bus bars '•'0.  The damping 36 can be snapped into place in the device or connect-or adapter 30.  In this case a spring-loaded locking element '.VI can project, into at least one bus bar receptacle 31, besides the contact element 32, as represented in Figs. 2, 2A and 3.  The J ticking element 37 is placed behind the transition from the end sect ion 23 to the section 22 of the bus bar 20 and assures t hat the device or connector adapter 30 is maintained on the mounting unit 10 even if no locking means 51, such as for example the connecting means 50, are provided for securing on the platform 11 or the bus bar holders 8.  If a locking means for securing on the platform 11 is provided, the additional locking element  J7 can be omitted, as shown in Fig. 1.  The employment of flat bus bar:; can also be considered.<br>
As the left side of Figs. 1 and 2 and the enlarged partial view in accordance with Fig. 2A show, following the plug-in movement the pluq elements 15 and 17 of the connecting elements 1'1 and 16 are t reduced into the connecting element 40 at the device or connector adapter 30 and a mechanical connection between the mounting element 10 and the device or connector adapter 30 is achieved.  In this case the connecting element 40 can be attached fixedly, or releasably and exchangeably, to the narrow side end '.'A of the device or connector adapter 30.  This mechanical connection assures that the device or connector-adapter 30 is securely fixed in place in respect to the fastening surf act' of the mounting unit 10.<br>
As can be seen from Figs. 1 and 3, the narrow side end of the device or connector adapter 30 located opposite the narrow side, or the side section 34 with the connecting element 4u, supports the attachment piece 35.  As a connecting means, the latter has a snap-in element 50 with a snap-in ramp for deflect ion during placement, and a snap-in projection 51 for<br><br>
holding in the inserted state.  The snap-in element 50 is seated in the attachment piece 35 and can be displaced in a 1 minted way substantially parallel in respect to the fastening surface of the mounting unit 10 and perpendicularly in respect to the long sides of the bus bars 20.  It the connecting element 40 has been placed or hooked on the flange-like holding sections 15 and 17 of the mounting unit 10 by means of e\ sideward movement, it is then possible by means of a pivot movement to deflect the snap-in element 50 on the opposite side ever the snap-in element, 50 in such a way that the snap-in tip, or snap-in projection 51, is moved sideways and thereafter the associated holding section 17 is grasped from behind.  In that case the mechanical connection between the device or connector adapter 30 and the mounting unit 10 is assured in a simple manner.  It can only be released by setting the snap-in element 50 back.<br>
It still remains to mention that there exists a multitude or embodiment variations regarding the details of the connecting and/or snap-in elements, as well as regarding the releasable and Interchangeable connection with the bus bar holders, the mounting unit and the device of connector adapters.<br>
It in accordance with Figs. 2 and 2A at least one clamping foot 3b has been installed, and also at least one adjustable lacking element 37 is provided, it can be securely fixed in place on bus bars 20 without the connecting and/or snap-in elements 40, 5u being installed on it.  This results in variable employment possibilities .<br>
Figs. 4A, 4B and 4C show two device adapters 30 embodied In different ways, having connecting means 40, 50 and clamping fo-'et 3b, in various exploded views, always with the same base element 31, in a perspective representation.  Fig. 5 shows the two embodiments of the device adapter 30 in the assembled state, The embodiment, variations of the device adapter 30, which .//in only be fixed in place on the platform 11, i.e. the holding sections I'-., 17 which are outwardly angled on both sides, are here represented in the partial representations a), while the embodiment variations of the device adapter 30 which can be fixed in place on the bus bars 20 are .shown in the partial representations b).  As Figs. 4A and 4B show in particular, the connecting means equipped with the snap-in elements 50 are formed on the attachment piece 35 at its lower section facing the platform, wherein the snap-in element 50 with the snap-in projection 51 is inserted as a separate element into the slit-shaped cutout of the attachment piece 35 and is resiliently seated therein in order to be able to be laterally displaced parallel with the level of the platform 11 for producing and releasing the snap-in connection.  In its upper section facing the respective narrow side of the base element 39, the attachment piece 35 is provided with lateral plug-in pegs 38, which can be plugged into matched openings in the area of the longitudinal side elements of the base element 39 and fixed in place therein, for example snapped in.  The narrow side section 34 on the opposite side of the base element 39 has been formed as one piece with it and has on its underside the connecting element 40, also formed on it, with the hook-like plug-in receptacle 41 for the holding section 15, 16 matched to it.  For connecting the device adapter 30 equipped in this way on the platform 11, first the connecting element 40 is suspended on the respective holding section 15, 17 by a displacement movement in the direction of the level of the platform, and then the snap-in connection is provided on the opposite narrow side of the device adapter 30 at the appropriate holding section 15, 17 by means of a pivot movement, wherein the snap-in element 50 is pushed back against the spring force by means of the snap-in ramp on the snap-in projection  , and then snaps into the snapped-in position under<br>
 extending receptacles for contact springs  have also been formed in the base element 39, which are connected with suitable conductors in connecting pieces 71 and together constitute a contacting unit 70.  In this case the connecting pieces 7] are received in matched recesses of the narrow side .section 34, as can be seen in Fig. 4A in connection with Fig. 48, as well as also Fig. 4C.  A set-up plate 60 is attached to the top of the base element 39, for which purpose snap-in springs n2 and snap-in hooks have been formed on the underside- of the set-up plate 60, which engage matching openings in the top of the base (element 39.  Further snap-in hooks 63 are designed in such a way that they work together with the attachment piece 35.  Helical springs on the underside of the set-up plate 60 are supported on the contact elements 32 of the contact springs 12., so that a dependable contact is provided on the bus bars 20 and in the course of this the mechanical connection possibly made there is also aided.  Further connecting means tot receiving devices can be attached to the top of the sot_-up plate 60 01 to strips laterally bordering it.<br>
In connect ion with the variation of the device adapter 30 designed for attachment to the bus bars 20 in accordance with the partial representations b), the attachment piece 35 is not provided, which can also be seen in Fig. 2.  Instead, a cover plate n2 has been formed, or removable attached, on the set-up plate 60 which, in place of the attachment pieces 35, constitutes a simple closure on the narrow side of the device adapter 30. This design variation is provided with the clamping feet 36 for taxation on the bus bars 20, which are releasably attached to the wall attachments 33 on the underside of the base element 39, for example snapped in, plugged in or screwed on.  The clamping feet  can be provider! with inserted reinforcement elements.<br>
Fixation in place on the bus bars 20 is here also reinforced by the effect o£ helical springs on the contact elements 32 at the contact .springs /.'-'.  The wall attachments 33 constitute lateral borders for received bus bars 20.  At least one bus bar 20 is .secured on its longitudinal side located opposite the wall attachment. 33 by means of a locking element 37, which is seated, perpendicularly displaceable or pivotable in regard to the underside of the base element 39, and is pressed outward by means of a spring force.  The locking element 37 has various settings for different widths of bus bars and can be displaced inward against the spring force by means of a handle 37.1 in the top of the narrow side section 34 by a pivot movement or a displacement movement parallel with the longitudinal orientation of the base element 30 via a snap-in ramp in order to unlock the adapter 30. The locking element 37 and, if required also the handle 37.1, can be taken out of the base element, or introduced into it as separate parts.<br><br><br><br><br>
