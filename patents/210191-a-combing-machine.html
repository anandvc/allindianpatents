The invention relates to a combing machine with a driven nipper unit and a circular comb driven discontinuously and synchronised with the movement of the nipper unit.<br>
Devices are known from patent literature in which the circular comb of a combing machine performs a discontinuous movement during a combing cycle in order to perform an adaptation to the form of movement of certain working elements and to certain technological conditions. Such a device is known from EP-754 253, with the circular comb being driven by way of an electric separate drive. A similar device is also known from EP-754 252, with the electromotive drive being integrated directly in the circular comb.<br>
It is possible with these devices to perform different circumferential speeds of the circular comb during a combing cycle on the basis of predetermined control programs. These specially employed electromotive separate drives are relatively expensive and require a precise electronic control which prevents any drifting off of the angular position of the comb segment with respect to the other units taking part in the combing process.<br>
In EP-754 252 it was described that the pulsating rotational movements were produced by mechanical gears with toothed wheels with an eccentric/elliptical arrangement. Such a transmission with eccentrically held toothed wheels is known from JP-PS-58-57529 from figs. 4 and 5. Although such arrangements of gear units with eccentrically held toothed wheels or elliptically arranged toothed wheels allow achieving a pulsating rotational movement, the adaptation to technological conditions and other drive conditions is limited.<br>
This means that the degrees of freedom for influencing the rotational movement of the circular comb are limited with these mechanical devices.<br><br>
The invention therefore has the object of providing a mechanical drive for a circular comb of a combing machine in such a way that a discontinuous rotational movement of the circular comb can be produced by way of said drive, whereby the rotational speed of the circular comb can be arranged in a variable manner over the major part of its complete rotation.<br>
This object is achieved in such a way that the drive of the circular comb occurs by an electromotor revolving substantially constant by way of a mechanical gear with at least one gear step with non-round drive means. Non-round shall mean in this respect that the outer contour of the drive means departs from symmetrical geometrical conditions (in contrast to elliptical toothed wheels whose contour shows symmetrical conditions).<br>
It is further proposed that the non-round drive means are in mutual drive connection by means of transmission means. These drive means can be formed of belts which are provided with a profile for example which engages in the outer contour of the non-round drive means which is also provided with a profile.<br>
As a further embodiment it is proposed that the non-round drive means are provided with a toothed profile and that the transmission means is formed by a revolving chain element which engages in the toothed profiles.<br>
It is proposed further that the non-round drive means are arranged as toothed wheels which are in direct mutual engagement. It is possible with this device to perform a change or adaptation of rotational speed of the circular comb in any position of rotational angle of the drive means, adapted to its toothed wheel work during a revolution. However, the rotational speed adaptation is slightly limited by the required wrap of the transmission means when using non-round drive means which are mutually connected by way of a transmission means.<br>
From JP-OS 62-149922 a device is known where non-round toothed wheels are used for the drive of the nipper unit. The speed of the pendulum motion  is modified  in this process. This,  however,  is not<br><br>
comparable with a special modification of a rotational movement in a round comb.<br>
In order to keep the ratio of transmission relatively small it is proposed that preferably two gear steps with non-round drive means are connected in series, with the drive means of the second gear step being torsionally rigidly fastened to the output shaft of the first gear step. This device ensures, on the one hand, a compact gear step which with respect to the dimensions is kept relatively small and, on the other hand, a low-noise transmission step.<br>
It is proposed further that the output shaft of the first gear step is held between the output drive means of the first step and the input drive means of the second step.<br>
Further advantages are shown and described on the basis of the following embodiments, wherein:<br>

Fig. 9 shows a schematic side view according to fig. 8 in a further working position.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows the structure of a drive layout for a combing machine. The drive occurs substantially through a main motor M1 which transmits the drive output via a pulley G onto the pulley H by means of a belt 1. The drive output is transmitted to a toothed wheel 4 by way of a shaft 2 on which the pulley H is attached in a torsionally rigid manner, with the toothed wheel also being attached in a torsionally rigid manner on shaft 2 and being in a drive connection with the plate cam 43. Plate cam 43, which is provided on its outer circumference with a toothed ring, is fastened in a torsionally rigid manner on a shaft 50. A rocker 48 is also fastened in a torsionally rigid manner on said shaft, which rocker drives by way of a driving gear 10 a shaft 11 of a schematically shown planetary gear 12. The web gear 95 of the planetary gear 12 is driven via a toothed wheel 15 and an intermediate wheel 56. The toothed wheel 15 is attached in a torsionally rigid manner on shaft 50. The planet wheels 30, 29 which are held in the web gear 95 roll off on the sun wheels 30 and 25. This modified drive movement (constant drive by way of the web gear 95, discontinuous drive by way of a driving gear 10) is transmitted onto the detaching cylinders 31 and 32, which are torsionally rigidly connected with the toothed wheels 28, by way of toothed wheel 87 which is in drive connection with a toothed wheel 28. The detaching cylinders 31, 32 perform a pilgrim-step motion during a combing cycle.<br>
A take-off roller 38 and the pair of take-off rollers 40 are driven by way of further schematically shown transmission steps 52. Based on this transmission step 52, the drive of the lap rollers 19 and 20 which are responsible for winding off the wound lap during the combing process occurs by way of a chain drive 54 through chain wheels 21, 22.<br><br>
The other units (e.g. drafting arrangement, can coiler, etc.) are driven by way of a further schematically shown power take-off 59.<br>
A more detailed description of the planetary gear for driving detaching rollers is also known from CH-PS 499 635.<br>
A slider-crank drive 17 is also shown schematically. It is used to perform the reciprocating movement of the nipper unit. As an extension to the drive shaft 50, a transmission step 60 is interposed between the circular comb 44 which is shown and explained in closer detail in an enlarged representation in fig. 2. The shaft starting from transmission step 60 and leading to circular comb 44 is marked with reference numeral 51.<br>
In order to clean the comb segment 46 of the circular comb 44 a brush roller 45 is arranged. It is driven by a separate electromotor M2 by way of a belt drive with the pulleys P, Q. A feed roller 8 is indicated between the circular comb 44 and the rear detaching cylinder 31, which feed roller, as is known, is driven intermittently by the movement of the nipper unit.<br>
As is shown in fig. 2 in conjunction with fig. 3, the intermediate gear 60 consists of individual gear transmissions (two in this case) with non-round pairs of toothed wheels. As is shown in fig. 3, the respective transmission is obtained from the respective angular position of the toothed wheels 62, 63 with the respective geometrical radii R1, R2. The axial distance A of the toothed wheels 62 and 63 remains constant. The non-round toothed wheel 62 is attached in a torsionally rigid manner on shaft 50, with the shaft 50 being held at its free end in the machine frame 68 by way of an arrangement of bearings 70. The toothed wheel 63 is attached in a torsionally rigid manner on a shaft 64 which is also held in the machine frame 68 by way of a bearing 71 and 72. A further toothed wheel 65 is also torsionally rigidly attached on shaft 64 between the two bearings 71 and 72, which further toothed wheel is in drive connection with a toothed wheel 66. The toothed wheel 66 is torsionally rigidly attached to a shaft 51 which is held in machine frame 68 by way of a bearing 73. Shaft 51 is simultaneously the drive axle for the circular comb 44 which is shown schematically in fig. 2. The arrangement of the non-round pairs of toothed<br><br>
wheels 62, 63 and 65, 66 can be similar. The consequence of this is that there are the same transmission ratios in each transmission step. It would also be possible to attach only one transmission step with a pair of toothed wheels. The application of two transmission steps, however, leads to a more compact arrangement of the gear unit, which on the one hand can be kept silent and on the other hand can be kept relatively small in its dimensions. With this transmission step 60 it is possible to produce a discontinuous rotational movement of the circular comb during a combing cycle which is shown in the diagram of fig. 6 for example. A rotation of the circular comb 40 is broken down into 40 indexes, with the nipper unit having the smallest distance from the downstream detaching cylinders at approx. index 24. In this forward position the nipper is completely opened and transfers the tuft F, which projects from the nipper and was previously combed out, to the lap fleece end V, which was partly conveyed back by the detaching cylinders, for the detaching and subsequent piecing process.<br>
Such a diagram where the motion sequences as described above are shown is also known from the following passage in literature: Manual of textile production - Short staple spinning / Vol. 3: Combing, drawing, flyer by W. Klein on page 31.<br>
Figs. 8 and 9 each schematically show a nipper unit 5 which is provided with a nipper knife 6 and a bottom cushion plate 7. A circular comb 44 is arranged below the nipper unit 5, which comb is provided with a comb segment 46. In the additional fig. 7 a time diagram is shown schematically which shows by way of a combing cycle (40 indexes) at which time the nipper is closed and opened, the circular comb segment 46 plunges into the supplied fibre tuft F, and at which time the detaching cylinders convey back the fibre fleece end V in the direction of the nipper unit 5 (fig. 9) or in the discharge direction according to fig. 8. As is shown in fig. 7, the circular combing is performed at the time while the nipper is closed (in the present case between index 35 and index 6). The return conveyance of the fibre fleece end V in the direction of the nipper unit 5 occurs between index 6 and index 15 in order to piece a new fibre package. To prevent the comb segment 46 from plunging into the fibre fleece end V which was conveyed back, it is necessary to modify the rotational speed of the<br><br>
circular comb in such a way that there will not be any collision between the returned fibre fleece V and the circular comb segment 46. As a result of the renewed combing (also called "re-combing") of the fibre material of the fibre fleece end V, it could happen that batch fibres (long fibres) which are not held by the nip point of the detaching cylinders are pulled out by the circular comb segment from the fibre fleece end V and are separated. That is why it is necessary that after the combing process (fig. 8) the circular comb segment 46 is removed as quickly as possible from the zone below the detaching rollers 31.<br>
This is shown in fig. 9 for example. The nipper 5 still moves in the direction of the detaching cylinders 31 while the circular comb segment 46 is already located below the fibre fleece end V. This is also shown in the diagram according to fig. 6. Following the circular combing (index 6) the rotational speed curve rises steeply in order to take the circumstances as explained above into account. As is also shown in fig. 6, the rotational speed of the circular comb segment is at a low level of rotational speed during the circular combing (between index 34 and index 6), so that the dwell time of the fibre tuft F in the circular comb segment 46 is relatively long during the combing process in order to achieve a favourable combing.<br>
The rotational speed of the circular comb segment must also be precisely tuned to the movement of the nipper unit 5, so that there will not be any collision of the bottom nipper plate 7 with the combing segment 46.<br>
As result of using the transmission step 60 with the non-round toothed wheels it is possible to modify the speed of the combing process independent of the number of nips of the comb and to tune it precisely to the movements of the nipper or the detaching cylinders. This grants degrees of freedom in many directions in order to ensure optimal combing work with subsequent optimised piecing and detaching process.<br>
The example as described above constitutes only one possible embodiment. Depending on the requirements (technological or machine-related) it is possible to realise other rotational speed curves of the circular<br><br>
comb by choosing requisite non-round drive means of transmission step 60.<br>
Such adaptations for the achievement of optimal technological conditions were not possible with the previous devices, or only partly possible with considerable financial expenditure.<br>
Figs. 4 and 5 show further possibilities of how such a drive step can also be arranged with non-round drive means. Fig. 4 shows a device where the transmission of drive output occurs by the non-round drive means by way of a toothed belt 78 which engages into a respective profiling of the non-round drive means 62a and 63a.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a further embodiment, with a chain 80 being used for the transmission of the drive output from the non-round drive wheel 62b to the drive wheel 63b instead of belt 78. The bearing of the individual pulleys can occur according to the embodiment of fig. 3.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
