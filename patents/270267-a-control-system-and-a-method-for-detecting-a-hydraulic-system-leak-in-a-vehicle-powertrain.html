FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present disclosure relates to internal combustion engines, and more<br>
particularly to engine control systems that detect hydraulic fluid leaks in<br>
hydraulic systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Some internal combustion engines include engine control system that deactivate<br>
cylinders under specific low load operating conditions. For example, an eight<br>
cylinder engine can be operated using four cylinders to improve fuel economy by<br>
reducing pumping losses. This process is generally referred to as active fuel<br>
management (AFM). Operation using all of the engine cylinders is referred to as<br>
an "activated" mode. Conversely, operation using less than all of the cylinders of<br>
the engine (i.e. one or more cylinders are not active) is referred to as a<br>
"deactivated" mode.<br><br>
In the deactivated mode, there are fewer firing cylinders. As a result, there is<br>
less drive torque available to drive the vehicle driveline and accessories (e.g.<br>
alternator, coolant pump, A/C compressor). However, engine efficiency is<br>
increased as a result of decreased air pumping losses due to the deactivated<br>
cylinders not taking in and compressing fresh intake air.<br>
A lifter oil manifold assembly (LOMA) is implemented to activate and deactivate<br>
select cylinders of the engine. The LOMA includes a series of solenoids<br>
associated with corresponding cylinders. The solenoids are selectively energized<br>
to enable hydraulic fluid flow to the lifters to inhibit valve lifter operation, thereby<br>
deactivating the corresponding cylinders.<br><br>
The LOMA can experience significant oil leakage caused by faulty assemblies,<br>
hydraulic solenoid valves, and/or LOMA gaskets. Hydraulic leaks can slow the<br>
dynamic response of the LOMA subsystems and cause engine damage due to<br>
mistimed AFM valve lifter events.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A control system and method for detecting a hyudraulic system leak in an engine<br>
includes a pressure sensor that senses a first pressure reading of a hydraulic<br>
fluid supply at a first time and a second pressure reading of said hydraulic fluid<br>
supply at a second time. A comparison module calculates a pressure ratio based<br>
on the first and second pressure readings and signals a fault condition based on<br>
a relationship between the pressure ratio and a pressure threshold.<br>
In other features, a pressure reading module determines the first pressure<br>
reading before a mode change of the engine and determines the second<br>
pressure reading after the mode change of the engine. The comparison module<br>
signals the fault condition when the pressure ratio one of falls below the<br>
pressure threshold the comparison module stores said fault condition as a fault<br>
code.<br>
In other features, a filtering module removes high frequency content from the<br>
first pressure reading and the second pressure reading. A pressure reading<br>
module determines the first pressure reading before an active fuel management<br>
event of the engine and determines the second pressure reading after the active<br>
fuel management event of the engine. The active fuel management event<br>
includes deactivating a set of cylinders of the engine. A pressure reading module<br><br>
determines the first pressure reading before actuating a valve of the engine and<br>
determines the second pressure reading after actuating the valve of the engine.<br>
A control system for detecting a hydraulic system leak in an engine includes a<br>
pressure sensor that senses pressure of a hydraulic fluid supply, a pressure<br>
reading that determines a first pressure reading of the hydraulic fluid supply at a<br>
first time and a second pressure reading of the hydraulic fluid supply at a<br>
second time, and a comparison module that calculates a pressure ratio based on<br>
the first and second pressure readings and that signals a fault condition based on<br>
a relationship between the pressure ratio and a pressure ratio threshold.<br>
In other features, the comparison module signals the fault condition when the<br>
pressure ratio falls below the pressure threshold and rises above the pressure<br>
threshold. The reading module determines the first pressure reading before<br>
actuating a valve of the engine and determines the second pressure reading<br>
after actuating the valve of the engine. The pressure reading module determines ,<br>
the first pressure reading before an active fuel management event of the engine<br>
and determines the second pressure reading after the active fuel management<br>
event of the engine.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following description of the preferred embodiment is merely exemplary in<br>
nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses.<br>
For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings<br>
to identify similar elements. As used herein, activated refers to operation using<br>
all of the engine cylinders. Deactivated refers to operation using less than all of<br>
the cylinders of the engine (one or more cylinders not active). As used herein,<br><br>
the term module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an<br>
electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that<br>
execute one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic<br>
circuit, or other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
Referring now to figure 1, a vehicle 10 includes an engine 12 that drives a<br>
transmission 14. The transmission 14 is either an automatic or a manual<br>
transmission that is driven by the engine 12 through a corresponding torque<br>
converter or clutch 16. Air flows into the engine 12 through a throttle 13. The<br>
engine 12 includes N cylinders 18. One or more select cylinders 18 may be<br>
selectively deactivated during engine operation. Although figure 1 depicts eight<br>
cylinders (N=8), it is appreciated that the engine 12 may include additional or<br>
fewer cylinders 18. For example, engines having 4,5,6,8,10,12 and 16 cylinders<br>
are contemplated. Air flows into the engine 12 through an intake manifold 20<br>
and is combusted with fuel in the cylinders 18. The engine also includes a lifter<br>
oil manifold assembly (LOMA) 22 that deactivates the select cylinders 18, as<br>
described in further detail below.<br><br>
|8©2tL A controller 24 communicates with the engine 12 and various<br>
inputs and sensors as discussed herein. A vehicle operator manipulates an<br>
accelerator pedal 26 to regulate the throttle 13. More particularly, a pedal<br>
position sensor 28 generates a pedal position signal that is communicated to<br>
the controller 24. The controller 24 generates a throttle control signal based<br>
on the pedal position signal. A throttle actuator (not shown) adjusts the<br>
throttle 13 based on the throttle control signal to regulate air flow into the<br>
engine 12.<br>
[0022] The vehicle operator manipulates a brake pedal 30 to<br>
regulate vehicle braking More particularly, a brake position sensor 32<br>
generates a brake pedal position signal that is communicated to the controller<br>
24 The controller 24 generates a brake control signal based on the brake<br>
pedal position signal A brake system (not shown) adjusts vehicle braking<br>
based on the brake control signal to regulate vehicle speed An engine speed<br>
sensor 34 generates a signal based on engine speed An intake' manifold<br>
absolute pressure (MAP) sensor 36 generates a signal based on a pressure<br>
of the intake manifold 20 A throttle position sensor (TPS) 38 generates a<br>
signal based on throttle position<br>
EQJE3}- When the engine 12 enters an operating point to enable the<br>
deactivated mode, the controller 24 transitions the engine 12 to the<br>
deactivated mode In an exemplary embodiment, N/2 cylinders 18' (i e half of<br>
the cylinders N) are deactivated, although any number of cylinders may be<br>
deactivated Upon deactivation of the select cylinders 18', the controller 24<br>
increases the power output of the remaining or activated cylinders 18 Inlet<br>
and exhaust ports (not shown) of the deactivated cylinders 18' are closed to<br>
reduce pumping losses<br><br>
J9824] The engine load is determined based on the intake MAP,<br>
cylinder mode and engine speed. More particularly, if the MAP is- below a<br>
threshold level for. a given engine revolutions per minute (RPM), the engine<br>
load is deemed light and the engine 12 could possibly be operated in the<br>
_ deactivated mode. If the MAP is above the threshold level for the given RPMr<br>
the engine load is deemed heavy.and the engine 12 is operated in the<br>
activated mode. The controller 24 controls the LOMA 22 based on the<br>
solenoid control, as discussed in further detail below.<br>
^ \Qtf25fr Referring now to FIG 2, an intake valvetrain 40 of the engine<br>
12 includes an intake valve 42, a rocker 44 and a pushrod 46 associated with<br>
each cylinder 18. The engine 12 includes a rotatably driven camshaft 48<br>
having a plurality of valve cams 50 disposed therealong A cam surface 52 of<br>
the valve cams 50 engage the lifters 54 to cyclically open and close intake<br>
ports 53 within which the intake valves 42 are positioned The intake valve 42<br>
is biased to a closed position by a biasing member (not shown) such as a<br>
spring As a result, the biasing force is transferred through the rocker 44 to<br>
the pushrod 46, and from the pushrod 46 to the lifter 54, causing the lifter 54<br>
to press against the cam surface 52<br>
[Q£26J^ As the camshaft 48 is caused to rotate, the valve cam 50<br>
induces linear motion of the corresponding lifter 54 The lifter 54 induces<br>
linear motion in the corresponding pushrod 46 As the pushrod 46 is induced<br>
to move outward, the rocker 44 is caused to pivot about an axis (A) Pivoting<br>
of the rocker 44 induces movement of the intake valve 42 toward an open<br>
position, thereby opening the intake port 53 The biasing force induces the<br>
intake valve 42 to the closed position as the camshaft 48 continues to rotate<br>
In this manner, the intake port 53 is cyclically opened to enable air intake<br><br>
_J0fl22J Although the intake valvetrain 40 of the engine 12 is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 2, it is appreciated that the engine 12 also includes an<br>
exhaust valvetrain (not shown) that operates in a similar manner. More<br>
specifically, the exhaust valvetrain includes an exhaust valve, a rocker and a<br>
pushrod associated with each cylinder 18. Rotation of the camshaft 48<br>
induces reciprocal motion of the exhaust valves to open and close associated<br>
exhaust ports, as similarly described above for the intake valvetrain.<br>
-fO©?8J-. The LOMA 22 provides pressurized fluid to a plurality of<br>
lifters 54 and includes solenoids 56 (shown schematically) associated with<br>
select cylinders 18' as shown in FIG. 1 The select cylinders 18' are those<br>
that are deactivated when operating the engine 12 in the deactivated mode<br>
The lifters 54 are disposed within the intake and exhaust valvetrams to<br>
provide an interface between the cams 50 and the pushrods 46 In general,<br>
there are two lifters 54 provided for each select cylinder 18' (one lifter for the<br>
intake valve 42 and one lifter for the exhaust valve) It is anticipated,<br>
however, that more lifters 54 can be associated with each select cylinder 18'<br>
(i e , multiple inlet or exhaust valves per cylinder 18') The LOMA 22 further<br>
requires a pressure sensor 58 that generates a pressure signal indicating a<br>
pressure of a hydraulic fluid supply to the LOMA 22 It is anticipated that one<br>
or more pressure sensors 58 can be implemented<br>
t0®2%}-^ Each lifter 54 associated with the select cylinders 18' is<br>
hydraulically actuated between first and second modes The first and second<br>
modes respectively correspond to the activated and deactivated modes In<br>
the first mode, the lifter 54 provides a mechanical connection between the<br>
cam 50 and the pushrod 46 In this manner, the cam 50 induces linear motion<br>
of the lifter 54, which is transferred to the pushrod 46 In the second mode,<br>
the lifter 54 functions as a buffer to provide a mechanical disconnect between<br>
the cam 50 and the pushrod 46 Although the cam 50 induces linear motion<br>
of the lifter 54, the linear motion is not transferred to the pushrod 46<br><br>
_f£032]r The solenoids 56 selectively enable hydraulic fluid flow to the<br>
lifters 54 to switch the lifters 54 between the first and second modes.<br>
Although there is generally one solenoid 56 associated with each select<br>
cylinder 18' (i.e., one solenoid for two lifters), it is anticipated that more or<br>
fewer solenoids 56 can be implemented Each solenoid 56 actuates an<br>
associated valve 60 (shown schematically) between open and closed<br>
positions. In the closed position, the valve 60 inhibits pressurized hydraulic<br>
fluid flow to the corresponding lifters 54. In the open position, the valve 60<br>
enables pressurized fluid flow to the corresponding lifters 54 via a fluid<br>
passage 62. The pressurized hydraulic fluid flow is provided to the LOMA 22<br>
from a pressurized hydraulic fluid source.<br>
•fgtp?}' Although not illustrated, a brief description of an exemplary<br>
solenoid is provided herein to provide a better understanding of the present<br>
invention. The solenoids 56 generally include an electromagnetic coil and a<br>
plunger that is disposed coaxially within the coil The plunger provides a<br>
mechanical interface between the solenoid 56 and a mechanical element,<br>
such as the valve 60 The plunger is biased to a first position relative to the<br>
coil by a biasing force The biasing force can be imparted by a biasing<br>
member, such as a spring, or by a pressurized fluid The solenoid 56 is<br>
energized by supplying current to the coil, which induces magnetic force<br>
along the coil axis The magnetic force induces linear movement of the<br>
plunger to a second position In the first position, the plunger holds the valve<br>
60 in its closed position to inhibit pressurized hydraulic fluid flow to the<br>
corresponding lifters In the second position, the plunger actuates the valve<br>
60 to its open position to enable pressurized hydraulic fluid flow to the<br>
corresponding lifters<br>
fO032§s The detection control system of the present invention<br>
determines the occurrence of a hydraulic system leak at or downstream of the<br>
LOMA solenoid(s). In an exemplary embodiment, the hydraulic system leak<br>
can occur at, but is not limited, a LOMA gasket (not shown) More<br>
specifically, the detection control system of the present invention determines<br><br>
that a hydraulic system leak has occurred based on pressure readings of the<br>
LOMA hydraulic fluid supply preceding and following a commanded active fuel<br>
management (AFM) event (i.e. deactivation of select cylinders 18'). It is<br>
anticipated, however that the current invention can be implemented to detect<br>
leaks in other hydraulic systems in which hydraulic fluid flow restrictions<br>
remain substantially constant over the operation of the system.<br>
XOgSSfr In various embodiments, the fluid pressure sensor 58 can be<br>
positioned in other fixed engine fluid passages or galleries including, but not<br>
limited to, a hydraulic lash adjuster fluid gallery (not shown). Additionally, in<br>
various embodiments, rather than sensing pressure readings prior to and after<br>
an AFM event, pressure readings can be taken before and after switching<br>
among other various operating modes (i e changing actuation modes of a<br>
valve) For example, such embodiments include, but are not limited to, two-<br>
step variable valve actuation systems.<br>
■{9033] Referring now to FIG 3, the controller 24 includes a filter<br>
module 302 that receives as inputs, hydraulic fluid pressure signals (PSUppiy)<br>
provided by the pressure sensor 58 The filter module 302 contains low pass<br>
filtering components to remove high frequency content of the PSupPiy signal<br>
4fifl3S] The leak detection system 300 includes a pressure reading<br>
module 304 that determines a first pressure reading of the hydraulic fluid<br>
supplied to the LOMA 22 prior to an AFM valve 62 opening event and a<br>
second pressure reading after the AFM valve 62 opening event In the<br>
present implementation, the pressure reading module 304 determines the first<br>
pressure reading before the controller 24 energizes the LOMA solenoid(s)<br>
The pressure reading module 304 determines the second pressure reading<br>
after a period of time after the first pressure reading in which all commanded<br>
cylinders 18' should be deactivated, and the pressure of the hydraulic fluid<br>
supplied to the LOMA 22 should have recovered to substantially the same<br>
pressure as before the controller 24 switched the solenoid 56 A comparison<br>
module 306 calculates a pressure ratio of the second pressure reading to the<br>
first pressure reading The comparison module 306 then compares the<br><br>
calculated pressure ratio to a pressure threshold. If the pressure ratio is below<br>
the pressure threshold, the comparison module 306 generates a fault control -<br>
signal indicating that a hydraulic system leak exists at and/or downstream of<br>
the valve 62.<br>
f0ft3GJ-, Referring now to FIG. 4 a method 400 for determining the<br>
presence of a hydraulic system leak in the leak detection system 300 will be<br>
described in more detail. Control begins the method 400 at step 402. In step<br>
404, control determines whether to switch the solenoid 56 (i.e , from the de-<br>
energized state to the energized state) which will switch the engine 12 to the<br>
deactivated mode. If the engine 12 is not to be switched, control returns to<br>
step 404. In step 406, control determines a first pressure reading of the<br>
hydraulic fluid supply before delivering the hydraulic fluid supply to the lifter<br>
54<br>
ffHJ^SL. In step 408, control determines a second pressure reading of<br>
the hydraulic fluid supply In the present implementation, control waits a<br>
period of time before determining the second pressure reading In step 410,<br>
control calculates a pressure ratio of the second pressure reading to the first<br>
pressure reading taken in step 406 In step 412, control determines whether<br>
the pressure ratio is less than a pressure threshold If the pressure ratio is<br>
above or equal to the pressure threshold, control determines that no leak<br>
exists at the LOMA 22 and sets a no fault condition in step 416 If the<br>
pressure ratio is below the pressure threshold, control determines that a leak<br>
has been detected and sets a fault condition in step 414 The method 400<br>
ends in step 418 In an exemplary embodiment, the conditions can be stored<br>
as a fault indicator code Additionally, the fault indication code can be<br>
requested by a service technician during a diagnosis of the engine 12<br><br>
[O05SJ Referring now to FIG. 5A and 5B, the pressure ratio of the<br>
second pressure reading relative to the first pressure reading is determined<br>
based on test data using an equivalent LOMA system. More specifically, the<br>
pressure readings of the hydraulic fluid supply are monitored over time. The<br>
horizontal axis represents time given in seconds and the vertical axis<br>
represents pressure given in pounds per square inch (PSI)<br>
[&amp;ES&amp;\ FIG. 5A and FIG 5B illustrate simulations of the pressure<br>
readings of the hydraulic fluid supply provided to the LOMA 22 before and<br>
after the engine 12 is switched to deactivation mode In FIG. 5A, point A is<br>
approximately equal to 44 5 PSI and point B is approximately equal to 43 5<br>
PSI resulting in a pressure ratio of 0 978 In an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
pressure threshold could be set at 0.90. Since the pressure ratio exceeds the<br>
exemplary pressure threshold, the leak detection control system indicates that<br>
no hydraulic system leak has occurred It should be appreciated that other<br>
values for the pressure threshold are anticipated<br>
tgPRJT FIG 5B illustrates a simulation in which the leak detection<br>
control system of the present invention would signal a system leak Point A' is<br>
approximately equal to 44 1 PSI and point B' is approximately equal to 38 4<br>
PSI resulting in a pressure ratio of 0 870 The pressure ratio falls below<br>
exemplary pressure threshold indicating a hydraulic system leak within the<br>
LOMA 22<br>
