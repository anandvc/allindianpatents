				<td>Field of the invention:<br><br>
The present invention provides improved methods for preparing P- ketoester derivatives which are key intermediate for producing leukotriene antagonists and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. In one embodiment, the invention provides improved methods for preparing P- ketoester derivatives which are key intermediate for producing Montelukast.<br><br>
Background of the invention:<br><br>
Leukotrienes are autocrine and paracrine eicosanoid lipid mediators derived from arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase. It has been found that antagonists to leukotrienes can perform valuable functions in the treatment or amelioration of certain disease states, particularly those associated with inflammation.<br><br>
By way of example only, Montelukast sodium, is an important leukotriene antagonist and useful in the treatment of asthma and other related disorders.<br><br>
Several synthetic routes for leukotriene antagonists such as Montelukast sodium have been developed. In relation to Montelukast sodium, the P-Keto ester (m) is an important intermediate in these processes. (WO 2006/021974 Al).<br><br>
In the past, the desired p -Keto ester (m) has been obtained through a sequence of steps consisting of the condensation of 7- chloroquinaldine and isophthalaldehyde in presence of acetic anhydride the reaction of the resulting aldehyde with methyl magnesium halide to produce a secondary alcohol, oxidation of the secondary alcohol to give an aromatic ketone and reaction of the aromatic ketone with dialkylcarbonate.<br><br>
However, the synthetic strategy of the condensation of 7-chioroquinaldine with isophthalaldehyde has a number of significant disadvantages which limit the utility of the synthesis. These include: the formation of a number of by-products and a relatively low yield (US 5,869,673). Further, prior methods use expensive reagents such as methyl magnesium halides, oxalyl halides. etc., making the economically inefficient.<br><br>
Our pending application AU 2006906456 discloses a process for preparing P -Keto ester of formula (in) has been obtained through a sequence of steps consisting;<br><br>
a)	condensing alkyl 3-formylbenzoate with 7-Chioroquinaldine to give alkyl 3- [((7-<br>
Chloro-2-quinolinyl)ethenyl)]benzoate.<br><br>
b)	hydrolysing alkyl 3 -[((7-Chloro-2-quinolinyl)ethenylflbenzoate to give 3-[((7-<br>
Chloro-2- quinolinyl)ethenyl)]benzoate; and<br><br>
c)	reacting 3-[((7-Chloro-2-quinolinyI)etheny]benzoic acid with a malonate to obtain a compound of structural formula (HI)<br><br>
There is therefore an unfulfilled need to provide cost effective industrially feasible process for the preparation of P -Keto ester of formula (III) which can be scaled up with increased yield and purity without multi step conversions described in the prior art.<br><br>
The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as, an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the prior art forms part of the common general knowledge.<br><br>
