The present invention relates to a process for preparing a key intermediate of cefprozil and provides less expensive and commercially viable process for preparing cefprozil.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,520,022 disclosed 3-[(Z)-1-propen-1-yl]-7-acylamido cephalosporins. These compounds are antibecterial agents. Among them Cefprozil, chemically (6R, 7R)-7-[2-amino-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido]-3-[(Z)-propenyI]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid is an orally effective cephalosporin antibiotic having a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cefprozil is represented by the following structure:<br><br>
Processes for the preparations of cefprozil, it's hydrates and related compounds were described in U.S. Patent No. 4,727,070, WO 98/04732, US 4,694,079 and GB 2173798. U.S. Patent No. 4,694,079 disclosed a process for the preparation of DMF solvate of cefprozil. U.S. Patent No. 5,608,055 disclosed a process for the preparation of 7-a-acylamino-cephalosporin by acylating 7-amino-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid or a derivative thereof in a halogen-free solvent. According to U.S. Patent No. 4,148,817 the silylation of [R-(Z)]-[4-hydroxy-a-[(3-methoxy-1-methyl-3-oxo-1-propenyl)amino]]benzeneacetic acid, mono potassium salt (amoxydane salt) can be done properly with hexamethyldisilazane and trimethylsilyl iodide and the silylated salt is converted into a mixed anhydride; and the patent also disclosed that the use of NtO-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide in the silylation results in the development of color which cannot be removed. Moreover the process as per U.S. Patent No. 4,148,817 requires isolation of silylated amoydane salt intermediate before converting to silylated anhydride.<br><br><br><br>
then silylating the mixed anhydride of formula V obtained above with A/,0-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide to obtain the compound of formula II:<br><br>
Mixed anhydride of formula V can be prepared by reacting the compound of formula III or a salt thereof with ethyl chloroformate in an organic solvent such as a chlorinated solvent, optionally in the presence of another solvent such as dimethylformamide. Preferably, catalytic quantities of N-methyl morpholine and methanesulfonic acid may also be used.<br>
The reaction is carried out below about -20°C, preferably below about -40°C.<br>
Silylation of the mixed anhydride is carried out in an organic solvent such as a chlorinated solvent using A/,0-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide. Other common silylating reagents such as hexamethyldisilazane and trimethylsilyl iodide etc., failed to silylate the anhydride. This is contrary to the observation (U.S. Patent No. 4,148,817) that silylation of [R-(Z)]-[4-hydroxy-a-[(3-methoxy-1-methyl-3-oxo-1 -propenyl)amino]]benzeneacetic acid, mono potassium salt (amoxydane salt) can be done properly with hexamethyldisilazane and trimethylsilyl iodide and the use of A/,0-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide results in the development of color which cannot be removed. Thus, silylation of amoxydane salt is different from the silylation of the mixed anhydride of formula II.<br>
Moreover, the novel process does not require isolation of intermediates whereas the prior art process (U.S. Patent No. 4,148,817) requires isolation of silylated amoxydane salt intermediate before converting to silylated anhydride.<br>
The compound of formula III used as starting material is commercially available.<br>
Use of silylated mixed anhydride of formula II in the preparation of cefprozil and pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof is also novel and<br><br>
provides another aspect of the present invention. Cefprozil and pharmaceutically acceptable salts also include their hydrates or solvates. The use of the silylated compound of formula V in the preparation of cefprozil is known but the problem with the use of the compound is the self-acylation resulting in the formation of the corresponding impurity. So, this requires strict control of relative quantity of this compound and strict control of addition of the compound to the compound of formula VI in order to avoid the self-acylation. The use of the silyl protected compound of formula II avoids the self-acylation and so, strict control of quantity of silyl protected intermediate is not required and controlled addition of the reactant is not required; and so, the use of the silyl protected compound of formula II in the preparation of cefprozil is practically advantageous. The use of formula II in the preparation of cefprozil may be formulated in the scheme shown below.<br>
Scheme:<br><br>
The reaction between the silylated compound of formula II and the compound of formula VI is carried out in chlorinated solvents such as methylene chloride. Preferably the reaction is carried out at -50°C to 40°C, more preferably at -40°C to 25°C.<br>
It has been found that the silylated mixed anhydride of formula II does not react with compound of formula VI in solvents such as acetonitrile or hydrocarbon solvent such as cyclohexane.<br><br>
The deprotection of silyl protected and N-protected group of the compound of formula VII obtained above may preferably be carried out with aqueous hydrochloric acid solution to obtain compound of formula I.<br>
Compound of formula I (cefprozil) may be isolated and converted to hydrates, solvates and pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts by known methods.<br>
The compound of formula I is preferably precipitated from the reaction mass as dimethylformamide solvate (cefprozil DMF solvate) by adjusting the pH of the reaction mass to about 5.5 to 7.0 with a base such as ammonia in the presence of dimethylformamide.<br>
Cefprozil DMF solvate may be converted to cefprozil hydrates or solvates; or to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt by a known method.<br>
The compound of formula VI used as starting materials may be prepared by known methods for example as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,694,079.<br>
The invention will now be further described by the following examples, which are illustrative rather than limiting.<br>
Preparative example 1<br>

potassium salt (43.5 gm), cooled to -20°C and dimethylformamide (160 ml) is added at -20°C. Then methanesulfonic acid (0.4 ml) and N-methylmorpholine (0.44 ml)  are added.  The contents are cooled to -50°C to -60°C,  ethyl<br><br>
chloroformate (14 ml) is added and stirred for 1 hour 30 minutes. A/,0-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (39 ml) is added to the reaction mass, stirred for 30 minutes and [7-trimethylsilylamino-3-(Z/E-propen«1-yl)-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid]trimethylsilyl ester obtained in step-l is added to this solution. The contents are stirred for 3 hours, 2N hydrochloric acid (120 ml) is added and the layers are separated. Then the mixture of dimethylformamide (300 ml) and acetone (75 ml) is added to the reaction mass, carbon (3 gm) is added and stirred for 30 minutes. Filtered the reaction mass, washed with 150 ml of dimethylformamide and the pH is adjusted to 6 - 6.5 with NH3 solution.

Step-Ill:<br>
The mixture of Cefprozil dimethylformamide solvate (58 gm, obtained in step-ll) and water (100 ml) is stirred for 1 hour, filtered, washed with acetone (100 ml) and dried under vacuum at 40 - 45°C to give 40 gm of cefprozil monohydrate (containing 10% E-isomer).<br><br><br><br><br>
