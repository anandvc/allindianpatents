				<td>IMPROVED METHOD  OF  ELECTROCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF AN ANALYTE<br>
Field  of the  invention<br>
This  invention  relates  to an  improved method for electrochemical detection  of analytes.<br>
Background  to the Invention<br>
WO  00/011473  describes. methods   of   electrochemical __ analysis  of  an analyte   (e.g antigen)   in  complex  samples  by using  potentiometric  sensor  electrodes   for   electrochemical detection  of the analyte.     The  sensor  electrodes  for  use  in these methods generally  comprises   an  electrically  conductive electrode   coated with an electroconductive  polymer   (e.g. polypyrrole).     Receptor molecules   capable   of  selectively binding to  the analyte to  be  detected are  immobilised in  or adsorbed to  the electroconductive  polymer  to  enable  the detection  of  the desired  analyte.     Detection  is  achieved via formation  of  a specific  complex,   containing  the  analyte  and also   a   label  component which facilitates   electrochemical detection,   bound to  the  receptor molecule   at  the  surface   of the   sensor electrode.<br>
The  detection-methods   of WO  00/011473   generally comprise  a  number  of  steps   summarised  as   follows:<br>
(a)	providing a  sens-or  electrode  having  an<br>
electroconductive polymer  coating  an having  immobilised  or<br>
adsorbed receptors   specific  for the   analyte   of  interest;<br>
(b)	treating the  sensor electrode  by  immersion<br>
in   a  sample  so  that  said  desired  analyte binds  to  the immobilised or  adsorbed  receptors   at  the  sensor  surface  to form a complex which  also includes   a  label   component;<br>
(c)	removing the   sensor  electrode   from the  sample  and<br>
subsequently monitoring  the  electric potential   difference<br>
between the  treated  sensor electrode  and a   reference<br>
electrode when both  are  immersed  in  a  suitable  inactive<br>
measuring buffer,   and  subsequently;<br>
(d)	monitoring  the  electric potential  difference  between<br>
the   sensor  electrode  and  a  reference  electrode  following.<br>
exposure  to  another buffer,   but  one  that is<br>
electrochemically  active,   thus  promoting electrochemical<br>
activity of  the  label  component.<br>
WO  03/019171   describes improved methods   for  the production  of potentiometric sensor  electrodes  and  also improved methods   of  electrochemical  detection using these sensor electrodes.     However,   the  improved methods   of electrochemical  detection described  in WO  03/019171   still rely on a  first measurement of  electric potential   difference between the  treated sensor  electrode  and a  reference electrode when both  a-re  immersed  in  a  suitable  inactive measuring buffer,   and  subsequent monitoring  of  the  electric potential  difference between the   sensor electrode  and  a reference  electrode  following  exposure  to  another  buffer which promotes  electrochemical  activity of  the  label component.<br>
The present   inventors  have  how developed  a  simplified method of  electrochemical detection which  does  not  require   a separate  step of measuring the  electric potential  difference between the  treated  sensor electrode   and a  reference<br>
electrode  when both  are  immersed  in  an  inactive measuring buffer,   prior  to  exposure to  a  buffer which promotes electrochemical activity of the   label   component,   to be carried out each time  the method  is  used for detection  of  a given analyte.<br>
Summary of  the invention<br>
In accordance  with the  invention there is  provided a method of  electrochemical .detection  of  an analyte   in   a sample  comprising:<br>
(a)	providing  a  sensor  electrode   comprising  an  electrically<br>
conductive  electrode  coated with  a  layer of<br>
electroconductive polymer;<br>
(b)	contacting the   sensor electrode  with a  solution<br>
comprising the sample  to be tested  for  the presence  of the<br>
analyte under  conditions which permit  formation  of  an<br>
electrochemically  active analyte  complex comprising  the<br>
analyte and an electrochemically  active  label  component on<br>
the  electroconductive polymer  layer;<br>
(c)	contacting the   sensor electrode plus electrochemically<br>
active analyte  complex with an  electrochemically  active<br>
measuring  solution which promotes  electrochemical   activity<br>
of  the  electrochemically active   analyte  complex;<br>
(d)	applying  a  current  to induce  a pre-determined holding<br>
potential  on the  sensor electrode;'<br>
(e)	removing the  current and allowing the  sensor  electrode<br>
to  return to an open circuit resting potential;<br>
(f)	measuring one   or more of  the  following parameters   as  an<br>
indicator  of  the  amount of  analyte  present  in  the   sample:<br>
(i)   the  difference between  the  holding potential  and the  open circuit   resting  potential,<br>
(ii) the rate at which the sensor electrode returns<br>
from the holding potential to the open circuit resting<br>
potential,<br>
(iii) the amount of current required to hold the sensor<br>
electrode at the pre-determined holding potential.<br>
The method of the invention is a simplification of the methods described in, for example, and WO 00/11473 and WO 03/019171, since there is no requirement for separate steps of measuring electric potential difference between the sensor electrode and a reference electrode in an inactive measuring buffer and in a second buffer which promotes electrochemical activity of the label component.  Thus., there is no need to prepare a separate inactive measuring solution and no need for additional fluid and/or electrode manipulation steps to transfer the sensor electrode from the inactive measuring solution to an active measuring solution.<br>

Detailed description of  the  invention<br>
The method of  the  invention utilises   sensor  electrodes coated with  a  layer  of  electroconductive  polymer.     The  basic characteristics  of  these  sensor electrodes,   and also preferred methods  for production of the  electrodes by coating  of  electrically  conductive  electrodes   with a  layer of conductive polymer,   are  described more   fully below  and also in  the  applicant's  published International   Patent Applications WO  00/11473   and WO  03/019171,   the   contents   of which are incorporated herein  in their  entirety by reference.<br>
The sensor  electrodes may be essentially  any  suitable electrodes   comprising  a  conductive  or  semi-conductive  layer. Suitable electrodes  include  standard potentiometric electrodes  possessing metallic  or  quasi-metallic conductivity that  are   stable  in  aqueous media,   e.g.   gold  and other noble metal  electrodes.     The  sensor   electrodes  are<br>
electrochemically   coated,   preferably  on  at   least  a  portion of  at  least  one major  surface,   with  a   layer  of electroconductive  polymer,   e.g.   polypyrrole,   polythiophene, polyfuran,   polyaniline,   etc.     A thin  layer  of the  polymer  is deposited  onto the  electrically  conductive  electrode  by electrochemical  synthesis   from a  solution  comprising monomers,   a polar  solvent  and a background  electrolyte, according  to procedures,   which  are   known in  the  art   (see WO 00/11473  and WO  98/37409).     Pyrrole  is  the  preferred monomer,   but  other monomers  such  as  thiophene,   furan  or aniline may also be  used.   Combinations  of  two  or more   of these monomers may  also be  used,   leading  to  the production of  conductive co-polymers.<br>
The  preferred  supporting  electrolyte  is   sodium dodecylsulphate but  other  electrolytes may be  used.     The electrolyte  also  serves  as  a doping  agent.   Deionised water is  preferably used  as  the  polar  solvent.<br>
The  electrochemical  polymerisation  solution  generally consists   of  an aqueous   solution of monomers   and supporting electrolyte.     However-,   other components may be  added to  the polymerisation solution  such as,   for  example,   components that  provide  specific  functional  groups  that  can be  used as linkers  for biological   receptors  or  for  chemical modification of the  sensor  surface   (see WO  00/11473   and WO 98/37409).<br>
Electrochemical  polymerisation  is  typically  carried out in  a  three  electrode  cell  comprising   of  sensor  electrode (s) to be  coated,  the   auxiliary electrode   and  the  reference electrode.     Suitable  assemblies  have  been  described  in  the prior  art   (see  WO  00/11473   and  references   contained therein) .     Multiple   sensor  electrodes  can be  combined  in  a block with one  electrical  contact.     An  entire  array  of sensing electrodes  may be  coated in  a  single polymerisation reaction.     This may  use   either  a  single  auxiliary  electrode or one  auxiliary  electrode per pair  of  sensing and   reference electrodes.     For  example,   arrays  that  include  a third counter-electrode  associated with  each pair  of sensing   and reference  electrodes   (e.g.   for  amperometric  analysis)   may  be coated using the  third  counter-electrode- as  the  auxiliary electrode.     In  a  further  arrangement,   the  reference electrodes may be  used as  the auxiliary   (counter)   electrode for  the polymerisation  step.     The  reference  electrode may be manipulated to function  as  an auxiliary electrode   for polymerisation,   for  example with Ag/AgCl  electrodes  the ratio  of Ag/AgCl may be  temporarily altered such  that  it functions as an auxiliary electrode  for polymerisation,   and then restored to  function  as   a reference  electrode   after polymerisation.<br>
As is well  known to persons   skilled in the  art, electroconductive polymers  are  often doped  at the electrochemical  synthesis  stage in order to modify  the structure and/or  conduction properties   of  the polymer.     The ease with which  ion  exchange takes  place  and the  rapidity with which ion equilibrium is  attained  for   electroconductive polymers  immersed  in  a  solution are  essentially dependent  on the  size of the  dopant  anion introduced  at  the electrodeposition  stage:   the  larger the  ionic radius  of  the dopant  anion,   the more  readily ion  exchange  reactions   take place  and the more   rapidly a  state  of  equilibrium is reached.     This  is   directly  linked to  the  value   and  rate  of<br>
change of the potential of the "metal electrode electroconductive polymer" system in response to variation in the ion composition of the solution.  The type of the response (anionic, cationic, redox) and its rate can be determined during the polymerisation.<br>
A typical dopant anion is sulphate (S042~) , which is incorporated during the polymerisation process, neutralising the positive charge on the polymer backbone.  Sulphate is not readily released by ion exchange and thus helps to maintain the structure of the polymer.<br>
For redox and pH sensitive sensors it is preferred to use a salt whose anions have a large ionic radius as the background electrolyte when preparing the electrochemical polymerisation solution. In this case ion response is minimised and redox or pH response predominate, potentiometric response is provided by electron exchange between the polymer film and surrounding solution.<br>
Suitable salts whose anions have large ionic radius include sodium dodecyl sulphate and dextran sulphate.  The concentration of these salts in the electrochemical , polymerisation solution is varied according to the type of test within the range of from 0.0001 to 0.05 M.<br>
Redox response can be increased by incorporating into the polymer dopant ions, which can change their redox state due to the changes in the surrounding solution giving the sensor the additional change in redox state.  The dopant should be in reduced form if one of the solution components is oxidized and vice versa.  K3 [Fe (CN) 6] /K4 [Fe (CN) 6] can be<br>
10<br>
given as  an  example  for both  cases.       The  concentration of these  electrolytes   in  the  electrochemical  polymerisation solution can be varied within the   range of   from  0.001   to  0.1 M to meet  specific   requirements   of  the  test.<br>
The surfaces  of  electroconductive polymer-coated electrodes  can be   further modified by  coating with biological molecules  for specific binding  of'the   analyte (also referred to herein as   "receptors"}   or  other   functional groups  or  molecules  which  can be  used  as  linkers   or   adaptors for biological molecules or  for  chemical modification  of the sensor surface   (see WO   00/11473,   WO  98/37409   and WO 96/02001).<br>
Biological  molecules,   for  example  receptor molecules capable of  specifically binding  to the  analyte   under  test, can be immobilised  onto a  sensor using well  known  techniques for  solid phase   coating.     Biological molecules  may be incorporated into  the  electroconductive polymer  during the polymerisation  reaction,   or  they may be adsorbed  onto  the surface  of  the   coated  sensing electrode in  a   separate modification step  after the polymer coating   step,   or  they may be covalently  linked to  the polymer coating   (see WO 00/11473,   WO  98/37409  and WO  96/02001).<br>
In a particular embodiment  the biological  molecules may be   "adaptor molecules" which enable the attachment  of further molecules,   or  even whole  cells,   to  the   surface of the  sensor via   a   specific binding  interaction.     With  the selection of appropriate adaptor molecules   it   is   also possible  to manufacture "universal"   sensing  electrodes containing  adaptor molecules   capable   of binding   to   a   whole ange of different receptor molecules.  Specificity for the analyte under test is conferred on the "universal" sensing electrode simply by binding to the adaptor molecules receptors of the appropriate specificity.<br>
The proteins avidin and streptavidin are preferred for use as adaptor molecules.  Investigations carried out by the authors of  have shown that avidin and streptavidin immobilised in an electroconductive polymer film, retain their native properties for an extended period of time (at least one year and possibly longer) and can be used throughout this period to link with biotin conjugated receptors.  Techniques that allow the conjugation of biotin to a wide range of different molecules are well known in the art.  Thus sensing electrodes with immobilised avidin or streptavidin can easily made specific for a given analyte merely by binding of the appropriate biotinylated receptors via biotin/avidin or biotin/streptavidin binding interactions.<br>
Although avidin and streptavidin are the preferred adaptor molecules it-'is within the scope of the invention to use alternative adaptor molecules, for example protein A, protein G, lectins and FITC.  The incorporation of adaptor molecules enables other biological molecules or whole cells to be attached to the surface of the sensing electrode, for example via protein A/antibody, protein G/antibody, FITC/anti FITC or lectin/sugar binding interactions. Biological molecules may alternatively be absorbed directly or covalently bound to the polymer-coated sensor surface.<br>
In order to perform the method of the invention the sensor electrode is first brought into contact with a solution comprising the sample to be tested for the presence of the analyte.  As used herein the term "sample" includes within its scope any material which it is desired to test for the presence of analyte, including but not limited to biological fluids such as whole blood, serum, plasma,, urine, lymph, cerebrospinal fluid, ascites, pleural ' effusion or semen, environmental fluids such as effluents or waste-products of the chemical industry, materials used or produced in the food and drink industry, for example milk, or a dilution or extract of any of the above.  The sample may also comprise a solution or extract of a solid material. It will be appreciated that certain types of samples may be tested directly without the need for any further treatment, such as dilution.  Such samples are also to be considered as "solutions comprising the sample to be tested for the presence of the analyte".  The solution comprising the sample to be tested for the presence of the analyte may also be referred to herein as a "test solution" .<br>
Contact between-the sensor electrode and the solution comprising the sample to be tested for the presence of the analyte can be achieved by fully or partially immersing the sensor electrode in the solution.  In this embodiment the solution may be conveniently placed in a suitable container, such as for example the well of a microtiter plate, a micro-centrifuge tube or any other vessel of suitable size to accommodate the sensor electrode or an electrode assembly comprising the sensor electrode. Alternatively, contact may be achieved by placing a drop of the solution onto the surface of the sensor electrode.  The volume of test<br>
solution will generally be from 5 to 200µl depending on the geometric dimensions of the sensing electrode.<br>
The sensor electrode is contacted with the solution comprising the sample for sufficient time and under conditions which permit formation of a specific electrochemically active analyte complex at the surface of the sensor electrode, and more specifically on the electroconductive polymer layer of the sensor electrode. The contact time between the sensor electrode and test solution is, by way of illustration not limiting to the invention, typically from 3 to 30 minutes at 15-40°C with or without continuous mixing.  The electrochemically active analyte complex must comprise at least the analyte to be tested and an electrochemically active label component. Formation of this complex at the surface of the sensor electrode is thus directly or indirectly proportional to the concentration of the analyte in the sample.<br>
The analyte complex is formed at or on the electroconductive polymer layer of the sensor electrode, such that the electrochemically active label component is held in close physical proximity to the electroconductive polymer.  The label component may thus have a direct or indirect effect on the redox properties of the electroconductive polymer and this effect provides an indication of the amount of analyte present in the sample, since formation of the complex comprising stoichiometric amounts of the analyte and the label component is directly or indirectly proportional to the concentration of the analyte in the sample.  Thus, the conductive polymer coating is in effect the transducing element of the sensor, i.e the redox  state of the  conductive polymer  acts  as  the transducer,   converting  the chemical   signal  associated  with the  concentration of the analyte  into  a measurable electrical  signal.<br>
The electrochemically active   label  component  can  be   any label which directly  or  indirectly  affects  the redox properties  of the electroconductive  layer  of "'the  sensor electrode.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the electrochemically active label component may be a charged label having the following properties:<br>
a)	it  carries  a  net  charge at  the pH of  the<br>
electrochemically  active measuring  solution;   and<br>
b)	the magnitude  of this  charge  changes  when  a pre<br>
determined holding potential  is  induced  at  the  sensor<br>
electrode,   thereby  charging the particle positively  or<br>
negatively with  respect   to its  preferred charge  state.<br>
Suitable charged labels  are  also  characterised in  that the magnitude of their   charge  changes   in response  to  a change in the ionic  strength of  the measuring solution  at constant pHr   or  in response  to  a   change  in pH at   a  constant ionic  strength.     This   effect  can be mimicked by  inducing   a pre-deterrained  fixed potential  at   the   sensor electrode, thereby charging the particle positively or  negatively  with respect  to  its  preferred charge   state.     Thus in the method of  the invention  there  is no need  to   carry out measurements of  the potential   of  the   sensor  electrode  versus   a   reference electrode  in two   separate measuring  solutions  -  i.e.   an inactive measuring buffer and  a   second  buffer which differs<br>
from the measuring buffer with   respect  to pH  at  constant ionic strength or  with respect   to  ionic strength  at   constant pH.     Instead,   the   effect of transferring the  label   component from "inactive"  to   "active"  buffer  are mimicked by  induction of  the pre-determined potential.     When  the pre-determined potential  is  applied the magnitude   of  the  charge  on  the charge  label  changes   such that   it  has  a  detectable   effect   on the  redox properties   of the  electroconductivd polymer  layer.<br>
Preferred  charged labels   include,   but  are'not   limited to,   gold,   ferrocene  or latex microspheres.<br>
In a  further  preferred embodiment  of the  invention the electrochemically  active label   component may be  an   enzyme label.     Suitable  enzyme labels   include  any enzyme  capable   of converting a  substrate  into  a  product whereby the  action  of the  enzyme  directly  or indirectly  affects  the  redox composition of the  electroconductive polymer  coating  of the sensor  electrode.<br>
In  one  embodiment  the  enzyme may be  capable  of converting a  substrate which has  no  detectable  effect  on the redox  composition  of  the electroconductive polymer  coating of  the  sensor electrode to  a product  capable  of directly or indirectly affecting  the redox   composition  of  the electroconductive  polymer  coating'. In a  further  embodiment  the  enzyme may be  capable  of converting a  substrate  capable   of  directly or  indirectly affecting the  redox  composition  of  the  electroconductive polymer coating  of  the  sensor   electrode  to  a product  which has  no detectable   effect  on  the   redox  composition  of  the electroconductive  polymer  coating.<br>
The  enzyme product  or  substrate may directly   or indirectly affecting the  redox   composition  of  the electroconductive  polymer  coating  cf the  sensor   electrode  by virtue  of  a change  in the  chemical' composition  of  the electroconductive polymer and/or by a  change "in pH  and/or  a change in ionic  strength in  the measuring  solution proximal to the  surface of  the electroconductive polymer  layer. _<br>
Preferred enzyme labels include, but are not limited to,'horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, urease, catalase and glucose oxidase.<br>
In  still further embodiments the label   component may comprise,   or form part  of,   a multi-subunit  enzyme   complex  or a multi-enzyme cascade.     For  example,   the  enzyme  label may. be  capable  of converting  a  substrate which  has   no   detectable effect  on the redox composition   of  the electroconductive polymer  coating  of  the  sensor  electrode  to  a  product which is  a substrate for  a-second enzyme,   the  action  of  the  second enzyme generating  a  second product  which directly  or indirectly affects  the  redox composition  of  the electroconductive polymer  coating  of the  sensor  electrode. The  second enzyme may also  form part of the electrochemically active  analyte  complex,   or may be separately associated with  the  electroconductive  polymer layer of the  sensor electrode.     Alternatively,   the   first enzyme may be separately  associated with the electroconductive  polymer layer  of the  sensor  electrode,   or might even be present  in  the bulk  solution,   with  the  second<br>
enzyme   forming  part   of  the   electrochemically  active analyte complex.<br>
Formation  of the  electrochemically  active   analyte complex  can be performed  in many ways  as   will  be  understood by those  skilled  in  the  art  of  diagnostic  assay  development, these  include,   inter alia,   all  forms  of heterogeneous   and homogeneous,   competitive  and  sandwich assays,' as   described in  further detail below.<br>
The method of the   invention may be  adapted   to perform quantitative  assays  for  a  wide  range  of  analytes .     In particular,   the method may be  used to perform electrochemical binding  assays   in  sandwich  or  competitive formats.<br>
A typical  sandwich  assay  requires  a  ""capture"  receptor having specificity for  the   analyte  of  interest.     The receptor may be  essentially any type  of   specific  binding agent  capable of  specifically binding to  the  analyte  of interest.     Suitable  receptors  include,   but  are  not  limited to,   naturally occurring  or  recombinant biological binding agents  such as,   for  example,   antibodies   or  fragments  thereof such as  F(ab')2  fragments,   scAbs,   Fv and  scFv  fragments etc.,-   nucleic  acids,   lectins,   all  types   of  ligand-binding receptors,   such  as  hormone   receptors,   cytokine   receptors etc.,   nucleic acid binding proteins  and  aptamers .<br>
The  capture  receptor  is   typically immobilised on  the surface  of  the   sensor  electrode (s) ,   for  example   it may be adsorbed  to  the  surface  of  a  polymer-coated  electrode   or incorporated into the  polymer   coating.     When the   sensor electrode  is  in use,   any analyte present  in the sample   will bind to the  immobilised  capture  receptor.     Electrochemical detection  of bound  analyte  requires  a   secondary receptor, capable of binding to  the  analyte  at  a  site  spatially distinct  from the  site  of binding  to  the  capture  agent.     The secondary receptor  is   typically conjugated  with the  label component,   such as   a  charge  or  enzyme   label,   that  permits electrochemical detection,   as  described herein.     In this embodiment  the "electrochemiclaly  active  analyte  complex" formed on the electroconductive polymer  layer  of the   sensor electrode is  a complex  of  capture  receptor,   analyte, secondary receptor  and  label  component.<br>
The  affinity  reaction  steps  of  the  above-described assay are  equivalent  to  a  standard  sandwich binding  assay well  known  to those  skilled in the  art.     The  sandwich   format of  analysis  is particularly  useful  for  the  detection  of polyvalent  antigens,   in which  case  the  capture  agent  and labelled secondary  receptor  used in the  test  are preferably antibodies  that bind to  different,   spatially  distinct epitopes  on the antigen.     The  sandwich format may  also be used where  the antigen  carries  two  or more  identical epitopes,   which  are  spatially  separated.     In  this  latter embodiment   the  capture  agent  and labelled  secondary receptor used in the test may be antibodies   of  identical specificity.<br>
A typical competitive binding  assay  also requires   a "capture"  receptor having  specificity  for  the analyte   of interest,   which is  typically immobilised  on  the  surface  of the   sensor  electrode(s),   as   described  for  the  sandwich assay.     When the   sensor  electrode  is  brought  into  contact with  the  sample,    any  analyte  present   in  the  sample   will  bind to  the  immobilised  capture   receptor.     Competing molecules also  capable of binding  to  the  capture  agent  compete  with the  analyte  for binding  to  the  available   capture  agent.     The competing molecules   are   labelled with  a  label  component  that enables  electrochemical   detection,   e.g.   a   charge  or  enzyme label.     In  this  embodiment  the   "electrochemically  active analyte  complex"   formed  on the electroconductive polymer layer of the  sensor  electrode  is  a  complex  of capture receptor,   competing molecule  and label  component.<br>
In  the  competitive   electrochemical  assay the   competing molecules  may be   labelled analyte  or   labelled  structural analogs   of the  analyte  that  are  capable  of binding   to  the same  analyte binding  site  on  the  immobilized/adsorbed capture  agent.     The  use  of  labelled analyte  as  the   competing molecule  is particularly preferred  for  the  detection  of small  analyte molecules.   Alternatively,   the  competing molecule may bind  to  a  different  site   on  the immobilized/adsorbed capture  agent.     For  example,   if   the immobilized capture  agent  is  an  antibody,   the  competing molecule  could be   an-anti-immunoglobulin  antibody (preferably Fab-specific)   or even  an  anti-idiotype  antibody of  the  appropriate  specificity.     Competitive detection methods   are usually dependent  on there  being an  excess   of capture  sites on  the  surface  of  the  sensor  electrode.     Those capture  agents which do  not bind  analyte  will be  available for binding to the  competing molecule.     Assuming that  the total  number of  capture  binding  sites   remains  constant,   the amount  of bound  competing molecule  will be  inversely proportional to  the  amount  of  analyte  present. The  affinity reaction  steps   of the   above-described methods  are  substantially  equivalent  to   standard sandwich  or competitive enzyme  linked immunesorbant  assays   (ELISA)   well known  to  those skilled  in the  art.     Although the method of the  invention is  particularly suitable   for performing electrochemical  ELISA assays  it will be  appreciated  that  the basic  assay o'f -the  invention can be utilised to perform other  types of assays  involving  changes  in pH,   ionic strength or redox potential,   for  example  assays   involving alternative .receptors   (e.g  single  stranded nucleic  acids/ enzymes,   cell based systems   etc) .     The method of the invention may also be  used to perform direct  enzymatic assays   for analytes  that are also  substrates  for  a  suitable enzyme.     In such embodiments the  enzyme,   which also constitutes the  label  component,   may be  immobilised in  or adsorbed directly  on the eletroconductive polymer,   rather than being conjugated to an  additional  receptor  component.<br>
After formation  of the  electrochemically active   analyte complex the sensor electrode is  brought  into  contact with   an electrochemically active measuring solution or buffer  which promotes electrochemical  activity of the electrochemically active  analyte  complex.     By  "promotes   electrochemical activity  " is meant  that the active measuring solution provides  conditions  which allow  changes  in a property  or activity of the  label  component  of the  analyte  complex,   for example  in response  to  application  and  subsequent  removal   of external current.     This  change  in  a property or  activity of the  label complex  in turn  directly or  indirectly affects  the redox properties   of  the  electroconductive layer  of  the sensor electrode. <br>
For example, in embodiments wherein the analyte complex includes a charged label component, the pH and/or ionic strength of the active measuring solution will be such that the magnitude of the charge on the charged label component may change in response to an externally applied current. The molarity, ionic strength and pH of active measuring solutions for use with charge labels may vary depending on the magnitude/strength and polarity of the charge on the lavel.  In embodiments wherein the analyte complex includes an enzyme label component the active measuring solution may include a substrate for the enzyme.  Suitable active measuring solutions for use with enzyme labels are low ionic strength buffers containing all reagents required for enzyme activation at the optimum pH for the particular enzyme, e.g. for horseradish peroxidase the buffer may be 5O mM citrate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.1 mg/ml OPD and 0.03% w/v hydrogen perborate.<br>
Step (c) of contacting the sensor electrode with the electrochemically active measuring solution may be achieved in several different ways.  In one embodiment the sensor electrode may be transferred from the solution comprising the sample of step (b) to the active measuring solution of part (c).  The sensor electrode may be physically transferred from a first container or vessel holding the solution comprising the sample to a second, separate container or vessel holding the active measuring solution. The sensor electrode may be washed after removal from the solution comprising the sample to remove any traces of the sample solution, including removal of any unbound analyte, before transfer to the active measuring solution.<br>
In a further embodiment of the method steps (b) and (c) may be performed in a single container or vessel, simply by adding an excess volume of the active measuring solution of part (c) to the solution comprising the sample of part (b) , after the electrochemically active analyte complex has formed on the sensor surface.  The excess addition of active measuring solution reduces any sample effect and at the same time removes lightly bound complexes.  This embodiment works in the same way as embodiments wherein the sensor electrode is "transferred" to the measuring solution because the effect that is being measured occurs on the sensor surface and any reactions occurring in the bulk solution have little or no significant effect on the measurement of the complex bound at the surface of the conductive polymer coating.<br>
In embodiments of the method which do not rely on. the use of containers for the various solutions a drop of the solution comprising the sample may first be placed onto the sensor.  When it is desired to replace the sample with active measuring solution the sensor may simply be washed to remove the sample solution and then a drop of the active measuring solution placed on the sensor.<br>
The sensor is allowed to settle in the active measuring solution for a short period of time (typically from 10 sec to 60 sec) and then a current is applied to activate the sensor and move the sensor electrode potential to a predetermined potential.  The pre-determined potential preferably relates to what the resting potential of the sensor electrode versus a reference electrode would be in a control measuring solution of substantially similar composition to the active measuring solution but without the electrochemically active component.  In the case of an enzyme label the control measuring solution would be a solution of identical composition, identical pH and identical ionic strength to the active measuring solution but lacking the enzyme substrate.  In the case of a charged label the control measuring solution would be a solution of lower ionic strength or different pH to the' active measuring buffer.  For any give sensor system a suitable value, or narrow range of values, for the pre-determined potential can be simply determined by measuring the resting potential of the system in a control measuring solution as a calibration step.  It will be appreciated that the chosen pre-determined potential can vary somewhat from the exact measured value of the resting potential without affecting the function of the assay method to a material extent.  Once suitable values of pre-determined potential have been determined, or supplied, for a particular sensor system, it is not necessary to repeat this measurement each time the sensor is used.<br>
The current driving the pre-determined holding potential may be maintained to hold the sensor electrode at the pre-determined potential for a suitable period of time (typically 1 sec to 10 sec).  The current is then switched off and the open circuit potential is measured for a defined time (typically 1 sec to 180 sec).  During this period the potential of the sensor returns to its relaxed state due to the electrochemical activity of the analyte complex, Figure l(a).  The time required for the sensor to return to its relaxed state depends on the reaction being measured and the concentration of that reaction occurring at the surface, this in turn being dependent on the amount of analyte present in the sample.<br>
In  the  case  of  the  analyte  complexes   incorporating enzyme  labels  an electrochemically  active  reaction<br>
(enzymatic  conversion of substrate  to product)   is  occurring continuously at  the  surface   of  the   sensor   electrode,   thus the  electrode quickly returns  to an  electrochemically induced  resting potential   once  the  holding  current<br>
(electrically induced potential)   has  been  removed.     The difference between the  electrically-induced holding potential   and the  electrochemically  induced  resting potential   (also  referred  to  herein  as   the  open  circuit resting potential)   is  indicative  of  the   concentration  of  the analyte  in the sample.      (NB  the value   of  this electrochemically induced resting potential in  active measuring  solution will be   different   from the resting potential  in  control buffer  without the   electrochemically active  component)<br>
In performing this method other measurements could be taken which would also be indicators   of   concentration   of analyte,. these are:<br>
the amount  of current required to hold  a  given predetermined potential,   and;<br>
the initial rate at which the potential  returns  to the electrochemically induced  resting potential.<br>
Thus,   the method of the invention may be based on measurement  of  any one  of,   or  any  combination  of  two   or more of,   the  following parameters:<br>
(i)   the difference between the holding potential   and<br>
the  open  circuit  resting potential,<br>
 (ii)   the rate   at   which the   sensor  electrode   returns from the holding potential  to   the  open  circuit   resting potential,<br>
(iii)   the  amount   of  current  required  to hold  the   sensor electrode  at  the  pre-determined holding potential.<br>
It  is most preferred for the method to be  based  on measurement  of parameter   (i),   but  inclusion  of  either  or both of parameters   (ii)   and   (iii)   as   "secondary measurements" would greatly improve  reliance  on  the   result of  the  analysis,   because  instead of  just  having  one measurement  three  synergistically related measurements   can be  used.     In addition,   any  one  of  these measurements   could also be used to monitor the condition  of the  sensor electrode  and signal  whether it  is   defective  in  any way and therefore  eliminate possible  false   results.<br>
Although the method only  requires  the  application  of current to  hold the  sensor at  a  single pre-determined potential,   alternative  activation profiles may also  be  used to  enhance  the  sensor  response  and  to  ensure  the   reference electrode  is  optimally equilibrated.     For   example,   the sensor may be driven to more than   one  potential  above  or below the  pre-determined potential  before   setting  the potential prior  to measuring the  open  circuit potential.     Or several  activation potentials   and/or   relaxation   steps   can  be performed,   as illustrated for  example  in  Figures   2   and  3.<br>
The measuring  steps  of the  assay method of  the invention,   steps    (d)   to   (f)   require  an electrode   assembly comprising the  sensor  electrode,   a  reference electrode  and a counter  electrode  or  auxiliary electrode.   The  reference  and<br>
counter  electrode   functions may be  provided by  a   single electrode in a two-electrode   system.      Alternatively, separate  counter  and reference   electrodes may be  used  ina three  electrode   system.     Suitable  reference  electrodes include,   for example,   standard  Ag/AgCl  electrodes   or   calomel electrodes.     Suitable  counter electrodes  include   electrodes made  of platinum,   other noble metals   or  other inert conductive materials  such as  graphite   or  carbon.<br>
The reference   electrode  and  the   counter  electrode   can be   external  to the   sensor electrode   or may be integrated with the  sensor  electrode to  form an  electrode  assembly.<br>
During the measuring steps,   current  is  applied  between the   counter electrode  and the  sensor  electrode  in  order to hold the  sensor  electrode at  the  pre-determined potential and the potential   of the  sensor   electrode  is measured relative to the  reference electrode when all electrodes  are in  contact with  the  active measuring  solution.     Thus,   the electrode assembly may be assembled  after the formation  of the  electrochemically  active  analyte   complex on the   electroconductive  polymer surface  of  the  sensor  electrode, but prior to  or  during  contact  with  the  active measuring solution.     For  example,   the  sensor,   counter  and  reference electrodes may be   fully or partially  immersed in  the   active measuring solution  and connected-via   suitable  instruments  to form an  electrochemical cell.     It Is  not necessary  for  the reference and counter  electrodes  to be brought  into  contact with the  sample   solution in  step   (b) .<br>
In  further   embodiments   one   or  more  sensor   electrodes, counter  electrodes   and  reference  electrodes  may  be  pre-<br>
formed in an integrated sensor assembly.  The sensor assembly may be formed prior to coating of the sensor electrode with an electroconductive polymer layer, in which case the reference and counter electrodes can also be used 5  for the purposes of electrochemical polymerisation of the polymer layer, as described in WO 00/11473 and WO 03/019171. Suitable sensor assemblies are also described in WO 00/11473 and WO 03/019171.  Many, different layouts of'the final sensor assembly are possible including, for example, "dip-10  stick" type sensors, multiwell plates containing integrated electrochemical sensors (as described in WO 03/081253) and lateral flow devices incorporating electrochemical sensors (as described in WO 2004/010143) .<br>
