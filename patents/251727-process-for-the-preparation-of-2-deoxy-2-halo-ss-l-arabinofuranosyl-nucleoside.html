				<td>The present application is a divisional application of the Indian Patent Application number 01609/DELNP/2003 and the said Indian Patent Application number 01609/DELNP/2003 having been filed on October 07, 2003 claiming priority from United States Patent Application no. 60/280, 307 filed on March 30, 2001 through International Patent Application no. PCT/US02/09848 filed on March 29,2002.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is in the area of the synthesis of 2'-deoxy-2'-halo-P-L- arabinofuranosyl nucleosides, and is specifically directed to an efficient method of synthesis and manufacturing of 1-(2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-ß-L-arabinofuranosyl)-thymine(L-FMAU).<br>
This application claims priority to U. S. Provisional Application No. 60/280,307, filed on March 30,2001.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Infection by hepatitis B virus is a problem of enormous dimensions. Hepatitis B virus has reached epidemic levels worldwide. It is estimated that as many as 350 million people worldwide are persistently infected with HBV, many of whom develop associated pathologies such as chronic hepatic insufficiency, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. After a two to three month incubation period in which the host is unaware of the infection, HBV infection can lead to acute hepatitis and liver damage, that causes abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated blood levels of certain enzymes. About 1-2% of these develop fulminant hepatitis, a rapidly progressive, often fatal form of the disease in which massive sections of the liver are destroyed, with a mortality rate of 60-70%.<br>
The Epstein-Barr virus is a member of the genus Lymphocryptovirus, which belongs to the subfamily gammaherpesvirine. It is notably lymphotropic. EBV has the classic structure of herpes viruses, viz., its double-stranded DNA genome is contained within an icosapentahedral nucleocapsid, which, in turn, is surrounded by a lipid envelope studded with viral glycoproteins. EBV is now recognized as a cause of B-cell lymphoproliferative diseases, and has been linked to a variety of other severe and chronic<br>
illnesses, including a rare progressive mononucleosis-like syndrome and oral hairy leukoplakia in ADDS patients. The suggestion that EBV is a major cause of chronic fatigue has not withstood scrutiny. EBV is primarily transmitted through saliva, although some infections are transmitted by blood transfusion. More than 85% of patients in the acute phase of infectious mononucleosis secrete EBV.<br>
It has been discovered that certain L-nucleosides, mirror images of the natural DNA constituents may inhibit DNA synthesis at the triphosphate level probably by tight binding to the viral polymerase in the first stage of viral DNA synthesis.<br>
2'-Deoxy-2'-fluoro-ß-L-arabinofuranosyl nucleosides have the general formula:<br><br>
OH wherein B is a pyrimidine, purine, heterocyclic or heteroaromatic base.<br>
Reported syntheses of L-FMAU<br>
Yung Chi Cheng, Chung K. Chu and others first reported that l-(2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-ß-L-arabinofuranosyl)-thymine (L-FMAU) exhibits superior activity against hepatitis B virus and Epstein Barr virus in 1994. See U.S. Patent Nos. 5,587,362; 5,567,688; 5,565,438 and 5,808,040 and International Patent Application published as WO 95/20595.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
L-FMAU<br><br>
The Cheng patents describe a synthesis of L-FMAU from the sugar L-xylose (formula A) as well as the sugar L-ribose (formula B).<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
These patents describe the synthesis of L-FMAU from L-xylose via conversion to the key intermediate l-9-acetyl-2,3,5-tri-0-benzoyl-|3-L-ribofuranose (see for example the '688 patent, starting at column 4, line 62). The key intermediate was synthesized from L-xylose in a total yield of 20% (see also L. Vargha, Chem. Ber., 1954, 87, 1351; Holy, A., et al., Synthetic Procedures in Nucleic Acid Chemistry, VI, 163-67). This synthesis was also reported in Ma, T.; Pai, S. B.; Zhu, Y. L; Lin, T. S.; Shanmunganathan, K.; Du, J. F.; Wang, C. G.; Kim, H.; Newton, G. M.; Cheng, Y. C.; Chu, C. K. J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39, 2S35. The inversion of the hydroxy group of L-xylose was achieved via the formation of the 5-O-benzoyl-l,2-O-isopropylidene-a-L-ribofuranoside, followed by a stereoselective hydride transfer during the reduction of the cycloketone furanoside with NaBHU. The resulting ribofuranoside was then converted to l-O-acetyl-2,3,5-tri-O-benzoyl-3-L-ribofuranose, the key intermediate in the synthesis of L-FMAU (See Scheme A).<br>
Scheme A<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
l-O-Acetyl-2,3,5-tri-O-benzo)'l-p-L-iibofuranose can also be synthesized directly from the more expensive starting material L-ribose (see for example the '688 patent, starting at column 6, line 30; and Holy, A., et al.( Synthetic Procedures in Nucleic Acid Chemistry, VI, 163-67). This alternative synthesis of l-0-acetyl-2,3,5-tri-
 <br>
Scheme B<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The key intermediate was subsequently fluorinated in a nucleophilic displacement reaction at C2 to obtain l,3,5-tri-0-benzoyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-L-arbinofuranose, which was condensed with a desired base, such as thymine (5-methyluracil) through the bromosugar to provide the 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-arabinofuranosyl nucleosides in various yields.<br>
Chu et al. later developed a synthesis for the production of L-FMAU from L-arabinose in 14 steps and an overall yield of 8% (Du, J.; Choi, Y.; Lee, K.; Chun, B. K.; Hong, J. H.; Chu, C. K. Nucleosides and Nucleosides 1999, 18, 187). L-Arabinose was converted to L-ribose in 5 steps (Scheme C). L-Ribose was then used in the synthesis 1-<br>
0-acetyl-2,3,5-tri-0-benzoyl-|3-L-ribofuranose, which as described above led to the formation of L-FMAU.<br>
Scheme C(Figure Removed)<br>
The processes mentioned above either start from an expensive sugar (L-ribose or L-xylose) and/or are very long, with low yields. In addition, they involve the use of a nucleophilic form of fluoride such as KKF2 or Et3N-3HF, which is difficult to handle and requires the displacement of an activated hydroxyl group. The instability of DAST prevents its use on large scale. The conversion of l-0-acetyl-2,3,5-tri-0-benzoyl-p-L-ribofuranose (TEAR) to l,3,5-tri-0-benzoyl-|3-L-:ribofuranose generates 2,3,5-tri-0-benzoyl-p-L-ribofuranose as a side-product, though it can be reconverted to TEAR.<br>
Reported syntheses of l-0-methyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-arabinofuranoside<br>
The synthesis of l-0-methyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-a-D-arabinofuranoside, has been reported by Wright et al. (Wright, J. A.; Taylor, N. R; Fox, J. J. J. Org. Chem 1969, 34, 2632, and references therein). In this report, D-xylose is used as the stalling material, which after a conversion to the corresponding furanose and a series of protection reactions, gave an epoxy furanoside as an intermediate. This compound was further converted to 5-0-benzyl-l-O-methyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-a-D-arabinofuranoside, which<br>
after  removal   of  the   benzyl   group   afforded   l-O-methyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-a-D-arabinofuranoside (Scheme D).<br>
Scheme D<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The synthesis of the l-0-methyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-3-D-arabinofuranoside (the anomer of the above compound) was reported by Marquez et al. (Wysocki, R. J.; Siddiqui, M. A.; Barchi, J. J.; Driscoll, J. S.; Marquez, V. E. Synthesis 1991, 1005). D-ribose was converted in several steps to l,3,5-tri-

Reported synthesis of 2-deo\'y-2-fluoro-D-arabinospyranose<br>
2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-arabinopyranose was previously made from D-arabinose via D-arabinal as it is shown in Scheme F (Albano, E. L et al. Carbohyd. Res. 1971,19,63).<br>

Reported synthesis of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-3,4-di-0-acetyl-D-arabinospyranose<br>
The title compound was previously made as a result of an electrophilic addition of selectfluor on D-arabinal (Albeit, M. et al, Tetrahedron 1998, 54,4839; Scheme H).<br>
Scheme H<br>
In light of the commercial importance of L-FMAU, and its use in the treatment of patients afflicted with .hepatitis B and Epstein Ban- virus, it is an object of the invention to provide an improved synthesis of L-FMAU and related nucleosides.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a synthesis of 2'-deoxy-2'-halo-p-L-arabinofuranosyl nucleosides from inexpensive starting materials in relatively high yield.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is a process for the preparation of_2^-deoxy-2'-halo-|3-L-arabinofuranosyl nucleosides, and in particular,, 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-|3-L-arabinofuranosyl<br>
thymine (L-FMAU)A from L-arabinQse,/ which is commercially available and less expensive than L-ribose or L-xylose. The process involves the initial synthesis of a 2-deoxy-2-halo-3,4-di-0-protected-L-arabinospyranose, via an electrophilic halogenating agent, and in particular a fluorinating reagent. Deprotection and isomerization affords a 2-deoxy-2-halo-L-arabinofuranoside, a key intermediate in this synthesis. The 3- and 5-hydroxyl groups can then be protected, preferably by benzoylation, and the 1-position can be activated, preferably halogenated, and even more preferably brominated. This compound can then be condensed with a protected pyrimidine, purine, heterocyclic or heteroaromatic base to form the desired 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-L-arabinofuranosyl-nucleoside.<br>
This process for the preparation of 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-L-arabinofuranosyl-nucleoside, and in particular, L-FMAU, is the first synthesis of this class of nucleosides from L-arabinose in ten steps. All of the reagents and stalling materials are inexpensive and no special equipment is required to carry out the reactions. A key step for the synthesis is the conversion of a pyranoside, 2-deoxy-2-halo-L-arabinopyranose, into a furanoside, 2-deoxy-2-halo-L-arabinofuranoside.<br>
In particular, in one embodiment of the present invention, a process for the preparation of a 2'-deoxy-2'-halo-|3-L-arabinofuranosyl nucleoside of the formula (I):<br>

III.   Detailed Description of the Process Steps<br>
Preparation of Starting Material - 2-deoxy-2-halo-L-arabinopyranose (II)<br>
The key starting material for this process is an appropriately substituted 2-deoxy-2-halo-L-arabinopyranose (II). The 2-deoxy-2-halo-L-arabinopyranose (II) can be purchased or can be prepared by any known means including standard reduction and electrophilic addition techniques. In one embodiment, the 2-deoxy-2-halo-L-arabinopyranose (II) is prepared from L-arabinal followed by halogenation. The L-arabinal can be purchased or can be prepared by any known means including standard reduction techniques. For example, the L-arabinal can be prepared from an appropriately protected L-arabinose, preferably protected with an acyl group such as with an acetyl group, according to the following protocol.<br><br><br><br>
1: L-Arabinose<br>
L-Arabinose (1) can be protected by methods well known to those skilled in the art, as taught in Greene, et al, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis. John Wiley and Sons, Second Edition, 1991, to form an appropriately protected L-arabinose (2), wherein each P is independently hydrogen or an appropriate oxygen protecting group such as an alkyl, acyl or silyl group, though preferably an acyl group such as an acetyl group. The<br><br>
protection can be carried out in any appropriate solvent that facilitates the desired result. In one embodiment the reaction is carried out in a mild base, such as pyridine. This reaction can be accomplished at any temperature that allows the reaction to proceed at an acceptable rate without promoting decomposition or excessive side products. The preferred temperature is from 0°C to room temperature.<br>
The appropriately substituted L-arabinose (2) can then be halogenated, preferably brominated, using an appropriate halide under any suitable conditions, though preferably acidic conditions, to obtain a l-a-halo-2,3,4-tri-0-protected-L-arabinopyranose (3), such as l-a-bromo-2,3,4-tri-0-acetyl-L-arabinopyranose. The halogenation can be carried out in any appropriate solvent that facilitates the desired result. In one non-limiting example, compound (2) can be halogenated with H-X, wherein X is F, Cl, Br or I, though preferably Br, optionally with a suitable acid, preferably an acyl acid such as acetic acid, optionally with an acyl anhydride such as acetic anhydride. This reaction can be accomplished at any temperature that allows the reaction to proceed at an acceptable rate without promoting decomposition or excessive side products.

The l-a-halo-2,3,4-tri-
The L-arabinal (4) can then be halogenated, preferably fluorinated, using an appropriate electrophilic halogenating reagent to afford compound (5).    Possible electrophilic halogenating agents are reagents that promote regiospecific halogenation. In one particular embodiment, an electrophilic fluorinating agent is used. Non-limiting examples of fluorinating agents that can be used in the electrophilic addition of fluorine to L-arabinal include, but not limited to, trifluoromethyl hypofluorite (CF3OF), acetyl hypoflurite (CH3COOF), xenon difluoride (XeF2), elemental fluorine (F2).    In an alternate embodiment the fluorinating agent is selectfluor™.

The preferred temperature is from room temperature to refluxing conditions. The halogenation can be prepared in any solvent that is suitable for the temperature and the solubility of the reagents. Solvents can consist of any polar protic or aprotic solvent including, but not limiting to, alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, pentanol or hexanol, acetone, ethyl acetate, dithianes, THF, dioxane, acetonitrile, nitromethane, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylacetamide, water, or any combination thereof, though preferably the solvent is water/nitromethane and water/acetone: (1/2).<br>
The optionally protected 2-deoxy-2-halo-L-arabinopyranose (5) can then be deprotected, if necessary, by methods well known to those skilled in the art, as taught in Greene, el al., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, Second Edition, 1991, to obtain the 2-deoxy-2-halo-L-arabinopyranose (II). The deprotection can be carried out in any appropriate solvent that facilitates the desired result. This reaction can be accomplished at any temperature that allows the reaction to proceed at an acceptable rate without promoting decomposition or excessive side products. For example, acyl protecting groups, and in particular an acetyl group, can be deprotected with sodium methoxide in methanol at room temperature.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, this procedure, can be tailored to produce the critical intermediate compounds for the synthesis of L-FMAU or L-FMAU analogs.<br>
Preparation of 2-deoxy-2-halo~L-arabinofuranose<br>
The 2-deoxy-2-halo-L-arabinopyranose (II) is reacted with any suitable acid (in gas or liquid form), such as, but not limited to sulfuric or hydrochloric acid in either catalytic amounts or in excess to form a 2-deoxy-2-halo-L-arabinofuranose (7), In a one embodiment of the present invention, 1 molar equivalent of sulfuric acid is used for this reaction. This reaction can be accomplished at any temperature that allows the reaction to proceed at an acceptable rate without promoting decomposition or excessive side products. The preferred temperature is from room temperature to refluxing conditions. This reaction can be carried out in any solvent that is suitable for the temperature and the solubility of the reagents. Solvents can consist of any polar protic or aprotic solvent including, but not limiting to, an alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, pentanol or hexanol, acetone, ethyl acetate, dithianes, THF, dioxane, acetonitrile, nitromethane, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl-acetamide, water, or any combination thereof, though preferably the solvent is methanol.<br>
The 2-deoxy-2-halo-L-arabinofuranose (7) can be optionally protected by methods well known to those skilled in the art, as taught in Greene, et al, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, Second Edition, 1991, to form an appropriately protected 2-deoxy-2-halo-L-arabinofuranose (8), wherein each P is independently hydrogen or an appropriate oxygen protecting group such as an alkyl, acyl or silyl group, though preferably an acyl group such as a benzoyl group. The protection can be carried out in any appropriate solvent that facilitates the desired result. In one embodiment the reaction is carried out in a mild base, such as pyridine. This reaction can be accomplished at any temperature that allows the reaction to proceed at an acceptable rate without promoting decomposition or excessive side products. The preferred temperature is from 0°C to room temperature.<br>
Preparation of 2 '-deoxy-2 '-halo-fi-L-arabinofumnosyl nucleosideThe appropriately protected 2-deoxy-2-halo-L-arabinofuranose (8) is optionally activated to form an activated 2-deoxy-2-halo-L-arabinofuranose (9), wherein LG is a suitable leaving group, such as O-Acyl (including OAc) or a halogen (F, Br, Cl or I), though preferably a halogen, and even more preferably Br. In one non-limiting example, compound (8) is halogenated with halogenated with H-X, wherein X is F, Cl, Br or I, though preferably Br, optionally with a suitable acid, preferably an acyl acid such as acetic acid, to afford compound (9). This reaction can be accomplished at any temperature that allows the reaction to proceed at an acceptable rate without promoting decomposition or excessive side products. The preferred temperature is room temperature. This reaction can be carried out in any solvent that is suitable for the temperature and the solubility of the reagents. Solvents can consist of any polar protic or aprotic solvent including, but not limiting to, an alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, pentanol or hexanol, acetone, ethyl acetate, dithianes, THF, dioxane, acetonitrile, nitromethane, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, diethyl ether, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl-acetamide, water, or any combination thereof, though preferably the solvent is dichloromethane.<br><br>
The activated 2-deoxy-2-halo-L-arabinofuranose (9) can then be coupled with an optionally protected pyrimidine, purine, heterocyclic or heteroaromatic base to afford the optionally protected 2'-deoxy-2'-halo-L-arabinonucleoside (11). Solubilizing substituents can be added to the purine base, pyrimidine base, heteroaromatic or heterocycle to promote solubility in the desired solvent system. It should also be understood that certain functional groups of the purine base, pyrimidine base,<br>
heteroaromatic or heterocycle might need to be protected to prevent unnecessary side reactions.    The reactive moieties can be protected using conventional means and appropriate protecting groups well known to those skilled in the art, as taught in Greene, et al, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis. John Wiley and Sons, Second Edition, 1991.   For example, the free amine on cytosine may be protected by reaction with benzoyl chloride or any other suitable acyl compound to prevent unnecessary coupling at the N4 position, to activate the cytosine base, and/or to assist in solubilizing the compound in the organic solvent. Alternatively, the free amine and/or free hydroxyl on the purinc base, pyrimidine base, heteroaromatic or heterocycle, such as thymine, may be protected with a silyl group, such as trimethylsilyl chloride to prevent unnecessary side products, to activate the purine base, pyrimidine base, heteroaromatic or heterocycle, such as thymine, and/or to assist in solubilizing the compound in the organic solvent. Any compound containing a nitrogen that is capable of reaction with a center of electron deficiency can be used in the condensation reaction. In one embodiment an O-protected thymine base, for example a silylated thymine such as trimethylsilyl-thymine, is coupled with compound (9).    In a preferred embodiment, the pyrimidine or purine base is silylated with a suitable silylating agent to form a silylated base.   Possible silylating agents are reagents that promote silylation, including but not limited to, 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane, optionally with a catalytic amount of ammonium sulfate.   This reaction can be accomplished at any temperature that allows the reaction to proceed at an acceptable rate without promoting decomposition or excessive side products.    The preferred temperature is refluxing conditions.<br>
The coupling reaction can be accomplished at any temperature that allows the reaction to proceed at an acceptable rate without promoting decomposition or excessive<br><br>
side products. The preferred temperature is room temperature. The reaction can take place in any solvent that provides the appropriate temperature and the solubility of the reagents. Examples of solvents include any aprotic solvent such as an alkyl solvent such as hexane and cyclohexane, toluene, acetone, ethyl acetate, dithianes, THF, dioxane, acetonitrile, chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, diethyl ether, pyridine, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylacetamide, 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane or any combination thereof, preferably dichloromethane, dichloroethane or a combination of chloroform and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane.<br>
The optionally protected 2'-deoxy-2'-halo-L-arabinonucleoside (11) can then be deprotected, if necessary, by methods well known to those skilled in the art, as taught in Greene, el al, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, Second Edition, 1991, to obtain the 2'-deoxy-2'-halo-L-arabinonucleoside (I). The deprotection can be carried out in any appropriate solvent that facilitates the desired result. This reaction can be accomplished at any temperature that allows the reaction to proceed at an acceptable rate without promoting decomposition or excessive side products. For example, acyl protecting groups, and in particular a benzoyl group, can be deprotected with n-butylamine in methanol at reflux.<br>
In cases where compounds are sufficiently basic or acidic to form stable nontoxic acid or base salts, pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be synthesized. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic bases and acids. Suitable salts include those derived from alkali metals such as potassium and sodium, alkaline earth metals such as calcium and magnesium, among numerous other acids well known in the pharmaceutical art. In particular, examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are organic acid addition salts formed with acids, which form a physiological acceptable anion, for example, tosylate, methanesulfonate, acetate, citrate, malonate, tartarate, succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, a-ketoglutarate, and cc-glycerophosphate. Suitable inorganic salts may also be formed, including, sulfate, nitrate, bicarbonate, and carbonate salts.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example by reacting a sufficiently basic compound such as an amine with a suitable acid affording a physiologically acceptable anion. Alkali metal (for example, sodium, potassium or lithium) or alkaline earth metal (for example calcium) salts of carboxylic acids can also be made.<br>
Any of the nucleosides described herein can be derivatized to its nucleoside or nucleotide prodrug. A number of nucleotide prodrug ligands are known. In general, alkylation, acylation or other lipophilic modification of the mono, di or triphosphate of the nucleoside is well known in the art. Examples of substituent groups that can replace one or more hydrogens on the phosphate moiety are alkyl, aryl, steroids, carbohydrates, including sugars, 1,2-diacylglycerol and alcohols. Many are described in R. Jones and<br>
N. Bischofberger, Antiviral Research, 27 (1995) 1-17.   Any of these can be used to functionalize the disclosed nucleosides to achieve a desired prodrug.<br>

Preparation of 2'-deoxy-2 '-fluoro-f}-L-arabinofuranosyl thymidine (L-FMA U)<br>
The peracetylated bromosugar of L-arabinose (15, Figure 1) can be obtained according to literature-procedure as a solid, in 57% yield after crystallization from ether (Balog, A.; Yu, M. S.; Curran, D. P. Synthetic Comm. 1996, 26, 935). The material is very unstable at room temperature and had to be used immediately or stored in a freezer.<br>
An optionally protected L-arabinal can also be obtained according to a literature procedure in 60% yield after column chromatography (Smiatacz, Z.; Myszka, H. Carbohydr. Res. 1988, 772, 171).<br>
The optionally protected L-arabinal can then be fluorinated via addition of selectfluor™ by a modification of a literature procedure to afford an optionally protected 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-L-arabinopyranose as a syrup in 42% yield (Albert, M.; Dax, K.; Ortner, J. Tetrahedron 1998, 54, 4839). Traces of what could possibly be the L-ribo isomer were detected by 19F-NMR (ratio L-arabino:L-ribo 30:1). The D-isomer of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-L-arabinopyranose was made by a similar procedure (Albert, M.; Dax, K.; Ortner, J. Tetrahedron 1998, 54, 4839). In the reference, nitromethane:water was used as a solvent, which may account for better yields (68% D-arabino and 7% of the D-ribo isomer). Alternatively, acetone: water can be used, which may account for better selectivity.<br>
Optionally protected 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-L-arabinopyranose can then be deprotected if necessary. For example, deacetylation of 3,4-di-0-acetyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-L-arabinopyranose was (17, Figure 1) can be achieved with NaOMe in methanol in one hour at room temperature. The desired unprotected 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-L-arabinopyranose (18) was obtained as an oil in a 100% yield. JH-NMR and 13C-NMR<br><br>
are coincident with the ones described in the literature for the D-isomer (Bols, M.; Lundt, I. Acta Chem. Scand. 1990, 44, 252). The D-isomer of 18 was previously made by three different groups but in a less efficient way.<br>
Treatment of unprotected 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-L-arabinopyranose with one equivalent of either sulfuric or hydrochloric acid at room temperature failed to give the desired furanoside. Only unreacted starting material was detected. Using nine equivalents of hydrochloric acid gave the desired product 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-L-arabinofuranose, which was contaminated with starting material (2:1 ratio). The best<br>
result, so far, was achieved by refluxing 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-L-arabinopyranose with 1 equivalent of sulfuric acid in dry methanol. After 6 hours all of the starting material had disappeared affording 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-L-arabinofuranose as an oil in 80% yield. 1H-, C- and 19F-NMR indicated a 3:1 a:(3 mixture of anomers, with some minor impurities. L-ribo- and L-arabinopyranoside as well as L-ribofuranoside are the possible side products. The D-isomer of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-L-arabinofuranose was previously made by two different groups, but in less efficient ways (Wright, J. A.; Taylor, N. R; Fox, J. J. J. Org. Chem 1969, 34, 2632. and Wysocld, R. J.; Siddiqui, M. A.; Barchi, J. J.; Driscoll, J. S.; Marquez, V. E. Synthesis 1991,1005).<br>
2-Deoxy-2-fluoro-L-arabinofuranose can then be optionally protected. For example, benzoylation of crude 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-L-arabinofuranose gave a mixture that was resolved by flash column chromatography to afford the a furanoside form of 1-0-methy]-2-deoxy-2-fluoTO-3,5-di-
Optionally protected 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-L-arabinofuranose can then be activated, preferably via bromination, and coupled to an optionally protected thymine, such as tiimethylsilylthymine, to obtain optionally protected 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-L-arabino-furanosyl-thymine. For example, the methyl glycoside (20) can be converted to the intermediate bromosugar (21) under HBr/A^OH condition, which in turn was coupled with silylated thymine (22) under standard conditions affording the known di-0-benzoyl-L-FMAU (23) in 42% crude yield (30% after crystallization from EtOH). The !H-NMR was identical to the ones described in the literature for the L- and D-isomers (Du, J.; Choi, Y.; Lee, K.; Chun, B. K.; Hong, J. H.; Chu, C. K. Nucleosides and Nucleotides 1999, 18, 187), and to a reference sample (Ma, T.; Pai, S. B.; Zhu, Y. L.; Lin, T. S.; Shanmunganathan, K.; Du, J. F.; Wang, C.-G.; Kim, H.; Newton, G.M.; Cheng, Y.-C; Chu, C. K. J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39, 2835.; and Du, J.; Choi, Y.; Lee, K.; Chun, B. K.; Hong, J. H.; Chu, C. K. Nucleosides and Nucleotides 1999, 18, 187; and Tan, C. H.;<br>
Brodfuehrer, P.R.; Brundidge, S. P.; Sapino, C.; Howell, H. G. J. Org. Chem. 1985, 50, 3647). However, the melting point (160°C) was identical to the reference sample but differs with the values published in the literature: 120-122°C for the D-isomer and 118-120°C for the L-isomer (Tan, C. H.; Brodfuehrer, P.R.; Brundidge, S. P.; Sapino, C.; Howell, H. G. /. Org. Chem. 1985,50, 3641.; and Du, J.; Choi, Y.; Lee, K.; Chun, B. K.; Hong, J. H.; Chu, C. K. Nudeosides andNudeotides 1999,18, 187).<br>
The optionally protected 2'-deoxy-2'-fIuoro-L-arabino-furanosyl-thymine can then be deprotected, if necessary. For examples, di-0-benzoyl-L-FMAU (23) can be debenzoylated with n-butylamine in refluxing methanol reducing the reaction time to 3 hours, from the 24 or 48 hours required when ammonia was used at room temperature (Ma, T.; Pai, S. B.; Zhu, Y. L.; Lin, T. S.; Shanmunganathan, K.; Du, J. P.; Wang, C.-G.; Kim, H.; Newton, G.M.; Cheng, Y.-C.; Chu, C. K. J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39, 2835; and Du, J.; Choi, Y.; Lee, K.; Chun, B. K.; Hong, J. H.; Chu, C. K. Nudeosides and Nudeotides 1999, 75,187). Yield of L-FMAU (24) was 77%. Melting point: 188°C (lit. mp 185-187° C, 1S4-185°C, 187-188°C) for the D-isomer; [a]D20= -93 (c 0.25 MeOH) (lit. value: [<x meoh was identical to the ones described in literature and a reference sample t. pai s. b. zhu y. l. lin shanmunganathan k. du j. f. wang c.-g. kim h. newton g. m. cheng y.-c. chu c. med. chem. choi lee chun hong nudeosides nudeotides tan brodfuehrer p. r. brundidge sapino howell org.></x>
