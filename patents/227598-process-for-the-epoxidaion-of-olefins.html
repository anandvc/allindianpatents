				<td>PROCESS FOR THE EPOXIDATION OF OLEFINS<br>
Prior Art<br>
From EP-A 100 119 and EP-A 230 949 it is known that propene can be<br>
converted by hydrogen peroxide into propene oxide if a titanium-<br>
containing zeolite is used as catalyst.<br>
Unreacted hydrogen peroxide cannot be recovered economically from the<br>
epoxidation reaction mixture. Furthermore, unreacted hydrogen peroxide<br>
involves additional effort and expenditure in the working up of the<br>
reaction mixture. The epoxidation of propene is therefore preferably<br>
carried out with an excess of propene and up to a high hydrogen peroxide<br>
conversion. In order to achieve a high hydrogen peroxide conversion it<br>
is advantageous to use a continuous flow reaction system. Such a<br>
reaction system may comprise either one or more continuous flow reactors<br>
or an arrangement of two or more flow mixing reactors connected in<br>
series. Examples of flow mixing reactors are stirred tank reactors,<br>
recycle reactors, fluidised bed reactors and fixed bed reactors with<br>
recycling of the liquid phase.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide is in general applied in the epoxidation reaction as<br>
aqueous solution. Thus it is believed that the epoxidation reaction<br>
takes place in the liquid aqueous phase. Therefore in order to achieve a<br>
high reaction velocity as high a propene concentration as possible in<br>
the liquid phase is necessary. Since the liquid phase predominantly<br>
comprises aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution and optionally an organic<br>
solvent solubility of propene in the aqueous phase is limited. So far in<br>
the prior art two different routes are described to achieve a high<br>
propene concentration in the aqueous phase.<br><br>
Since it is generally known that diffusion in a gas phase is by several<br>
magnitudes faster compared to diffusion in a liquid phase ( see for<br>
example Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook, 7th edition, Mc Graw.Hill,<br>
1997, pp 5-42) the reaction is carried out under a propene atmosphere at<br>
elevated pressure with the effect that a reaction system with an aqueous<br>
phase comprising all of the hydrogen peroxide and some propene and a<br>
propene rich gas phase is present. Thereby propene depleted from the<br>
liquid phase due to reaction is supplemented by propene from the gas<br>
phase.<br>
From EP-A 100 119 and EP-A 230 949 it is known that in the epoxidation<br>
reaction a solvent can be used to improve the solubility of propene in<br>
the aqueous peroxide phase. In accordance with the above described<br>
theory the reaction is conducted at elevated pressure to increase the<br>
solubility of propene in the aqueous phase. Only if no solubilising<br>
solvent is present the increased pressure would lead to a<br>
liquidification of propene. The presence of an organic propene rich<br>
phase in case of an aqueous phase containing a solubilising solvent is<br>
not disclosed.<br>
A similar route is taken in WO 99/01445 teaching a process for<br>
epoxidation of propene wherein temperature and pressure is increased<br>
during operation of the reactor in a manner effective to maintain a<br>
substantially constant concentration of propene in the liquid aqueous<br>
phase in order to compensate for catalyst deactivation. As is evident<br>
from examples 1 and 2 in WO 99/01445 the temperature is increased during<br>
the course of reaction from 65.6°C to 71.1°C in order to maintain a<br>
constant H2O2 conversion to compensate for catalyst deactivation. In<br>
example 1 the pressure was held approximately constant at about 20 bar<br>
with the result that concentration of propene in the aqueous phase and<br>
propene oxide selectivity decreased. In contrast thereto in example 2<br>
the pressure was increased to hold the propene concentration<br><br>
approximately constant with the result that propene oxide selectivity<br>
decreased to a lesser extent. But it would be still desirable to achieve<br>
a better propene oxide selectivity.<br>
EP-A 659 473 describes an epoxidation process wherein according to the<br>
examples a liquid mixture of hydrogen peroxide, isopropanol as solvent<br>
and propene is led over a succession of fixed bed reaction zones<br>
connected in series in down-flow operation. In each reaction zone the<br>
reaction is performed to a partial conversion, the liquid reaction<br>
mixture is removed from each reaction zone, is led over an external heat<br>
exchanger to extract the heat of reaction, and the major proportion of<br>
this liquid phase is then recycled to this reaction zone and a minor<br>
proportion of the liquid phase is passed to the next zone. Thus each<br>
reaction zone can be considered as an independent adiabatic reactor. At<br>
the same time gaseous propene is fed in together with the liquid feed<br>
stock mixture, is guided in a parallel stream to the liquid phase over<br>
the fixed bed reaction zones, and is extracted at the end of the<br>
reaction system in addition to the liquid reaction mixture as an oxygen-<br>
containing waste gas stream. As is evident from the examples reaction<br>
conditions were chosen that result in only one liquid aqueous phase<br>
wherein propene is dissolved. The increase in propene oxide yield<br>
compared to conventional tubular reactors is only related to the<br>
temperature control described in EP-A 659 473. But on account of the<br>
complexity of the reaction system required to carry out the process<br>
considerable additional costs are involved.<br>
Similarly according to WO 00/07965 the epoxidation reaction is conducted<br>
under conditions to have only one phase i.e. the liquid aqueous phase<br>
having a reasonably high propene concentration. In example 2 an aqueous<br>
hydrogen peroxide solution, methanol and propene is fed to a fixed bed<br>
tubular reactor. By adjusting the relative amounts of the feeds to a low<br>
ratio of propene feed to total feed and a high ratio of methanol feed to<br><br>
total feed and by applying a pressure of 20 bar only one liquid phase is<br>
present. Although by taking this measures a hydrogen peroxide conversion of<br>
98.4% could be achieved the propene oxide selectivity of 80.3% is still to low<br>
for a commercial application of the described process.<br>
IN WO 00/17178 as an alternative the possibility of conducting the<br>
epoxidation of propene with hydrogen peroxide using two liquid phases i.e. an<br>
aqueous phase and an organic phase is disclosed. But the presence of<br>
organic solvents having a low solubility in water like halogenated<br>
hydrocarbons are described as mandatory in order to form a second organic<br>
phase. Thus the second liquid organic phase is formed by a water insoluble<br>
organic solvent.<br>
In view of the cited prior art the object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
process for the epoxidation of defines that results in improved product<br>
selectivity compared to WO 00/07965 which can be carried out using<br>
conventional reaction systems.<br>
Subject of the invention<br>
This object is achieved by a process for the catalytic epoxidation of propene<br>
with hydrogen peroxide in a multiphase reaction mixture comprising a liquid<br>
aqueous hydrogen peroxide rich phase containing methanol and dissolved<br>
propene and a liquid organic propene rich phase.<br>
According to an preferred embodiment the present invention refers to a<br>
process for the epoxidation of propene with hydrogen peroxide in presence of<br>
a titanium-containing zeolite as catalyst in a multiphase reaction mixture<br>
comprising an liquid aqueous hydrogen peroxide rich phase containing<br>
methanol and dissolved propene and in liquid organic propene rich phase<br><br>
The present inventors have surprisingly discovered that by using a<br>
multiphase reaction mixture comprising an liquid aqueous hydrogen<br>
peroxide rich phase and an liquid organic olefin rich phase product<br>
selectivity compared to the prior art can be considerably improved<br>
without compromising hydrogen peroxide conversion. This result was<br>
especially surprising since it was expected from general textbook<br>
knowledge as exemplified by Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook supra,<br>
that in case of two liquid phases mass transfer from the liquid organic<br>
phase to the liquid aqueous phase where the reaction takes place should<br>
be by magnitudes slower compared to systems having a single aqueous<br>
phase or an aqueous phase and an olefin gas phase. According to the<br>
expectations this should have a negative effect on hydrogen peroxide<br>
conversion. But nevertheless product selectivity could be successfully<br>
improved according to the present invention without compromising<br>
conversion.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The essential feature of the present invention is the presence of two<br>
immiscible liquid phases i.e an liquid aqueous hydrogen peroxide rich<br>
phase and an liquid organic olefin rich phase while having a water<br>
miscible organic solvent present in the aqueous phase. As is appreciable<br>
by any person skilled in the art the presence of two immiscible phases<br>
in a reaction system comprising an olefin, an water miscible organic<br>
solvent and an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution will depend on many<br>
different factors.<br>
First of all the presence of an additional olefin rich liquid organic<br>
phase will depend on the temperature and pressure applied in the reactor<br>
and the selected olefin. Preferably the applied pressure is at or above<br><br>
the vapor pressure of the olefin at the chosen temperature. Furthermore<br>
it will depend on the selection of the organic solvent.<br>
Suitable as organic solvent are all solvents that are not oxidised or<br>
are oxidised only to a slight extent by hydrogen peroxide under the<br>
chosen reaction conditions, and that dissolve in an amount of more than<br>
10 wt.% in water at 25°C. Preferred are solvents that dissolve in an<br>
amount of more than 30 wt.% in water at 25°C preferably more than 50<br>
wt.% in water at 25°C. The most preferred solvents are completely<br>
miscible with water. Suitable solvents include alcohols such as<br>
methanol, ethanol or tert.-butanol; glycols such as for example ethylene<br>
glycol, 1,2-propanediol or 1,3-propanediol; cyclic ethers such as for<br>
example tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or propylene oxide; glycol ethers such<br>
as for example ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol<br>
monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether or propylene glycol<br>
monomethyl ether, and ketones such as for example acetone or 2-butanone.<br>
Methanol is particularly preferred.<br>
Using the process according to the invention any olefins can be<br>
epoxidized in particular olefins with 2 to 6 carbon atoms. The process<br>
according to the invention is most particularly suitable for the<br>
epoxidation of propene to propene oxide. For economic reasons it would<br>
be preferred for an industrial scale process to use propene not in a<br>
pure form but as a technical mixture with propane that as a rule<br>
contains 1 to 15 vol.% of propane.<br>
Additionally the presence of a second organic olefin rich phase will<br>
depend on the relative amounts of olefin, water and solvent. The amount<br>
of solvent is chosen to achieve sufficient solubility of the olefin in<br>
the hydrogen peroxide rich aqueous phase in order to get the desired<br>
rate of reaction. At a given temperature , pressure, olefin and solvent<br>
the relative amounts of ingredients can be adjusted to ensure formation<br><br>
of a second liquid organic phase. I.e. to ensure the formation of a<br>
second liquid organic olefin rich phase the amount of olefin has to be<br>
selected in excess of the amount soluble in the aqueous phase at the<br>
chosen temperature and pressure.<br>
A simple means of experimentally confirming the presence of a second<br>
liquid organic phase at the reaction conditions is by collecting a<br>
sample of the reaction mixture in a container equipped with a sight<br>
glass at the temperature and pressure used in the process.<br>
Alternatively, the reactor may be equipped with a sight glass at a<br>
suitable position to observe the phase boundary directly during the<br>
reaction. In case of a continuous flow reactor the sight glass is<br>
preferably positioned near the outlet of the reactor effluent to have an<br>
optimal control that two liquid phases are present through out the<br>
entire residence time within the reactor.<br>
Thus a person skilled in the art can without any effort verify whether<br>
when applying certain selections for olefins, solvents and reaction<br>
parameters a two-liquid phase system as required by the present<br>
invention is present and can adjust by variation of the parameters as<br>
discussed above in detail the reaction system in order to establish a<br>
second liquid organic phase.<br>
According to a most preferred embodiment of the present invention the<br>
olefin is selected to be propene. and methanol is used as a solvent. For<br>
example for a reaction mixture comprising propene, methanol, and aqueous<br>
hydrogen peroxide at a reaction temperature between 30°C and 80°C, a<br>
pressure from 5 to 50 bar the ratio of propene flow to total flow in<br>
case of a continuous flow system can be adjusted to be in the range of<br>
0.1 to 1, preferably 0.2 to 1 in order to obtain a second liquid organic<br>
phase. Specific reaction conditions are shown in the examples.<br><br>
A further advantage of a process of the present invention is, that even<br>
if the feed stream to the reactor contains olefin oxide either due the<br>
presence of olefin oxide in the feed stream or due to partial recycling<br>
of the reactor effluent, the product selectivity is not considerably<br>
effected, although a person skilled in the art would expect that an<br>
increased concentration of product in the reaction mixture should be<br>
detrimental for product selectivity.<br>
An additional gas phase comprising olefin vapor and optionally an inert<br>
gas i.e. a gas that does not interfere with the epoxidation can be<br>
additionally present according to the present invention. Adding an inert<br>
gas is useful to maintain a constant pressure inside the reactor and to<br>
remove oxygen gas formed by the decomposition of a small part of the<br>
hydrogen peroxide charged to the reactor.<br>
According to the present invention any known reaction system for the<br>
epoxidation of olefins is applicable including batch reactors and<br>
continuous flow reactors. It is preferred to use a non-adiabatic<br>
reaction system . i.e. a reaction system wherein the reaction heat is at<br>
least partially removed during the course of the reaction. Reactor<br>
systems with external or intermediate cooling are less preferred due to<br>
cost considerations. Continuous flow reaction system, especially those<br>
wherein the reaction mixture is passed through a fixed catalyst bed are<br>
particularly preferred.<br>
In the practice of the present invention according to the above<br>
preferred embodiment any usual reactor having a fixed catalyst bed and<br>
cooling means can be used. Preferably tubular reactors having a cooling<br>
jacket are applied since they are standardly available at relatively low<br>
cost. As cooling medium that is pumped through the cooling means,<br>
preferably the cooling jacket, preferably water is used. By preference<br>
the temperature of the cooling medium is controlled by a thermostat and<br><br>
the flow rate of the cooling medium is adjusted to keep the temperature<br>
difference between entry of the cooling medium into the cooling means<br>
and exit below 5°C.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the reaction mixture<br>
is passed through the catalyst bed in a continuous flow operation mode<br>
with a superficial velocity from 1 to 100 m/h, preferably 5 to 50 m/h,<br>
most preferred 5 to 30 m/h. The superficial velocity is defined as the<br>
ratio of volume flow rate/cross section of the catalyst bed.<br>
Consequently the superficial velocity can be varied in a given tubular<br>
reactor by adjusting the flow rate of the reaction mixture.<br>
Additionally it is preferred to pass the reaction mixture through the<br>
catalyst bed with a liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) from 1 to 20 h-1<br>
preferably 1.3 to 15 IT1.<br>
Whenever the flow rate of the reaction mixture is adjusted to fulfill<br>
the above defined requirements for superficial velocity and liquid<br>
hourly space velocity particularly high selectivities can be achieved.<br>
According to an especially preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
the process is conducted in down-flow operation mode especially the<br>
catalyst bed is maintained in a trickle bed state.<br>
When practicing the present invention the overall feed stream to the<br>
reactor comprises an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution, an olefin and<br>
the organic solvent. Thereby these components may be introduced into the<br>
reactor as independent feeds or one or more of these feeds are mixed<br>
prior to introduction into the reactor.<br>
In order to be able to operate the process continuously when changing<br>
and/or regenerating the epoxidation catalyst, two or more reactors may<br><br>
if desired also be operated in parallel or in series in the<br>
aforedescribed manner.<br>
Crystalline, titanium-containing zeolites especially those of the<br>
composition (Ti02)x(S102)1-x where x is from 0.001 to 0.05 and having a MFI<br>
or MEL crystalline structure, known as titanium silicalite-1 and<br>
titanium silicalite-2, are suitable as catalysts for the epoxidation<br>
process according to the invention. Such catalysts may be produced for<br>
example according to the process described in US-A 4,410,501. The<br>
titanium silicalite catalyst may be employed as a shaped catalyst in the<br>
form of granules, extrudates or shaped bodies. For the forming process<br>
the catalyst may contain 1 to 99% of a binder or carrier material, all<br>
binders and carrier materials being suitable that do not react with<br>
hydrogen peroxide or with the epoxide under the reaction conditions<br>
employed for the epoxidation. Extrudates with a diameter of 1 to 5 mm<br>
are preferably used as fixed bed catalysts.<br>
The hydrogen peroxide is used in the process according to the invention<br>
in the form of an aqueous solution with a hydrogen peroxide content of 1<br>
to 90 wt.*, preferably 10 to 70 wt.% and particularly preferably 30 to<br>
50 wt.*. The hydrogen peroxide may be used in the form of the<br>
commercially available, stabilised solutions. Also suitable are<br>
unstabilised, aqueous hydrogen peroxide solutions such as are obtained<br>
in the anthraquinone process for producing hydrogen peroxide.<br>
The process according to the invention for the epoxidation of olefins,<br>
preferably propene, is typically carried out at a temperature of 30° to<br>
80°C, preferably at 40° to 60°C. According to a particularly preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention a temperature profile within the<br>
reactor in maintained such that the cooling medium temperature of the<br>
cooling means, preferably the cooling liquid in the cooling jacket of<br>
the tubular reactor is at least 40°C and the maximum temperature within<br><br>
the catalyst bed is 60°C at the most. By selecting such a narrowly<br>
defined temperature profile within the reactor an optimized balance<br>
between hydrogen peroxide conversion and olefin oxide selectivity can be<br>
achieved.<br>
The pressure within the reactor is usually maintained at a pressure at<br>
or above the vapor pressure of the olefin at the selected temperature<br>
for example at 10 to 50 bar, preferably at 20 to 50, most preferred 21<br>
to 30 bar. With propene this translates to a pressure of at least 16.5<br>
bar at a reaction temperature of 40°C and at least 25 bar at a reaction<br>
temperature of 60°C.<br>
The olefin is preferably employed in excess relative to the hydrogen<br>
peroxide and in an amount sufficient to maintain a second liquid olefin<br>
rich phase during the reaction. The molar ratio of olefin, preferably<br>
propene, to hydrogen peroxide preferably being chosen in the range from<br>
1.1 to 30. The solvent is preferably added in a weight ratio of 0.5 to<br>
20 relative to the amount of hydrogen peroxide solution used. The<br>
amount of catalyst employed may be varied within wide limits and is<br>
preferably chosen so that a hydrogen peroxide consumption of more than<br>
90%. preferably more than 95?%. is achieved within 1 minute to 5 hours<br>
under the employed reaction conditions.<br>
The present invention will be explained in more detail referring to the<br>
following examples:<br>
Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Examples l<br>
A titanium-silicate catalyst was employed in all examples. The titanium-<br>
silicate powder was shaped into 2 mm extrudates using a silica sol as<br>
binder in accordance with example 5 in EP 00 106 671.1. The H2O2 employed<br><br>
was prepared according to the anthraquinone process as a 40 wt-% aqueous<br>
solution.<br>
Epoxidation is carried out continuously in down-flow operation mode in a<br>
reaction tube of 300 ml volume, a diameter of 10 mm and a length of 4 m.<br>
The reactor was additionally equipped with a sight glass located near<br>
the reactor outlet to allow visible verification whether two liquid<br>
phases were present as described above. The equipment is furthermore<br>
comprised of three containers for liquids and relevant pumps and a<br>
liquid separating vessel. The three containers for liquids comprised<br>
methanol, the 40% H2O2 and propene. The 40% H2O2 was adjusted with ammonia<br>
to a pH of 4.5. The reaction temperature was controlled via an aqueous<br>
cooling liquid circulating in a cooling jacket whereby the cooling<br>
liquid temperature is adjusted to 40°C by a thermostat. The reactor<br>
pressure was adjusted as indicated in Table 1. Mass flow of the feeding<br>
pumps was adjusted to result in a methanol flow of 0.2 kg/h. a H2O2 flow<br>
of 0.033 kg/h. The propene flow in example 1 and comparative example 1<br>
was adjusted to 0.0753 kg/h and to 0.125 kg/h in example 2.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
Comparative example 1 was repeated using reaction parameters as<br>
disclosed in Example 2 of W0 00/07965 and reported in Table 1.<br>
The product stream was analyzed by gas chromatography and the H2O2<br>
conversion was determined by titration. Propene selectivity was<br>
calculated as the ratio of the amount of propene oxide relative to the<br>
total amount of propene oxide and oxygen containing hydrocarbons formed<br>
during the epoxidation reaction such as l-methoxy-2-propanol, 2-methoxy-<br>
1-propanol and 1.2-propanediol. The results are given in Table 1.<br><br><br>
As can be seen from the experimental results conducting the epoxidation<br>
reaction in presence of two liquid phases according to the present<br>
invention results in an considerable increase in propene oxide<br>
selectivity without compromising hydrogen peroxide conversion compared<br>
to the prior art. Thus high propene oxide yields can be obtained with<br>
the process of the present invention.<br><br>
