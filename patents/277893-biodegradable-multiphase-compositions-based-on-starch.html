BIODEGRADABLE MULTIPHASE COMPOSITIONS BASED ON STARCH<br>
DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to biodegradable multiphase compositions based on starch, capable, particularly, of being transformed into flexible films with high modulus and at the same time provided with isotropy in the two longitudinal and transverse directions, in particular in relation to tear strength. Said films are particularly suitable for producing bags and wrappings capable of supporting heavy weights without severe deformations and without the occurrence of transverse fractures.<br>
The biodegradable multiphase compositions according to the present invention can also be transformed into many other different end products.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention arc water insoluble and not water dispersible according to the standard UNI 10956 or EN 14987.<br>
Tn  particular,   the  present   invention   relates   to  biodegradable   multiphase   compositions characterized by comprising tliree phases:<br>
A.	a continuous phase consisting of a matrix of at least one tough hydrophobic polymer<br>
incompatible with starch;<br>
B.	a homogeneously dispersed nanoparticulate starch phase with mean dimensions of less<br>
than 0.3 u.m, preferably less than 0.2 pm, and even more preferably less than 0.15 pm;<br>
C.	a further dispersed phase of at least one rigid and fragile polymer with modulus greater<br>
than 1000 MPa, preferably greater than 1500 MPa and even more preferably greater<br>
than 2000 MPa;<br>
and having:<br>
a Modulus greater than 300 MPa. preferably greater than 350 MPa, more preferably<br>
greater than 400 MPa and even more preferably greater than 450 MPa;<br>
a substantial isotropy in the two longitudinal and transverse directions in relation to tear<br>
propagation,<br>
particles of the dispersed starch phase (B) with mean dimensions of less than 0.3 j.im,<br>
preferably less than 0.25 urn, even more preferably less than 0.2 um and even more<br>
preferably less than 0.15 \im;<br>
a reduction in the dimensions and in the number of the typical lamellar structures of the<br>
dispersed phase (C). Such dimensions of the particles of the dispersed starch phase (B) and such reduction in the dimensions and in the number of the typical lamellar stnicturcs of the dispersed phase (C) arc obtained by processing the components of said compositions in an extruder, or other machine<br>
 <br>
capable of providing conditions of temperature and shear that determine such reduction in the<br>
dimensions of the particles and of the number of the typical lamellar structures.<br>
The dimensions of the particles of starch are measured in the transverse section with respect<br>
to the direction of the extrusion flow or, anyhow, with respect to the direction of output of the<br>
material.<br>
The dimension of a starch particle is therefore measured on the bidimensional shape resulting<br>
from the transverse section. The mean dimension of the starch particles is calculated as the<br>
numeral (or arithmetic) average of the dimension of the particles.<br>
In case of a spherical particle the dimension of the particle corresponds to the diameter of a<br>
circle.<br>
In case of a non-spherical particle the dimension (d) of the particle is calculated according to<br>
the following formula:<br>
where di is the minor diameter and d2 is the major diameter of the ellipse in which the particle can be inscribed or approximated.<br>
One drawback of the starch-based biodegradable bags currently present on the market is represented by the lack of uniformity of the mechanical properties, in particular tear strength, in the transverse and longitudinal directions. Shopping bags measuring 60 x 60 cm utilized by large-scale retailers are typically made of PE with thicknesses of around 18-20 urn. Nonetheless, at these thicknesses starch-based biodegradable films are still too yielding or too fragile to withstand certain limits of weight (i.e. 10 kg). These limits in performance are particularly apparent in conditions of low humidity,<br>
The aforesaid technical problem has now been solved by the biodegradable compositions based on starch according to the present invention, which, not having transverse displacement of the fracture when they are transformed into bags subjected to load, are particularly advantageous for producing thin films. In fact, the biodegradable compositions according to the mvcntion allow to manufacture bags with thickness in the order of 18-20 um, and even with thickness lower than 18 |.tm if needed from a practical application, namely with thickness comparable to that of bags made of medium/high density polyethylene. It is also possible to produce "loop-handle" bags with dimensions of approximately 70 x 70 cm and thickness of less than 40 urn, i.e. thickness below the thickness of LDPE loop-handle bags, which is in the order of 50 um. The present compositions are generally biodegradable according to the standard EN 13432. In particular, the materials according to the present invention comprise:<br>
 <br>
(A)	with regard to the hydrophobic matrix, at least one tough thermoplastic polymer incompatible with the starch, and in the continuous phase between 52 and 70% in weight, and more preferably between 55 and 70% in weight;<br>
(B)	with regard to the dispersed starch phase, at least one destructurized nanoparticulate starch in a percentage between 5 and 45% in weight, preferably between 10 and 42% in weight, more preferably between 15 and 38% in weight and even more preferably between 20 and 35%;<br>
(C)	with regard to the further dispersed phase, at least one rigid polymer between 3 and 25% in weight, preferably between 4 and 22% in weight and more preferably between 5 and 20% in weight.<br>
To obtain a material with rigidity and tenacity in the two transverse and longitudinal<br>
directions superior to the materials described in prior art, use is made of specific weight ratios<br>
of the various components, and to use a process in the extruder or any other machine, capable<br>
of providing temperature and shear conditions that allow reduction of the dispersed phases in<br>
very small particles. In particular, the lamellar structures typical of the phase (C) must be<br>
substantially reduced in dimension and possibly eliminated.<br>
In general, the most suitable extrusion systems are those that make use of laminating screws<br>
with a ratio between the maximum and minimum diameter of the screw of less than 1.6, and<br>
more preferably less than 1.4.<br>
With regard to the hydrophobic matrix, tough polyesters can be used, i.e., those characterized<br>
by Modulus of less than 200 MPa and ultimate elongation greater than 500%, such as the<br>
aliphatic aromatic polyesters from diacid/diol of the type described in EP 559 785 (Eastman),<br>
EP 792 309 (BASF) and WO 2006/097353 (Novamont). Within the limits indicated, aliphatic<br>
polyesters from diacid/diol of the type described in EP  1  117 738 arc also taken into<br>
consideration here.<br>
Polyesters in which the aliphatic acids are chosen from at least one of the following: succinic,<br>
adipic, azclaic, scbacic, undecandioic, dodecandioic, brassylic acid or mixtures thereof, arc<br>
particularly preferred.<br>
With     regard     to     the     hydrophobic     matrix,     biodegradable     polymers     such     as<br>
polyhydroxyalkanoates, polyeters and polyamides can also be used.<br>
During the polymer synthesis process various additives such as polycarbodiimides, poiyepoxy<br>
resins,  peroxides and oxazolines can  be  added.  Particularly  poiyepoxy resins  can  be<br>
advantageously added as additives in order to stabilize the final multiphase composition<br>
against hydrolysis. Particularly preferred are resins of the glycidyl type. Still more preferred is<br>
 <br>
BADGE (bisphenol A diglycidyl ether).<br>
With regard to the starch phase, all native starches, such as potato, corn, tapioca, pea, rice, wheat and also high-amylose starch - preierably containing more than 30% by weight of amylose - and waxy starches, can be used.<br>
Starches such as corn and potato starch, capable of being easily destructurizable and which have high initial molecular weights, have proven to be particularly advantageous. The use of corn and potato starch is particularly preferred.<br>
For destructurized starch the teachings contained in EP 0 118 240 and EP 0 327 505 are referred to here, this being intended as starch processed so that it substantially has no "Maltese crosses" under the optical microscope in polarized light and no "ghosts" under" the optical microscope in phase contrast.<br>
Furthermore, physically and chemically modified starch grades can be in part used, such as ethoxylated starches, oxypropylated starches, starch acetates, starch butyrate, starch propionates, with a substitution degree comprised within the range of from 0.1 to 2, cationic starches, oxidized starches, crosslinked starches, gelled starches.<br>
Finally, with regard to the further dispersed phase of a rigid polymer, polyhydroxyalkanoates with modulus greater than 1000 MPa can be used, such as polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid. Particularly preferred are polymers or copolymers of polylactic acid containing at least 75% of L-lactic or D- lactic acid or combinations thereof, with molecular weight Mw greater than 70,000 and with a modulus greater than J,500 MPa. These polymers can also be plasticized.<br>
In the formation phase of the multiphase structure of the present biodegradable compositions there must be at least one plasticizer for the starch to provide suitable rheological properties and minimize the dimensions of the starch phase. This plasticizer can simply be water (even the water contained in the native starch alone without the need for further additions), or self-boiling or polymer plasticizers. The quantity of plasticizer is as a rule chosen on the basis of rheological needs and of the mixing system.<br>
In any case, plasticizers can be added in a quantity of less than 10% in relation to the components (A + B + C). Besides water, plasticizers that can be utilized in the compositions according to the invention arc, for example, those described in WO 92/14782, with glycerol as the particularly preferred plasticizer.<br>
In the present biodegradable compositions various additives can also be incorporated, such as antioxidants, UV stabilizers, heat and hydrolysis stabilizers, chain extenders, flame retardants, slow release agents, inorganic and organic fillers, such as natural fibres, antistatic agents,<br>
 <br>
wetting agents, colorants, lubricants or compatibilizing agents among the various phases. Examples of hydrolysis stabilizers arc polycarbodiimidcs and cpoxy resins. Among polycarbodiimides particularly preferred are aliphatic polycarbodiimides. Among epoxy resins particuiariy preferred are epoxidized poiymethacrylates, in particular of the glycidyl type. The most preferred is a poly epoxy propyl methacrylate. Example of chain extenders are peroxides.  Among peroxides particularly preferred are organic peroxides.<br>
ThanJcs to the dispersed nanoparticuiate starch phase, the biodegradable multiphase compositions according to the invention are particularly suitable for being transformed into flexible films with high modulus and at the .same time provided with isotropy in the two longitudinal and transverse directions, in particular in relation to tear strength. Said films are particularly suitable for producing bags and wrappings capable of supporting heavy weights without severe deformations and without the occurrence of transverse fractures. The films obtained from the biodegradable multiphase composition according to the invention can also be used to make sacks and bags for carrying goods, film and bags for food packaging, stretchable, heat-shrinkable film, film for adhesive tape, for disposable nappy tapes and for decorative coloured tapes. Some other main applications are for silage, for breathable bags for fruit and vegetables, bags for bread and other food products, film for covering packs of meats, cheese and other food items and yoghurt pots.<br>
Due to their properties, the biodegradable multiphase compositions according to the invention can also find application in the field of textiles and non-woven fabric for clothing, co-extruded fibers and spun bonded, hygiene and industrial products, and also for fishing nets or nets fruit and vegetables.<br>
The fine microstructurc can be useful also for injection molded, foamed and extruded products with a need of high toughness. Moreover this type of material can be used in co-extruded multilayer films, laminated products where the supports can be either other plastic films/sheets or paper, aluminium or their combinations.<br>
The present invention is now illustrated with reference to some non-limiting examples thereof.<br>
