				<td>COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR TREATING DISEASES OF THE NAIL<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention pertains to the field of treatment of<br>
diseases of the nail and nail bed. In particular, the<br>
invention pertains to methods for treatment of disorders such<br>
as onychomycosis or psoriasis involving the nails.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Onychomycosis, a fungal disease of the nail unit<br>
caused by yeasts, dermatophytes, or other molds, accounts for<br>
approximately 50% of all nail disorders in humans. In about<br>
80% of onychomycosis cases, the toenails are infected, whereas<br>
in the remaining 20%, the fingernails are infected. The<br>
symptoms of this disease include split, thickened, hardened,<br>
and rough nail plates.<br>
Another common disorder of nails is nail psoriasis,<br>
which affects up to 50% of patients with psoriasis.<br>
Characteristic nail psoriasis symptoms include pitting, which<br>
appears as punctuated or irregularly shaped depressions<br>
arranged on the surface of the body of the nail; discoloration<br>
of the nail bed; onycholysis or detachment of the body of the<br>
nail from the nail bed; subungual keratosis; or anomalies of<br>
the body of the nail. Other diseases and disorders involving<br>
the nails in humans and in other animals include onychia,<br>
onychocryptosis, onychodystrophy, onychogryposis, onycholysis,<br>
onychomadesis, onychophosis, onychoptosis, paronychia,<br>
koilonychia, subungual hematoma, and laminitis.<br>
The nail plate is thick, hard, and dense, and<br>
represents a formidable barrier to drug penetration. Although<br>
nail material is similar in various ways to the stratum<br>
corneum of the skin, the nail is composed primarily of hard<br>
keratin which is highly disulfide-linked and is approximately<br>
100-fold thicker than stratum corneum.<br>
Various topical therapies have been suggested for<br>
treatment of nail disorders, such as onychomycosis. Nail<br>
lacquers, coating, polishes, enamels, and varnishes have been<br>
described. Bonn, U.S. Pat. No. 4.957,730, describes a nail<br>
varnish containing a water-insoluble film-forming substance<br>
and antimycotic compound. Ferro, U.S. Pat. No. 5,120,530,<br>
describes an antimycotic nail varnish containing amorolfine in<br>
quaternary ammonium acrylic copolymer. The water-insoluble<br>
film former is a copolymerizate of acrylic acid esters and<br>
methacrylic acid esters having a low content of quaternary<br>
ammonium groups. Bohn, U.S. Pat. No. 5,264,206, describes a<br>
nail lacquer with antimycotic activity, which contains an<br>
antimycotic agent and water-insoluble film formers including<br>
polyvinyl acetate, a copolymer of polyvinyl acetate and<br>
acrylic acid, copolymers of vinyl acetate and crotonic acid.<br>
Wohlrab, U.S. Pat. No. 5,346,692, describes a nail lacquer for<br>
treating onychomycosis, comprised of a film-forming agent, an<br>
antimycotically active substance, and urea, wherewith the<br>
antimycotic agent and urea are liberated from the lacquer when<br>
the lacquer is applied. A preferred formulation comprises<br>
cellulose derivatives as film former, clotrimazole as the<br>
antimycotic agent, .dibutyl phthalate as a plasticizer, and a<br>
mixture of acetone and ethanol as solvent. Nimni, U.S. Pat.<br>
No 5,487,776, describes a nail lacquer composition which forms<br>
a water permeable film containing griseofulvin when the<br>
organic solvent system evaporates, wherein a portion of the<br>
griseofulvin is in solution and a portion of griseofulvin is<br>
present as a colloidal suspension. Chaudhuri, U.S. Pat. No.<br>
6,143,794, describes a topical formulation for the treatment<br>
of nail fungal infections that includes an antifungal,<br>
solvent, gelling agent, adhesion-promoting agent, film-forming<br>
agent, surfactant, and optionally a keratolytic agent. The<br>
adhesion-promoting agent was a hydroxy-terminated polyurethane<br>
such as polyolprepolymer-2. All of these patents and<br>
publications describe products applied to the nail that form a<br>
substantive nail coating or film containing a drug from which<br>
the drug is to penetrate into the nail. None of these methods<br>
has proven to be consistently effective in treating disorders<br>
of the nail such as onychomycosis.<br>
Various topical therapies utilizing chemical<br>
compounds disclosed to enhance penetration through the nail<br>
have been described. Knowles, U.S. Pat. No. 5,652,256,<br>
describes the use of methyl acetate as a penetration enhancing<br>
compound in combination with naftifine or sulconazole and<br>
haftifine as a topical gel for fungal treatment of the nails.<br>
Sorenson, U.S. Pat. No. 5,972,317, discloses that a<br>
proteolytic enzyme such as papain, delivered by pads soaked in<br>
the enzyme solution, produces a more permeable nail. Sun,<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,231,875, describes acidified compositions of<br>
antifungals to enhance transport across nails and skin.<br>
Reeves, U.S. Pat. No. 6,391,879, describes the combination of<br>
an anti-fungal agent dissolved in an anhydrous blend of<br>
polyglycol and DMSO. Although these and other enhanced<br>
penetration formulations were reported to increase penetration<br>
through the nail, they have not been shown to be clinically<br>
effective in treating conditions of the nail, such as<br>
onychomycosis.<br>
Because of the difficulty in obtaining clinically<br>
effective concentrations of medication to the nail bed by<br>
topical application of a pharmaceutical composition to the<br>
affected nail, nail disorders, such as onychomycosis, are<br>
typically treated with systemic medications or with topical<br>
medications following removal of the nail. Systemic treatment<br>
for onychomycosis and other nail disorders is often not<br>
satisfactory because therapy must be continued for long<br>
periods of time, often many weeks or months, and the<br>
medication has effects on tissues other than on the affected<br>
nail. Antifungal compounds, such as miconazole and<br>
ketoconazole, have been demonstrated to be effective in<br>
topically treating onychomycosis after nail removal. However,<br>
it is clear that removal of the nail is a measure than most<br>
individuals suffering from onychomycosis would prefer not to<br>
undergo if a less drastic therapeutic method would be<br>
efficacious.<br>
Pitre, U.S. Patent Publication 2007/0041910, filed<br>
as U.S. Patent Application No. 11/432,410; and Mallard, U.S.<br>
Patent Publication 2006/0147383, filed as U.S. Patent<br>
Application No. 11/315,259, disclose that application of a<br>
pharmaceutical composition containing a vehicle, a volatile<br>
silicone, and a non-volatile oily phase, provides increased<br>
penetration of a pharmaceutically active compound when<br>
topically to skin or mucous membrane. This enhanced<br>
penetration is obtained without the use of glycols, such as<br>
propylene glycol, which are known to augment skin penetration<br>
of pharmaceutical compounds but which are also known to be<br>
irritating to skin. The formulations of Pitre and Mallard<br>
contain at least 25% w/w of a volatile silicone and, if<br>
formulated with an alcoholic vehicle, contain at least 15% of<br>
alcohol. All alcoholic compositions disclosed in Pitre and<br>
Mallard contain greater than 50% volatile silicone and the<br>
concentration of the volatile silicone is at least twice the<br>
concentration of the alcohol in the composition.<br>
Pitre and Mallard do not disclose or suggest the use<br>
of such compositions for the treatment of diseases of a nail,<br>
such as onychomycosis. Moreover, studies have been conducted,<br>
including studies conducted in the laboratories of the present<br>
inventors, that show that the penetrating ability of an active<br>
agent from a composition into skin cannot be correlated to the<br>
penetrating ability of the active agent from the composition<br>
into or through a nail.<br>
A significant need remains for a pharmaceutical<br>
composition that provides for enhanced penetration of a<br>
pharmaceutical agent contained within the composition into and<br>
through an intact nail. Such a composition would be valuable<br>
for topically treating conditions affecting the nail or nail<br>
bed, such as onychomycosis.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>

of KP-103 through skin from a formulation of the invention and<br>
from three prior art formulations.<br>
Figure 2 is a graph showing the in vitro penetration<br>

invention and from three prior art formulations.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
It has been unexpectedly discovered that a<br>
pharmaceutical composition containing an active pharmaceutical<br>
ingredient (API), a solvent, referred to herein as the<br>
"vehicle" or the "volatile vehicle", a wetting agent which<br>
may or may not be the same compound as the vehicle, and a non-<br>
volatile solvent which has limited water miscibility provides<br>
enhanced penetration of the API into and through an intact<br>
nail. Preferably, the composition of the invention is free of<br>
film forming polymeric compounds. It is conceived that such<br>
compositions may be used to deliver an API in order to treat<br>
medical conditions involving the nail and/or the underlying<br>
nail bed.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention is a pharmaceutical<br>
composition for the treatment of disorders of the nail or nail<br>
bed. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention contains<br>
a volatile and/or penetrating vehicle, a non-volatile solvent<br>
that is dissolved, suspended, dispersed, or emulsified within<br>
the vehicle, an API that is soluble in the non-volatile<br>
solvent and/or a mixture of the vehicle and the non-volatile<br>
solvent and is optionally soluble in the vehicle, and a<br>
wetting agent, which may or may not be the vehicle itself.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention is a<br>
pharmaceutical formulation for delivery of an API to the nail<br>
or nail bed in order to treat disorders of this area.<br>
According to this embodiment, the formulation contains a<br>
volatile and/or penetrating vehicle, a non-volatile solvent<br>
that is dissolved, suspended, dispersed, or emulsified within<br>
the vehicle, and a wetting agent, which may or may not be the<br>
vehicle itself. The API that is to be used with the<br>
formulation of the invention is one that is soluble in the<br>
non-volatile solvent and/or a mixture of the vehicle and the<br>
non-volatile solvent and is optionally soluble in the vehicle<br>
alone.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention is a method for<br>
treating a disorder of the nail or nail bed. According to<br>
this embodiment of the invention, a pharmaceutical composition<br>
containing a volatile and/or penetrating vehicle, a non-<br>
volatile solvent that is dissolved, suspended, dispersed, or<br>
emulsified within the vehicle, an API that is soluble in the<br>
non-volatile solvent and/or a mixture of the vehicle and the<br>
non-volatile solvent and is optionally soluble in the vehicle<br>
alone, and a wetting agent, which may or may not be the<br>
vehicle itself, is topically applied to the surface of a nail<br>
that is suffering from a disorder in an amount and for a time<br>
sufficient to ameliorate the symptoms of the disorder.<br>
As used herein, the term "volatile" when referring<br>
to the vehicle means that the vehicle is a compound that<br>
evaporates from the surface of the nail when applied. Volatile<br>
vehicles are compounds which have a measurable vapor pressure,<br>
and preferably are compounds that have a vapor pressure of<br>
greater than 100 Pa at room temperature. Examples of volatile<br>
vehicles include: acetone, 2-amino-2-methyl-l-propanol, 1,<br>
2-butanediol, 1, 4-butanediol, 2-butanol, cyclomethicone-4,<br>
cyclomethicone-5, cyclomethicone-6, ethanol, ethyl acetate,<br>
n-heptane, isobutanol, isopropyl alcohol, 1-propanol and<br>
2-propanol.<br>
As used herein, the term "penetrating" when<br>
referring to the vehicle means that the vehicle is a compound<br>
that rapidly penetrates into a nail when applied to the<br>
surface of the nail so that, after 10 minutes following the<br>
application of a thin layer of the vehicle onto the surface of<br>
a nail, no more than 10% of the applied amount remains on the<br>
nail surface. The term "penetrating" thus includes both<br>
volatile and non-volatile vehicles.<br>
Examples of pharmaceutical compositions that may be<br>
used in the method of the present invention are disclosed in<br>
Pitre, U.S. Patent Application No. 11/432,410; and in Mallard,<br>
U.S. Patent Application 11/315,259, which applications are<br>
incorporated herein in their entirety. In accordance with the<br>
present invention, the pharmaceutical compositions of Pitre<br>
and Mallard that may be used to treat medical conditions of<br>
the nail in accordance with the present invention may contain<br>
Vitamin D as the API as disclosed in Pitre or clobetasol as<br>
disclosed in Mallard, or may contain other APIs in place of,<br>
or in addition to, these APIs, as disclosed herein.<br>
The API of the composition of the invention is one<br>
that is useful in the treatment of a disorder of the nail or<br>
nail bed. The API is soluble in the solvent of the<br>
composition and/or in the combination of the solvent and<br>
vehicle of the composition. Examples of suitable APIs include<br>
anti-inflammatory agents, antimicrobial agents such as<br>
antibiotics and antifungal agents, anesthetic agents,<br>
steroidal agents, vitamins and derivatives thereof, anti-<br>
psoriatic drugs, and analgesic agents.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the API of the<br>
composition of the invention is an antifungal chemical<br>
compound, particularly those effective in the treatment of<br>
onychomycosis. Examples of suitable antifungal agents include<br>
polyene antimycotic agents such as natamycin, rimocidin,<br>
filipin, nystatin, and amphotericin B; imidazole compounds<br>
such as miconazole, ketoconazole, clotrimazole, econazole,<br>
bifonazole, butoconazole, fenticonazole, isoconazole,<br>
oxiconazole, sertaconazole, suconazole, and tioconazole;<br>
triazole compounds such as fluconazole, itraconazole,<br>
ravuconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, (2R,3R)-2-(2,4-<br>
difluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylenepiperidine-l-yl)-1-(1H-1,2,4-<br>
triazole-l-yl)butane-2-ol (referred to herein as "KP-103"),<br>
and terconazole; allylamine compounds such as terbinafine,<br>
amorolfine, naftifine, and butenafine; echinocandin compounds<br>
such as anidulafungin, caspfungin, and micafungin; and other<br>
antifungal drugs such as ciclopirox, flucytosine,<br>
griseofulvin, gentian violet, haloprogin, tolnaftate, and<br>
undecylenic acid. Any antifungal compound suitable for<br>
pharmaceutical use in humans or mammals, and particularly<br>
those which are active in vitro against Candida albicans,<br>
Trichophyton rubrum or Trichophyton mentagrophytes, is<br>
suitable for the API of the invention. Particularly preferred<br>
are antifungal APIs that have relatively low binding to<br>
keratin, such as triazole compounds like KP-103.<br>
Other APIs that are suitable for the composition of<br>
the invention include those that are effective in treating<br>
diseases and disorders of nails other than onychomycosis,<br>
especially those diseases and disorders affecting tissues deep<br>
to the external surface of the nail, such as the internal<br>
portion of the nail, the deep nail surface adjacent to the<br>
nail bed, and the nail bed. Such diseases and disorders may<br>
include onychia, onychocryptosis, onychodystrophy,<br>
onychogryposis,.onycholysis, onychomadesis, onychophosis,<br>
onychoptosis, paronychia, koilonychia, subungual hematoma, and<br>
laminitis.<br>
The vehicle of the composition of the invention is a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle in which the constituents<br>
of the composition of the invention can be dissolved,<br>
suspended, disbursed, or emulsified. The constituents of the<br>
composition may be all within a single phase in the vehicle.<br>
For example, the API, wetting agent, and the non-volatile<br>
phase may be dissolved in the vehicle. Alternatively, the<br>
constituents may occupy separate phases within the vehicle.<br>
For example, the API may be dissolved in the vehicle and the<br>
other constituents may be suspended, dispersed, or emulsified<br>
in solvent. For another'example, the API may be dissolved in<br>
the solvent which is suspended, dispersed, or emulsified in<br>
the vehicles, with the remaining constituents being dissolved<br>
in either the vehicle or the solvent. Preferably, but not<br>
necessarily, the API, wetting agent, and non-volatile phase<br>
are all miscible in the vehicle.<br>
Examples of suitable vehicles include one or more of<br>
water, alcohols, polyols, ethers, esters, aldehydes, ketones,<br>
fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and fatty esters. Specific<br>
examples of suitable vehicles include ethanol; 3-propanediol;<br>
1, 2-butanediol; 1,2,3-propanetriol;1, 3-butanediol; 1, 4-<br>
butanediol; isopropyl alcohol; and<br>
2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
vehicle is an alcohol, and most preferably a linear or<br>
branched aliphatic lower alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol,<br>
propanol, or isopropanol.<br>
The wetting agent of the composition of the<br>
invention is a chemical compound that reduces the surface<br>
tension of liquid compositions and that does not build<br>
viscosity. The wetting agent may be a surfactant, which may<br>
be anionic, cationic, or non-ionic.<br>
Preferably, the wetting agent is a volatile<br>
silicone. Such volatile silicones include linear or cyclic<br>
polyorganosiloxane compounds of formula [R1SiOR2]n wherein n =<br>
6 or less and R1 and R2 are alkyl groups that may be the same<br>
or different, and which compound has a measurable vapor<br>
pressure under ambient conditions. Preferably, n = from 3 to<br>
6, and most preferably n = 4 or 5. Preferably R1 and R2 =<br>
methyl.<br>
Examples of cyclic volatile silicones include<br>
polydimethylcyclosiloxanes, generally known as<br>
cyclomethicones. Particular examples of cyclic volatile<br>
silicones include cyclopentasiloxane, cyclotetrasiloxane,<br>
decylmethylcyclopentasiloxane, and<br>
octylmethylcyclotetrasiloxane. Examples of linear volatile<br>
silicones include linear polysiloxanes. Particular examples of<br>
linear volatile silicones include hexamethyldisiloxane,<br>
octamethyltrisiloxane, and dimethicones.<br>
In one particular embodiment of the invention, a<br>
single compound forms both the vehicle and the wetting agent<br>
of the composition. For example, the vehicle may be a<br>
volatile silicone. In this situation, the volatile silicone<br>
may also be the wetting agent of the composition. In the case<br>
in which the wetting agent serves also as the vehicle, the<br>
concentration of the wetting agent in the composition is<br>
sufficiently high to function as a vehicle in which all other<br>
components of the composition are dissolved, suspended,<br>
dispersed, or emulsified.<br>
The non-volatile solvent of the composition is a<br>
non-aqueous solvent that may or may not be soluble or miscible<br>
in the vehicle of the composition. The API of the composition<br>
is preferably, but not necessarily, soluble in the non-<br>
volatile solvent. In a preferred embodiment wherein the API<br>
is hydrophilic, the non-volatile solvent is a polar or semi-<br>
polar molecule. In another preferred embodiment wherein the<br>
API is hydrophobic, the non-volatile solvent is non-polar.<br>
Suitable non-volatile solvents for hydrophobic drugs<br>
are disclosed in Pitre, U.S. Patent Application No. 11/432,410<br>
in paragraphs 0069 to 0082, which paragraphs are incorporated<br>
herein by reference. For example, the non-volatile solvent<br>
may be an ester of the formula RCO-OR', wherein R and R' may<br>
be identical or different and each of R and R' represents a<br>
linear or branched chain of an alkyl, alkenyl,<br>
alkoxycarbonylalkyl, or alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl radical having<br>
from 1 to 25 carbon atoms, preferably from 4 to 20 carbon<br>
atoms. The non-volatile solvent may be a glyceryl ester of a<br>
fatty acid, such as fatty esters of natural fatty acids or<br>
triglycerides of animal or plant origin. The non-volatile<br>
solvent may be a fatty acid glyceride, including synthetic or<br>
semi-synthetic glyceryl esters, such as fatty acid mono-, di-,<br>
or triglycerides, which are oils or fats. The non-volatile<br>
solvent may be a non-volatile hydrocarbon, such as paraffins,<br>
isoparaffins, and mineral oil. The non-volatile solvent may<br>
be a guerbet ester. The non-volatile solvent may be a non-<br>
volatile silicone, provided that the presence of the non-<br>
volatile silicone in the composition does not result in the<br>
formation of a hard polymeric film upon application of the<br>
composition onto a nail. Included within such non-film<br>
forming silicones are polyorganosiloxane compounds that have<br>
the formula [R1SiOR2]n wherein n &gt; 6 and R1 and R2 are alkyl<br>
groups that may be the same or different, and which compound<br>
may or may not have a measurable vapor pressure under ambient<br>
conditions.<br>
Other examples of suitable non-volatile solvents for<br>
hydrophobic drugs in addition to those disclosed in Pitre<br>
include squalane, dibutyl sebacate, isopropyl laurate,<br>
isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, isopropyl strearate,<br>
myristyl alcohol, oleyl alcohol, oleic acid, lauryl lactate,<br>
myristyl lactate, mixed C12-15 alkyl lactates, diisopropyl<br>
adipate, octyldodecanol, caproic acid, caprylic acid, capric<br>
acid, lauryl benzoate, myristyl benzoate, mixed C12 15 alkyl<br>
benzoates, benzyl benzoate, tridecyl neopentanoate,<br>
spermaceti, petrolatum, and alpha terpineol. Examples of<br>
suitable non-volatile solvents for hydrophilic drugs include<br>
diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, n-methyl pyrrolidone,<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide, ethyl lactate, hexylene glycol, glycerol,<br>
benzyl alcohol and glycerol triacetate.<br>
The composition of the invention may contain<br>
additional optional components, such as wetting agents,<br>
preservatives, stabilizers, lubricants, humectants, moisture<br>
regulators, foaming agents, binders, pH regulators, osmotic<br>
pressure modifiers, emulsifiers, antioxidants, colors,<br>
fragrances, or odor maskers. If desired, the composition may<br>
also contain additional nail modifiers or penetration<br>
enhancers, such as urea, propylene glycol, sodium lauryl<br>
sulfate, and glycolic acid.<br>
The composition is intended to remain in a liquid or<br>
semi-solid state after application to the nail and does not<br>
form a hard lacquer, shell, or film on the nail following<br>
application, which occurs by a process of solvent casting<br>
following evaporation of a volatile solvent which leaves<br>
behind a solid residue that forms the lacquer, shell or film.<br>
Therefore, it is preferred that the components of the<br>
composition are miscible in the composition and also are<br>
miscible in the "secondary" composition that remains after the<br>
volatile vehicle has evaporated or penetrated the nail. It is<br>
also suitable for the components of the composition, other<br>
than the vehicle, to be suspendible, dispersible, or<br>
emulsifiable, in the secondary composition, such as in the<br>
non-volatile solvent.<br>
The composition of the invention may be prepared in<br>
any number of forms, such as ointments, creams, milks, salves,<br>
impregnated pads, solutions, tinctures, liniments, liquids,<br>
sprays, foams, suspensions, lotions, or patches. The<br>
composition may be formulated to provide for immediate or<br>
controlled release of the API from the composition.<br>
The concentration of the various essential and<br>
optional components of the composition of the invention will<br>
vary, depending on the particular components contained in the<br>
composition, the form of the composition, the particular<br>
disease or condition that is to be treated with the<br>
composition, and whether the formulation is for immediate or<br>
for controlled release.<br>
The API of the composition is at a concentration<br>
that is effective to treat a disorder or disease of the nail<br>
or nail bed. Typically, the concentration of the API will<br>
constitute between 0.0001 to 30% or higher by weight of the<br>
composition.<br>
The concentration of the wetting agent in the<br>
composition may vary depending on several factors, including<br>
the identity of the wetting agent and whether the wetting<br>
agent is also the vehicle of the composition. Generally, the<br>
concentration of the wetting agent, such as a volatile<br>
silicone, will be between .001% to 95% by weight of the<br>
composition. Preferably, the concentration of the wetting<br>
agent is between 5% and 80%, more preferably between 7% and<br>
60%, and most preferably between 10% and 40% w/w of the<br>
composition. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the<br>
concentration of wetting agent in the composition is between<br>
10% and 15% w/w. In the case where the wetting agent is not<br>
functioning as a vehicle of the composition, the concentration<br>
of wetting agent in the composition will generally be towards<br>
the lower end of the above range of concentration, such as<br>
between 0.001% and 10%.<br>
The concentration of the non-volatile solvent will<br>
constitute between 5 and 90% w/w of the composition.<br>
Generally, with less viscous forms of the compositions, lower<br>
concentrations of non-volatile phase will be present, and with<br>
more viscous forms, higher concentrations of the non-volatile<br>
phase will be used. Also, ointment and other predominately<br>
oil-based compositions tend to have a higher concentration of<br>
non-volatile phase or components than do compositions such as<br>
sprays, gels, and lotions and so will have a higher<br>
concentration of a non-volatile solvent. Typical<br>
concentrations of non-volatile solvent are between 10 and 80%,<br>
with preferred concentrations being between 12 and 60%, and<br>
most preferred concentrations between 15 and 50% w/w.<br>
The concentration of the vehicle will be that which<br>
is sufficient to dissolve, suspend, disperse, or emulsify the<br>
other components of the composition. In many but not all<br>
cases, the concentration of the vehicle will be higher than<br>
that of any other constituent of the composition. In some<br>
cases, the concentration of the vehicle will be higher than<br>
that of the combined concentration of the other constituents<br>
of the composition. In a preferred embodiment in which the<br>
vehicle is an alcohol, the composition will contain at least<br>
10% alcohol, more typically at least 15% alcohol, and most<br>
typically at least 25% alcohol. The concentration of alcohol<br>
in the composition may be as high as 80%, or higher. In one<br>
preferred embodiment, the concentration of alcohol is at least<br>
50% w/w of the composition.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the composition of the invention is an alcoholic<br>
composition containing a volatile silicone. In a first<br>
preferred embodiment, the ratio of alcohol to volatile<br>
silicone in the composition % w/w is at least 2:3, preferably<br>
at least 1:1, more preferably at least 2:1, and most<br>
preferably at least 3:1. In a second preferred embodiment,<br>
the concentration of the volatile silicone in the composition<br>
is less than 25% w/w. In a third preferred embodiment, the<br>
concentration of the alcohol in the composition is at least<br>
40%, more preferably at least 45%, and most preferably at<br>
least 50% w/w. The composition of the invention, according to<br>
this embodiment of the invention, may be made so as to<br>
encompass any one, two, or all three of the embodiments<br>
described above. It has been determined that, when applied to<br>
the surface of a nail, the alcoholic composition of the<br>
invention containing a volatile silicone provides a high<br>
degree of penetration of an API contained therein into the<br>
nail.<br>
Although the compositions of the invention may be<br>
used to treat various diseases and disorders of the skin or<br>
mucous membranes, they are most advantageously used to treat<br>
conditions involving the nails of the hands or feet. The<br>
compositions and methods of the invention provide increased<br>
penetration of API in the composition into and through the<br>
nail and to the nail bed. The compositions of the invention<br>
may be used effectively to treat diseases and disorders in<br>
humans or in other animals, such as cats, dogs, horses,<br>
cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and birds. In human and in<br>
veterinary patients, the compositions of the invention may be<br>
used, depending on the particular animal treated, to treat<br>
conditions involving nails, hooves, horns, or beaks.<br>
The compositions of the invention are especially<br>
well suited for the treatment of onychomycosis and other<br>
disorders of the nail and nail bed. The composition is<br>
topically applied to the surface of the nail and surrounding<br>
tissue by any means by which the composition may be applied.<br>
The method of application may vary depending on the physical<br>
state of the composition, whether it is in a liquid,<br>
semisolid, or solid form, and on the viscosity of the<br>
composition if it is a liquid. Thus, for example, the<br>
composition may be rubbed, painted, dabbed, dripped, sprayed,<br>
wiped, spread, or poured onto the affected nail and<br>
surrounding tissues, or utilized as a soak. Frequency of<br>
treatment and duration of therapy will very depending on<br>
several factors, including the condition that is being<br>
treated, the identity and concentration of the API in the<br>
composition, and constituents of the composition other than<br>
the API. Typically, the frequency of treatment will be twice<br>
daily to once weekly, and preferably once daily.<br>
To further illustrate the invention, the following<br>
examples are provided. It is to be understood that these<br>
examples are provided for illustrative purposes and are not to<br>
be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1 - Skin Penetration Study<br>
Four different formulations were tested to determine<br>
the penetrability of an API into skin. The formulations each<br>
contained 5.00% w/w of a triazole antifungal API compound, KP-<br>
103. The compositions of the four formulations are shown in<br>
Table 1. All concentrations of the components of the<br>
formulations are in % w/w.<br>
Each of the formulations of Table 1 were spiked with<br>
tracer amounts of radiolabeled KP-103 at approximately 0.90<br>
uCi/dose. A single clinically relevant dose (5 mg/cm2) was<br>
applied to dermatomed human skin obtained from one donor<br>
following elective surgery.<br>
Percutaneous absorption was evaluated by mounting<br>
the dermatomed tissue in Bronaugh flow-through diffusion cells<br>
at 32 C. Six replicates were performed for each formulation.<br>
Fresh receptor fluid, PBS containing 0.1% w/v sodium azide and<br>
1.5% Oleth-20, was continuously pumped under the skin at a<br>
nominal flow rate of 1 ml/hr and collected in 6-hour<br>
intervals. Following 24-hours of exposure, the residual<br>
formulation remaining on the skin surface was removed by<br>
repeated tape stripping (5 strips/cell). Subsequently, the<br>
epidermis was physically separated from the dermis by gentle<br>
peeling. The quantity of radioactivity in the tape-strips,<br>
epidermis, dermis, and receptor fluid samples was determined<br>
using liquid scintillation counting. The results for the<br>
calculated quantity of API collected in the receptor for each<br>
of the formulations of Table 1 are shown in Figure 1.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, Formulations 080 and 107<br>
demonstrated considerably higher skin penetration than did<br>
Formulations 078 and 082. Formulation 080 contains propylene<br>
glycol, a known skin-penetration enhancer, and exhibited a<br>
higher penetration through skin than any of the other<br>
formulations. Formulation 107 contains urea, a known skin-<br>
penetration enhancer, and exhibited the second highest skin<br>
penetration of the four formulations tested. Formulation 082<br>
is a formulation according to the present invention and<br>
exhibited the lowest skin penetration of the tested<br>
formulations. Formulation 078 is a composition that is not<br>
within the scope of the invention and exhibited slightly<br>
higher penetration into and through skin than did Formulation<br>
082. Of the four formulations, the formulation with the<br>
lowest level of skin penetration was formulation 082, the only<br>
formulation of the four that is a composition of the<br>
invention.<br>
Example 2 - Nail Penetration Study<br>
The formulations 078, 080, 082, and 107 of Example 1<br>
were tested to determine penetration of the API from the<br>
formulation into and through nail plates. Each of the<br>
formulations of Table 1 was spiked with tracer amounts of<br>
radiolabeled KP-103 at approximately 0.90 uCi/dose. A<br>
clinically relevant protocol was followed, which entailed<br>
dosing 10 uL/cm2 per day for 14 days onto healthy human finger<br>
nail plates, which were obtained from multiple donors.<br>
Nail penetration was evaluated by mounting the<br>
finger nail plates into custom diffusion cells. Five<br>
replicates were performed for each formulation. A small<br>
cotton ball wetted with 0.1 mL normal saline was used as a<br>
receptor. For each day of the study, the surface of the nail<br>
was washed, and 10 uL of formulation was applied to the<br>
surface. Every second day, the cotton ball receptor was<br>
replaced. After fourteen days of exposure, the nail plate was<br>
sectioned into three sections, a central dorsal (upper)<br>
section, central ventral (lower) section and the remaining<br>
peripheral material. The quantity of radioactivity in the<br>
daily surface washes, cotton ball receptors, dorsal nail,<br>
ventral nail and peripheral nail was determined using liquid<br>
scintillation counting.<br>
The results are shown in Figure 2. As shown in<br>
Figure 2, the formulation of the invention, Formulation 082,<br>
provided over 6 times the penetration through the nail and<br>
into the saturated cotton ball receptor than did the other<br>
formulations, calculated as a percentage of the applied dose.<br>
The penetration of Formulations 080 and 107 had been expected<br>
to be highest through nail because they had exhibited a<br>
significantly higher penetration through skin. However, the<br>
penetration of API from Formulations 080 and 107 was, in fact,<br>
lower than from the other formulations even though these<br>
Formulations 080 and 107 contained well known skin penetration<br>
enhancers. This study establishes that the penetration of API<br>
from a formulation through skin is not predictive of the<br>
penetration of the API from the formulation through nail<br>
tissue. This study further establishes the unexpected ability<br>
of a preferred formulation of the invention, Formulation 082,<br>
to increase the penetration of API within the formulation<br>
through nail tissue.<br>
Example 3 - Clinical Assessment in Animal Model of<br>
Onychomycosis<br>
The efficacy of a formulation of the invention,<br>
Formulation 087, containing 3.00% w/w of a triazole antifungal<br>
API, KP-103, was evaluated in an animal model of onychomycosis<br>
and, in two separate studies, was compared with that of<br>
several commercial products intended for the treatment of<br>
onychomycosis. The composition of Formulation 087 is shown in<br>
Table 2.<br><br>
In order to test the efficacy of Formulation 087 and<br>
the comparison products, onychomycosis was induced in six-week<br>
old Hartley guinea pigs. Each of Formulation 087 and the<br>
comparison products were tested in five animals. Two hundred<br>
(200) uL of a suspension of Trichophyton mentagrophytes SM-110<br>
(1x108 arthrospores/mL) was inoculated to the plantar and<br>
interdigital skin of the hind paws, and the entire feet were<br>
then covered with bandage. The bandage was removed 28 days<br>
after fungal inoculation. Test treatments were applied for a<br>
period of 30 days, starting on the 60th day after infection.<br>
The infected nails were removed from the feet 7 days<br>
following the final treatment and were minced with scissors.<br>
The nails were placed in a glass homogenizer and PBS<br>
(phosphate buffer solution) containing 0.25% porcine<br>
pancreatic trypsin was added at a rate of 1 mL/50 mg of wet<br>
nail weight, and the nail was homogenized. The homogenate was<br>
allowed to stand at 37°C for 1 hour. One hundred microliters<br>
of the nail homogenate or its dilution was spread on a GPLP<br>
agar medium containing antibiotics and cultured at 30°C for 7<br>
days. After culturing, the fungal colonies that appeared on<br>
the medium were counted, and the number of colony forming<br>
units (CFU) of fungi in the nails was calculated. The nail<br>
sample was considered culture-negative when no fungal colony<br>
appeared on the plate.<br>
In Study 1, the efficacy of Formulation 087, applied<br>
to the nails at 30 uL/foot once a day for 30 days, was<br>
compared with untreated control animals and with 5% Amorolfine<br>
lacguer (Loceryl®) applied to the nails at 30 uL/foot once a<br>
week for 30 days. In Study 2, 1% naftifine gel (Naftin®) and<br>
8% ciclopirox lacquer (Penlac®), each applied to the nails at<br>
30 uL/foot once a day for 30 days, were compared with<br>
untreated control animals. The results of Study 1 and Study 2<br>
are shown in Table 3.<br>
The data of Table 3 establishes that the formulation<br>
of the invention was more efficacious in treating<br>
onychomycosis in an animal model of human disease than were<br>
several currently available therapies for onychomycosis. With<br>
Formulation 087 of the invention, 60% of the infected nails<br>
were culture-negative following treatment. With the<br>
compositions of the prior art, 10% or less of the infected<br>
nails were culture-negative following treatment.<br>
Example 4 - Clinical Assessment in Human Treatment<br>
An adult male human suffering from onychomycosis of<br>
the left large toenail was treated daily by topical<br>
application of a 10% topical formulation of the invention<br>
containing KP-103. Additional components of the 10% topical<br>
formulation were alcohol, vitamin E, butylated hydroxytoluene,<br>
cyclomethicone, diisopropyl alcohol, and C12-15 alkyl<br>
lactates. Nail involvement at the initiation of treatment was<br>
80% with onycholysis (separation of the nail plate from the<br>
nail bed) and thickening of subungual area. Following six<br>
months of treatment, the diseased proximal portion of the nail<br>
had grown out beyond the distal end of the nail plate<br>
(hyponychium) and was subsequently clipped off. There was no<br>
active fungal involvement of the nail plate, signs of<br>
onycholysis or thickening of the subungual area, or nail<br>
involvement after 6 months of treatment.<br>
Example 5 - Additional Formulations of the Invention<br>
Containing KP-103<br>
Several additional formulations of the invention<br>
were made containing identical components, but in varying<br>
concentrations, as shown in Table 4.<br>
While preferred embodiments of the invention have<br>
been described in detail, it will be apparent to those skilled<br>
in the art that the disclosed embodiments may be modified. It<br>
is intended that such modifications be encompassed in the<br>
