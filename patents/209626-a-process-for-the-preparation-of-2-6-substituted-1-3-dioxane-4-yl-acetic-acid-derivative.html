PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF 2-(6-SUBSTITUTED-13-DIOXANE-4-YL)ACETIC ACID DERIVATIVES<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of a 2-(6-iubstituted-1,3-dioxane-4-yl)acetic acid derivative of formula 1<br><br><br>
Applicant has surprisingly found that the 2-(6-substituted 1,3-dioxane-4-yl)-acetic acid derivative can be obtained selectively and in a high yield from the corresponding compound of formula (2), it being possible to prepare these products, which are relatively little stable, under mild conditions. This is all the more interesting since this provides a simple route via the corresponding salt, the corresponding t-butyl ester, and the 2-hydroxymethyl- substituted compound as intermediates in the preparation of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Optionally the conversion proceeds (depending on the reaction conditions chosen) via an intermediary salt or ester, with the ring in the compound according to formula (2) being opened.<br>
An added advantage of the process according to the invention is that both the starting compounds of formula (2) and the products of formula 3 are found to be crystalline compounds. This is advantageous in obtaining products with a (chemically and stereochemically) high purity. This is important in particular in view of the intended pharmaceutical application. For the intended application in particular the (4R,6S)-2-(6-substituted-1,3-dioxane-4-yi)acetic acid derivative is important. It can be prepared from the corresponding 6-substituted-2,4,6-trideoxy-D-erythrohexose. The invention, therefore, also relates to the starting compounds of formula 1, in particular where X=CI, and to particles of such compounds. In particular more than 90 wt.% of the particles has a length/diameter ratio between 1:1.5 and 1:6, preferably between 1:2 and 1:4.4 and a length of the particles between 0.05 and 2 mm, in particular between 0.1 and 1 mm. The invention also relates to such particles. The compound of formula 11 gives clear crystalline particles with a sharp melting point of 73-74 °C. The products of formula 3 derived from the (4R,6S)-2-(6-substituted-1,3-dioxane-4-yl)acetic acid derivative of formula 1 can according to the invention be prepared with an enantiomeric excess (e.e.) of more than 95%, in particular more than 99.5%, and with a diastereomeric excess (d.e.) of more than 90%, in particular more than 99.5%.<br>
Examples of suitable leaving groups X that can be applied in the process according to the invention are halogens, in particular CI, Br or 1; tosylate groups; mesylate groups; acyloxy groups, in particular acetoxy and benzoyloxy groups; an aryloxy-, in particular benzyloxy-, or a nitro-substituted benzene sulphonyl group. For practical reasons CI is preferably chosen as leaving group.<br>
The groups R1, R2 and R3 each separately stand for an alkyl group with 1-3 carbon atoms, preferably methyl or ethyl. In practice R1 = R2= R3 = methyl is most preferred.<br><br>
Examples of suitable acetalization agents that can be applied in the process according to the invention are dialkoxypropane compounds, with the alkoxy groups each preferably having 1-3 carbon atoms, for instance 2,2-dimethoxypropane or 2,2-diethoxypropane; alkoxypropene, with the alkoxy group preferably having 1-3 carbon atoms, for instance 2-methoxypropene or 2-ethoxypropene. Most preferred is 2,2-dimethoxypropane. This can optionally be formed in situ from acetone and methanol, preferably with water being removed.<br>
As acid catalyst use can be made of the acid catalysts known for acetalization reactions, preferably non-nucleophilic strong acids, for example sulphonic acids, in particular p-toluene sulphonic acid, methane sulphonic acid of camphor sulphonic acid; inorganic acids with a non-nucleophilic anion, for example sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid: acid ion exchangers, for example DOWEX; or solid acids, for example the so-called heteropolyacids.<br>
The acetalization can be carried out without using a separate solvent; if desired the reaction can also be carried out in an organic solvent. Examples of suitable organic solvents are ketones, in particular acetone, hydrocarbons, in particular aromatic hydrocarbons, for example toluene, chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example methylene chloride.<br>
The temperature at which the acetalization reaction is carried out preferably lies between -20°C and 60°C, in particular between 0°C and SOX. The acetalization reaction is preferably carried out under an inert atmosphere.<br>
The molar ratio of acetalization agent to starting compound of formula (2) preferably lies between 1:1 and 20:1, in particular between 3:1 and 5:1. Using an organic solvent the molar ratio is in particular between 1:1 and 2:1.<br>
The molar ratio of acid catalyst to starting compound of formula (2) preferably lies between 1:1 and 0.001:1, in particular between 0.01:1 and 0.05:1.<br>
The resulting 2-(6-substituted-1,3-dioxane-4-yl)acetic acid derivative can subsequently be hydrolyzed in the presence of a base and water to form the corresponding salt of formula 3<br><br><br>
where Y stands for an alkaline metal, an alkaline earth metal, or a substituted or unsubstituted ammonium group, preferably Na, Ca or a tetraalkyl-ammonium compound. Optionally, the hydrolysis is followed by conversion to the acetic acid according to formula 3 with Y=H.<br>
The hydrolysis of the compound of formula (3) is preferably carried out with at least 1 base equivalent, in particular 1-1.5 base equivalents, relative to the compound of formula (3). In principle a larger excess can be used, but in practice this usually does not offer any advantages.<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature between -20°C and 60°C, in particular between 0°C and SOX.<br>
The hydrolysis can for example be carried out in water, an organic solvent, for example an alcohol, in particular methanol or ethanol, an aromatic hydrocarbon, for example toluene, or a ketone, in particular acetone or methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), or a mixture of an organic solvent and water, optionally catalysed by a phase transfer catalyst (PTC) or addition of a cosolvent.<br>
The hydrolysis can also be carried out enzymatically, the desired diastereomer optionally being hydrolyzed selectively.<br>
Examples of enzymes that can suitably be used in the process according to the invention are enzymes with lipase or esterase activity, for example enzymes from Pseudomonas, in particular Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas tragi; Burkholderia, for example Burkholderia cepacia; Chromobactehum, in particular Chromobacterium viscosum] Bacillus, in particular Bacillus thermocatenulatus, Bacillus liclieniformis] Alcaligenes, in particular Alcaligenes faecalis] Aspergillus, in particular Aspergillus niger, Candida, in particular Candida antarctica, Candida rugosa, Candida lipolytica, Candida cylindracea] Geothchum, in particular Geotrichum candidum] Humicola, in particular Humicola lanuginosa] Penicillium, in particular Penicillium cyclopium, Penicillium roquefortii, Penicillium camembertii; Rhizomucor, in particular Rhizomucorjavanicus, Rhizomucor miehei  Mucor, in particular Mucoryavan/cus; Rhizopus, in particular Rhizopus oryzae, Rhizopus arhizus, Rhizopus delemar, Rhizopus niveus, Rhizopus japonicus, Rhizopus javanicus] porcine pancreas lipase, wheat germ lipase, bovine pancreas lipase, pig liver esterase. Preferably, use is made of an enzyme from Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas sp., Burkholderia cepacia, porcine pancreas, Rhizomucor miehei, Humicola lanuginosa, Candida rugosa or Candida antarctica or subtilisin. If an enantioselective enzyme is used, even further enantiomer enrichment is realized<br><br>
during the hydrolysis. Such enzymes can be obtained using commonly known technologies. Many enzymes are produced on a technical scale and are commercially available.<br>
The salts (acids) obtained are novel. The invention therefore also relates to these products of formula 3<br><br><br>
and catalyzed by for example dimethyl formamide (DMF) (J. Org. Chem. 35 2429 (1970));<br>
reaction via the acid chloride with Li-t-butanolate (Org. Synth. 51 96(1971));<br>
transesterification with t-butyl acetate under the influence of a strong acid (Z. Chem. 12(7) 264 (1972));<br>
reaction of the salt with t-butyl bromide, preferably in DMF, dimethyl acetamide (DMAA), 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone(NMP) and using a phase transfer catalyst (PTC) (Tetr. Let. 34 (46) 7409 (1993));<br>
reaction of the acid with t-butanol, 1,3-dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (DCC) and DMAP (Synth. Comm. 9, 542 (1979));<br>
reaction of the acid with t-butyl-trichloro acetamidate (Tetr. Let. 39, 1557(1998));<br>
reaction of the salt with carboxyl diimidazole (CDl) and t-butanol;<br>
reaction of the acid with pivaloyl chloride and t-butanol under the influence of DMAP or N-methyl-morpholin (NMM) (Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan 52 (7) 1989 (1979));<br>
reaction of the salt with di-tert. butyl dicarbonate, DMAP and t-butanol (Synthesis 1063 (1994));<br>
reaction of the acid with cyanuric chloride and pyridine or triethylamine (Org Process R&amp;D 3,172 (1999); Heterocycles 3111, 2055 (1990)).<br>
The resulting t-butyl ester of 2-(6-substituted-1,3-dioxane-4-yl)acetic acid can subsequently be converted into the 2-(6-hydroxymethyl-1,3-dioxane-4-yl)acetic acid, for example as described in US-A-5594153 or in EP-A-1024139, in the presence of a tetraalkyi ammonium halogenide and/or a carboxylic acid in the salt, via conversion into a compound of formula la with R3 = t-butyl and X = an acyloxy, for example an acetoxy group. The acyloxy group can subsequently be converted via solvolysis, in a way otherwise generally known, to a hydroxy! group. The solvolysis can be performed using a base (Na2CO3, K2CO3, or sodium methanolate in methanol), optionally by simultaneous distillation of the methyl acetate formed.<br>
The t-butyl ester of 2-(6-hydroxymethyl-1,3-dioxane-4-yl)acetic acid is a desirable intermediate product in the preparation of various statins, for example ZD-4522, as described in Drugs of the future, (1999), 24(5), 511-513 by M. Watanabe et a!., Bioorg. &amp; Med. Chem. (1997), 5(2), 437-444. The invention therefore provides a novel, interesting route to these intermediate products and to<br><br>
the end products, in particular statins.<br>
The starting compounds of formula 2 can for example be obtained as described in WO-A-96/31615.<br>
The invention will be elucidated with reference to the following examples, without however being restricted by these.<br>
