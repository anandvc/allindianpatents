				<td>[Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a tire for vehicle and a tubeless tire both allowing continuation of running in case of puncture.<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
A conventional tire structure for preventing puncture is known from Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 5-201213, for example. In this conventional tire structure, a sectionally crescent-shaped cushion formed of a rubber composition is interposed between a tread portion and a tube of a tire, so that in the case that the tread portion of the tire is pierced by a nail or the like, the tip of the nail is made difficult to reach the tube inside of the cushion.<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the above conventional tire structure, however, the occurrence of puncture cannot be avoided in the case that the tube is damaged. Furthermore, during normal running of a vehicle, the cushion repeatedly receives a load. As a result, the cushion is compressed during long-term use to cause a reduction in volume or an increase in hardness of the cushion, thus reducing the performance.<br>
It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a tube tire and tubeless tire which can continue running of a vehicle in case of puncture, and can maintain this performance even after long-term use.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
Accordingly there is provided a tire for vehicle comprising a tire tube and a plurality of elastic members being contained in said tire tube, characterized in that a total volume of said plurality of elastic members is 50 to 80 percent of a volume of said tube when said tube is inflated to a size fitting the tire, and wherein at least one of said plurality of elastic members is free to move about inside said tube.<br>
According to the invention as defined in claim 1, there is provided in a tube tire including a tire adapted to be mounted on an outer circumference of a rim, and a tube accommodated in a space adapted to be defined by said rim and said tire; the improvement characterized in that a plurality of spherical members formed of a foamed material are charged in an air chamber defined in said tube so as to occupy 50% to 80% of the volume of said air chamber.<br>
According to the invention as defined in claim 2, there is provided in a tubeless tire including a tire adapted to be mounted on an outer circumference of a rim to define an air-tight air chamber inside said tire; the improvement characterized in that a plurality of spherical members formed of a foamed material are charged in said air chamber so as to occupy 50% to 80% of the volume of said air chamber.<br>
According to the invention as defined in claim 3 including the limitation of claim 2, a plurality of bags each filled with said spherical members are accommodated in said air chamber.<br>
[BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS] [FIG. 1]<br>
FIG. 1 is a transverse sectional view of a wheel on which a tube tire is mounted. [FIG. 2]<br>
FIG. 2 is a view similar to FIG. 1, illustrating the operation when the tube tire has become punctured.<br>
[FIG. 3]<br>
FIG.   3 is a transverse sectional view of a wheel on<br>
which a tubeless tire is mounted,   according to a second preferred embodiment.<br>
[Preferred Embodiment]<br>
Some preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the attached<br>
^<br>
drawings.<br>
[FIG. 4]<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2 show a first preferred embodiment of the present invention, in which FIG. 1 is a transverse sectional view of a wheel on which a tube tire is mounted, and FIG. 2 is a view similar to FIG. 1, illustrating theH&amp;-<br>
operation when the tube tire has become punctured.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, a rim R of a wheel for a motorcycle is connected through a plurality of wire spokes S to a hub (not shown). A tube tire T consisting of a tire 1 and a tube 2 accommodated in the tire 1 is mounted on the rim R.  The rim R is provided with an annular rim body portion 11 extending in the circumferential direction of the tube tire T and a pair of flange portions 12 extending radially outward from the axial opposite ends of the rim body portion 11 to retain the inner circumference of the tire 1. The tube 2 is provided with an air valve 6 for charging air into an air chamber 3 defined in the tube 2. The air valve 6 is passed through an air valve mounting portion 13 formed at one circumferential position of the rim body portion 11, and is fixed to the air valve mounting portion 13 by nuts 14 and 15. [0011]<br>
A plurality of spherical members 16 formed of foamed rubber or foamed urethane are charged in the air chamber 3 of the tube 2.  The amount (total volume) of the spherical members 16 is set to 50 % to 80 % of the volume<br>
of the tube 2 in its expanded condition. The charging of the spherical members 16 in the air chamber 3 of the tube 2 may be carried out in such a manner that, for example, when an extruded tube material is cut to a given length and next joined at its opposite ends, a given amount of spherical members 16 is preliminarily charged in the tube material.<br>
The spherical members 16 are allowed to freely move in the tube 2 during running of the vehicle. However, since the spherical members 16 are formed of foamed rubber or foamed urethane, and have an edgeless smooth shape, there is no possibility that the spherical members 16 may damage the tube 2.  Further, no load is applied to the spherical members 16 during normal running, there is no possibility that the spherical members 16 may be reduced in<br>
volume or may be hardened by the load.  Accordingly, the<br>
spherical members 16 can be used over a long term.<br>
In the event that the tube tire T is pierced by a nail or the like to cause leakage of the air out of the air chamber 3 of the tube 2, thus becoming a so-called punctured condition, the outside shape of the tire 1 can be<br>
maintained to some extent because the plural spherical members 16 are present in the lower space of the air chamber 3 of the compressed tube 2 as shown in FIG. 2. Therefore, short-distance running to a repair shop, for example, can be continued. As mentioned above, the spherical members 16 are formed of foamed rubber or foamed urethane both having elasticity, and have an edgeless smooth shape. Accordingly, there is no possibility that the spherical members 16 may damage the tube 2 during running in the punctured condition.<br>
When the tube tire T runs onto an obstacle on a road surface to receive an impact load, the tire 1 and the tube 2 are partially compressed in their radial direction by this load. At this time, the tire 1 and the tube 2 are<br>
nipped between the radially outward projecting flange<br>
^. portions 12 of the rim R and the obstacle, so that the<br>
opposed inner wall surfaces of the tube 2 come into contact with each other. However, according to this preferred embodiment, the presence of the spherical members 16 can avoid the contact of the opposed inner wall surfaces of the tube 2, thereby effectively preventing a damage to the tube<br>
2 due to striking of the rim thereagainst.<br>
The amount of the spherical members 16 is set to preferably in the range of 50 % to 80 % of the volume of the tube 2 in its expanded condition.  If this amount is larger than this range, elastic deformation of the tire 1 is hindered to cause a bad comfortability to ride, whereas if this amount is smaller than this range, the tire 1 becomes largely flat to cause an impossibility to run.<br>
A second preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
The second preferred embodiment is applied to a tubeless tire T. An inner circumferential opening portion<br>
of a tire 1 is kept in pressure contact with the inner<br>
^. surfaces of right and left flange portions 12 of a rim R by<br>
the pressure of air charged in an air chamber 3 of the tire 1, thereby maintaining air tightness of the air chamber 3. A plurality of spherical members 16 formed of foamed rubber or foamed urethane are charged in the air chamber 3 in such a manner that they are separated into some groups which are<br>
accommodated in a plurality of bags 17 formed from a thin<br>
4<br>
film of rubber, nylon, or polyethylene. The plural bags 17 each filled with the spherical members 16 are accommodated in the tire 1, and the tire 1 is then mounted on the rim R. Thereafter, air is charged into the air chamber 3 of the tire 1. Since the spherical members 16 are grouped to be accommodated in the plural bags 17, scattering of the spherical members 16 is prevented in charging them into the tire 1, thereby improving the workability. [0018]<br>
Also according to the second preferred embodiment, if the tire 1 is pierced by a nail or the like to become punctured, the outside shape of the tire 1 is maintained to some extent by the plural spherical members 16 present in the space of the air chamber 3. Accordingly,<br>
short-distance running to a repair shop, for example, can<br>
be continued.<br>
Having thus described the preferred embodiments of the present invention, various design changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. [Effect of the Invention]<br>
*<br>
According to the invention as defined in claim 1, a plurality of spherical members formed of a formed material are charged in an air chamber defined in a tube of a tube tire so as to occupy 50 % to 80 % of the volume of the air chamber. Accordingly, in case of puncture of the tube tire, the outside shape of the tire can be maintained by the spherical members to allow continuation of running. Further, since no load is applied to the spherical members during normal running, a reduction in volume or a deterioration such as hardening of the spherical members can be prevented. <br>
According to the invention as defined in claim 2, a plurality of spherical members formed of a foamed material<br>
are charged in an air chamber of a tubeless tire so as to<br>
•+. occupy 50 % to 80 % of the volume of the air chamber.<br>
Accordingly, in case of puncture of the tubeless tire, the outside shape of the tire can be maintained by the spherical members to allow continuation of running. Further, since no load is applied to the spherical members during normal running, a reduction in volume or a<br><br>
deterioration such as hardening of the spherical members can be prevented.<br>
According to the invention as defined in claim 3, a plurality of bags each filled with the spherical members of the foamed material are accommodated in the air chamber. Accordingly, scattering of the spherical members can be prevented to thereby improve the workability.<br>
