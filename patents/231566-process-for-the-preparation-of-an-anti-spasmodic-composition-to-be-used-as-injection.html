				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a synergestic Anti-spasmodic composition to be used as an injection. More specifically the present invention relates to the preparation of an Anti-spasmodic composition comprising Diclofenac or its salts and two drugs Pitofenone hydrochloride and Fenpiveriniurn bromide in a pharmaceutical1y acceptable combination.<br>
The present application has been divided out of patent application No.  792/Del/96  filed on  12th  April, 1996.<br>
BACKGROUND  OF  THE  INVENTION<br>
Amongst the various Non-steroidal anti-inf1ammatory drugs Diclofenac particularly sodium diclofenac is widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthiritis, osteoarthirities and ankylosing spondylitis. This has been disclosed in the following references (references from  US  Patent  5202159).<br>
As such, intestinal, ureteric and biliary colic are extremely common clinical conditions requiring prompt medical attention to relieve the symptoms and help the patient get back to his/her vocation to avoid/minimize economic loss and reduce the load on the medical institution. Non-surgical treatment can provide immediate relief to the patient while investigations are being carried out to determine the future course of management. Currently available treatment modalities include anticholinergics like, atropine and its derivatives, ambutonium, glycopyrroniurn, isoperopamide,pripenzolate and the like. Combination therapy with<br>
an,algin, pitofenone and fenpive.rinium are also used. In addition, drugs such as meberverine valetliamate bromide, clidiniutn are also used with. <br>
All drugs do not provide 'predictably uniform results in all patients. All the drugs used in 'these conditions do carry some<br>
side effects. Anticholinergics produce dry mouth, tachycardia in some patients, are contraindicated in glaucoma and prostatic hypertrophy and other antispasmodic agents may cause drowsiness as a side effect. Analgin is implicated in causing bone marrow<br>
depression.<br>
In the comprehensive review of a pharmacological properties of Diclofenac Sodium (Brogden et al, Drugs 20/24-48 (1980) it has been reported to have anti inflammatory activity, analgesic activity and anti pyretic activity. Conventionally it has been used in clinical condition for rheumatic disorders. Recently it has been reported to be of use in- painful non-rheumatic syndromes for example biliary colic, (Grossi et al. current Therapeutic Research, volumes 40 No 5 (1986)} and acute renal colic {Garcia Alonso F. et al, Evr. J. din Pharmacol 40/543-546 (1991)}<br>
However it has been reported .that Diclofenac Sodium intramuscular is more effective than Narcotic analgesic like pethidine intramuscular in the management of acute renal colic and has fewer side effects. Based on the market survey among the various products available as antispasmodic one major product is composed of Analgin with two spasmolytic agents that is pitofenone<br>
hydrochloride   and   fenpiverenium  bromide'.<br>
No   pharmacological   compos.it;ion   lias   been   reported   in   literature   as well    as   no   product    is   available   where   Diclofenac   sodium   is<br>
employed   in  combination with  Spasmolytic   agents.<br>
Our findings as disclosed in this patent application indicate that non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as diclofenac sodium when combined with fenpiverenium bromide and pitofenone hydrochloride forms an excellent antispasmodic composition. The composition when given orally and intramuscuiarally is not only clinically effective but is superior to the existing therapeutic agents. It is superior in two ways one it has more effective action and second it has fewer side .effects.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel anti-spasmodic composition comprising diclofenac and like non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs and their salts and pitofenone hydrochloride and fer.piverinium bromide.<br>
It is a further objective of the present invention to provide a<br>
process for the manufacture of a novel anti-spasmodic composition<br>
comprising sodium diclofeneic and pitofenone' hydrochloride and<br>
fenpiverinium bromide.	<br>
It is a further objective of the invention to provide a novel injectable delivery system for the anti-spasmodic, composition.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a synergestic anti-spasmodic composition to be used as injection which comprises distilling Benzyl alcohol as pain reducer and dissolving it in a solvent propylene glycol, separately dissolving Diclofenac or its salts in water, mixing the said pain reducer solution with the Diclofenac or its salts solution to form a dissolved mixture, mixing Pitofenone hydrochloride with said dissolved mixture and adding thereto Fenpiverinium bromide to form the desired injectable composition wherein Diclofenac or its salts, Pitofenone hydrochloride and Fenpiverinium bromide are present in the following proportions  :<br>
Diclofenac  or  its  salts      ..   from  1.0  to  10 %  w/v.<br>
Pitofenone hydrochloride        ..   from 0.05  to  2.0 %  w/v.<br>
Fenpiverinium bromide	..   from  0.001 to  0.2 %  w/v.<br>
The said salts of  Diclofenac  are  sodium, ammonium, potassium, or epolamine. Preferably  Diclofenac  sodium  salt  is  used.<br>
Preferably  the  pH  of the  injectable  composition  is  adusted between  8.2 to 8.8  by the addition of Hydrochloric acid.<br>

From    the    above	tables    of    demographic    details,     there    is    no<br>
statistically   significant   difference	between   the    two    sexes   with<br>
relation to age, diagnosis ant| duration of: illness. However, there is a statistically significant dirrerence in the mean number of tablets per week consumed for' the relief of ureteric colic   for   female   patients   in   comparison   to   males    (p,0.05).    Since<br>
there   wera   no   mala   pat fan to   with   biliary   eolie,    it   is   not<br>
possible to determine the difference between the two sexes.<br>
Past history of parenteral antispasmodic drug intake '<br>
Almost all patients needed parenteral antispasmodic drugs for<br>
symptomatic relief while on oral 'antispasmodic drugs. Although<br>
all patients were not able to exactly remember, the frequency of -<br>
parenteral antispasmodic drug therapy varied from once every one<br>
month to two to four times every month.<br>
Most of the patients of both sexes reported uniformly good<br>
response with existing antispasmodic drug therapy. Five patients<br>
of intestinal colic, three of ureterip colic and two of biliary<br>
colic reported uncomfortable side effects such as, dry mouth and<br>
pa;petitions with anticholinergic drugs.<br>
Need  for additional parenteral antispasmodic drug in the present<br>
s tudy:<br>
No   patient    required   parenteral   antispasmodic   in   the   present<br>
