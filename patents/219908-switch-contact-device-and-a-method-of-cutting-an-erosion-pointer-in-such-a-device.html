				<td>Switch contact arrangement with an erosion display for the<br>
switch contacts<br>
5<br>
	The invention is in the area of electrical switches provided<br>
	with a switch contact arrangement fitted with a first moving<br>
	switch contact, and a .second switch contact provided for the<br>
	first switch contact, and is intended for use in the design<br>
10	 and construction of an erosion display for the said switch<br>
	contacts.<br>
	In a known switch contact arrangement for a low-voltage<br>
	circuit-breaker, the erosion display comprises an erosion<br>
15	pointer and a display surface or display edge. The erosion<br>
	pointer follows the movement of the first switch contact and,<br>
	with the contacts closed, then extends beyond the display<br>
	surface or display edge only when the value for the erosion of<br>
	the switch contacts is less than a given maximum value<br>
20	(Instruction Manual for Circuit-Breaker 3WN6, Siemens AG,<br>
	Germany, 1998) . In this known switch contact arrangement, the<br>
	moving switch contact has a contact holder and a plurality of<br>
	contact levers supported on the contact holder by means of<br>
	contact force springs. The metal erosion pointer is supported<br>
25	on one of the contact levers and located in a hole drilled in<br>
	the contact holder in the direction of force of the contact<br>
	force spring. A recess in the contact holder serves as an<br>
	inspection hole, one side of. which opens to the drill hole,<br>
	such that the end of the erosion pointer facing away from the<br>
30	contact lever only extends into the inspection aperture when<br>
	there is a permitted amount of erosion on contact surfaces<br>
	formed on the contact levers(contact members). If the value<br>
	for the erosion on these contact surfaces is greater than the<br>
	predefined maximum value, the erosion pointer no longer<br><br>
2002P15023WOUS 	PCT/DE2003/002591<br>
3<br>
	According to the invention, the term erosion pointer means<br>
	that element which is clearly visible when it extends beyond<br>
	the display surface or display edge and which can be shortened<br>
	without great technical effort, for instance by cutting. Such<br>
5	an element can have any kind of cross-section, such as<br>
	polygonal, oval or round, and may also take the form of a<br>
	stiff atrip or tape. This element may be supported on the<br>
	moving switch contact, directly or via a connecting link, or<br>
	may be fastened to the moving switch contact, or designed as<br>
10	an integral component of the moving switch contact.<br>
	In a preferred embodiment of the innovative switch contact<br>
	arrangement it is envisaged that the marking, in particular<br>
	that for guiding the cutting edge of a tool, will take the<br>
15	form of a.cutting surface or cutting edge. Using such a design<br>
	the erosion pointer can be shortened accurately on the cutting<br>
	edge or cutting surface without the need for any additional<br>
	mark on the erosion pointer itself.<br>
20	So that it will be easier to shorten the erosion pointer, it<br>
	is envisaged that the erosion pointer will be made of plastic.<br>
	To provide support for the erosion pointer during cutting, and<br>
	as a simple means of avoiding damage to the erosion pointer<br>
25	during shortening, a supporting surface can be provided<br>
	running parallel to the erosion pointer.<br>
	In particular the low-voltage circuit-breaker known from the<br>
	aforementioned instruction manual can also be provided with<br>
30	the innovative switch contact arrangement because the marking<br>
	is formed by a first side of a second recess which is open to<br>
	the first recess. In this case the supporting surface can be<br>
	formed from a section of the drill hole open to the floor of<br>
	the first recess. The second recess can form lateral guide<br><br>
	surfaces for the tool used for cutting.<br>
	In an innovative switch contact arrangement built into an<br>
	electrical switch, the erosion pointer can easily be adapted<br>
5	to the dimensional tolerances of the innovative switch contact<br>
	arrangement by cutting the pointer as necessary. For this<br>
	purpose an erosion pointer that extends beyond the marking<br>
	when the switch contacts are closed merely has to be provided<br>
	for the innovative switch contact arrangement and then cut off<br>
10	at the marking. An ordinary tool such as a slotted screwdriver<br>
	can be used for cutting.<br>
	A typical embodiment of a switch contact arrangement for an<br>
	electrical switch in the form of a low-voltage circuit-breaker<br>
15	with the innovative erosion display is shown in Figures 1 to<br>
	7. These are as follows:<br>
	Figure 1 is a diagram of a low-voltage circuit-breaker with a<br>
	switch contact arrangement comprising an erosion display for<br>
20	switch contacts provided with contact surfaces,<br>
	Figure 2 shows the switch contact arrangement according to<br>
	Figure 1 as it first appears in its unused condition before<br>
	the erosion pointer has been shortened.<br>
	Figure 3 shows the switch contact arrangement in its unused<br>
25	condition when the erosion pointer is being cut,<br>
	Figure 4 shows the switch contact arrangement in the condition<br>
	of maximum permitted erosion of the contact surfaces on the<br>
	switch contacts,<br>
	Figure 5 is a sectional view of a first section of the switch<br>
30	contact arrangement along the line A-A in Figure 3<br>
	and<br>
	Figures 6 and 7 are a top view of a second section of the<br>
	switch contact arrangement with the erosion pointer still not<br>
	shortened as in Figure 2, and with the erosion pointer cut as<br><br>
2002P15023WOUS 	PCT/DE2003/002591<br>
5<br>
in Figure 3.<br>
	The low-voltage circuit-breaker according to Figure 1 has a<br>
	housing 1 containing a switch contact arrangement (consisting<br>
5	of a moving switch contact 2 and a static contact 31, an arc<br>
	quenching chamber 4 and a drive mechanism 6. The said drive<br>
	mechanism 6 is used in this case to activate the moving switch<br>
	contact 2, which has a plurality of contact levers 8 supported<br>
	in a pivoting contact holder 7 and arranged parallel to each<br>
10	other (only one contact lever is visible in the figure). The<br>
	contact levers 8 are pivotally attached in a known way to the<br>
	contact holder 7 by a joint bolt and pre-tensioned by two<br>
	contact force springs 9 each. Flexible conductors 10 serve to<br>
	connect the contact levers 8 to a lower connecting bar 11. The<br>
15	static switch contact 3 associated with the moving switch<br>
	contact 2 is connected to an upper connecting bar 12. The<br>
	switch contacts 2, 3 are provided with contact surfaces 13, 14<br>
	(contact members) in the form of superimposed bodies made from<br>
	a very special material, and consisting of sintered materials<br>
20	containing Ni, W and other special metals. Since these are<br>
	comparatively expensive they are applied in relatively thin<br>
	layers. The contact surfaces 13, 14 are still quite thick when<br>
	the switch contact arrangement is in its unused condition, and<br>
	its material is eroded by an electric arc. It is thus<br>
25	necessary to ensure that the contact surfaces are melted away<br>
	fully. Therefore a certain value is specified as the maximum<br>
	permitted erosion value, and the switch contact arrangement<br>
	includes a display device 15 to display the current erosion<br>
	value. When a new switch contact arrangement is fitted on the<br>
30	electrical switch operator's premises it is desirable that the<br>
	erosion display can be set to the value specified for the<br>
	maximum permitted erosion without a special tool.<br>
	For this purpose the erosion display according to Figure 2 has<br><br>
2002P15023WOUS 	PCT/DE2003/002591<br>
6<br>
	a plastic erosion pointer 16, together with a display surface<br>
	17 or display edge 18 aligned at a first level, the erosion<br>
	pointer 16 needing to be shortened, with the switch contacts<br>
	2, 3 closed, at a marking of the switch contact arrangement,<br>
5	said marking being in the form of a cutting surface 19. This<br>
	cutting surface 19 is separated from the display surface 17 by<br>
	a distance 20, the value of which corresponds to the specified<br>
	maximum erosion value,<br>
10	The newly inserted erosion pointer is supported on one of the<br>
	contact levers 8. For this purpose the said pointer has a<br>
	collar 21 at its end pointing toward the contact lever. This<br>
	collar 21 fits into a pocket 22 in the contact lever. Between<br>
	the collar and the far end 23 of a socket 24 for one of the<br>
15	contact force springs 9, the contact force spring 9 through<br>
	which the erosion pointer 16 extends is pre-tensioned, holding<br>
	the erosion pointer against the contact lever 8 in such a way<br>
	that the pointer follows the movement of the contact lever.<br>
	The far end 23 of the socket 24 for the contact force spring<br>
20	is the starting point of a drill hole 25 which extends through<br>
	the contact holder 7 and is open both to a first side of a<br>
	first recess 27 forming the display surface 17 and to the<br>
	floor 35 of the first recess 27. This drill hole 2b serves as<br>
	a guide for the erosion pointer 16. The value for the width of<br>
25	 the first recess 27 in the direction in which the erosion<br>
	pointer 16 moves is the same as the value of the distance 20,<br>
	being the maximum permitted erosion value. On the side 28<br>
	which points away from the contact holder the drill hole is<br>
	open to a first side of a second recess 30 which is also<br>
30	accessible from above. With the switch contacts 2, 3 closed, a<br>
	new. erosion pointer 16 extends beyond the first side of the<br>
	second recess 30 used as the cutting surface 19 (cf. also<br>
	Figure 6).<br><br>
2002P15023WOUS 	PCT/DE2003/002591<br>
7<br>
	According to Figure 3, a slotted screwdriver 31 with its<br>
	tapered end acting as a cutting edge 32 is pushed sharply<br>
	downward onto the cutting surface 19 in order to cut the<br>
	erosion pointer 16. For this purpose the side surfaces 33, 34<br>
5	(cf. Figure 6) of the second recess 30 act as guide surfaces<br>
	for the screwdriver 31.<br>
	According to Figure 5 a section of the drill hole open to the<br>
	floor 35 of the first recess 27 forms a supporting surface 36<br>
10	for the erosion pointer 16 during cutting. The floor 37 of the<br>
	second recess is somewhat deeper, so that a part 38 (cf.<br>
	Figures 3 and 6) of the erosion pointer 16 projecting beyond<br>
	the cutting surface 19 can be cut completely. Other tools may<br>
	also be used to remove the said part 38 by cutting, filing or<br>
15	some other means.<br>
	According to Figures 3 and 7, the end of the erosion pointer<br>
	16 is level with the cutting surface 19 after cutting, so that<br>
	when the switch contact arrangement is in its unused condition<br>
20	said pointer exactly indicates the maximum permitted erosion<br>
	value when viewed in relation to the display surface 17.<br>
	According to Figure 4, the end of the erosion pointer.16 is<br>
	level with the display surface 17 and can therefore no longer<br>
25	be seen by an observer from above when the contact surfaces<br>
	13, 14 of the switch contacts 2, 3 have been burned away by<br>
	the predefined maximum permitted value and the switch contact<br>
	arrangement needs to be renewed.<br>
