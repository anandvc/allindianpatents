				<td>F;ield of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a non-contact agitator device used in smelting of non-ferrous metal, and more particularly to a super-strong permanent magnetic swirling agitator operating underneath a smelting furnace for non-ferrous metal.<br>
Background<br>
Agitators are widely used in smelting of non-ferrous metal. At present, agitation manners of these widely used agitators include electromagnetic agitation, mechanical agitation and manual agitation. Electromagnetic agitators drive the molten non-ferrous metal to flow in the smelting furnace by means of traveling-wave magnetic Held which is generated after electrifying the special coils. Such an electromagnetic agitator employs circulatory water for heat dissipation, which has disadvantages that (1) energy consumption is high, e.g., a smelting furnace which smelts 30 ton metal will consume electricity more than 300 kw per hour, (2) it tends to cause electricity leakage, with a result of low safety, since water circulates through the hollow coils to dissipate heal (this also imposes stringent requirements on water treatment), and (3) installation and operation are troublesome since the structure is complex and there arc tremendous pipes.<br>
The operating principle of mechanical agitation is agitation of a contact type. This manner is disadvantageous due to its small agitation range, low agitation speed, and possibility of burning and damaging components which result from limitations from the smelting furnaces.<br>
Manual agitation is more rudimentary, having disadvantages of extensive labor, low agitation speed, uneven agitation and exposure to harsh environments.<br>
To address the above problems, an agitator and a smelting furnace with the same are disclosed in CN patent No. 20041007130l.X. The agitator employs a plurality of magnets., which are rotated via a motor to generate a rotary magnetic field, so as to drive the molten non-ferrous metal to flow in a predefined direction, and thus to make it swirl in the furnace. However, the agitator can only be applied to a smelting furnace with an inclined bottom. Therefore the agitator disclosed in CN patent No. 200410071301.X can not be employed in flat bottomed smelting furnaces which arc widely used in current non-ferrous metal smelting industry, with the result of a limited application.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

invention comprises a frame, a spindle, a turntable, permanent magnets, and a non-magnetic safety enclosure, wherein the upper end of the spindle passes through the frame and extends outward, the turntable is provided to the upper end of the spindle, a plurality of permanent magnets are fixedly coupled over the turntable and are arranged in a manner such that they at least have one closed loop oriented from N-pole to S-pole, the agitator is characterized in that, the spindle is perpendicular to a horizontal plane, the turntable assumes a horizontal position, each permanent magnet is a NdFeB permanent magnet, these NdFeH permanent magnets are located in the inner chamber of the non-magnetic safety enclosure fixedly coupled to the frame, the non-magnetic safety enclosure is provided with a nonmetal heat resistant plate of a circular shape on its top surface, an air-cooling mechanism is provided to the non-magnetic safety enclosure, the lower end of the spindle is directly fixedly coupled to a reducer located on the bottom surface of the frame, the power input shaft of the reducer is connected to the rotary shaft of a frequency and speed modulation motor, the motor is controlled by a programmable controller in the control cabinet according to operation procedures so as to carry out forward and reverse rotations alternately, and thus to drive the plurality of permanent magnets to rotate in forward and reverse directions synchronously via the reducer, the spindle and the turntable.<br>
The permanent magnets are in shape of a rectangular or square parallelepiped. They are arranged in such a manner that even numbers of permanent magnets are aligned radiately, with the ends in the same direction of two adjacent permanent magnets having the opposite polarity.<br>
The permanent magnets are in shape of a square or a wedge, wherein the number of permanent magnets in a square shape is odd and the number of the permanent magnets in a wedge shape is two, and these permanent magnets are linearly arranged on the turntable, closely adjacent to each other. Among these permanent magnets, the two magnets in a wedge shape are respectively arranged on two ends, and a permanent magnet in a square shape located in the center has its polarity laterally arranged, the permanent magnets on the same side of the laterally arranged permanent magnet assume the same polarity at the ends in the same direction.<br>
Furthermore, a yoke and a secondary yoke are successively fixedly coupled between the permanent magnets and the turntable, which serves to reduce magnetic leakage so as to increase the strength of upper magnetic lines of force.<br>
The air-cooling mechanism includes an axial fan or a centrifugal fan fixedly coupled to one side of the non-magnetic safety enclosure, and a vent-pipe located on the top surface side of the non-magnetic safety enclosure, the vent-pipe communicates with a high-pressure centrifugal fan.<br>
The number of the axial fan (or the centrifugal fan) is one or two through four.<br><br>
In order to sense the temperature in the inner chamber of the non-magnetic safety enclosure, a thermal couple is installed on the non-magnetic safety enclosure, which assists to control the axial fan or centrifugal fan to automatically operate and stop.<br>

The preferred embodiment according to the present invention will be described in<br>
further details with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 through 3, the super-strong permanent magnetic swirling agitator according to the present invention consists of a frame 3, which is surrounded with a case 20 on the outside. A spindle 14 is provided in the inner side of the case 20, perpendicularly to a horizontal plane. The upper end of the spindle 14 passes through the frame 3 and the case 20 so as to extend outward, and is mounted with a turntable 13 assuming a horizontal position. The lower end of the spindle 14 is connected to a power system provided on the frame 3. Over the turntable 13 are fixedly coupled a plurality of permanent magnets 15 via secondary yoke 17 and yoke 16 which serve to reduce magnetic leakage. These permanent magnets 15 are arranged in a radiating form and at regular intervals. The ends of two adjacent permanent magnets 15 in the same direction assume opposite polarities so as to form one or more closed loops oriented from N-pole to S-pole. The permanent magnets 15 may be in shape of a rectangular or square parallelepiped, and their number is even, e.g. two, four and six as shown in Figs. 4, 5 and 6, respectively. Each of permanent magnets 15 is NdFeB permanent magnet, which is located in the inner chamber of a non-magnetic safety enclosure 9 fixedly coupled over the frame 3 and the case 20. The non-magnetic<br><br>
safety enclosure 9 is provided with a thermal couple 8 on its side surface and with a nonmetal heat resistant plate 12 of a circular shape on its top surface. Furthermore, an air-cooling mechanism is provided to the non-magnetic safety enclosure 9. The lower end of the spindle 14 is directly connected to the power system provided on the bottom surface of the frame 3, which power system includes a reducer 1 fixed on the bottom surface of the frame 3. The power input shaft of the reducer 1 is connected to a rotary shaft of a frequency and speed modulation motor 2. The motor 2 is controlled by a programmable controller 21 in the control cabinet according to operation procedures so as to carry out forward and reverse rotations alternately. In this way, the plurality of permanent magnets 15 are caused to forwardly and reversely rotate synchronously by means of the reducer 1, the spindle 14 and the turntable 13. As shown in Figs. 9 and 10, in the programmable controller 21, 0.00, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04 represent input ports, 10.0, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 represent output ports. SA1-11 represents a centralized control state button, SAI-21 represents a on-site state button, SB11 is a button for starting forward rotation, SB 12 is a button for stopping, SB 13 is a button for starting reverse rotation, HL1 is a light indicating forward rotation, HL2 is a light indicating reverse rotation, HL3 is a light indicating failure, and Kl, K2 and K3 are AC contactors for controlling the frequency and speed modulation motor.<br>
Permanent magnets 15 may be in shape of a rectangular (or square) parallelepiped and a wedge as shown in Figs. 7 and 8, wherein the number of magnets in a rectangular parallelepiped shape may be three (or five, seven, or more), and the number of magnets in a wedge shape may be two. These permanent magnets 15 are linearly arranged on the turntable 13, closely adjacent to each other. Among these permanent magnets 15, the two wedge-like magnets are arranged on two ends, and the permanent magnet in shape of a rectangular parallelepiped located in the center has its polarity laterally arranged so as to cause magnetic lines of force on the both sides to deflect outward. In this way, the width and height of the radiation range of magnetic lines of force are increased. The permanent magnets on each side of the laterally arranged permanent magnet 15 assume the same polarity at the ends in the same direction.<br>
The air-cooling mechanism includes an axial fan or a centrifugal fan 7 fixedly coupled to one side of the non-magnetic safety enclosure 9, and a vent-pipe 10 located on the top surface side of the non-magnetic safety enclosure 9 and communicated with the axial fan or centrifugal fan 7. The vent-pipe 10 communicates with a high-pressure centrifugal fan 11 which is additionally provided. The number of the axial fan or centrifugal fan 7 may be one, two, three or four.<br>
The super-strong permanent magnetic swirling agitator according to the present invention is provided, to its bottom, with a height adjusting means for adapting to different metal smelting furnaces, and a traveling mechanism for facilitating its movement at the same time, wherein the height adjusting means includes four wormwheel-screw lifters 6 which are arranged on the four corners of the frame 3, respectively, and which are powered by motors 19 assigned to themselves, the<br><br>
traveling mechanism includes truckles 5 installed on the bottom of the frame 3, which consist of driven wheels and drive wheels, in which the drive wheels are connected to a cycloidal pinwheel reducer 4 via a chain 18. with the reducer 4 being installed on the top surface of the frame 3 and being provided with a braking motor.<br>
When in use, the super-strong permanent magnetic swirling agitator according to the present invention is horizontally arranged at the lower portion of a non-ferrous metal smelting furnace close to the furnace bottom, and the turntable assumes a horizontal position in operation. The super-strong permanent magnetic swirling agitator is suitable for widely used flat bottomed furnaces. Since the permanent magnetic assembly is composed of NdFeB permanent magnets of high performance and is further located in a non-magnetic safety enclosure, the system has the advantage that the strength of the magnetic field is high, as well as the extent thereof is large. Meanwhile, a yoke and a secondary yoke made of magnetic permeable materials arc used to further increase the strength of magnelic lines of force, thus yielding better effects. Under the actions of the frequency and speed modulation motor which is controlled by the programmable controller according to operational procedures, the super-strong permanent magnetic swirling agitator according to the present invention carries out forward and reverse rotations alternately so as to generate a rotary magnetic field. Thus generated rotary magnetic field causes the molten non-ferrous metal to rotate, swirl and welter in the smelting furnace so as to effect agitation. The cooling system employs an air-cooling mechanism, that is, an axial fan or a centrifugal fan works in the non-magnetic safety enclosure and an air-curtain is formed on the top surface of the non-magnetic safety enclosure by means of ventilation of a vent-pipe which is connected to a high-pressure centrifugal fan, thus to assure that the working temperature of the permanent magnet system is not higher than a predefined temperature, e.g., 42°C. In this way, advantages of safety and reliability are realized. In transmission system, the frequency and speed modulation motor drives the reducer, which is directly connected to the spindle, leading to a simple structure and thus a low failure rate.<br>
The reducer I. the frequency and speed modulation motor 2, the cycloidal pinwheel reducer 4 with a braking motor, the wormwheel-screw lifters 6, the axial fan 7. the height adjusting means, the traveling mechanism, the high-pressure centrifugal fan 11 and the programmable controller 21 are all commercially available, and it is easy for the skilled in the art to implement them, therefore detailed descriptions on their structures and working principles are omitted.<br><br><br>
