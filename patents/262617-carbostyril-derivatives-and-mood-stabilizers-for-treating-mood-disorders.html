DESCRIPTION<br>
CARBOSTYRIL DERIVATIVES AND MOOD STABILIZERS<br>
FOR TREATING MOOD DISORDERS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising carbostyril derivatives that<br>
act as dopamine-serotonin system stabilizers in<br>
combination with mood stabilizers in a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier. The present invention provides<br>
methods to treat mood disorders such as bipolar<br>
disorder with or without psychotic features, mania or<br>
mixed episodes using the compositions of the present<br>
invention or by separately administering these<br>
carbostyril derivatives and mood stabilizers. The<br>
carbostyril derivatives of the present invention<br>
include but are not limited to aripiprazole and<br>
metabolites thereof, such as dehydroaripiprazole. The<br>
mood stabilizers include, but are not limited to,<br>
lithium, valproic acid, divalproex sodium,<br>
carbamazapine, oxcarbamazapine, zonisamide,<br>
lamotragine, topiramate, gabapentin, levetiracetam and<br>
clonazepam.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The number of people with mood disorders,<br>
such as bipolar disorder with or without psychotic<br><br>
2<br>
features, mania or mixed episodes is increasing every<br>
year for numerous reasons. Since the period of 1950,<br>
tricyclic antidepressant drugs (e.g., imipramine,<br>
desipramine, amitriptyline, etc.) have been developed<br>
that act to inhibit monoamine reuptake. They are<br>
frequently used for treating patients suffering from<br>
mood disorders. However, these drugs have side-<br>
effects, such as the following: dry mouth, hazy eyes,<br>
dysuria, constipation, recognition disturbance and the<br>
like due to anticholinergic activity; cardiovascular<br>
side-effects such as, orthostatic hypotension,<br>
tachycardia and the like on the basis of -<br>
adrenoreceptor antagonist activity; side-effects such<br>
as, sedation, increase in the body weight and the like<br>
on the basis of histamine-H1 receptor antagonist<br>
activity.<br>
Although the mood disorders including bipolar<br>
disorder with or without psychotic features, mania or<br>
mixed episodes are heterogeneous diseases, and the<br>
causes of these diseases are not fully understood, it<br>
is likely that the abnormalities of the monoaminergic<br>
central nervous system caused by serotonin,<br>
norepinephrine and dopamine and the like, and the<br>
abnormality of various hormones and peptides as well as<br>
various stressors are causes of depression and various<br>
other mood disorders (Kubota Masaharu et al.: "RINSHOU<br>
SEISHIN IGAKU" Vol. 29, pp 891-899, (2000)). For these<br>
reasons, even though mood stabilizer drugs, such as<br><br>
3<br>
lithium, valproic acid, divalproex sodium,<br>
carbamazapine, oxcarbamazapine, zonisamide,<br>
lamotragine, topiramate, gabapentin, levetiracetam and<br>
clonazepam have been used, these drugs are not always<br>
effective in treating all patients.<br>
New therapeutic trials involve proposed<br>
combined therapies using an atypical antipsychotic<br>
drug, such as olanzepine or quetiapine, which are<br>
agents for treating schizophrenia (anti-psychotic<br>
drug), together with mood stabilizing drug such as<br>
valproate, lithium or divalproex ((Arch. Gen.<br>
Psychiatry, 2002 Jan. 59:l):62-69; J Am Acad Child<br>
Adolesc Psychiatry 2002 Oct; 41(10) :1216-23.)<br>
Further, commercially available atypical<br>
antipsychotic drugs have significant problems relating<br>
to their safety. For example, clozapine, olanzapine<br>
and quetiapine increase body weight and enhance the<br>
risk of diabetes mellitus (Newcomer, J. W. (Supervised<br>
Translated by Aoba Anri): "RINSHOU SEISHIN YAKURI"<br>
Vol. 5, pp 911-925, (2002), Haupt, D. W. and Newcomer,<br>
J. W. (Translated by Fuji Yasuo and Misawa Fuminari):<br>
"RINSHOU SEISHIN YAKURI" Vol. 5, pp 1063-1082, (2002)).<br>
In fact, urgent safety alerts have been issued in Japan<br>
relating to hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis and<br>
diabetic coma caused by olanzapine and quetiapine,<br>
indicating that these drugs were subjected to dosage<br>
contraindication to the patients with diabetes mellitus<br>
and patients having anamnesis of diabetes mellitus.<br><br>
4<br>
Risperidone causes increases serum prolactin levels and<br>
produces extrapyramidal side effects at high dosages.<br>
Ziprasidone enhances the risk of severe arrhythmia on<br>
the basis of cardio-QTc prolongation action. Further,<br>
clozapine induces agranulocytosis, so that clinical use<br>
thereof is strictly restricted (van Kammen, D. P.<br>
(Compiled under Supervision by Murasaki Mitsuroh)<br>
"RINSHOU SEISHIN YAKURI" Vol. 4, pp 483-492, (2001)).<br>
Accordingly what is needed are new<br>
compositions useful for treating mood disorders,<br>
particularly bipolar disorder with or without psychotic<br>
features, mania or mixed episodes, which are<br>
efficacious and do not cause the deleterious side<br>
effects associated with prior art compounds.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention solves the problems<br>
described above by providing novel compositions and<br>
methods of using these compositions for treating mood<br>
disorders, particularly bipolar disorder, including but<br>
not limited to bipolar disorder I, bipolar disorder II,<br>
bipolar disorder with and without psychotic features,<br>
and mania, acute mania, bipolar depression or mixed<br>
episode.<br>
The present invention provides solutions to<br>
the above-mentioned problems, and demonstrates that the<br>
mood disorders, such as bipolar disorder and mania, can<br>
be treated effectively by administering to a patient<br><br>
5<br>
with such disorder a composition comprising at least<br>
one carbostyril derivative that is a dopamine-serotonin<br>
system stabilizer in combination with at least one mood<br>
stabilizer in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A<br>
preferred carbostyril derivative of the present<br>
invention that is a dopamine-serotonin system<br>
stabilizer is aripiprazole or a metabolite thereof.<br>
Another preferred carbostyril derivative of the present<br>
invention that is a dopamine-serotonin system<br>
stabilizer is a metabolite of aripiprazole called<br>
dehydroaripiprazole, also known as OPC-14857. Other<br>
such metabolites of aripiprazole included within the<br>
present invention are shown in Figure 8. Preferred<br>
aripiprazole metabolites are shown in Figure 8<br>
indicated by the following designations: OPC-14857,<br>
DM-1458, DM-1451, DM-1452, DM-1454 and DCPP.<br>
Aripiprazole, also called 7-{4-[4- (2,3-<br>
dichlorophenyl)-l-piperazinyl butoxy}-3,4-dihydro-<br>
2(1H)-quinolinone, is a carbostyril and is useful for<br>
treating schizophrenia (JP-A-2-191256, U.S. Patent<br>
5,006,528). Aripiprazole is also known as 7-[4-[4-<br>
(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl butoxy -3,4-<br>
dihydrocarbostyril, Abilify, OPC-14597, OPC-31 and BMS-<br>
337039. Aripiprazole possesses 5-HT1A receptor agonist<br>
activity, and is known as a useful compound for<br>
treating types of depression and refractory depression,<br>
such as endogenous depression, major depression,<br>
melancholia and the like (WO 02/060423A2; Jordan et al<br><br>
6<br>
U.S. Patent Application 2002/0173513A1)). Aripiprazole<br>
has activity as an agonist at serotonin receptors and<br>
dopamine receptors, and acts as an agonist or partial<br>
agonist at the serotonin 5HT1A receptor and as an<br>
agonist or partial agonist at the dopamine D2 receptor.<br>
Aripiprazole is a dopamine-serotonin system stabilizer.<br>
Metabolites of aripiprazole are included within the<br>
scope of the present invention. One such metabolite of<br>
aripiprazole is called dehydroaripiprazole. Other such<br>
metabolites of aripiprazole included within the present<br>
invention are shown in Figure 8. Preferred metabolites<br>
are shown in Figure 8 indicated by the following<br>
designations: OPC-14857, DM-1458, DM-1451, DM-1452,<br>
DM-1454 and DCPP.<br>
The- at least one mood stabilizer used in the<br>
present invention includes but is not limited to the<br>

All of the aforementioned carbostyril derivatives may<br>
be used as a first component in the practice of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Aripiprazole, also called 7-{4-[4-(2,3-<br>
dichlorophenyl)-l-piperazinyl butoxy}-3,4-dihydro-<br>
2(1H)-quinolinone, is a carbostyril compound useful as<br>
the effective ingredient for treating schizophrenia<br>
(JP-A-2-191256, U.S. Patent 5,006,528). Aripiprazole<br>
is also known as 7-[4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1-<br>
piperazinyl butoxy -3,4-dihydrocarbostyril, Abilify,<br>
OPC-14597, OPC-31 and BMS-337039. Aripiprazole<br>
possesses 5-HT1A receptor agonist activity, and is known<br>
as a useful compound for treating types of depression<br>
and refractory depression, such as endogenous<br>
depression, major depression, melancholia and the like<br>
(WO 02/060423A2; Jordan et al. U.S. Patent Application<br>
2002/0173513A1). Aripiprazole has activity as an<br>
agonist at serotonin receptors and dopamine receptors,<br>
and acts as an agonist or partial agonist at the<br>
serotonin 5HTlA receptor and as an agonist or partial<br>
agonist at the dopamine D2 receptor.<br>
Aripiprazole is an antipsychotic drug having<br>
new mechanism of action which is different from that of<br><br>
19<br>
other atypical antipsychotic drugs. The available<br>
typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs act as<br>
antagonists at the dopamine-D2 receptors. In contrast,<br>
aripiprazole acts as a partial agonist at the dopamine<br>
D2 receptor (Ishigooka Jyunya and Inada Ken: RINSHO<br>
SEISHIN YAKURI, Vol. 4, pp 1653-1664, (2001); Burris,<br>
K. D. et al.: J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 302, pp 381-<br>
389, (2002)). In addition to the partial agonist<br>
action at dopamine-D2 receptors, aripiprazole has<br>
activity as a partial agonist at the serotonin 5-HT1A<br>
receptor, as well as antagonist action serotonin 5-HT2A<br>
receptors. Accordingly, aripiprazole is a drug<br>
belonging to new category defined as a dopamine-<br>
serotonin system stabilizer (dopamine-serotonin nervous<br>
system stabilizer (Burris, K. D. et al., J. Pharmacol.<br>
Exp. Ther., 302, pp 381-389, 2002; Jordan, S. et al.,<br>
Eur. J. Pharmacol. 441, pp 137-140, 2002).<br>
Methods of Preparing Aripiprazole<br>
Aripiprazole and aripiprazole metabolites to<br>
be used in the present invention may be any of form,<br>
for example, free bases, polymorphisms of every type of<br>
crystal, hydrate, salt (acid addition salts, etc.) and<br>
the like. Among of these forms, aripiprazole anhydride<br>
crystals B is a preferred form.<br>
As to method for preparing the aripiprazole<br>
anhydride crystals B, for example it is prepared by<br>
heating aripiprazole hydrate A as follows.<br><br>
20<br>

Method for Preparing Aripiprazol Hydrate A<br>
Aripiprazole hydrate A is prepared by milling<br>
conventional aripiprazole hydrate. Conventional<br>
milling methods can be used to mill conventional<br>
aripiprazole hydrate. For example, conventional<br>
aripiprazole hydrate can be milled in a milling<br>
machine. A widely used milling machine such as an<br>
atomizer, pin mill, jet mill or ball mill can be used.<br>
Among of these, the atomizer is preferably used.<br>
Regarding the specific milling conditions<br>
when using an atomizer, a rotational speed of 5000-<br>
15000 rpm could be used for the main axis, for example,<br>
with a feed rotation of 10-30 rpm and a screen hole<br>
size of 1-5 mm.<br>
The mean particle size of the aripiprazole<br>
hydrate A obtained by milling may be normally 50 m or<br>
less, preferably 30 m or less. Mean particle size can<br>
be ascertained by the particle size measuring method<br>
described hereinafter.<br>

1.78 ppm (m, 2H), 2.35-2.46 ppm (m, 4H), 2.48-2.56 ppm<br>
(m, 4H + DMSO), 2.78 ppm (t, J = 7.4 Hz, 2H), 2.97 ppm<br>
(brt, J = 4.6 Hz, 4H), 3.92 ppm (t, J = 6.3 Hz, 2H),<br>
6.43 ppm (d, J = 2.4 Hz, 1H), 6.49 ppm (dd, J = 8.4 Hz,<br>
J = 2.4 Hz, 1H), 7.04 ppm (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 1H), 7.11-<br>
7.17 ppm (m, 1H), 7.28-7.32 ppm (m, 2H) and 10.00 ppm<br>
(s, 1H).<br>
(7)	They have a powder x-ray diffraction<br>
spectrum which is substantially identical to the powder<br>
x-ray diffraction spectrum shown in<br>
Figure 5. Specifically, they have characteristic peaks<br>
at 2 = 11.0°, 16.6°, 19.3°, 20.3° and 22.1°.<br>
(8)	They have clear infrared absorption bands<br>
at 2945, 2812, 1678, 1627, 1448, 1377, 1173, 960 and<br>
779 cm-1 on the IR (KBr) spectrum.<br>
(9)	They exhibit an endothermic peak near<br>
about 141.5°C in thermogravimetric/differential thermal<br>
analysis (heating rate 5°C/min).<br>
(10)	They exhibit an endothermic peak near<br>

solid preparation, such as tablets and other solid dose<br>
formulations including for example flash melt<br>
formulations, the mean particle size is preferably 50<br>
m or less.<br>
Method for Preparing Aripiprazole Anhydride Crystals B<br>
The aripiprazole anhydride crystals B of the<br>
present invention are prepared, for example, by heating<br>
the aforementioned aripiprazole hydrate A at 90-125°C.<br>
The heating time is generally about 3-50 hours, but<br>
cannot be stated unconditionally, because it differs<br>
depending on heating temperature. The heating time and<br>
heating temperature are inversely related, so that for<br>
example when the heating time is longer, then the<br>
heating temperature is lower, and when the heating<br>
temperature is higher then the heating time is shorter.<br>
Specifically, if the heating temperature of<br>
aripiprazole hydrate A is 100°C, the heating time may<br>
be 18 hours or more, or preferably about 24 hours. If<br>
the heating temperature of aripiprazole hydrate A is<br>
120°C, on the other hand, the heating time may be about<br>
3 hours. The aripiprazole anhydride crystals B of the<br>
present invention can be prepared with certainty by<br>
heating aripiprazole hydrate A for about 18 hours at<br>
100°C, and then heating it for about 3 hours at 120°C.<br>
The aripiprazole anhydride crystals B of the present<br>
invention can also be obtained if the heating time is<br>
extended still further, but this method may not be<br><br>
24<br>
economical.<br>
When small particle size is not required for<br>
the formulation, e.g., when drug substance is being<br>
prepared for injectable or oral solution formulations,<br>
aripiprazole anhydride crystals B can be also obtained<br>
by the following process.<br>
Aripiprazole anhydride crystals B of the<br>
present invention are prepared for example by heating<br>
conventional aripiprazole anhydride crystals at 90-<br>
125°C. The heating time is generally about 3-50 hours,<br>
but cannot be stated unconditionally because it differs<br>
depending on heating temperature. The heating time and<br>
heating temperature are inversely related, so that for<br>
example if the heating time is longer, the heating<br>
temperature is lower, and if the heating time is<br>
shorter, the heating temperature is higher.<br>
Specifically, if the heating temperature of the<br>
aripiprazole anhydride crystals is 100o C, the heating<br>
time may be about 4 hours, and if the heating<br>
temperature is 120°C the heating time may be about 3<br>
hours.<br>
Further more, aripiprazole anhydride crystals<br>
B of the present invention are prepared for example, by<br>
heating conventional aripiprazole hydrate at 90-125° C.<br>
The heating time is generally about 3-50 hours, but<br>
cannot be stated unconditionally because it differs<br>
depending on heating temperature. The heating time and<br>
heating temperature are inversely related, so that for<br><br>
25<br>
example, if the heating time is longer, the heating<br>
temperature is lower, and if the heating time is<br>
shorter, the heating temperature is higher.<br>
Specifically, if the heating temperature of the<br>
aripiprazole hydrate is 100°C, the heating time may be<br>
about 24 hours, and if the heating temperature is 120°C<br>
the heating time may be about 3 hours.<br>
The aripiprazole anhydride crystals which are<br>
the raw material for preparing tne aripiprazole<br>
anhydride crystals B of the present invention are<br>
prepared for example by Method A or B below.<br>
Method A: Process for Preparing Crude Crystals of<br>
Aripiprazole<br>
Conventional aripiprazole anhydride crystals<br>
are prepared by well-known methods, as described in<br>
Example 1 of Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.<br>
191256/1990. 7-(4-bromobutoxy)-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril,<br>
is reacted with 1-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)piperazine and<br>
the thus obtained crude aripiprazole crystals are re-<br>
crystallized from ethanol.<br>
Method B: Process for Preparing Conventional<br>
Aripiprazole Anhydride<br>
The Method B is described in the Proceedings<br>
of the 4th Joint Japanese-Korean Symposium on<br>
Separation Technology (October 6-8, 1996). The<br>
aripiprazole hydrate which is the raw material for<br><br>
26<br>
preparing the aripiprazole anhydride crystals B of the<br>
present invention is prepared for example by Method C<br>
below.<br>
Method C: Method for Preparing Conventional<br>
Aripiprazole Hydrate<br>
Aripiprazole hydrate is easily obtained by<br>
dissolving tne aripiprazole anhydride crystals obtained<br>
by Method A above in a hydrous solvent, and heating and<br>
then cooling the resulting solution. Using this<br>
method, aripiprazole hydrate is precipitated as<br>
crystals in the hydrous solvent.<br>
An organic solvent containing water is<br>
usually used as the hydrous solvent. The organic<br>
solvent may be preferable one which is miscible with<br>
water, for example an alcohol such as methanol,<br>
ethanol, propanol or isopropanol, a ketone such as<br>
acetone, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dimethylformamide, or a mixture thereof, ethanol is<br>
particularly desirable. The amount of water in the<br>
hydrous solvent may be 10-25% by volume of the solvent,<br>
or preferably close to 20% by volume.<br>
Aripiprazole can easily form an acid addition<br>
salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid. As to<br>
such acid, for example, an inorganic acid, such as,<br>
sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid,<br>
phosphoric acid, hydrobromic acid, etc.; an organic<br>
acid such as, acetic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid,<br><br>
27<br>
methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, fumaric<br>
acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic<br>
acid, etc. can be exemplified. Similar to aripiprazole<br>
of free forms, these acid addition salts can also be<br>
used as the active ingredient compounds in the present<br>
invention.<br>
The objective compound thus obtained through<br>
each one of production steps, is separated from the<br>
reaction system by usual separation means, and can be<br>
further purified. As to the separation and<br>
purification means, for example, distillation method,<br>
solvent extraction method, dilution method, re-<br>
crystallization method, column chromatography, ion-<br>
exchange chromatography, gel chromatography, affinity<br>
chromatography, preparative thin-layer chromatography<br>
and the like can be exemplified.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition: the second ingredient<br>
In the composition of the present invention,<br>
a mood stabilizer is used as the second ingredient.<br>
Compounds which function as mood stabilizers can be<br>
widely used as the mood stabilizers and are known to<br>
one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
A non-limiting list of mood stabilizers which<br>
may be used in the present invention includes, lithium,<br>
valproic acid, divalproex sodium, carbamazapine,<br>
oxcarbamazapine, zonisamide, lamotragine, topiramate,<br>
gabapentin, levetiracetam and clonazepam.<br><br>
28<br>
The mood stabilizer may be either in the form<br>
of a free base or a salt (an acid addition salt or the<br>
like). Further, the mood stabilizer may be either a<br>
racemic modifications or R and S enantiomers. The mood<br>
stabilizers may be either a single use of one mood<br>
stabilizer, and in case of need, two or more of the<br>
mood stabilizers may be used in combination. Use of<br>
one mood stabilizer is preferred.<br>
The mood stabilizer can easily form an acid<br>
addition salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid.<br>
As to such acid, for example, an inorganic acid, such<br>
as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid,<br>
phosphoric acid, hydrobromic acid, etc.; an organic<br>
acid such as, acetic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid,<br>
methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, fumaric<br>
acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic<br>
acid, etc. can be exemplified. Similar to the reuptake<br>
inhibitor of free forms, these acid addition salts can<br>
also be used as the active ingredient compounds in the<br>
present invention.<br>
Among the mood stabilizers, a compound having<br>
an acidic group can easily form salt by reacting with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable basic compound. As to such<br>
basic compound, a metal hydroxide, for example, sodium<br>
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide,<br>
calcium hydroxide and the like; an alkali metal<br>
carbonate or bicarbonate, for example sodium carbonate,<br>
potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate,<br><br>
29<br>
potassium hydrogencarbonate and the like; a metal<br>
alcoholate, for example sodium methylate, potassium<br>
ethylate and the like can be exemplified.<br>
The thus obtained salt form of mood<br>
stabilizer is separated from the reaction system by<br>
usual separation means, and can be further purified.<br>
As to the separation and purification means, for<br>
example, distillation method, solvent extraction<br>
method, dilution method, recrystallization method,<br>
column chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, gel<br>
chromatography, affinity chromatography, preparative<br>
thin-layer chromatography and the like can be<br>
exemplified.<br>
Combination of the first ingredient with the second<br>
ingredient<br>
As to pharmaceutical compositions comprising<br>
a combination of carbostyril derivatives with activity<br>
as dopamine-serotonin stabilizers, and mood<br>
stabilizers, non-limiting examples of aripiprazole and<br>
dehydroaripiprazole are described herein. It is to be<br>
understood that the present invention also comprises a<br>
combination of carbostyril derivatives with activity as<br>
dopamine-serotonin stabilizers, and mood stabilizers,<br>
wherein the carbostyril derivatives are other<br>
metabolites of aripiprazole described herein.<br>
When aripiprazole is combined with at least<br>
one mood stabilizer, the following are non-limiting<br><br>
30<br>
examples of such combinations: aripiprazole/lithium,<br>
aripiprazole/valproic acid, aripiprazole/divalproex<br>

aripiprazole/oxcarbamazapine, aripiprazole/zonisamide,<br>
aripiprazole/lamotragine, aripiprazole/topiramate,<br>
aripiprazole/gabapentin, aripiprazole/levetiracetam and<br>
aripiprazole/clonazepam. Among these combinations, the<br>
following are particularly preferable:<br>

aripiprazole/lamotragine, aripiprazole/topiramate,<br>
aripiprazole/gabapentin, aripiprazole/levetiracetam and<br>
aripiprazole/clonazepam. The pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising the above preferable combination<br>
possesses excellent efficacy. Therefore such<br>
composition has fewer side-effects and an excellent<br>
safety profile.<br>
In another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, aripiprazole, or a metabolite thereof may be<br>
combined with more than one mood stabilizer.<br>
Metabolites of aripiprazole that may be used in the<br>
present invention include, but are not limited to, OPC-<br>
14857, DM-1458, DM-1451, DM-1452, DM-1454 and DCPP as<br>
shown in Figure 8. Any one of these metabolites may be<br>
used in the present invention. The following sentences<br>
describe a combination of dehydroaripiprazole with<br>
specific mood stabilizers, however it is to be<br>
understood that any one of DM-1458, DM-1451, DM-1452,<br><br>
31<br>
DM-1454 or DCPP, as shown in Figure 8, could be<br>
substituted for dehydroaripiprazole in these disclosed<br>
combinations. Dehydroaripiprazole (also called OPC-<br>
14857 in Figure 8) is a preferred metabolite of<br>
aripiprazole. As to the combination of<br>
dehydroaripiprazole with one or more mood stabilizers,<br>
the following are non-limiting examples of such<br>
combinations: dehydroaripiprazole/lithium,<br>
dehydroaripiprazole/valproic acid,<br>

composition of the present invention are suitably<br>
selected from a wide range depending on the diseases to<br>
be treated. Generally, about 1 to 70 parts by weight,<br>
preferably about 1 to 30 parts by weight of the first<br>
ingredient and the second ingredient are combined in<br>
the total amount on the basis of the pharmaceutical<br>
composition.<br>
The methods for administration of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition of the present invention are<br>
not specifically restricted. The composition is<br>
administered depending on each type of preparation<br>
form, and the age, gender and other condition of the<br>
patient (degree and conditions of the disease, etc.).<br>
For example, tablets, pills, liquids, suspensions,<br>
emulsions, granules and capsules are administered<br>
orally. In case of injection preparation, it is<br><br>
38<br>
administered intravenously either singly or mixed with<br>
a common auxiliary liquid such as solutions of glucose<br>

mood stabilizer are contained in one pharmaceutical<br>
composition and this composition may be administered.<br>
On the other hand, each one of aripiprazole and a mood<br>
stabilizer are contained individually in a<br>
pharmaceutical preparation respectively, and each one<br>
of these preparations may be administered at the same<br>
or at different times.<br>
Dosage of the pharmaceutical composition of<br>
the present invention for treating and improving mood<br>
disorders may be used relatively in a small amount,<br>
because the composition possesses excellent efficacy.<br>
Therefore the composition has fewer side-effects and an<br>
excellent safety profile.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present<br>
invention can be manifest in a wide range of<br>
neurotransmission accommodation actions. As a result,<br>
the composition of the present invention establishes<br><br>

The present invention will be explained more<br>
in detail by illustrating Reference Examples, Example<br>
and Formulation Sample Examples. First, analytical<br>
methods are explained.<br>
Analytical Methods<br>
(1)	The 1H-NMR spectrum was measured in DMSO-<br>
d6 by using TMS as the standard.<br>
(2)	Powder X-ray Diffraction<br>
By using RAD-2B diffraction meter<br>
manufactured by Rigaku Denki, the powder x-ray<br>
diffraction pattern was measured at room temperature by<br>
using a Cu Ka filled tube (35 kV 20mA) as the x-ray<br>
source with a wide-angle goniometer, a 1° scattering<br><br>
41<br>
slit, an 0.15 mm light-intercepting slit, a graphite<br>
secondary monochromator and a scintillation counter.<br>
Data collection was done in 20 continuous scan mode at a<br>
scan speed of 5°/minute in scan steps of 0.02° in the<br>
range of 3° to 40°.<br>
(3)	The IR spectrum was measured by the KBr<br>
method.<br>
(4)	Thermogravimetric/Differential Thermal<br>
Analysis<br>
Thermogravimetric/differential thermal<br>
analysis was measured by using SSC 5200 control unit<br>
and TG/DTA 220 simultaneous differential<br>
thermal/thermogravimetric measuring unit manufactured<br>
by Seiko Corp. Samples (5 - 10 mg) were placed in open<br>
aluminum pans and heated at from 20°C to 200°C in a dry<br>
nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 5°C/minute.<br>
-Alumina was used as the standard substance.<br>
(5)	Differential Scanning Calorimetry<br>
Thermogravimetric/differential thermal<br>
analysis was measured by using SSC 5200 control unit<br>
and DSC 220C differential scanning calorimeter<br>
manufactured by Seiko Corp. Samples (5 - 10 mg) were<br>
placed in crimped aluminum pans and heated from 20°C to<br>
200°C in a dry nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of<br>
5°C/minute. -Alumina was used as the standard<br>
substance.<br>
(6)	Particle Size Measurement<br>
The particles (0.1 g) to be measured were<br><br>
42<br>
suspended in a 20 ml n-hexane solution of 0.5 g soy<br>
lecithin, and particle size was manufactured by using a<br>
size distribution measuring meter (Microtrack HRA,<br>
manufactured by Microtrack Co.).<br>
Reference Example 1<br>
7- (4-Chlorobutoxy)-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril<br>
(19.4 g) and monohydrochloride 16.2 g of l-(2,3-<br>
dichlorophenyl) piperadine 1 hydrochloride were added<br>
to a solution of 8.39 g of potassium carbonate<br>
dissolved in 140 ml of water, and refluxed for 3 hours<br>
under agitation. After the reaction was complete, the<br>
mixture was cooled and the precipitated crystals<br>
collected by filtration. These crystals were dissolved<br>
in 350 ml of ethyl acetate, and about 210 ml of<br>
water/ethyl acetate azeotrope was removed under reflux.<br>
The remaining solution was cooled, and the precipitated<br>
crystals were collected by filtration. The resulting<br>
crystals were dried at 60°C for 14 hours to obtain 20.4<br>
g (74.2%) of crude product of aripiprazole.<br>
The crude product of aripiprazole (30 g)<br>
obtained above was re-crystallized from 4 50 ml of<br>
ethanol according to the methods described in Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 191256/1990, and the<br>
resulting crystals were dried at 80°C for 40 hours to<br>
obtain aripiprazole anhydride crystals. The yield was<br>
29.4 g (98.0%).<br>
The melting point (mp) of these aripiprazole<br><br>
43<br>
anhydride crystals was 140°C, which is identical to the<br>
melting point of the aripiprazole anhydride crystals<br>
described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.<br>
191256/1990.<br>
Reference Example 2<br>
The crude product of aripiprazole (6930 g)<br>
obtained in Reference Example 1 was heat dissolved by<br>
heating in 138 liters of hydrous ethanol (water content<br>
20% by volume) according to the method presented at the<br>
4th Joint Japanese-Korean Symposium on Separation<br>
Technology, the solution was gradually (2-3 hours)<br>
cooled to room temperature, and then was chilled to<br>
near 0°C. The precipitated crystals were collected by<br>
filtration, about 7200 g of aripiprazole hydrate (wet-<br>
state).<br>
The wet-state aripiprazole hydrate crystals<br>
obtained above were dried at 80°C for 30 hours to<br>
obtain 6480 g (93.5%) of aripiprazole hydrate crystals.<br>
The melting point (mp) of these crystals was 139.5°C.<br>
The water content of the crystals were<br>
confirmed by the Karl Fischer method, the moisture<br>
value was 0.03%, thus the crystals were confirmed as<br>
anhydrous product.<br>
Reference Example 3<br>
The aripiprazole hydrate (820 g) in wet state<br>
obtained from Reference Example 2 was dried at 50°C for<br><br>
44<br>
2 hours to obtain 780 g of aripiprazole hydrate<br>
crystals. The moisture value of the crystals had a<br>
moisture value was 3.82% measured according to the Karl<br>
Fischer method. As shown in Figure 6,<br>
thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis<br>
revealed endothermic peaks at 75.0, 123.5 and 140.5°C.<br>
Because dehydration began near at 70°C, there was no<br>
clear melting point (mp) was observed.<br>
As shown in Figure 7, the powder x-ray<br>
diffraction spectrum of aripiprazole hydrate obtained<br>
by this method exhibited characteristic peaks at 2 =<br>
12.6°, 15.1°, 17.4°, 18.2°, 18.7o, 24.8° and 27.5°.<br>
The powder x-ray diffraction spectrum of this<br>
aripiprazole hydrate was identical to the powder x-ray<br>
diffraction spectrum of aripiprazole hydrate presented<br>
at the 4th Joint Japanese-Korean Symposium on Isolation<br>
Technology.<br>
Reference Example 4<br>
The aripiprazole hydrate crystals (500.3 g)<br>
obtained in Reference Example 3 were milled by using a<br>
sample mill (small size atomizer). The main axis<br>
rotation rate was set to 12,000 rpm and the feed<br>
rotation rate to 17 rpm, and a 1.0 mm herringbone<br>
screen was used. Milling was finished in 3 minutes,<br>
and obtained 474.6 g (94.9%) of aripiprazole hydrate A.<br>
The aripiprazole hydrate A (powder) obtained<br>
in this way had a mean particle size of 20-25 m. The<br><br>
45<br>
melting point (mp) was undetermined because dehydration<br>
was observed beginning near at 70°C.<br>
The aripiprazole hydrate A (powder) obtained<br>
above exhibited an 1H-NMR (DMSO-d6, TMS) spectrum which<br>
was substantially identical to the 1H-NMR spectrum shown<br>
in Figure 2. Specifically, it had characteristic peaks<br>
at 1.55-1.63 ppm (m, 2H), 1.68-1.78 ppm (m, 2H), 2.35-<br>
2.46 ppm (m, 4H), 2.48-2.56 ppm (m, 4H + DMSO), 2.78<br>
ppm (t, J = 7.4 Hz, 2H), 2.97 ppm (brt, J = 4.6 Hz,<br>
4H), 3.92 ppm (t, J = 6.3 Hz, 2H), 6.43 ppm (d, J = 2.4<br>
Hz, 1H), 6.49 ppm (dd, J = 8.4 Hz, J = 2.4 Hz, 1H),<br>
7.04 ppm (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 1H), 7.11-7.17 ppm (m, 1H),<br>
7.28-7.32 ppm (m, 2H) and 10.00 ppm (s, 1H).<br>
The aripiprazole hydrate A (powder) obtained<br>
above had a powder x-ray diffraction spectrum which was<br>
substantially identical to the powder x-ray diffraction<br>
spectrum shown in Figure 3. Specifically, it had<br>
characteristic peaks at 2 = 12.6°, 15.4°, 17.3°, 18.0°,<br>
18.6°, 22.5° and 24.8°. This pattern is different from<br>
the powder x-ray spectrum of unmilled Aripiprazole<br>
hydrate shown in Figure 7.<br>
The aripiprazole hydrate A (powder) obtained<br>
above had infrared absorption bands at 2951, 2822,<br>
1692, 1577, 1447, 1378, 1187, 963 and 784 cm-1 on the IR<br>
(KBr) spectrum.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the aripiprazole<br>
hydrate A (powder) obtained above had a weak peak at<br>
71.3°C in thermogravimetric/differential thermal<br><br>
46<br>
analysis and a broad endothermic peak (weight loss<br>
observed corresponding to one molecule of water)<br>
between 60-120°C which was clearly different from the<br>
endothermic curve of unmilled aripiprazole hydrate (see<br>
Figure 6).<br>

and uses will be apparent to those skilled in the art<br>
and that the invention is not limited to these specific<br>
illustrative examples.<br>

99.3 %) of aripiprazole anhydride Crystals B. These<br>
aripiprazole anhydride crystals  B had a melting point<br>
(mp)  of  139.7°C.<br>
The pripiprazole anhydride crystals B<br>
obtained above had an 1H-NMR spectrum (DMSO-d6, TMS)<br>

vehicle.<br>
1.4	Preparation of Test and Reference Compounds<br>
Test compound was dissolved in 100% dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide (DMSO) to yield 100 M stock solutions (final<br>
concentration of DMSO in all tubes containing test<br>
compound was 1%, v/v). All other reference compounds<br>
were prepared by the same method using double-distilled<br>
water rather than DMSO.<br>
1.5	Experimental Procedure for the [35S GTPS Binding<br>
Assay<br>
Test and reference compounds were studied in<br>
triplicate at 10 different concentrations (0.01, 0.1,<br>
1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 1000, 10000 and 50000 nM) for their<br>
effects upon basal [35S GTPS binding to h5-HT1A CHO cell<br>
membranes. Reactions were performed in 5 ml glass test<br>
tubes containing 8 l of test/reference drug mixed with<br>
792 l of buffer (25 mM Tris HC1, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM<br>
MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, pH=7.4) containing GDP (1 M) ,<br>
[35S GTPS (0.1 nM) and h5-HT1A CHO cell membranes (10 g<br>
protein/reaction; NEN Life Science Products, Boston,<br>
Mass.; catalog #CRM035, lot #501-60024, GenBank #<br><br>
49<br>
X13556). Reactions proceeded for 60 min at room<br>
temperature and were terminated by rapid filtration<br>
through Whatman GF/B filter paper, using a Brandel<br>
harvester and 4x3 ml ice-cold buffer washes. S<br>
radioactivity bound to the filter paper was measured<br>
using liquid scintillation counting (1272 Clinigamma,<br>

=124.9 Ci/mmol) binding to h5-HT1A receptors in CHO cell<br>
membranes (15-20 g protein; NEN Life Science Products,<br>
catalog #CRM035, lot #501-60024). Membranes (396 )<br>
were incubated in 5 ml glass tubes containing [3H 8-OH-<br>
DPAT (396 ) , test compound or vehicle (8 ) and<br>
buffer A (50 mM Tris.HCl, 10 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1%<br>
(w/v) ascorbic acid, pH =7.4). All assays proceeded<br>
for 60 min at room temperature and were terminated by<br>
rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B filter paper<br>
(presoaked in buffer B; 50 mM Tris.HCl, pH=7.4), using<br>
a Brandel harvester and 4x1 ml ice-cold washes with<br>
buffer B. Non-specific binding was determined in the<br>
presence of 10 M (+)8-OH-DPAT.<br><br>
50<br>
1.7 Parameters Determined<br>
Serotonin (5-HT) is a full 5-HT1A receptor<br>
agonist which stimulates increases in basal [35S GTPS<br>
binding to h5-HT1A receptors in recombinant CHO cell<br>
membranes. The test compound was studied at 10<br>
concentrations to determine effects upon basal [35S GTPS<br>
binding relative to that produced by 10 M 5-HT. The<br>
relative potency (EC50, 95% confidence interval) and<br>
intrinsic agonist activity (% of Emax for 10 M 5-HT) was<br>
calculated for each compound by computerized non-linear<br>
regression analysis of complete concentration-effect<br>
data. The binding affinity of test compound at the h5-<br>
HT1A receptor was determined by its ability to prevent<br>
[3H 8-OH-DPAT binding to CHO cell membranes that express<br>
this receptor. Non-linear regression analysis of the<br>
competition binding data was used to calculate an<br>
inhibition constant (IC50, 95% confidence interval),<br>
which is the concentration of test compound that<br>
occupies half of the h5-HT1A sites specifically bound by<br>
[3H 8-OH-DPAT. The affinity of h5-HT1A receptors for<br>
test compound (Ki, 95% confidence interval) was<br>
calculated by the equation, Ki= (IC50) / (1+ ( [ [3H  8-OH-<br>
DPAT /Kd), where the Kd for [3H  8-OH-DPAT at h5-HT1A=0.69<br>
nM (NEN Life Sciences). All estimates of drug binding<br>
affinity, potency and intrinsic efficacy at the h5-HT1A<br>
receptor were calculated using GraphPad Prism version<br>
3.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego,<br>
Calif.).<br><br>
51<br>
2. Results<br>
The test compound and 5-HT produced<br>
concentration-dependent increases above basal [35S GTPS<br>
binding. 1% DMSO tested alone had no effect upon basal<br>
or drug-induced [35S GTPS binding.<br>
The test compound (EC50=2.12 nM) , 5-HT (EC50=<br>
3.67 nM) , potently stimulated basal [35S GTPS binding.<br>
Potency and intrinsic agonist efficacy estimates were<br>
derived by non-linear regression analysis with<br>
correlation coefficients (r2)&gt;0.98 in each case (Table<br>
1). The test compound exerted partial agonist<br>
efficacies in the 65-70% range. WAY-100635 produced no<br>
significant change (unpaired Student's t-test) in basal<br>
[35S  GTPS 5 binding at all concentrations tested (Table<br>
1). WAY-100635 did, however, completely inhibit the<br>
effects of 5-HT and test compound upon [35S GTPS binding<br>
to h5-HT1A receptors in CHO cell membranes (Table 2).<br>
Tables 1 and 2 are shown below.<br>
The test compound demonstrated high affinity<br>
binding to h5-HT1A receptors in CHO cell membranes<br>
(IC504.03 nM, 95% confidence interval=2.67 to 6.08 nM;<br>
Ki=1.65 nM, 95% confidence interval=1.09 to 2.48.<br><br>

Method of Treatment of Patients with a New Diagnosis,<br>
Recurrent or Refractory Episode of Bipolar Disorder (I<br>
or II) with or without psychotic features, manic or<br>
mixed episode as defined by DSM -IV-R criteria.<br>
A combination of aripiprazole, or an<br>
aripiprazole metabolite, and at least one mood<br>
stabilizer is evaluated as a therapy for patients with<br><br>
61<br>
a new diagnosis, recurrent or refractory episode of<br>
bipolar disorder (I or II), acute mania, or bipolar<br>
depression. Patients ranging in age from 18 to 65<br>
years who are diagnosed with bipolar disorder (I or<br>
II), acute mania, or bipolar depression are evaluated<br>
to ensure that they have a baseline Young Mania Rating<br>
Scale (YMRS) score of greater than 24. Only patients<br>
with this YMRS score receive treatment. These patients<br>
are interviewed to obtain a complete medical and<br>
psychiatric history. Aripiprazole, or an aripiprazole<br>
metabolite, is first administered at a dose of 10<br>
mg/day and increased to 30 mg/day as needed in the<br>
opinion of the monitoring psychiatrist. Aripiprazole,<br>
or an aripiprazole metabolite, is administered to these<br>
patients at a dose of from 10 mg/day to 30 mg/day for a<br>
period of at least four weeks, and up to eight weeks<br>
for patients who respond well to this treatment during<br>
the first four weeks. The aripiprazole, or the<br>
aripiprazole metabolite, is administered together with<br>
at least one mood stabilizer, wherein the mood<br>
stabilizer is lithium, valproic acid, divalproex<br>
sodium, carbamazapine, oxcarbamazapine, zonisamide,<br>
lamotragine, topiramate, gabapentin, levetiracetam or<br>
clonazepam.<br>
The aripiprazole, or the aripiprazole<br>
metabolite, can be administered in one dosage form, for<br>
example a tablet, and the mood stabilizer may be<br>
administered in a separate dosage form, for example a<br><br>
62<br>
tablet. The administration may occur at about the same<br>
time or at different times during the day. Dosages may<br>
be within the ranges provided above for each of<br>
aripiprazole, an aripiprazole metabolite and for the<br>
mood stabilizer.<br>
Alternatively, a dosage form containing<br>
aripiprazole, or an aripiprazole metabolite, in<br>
administered in combination with at least one mood<br>
stabilizer and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
Such combinations include without limitation the<br>
following: aripiprazole/lithium, aripiprazole/valproic<br>
acid, aripiprazole/divalproex sodium,<br>
aripiprazole/carbamazapine,<br>
aripiprazole/oxcarbamazapine, aripiprazole/zonisamide,<br>
aripiprazole/lamotragine, aripiprazole/topiramate,<br>
aripiprazole/gabapentin, aripiprazole/levetiracetarn and<br>
aripiprazole/clonazepam. An improvement in alleviation<br>
of symptoms of bipolar disorder (I or II), acute mania,<br>
or bipolar depression is observed in these patients<br>
following administration of aripiprazole, or<br>
aripiprazole metabolite, and the one or more mood<br>
stabilizers, as shown by results of testing performed<br>
during and after the duration of administration of<br>
aripiprazole, or an aripiprazole metabolite, and the<br>
mood stabilizer. The YMRS and other measures such as<br>
CGI, AIMS, SAS, Simpson &amp; Angus and Barnes, commonly<br>
known to one of ordinary skill in the art, are<br>
administered to these patients. Results demonstrate a<br><br>
63<br>
normalization of mood.<br>
Example 5<br>
Efficacy of Aripiprazole in combination with valproate<br>
or lithium in the treatment of mania in patients<br>
partially nonresponsive to valproate or lithium<br>
monotherapy.<br>
A 6-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-<br>
controlled trial is conducted to determine the efficacy<br>
of combined therapy with aripiprazole and either<br>
valproate or lithium compared with valproate or lithium<br>
alone in treating acute manic or mixed bipolar<br>
episodes. The methods used are generally as described<br>
in Tohen et al., (Arch. Gen. Psychiatry, 2002<br>
Jan;59(1):62-9). The objective is to evaluate the<br>
efficacy of aripiprazole (1-30 mg/day) vs placebo when<br>
added to ongoing mood-stabilizer therapy as measured by<br>
reductions in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores.<br>
Patients with bipolar disorder, manic or mixed episode,<br>
who are inadequately responsive to more than 2 weeks of<br>
lithium (600 mg/day) or valproate (500 mg/day) therapy,<br>
are randomized to receive cotherapy (aripiprazole +<br>
mood-stabilizer) or monotherapy (placebo + mood-<br>
stabilizer). The results indicate that aripiprazole<br>
cotherapy improves patients' YMRS total scores more<br>
than monotherapy. Clinical response rates (&gt; or = 50%<br>
improvement on YMRS) are higher with cotherapy.<br>
Aripiprazole cotherapy improves 21-item Hamilton<br><br>
64<br>
Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-21) total scores more<br>
than monotherapy. In patients with mixed-episodes with<br>
moderate to severe depressive symptoms (DSM-IV mixed<br>
episode; HAMD-21 score of &gt; or = 20 at baseline),<br>
aripiprazole cotherapy improves HAMD-21 scores compared<br>
to monotherapy. Extrapyramidal symptoms (Simpson-Angus<br>
Scale, Barnes Akathisia Scale, Abnormal Involuntary<br>
Movement Scale) are not significantly changed from<br>
baseline to end point in either treatment group.<br>
Compared with the use of valproate or lithium alone,<br>
the addition of aripiprazole provided superior efficacy<br>
in the treatment of manic and mixed bipolar episodes.<br>
Example 6<br>
Efficacy of Dehydroaripiprazole in combination with<br>
valproate or lithium in the treatment of mania in<br>
patients partially nonresponsive to valproate or<br>
lithium monotherapy.<br>
A 6-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-<br>
controlled trial is conducted to determine the efficacy<br>
of combined therapy with dehydroaripiprazole and either<br>
valproate or lithium, compared with valproate or<br>
lithium alone, in treating acute manic or mixed bipolar<br>
episodes. The methods used are generally as described<br>
in Tohen et al., (Arch. Gen. Psychiatry, 2002<br>
Jan;59(1):62-9). The objective is to evaluate the<br>
efficacy of dehydroaripiprazole (1-30 mg/day) vs<br>
placebo when added to ongoing mood-stabilizer therapy<br><br>
65<br>
as measured by reductions in Young Mania Rating Scale<br>
(YMRS) scores. Patients with bipolar disorder, manic<br>
or mixed episode, who are inadequately responsive to<br>
more than 2 weeks of lithium (600 mg/day) or valproate<br>
(500 mg/day) therapy, are randomized to receive<br>
cotherapy (dehydroaripiprazole + mood-stabilizer) or<br>
monotherapy (placebo + mood-stabilizer). The results<br>
indicate that dehydroaripiprazole cotherapy improves<br>
patients' YMRS total scores more than monotherapy.<br>
Clinical response rates (&gt; or = 50% improvement on<br>
YMRS) are higher with cotherapy. Dehydroaripiprazole<br>
cotherapy improves 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating<br>
Scale (HAMD-21) total scores more than monotherapy. In<br>
patients with mixed-episodes with moderate to severe<br>
depressive symptoms (DSM-IV mixed episode; HAMD-21<br>
score of &gt; or = 20 at baseline), dehydroaripiprazole<br>
cotherapy improves HAMD-21 scores compared to<br>
monotherapy. Extrapyramidal symptoms (Simpson-Angus<br>
Scale, Barnes Akathisia Scale, Abnormal Involuntary<br>
Movement Scale) are not significantly changed from<br>
baseline to end point in either treatment group.<br>
Compared with the use of valproate or lithium alone,<br>
the addition of dehydroaripiprazole provided superior<br>
efficacy in the treatment of manic and mixed bipolar<br>
episodes.<br>
Example 7<br>
A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of<br><br>
66<br>
Aripiprazole as adjunctive treatment for adolescent<br>
mania.<br>
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-<br>
controlled study examines the efficacy and tolerability<br>
of aripiprazole in combination with divalproex (DVP)<br>
for acute mania in adolescents with bipolar disorder.<br>
The methods employed are essentially as described by<br>
Delbello et al., (J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc.<br>
Psychiatry, 2002 Oct;41(10):1216-23). It is<br>
hypothesized that DVP in combination with aripiprazole<br>
is more effective than DVP alone for treating mania<br>
associated with adolescent bipolar disorder. Thirty<br>
manic or mixed bipolar I adolescents (12-18 years)<br>
receive an initial DVP dose of 20 mg/kg and are<br>
randomly assigned to 6 weeks of combination therapy<br>
with aripiprazole, about 10 mg/day or placebo. Primary<br>
efficacy measures are change from baseline to endpoint<br>
in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score and YMRS<br>
response rate. Safety and tolerability are assessed<br>
weekly. The DVP + aripiprazole group demonstrates a<br>
greater reduction in YMRS scores from baseline to<br>
endpoint than the DVP + placebo group. Moreover, YMRS<br>
response rate is significantly greater in the DVP +<br>
aripiprazole group than in the DVP + placebo group. No<br>
significant group differences from baseline to endpoint<br>
in safety measures are noted. Sedation, rated as mild<br>
or moderate, is more common in the DVP + aripiprazole<br>
group than in the DVP + placebo group. The results<br><br>
67<br>
indicate that aripiprazole in combination with DVP is<br>
more effective for the treatment of adolescent bipolar<br>
mania than DVP alone. In addition, the results suggest<br>
that aripiprazole is well tolerated when used in<br>
combination with DVP for the treatment of mania.<br>
Example 8<br>
A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of<br>
Dehydroaripiprazole as adjunctive treatment for<br>
adolescent mania.<br>
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-<br>
controlled study examines the efficacy and tolerability<br>
of dehydroaripiprazole in combination with divalproex<br>
(DVP) for acute mania in adolescents with bipolar<br>
disorder. The methods employed are essentially as<br>

hypothesized that DVP in combination with<br>
dehydroaripiprazole is more effective than DVP alone<br>
for treating mania associated with adolescent bipolar<br>
disorder. Thirty manic or mixed bipolar I adolescents<br>
(12-18 years) receive an initial DVP dose of 20 mg/kg<br>
and are randomly assigned to 6 weeks of combination<br>
therapy with dehydroaripiprazole, about 10 mg/day or<br>
placebo. Primary efficacy measures are change from<br>
baseline to endpoint in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)<br>
score and YMRS response rate. Safety and tolerability<br>
are assessed weekly. The DVP + dehydroaripiprazole<br><br>
68<br>
group demonstrates a greater reduction in YMRS scores<br>
from baseline to endpoint than the DVP + placebo group.<br>
Moreover, YMRS response rate is significantly greater<br>
in the DVP + dehydroaripiprazole group than in the DVP<br>
+ placebo group. No significant group differences from<br>
baseline to endpoint in safety measures are noted.<br>
Sedation, rated as mild or moderate, is more common in<br>
the DVP + dehydroaripiprazole group than in the DVP +<br>
placebo group. The results indicate that<br>
dehydroaripiprazole in combination with DVP is more<br>
effective for the treatment of adolescent bipolar mania<br>
than DVP alone. In addition, the results suggest that<br>
aripiprazole is well tolerated when used in combination<br>
with DVP for the treatment of mania.<br>
