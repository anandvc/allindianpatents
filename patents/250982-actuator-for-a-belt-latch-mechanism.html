				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an actuator which, is used in a belt latch mechanism of restraint systems in motor vehicles and indicates the proper locking of the tongue of the safety belt when the tongue is inserted into the belt latch mechanism.<br>
Well-known from the DE 43 38 485 Al is a safety belt lock with a microswitch provided for the fail-safe query, whereby the microswitch is coupled so with two functional parts separately involved in the locking procedure of the lock, that the microswitch only takes up its closed position and the position provided for the triggering other functional elements of the safety system, at the two contact points of the lock being in the locking position at the same time.<br>
Also known in the field is an actuator by Eduard Hartmann GmbH which is used in belt latch mechanisms. This actuator is a double-contact actuator, which has contact springs and tongues respectively that, in unstressed state, rest against each other at the contact points and render the contact. One of the two tongues is provided in the form of double-contact tongue to enhance positive actuation. The actuator is provided in such a form that it is arranged laterally in the belt latch mechanism and in such a way that while the belt tongue is inserted a slide made of an insulating material, is pushed between the contact tongues. When the belt tongue has engaged this slide remains between the contact tongues of the actuator and thus separates the contact. This indicates that the safety belt has been applied and properly locked in the belt latch mechanism.<br>
Since the housing of the actuator is open at the top to allow the slide of insulating material to move between the contact tongues, foreign matter, such as liquids or solid particles, may enter through the opening of the belt latch mechanism housing. This may affect the safety function because a contact separation erroneously signals a proper locking of the belt tongue in the lock.<br>
The contact tongues are bent outwardly in the upper area to facilitate the insertion of the slide between the contact zones. Thus, a near V-shape is produced in the upper area. Any penetrating foreign matter deposits in this area and is pushed by the slide directly into the contact area.<br>
In addition no automatic assembly is possible when this actuator is manufactured because the contact tongues have to be connected with cables before they can be inserted in the actuator housing, and the tongues are designed so that they are under a certain prestress once they have been fitted. With the cables connected the contact tongues have to be mainly inserted by hand into the actuator housing.<br>
It is therefore an underlying object of the invention to provide an actuator for a belt latch mechanism of safety belt systems in motor vehicles in such form that the contact area is largely protected against penetrating foreign matter and suitable for a fully automatic assembly in the manufacturing process of the actuator with a subsequent mostly automatic connection of the cable.<br>
According to the invention the task is solved in that the actuator is provided in the form of a double-contact actuator, whereby the contact steel plates are arranged in a contact space that is closed at the top, and the contact can be actuated by a slide by moving this slide into a channel situated to the side of the inner space of the housing.<br>
The actuator may be provided as break or make contact. If the actuator comes as a break contact, the contact steel plates intersect, whereby the contact can be separated by the slide that acts on a contact spring. If the actuator comes as a make contact, the contact steel plates do not intersect, whereby the contact can be closed by the slide that acts on a contact spring.<br>
The contact steel plate that is not actuated by the slide is provided in the form of a fixed-contact steel plate, whereby as the result of the tension force of the slide-actuated contact steel plate provided in the form of a contact spring, the two tongues are separately elastically deflected while being in a non-actuated state. The free space required for this is provided in the inner space of the housing. The deflection of the contact tongues causes a contact friction at the contact points when the contact is both opened and closed. This leads to a certain self-cleaning in the contact area, which has a positive effect on the actuation reliability of the actuator. The contact is actuated by the slide that acts on the contact spring. The latter is shaped like a hammer in the contact area and bent so that the curved section projects into a channel situated to the site of the inner space of the housing.<br>
The hammer-shaped section of the contact spring ensures that the tongues of the double-contact tongue are reliably contacted.<br>
The contact is actuated by the slide by moving this slide when the belt tongue is inserted into the belt latch mechanism. The slide runs against the curved section of the contact spring. When moved further the curved section is pushed in the direction of the contact space and the actuation triggered.<br>
Based on one embodiment the invention will be explained in detail. An associated figure shows a cross section of the actuator in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The actuator that comes as a break contact, consists of the housing 1, which is closed above the connection space 5 by a lid not shown herein. The actuator has an inner space of the housing 2a that is closed in the contact area. In the lower part of the actuator a connection space 5 has been provided. There, the fixed-contact steel plate 6 and the contact spring 7 terminate. They can be connected here with the connecting leads 10. The connection space 5 is open on both sides.<br>
The contact spring 7 has a curved section 9 and a hammer-shaped section 8. The curved section 9 intersects the fixed-contact steel plate 6 in the area of the double-contact tongues and projects into channel 3. By the downward motion of slide 4 as a result of the belt tongue being inserted in the belt latch mechanism, the contact spring 7 is actuated and the contact separated. The hammer-shaped section 8 of the contact spring 7 forms on both sides the bearing surface at the tongues of the fixed-contact sheet plate 6 and thus, the two contact points of the actuator.<br>
The contact tongues of the fixed-contact steel plates 6 are, while being in the contact state, subject to a bending stress and therefore deflected elastically. Upon actuation of the contact spring they move back to an unbent state. This produces a contact friction in the contact area. This friction also occurs while the contact is closed when during the upward motion of slide 4 the contact spring 7 springs back to the inoperative state.<br>
The actuator provided in this form, is capable of being assembled fully automatically. By automatic insertion equipment the fixed contact 6 and the contact spring 7 can be inserted in such an order that the contact spring 7 is inserted first followed by the fixed-contact steel plate 6. After insertion the latter is shifted until it reaches its final fitting position. After the inner space of the housing 2 has been closed by a lid, the actuator can undergo functional testing. Then, the connecting leads 10 can be fitted. This is done largely automatically by crimping or welding, because housing 1 is open on both sides in the area of connection space 5.<br>
The contact space 2 is closed at the top so that no foreign matter can penetrate into the contact area. Thus, a protection against failure due to contamination is ensured.<br>
