COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
FROZEN AERATED CONFECTION<br>
HINDUSTAN   LEVER   LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at  Hindustan   Lever  House,      165/166,   Backbay  Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2005/046346	PCT/EP2004/012191<br>
-   1   -<br>
Frozen Aerated Confection<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a frozen aerated confection. More<br>
5   specifically, the invention relates to an ice cream product which is soft and extensible at -18°C.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
US patent application publication 2001/0031304 A discloses a frozen  <br>
10	aerated confection which exhibits an extensible character similar to that shown by a Turkish artisenal type of ice cream known as Moras. Maras ice cream comprises sahlep which is an extract from the roots of orchids and it is thought that it is sahlep which   contributes to the extensible quality of Maras  ice cream.<br>
In US 2001/0031304 A, the frozen aerated confection does not comprise sahlep or any other product from orchids. Preferably, the confection comprises a polysaccharide such as xanthan gum, guar   gum, or sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). In addition the<br>
20	confection preferably comprises one or more proteins selected from milk, soya or whey protein. The overrun of the confection is in the range 15-80%.<br>
The inventors have observed that when the frozen aerated confection<br>
25	disclosed in US 2001/0031304 A is removed from a domestic free2ser at -18°C, it is not apparent to the consumer that the confection has an extensible quality because it is too hard. The extensible character of the confection only becomes apparent on softening the product by warming it to -12°C. <br>
30<br>
A further problem with the confection disclosed in US 2001/0031304 A is that the extensibility generally decreases as the overrun increases beyond 30%.<br><br>
WO 2005/046346	PCT/EP2004/012191<br>

Tests and Definitions<br>
The number average molecular weight  (Mn) is a number weighted<br>
averaged molecular weight defined by the following equation:<br><br><br><br>
where Wi is the mass of species i, Mi is the molar mass of species i<br>
10 	and Ni is the number of moles of the species i of molar mass Mi. The mean number average molecular weight is the number average molecular weight of a blend of two or more, in this case, freezing point depressants.<br>
15  Overrun is defined by the following equation<br><br><br><br>
Freezing point depressants as defined in this invention consist of: 20  monosaccharides; disaccharides; oligosaccharides containing from<br>
three to ten monosaccharide units joined in glycosidic linkage;<br>
corn syrups with a dextrose equivalent (DE) of greater than 20<br>
preferably &gt; 40 and more preferably &gt; 60; glycerol; erythritol;<br>
arabitol;  xylitol; sorbitol; mannitol; lactitol; malitol; or any 25  combination thereof.<br>
Monosaccharides and disaccharides include sucrose, arabinose, ribose, xylose, dextrose, galactose, mannose, fructose, lactose, maltose, raffinose and stachyose.<br>
30<br>
Corn syrups are complex multi-component sugar mixtures and the dextrose equivalent is a common industrial means of classification. Since they are complex mixtures their number average molecular<br><br>
WO 2005/046346	PCT/EP2004/012191<br>
-   3   -<br>
weight (Mn) can be calculated from the equation below (Journal of Food Engineering, 33 (1997) 221-226),<br><br><br><br>
Extensible confection refers to a frozen aerated confection with an extensibility of at least 30%. At an extensibility of less than 30%, the consumer does not generally perceive the confection as being extensible.<br>
10<br>
Measurement of extensibility<br>
In the examples that follow, the extensibility was measured using the following procedure, which is illustrated with reference to the figures in which:<br>
15<br>
Figure 1 shows a cutter used to stamp a test piece;<br>
Figure 2 shows a test piece grip;<br>
Figure 3 shows the arrangement of two grips with a metal gauge; and<br>
Figure 4 shows a test piece broken at the shoulder.<br>
20<br>
A 500 ml block of ice cream of dimensions 92 mm x 38 mm x 140 mm was removed from a cold store at -25°C and allowed to soften at 25°C. The block was cut into 10 mm wide strips using a serrated knife and following the pre-drawn guidelines on the block.  Thus<br>
25  from one block, 14 strips having dimensions of 92 mm x 38 mm x 10 mm were cut off.<br>
The strips were placed on a silicon paper covered portable hard flat surface, for example a hard plastic chopping board. A shaped <br>
30 		test piece was then stamped from each of the strips using a cutter which is shown in Figure 1. The cutter has an overall length of 80 mm and a width at its widest point adjacent the ends of 23 mm. An indented area (11) is defined substantially symmetrical about the<br><br>
WO 2005/046346	PCT/EP2004/012191<br>
-   4   -<br>
middle point of the length of the cutter.  The indented area has a width of 10 mm and a length of 60  mm.<br>
The cutter was warmed in hot water at 50-60°C and at least 6 test<br>
5	pieces stamped from the aforementioned strips. The test pieces were then returned to a cold store at -25°C on the silicon paper and hardboard for a minimum of 90 minutes. As the test pieces should not be held at 25°C for more than 13 minutes, the time for cutting and stamping did not exceed 8 minutes. <br>
10<br>
The test pieces were then removed from the cold store at -25°C and<br>
placed into test grips.  The test grip design is shown in Figure 2<br>
and comprises 2 Perspex™ plates (21) joined together with a C clip<br>
(22) and a stainless steel pin (23) , the C clip (22) comprising an<br>
15  M4 screw (24) .  Mounted on the opposing faces of each Perspex™<br>
  plate (21) is a rubber pad (25), each of which has a dimpled<br>
surface.  The distance from the distal end of the rubber pad to the<br>
C clip (22) is 25 mm and the spacing between the rubber pads (25)<br>
is 23 mm.  The width of each rubber pad (25) is 18 mm.  The rubber<br>
20  pads (25) comprise Foulds conveyor belt material model V100 two-ply<br>
polyester with a polyvinyl chloride top surface.  The rubber pads<br>
(25) are attached to the Perspex™ plates (21) with adhesive whereby<br>
the dimpled surface of each rubber pad (25) is free to grip the<br>
test pieces.<br>
25<br>
One test grip (33) was placed on each end of the test piece (32) as shown in Figure 3. The rubber pads (25) were closed to a gap no smaller than 8 mm. A metal gauge (31) was used to ensure that the pair of grips were correctly located ensuring the distance between<br>
30  the two grips was 60 mm.<br>
In Figure 3, the metal gauge (31) is shown attached to a pair of test grips (33) holding a test piece (32).  The metal gauge (31) <br>
WO 2005/046346	PCT/EP2004/012191<br>
-   5   -<br>
has a total length of 136 mm and sets the distance between the screws of each C clip at 120 mm.  The test piece, test grips and metal gauge were then placed in a portable freezer set at -18°C for 10-120 minutes. <br>
5<br>
Testing was conducted on an Instron 4501 mechanical test machine fitted with a 10 N load cell. The test was conducted within a temperature control cabinet set to -18°C. After the test piece was attached to the mechanical test machine via the test grips, the<br>
10 	metal gauge was removed and the test piece allowed to equilibrate at -18°C for 2 minutes before [the test was performed.<br>
The test was performed by pulling the test piece apart with the test grips moving away from each other at a relative speed of 50 mm<br>
15 	per minute. The force (F) required to pull the test piece and the displacement of the test grips (AL) were continually recorded during the test. Any test in which the test piece slipped within either grip or broke at the shoulder (41) of the test piece as shown in Figure 4 was rejected.  The test was completed when the<br>
20 	test piece is broke. A minimum of 6 valid tests was required to provide a measurement of extensibility for a test ice cream.<br>
The displacement of the test grips at which the force drops to zero after passing through a maximum load is the point at which the<br>
25  failure of the test piece occurs.<br>
A percentage strain to failure Ef is defined as the displacement to failure divided by the original gauge length of test piece (Lo) multiplied by 100. The original gauge length is that portion of <br>
30 	the test piece which is 10 mm wide, thus the original gauge length is 60 mm. The mean percentage strain to failure of at least 6 valid tests defines the extensibility of the ice cream under test.<br><br>

Measurement of mechanical firmness<br>
Mechanical   firmness  was  measured  in  accordance  with  the   following<br>
procedure.<br>
5	 Mechanical firmness provides an indication of softness.  	Mechanical firmness is given by the maximum true stress (Pa) 	which can be obtained from a true stress versus true strain curve 	(Richards, C.W. (1961) Engineering materials science.

where Ao is the cross-sectional area of the original gauge length.<br>
The true strain (et) is given by<br><br>
The true stress (at) can be calculated from the force measurements obtained from the extensibility test and is given by<br><br>
Determination of the texture profile<br>
The texture profile was determined by a sensory panel of 10 or more 25  trained assessors.<br>
The technique employed combined aspects of both the Spectrum™ and Texture Profile™ methodologies (Lawless, H.T. and Heymann, H. (1999) Sensory evaluation of food: principles and practices. <br>

 	The trial involved a three replicate assessment. Samples were 	served in plastic pots at -18°C and the trained assessors were 	asked to assess the attributes listed in table 1 hereinbelow in 10 	accordance with the procedure set out in the same table. The 	data was analysed using ANOVA (analysis of variance) and multiple 	comparison testing. The accepted significance level was 5% or 	p=

Brief Description of the Invention<br>
This invention overcomes the aforementioned problems by providing, in a first aspect, a frozen aerated confection comprising freezing point depressants in a total amount of 26-40% weight by weight, the <br>
5 	freezing point depressants having a mean number average molecular weight of less than or equal to 320, characterized in that the confection has an extensibility of at least 30% at -18°C.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors have observed<br>
10 	that the softness of a frozen aerated confection comprising freezing point depressants in a total amount of 26-40% weight by weight, the freezing point depressants having a mean number average molecular weight of less than or equal to 320, is a function of the viscosity of the non-frozen matrix phase as well as the phase<br>
15  volume of ice. Since the viscosity of the non-frozen matrix phase and the ice phase volume are, in part, a function of the mean number average molecular weight of the freezing point depressants, the softness of the confection is, in part, determined by the mean number average molecular weight of the freezing point depressants.<br>
20<br>
When the mean number average molecular weight of the freezing point depressants is much in excess of 320 at a total freezing point depressant amount of 26-40% weight by weight, the extensible character of the confection is maintained but is not apparent to<br>
25  	the consumer at -18°C because the confection is too hard.<br>
Thus by maintaining the total amount of freezing point depressants in the range of 26-40% weight by weight and controlling the mean number average molecular weight of the freezing point depressants <br>
30 	at less than or equal to 320, the confection is soft enough when, removed directly from a domestic freezer, for the consumer to perceive any extensible character.<br><br>

In a second aspect of the invention, a frozen aerated confection is<br>

The ice creams were prepared in accordance with the following procedure.<br>
All the ingredients were blended together in an agitated heated mix 5 	tank after which the blend was subjected to high shear mixing at a 	temperature of at least 65°C for 2 minutes in order to hydrate the 	stabilisers. Excessive temperature was avoided to prevent damage to 	heat labile components and the formation of cooked off flavours.<br>
10 	The blend was then subjected to homogenisation to reduce the bulk of the fat droplets to below l//m in diameter by homogenising at a pressure of 150bar and a temperature of 70 °C using a valve homogeniser.<br>
15 	As examples 1 and 2 and comparative example 2 were rather viscous due to their high levels of guar, they were heated to 80°C prior to homogenisation to facilitate processing thereby enabling the blends to flow more readily through the pasteuriser and the homogeniser.<br>
20 	In order to conform to public health requirements the blend was pasteurised by heated the blend to 83°C and holding for 20 seconds. The pasteurised blend was then rapidly cooled to a chill temperature of 4°C. The blend was then held at 4°C to age.<br>
25 	The blend was then frozen using a continuous freezer known as a votator or scrape surface heat exchanger. These devices freeze the blend and incorporate sufficient air to deliver the desired overrun. The ice cream was extruded at -10°C.<br>
30 	Following freezing the ice cream was subjected to hardening by blast freezing to -35°C thereby reducing the temperature of the ice cream to close to the final storage temperature of -25°C.<br><br>

Results<br>
The results of extensibility tests are shown in table 3. Both example 1 and comparative example 2 were prepared at 30% overruns. Comparative example 1 was prepared at 60% overrun.<br>

Example 1	30	155	65<br>
Example 2	30	83	32<br>
Comparative example 1	60	13	2<br>
The results show that the extensibility of example 1 is comparable <br>
10  to comparative example 2, which is the standard extensible ice cream.  Comparative example 1, which is the non-extensible ice cream, exhibited very low values of extensibility.<br>
Extensibility measurements were also carried out on example 1 and<br>
15	comparative example 2 at overruns of 30%, 50%, 100% and 120%. The results are summarised in table 4 hereinbelow. (The sample of comparative example 2 was produced using the same formulation but on a different occasion to the sample of comparative example 2 whose measurement results were shown in table 3.)<br>

In table 4, it is apparent how increasing the overrun leads to a <br>
5 	decrease in the extensibility of comparative example 2 (the standard extensible ice cream). In comparison, and rather surprisingly, the extensibility of example 1 remains relatively stable on increasing the overrun.<br>
10 	The results of the mechanical firmness tests are shown in table 5. The data recorded during the extensibility tests was used to calculate the true stress (at) and true strain (et) values in accordance with the method set forth hereinabove.<br><br>
