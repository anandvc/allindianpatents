Two different subtypes of cannabinoid receptors (CBi amd CB2) have been isolated and both belong to G protein coupled receptor superfamily. An alternative spliced form of CBi, CBIA, has also been described, but it did not exhibit different properties in terms of ligand binding and receptor activation than CBi (D.Shire, C. Carrillon, M. Kaghad, B. Calandra, M. Rinaldi-Carmona, G. Le Fur, D. Caput, P. Ferrara, J. Biol. Chem. 270 (8) (1995) 3726-31). The CBi receptor is mainly located in the brain, whereas the CB2 receptor is predominately distributed in the peripheric primarily localized in spleen and cells of the immune system (S. Munro, K.L. Thomas, M. Abu-Shaar, Nature 365 (1993) 61-61). Therefore in order to avoid side effects a CBi-selective compound is desirable.<br>
A9-tetrahydrocannabinol (A9-THC) is the principal psychoactive compound in the Indian hemp (Y. Gaoni, R. Mechoulam, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 86 (1964) 1646), canabis savita (marijuanan), which is used in medicine since ages (R. Mechoulam (Ed.) in "Cannabinoids<br>
as therapeutic Agents"y 1986, pp. 1-20, CRC Press). A9-THC is a non-selective CBi/2<br>
receptor agonist and is available in the USA as dronabinol (marinol®) for the alleviation of cancer chemotherapy-induced emesis (CIE) and the reversal of body weight loss experienced by AIDS patients through appetite stimulation. In the UK Nabolinone (LY-<br>
109514, Cesamet®), a synthetic analogue of A9-THC, is used for CIE (R. G. Pertwee, Pharmaceut. Sci. 3 (11) (1997) 539-545, E. M. Williamson, F. J. Evans, Drugs 60 (6) (2000) 1303-1314).<br>
Anandamide (arachidonylethanolamide) was identified as the endogenous ligand (agonist) for CBi (R.G. Pertwee, Curr. Med. Chem., 6 (8) (1999) 635-664;W,A. Devane, L. Hanus, A. Breuer, R.G. Pertwee, L.A. Stevenson, G. Griffin, D. Gibson, A. Mandelbaum, A. Etinger, R. Mechoulam, Science 258 (1992) 1946-9). Anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) modulate at the presynaptic nerve teminal negatively adenylate cyclase and voltage-sensitive Ca   channels and activates the inwardly rectifying K+ channel (V. Di Marzo, D. Melck, T. Bisogno, L. De Petrocellis, Trends in Neuroscience 21 (12) (1998) 521-8), thereby affecting neurotransmitter release and/or action, which decreases the release of neurotransmitter (A. C. Porter, C.C. Felder, Pharmacol. Ther., 90 (1) (2001) 45-60).<br><br>
Anandamide as A9-THC also increases feeding through CBi receptor-mediated mechanism, CBi selective antagonists block the increase in feeding associated with administration of anandamide (CM. Williams, T.C. Kirkham, Psychopharmacology 143 (3) (1999) 315-317; C. C. Felder, E. M. Briley, J. Axelrod, J. T. Simpson, K. Mackie, W. A. Devane, Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL U. S. A. 90 (16) (1993) 7656-60) and caused appetite suppression and weight loss (G. Colombo, R. Agabio, G. Diaz, C. Lobina, R. Reali, G. L. Gessa, Life Sci. 63 (8) (1998) L113-PL117).<br>
Leptin is the primary signal through which the hypothalamus senses nutritional state and modulates food intake and energy balance. Following temporary food restriction, CBI receptor knockout mice eat less than their wild-type littermates, and the CBI antagonist SR141716A reduces food intake in wild-type but not knockout mice. Furthermore, defective leptin signaling is associatedd with elevated hypothalamic, but not cerebellar, levels of endocannabinoids in obese db/db and ob/ob mice and Zucker rats. Acute leptin treatment of normal rats and ob/ob mice reduces anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol in the hypothalamus. These findings indicate that endocannabinoids in the hypothalamus may tonically activate CBI receptors to maintain food intake and form part of the neural circuitry regulated by leptin (V. Di Marzo, S. K. Goparaju, L. Wang, J. Liu, S. Bitkai, Z. Jarai, F. Fezza, G. I. Miura, R. D. Palmiter, T. Sugiura, G. Kunos, Nature 410 (6830) 822-825).<br>
SR-141716A, a CBI selective antagonist / inverse agonist is undergoing currently phase III clinical trials for the treatment of obesity. In a double blind placebo-controlled study, at the doses of 5,10 and 20 mg daily, SR 141716 significantly reduced body weight when compared to placebo (F. Barth, M. Rinaldi-Carmona, M. Arnone, H. Heshmati, G. Le Fur, "Cannabinoid antagonists: From research tools to potential new drugs" Abstracts of Papers, 222nd ACS National Meeting, Chicago, IL, United States, August 26-30,2001).<br>
Other compounds which have been proposed as CBI receptor antagonists respectively inverse agonists are aminoalkylindols (AAI; M. Pacheco, S. R. Childers, R. Arnold, F. Casiano, S. J. Ward, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 257 (1) (1991) 170-183), like 6-bromo- (WIN54661; F. M. Casiano, R. Arnold, D, Haycock, J. Kuster, S. J. Ward, NIDA Res. Monogr. 105 (1991) 295-6) or 6-iodopravadoline (AM630, K. Hosohata, R. M. Quock, R.M; Hosohata, T. H. Burkey, A. Makriyannis, P. Consroe, W. R. Roeske, H. I. Yamamura, Life Sci. 61 (1997) 115 -118; R. Pertwee, G. Griffin, S. Fernando, X. Li, A. Hill, A. Makriyannis, Life Sci. 56 (23-24) (1995) 1949-55).

Lett. 9 (15) (1999) 2233 -2236.) as well as 3-alkyl-5-arylimidazolidinediones (F. Ooms, J. Wouters, O. Oscaro. T. Happaerts, G. Bouchard, P.-A. Carrupt, B. Testa, D. M. Lambert, J. Med. Chem. 45 (9) (2002) 1748-1756) are known to antagonize the CBi receptor respectively act as an inverse agonist on the hCBj receptor.

In WO0170700 4,5-dihydro-lH-pyrazole derivatives are described as CBi antagonists. In several patents bridged and non-bridgedl,5-diphenyl-3-pyrazolecarboxamide derivatives are disclosed as CBi antagonists/inverse agonists (WO0132663, WO0046209, WO9719063, EP658546, EP656354, US5624941, EP576357, US3940418).<br>

Method for Measuring Blood Glucose Levels<br>
db/db mice (obtained from Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) are bled (by either eye or tail vein) and grouped according to equivalent mean blood glucose levels. They are dosed orally (by gavage in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle) with the test compound once daily for 7 to 14 days.

In addition, to demonstrate CNS activities of the compounds of the present invention, the following in vivo assays maybe used.<br>
Method for Testing Task Learning and Spatial Memory<br>
The Morris Water Maze is routinely used to assess task learning and spatial memory (Jaspers et aL, Neurosci. Lett 117:149-153,1990; Morris, J. Neurosci. Methods 11:47-60, 1984). In this assay, animals are placed in a water pool which is divided into quadrants. One platform is hidden in one of the quadrants. The animal is placed in the water pool and is expected to locate the hidden platform within a predetermined time. During a number of training trials, the animal learns the location of the platform and escape from the pool. The animal receives multiple trials in this task. Total distance traveled, number of trials to locate platform, latency to find platform, and the swimming path is recorded for each animal. The animal's learning ability is measured by the length of time or number of trials required to find the hidden platform. Memory deficit or improvement is determined by the number of trials or the latency to find the platform at predetermined delay time after acquisition. Leaning and memory may be measured by the number of times that the animal crosses the quadrant where the platform was located during the acquisition phase.<br>
Method for Testing Drug Dependence<br>
Self-administration in animals is a predictor of a compound's abuse potential in humans. Modifications to this procedure may also be used to identify compounds that prevent or block the reinforcing properties of drugs that have abuse potential. A compound that<br><br>
extinguishes the self-administration of a drug may prevent that drug's abuse or its dependence. (Ranaldi et aL, Psychopharmacol. 161:442-448,2002; Campbell et al., Exp. Clin. Psychopharmacol. 8:312-25,2000). In a self-administration test, animals are placed in the operant chambers containing both an active and inactive lever. Each response on the active lever produces an infusion of either the test compound or a drug known to be self-administered. Presses on the inactive lever have no effect, but are also recorded. Animals are then trained to self-administer compound/drug over a set period of time by having drug access during each daily session. Illumination of the chamber house light signals the beginning of the session and the availability of the compound/drug. When the session ends, the house light is turned off. Initially, a drug infusion occurs with every press of the active lever. Once lever-pressing behavior has been established, the number of presses to produce a drug infusion is increased. After stable compound/drug self-administration is obtained, the effect of a second compound on the drug-reinforced behavior maybe evaluated. Administration of this second compound prior to the session can either potentiate, extinguish, or produce no change to the self-administrating behavior.<br>
The following tests were carried out in order to determine the activity of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
The affinity of the compounds of the invention for cannabinoid CB1 receptors was determined using membrane preparations of human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells in which the human cannabis CB1 receptor is transiently transfected using the Semliki Forest Virus system in conjunction with [3H]-CP-55,940 as radioligand. After incubation of a freshly prepared cell membrane preparation with the [3H]-ligand, with or without addition of compounds of the invention, separation of bound and free ligand was performed by filtration over glassfiber filters. Radioactivity on the filter was measured by liquid scintillation counting.<br>
The affinity of the compounds of the invention for cannabinoid CB2 receptors was determined using membrane preparations of human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells in which the human cannabis CB2 receptor is transiently transfected using the Semliki Forest virus system in conjunction with [3H]-CP-55,940 as radioligand. After incubation of a freshly prepared cell membrane preparation with the [3H]-ligand, with or without addition of compounds of the invention, separation of bound of bound and free ligand was performed by filtration over glassfiber filters. Radioactivity on the filter was measured by liquid scintillation counting.<br><br>
The cannabinoid CB1 antagonistic activity of compounds of the invention was determined by functional studies using CHO cells in which human cannabinoid CB1 receptors are stably expressed (see M. Rinaldi-Carmona et. aL, J. Pharmacol Exp. Ther. 278 (1996) 871). The stable expression of the human cannabinoid receptor in cell systems was first described in Nature 1990,346,561-564 (CBl) and Nature 1993,365,61-65 (CB2) respectively. Adenylyl cyclase was stimulated using forskolin and measured by quantifying the amount of accumulated cyclic AMP. Concomitant activation of CBl receptors by CBl receptor agonists (e.g. CP-55&gt;940 or (R)-WIN-55212-2) can attenuate the forskolin-induced accumulation of cAMP in a concentration dependent manner. This CBl receptor mediated response can be antagonised by CBl receptor antagonists such as the compounds of the invention.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) show an excellent affinity for the CBl receptor, determined with the experimental conditions described in Devane etal. Mol. Pharmacol. 34 (1988) 605-613. The compounds of the present invention or their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts are antagonists and selective for the CBl receptor with affinites below IC50<br>
= 2 nM, preferably 1 nM to 100 nM. They exhibit at least a 10 fold selectivity against the CB2 receptor.<br><br><br><br>
All measurements were made between 12:00 am and 5:00 pm. Mice were brought in this environment and habituated for at least two hours before the start of the experiment. They had always free access to food and water. For each dose, 8 mice were used. Rectal body temperature measurements were recorded by mean of a rectal probe (RET2 of Physitemp) and digital thermometer (Digi-sense n°8528-20 of Cole Parmer, Chicago USA). The probe was inserted about 3.5 cm in each mouse.<br>
The body temperature was taken 15 min before administration of either Vehicle or CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist. 30 or 90 min after Lp. or p.o. administration of this compound, respectively, rectal body temperature was recorded in order to evaluate any influence of the compound itself. The CB receptor agonist CP 55,940 (0.3 mg/kg) was immediately administered intravenously, then 20 min after i.v. administration of CP 55940, body temperature was again measured.<br>
The in vivo activity of compounds of formula (1) was assessed for their ability to regulate feeding behaviour by recording food consumption in food deprived animals.<br>
Rats were trained to have access to food for 2h per day and were food deprived for 22h. When they were trained under this schedule, the amount of food taken every day during these 2h food intake session Avas consistent day after day.<br>
To test the ability of compounds of formula (1) to decrease food intake, 8 animals were used in a cross-over study. Rats were individually housed in Plexiglas boxes with a grid on the floor and a paper was placed below the cage floor to collect any spillage. A food dispenser (becher) filled with a pre-weighed amount of food was presented to them for 2h. At the end of the food intake session, rats returned to their home cage. Each rat was weighed before the start of the experiment and the amount of food consumed during this 2h food intake session was recorded. Either various doses of test compound or vehicle was administered orally 60 min before the 2h food intake session. A positive control Rimonabant (SR141716) was included in the experiment. An Anova analysis with repeated measures was used followed by a posthoc test Student Neumann-Keuls. * P 
Furthermore the utility of compounds of formula (1) in diseases or disorders maybe demonstrated in animal disease models that have been reported in the literature. The following are examples of such animal disease models: a) reduction of sweet food intake in marmosets (Behavioural Pharm, 1998, 9,179-181); b) reduction of sucrose and ethanol intake in mice (Psychopharm. 1997, 132, 104-106); c) increased motor activity and place conditioning in rats (Psychopharm. 1998, 135, 324-332; Psychopharmacol 2000, 151: 25-<br><br>
30); d) spontaneous locomotor activity in mice (J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1996,277,586-594); e) reduction in opiate self-administration in mice (Sci. 1999,283,401-404).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral, parenteral or topical administration. They can be administered, for example, perorally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, drag^es, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils. Oral administration is preferred.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described compounds of formula (I) and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, optionally in combination with other therapeutically valuable substances, into a galenical administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeuticaUy compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers might, however, be required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer<br><br>
substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula (I) can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 to 1000 mg, especially about 1 to 100 mg, comes into consideration. Depending on severity of the disease and the precise pharmacokinetic profile the compound could be administered with one or several daily dosage units, e.g. in 1 to 3 dosage units.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 1-500 mg, preferably 1-100 mg, of a compound of formula (I).<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the present invention in more detail. They are, however, not intended to limit its scope in any manner.<br>
