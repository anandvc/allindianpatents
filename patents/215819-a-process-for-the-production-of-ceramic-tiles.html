				<td>The invention relates to an improved process for the production of cerninic tiles. The invention particularly relates to an improved process for the production of ceramic tiles using industrial wastes such as iron ore slime, fly ash and blast furnace slag.<br>
The products produced by the process of present invention may be of different shapes and sizes, in the glazed or unglazed forms as per requirement. The near impervious unglazed tiles shall be useful for laying floor of industries, godowns, buildings, etc. where the floors are subjected to scratch and abrasion. The glazed tiles with matty finish shall be useful for making decorative floors while the glaze tiles with glossy finish shall be useful for making decorative walls of buildings.<br>
The hitherto known processes use costly minerals such as kaolin, feldspar, quartz, talc, pyrophillite, etc. to produce ceramic tiles. The existing processes to produce ceramic tiles consisted of wet mixing for 1 0 to 20 hours of raw materials, spray drying, compacting at 250 to 300 kg/cm2 load, drying at 110° to 120°C, glazing and firing at 1150 to 1300°C. The raw materials are wet mixed in mills. The wet slurry obtained is filter pressed to squeeze the water out and then spray dried to get very small nodules of raw material for better compaction. The ready powder is compacted in tile shape by hydraulic pressing then dried and fired to get unglazed tiles. To get the glazed tiles first engob is applied to hide the body colour then glaze is applied on the surface of unbaked tiles and then fired. The existing process also require double firing for high quality glossy glazing of tiles for walls.<br><br>
Another known process use iron ore tailings in combination with other minerals like kaoline, feldspar, quartz, talc, etc. to produce ceramic tiles. The raw materials are wet mixed in mills, filter pressed to squeeze the water out and then spray dried to get small nodules of raw material for better compaction. The ready powder is compacted in tile shape by hydraulic pressing then dried and fired to get unglazed tiles. To get the glazed tiles first engob then glaze is applied on the surface of unbaked tiles and then fired.<br>
The hitherto known process have the following limitations:<br>
a.	The floor made of the product of the known processes are not capable of<br>
withstanding scratch and high abrasion required in a number of industrial<br>
applications as they have relatively low scratch hardness (around 5 in Moh's<br>
Scale) and compressive strength.<br>
b.	The production cost of sintered tiles made from the costly minerals is relatively<br>
high.<br>
c.	The raw materials used for the production of existing ceramic floor and wall tiles<br>
require   10 to 20 hours of grinding to achieve fineness as they are found in lump<br>
forms, leading to the consumption of more energy.<br>
d.	The sintering has to be carried out at 1150° to 1300°C for 1 to 2 hours leading to<br>
the consumption of more energy.<br><br>
According to literature survey and available information, it may be mentioned that at present no process is available to produce ceramic tiles from iron ore slime, fly ash and blast furnace slag. The purpose of this development is to use abundantly available waste materials such as iron ore slime, fly ash and blast furnace slag which are causing environmental pollution, as raw material to produce value added products such as ceramic tiles.<br>
The main object of the present investigation is to provide a process to produce ceramic tiles in glazed and unglazed form using industrial wastes such as from iron ore slime, fly ash , blast furnace slag and other low cost minerals.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process to produce unglazed and glazed ceramic tiles using industrial wastes such as from iron ore slime, fly ash , blast furnace slag and other low cost minerals whereby the cost of production is appreciably lowered and the properties of the product is improved.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process to produce unglazed and glazed ceramic tiles using industrial wastes such as from iron ore slime, fly ash and blast furnace slag whereby the energy consumption is significantly reduced.<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process to produce unglazed and glazed ceramic tiles using industrial wastes such as from iron ore<br><br>
slime, fly ash and blast furnace slug which are waste materials'and thereby reducing the<br>
*.	'<br>
pollution in the environment.<br>
In the process of present invention, liquid phase sintering of iron ore slime, fly ash and blast furnace slag takes place in the presence of alumino-silicate minerals. Additive is added during raw material mixing to promote the reaction sintering at lower temperature (1100° to 1250°C) as against the sintering temperature of 1150° to 1300°C in hitherto known process. The iron ore slime used in the present invention contains iron oxide and silica, the fly ash used in present invention contains silica, alumina and iron oxide, the blast furnace slag used in the present invention contains calcium oxide, silica, alumina and magnesium oxide.<br>
Silica is the most important constituent for any ceramic tile composition to form crystalline as well as glassy phase. The three waste material used in the present invention contains silica along with alumina, iron oxideA calcium oxide and magnesium oxide. These constituents reacts together during heating and forms mullite, fayalite, anorthite and other crystalline phases on reaction sintering. The crystalline phase is uniformly distributed and reinforced in glassy matrix. As a result, a strong, dense and compact microstructure is achieved which contribute to the high scratch hardness and strength. The thermal expansion of the present tile body is kept equal or marginally higher than thermal expansion of the glaze, so that glaze materials remains under compression to the body to avoid microcracking and chipping of the glaze.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the production of ceramic tiles using industrial wastes characterized in that comprising<br>
