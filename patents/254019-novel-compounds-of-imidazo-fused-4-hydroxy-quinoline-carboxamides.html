The present invention relates to novel imidazo fused quinoline carboxamides of the general formula I R, R2 represent C1 and C2 alkyls, R1 is hydrogen and R3 represents Ci-C5 alkyl or aryl which is optionally substituted by alkyl, alkoxy, halogens, N,N-dialkylamino and furyl groups or polymethylene moiety containing 4-7 carbon atoms.<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br><br><br>
The invention particularly relates to the synthesis of new tricyclic hydroxy quinoline carboxamide derivatives fused at 7,8 positions by imidazole ring as in I and II. The novel molecules such as 7,8-imidazofused quinoline-3-carboxamide compounds obtained as intermediates for heterofused quinolones.<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br><br><br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Fluoroquinolone carboxylic acids are considered as potent antibacterials in vitro / in vivo and have good pharmacological applications for the last two decades with several molecules being commercially available as drugs. However, recent investigations have shown the occurrence of multidrug resistance to bacterial infections.(Chem.Ind.l7-2-1997, page 131). In order to overcome this problem, extensive research is in progress to synthesise polycyclic fluoroquinolones by novel and innovative methods.<br>
U.S patent 4,623,650 (1986) discloses the synthesis and antibacterial activity of certain 6-fluoro-7-aryl-l,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acids having the formula<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br><br><br>
in which R1 is H, alkyl (C1-C4), benzyl or a cation; R2 is H or F; Y is 1-3 carbon alkyl, H or polyhaloalkyl, hydroxyethyl, cyclopropyl, vinyl, alkylphenyl, etc; R4 is H, 3-hydroxy or 3-chloro provided both R3 and R4 are not hydrogens.<br>
U.S patent 3,472,859 (1969) discloses certain compounds having the formula<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br><br><br>
where in R is lower alkyl and their fungicidal activity is disclosed.<br>
U.S patent 3,907.808 (1975) described certain 1,4-dihydro-l-(lower alkyl)-4-oxo-7-(4-pyridyl)-3-quinoline carboxylic acid and esters with the formula<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br><br><br>
where in R is H, lower alkyl or CH2OAC; R1 is lower alkyl, etc; R2 is H, halogen etc; n is 0 or 1; R3, R4, R5, R6 are each selected from H, lower alkyl, halogen, etc; as antibacterial agents<br>
U.S patents 5,605,910 (1997) and 5,457,104 (1995) disclose new quinolones and Naphthyridone carboxylic acid derivatives which are substituted in the 7-position by a<br>
tricyclic amine radical, their salts and hydrogen in the 6 position respectively and their antibacterial activity.<br>
Quinolone and Naphthyridone carboxylic acid derivatives with H in 6th position have antibacterial activity. Examples can be found in U.S patent 4,416,884 (1983), EP 393,400 (1990). 8-methyl-7-piperazinylquinolone carboxylic acids were described in DE 3,007,006 (1985) and 7-(3-aminopyrrolidinyl)-8-fluoroquinolone carboxylic acids in J.Med.Chem.35,198 (1992).
