				<td>CARRIER STRUCTURE FOR A REFLECTOR ELEMENT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a carrier for a reflector element, for use in a solar energy reflector<br>
system of a type that is employed for reflecting incident radiation to a solar energy collector system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Various solar energy reflector-collector systems have been developed for use in harnessing<br>
solar radiation that falls incident over areas that might range in size from 5 * 101 m2 to 25 * 106m2. In<br>
this context reference is made to collector systems that have been disclosed in Australian Patents<br>
694335 and 724486 dated 28th March, 1996, and 19th December, 1997, respectively.<br>
The most relevant of the earlier known reflector-collector systems, including those disclosed<br>
in the referenced patents, employ a field of reflectors which are driven to track movement of the sun<br>
(relative to the earth) and which are oriented to reflect incident radiation to distant, elevated collector<br>
systems. The individual reflectors are for this purpose mounted to pivotal supports, but little attention<br>
has in the past been given to the fabrication of economically attractive such supports or, in the case of<br>
relatively large scale reflectors, to the construction of pivotal supports that function to provide<br>
torsional stiffness at a level to resist deflection of the supports and supported reflector elements.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention seeks to minimise the above inadequacies by providing carrier structure<br>
for a reflector element, for use in a solar energy reflector system, and which comprises : a platform<br>
which is arranged to carry the reflector element and which is; formed with stiffening elements, a<br>
frame structure supporting the platform, wherein the frame structure comprises a space frame, and<br>
mounting means supporting the frame structure in a manner that accommodates turning of the carrier<br>
structure about an axis of rotation that lies substantially coincident with a longitudinal axis of the<br>
reflector element when mounted to the platform.<br><br>
OPTIONAL FEATURES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The carrier structure may, in one embodiment of the invention, be<br>
carried by the mounting means in a manner which accommodates<br>
unidirectional rotation of the carrier structure about the axis of rotation<br>
that is substantially coincident with the longitudinal axis of the reflector<br>
element. By "substantially coincident" is meant that the axis of rotation<br>
is located coincident with or adjacent to the longitudinal axis of the<br>
reflector element.<br>
A drive system incorporating an electric motor may, in accordance with<br>
one embodiment of the invention, be provided for imparting<br>
unidirectional turning drive to the carrier stmcture. By providing such<br>
a system, in which unidirectional drive is imparted to the carrier<br>
structure, the traditional requirement for a reversible motor or a<br>
pivoting mechanism, with attendant backlash and other problems, is<br>
avoided. Also, by employing such a drive system, the carrier structure<br>
may be parked in a selected angular position with the reflector element<br>
orientated downwardly, to shield it from adverse ambient conditions,<br>
during the process of turning (ie, rotating) trie carrier structure through<br>
360 degrees during each 24-hour period. Furthermore, the carrier<br>
structure may at any time within each 24-hour period be rotated<br>
temporarily to a selected angular position with the reflector element<br>
orientated in a direction away from potentially damaging climatic<br>
conditions.<br>
The platform for the reflector element may, in one embodiment of the<br>
invention, comprise a fluted or corrugated metal panel, with the flutes<br>
or corrugations forming the stiffening elements of the platform. In such<br>
case, the reflector element will be supported upon the crests of the<br>
flutes or corrugations. Furthermore, although the flutes or corrugations<br>
may extend in a direction that intersects the longitudinal axis of the<br>
reflector element, the flutes or corrugations desirably are orientated to<br>
extend in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the reflector<br>
element.<br>
Also, although the platform may be formed with a. flat surface or such<br>
that the crests of the flutes or corrugations are located in a flat plane,<br><br>
the platform desirably is curved concavely in. a direction orthogonal to<br>
the longitudinal axis of the reflector element.<br>
The frame structure of the carrier structure may comprise a skeletal<br>
frame structure having hoop-like end members that extend about the<br>
axis of rotation of the carrier structure and between which the platform<br>
extends. In this optional embodiment of the invention, the end members<br>
will be supported for turning upon the above; mentioned mounting<br>
means for the carrier structure.<br>
The mounting means for supporting the carrier structure or, in the<br>
optional embodiment of the invention, for each of the hoop-like end<br>
members, may comprise spaced-apart supporting; rollers. Such rollers<br>
desirably are sized and otherwise arranged to track within a channel<br>
region of the associated end member.<br>
The drive system for imparting unidirectional drive to the carrier<br>
structure may, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention,<br>
be coupled to at least one of the hoop-like end members and it<br>
desirably incorporates a link chain that extends around and is fixed to<br>
one of the end members to form, in effect, a gear wheel. In the latter<br>
case a sprocket will be provided to engage with the link chain and to<br>
impart drive to the end member from the electric motor. With such a<br>
drive arrangement, a relatively inexpensive electric motor may be<br>
employed and, with appropriately sized end members of the carrier<br>
structure, a high reduction in drive velocity and a commensurate<br>
increase in torque transmission is obtained.<br>
The reflector element may comprise a single panel-shaped glass mirror<br>
or a reflective metal panel, but it desirably comprises a plurality of<br>
square or rectangular glass mirrors that are mounted in edge abutting<br>
relationship upon the supporting platform. In this case the rear,<br>
silvered faces of the mirrors may be protected against adverse ambient<br>
conditions by sealing surrounding gaps and spaces with a silicone or<br>
other suitable sealant. When, as mentioned above, the platform for the<br>
reflector element is curved concavely, the reflector element will be<br>
secured to the platform in a manner such that the concavity will be<br><br>
transferred to the reflecting surface of the reflector element.<br>
The carrier structure of the invention may be embodied in various<br>
arrangements, one of which is now described, by way of example, with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings. The: carrier structure is<br>
described in the context of a complete reflector system.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
In the drawings-<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective view of the reflector system with a carrier<br>
structure of the system rotated to an angular position in which a<br>
reflector element is orientated to reflect in an upward direction,<br>
Figure 2 shows a perspective view of the same reflector system but<br>
with the carrier structure rotated through approximately 180 degrees<br>
to expose the underside of a platform and skeletal frame structure for<br>
the reflector element,<br>
Figure 3 shows, on an enlarged scale, a portion of an end member and<br>
a drive system of the reflector system, and<br>
Figure 4 shows, also on an enlarged scale, a portion of the end member<br>
and an associated mounting arrangement for the reflector system.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
As illustrated, the reflector system in its exemplified embodiment<br>
comprises a carrier structure 10 to which a reflector element 11 is<br>
mounted. The carrier structure itself comprises an elongated panel-like<br>
platform 12 which is supported by a skeletal frame structure 13. The<br>
frame structure includes two hoop-like end members 14.<br>
The members 14 are centred on and extend about an axis of rotation<br>
that is approximately coincident with a central, longitudinally-extending<br>
axis of the reflector element 11. The axis of rotation does not need to be<br>
exactly coincident with the longitudinal axis of the reflector element but<br>
the two axes desirably are at least adjacent on another.<br>
In terms of overall dimensions of the reflector system, the platform 12 is<br>
approximately twelve metres long and the end members 14 are<br>
approximately two metres in diameter.<br><br>
The platform 12 comprises a corrugated metal panel and the reflector<br>
element 11 is supported upon the crests of the corrugations. The<br>
corrugations extend parallel to the direction of the longitudinal axis of<br>
the reflector element 11, and the platform 12! is carried by six<br>
transverse frame members 15 of the skeletal frame structure 13. End<br>
ones of the transverse frame members 15 effectively comprise diametral<br>
members of the hoop-like end members 14.<br>
The transverse frame members 15 comprise rectangular hollow section<br>
steel members and each of them is formed with a curve so that, when<br>
the platform 12 is secured to the frame members 15, the platform is<br>
caused to curve concavely (as viewed from above in Figure 1) in a<br>
direction orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the reflector element 11.<br>
The same curvature is imparted to the reflector element 11 when it is<br>
secured to the platform 12.<br>
The radius of curvature of the transverse frame members 15 is in the<br>
range of twenty to fifty metres and preferably of the order of thirty-eight<br>
metres.<br>
The skeletal frame 13 of the carrier structure: 10 also comprises a<br>
rectangular hollow section steel spine member 16 which interconnects<br>
the end members 14, and a space frame which is fabricated from<br>
tubular steel struts 17 connects opposite end regions of each of the<br>
transverse frame members 15 to the spine member 16. This skeletal<br>
frame arrangement, together with the corrugated structure of the<br>
platform 12 provides the composite carrier structure 11 with a high<br>
degree of torsional stiffness.<br>
The hoop-like end members 14 are formed from channel section steel,<br>
" such that each end member is provided with a U-shaped<br>
circumferential portion and, as shown in Figure 4, each of the members<br>
14 is supported for rotation on a mounting arrangement that comprises<br>
two spaced-apart rollers 18. The rollers 18 are positioned to track<br>
within the channel section of the respective end members 14, and the<br>
rollers 18 provide for turning (ie, rotation) of the carrier structure 10<br><br>
about the axis of rotation that is approximately coincident with the<br>
longitudinal axis of the reflector element 11.<br>
As also shown in Figure 4, a hold-down roller 18a is located adjacent<br>
the support rollers 18 and is positioned within the associated end<br>
member 14 to prevent lifting of the reflector system under adverse<br>
weather conditions.<br>
A drive system, as shown in see Figure 3, is provided for imparting<br>
unidirectional drive to the carrier structure 10 and, hence, to the<br>
reflector element 11. The drive system comprises a shaded pole or other<br>
similar such non-reversible electric motor 19 having an output shaft<br>
coupled to a sprocket 20 by way of reduction gearing 21. The sprocket<br>
20 meshes with a link chain 22 through which drive is directed to the<br>
carrier structure 10.<br>
The link chain 22 extends around and is fixed to the periphery of the<br>
outer wall 23 of the channel-section of one of the end members 14. That<br>
is, the link chain 22 affixed to the end member effectively forms a type<br>
of gear wheel with which the sprocket 20 engages.<br>
With the end member 14 having a diameter in the order of 2.00 m and<br>
the sprocket 20 having a pitch circle diameter of 0.05 m, reduction<br>
gearing and torque amplification in the order of (4O.r):l may be<br>
 obtained, where r is the reduction obtained through gearing at the<br>
output of the electric motor 19.<br>
The reflector element 11 is formed by butting together five glass<br>
mirrors, each of which has the dimensions 1.8 m X 2.4 m. A silicone<br>
 sealant is employed to seal gaps around and between the mirrors and to<br>
minimise the possibility for atmospheric damage to the rear silvered<br>
faces of the mirrors, and the mirrors are secured to the crests of the<br>
platform 12 by a urethane adhesive.<br>
 The mirrors have a thickness of 0.003 m and, thus, they may readily be<br>
curved in situ to match the curvature of the supporting platform 12.<br><br>
Depending upon requirements, two or more of the above described<br>
reflector systems may be positioned linearly in a row and be<br>
connected one to another by way of adjacent ones of the hoop-like end<br>
members 14. In such an arrangement a single drive system may be<br>
employed for imparting unidirectional drive to the complete row of<br>
reflector systems.<br>
Variations and modifications may be made in respect of the carrier<br>
structure as above described by way of example without departing from<br>
the scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
