AUXILIARY INDICATING MODULE FOR AN ELECTRICAL SWITCHGEAR APPARATUS WITH A TRIP DEVICE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an auxiliary indicating module for an electrical switchgear apparatus with a trip device, in particular a differential circuit breaker or switch, said module comprising an insulating case housing:<br>
-	a first switch with a movable changeover contact designed to provide an open-closed OC indication of the switchgear apparatus contacts,<br>
-	a second switch with a movable changeover contact designed to provide either an open-closed OC indication of the switchgear apparatus contacts or a fault signal FS indication representative of the loaded or tripped state of the switchgear apparatus,<br>
-	a mechanism with a handle and rotary plate for actuation of the movable contacts of the first and second switches,<br>
-	mechanical linking means to transmit the open-closed state and the loaded-tripped state of the switchgear apparatus to the mechanism,<br>
-	and a selector for choosing the open-closed OC or fault signal FS operating mode of the second switch.<br>
STATE OF THE TECHNIQUE<br>
The document EP 147,605 refers to a switchable auxiliary indicating unit, one of whose changeover switches can be locked in the make position by means of a stop pawl<br><br>
operating in conjunction with the operating handle, which handle passes through the front panel of the case. A selector enables the pivoting zone of the stop pawl to be limited.<br>
The document EP 303,965 describes an auxiliary indicating unit of the kind mentioned, comprising two juxtaposed handles protruding out from the front panel of the case. The first handle serves the purpose of actuating the mechanism of one of the changeover switches to enable manual making of the latter, and to indicate the switching position. The second handle is coupled to the circuit breaker handle and serves the purpose of closing the auxiliary unit and the circuit breaker simultaneously.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to achieve an auxiliary indicating module having at least one changeover switch easily switchable to the open-closed OC or loaded-tripped FS version.<br>
The auxiliary indicating module according to the invention is characterized in that a fault signal FS indicating lever is mounted on the mounting plate of the mechanism, and that the movable contact of the second switch is actuated by an intermediate lever, which lever follows the movement of the mounting plate or of the indicating lever according to the setting of the selector, respectively to choose the open-closed OC or loaded-tripped FS operating mode.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the intermediate lever is pivotally mounted on a spindle the positioning whereof is modified when the setting position of the selector is<br><br>
modified. The movable contact of the first switch is actuated by the rotary plate and the FS indicating lever with bistable indicating flag is pivotally mounted on a pivot of the plate between a loaded position and a tripped position.<br>
According to one feature of the invention, the selector is coupled to a switching indicator designed for the operating mode OC-OC or FS-OC to be visualized from the front panel of the case. The choice of operating mode is made before coupling is performed with the apparatus. Switching of the selector becomes impossible when the auxiliary indicating module is adjoined and coupled to the circuit breaker, as the selector is no longer accessible.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Other advantages and features will become more clearly apparent from the following description of an embodiment of the invention, given as a non-restrictive example only, and represented in the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
- figures 1, 2 and 3 are elevational views showing the first OC-OC version of operation of the auxiliary indicating module according to the invention, respectively in the closed position, the manual opening position, and the opening by tripping position, the selector being in a first setting position;<br>
- figures 4, 5 and 6 are identical views to those of the previous figures showing the second FS-OC version of operation of the auxiliary indicating module according to the invention,<br><br>
respectively in the closed position, the manual opening position, and the opening by tripping position, the selector being in a second setting position.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
With reference to figures 1 to 6, an auxiliary indicating module 10 is housed in an insulating case 12 designed to be adjoined and coupled to an electrical switchgear apparatus with a trip device, in particular a low-voltage differential circuit breaker or switch. The case 12 houses two electrical changeover switches 14, 16 actuated by an operating mechanism 18 which is controlled by mechanical links for tripping and resetting of the electrical switchgear apparatus.<br>
Each changeover switch 14, 16 is equipped with a movable changeover contact 20, 22 formed by a flexible metallic blade operating in conjunction with a pair of stationary contacts 24, 26; 28, 30 isolated from one another. The first, right-side, changeover switch 14 permanently provides an OC indication of the open-closed state of the electrical switchgear apparatus contacts, whereas the second, left-side, changeover switch 16 provides either an open-closed OC indication or a fault signal FS indication according to the setting position of a rotary selector 32.<br>
The stationary contacts 24, 26 and the movable contact 20 of the first changeover switch 14 are electrically connected to connection terminals 34, 36, 38 housed in recesses of the right-hand side face of the case 12. The stationary contacts 28, 30 and the movable contact 22 of the second changeover switch 16 are electrically connected to connection terminals 40, 42,44 housed in recesses of the left-hand side face of the case 12.<br><br>
The auxiliary indication module 10 is provided with a handle 46 pivotally mounted on a spindle 48 and connected to the latching hook of the mechanism 18 by a transmission rod 50. The mechanism 18 comprises a rotary plate 52 rotating between two extreme positions which plate provides a permanent indication of the open-closed state of the circuit breaker contacts, and a trip bar 54 designed to receive a tripping order of the circuit breaker. A fault signal FS indicating lever 58 providing a permanent indication of the loaded-tripped state of the circuit breaker is mounted in rotation on the pivot 56 of the plate 52. The end of the indicating lever 58 comprises for this purpose a bistable indicating flag 60 visible from the front panel 62 of the case 12.<br>
The movable contact 20 of the first changeover switch 14 is actuated by the plate 52, whereas the movable contact 22 of the second changeover switch 16 is driven by an intermediate lever 62 pivotally mounted on a spindle 64.<br>
The selector 32 has two stable setting positions and is accessible from the right-hand large side face of the case 12 constituting the adjoinment face with the circuit breaker. Setting of the selector 32 is performed manually by means of a screwdriver and enables the user to choose between two operating modes of the auxiliary indicating module 10, i.e. a first OC-OC mode and a second FS-OC mode. The choice of operating mode is made before the unit is coupled with the circuit breaker. Switching the operating mode becomes impossible when the auxiliary indicating module 10 is adjoined and coupled to the circuit breaker, as the selector 32 is no longer accessible.<br><br>
Depending on the angular position of the selector 32, the intermediate drive lever 62 of the movable contact 22 of the second switch 16 comes up against the stop formed by the plate 52 (figures 1 to 3) or by the fault signal FS indicating lever 58 (figures 4 to 6). A position change of the selector 32 causes a modification of the positioning of the spindle 64 of the intermediate lever 62.<br>
The selector 32 moreover drives a switching indicator 66 which displays the selected operating mode on the front panel 62. In OC operation of the second switch 16, the intermediate lever 62 follows the plate 52. In FS operation of the second switch 16, the intermediate lever 62 is driven by the fault signal FS indicating lever 58.<br>
A traction spring 68 is arranged between a fixed point 70 of the case 12 and the fault signal FS indicating lever 58. The spring 68 is in the taut state if tripping has not taken place when the circuit breaker is in the closed position or has been opened by a manual action. The fault signal FS indicating lever 58 is then in the loaded position (figures 1-2 and 4-5).<br>
The spring 68 retums to the relaxed state in case of automatic tripping of the circuit breaker and urges the fault signal FS indicating lever 58 to the tripped position (figures 3 and 6).<br>
Operation in OC-OC mode<br>
Operation of the auxiliary indicating module 10 in OC-OC version is illustrated in figures 1-3. The selector 32 is set to a given position which positions the intermediate lever 62<br><br>
against the plate 52. The second switch 16 indicates the open-closed OC state of the circuit breaker, as does the first switch 14. Selection of the OC-OC operating mode setting is displayed on the front panel 62 by the switching indicator 66.<br>
In figure 1, the auxiliary indicating module 10 is in the closed position and the two movable contacts 20, 22 are in engagement against the stationary contacts 24, 28 both reflecting the positioning of the plate 52 indicating the closed state of the circuit breaker. The fault signal FS indicating lever 58 is in the loaded position and the spring 68 is in the taut state.<br>
Figure 2 represents the manual opening phase of the circuit breaker in which the handle 46 of the auxiliary indicating module 10 pivots counterclockwise driving the rotary plate 52 in the same direction. The two movable contacts 20, 22 are moved simultaneously in the same direction by the plate 52 and come into engagement against the stationary contacts 26, 30 both indicating the open state of the circuit breaker. The fault signal FS indicating lever 58 remains immobile during manual opening of the circuit breaker and does not have any influence on the intermediate lever 62, since the movable contact 22 follows the movement of the plate 52 only.<br>
In case of tripping of the circuit breaker (figure 3), the trip bar 54 causes unlocking of the plate 52 which moves to the same position as that represented in figure 2, but more quickly. The two movable contacts 20, 22 are moved simultaneously in the same direction by the plate 52, and come into engagement against the stationary contacts 26, 30 both indicating the open state of the circuit breaker. The fault signal FS indicating lever<br><br>
58 is urged by the spring 68 to the tripped position so as to indicate the opening mode of the circuit breaker by tripping.<br>
The two switches 14, 16 operate in open-closed OC mode and the intermediate lever 62 follows the plate 52 and not the fault signal FS indicating lever 58. The latter is not however disabled, for it indicates tripping of the circuit breaker.<br>
Operation in FS-OC mode<br>
Operation of the auxiliary indicating module 10 in FS-OC version is illustrated in figures 4-6. The selector 32 is set by means of a screwdriver to the other position, which modifies the location of the pivoting spindle 64 of the intermediate lever 62. The latter comes up against the stop formed by the fault signal FS indicating lever 58, and selection of the FS-OC operating mode setting is displayed on the front panel 62 by the switching indicator 66 which pivots to the right. The first switch 14 controlled by the plate 52 still indicates the open-closed OC state of the circuit breaker, and the second switch 16 controlled by the indicating lever 58 indicates the loaded-tripped FS state of the circuit breaker.<br>
In figure 4, the auxiliary indicating module 10 is in the closed position and the movable contacts 20, 22 are in engagement against the stationary contacts 26, 28. The first switch 14 indicates the closed state of the circuit breaker contacts and the second switch 16 indicates the loaded state of the circuit breaker.<br>
When manual opening of the circuit breaker is performed (figure 5), the handle 46 of the auxiliary indicating module 10 pivots counterclockwise driving the rotary plate 52 in the<br><br>
same direction. The movable contact 20 is actuated towards the stationary contact 26, and the first switch 14 indicates the open state of the circuit breaker contacts. The indicating lever 58 remains immobile in the loaded position and does not drive the intermediate lever 62 which remains in the same position as that of figure 4. The movable contact 22 remains in engagement against the stationary contact 28 and the second switch 16 confirms the loaded state of the circuit breaker.<br>
In case of tripping of the circuit breaker (figure 6), the trip bar 54 causes unlocking of the plate 52 which moves to the same position as that represented in figure 5, but more quickly than the handle. The two movable contacts 20, 22 are moved simultaneously in the same direction against the stationary contacts 26, 30, one by the action of the plate 52, and the other by the intermediate lever 62 driven by the indicating lever 58. The first switch 14 indicates the open state of the circuit breaker contacts and the second switch 16 indicates tripping of the circuit breaker following movement of the indicating lever 58 to the tripped position.<br>
From the position of figure 6, resetting of the auxiliary indicating module 10 takes place when manual closing of the circuit breaker is performed causing movement of the plate 52 to the position of figure 4. Clockwise rotation of the handle 46 and plate 52 drives the indicating lever 58 in the same direction to the loaded position. It is also possible to perform resetting directly by moving the indicating flag 60 from the tripped position (figure 6) to the loaded position (figure 4).<br><br><br><br><br>
