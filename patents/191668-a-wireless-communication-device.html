				<td>The present invention relates to a wireless communication device. The invention relates generally to wireless communication device having alert generators and adapted to generate a plurality of distinct tactile alert patterns.<br>
A wireless communication device operates in a wireless communication system to provide a user of the device with portable communications. A wireless communication device communicates with the wireless communication system or other wireless communication devices via electromagnetic signals, such as those in the radio frequency (RF) range, for example. The wireless communication device may communicate voice only, data only or both voice and data. The format of the electromagnetic signal communicated between the wireless communication device and the wireless communication system or other devices may be either analog or digital. Examples of wireless communication devices comprise radiotelephones, pagers, two-way radios, personal data assistants, and personal notebooks. The radiotelephones comprise cellular and cordless subscriber units.<br>
Wireless communication devices use various alert techniques to indicate to a user of a wireless communication device that an incoming desired signal has been received. For example, a radiotelephone alerts the user when an incoming call signal is received, and a pager alerts the user when an incoming page signal is received. Generally, these alert techniques include audible, visual and tactile alert generators. The audible alert generator is typically implemented with an acoustic transducer, ie. a speaker, sometimes known as a ringer. The visual.alert generator is typically implemented with a display or a separate indicator. The tactile alert generator is typically implemented with an axially offset counter-weight driven by a motor to cause a vibrating sensation.<br>
Audible alert generators are generally known to be implemented in virtuaUy all wireless communication devices. When a desired signal has been received, the wireless communication device activates the audible alert generator to produce a sound, such as a ring or beep, thereby alerting the user. A problem with audible alert generators is that the sound produced can be disturbing to others in environments where there is a low ambient noise level, and may not be heard by the user in environments where there is a high ambient noise level.<br>
In landline telephone systems, landline telephone subscriber units have audible alert generators and can generate distinctive audible alert patterns, such as distinctive ringing or distinctive call-waiting, responsive to signals generated by the landline telephone system. Generally, distinctive ringing and distinctive call-waiting consists of sequenced, variable-length bursts of power ringing interspersed with variable length silent intervals. Distinctive ringing and distinctive call-waiting for landline telephone subscriber units is described in Bellcore's LATA Switching Systems Generic Requirements, Class SM Feature: Distinctive Ringing/Call Waiting, FSD 01-01-1110, TR-TSY-000219, Issue 2, November 1988, Revision 1, May 1992.<br>
In a radiotelephone system, radiotelephone subscriber units have audible alert generators and can generate distinctive audible alert patterns, such as distinctive ringing, responsive to alert codes generated by the radiotelephone system. Generally, distinctive ringing in the radiotelephone system is implemented by varying the pitch and cadence or duty cycle, of the audible alert signal. Pitch represents a distinction between tones, usually based on frequency. Cadence or duty cycle is the on/off pattern of the tones. Distinctive ringing for radiotelephone subscriber units is described in EIA/TIA INTERIM STANDARD, Cellular System Dual-Mode Mobile Station-Base Station<br>
Compatibility Standard, IS-54-B, Section 2.7.3.1.3.3.1, Telecommunications Industry Association, April 92.<br>
Visual alert generators are generally known to be implemented in most wireless communication devices. When a desired signal has been received, the wireless communication device activates the visual alert generator to produce a visual indicator, such as a flashing icon in the display or a flashing light, thereby alerting the user. A problem with visual alert generators is that the visual indicator produced can go undetected by the user for some period of time until the user actually looks at the visual indicator. Therefore, the audible alert generator is typically used as a primary alert and the visual alert generator is typically used as a secondary or redundant alert.<br>
Tactile alert generators are generally known to be implemented in only some wireless communication devices. Tactile alert generators are typically used in wireless communication devices that are small enough to be portable and worn on the user such that the tactile sensation is felt. Some pagers, for example, have the motor driving the axially offset counter-weight to produce a vibrating sensation against the user. When a desired signal has been received, the wireless communication device activates the tactile alert generator to produce a tactile sensation, such as vibration, thereby alerting the user. A problem with tactile alert generators is that the tactile sensation produced can go undetected by the user when the wireless communication device is not worn by the user or closely coupled to the user in some manner. Another problem with tactile alert generators is that various users may not be responsive to the same tactile sensation produced by the tactile alert generator due to the physiology and clothing of the various users and the location of the wireless communication device on the user's body. Therefore, the tactile alert generator is typically used in environments where the ambient noise level is very low such that others in the area are not disturbed or where the ambient noise level very high such that the user is alerted when the audible alert cannot be heard.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for a wireless communication device that generates a plurality of distinctive tactile alert patterns.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a wireless communication device, comprising:<br>
a receiver for receiving communication signals;<br>
a tactile alert generator for generating different tactile alert patterns for communications signals received;<br>
a non-tactile alert generator for generating different non-tactile alert patterns for different communications signals received;<br>
a controller coupled to the receiver, to the tactile alert generator and to the non-tactile alert generator, the controller enabling the tactile alert generator and the non-tactile alert generator to generate substantially consistent respective alert patterns for the same communication signal received.<br>

U.S. Patent Application No . 07/823,738 discloses subject matter related to the present invention and is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
FIG. 3 is a timing diagram illustrating a plurality of distinctive tactile alert patterns 301-312 in accordance with the present invention. The plurality of distinctive tactile alert patterns 301-312 generated by the tactile alert generator 223 are preferably controlled by the<br>
controller 215. A high value signifies that the tactile alert generator 223 is on; and a low value signifies that the tactile alert generator 223 is off. However, the plurality of distinctive tactile alert patterns 301-312 generated by the tactile alert generator 223 may also be controlled by the tactile alert generator 223 itself if so desired.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the receiver 205 receives the desired communication signal 121. The tactile alert generator 223 generates a tactile alert pattern 301 when enabled. The controller 215, operably coupled to the receiver 205 and the tactile alert generator 223, for enabling the tactile alert generator 223 to generate the tactile alert pattern 301 as one of a plurahty of distinctive tactile alert patterns 301-312 when the desired communication signal 121 is received.<br>
Generally, the desired communication signal 121 is indicative of an occurrence of a particular event in a radiotelephone system 102 in which the radiotelephone 101 operates. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the desired communication signal 121 is an incoming telephone call signal. However, alternate desired communication signals 121 may include, without limitation, an incoming page signal.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the one of the plurality of distinctive tactile alert patterns 301-312 is determined by a user of the radiotelephone 101. This determination can be made by the user through the keypad 217 of the radiotelephone 101. Thus, the present invention permits the user to select a distinctive tactile alert pattern based on the user's preference. The user's preference may be influenced by a number of variables including the user's physiology, clothing, and location of the radiotelephone on the user's body. Further, the user may program the radiotelephone 101 to selected distinctive tactile alert patterns 301-312 to be generated when a selected corresponding phone numbers are received by the radiotelephone 101.<br>
Alternatively, the one of the plurality of distinctive tactile alert patterns 301-312 is determined by the radiotelephone system 102 in<br>
which the radiotelephone 101 operates. When the radiotelephone system 102 transmits the desired communication signal 121 to the radiotelephone 101, the desired communication signal 121 further comprises a code corresponding to the one of the plurality of distinctive tactile alert patterns 301-312 to be generated. Thus, the radiotelephone system 102 may cause the radiotelephone 101 to generate the distinctive tactile alert patterns 301-312. For example, the radiotelephone system 102 may cause one of the particular distinctive tactile alert patterns 301-312 to be generated when the desired communication signal 121 is an incoming telephone call signal and another one of the particular distinctive tactile alert patterns 301-312 to be generated when the desired communication signal 121 is a incoming page call signal. As another example, the radiotelephone system 102 may cause one of the particular distinctive tactile alert patterns 301-312 to be generated when the desired communication signal 121 is a incoming telephone call signal within one radiotelephone system and another one of the particular distinctive tactile alert patterns 301-312 to be generated when the desired communication signal 121 is a incoming telephone call signal within another radiotelephone system.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the plurality of distinctive tactile alert patterns 301-312 are made distinctive from each other by varying at least one of duty cycle and frequency of each of the plurality of distinctive tactile alert patterns. Such variation is illustrated in FIG. 3 by the variety of distinctive tactile alert patterns 301-312. Further, the intensity of the distinctive tactile alert patterns may also be varied if so desired.<br>
FIG. 4 is a timing diagram illustrating a distinctive audible or visual alert pattern 401 and the distinctive tactile alert pattern 301 in accordance with the present invention. High and low values signify that a particular alert device is one and off, respectively.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the audible alert generator 225 generates an audible alert pattern 401.<br><br>
The controller 215, operably coupled to the receiver 205 and the audible alert generator 225, enables the audible alert generator 225 to generate the audible alert pattern 401 as one of a plurality of distinctive audible alert patterns when the desired communication signal 121 is received. The one of the plurality of distinctive audible alert patterns 401 and the one of the plurality of distinctive tactile alert patterns 301 have substantially the same distinctive alert pattern. For example, the ringer 225 and the vibrator 223 both produce substantially the same distinctive alert pattern. Thus, the user is alerted to the desired communication signal 121 with the same distinctive alert pattern recognized by the user no matter whether the user is alerted by the ringer 225 or the vibrator 223.<br>
Alternatively, the visual alert generator 221 generates a visual alert pattern 401. The controDer 215, operably coupled to the receiver 205 and the visual alert generator 221, enables the visual alert generator 221 to generate the visual alert pattern 401 as one of a plurality of distinctive visual alert patterns when the desired communication signal 121 is received. The one of the plurality of distinctive visual alert patterns 401 and the one of the plurality of distinctive tactile alert patterns 301 have substantially the same distinctive alert pattern.<br>
Alternatively, the receiver receives the desired communication signal 121. The audible alert generator 225 generates an audible alert pattern 401 when enabled. The silent alert generator 227 for generating a silent alert pattern 301 when enabled. The controller 215, operably coupled to the receiver 215, the audible alert generator 225 and the silent alert generator 227, enables at least one of the audible alert generator 225 and the silent alert generator 227 when the desired communication signal 121 is received. The audible alert generator 225 generates the audible alert pattern 401 as one of a plurality of distinctive audible alerts and the silent alert generator 227 generates the silent alert pattern 301 as one of a plurality of distinctive silent alerts 301-312. The one of the plurality of distinctive audible alert patterns 401 and the one of the plurality of distinctive silent alert<br>
patterns 301 have substantially the same distinctive alert pattern. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the audible alert generator 225 is a ringer 225 and the silent alert generator 227 is a vibrator 223. Alternatively, the silent alert generator 227 may be a display 221.<br>
Thus, a wireless communication device 101 is adapted to generate a plurality of distinctive vibrating alert patterns. The controller 215, operably coupled to the receiver 205 and the vibrating alert generator 223, enables the vibrating alert generator 223 to generate the vibrating alert pattern 301 as one of a plurality of distinctive vibrating alert patterns 301-312 when the desired communication signal 121 is received. The present invention advantageously permits the user or the communication system to select a preferred distinctive tactile alert pattern (301), or to assign a particular distinctive vibrating alert pattern (301) to a particular desired communication signal (121).<br><br><br>
