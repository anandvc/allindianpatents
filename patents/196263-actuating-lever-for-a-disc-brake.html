V<br>
?    The present invention relates to an actuator lever for a disc<br>
brake,  and a ' disc brake and a disc brake  incorporating said actuator lever.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to an actuator lever for a disc brake and a disc brake incorporating said actuator lever, of the type actuated by a fluid controlled brake applying means, particularly in the form of a pneumatically operated diaphragm cylinder.<br>
In known constructions of pneumatically operated disc brakes the basic construction comprises an annular braking<br>
disc straddled by a clamp member or caliper containing an<br>
f<br>
actuator mechanism which applies braking force to one side of the braking disc via a brake pad.  The clamp member or caliper is mounted on a torque taking member so as to be slidable axially of the braking disc whereby when the first mentioned brake pad is applied to one side of the braking disc the clamp member/caliper slides axially of the brake disc to apply the other brake pad to the other side of the braking disc, thus completing the braking action.  The brake pads are usually carried by the torque taking member which is fixedly secured to the vehicle.<br>
In pneumatically operated disc brake constructions of known type the brake applying means incorporates a piston with a piston rod extending out of the chamber of the brake applying means, the piston engaging with a pivotal lever.  In certain constructions the pivotal lever has at its end region remote from<br><br>
the said piston rod, a curved supporting surface which sits in an appropriate bearing which is located between the curved surface and a fixed surface in the brake construction.  Provided on another part of this other end region of the lever is a force transmitting member in the form of a cylindrical rod or roller which is located in a complimentary channel in the said other end region of the lever with the force transmitting member being usually rotatable about its longitudinal axis in the said channel with an appropriate bearing e.g. a proprietory PVDF, PTFE and lead composition, located between the cylindrical force transmitting member and the surface of the channel.  The channel is so located as to be axially offset from the pivotal axis of the said other end region of the lever i.e. the centre of curvature of the cylindrical force transmitting member is spaced from the centre of curvature of the curved surface at the other end region of the lever.  This cylindrical force transmitting member engages an axially moveable tappet which can be adjustable in length i.e. it cooperates with an appropriate adjuster mechanism, the tappet acting either directly or via another member against the first mentioned friction pad.  Thus by pivoting the lever about the said curved surface, the force transmitting member presses against the said tappet applying the first mentioned brake pad against one side of the brake disc. The clamp member/caliper thus slides axially of the braking disc applying the other brake pad to the other side of the brake disc.<br>
The above type of brake may have one adjustable length tappet or more usually, two adjustable length tappets, with an adjuster mechanism coupled to the pivotal lp^r wi-.^-â€”w..<br><br>
the tappet can be adjusted in length to cater for pad wear, the adjuster assembly acting on one tappet which is coupled to the other tappet for equivalent adjustment.<br>
Whilst on assembly the attachment of the diaphragm/piston brake applying means to the brake construction with the piston rod engaging one end of the actuating lever is basically quite simple, it will be appreciated that the assembly and construction of the lever with the appropriate bearings and the force transmitting member together with the tappets and adjuster mechanism is quite complicated and an expensive manufacturing operation.  It is thus the aim of the present invention to simplify the construction and to provide an improved form of adjuster mechanism.<br><br>
Accordingly, there is provided an actuating lever for<br>
a disc brake comprising an elongate member,  one end of	;<br>
which member is adapted to be, in use, engaged by brake applying means, an opposite end region of the elongate member having two cam sections which extend laterally in opposite directions from the elongate member respectively, each cam section having a part cylindrical surface, said part-cylindrical surface being coaxial with each other, with their common longitudinal axis extending transversely of the longitudinal axis of the elongate member, wherein each cam section has a respective cylindrical channel formed in a region separate from the part cylindrical surface thereof, a respective elongate cylindrical force transmitting member being located in each said channel and extending radially outward therefrom, the axis of the respective channels and cylindrical force transmitting members being parallel to the longitudinal axis of the said part cylindrical surfaces, with the two cylindrical force transmitting members each having opposite end regions which are located in recesses formed in the elongate member at opposite ends of the said channels to thus retain the respective force transmitting members in position in their respective channels and in which, for each cam section one said recess is formed as a cylindrical blind bore in the elongate member, and the other said recess is formed as a cylindrical bore in an extension of the cam section, with said cylindrical bore and said blind bore being coaxial<br>
with   each    nhhpr   snrl   wi t-h    aa-lH    Manual o<br><br>
According to the present invention there is provided an actuating lever for a disc brake comprising an elongate member, one end of which member is adapted to be, in use, engaged by brake applying means, an opposite end region of the elongate member having two cam sections which extend laterally in opposite directions from the elongate member respectively, each cam section having a part cylindrical surface, said part cylindrical surfaces being coaxial with each other, with their common longitudinal axis extending transversely of the longitudinal axis of the elongate member, in which each cam section has a respective cylindrical channel formed in a region separate from the part cylindrical surface thereof, a respective elongate cylindrical force transmitting member being located in each said channel and extending radially outward therefrom, the axis of the respective channels and cylindrical force transmitting members being parallel to the longitudinal axis of the said part cylindrical surfaces, with the two cylindrical force transmitting members each having opposite end regions which are located recesses formed in the elongate member at opposite ends of the said channels to thus retain the respective force transmitting members in position in their respective channels, and in which, for each cam section, on said recess is formed as a cylindrical blind bore in the elongate member, and the other recess is formed as a cylindrical bore in an<br><br>
extension of the cam section, with said cylindrical bore and said blind bore being coaxial with each other and with said channels.<br>
Thus, on assembly, a cylindrical force transmitting member can be passed axially through the cylindrical bore long the channel and engaged in the said blind bore, one end region being thus retained by the blind bore and the other end of the force transmitting member then being retained in the cylindrical bore. During transit and initial assembly a plug e.g. a plastic or rubber plug, cane be located in the cylindrical bore to close the bore and hold the force transmitting member in position.<br>
Further, the lever arm i.e. the elongate member, is preferably formed as a generally triangular structure with said one end region of the elongate member being located at an upper corner and the lateral cam sections projecting in opposite directions from each of the lower two corners.  In this generally, triangular construction an aperture is formed in approximately the central region for the central location of.an adjuster to cater for pad wear.<br>
Also, gear teeth are preferably provided in the central region of the lever i.e. between the two cam sections, with the teeth following the general path of the curved surface<br><br>
of the respective cam sections, these gear teeth, in use, serving to operate the brake adjuster as the actuating as the actuating lever is pivoted.<br>
The present invention will now be further described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:-<br>
Fig. 1 is a partially cut away plan view of a preferred embodiment of the present invention incorporated in an appropriate disc brake;<br>
Fig. 2 is a cross-sectional view taken along line A-A in Fig. 1;<br>

Fig. 4 is a rear i.e. inside, view of a modular assembly constructed according to the present invention;<br>
Fig. 5 is a sectional view along line B-B in Fig. 4;<br><br>

Fig. 7 is an enlarged view of the adjuster utilised in the embodiment of Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 8 is an enlarged view of the retaining means securing the actuating lever to the cover plate; and<br>
Fig. 9 is an enlarged view of part of the modular assembly of Fig. 4, with an alternative form of retaining means.<br>
A disc brake incorporating the present invention is shown in the accompanying drawings and is best seen in Fig. 1.. The disc brake comprises a clamp member 1 which straddles a part of the periphery of a braking disc 3 which is rotatable about its central axis, the clamp member 1 being slidably mounted by virtue of sliding pin arrangements 5, on a torque taking member 7 which, in use, is fixedly mounted on a vehicle of which the disc brake forms a part.  The clamp member 1 incorporates an actuating mechanism 9 which is operable by brake applying means in the form of a pneumatic diaphragm/piston unit (not shown) to force a pair of tappets 11 to move axially to engage and apply a friction pad 13 against one side of the braking disc 3, the clamp member 1 thus sliding on sliding pin arrangements 5 to apply another friction pad 15 against the other side of the braking disc 3. Thus the brake is applied.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1, 2 and 3 of the accompanying drawings, the brake applying means (not shown) is attached to the clamp member so that a piston rod (not shown) extends through an aperture 17 in the actuator 9 to engage in a curved recess 19 in one end region of an elongate actuating lever 21.  The other end region of the elongate actuating lever 21 is provided with two<br><br>
laterally extending cam sections 23, these cam sections 23 extending in opposite directions transverse to the longitudinal axis of the elongate actuating lever 21.  Each cam section 23 has a part cylindrical surface 25, the centres of curvature of these respective surfaces being coaxial with each other.  Also, each cam section 23 has a part cylindrical channel 27 located in a region facing in the opposite direction to the said curved surface 25.  A cylindrical force transmitting member 29 is located in each channel 27 with a bearing material e.g. a bearing made of a proprietory PVDF, PTFE and lead composition, located therebetween, one end of each force transmitting member 2 9 engaging in a recess in the form of a cylindrical blind bore 31 in the lever arm 21, with the other end of each force transmitting member being retained in a cylindrical bore 3 3 provided in an extension 35 of each cam section 23.  The cylindrical blind bore 31 and the cylindrical bore 33 are coaxial with each other and with the centre of curvature of the associated channel 27, the cylindrical force transmitting member being held axially in position in the respective bores by a retaining disc 34 and a circlip 36 (see Fig. 5) which engages in an annual groove provided in the wall of the cylindrical bore 33. Thus the force transmitting members 29 are retained in the channels 27.<br>
As best seen in Figs. 1 and 5 the lever arm 21 is mounted on cam sections 23 engaging via bearings 39, respective curved supporting surfaces 41 formed in the cover plate 37.  Thus the cam sections 23 are pivotal on the curved supporting surfaces 41, the cam sections being retained in position on the cover<br><br>
plate 37 by retaining means 43 which are bolted to an inner face of the cover plate 37, the retaining means 43 taking the form of a metal frame which merely extends over the end of the extensions 35 of the respective cam sections 23, the retaining means allowing for rotational movement of the cam sections 23=  Thus a modular cover plate 37 and lever arm 21 are formed in accordance with the present invention, it being possible for this assembly to be manufactured and simply assembled in the actuator 9, facilitating subsequent servicing of the actuator 9, the cover plate merely being secured in the clamp member 1 by a number of bolts 45.<br>
With the modular assembly 37/21 secured in the actuator 9 by the bolts 45, the respective force transmitting members 29 engage against end regions 47 of the two tappets generally designated 11.  The end regions 47 of each tappet 11 are made of a hardened material and may be rotatably located on the remainder of the tappet 11.  Pivotal movement of the lever arm 21 in the direction A (see Fig. 2) as a result of operation of the brake applying means (not shown) thus causes the force transmitting members 29 to move to the right in Fig. 2 forcing tappets 11 to move axially and apply friction pad 13 to one side of the braking disc 3.<br>
To cater for pad wear an adjustment mechanism is provided, the location of the adjuster mechanism being evident in Fig. 1 with the adjuster 51 being shown in enlarged detail in Fig. 7.  The adjuster mechanism comprises the adjuster 51 which is activated via a lost motion arrangement by pivotal movement of the lever arm 21.  As evident from Figs. 1 and 2 a series of gear<br><br>
teeth 53 are provided on an axial end region of one of the cam sections 23 adjacent to the lever arm 21, these gear teeth 53 meshing with teeth on an annular gear wheel 55 which is mounted for rotation with a hub portion 55a in a central region of the rear i.e. inside, face of the cover plate 37.  Thus, by pivotal movement of the lever arm 21, the gear wheel 55 is rotated. Extending through the centre of the annular gear wheel 55 is an extension 57 of the adjuster 51 (see Fig. 7), this extension having a hexagonal configuration to allow for manual return adjustment of the adjuster 51 as and when pads 13 and 15 are replaced.  Adjacent to the extension 57 is a first part 59 of the adjuster which has a cut out 61 in which an axial extension of the gear wheel and hub assembly 55, 55a engages with clearance, this clearance providing for the lost motion necessary to allow for normal braking with no adjustment occurring, adjustment only occurring as and when sufficient wear has occurred, the clearance then being taken up by the rotation of the gear wheel causing the said one part 59 of the adjuster 51 to rotate.  Said one part 59 has a cylindrical configuration (see Fig. 7) within which another part 65 engages.  This other part 65 has an enlarged diameter section, the outer surface of which is of the same diameter as the cylindrical section of said one part 59.  A rap spring 67 engages around these like diameter sections of said parts and causes said parts to rotate together in one direction but to allow said one part 59 to be freely rotatable from the other part 65 in the opposite rotational direction.  Thus adjustment can occur only in one rotational direction.  The wrap spring 67 is however designed to slip at a predetermined load upon brake<br><br>
actuation such that over adjustment is precluded for example during a heavy braking operation.<br>
Mounted on said other part 65 of the adjuster 51 is a gear wheel 69 which, as seen in Fig. 1, meshes with gear wheels 71 on the respective tappets 49.  Thus, rotation of the gear wheel 69 causes synchronous rotation of the meshed gear wheels 71 and as the gear wheels 71 are secured against rotation relative to an outer part 73 of each tappet 11, rotation of the gear wheels 71 causes said outer parts 73 to rotate about their longitudinal axis causing an inner part 75 of each tappet to be moved axially relative thereto, said inner and outer parts of each tappet being threadedly inter-engaged.  Springs 77 are provided to bias the tappets 11 into engagement with the force transmitting members 29 and to also provide for the return movement of the tappets 11 after brake release.<br>
As will be appreciated the lever arm 21 has a central aperture which can be seen more clearly from Fig. 4, through which the adjuster 51 extends, this central location of the adjuster providing for a balanced construction with the synchronous direct adjustment of the respective tappets by the adjuster 51.<br>
In the embodiment of the present invention described hereabove the cylindrical force transmitting members 29 are each held axially in the bores 31, 33, by the retaining disc 34 and circlip 36.  However a modified arrangement is shown in Fig. 9 wherein the metal frame forming the retaining means 43 has an indent 79 which extends into the cylindrical bore 33, the indent 79 axially restraining the force transmitting member and<br><br>
removing the need for the disc 34 and circlip 36.  As seen in Fig. 9 a clearance 81 is provided between the indent 79 and the wall of bore 33 to accommodate articulation of lever 21 and translating movement of the force transmitting member 29 due to its eccentric location relative to the longitudinal axis of the cam sections 23, about which the lever 21 pivots.  In preferred form of brake, as described hereabove, with the adjuster 51 located between the tappets 11, there is no requirement for the brake to be handed as in previous constructions wherein the<br>
adjuster is located on one side of the brake and acts directly-only on one tappet with said one tappet being coupled to the other tappet to provide for indirect adjustment thereof.<br>
The present invention thus provides for a well balanced construction of this brake with the advantage of a modular assembly for the actuating lever 21, force transmitting member 29 and cover plate 37, this modular assembly being readily removeable and replaceable to facilitate servicing as necessary.<br><br><br><br>
