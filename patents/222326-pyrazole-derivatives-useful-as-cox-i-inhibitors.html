Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to pyrazole compounds having pharmacological activity, to a process for their production and to a pharmaceutical composition containing the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
The presence of two cyclooxygenase isoenzymes, cyclooxygenase-I (COX-I) and cyclooxygenase-II (COX-II) is known (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 88, 2692-2696 (1991)).<br>
Traditional non steroidal anti-inflammatory compounds (NSAIDs) have inhibiting activities of both COX-I and COX-II (J. Biol. Chem., 268, 6610-6614 (1993), etc).  The therapeutic use thereof involves undesired effects on the gastrointestinal tract, such as bleeding, erosions, gastric and intestinal ulcers, etc.<br>
It was reported that selective inhibition of COX-II shows anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities comparable with conventional NSAIDs but with a lower incidence of some gastrointestinal undesired effects (Pro. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 91, 3228-3232(1994)). Accordingly, various selective COX-II inhibitors have been prepared. However, it was reported that those "selective COX-II inhibitor" show some side-effects on kidney and/or insufficient efficacy on acute pains.<br>
Further, some compounds such as SC-560, mofezolac, etc, which have certain selective inhibiting activity against COX-I. WO98/57910 shows some compounds having such activity.  However, their selectivity of inhibiting COX -I does not seem to be enough to use them as a clinically<br><br>
acceptable and satisfactory analgesic agent due to their gastrointestinal disorders.<br>
WO02/055502 shows some pyridine derivatives having cyclooxygenase inhibiting activity, particularly cyclooxygenase-I inhibiting activity.  Further, WO03/040110 shows some triazole derivatives having cyclooxygenase inhibiting activity, particularly cyclooxygenase-I inhibiting activity. And WO99/51580 shows some triazole derivatives having an inhibiting activity of cytokine production.<br>

The Object compound (la) or its salt can be prepared by reacting a compound (II) or its salt with a compound (III) or its salt in the acidic condition, for example, by using acetic acid.<br>
Suitable salts of the compounds (la) and (III) may be the same as those exemplified for the compound (I).<br>
Suitable salt of the compound (II) maybe acid addition salt exemplified for the compound (I).<br>
The reaction is carried out in a conventional solvent<br><br>
such as water, an alcohol (e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, etc.), tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, etc. or a mixture of thereof.<br>
The reaction temperature is not critical and the reaction is usually carried out under cooling to heating.<br>
According to the starting material, the heterocyclic ring is formed but not to form pyrazole ring. In this case, the dehydration process is need to form pyrazole ring.<br>
The hydration process is carried out under the higher temperature.<br>
Process (2)<br>
The object compound (lb) or its salt can be prepared by reacting a compound (IV) or its salt with a compound (V) or its salt.<br>
Suitable salts of the compounds (la), (IV) and (V) may be the same as those exemplified for the compound (I).<br>
When the compound (V) having halogen for Q is used in this reaction, the reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a base such as alkali metal (e.g. sodium, potassium, etc. ) , an alkaline earth metal (e.g. magnesium, calcium, etc. ), the hydride or hydroxide or carbonate or bicarbonate thereof.<br>
When the compound (V) having hydroxy for Q is used in this reaction, the reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of diethyl azodicarboxylate and triphenylphosphine.<br>
The reaction is usually carried out in a conventional solvent which does not adversely influence the reaction such as water, dioxane, a alcohol (e.g. methanol, ethanol, etc.), acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, acetic acid, N,N-dimethylformamide, or a mixture thereof.<br>
The reaction temperature is not critical and the<br><br>
reaction can be carried out under cooling to heating.<br>
In order to illustrate the usefulness of the object compounds (I), the pharmacological test data of the com pounds (I) are shown in the following.<br>
[A]  ANALGESIC ACTIVITY :<br>
Effect on adjuvant arthritis in rats : (i)  Test Method :<br>
Analgesic activity of a single dose of agents in arthritic rats was studied.<br>
Arthritis was induced by injection of 0.5 mg of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Difco Laboratories, Detroit,<br>
Mich.) in 50ill  of liquid paraffin into the right hind footpad of Lewis rats aged 7 weeks. Arthritic rats were randomized and grouped (n=10) for drug treatment based on pain threshold of left hind paws and body weight on day 22. Drugs (Test compounds) were administered and the pain threshold was measured 2hrs after drug administration. The intensity of hyperalgesia was assessed by the method of Randall - Selitto. The mechanical pain threshold of the left hind paw (uninjected hind paw) was determined by compressing the ankle joint with a balance pressure apparatus (Ugo Basile Co.Ltd., Varese, Italy).  The threshold pressure of rats squeaking or struggling was expressed in grams.  The threshold pressure of rats treated with drugs was compared with that of non-treated rats. A dose showing the ratio of 1.5 is considered to be the effective dose.<br><br><br>
[B]  Inhibiting activity against COX-I and COX-II (Whole Blood Assay): (i)  Test Method : Whole blood assay for COX-I<br>
Fresh blood was collected by syringe without anticoagulants from volunteers with consent.  The subjects had no apparent inflammatory conditions and had not taken any medication for at least 7 days prior to blood collection.<br>
500^1 Aliquots of human whole blood were immediately incubated with 2/il of either dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle or a test compound at final concentrations for lhr at 37°C to allow the blood to clot. Appropriate treatments (no incubation) were used as blanks. At the end of the incubation, 5/il of 250mM Indomethacin was added to stop the reaction.  The blood was centrifuged at 6000 x g for<br>
5min at 4*C to obtain serum. A 100£6l aliquot of serum was mixed with 400/xl methanol for protein precipitation.  The<br><br>
supernatant was obtained by centrifuging at 6000 x g for<br>
5min at 4°C and was assayed for TXB2 using an  enzyme immunoassay kit according to the manufacturer' s procedure. For a test compound, the results were expressed as percent inhibition of thromboxane B2(TXB2) production relative to control incubations containing dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle. The data were analyzed by that a test compound at the indicated concentrations was changed log value and was applied simple linear regression.  IC50 value was calculated by least squares method.<br>
Whole blood assay  for COX-II<br>
Fresh blood was collected in heparinized tubes by syringe from volunteers with consent.  The subjects had no apparent inflammatory conditions and had not taken any medication for at least 7 days prior to blood collection.<br>
500£il aliquots of human whole blood were incubated with either 2/xl dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle or 2All of a test compound at final concentrations for 15 min at 37*0. This was followed by incubation of the blood with 10/xl of 5mg/ml lipopolysaccharide for 24hrs at 37°C for induction of COX-II. Appropriate PBS treatments (no LPS) were used as blanks. At the end of the incubation, the blood was centrifuged at 6000Xg for 5 min at 4°C to obtain plasma. A 100/i 1 aliquot of plasma was mixed with 400Atl methanol for protein precipitation.  The supernatant was obtained<br>
by centrifuging at 6000Xg for 5min at 4°C and was assayed for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) using a radioimmunoassay kit after conversion of PGE2 to its methyl oximate derivative according to the manufacturer's procedure.<br>
For a test compound, the results were expressed as percent inhibition of PGE2 production relative to control incubations containing dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle.  The<br><br>
data were analyzed by that a test compound at the indicated concentrations was changed log value and was applied simple linear regression.  IC50 value was calculated by least squares method.<br><br>

[C] Inhibiting activity on aggregation of platelet<br>
(i)  Methods<br>
Preparation of platelet-rich plasma<br>
Blood from healthy human volunteers was collected into plastic vessels containing 3.8% sodium citrate (1/10 volume). The subject had no taken any compounds for at least 7days prior to blood collection.  Platelet-rich plasma was obtained from the supernatant fraction of blood<br><br>
after centrifugation at 1200rpm. for lOmin.  Platelet-poor plasma was obtained by centrifugation of the remaining blood at 3000rpm for lOmin.<br>
Measurement of platelet aggregation<br>
Platelet aggregation was measured according to the turbidimetric method with an aggregometer (Hema Tracer)'. In the cuvette, platelet-rich plasma was pre-incubated for<br>
2min at 37*C after the addition of compounds or vehicle. In order to quantify the inhibitory effects of each compound, the maximum increase in light transmission was determined from the aggregation curve for 7min after the addition of agonist. We used collagen as agonist of platelet aggregation in this study.  The final concentration of collagen was 0.5]ig/mL. The effect of each compound was expressed as percentage inhibition agonist-induced platelet aggregation compared with vehicle treatment. Data are presented as the mean ± S .E.M. for six experiments.
