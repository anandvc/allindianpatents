				<td>This invention provides a method for separating solids dissolved or suspended in water-based solutions and recuperating reusable water and the solids and more specifically, relates to recovering 'useable water and solids salt and brackish water and water based solutions.<br>
Discussion of the Related Art<br>
Many techniques have been developed for separating liquids from solids in water-based compounds, such as where particles and substances are dissolved in or suspended in water. Examples of such compounds include solid and paniculate matter dissolved mixed, or in suspension in industrial and urban polluted waters, which may contain dissolved metals, dissolved complex organics, solvents and emulsions, radioactive contaminants and others. Other compounds include naturally occurring sea and brackish waters, mineralized waters or man made solutions used in industrial processes, food processing, fossil fuels extraction, mineral extraction and others. The present invention is suited for solid-liquid separation of all the above with very low capital and operating costs.<br>
Current separation methods use a variety of techniques for separating solids from their liquid bases. In general, the techniques focus on recovery of the solid component, neglecting the liquid. With respect to saline and contaminated waters, applied techniques are purposes at rejecting solid particulate and recovering the water base. In this latter case however, present inefficient separation methods result in a poor recovery and costly processing such as those that involve subjecting solutions to chemical treatments and heating; evaporating the liquids through boiling of the solutions and recovering some of the liquid through condensation; forcing the liquids through high pressure devices; and/or passing them through special membranes to retain some or all of the molecules of the dissolved particles.<br><br><br><br>
Current techniques for water production and treatment are numerous. However, -commercially implemented methods that are able to obtain fresh water from saline and/or contaminated waters are few, the main ones being distillation, reverse osmosis and electrodyalisis. Although substantially different in approach, each technique is fundamental flawed for efficient water recovery by being very energy-intensive. This, in turn, causes high capital and operating costs. Additionally, performances associated with each technique tend to be very low: 25% to 40% for distillation; 30% to 50% for reverse osmosis; and lower still for electrodyalisis.<br>
Most current water treatment systems for producing sizeable amounts of potable water require substantial amounts of energy in the form of heat and high pressures. As a result, the systems require expensive process equipment such as pressure vessels, heat exchangers and chemical digesters and processors. Major water treatment systems also involve filtration, which requires the use of expensive, perishable filtering organic membranes, thus are fettered by high capital and operating costs, which results in uneconomical recovery expenses.<br>
This high-energy dependency also tends to result in significantly low performance. If energy is equivalent of 'work', the amount of work applied to a given separation process is geometrically proportional to the amount of solids dissolved in the solutions. A solution having high-solid contents requires more work to separate the solids from the solution than a solution that has less solid contents. The more efficient processes, in the best of circumstances, require at least 50 joules per gram of solution treated, which far exceeds the 2.5 joules per gram theoretically needed for separating solids from its water base. This excess work lowers performances and substantially increases process costs.<br>
Some processes require high-temperature environments, gaseous high-speed currents or compressed air to effect the separation. Some processes involve drying by pulverizing heated solutions; atomizing hot liquids; drying in fluid beds; filtering through membranes; atomizing compressed air-liquid mixtures, etc. However, each process for solid-liquid separation application has serious limitations, especially in the separation of suspended or dissolved<br><br>
particles in water solutions. A major limitation is the requirement of an average of 2,000 joules per gram of solution treated. Mostly in the form of heat, electricity, high pressures or a combination of the three.<br>
In the separation of salts in sea and brackish waters, the use of compressed air to drive and atomize the saline solutions transfers the inefficiencies of a low performance energy-intensive driver, such as compressed air, resulting in operating costs equal or greater than other conventional desalination methods, such as distillation. Moreover, as compressed air disperses and diffuses the water vapor more than any other medium, the large masses of air mixed with the vapor require large condensing cooling devices, resulting in higher capital costs.<br>
Spanish patent number ES 2,018,732 issued May 1, 1991, to M.Lumbreras y Gimencz; and US Patent number 5,207,928 issued May 4, 1994 to E.J. Lemer describe generating, with compressed air, a stream of high-velocity saltwater droplets that vaporize without being heated. Salt precipitates from the vaporizing liquid and is recovered in a pan while the resulting water vapor is recovered by showering the water vapor with liquid water. Saltwater is mixed with compressed air. This mixture then is directed through an indistinct pneumatic nozzle that atomizes the mixture in a chamber where temperature and relative humidity are at ambient(room) levels. The volume and effect of compressed air mixed with water and the high velocity of the mixture at the nozzle exit not only limits the volume of water that can be recovered, but diffuses the vapor inside the chamber by an entrained air mass that is approximately 30 times large at a short distance from the nozzle's orifice. Diffusing water vapor into the chamber supersaturates the ambient air. At a relative humidity of 100% or more, air is unable to provide the energy necessary for evaporation, which impedes the process. Also large amounts of air induce die diffused vapor to recombine with the separated salt particles.<br>
US Patent no. 4,323,424 issued April 7, 1982 to D.J. Secunda et. al. Also addresses desalinization. However, both the '424 and the '928 patents do not address the formation of micron-sized, non-evaporated droplers that are indistinguishable from vapor. This reduces the amount of fresh water produced. Fresh water production is further complicated by the minute<br><br>
size of the droplets, typically 1 to 10 microns in dtuncier. Once the droplets evaporate, the resulting salt particles are of sub-micron size. For example, a saline droplet of 1 micron in diameter, with an average NaCl content of 3.5% by weight, as it is the case with ssawater, would precipitate a particle less than 1/50U of one micron in diameter. According to Stokes' Velocity of Sedimentation Law, particles up to 1 micron in diameter tend to behave as molecules and remain suspended in the air for indefinite periods, thus are able to recombine with the water vapor. For brackish waters with salt content of 0.5% by weight or less, processing is very difficult, as the solid salt particles would have diameters smaller ttian 0.005 microns. Only droplets of 30 microns in diameter and up will shed salt particles large enough to fall quickly by gravity. Thus, far from dropping to the bottom of the chamber as thess patents describe, salt particles derived from droplets less than 30 microns in diameter will remain suspended in the air for an undetermined amount of time, recombine with the water vapor produced and be transported with the vapor to the recovery chamber, driven by blower-produced air currents. Thus, the collected liquid will be mostly saltwater.<br>
Additionally, i eubctsntial amount of vapor ic produced by the email wotar droplets that readily mixes with the large masses of ambient (secondary) air entrained by the initial compressed (primary) air at nozzle exit. This rapidly spreading vapor not only cannot change into water mist, since the large masses of entrained air impede condensation, but the vapor also fills the chamber quickly. A chamber filled with v&amp;por causes an entropy dilemma, whereby the increase in overall humidity levels saturates the chamber, exhausting the potential for evaporation of the secondary air. This vapor win w:mn up and expand. Ibis in turn disables the remaining air from vaporizing additional droplets. Without heat from the secondary air, the separation process stops.<br>
Some of the techniques described counter these adverse effects by generating an ambient air current in an upward and oblique direction with a fan or blower at successive intervals from the lower portion of the chamber. However, the air current crossing the path of the suspended sub-micron salt particles fuses the salt particles with expanded fresh water vapor. Further, the<br><br>
intermittent blower also tends to rccombine a portion of the separated water with larger salt particlw, falling to the bottom of the chamber when the bloxvwr ic off. Tin blowv tquipmant also increases capital and operating expenses, thus increasing the final cost of any suitable water collected.<br>
Although these techniques support a tow air-water ratio of 1:10, the use of a compressor consumes over 18 kW/h per cubic meter of fresh water produced. This high power consumption renders the process non-competitive with current desalination techniques, such as distillation, which uses less power.<br>
In view of the above, producing inexpensive', reusable water requires a separation process that derives a product with the least possible work. Economically obtaining reusable water from contaminated or sea/brackish waters ideally should separate the contaminants and salts from their liquid bases at normalized or standard room temperature and pressure (STP). A water recovery process that operates at STP eliminates the need for energy-intensive process engineering that otherwise would be needed to drive the separation. Unfortunately, none of the foregoing provides a method and apparatus for economical solid-liquid separation in water base solutions that separates contaminants and salts from their liquid bases at standard room temperature and pressure. None of the aforementioned references, taken alone or in combination, are seen as teaching or suggesting th« presently claimed Method and Apparatus for Economical Solid-Liquid Separation in Water-Based Solutions.<br>

The invention exploits the super-efficient transference of room air's latent heat to water-based solutions to effect evaporation when the solutions are forced into low-pressure areas. This heat transfer occurs when a feed is injected at high velocities into a chamber where it evaporates upon impact with still air. The transfer takes place in the high-energy, low-pressure regions created by the high velocity jet solution, evaporating all the water therein. While evaporating, the solid contents present in the feed precipitate. As the vapor leaves the low-pressure regions, the vapor re-condenses into substantially pure water.<br>
Utilizing the latent heat present in the ambient air for evaporation of water feed at room temperature and local pressure drastically reduces the energy Deeded to obtain a unit of fresh water, dramatically enhancing performance and reducing both capital and operating costs. Avoiding high pressures or compressed air and producing water in its liquid form instead of vapor, eliminates expensive process equipment, such as boilers, heat pumps, heat exchangers, compressors, high-pressure pumps and membranes. The corresponding reduction in the amount of process equipment reduces substantially capital expenditures in a water treatment plant, while obtaining significant savings on operating costs. Additionally, as the invention promotes reusable water in liquid form, the plant can use relatively compact devices, further reducing capiul vw»U. Fuiilly, M the contaminated or satin* liquidc ar* not chemically prf-trwatcri r\r pr«-beated, the water produced does not require pacifying or cooling, does not need chemical digesters and processors, and is ready for consumption. The simplicity of processing equipment increases overall performance, which can approach !&gt;0%.<br>

Food processing also benefits from the present separation method because the inv<mtion eliminates costly heated preparation processes. also cleaning oil spills contaminated ground water urban runoff and></mtion><br>

The invention is a method and an apparatus for economical solid-liquid separation in water-based solutions that separates solid contaminants from their liquid bases at standard room temperature and pressure with minimal energy requirements.<br>
For a pure liquid in equilibrium in its vapor phase, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation and Gibbs phase rule can be used to determine the water-vapor curve, or evaporation curve, as shown in Fig. 1. If the temperature is above 0.098C, the triple-point temperature, the only occurring phases are the liquid end vapor phases. If all values of temperature T and pressure P arc allowed, the T, P plane is divided into three regions: solid, liquid and vapor. These three regions define a liquid-solid curve, a solid-vapor curve and a liquid-vapor curve, as shown. The three curves coincide at the triple point. For water, this triple point occurs at T- 0.098C and P-0.07 atm. The curves show that water vapor can exist at very low temperatures, so long as pressure is sufficiently low.<br>
A liquid in a container at a pressure below the; pressure of water vapor in the container (0.04 atm at 30C) will vaporize very quickly and cool simultaneously as it does so. With water, a aero value of "f' in the Gibbs phase rule, the evaporating Jiquid derives the energy needed for evaporation from the surrounding ambient air. Introducing high-velocity water/air currents into the container at or near sonic speeds causes low pressure areas, c.g. below 0.04 atm, to form in the wake of each spherical droplet This low pressure induces the droplets inio a bydrodynamic phase change. Aerodynanucally, this phenomenon is similar to the one that creates a region of low pressure under the wing of a plane and provides lift.<br>
Experiments done by the inventor using Phas s Doppler Iiuerferometry and Particle Analyzer Aaemometry analytical instrumentation, revealed that water droplets in a stream moving at sonic velocities inside an open-ended chamber tend to entrain each other, thus reducing collectivehydrodynamic surface and opposition to friction. At velocities needed to overcome the sound barrier, greater friction enhances: the collection of heat, which coalesces into<br><br>
vortices spinning from the surrounding air along the edge of the shock waves. It is in these highly energetic vortices that the droplets, already unstable and near the phase change point, experience the heat transfer necessary to evaporate.<br>
When all the solution has evaporated, the only remaining substances from the traveling droplets are residual solid particles which, unlike the water in the solution, cannot evaporate.    . Once liquid-free, these solid particles fuse with each other, forced by the kinetic energy generated in the entrainraent zone, forming large solid clusters, which precipitate out of the current by gravity.<br>
As the entrainment flow loses velocity, the compact residue-free vapor travels a few milliseconds due to momentum, leaving behind the low-pressure, turbulent heat-evaporating regions and entering a normalized pressure environment of room air. It is in this normal environment that the vapor experiences another fast hydrodynamic phase change and condenses instantly into liquid mist. As it condenses, the mist liberates heat, thus returning most of the energy taken from the air and helping to maintain the energy balance of the process indefinitely.<br>
According to the foregoing, the method uncierlying the invention is predicated on the following classical physics poatulates: (1) the injeclion of a water solution into a chamber, where, at room temperature, the solution evaporates, forcing the precipitation of the impurities dissolved or suspended in the water; (2) the immediate condensation of the vapor into liquid water mist; (3) the subsequent condensation of the mist into running water, and (4) the fresh water departing the apparatus by gravity.<br>
Referring to Figs. 2 and 3, an embodiment configured according to principles of the invention includes sonic nozzles 10 capable of impelling liquid solutions without compressed air. The sonic nozzles 10 accelerate the solutions from I&gt;0 to 300 m/s in order to develop a jet stream of liquid droplets.<br>
The solution is injected into a non-pressuriz<:d open-ended evaporation-condensation chamber such that ejection is substantially verticil. vertical aids in breaking the solution into droplets. ideally droplets attain a no smaller than microns and larger></:d><br>
than 100 microns in diameter. This size range promotes complete evaporation of the solution and discourages recombination of the solid partichss with the evaporated water.<br>
The evaporation-condensation chamber 20 has an open-ended top and bottom. The evaporation-condensation chamber 20 maybe assembled from a fiberglass cylinder encased in a steel container.<br>
An injection pump 30 injects feed solution through a pipe 32 and manifold 34 into the evaporation-condensation chamber 20 through the battery of sonic nozzles 10. Preferably, the nozzles 10 are disposed in concentric circles in a horizontal plane, as shown in Fig. 3. The solution flows vertically from the nozzle orifices ir..to the chamber 20 at sufficient velocity to break the liquid solution into small droplets and create low-pressure regions along the wake of the; droplets.<br>
The invention also includes nucleating screens 40 made of Partially Oriented Yam (POY) nylon polyamide. POY permits texturing the resultant material with microscopic diabolo-typc holes running the length of the screens 40 and accepts etched channels to nucleate the mist. POY has a high absorbing capacity for water mist, thus facilitates rapid nucleation of the mist and its transformation into running streams of fresh water, without washing the mist with artificially generated showers. The screens 40 are positioned, ut angles to each other, at intervals long the length of the chamber 20 so as to capture all mist crsated in the evaporation-condensation chamber 20, and impede any mist from escaping from the chamber 20,<br>
In the interior of the chamber 20, all of the liquid ir. the front line droplets rapidly evaporates at a short height, t.g. 15 to 30 cm, from each nozzle orifice, within a few milliseconds. The jets' momentum carries the instantly evaporated water masses into re-condensing particle-free droplets and a dense water mist, which quickly approaches and is absorbed by the nucleating screens. This absorption is accelerated by the upward vertical draft generated both by the temperature differential generated by the evaporation-condensation process and the pressure differential created by entry of air a: the bottom and egress of the air from the top of the chamber. The fresh water mist adheres to ihe \vater-nucleating screens, which have<br><br>
lowcr edges that rest in a cylinder channel 25 encircling the evaporation-condensation dumber 20. When saturated with water, the screens 40 swiftly shed the mist into the channel 25 in running streams. The channel 25 flushes the water outside of the apparatus by gravity through a fresh water exit 27. The water is received in a collecting water tank or water main.<br>
During evaporation of the solution, particles dissolved in the solution, but not evaporated, precipitate and drop by gravity between the nozzles into ft cyclone or particle distributor/collector 50. The particle distributor/collector 50 deposits the particles into a receptacle 52. From ths receptacle 52, the particles either are removed by it conveyor belt or accumulate in a removable container to be disposed of periodically.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, the battery of nozzles 10 arc arranged along concentric arrays of manifolds 15 through which the solution is distributed to the nozzles 10. The nozzles 10 point vertically in such a manner as to deliver the liquid, create the droplets, and urge the ensuing vapor and condensed water mist toward the nucleating screens. The nozzles have orifices with diameters ranging between 0.75 and 1.23 mm. Th: nozzles are capable of injecting between 0.2 and 1.5 liters per minute of solution with dissolved or suspended particles. The nozzles produce spherical droplets with diameters between 30 and 80 microns.<br>
The outside ambient air entering the apparatus provides more than enough energy for the feed solution phase changes. Additionally, the upward draft of the .air through the chamber 20 contributes to drawing the water mist into the nucleating screens 40. Thus, the process is continuous and self-sufficient, without need of supplementary power-driven equipment<br>
A preferred method for producing liquid-droplets for evaporation and subsequent condensation entails: the generation of dense fresh water mist at approximately 30 cm from the nozzle orifices. The mist should be free of particles or solids and have a density between 12 to 18 kg per cubic meter of mist. Generation of the dense fresh water mist should be continuous and non-pulsating, yet discourage accumulating a suspension of fresh water droplets which would supersaturate of the evaporation-condensation area. The fresh water mist should saturate the condensation area with a density ofl to 3 kg of'mist per square meter per second, but without<br><br>
accumulations, until all of mist has been absorbed by the nucleating screens. The mist then combines to form running water.<br>
The method also provides for separation of th« solid particles dissolved or suspended in the liquid, and allowing the panicles to drop by gravity from the evaporation-condensation area, through separations between nozzles in the manifold. The particles are evacuated without recombining with Ihc vapor or the fresh water mist.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention provides for recovering the fresh water mist by locating layers of water-collecting screens 40 in a serial or staggered manner. The screens 40 are positioned at angles with one another, the angles being between 30 and 60 degrees with respect -the main cylinder of the apparatus or flow direction. The edges of the screens rest in the encircling water channel 25, just inside the evaporation-condensation chamber 20. The first screen 40 is positioned approximately 30 cm from the nozzle orifices and has a total surface area of approximately 10 square meters. Recovery of the fresh water from the mist in the collecting screens occurs by virtue of the momentum caused by the ejection jet and does not require artificially generated air currents in order to transpor; the mist outside of the evaporation-condensation area. Fresh water from the; collecting screens 40 is delivered into the circular water channel 25 surrounding the evaporation-condensation area, which transports the water outside of the apparatus, by gravity.<br>
A preferred embodiment of a water treatment plant configured according to principles of the invention produce 15 to 20 cubic meters per day of a treated solution, depending on particutate concentration and climatic conditions. The nozzles 10 should be situated m manifold arrays to create a mist suspension of 0.06 liters per second/per nozzle with a density between 10 to 18 kg per cubic meter of mist. The shape and height of the cylindrical chamber 20 should be configured to circulate sufficient masses of ambient air to supply the necessary energy to effect the phase changes necessary for the separation proems and the resultant intemal temperature differential due to the phase changes. The sonic nozzles 10 should be able to propel 0.40 liters per minute of solution per nozzle unit and create droplets having diameters of 30 to 100 microns.<br><br>
Each nozzle orifice should have a diameter bctwein 0.75 and 1.5-nun. The nozzles should be arranged so as to allow for the creation of clumps of particles rased together, separated from the vapor, which drop by gravity outside of the liquid jets, without interfering in the upward motion of the jets, and without recombining with the liqu: d.<br>
Referring to Figs. 5 and 6, a nozzle 10 configured according to principles of the invention provides a sonic.dSect, a relatively raonodisperse droplet size and has a flow capacity of approximately zero to 235 kg per hour. The nozzle 10 receives solutions to be treated through the body of the nozzle through a narrow channel 1L The channel K expands into a cone-shaped chamber I From the chamber I, the solution passes through a turbulent-making area M. The turbulent making area provides a serrated surface .generally orthogonal to the flow direction. Since expansion takes place in an inverse current -.flow, liquid is accelerated until it exits through orifice B. The orifice B has aa area that is a fraction of the size of the base diameter of the cone.<br>
Refrcrring also to Fig. 7, through orifice C the liquid is further accelerated. Upon exiting at orifice C, the pressure differencial with ambient eavironment produces a vacuum effect, which draws a column of exterior air through orifices J and D. At the exit of this column of air is an expansion ring G ofless than 0.5 mm thickness which coincides with another expansion ring that is approximately 3.5 mm thick and has a smaller diameter size than orifice C. The rushing liquid and drawn air are mixed in the volume defined within the expansion ring, building substantial pressure before evacuating through die orifice C.<br>
The mixture flows through an expanding chamber, between apertures C to B, the sides of which define an angle N relative to the flow direction. The angle N is a multiple of the liquid exit-orifice angle inside the nozzle chamber and the liquid-air mixture exit orifice angle. The aspired air mixed in the volume defined by the expansion ring further accelerates the liquid and induces turbulence in the near-vacuum environment near the nozzle orifice L The initial liquid pressure at (he injection pump head, plus the liquid pressure differential at the exit and the orifice angle all contribute to accelerate the liquid to the point that, at nozzle exit E, the liquid accelerates to sonic velocity.<br><br>
Because the liquid exits the nozzle containing a minimum amount of air, there is little fractioninting Of tint liquid, resulting in a monodispcirse spectrum of droplets with controllable size ranges related to the pressure of the injected solution.<br>
The dimensions for &amp; preferred embodiment; of the nozzle 10 are substantially as follows:<br><br>
