Possible salts for compounds of the formula I -depending on substitution - are all acid addition salts or all salts with bases. Particular mention may be made of the pharmacologically tolerable salts of the inorganic and organic acids and bases customarily used in pharmacy. Those suitable are, on the one hand, water-soluble and water-insoluble acid addition salts with acids such as, for example, hydrochloric<br>
7<br><br>
acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, citric acid, D-gluconic acid, benzoic acid, 2-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid, butyric acid, sulfosalicylic acid, maleic acid, lauric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, embonic acid, stearic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid or 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, it being possible to employ the acids in salt preparation - depending on whether a mono- or polybasic acid is concerned and depending on which salt is desired - in an equimolar quantitative ratio or one differing therefrom.<br>
On the other hand, salts with bases are also suitable. Examples of salts with bases which may be mentioned are alkali metal (lithium, sodium, potassium) or calcium, aluminum, magnesium, titanium, ammonium, meglumine or guanidinium salts, where here too the bases are employed in salt preparation in an equimolar quantitative ratio or one differing therefrom.<br>

The compounds of the formula I are chiral compounds having cniral centers in positions 4a and 10b and, depending on the meaning of the substituents R3, R31, R4, R5 and R51, further chiral centers in the positions 1,2,3 and 4. Numbering:<br><br>
The invention therefore comprises all conceivable pure diastereomers and pure<br>
enantiomers and their mixtures in any mixing ratio, including the racemates. The<br>
compounds of the formula I are preferred in which the hydrogen atoms in positions<br>
4a and 10b are cis to one another. The pure cis enantiomers are particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
In this connection, particularly preferred compounds of the formula I are those in<br>
which positions 4a and 10b nave the same absolute configuration as the compound (-<br>
18<br><br>
)<is-l employable as a starting compound and having the optical rotation ethanol enantiomers can be separated in manner known per se example by preparation separation of appropriate diastereoisomeric compounds preferably an enantiomer is carried out at stage formula iv></is-l><br>
for example by means of salt formation of the racemic compounds of the formula IV with optically active carboxylic acids. Examples which may be mentioned in this connection are the enantiomeric forms of mandelic acid, tartaric acid, 0,0'-dibenzoyltartaric acid, camphoric acid, quinic acid, glutamic acid, malic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, 3-bromocamphorsulfonic acid, a-methoxyphenylacetic acid, -methoxy- -trifluoromethylphenylacetic acid and 2-phenylpropionic acid. Alternatively, enantiomerically pure starting compounds of the formula IV can also be prepared via asymmetric syntheses.<br>
The preparation of the compounds of the formula I in which Rl, R2, R3, R31, R4, R5, R51, R6, R13 and R20 have the meanings indicated above and their salts can be carried out, for example, by the process described below in greater detail. The process comprises cyclocondensing compounds of the formula II<br><br>
in which Rl, R2, R3, R31, R4, R5, R51, R6, R13 and R20 have the meanings indicated above, and, optionally, then converting the compounds of the formula I obtained<br>
19<br><br>
into their salts, or, optionally, then converting salts of the compounds of the formula<br>
I obtained into the free compounds.<br>
Compounds of the formula I obtained can be converted, optionally, into further<br>
compounds of the formula I by derivatization.<br>
For example, from compounds of the formula I in which<br>
a)	R12 and/or R13 and/or R20 are an ester group, the corresponding acids can be obtained by acidic or alkaline hydrolysis, or the corresponding amides can be prepared by reaction with suitably substituted amines;<br>
b)	R12 and/or R20 are a l-4C-alkylcarbonyloxy group, the corresponding hydroxyl compounds can be obtained by acidic or alkaline hydrolysis;<br>
c)	one or more of the radicals RIO, R12, R13 and R20 are a nitro group, the corresponding amino compounds, which, for their part, can again be further derivatized, can be obtained by selective catalytic hydrogenation. The methods mentioned under a), b) and c) are expediently carried out analogously to the methods known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the formula I can be converted, optionally, into their N-oxides, for example with the aid of hydrogen peroxide in methanol or with the aid of m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in dichloromethane. The person skilled in the art is familiar on the basis of his/her expert knowledge with the reaction conditions which are specifically necessary for carrying out the N-oxidation.<br>
The cyclocondensation is carried out in a manner known per se to the person skilled in the art, according to Bischler-Napieralski (e.g. as described in J. Chem. Soc., 1956, 4280-4282) in the presence of a suitable condensing agent, such as, for example, polyphosphoric acid, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus pentoxide or preferably phosphorus oxychloride, in a suitable inert solvent, e.g. in a chlorinated hydrocarbon such as chloroform, or in a cyclic hydrocarbon such as toluene or xylene, or another inert solvent such as acetonitrile, or without further solvent using an excess of condensing agent, preferably at elevated temperature, in particular at the boiling temperature of the solvent or condensing agent used. Compounds of the formula H in which Rl, R2, R3, R31, R4, R5, R51, R6, R13 and R20 have   the   meanings   indicated   above   are   accessible   from   the   corresponding<br>
20<br><br>
compounds of the formula IV, in which Rl, R2, R3, R31, R4, R5 and R51 have the meanings indicated above, by reaction with compounds of the formula III,<br><br><br><br><br>
in which R6, R13 and R20 have the meanings indicated above and X represents a<br>
suitable leaving group, preferably a chlorine atom. For example, the acylation or<br>
benzoylation is carried out as described in the following examples or as in J. Chem.<br>
Soc. (C), 1971,1805-1808.<br>
Compounds of the formula III and compounds of the formula IV are either known or<br>
can be prepared in a known manner.<br>
The compounds of the formula IV can be prepared, for example, from compounds of<br>
the formula V,<br><br>
in which Rl, R2, R3, R31, R4, R5 and R51 have the abovementioned meanings, by<br>
reduction of tixe nitro group.<br>
The reduction is carried out in a manner known to the person skilled in the art, for<br>
example as described in J. Org. Chem. 1962,27,4426 or as described in the following<br>
examples.<br>
The reduction can be carried out, for example, by catalytic hydrogenation, e.g. in the<br>
presence of Raney nickel, in a lower alcohol such as methanol or ethanol at room<br>
temperature and under normal or elevated pressure. Optionally, a catalytic amount<br>
of an acid, such as, for example, hydrocMoric acid, can be added to tine solvent<br>
21<br><br>
Preferably, however, the reduction is carried out using metals such as zinc or iron with organic acids such as acetic acid or mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid. The compounds of the formula IV in which Rl, R2, R3, R31 and R4 have the meanings indicated above and R5 and R51 together represent an additional bond can be prepared from the corresponding compounds of the formula V by selective reduction of the nitro group in a manner known to the person skilled in the art, for example in the presence of Raney nickel in a lower alcohol as solvent using hydrazine hydrate as a hydrogen donor.<br>
The compounds of the formula V, in which Rl, R2, R3, R31 and R4 have the meanings indicated above and R5 and R51 are hydrogen, are either known or can be prepared from corresponding compounds of the formula V in which R5 and R51 together are an additional bond. The reaction can be carried out in a manner known to the person skilled in the art, preferably by hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst, such as, for example, palladium on active carbon, e.g. as described in J. Chem. Soc. (C), 1971,1805-1808.<br>
The compounds of the formula V, in which R5 and R51 together are an additional bond, are either known or can be obtained by the reaction of compounds of the formula VI, <br>
in which Rl and R2 have the meanings mentioned above, with compounds of the formula VII,<br>
R3-CH=C(R4)-C(R4)=CH-R31 (VII)<br>
in which R3, R31 and R4 have the meanings mentioned above.<br>
Compounds of the formula V in which R5 and R51 together are an additional bond<br>
and R3 and R31 together are a l-4C-alkylene group can be obtained, for example, by<br>
reaction of cyclic compounds of the formula VII, in which R4 has the meanings<br>
indicated above and R3 and R31 together are a l-4C-alkylene group [e.g. cyclohexa-<br>
1,3-diene,	23-dimefhylcyclohexa-l,3-diene,	cyclohepta-l,3-diene,	2,3-<br>
22<br><br>
dimethylcyclohepta-l,3-diene or cycloocta-l,3-diene] with compounds of the formula VI in which Rl and R2 have the abovementioned meanings. The cydoaddition is in this case carried out in a manner known to the person skilled in the art according to Diels-Alder, e.g. as described in J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1957, 79, 6559 or in J. Org. Chem. 1952,17,581 or as described in the following examples. Compounds of the fonnula V obtained in the cydoaddition, in which the phenyl ring and the nitro group are trans to one another, can be converted in a manner known to the person skilled in the art into the corresponding cis compounds, e.g. as described in J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1957, 79, 6559 or as described in the following examples.<br>
The compounds of the formulae VI and VII are either known or can be prepared in a known manner. The compounds of the formula VI can be prepared, for example, in a manner known to the person skilled in the art from corresponding compounds of the formula VIII as described, for example, in J. Chem. Soc. 1951, 2524 or in J. Org. Chem. 1944,9,170 or as described in the following examples. The compounds of the formula VIII,<br><br>
in which Rl and R2 have the meanings indicated above, are either known or can be prepared in a manner known to the person skilled in the art, as described, for example, in Ber. Dtsch. Chem. Ges. 1925,58,203.<br>
It is moreover known to the person skilled in the art that if there are a number of reactive centers on a starting or intermediate compound it may be necessary to block one or more reactive centers temporarily by protective groups in order to allow a reaction to proceed specifically at the desired reaction center. A detailed description for the use of a large number of proven protective groups is found, for example, in T.W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The isolation and purification of the substances according to the invention is carried out in a manner known per se, e.g. by distilling off the solvent in vacuo and<br>
23<br><br>
recrystallizing the resulting residue from a suitable solvent or subjecting it to one of the customary purification methods, such as, for example, column chromatography on suitable support material.<br>
Salts are obtained by dissolving the free compound in a suitable solvent (e.g. a ketone, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or methyl isobutyl ketone, an ether, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, such as methylene chloride or chloroform, or a low molecular weight aliphatic alcohol such as ethanol or isopropanol) which contains the desired acid or base, or to which the desired acid or base is then added. The salts are obtained by filtering, reprecipitating, precipitating with a nonsolvent for the addition salt or by evaporating the solvent. Salts obtained can be converted by alkalization or by acidification into the free compounds, which in turn can be converted into salts. In this way, pharmacologically intolerable salts can be converted into pharmacologically tolerable salts.<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the invention further without restricting it. Likewise, further compounds of the formula I, whose preparation is not explicitly described, can be prepared in an analogous manner or in a manner familiar per se to the person skilled in the art using customary process techniques. In the examples, m.p stands for melting point, h for hour(s), RT for room temperature, EF for empirical formula, MW for molecular weight, calc. for calculated, fnd for found. The compounds mentioned in the examples and their salts are a preferred subject of the invention.<br>

phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors (namely of type 4), they are suitable on the one hand as bronchial therapeutics (for the treatment of airway obstructions on account of their dilating but also on account of their respiratory rate- or respiratory drive-increasing action) and for the elimination of erectile dysfunction on account of the vasodilating action, but on the other hand especially for the treatment of disorders, in particular of inflammatory nature, e.g. of the airways (asthma prophylaxis), of the skin, of the central nervous system, of the intestine, of the eyes and of the joints, which are mediated by mediators such as histamine, PAF (platelet-activating factor), arachidonic acid derivatives such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins, cytokines, interleukins, chemokines, alpha-, beta- and gamma-interferon, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or oxygen radicals and proteases. The compounds according to the invention are distinguished here by low toxicity, good enteral absorption (high bioavailability), a large therapeutic breadth and the absence of significant side-effects. On account of their PDE-inhibiting properties, the compounds according to the invention can be employed in human and veterinary medicine and therapeutics, where they can be used, for example, for the treatment and prophylaxis of the following illnesses: acute and chronic (in particular inflammatory and allergen-induced) airway disorders of various origins (bronchitis, allergic bronchitis, bronchial asthma, emphysema, COPD); dermatoses (especially of proliferative, inflammatory and allergic type) such as, for example, psoriasis (vulgaris), toxic and allergic contact eczema, atopic eczema, seborrheic eczema, lichen simplex, sunburn, pruritus in the anogenital area, alopecia areata, hypertrophic scars, discoid lupus erythematosus, follicular and wide-area pyodermias, endogenous and exogenous acne, acne rosacea and other proliferative, inflammatory and allergic skin disorders; disorder which are based on an excessive release of TNF and leukotrienes, e.g. disorders of the arthritis type (rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis and other arthritic conditions), disorders of the immune system (AIDS, multiple sclerosis), graft-versus-host reactions, transplant rejection reactions, symptoms of shock [septic shock, endotoxin shock, gram-negative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome and ARDS (adult respiratory distress syndrome)], and generalized inflammations in the gastrointestinal area (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis);<br>
44<br><br>
disorders which are based on allergic and/or chronic, faulty immunological reactions in the area of the upper airways (pharynx, nose) and the adjacent regions (paranasal sinuses, eyes), such as, for example, allergic rhinitis/sinusitis, chronic rhinitis/ sinusitis, allergic conjunctivitis and nasal polyps; but also disorders of the heart which can be treated by PDE inhibitors, such as, for example, cardiac insufficiency, or disorders which can be treated on account of the tissue-relaxant action of the PDE inhibitors, such as, for example, erectile dysfunction or colics of the kidneys and the ureters in connection with kidney stones. In addition, the compounds according to the invention can be employed for the treatment of diabetes insipidus and disorders in connection with disturbances of brain metabolism, such as, for example, cerebral senility, senile dementia (Alzheimer's dementia), multiinfarct dementia or alternatively disorders of the CNS, such as, for example, depressions or arteriosclerotic dementia.<br>
A further subject of the invention is a process for the treatment of mammals, including man, which are suffering from one of the abovementioned illnesses. The process comprises administering to the sick mammal a therapeutically efficacious and pharmacologically tolerable amount of one or more of the compounds according to the invention.<br>
The invention further relates to the compounds according to the invention for use in the treatment of mammals, including man, which are suffering from one of the abovementioned illnesses. The process comprises administering to the sick mammal a therapeutically efficacious and pharmacologically tolerable amount of one or more of the compounds according to the invention.<br>
The invention further relates to the compounds according to the invention for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of illnesses, in particular the illnesses mentioned. The invention likewise relates to the use of the compounds according to the invention for the production of medicaments which are employed for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the illnesses mentioned.<br>
Medicaments for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the illnesses mentioned, which contain one or more of the compounds according to the invention, are furthermore a subject of the invention.<br>
45<br><br>
A further subject of the invention is a commercial product, consisting of a customary secondary pack, a primary pack containing the medicament (for example an ampoule or a blister pack) and, optionally, a pack insert, the medicament exhibiting antagonistic action against cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases of type 4 (PDE4) and leading to the attenuation of the symptoms of illnesses which are connected with cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases of type 4, and the suitability of the medicament for the prophylaxis or treatment of illnesses which are connected "with cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases of the type 4 being indicated on the secondary pack and/or on the pack insert of the commercial product, and the medicament containing one or more compounds of the formula I according to the invention. The secondary pack, the primary pack containing the medicament and the pack insert otherwise comply with what would be regarded as standard to the person skilled in the art for medicaments of this type.<br>
The medicaments are prepared by processes which are known per se and familiar to the person skilled in the art. As medicaments, the compounds according to the invention (= active compounds) are either employed as such, or preferably in combination with suitable pharmaceutical excipients, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, capsules, suppositories, patches, emulsions, suspensions, gels or solutions, the active compound content advantageously being between 0.1 and 95%. The person skilled in the art is familiar on the basis of his/her expert knowledge with the excipients which are suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulations. In addition to solvents, gel-forming agents, ointment bases and other active compound vehicles, it is possible to use, for example, antioxidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, preservatives, solubilizers or permeation promoters. For the treatment of disorders of the respiratory tract, the compounds according to the invention are preferably also administered by inhalation. For this, these are either administered directly as a powder (preferably in micronized form) or by nebulization of solutions or suspensions which contain them. With respect to the preparations and administration forms, reference is made, for example, to the details in European Patent 163 965.<br>
46<br><br>
For the treatment of dermatoses, the compounds according to the invention are in particular used in the form of those medicaments which are suitable for topical application. For the production of the medicaments, the compounds according to the invention (= active compounds) are preferably mixed with suitable pharmaceutical excipients and further processed to give suitable pharmaceutical formulations. Suitable pharmaceutical formulations which may be mentioned are, for example, powders, emulsions, suspensions, sprays, oils, ointments, fatty ointments, creams, pastes, gels or solutions.<br>
The medicaments according to the invention are prepared by methods known per se. Dosage of the active compounds takes place in the order of magnitude customary for PDE inhibitors. Thus topical application forms (such as, for example, ointments) for the treatment of dermatoses contain the active compounds in a concentration of, for example, 0.1-99%. The dose for administration by inhalation is customarily between 0.1 and 3 mg per day. The customary dose in the case of systemic therapy (p.o. or i.v.) is between 0.03 and 3 mg per kilogram per day.<br>
Biological investigations<br>
In the investigation of PDE4 inhibition at the cellular level, the activation of inflammatory cells has particular importance. As an example, the FMLP (N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine)-induced superoxide production of neutrophilic granulocytes may be mentioned, which can be measured as luminol-potentiated chemoluminescence [McPhail LC, Strum SL, Leone PA and Sozzani S, The neutrophil respiratory burst mechanism. In "Immunology Series" 1992, 57,47-76; ed. Coffey RG (Marcel Decker, Inc. New York-Basle-Hong Kong)]. Substances which inhibit chemoluminescence and cytokine secretion and the secretion of inflammatory mediators on inflammatory cells, in particular neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytes, T lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages, are those which inhibit PDE4. This isoenzyme of the phosphodiesterase families is particularly represented in granulocytes. Its inhibition leads to an increase in the intracellular cyclic AMP concentration and thus to the inhibition of cell activation. PDE4 inhibition by the substances according to the<br>
47<br><br>
invention is thus a central indicator of the suppression of inflammatory processes (Glembycz MA, Could isoenzyme-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors render bronchodilatory therapy redundant in the treatment of bronchial asthma?. Biochem Pharmacol 1992, 43, 2041-2051; Torphy TJ et al., Phosphodiesterase inhibitors: new opportunities for treatment of asthma. Thorax 1991, 46, 512-523; Schudt C et al., Zardaverine: a cyclic AMP PDE 3/4 inhibitor. In "New Drugs for Asthma Therapy", 379-402, BirkMuser Verlag Basle 1991; Schudt C et al., Influence of selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors on human neutrophil functions and levels of cAMP and Ca; Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol 1991, 344, 682-690; Tenor H and Schudt C, Analysis of PDE isoenzyme profiles in cells and tissues by pharmacological methods. In "Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors", 21-40, "The Handbook of Immunopharmacology", Academic Press, 1996; Hatzelmann A et aL, Enzymatic and functional aspects of dual-selective PDE3/4-inhibitors. In "Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors", 147-160. "The Handbook of Immunopharmacology", Academic Press, 1996).<br>
Inhibition Oof PDE4 activity. Methodology<br>
The activity test was carried out according to the method of Bauer and Schwabe, which was adapted to microtiter plates (Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1980, 311,193-198). The PDE reaction takes place in the first step here. In a second step, the resulting 5-nucleotide is cleaved by a 5'-nucloeadase of the snake venom of Crotalus atrox to the uncharged nucleoside. In the third step, the nucleoside is separated from the remaining charged substrate on ion-exchange columns. The columns are eluted directly into minivials, into which 2 ml of scintillator fluid are additionally added, for counting using 2 ml of 30 mM ammonium formate (pH 6.0).<br>
The inhibitory values determined for the compounds according to the invention [inhibitory concentration as -log IC50 (mol/1)] follow from the following Table A, in which the numbers of the compounds correspond to the numbers of the examples. Table A Inhibition of PDE4 activity<br>
