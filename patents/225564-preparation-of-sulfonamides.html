The present invention relates to a process for preparing ethylene glycol sulfonamide derivatives.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
having a 1,2-diheteroethylene substituent {i.e., an ethylene group containing heteroatom substituents on 1- and 2-positions) on the pyrimidine ring moiety, such as Bosentan, have a wide variety of biological activities including inhibiting the renin angiotensin system and acting as an endothelin antagonist. These compounds are useful in treatment of a variety of illnesses including cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension, ischemia, vasospasms and angina pectoris.<br>
A current method of preparing ethylene glycol sulfonamide derivatives involves reacting an appropriately substituted pyrimidine monohalide with a monoanion ethylene glycol {e.g., sodium ethylene glycol) typically using ethylene glycol as a solvent. However, CS/19.01.2000<br><br>
one of the disadvantages of using a monoanion of ethylene glycol is the formation of undesired ethylene glycol bis-sulforamide in which two molecules of the pyrimidine monohalide are coupled with one molecule of ethylene glycol. The formation of this bis-sulfonamide compound requires costly and laborious separation steps to obtain a pharmaceutically suitable pure ethylene glycol sulfonamide compound. In addition, the use of ethylene glycol as a solvent, which is acceptable in a small scale reaction, is impracticable in a large industrial scale synthesis because of its toxicity and its high boiling point which requires a large amount of time and high energy consumption to remove it by distillation.<br>
Another drawback to the current synthesis is the need for isolating a pyrimidine dihalide (W=halide) of the formula:<br>
which is believed to be a potent sensitizer. This problem is further complicated by the use of a halogenated solvent, e.g., methylene chloride, during the isolation of pyrimidine dihalide. Halogenated solvent is expensive to dispose of properly, thus leading to an added cost.<br>
Furthermore, the current synthesis requires at least six separate isolation steps and the use of many different solvents, which makes it economically less attractive as an industrial process.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for a process for preparing the above described 1,2-diheteroethylene sulfonamides with a reduced number of reaction product isolation steps. There is a need for a process for preparing the 1,2-diheteroethylene sulfonamides which does not produce undesired 1,2-diheteroethylene bis-sulfonamides. There is a need for a process for preparing the 1,2-diheteroethylene sulfonamides which does not require isolation of potent sensitizers such as pyrimidine dihalide and/or pyrimidine monohalide intermediates.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a process for preparing a mono-protected 1,2-diheteroethylene substituted sulfon-amide of the formula:<br><br><br><br>
Ri        is hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkylthio, halogen or trifluoromethyl;<br>
R2        is hydrogen, halogen, lower alkoxy, trifluoromethylj<br>
R3        is hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkylthio, trifluoromethyl, cycloalkcyl, lower alkoxy or trifluoromethoxy; or<br>
R2 and R3 together can   butadienylene,  methjlenedioxy,<br>
ethylenedioxy or isopropylidenedioxyj<br>
R4        is hydrogen, lower alkyl, Gycloalkyl, trifluoromethyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkylthio, lower alkcylthio-lower alkyl, hydroxy-lower alkyl, hydroxy-lower alkoxy, lower alkoxy-lower alkyl, hydroxy-lower alkoxy-lower alkyl, hydroxy-lower alkoxy-lower alkoxy, lower alkylsulfinyl, lower alkylsulfonyl 2-methoxy-3-hydroxypropoxy, 2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropyl, amino-lower alkyl, lower alkylamino-lower alkyl, di-lower alkylamino-lower alkyl, amino, lower alkyl-amino, di-lower alkylamino, arylamino, aryl, arylthio, aryloxy, aryl-lower alkyl or heterocyclyl;<br>
R5        is a protecting group;<br>
R, R7, Rg and R9 are independently hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl,<br>
trifluoromethyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkylthio, hydroxy, hydroxymethyl,<br><br>
cyano, carboxyl, formyl, methylsulfinyl, methylsulfonyl, methylsulfonyloxy or lower alkcyloxy-carbonyloxy; or<br>
R7        together with R or Rs can be  butadienylene,  methylenedioxy, ethylenedioxy or isopropylidenedi-oxy;<br>
Z	is O, S, ethylene, vinylene, C(=0), OCHRio, or SCHRio;<br>
Rio       is hydrogen or lower alkcyl;<br>
X and Y are independently O, S, or NH;<br>
M        is hydrogen, an alkaline metal or an alkaline earth metal;<br>
Ml       is an alkaline metal or an alkaline earth metal; and<br>
W       is a halide.<br>
Preferably, the reaction is conducted in a nonpolar aprotic solvent. The present invention also provides a method for removing the protecting group, R5.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, X and Y are O and the protecting group, R5, is a tert-butyl group which is used to protect the hydroxy group of ethylene glycol as an ether. The tert-butyl group of an ether is then removed using a formic acid to produce a formyloxy-protected ethylene glycol sulfonamide derivative (R5 = CHO). Treatment of this compound with a base then produces an ethylene glycol sulfonamide derivative containing a free hydroxy group.<br><br>
This coupling reaction is preferably conducted in a nonpolar solvent and is facilitated by the presence of a base and a phase transfer catalyst which increases the rate of reaction. It should be appreciated that when a base is present, the actual compound which is contacted<br><br>
with the pyrimidine dihalide may be the anion of the sulfonamide. By using the same reaction solvent in this reaction as the subsequent reaction, a need for isolation and/or purification of pyrimidine monohalide is avoided. As used herein, the term "isolation" of a compound refers to concentrating or separating the reaction product or a resulting work¬up product such that the resulting composition, including any solvent that may be present, comprises at least about 80% of the compound, preferably at least about 90% of the compound, and more preferably at least about 95% of the compound. The term "purification" refers to a process for separating the desired compound from undesired compounds. A purity of a compound refers to the amount of the desired compound present in the mixture, not including any solvent which may also be present. Thus, a 90% pure compound dissolved in a large volume of solvent may still be considered to be 90% pure, but it may not be considered to be "isolated" since there is a large amount of solvent stiill present.<br>
Isolation and/or purification of each product in the reaction is avoided by using a nonpolar solvent as the reaction solvent. Preferably the nonpolar solvent is an aprotic solvent, such as an ether and a hydrocarbon, more preferably the nonpolar solvent is selected from the group consisting of toluene, tetrahydrofiiran and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, and most preferably the nonpolar solvent is toluene.<br><br>
with a dehydrohalogenating agent. The product, pyrimidine dihalide, is a potent sensitizer, and the process of the present invention allows using the pyrimidine dihalide in the subsequent process without the need for isolation.<br>
The present invention is particularly useful m the synthesis of an ethylene glycol sulfonamide derivative of the formula:<br><br><br>

The process of the present invention provides many advantages and improvements over the current processes of synthesizing the above defined 1,2-diheteroethylene sulfonamide compounds. The corresponding starting materials are either commercially available or can be obtained by the processes described in the European Patent Application EP 0 526 708.<br>
The term "lower", as used herein, denotes groups with 1-7 carbon atoms, preferably 1-4 carbon atoms. Alkyl, alkoxy and alkylthio groups as well as alkyl groups as components of alkanoyl groups can be straight-chain or branched. Methyl, ethyl, propyl.<br><br>
isopropyl, butyl, sec- and tert-butyl are examples of such alkyl groups. Halogen denotes fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, with chlorine being preferred. Cycloalkyl denotes residues with 3 to 8 carbon atoms, such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl, and the like. Examples of aryl residues are phenyl and substituted phenyl residues, with halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxycarboxyl and trifluoromethyl especially coming into consideration as substituents. Examples of heterocyclyl residues are unsubstituted or, preferably, substituted (for example, mono- or disubstituted with lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halogen, aryl, aryl-lower alkyl or mixtures thereof) mono- or bicyclic 5- and 6-membered heterocyclic residues with oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur as the hetero atom, such as, for example, 2- and 3-furyl, pyrimidinyl, 2-, 3- and 4-pyridyl and pyridyl N-oxide, 1,2- and 1,4-diazinyl, morphohno, 2- and 3-thienyl, isoxazolyl, oxazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrrolyl, benzofuranyl, benzothienyl, indolyl, purinyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, quinazolyl, and the like.<br>
With respect to compound I:<br>
Preferably, Z is O and, furthermore, Rg is lower alkoxy, especially methoxy, and R7, Rs and R9 are hydrogen.<br>
R5 is a protecting group. It will be recognized that the identity of the protecting group depends on the identity of the Y moiety. Thus, for example, when Y is NH then R5 is an amine protecting group, when Y is S then R5 is a thiol protecting group and when Y is O then R5 is a hydroxy protecting group. Suitable protecting groups for a given Y moiety are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art, and some of the representative suitable protecting groups are disclosed in "Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis," T.W. Greene, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, N.Y., 1981, which is incorporated herein in its entirety. Preferably, when X and Y are O, R5 is tert-hutyl.<br>
Ri and R2 are preferably hydrogen.<br>
R3 is preferably lower alkyl, more preferably t-hutyl.<br>
R4 is preferably 2-pyrimidinyl.<br>
X and Y are preferably oxygen.<br>
The process of the present invention includes contacting a pyrimidine monohalide ofthe formula II:<br><br><br>
with a mono-protected 1,2-diheteroethylene anion of the formula M1XCH2CH2YR5 to produce the mono-protected 1,2-diheteroethylene sulfonamide I. M is hydrogen or a metal, preferably hydrogen, an alkali metal or alkali-earth metal, and more preferably hydrogen or an alkali metal. Still more preferably M is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, sodium, lithium and potassium, and most preferably M is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, sodium, and potassium. Mi is a metal, preferably an alkaU metal or alkali-earth metal, more preferably an alkali metal. Still more preferably Mi is selected from the group consisting of lithium, potassium and sodium, and most preferably Ml is sodium. A preferred reaction temperature is from about 15 °C to about 100 °C, more preferably from about 30 °C to about 80 °C, and most preferably from about 50 °C to about 60 "C. A preferred reaction time is from about 1 to about 15 hours, more preferably from about 2 to about 10 hours, and most preferably from about 3 to about 7 hours. Preferably from about 1 equivalents (eq.) to about 10 eq. of mono-protected 1,2-diheteroethylene anion relative to the pyrimidine monohalide II is used in the reaction, more preferably from about 1 eq. to about 5 eq., and most preferably from about 1 eq. to about 1.2 eq.<br>
The mono-protected 1,2-diheteroethylene anion can be prepared prior to being added to the pyrimidine monohalide 11, or it can be generated in situ by contacting tfc e compound of the formula HXCH2CH2YR5 with a base. It will be appreciated that any base which can deprotonate HXCH2CH2YR5 can be used. Preferably the base is selected from the group consisting of hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide; hydrides such as sodium hydride, potassium hydride, Hthium hydride and calcium hydride; metals suc;h as sodium; carbonates such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, and lithium carbonate; alkoxides such as tert-butoxide, and isopropoxide; and bicarbonates such as Hthium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, and potassium bicarbonate; and mixtures thereof. More preferably the base is a hydroxide, still more preferably the base is selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide, and most preferably the base is sodium hydroxide.<br><br>
The preparation of mono-protected 1,2-diheteroethylene sulfonamide I can be carried out in the absence of substantially any solvent or it can be carried out in the presence of a reaction solvent. As used in this invention, "absence of substantially any solvent" means that the amount of solvent present is less than about 5% by volume (L) per kg of compound I (% vol/wt), preferably less than about 2% vol/wt, and more preferably less than about 1% vol/wt.<br>
When the reaction solvent is present, it is preferred that the reaction solvent is a nonpolar solvent. As used in this invention a "nonpolar solvent" refers to a solvent having a dielectric constant of less than about 20, preferably less than about 15, more preferably less than about 10, and most preferably less than about 5. As used in this invention, tlie dielectric constant, e, of a solvent refers to the value at 20 °C. The dielectric constant of a solvent can be found, for example, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 63 Ed., CRC Press, 1983, pp. E-51 to E-54, which is incorporated herein by reference. More preferable the reaction solvent is aprotic solvent, such as ethers and hydrocarbons. As used herein, an "aprotic solvent" refers to a solvent which is not a good hydrogen bond donor, i.e., solvents that do not contain heteroatom-hydrogen bond, e.g., O-H, or N-H bond. It should be appreciated, however, that while aprotic solvents are not good hydrogen bond donors, they may or may not be good hydrogen bond acceptors. StiU more preferably the reaction solvent is selected from the group consisting of toluene, tetrahydrofuran and 2-methyltetrahydrofliran, and most preferably the reaction solvent is toluene.<br>
The mono-protected 1,2-diheteroethylene sulfonamide I can be isolated from the reaction mixture by adding a sufficient amount of acid to the reaction mixture to neutralize any base that maybe present, removing the reaction solvent and crystallizing or precipitating it from a crystallization solvent. Preferably, a sufficient amount of acid Ls added to the reaction mixture resulting in the pH of the solution from pH of about 5 to pH of about 7, more preferably, from pH of about 5 to pH of about 6, and most preferably from pH of about 5 to pH of about 5.5. Any acid having sufficient pKa to generate the; desired pH can be used. Preferably the acid is selected from the group consisting of inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydriodic acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid and sulfuric acid, and more preferably the acid is hydrochloric acid. Preferably, tie crystallization solvent is a lower alkyl alcohol, and more preferably ethanol. Preferably the crystallization solvent is maintained at a temperature of from about -25 °C to about 50 °C to crystallize the reaction product, more preferably from about -10 °C to about 25 °C, and most preferably from about -5 °C and 10 °C.<br>
Unlike the process described in the Background section, one particular embodiraent of the present invention provides a process for preparing a mono-protected ethylene glycol sulfonamide derivative of compound I (where X and Y are O) using a mono-protecte<l></l><br>
ethylene glycol derivative which prevents formation of an undesired ethylene glycol bis-sulfonamide compound, e.g., where two molecules of compoimd II are coupled to one; molecule of ethylene glycol to form a molecule of a general structure Ar-OCH2CH20-Ar, wherein Ax is the portion of the compound 11 which has been coupled to ethylene glycol. Without being bound by any theory, it is believed that in the process described in the Background section, the hydroxy group of some of the initially formed ethylene glycol sulfonamide derivative reacts with unreacted sodium ethylene glycol (Na0CH2CH2OH) or other bases which may present in the reaction mixture to form an anion which then reacts with another molecule of pyrimidine mono-halide 11 to produce the undesired ethylene glycol bis-sulfonamide derivative. By using the mono-protected ethylene glycol derivative, the present invention eliminates any possibility of forming such an anion, thus completely eliminating production of the undesired ethylene glycol bis-sulfonamide derivative. This elimination of the production of undesired bis-sulfonamide ethylene glycol derivative results in higher overall product yield and easier product purification.<br>
Another shortcoming in the process described in the Background section is the use of ethylene glycol as a solvent which must be removed by distillation after the reaction. In a small scale reaction, using ethylene glycol as a solvent does not pose much difficulty. In a large industrial scale reaction, however, using ethylene glycol is impracticable because of its toxicity and its high boiling point which requires a large amount of time and energy for its removal. In contrast, the process of the present invention uses a nonpolar solvent as discussed above.<br>
The process for preparing the mono-protected 1,2-diheteroethylene sulfonamide I can further include a step of removing the protecting group, i.e., conversion of R5 to hydrogen. Removal of a variety of protecting groups is disclosed in the above mentioned "Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis."<br>
As an illustration, the process for removing a protecting group of mono-protected ethylene glycol sulfonamide I will be discussed with regard to removing a tert-hutyl ether protecting group of an alcohol {i.e., conversion of R5 from tert-butyl to hydrogen, where X and Y are O). Contacting the tert-huiyl ether protected ethylene glycol sulfonamide I {i.e., compound I wherein YR5 is a 0-tert-butyl moiety) with an acid removes the tert-butyl protecting group. Any acid having a sufficient acidic strength to remove ert-butyl ether group can be used. Exemplary acids include organic acids such as toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), methanesulfonic acid (MSA), formic acid, acetic acid and other carboxylic acids; inorganic acids such as sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydriodic acid and hydrochloric acid; and Lewis acids such as ZnCl2, AICI3, FeCls, TiCU, and MesSil. Such acids can be used individually or as a mixture. Preferably the acid is selected from the group consisting of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), methanesulfonic acid (MSA), formic<br><br>
acid, acetic add, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, FeClj, TiCU, and MejSil, and more preferably the acid is formic acid.<br>
When using a protic acid in the deprotection of an ether protecting group, it is preferred that an alcohol solvent is used in the deprotection reaction. As used in this invention, the term "protic acid" refers to a Bronsted-Lowry acid, i.e., any substance that is capable of giving up a hydrogen ion, or proton. Preferably, the alcohol solvent is selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, iso-propanol and.butanol, more preferably the alcohol solvent is selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol and iso-propanol, and most preferably the alcohol solvent is ethanol.<br>
With regards to tert-butyl ether protected ethylene glycol sulfonamide I, a useful reaction temperature for the deprotection of an ether is from about 10 °C to about 12fi °C, more preferably from about 25 °C to about 100 °C, and most preferably from about 80 °C to about 90 °C. The ratio of the protic acid to the tert-hutyl ether protected ethylene glycol sulfonamide I can be from about 1 Hter of the acid:l kilogram of the mono-protected compound (i.e., 1:1 (1/kg)) to about 10:1 (1/kg), preferably about 5:1 (1/kg), and most preferably about 2:1 (1/kg). Under these conditions, less than about 5% of residual tert-butyl ether protected ethylene glycol sulfonamide I remains after about 1 to 10 hours, and preferably less than about 1%. Preferably, the deprotection reaction results in less than about 1% of terf-butyl ether protected ethylene glycol sulfonamide I remaining.<br>
After the deprotection reaction, the reaction mixture is cooled and a nonpolar aprotic solvent, as discussed above, is added. A substantial amount of nonpolar solvent and the protic acid is then removed, for example, by azeotropic distillation under a reduced pressure.<br>

When formic acid is used for the deprotection of tert-butyl ether protected ethylene glycol sulfonamide I, the initial product can be a formyloxy-protected ethylene glycol sulfonamide I {i.e., compound I, wherein X and Y are O and R5 is CHO). The invention therefore also relates to a process wherein contacting a mono-protected 1,2-dihetero-ethylene sulfonamide with formic acid produces an intermediate mono-protected 1,2-diheteroethylene solfonamide of the formula:<br>

R3-/   V-SOjNH'	Rg<br>
R/N-X     Rr"R8<br><br>
The formyloxy-protected ethylene glycol sulfonamide I is typically isolated from the reaction mixture by the following process. The reaction mixture containing formyloxy-protected ethylene glycol sulfonamide I is cooled to from about 25 °C to about 100 °C, more preferably from about 35 °C to about 85 °C, and most preferably to from about 45 "C to about 55 "C. The resulting slurry is then diluted with an alcohol solvent, preferably ethanol, and heated to reflux. CooHng the resulting alcohol solvent mixture to from about -25 °C to about 25 °C, preferably from about -15 °C to about 15 °C, and more preferably from about -10 "C to about 0 C affords the desired formyloxy-protected ethylene glycol sulfonamide I. In some cases, a solvated formyloxy-protected ethylene glycol sulfonamide I is obtained by this process, i.e., a solid formyloxy-protected ethylene glycol sulfonamide I containing solvent molecules, e.g., ethanol. The term "solvated" means a solid compound which contains solvent molecules within the crystal lattice of the compound.<br>
Alternatively, the alcohol solvent mixture from above is cooled to from about 0 'C to about 50 °C, more preferably from about 15 °C to about-35 °C, and most preferably to about 25 °C. The solvent is removed by decantation from a crystallized slurry containing product. Although the product may be dried, typically the wet product is used directly in the subsequent process.<br>
The formyloxy group can then be removed by contacting the formyloxy-protected ethylene glycol sulfonamide with a base. Any base which can hydrolyze the formyloxy group can be used. Preferably the base is selected from the group consisting of hydro:ddes such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide; carbonates such as sodium carbonate, lithium carbonate, potassium carbonate and calcium carbonate; bicarbonates such as sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate and Hthium bicarbonate. More preferably the base is selected from the group consisting of hydroxide, and most preferably sodium hydroxide. The deprotection of the formyloxy group can be performed in the presence of a solvent. Preferably, the solvent is a protic solvent such as water, alcohol and a mixture thereof, more preferably the solvent is water, ethanol and a mixture thereof.<br>
For removal of the formyloxy group, typically the combined mixture is stirred at a temperature of from about 5 °C to about 65 °C, more preferably from about 15 °C to about 45 °C, and most preferably at about 25 °C. The reaction time can range from about 5 minutes to about 48 hours, more preferably from about 15 minutes to about 5 hours, and most preferably from about 30 minutes to about 90 minutes. After the removal of formyloxy group, the reaction mixture is acidified to adjust the pH of the reaction mixture to pH of from about 5 to pH of about 7, more preferably to pH of from about 5 to pH of about 6, and most preferably to pH of from about 5 to pH of about 5.5. Any acid which is sufficiently strong enough to adjust the pH range of the reaction mixture to a desired pH<br><br>
can be used. Preferably the acid is hydrochloric acid, more preferably the acid is 12 N HCI solution. After the addition of add, water is added and the suspension is stirred for from about 1 hour to about 10 hours, more preferably from about 2 hours to about 5 hours, and most preferably for about 3 hours. The solid product, ethylene glycol sulfonamide {i.e., compound I, wherein X and Y are O and R5 is hydrogen), is then filtered, washed with an alcohol-water mixture, preferably ethanol-water mixture, and dried using standard process to afford the desired ethylene glycol sulfonamide.<br>
The ethylene glycol sulfonamide can be further purified by refluxing the solution of the wet impure ethylene glycol sulfonamide in an alcohol, preferably ethanol, with the addition of water during the reflux. The resulting suspension is then cooled to a range from about 0 °C to about 50 "C, more preferably from about 15 °C to about 35 "C, most preferably from about 20 °C to about 30 °C. The mixture is cooled to a desired temperature over a period of from about 1 hour to about 24 hours, more preferably from about 2 hours to about 12 hours, and most preferably from about 5 hours to about 7 hours. The purified ethylene glycol sulfonamide is then isolated and dried. Using this process, ethylene glycol sulfonamide having a purity of greater than about 99.3% can be produced, more preferably greater than about 99.5%, and most preferably greater than about 99.8%.<br>
The process for preparing mono-protected 1,2-diheteroethylene sulfonamide I of the present invention can also include a process for preparing the pyrimidine monohaUde II by contacting a pyrimidine dihaHde III of the formula:<br><br>
This coupling reaction between the pyrimidine dihalide III and the sulfonamide IV can include the presence of a base. Without being bound by any theory, it is believed that the base deprotonates the sulfonamide and neutralizes any acid that is generated during the reaction. It is believed that in the absence of a base, the resulting acid that is generated in<br><br>
the coupling teaction can reduce the rate of subsequent coupHng reaction by protonatmg the sulfonamide IV thereby reducing its reactivity, or the add can cause degradation of the product and/or starting material resulting in a decrease in the overall yield. It should be appreciated that in the presence of a base, the reactive spedes may be the deprotonated sulfonamide (i.e., sulfonamide anion). Thus, vhile the sulfonamide is represented in its neutral form, in the presence of a base, the process of the present invention also encompasses the corresponding sulfonamide anion. Preferably, the base is selected from the group consisting of sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, lithium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, lithium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, Uthium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, more preferably the base is selected from the group consisting of potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, and most preferably the base is potassium carbonate. The amount of base used in this reaction is from about 1 eq. to about 2 eq., preferably from about I eq. to about 1.5 eq., more preferably from about 1 eq. to about 1.3 eq., and most preferably about 1.1 eq.<br>
This coupling reaction can be conducted in the same reaction solvent as the solvent used in the coupHng reaction between the pyrimidine monohalide II and the mono-protected 1,2-diheteroethylene compound. Moreover, the reaction mixture of the coupHng reaction between the pyrimidine dihalide III and the sulfonamide IV can be used directly in the next step without isolation or purification.<br>
The coupling reaction between the pyrimidine dihaUde III and the sulfonamide IV can also include the presence of a phase transfer catalyst. A "phase transfer catalyst" refers to a catalyst or agent which is added to a reaction mixture of components, to transfer one or more of the reacting components to a location where it can conveniently and rapidly react with another reacting component. Non-limiting examples of phase transfer catalysts or agents that may be employed are reviewed in "Phase-Transfer Catalysis," by CM. Starks et al.. Chapman &amp; Hall, New York, N.Y., 1994, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Preferably the phase transfer catalyst is selected from the group consisting of tetrabutylammonium bromide, tetrabutylphosphonium bromide, tetrabutylammonium chloride, tetrabutylphosphonium chloride, benzyltriethylammonium chloride, and tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, and more preferably tetrabutylammonium bromide. Preferably from about 0.5 mole% to about 10 mole% of phase transfer catalyst is added to the reaction mixture, more preferably from about 1 mole% to about 5 mole%, still more preferably from about 1.5 mole% to about 2.5 mole%, and most preferably about 2 mole%.<br>
Preferably the reaction time is from about 2 hours to about 15 hours, more preferably from about 5 hours to about 10 hours, and most preferably from about 5 hours<br><br>
to about 7 hours. The reaction can be conducted under a condition where any water that is present or formed in the reaction mixture is removed. For example, this can be achieved by using a reaction solvent which can remove water azeotropically using a Dean-Stark • apparatus. Preferably the reaction solvent is same as the solvent used in the coupling reaction between the pyrimidine monohalide 11 and the mono-protected 1,2-diheteroethylene compound. Use of the same reaction solvent allows the coupling reaction between the pyrimidine monohaUde II and the mono-protected 1,2-diheteroethylene compound to be conducted without isolating the product from the coupUng reaction between the pyrimidine dihahde III and the sulfonamide IV. This elimination of a need for isolation of a product reduces the production time and overall cost. Moreover, it eliminates isolation of sensitizer pyrimidine monohalide II, thus reducing the risk of exposure to a harmful chemical.<br>
The process for preparing mono-protected 1,2-diheteroethylene sulfonamide I of the present invention can also include a process for preparing a pyrimidine dihahde III by contacting pyrimidinedione V of the formula:<br><br>
with a dehydrohalogenating reagent. As used in this invention, a "dehydrohalogenating reagent" refers to any reagent which is capable of converting the pyrimidinedione V to pyrimidine dihahde III. Exemplary dehydrohalogenating reagents include phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorous pentachloride, phosphorous trichloride, phosphorus oxybromide, phosphorous pentabromide, phosphorous tribromide, oxalyl chloride, and mixtures thereof Preferably the dehydrohalogenating agent is selected from the group consisting of phosphorous oxychloride, phosphorous pentachloride, phosphorous trichloride, and mixtures thereof<br>
The conversion of pyrimidinedione V to pyrimidine dihahde III usmg a dehydrohalogenating agent is typically conducted at an elevated temperature. Preferably the reaction temperature is at least about 80 "C, more preferably at least about 85 °C, and most preferably at least about 90 °C. Although the reaction can be conducted in any solvent which is substantially inert to the reaction conditions, typically the reaction is conducted in the absence of a solvent. After a sufficient amount of the pyrimidine dihahde in is formed, the reaction mixture is diluted with a solvent which has a boiling point of at least 80 °C, preferably at least about 90 "C, and more preferably at least about 110 °C. Preferably the solvent is a nonpolar solvent, more preferably an aprotic nonpolar solvent,<br><br>
still more preferably toluene, and most preferably the same nonpolar solvent as that used in the subsequent process. By using the same nonpolar solvent as the subsequent process, the present invention avoids having to isolate and/or purify the pyrimidine dihalide in which is a known to be a potent sensitizer. The resulting reaction mixture is then quenched to destroy any remaining dehydrohalogenating agent. The quenching agent is any compound which reacts with the dehydrohalogenating agent without significantly reacting with pyrimidinedione V and/or pyrimidine dihalide m. Preferably the quenching agent is selected from an alcohol, water, and mixtures thereof. More preferably the quenching agent is water. The quenching agent can also contain a base to neutralize any acid that may be formed during the quenching step. Any base which can neutraHze the acid that is formed in the quenching step can be used. Preferably the base is a hydroxide, and more preferably sodium hydroxide.<br>
When a phosphorous compound is used as the dehydrohalogenating agent, phosphorous by-products are produced during the quenching step. The removal of these phosphorous by-products can be facilitated by adding a metal oxide. Preferably the metal oxide is selected from the group consisting of a transition metal oxide, alkah-earth metal oxide and alkali metal oxide, more preferably the metal oxide is selected from the group consisting of an alkahne-earth metal oxide, and most preferably the metal oxide is calcium oxide. The pyrimidine dihalide III can be isolated from the reaction mixture prior to the subsequent process; however, the pyrimidine dihalide III is believed to be a sensitizer. Therefore, it is preferred that the pyrimidine dihalide III be used in the subsequent process without first being isolated or purified.<br>
