				<td>The present invention relates to a material designed for high temperatures.<br>
The group of oxide-forming and corrosion-resistant high temperature materials used at<br>
temperatures higher than 1100°C in the constructions of i.e. heating elements and<br>
structural details in other high temperature applications includes, inter alia, Si02-forming<br>
material, such as silicon (SiC), molybdenum silicide (MoSi2), silicon nitride (Si3N4), and<br>
aluminum-oxide-forming material, such as FeCrAI, MeCrAlY and molybdenum aluminum<br>
silicide (Mo(Si1-xAlx)2). NiCr alloys also form protective layers which develop a passivating<br>
layer of chromium oxide (Cr203) on the surface.<br>
Aluminium oxide forming material according to the aforegoing are also more stable than<br>
Si02 and Cr203 builders in reducing environments such as in an hydrogen gas<br>
environment due to the fact that aluminium has a greater affinity to oxygen than chromium<br>
and silicon. These layers passivate the base material and thereby counteract their<br>
degradation at high temperatures in oxidising atmospheres and other atmospheres. The<br>
use of metallic high temperature alloys, such as FeCrAI, is limited due to deficient creep<br>
durability and deformation resistance at temperatures above 1300°C. Moreover, the<br>
limited amount of aluminium in the alloy shortens the length of life of the oxidation. Neither<br>
do NiCr alloys offer a useful alternative when the requirements are along oxidation life<br>
spans at temperatures above 1200-1300°.<br>
The present invention provides a material that has a long length of life in oxidizing<br>
atmospheres at temperatures above 1200°C.<br>
The present invention thus relates to a material for use at temperatures above 1200°C and<br>
in oxidizing atmospheres consisting generally of an alloy between a metal, aluminium (Al)<br>
and carbon (C) or nitrogen (N), and is characterized in that the alloy has a composition<br>
MzAlyXw, where M essentially consists of titanium (Ti), chromium (Cr) and/or niobium<br>
(Nb), and where X is carbon (C) or where X is nitrogen (N) and/or carbon (C) when M is<br>
titanium (Ti); and in that z lies in the range of 1.8 to 2.2, y lies in the range of 0.8-1.2 and<br>
w lies in the range 0.8-1.2, and wherein a protective oxide layer A1203 is formed after<br>
heating to the mentioned temperature.<br>
Swedish Patent Application No. 0102214-4 describes a method of producing a single phase<br>
composition Mn+lAzXn, where n lies in the range of 0.8-3.2 and where z lies in the range<br>
of 0.8-1.2, where M may be titanium (Ti), where X may be carbon (C) or nitrogen (N), and<br>
where A may be aluminium (Al). The method involves forming a powder mix of said<br>
metal, non-metal and the last mentioned elements or compounds of said elements, and<br>
igniting the powder mix under an inert atmosphere so as not to promote disassociation,<br>
wherewith the ingoing components react, and wherein the method is characterised by<br>
causing the reaction temperature to stay at or above the temperature at which said<br>
components are caused to react but beneath the temperature at which the single phase<br>
composition will disassociate.<br>
The present invention is based on the surprising discovery that in a ternary phase diagram<br>
Ti-Al-C, the material Ti2AlC and a material that has a composition which is in the vicinity<br>
of the composition of Ti2AlC has surprisingly good properties, these properties not being<br>
shown outside the narrow intervals set forth in Claim 1. The same applies to Ti2AlN.<br>
The same also applies when the metal Ti is replaced with chromium (Cr) and/or niobium<br>
(Ni), either totally or partially.<br>
According to the present invention, X may also be nitrogen (N) and/or carbon (C),<br>
provided that M is then titanium (Ti).<br>
One advantage afforded by the present invention is that it makes possible applications at<br>
high temperatures in oxidising atmospheres in which metal alloys are unable to survive<br>
acceptable operating times at temperatures above 1200°C and where the mechanical<br>
properties of intermetals, such as molybdenum alumino-silicides constitute a limitation, for<br>
instance result in limited resistance to thermal shocks.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, the metal (M) can be replaced<br>
partially with one of the elements or substances tantalum (Ta) and vanadium (V) as<br>
alloying substances in said alloy.<br>
However, a particularly beneficial alloy in this context is an alloy that has the composition<br>
Ti2AlyCw, where z lies in the range of 1.8 to 2.2, y lies in the range of 0.8-1.2 and w lies in<br>
the range 0.8-1.2, and wherein z, y and w are chosen so that the material will form a<br>
protective oxide layer of Al2O3 when heated.<br>
In a preferred modification of said alloy, z = 2.0, y lies in the range of 1.0-1.2 and w is 1.0.<br>
The ternary carbide Ti3SiC2 has similar mechanical properties to the inventive material,<br>
although with the decisive drawback that titanium silicon carbide forms a rapidly growing<br>
non-passivating mix oxide of TiO2 and SiO2, which, in practice, makes it impossible to use<br>
the material in an oxidising environment for long periods of time at temperatures above<br>
1100°C in the absence of degradation of the material.<br>
It should also be emphasised that when the inventive material is used under conditions with<br>
a sufficiently low partial pressure of oxygen to prevent the formation of aluminium oxide<br>
on the surface of the material, the material will remain intact in accordance with the<br>
formula TizAlyXw.<br>
The ternary phase Ti3AlC2 and nearby compositions will also form aluminium oxide on<br>
said surface under certain circumstances and can thus be used as a secondary phase in the<br>
material.<br>
The inventive material may also include AI2O3, TiC and/or titanium alumnides.<br>
Titanium carbide and titanium alumnides may be present in the material without negatively<br>
affecting the oxidation properties of composites of the inventive material.<br>
Al2O3 can also be added as an amplifying phase in a composite of said material.<br>
There now follows a working example.<br>
1.   4000 g Ti, 1240 Al and 501 g C (correspc  to the composition Ti2Al1.1C)were<br>
mixed in powder form in a ball mill for a period of 4 hours.<br>
2.    The powder mix was placed in a tube-like furnace of aluminium oxide containing<br>
hydrogen gas.<br>
3.    The powder was heat-treated in accordance with the following cycles:<br>
•     3 °C/min. to a temperature of 400°C. <br>
•    The powder was held at a temperature of 400°C for a period of 4 hours.<br>
•    2 °C/min. to a temperature of 800°C.  <br>
•     The powder was held at the temperature of 800°C for a period of 4 hours.<br>
•    2 °C/min. To a temperature of 1400°C.<br>
•    The powder was held at a temperature of 1400°C for 4 hours.<br>
4.    Natural cooling.<br>
5.    The reacted powder was crushed and ground to 325 mesh.<br>
6.   An XRD analysis of the powder showed that the main phase was Ti2AlC with the<br>
presence of some Ti3 A1C2 and Al3Ti.<br>
7.    A mixture of Ti, Al, C (according to the conditions in step 1) and 20 percent by weight<br>
of the reactive powder (step 5) were packaged and placed in a water-cooled steel<br>
container. The container was evacuated and filled with pure argon gas.<br>
8.   The powder was ignited by electric heating. This process is known as SHS (Self<br>
propagating High temperature Synthesis).<br>
9.    The reacted material was cooled down naturally.<br>
10. The reactive material was ground down to 325 mesh.<br>
11. An XRD analysis of the powder showed that the main phase was Ti2AlC with the<br>
presence of some Ti3AlC2, TiC and Al3Ti (less than 10%).<br>
12. The powder was cooled, cold pressed and sintered with nitrogen gas at 1500°C for 1<br>
hour.<br>
13.  Optical microscopy and an SEM (Sweep Electron Microscope) analysis of the sintered<br>
material showed that the sample was dense with a porosity smaller than 2%. Some<br>
grains of Ti3AlC2 were observed with less than 5% TiAl3 at the grain boundaries. The<br>
grain size was in the order of 30 urn, with some grains in the order of 200 \im.<br>
14.  The sample was placed in an equipment for studying its oxidation properties. The<br>
sample was held at a temperature of 1100°C for 8 hours, 1200°C for 8 hours and<br>
1300°C for 8 hours. The oxidation course was found to be almost parabolic. The<br>
oxidation surface was bleach white, which indicates a thin oxide layer.<br>
15. An SEM analysis showed that the oxide layer had a thickness of 5 microns and<br>
consisted of dense and adhering Al2O3.<br>
16.  Part of a sintered rod was polished down to 1000 grit.<br>
17. This sample was plased playing its cyclic behaviour. The sample<br>
was held at 1200°C for 4 hours and allowed to cool naturally. The cycle was repeated<br>
ten times.<br>
18. The oxidation surface was bleach white, which indicates a thin oxide layer.<br>
19. An SEM analysis showed that the oxide layer had a thickness of 3 um and consisted of<br>
a dense and adhesive Al2O3.<br>
20. A sintered rod was polished down to 1000 grit.<br>
21. The sample was placed in an air-containing box furnace/?/ at 1200°C for 980 hours.<br>
22. The oxidation surface was bleach white, which indicates a thin oxide layer.<br>
23. The sample increased 10 mg in weight and had a white surface layer of AI2O3.<br>
Another preferred application of the inventive material pertains to gas-heated or volatile<br>
fuel heated infrared heat radiators where the material functions as a radiation emitting<br>
surface. IR radiators of this kind are used, inter alia, in the paper industry for drying,<br>
moisture profiling and surface coating paper and similar materials. Such radiation emitting<br>
surfaces are conveniently in the form of plates. The plates may be constructed as plates that<br>
include through-passing holes, for instance with the hole pattern in the form of a<br>
honeycomb structure. Alternatively, the surface may, for instance, be constructed of a<br>
number of parallel thin-walled plates. The inventive material contributes towards a robust<br>
heat-radiating plate, due to its unique combination of good properties: these being a slow<br>
oxidation rate up to a temperature of 1400°C, good thermal conductivity, simplified<br>
workability in comparison with other ceramics (leading to lower manufacturing costs), the<br>
splendid-ability to resist thermal shock, which places no restrictions on design with sharp<br>
edges and varying material thicknesses.<br>
The inventive material is electrically conductive with a resistivity of about 0.5 Qmm2/m at<br>
room temperature and about 2.5 Qmm2/m at 1200°C. In combination with the good<br>
mechanical properties of the material and its remaining high temperature properties, the<br>
material can be used advantageously as an electrical resistance element in both an<br>
oxidising and reducing atmosphere and under vacuum conditions. Other applications<br>
where the advantages afforded by the inventive material can be availed upon include for<br>
instance gas igniters, flame detectors, heater plugs and such usages. The use of the material<br>
in furnaces is not restricted to the example given above. In addition to such usages, the<br>
material may comprise parts or the whole of the following devices: trays, substrate holders,<br>
internal fittings/?/, support rollers, and so on.<br>
The inventive material may also be used conveniently in powder form for surface coating<br>
purposes, e.g. with the aid of thermal spray methods, such as HVOF, plasma spraying or<br>
the like. Surface coating using vapour phase deposition processes with so-called PVD<br>
(Physical Vapour Deposition) and CVD (Chemical Vapour Deposition) are also<br>
possibilities of producing layers that are resistant to high temperature corrosion. When in<br>
the form of a circuit pattern designed for suitable electrical resistance, such surface<br>
coatings can also function as flat heating elements for heat treating silicon wafers or plates.<br>
In addition to the aforesaid areas of use, the inventive material can also be used in respect<br>
of ethylene production tubes, heat exchangers, burner nozzles, gas turbine components,<br>
and so on.<br>
Although the invention has been described above with reference to different applications, it<br>
will be evident to the person skilled in this art that the inventive material can be used in<br>
other applications where the properties of the material are beneficial.<br>
It will therefore be understood that the invention is not restricted to the aforedescribed<br>
exemplifying embodiment thereof but that variations and modifications can be made<br>
within the scope of the following Claims.<br>
