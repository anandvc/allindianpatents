				<td>The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing high-toughness oil-tempered wire<br>
The present invention relates to an  oil- tempered wire, and more specifically an oil-tempered wire having sufficient toughness as a material for high-strength springs used valve springs for automotive engines.<br>
Valve springs for automtive engines are used in extremely harsh conditions 18 which they are   subjected to high stress and high resp;ved    speed  In particular, value. serines used in recent car e;tes,   which   are small in size and consume less fuel, are used in still severer environments.  It is therefor desirable to increase the strength of material for such valuve springs still further. valve   springs are formed from an oil-tempered wire of chrome-vanadium steel for valve springs or an oil-tempered wire of silicon-chx-ome steel for valve springs.  Efforts are being made to increase the strength of these wire materials .<br>
But a wire having increased strength tends to be low in toughness and ductility, so that it is liable to be broken while being formed into springs.<br>
In order to solve this problt-m. Examined Japanese Publication 3-6981 proposes to control the content of<br>
vanadium and the quenching conditions so that the crystal grain size will be 10 or more, thereby keeping high toughness of the wire.  For the same purpose, Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication 3-162550 proposes an oil-tempered wire having a tempered martensite, that is, a matrix after tempering, in which is present a residual austenite phase by 5-20%.<br>
But in the former, it is impossible to markedly increase the strength and toughness if the crystal grain size is 10 or more.  In the latter, if the residual austenite phase is present in a large amount, it may transform into a martensite phase while the wire is used as springs.  If this happens, it may suffer a permanent set due to increased volume.  That is, such a wire is less resistant to permanent setting.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an oil-tempered wire for springs which is less likely to suffer a permanent set and high in strength and toughness.<br>
As a result of our efforts, we have discovered that it is possible to increase toughness while keeping high resistance to permanent setting by finely dispersing a residual austenite phase in a tempered martensite at a volume rate of 1% to 5% and by controlling the density of unresolved carbides having particle diameters of 0.05µm or more to 5 pieces per wm  or less as observed on a structure<br>
observation photograph,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this inventior., Therte is provided a high-toughness oi1-tempered wire for  springs made of a steel containing in weight percer  C.5-0.81; C, 1.2-2.5°, Si, ( .4-0.8°, Mn, 0.7-1.0% Cr, 0.005", or less Al and 0.0051 or less Ti, the steel containing, after quenching and tempering, 1°0 to 5%   by volume of x-. invidul <br>
The steel may further contain 0.05-0.15% by weight of vanadiud mm, or further at least one of 0.05-0.5% by weight of Mo, 0.05-0.5% by weight of W and 0 . O5-0 . 15% by weight of<br>
!;<br>
In   another   arangement,    the  assembly   of   unresolved combodies   having   particle   diameter.    not   less   than   0.05 µm   is   gleaces   per µm     or   less   as   observed   on   a   structure observation   photo ,    instead   of   resiting  the   content   of residual<br>
In   still   another  arrangement,   both   the  density   of carbides   and   the  content  of   residual   /"are   restricted.<br>
The   present   invention   also   provides   a  method   of nanufacturing   oil-tempered  wires   as   described  above  under specific   quenching   and   tempering   conditions.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a method of manufacturing high-toughness oil-tempered wire wherein tempering in a quenching/tempering step is carried out at a heatmg rate of 150 °C/sec or more at a temperature of 450 °C to 600°C for 15 seconds or less from the start of heating to the start of a cooling step using a coolant such as water.<br>
Now  we   will   explain   wh y  the   steel   composition   has<br>
been   restricted.<br>
1)	C: 0.5-0.8 wt.%<br>
C is essential to increase the strength of the steel wire.  If its content is less than 0.5%, the strength of the wire will be insufficient.  On the other hand, a steel wire containing more than 0.8% carbon is low in toughness. Such a wire is not reliable enough because it is more liable to get marred.<br>
2)	Si: 1.2-2.5 wt.%<br>
Si helps increase the strength of ferrite and thus improve the resistance to permanent set.  If its content is less than 1.2%, this effect cannot be achieved sufficiently.  If over 2.5%, hot and cold machinability will drop.  Also, such a largt; amount will promote decarbonization during heat treatment,<br>
3)	Mn: 0.4-0.8 wt.%<br>
Mn improves the hardening properties of the steel and prevents any harmful effect caused by suffer in the steel by fixing it.  If its content is less than 0.4%, this effect cannot be achieved sufficiently.  If over 0.8%, the toughness will drop.<br>
4)	Cr: 0.7-1.0 wt.%<br>
Like Mn, Cr improves the hardening properties of the steel.  It also serves to increase the toughness of the wire by patenting after hot rolling and to increase the<br>
resistance to softening during tempering after quenching and thus the strength of the wire.  If its content is less than 0.7%, this effect cannot be achieved sufficiently.  If over 1.0%, Cr will hinder carbides from turning into solid solution, thus lowering the strength of the wire.  Also, such a large amount will cause excessive tempering action, leading to reduced toughness.<br>
5)	V: 0.05-0.15 wt.%<br>
Vanadium helps the formation of carbides during tempering, thus increasing the resistance to softening of the wire.  If its content is less than 0.05%, this effect will be insufficient.  If over 0.15%, a large amount of carbides will be formed during heating for quenching, which will lower the toughness of the wire.<br>
6)	Mo: 0.05-0.15 wt.%<br>
Mo helps the formation of carbides during tempering, thus increasing the resistance to softening of the wire. If its content is less than 0.05%, this effect will be insufficient.  If over 0.5%, wire drawing will become difficult.<br>
7)	W: 0.05-0.15 wt.%<br>
Tungsten helps the formation of carbides during tempering, thus increasing the resistance to softening of the wire.  If its content is less than 0.05%, this effect will be insufficient.  If over 0.15%, too large an amount<br>
of carbides will be formed during heating for quenching so that the toughness of the wire will drop.<br>
8)	Mb: 0.05-0.15 wt.%<br>
Nb helps the formation of carbides during tempering, thus increasing the resistance to softening of the wire. If its content is less than 0.05%, this effect will be insufficient.  If over 0.15%, too large an amount of carbides will be formed during heating for quenching, so that the toughness of the wire will drop.<br>
9)	Al, Ti: 0.005 wt.% or less<br>
They form AL2O3 and TiO which are high-melting point, non-metallic inclusions.  These inclusions are hard and can markedly lower the fatigue strength if present near the steel wire surface.  Thus, though they are unavoidable impurities, their contents have to be 0.005 wt.% or less. For this purpose, a raw material containing lesser impurities should be selected.<br>
10)	Reason why the content of residual   is restricted to<br>
1-5% by volume<br>
A residual  phase present in the tempered martensite improves the toughness of the steel wire.  If its content is less than 1%, the effect will be insufficient.  But if its content is more than 5%, the resistance to permanent set will decrease due to marten.sitic transformation while the wire is used a spring.<br>
11)  Reason why the number of unresolved carbides (0.05 µm or more in particle diameter) is restricted to 5 pieces per µm     as observed on a structure observation photo.<br>
Unresolved carbides having particle diameters of 0.05 µm or more can be starting points of destruction while<br>
forming springs.  Thus, if the number of such carbides<br>
exceeds 5 pieces per µm2     as observed on a structure<br>
observation photo, the toughness of the wire will drop markedly.<br>
The content of residual  and the density of carbides can be adjusted to the abovomentioned values by subjecting the wire to the following heat treatment.<br>
The heating time for quenching in the quenching/tempering step before the cooling step is started, should be within 15 seconds.  Otherwise, crystal grains will grow too large, lowering the toughness of the wire.  If the heating rate IS   150°C/sec or lower, it is impossible to resolve carbides sufficiently within the 15-second interval before the cooling step begins.  If the heating temperature is 1100 °C or higher, crystal grains will grow too large, thus lowering the toughness or causing decarbonization.  If T E °C) is equal to 500 + 750*C + 500-V or less (wherein C is the content of carbon in weight % and V is the content of vanadium in weight %), carbides will not be resolved sufficiently.<br>
Tempering during the quenching/tempering step has to be finished within 15 seconds before the cooling step is started, while keeping the heating rate at 150 sC/sec or higher.  Otherwise, the residual austenite phase will decrease to less than 1% by volume.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXAMPLES<br>
4.O-mm-diameter wires were formed by melting, rolling, heat-treating and drawing specimens having the chemical compositions shown in Table 1.  After quenching and tempering these wires under predetermined conditions, the amount of residual   phase was measured using X-rays, and the amount of carbides was measured by observing the wire structure.  Also, they were subjected to a tensile test to measure the toughness in terms of reduction of area.<br>
(Example 1)<br>
After quenching and tempering Specimens A-I under the conditions shown in Table 2, measurement of residual  and a tensile test were carried out.  The results for Specimens A, B, C and I are shown in Table 3.<br>
The amounts of residual  in the specimens manufactured by the method of the present invention were<br>
1-5 vol.%.  It is thus apparent that their toughness is sufficiently high.<br>
(Example 2)<br>
After quenching and tempering Specimens A-I under the conditions shown in Table 4, the amount of carbides (0.05 urn or more) in each specimen was measured, and then the specimens were subjected to a tensile test.  The results for Specimens A, Br D and H are shown in Table 5.<br>
From Table 5 , it is apparent that the specimens according to Example 2, having 5 or less carbides per square micrometer, are sufficiently tough.<br>
As described above, the oil-tempered wire for springs according to the present invention is highly resistant to permanent set and highly strong and tough.<br>
