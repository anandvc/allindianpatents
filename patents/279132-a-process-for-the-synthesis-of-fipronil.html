A PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF FIPRONIL<br>
GHARDA HORMUSJI KEKI<br>
an Indian National, of Gharda House, 48 Hill Road, Bandra (West), Mumbai 400 050, Maharashtra, India<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THE<br>
INVENTION.<br>
 <br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for preparing trifluoromethylsulfinyl pyrazole<br>
derivatives.<br>
Particularly, the present invention envisages a process for preparing 5-Amino-l-<br>
(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-3-cyano-4-trifluoromethyl	sulfinyl<br>
pyrazole also known as Fipronil.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
5-Amino-l-(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-3-cyano-4-trifluoromethyl sulfinyl   pyrazole    or   5-Amino-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4-[-(l(R,S)-trifluoromethyl)sulfinyl]-lH-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile   also    known   as Fipronil is a novel pesticide characterized by high efficiency, low toxicity and especially low residue.<br>
There are various routes to synthesize Fipronil by oxidation of thiopyrazole with various other oxidizing agents in suitable solvents. Oxidation of sulfides is a very useful route for the preparation of sulfoxides. Literature is replete with the conversion of sulfides to sulfoxides and/or sulfones. However, most of the existing methods use expensive, toxic or rare oxidizing reagents, which are difficult to prepare, are very expensive and cannot be used on commercial scale. Many of these processes suffer from poor selectivity.<br>
WOO 1/30760 describes oxidation of 5-amino-l-(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-3-cyano-4-trifluoromethylthio-pyrazole with trifluoro-acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of boric acid. The quantity of trifluoroacetic acid used is 14.5 molar equivalents. The patent also discloses the preparation   of 5-amino-l-(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethyl   phenyl)-3-cyano-4-<br>
 <br>
trifluoromethylthio-pyrazole from 5-amino-l-(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethyl phenyl)-3-cyano pyrazole-4-yl disulphide.<br>
European Patent publication No.295117 describes the preparation of 5-amino-l-<br>
(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-3-cyano-4-trifluoromethylsulphinyl<br>
pyrazole      starting   from   2,6-Dichloro-4-trifluoromethylaniline   to   give   an<br>
intermediate	5-amino-l-(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-3-cyano-4-<br>
trifluoromethylthiopyrazole which is oxidized with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid in chloroform to give desired product.<br>
Oxidizing agents such as perbenzoic acids do not provide effective and regioselective oxidation of electron deficient sulfides such as trifluoromethylsulphides which are less readily oxidized than other sulfides. Trifluoroacetic acid and trichloroacetic acid are found to be very efficient and regioselective oxidation medium for oxidation of 5-amino-l-(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-3-cyano-4-trifluoromethylthio-pyrazole in presence of hydrogen peroxide. Trichloroacetic acid can not be used alone due to higher melting point. Trifluoroacetic acid on the other hand is very regioselective with respect to conversion and low by-products formation. However, it is expensive, water miscible, corrosive to metal as well as glass, comparatively lower boiling and it's recovery (in anhydrous form) is complex in nature.<br>
WO00/35851/2000 describes about synthesis of 2,6-Dichloro-4-trifluoromethylaniline starting from 3,4,5-trichloro-benzotrifluoride in the presence of alkaline fluorides like lithium fluoride and ammonia in the presence of N-methylpyrrolidone at 250°C to give 97% conversion and 87% selectivity. The main drawback of the above process is the synthesis of 3,4,5-trichlorobenzotrifluoride in high yield and purity. Chlorination of p-chlorobenzotrifluoride gives a mixture of 3,4,5-trichlorobenzotrifluoride in 72%<br>
 <br>
GLC conversions, 3,4-dichloro and tetrachlorobenzotrifluoride. The process to get pure 3,4,5-isomer from this mixture by fractionation followed by crystallization is very tedious. Moreover in-spite of using very pure intermediates, substantial amount of an undesired isomer (3-amino-4,5-dichlorobenzotrifluoride) is also obtained.<br>
Another approach to generate 3,4,5-trichlorobenzotrifiuoride with high yield and purity is to perform denitrochlorination of 4-chloro-3,5-dinitrobenzotrifluoride in the presence of a catalyst as described in GB Patent 2154581 A. Even though the process produces 3,4,5-trichlorobenzotrifluoide in high yield and purity, the reaction conditions are too drastic to be employed for an industrial process.<br>
The known commercial processes for the manufacture of Fipronil uses corrosive and expensive chemical such as trifluoroacetic acid, hydrogen peroxide and m-chloroperbenzoic acid. Trifluoroacetic acid is expensive and generally not used in large quantities, as well as of m-chloroperbenzoic acid is difficult to handle at commercial scale due to its un-stability and detonating effect. Also the raw material used such as 2,6-Dichloro-4-trifluoromethylaniline are not easily available or made. The overall process for the Fipronil as disclosed above is found to be unsatisfactory in one respect or the other.<br>
Thus, there is felt a need for preparing Fipronil from easily available raw materials in a simple and economical manner at an industrial level, with high yields and purity.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a convenient and economically feasible process for preparing trifluoromethylsulfinyl pyrazole compound.<br>
 <br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing Fipronil using easily and commercially available raw materials.<br>
Yet, another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing Fipronil in high yield and high purity.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
Scheme I<br>
In accordance with the present invention polyhalogenated perhaloalkyl benzene compound of formula III is manufactured in high yields and purity by chlorination of aromatic compound of formula II . In preferred embodiment of the present invention compound II is p-chlorobenzotrifluoride.<br>
Ammonolysis of polyhalogenated perhaloalkyl benzene compound of formula III to obtain halo-perhaloalkylaniline compound of formula IV is easier and facile as compared to that of p-chlorobenzotrifluoride (compound II) and much higher conversions as compared to that of p-chlorobenzotrifluoride.<br>
Polyhalogenated perhaloalkyl benzene compound of formula III is ammonolyzed with anhydrous ammonia in the presence of a solvent. Ammonolysis is conducted in the presence of alkali halides under pressure at 20<br>
 <br>
to 50 kg/cm2 and in a temperature range of about 200°C to about 300°C. Catalytic amounts of copper compound may be used during ammonolysis. The alkali halide is preferably potassium fluoride. Anhydrous ammonia is used in excess of 2-6 m/m to start with. As the reaction proceeds, more ammonia is fed to maintain the reactor pressure and to minimize side reactions, which predominate at higher temperature due to lowering of ammonia concentrations.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the solvent employed in the present process can be any solvent or a mixture of solvent, which do not decompose under the reaction conditions and is inert with respect to the reactants. Preferably the solvent used is a polar solvent. The polar solvent is selected from a group consisting of N-methyl pyrrolidine, N,N'-dimethylimidazolidinone, diphenyl sulfone and dimethylsulfone. N-methylpyrrolidone is the solvent of choice as it does not interact with the reactants and at the same time it solubilises potassium fluoride.<br>
Halo-perhaloalkylaniniline compound is further halogenated to polyhalogenated perhaloalkyl aniline compound of formula V, halogenation is is carried out using atleast one of the halogenating agents selected from the group consisting of chlorine, thionyl chloride, sulfuryl chloride and PC15 at temperatures ranging between 0°C to 100°C, preferably 0°C to 70°C. The preferred halogenating agent is sulfuryl chloride. Among various halogens, the preferred halogen is chlorine unless a specific halogen is desired. The amount of halogenating agent used is limited to 10 to 50% excess, relative to the stoichiometric amount, preferably about 10-20% excess of the stoichiometric amount. Preferably, halogenation is done in chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents. The preferred solvents are chloroform, dichloroethane, dichloromethane, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene.<br>
 <br>
In preferred embodiment of the present invention, the compound of formula V is 2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylaniline. It is further purified by fractional distillation of the product post halogenation. Distilled product can be crystallized from a suitable solvent to achieve the desired quality.<br>
2,6-Dichloro-4-trifluoromethylaniline is diazotized with nitrosyl sulfuric acid in acid solvent and then treated with ethyl cyanopropionate compound and ammonia at a temperature ranging from 0 to 25°C to give pyrazole derivative of formula VII, the pyrazole compound is further extracted from the reaction mixture by using halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon. The solvent is then removed to isolate crude pyrazole.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, cyanoalkyl propionate derivative is ethyl-2,3 -dicyanopropionate.<br>
Crude pyrazole of formula VII is sulfenylated with a sulfenylating agent to give thiopyrazole compound of formula IX, the reaction is carried out in halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent. Thiopyrazole compound is further isolated by the distillation of the solvent.<br>
In preferred embodiment of the present invention the sulfenylating agent is trifluoromethyl sulfenyl chloride.<br>
Thiopyrazole compound of formula IX is then oxidized to trifloromethyl sulfinylpyrazole compound of formula I, the oxidation is carried out in medium containing a solvent and a oxidizing agent. The oxidizing agent is selected from a group consisting of hydrogen peroxide, tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide, benzoyl peroxide and sodium peroxide. Most preferred oxidizing agent is hydrogen peroxide. The oxidation is carried out in the presence of corrosion inhibitor such<br>
 <br>
as boric acid. The amount of hydrogen peroxide used is about 0.5 moles to about 1.2 moles per mole of the compound of formula IX.<br>
The solvent used for oxidation is a mixture of at least two solvents selected from a group consisting of trichloroacetic acid, monobromoacetic acid, dibromoacetic acid, tribromoacetic acid, chlorobenzene, dichloromethane and dichloroethane.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention the solvent system in oxidation step (1) is a mixture of trichloroacetic acid and chlorobenzene in a ratio of 80: 20% w/w.<br>
In accordance with one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention the solvent system comprises monobromoacetic acid, dibromoacetic acid or tribromoacetic acid and chlorobenzene in various ratios.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention the solvent system in step (i) is a mixture of trichloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid and chlorobenzene in a ratio of 70:30 to 80:20% w/w.<br>
Typically, trichloroacetic acid is used in the amount of 5 to 14 molar equivalents.<br>
The quantity of peroxide used depends on required optimal conversion with minimum by-product formation such as sulfone derivative.<br>
In preferred embodiment of the present invention compound of formula IX is 5-Amino-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4-[-(-trifluoromethyl) sulfenyl]-1 H-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile.<br>

In preferred embodiment of the present invention compound of formula I is (5-Amino-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4-(-1(R,S) trifluoromethyl)sulfmyl]-1 H-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile).<br>
Crude Fipronil (5-Amino-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4-[-(l(R,S)-trifluoromethyl)sulfinyl]-lH-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile), formula I thus formed is isolated by removing the solvent.<br>
Crude Fipronil is further purified by crystallization using at least one solvent selected from a group consisting of esters of aliphatic acids and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, mainly ethylacetate and chlorobenzene. The solvent mixture is used depending upon the associated impurities present in fipronil. Crystallized fipronil is further subjected to leaching using a solvent and/or a mixture of solvents selected from chlorobenzene and ethyl acetate.. The fipronil thus obtained after crystallization and leaching has the purity of above 98%.<br>

period of 2 hours to get reactor pressure of 30-32 kg/cm2. Excess NH3 was fed from the pressure pot to maintain the reactor pressure at 38-40 kg/cm2 at 245-250°C liquid temperature. Reaction mixture was maintained at 245-250°C and at 38-40 kg/cm pressure for further 8 hours. Reaction mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and NH3 was vented and recovered.
