curing;<br>
(c)	preparing a third layer by FR batting of carbon fibre, kevlar fibre and FR rayon,<br>
(d)	making a fourth layer from FR cotton fabric.<br>
PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF FABRIC<br>
According to the present invention, the fire protective fabric for fire proximity suit comprises of following layers in the sequence as below:-<br>
Outermost layer	:	Heat reflective glass fabric<br>
Second layer	:	Moisture barrier<br>
Third layer	:	Thermal Barrier<br>
Fourth layer	:	Fire Retardant (FR) cotton<br>
(Innermost layer)<br>
The process for the preparation of each of the above layer is as follows -Preparation of outermost layer<br>
The outermost layer of the fabric i.e. heat reflective glass fabric is a multi-layered composite fabric consisting of five layers namely:  aluminium layer of 01 to 03 microns preferably 002 microns, PET film of 10 to 15 micron preferably 12 micron, aluminium layer of .01 to .03 microns preferably 0.02 micron, Fluoro-elastomeric based resin of 40 to 45 microns preferably 43 micron and support layer of E-glass fabric, which is a strong fire retardant glass fabric with thickness of 420 to 440 microns preferably 430 microns For preparation of this layer, Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film  having optical density of 2 on a scale of 0-10 is metallised under high vacuum condition of the order of 10"4 to 10"" torr The aluminium wire melts as it touches the electrically heated boats (two such boats are provided for metallisation on both sides of the polymeric film)  The high level of vacuum inside the metallisation plant provides un-obstructive movement ot aluminium vapours which get deposited on both sides the PET film. The high vacuum is also conducive to forming stronger bond between the film and the aluminium vapours .This aluminised PET film.is laminated with E-glass fabric by using a thermal resistant adhesive svstem based on fluoro-elastomeric resin This laminate is cured at temperature<br><br>
around 195Â°C for 10 minutes. The E-glass fabric is prepared by "using glass yarn of the type EC68 Tex240 TPM x 25 160 TPM on automatic shuttle loom. The resulting fabric of 500 GSM is then desized at 400Â°C by passing through a heating chamber for one to three minutes. The adhesive system based on fluoro-elastomeric resin, is prepared by mixing of elastomeric resin (viton A 35) and methyl ethyl ketone in stiochiometric ratio (91 parts by weight) while adding magnesium oxide (7.5 pans by weight) and â¢ hexamethylene diamine carbamate (1.5 parts by weight).<br>
Preparation of second laver<br>
The second layer i.e. 'Moisture barrier' layer consists of the neoprene coated glass composite and comprises preferably 150 GSM basic cloth 'Â£' glass fabric and 200 GSM neoprene coating. The neoprene coating further comprises of neoprene 63 to 67% preferably 65%, carbon black powder 14 to 16% preferably 15%. antimony trioxide 14 to 16% preferably 15% and methyl alcohol 04 to 06% preferably 05%. as solvent Neoprene coating is prepared by refluxing neoprene, carbon black, antimony trioxide and methyl alcohol on a steam bath for 02 hours with stirring. The resulting solution is filtered while hot and the clear solution is filtered under vacuum in order to get a semi-solid paste This paste is applied to glass fabric and the resulting product is then cured at 140-150CC in a superheated steam container.<br>
Preparation of third laver<br>
Third layer i.e. Thermal barrier layer is made up of FR batting of carbon 65 to 75%, preferably 70%, 04 to 06% preferably 05% of kevlar fibre and 20 to 30% preferably 25% of Fire Retardant (FR) rayon. For preparation of this layer, carbon fibre of uniform quality is taken in stiochiometric ratio and spread on the ground. Kevlar fibre and FR rayon is spread on the layer of carbon fibre and kept for about 24 hours. The resulting layers are cut vertically and fed into hopper bale breaker to form the lap In order to make the web. the lap is fed into the multi-cylinder carding engine. The prepared web is then taken to needle beds to prepare the non-woven fabric i.e. thermal barrier.<br>
Preparation of innermost layer<br>
The fourth layer, which is the innermost layer, is made of Fire Retardant (FR) cotton fabric to provide comfort to the fireman.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated with a working example which is intended to be a typical example to illustrate the working of the invention and is not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation on the scope of the present invention.<br>
