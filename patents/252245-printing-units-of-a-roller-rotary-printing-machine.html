Description<br>
Printing Units of a Roller Rotary Printing Machine<br>
The invention pertains to printing units of a roller rotary printing machine according to the introductory part of the claim 1, 2 or 3.<br>
From the document WO 95/24314 A1 we know of such a printing unit where four duplex printing mechanisms are arranged vertically above one another and are movable horizontally relative to one another in the region of their duplex print position. For this purpose the printing mechanisms of the same web side are supported in a common frame, whereby at least one of the frames can be moved horizontally.<br>
The document EP 12 64 686 Al presents a printing unit with duplex printing mechanisms arranged vertically above one another, whereby the printing cylinders are supported in a central frame part and both inking units are supported in the outer frame parts The outer frame parts can be moved horizontally relative to the central frame part in order to be able to introduce plate handling devices in the intermediate space, if required.<br>
From the document DE 22 34 089 C3 we know of an offset roller rotary printing machine, where a wall section having several printing mechanisms can be moved against a wall section having the corresponding impression cylinders. The printing cylinders as well as the allocated inking units are all together supported as units in this wall section and can be moved or removed.<br>
The document DE 43 27 278 C2 presents a printing unit with a construction of a side frame, against which transmission cylinders and stereo cylinders having a certain circumference format are supported in a rotate-able manner and depending on the requirement, modular type inking units of a certain inking unit type or different types can be used.<br><br>
2-<br>
The document US 25 57 381 A shows a printing unit that can be flexibly erected for different printing methods and number of print positions, whereby the inking units and the printing cylinders are placed on top of one another like a tower and as such can be moved towards or away from one another. Different types and different numbers of printing units and inking units or inking systems can be selectively used in a standard frame.<br>
From the document EP 02 46 081 A2 we know of a printing unit with several components having the printing cylinders of a printing mechanism, as well as with units designed as inking units. The inking units can be set horizontally against the printing cylinders for on/off and can be brought vertically in contact with different printing mechanisms - a.o. also with different printing mechanisms having different print lengths The components having the printing cylinders can be exchanged with components of a different print length if required.<br>
The document DE 102 02 385 Al shows a drive draw between the cylinders of a printing mechanism with variable print length, whereby two intermediate gears are arranged between the cylinder spur gears not meshing with one another.<br>
The document EP 06 99 524 Bl presents drive draws of printing units, whereby in one design pair-wise drive of the printing cylinder takes place with the help of a single motor through spur gears meshing with one another.<br>
The document WO 03/039872 Al presents printing cylinders that are driven pair-wise by a drive motor in one design and the gear unit coupling both the cylinders is encapsulated in an own housing.<br>
The document DE 195 34 651 Al presents a printing unit with cylinders lying on one plane, whereby three of the four cylinders are supported in a linearly movable manner along the cylinder plane to the print-on or print-off positions. The mounting takes place in guiding elements arranged on the frame inner wall. The cylinders are supported against<br><br>
3<br>
the common guiding elements in beams and can be set to one another or removed by means of pressure-agent-driven working cylinders.<br>
In the document WO 02/081218 A one finds individual linear supports for two transmission cylinders supported in saddles, whereby a setting drive for the saddle can be designed as a cylinder that can be loaded with pressure agents. In order to define an end position for the setting movement running transverse to the cylinder plane, an adjustable buffer is foreseen.<br>
It is the task of this invention to create cost-effective printing units that are easy to manufacture.<br>
This task is fulfilled according to the invention by the features given in claim 1, 2 or 3. the advantages that can be achieved through the invention particularly consist of the fact that a printing unit is created that can be easily manufactures and/or is simple to operate and at the same time ensures high print quality<br>
With the help of a dividable side frame, as suggested in one design, one can achieve good accessibility, a contribution to possible modularity and low structural height. By using linear channels for the printing cylinders an ideal fitting position of the cylinders is achieved with respect to possible cylinder vibrations. Besides, by means of the cylinder mounting in linear channels low setting paths can be realised and hence also no synchronous spindles are required. The complex fitting of three-ring-bearings can be done away with.<br><br>
