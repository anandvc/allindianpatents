				<td>4-(lH-INDOL-l-YL)-l-PIPERIDINYL DERIVATIVES<br>
The present invention concerns 4-(lH-indol-l-yl)-l-piperidinyl derivatives having therapeutic potential in psychotic disorders. It further relates to their preparation, compositions comprising them and their use as a medicine.<br>
In EP-A-0,037,265, published on October 7,1981, EP-A-0,070,053, published on January 19, 1983, and in EP-A-0,378,255, published on July 18, 1990, there are described a number of 5-[[4-(lH-indol-3-yl)-l-piperidinyl]alkyl]-4(3H)-pyrimidinone derivatives having antipsychotic, antihistaminic and antiserotonergic activity. Structurally, the compounds of the present invention differ therefrom in that the 4 . position of their piperidine moiety is invariably substituted by a lH-indol-l-yl derivative.<br>
EP-A-0,470,039, published on February 5,1992, discloses 4-(3-aryl-lH-indoi-l-yl)-1 piperidinyl derivatives as selective antagonists of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptor without substantial dopamine D-2 antagonistic activity both in vivo and in vitro. Said selective antagonistic property is measured as the ratio between the dopamine D-2 receptor and the serotonin 5-HT2 receptor antagonistic activities. Unexpectedly, the compounds of the present invention differ therefrom in that they exhibit central dopamine and central serotonin antagonistic activity in vivo in similar dose-ranges, i.e. the ratio between central dopaminergic and central serotonergic activity is about unity.<br>
The compounds of the present invention show antipsychotic activity with an unexpected increased cardiovascular safety, i.e. they show an improved dissociation between the peripheral ?-adrenergic antagonistic activity and the central dopamine and serotonin<br>
antagonistic activity.<br>

the pharmaceuticaily acceptable addition salts and the stereochemically isomeric forms<br>
thereof.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can generally be prepared by N-alkylating a l-(piperidin-4-yl)-lH-indole derivative of formula (II) with an alkylating reagent of formula (HI) following the procedure described in EP-A-0,037,265, EP-A-0,070,053, EP-A-0,196,132 and in EP-A-0,378,255.<br><br>
In the following intermediates, the dashed line and the radicals D, Alk and R1 to R4 are defined as under formula (I) unless otherwise specified In intermediate (HI), W represents an appropriate reactive leaving group such as, for example, halo, e.g. chloro, bromo or iodo; sulfonyloxy, e.g. methanesulfonyloxy, 4-methylbenzenesulfonyloxy.<br>
In this and the following preparations, the reaction products may be isolated from the reaction medium and, if necessary, further purified according to methodologies generally known in the art such as, for example, extraction, crystallization, trituration and<br>
chromatography.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) wherein R3 and R4 are hydrogen and the heterocyclic moiety in the 4 position of the piperidine ring is an lH-indole, said compounds being represented by formula (I-f), may alternatively be prepared by cyclizing an intermediate of formula (IV) wherein W is a reactive leaving group such as, for example, halo, e.g. chloro, bromo or iodo; sulfonyloxy, e.g. methanesulfonyloxy, 4-methylbenzene-<br><br>
-7-<br>
sulfonyloxy, in the presence of a reductant such as, for example, a complex metal hydride, e.g. sodium borohydride. Said procedure is described in Synthetic Communications, 18(3), 265-273 (1988).<br><br>
EP-A-0,037,265, EP-A-0,070,053, EP-A-0,196,132 and EP-A-0,378,255 describe other alternative procedures to prepare compounds of formula (I). Furthermore, the compounds of formula (I) may be converted into each other following art-known functional group transformation reactions.<br>
A number of intermediates and starting materials are known compounds which may be prepared according to art-known methodologies. For example, intermediates of formula (III) and their preparations are described in EP-A-0,037,265, EP-A-0,070,053, EP-A-0,196,132 and in EP-A-0,378,255.<br>
Intermediates of formula (II) can be prepared following art-known procedures, e.g. by reductively aminating a ketone of formula (V), wherein P is a protecting group such as, for example, an alkyloxycarbonyl group, with an indole derivative of formula (VI), and subsequently removing the protecting group P by art-known deprotection techniques.<br><br>
Said reductive amination may conveniently be carried out by mixing the reactants in a suitable reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, methanol or toluene, with an appropriate reductant Preferably, the ketone of formula (V) is first reacted with the indole derivative of formula (VI) to form an enamine, which is subsequently reduced-Hydrogen in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as, for example, palladium or platinum supported on for instance charcoal may be used as an appropriate reductant.<br><br>
-8-<br>
Elevated pressure and/or temperature may enhance the rate of the reaction. In order to prevent the undesired further hydrogenation of certain functional groups in the reactants and the reaction products, it may be advantageous to add an appropriate catalyst poison to the reaction mixture such as, for example, thiophene.<br>
The intermediates of formula (VI) wherein the dashed line represents an extra bond and R3 and R4 are both hydrogen, may be prepared as described in Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry, 2, 298-299 (1965). <br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I) and some of the intermediates in the present invention contain at least one asymmetric carbon atom. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of said compounds and said intermediates can be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For example, diastereoisomers can be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. counter current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like methods. Enantiomers can be obtained from racemic mixtures by first converting said racemic mixtures with suitable resolving agents such as, for example, chiral acids, to mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds; then physically separating said mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds by, for example, selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. liquid chromatography and the like methods; and finally converting said separated diastereomeric salts or compounds into the corresponding enantiomers.<br>
Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) may also be obtained from the pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate intermediates and starting materials, provided that the intervening reactions occur stereospecifically. The pure and mixed stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) are intended to be embraced within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts and stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, are antagonists of neurotransmitters and in particular of the mediators serotonin and dopamine. Antagonizing said mediators will suppress or relieve a variety of symptoms associated with phenomena induced by the release, in particular the excessive release, of these mediators. Therapeutic indications for using the present compounds are mainly in the CNS area, especially in psychotic disorders. Further, serotonin is a potent broncho- and vasoconstrictor and thus the present antagonists may be used against hypertension and vascular disorders. In addition, serotonin antagonists have been associated with a number of other properties such as, the suppression of appetite and promotion of weight loss, which may prove<br><br>
-9-<br>
effective in combatting obesity; and also the alleviation of withdrawal symptoms in addicts trying to discontinue drinking and smoking habits. The present compounds also appear to be useful therapeutic agents for combatting autism.<br>
In view of the usefulness of the subject compounds in the treatment of diseases associated with the release of neurotransmitters, in particular in the treatment of psychotic diseases, the present invention provides a method of treating warm-blooded animals suffering from such diseases, in particular psychotic diseases, said method comprising the systemic administration of an antipsychotic amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt thereof, effective in treating diseases associated with the release of neurotransmitters, in particular psychotic diseases. Those of skill in the treatment of such diseases could readily determine the effective amount from the test results presented hereinafter. In general it is contemplated that an effective antipsychotic daily amount would be from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 4 mg/kg body weight, more preferably from about 0.04 mg/kg to about 2 mg/kg body weight.<br>
The present invention thus also relates to compounds of formula (I) as defined hereinabove for use as a medicine. Further, the present invention also relates to the use of a compound of formula (I) for the manufacture of a medicament for treating psychotic<br>
diseases.<br>
The "apomorphine, tryptamine, norepinephrine (ATN) test in rats" is used to evaluate dopamine antagonism, serotonin antagonism and ?-adrenergic antagonistic properties of the compounds of formula (I). In said test, which is described hereinafter, rats are observed for effects which are indicative for peripheral and central activity of the tested compounds. Centrally acting serotonin antagonists are potential antipsychotic drugs, in particular when simultaneously displaying dopamine antagonism. Peripheral serotonin antagonists are potentially useful in the gastro-intestinal and cardiovascular field, in particular when simultaneously displaying a-adrenergic antagonistic activity. The compounds of the present invention show a strong central dopamine and serotonin antagonism and little peripheral a-adrenergic antagonistic activity. In view of the central dopamine and serotonin antagonistic activity of the compounds of formula (I), they are particularly useful in combatting psychoses, aggressive behaviour, anxiety, depression and migraine. Furthermore, the improved dissociation between peripheral a-adrenergic antagonistic activity and central dopamine and serotonin antagonistic activity of the compounds of formula (I) over prior known antipsychotic agents, leads to an increased cardiovascular safety, i.e. a decreased likelihood of hypotension.<br><br>
-10-<br>
For administration purposes, the subject compounds may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, in addition salt or in free acid or base form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for administration orally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable solutions containing compounds of formula (I) may be formulated in an oil for prolonged action. Appropriate oils for this purpose are, for example, peanut oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, soy bean oil, synthetic glycerol esters of long chain fatty acids and mixtures of these and other oils. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wettable agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause any significant deleterious effects on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on or as an ointment. Addition salts of (I) due to their increased water solubility over the corresponding free base or free acid form, are obviously more suitable in the preparation of aqueous compositions.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active<br><br>
-11-<br>
ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate and not to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Experimental part<br>
Hereinafter, "RT" means room temperature and "DIPE" means diisopropyl ether.<br>
A. Preparation of the intermediates Example 1<br>
a)	Sodium methylate (1260,5 g) was added dropwise to a suspension of thiourea (373<br>
g) in ethanol (1750 ml) and the dropping funnel was rinsed with ethanol (175 ml). The<br>
mixture was heated to 40 °C and 3-acetyldihydro-2(3H)-furanone (448.5 g) was added<br>
dropwise. The dropping funnel was rinsed with ethanoi (475 ml) and the reaction<br>
mixture was stirred and refluxed for 6.25 hours. Stirring was continued for 2 hours,<br>
while cooling. The solvent was evaporated and the residue was dissolved in water (2800<br>
ml). This mixture was cooled on ice and neutralized with hydrochloric acid (490 ml) The<br>
precipitate was filtered off, washed with water (350 ml) and dried, yielding 268 g<br>
(41.1%) of 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-mercapto-6-methyl-4(3W)-pyrimi(Hnone<br>
(intermediate-1).<br>
b)	A mixture of intermediate 1 (37.2 g) and sodium methylate (36 g) in methanol (250<br>
ml) was stirred for 30 min. Ethane iodide (31.2 g) was added dropwise. The reaction<br>
mixture was stirred and refluxed for 3 hours. The solvent was evaporated and the<br>
residue was stirred in water, filtered and recrystallized from CH3CN. The precipitate<br>
was filtered off and dried, yielding 26 g (60%) of 2-(ethylthio)-5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-6-<br>
methyl-4(3H)-pyrimidinone (intermediate 2).<br>
c)	Potassium hydroxide (8.4 g) was added to a solution of intermediate 2 (33 g) in<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide (150 ml). The mixture was stirred for 1 hour at 60-70 °C. The<br>

C. Pharmacological Example<br>
Example 14 : "apomorphine, trvptamine. norepinephrine (ATN) test in rats" The antipsychotic activity of the subject compounds is evidenced by the experimental data obtained in the combined apomorphine (APO), tryptamine (TRY) and norepinephrine (NOR) test in rats. Said combined apomorphine, tryptamine and norepinephrine test is described in Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn., 227. 238-253 (1977) and provides an empirical evaluation of the relative specificity with which drugs may effect particular neurotransmitter systems centrally (CNS) as well as peripherally. In particular, the test demonstrates the antagonistic activity of the tested compounds of formula (I) on dopamine (by preventing the symptoms elicited with the dopamine agonist apomorphine), on serotonin (by preventing the central symptoms (convulsions) and peripheral symptoms (hyperaemia) elicited with serotonin or tryptamine), and on<br><br>
-19-<br>
norepinephrine (by preventing or delaying death upon administration of the a-agonist norepinephrine). The favourable pharmacological property of the compounds of formula (I) lies in the absence of a strong ?-adrenergic antagonistic activity (column NOR) leading to an improved dissociation between peripheral ?-adrenergic antagonistic activity and central serotonin (column TRY convulsions) and central dopamine (column APO) antagonistic activity.<br>
The test is carried out following the procedures described in EP-A-0,196,132 and the experimental data are summarized in Table 5.<br>
