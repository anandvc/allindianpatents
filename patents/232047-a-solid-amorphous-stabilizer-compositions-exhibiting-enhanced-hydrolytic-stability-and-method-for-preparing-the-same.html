				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a solid amorphous stabilizer composition exhibiting enhanced hydrolytic stability. AND METHOD FOR PREPARING THE SAME  <br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Amine compounds have been utilized in conjunction with phosphites, specifically pentaerythritol phosphites, for enhancing the phosphite's resistance to hydrolysis, see York, U.S. Patent 4,166,926, issued September 26, 1978. The York reference while teaching enhanced stability for the phosphites by utilizing in combination amine compounds and phosphite compounds, can still result in compositions that exhibit water weight gain upon extended exposure to humid conditions at ambient temperature. Accordingly, there is a need to provide pentaerythritol phosphites compositions which exhibit extended resistance to hydrloysis.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a solid amorphous stabilizer composition exhibiting enhanced hydrolytic stability comprising:<br>
(a) a phosphorous compound selected from the group consisting of phosphites and phosphonites, said phosphorus compound being present at a level of from 10 percent by weight to 99.9 percent by weight based on the total weight of the stabilizer composition, and<br>
(b)an aliphatic polyamine present at a level of from 0.1 percent by weight to 10 percent by weight based on the total weight of trie composition.<br>
This invention involves an amorphous (glassy, noncrystalline) solid phosphite stabilizer composition with improved hydrolytic stability, which comprises a melt blend of an organic phosphite and an aliphatic polyamine, more preferably comprises a blend of crystalline phosphite and an aliphatic primary diamine. The blends have surprisingly an unexpectedly exhibited superior hydrolytic stability compared to melt blend compositions comprising the<br><br>
phosphite and triisop-ropanolamine and compared to ground admixtures of the phosphite and aliphatic polyamine. The solid stabilizer compositions are useful as additives for stabilizing polymeric compositions against ther-ma-1 oxidative degradation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  Suitable phosphorous compounds include phosphites and phpsphonites. Suitable phosphites include those elected from the general formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3 and each R4 represent either equal or different hydrooarbyl radicals, which can be either alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkar.yl or ara-lkyl radicals; R5 may be the hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalk-yl, aryl, alkaryl or aralkyl radicals. The phosphites may also be selec-ted from the general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
suitable phosphonites include those of the general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein the R7 and R8 radicals independently represent either alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkaryl or aralkyl radicals.<br>
The phosphite is preferably a pentaerythritol phosphite which may be selected from the group consisting of (a) compounds of the formula<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R7 is an aliphatic radical containing 1 to about 20 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl ring of 5 to about 8 carbon atoms, or an aryl, alkaryl, or aralkyl group of 6 to about 14 carbon atoms, and (b) compounds of the formula<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R7 is defined as above. Illustrative of these compounds are those where R7 is an aliphatic radical; R7 can be (a) an alkyl radical such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, n-hexyl, 2-ethylhexyl, n-dodecyl, n-tetradecyl, n-octadecyl, and the like, (b) an alkoxyalkyl radical of 2 to about 20 carbon atoms<br><br>
such as methoxyethyl, ethoxyethyl, ethoxypropyl, and the like, and (c) alkoxy carboalkyl radicals of 2 to about 20 carbon atoms such as methoxycarboethyl, propyloxycarboethyl, decyloxycarboethyl, and the like. When R7 is a cycloalkyl ring, illustrations of R7 include cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclooctyl, and the like. When R7 is an aryl group, phenyl and naphthyl are examples thereof. The aryl group can be halogenated as in a bromophenyl group. Lastly, when R7 is alkaryl of 7 to about 14 carbon atoms; i.e., an alkyl-substituted phenyl or naphthyl group, illustrations thereof are methylphenyl, t-butyl-phenyl, nonylphenyl, and the like; and when R7 is aralkyl of 7 to about 14 carbon atoms; i.e., an aryl-substituted alkyl group, benzyl and phenylethyl are examples thereof. The alkaryl or aralkyl group can be halogenated as in a 2-chloroethylphenyl group. Most preferably the phosphite in its pure (natural) state is a crystalline phosphite.<br>
Examples of the defined pentaerythritol phosphites are dimethylpentaerythritol diphosphite, diethylpentaerythritol diphosphite, didodecylpentaerylthritol diphosphite, dioctadecylpentaerythritol diphosphite, diphenylpentaerylthritol diphosphite, ditolylpentaerythritol diphosphite, di-p-chlorophenylpentaerythritol diphosphite, dibenzylpentaerythritol diphosphite, and the like. U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,847,443; 2,961,454; 3,000,850; 3,205,250; and 3,737,485 disclose further examples of the defined compounds.<br>
More preferably, the R7 groups are alkyl radicals of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, cyclohexyl, phenyl, or benzyl.  Most preferably, R7 is a higher-alkyl group<br><br>
containing about 6 to about 20 carbon atoms such as n-hexyl, n-octyl, 2-ethylhexyl, n-decyl, n-tetradecyl, n-octa'decyl, and the like.<br>
The preferred species is of the formula:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Another  preferred  phosphite  is  of  the  general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R6 and R9 are each an alkyl g.roup having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and preferably are each t-butyl group.<br>
The aliphatic polyamine preferably has a boiling point of greater than 175°, more pre^erabiy greater than 190°, and most preferably greater than 200pC. The aliphatic polyamine may con-tain primary, secondary or tertiary amine groups. Preferably the amine groups are pra-mary amine groups. The polyamine may contain 2, 3 or mor-e amine groups, and in other words may be a diamine, triamine or greater polyamine amine. The preferred polyamines are aliphatic primary diamines of the formulas<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
wherein R10 is selected from C6 to C,0 divalent alkyl radicals, and more preferably the diamine is selected from 1,6 diaminohexane and 1,10-diaminodecane. Suitable aliphatic secondary diamines may be represented by the general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R11 is selected from C1 to C10 divalent alkyl radicals and R12 is selected from C1 to C10 monovalent alkylratical.- Suitable aliphatic tertiary diamines may be represented by the general formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R11 and R12 are defined as above. Most preferably the polyamine is an aliphatic primary diamine.<br>
The present invention also involves a process involving the melt blending of a crystalline phosphite and a polyamine to form a melt blend, and cooling the melt blend to form an amorphous solid phosphite composition. The process may also involve storing the phosphite for a period in excess of 10 days (possibly in humid conditions (&gt;60% relative humidity)) at ambient temperature, and then compounding the phosphite composition with a thermoplastic polymer such as a polyolefin, for example polypropylene for thermal oxidative stability thereof.<br>
The stabilizer composition of the present invention comprises from 10 percent by weight to 99.9<br><br>
percent by weight of the phosphite based on the total weight of the stabilizer composition, more preferably from 90 to 99.8 percent by weight thereof, more preferably from 96 to 99.5 percent by weight thereof, and most preferably from 97 to 99 percent by weight thereof. The polyamine is preferably present at a level of from 0.1 to 10 percent by weight based on the total weight of the stabilizer composition, more preferably from 0.2 to 5 percent by weight thereof, more preferably present at a level of from 0.5 to 4 percent by weight thereof, and most preferably present at a level of from 1 to 3 percent by weight thereof. The stabilizer composition is in the form of amorphous (non-crystalline) particles, such as powders and pellets. The stabilizer composition preferably contains less than 10 percent by weight of other materials such as polymeric materials and other organic materials such as waxes, synthetic and petroleum dried lubricating oils and greases; animal oils such as for example fat, tallow, lard, cod liver oil, sperm oil; vegetable oil such as caster, linseed, peanut, cod seed, and the like; fuel oil, diesel oil, gasoline, and the like. In other words, the stabilizer composition, is preferably substantially free of other materials, in other words, containing less than 1 percent of other organic materials, and more preferably is free of other organic materials. Preferably, the stabilizer composition is essentially free of monoamines, such as triisopropylamine. The compositions of the present invention are preferably amorphous to ensure homogeneity of the compositions. The present compositions are preferably obtained by melt mixing rather than simple mechanical blending or solution<br><br>
blending, and surprisingly and unexpectedly the compositions made by melt mixing show superior hydrolytic stability over similar compositions made by simple mechanical (dry) or solution blending.<br>
Examples EXA-H are comparative examples. EX1 and 2 illustrate the present invention. Example A is crystalline bis(2,4 di - tert-butylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite (Phosl). Example B is a ground (mechanical dry blend) admixture of 9 9 wt% Phosl and 1% wt% trisisopropanol amine (TIPA). Example C is glass (amorphous) melt blend of 9 9 wt% Phosl and 1 wt% TIPA. Example D is a ground admixture of 99 wt% Phosl and 1 wt% 1,10-diaminodecane (DAD). Example 1 is an amorphous melt blend of 99 wt% Phosl and 1 wt% DAD. Note the superior properties of Exl over ExA-D. Example E was a crystalline state and was a phosphite of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Example F was Phos2 is a glass state. Example G was an amorphous melt blend of 9 9 wt% Phos2 and 1 wt% Tinuvin 770 Bis ( 2 , 2,6,6, -tetra-methylpiperidyl)sebacate. Example H was an amorphous melt blend containing 99 wt% Phos2 and 1 wt% trioctyl amine. Example 2 was an amorphous melt blend containing 99 wt % Phos 2 and 1 wt% 1,10-diaminodecane.   Note the superior performance of<br><br>
Example 2 over Example E-H. The samples were exposed to 75% nominal relative humidity at room temperature (approx. 70° F) for extended periods of time, and these various levels of hydrolytic stability are evidence by percent weight gain with the lower percentages of weight gain at a given level of exposure time evidencing higher levels of hydrolytic stability.<br>
Example 3 is an amorphous solid (melt blend) of (99 parts weight (pbw) bis (2,4 di-t-butylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite and (1 part by weight) 1,6-diamino bexane. Example I is a crystalline form of bis (2,4-di-t-butylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite. Example J is an amorphous solid of bis (2,4 di-t-butylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite. Example K is a blend of bis (2,4 di-t-butylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite (99 pbw) with 1 pbw of octadecylamine. Example L is an amorphous solid (melt blend) of bis (2,4 di-t-butylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite (95.4 pbw) with octadecylamine (4.6 pbw). Example L uses an equal base equivalent level of amine as does Example 3. Examples I-L are comparative examples. Note the substantially enhanced resistance to water weight gain of Example 3 over comparative examples I-L. The substantial enhancement in resistance is both surprising and unexpected.<br>
The composition of the present invention is not a mere admixture resulting in the aggregation of the properties of the ingredients but is a synergistic composition resulting in unexpected properties in the formation of the composition. No chemical reaction is involved.<br><br>
