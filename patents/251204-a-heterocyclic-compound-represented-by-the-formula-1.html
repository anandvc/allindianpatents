PIPERAZINE-SUBSTITUTED BENZOTHIOPHENES FOR TREATMENT OF MENTAL DISORDERS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel heterocyclic compound.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Since causal factor of schizophrenia as well as of bipolar disorder, mood disorders and emotional disorders is heterogeneous, it is desirable that a drug has multiple pharmacological effects so as to develop wide treatment spectrum.<br>
W02004/026864A1 discloses that a carbostyril derivative represented by the general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
(wherein A1 represents - (CH2)mCH2-, -(CH2)mO-, etc.; m represents an integer of 1 to 4; and RA represents a hydrogen atom, a C1_4 alkyl group which may be substituted with 1 to 3 fluorine atoms, etc.) has D2 receptor antagonist activity and serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor antagonist activity and it is effective for<br>
treatment of schizophrenia and other central nervous system disorders).<br>
However, there is no description in<br>

Partial agonistic activity on dopamine D2 receptor was evaluated by quantitatively determining cyclic AMP production inhibitory effect of a test compound in dopamine D2 receptor expression cells in which adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP)<br>
production was induced by forskolin stimulation. Human recombinant dopamine D2 receptor expressing Chinese hamster ovary/DHFR(-) cells were cultured in a culture medium (Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM culture medium), 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 I.U./ml penicillin, 50 µg/ml streptomycin, 200 µg/ml geneticin, 0.1 mM sodium hypoxanthine, 16 µM thymidine) at 37°C and 5% carbon dioxide condition.  Cells were seeded at 104 cells/well on a 96-well microtiter plate coated with poly-L-lysine and grown under the same condition for 2 days.  Each well was washed with 100 µl of a culture medium (IMDM culture medium, 0.1 mM sodium hypoxanthine, 16 µM thymidine) .  The culture medium was replaced with 50 µ1 of culture medium (IMDM culture medium, 0.1% sodium ascorbate, 0.1 mM sodium hypoxanthine, 16 uM thymidine) having dissolved therein 3 µM of a test compound. After allowed to incubate at 37°C, 5% carbon dioxide condition for 20 minutes, the culture medium was replaced with 100 µl of forskolin stimulative culture medium (IMDM culture medium, 0.1% sodium ascorbate, 0.1 mM sodium hypoxanthine, 16 1M thymidine, 10 u-M forskolin, 500 µM 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine) having 3 µM of the test compound dissolved therein and allowed to incubate at 37°C, 5% carbon dioxide condition for 10 minutes.  After the culture medium was removed, 200 µl of Lysis 1B aqueous solution (Amersham Bioscience, reagent attached to cyclic AMP biotrack enzyme<br>
immunoassay system) was dispensed and shaken for 10 minutes.  The aqueous solution of each well was used as a sample for measurement.  Samples for measurement quadruply diluted were subjected to measurement of the quantity of cyclic AMP using the above-described enzyme immunoassay system.  Inhibition ratio of the respective test compound was calculated assuming that the quantity of cyclic AMP of the well to which no test compound was added was 100%.  In this empiric test system, dopamine which was used as a control drug suppressed the quantity of cyclic AMP to about 10% as the maximum activity.<br>
It was confirmed that test compounds had partial agonistic activity for dopamine D2 receptor in the above-described test.<br>
Since the test compounds has partial agonistic activity for dopamine D2 receptor, they can stabilize dopamine neurotransmission to a normal condition in a schizophrenia patient and as a result, exhibit, for example, positive and negative condition improving effect, cognitive impairment improving effect and the other symptom improving effects without causing side effects.<br>

Wistar rats (male, six-seven weeks old, Japan SLC, Inc.) were used as test animals.  A test compound was suspended in 5% gum arable/(physiological saline or water) using an agate mortar and was diluted with the same solvent if necessary.<br>
Test animals were fasted overnight from the day before observation on catalepsy and ptosis was performed 1, -2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after each test compound was orally administered (5 ml/kg).  Six test animals were used for each group.<br>
One forepaw of a rat was placed on an edge of<br>
a steel small box (width: 6.5 cm, depth: 4.0 cm, height: 7.2 cm) (an unnatural pose) and when the rat maintained the pose for more than 30 seconds, it was judged that the case was catalepsy positive.  This observation was performed three times at each point, and if there was at least one positive case, it was judged that catalepsy occurred in the individual.<br>
As a result, catalepsy induction effect of a test compound was dissociated from inhibitory effect on apomorphine-induced stereotyped behavior, therefore it was suggested that apprehension for extrapyramidal side effect in clinic would be low.<br>
Pharmacological Test 6<br>
Measurement of serotonin (5-HT) uptake inhibitory activity of a test compound by rat brain synaptosome<br>
Wistar male rats were decapitated, the brain was retrieved and frontal cortex was dissected out, and it was homogenized in 0.32 M sucrose solution of a weight 20 times of the weight of the tissue using a Potter type homogenizer.  The homogenate was centrifuged at 4°C, 1,000 x g for 10 minutes, the obtained supernatant was further centrifuged at 4°C, 20,000 x g for 20 minutes, and the pellet was suspended in an incubation buffer (20 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mM glucose, 145 mM sodium chloride, 4.5 mM potassium chloride, 1.2 mM magne-sium chloride, 1.5<br>
mM calcium chloride), which was used as crude synaptosome fraction.<br>
5-HT uptake reaction was performed in a volume of 200 |ul using a 96-well round bottom plate and pargyline (final concentration 10 juM) and sodium ascorbate (final concentration 0.2 mg/ml) were contained in the incubation buffer upon reaction and used.<br>
Incubation buffer (total counting), non-labeled 5-HT(final concentration lOµM, non-specific counting) and the diluted test compound (final concentration 300nM) were added to each well.  One-tenth quantity of the final volume of the synaptosome fraction was added and after preincubated at 37°C for 10 minutes, tritium labeled 5-HT solution (final concentration 8 nM) was added and uptake reaction was started at 37°C.  The uptake time was 10 minutes and the reaction was terminated by vacuum filtration through a 96-well fiber glass filter paper plate, and after the filter paper was washed with cold normal saline, it was dried enough and MicroscintO (Perkin-Elmer) was added to the filter and remaining radioactivity on the filter was measured.<br>
Serotonin uptake inhibitory activity (%) was calculated from the radioactivity of total counting as 100%, of non-specific counting as 0%, and of counting obtained with test compound.<br>
% of inhibition of 5-HT(%)=<br>
100-[(Count obtained with test compound-Nonspecific count(0% Uptake))/(Total count(100% Uptake)-Nonspecific count (0% Uptake) )] xlOO<br>
The results are shown in the next Table 24. <br>
