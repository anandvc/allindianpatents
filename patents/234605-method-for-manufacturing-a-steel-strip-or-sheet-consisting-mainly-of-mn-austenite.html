				<td>METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING A STEEL STRIP OR SHEET<br>
CONSISTING MAINLY OF TO BE <br>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a<br>
steel strip or sheet consisting mainly of Mn-austenite.<br>
Steels suitable for manufacturing these products are<br>
assigned to AISI 200 and bear the designation S20100 to<br>
S24000. Steel materials of this type are distinguished<br>
by a high strength which is conserved after welding even<br>
in the region of the weld seam.<br>
These good strength properties are achieved by<br>
interstitial and substitutional mixed crystal hardening.<br>
Carbon and nitrogen are particularly effective in this<br>
respect. Higher carbon contents are avoided however<br>
because of the undesirable carbide formation. Thus,<br>
nitrogen is preferentially used for interstitial mixed<br>
crystal hardening in steels of the type in question.<br>
However, the production of steels having an elevated<br>
nitrogen content is expensive in relation to the<br>
alloying constituents or the apparatus required for the<br>
production.<br>
In a known method for producing steels having higher<br>
nitrogen contents the melt is molten under the<br>
application of a compressive load. The pressure acting<br>
on the melt in this case is so far abov,e the nitrogen<br>
partial pressure that the nitrogen in the appropriate<br>
steel goes into solution. The advantage of this<br>
procedure is that steels having higher nitrogen contents<br>
can be produced without adding particular quantities of<br>
other alloying elements. A disadvantage however is the<br>
high expenditure on apparatus required for this.<br><br><br>
An alternative method for dissolving the nitrogen by<br>
applying a compressive load during melting involves<br>
increasing the solubility of the melt itself. This can<br>
be achieved by high contents of chromium and manganese.<br>
A description of the properties of steels having<br>
corresponding compositions compiled by M. du Toit can<br>
currently be found on the internet at<br>
"www.tecnet.co.za/mags/steel/featurel.htm". The known<br>
steels can be melted and cast conventionally without<br>
applying any compressive load, but not in continuous<br>
casting. Casting of known steels thus incurs high costs.<br>
A further increase in the strength of conventionally<br>
castable steels of the type described previously can be<br>
achieved by alloying with aluminium and/or silicon.<br>
These two elements support the mixed crystal hardening<br>
and thus lead to a further increase in strength.<br>
Furthermore, the addition of aluminium and silicon can<br>
influence the stacking fault energy which again<br>
influences the deformation processes.<br>
Thus, the addition of aluminium leads to an increase in<br>
the stacking fault energy and favours deformation by<br>
twinning. Silicon however, reduces the stacking fault<br>
energy but favours deformation by martensite formation.<br>
As a result of the combined addition of silicon and<br>
aluminium the strengthening of the material during<br>
deformation can thereby be specifically influenced. The<br>
formation of martensite leads to high strengthening<br>
whereas the strengthening is reduced by twinning.<br>
The advantages of adding amounts of aluminium and<br>
silicon to steels of the type in question are offset by<br>
the disadvantage that they are ferrite formers and<br><br>
favour primary ferritic solidification. The resulting<br>
ferrite only has a low solubility for nitrogen.<br>
Consequently the nitrogen is eliminated in the form of<br>
gas bubbles during the solidification. In order to<br>
achieve a high-strength austenitic steel whilst<br>
retaining the increased nitrogen content however, the<br>
austenite must thus be stabilised. In addition to<br>
increasing the raw material costs, the further increased<br>
manganese contents required for this give rise to<br>
appreciable problems in the production of such high-<br>
manganese steels in steelworks.<br>
The problem for the invention is thus to provide a<br>
method of manufacturing a steel consisting mainly of Mn-<br>
austenite which can be manufactured economically and at<br>
the same time exhibits increased strength compared with<br>
the prior art.<br>
The problem is solved by a method for manufacturing a<br>
steel strip or sheet consisting mainly of Mn-austenite<br>
in which a steel is melted which contains the following<br>
alloying constituents (in wt. %):<br><br><br><br>
max. 2.0 % Cu,<br>
and iron and unavoidable impurities as the<br>
remainder,<br>
and in which the steel is cast into a thin strip having<br>
a maximum thickness of 10 mm in a casting gap formed<br>
between two rotating rollers or rolls, whereby the<br>
rollers or rolls are cooled so intensively that the thin<br>
strip in the casting gap is cooled at a cooling rate of<br>
at least 200 K/s. The thickness of the thin strip is<br>
preferably between 1 and 5 mm. Naturally, the details of<br>
the steel composition used according to the invention<br>
also include such alloys for which the content of these<br>
alloying elements is zero for which only a maximum<br>
permissible upper limit of the content is given.<br>
According to further refinements of the invention, the<br>
chromium content of the steel can be limited to 17.00 -<br>
21.00 wt.% Cr, the manganese content can be limited to<br>
8.00 - 12.00 wt.% Mn and/or the nitrogen content can be<br>
limited to 0.40 - 0.60 wt.% N. In addition, contents of<br>
Ni, Mo and/or Cu can be present in the steel.<br>
The contents of the alloying elements contained in the<br>
steel composition used according to the invention are<br>
optimised in each case in terms of the action of these<br>
elements. Thus, Cr, Mn, Mo, V, Nb and Al increase the<br>
nitrogen solubility in the melt whereas Ni and Cu, being<br>
austenite formers, and Si reduce the nitrogen<br>
solubility. As mentioned, Si also acts as a mixed<br>
crystal hardener. In addition, it is also used for grain<br>
refinement and lowers the stacking fault energy.<br>
Aluminium on the other hand increases the stacking fault<br>
energy. Molybdenum also acts as a mixed crystal hardener<br>
and improves the corrosion behaviour. Vanadium also has<br>
a grain-refining action and enhances the strength. The<br><br><br>
addition of Nb leads to an increase in strength by<br>
precipitation hardening.<br>
The invention makes use of the fundamentally known<br>
technique of a strip casting plant where the steel is<br>
cast in the casting gap formed between the rollers or<br>
rolls of, for example, a double-roller casting<br>
apparatus, and is cooled so intensively that there is a<br>
shift from primary ferritic towards primary austenitic<br>
solidification. This makes it possible to transfer the<br>
nitrogen dissolved in the melt into the steel since the<br>
austenite possesses a high solubility for nitrogen. Such<br>
intensive cooling is only made possible by casting a<br>
thin strip in a casting gap whose walls formed by the<br>
casting rolls or rollers move essentially at the same<br>
speed as the cast strip so that a continuous intensive<br>
heat exchange is ensured between the walls (casting<br>
roll/roller) and the cast steel in the casting gap.<br>
The intensive cooling taking place at a high cooling<br>
rate ensures that nitrogen gas bubbles possibly forming<br>
in the solidifying melt remain small and the pressure<br>
directed towards them is high. This prevents any<br>
nitrogen outgassing in the course of the solidification.<br>
In addition, such an escape of nitrogen is also<br>
suppressed by the high ferrostatic pressure which occurs<br>
as a result of the large height of the melt pool in the<br>
casting gap. In this way it is ensured that the pressure<br>
PN in any forming nitrogen gas bubbles is always lower<br>
than the sum of the ambient pressure PA, the ferrostatic<br>
pressure PF and twice the surface tension a of the gas<br>
bubbles relative to the bubble radius r (i.e. PN
+ 2σ/r).<br><br><br>
The rapid solidification of the cast strip during strip<br>
casting thus offers great freedom in terms of the choice<br>
of steel composition especially in connection with<br>
steels of the type used according to the invention. As<br>
explained, as a result of the rapid solidification<br>
larger quantities of nitrogen can be dissolved. Alloying<br>
elements which improve the material properties can thus<br>
be added in larger quantities than in the conventional<br>
method of manufacture without regard to their possible<br>
negative influence on the nitrogen solubility. For<br>
example, if the steel contains higher quantities of Si,<br>
the risk of nitrogen outgassing present in conventional<br>
manufacture as a result of the slow solidification and<br>
the associated increased ferrite formation is eliminated<br>
in the method according to the invention. Also in the<br>
case of increased Al contents the formation of A1N which<br>
occurs during slower cooling is avoided by the rapid<br>
cooling provided according to the invention. Thus,<br>
without regard to the harmful influences caused by slow<br>
cooling, the invention allows the deformation mechanism<br>
of each alloy used to be specifically adjusted by a<br>
suitable choice of Al and Si content so that an end<br>
product having optimised properties is obtained.<br>
The cost advantage achieved by the invention in the<br>
processing of steels of the type used according to the<br>
invention which are inherently difficult to deform is<br>
quite considerable. This applies both to those steels<br>
containing up to 7.5 wt.% Mn which can be cast by<br>
conventional continuous casting and also to those<br>
containing more than 7.5 wt.% Mn which conventionally<br>
can only be cast by block casting and then rolled to the<br>
desired end thickness by several passes with reheating<br>
if necessary.<br><br><br>
At the present time hot strip made of continuously<br>
castable alloy can only be manufactured with minimum<br>
thicknesses of 3.5 mm in a conventional hot wide-strip<br>
mill. The production of cold strip having target<br>
thicknesses of 0.8 - 1.2 mm is only feasible by<br>
intermediate annealing. In the method involving strip<br>
casting according to the invention intermediate<br>
annealing is no longer necessary however because of the<br>
smaller thickness of the hot strip obtained. Since a<br>
thin strip having final thicknesses between 1 and 3 mm<br>
can be produced by the strip casting provided by the<br>
invention, in many cases it is also possible to adjust<br>
the final thickness of the strip produced so that cold<br>
rolling can be dispensed with completely. In this way<br>
the problems caused by the low deformability of Mn-<br>
austenites in the conventional method of manufacture can<br>
be avoided.<br>
The method according to the invention can be used to<br>
produce steel strip and sheet having particularly high<br>
nitrogen contents of 0.4 to 0.6 wt.% and alloyed with up<br>
to 3 % aluminium and/or silicon without the steel<br>
production needing to take place under excess pressure<br>
or particularly high manganese contents being required.<br>
The steel products thus produced possess a fine-grained<br>
isotropic structure with slight macro-segregation or a<br>
small number of coarse inclusions. As a result of their<br>
Al and/or Si content, these products also exhibit an<br>
enhanced strength and ductility compared with the prior<br>
art. For a steel strip or sheet produced according to<br>
the invention the strengthening and thus the energy<br>
absorption during deformation can be specifically<br>
adjusted by the choice of alloy.<br><br>
Casting of the thin strip preferably takes place in a<br>
protective gas atmosphere. As a result of casting in a<br>
protective gas atmosphere it is easy to produce a thin<br>
strip having a modified surface whose degree of<br>
oxidation can be specifically influenced. In this way<br>
scale formation can be avoided.<br>
The strip thus produced can then be hot-rolled "in-line"<br>
in a roll stand without the risk of the rollers<br>
sticking. It is particularly advantageous in this<br>
respect if the thin strip is heated to an initial<br>
rolling temperature before hot rolling. As a result of<br>
this increase in temperature, higher degrees of<br>
deformation can be achieved during hot rolling.<br>
By subjecting the hot strip to heat treatment after the<br>
hot rolling its structure can be specifically optimised.<br>
The heat treatment can comprise annealing followed by<br>
controlled cooling.<br>
As a result of its spectrum of properties, steel sheet<br>
produced according to the invention is especially<br>
suitable for the manufacture of automobile-body sheet<br>
metal parts, stiffening structural components used<br>
particularly in general vehicle building and especially<br>
in automobile building, landing-gear or chassis parts,<br>
vehicle wheels and fuel tanks. In all these applications<br>
the especially good strength properties of the steel<br>
sheet produced by the method according to the invention<br>
have an advantageous effect. In addition, the good<br>
corrosion resistance of the steel sheet and strip<br>
according to the invention is advantageous in such<br>
applications where they come in contact with aggressive<br>
media, such as fuels for example.<br><br>
The invention is subsequently explained in greater<br>
detail with reference to accompanying drawing showing an example of<br>
embodiment.<br>
The figure shows a schematic diagram of a strip casting<br>
plant 1. In this plant for example, a steel is processed<br>
which in addition to the usual unavoidable impurities<br>
contains (in wt.%) 0.08 % C, 0.5 % Si, 10 % Mn, 19 % Cr,<br>
0.5 % N, 0.3 % Al and the remainder is iron.<br>
The strip casting plant 1 comprises a double-roller<br>
casting apparatus called a "double roller" of which the<br>
rollers 2, 3 each rotating in opposite directions about<br>
an axis of rotation are shown in the figure. Between the<br>
rollers 2, 3 there is formed a casting gap 4 which is<br>
continuously filled with melt so that a melt pool S<br>
forms above the casting gap 4.<br>
The rollers 2, 3 are intensively cooled during the<br>
casting process by cooling devices not shown so that the<br>
melt entering the casting gap 4 solidifies primarily<br>
austenitically at cooling rates higher than 200 K/s and<br>
leaves the casting gap 4 as a thin strip D having a<br>
thickness of 1 to 5 mm. The thin strip D thus produced<br>
then passes through a furnace 5 in which it is heated to<br>
an initial rolling temperature.<br>
Both the double-roller casting device with the rollers<br>
2, 3 and the furnace 5 are accommodated in a housing 6<br>
which contains a protective gas atmosphere. As a result<br>
of casting the thin strip D and re-heating it in the<br>
furnace 5 in a protective gas atmosphere the formation<br>
of scale on the surface of the thin strip D is largely<br>
avoided.<br><br><br>
The thin strip D heated to the initial rolling<br>
temperature enter a roll mill 7 in which it is hot-<br>
rolled to a final size. As a result of the high initial<br>
rolling temperature high degrees of deformation are<br>
possible. The hot strip W rolled from the thin strip D<br>
entering the roll mill essentially scale-free exhibits a<br>
particularly high-quality surface after the hot rolling.<br>
After the hot rolling in the roll mill 7 the hot strip W<br>
is annealed in a continuous annealing furnace 8 and then<br>
cooled in a controlled fashion under a cooling device 9<br>
in order to specifically improve its structure. The hot<br>
strip W thus heat-treated is then coiled to form a coil<br>
10.<br>
Steel strip produced in the manner described previously<br>
exhibits particularly high strength accompanied by good<br>
deformability and equally good energy absorption<br>
capacity compared with steel strips having the<br>
convention composition and produced by conventional<br>
methods as a result of the high nitrogen content<br>
achieved by the rapid cooling between the rollers 2, 3<br>
of the double-roller casting apparatus.<br>
The following table compares the superior strength<br>
values of the hot strip W produced in the casting roller<br>
plant 1 according to the invention with the strength<br>
