The present invention concerns the use of a catalyst<br>
component having controlled grain size to prepare<br>
polyolefins and to prevent or reduce defects in products<br>
made from these polyolefins. The invention concerns an<br>
olefin polymerisation process using a Ziegler Natta-type<br>
catalyst.<br>
Olefin polymerisation processes are generally known.<br>
Further, it is well known that polymers of olefins can be<br>
prepared by olefin polymerisation in a hydrocarbon diluent<br>
or in monomers acting as diluents. On an industrial scale,<br>
one reactor type, which may be applied in such processes,<br>
is a turbulent flow reactor such as a continuous pipe<br>
reactor in the form of a loop. However, other types of<br>
reactors such as stirred reactors may be used.<br>
Polymerisation is carried out in a loop reactor in a<br>
circulating turbulent flow. A so -called loop reactor is<br>
well known and is described in the Encyclopaedia of<br>
Chemical Technology, 3rd edition, vol. 16 page 390. This can<br>
produce LLDPE and HDPE resins in the same type of<br>
equipment.<br>
The loop reactors may be connected in parallel or in<br>
series. In this regard, in a double loop reactor where the<br>
two reactors are connected in series, a high molecular<br>
weight fraction may be produced in the first loop reactor<br>
and a low molecular weight fraction may be produced in the<br><br>
second loop reactor. In this way, a bimodal polymer or a<br>
polymer having a broad molecular weight distribution is<br>
made. In a double loop reactor where the two reactors are<br>
connected in parallel, either a monomodal or a bimodal<br>
product is made.<br>
EP0649860, the contents of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference, describes a process for producing polyethylene<br>
in two liquid full loop reactors, connected in series.<br>
The ethylene is injected with the comonomer in the firs t<br>
loop reactor as well as the catalytic system (i.e. the<br>
catalyst precontacted with the activating agent). Suitable<br>
comonomers, which can be used, include alpha -olefins with<br>
from 3 to 10 atoms of carbon, preferably 1 -hexene.<br>
Polymerisation is done at a t emperature of between 50 and<br>
120°C, preferably between 60 and 110°C, and at a pressure<br>
between 1 and 100 bars, preferably between 30 and 50 bars.<br>
The flow of ethylene polymer obtained in the first reactor<br>
is transferred into the second reactor by means of one or<br>
more settling legs of the first reactor, for example by<br>
using two settling legs (each being filled independently<br>
with the suspension coming from the reactor, the solids<br>
being concentrated by gravity settling and discharge).<br>
In any olefin polymerisation	process, the polyolefin is<br>
produced in the reactor in	the presence of an olefin<br>
polymerisation catalyst. Such	catalysts generally may be<br>
classified into three groups:	metallocene -type catalysts,<br><br>
chromium-type catalysts and Ziegler -Natta-type catalysts.<br>
Typically, the catalyst is used in particulate form. The<br>
polyolefin is produced as a resin/ powder (often referred<br>
to as "fluff") with a hard catalyst particle at the core of<br>
each grain of the powder. The "fluff" is removed from the<br>
reactor and must be extruded before it is sold. Typically,<br>
an extruder works by melting and homogenising the "fluff"<br>
and then forcing it through holes before cutting to form<br>
pellets.<br>
The pellets then may be transformed by subjection to<br>
further processing in applications such as pipe making,<br>
fibre making, and blow-moulding.<br>
In processes where the catalyst used in the olefin<br>
polymerisation is a Ziegler-Natta-type catalyst, the<br>
present inventors have become aware that defects sometimes<br>
are visible in the finished product. In p articular, the<br>
present inventors have become aware that dots or specks<br>
and/or rough patches sometimes are visible on the surface<br>
of a pipe made from pellets of a bimodal product that were<br>
produced using a Ziegler-Natta or metallocene catalyst.<br>
Such defects can make the pipe weaker and can affect the<br>
free flow of liquid through the pipe.<br>
The present inventors have recognised that these defects<br>
likely occur because of homogenisation problems in the<br>
extruder. As such, attempts have been made to try to<br>
prevent or reduce these defects. In particular, efforts<br>
have been concentrated on optimising the specific energy<br><br>
delivered to the extruder. However, this has not proved an<br>
entirely satisfactory solution to the problem.<br>
In view of the above, there remains a need to provide a new<br>
olefin polymerisation process for making polyolefin resin<br>
and, subsequently polyolefin pellets, wherein defects in<br>
any product that is produced from the polyolefin pellets<br>
are prevented or reduced.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention disci oses a process for<br>
polymerising olefin that is carried out in the presence of<br>
a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system in two liquid full loop<br>
reactors connected in series wherein different molecular<br>
weight fractions are produced, characterised in that the<br>
Ziegler-Natta catalyst has a particle size distribution d 50<br>
of less than 20um and greater than 5um.<br>
The present invention also discloses a polyolefin<br>
obtainable by the process according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
The present invention further discloses the use of a<br>
polyolefin formed by the process according to the present<br>
invention for making pipes, particularly for making a water<br>
or gas (such as liquid propane or natural gas) pipe<br>
distribution network.<br>
The present invention yet further discloses a pipe and a<br>
distribution pipe network prepared from the polyolefins of<br>
the present invention.<br><br>
Clearly, in the process according to the present invention,<br>
the catalyst necessarily is in particulate form.<br>
The catalyst's particle size distribution (PSD) d 50 is<br>
measured by laser diffraction analysis on a Malvern type<br>
analyser (Malvern 2000S) after having put the catalyst in<br>
suspension in cyclohexane. The particle size distribution<br>
d50 is defined as the particle size for which fifty percent<br>
by volume of the particles has a size lower than the d50.<br>
The fluff particle size distribution (PSD) d 50 is measured<br>
according to ASTM method D 1921-89 and is defined as the<br>
particle size for which fifty percent by weight of the<br>
particles has a size lower than the d50.<br>
The particle si ze distribution of the catalyst used in the<br>
present process is lower than previously used in olefin<br>
polymerisation processes.<br>
It was expected that by using a smaller catalyst size a<br>
correspondingly smaller resin particle would be obtained.<br>
In this regard, it has been thought previously in this art<br>
that a smaller resin particle size would be disadvantageous<br>
because it in fact was thought that it would be more<br>
difficult to homogenise the resulting polyolefin because<br>
smaller resin grains would not flow as ea sily through the<br>
extruder. It was also expected that smaller resin particles<br>
would result in a lower settling efficiency.<br><br>
By using a smaller catalyst particle size, the size of the<br>
grains in the produced polyolefin resin ("fluff") also is<br>
smaller. This has been found to have the benefit of<br>
improved and easier homogenisation during extrusion because<br>
the "fluff" is able to be made fully molten.<br>
Other advantages of a smaller resin particle size also have<br>
been found unexpectedly. These include:<br>
Improved unit throughput in the process. The smaller<br>
resin particles pack together more efficiently in<br>
the settling legs. This means that less diluent and<br>
more solid resin product is removed per unit volume.<br>
This effect may be attributed to improved "fluff"<br>
bulk density (BD) which gives higher settled "fluff"<br>
mass in the reactor legs (Bulk density is measured<br>
following the method of standard test ASTM D 1895).<br>
-	Comonomer (for example hexene) incorporation is<br>
improved because a lower amount of comonomer is<br>
necessary to obtain an equivalent density.<br>
-	Lower pump power consumption to circulate the solids<br>
in the reactor.<br>
-	Resin product can remain in the reactor for longer.<br>
This is because higher solids levels can be<br>
maintained in the reactor with the same power<br>
consumption on the circulation pump. A higher fluff<br>
residence time enables an improvement in the<br>
catalyst yield. In other words, more product is<br>
produced per kg of catalyst.<br><br>
One way of indirectly measuring the "fluff" bulk density is<br>
by obtaining the ratio of diluent to monomer injected into<br>
the reactor. This is measured at the reactor feeds. As<br>
such, where the diluent is isobutane and the polymer is<br>
polyethylene, a ratio isobutane:ethylene can be obtained as<br>
an indication of the fluff settling efficiency. This rati o<br>
substantially is not effected by decreasing the d 50 of the<br>
catalyst. This is because the lower d 50 of the "fluff" is<br>
compensated by the higher settled "fluff" mass in the<br>
reactor legs (due to an improved "fluff" bulk density).<br>
Also, it has been found t hat the level of fines present in<br>
the "fluff" is not disadvantageously higher when using a<br>
catalyst with a lower d50.<br>
The present inventors have found that when using a smaller<br>
catalyst particle size, the size of the produced resin<br>
particle is not as small as expected. This is because the<br>
resin particle size in fact depends on two factors. These<br>
are: (1) the catalyst particle size and (2) the catalyst<br>
productivity. Unexpectedly, it has been found that<br>
productivity is increased when the catalyst particle is<br>
made smaller. As such, a smaller difference in resin<br>
particle size is observed than was expected (because it was<br>
expected that productivity would remain the same).<br>
To exemplify the increase in productivity, it can be<br>
reported that, previously, 1g of cat alyst (particle size<br>
23µm) produced 5,000-10,000g of resin. It has now been<br>
found that lg of catalyst (particle size 13µm) produces<br><br>
20,000g of resin. As such, the present invention also<br>
provides a process wherein the catalyst has an improved<br>
productivity. Increased productivity means a lower<br>
catalyst cost per unit resin.<br>
Preferably, the catalyst has a d50 of less than 15µm.<br>
Preferably, the catalyst has a d 50 of greater than 8µm.<br>
Most preferably, the catalyst has a d 50 of about 13µm.<br>
Desirably, the polyolefin resin made by the present process<br>
has a particle size distribution of less than 500µm, more<br>
desirably about 400µm. This can be compared with<br>
previously known processes where the polyolefin may have<br>
had a particle size distribution of greater than 600um.<br>
Generally, Ziegler-Natta type catalysts usable in the<br>
present process comprise a transition metal compound<br>
(compound A) of Group IV-VIII (mainly Ti or V) supported on<br>
a carrier. Such catalysts are well known in the art.<br>
Examples of Ziegler-Natta catalysts are TiCl4, TiCl3, VCl4,<br>
VOCl3- An MgCl2 support is preferred.<br>
Preferably, the Ziegler -Natta catalyst comprises from 10 to<br>
18 % Mg by weight and from 3 to 10 % Ti by weight. More<br>
preferably, the Ziegler -Natta catalyst comprises about 13%<br>
Mg by weight and about 7% Ti by weight.<br><br>
It will be understood in the present process that, where<br>
necessary, an activating agent will be needed to activate<br>
the catalyst. Suitable activating agents, where needed, are<br>
well known in this art. Suitable activating agent s include<br>
organometallic or hydride compounds of Group I to III, for<br>
example organo-aluminium compounds such as those of general<br>
formula AlR3, Rµ2AlCl or Rµµ3Al2Cl3 in which R, Rµ, and Ruu<br>
each independently is a hydrocarbon radical, preferably an<br>
alkyl group with 1 to 16 carbon atoms, preferably from 2 to<br>
12 carbon atoms. Suitable activating agents include, for<br>
example Et3Al, Et2AlCl, and (i-Bu)3Al. One preferred<br>
activating agent is triisobutylaluminium.<br>
Typically the polymerisation process will be carried out in<br>
a hydrocarbon diluent. One suitable diluent is isobutane. A<br>
separate catalyst diluent may be required.<br>
Suitable catalyst diluents w ill be known to those skilled<br>
in this art.<br>
Preferably, the present process is used to make an ethylene<br>
or propylene, homopolymer or copolymer.<br>
Also, preferably the present process is used to make a<br>
polymer (for example polyethylene) having a broad mole cular<br>
weight distribution, such as a bimodal polymer such as<br>
bimodal polyethylene. The molecular weight distribution<br>
(MWD) can be fully described by means of the graph obtained<br>
by gel permeation chromatography. However, the molecular<br>
weight distribution can be generally described by a figure<br><br>
which represents the ratio between the mean molecular<br>
weight by weight and the mean molecular weight by number<br>
(the polydispersisity index). Depending on the<br>
applications, the molecular weight distribution required<br>
may vary from 10 to 30, preferably of from 12 to 24.<br>
More preferably, the process is used to make a polymer (for<br>
example polyethylene) having a typical molecular weight<br>
distribution of greater than 15.<br>
Preferably, hydrogen is used to control the molecular<br>
weight of the polymer. A higher pressure of hydrogen leads<br>
to a lower mean molecular weight.<br>
Any suitable reactors can be used,, for example one or more<br>
loop reactors and/or one or more continuously stirred<br>
reactor. Preferably the present process is carr led out in a<br>
two-reactor system wherein at least one reactor is a loop<br>
reactor.<br>
Preferably, the process for producing polyethylene is<br>
carried out in two liquid full loop reactors (a "double<br>
loop" reactor) as referred to above.<br>
In this regard, it is prefe rable that the present process<br>
is carried out in accordance with the process of EP<br>
0649860, as described above.<br>
Preferably a low concentration of hydrogen is maintained in<br>
the first reactor, for instance between 0 and 0.1% by<br><br>
volume, and a high concentrat ion of hydrogen in the second<br>
reactor, for instance between 0.5 and 2.4% by volume.<br>
Where a double loop reactor is used, preferably the<br>
polymers formed in the first reactor have an HLMI (high<br>
load melt index according to ASTM standard D1238,<br>
190°C/21.6 kg) between 0.01 and 5 grams per 10' preferably<br>
between 0.1 and 2 grams per 10'. Preferably, the final<br>
polymers have an HLMI higher than 5 grams per 10' .<br>
The properties of the resin are however selected according<br>
to the end use of the polymer. Typical prop erties of resins<br>
suitable respectively for pipe, blow-moulding or film<br>
applications are summarised in Table 1<br><br><br>
MI2, MI5 and HLMI are measured following the methods of<br>
standard test ASTM D 1238 at a temperature of 190 °C and<br>
under a load respectively of 2.16 kg, 5 kg and 21.6 kg.<br>
A preferred reaction temperature range in the present<br>
process may be said to be from 60 to 120, more preferably<br>
from 75 to 100°C.<br>
A preferred applied pressure range may be said to be from<br>
30 to 55 bars, more preferably from 40 to 50 bars.<br>
The reactor pressure to some extent controls the quantity<br>
of slurry that is taken out of the reactor.<br>
One embodiment of a "double loop" reactor process can be<br>
described as follows:<br>
-The process is a continuous process. A monomer (e.g.<br>
ethylene polymerises in a liquid diluent (e.g. isobutane)<br>
in the presence of a comonomer (e.g. hexene), hydrogen,<br>
catalyst, activating agent and anti-fouling agent. The<br>
slurry is maintained in circulation by an axial pump<br>
consisting in a reactor essentially of vertical jacketed<br>
pipe sections connected by trough elbows. The<br>
polymerisation heat is extracted by a water -cooling jacket.<br>
The reactor line includes two reactors that can be used in<br>
parallel or in series. The approximate volume of the<br>
reactors may be about 100m3.<br>
-The product (e.g. polyethylene) is taken out of the<br>
reactor with some diluent through settling legs and<br><br>
discontinuous discharge valves. A small fraction of the<br>
total circulating flow is withdrawn. It is moved to a<br>
polymer degassing section in which the solid content is<br>
increased.<br>
-While being depressurised, the slurry is transferred<br>
through heated flash lines to a flash tank. In the flash<br>
tank, the product and diluent are separated. The degassing<br>
is completed in a purge column.<br>
-The powder product is transported under nitrogen to fluff<br>
silos and extruded into pellets along with some specific<br>
additives. A pellet treatment unit comprising silos and hot<br>
and cool air flow allows the removal of residual components<br>
from the pellets. The pellets then are directed to<br>
homogenisation silos before final storage.<br>
-The gas coming out from the flash tank and from the purge<br>
column is treated in a distillation section. This allows<br>
the separate recovery of diluent, monomer and comonomer.<br>
-This embodiment of the double loop reactor process in fact<br>
would be usable with chromium type, Ziegler -Natta type or<br>
indeed metallocene catalysts. Each catalyst type would have<br>
a specific injection system.<br>
Examples and Experiments<br><br>
An evaluation was carried out in order to compare a<br>
catalyst having a particle size distribution d50 of 23µm<br>
with a catalyst having a particle size distribution d50 of<br>
13µm.<br>
The evaluation was carried out in a double loop reactor and<br>
was divided into four time frames as explained below:<br>

catalyst in a "double loop" reactor.<br>

maximal reactor throughput.<br>
IV.	Polyethylene production using standard 23um<br>
catalyst.<br><br>

Experimental Detail<br>
The conditions have been adjusted to obtain equivalent<br>
Reactor 1 melt index and reactor ratio for the 13um and<br>
23pm catalysts. (See Figure 1, Figure 2 &amp; Figure 3).<br>
Influence of fluff morphology on reactor throughput<br>
The particle size distribution (PSD) of 13 -µm and 23-µm<br>
catalysts are given in Figure 4. The polyethylene fluff PSD<br>
was lower when the 13µm catalyst was us ed (See Figure 5) .<br>
The d50 is reduced from about 625 µm down to 400 µm. The<br>
higher span [ (d90 - d10)/d50] is due to the lower d50, the PSD<br>
broadness being about the same (See Figure 6).<br>
Figure 7 shows that the 13um catalyst generates a smaller<br>
quantity of large fluff particles (about 1% instead of 6 -<br>
8 % using 23 µm catalyst) but produces the same quantity of<br><br>
fines (bottom and 63 µm sieves) • This fluff morphology<br>
should be advantageous, when the product is used in pipe -<br>
making, for the improvement of the inner aspect of the pipe<br>
product.<br>
Despite the lower fluff d50 coming from the 13µm catalyst,<br>
the reactor throughput was maintained due to a significant<br>
improvement of the bulk density observed in Reactor 1 and<br>
Reactor 2 (see Figure 8 and Figure 9) . This higher bulk<br>
density had an important impact on the settling efficiency.<br>
It was observed that:<br>
-	Owing to the lower pump power consumption for the<br>
lower fluff particle size using 13 -µm catalyst, it<br>
was possible to raise the solids content in Reactor<br>
1 and, in this way, increase the solids residence<br>
time (See Figure 10 and Figure 11) and thus the<br>
productivity.<br>
The 13um catalyst has the same hydrogen response as<br>
the 23µm catalyst whereas the comonomer<br>
incorporation of the 13µm catalyst is better than<br>
that of the 23µm catalyst.<br>
Taking into account the solids residence time and<br>
the ethylene off-gas, the activity of 13-µm catalyst<br>
is 20 - 30% higher to the activity of 23 -µm catalyst<br>
(See Figure 12).<br>
-	The molecular weight distribution is the same for<br>
both catalyst grain sizes.<br>
-	Despite the lower fluff d50 (400 µm instead of 625<br>
µm), the reactor throughput was not penalised thanks<br><br>
to the improvement of fluff bulk density (+0.04)<br>
generating good settling and high solids in both<br>
reactors.<br>
The lower fluff d50 is due to a lower amount of big<br>
particles {1000 µm), the amount of fines (
being the same or even lower. This is interesting in<br>
terms of settling efficiency and pipe aspect.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A process for polymerising olefins in two liquid full<br>
loop reactors connected in series wherein different<br>
molecular weight fractions are produced in the presence of<br>
a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system, characterised in that the<br>
Ziegler-Natta catalyst has a particle size distribution d50<br>
of less than 20µm and greater than 8µm.<br>
2.	A process according to claim 1, wherein the Ziegler-<br>
Natta catalyst has a d50 of less than 15µm.<br>
3.	A process according to any one of the preceding<br>
claims, wherein the Ziegler-Natta catalyst has a d50 of<br>
about 13µm.<br>
4.	A process according to any one of the preceding<br>
claims, wherein the present process is used to form a<br>
polyethylene.<br>
5.	A process according to claim 4, wherein the process is<br>
used to make a polyethylene having a typical molecular<br>
weight distribution of greater than 15.<br>
6.	A process according to any one of the preceding claims<br>
wherein the ethylene is injected with a comonomer in the<br>
first liquid full loop reactor and the comonomer comprises<br>
an alpha-olefin having from 3 to 10 atoms of carbon.<br><br>
7. A process according to any one of the preceding<br>
claims, wherein the formed polyolefin is extruded to form<br>
pellets.<br><br><br>
The invention discloses a process for polymerising olefins<br>
in two liquid full loop reactors connected in series<br>
wherein different molecular weight fractions are produced<br>
in the presence of a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system,<br>
characterised in that the Ziegler-Natta catalyst has a<br>
particle size distribution d50 of less than 20µm and greater<br>
than 8µm.<br></td>
