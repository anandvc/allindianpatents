				<td>Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to in situ turning machine for rolls in coke crusher<br>
system. More particularly it relates to the in situ turning machine comprising plurality<br>
of means including means for providing stepless variable speed feed such that the<br>
turning machine is adapted to maintain the evenness of the surfaces of rolls, improve<br>
the crushing index of coke involving much lesser time and to prevent loss of<br>
manpower thus improving the availability of operation and thereby tonnage crushed.<br>
Background of invention<br>
In the raw material handling plant lumped size of cokes are crushed in the<br>
conventional twin roll crushers. The crusher consists of steel welded frame for<br>
mounting fixed and floating rolls, two hydraulic cylinders for roll setting, cover and an<br>
integrated out feed chute for further guiding of the material. One stationary roll and<br>
one floating roll are located on the crusher frame with spherical bearings in bearing<br>
housings. The hydraulic adjustment of the floating roll is done through two<br>
horizontally arranged cylinders and the guide slide makes the movement between the<br>
frame and bearing housings of floating rolls possible. The two movable 45 KW drive<br>
units consisting of the shifting frame with eye type bearing, driving seesaw, driving<br>
frame, three phase AC motor and pulley are bedded in the building construction.<br>
Maintaining rolls exactly cylindrical in shape and mark free is precondition for<br>
ensuring uniform roll gap over the entire roll width on which ultimately quality of the<br>
material prepared at roll crusher depends. The shells of the rolls wear out during<br>
crushing with the wear being non-uniform along the width of the rolls i.e. more in the<br>
center and less at the periphery. For machining worn out shells of the rolls, the<br>
practice at raw material handling plant is sending the rolls to central machine shop for<br>
turning them on lathe.<br>
The shape of the slide ways used for guiding carriage in the conventional lathe<br>
machine is flat. No cylindrical slide ways or guides are found in the conventional lathe<br>
or turning machines. There is no arrangement for step less variable speed drive, in<br>
lathe, which would ensure high precision in the movement of the tool. Also beds of<br>
the conventional lathe machines are not made of steel plates. The pedestal of the<br>
conventional lathe or turning machine being made of cast iron is heavy and has<br>
inferior elastic limit.<br>
Drawbacks of known art<br>
The main disadvantage of the present practice is that the rolls wear out faster than<br>
they can be replaced producing inferior quality of crushed coke.<br>
Another disadvantage of the present practice is that for machining worn out shells of<br>
the rolls are being sent to the central machine shop for turning them on lathe which is<br>
both time consuming and also involves a lot of manpower and logistic support.<br>
One further disadvantage of the present practice is that during dismantling and<br>
removal or re-fixing of rolls the equipment may be damaged.<br>
Thus there is a need to provide for a highly precise in situ turning machine for twin-<br>
roll of coke crusher which would improve the crushing index of coke as well as<br>
prevent frequent dismantling and removal for machining of worn out shells of the rolls<br>
thus making the crushing operation both cost-effective and less time consuming.<br>
Object of invention<br>
The basic object of the present invention is to provide a high precision in situ turning<br>
machine for twin-roll of coke crusher for improving the crushing index of coke to a<br>
product size of 90% less than 3 mm.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for an in situ turning machine,<br>
adapted for decreasing downtime of the crusher due to roll turning/roll replacement.<br>
One further object of the present invention is to provide for an in situ turning machine<br>
adapted for improved availability of operation leading to increased tonnage of coke<br>
crushed.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for an in situ turning machine<br>
adapted to prevent the damage of the equipment by reducing the chance of frequent<br>
dismantling and removal or re-fixing of the shells of the rolls.<br>
One more object of the present invention is to provide an in situ turning machine<br>
adapted to maintain the rolls in proper shape and mark free having roller material<br>
with hardness of about 350-400 Brinell Hardness Number (BHN).<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide for an in situ turning machine<br>
adapted to provide a high precision turning operation with a tool feed as low as 0.1<br>
mm per revolution.<br>
The other object of the present invention is to provide for an in situ turning machine<br>
adapted to provide minimum vibration of the machine during turning operation.<br>
Summary of invention<br>
Thus according to the main aspect of the present invention there is provided an<br>
improved in situ turning machine for rolls in coke crusher system adapted to increase<br>
the crushing index of the crushed material; the said in situ turning machine<br>
comprising:<br>
i) pedestal formed of material with high elastic limit and mechanical<br>
properties bearing the turning machine;<br>
ii) stationary cylindrical shaft;<br>
iii) means located along the length of the said shaft and adapted to guide<br>
reciprocation movement of a carriage;<br>
iv) means adapted to achieve stepless variable speed feed;<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The turning machine comprises of auxiliaries like roll drive and feed drive, turning<br>
mechanism and the torsion free pedestal fastened to the frame of the coke crusher<br>
system. The turning machine of the present invention is bolted on pedestal made of<br>
steel, which is welded of carbon steel plates. Since, the elastic limit and mechanical<br>
properties of carbon steel are much higher than those of ordinary cast iron the<br>
pedestal provided in the present invention is much lighter and able to withstand<br>
greater amount of force and torque without changing its original configuration.<br>
Sufficient large number of stiffening ribs and partitions are provided in the pedestal<br>
dividing it into number of compartments. This provides rigidity that is required to<br>
sustain the cutting forces arising due to the turning operation. The rigidity of the<br>
aforesaid parts ensures precision in turning operation achieved by the in situ turning<br>
machine of the present invention.<br>
During turning as achieved by the machine of present invention, the belt pulley<br>
mechanically coupled to the dedicated geared motor drives the roll. Cutting speed is<br>
maintained at 10 rpm. The center-to-center distance of roll pulley and motor pulley is<br>
such that the same belts are used during crushing and machining by simple change<br>
over. The means for providing rotation to the rolls of diameters 1000 and length 1000<br>
mm comprises auxiliary drive adapted to rotate the roller at desired speeds according<br>
to need of turning operation. Another geared motor is provided which serves as feed<br>
drive. This geared motor in conjunction with variable-voltage-variable-frequency drive<br>
(VVVF) and lead screw-nut comprises means adapted to achieve stepless variable<br>
speed feed. This stepless variable speed feed drive is compact and allows easy and<br>
smooth speed changing without stopping the machine. The variable-voltage-variable-<br>
frequency (VVVF) drive provides tool feed as low as 0.1 mm/rev. Limit switches are<br>
provided on two ends of the bearing blocks to protect over travel of the carriage. The<br>
limit switches are interlocked with VVVF drive, which stops after the striker arm hits<br>
the limit switches.<br>
The turning machine comprises a number of precisely machined parts. The<br>
stationary cylindrical shaft of diameter 190 mm. is provided in the turning machine.<br>
The shaft is supported by bearing blocks and serves as guide for the carriage<br>
holding the cutting tool. The means located along the length of the said shaft and<br>
adapted to guide reciprocation movement of the carriage comprises prismatic key in<br>
the key groove along the length of the shaft. The key on bearing housing prevents<br>
the shaft from rotation. The lead screw is nested in another groove and supported by<br>
bearings fastened to the flat ends of the guiding shaft. The geared motor with power<br>
rating of 2 hp (horsepower) in electrical combination with variable-voltage-variable-<br>
frequency (VVVF) drives the lead screw. The hand wheel drives the lead screw<br>
manually. The plurality of sliders comprise cross feed slide. This in conjunction with<br>
the hand operated crank is adapted to move the cross rest along with the tool holder.<br>
Cutting feed is adjusted manually by the hand operated crank with lead screw nut<br>
arrangement. The cross feed slide comprises lower slide and the upper slide, both<br>
machined as dove tail. The upper slide with tool holder is moved along the lower<br>
slide with the help of the crank handle. The nut provided in the lead screw nut<br>
arrangement is fastened to upper sliding carriage allows adjustable feed for the<br>
cutting tool. Wedge is adapted for providing clearance between the slides. Cutting<br>
tool is clamped to the carriage by pressure plate.<br>
