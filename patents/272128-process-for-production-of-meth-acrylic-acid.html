Technical Field<br>
5        The present invention relates to a Mo-Bi-Nb-Te<br>
based composite metal oxide, and a process for producing<br>
(meth) acrylic acid from propylene or the like by using<br>
the  Mo-Bi-Nb-Te  based  composite  metal  oxide  as  a<br>
catalyst.  Also,  the present  invention  relates  to  a<br>
10 process for producing (meth)acrylic acid comprising a<br>
first step of producing (meth)acrolein as a main product<br>
from propylene or the like, and a second step of<br>
producing (meth)acrylic acid from the (meth)acrolein,<br>
wherein the yield of (meth)acrylic acid in the product<br>
15  of the first step is 20 mole% or higher.<br>
Background Art<br>
A process for producing an unsaturated fatty acid<br>
from an olefin by way of an unsaturated aldehyde is a<br>
20 typical process of catalytic vapor phase oxidation. To<br>
perform partial oxidation of olefins, composite oxides<br>
containing molybdenum and bismuth, molybdenum and<br>
vanadium, or mixtures thereof are used as catalysts.<br>
Particular  examples  of  such  catalytic  vapor  phase<br>
25 oxidation include a process of producing (meth)acrylic<br>
acid by the oxidation of propylene or isobutylene by way<br>
of (meth)acrolein, a process of producing phthalic<br>
anhydride by the oxidation of naphthalene or<br>
orthoxylene, and a process of producing maleic anhydride<br>
30 by the partial oxidation of benzene, butylene or<br>
butadiene.<br>
Generally, (meth)acrylic acid, a final product, is<br>
produced from at least one reaction material selected<br>
from  the  group  consisting  of  propylene,  propane,<br>
35  isobutylene,  t-butyl alcohol  or methyl-t-butyl  ether<br><br>
(referred to as ^propylene or the like' , hereinafter) by<br>
a two-step process of vapor phase catalytic partial<br>
oxidation.    More  particularly,  in  the  first  step,<br>
propylene or the like is oxidized by oxygen, inert gas<br>
for dilution,  water steam and a certain amount of a<br>
catalyst,  so as to produce  (meth) acrolein as a main<br>
product. Then, in the second step, the (meth)acrolein is<br>
oxidized by oxygen, inert gas for dilution, water steam<br>
and a certain amount of a catalyst, so as to produce<br>
(meth)acrylic acid.  The catalyst used in the first step<br>
is a Mo-Bi-based multinary metal oxide, which oxidizes<br>
propylene or the like to produce (meth)acrolein as a<br>
main product.   Also,  some  acrolein  is  continuously<br>
oxidized on  the  same  catalyst  to  partially produce<br>
(meth)acrylic acid.  The catalyst used in the second step<br>
is a Mo-V-based multinary metal oxide,  which mainly<br>
oxidizes (meth)acrolein in the mixed gas containing the<br>
(meth)acrolein produced from the first step to produce<br>
(meth)acrylic acid as a main product.<br>
A reactor for performing the aforementioned<br>
process is provided either in such a manner that both<br>
the two-steps can be performed in one system, or in such<br>
a manner that the two steps can be performed in<br>
different systems.<br>
As mentioned hereinbefore, the first-step catalyst<br>
involved in vapor phase partial oxidation using<br>
propylene or the like as a starting material is a<br>
multinary metal oxide, with which (meth)acrolein is<br>
produced as a main product and at most 10% of<br>
(meth)acrylic acid is produced.<br>
As disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent No.<br>
Hei8-3093, a conventional first-step catalyst is a<br>
composite oxide represented by the formula of Moa-Bib-<br>
Fec-Ad-Be-Cf-Dg-Ox, wherein Mo, Bi and Fe represent<br>
molybdenum, bismuth and iron, respectively; A is nickel<br><br>
and/or cobalt; B is at least one element selected from<br>
the group consisting of manganese, zinc, calcium,<br>
magnesium, tin and lead; C is at least one element<br>
selected from the group consisting of phosphorus, boron,<br>
arsenic, Group 6B elements in the Periodic Table,<br>
tungsten, antimony and silicon; D is at least one<br>
element selected from the group consisting of potassium,<br>
rubidium, cesium and thallium; each of a, b, c, e, f and<br>
g is a number satisfying the conditions of  0<b></b>
0<c l and when a="12;&lt;br/">
and x is a value defined by the oxidation state of each<br>
element. When vapor phase catalytic oxidation of<br>
propylene is performed with molecular oxygen by using<br>
the above first-step catalyst and by operating the<br>
first-step catalyst layer at a temperature of 325°C,<br>
acrolein is produced with a yield of 81.3% and acrylic<br>
acid is produced with a yield of 11%. In other words,<br>
acrylic acid content is low in the reaction product<br>
obtained by using the first-step catalyst.<br>
Meanwhile, Japanese Laid-Open Patent No. Hei5-<br>
293389 discloses a catalyst represented by the formula<br>
of MOaBibFecAdXeYfZgSih0i, wherein Mo, Bi, Fe, Si and 0<br>
represent molybdenum, bismuth, iron, silicon and oxygen,<br>
respectively; A is at least one element selected from<br>
the group consisting of cobalt and nickel; X is at least<br>
one element selected from the group consisting of<br>
magnesium, zinc, manganese, calcium, chrome, niobium,<br>
silver, barium, tin, tantalum and lead; Y is at least<br>
one element selected from the group consisting of<br>
phosphorus, boron, sulfur, selenium, Group 6B elements<br>
in the Periodic Table, cerium,' tungsten, antimony and<br>
titanium; Z is at least one element selected from the<br>
group consisting of lithium, sodium, potassium,<br>
rubidium, cesium and thallium; and each of a, b, c, d,<br><br>
e, f, g, h and i represents the atomic ratio of each<br>
element, with the proviso that when a=12, b= 0.01 — 3,<br>
c=0.01~5, d=l~12, e=0~6, f=0~5, g=0.001-1,<br>
h=0~20, and i is the oxygen atom number needed to<br>
satisfy the atomic valence of each element. When vapor<br>
phase catalytic oxidation of propylene is performed by<br>
using the above first-step catalyst to produce acrolein<br>
and acrylic acid, acrylic acid is produced with a yield<br>
of 6.2 mole% under a propylene conversion ratio of 99.1<br>
mole% and an acrolein selectivity of 89.6 mole%. In<br>
other words, acrylic acid content is still low in the<br>
reaction product obtained by using the first-step<br>
catalyst.<br>
In a process for producing (meth)acrylic acid, the<br>
temperature of the second-step catalyst layer varies<br>
depending on the selectivity of (meth) acrolein and<br>
(meth)acrylic acid (i.e. the first-step catalytic<br>
reaction product) and the amount of (meth)acrolein<br>
unreacted in' the second-step catalytic reaction. The<br>
second-step catalyst layer is operated in such a manner<br>
that unreacted (meth)acrolein can be minimized. When<br>
(meth)acrolein selectivity is high in the first-step<br>
catalytic reaction product, the second-step catalyst<br>
layer is subjected to an increased load and<br>
concentration, resulting in an increase in reaction<br>
temperature and degradation of the lifetime of the<br>
catalyst. Additionally, when a concentration of<br>
unreacted (meth)acrolein is increased due . to the<br>
degradation in catalytic activity, a waste gas<br>
incineration system (WGIS) may be overloaded, resulting<br>
in degradation of the lifetime of a waste gas treating<br>
catalyst.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made in<br><br>
view of the above-mentioned problems. The inventors of<br>
the present invention have found that when a Mo-Bi-Nb-Te<br>
based composite metal oxide is used as the first-step<br>
catalyst in the production of (meth)acrylic acid from<br>
propylene or the like, yield and/or selectivity of<br>
(meth)acrylic acid increases in the first-step reaction<br>
product, and thus (meth)acrolein load and concentration<br>
decrease in the second-step to such a degree that<br>
(meth)acrolein conversion ratio can reach 100%. The<br>
present invention is based on this finding.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a Mo-Bi-Nb-Te based composite metal<br>
oxide.<br>
According to another aspect of the present<br>
invention, there is provided a process for producing<br>
(meth)acrylic acid from at least one reaction material<br>
selected from the group consisting of propylene,<br>
propane, isobutylene, t-butyl alcohol and methyl-t-butyl<br>
ether by using a Mo-Bi-Nb-Te based composite metal oxide<br>
as a catalyst.<br>
According to still another aspect of the present<br>
invention, there is provided a process for producing<br>
(meth)acrylic acid comprising a first step of producing<br>
(meth) acrolein as a main product from at least one<br>
reaction material selected from the group consisting of<br>
propylene,  propane,  isobutylene,  t-butyl  alcohol  and<br>
methyl-t-butyl ether, and a second step of producing<br>
(meth)acrylic  acid  from  the  (meth)acrolein,  wherein<br>
yield of (meth) acrylic acid in the product of the first<br>
step is 20 mole% or higher.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will. be<br>
explained in more detail.<br>
Mo-Bi-based first-step metal oxide catalysts for<br>
producing (meth)acrolein from propylene or the like,<br>
which have been disclosed to date, generally provide a<br><br>
conversion ratio (selectivity) from propylene or the<br>
like to (meth) acrolein and (meth) acrylic acid of about<br>
90% or more, wherein the molar ratio of (meth)acrolein<br>
to (meth)acrylic acid in the first-step reaction product<br>
is about 9:1. Additionally, when the first-step reaction<br>
product is subjected to the second-step reaction, it is<br>
possible to obtain a (meth)acrolein conversion ratio of<br>
about 98%.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have found<br>
that when a Mo-Bi-based composite oxide also containing<br>
both Nb and Te, i.e. a Mo-Bi-Nb-Te based composite metal<br>
oxide is prepared and used as the first-step reaction<br>
catalyst, it is possible to obtain a conversion ratio<br>
(selectivity) of (meth)acrolein and (meth)acrylic acid<br>
from propylene or the like of 90% or more, as well as a<br>
molar ratio of (meth)acrolein to (meth)acrylic acid in<br>
the  first-step  reaction  product  of  approximately<br>
8:2-7:3.<br>
Additionally, the inventors of the present<br>
invention have found that use of a Mo-Bi-Nb-Te based<br>
composite metal oxide as the first-step catalyst<br>
provides a decreased selectivity of (meth)acrolein in<br>
the first-step reaction product and an increased<br>
selectivity of (meth)acrylic acid as mentioned above,<br>
and thus the second-step reaction is subjected to a<br>
decreased load and concentration of (meth)acrolein as a<br>
reactant, so that the second-step reaction can provide a<br>
(meth)acrolein conversion ratio of 100% after the<br>
completion of the reaction.<br>
Further, according to the present invention, since<br>
selectivity  of  (meth)acrylic  acid  increases  from<br>
(meth)acrolein and (meth)acrylic acid, which are the<br>
main reaction products that have passed through the<br>
first-step    catalyst,    complete    conversion    of<br><br>
(meth)acrolein can be accomplished in the subsequent<br>
second-step catalytic reaction step. Hence, it is<br>
possible to operate the overall process under a high<br>
load and concentration so as to provide a high yield,<br>
and to improve the lifetime of the second-step catalyst.<br>
In brief, the present invention is based on the<br>
fact that a Mo-Bi-Nb-Te based composite metal oxide,<br>
used as the first-step reaction catalyst in a process<br>
for producing (meth)acrylic acid from propylene or the<br>
like, provides a lower (meth)acrolein selectivity and a<br>
higher (meth)acrylic acid selectivity in the first-step<br>
reaction product, when compared to other conventional<br>
Mo-Bi metal oxides currently used as the first-step<br>
catalyst.<br>
(1) Preferably, the Mo-Bi-Nb-Te based composite<br>
metal oxide according to the present invention is a<br>
composite metal oxide represented by the following<br>
Formula 1:<br>
[ Formula 1]<br>

each of a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j and k<br>
represents the atomic ratio of each element;<br>
wherein when a=12, b is 0.01-20, c is 0.001-20, d<br>
is 0.001-20, e is 0-15, f is 0-20, g is 0-20, h is 0-10,<br>
i is 0-10, j is 0-10, and k is a number defined by the<br>
oxidation state of each of the above elements.<br>
When used as a catalyst, the Mo-Bi-Nb-Te based<br>
composite metal oxide according to the present invention<br>
may be used alone or may be supported on an inert<br>
carrier. Particular examples of the carrier that may be<br>
used in the present invention include porous or non-<br>
porous alumina, silica-alumina, silicon carbide, '<br>
titanium dioxide, magnesium oxide, aluminum sponge, or<br>
the like. Additionally, the carrier may take a<br>
cylindrical shape, a hollow cylindrical shape or a<br>
spherical shape, but is not limited thereto. For<br>
example, a catalyst having a cylindrical shape<br>
preferably has a ratio of length to diameter  (outer<br>
diameter) (L/D ratio) of 1~ 1.3, and more -preferably has<br>
a L/D ratio of 1. A catalyst having a cylindrical or<br>
spherical  shape preferably has  an outer diameter of<br>
3~ 10mm, more preferably of 5~ 8mm.<br>
The Mo-Bi-Nb-Te based composite metal oxide<br>
according to the present invention may be prepared by a<br>
conventional method for producing a composite metal<br>
oxide, except that a different composition of elements<br>
is used.	'<br>
There is no particular limitation in the shape of<br>
a metal precursor forming the Mo-Bi-Nb-Te based<br>
composite metal oxide. For example, a compound that is<br>
provided originally in the form of an oxide or can be<br>
converted into an oxide by heating (i.e. calcination) at<br>
least in the presence of oxygen, for example,<br>
halogenide, nitride, formate, oxalate, citrate, acetate,<br><br>
carbonate, amine complex, ammonium salt and/or hydroxide<br>
may be used as a starting material.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the method for preparing the composite metal<br>
oxide comprises the steps of: dissolving or dispersing a<br>
predetermined amount (stoichiometric amount) of each<br>
starting material containing each element forming the<br>
composite metal oxide into an aqueous medium; heating<br>
the resultant solution or dispersion while stirring it;<br>
allowing the system to evaporate to obtain a dry solid<br>
and drying and pulverizing the solid; and molding the<br>
powder into a desired shape via extrusion molding to<br>
obtain tablets or granules. In this case, glass fibers<br>
and inorganic fibers including various kinds of<br>
whiskers, which are known to improve the strength and<br>
frictional resistance, may be further added.<br>
Additionally, in order to control the properties of the<br>
catalyst and to obtain excellent reproducibility, other<br>
additives known as powder binders, such as ammonium<br>
nitrate, cellulose, starch, polyvinyl alcohol, stearic<br>
acid, or the like, may be used.<br>
The composite metal oxide catalyst according to<br>
the present invention may be obtained by calcining the<br>
molded product obtained as described above or the same<br>
product supported on a carrier under a flow of 0.2~ 2m/s<br>
at 300~ 600°C for about i~ 10 hours. The calcination step<br>
may be performed under an inert gas atmosphere, an<br>
oxidative atmosphere, for example, air (a mixture of<br>
inert gas and oxygen), or a reductive atmosphere (e.g.,<br>
a mixture of inert gas, oxygen and NH3, CO and/or H2) .<br>
The calcination step may be performed for a period of<br>
several minutes to several hours, and the calcination<br>
period generally decreases as the temperature increases.<br>
(2)  The Mo-Bi-Nb-Te based composite metal oxide<br><br>
according to the present invention may be used as a<br>
catalyst to produce (meth)acrylic acid from at least one<br>
reactant selected from the group consisting of<br>
propylene, propane, isobutylene, t-butyl alcohol, and<br>
metyl-t-butyl ether. In this case, conversion<br>
(selectivity) from propylene or the like into<br>
(meth)acrolein and (meth)acrylic acid may be<br>
accomplished at a ratio of 90% or more, and the molar<br>
ratio  of  (meth)acrolein:(meth)acrylic  acid  in  the<br>
reaction product is approximately 8:2~ 7:3.<br>
Particularly, the Mo-Bi-Nb-Te based composite<br>
metal oxide according to the present invention may be<br>
used as a catalyst for the first-step partial oxidation<br>
in a process for producing (meth)acrylic acid from a<br>
reaction material such as propylene or the like, the<br>
process   comprising  a   first   step   for  producing<br>
(meth)acrolein as a main product from the reactants such<br>
as propylene or the like and a second step for producing<br>
(meth)acrylic acid from the (meth)acrolein.<br>
When vapor phase catalytic oxidation is carried<br>
out by using the Mo-Bi-Nb-Te based composite metal oxide<br>
according to the present invention as a catalyst, there<br>
is no particular limitation in systems and operation<br>
conditions thereof used in the process. Reactors that<br>
may be used in the present invention include<br>
conventional fixed-bed, fluidized-bed and moving-bed<br>
reactors.  For  example,  the  process  for  producing<br>
(meth)acrylic acid may be performed in a shell-and-tube<br>
reactor and the Mo-Bi-Nb-Te based composite metal oxide<br>
according to the present invention may be packed in a<br>
reaction tube so as to be used as a first-step fixed bed<br>
catalyst. Herein, as a second-step catalyst, Mo-V-based<br>
multinary  metal  oxide  may  be  used  to  oxidize<br>
(meth)acrolein-containing mixed product gas generated by<br><br>
the first-step Mo-Bi-Nb-Te based composite metal oxide<br>
catalyst, thereby producing (meth)acrylic acid.<br>
To perform the reaction, reaction conditions,<br>
which are generally adopted for producing (meth)acrylic<br>
acid and (meth)acrolein from a reaction material such as<br>
propylene or the like via vapor phase catalytic<br>
oxidation, may be used. For example, a gas mixture as a<br>
starting material,  which contains 7 vol% or more of<br>
reactants such as propylene or the like, 10- 13 vol% of<br>
molecular oxygen and 60~ 80 vol% of inert gas functioning<br>
as a diluent (e.g. nitrogen, carbon dioxide, steam, or<br>
the like), is caused to be in contact with the catalyst<br>
according to the present invention, at a temperature of<br>
250~ 500°C under a pressure of 0.1- 3 kg/cm2G with a space<br>
velocity of 300- 5000hr_1 (STP) to carry out a desired<br>
reaction.<br>
The  second-step  catalytic  reaction  is  suitably<br>
carried out at a reaction temperature of 200- 450°C,<br>
preferably of 265- 370CC, under a reaction pressure of<br>
0.1- 10 atm, preferably of 0.5-3 atm. For example, a<br>
feed gas as reactants, which contains 4- 10 vol% of<br>
(meth) acrolein, 10- 13 vol% of oxygen, 5- 60 vol% of<br>
water steam and 20- 80 vol% of inert gas, is introduced<br>
onto the catalyst with a space velocity of 500- 5000hr-1<br>
(STP) to perform oxidation.<br>
(3)  Further,  the  present  invention provides  a<br><br>
process for producing (meth)acrylic acid comprising a<br>
first step of producing (meth)acrolein as a main product<br>
from propylene or the like, and a second step of<br>
producing (meth)acrylic acid from the (meth)acrolein,<br>
wherein yield of (meth)acrylic acid in the product of<br>
the first step is 20 mole% or higher.<br>
The yield as high as 20 mol% of (meth)acrylic acid<br>
in the first-step reaction product can be accomplished<br>
by using the Mo-Bi-Nb-Te based composite metal oxide<br>
according to the present invention as the first-step<br>
catalyst.<br>
Meanwhile, when (meth)acrylic acid is produced<br>
with a yield of 20 mole% or higher in the first-step<br>
reaction product, it is possible to obtain a conversion<br>
ratio of (meth)acrolein of 98~ 100%, preferably 100%, in<br>
the  second-step  reaction.  Herein,  the  (meth)acrolein<br>
conversion ratio as high as 98- 100% also depends on the<br>
content of propylene or the like in the reaction mixture<br>
introduced to the first-step. Preferably, propylene or<br>
the like is contained in the reaction mixture gas<br>
introduced into the first-step reaction in an amount of<br>
7~ 10 vol% in order to accomplish a (meth)acrolein<br>
conversion ratio of 100%.<br>

First, 2500 ml of distilled water was heated and<br><br>
stirred at 70°C~ 85°C and lOOOg of ammonium molybdate was<br>
added thereto to form solution (1). Next, 274g of<br>
bismuth nitrate, 228g of ferrous nitrate and 2. 3g of<br>
potassium nitrate were added to 400ml of distilled<br>
water, the materials were mixed thoroughly, 71g of<br>
nitric acid was added thereto, and the materials were<br>
dissolved sufficiently to form solution (2). To 200ml of<br>
distilled water, 686g of cobalt nitrate was dissolved to<br>
form solution (3). After mixing solution (2) with<br>
solution (3), the mixed solution was further mixed with<br>
solution  (1)  while  maintaining  the  temperature  at<br>
40~ 60°C to provide a catalyst suspension.<br>
The catalyst suspension was dried to produce<br>
M012Bi1.2Fe1.2C05Ko.05 and the catalyst was pulverized into a<br>
size of 150fim or less. The resultant catalyst powder was<br>
mixed for 2 hours and formed into a cylindrical shape.<br>
The catalyst was formed to have an outer diameter of<br>
4.0~ 8.0mm, and calcined at 500CC for 5 hours under the<br>
air, and then the catalytic activity was verified.<br>
Preparation Example 2: Catalyst 2<br>
Catalyst 2 was provided in the same manner as<br>
described in Preparation Example 1, except that 63g of<br>
niobium chloride and 150g of tellurium chloride were ■<br>
further added to form solution (1). The catalyst had the<br>
elemental composition", of M012Nbo.5Te1Bi1.2Fe1.2C05Ko.05 except<br>
oxygen.<br>
Preparation Example 3: Catalyst 3<br>

niobium chloride and 150g of tellurium nitrate were<br>
further added to form solution (1). The catalyst had the<br>
elemental  composition  of  Mo12Nb1.0Te1.0Bi1.2Fe1.2Co4.5K0.05<br><br>
except oxygen.<br>
Preparation Example 4: Catalyst 4<br>
Catalyst 4 was provided in the same manner as<br>
described in Preparation Example 1, except that 63g of<br>
niobium chloride and 75g of tellurium chloride were<br>
further added to form solution (1). The catalyst had the<br>
elemental composition of Mo12Nbo.5Te1Bi1.2Fe1.2Co4.5Ko.05<br>
except oxygen.<br>
Preparation Example 5: Catalyst 5<br>
First, 2000 ml of distilled water was heated and<br>
stirred at 100°C and 246g of ammonium tungstate, lOOOg of<br>
ammonium molybdate and 220g of ammonium vanadate were<br>
dissolved therein to form solution (1). Next, 228g of<br>
copper nitrate and 4 9g of strontium nitrate were added<br>
to 500ml of distilled water, and the materials were<br>
mixed thoroughly to form solution (2) . Solution (1) was<br>
mixed with solution (2) to provide a suspension. The<br>
suspension was treated by using a homogenizer for at<br>
least 30 minutes and was coated on spherical carriers<br>
having an outer diameter of 4.0~ 8.0mm by using a spray<br>
nozzle to an amount of 20- 30 wt% as expressed by the<br>
catalytically active component present in the<br>
suspension.  The  coated  catalyst  was  dried  at  120°C<br>
sufficiently and calcined at 400°C for at least 5 hours<br>
to provide spherical catalyst particles having a final<br>
outer diameter of 5mm(±0.2).<br>
The catalyst had the elemental composition of<br>
Mo12W2.0V4.oCu2.oSr0.5 except oxygen.<br><experiment: catalyst packing and catalytic></experiment:>
Activity Test&gt;<br><br>
To a 3m stainless steel reactor having an inner<br>
diameter of 1 inch and heated with molten nitrate salt,<br>
alumina silica was packed to a height of 150mm as an<br>
inert material, and any one of Catalysts 1~ 4 was packed<br>
to a height of 2800mm as the first-step catalyst, from<br>
the inlet of the reaction gas toward the outlet.<br>
Then, alumina silica was packed to a height of<br>
150mm as an inert material and Catalyst 5 was packed to<br>
a height of 2900mm as the second-step catalyst.<br>
Propylene was subjected to vapor phase oxidation by<br>
using the reactor to produce acrolein and acrylic acid.<br>
The first-step oxidation was performed by introducing<br>
feed gas containing 7 vol% of propylene, 13 vol% of<br>
molecular oxygen, 8 vol% of water steam and 72 vol% of<br>
inert gas onto the catalyst with a space velocity of<br>
1500 hr-1  (STP),  at a reaction temperature of 320°C,<br>
under a reaction pressure of 0.7 atm. The second-step<br>
oxidation was performed at a reaction temperature of<br>
276°C, under a reaction pressure of 0.1~ 3kg/cm2G.<br>

Industrial Applicability<br>
5 As can be seen from the foregoing, when the Mo-Bi-<br>
Nb-Te based composite metal oxide according to the<br>
present invention is used as the first-step catalyst in<br>
the production of (meth)acrylic acid from propylene or<br>
the like, yield and/or selectivity of (meth)acrylic acid<br>

(meth)acrolein load decreases in the second-step to such<br>
a degree that (meth)acrolein conversion ratio can reach<br>
98- 100%.<br>
