The invention relates to a device for monitoring a combustion process having the features of the preamble of claim 1, and also a method for monitoring the combustion process having the features of the preamble of claim 4.<br>
DE 199 50981 Al has disclosed a rotary tubular oven for converting a substance, in which the method described in the introduction is used for cement production. In this case, spectroscopic data of the fired cement is determined, the intensity of which data, in particular with respect to calcium hydroxide, makes it possible to draw conclusions as to the clinker index (FCAO) as a measure of the quality of the cement.<br>
The present invention is based on the object of improving a method and a device of the type described in the introduction. This object is achieved by a method having the features of claim 1 and by a device having the features of claim 6. Further advantageous configurations form the subject matter of the sub claims.<br>
As a result of the fact that the input of heal into the bed is determined from the data recorded by the sensor and is used for quality determination, with the input of heal preferably being determined using the location-dependent thermal radiation of the flame and of the substance in the bed, it is possible to obtain a measure of the quality of the converted substance which is simpler to determine than the spectroscopic measurement. This is true in particular if the input of heat into the bed or the thermal radiation of the flame and of the bed are recorded optically, i.e. the camera arrangement which is in any case present for flame observation is used. The thermal radiation of the flame and of the bed are preferably normalized by means of the supplied<br><br>
3<br>
quantities of material and energy and used to control the combustion process by virtue of the normalized thermal radiations, at a defined temperature, as far as possible being kept in a constant relationship with respect to one another.<br>
The method and the device can be used for all conversion operations in which the conversion, firing, sintering or the like of the substance is dependent on the specific heat input, i.e. for example for the firing of cement or lime or in glassmaking.<br>
In the text, which follows, the invention is explained in more detail on the basis of an exemplary embodiment.<br>
The interior of a cement oven designed as a rotary tubular kiln has a bottom region, which is referred to as the bed, sintering zone or clinker bed. During the combustion process, the finished cement is formed in the bed. Above the bed is the region in which, during the combustion process, the flame is formed. The thermal radiation SF of the flame, the thermal radiation SB of the cement formed in the bed, the thermal radiation S/, of the cement (clinker) after the flame and the thermal radiation Sw of the rotary tubular kiln wall are recorded at a plurality of locations and for a prolonged period of time by means of a plurality of thermal radiation sensors, for example a multichip CCD camera, a CMOS camera or a glass fiber camera with a plurality of glass fibers which are independent of one another, in each case with connected image processing, and the data is fed to a computer.<br>
The absolute values for the thermal radiation are then also normalized, specifically the thermal radiations SF and Sw of the flame<br><br>
4<br>
and the rotary tubular kiln wall using the quantity and quality of the fuel, i.e. the calorific value MB, and the thermal radiations SB and Sz of the bed using the quantity of clinker produced (cement quantity) MZ. A control performed by the computer, for example by means of a neural network, uses a function of these different normalized thermal radiations, i.e. f(S,/MB, Sw/MB, SB/MZ, SZ/MZ)<br>
wherein,<br>
SF      represents the thermal radiation of the flame;<br>
SB      represents the thermal radiation of the cement formed in the bed;<br>
Sz      represents the thermal radiation of the cement (clinker) after the flame;<br>
Sw     represents the thermal radiation of the rotary tubular kiln wall;<br>
MB     represents the calorific value of the fuel;<br>
Mz     represents the cement quantity.<br>
The combustion process is controlled in such a way that at a defined temperature a relationship, which is as constant as possible, is maintained between these normalized thermal radiations.<br>
The difference between the normalized thermal radiation SF/MB of the flame and the normalized thermal radiation SB/MZ of the bed substantially determines the input of heat QB into the bed, i.e. the quantity of heat supplied to the bed. The FCAO value, which is a measure of the quality of the cement, is directly dependent on this (specific) heat input QB into the bed, in which context the quality may locally differ on account of the locally dependent nature of the input of heat QB. Therefore, the control of the combustion process is intended to achieve<br><br>
5<br>
the maximum input of heat QB into the bed. For this purpose, the computer controls various actuating devices which determine the control variables of the oven, for example the supply of air, fuel, lime and aggregates.<br><br>
