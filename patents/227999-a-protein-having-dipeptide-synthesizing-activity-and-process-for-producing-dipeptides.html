PROCESS FOR PRODUCING DIPEPTIDES<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a protein having dipeptide-synthesizing activity and a protein for dipeptide synthesis, a process for producing the protein having dipeptide-synthesizing activity, a process for producing a dipeptide using the protein having dipeptide-synthesizing activity or the protein for dipeptide synthesis, a microorganism or a transformant producing the protein having dipeptide-synthesizing activity or the protein for dipeptide synthesis, and a process for producing the dipeptide using such microorganism or transformant.<br>
Chemical synthesis methods (liquid phase method and solid phase method), enzymatic synthesis methods and biological synthesis methods utilizing recombinant DNA techniques are available for large-scale peptide synthesis. Currently, the enzymatic synthesis methods and biological synthesis methods are employed for the synthesis of long-chain peptides longer than 50 residues, and the chemical synthesis methods and enzymatic synthesis methods are mainly employed for the synthesis of dipeptides.<br>
In the synthesis of dipeptides by the chemical synthesis methods, however, operations such as introduction and removal of protective groups for functional groups are necessary, and racemates are also formed. The chemical synthesis methods are thus considered to be disadvantageous in respect of cost and efficiency. They are unfavorable also from the viewpoint of environmental hygiene because of the use of large amounts of organic solvents and the like.<br>
As to the synthesis of dipeptides by the enzymatic methods, the following methods are known*, a method utilizing reverse reaction of protease (J. Biol, Chem., 119, 707-720 (1937)); methods utilizing thermostable<br><br>
aminoacyl t-RNA synthetase (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 146539/83,  Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 209991/83, Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 209992/83,and Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 106298/84) ; and methods utilizing non-ribosome peptide synthetase (hereinafter referred to as NRPS) (Chem. Biol., 7, 373-384 (2000), FEBS Lett., 498, 42-45 (2001), U.S. Patent No. 5,795,738 and U.S. Patent No. 5,652,116).<br>
However, the method utilizing reverse reaction of protease requires introduction and removal of protective groups for functional groups of amino acids used as substrates, which causes difficulties in raising the efficiency of peptide-forming reaction and in preventing peptide-degradating reaction. The methods utilizing thermostable aminoacyl t-RNA synthetase have the defects that the expression of the enzyme and the prevention of side reactions forming by-products other than the desired products are difficult. The methods utilizing NRPS are inefficient in that the expression of the enzyme by recombinant DNA techniques is difficult because of its large enzyme molecule size and that the supply of coenzyme 4'-phosphopantetheine is necessary.<br>
On the other hand, there exist a group of peptide synthetases that have enzyme molecular weight lower than that of NRPS and do not require coenzyme 4'-phosphopantetheine; for example, y -glutamylcysteine synthetase, glutathione synthetase, D-alanine-D-alanine (D-Ala-D-Ala) ligase, and poly- y -glutamate synthetase. Most of these enzymes utilize D-amino acids as substrates or catalyze peptide bond formation at the y -carboxyl group. Because of such properties, they can not be used for the synthesis of dipeptides by peptide bond formation at the a-carboxyl group of L-amino acid.<br>
The only known example of an enzyme capable of dipeptide synthesis by the activity to form a peptide bond<br><br>
at the a-carboxyl group of L-amino acid is bacilysin (dipeptide antibiotic derived from a microorganism belonging to the genus Bacillus) synthetase, Bacilysin synthetase is known to have the activity to synthesize bacilysin [L-alanyl-L-anticapsin (L-Ala-L-anticapsin)] and L-alanyl-L-alanine (L-Ala-L-Ala), but there is no information about its activity to synthesize other peptides (J. Ind. Microbiol., 2^ 201-208 (1987) and Enzyme. Microbial. Technol., 29_, 400-406 (2001)).<br>
As for the bacilysin biosynthetase genes in Bacillus subtilis 168 whose entire genome information has been clarified (Nature, 39Â£, 249-256 (1997)), it is known that the productivity of bacilysin is increased by amplification of bacilysin operons containing ORFs ywfA-F (WO00/03009 pamphlet). However, it is not known whether an ORF encoding a protein having the activity to ligate two or more amino acids by peptide bond is contained in these ORFs, and if contained, which ORF encodes the protein.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a protein having the activity to synthesize a dipeptide which is different from L-Ala-L-Ala and for which no enzymatic synthesis method using peptide synthetase or the like has so far been proposed, and a protein for the synthesis of the dipeptide; DNA encoding the protein having the dipeptide-synthesizing activity; a recombinant DNA comprising the DNA; a transformant carrying the recombinant DNA; a process for producing the protein having the dipeptide-synthesizing activity; an enzymatic method for synthesizing the dipeptide using the protein having the dipeptide-synthesizing activity or the protein for the dipeptide synthesis; and a process for producing the dipeptide using, as an enzyme source, a culture of a microorganism having the ability to produce the protein having the dipeptide-synthesizing activity or the protein for the dipeptide synthesis, or the like.<br><br>

The proteins of the present invention include: [1] a protein comprising the amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOS: 2 to 8;<br>
[2] a protein consisting of an amino acid sequence wherein one or more amino acid residues are deleted, substituted or added in the amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 8 and having the activity to synthesize a dipeptide represented by formula (I):<br>
R1- R2  (I)<br>
(wherein R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, each represent an amino acid, provided that both R1 and R2 cannot represent L-alanine at the same time); [3] a protein comprising an amino acid sequence which shows 65% or more similarity to the amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 8 and having the activity to synthesize a dipeptide represented by formula (I); and [4] a protein comprising an amino acid sequence which shows 80% or more similarity to the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 17 and having the activity to<br><br>
synthesize a dipeptide represented by formula (I), provided that a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 is excluded.<br>
An example of the protein for the synthesis of a dipeptide represented by formula (I) of the present invention is a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1.<br>
Hereinafter, the above proteins of the present invention and proteins for the synthesis of a dipeptide represented by formula (I) may be collectively referred to as the proteins of the present invention.<br>
The above protein consisting of an amino acid<br>
sequence wherein one or more amino acid residues are<br>
deleted, substituted or added and having the activity to<br>
synthesize a dipeptide represented by formula (I) can be<br>
obtained, for example, by introducing a site-directed<br>
mutation into DNA encoding a protein consisting of the<br>
amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 8 by<br>
site-directed mutagenesis described in Molecular Cloning,<br>
A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor<br>
Laboratory Press (1989) (hereinafter referred to as<br>
Molecular Cloning, Second Edition); Current Protocols in<br>
Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons (1987-1997)<br>
(hereinafter referred to as Current Protocols in Molecular<br>
Biology); Nucleic Acids Research, 1Â£, 6487 (1982); Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 79, 6409 (1982); Gene, 34, 315<br>
(1985); Nucleic Acids Research, 13, 4431 (1985); Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82_, 488 (1985), etc.<br>
The number of amino acid residues which are deleted,<br>
substituted or added is not specifically limited, but is within the range where deletion, substitution or addition is possible by known methods such as the above site-directed mutagenesis. The suitable number is 1 to dozens, preferably 1 to 20, more preferably 1 to 10, further preferably 1 to 5.<br>
The expression "one or more amino acid residues are<br><br>
deleted, substituted or added in the amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 8" means that the amino acid sequence may contain deletion, substitution or addition of a single or plural amino acid residues at an arbitrary position of the amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 8.<br>
Amino acid residues that may be substituted are, for example, those which are not conserved in all of the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 8 when the sequences are compared using known alignment software. An example of known alignment software is alignment analysis software contained in gene analysis software Genetyx (Software Development Co., Ltd.). As analysis parameters for the analysis software, default values can be used.<br>
Deletion or addition of amino acid residues may be contained, for example, in the N-terminal region or the C-terminal region of the amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 8.<br>
Deletion, substitution and addition may be simultaneously contained in one sequence, and amino acids to be substituted or added may be either natural or not. Examples of the natural amino acids are L-alanine, L-asparagine, L-aspartic acid, L-glutamine, L-glutamic acid, glycine, L-histidine, L-isoleucine, L-leucine, L-lysine, L-methionine, L-phenylalanine, L-proline, L-serine, L-threonine, L-tryptophan, L-tyrosine, L-valine and L-cysteine.<br>
The following are examples of the amino acids capable of mutual substitution. The amino acids in the same group can be mutually substituted. Group A: leucine, isoleucine, norleucine, valine, norvaline, alanine, 2-aminobutanoic acid, methionine, O-methylserine, t-butylglycine, t-butylalanine, cyclohexylalanine Group B: aspartic acid, glutamic acid, isoaspartic acid, isoglutamic acid, 2-aminoadipic acid, 2-<br><br>
aminosuberic acid Group C: asparagine, glutamine Group D: lysine, arginine, ornithine, 2,4-diaminobutanoic<br>
acid, 2,3-diaminopropionic acid Group E: proline, 3-hydroxyproline, 4-hydroxyproline Group F: serine, threonine, homoserine Group G: phenylalanine, tyrosine<br>
In order that the protein of the present invention may have the activity to synthesize a dipeptide represented by formula (I), it is desirable that the similarity of its amino acid sequence to the amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 8, preferably SEQ ID NO: 1, is 65% or more, preferably 75% or more, more preferably 85% or more, further preferably 90% or more, particularly preferably 95% or more, and most preferably 98% or more.<br>
The similarity among amino acid sequences and nucleotide sequences can be determined by using algorithm BLAST by Karlin and Altschul [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 9Â£, 5873 (1993)] and FASTA [Methods Enzymol. , lB2_t   63 (1990)] . On the basis of the algorithm BLAST, programs such as BLASTN and BLASTX have been developed [J. Mol. Biol., 215, 403 (1990)]. When a nucleotide sequence is analyzed by BLASTN on the basis of BLAST, the parameters, for instance, are as follows: score=100 and wordlength=12. When an amino acid sequence is analyzed by BLASTX on the basis of BLAST, the parameters, for instance, are as follows: score=50 and wordlength=3. When BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs are used, default parameters of each program are used. The specific techniques for these analyses are known (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.).<br>
A protein consisting of an amino acid sequence which has 65% or more, preferably 75% or more, more preferably 85% or more, further preferably 90% or more, particularly preferably 95% or more, most preferably 98% or more similarity to the amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ<br><br>
ID NOS: 1 to 8, preferably SEQ ID NO: 1, and having the activity to synthesize a dipeptide represented by formula (I) is also included in the proteins of the present invention (provided that a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 is excluded). The similarity among amino acid sequences can be determined by using BLAST or FASTA as described above.<br>
The amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 17 is a region conserved among the proteins having the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 7 and is also a region corresponding to the consensus sequence of proteins having Ala-Ala ligase activity derived from various microorganisms.<br>
A protein having an amino acid sequence which shows 80% or more, preferably 90% or more, further preferably 95% or more similarity to the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 17 and having the activity to synthesize a dipeptide represented by formula (I) is also included in the proteins of the present invention (provided that a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 is excluded).<br>
In order that the protein having an amino acid sequence which shows 80% or more, preferably 90% or more, further preferably 95% or more similarity to the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 17 may have the activity to synthesize a dipeptide represented by formula (I), it is desirable that the similarity of its amino acid sequence to the amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 8 is at least 80% or more, usually 90% or more, and particularly 95% or more.<br>
The similarity among amino acid sequences can be determined by using BLAST or FASTA as described above.<br>
It is possible to confirm that the protein of the present invention is a protein having the activity to synthesize a dipeptide represented by the above formula (I), for example, in the following manner. That is, a<br><br>
transformant expressing the protein of the present invention is prepared by recombinant DNA techniques, the protein of the present invention is produced using the transformant, and then the protein of the present invention, at least two amino acids which may be the same or different (provided that L-alanine is used in combination with another L-amino acid) and ATP are allowed to be present in an aqueous medium, followed by HPLC analysis or the like to know whether a dipeptide represented by the above formula (I) is formed and accumulated in the aqueous medium.<br>

The obtained DNA, as such or after cleavage with appropriate restriction enzymes, is inserted into a vector by a conventional method, and the obtained recombinant DNA is introduced into a host cell. Then, the nucleotide sequence of the DNA can be determined by a conventional sequencing method such as the dideoxy method [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sex., USA, 74^, 5463 (1977)] or by using a nucleotide sequencer such as 373A DNA Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Corp.).<br><br>
In cases where the obtained DNA is found to be a partial DNA by the analysis of nucleotide sequence, the full length DNA can be obtained by Southern hybridization of a chromosomal DNA library using the partial DNA as a probe.<br>
It is also possible to prepare the desired DNA by chemical synthesis using a DNA synthesizer (e.g., Model 8905, PerSeptive Biosystems) based on the determined nucleotide sequence of the DNA.<br>

DNA used in the production process of the present<br>
invention, a DNA fragment of an appropriate length<br>
comprising a region encoding a protein of the present<br>
invention is prepared according to need. The productivity<br>
of the protein can be enhanced by replacing a nucleotide<br>
in the nucleotide sequence of the region encoding the<br>
protein so as to make a codon most suitable for the<br>
expression in a host cell. A DNA comprising codon<br>
optimized nucleic acid sequence thereof will be recognized<br>
as being a part of the presently disclosed invention.<br>
The DNA fragment may be inserted downstream of a promoter in an appropriate expression vector to prepare a recombinant DNA.<br>
A transformant producing a protein of the present invention can be obtained by introducing the recombinant DNA into a host cell suited for the expression vector.<br>
As a host cell, any bacterial cells, yeast cells, animal cells, insect cells, plant cells, etc, that are capable of expressing the desired gene can be used.<br><br>

distance between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (ribosome<br>
binding sequence) and the initiation codon is adjusted to<br>
an appropriate length (e.g., 6 to 18 nucleotides).<br>

medium; and in the case of a microorganism transformed<br>
with an expression vector comprising trp promoter,<br>

For the culturing of the transformant obtained by<br>
using an animal cell as the host cell, generally employed<br>
media such as RPMI1640 medium [J. Am. Med. Assoc, 199,<br>
519 (1967)], Eagle's MEM [Science, 122^, 501 (1952)], DMEM<br>
[Virology, 8_,   396 (1959)] and 199 medium [Proc. Soc. Biol.<br>
Med., 22' * (1950)], media prepared by adding fetal calf<br>
serum or the like to these media, etc. can be used as the<br>
medium.<br>

ExCell 405 (JRH Biosciences, Inc.) and Grace's Insect<br>
Medium [Nature, 195, 788 (1962)] can be used as the medium. Culturing is usually carried out at pH 6 to 7 at 25<br>
to 30Â°C for 1 to 5 days.<br>
If necessary, antibiotics such as gentamicin may be added to the medium during the culturing.<br>
The transformant obtained by using a plant cell as<br>
the host cell may be cultured in the form of cells as such<br>

media such as Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium and White medium,<br>
media prepared by adding phytohormones such as auxin and<br>
cytokinin to these media, etc. can be used as the medium. Culturing is usually carried out at pH 5 to 9 at 20<br>

hygromycin may be added to the medium during the culturing.<br>
As described above, a protein of the present invention can be produced by culturing, according to a conventional culturing method, the transformant derived from a microorganism, an insect cell, an animal cell or a plant cell and carrying a recombinant DNA prepared by ligating a DNA of the present invention or a DNA used in the production process of the present invention to an expression vector, allowing the protein to form and accumulate, and recovering the protein from the culture.<br>
A protein of the present invention may be produced by intracellular production by host cells, extracellular secretion by host cells or production on outer membranes by host cells, and depending on the method selected, the sutructure of the protein produced is suitably modified.<br>
When a protein of the present invention is produced in host cells or on outer membranes of host cells, it is possible to force the protein to be secreted outside the host cells by applying the method of Paulson, et al. [J. Biol. Chem., 264, 17619 (1989)], the method of Lowe, et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86^,   8227 (1989); Genes Develop., ^, 1288 (1990)], or the methods described in Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 336963/93, WO94/23021, etc.<br>
That is, extracellular secretion of a protein of the present invention by host cells can be caused by producing it in the form of a protein in which a signal peptide is added upstream of a protein containing the active site of a protein of the present invention by the use of recombinant DNA techniques.<br>
It is also possible to increase the protein production by utilizing a gene amplification system using a dihydrofolate reductase gene or the like according to the method described in Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 227075/90.<br>
Further, a protein of the present invention can be<br><br>
produced using an animal having an introduced gene (non-human transgenic animal) or a plant having an introduced gene (transgenic plant) constructed by redifferentiation of animal or plant cells carrying the introduced gene.<br>
When a transformant producing a protein of the present invention is an animal or plant, the protein can be produced by raising or culturing the animal or plant in a usual manner, allowing the protein to form and accumulate therein, and recovering the protein from the animal or plant.<br>
Production of a protein of the present invention using an animal can be carried out, for example, by producing the protein in an animal constructed by introducing the gene according to known methods [Am. J. Clin. Nutr., 63, 639S (1996); Am. J. Clin. Nutr., 63, 627S (1996); Bio/Technology, 9, 830 (1991)].<br>
In the case of an animal, a protein of the present invention can be produced, for example, by raising a non-human transgenic animal carrying an introduced DNA of the present invention or DNA used in the production process of the present invention, allowing the protein to form and accumulate in the animal, and recovering the protein from the animal. The places where the protein is formed and accumulated include milk (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 309192/88), egg, etc. of the animal. As the promoter in this process, any promoters capable of functioning in an animal can be used. Preferred promoters include mammary gland cell-specific promoters such as a casein promoter, ]3 casein promoter, j3 lactoglobulin promoter and whey acidic protein promoter.<br>
Production of the protein of the present invention using a plant can be carried out, for example, by culturing a transgenic plant carrying the introduced DNA encoding the protein of the present invention according to known methods [Soshiki Baiyo (Tissue Culture), ^3 (1994); Soshiki Baiyo, 21 (1995); Trends Biotechnol., 1J5, 45<br><br>
(1997)], allowing the protein to form and accumulate in the plant, and recovering the protein from the plant. Tissue specific promoters may also be used in plant production by means known to one of ordinary skill.<br>
Isolation and purification of a protein of the present invention produced using the transformant producing a protein of the present invention can be carried out by conventional methods for isolating and purifying enzymes.<br>
For example, when a protein of the present invention is produced in a soluble form in cells, the cells may be recovered by centrifugation after the completion of culturing and suspended in an aqueous buffer, followed by disruption using a sonicator, French press, Manton Gaulin homogenizer, Dynomill or the like to obtain a cell-free extract.<br>
A purified protein preparation can be obtained by centrifuging the cell-free extract to obtain the supernatant and then subjecting the supernatant to ordinary means for isolating and purifying enzymes, e.g., extraction with a solvent, salting-out with ammonium sulfate, etc., desalting, precipitation with an organic solvent, anion exchange chromatography using resins such as diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-Sepharose and DIAION HPA-75 (Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation), cation exchange chromatography using resins such as S-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia), hydrophobic chromatography using resins such as butyl Sepharose and phenyl Sepharose, gel filtration using a molecular sieve, affinity chromatography, chromatofocusing, and electrophoresis such as isoelectric focusing, alone or in combination.<br>
When a protein is produced as an inclusion body in cells, the cells are similarly recovered and disrupted, followed by centrifugation to obtain a precipitate fraction. After the protein is recovered from the precipitate fraction by an ordinary method, the inclusion<br><br>
body of the protein is solubilized with a protein-denaturing agent.<br>
The solubilized protein solution is diluted with or dialyzed against a solution containing no protein-denaturing agent or a solution containing the protein-denaturing agent at such a low concentration that denaturation of protein is not caused, whereby the protein is renatured to have normal higher-order structure. Then, a purified protein preparation can be obtained by the same isolation and purification steps as described above.<br>
When the protein of the present invention or its derivative such as a glycosylated form is extracellularly secreted, the protein or its derivative such as a glycosylated form can be recovered in the culture supernatant.<br>
That is, the culture is treated by the same means as above, e.g., centrifugation, to obtain a soluble fraction. A purified protein preparation can be obtained from the soluble fraction by using the same isolation and purification methods as described above.<br>
Examples of the proteins obtained in the above manner are proteins respectively consisting of the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 8.<br>
It is also possible to produce a protein of the present invention as a fusion protein with another protein and to purify it by affinity chromatography using a substance having affinity for the fused protein. For example, according to the method of Lowe, et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86^,   8227 (1989); Genes Develop., 4_, 1288 (1990)] and the methods described in Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 336963/93 and WO94/23021, a protein of the present invention can be produced as a fusion protein with protein A and can be purified by affinity chromatography using immunoglobulin G.<br>
Further, it is possible to produce a protein of the present invention as a fusion protein with a Flag peptide<br><br>
and to purify it by affinity chromatography using anti-Flag antibody [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, EJ6, 8227 (1989); Genes Develop., Â£, 1288 (1990)]. The protein can also be purified by affinity chromatography using an antibody against said protein.<br>
A protein of the present invention can also be produced by chemical synthetic methods such as the Fmoc method (the fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl method) and the tBoc method (the t-butyloxycarbonyl method) based on the amino acid sequence information on the protein obtained above. Further, a protein of the present invention can be chemically synthesized by using peptide synthesizers from Advanced ChemTech, Perkin-Elmer, Pharmacia, Protein Technology Instrument, Synthecell-Vega, PerSeptive, Shimadzu Corporation, etc.<br>

Activity Utilizing a Database<br>
By using, as a query, the amino acid sequence of D-<br><br>
Ala-D-Ala ligase gene derived from Bacillus subtilis 168 [Nature, 390, 249-256 (1997)], a search for a gene encoding a protein showing similarity which is present in the genomic DNA sequences of Bacillus subtilis 168 was carried out using the similarity search function of Subtilist (http://genolist.pasteur.fr/SubtiList/) which is a database of the genomic DNA of Bacillus subtilis 168,<br>
From the sequences obtained as a result of the search, genes encoding the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOS: 33, 34 and 35 which are D-Ala-D-Ala ligase motifs [Biochemistry, 3j)' 1673 (1991)] and encoding proteins whose function had already been clarified were excluded.
