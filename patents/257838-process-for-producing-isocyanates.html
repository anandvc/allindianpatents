Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing isocyanates.<br>
Background Art<br>
Isocyanates are widely used as production raw materials of products, such as polyurethane foams, paints and adhesives.   The main industrial production process of isocyanates includes reacting amine compounds with phosgene (phosgene method), and nearly the entire amount of isocyanates produced throughout the world are produced according to the phosgene method.    However, the phosgene method has numerous problems.<br>
Firstly, this method requires the use of a large amount of phosgene as raw material.    Phosgene is extremely toxic and requires special handling precautions to prevent exposure of handlers thereof, and also requires special apparatuses to detoxify waste.<br>
Secondly, since highly corrosive hydrogen chloride is produced in large amounts as a byproduct of the phosgene method, in addition to requiring a process for detoxifying the hydrogen chloride, in many cases hydrolytic chlorine is contained in the isocyanates produced, which may have a detrimental effect on the weather resistance and heat resistance of polyurethane products in the case of using isocyanates produced using the phosgene method.<br>
On the basis of this background, a process for producing isocyanates has been sought that does not use phosgene.   One example of a method for producing isocyanate compounds without using phosgene that has been proposed involves thermal decomposition of carbamic acid esters.    Isocyanates and hydroxy<br><br>
compounds have long been known to be obtained by thermal decomposition of carbamic acid esters (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 1).   The basic reaction is illustrated by the following formula:<br><br>
(wherein R represents an organic residue having a valence of a, R' represents a monovalent organic residue, and a represents an integer of 1 or more).<br>
On the other hand, thermal decomposition of carbamic acid esters is susceptible to the simultaneous occurrence of various irreversible side reactions such as thermal denaturation reactions undesirable for carbamic acid esters or condensation of isocyanates formed by the thermal decomposition.   Examples of these side reactions include a reaction in which urea bonds are formed as represented by the following formula (2), a reaction in which carbodiimides are formed as represented by the following formula (3), and a reaction in which isocyanurates are formed as represented by the following formula (4) (see, Non-Patent Document 1 and Non-Patent Document 2).<br><br>
In addition to these side reactions leading to a decrease in yield and selectivity of the target isocyanate, in the production of polyisocyanates in particular, these reactions may make long-term operation difficult as a result of, for example, causing the precipitation of polymeric solids that clog the reaction vessel.<br>
Various methods have been proposed for producing isocyanates that do not contain phosgene.<br><br>
According to the description of Patent Document 1, an aliphatic diurethane and / or alicyclic diurethane and / or aliphatic polyurethane and / or alicyclic polyurethane are obtained by reacting an aliphatic primary diamine and / or alicyclic primary diamine and / or aliphatic primary polyamine and / or alicyclic primary polyamine in the presence of an O-alkylcarbamate and alcohol and in the presence or absence of a catalyst at 160 to 300°C at a ratio of amine NH2 group : carbamate : alcohol of 1 : 0.8 to 10.0 : 0.25 to 50, and removing the ammonia formed as necessary.   The resulting diurethane and / or polyurethane can be converted to the corresponding diisocyanate and / or highly functional polyisocyanate as necessary.   The detailed reaction conditions for the thermal decomposition are not described in this patent publication.<br>
According to the description of Patent Document 2, an aromatic diisocyanate and / or polyisocyanate are produced by going through the following two steps.    In the first step, an aromatic primary amine and / or an aromatic primary polyamine are reacted with an O-alkylcarbamate in the presence or absence of a catalyst and in the presence or absence of urea and alcohol to form an aryl diurethane and / or aryl polyurethane followed by removal of the ammonia formed as necessary.    In the second step, an aromatic isocyanate and / or aromatic polyisocyanate are obtained by thermal decomposition of the aryl diurethane and / or aryl polyurethane.<br>
Other publications contain descriptions relating to partial substitution of urea and / or diamine by a carbonyl-containing compound such as N-substituted carbamate and / or dialkylcarbamate, or mono-substituted urea, di-substituted urea, mono-substituted polyurea or di-substituted polyurea (see Patent Document 3, Patent Document 4, Patent Document 5, Patent Document 6 and Patent Document 7).   Patent Document 8 describes a method for producing aliphatic O-aryl urethanes by reacting (cyclic) aliphatic polyamines with urea and aromatic hydroxy compounds.<br><br>
There are several known methods for forming corresponding isocyanates and alcohols by thermal decomposition of (cyclic) aliphatic, and particularly aromatic, monourethanes and diurethanes, including methods carried out in the vapor phase at a high temperature, and methods carried out in a liquid phase under comparatively low temperature conditions.    In these methods, however, the reaction mixture gives rise to the side reactions described above, thereby causing, for example, the formation of sediment, polymeric substances and obstructions in the reaction vessel and recovery apparatus, or the formation of substances that adhere to the sidewalls of the reaction vessel, thereby resulting in poor economic efficiency in the case of producing isocyanates over a long period of time.<br>
Thus, the use of a chemical method, such as the use of a special catalyst (see Patent document 9 and Patent Document 10) or a catalyst combined with an inert solvent (see Patent Document 11), has been disclosed to improve the yield in the thermal decomposition of urethane.<br>
For example, Patent document 12 describes a process for producing hexamethylene diisocyanate including thermal decomposition of hexamethylene diethyl urethane in the presence of dibenzyl toluene used as a solvent and in the presence of a catalyst mixture composed of methyl toluene sulfonate and diphenyl tin dichloride.    However, since there are no detailed descriptions of production or isolation of the starting components or purification and arbitrary recovery of the solvent and catalyst mixture, the economic efficiency of this process could not be evaluated.<br>
According to the method described in Patent Document 13, urethane can be easily broken down into isocyanate and alcohol in a carbon-containing fluidized bed without using a catalyst.    In addition, according to the description of Patent document 14, hexamethylene dialkyl urethane can be decomposed in the gaseous<br><br>
phase at a temperature in excess of 300°C in the presence or absence of a gas permeable packaging material made of, for example, carbon, copper, brass, steel, zinc, aluminum, titanium, chromium, cobalt or quartz to form hexamethylene diisocyanate.<br>
In addition, according to the description of Patent Document 14, this method is carried out in the presence of a hydrogen halide and / or hydrogen halide donor. However, this method is unable to achieve a yield of hexamethylene diisocyanate of 90% or more.   This is because the decomposition products are partially recombined resulting in the formation of urethane bonds.   Thus, the hexamethylene is required to be additionally purified by distillation, which frequently increases yield loss.<br>
Moreover, according to the description of Patent Document 15, a monocarbonate is disclosed to be able to be decomposed with favorable yield and in the absence of a solvent and in the presence or absence of a catalyst and / or stabilizer at a comparatively low temperature and advantageously under reduced pressure.   The decomposition products (monoisocyanate and alcohol) are removed from a boiling reaction mixture by distillation and separately captured by separative condensation.   A method for removing byproducts formed during thermal decomposition including partially removing the reaction mixture outside the system is described in a generic form.   Thus, although byproducts can be removed from the bottom of the reaction vessel, problems remain with respect to the case of adherence to the sidewalls of the reaction vessel as previously described, and problems with respect to long-term operation remain unsolved.    In addition, there is no description regarding industrial utilization of the removed reaction mixture (containing large amounts of useful components).<br>
According to the description of Patent Document 16, thermal decomposition of aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic polycarbamates is carried out in the presence of an<br><br>
inert solvent at 150 to 350°C and 0.001 to 20 bar, and in the presence or absence of a catalyst, and an assistant in the form of hydrogen chloride, organic acid chloride, alkylation agent or organic tin chloride.   Byproducts formed, can be continuously removed from the reaction vessel together with the reaction solution, for example, and a corresponding amount of fresh solvent or recovered solvent can is added simultaneously.   A shortcoming of this method is, for example, a reduction in the space-time yield of polyisocyanates as a result of using a refluxing solvent, while also requiring considerable energy, including that for recovery of the solvent.   Moreover, the assistants used are volatile under the reaction conditions, resulting in the potential for contamination of the decomposition products.    In addition, the amount of residue is large based on the formed polyisocyanate, thus leaving room for doubt regarding economic efficiency and the reliability of industrial methods.<br>
According to the description of Patent Document 17, a method is described for continuous thermal decomposition of a carbamate such as the cyclic diurethane, 5-(ethoxycarbonylamino)-1-(ethoxycarbonylaminomethyl)-1,3,3-trimethylcyclohexane, supplied along the inner surface of a tubular reaction vessel in a liquid form in the presence of a high boiling point solvent.   This method has the shortcomings of low yield during production of (cyclic) aliphatic diisocyanates and low selectivity.    In addition, there is no description of a continuous method accompanying recovery of recombined or partially decomposed carbamates, while there is also no mention made of post-treatment of solvent contained in the byproducts and catalyst.<br>
According to Patent Document 18, a circulation process is disclosed for producing (cyclic) aliphatic diisocyanates by converting corresponding diamines to diurethane followed by thermal decomposition of this urethane.   This process minimizes reductions in yield by recirculating the product of the urethane decomposition step following reaction with alcohol to a urethanation step.				<br><br>
Byproducts unable to be recirculated are removed by separation by distillation of the mixture of urethanation products, and in this case, a valueless residue is formed in the form of bottom products, while all comparatively low boiling point components, including diurethane, are removed from the top of the column.   However, this process has the shortcoming of using a large amount of energy.   This is because all of the diurethane must be evaporated in the presence of catalyst, and this diurethane must be evaporated at a temperature level within the range of the decomposition temperature of urethane.    Moreover, isocyanate groups formed in useful products react with residue urethane groups, frequently resulting in the formation of comparatively high molecular weight byproducts that lower yield.<br>
In addition, according to the description of Patent Document 19, a method is disclosed for partially removing valueless byproducts outside the system during thermal decomposition of polyurethane.   A shortcoming of this method is that isocyanate yield decreases due to polyurethane ending up being contained in byproducts partially removed outside the system.    In addition, heating of byproducts remaining in the reaction vessel without being removed outside the system results in the formation of polymeric compounds, and the adherence of these compounds to the reaction vessel makes continuous operation over a long period of time difficult.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
As has been described above, various processes have been studied to produce isocyanates without using highly toxic phosgene.   However, since these processes have problems such as the formation of high boiling point byproducts, and difficulties in continuous operation over a long period of time due to the adherence of these high boiling point byproducts to the reaction vessel, hardly any of these processes have been carried out industrially.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a process for long-term, stable production of isocyanates at a high yield without the various problems found in the<br><br>
prior art during production of isocyanates without using phosgene.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
In view of the above, as a result of conducting extensive studies on the above-mentioned problems, the inventors of the present invention unexpectedly found that a carbamic acid ester or isocyanate is less susceptible to the occurrence of side reactions like those described above in the presence of a specific compound having an active proton.    Moreover, it was also found that, in the case of having used this specific compound having an active proton, there is hardly any precipitation of high boiling point byproducts formed as a result of the side reactions, thereby not causing adherence to or obstruction of the reaction vessel.   As a result of conducting extensive studies thereon, the inventors of the present invention determined that high boiling point substances formed by these side reactions have high solubility in the specific compound having an active proton, thereby enabling these substances to be easily removed outside the system.    In addition, although there are cases in which some of specific compounds having an active proton are subjected to a reaction presumed to be the result of thermal denaturation, it was unexpectedly further found that, in the case of carrying out thermal decomposition of a carbamic acid ester in the presence of a specific carbonic acid derivative, in addition to this thermal denaturation being less likely to occur, the yield of isocyanate is improved.   Although the mechanism by which isocyanate yield is improved is not clear, the inventors of the present invention presume that since the compound having the active proton reduces the likelihood of thermal denaturation as result of the coexistence of a specific carbonic acid derivative, the formation of high boiling point substances is most likely inhibited by a reaction between the compound having the active proton subjected to thermal denaturation and the carbamic acid ester and / or<br><br>
isocyanate.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The following provides a detailed explanation of the best mode for carrying out the present invention (hereinafter referred to as "the present embodiment"). Furthermore, the present invention is not limited to the following present embodiment, but rather can be modified in various ways within the scope of the gist thereof.<br>
The process for producing an isocyanate according to the present embodiment comprises a process for producing an isocyanate by supplying a carbamic acid ester to a decomposition reaction, wherein the decomposition reaction is carried out in the presence of a compound having an active proton.   Moreover, the present invention comprises carrying out the decomposition reaction in the presence of a compound having an active proton and a carbonic acid derivative.<br>
To begin with, the explanation is given of those compounds used in the process for producing the isocyanates according to the present embodiment.<br>
The term "active proton" in the compound having the active proton used in the<br><br>
present embodiment refers to a hydrogen atom as explained below.<br>
In general, although there are many cases in which hydrogen atoms bound to carbon atoms in molecules of organic compounds are inert and lack reactivity, there are many cases in which hydrogen atoms bound to oxygen atoms, sulfur atoms or nitrogen atoms and the like are strongly reactive and easily react with various types of reagents.    Such a hydrogen atom is referred to as an active proton in the present embodiment.   Examples of such active protons include hydrogen atoms contained in an atomic group such as an -OH group, -SH group, -NH2 group or -COOH group.    In addition, hydrogen atoms bound to a carbon atom to which is bound a strong electron-attracting group such as a -COOR group, -CN group, -NO2 group or -COR group (wherein R represents an aliphatic group or aromatic group) demonstrate greater reactivity than hydrogen atoms bound to an general carbon atom, and such hydrogen atoms are also included as an active proton in the present embodiment.<br>
Note that the compound having the active proton in the present embodiment differs from the inert solvent referred to in the prior art (see, for example, US Patent No. 4081472).    For example, according to this patent publication, although an inert solvent refers to a compound that does not react with isocyanate formed by thermal decomposition of carbamic acid ester, as is described in the literature with regard to this (Journal of the American Chemical Society, Vol. 64, p. 2229, 1942) that urethane is formed by a reaction between an aromatic hydroxy compound and phenyl isocyanate, the compound having tghe active proton reacts with the isocyanates.    In this manner, the use of the compound having the active proton was avoided in the prior art due to the risk of reacting with the isocyanates, and an inert solvent was used instead that does not react with the isocyanates.   However, according to studies conducted by the inventors of the present invention, it was found that the isocyanates can be advantageously recovered even in the presence of the<br><br>
compound having the active proton.    Moreover, in the case of carrying out thermal decomposition of carbamic acid ester in the presence of the compound having the active proton, it was found that the effect of improving the yield of isocyanate is demonstrated in comparison with the case carrying out the reaction in the absence of the compound having the active proton.<br>
The compound having the active proton used in the present embodiment is a compound having an active proton as defined above.    In particular, although the compound having an -OH group, -SH group, -NH2 group or -COOH group is used preferably, in the case the acidity or basicity of this group is excessively high or low, there is a strong tendency for compounds having the active proton to strongly associate, which is presumed to make it difficult to demonstrate the effects of the compounds having the active proton to be described hereinafter.   According to studies conducted by the inventors of the present invention, since there are cases in which the effect of improving isocyanate yield is small, the compound having the hydroxyl group is used more preferably, while an aromatic hydroxy compound is used even more preferably.<br>
Although there are no particular limitations on the aromatic hydroxy compound used in the present embodiment provided it is a compound having a hydroxyl group directly bound to an aromatic ring, it is preferably an aromatic hydroxy compound having a substituent, and particularly an aromatic hydroxy compound having a substituent at at least one ortho position relative to a hydroxyl group as represented by the following formula (10):<br><br><br>

The inventors of the present invention unexpectedly found that carbamic acid esters are less susceptible to the occurrence of the above-mentioned side reactions in the presence of the hydroxy compounds as described above.   Although the mechanism by which the hydroxy compound inhibits these side reactions is unclear, the inventors of the present invention presumed that, for example, in a reaction that forms a urea bond as represented by the above-mentioned formula (2), as a result of a urethane bond (-NHCOO-) of carbamic acid esters and the hydroxy compounds forming a hydrogen bond, since the urethane bonds are formed in a state in which it is difficult for them to approach each other, it is difficult for the side reaction resulting in the formation of urea bonds to occur.   In particular, in the case of the aromatic hydroxy compounds having a substituent at an ortho position relative to the hydroxyl group, in addition to the effects described above, the inventors of the present invention presume that due to the effect of the substituent bound at an ortho position relative to the hydroxyl group sterically protecting the urethane bonds, the effect is demonstrated by which reactions with urethane bonds of other carbamic acid esters are strongly inhibited.<br><br>
In addition, as a result of conducting extensive studies, the inventors of the present invention unexpectedly found that the aromatic hydroxy compounds having a substituent as described above has favorable solubility with respect to carbamic acid esters, carbonic acid derivatives to be described later, and high boiling point substances formed by side reactions.    Namely, in the decomposition of carbamic acid esters to be described later, it is not necessary to add another solvent to obtain a homogeneous liquid phase, and even in the case a high boiling point substance is formed during decomposition of carbamic acid esters, since the aromatic hydroxy compounds used in the present embodiment dissolve this high boiling point substance, the effect is demonstrated of not allowing such substances to adhere to or obstruct the reaction vessel.<br>
The hydroxy compound is preferable an aromatic hydroxy compound having a standard boiling point higher than the standard boiling point of a hydroxy compound corresponding to an aliphatic alkoxy group, aryloxy group or aralkyloxy group that composes the ester group of a carbamic acid ester described below.   The term "standard boiling point" used in the present invention refers to the boiling point at 1 atmosphere.<br><carbamic acid ester><br>

group (including isomers), a tridecyloxybutyl group (including isomers), a tridecyloxypentyl group (including isomers), a tridecyloxyhexyl group (including isomers), a tridecyloxyheptyl group (including isomers), a tetradecyloxymethyl group (including isomers), a tetradecyloxyethyl group (including isomers), a tetradecyloxypropyl group (including isomers), a tetradecyloxybutyl group (including isomers), a tetradecyloxypentyl group (including isomers), a tetradecyloxyhexyl group (including isomers), a pentadecyloxymethyl group, a pentadecyloxyethyl group (including isomers), a pentadecyloxypropyl group (including isomers), a pentadecyloxybutyl group (including isomers), a pentadecyloxypentyl group (including isomers), a hexadecyloxymethyl group (including isomers), a hexadecyloxyethyl group (including isomers), a hexadecyloxypropyl group (including isomers), a hexadecyloxybutyl group (including isomers), a heptadecyloxymethyl group (including isomers), a heptadecyloxyethyl group (including isomers), a heptadecyloxypropyl group (including isomers), an octadecyloxymethyl group, an octadecyloxyethyl group (including isomers) or the like.   Among these, alkyl groups in which the number of carbon atoms constituting the group is a number selected from an integer of 1 to 20, such as a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group (including isomers), a butyl group (including isomers), a pentyl group (including isomers), a hexyl group (including isomers), a heptyl group (including isomers), an octyl group (including isomers) or the like are preferable.<br>
A previously-described amine compound can be used for the amine compounds.<br>
Although varying according to the reacted compounds, the reaction conditions are such that the hydroxy compounds are used within the range of from 1 to 500 times the amino groups of the amine compound when expressed as the stoichiometric ratio.   Although it is preferable to use an excess of the hydroxy<br><br>
compounds since complex substituted urea compounds are formed easily if the amount of the hydroxy compounds is less than one times the amount of amino groups of the amine compound, in consideration of the size of the reaction vessel, the amount of the hydroxy compounds is preferably within the range of from 1 to 100 times and more preferably within the range of from 5 to 50 times.   The amount of urea is within the range of from 0.5 to 3 times the amino groups of the polyamine compounds when expressed as a stoichiometric ratio.   Although it is preferable to use an excess amount of urea since complex substituted urea compounds form easily if the amount used is less than 0.5 times, since complex substituted urea compounds may form easily or unreacted urea may remain even if an excess amount of urea is used, the amount of urea used is preferably within the range of from 0.8 to 2 times.   The reaction temperature is preferably from 150 to 280°C.    If the temperature is lower than 150°C, the reaction slows or does not occur at all due to strong bonding between the hydroxy compound and the amine compound, urea or byproduct ammonia, or the amount of complex substituted urea compounds increases, thereby making this undesirable.   On the other hand, at a temperature higher than 280°C, the urea decomposes, the hydroxy compound undergoes dehydrogenation, or the product in the form of carbamic acid ester is easily decomposed or denatured, thereby making this undesirable.    In this sense, the reaction temperature is more preferably within the range of from 180 to 260°C and even more preferably within the range of from 200 to 250°C.<br>
Since the reaction is an equilibrium reaction that shifts toward the reactants side, it is preferably to carry out the reaction while removing by byproduct ammonia outside the system, and methods for carrying out the reaction in this manner include reactive distillation, use of an inert gas, membrane separation and adsorptive separation.   For example, reactive distillation refers to separating ammonia<br><br>
successively formed in the reaction in the form of a gas by distillation.   This can be carried out while boiling a solvent or hydroxy compound to increase the ammonia distillation efficiency.    In addition, examples of a method using an inert gas include separating ammonia successively formed in the reaction from the reaction system by combining with an inert gas in a gaseous state.    Examples of such inert gases include nitrogen, helium, argon, carbon dioxide gas, methane, ethane and propane, and these can be used alone or as a mixture thereof, and a method that allows the inert gas to be introduced into the reaction system is preferable.   Examples of adsorbents used in an adsorptive separation method include those that can be used under the temperature conditions at which the reaction is carried out, such as silica, alumina, various types of zeolite or diatomaceous earth.    Methods for removing ammonia outside the system may be carried out alone or a plurality of types of methods may be combined.<br>
A catalyst can be used in the reaction for the purpose of, for example, increasing the reaction rate.   Examples of such catalysts that are used preferably include basic catalysts such as methylates, ethylates and butyrates (including isomers) or the like of lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium or barium; rare earth elements, antimony and bismuth alone or oxides, sulfides or salts of these elements; boron alone or boron compounds; metals of the copper family, zinc family, aluminum family, carbon family or titanium family of the periodic table and sulfides of these metal compounds; and carbides and nitrides of elements of the carbon family excluding carbon, titanium family, vanadium family and chromium family of the periodic table.    In the case of using the catalyst, although there are no particular limitations on the amount used thereof, catalysts can be used within the range of from 0.0001 to 100 times the amount of amino groups of the amine compound in terms of the stoichiometric ratio.<br><br>
Although varying according to the composition of the reaction system, reaction temperature, ammonia removal method, reaction apparatus and the like, the reaction pressure is preferably within the range of from 0.01 to 10 MPa, and in consideration of ease of carrying out industrially, preferably within the range of from 0.1 to 5 MPa. Although varying according to the composition of the reaction system, reaction temperature, ammonia removal method, reaction apparatus, reaction pressure and the like, the reaction time is generally from 0.01 to 100 hours.<br>
In this reaction, although it not always necessary to use a reaction solvent, suitable solvent may be used for the purpose of facilitating the reaction procedure, and examples of the solvents preferably used as reaction solvents include alkanes such as pentane (including isomers), hexane (including isomers), heptane (including isomers), octane (including isomers), nonane (including isomers), decane (including isomers); aromatic hydrocarbons and alkyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene (including isomers), ethyl benzene, diisopropyl benzene (including isomers), dibutyl benzene (including isomers), naphthalene or the like; nitrile compounds such as acetonitrile, benzonitrile or the like; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol (including isomers), butanol (including isomers), pentanol (including isomers), hexanol (including isomers), heptanol (including isomers), octanol (including isomers), nonanol (including isomers) or the like; aromatic compounds substituted with a halogen or nitro group such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene (including isomers), bromobenzene, dibromobenzene (including isomers), chloronaphthalene, bromonaphthalene, nitrobenzene, nitronaphthalene or the like; polycyclic hydrocarbon compounds such as diphenyl, substituted diphenyl, diphenyl methane, terphenyl, anthracene, dibenzyl toluene (including isomers) or the like; aromatic hydroxy compounds such as phenol, methyl phenol (including isomers), ethyl phenol (including isomers), butyl phenol<br><br>
(including isomers), pentyl phenol (including isomers), dimethyl phenol (including isomers), diethyl phenol (including isomers), dibutyl phenol (including isomers), dipentyl phenol (including isomers) or the like; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, cyclopentane, cyclooctane, ethylcyclohexane or the like; alicyclic alcohols such as cyclohexanol, cyclopentanol, cyclooctanol or the like; ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone, acetophenone or the like; esters such as dibutyl phthalate, dihexyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, benzylbutyl phthalate or the like; ethers and thioethers such as tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, diphenyl ether, diphenyl sulfide or the like; ketone compounds such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or the like; ester compounds such as ethyl acetate, ethyl benzoate or the like; and sulfoxides such as dimethylsulfoxide, diphenylsulfoxide or the like.    Moreover, additional examples of reaction solvents include halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon compounds such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene, fluorobenzene, chlorotoluene, chloronaphthalene, bromonaphthalene or the like, and halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon compounds or halogenated alicyclic hydrocarbon compounds such as chlorohexane, chlorocyclohexane, trichlorofluoroethane, methylene chloride, carbon tetrachloride or the like.<br>
There are no particular limitations on the reaction apparatus used when carrying out the reaction, and known reaction vessels can be used.    Conventionally the known reaction vessels can be suitably combined, examples of which include a stirring tank, a pressurized stirring tank, a vacuum stirring tank, a column reactor, a distillation column, a packed column, a thin film evaporator or the like.   There are no particular limitations on the material of the reaction vessel, and a known material can be used.    Examples of materials that can be used include glass, stainless steel, carbon steel, Hastelloy, materials comprising a base material lined with glass, and those provided with a Teflon (registered trademark) coating.<br><br>
Acarbamic acid ester produced in a method exemplified above may be subjected to a decomposition reaction as is, or may be subjected to a decomposition reaction after having purified the carbamic acid ester.    Examples of methods for purifying the carbamic acid ester from the reaction liquid include known methods such as methods for distilling off low boiling point components such as hydroxy compounds, urea compounds and carbonic acid esters by distillation, methods involving washing with a solvent, and purification by crystallization.    In addition, in the case of using the catalyst in the production of carbamic acid ester, the catalyst can also be used as the catalyst of a thermal decomposition reaction depending on the case, or the catalyst for use in a thermal decomposition reaction may be added while still present, or the catalyst may not be used in the thermal decomposition reaction.    In addition, the catalyst used in the production of carbamic acid ester may also be removed.    In the case of using a basic catalyst, since there are cases in which a reaction attributable to the catalyst occurs during the thermal decomposition reaction resulting in a decrease in yield, the thermal decomposition reaction is carried out after removing the catalyst in such cases.   A known method can be used to remove the catalyst.   A preferable example of such a method involves neutralizing the catalyst by treating with an organic acid or an inorganic acid in a homogeneous or heterogeneous phase.   An acid used for this purpose is preferably a mono- or dicarboxylic acid, ion exchange resin type of alkyl- or arylsulfonic acid, or phosphoric acid.   Although removal of the catalyst may be carried out within the range of normal temperature to 200°C, since there are cases in which the formed carbamic acid is solidified or denatured, it is preferable to continue to carry out the reaction while maintaining the temperature at which the formed carbamic acid ester does not precipitate from the reaction liquid of the carbamic acid ester production step after having carried out the carbamic acid ester production step.   Next, the carbamic acid<br><br>
ester is subjected to (thermal) decomposition step after having removed raw materials used in excess.<br><carbonicacid derivative><br>

In the present embodiment, some compounds having an active proton may be susceptible to a reaction presumed to occur due to thermal denaturation depending on the conditions of the thermal decomposition reaction during thermal decomposition of carbamic acid ester in the presence of the compound having an active proton depending on the compound having the active proton.   The inventors of the present invention unexpectedly found that, in the case of carrying out thermal decomposition of carbamic acid ester in the presence of the carbonic acid derivatives described above, not only is this thermal denaturation less likely to occur, but also that the yield of isocyanate is improved.   Although mechanism by which isocyanate yield is improved is unclear, the inventors of the present invention presumed that since the compound having the active proton is less susceptible to thermal<br><br>
denaturation due to the presence of specific carbonic acid derivatives, the formation of high boiling point substances caused by a reaction between a heat-denatured compound having an active proton and carbamic acid ester and / or isocyanate is inhibited.<br><carbamicacid ester decomposition reaction><br>
The following provides an explanation of the carbamic acid ester decomposition reaction in the present embodiment.<br>
The decomposition reaction in the present embodiment is a thermal decomposition reaction in which a corresponding isocyanate and a hydroxy compound (alcohol or aromatic hydroxy compound originating from the carbamic acid ester) are formed from a carbamic acid ester.<br>
This thermal decomposition reaction is carried out in the presence of the compound having the active proton, or in the presence of the compound having the active proton and the carbonic acid derivative, as described above.<br>
Although varying according to the compounds used, the reaction conditions are such that the amount of the compound having the active proton used is preferably from 1 to 100 times the carbamic acid ester in terms of the stoichiometric ratio. Although the amount of compound having the active proton used is preferably large from the viewpoint of inhibiting side reactions as described above, in consideration of the size of the reaction vessel and the like, the amount used is more preferably from 2 to 80 times and even more preferably from 2 to 50 times.    In addition, the amount of the carbonic acid derivative used is preferably from 0.00001 to 0.1 times the compound having the active proton in terms of the stoichiometric ratio.   Although some specific compounds having the active proton are susceptible to the occurrence of a reaction presumed to be caused by thermal denaturation during the thermal<br><br>
decomposition reaction, in the case of carrying out thermal decomposition of the carbamic acid ester in the presence of the carbonic acid derivative as previously described, the carbonic acid derivative has the effect of making it difficult for this thermal denaturation to occur.   On the other hand, in the case of using a large amount of the carbonic acid derivative, there are cases in which the carbonic acid derivative reacts with the specific compound having the active proton, resulting in the formation of ether or ammonia.   Thus, the amount of the carbonic acid derivative used is more preferably from 0.00005 to 0.05 times and even more preferably from 0.0001 to 0.01 times.    In the case the carbonic acid derivative is contained in the carbamic acid ester during production of carbamic acid ester according to the method exemplified above, the carbonic acid derivative may be used as is, or carbonic acid derivative may be newly added to the carbamic acid ester.   A specific compound having the active proton susceptible to thermal denaturation as described above refers to a compound such as an aromatic hydroxy compound substituted with a branched alkyl group.    Since there are cases in which a dealkenylation reaction occurs, the formation of alkene is less likely to occur in such cases if the carbonic acid derivative is present.   Although the reason for this is unclear, this dealkenylation reaction is presumed to originate from the catalyst within the system or metal ions eluted in trace amounts from the structural material of the reaction vessel, and it is presumed that the carbonic acid derivative traps these components. Although the dealkenylation reaction as described above is not observed in the case of, for example, the aromatic hydroxy compound substituted with a group other than a branched alkyl group, since there are cases in which the yield of isocyanate formed during thermal decomposition of carbamic acid ester in the presence of the aromatic hydroxy compound decreases, it is presumed that the aromatic hydroxy compound is also subjected to some form of thermal denaturation resulting in the<br><br>
formation of thermal denaturation products.    Side reactions between these thermal denaturation products and carbamic acid ester and / or isocyanate are then presumed to occur.    In such cases as well, since the presence of the carbonic acid derivative is observed to result in an improvement of isocyanate yield, similar to the case of the aromatic hydroxy compound substituted with the branched alkyl group, the carbonic acid derivative is presumed to have the effect of reducing the likelihood of the occurrence of thermal denaturation of the aromatic hydroxy compound even in the case of aromatic hydroxy compounds substituted with the group other than the branched alkyl group.<br>
The carbonic acid derivative need not be used in the case of using a specific compound having an active proton not subjected to thermal denaturation.<br>
The reaction temperature is generally within the range of from 100 to 400°C, and although higher temperatures are preferable for accelerating the reaction rate, since side reactions as described above may be caused by carbamic acid ester and / or the product in the form of isocyanate at high temperatures, the reaction temperature is preferably within the range of from 130 to 300°C and more preferably within the range of from 150 to 250°C.   A known cooling apparatus or heating apparatus may be installed in the reaction vessel to maintain a constant reaction temperature.   In addition, although varying according to the types of compounds used and reaction temperature, the reaction pressure may be decreased pressure, normal pressure or applied pressure, and the reaction is generally carried out at a pressure within the range of from 20 to 1 x 106 Pa.   There are no particular limitations on the reaction time (residence time in the case of a continuous method), and is generally from 0.001 to 100 hours, preferably from 0.01 to 50 hours and more preferably from 0.1 to 30 hours.   A catalyst can be used in the present embodiment, and the catalyst is used at from 0.01 to 30% by weight and preferably from 0.5 to<br><br>
20% by weight, based on the weight of carbamic acid ester.    For example, organic metal catalysts such as dibutyl tin dilaurate, ferrous octoate or stannous octoate, or amines such as 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane, triethylenediamine or triethylamine are suitable for use, the organic metal catalysts such as dibutyl tin dilaurate, ferrous octoate or stannous octoate being particularly preferable.   These compounds may be used alone, or two or more types of these compounds may be used as a mixture.<br>
A solvent can also be used in the present embodiment, and examples of solvents that can be used include alkanes such as pentane (including isomers), hexane (including isomers), heptane (including isomers), octane (including isomers), nonane (including isomers), decane (including isomers) or the like; aromatic hydrocarbons and alkyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene (including isomers), ethyl benzene, diisopropyl benzene (including isomers), dibutyl benzene (including isomers), naphthalene or the like; nitrile compounds such as acetonitrile, benzonitrile or the like; aromatic compounds substituted with a halogen or nitro group such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene (including isomers), bromobenzene, dibromobenzene (including isomers), chloronaphthalene, bromonaphthalene, nitrobenzene, nitronaphthalene or the like; polycyclic hydrocarbon compounds such as diphenyl, substituted diphenyl, diphenyl methane, terphenyl, anthracene, dibenzyl toluene (including isomers) or the like; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, cyclopentane, cyclooctane, ethylcyclohexane or the like; alicyclic alcohols such as cyclohexanol, cyclopentanol, cyclooctanol or the like; ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone, acetophenone or the like; esters such as dibutyl phthalate, dihexyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, benzylbutyl phthalate or the like; ethers and thioethers such as tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, diphenyl ether, diphenylsulfide or the like; ketone compounds such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or the like; ester compounds such as ethyl<br><br>
acetate, ethyl benzoate or the like; and sulfoxides such as dimethylsulfoxide, diphenylsulfoxide or the like.   However, since the procedures become complex during separation and recovery of the hydroxy compound, the thermal decomposition reaction of carbamic acid ester is preferably carried out without using a solvent.<br>
Although the thermal decomposition reaction of the present embodiment is a reaction by which the corresponding isocyanate and the hydroxy compound are formed from the carbamic acid ester as previously described, this thermal decomposition reaction is an equilibrium reaction.   Thus, in order to efficiently obtain isocyanate in this thermal decomposition reaction, it is preferable to remove at least one of the products of the thermal decomposition reaction in the form of the isocyanate or the hydroxy compound from the thermal decomposition reaction system in the form of a gaseous component using a method such as distillation. Which of the isocyanate or hydroxy compound is removed can be arbitrarily determined according to the compounds used.   For example, a comparison may be made of the standard boiling points of the isocyanate and the hydroxy compound, and the compound having the lower standard boiling point may be removed as a gaseous component.<br>
The thermal decomposition reaction is preferably carried out by a continuous method.   The continuous method refers to a method in which the carbamic acid ester is continuously supplied to a reaction vessel where it is subjected to the thermal decomposition reaction, at least one of the isocyanate or hydroxy compound formed is removed from the reaction vessel in the form of a gaseous component, and a portion or all of a solution containing the carbamic acid ester and / or compound having thetive proton is removed from the bottom of the reaction vessel.<br>
In the case thermal decomposition reaction is carried out on the carbamic acid ester using the continuous method, the carbamic acid ester is preferably is supplied<br><br>
to the reaction vessel where the thermal decomposition reaction is carried out in the form of a mixture with the carbonic acid derivative.   The carbamic acid ester is more preferably supplied to the reaction vessel where the thermal decomposition reaction is carried out in the form of a mixture with the carbonic acid derivative and the compound having the active proton.   There are many cases in which the carbamic acid ester is a solid at normal temperatures (for example, 25°C).    In general, the reactants are preferably liquids in the case of continuously supplying the reactants to the reaction vessel.   The carbamic acid ester is preferably a liquid when continuously supplying the carbamic acid ester to the reaction vessel in this thermal decomposition reaction as well.   Thus, there are many cases in which the carbamic acid ester is supplied to the reaction vessel in a state of being held to a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point of the carbamic acid ester (for example, 150°C).    However, if the carbamic acid ester is held under such temperature conditions for a long period of time, this may lead to the occurrence of side reactions as previously described, resulting in a decrease in the final yield of isocyanate. The inventors of the present invention unexpectedly found that when the carbamic acid ester is in the form of a mixture with the compound having the active proton, or more preferably, a mixture with the carbonic acid derivative and the compound having the active proton, there is less likelihood of the above-mentioned side reactions occurring even in the case of being held under temperature conditions as described above for a long period of time.   Although the mechanism by which these compounds having the active proton inhibit side reactions is unclear, the inventors of the present invention presumed that, for example, in a reaction that forms a urea bond as represented by the above-mentioned formula (2), as a result of a urethane bond (-NHCOO-) of the carbamic acid ester and the hydroxy compound forming the hydrogen bond, since the urethane bonds are formed in a state in which<br><br>
it is difficult for them to approach each other, it is difficult for the reaction resulting in the formation of urea bonds to occur.<br>
In addition, since compounds having the active proton used in the present embodiment have good solubility with respect to carbamic acid esters, carbamic acid ester can be supplied to the reaction vessel where the thermal decomposition reaction is carried out in the form of a homogeneous solution of the carbamic acid ester and the compound having the active proton, thereby resulting in a simpler procedure.<br>
In the case the carbamic acid ester is supplied to the reaction vessel where the thermal decomposition reaction is carried out in the form of a mixture with the carbonic acid derivative and the compound having the active proton, the entire amount of the compound having the active proton used may be supplied to the reaction vessel in the form of a mixture of the carbamic acid ester, the carbonic acid derivative and the compound having the active proton, or a portion of the compound having the active proton used may be added to the reaction vessel in advance, followed by adding the remainder to the reaction vessel in the form of said mixture.<br>
Although any known material may be used for the reaction vessel and lines used to carry out the thermal decomposition reaction provided it does not have a detrimental effect on the carbamic acid ester or products in the form of the hydroxy compound and isocyanate, SUS304, SUS316, SUS316L or the like can be used preferably since they are inexpensive.   There are no particular limitations on the type of reaction vessel, and a known tank reactor or a column reactor can be used. A reaction vessel is preferably used that is provided with lines for removing a low boiling point mixture containing at least one of the isocyanate and the hydroxy compound formed in the thermal decomposition reaction from the reaction vessel in the form of a gaseous component, and for removing all or a portion of a mixed liquid<br><br>
containing unreacted carbamic acid ester and compounds not removed in the form of gaseous components from the bottom of the reaction vessel in the form of a liquid. Various known methods are used for such a reaction vessel, examples of which include types using reaction vessels containing a stirring tank, a multistage stirring tank, a distillation column, a multistage distillation column, a multitubular reactor, a continuous multistage distillation column, a packed column, a thin film evaporator, a reactor provided with a support inside, a forced circulation reactor, a falling film evaporator, a falling drop evaporator, a trickle flow reactor or a bubble column, and types using combinations thereof.    Methods using the thin film evaporator or the columnar reactor are preferable from the viewpoint of rapidly removing low boiling point components from the reaction system, a structure having a large gas-liquid contact area being preferable for being able to rapidly transfer the low boiling point components formed to the gaseous phase.<br>
The reaction vessel is preferably provided with a line for supplying carbamic acid ester, a line for removing a gaseous component containing at least one of the isocyanate and the hydroxy compound formed by the thermal decomposition reaction, and a line for removing mixed liquid containing compounds not removed in the form of gaseous components, unreacted carbamic acid ester and the compound having an active proton, and a line for removing gaseous components containing at least one of the isocyanate and the hydroxy compound is preferably at a location that allows gaseous components in the reaction vessel to be removed, and the line for removing a mixed liquid containing compounds not removed in the form of gaseous components, unreacted carbamic acid ester and the compound having the active proton is particularly preferably located there below.<br>
In addition, a line for supplying inert gas and / or liquid inert solvent from the lower portion of the reaction vessel may be separately attached, or a line may be<br><br>
attached for recirculating all or a portion of the mixed liquid containing unreacted carbamic acid ester and/or the compound having the active proton to the reaction vessel.   Warming, cooling or heating equipment may be added to each line in consideration of clogging and the like.<br>
The isocyanate obtained in the production process as described above can be preferably used as a production raw material of polyurethane foam, paints, adhesives or the like.    Since this process enables isocyanate to be efficiently produced without using extremely toxic phosgene, the present invention is industrially extremely significant.<br>

Reference Example 1 : Production of Bis(3-methylbutyl) Carbonate ■ Step (1-1): Production of Dialkyl Tin Catalyst 625 g (2.7 mol) of di-n-butyl tin oxide (Sankyo Organic Chemicals Co., Ltd., Japan) and 2020 g (22.7 mol) of 3-methyl-1-butanol (Kuraray Co., Ltd., Japan) were placed in a 5000 mL volumetric pear-shaped flask.   The flask was connected to an evaporator (R-144, Shibata Co., Ltd., Japan) to which was connected an oil bath (OBH-24, Masuda Corp., Japan) equipped with a temperature controller, a vacuum pump (G-50A, Ulvac Inc., Japan) and a vacuum controller (VC-10S, Okano Seisakusho Co., Ltd.).   The purge valve outlet of this evaporator was connected to a line containing nitrogen gas flowing at normal pressure.   After closing the purge valve of the evaporator to reduce pressure inside the system, the purge valve was opened gradually to allow nitrogen to flow into the system and return to normal pressure.   The oil bath temperature was set to about 145°C, the flask was immersed in the oil bath and rotation of the evaporator was started.   After heating for about 40 minutes in the presence of atmospheric pressure nitrogen with the purge valve of the evaporator left open, distillation of 3-methyl-1-butanol containing water began.   After maintaining in this state for 7 hours, the purge valve was closed, pressure inside the<br><br>
system was gradually reduced, and excess 3-methyl-1 -butanol was distilled with the pressure inside the system at 74 to 35 kPa.   After the fraction no longer appeared, the flask was taken out of the oil bath.   After allowing the flask to cool to the vicinity of room temperature (25°C), the flask was taken out of the oil bath, the purge valve was opened gradually and the pressure inside the system was returned to atmospheric pressure.    1173 g of reaction liquid were obtained in the flask.    Based on the results of 119Sn, 1H and 13C-NMR analyses, 1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) distannoxane was confirmed to have been obtained at a yield of 99% based on di-n-butyl tin oxide.   The same procedure was then repeated 12 times to obtain a total of 10335 g of 1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) distannoxane.<br>

The liquid temperature inside reaction vessel 102 was controlled to 160°C by a heater and a reboiler 112, and the pressure was adjusted to about 120 kPa-G with a pressure control valve.   The residence time in the reaction vessel was about 17 minutes.   3-Methyl-1 -butanol containing water at the rate of 15037 g / hr from the top of the reaction vessel via a transfer line 6, and 3-methyl-1-butanol at the rate of 825 g / hr via feed line 1, were pumped to distillation column 101 packed with Metal Gauze CY Packing and provided with a reboiler 111 and a condenser 121 to carry out<br><br>
distillative purification.    In the top of distillation column 101, a fraction containing a high concentration of water was condensed by condenser 121 and recovered from a recovery line 3.    Purified 3-methyl-1 -butanol was pumped to column-type reaction vessel 102 via transfer line 2 located in the bottom of distillation column 101.   An alkyl tin alkoxide catalyst composition containing di-n-butyl-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) tin and 1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) distannoxane was obtained from the bottom of column-type reaction vessel 102, and supplied to a thin film evaporator 103 (Kobelco Eco-Solutions Co., Ltd., Japan) via a transfer line 5.   The 3-methyl-1 -butanol was distilled off in thin film evaporator 103 and returned to column-type reaction vessel 102 via a condenser 123, a transfer line 8 and transfer line 4.   The alkyl tin alkoxide catalyst composition was pumped from the bottom of thin film evaporator 103 via a transfer line 7 and supplied to an autoclave 104 while adjusting the flow rate of di-n-butyl-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) tin and 1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) distannoxane to about 5130 g / hr.    Carbon dioxide was supplied to the autoclave by a transfer line 9 at the rate of 973 g / hr, and the pressure inside the autoclave was maintained at 4 MPa-G.   The temperature inside the autoclave was set to 120°C, the residence time was adjusted to about 4 hours, and a reaction between the carbon dioxide and the alkyl tin alkoxide catalyst composition was carried out to obtain a reaction liquid containing bis(3-methylbutyl) carbonate.   This reaction liquid was transferred to a decarbonization tank 105 via a transfer line 10 and a control valve to remove residual carbon dioxide, and the carbon dioxide was recovered from a transfer line 11.   Subsequently, the reaction liquid was transferred to a thin film evaporator (Kobelco Eco-Solutions Co., Ltd., Japan) 106 set to about 142°C and about 0.5 kPa via a transfer line 12 and supplied while adjusting the flow rate of 1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) distannoxane to about 4388 g / hr to obtain a fraction containing bis(3-methylbutyl)<br><br>
carbonate.    On the other hand, the evaporation residue was circulated to column-type reaction vessel 102 via transfer line 13 and transfer line 4 while adjusting the flow rate of 1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) distannoxane to about 4388 g / hr.   The fraction containing bis(3-methylbutyl) carbonate was supplied to a distillation column 107 packed with Metal Gauze CY packing and equipped with a reboiler 117 and a condenser 127 via a condenser 126 and a transfer line 14 at the rate of 959 g / hr followed by distillative purification to obtain 99 wt% bis(3-methylbutyl) carbonate from a recovery line 15 at the rate of 944 g / hr. When the alkyl tin alkoxide catalyst composition of a transfer line 13 was analyzed by 119Sn, 1H and 13C-NMR analysis, it was found to contain 1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) distannoxane but not contain di-n-butyl-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) tin.   After carrying out the above-mentioned continuous operation for about 240 hours, alkyl tin alkoxide catalyst composition was extracted from an extraction line 16 at the rate of 18 g / hr, while 1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-bis(3-methylbutyloxy) distannoxane produced according to the above process was supplied from a feed line 17 at the rate of 18 g /hr.<br>

The flask containing the white, slurry-like mixture was attached to an evaporator to which was connected an oil bath equipped with a temperature controller, a vacuum pump and a vacuum controller.   The purge valve outlet of this evaporator was connected to a line containing nitrogen gas flowing at normal pressure.   After closing the purge valve of the evaporator and reducing pressure<br><br>
inside the system, the purge valve was opened gradually to allow nitrogen to flow into the system and return to normal pressure.   The oil bath temperature was set to about 126°C, the flask was immersed in the oil bath and rotation of the evaporator was started.   After rotating, stirring and heating for about 30 minutes at normal pressure with the purge valve of the evaporator left open, the mixture boiled and distillation of the low boiling point component began.   After maintaining in this state for 8 hours, the purge valve was closed, pressure inside the system was gradually reduced, and residual low boiling point component was distilled off with the pressure inside the system at 76 to 54 kPa.   After the low boiling point component no longer appeared, the flask was taken out of the oil bath.   The reaction liquid was in the form of a clear liquid.   The flask was subsequently taken out of the oil bath, the purge valve was opened gradually and the pressure inside the system was returned to normal pressure.    952 g of Reaction liquid were obtained in the flask.

The temperature inside the autoclave was set to 120°C, the residence time was adjusted to about 4 hours, and a reaction between the carbon dioxide and the alkyl tin alkoxide catalyst composition was carried out to obtain a reaction liquid containing dibutyl carbonate. This reaction liquid was transferred to decarbonization tank 105 via transfer line 10<br><br>
and a control valve to remove residual carbon dioxide, and the carbon dioxide was recovered from transfer line 11.   Subsequently, the reaction liquid was pumped to thin film evaporator 106 (Kobelco Eco-Solutions Co., Ltd., Japan) set to 140°C and about 1.4 kPa via transfer line 12 and supplied while adjusting the flow rate of the 1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-di(n-butyloxy) distannoxane to about 4201 g / hr to obtain a fraction containing dibutyl carbonate.    On the other hand, the evaporation residue was circulated to column-type reaction vessel 102 via transfer line 13 and transfer line 4 while adjusting the flow rate of 1,1,3,3-tetra-n-butyl-1,3-di(n-butyloxy) distannoxane to about 4201 g / hr.

hexamethylene diamine (Aldrich Corp., USA) were placed in a 5 L volumetric four-mouth flask, a stirrer was placed in the flask, and a Dimroth condenser and a three-way valve were attached to the flask.   After replacing the inside of the system with nitrogen, the four-mouth flask was immersed in an oil bath (OBH-24, Masuda Corp., Japan) heated to 80°C followed by the addition of 40.5 g of sodium methoxide (28% methanol solution, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan) to start the reaction.    Samples of the reaction liquid were suitably collected and subjected to NMR analysis, and the reaction was terminated at the time when hexamethylene diamine was no longer detected.   As a result of analyzing the resulting solution by liquid chromatography, the solution was found to contain 29.9% by weight of N,N'-hexanediyl-bis-carbamic acid di(3-methylbutyl) ester.   The solution was supplied to a column which was packed with an acidic sulfonic acid ion exchange resin (Amberlyst-15 (spheres), Rohm and Haas Co.) adjusted by removing moisture and warmed to 65°C with an external jacket, to obtain a solution in which the sodium methoxide had been neutralized.<br>
■ Step (1-2): Distillation of Low Boiling Point Component The solution obtained in step (1-1) was placed in a 5 L volumetric flask equipped with a three-way valve, a condenser, a distillate collector and a thermometer, and the inside of the flask was replaced with nitrogen in a vacuum. The flask was immersed in an oil bath heated to about 130°C.   Distillation was carried out while gradually reducing the pressure in the flask to a final pressure of 0.02 kPa.    1640 g of distillate were obtained.   As a result of analyzing by gas chromatography, the distillate was found to be a solution containing 77.6% by weight of bis(3-methylbutyl) carbonate and 22.2% by weight of 3-methyl-1 -butanol.    In addition, as a result of analyzing the distillation residue obtained in the flask by liquid chromatography, the distillation residue was found to contain 93.9% by weight of<br><br>
N,N'-hexanediyl-bis- carbamic acid bis(3-methylbutyl) ester.

2450 g of 2,4-di-terf-amylphenol (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Japan) and 66.1 g of dibutyl tin dilaurate (chemical grade, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan) were added to the distillation residue obtained in step (1-2) to obtain a homogeneous solution.   When this was analyzed by gas chromatography, the solution was found to contain bis(3-methylbutyl) carbonate at a stoichiometric ratio of 0.0020 to 2,4-di-ferf-amylphenol.<br>
A thermal decomposition reaction was then carried out with a reaction apparatus as shown in FIG. 2 using this solution.<br>

A gaseous component consisting of hexamethylene diisocyanate, 3-methyl-1 -butanol and 2,4-di-terf-amylphenol was extracted from line 22 provided in the upper portion of thin film distillation apparatus 202.   This gaseous component was introduced into a distillation column 203, the 3-methyl-1-butanol was separated, and a portion of the high boiling point component was returned to feed tank 201 through line 24 via a line<br><br>
