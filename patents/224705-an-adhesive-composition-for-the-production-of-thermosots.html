Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an adhesive composition which contains<br>
inductively heatable filler particles, and to its use and a process for its<br>
curing. The invention also relates to an adhesive composite that contains a<br>
hardened layer of the adhesive composition, a process for the thermal<br>
dissociation of the hardened adhesive composition, and the use of this<br>
process.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Adhesive bonds, i.e. in particular bonded joints, coatings, laminates or cast<br>
structural parts are designed so that they can be produced under mild<br>
conditions, are resistant for as long as possible and have the highest possible<br>
strengths. High strengths mean that, in the case of a repair or recycling, a<br>
dissociation of the adhesive bond can be carried out only under extreme<br>
conditions, such as for example the action of strong forces or high<br>
temperatures. Bonded joints based on hard adhesives are generally<br>
dissociable, but are not suitable for transmitting the high forces necessary for<br>
structural bonded joints. The dissociation of high-strength bonded joints is<br>
generally accomplished by the use of mechanical energy or chemical agents.<br>
The latter have the disadvantage that they cause a high environmental<br>
pollution and also that the penetration of the agents into the<br>
gluelines of structural bonded joints that are stable over<br>
the long term takes far too long.<br>
DE 43 28 108 A describes the dissociation of floor<br>
coverings by means of microwave energy. For this purpose a<br>
contact adhesive is used that is electrically conducting<br>
and is filled with copper powder or aluminium powder.<br>
These fillers have the disadvantage that the particles have<br>
sizes of a few micrometres and larger. This leads to a<br>
non-uniform heating of the contact adhesive.<br>
DE 199 61 940 Al describes adhesives for dissociable bonded<br>
joints that contain thermally activatable substances that<br>
release gaseous compounds when they decompose, which then<br>
destroy the bonded joints. This process has the<br>
disadvantage that in order to separate the composite, the<br>
whole structural part or the joined parts and the adhesive<br>
have to be heated. This is associated with a high energy<br>
expenditure. Furthermore it is not possible to achieve a<br>
locally restricted separation of the structural part or of<br>
the joined part.<br>
DE 199 51 599 Al and DE 199 24 138 Al describe adhesives<br>
for dissociable bonded joints and bonded joints produced<br>
therewith, that contain externally excitable nanofillers.<br>
The dissociation of the bonded joints is achieved by<br>
introducing the joints into an alternating electrical,<br>
magnetic or electromagnetic field, whereby the nanofillers<br>
and the surrounding adhesive are heated. This process has<br>
the disadvantage however that it leads to the heating of<br>
the whole adhesive, also at places at which no heating is<br>
necessary or desirable, since the excitable nanofillers are<br>
also contained in places in the adhesive or primer where<br>
heating is not necessary in order to achieve the desired<br>
dissociation of the bonded joint. Furthermore high<br>
temperatures are required to separate high-strength bonded<br>
joints since chemical bonds have to be broken in order to<br>
break down the composite. The described processes<br>
furthermore have the disadvantage that a non-specific<br>
thermal decomposition of the adhesive and/or primer occurs<br>
when separating high-strength bonded joints. Such<br>
processes are therefore unsuitable in particular for<br>
thermosets.<br>
The production of resistant, high-strength adhesive Joints<br>
is normally carried out thermally or photochemically. The<br>
conventional processes for producing adhesive bonded joints<br>
have the disadvantage however that the whole structural<br>
part has to be heated in order to cure the adhesive. As a<br>
result the process is enerqy intensive and time-consuming<br>
WO 99/03306 and 0. Hahn, A. Kaimann in Adhasion - Kleben<br>
und Dichten, 10/2001, pp. 35-38 describe a process for the<br>
inductive curing of adhesive joints. In this case<br>
adhesives that contain inductively activatable fillers are<br>
introduced into an electromagnetic field, whereby the<br>
inductively activatable fillers are heated and the<br>
hardening of the adhesive surrounding the fillers can take<br>
place. These processes have the disadvantage however that<br>
the inductively activatable substances are not uniformly<br>
distributed over the adhesive and accordingly there is an<br>
inhomogeneous heating of the adhesive. As a result, the<br>
strength of such adhesive joints is limited. The processes<br>
furthermore have the disadvantage that a demixing<br>
(separation) may occur in the adhesive during the inductive<br>
heating process and the distribution of the thermally<br>
activatable substances in the adhesive becomes even more irregular.<br>
Outline of the Invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to overcome the disadvantages of the<br>
prior art and to provide an adhesive composition that can be hardened under<br>
mild conditions to form a resistant, high-strength adhesive joint. A further<br>
object of the present invention is to provide a process for dissociating such<br>
adhesive joints without the long-term resistance of the adhesive joint<br>
inevitably suffering thereby.<br>
These objects are achieved by the adhesive composition the process for their<br>
curing the adhesive composite and the process for the thermal dissociation of<br>
the hardened adhesive composition. Uses of the adhesive composition and of<br>
the process for dissociating the hardened adhesive composition are<br>
mentioned in details in the specification. The subclaims disclose<br>
advantageous modifications.<br>
It was found that adhesive compositions that contain a polymer, a polymer<br>
mixture or a reaction resin, as well as particles of crosslinking agent, can be<br>
heated by means of an electrical field, magnetic field, electromagnetic field,<br>
alternating electrical field, alternating magnetic field or alternating<br>
electromagnetic field. The particles of crosslinking agent consist in this<br>
connection of filler particles that are metallic, ferromagnetic, ferromagnetic,<br>
superparamagnetic or paramagnetic, as well as crosslinking<br>
agent units that are chemically bound to the filler<br>
particles.<br>
A chemical reaction between the crosslinking agent unit anc<br>
the polymer or the polymer mixture is triggered by<br>
inductive heating of the particles of crosslinking agent,<br>
whereby a polymer network is formed.<br>
Adhesive compositions within the meaning of the present<br>
invention include in particular adhesives, paints, primers,<br>
casting compositions, sealants and laminating resins. In<br>
particular bonded joints, painted structural parts or<br>
structural parts provided with a primer, cast structural<br>
parts, sealed structural parts or polymer laminates are<br>
thereby formed by curing these adhesive compositions. As<br>
polymers, polymer mixtures and reaction resins within the<br>
meaning of the present invention there may be used all<br>
polymers, polymer mixtures and reaction resins that are<br>
considered suitable for the aforementioned applications.<br>
Preferred are crosslinked polymers, particularly preferably<br>
polymers or reaction resins from which structural or<br>
semi-structural joints can be produced. In particular<br>
epoxide resins, polyurethanes, acrylates, phenol resins,<br>
polysulfides or melamine resins are suitable.<br>
According to the invention the filler particles are<br>
chemically bound to the crosslinking agent component. This<br>
chemical bonding may be of an ionic, co-ordinative or<br>
covalent nature. Van-der-Waals interactions for example<br>
are also included under this heading.<br>
In order to produce the chemical bonds according to the<br>
invention it is advantageous if the surfaces of the filler<br>
particles are surface-modified, i.e. if they carry<br>
functional groups on their surface that can readily react<br>
with functional groups of the crosslinking agent unit. The<br>
crosslinking agent unit for its part carries at least one<br>
functional group that on heating can undergo crosslinking<br>
reactions with the polymer, the polymer mixture or the<br>
reactive resin. The heating may in this connection be<br>
accomplished either inductively or also in a conventional<br>
way. Suitable functional groups that undergo crosslinking<br>
reactions include for example epoxide, amino, thiol,<br>
alcohol, acrylate, methacrylate or vinyl groups.<br>
Chemical groups bound to the crosslinking agent unit that<br>
can react with the filler surface are in particular<br>
alkoxysilanes, alkoxy titanates and alkoxy zirconates.<br>
These lead to a bonding to the normally metallic or oxidic<br>
surface of the filler particles.<br>
Filler particles consisting of inductively excitable<br>
materials in the interior of the particles as well as of a<br>
particle surface predominantly of silicon dioxide are<br>
particularly preferred. They may be used in spherical or<br>
aggregated form. The predominantly spherical filler<br>
particles with a core-shell structure (see Fig. 1A,<br>
Fig. 2A) can be obtained for example via sol-gel processes<br>
or from the reaction of nanoscale iron oxide with sodium<br>
silicate; the aggregated filler particles with a silicon<br>
dioxide surface (Fig. 1B, Fig. 2B) are preferably obtained<br>
by means of gas phase synthesis. These particles are<br>
hereinafter termed composite particles. These composite<br>
particles consist of aggregates that exhibit the<br>
characteristic "sinter neck"; multiple inclusions or domains<br>
of the inductively excitable material are found distributed<br>
in the interior of the aggregates, while on the surface the<br>
composite particles consist largely of silicon dioxide.<br>
Particles with silicon dioxide on the surface have a high<br>
long-term resistance, with respect to moisture, of the bond<br>
between the crosslinking agent unit and the filler particle<br>
surface and react rapidly with the aforementioned chemical<br>
groups. Furthermore, the silicon dioxide layer protects<br>
the inductively excitable components against chemical<br>
attack by constituents of the formulation.<br>
The crosslinking agent particles according to the invention<br>
can be used for example as crosslinking agents for epoxide<br>
resins. This epoxide resin may for example be a<br>
bisphenol A diglycidyl ether hardened with a diamine. By<br>
using such crosslinking agent particles a thermoset is<br>
obtained that can be subjected to high chemical and thermal<br>
stress. An individual crosslinking agent particle with<br>
epoxide groups is shown diagrammatically by way of example<br>
in Fig. 1A. The filler particles may also be present in<br>
the form of agglomerates, as shown in Fig. 2A. Fig. 2A<br>
shows diagrammatically a section from an agglomerate of<br>
iron oxide particles in a silicon dioxide matrix.<br>
The adhesive compositions according to the invention have<br>
the advantage that the distribution of the filler particles<br>
is such that they are located only at those places where<br>
their action is necessary, namely in the crosslinking agent<br>
particles. Compared to the previously known adhesive<br>
compositions, the filler particles are in this case in<br>
direct (i.e. molecular or almost molecular) contact at<br>
those places at which their effect is to be manifested. In<br>
this way a non-specific heating of the whole polymer is<br>
avoided during inductive heating. The adhesive<br>
compositions according to the invention may therefore be<br>
inductively hardened under mild conditions.<br>
In addition the adhesive compositions according to the<br>
invention have the advantage that adhesive joints produced<br>
therefrom can also be inductively and cleanly re-separated,<br>
with savings in time and energy, without having to add<br>
substances that facilitate a separation. Here too the<br>
heating takes place selectively on a molecular level at the<br>
site at which the bonds are to be broken. This has the<br>
advantage that the whole polymer is not destroyed, as would<br>
be the case for example if it were heated with a welding<br>
torch or laser. A non-selective thermal decomposition of<br>
the polymer can thereby be avoided.<br>
Naturally, a lower induction output, i.e. for example a<br>
lower output of the high-frequency generator, is necessary<br>
for the crosslinking or curing than for the separation of<br>
the adhesive joint.<br>
According to the invention, in particular adhesive<br>
compositions are suitable that have a content of<br>
crosslinking agent particles of 0.1 to 80%, preferably 0.5<br>
to 40% and particularly preferably 1% to 30%. By<br>
increasing the content of crosslinking agent particles or<br>
crosslinking agent units, a higher degree of crosslinking<br>
and thus a higher strength is achieved-.<br>
Advantageously the crosslinking agent particles have an<br>
average primary particle size, i.e. an average primary<br>
particles diameter, of less than 1000 nm, preferably less<br>
than 500 nm and particularly preferably between 2 nm and<br>
100 nm. A uniform crosslinking of the adhesive composition<br>
according to the invention is achieved in this way.<br>
Furthermore, such small particle sizes are most suitable<br>
from the point of view of energy economy.<br>
The filler particles according to the invention may be<br>
present in an agglomerated state if the dispersion quality<br>
is insufficient. The crosslinking agent particles<br>
preferably comprise at least three functional groups having<br>
a crosslinking action, a thermoset thereby being formed. A<br>
thermoset is then generally obtained if three chemical<br>
groups (polymer systems curing by polycondensation or by<br>
polyaddition) or possibly even two chemical groups (polymer<br>
systems curing by polymerisation) are bound to the<br>
crosslinking agent. According to the invention adhesive<br>
compositions with crosslinking agent particles that have,<br>
referred to their surface, at least 0.00001 mmole x m-2<br>
functional groups having a crosslinking action, are<br>
preferred. Typically the density of the groups having a<br>
crosslinking action is in the range from 0.1 to 1 mmole per<br>
100m2 of specific surface of the crosslinking agent<br>
particle. The crosslinking agent particles according to<br>
the invention consequently form after the curing reaction a<br>
stellate crosslinking centre in the polymer network. If<br>
the functional groups on the crosslinking agent units are<br>
for example epoxide groups, then these may be employed with<br>
BF3 etherate as curing catalyst for crosslinking<br>
monofunctional epoxide resins. After curing, a thermoset<br>
is then formed; without the crosslinking agent particles<br>
according to the invention only a linear polymer capable of<br>
withstanding slight stress would be formed.<br>
The adhesive compositions according to the invention<br>
preferably contain filler particles that are surface-<br>
modified and are selected from the group comprising iron,<br>
iron alloys and iron-containing metal oxides. Suitable for<br>
example are filler particles that are based on iron powder,<br>
magnetite powder, superparamagnetic iron oxide or<br>
manganese-zinc-iron oxide. For example, nanoscale<br>
magnetite powder with a silicon dioxide shell may be<br>
surface-modified or functionalised with epoxide groups by<br>
reaction with 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane. If a<br>
sol-gel process is used a reaction with an epoxysilane may<br>
at the same time also take place, which means that a<br>
reaction step can be omitted. However, another functional<br>
silane may also be used for a one-stage or two-stage<br>
surface modification. The functional groups of the silane<br>
are in this connection chosen so that they can react with<br>
the polymer system to be crosslinked. Suitable pairs of<br>
functional groups of the crosslinking agent component and<br>
of the polymer system are for example the pairs listed in<br>
DE 197 33 643 Al, page 4. For example, a thermoset based<br>
on isocyanate prepolymers is obtained if the crosslinking<br>
agent particles according to the invention are surface-<br>
modified with aminopropyltrimethoxysilane. By reacting the<br>
amino groups with the dimeric isocyanate, urea couplings<br>
are formed as crosslinking sites. In the case of acrylate<br>
resins the modification of the crosslinking agent particles<br>
is preferably carried out with silanes containing acrylate<br>
or methacrylate groups, and in the case of mercaptans is<br>
preferably carried out with epoxysilanes.<br>
Particularly preferred are adhesive compositions with<br>
filler particles that have been produced by flame<br>
pyrolysis.<br>
Such filler particles may be particles or aggregated<br>
particles with superparamagnetic iron oxide .domains having<br>
a diameter of 3 to 20 nm in a silicon dioxide matrix. The<br>
production of such particles is described for example by<br>
Zachariah et al. in Nanostructured Materials 5, 383 (1995)<br>
or Ehrman et al. in Journal of Materials Research 14, 4551<br>
(1999).<br>
Particularly preferred are the iron oxide-silicon dioxide<br>
composite particles described in DE 10140089.6 of<br>
application date 16.08.2001.<br>
Filler particle domains are understood to be<br>
superparamagnetic regions spatially separated from one<br>
another. On account of the flame pyrolysis process these<br>
particles are largely pore-free and contain free hydroxyl<br>
groups on the surface. They exhibit superparamagnetic<br>
properties when an external magnetic field is applied. The<br>
proportion of superparamagnetic iron oxide domains of the<br>
filler particles may lie between 1 and 99.6 wt.%. Regions<br>
of superparamagnetic iron oxide domains spatially separated<br>
by the non-magnetic matrix are present in this range. The<br>
range with a proportion of superparamagnetic domains<br>
greater than 30 wt.%, particularly preferably greater than<br>
50 wt.%, is preferred. The achievable magnetic effect of"<br>
the particles according to the invention also increases in<br>
step with the proportion of the superparamagnetic regions.<br>
In these domains the iron oxide may be present in a uniform<br>
modification or in different modifications.<br>
In addition regions of non-magnetic modifications may also<br>
be present in the particles. These may be mixed oxides of<br>
silicon dioxide and iron oxide. Iron silicalite (FeSiO4)<br>
may be mentioned by way of example. These non-magnetic<br>
constituents behave like the non-magnetic silicon dioxide<br>
matrix as regards superparamagnetism. In other words the<br>
domains remain superparamagnetic, although the saturation<br>
magnetisation drops with increasing proportion of the non-<br>
magnetic constituents.<br>
In addition iron oxide domains may also be present that on<br>
account of their size do not exhibit superparamagnetism and<br>
induce a remanence. This leads to an increase in the<br>
volume-specific saturation magnetisation. Suitably adapted<br>
composite particles can be produced depending on the field<br>
of application.<br>
A particularly preferred superparamagnetic iron oxide<br>
domain is gamma-Fe2O3 (Y-Fe2O3) , Fe3O4/ and mixtures thereof.<br>
Apart from the spatial separation of the superparamagnetic<br>
iron oxide domains, the silicon dioxide matrix also has the<br>
task of stabilising the oxidation state of the domains.<br>
Thus, for example, magnetite is stabilised as<br>
superparamagnetic iron oxide phase by a silicon dioxide<br>
matrix.<br>
According to a particular embodiment the carbon content of<br>
the filler particles may be less than 500 ppm.<br>
Particularly preferably the content is less than 100 ppm.<br>
The filler particles may furthermore have a chloride<br>
content of 50 to 1000 ppm, originating from the production<br>
of the particles. The particles are obtained by a flame<br>
pyrolysis process in which chlorine-containing precursors<br>
are reacted for example in a hydrogen/oxygen flame. The<br>
particles that are formed may contain chlorine for example<br>
in the form of oxychlorides from the reaction that has not<br>
gone to completion, as well as chlorine in the form of<br>
hydrochloric acid. If these compounds are enclosed in the<br>
particles that are formed, the chloride content of the<br>
particles cannot be reduced further even by purification<br>
steps, without the particles being destroyed. The chloride<br>
content can be reduced to values of ca. 50 ppm by<br>
purification steps.<br>
The filler particles may have different degrees of<br>
aggregation depending on the conditions of the flame<br>
pyrolysis process. Influencing parameters may include the<br>
residence time, temperature, pressure, the partial<br>
pressures of the compounds that are used, and the nature<br>
and site of the cooling step after the reaction. A broad<br>
spectrum ranging from largely spherical to largely<br>
aggregated composite particles may thus be obtained.<br>
The BET surface, determined according to DIN 66131, of the<br>
filler particles may vary over a wide range from 10 to<br>
600 m2/g. Particularly preferably the range is between 50<br>
and 300 m2/g.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the composite particles the<br>
"blocking temperature", i.e. the temperature below which<br>
superparamagnetic behaviour can no longer be detected, may<br>
be no more than 150 K. This temperature may depend on,<br>
apart from the composition of the particle, also on the<br>
size of the superparamagnetic domains and their anisotropy.<br>
The composite particles of superparamagnetic iron oxide and<br>
silicon dioxide as filler particles are then reacted on the<br>
surface with for example silanes, which may additionally<br>
carry groups that can react with the adhesive. In this way<br>
the inductively excitable crosslinking agent particles are<br>
obtained.<br>
In an advantageous modification of the invention the filler<br>
particles are bound via a thermally labile group to the<br>
crosslinking agent units. Suitable thermally labile groups<br>
are in particular azo groups, carbonate groups or ethylene<br>
groups with sterically demanding substituents. When<br>
adhesive compositions with such thermally labile groups are<br>
heated a bond rupture occurs at a specific temperature,<br>
whereby for example nitrogen or carbon dioxide are formed<br>
in the examples given above, or the carbon-carbon bond of<br>
the ethylene group with sterically demanding substituents<br>
is ruptured. A filler particle to which the crosslinking<br>
agent units are bound via a thermally labile group is shown<br>
for example in Fig. 1B or Fig. 2B, in which the filler<br>
particles are present in agglomerated form.<br>
In a variant the adhesive composition, which can be heated<br>
by means of an electrical field, magnetic field,<br>
electromagnetic field, alternating electrical field,<br>
alternating magnetic field or alternating electromagnetic<br>
field, contains a polymer, a polymer mixture or a reactive<br>
resin, a thermally labile substance, a crosslinking agent<br>
component, as well as filler particles that are metallic,<br>
ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, superparamagnetic or<br>
paramagnetic.<br>
Such adhesive compositions are particularly suitable for<br>
the production of hardened adhesive joints that are to be<br>
re-dissociated by inductive heating.<br>
Adhesive compositions within the meaning of this variant<br>
also include in particular adhesives, paints, primers,<br>
casting compositions, sealants and laminating resins. All<br>
polymers and polymer mixtures that are suitable for the<br>
uses mentioned in the introduction may also be regarded as<br>
polymers, polymer mixtures and reactive resins within the<br>
meaning of this variant. Crosslinked polymers are also<br>
preferred for this variant, particularly preferably<br>
polymers or reactive resins from which structural or<br>
semi-structural joints can be produced. In particular<br>
epoxide resins, polyurethanes, acrylates, phenol resins,<br>
polysulfides or melamine resins are suitable.<br>
The inductively excitable fillers are present either in the<br>
form of singular nanoparticles or aggregates, or in the<br>
form of agglomerates. They are preferably found in direct<br>
contact with the thermally labile substance, so that the<br>
heating takes place selectively at the site at which bonds<br>
are to be ruptured. Particularly preferably the thermally<br>
labile substance is therefore bound to the inductively<br>
excitable fillers. Also preferred are filler particles<br>
that carry a silicon dioxide-containing coating. These<br>
have a high long-term resistance to moisture.<br>
The crosslinking agent carries functional groups that<br>
undergo crosslinking reactions with the polymer, the<br>
polymer mixture or the reactive resin, which may be<br>
thermally accomplished either inductively or also in a<br>
conventional way. Suitable groups that undergo<br>
crosslinking reactions include for example epoxide, amino,<br>
The adhesive compositions of this variant accordingly have<br>
the advantage that, after they are cured, adhesive joints<br>
are formed that can be cleanly separated by means of<br>
inductive heating, with savings in time and energy. If the<br>
filler particles are in direct contact with the thermally<br>
labile substance, then the heating is carried out<br>
selectively at the site at which the bonds of the thermally<br>
labile substance are to be ruptured. This has the<br>
advantage that the whole polymer is not destroyed, as would<br>
be the case for example if the heating were carried out<br>
with a welding torch or laser. A non-selective thermal<br>
destruction of the polymer may therefore be avoided.<br>
As thermally labile substances added to the adhesive<br>
composition, in particular those substances are suitable<br>
that have average particle sizes between 2 nm and 100 µm,<br>
preferably between 2 nm and 1 µm and particularly<br>
preferably between 2 nm and 200 nm.<br>
Such particles may be present individually or in the form<br>
of agglomerates. If adhesive joints that are obtainable by<br>
curing such adhesive compositions are heated, then bonds<br>
are ruptured or phase transformations take place in these<br>
thermally labile substances and the polymer network is<br>
destabilised, whereby a rupture of the adhesive joint is<br>
possible.<br>
In an advantageous modification the thermally labile<br>
substance is a blowing agent that forms a gas under the<br>
action of heat, the gas formation temperature being higher<br>
than the temperature at which the crosslinking of the<br>
adhesive composition starts.<br>
The dissociation of adhesive composites that have been<br>
produced from such adhesive compositions is carried out by<br>
inductive heating of the particles coupled to the blowing<br>
agent, via the decomposition temperature of the blowing<br>
agent or of the blowing agent component and the resultant<br>
thermal decomposition. The gaseous decomposition products<br>
that are formed "blast" the adhesive composite apart.<br>
Suitable blowing agents include for example substances that<br>
split off water of crystallisation (e.g. aluminium<br>
nitrate), organic carboxylic acids (e.g. oxalic acid,<br>
glutaric acid), azo compounds (e.g. azodicarbonamide,<br>
azoisobutyronitrile), or fluorinated hydrocarbons.<br>
Particularly preferred blowing agents are azodicarbonamide<br>
and sulfohydrazides, such as in particular toluene<br>
sulfohydrazide and oxygen-bis(benzosulfohydrazide). In<br>
general derivatives of azodicarbonamide are also suitable.<br>
The blowing agents may optionally be activated with zinc<br>
salts. These blowing agents have the advantage that they<br>
release a large amount of gas, are sparingly soluble in<br>
organic media, decompose at 180° to 200°C, i.e. above the<br>
temperature of use of normal bonded joints, and are not<br>
toxic. If necessary the decomposition temperature may be<br>
reduced by additional activators and thereby adjusted to<br>
the conditions under which it is intended to dissociate the<br>
adhesive joints. The poor solubility of the aforementioned<br>
blowing agents in organic media has the result that the<br>
blowing agent is not dissolved in the adhesive and<br>
consequently the intimate contact between the inductively<br>
heatable filler particles and the blowing agent in the<br>
adhesive is retained. In this way the effectiveness of the<br>
resin formulation according to the invention is further<br>
enhanced.<br>
In a further advantageous modification of the adhesive<br>
composition according to the invention collective particles<br>
are first of all formed from blowing agent and filler<br>
particles, in which the blowing agent may optionally be<br>
bound to the filler particles. Collective particles are<br>
therefore understood to denote particles that contain both<br>
the blowing agent as well as the filler particles.<br>
These collective particles are obtained by precipitation,<br>
compression, microencapsulation or binding of blowing<br>
agents and filler particles with a polymer. The size of<br>
such collective particles is limited simply by the<br>
subsequent use. Such collective particles have the<br>
advantage that inductively heatable blowing agent particles<br>
that are readily compatible with the adhesive matrix can be<br>
produced. The blowing agent cannot therefore be released<br>
by the resin system and the intimate contact between<br>
inductively heatable filler particles and the blowing agent<br>
is retained.<br>
Preferably the polymer for the formation of the collective<br>
particles is expandable polystyrene. The collective<br>
particles are accordingly polystyrene beads that contain at<br>
the same time the inductively heatable filler particles and<br>
a blowing agent that is normally used to expand<br>
polystyrene. Such polystyrene beads preferably have a size<br>
of 1 µm to 1 mm. When adhesive composites that have been<br>
produced from adhesive compositions that contain these<br>
polystyrene beads are inductively heated, this leads to an<br>
expansion of the polystyrene particles and thus to the<br>
dissociation of the adhesive composite.<br>
The adhesive composition according to the invention is<br>
preferably used for adhesives, paints, sealants,<br>
primers, matrix resins or casting resins.<br>
A process for curing the adhesive composition according to<br>
the invention to form adhesive joints consists in<br>
inductively heating the adhesive composition by means of an<br>
electrical field, magnetic field, electromagnetic field,<br>
alternating electrical field, alternating magnetic field or<br>
alternating electromagnetic field, to a temperature at<br>
which the crosslinking of the adhesive composition starts.<br>
This process has the advantage that the duration of the<br>
inductive heating is normally in the range from seconds to<br>
minutes, and is thus significantly shorter than in the<br>
conventional thermal curing processes. Accordingly it is<br>
particularly suitable for curing the adhesive compositions<br>
according to the invention on sensitive objects. Also,<br>
this process is very energy-efficient.<br>
The curing process according to the invention may in<br>
particular be carried out as described in Ortwin Hahn,<br>
Andrea Kaimann, Adhäsion - Kleben und Dichten, 10/2001,<br>
pp. 35 to 38 for adhesive compositions containing coarse<br>
particulate fillers. The addition of curing catalysts and<br>
activators, as is also described in unpublished<br>
specification DE 10127704.0, is advantageous.<br>
The adhesive composite obtained by the process according to<br>
the invention for curing the adhesive composition according<br>
to the invention contains at least one hardened adhesive<br>
layer. In particular such an adhesive composite may be an<br>
adhesive joint, a cast structural part, a sealing<br>
structural part or a polymer laminate. The cured adhesive<br>
layer may be a paint layer or a primer layer.<br>
The process according to the invention for the thermal<br>
dissociation of the adhesive composite that can be obtained<br>
by curing the adhesive composition according to the<br>
invention is carried out by inductively heating the<br>
hardened layer of the adhesive composition by means of an<br>
electrical field, magnetic field, electromagnetic field,<br>
alternating electrical field, alternating magnetic field or<br>
alternating electromagnetic field. If the adhesive<br>
composition contains the crosslinking agent particles<br>
according to the invention, then the hardened layer of the<br>
adhesive composition is heated in the process according to<br>
the invention to a temperature that lies above the ceiling<br>
temperature of the crosslinking points. If the adhesive<br>
composition contains filler particles and a thermally<br>
labile substance, then the hardened layer of the adhesive<br>
composition is heated inductively to a temperature at which<br>
the thermally labile bonds of the thermally labile<br>
substance or of the thermally labile group rupture.<br>
In the process according to the invention for the thermal<br>
dissociation of the hardened adhesive composites, the<br>
filler particles are thus inductively heated, whereby a<br>
chemical reaction is initiated in which either the<br>
thermally labile substances effect a rupture of the<br>
crosslinking points of the polymer network due to bond<br>
rupture, formation of gas and/or swelling effects, or in<br>
which, due to the inductive heating of the filler<br>
particles, a bond rupture takes place at the crosslinking<br>
 points lying in the immediate vicinity of the filler<br>
particles.<br>
The dissociation of the adhesive composites according to<br>
the invention thus takes place selectively by the action of<br>
the high-frequency energy from a conventional induction<br>
coil. Due to resultant eddy currents, particle movements<br>
in the alternating field and hystoresis losses, the<br>
metallic, ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, superparamagnetic<br>
or paramagnetic filler particles according to the invention<br>
present in the polymer network are heated. At the same<br>
time there is also a heating of the polymer system in the<br>
immediate environment of the filler particles. The<br>
induction voltage is chosen so that the heat that is<br>
generated is sufficient to dissociate the crosslinking<br>
points in the polymer network and to destroy the latter<br>
thermally in the case where heating is combined with<br>
blowing agents. The induction frequencies are preferably<br>
between a few kilohertz and about 35 megahertz. The<br>
equipment, parameters and equipment adjustments required in<br>
each case depend on the filler that is used and its content<br>
in the polymer system. In particular, the particle size<br>
distribution, Curie temperature, permeability, electrical<br>
resistance, coefficient of thermal expansion and the<br>
specific thermal capacity are quantities on which depends<br>
the achievable temperature for a specific setting of the<br>
equipment. The temperature required for the dissociation<br>
depends on the thermal stability of the respective polymer<br>
system and blowing agent. If the filler particles that are<br>
used are chemically bound to the crosslinking sites of the<br>
polymer system, then the filler itself is a constituent of<br>
the polymer system. On account of the localised vicinity<br>
of the chemical bonds to be separated to the filler<br>
particles introduced according to the invention and<br>
heatable by induction, the separation is in this case<br>
particularly effective.<br>
The process according to the invention for dissociating<br>
adhesive composites may be used on bonded joints that<br>
consist only of the adhesive itself according to the<br>
invention, though there may also be used an adhesive primer<br>
based on the adhesive compositions according to the<br>
invention in combination with a commercially available<br>
adhesive. In this case the dissociation of the composite<br>
takes place selectively in the primer layer. The adhesive<br>
remains on one of the two bonded parts.<br>
If the adhesive composition according to the invention is a<br>
paint that is to be inductively pickled, then in particular<br>
adhesive compositions according to the invention are<br>
advantageous in which the filler particles are bound to the<br>
crosslinking agent component. This has the advantage that<br>
no chemicals, no expensive equipment and no high labour<br>
expenditure are necessary for the pickling. Furthermore<br>
the paints that can be inductively pickled are particularly<br>
suitable for sensitive substrates. As examples there may<br>
be mentioned fibre-reinforced composite plastics, in which<br>
the base polymers are damaged by the pickling chemicals, or<br>
the fibres may be exposed or damaged during the grinding.<br>
Both phenomena lead to an unallowable weakening of the<br>
sensitive structural part.<br>
The process according to the invention for the inductive<br>
pickling is suitable in particular for carbon fibre-<br>
reinforced structural parts of aircraft or glass fibre-<br>
reinforced composites in ships' carcasses and wind power<br>
blades.<br>
Without restricting its general applicability, the adhesive<br>
composition according to the invention, the process for<br>
curing the latter to form an adhesive composite and the<br>
dissociation of this adhesive composite are described in<br>
more detail hereinafter with the aid of examples of use.<br>
Example 1 - Curing and dissociation of a bonded joint with<br>
inductively excitable filler particles bound to a<br>
crosslinking agent<br>
la) Nanoscale magnetite coated with silicon dioxide<br>
43.3 g of iron(III) chloride hexahydrate are dissolved in<br>
370 ml of water and freed from dissolved oxygen by passing<br>
nitrogen through the solution. 15.9 g of iron(II) chloride<br>
tetrahydrate are added and a solution of 25.6 g of sodium<br>
hydroxide in 100 ml of water is added dropwise within<br>
2 hours, with stirring, with a precision glass stirrer<br>
under a flowing stream of nitrogen. A finely particulate<br>
black precipitate of Fe3O4 is thereby formed. A solution of<br>
22 g of Na2Si307 (annealing loss 17 wt.%) in 80 ml of hot<br>
water is then added dropwise within 30 minutes. The<br>
silicic acid is now precipitated, with further stirring, by<br>
slow dropwise addition of hydrochloric acid (14 ml of 37%<br>
hydrochloric acid made up to 50 ml with water). The<br>
precipitate is filtered and made into a slurry five times<br>
with distilled water and is in each case refiltered in<br>
order to separate the sodium chloride formed. The<br>
resulting material consists of agglomerated nanoparticles.<br>
The primary particles have a diameter of about 8 nm<br>
(determined by transmission electron microscopy) and the<br>
agglomerates have a diameter of about 400 nm (determined by<br>
light scattering).<br>
lb) Modification of the nanoscale, inductively excitable<br>
filler particles<br>
20 g of the nanoscale magnetite produced according to<br>
Example la with a residual moisture content of 40% or a<br>
comparable material from another source is made into a<br>
slurry with acetone, made up to a total volume of 300 ml,<br>
acidified with 0.3 ml of conc, hydrochloric acid, following<br>
which 15 g of epoxycyclohexyltrimethoxysilane are added.<br>
The whole is stirred for 24 hours with a precision glass<br>
stirrer and then dried in vacuo on a rotary evaporator.<br>
The surface-modified filler carries cycloaliphatic epoxide<br>
groups on the surface and is able to act as a crosslinking<br>
agent in the adhesive system.<br>
lc) Incorporation of the surface-modified filler into an<br>
adhesive<br>
10 g of 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3',4'-epoxycyclohexane-<br>
carboxylate, 10 g of cyclohexene oxide, 0.2 g of<br>
(tolylcumyl) iodonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate<br>
and 0.2 g of ascorbic acid-6-hexadecanoate are stirred<br>
until a homogeneous mixture is formed (base mixture<br>
according to unpublished specification DE 10127704.0).<br>
4 g of the surface-modified filler according to b) are<br>
incorporated using a dissolver. After stirring for<br>
15 minutes a homogeneous thixotropic mass has formed, which<br>
is used hereinafter as adhesive.<br>
1d) Bonding with inductive curing and re-dissociation of<br>
the bonded joint<br>
25 mm- wide and 4 mm- thick parts to be joined consisting<br>
of glass fibre-reinforced polyester are bonded with the<br>
adhesive produced according to c). For this, a part to be<br>
joined is coated in the joining region with a 0.2 mm- thick<br>
adhesive layer, the second part is placed thereon, and both<br>
parts are fixed under a light pressure (ca. 0.02 N/mm2) .<br>
The subsequent curing of the adhesive is carried out by<br>
excitation with an M230 semiconductor generator from STS.<br>
The excitation frequency of this generator is 300 kHz. A<br>
coil with three windings and an internal diameter of 3 cm<br>
is used for the inductive excitation of the adhesive in the<br>
bonded joint. The adhesive surface is aligned in the<br>
middle of the coil, perpendicular to the coil axis. The<br>
adhesive is cured at an output of 1000 W and an action time<br>
of 5 minutes, a firm joint thereby being obtained. This is<br>
then dissociated within 60 secs by increasing the generator<br>
output to 3000 W. In a comparison example without<br>
inductively excitable nanoscale filler"particles, it is not<br>
possible to cure the adhesive even at an output of 3 000 W<br>
and an action time of 10 minutes.<br>
Example 2 - Bonded joint that can be dissociated by an<br>
inductively excitable blowing agent<br>
2a) Formulation from magnetite powder and blowing agent<br>
20 g of the material produced according to la) (residual<br>
moisture of the filter cake 40%) or a nanoscale magnetite<br>
powder obtained from another source is suspended in 100 ml<br>
of ethanol and 20 g of oxy-bis(benzosulfohydrazide) are<br>
added as blowing agent. The mixture is heated for 4 hours<br>
at 70°C with stirring, and the solvent is then removed on a<br>
rotary evaporator. The dry formulation is ground in a ball<br>
mill for 5 minutes and then screened. The fraction with a<br>
grain size of nominally less than 63 µm is used for the<br>
further tests.<br>
2b) Incorporation of the formulation from Example 2a) in<br>
an adhesive<br>
8 g of 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3',4'-epoxycyclohexane-<br>
carboxylate, 2 g of poly(tetrahydrofuran) of Mn=250, 0.1 g<br>
of (tolylcumyl) iodonium tetrakis (pentafluorophenyl)<br>
borate and 0.04 g of ascorbic acid-6-hexadecanoate are<br>
stirred until the components have dissolved in one another<br>
(base mixture according to unpublished specification<br>
DE 10127704.0). 2 g of the formulation are then stirred<br>
in, whereupon the material assumes a doughy consistency. A<br>
part of the sample cures within 3 0 minutes at 90°C to form a<br>
tack-free polymer.<br>
2c) Bonding and re-dissociation of a plastics joint<br>
25 mm- wide and 3 mm- thick polypropylene parts to be<br>
joined are pretreated by fluorination according to the<br>
prior art, coated with a ca. 0.2 mm- thick layer of the<br>
inductively excitable formulation, following which a second<br>
part is placed thereon and is cured under a light pressure<br>
(ca. 0.02 N/mm2) for 3 0 minutes in an oven at 90°C. The<br>
subsequent separation of the joint is carried out by<br>
excitation with an M230 semiconductor generator from STS.<br>
The excitation frequency of this generator is 300 kHz. A<br>
coil with three windings and an internal diameter of 3 cm<br>
is used for the inductive excitation of the adhesive in the<br>
bond joint. The adhesive surface is aligned in the middle<br>
of the coil, perpendicular to the coil axis. With an<br>
output of 1500 W and an action time of 25 secs, the blowing<br>
agent has decomposed and thereby dissociated the bonded<br>
joint. In a comparison example without the nanoscale<br>
magnetite powder, the bonded joint cannot be dissoicated<br>
even under the action of an output of 3 000 W for 2 minutes.<br>
The analytical data of the iron oxide-silicon dioxide<br>
composite particles used in Examples 3 to 6 are shown in<br>
Table 1. The production of these particles is described in<br>
DE 10140089.6.<br>
Example 3 - Dissociation of a glass bond based on an<br>
adhesive with inductively excitable blowing agent<br>
3a) Formulation from composite particles produced by flame<br>
pyrolysis and a binder<br>
25 g of nanoscale composite particles produced by flame<br>
pyrolysis and consisting of silicon dioxide and iron oxide<br>
having the properties shown in Table 1 are suspended in<br>
100 ml of ethanol and 20 g of oxy-bis(benzosulfohydrazide)<br>
are added as blowing agent. The mixture is heated for<br>
5 hours at 60°C with stirring, and the solvent is then<br>
removed on a rotary evaporator. The dry formulation is<br>
ground in a ball mill for 3 minutes and then screened. The<br>
fraction with a grain size of nominally less than 63 µm is<br>
used for the further tests.<br>
3b) Incorporation of the formulation from Example 3a) in<br>
an adhesive, and adhesive tests<br>
3 00 g of the moisture-hardening one-component polyurethane<br>
adhesive Dinitrol PUR 501 FC (Dinol GmbH) are modified in a<br>
Planimax (Molteni) mixer provided with kneading hooks, with<br>
10 g of the formulation produced according to Example 3a<br>
and consisting of blowing agent and inductively excitable<br>
nanofiller. The mixture is kneaded for 15 minutes at<br>
setting 1 (150 rpm) in a dry atmosphere.<br>
A thick layer bond between a sand-blasted and degreased<br>
aluminium sheet and a 3 mm- thick float glass panel is<br>
prepared using the thereby modified adhesive. The overlap<br>
length is 25 mm and the adhesive layer thickness is 3 mm.<br>
After a curing time of 1 week at 25°C and 50% relative<br>
atmospheric humidity the joint is re-separated by inductive<br>
excitation. The separation of the joint is carried out by<br>
excitation with an M23 0 semiconductor generator from STS.<br>
The excitation frequency of this generator is 300 kHz. A<br>
coil with three windings and an internal diameter of 3 cm<br>
is used for the inductive excitation of the adhesive in the<br>
bonded joint. The adhesive surface is aligned in the<br>
middle of the coil, perpendicular to the coil axis. At an<br>
output of 3000 W and an action time of 2 minutes the<br>
adhesive is destroyed by the expansion of the blowing<br>
agent. The two joined parts can easily be separated from<br>
one another.<br>
Example 4 - Dissociable bonded joint based on an<br>
inductively dissociable adhesive primer<br>
5 g of the formulation prepared according to Example 3a and<br>
consisting of blowing agent and inductively excitable<br>
nanofiller are stirred into 200 g of the Sika-Primer 206G+P<br>
(Sika AG) adhesive primer. The primer is applied to a<br>
sand-blasted and degreased aluminium sheet so as to cover<br>
the latter. After an aeration time of 1 hour the sheet<br>
pretreated in this way is bonded with a 3 mm- thick layer<br>
of beech plywood. Sikaflex 254 (Sika AG) is applied as<br>
adhesive in a thickness of 3 mm, and the overlap length is<br>
25 mm. The adhesive hardens within 1 week at a relative<br>
atmospheric humidity of 50% and at 25°C. The joint is then<br>
re-separated by inductive excitation. The excitation of<br>
the adhesive for the separation is carried out with an M230<br>
semiconductor generator from STS. The excitation frequency<br>
of this generator is 300 kHz. A coil with three windings<br>
and an internal diameter of 3 cm is used for the inductive<br>
excitation of the adhesive in the bonded joint. The<br>
adhesive surface is aligned in the middle of the coil,<br>
perpendicular to the coil axis.<br>
At an output of 3 000 W and an action time of 2 minutes the<br>
adhesive primer applied to the aluminium side is destroyed<br>
by the expansion of the blowing agent. The parts of the<br>
joint can easily be separated from one another, the<br>
adhesive remaining selectively on the plywood.<br>
Example 5 - Curing an elastic adhesive and testing the<br>
adhesive properties<br>
The elastic adhesive Elastosol M83 (Tivoli, Hamburg) is a<br>
one-component, heat-curing metal adhesive based on<br>
polybutadiene. On the basis of a comparison of the curing<br>
in a conventional oven with the inductive curing according<br>
to the invention, it will be shown that equivalent bonding<br>
results are achieved with both types of curing. In this<br>
connection the inductive curing occurs more rapidly.<br>
25 g of the iron oxide-silicon dioxide composite particles<br>
according to Table 1 are incorporated in 250 g of the<br>
adhesive Elastosol M83 using a Planimax mixer (Molteni)<br>
equipped with kneading hooks. Kneading is first of all<br>
carried out for 5 minutes at 150 revolutions per minute and<br>
then for a further 30 minutes at 450 rpm (setting 3). The<br>
mixture is then kneaded for a further 5 minutes in vacuo to<br>
degass it (setting 3). The material according to the<br>
invention that is thus obtained is used for the adhesive<br>
tests.<br>
In order to check the adhesive properties, tensile/shear<br>
samples are produced on the basis of DIN EN 1465, one part<br>
to be joined consisting of 1.15 mm- thick rolled aluminium<br>
sheet material (AlMgo.4Si12) and another part to be joined<br>
consisting of 4 mm- thick, glass fibre-reinforced<br>
polypropylene. The aluminium is ground and degreased with<br>
butanone. The polypropylene is pretreated in a low-<br>
pressure plasma with air as working gas.<br>
Adhesive samples are first of all prepared with the<br>
modified adhesive according to the invention and<br>
inductively hardened. The curing of the adhesive is<br>
carried out by excitation with an M23 0 semiconductor<br>
generator from STS. A water-cooled flat coil with three<br>
windings and a diameter of 8 cm is used for the inductive<br>
excitation of the adhesive in the bonded joint. The coil<br>
is placed on the joined part of polypropylene and the<br>
adhesive is cured at an output of 1000 W and an action time<br>
of 10 minutes The samples have a tensile-shear strength of<br>
10.4 ± 0.6 MPa, with a cohesive fracture of the adhesive.<br>
For purposes of comparison, tensile/shear samples are<br>
prepared with the unmodified adhesive. In this case the<br>
adhesive is cured in a conventional manner according to the<br>
manufacturer's instructions. The curing is carried out<br>
over 3 0 minutes at 180°C in an oven. The tensile-shear<br>
strength of these samples is 10.1 ± 0.4 MPa.<br>
Example 6 - Modification of a melt adhesive for the<br>
selective dissociation of bonded joints<br>
The melt adhesive B40166 (Heinrich Büuhnen GmbH)is modified<br>
with 7 wt.% of iron oxide-silicon dioxide composite<br>
particles according to Table 1 in a Brabender double-screw<br>
extruder at a screw speed of 60 rpm and a screw temperature<br>
of 22 0°C in all heating zones. The melt adhesive is<br>
granulated and applied with an HB 500 application device to<br>
5 mm- thick beech plywood. A second piece of beech plywood<br>
is immediately pressed onto the melt adhesive. The joint<br>
is firm within 1 minute. The dissociation of the bonded<br>
joint is carried out inductively with the M230<br>
semiconductor generator from STS and a water-cooled flat<br>
coil with three windings and a diameter of 8 cm. The coil<br>
is placed on the plywood and an output of 3000 W is<br>
adjusted at the semiconductor generator. After an action<br>
time of 60 seconds the two plywood plates can be taken<br>
apart and, after renewed inductive heating, can be rebonded<br>
to one another.<br>
