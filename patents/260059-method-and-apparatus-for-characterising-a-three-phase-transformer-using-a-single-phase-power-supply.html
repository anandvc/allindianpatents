The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for characterising a<br>
three phase transformer using a single phase power supply.<br>
Three phase transformers are widely used in power supply and other<br>
applications. They typically comprise primary and secondary windings for each<br>
phase mounted on a three legged core.<br>
The turns ratio of a transformer is the ratio of the number of turns of its<br>
primary winding divided by the number of turns of the secondary winding, for each<br>
leg of the transformer. The turns ratio is equivalent to the step up or step down<br>
voltage ratio of the transformer. By measuring the turns ratio of a transformer from<br>
its performance and comparing this with its rated voltage a good indication of the<br>
condition of the transformer can be obtained.<br>
Transformers are routinely tested in this way throughout their life. Typically<br>
testing is carried out after manufacture to ensure that the. transformer has been<br>
correctly wound, similarly after refurbishment or remanufacture, and as part of<br>
ongoing maintenance in order to detect any degradation in performance.<br>
Probably the simplest way to measure the rums ratio of a three phase<br>
transformer, at least from the point of view of the apparatus required, is to use a single<br>
phase power supply to test the three pairs of primary and secondary windings<br>
individually. This approach is particularly desirable for field testing where providing<br>
a single phase power supply for testing is easier than providing a three phase supply,<br>
In fact provision of an appropriate three phase power supply may be impossible.<br>
A drawback with use of a single phase supply to measure the turns ratio of a<br><br>
three phase transformer is that the way voltage should be applied to the transformer<br>
and the way it should be measured depends on characteristics of the transformer being<br>
tested, particularly its configuration and phase displacement, if any<br>
The primary and secondary windings of a three phase transformer can each be<br>
connected in one of five known configurations D (Delta), Y (Wye), Yn, Z (Zig Zag)<br>
and Zn.<br>
In D configuration three windings are connected end to end in a loop and three<br>
external connections for the transformer are taken from between the windings. In Y<br>
configuration (also known as star configuration) one end of each winding are all<br>
connected together. The free ends of each winding form three external connections.<br>
In Yn configuration the connection between the three windings of a Y configuration is<br>
brought out as an additional neutral connection. Z configuration is electrically the<br>
same as Y, but each winding is distributed across more than one leg of the transformer<br>
to improve performance in the presence of an unbalanced load. Zn is a Z<br>
configuration with the connection between the windings brought out as neutral.<br>
A three phase transformer can have a phase displacement. Shifting the<br>
secondary connections with respect to the primary connections, essentially re-<br>
labelling the connections, introduces a phase shift in 60 degree steps, as can reversing<br>
the windings. Configuration of the windings also affects phase. If configurations of<br>
the primary and second side are dissimilar an additional 30 degree shift is introduced.<br>
Phase displacement is usually classified using a number between 0 and 11 to indicate<br>
the number of 30 degree steps from in phase introduced by the transformer.<br>
Before the turns ratio of a transformer can be properly measured using a single<br><br>
phase power supply it is necessary to know the winding configuration and any phase<br>
displacement of the transformer.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to enable the windings configuration<br>
and/or phase displacement of a three phase transformer to be determined using a<br>
single phase power supply. It is a particular object to enable winding configuration<br>
and/or phase displacement to be automatically determined.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method<br>
of characterising a three phase transformer having three input terminals and three<br>
output terminals using a single phase power supply, the method comprising the steps<br>
of:<br>
sequentially connecting the single phase power supply between all three<br>
available pairs of input terminals selected from the three input terminals of the<br>
transformer so as to energise each available pair of input terminals in turn;<br>
during energisation of each pair of terminals measuring the voltage between<br>
all three available pairs of output terminals selected from the three output terminals of<br>
the transformer; and<br>
processing the measured voltages to characterise the transformer.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided<br>
apparatus for characterising a three phase transformer using the method of the first<br>
aspect of the present invention.<br>
When characteristics of the transformer have been determined, it is possible<br>
for the turns ratio of the transformer to be measured using a single phase power<br>
supply.<br><br>
Preferably, the method and apparatus enable a three phase transformer to be<br>
characterised according to its winding configuration. The method and apparatus may<br>
classify a three phase transformer as either D-D equivalent, D-Y equivalent, Y-D<br>
equivalent or Y-Y equivalent. The method and apparatus may further classify a<br>
transformer according to the presence of a neutral on either the primary or secondary<br>
side of the transformer, thereby to further characterise its winding configuration.<br>
The method and apparatus also preferably enables the phase displacement of a<br>
transformer to be characterised.<br>
The apparatus preferably comprises a single phase power supply and means<br>
for selectively applying power from the power supply to pairs of input terminals of a<br>
three phase transformer. Said means may comprise a switching matrix. The<br>
apparatus preferably further comprises means for measuring voltage between pairs of<br>
output terminals of a three phase transformer, which means may also include a<br>
switching matrix. The apparatus may further include a phase meter. The various<br>
components of the apparatus are preferably under the control of a control means<br>
which may comprise a programmed computer. The control means preferably<br>
includes a processing means for processing measured voltages in order to determine<br>
characteristics of the transformer. The apparatus may further include means for<br>
shorting any two terminals of a transformer together. Such means may comprise a<br>
shorting matrix.<br>
The apparatus is preferably arranged to automatically characterise a<br>
transformer and provide results to a user. The apparatus may be further arranged to<br>
automatically test the turns ratio of a transformer using the single phase power supply,<br><br>
by the application of a known method.<br>
The apparatus is preferably self contained and portable to facilitate in the field<br>
testing of transformers. The power supply of the apparatus may be provided by a local<br>
mains power supply.<br>
In order that the invention may be more clearly understood an embodiment<br>
thereof will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings of which:<br>
Figure 1	is a schematic diagram of apparatus according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2	is a flowchart illustrating operation of the apparatus of Figure 1; and<br>
Figure 3	is another flowchart illustrating further operation of the apparatus of<br>
Figure 1.<br>
An embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to a notional<br>
three phase transformer to be tested having input (primary) terminals H1, H2, H3 and<br>
optionally an input neutral terminal HO, and output (secondary) terminals X1, X2, X3<br>
and optionally an output neutral terminal XO.<br>
First the winding configuration of a transformer to be tested is determined.<br>
Because the primary and secondary windings of a three phase transformer can<br>
each be wound in five ways there are a total of twenty five possible configurations for<br>
a transformer, as set out below, however it is unlikely to find all these configurations<br>
in practice.<br><br><br><br>
Single-phase energisation of a transformer with-aZ configuration produces the<br>
same results as a D configuration, so it is impossible to distinguish between the two,<br>
The use of Z windings on the primary of a transformer is unusual so these are treated<br>
as a special case. Because of the equivalent behaviour of Z and D windings, they are<br>
defined as similar, with Y windings being treated as different. This gives two groups<br>
of winding configurations:<br>
D - Z - Zn; and<br>
Y -Yn<br>
This allows transformers to be grouped into four groups depending on the<br>
configuration of their primary and secondary windings, as set out below.<br><br>
Energising a transformer input to input on the primary side and measuring the<br>
output to output voltages obtained on the secondary side allows a discrimination of<br>
the transformer's class to be made. The transformer is energised H1-H3, H2-H1 and<br><br>
H3-H2 and with each energisation the line-to-line voltages X1-X3, X2-X1 and X3-X2<br>
are measured. Each set of three secondary measurements is normalised to the highest<br>
line-to-line voltage measured for that energisation. The theoretical results expected for<br>
transformers of each group identified above are as follows:<br><br>
This shows that four response patterns can be expected to be observed, which can be<br>
classified as follows:<br>
Class	Response<br>
A	1:1:0<br>
B	1:0.85:0.15<br>
C	1:0.66:0.33<br>
D	1:0.5:0.5<br>
The responses of the four groups of transformers can be further classified according to<br>
the classes of response that they show thus:<br>
Group 1 (D-D)	= (2 * Class B) + (1 * Class D)<br>
Group 2 (D-Y)	= (2 * Class C) + (1 * Class A)<br><br>
Group 3 (Y-D)	= (2 * Class B) + (1 * Class A)<br>
Group 4 (Y-Y)	= (2 * Class C) + (1 * Class D)<br>
So, by determining the class of response under each of the possible line-to-line<br>
energisations, it is possible to determine the group of the transformer under test. The<br>
expected voltage values shown above are theoretical ideal values and may not be seen<br>
in practice. Therefore to classify transformers in practice a range of values is<br>
substituted for each expected value and measured voltages are classified according to<br>
the range in which they fall.<br>
Once the class of the transformer has been determined, it is necessary to<br>
determine if it has neutral connections. If there is no neutral connection, there is<br>
essentially a floating connection. The presence of a primary neutral can be<br>
determined by comparing the voltage produced on the secondary measuring output to<br>
output when the primary is energised input to input and input to neutral. If there is a<br>
significant difference recorded it indicates that the neutral line is floating (i.e. not<br>
connected). A similar process can be followed to determine the presence of a neutral<br>
on the secondary side. The transformer is energised input to input on the primary and<br>
the output to output and output to neutral voltages on the secondary are compared.<br>
Again if there is a significant difference, it indicates that the neutral line is floating<br>
(i.e. not connected).<br>
When the group of transformer and the presence or absence of primary and<br>
secondary neutral connections is known, it is possible to determine the winding<br>
configuration:<br><br><br><br>
Once the configuration of a transformer has been determined, it is possible to<br>
determine its phase displacement. A three phase transformer core can be considered as<br>
having three legs A, B and C, each of which carries a primary and a secondary<br>
winding. If we regard the input to each primary winding as H1, H2 and H3 and the<br>
output of each secondary winding as X1, X2 and X3 the phase displacement is<br>
determined by which secondary outputs are on the same leg as which primary inputs.<br><br>
At this stage it can also be helpful to determine if any output terminals are swapped<br>
over with respect to the input terminals (e.g. X2 and X3 exchanged with respect to H2<br>
and H3).<br>
Determining which leg if a transformer is which depends on the class of the<br>
windings. The transformer is energised across one phase with the other input terminal<br>
shorted to the low end of the energising supply. This constrains the flux in the core of<br>
the transformer, and produces a minimum or a maximum on one of the output phases<br>
depending on the configuration of the transformer. By this process the phase shift,<br>
cause by rotation of the output terminals with respect to the input terminals, is<br>
determined. There are three possibilities: 0 (no phase shift), 4 (120 degrees) and 8<br>
(240 degrees).<br>
Transformers can be divided into two different classes for the determination of<br>
the phase shift. Phase shift Class 1 transformers have similar primary and secondary<br>
windings (i.e. Group 1 or Group 4 transformers) while Phase shift Class 2<br>
transformers have dissimilar primary and secondary windings. This affects the way<br>
the transformer is treated to determine the winding configuration:<br>
Phase Shift Class 1 Energise leg A, short leg C, minimum is measured on leg C<br>
Phase Shift Class 2 Energise leg A, short leg C, maximum is measured on leg B<br>
So for each group of transformers one can determine the phase shift due to the<br>
shifting of output terminals with respect to the input terminals (Note, "shifting"<br>
indicates output terminals swapped with respect to input terminals, that is that the X2<br>
and X3 connections are reversed, essentially swapping the phase rotation from<br>
clockwise to anti-clockwise or vice versa.) The definition of which leg of the<br><br>
transformer is A, B or C depends on the configuration of the transformer and how we<br>
are energising it. If we define<br>
A as energisation H1-H3, then leg a = X1-X3, leg b= X2-X1, leg c = X3-X2<br>
A' as energisation H2-H1, then leg a' = X2-X1, leg b'= X3-X2, leg c' = X1-X3<br>
A" as energisation H3-H2, then leg a" = X3-X2, leg b"= X1-X3, leg c" = X2-X1<br>
So, for the two phase shift classes of transformers the following will be<br>
observed.<br><br><br><br>
By applying the appropriate energisation pattern, and looking for the<br>
maximum or minimum depending on whether the windings are dissimilar or similar,<br>
it is possible to determine the basic phase displacement of the transformer.<br>
Once the phase shift has been determined, it is necessary to check for phase<br>
reversal, where the polarity of the secondary winding is reversed with respect to the<br>
primary winding, introducing a 180 degree phase shift onto the output. This is<br>
achieved by energising one leg of the transformer and looking at the corresponding<br>
secondary to see if the voltage is in phase with the energising voltage or 180 degrees<br>
out of phase. The phases to be energised and measured depend on the shift as<br>
determined previously:<br><br>
A figure from 0 to 11 for the phase displacement of the transformer is then<br><br>
calculated by taking the phase shift, if the windings are reversed adding 6 and if the<br>
transformer is Class 2 adding 1. If the result is greater than 11, 12 is subtracted.<br>
Figure 1 shows apparatus for automatically implementing the above method.<br>
Referring to figure 1 the apparatus comprises various electrical components and<br>
provides eight electrical test connections for connection to the terminals of a<br>
transformer to be tested 3. The apparatus comprises an energisation source 1 which<br>
provides a single phase electrical signal to a switching matrix 2. A switching matrix 2<br>
is connected to each of the four test connections for connection to terminals H0-3 of a<br>
transformer under test 3. A second switching matrix 6 is also connected to each of the<br>
four connections and a shorting matrix 4 is connected to the connections intended for<br>
terminals H1-3 of a transformer under test 3. A third switching matrix 7 is connected<br>
to each of the four connections for connection to terminals XO-3 of a transformer<br>
under test 3 and a second shorting matrix 7 is connected the connections intended for<br>
terminals X1-3 of a transformer under test 3. The second 6 and third 7 switching<br>
matrices are connected via respective 3rd harmonic filters 8, 9 to respective voltmeters<br>
10, 11 and a single phasemeter 12<br>
The various electrical components of the apparatus described above are all<br>
under control of a control unit 13.<br>
The energisation source 1 comprises a single-phase transformer driven from<br>
the local mains electricity supply. However, alternative generation methods can be<br>
utilised. It is important that the energisation source provides a substantially sinusoidal<br>
signal as the presence of harmonics will disrupt measurement of the turns-ratio and<br>
compromise the accuracy of the system.<br>
The first switching matrix 2 allows the output of the energisation source 1 to<br>
be applied, under the control of the control unit 13, across any two of the inputs H0-3<br>
of the transformer under test 3.<br>
The shorting matrix 4 is, in use, connected to H1, H2 and H3 of the<br>
transformer under test 3 and allows the apparatus to short any two of the primary<br>
terminals Hl-3 together. This is required for phase displacement determination.<br>
The second shorting matrix 5 allows any two of the secondary phase terminals <br>
X1, X2 and X3 of the transformer under test 3 to be shorted together. This feature is<br><br>
not utilised for the winding configuration and phase determination procedure, but is<br>
essential for subsequent turns-ratio measurement.<br>
The second switching matrix 6 is operative to connect any of the primary<br>
connections of the transformer under test 3, H0-3 to the voltmeter 10 and phasemeter<br>
12. It is operated in synchronisation with the switching matrix 2 by the control means<br>
13 so that the primary voltage at the terminals of the transformer is measured while<br>
compensating for voltage drops in the measurement cables.<br>
The third switching matrix 7 is operative to connect any two of the secondary<br>
terminals of the transformer under test 3, X0-3 to the voltmeter 11 and phasemeter 12.<br>
The third switching matrix 7 is operated by the control means 13 independently of the<br>
first and second switching matrices 2,6.<br>
The two 3rd harmonic filters 8 provide a notch response with a minimum at<br>
either 150Hz or 180Hz depending on the line frequency selected. They eliminate a<br>
third harmonic generated by the energisation source 1, or a transformer under test 3,<br>
that could otherwise affect measurement<br>
Voltages at the primary side of a transformer under test are measured by<br>
voltmeter 10 by measuring the peak-to-peak: excursion of the primary waveform. The<br>
waveform is constantly sampled by an ADC (analogue to digital converter), and a<br>
digital peak detection system which returns the maximum and the minimum voltage<br>
recorded by the ADC. The difference between the two is used as a measure of the<br>
voltage. This automatically compensates for any DC offset on the measurement<br>
channel. Voltages at the secondary side of a transformer under test are measured by<br>
voltmeter 11 using the same technique.<br>
The period of the voltage measured by voltmeter 10, the primary voltage, and<br>
the time displacement between primary voltage zero crossings and zero crossings of<br>
the voltage measured by voltmeter 11 (the secondary voltage) are measured by the<br>
phasemeter 12, to determine the phase relationship between the primary and<br>
secondary voltage to be measured by the apparatus.<br>
The control means 13 comprises a software controlled computer, for example<br>
a PC, and is operative, to control the various components of the apparatus in order to<br>
determine the configuration and phase displacement of a transformer under test 3.<br><br>
The control means 13 includes a processing means and a memory operative to store<br>
values relating to measured voltages, constants and to perform calculations and output<br>
results to a user in order to implement the algorithms described below. Any other<br>
appropriate type of control means could of course be employed.<br>
The software is first arranged to cause the apparatus to characterise the<br>
configuration of the transformer under test by employing an algorithm illustrated in<br>
figure 2, and then to further characterise the winding configuration and determine the<br>
phase displacement by employing the algorithm illustrated in figure 3.<br>
Referring to figure 2 the first stage is energising the transformer input to input<br>
in each of the possible configurations (H1-H3, H2-H1 and H3-H2) and measuring the<br>
output to output voltages in each configuration (X1-X3, X2-X1, X3-X2). For each<br>
phase energisation, three measurements result, which must be classified to establish<br>
the configuration.<br>
Classification is achieved by sorting the three measurements for each phase-<br>
to-phase energisation into order, so Vh is the highest, Vi is the intermediate value and<br>
V1 is the lowest value. The three values are then combined to give a single figure of<br>
merit:<br>
FM = (Vi-V1)/Vh<br>
This gives a classification value for each of the four class responses.<br>
Theoretically these values are as follows:<br>
Class A:	1:1:0	FM=1<br>
Class B:	1:0.85:0.15 FM = 0.7<br>
Class C:	1:0.666:0.333 FM = 0.333<br>
Class D:	1:0.5:0.5 FM = 0<br>
Because actual values may deviate from these the control means is arranged to<br>
compare values using magnitudes in order to allocate the figure to the appropriate<br>
class. One way to allocate values is to move from one class to another at the point<br>
where the percentage difference between the two is equal, so<br>
If (FM &gt; 0.82)	Result = Class A<br>
If (FM  0.45) Result = Class B<br>
If (FM  0.16) Result = Class C<br><br>
If (FM 
In practice, though there are variations from the ideal in the FM values<br>
measured. Similar values cause the measured FM values to be lower than the ideal,<br>
while dissimilar windings cause them to be elevated. This can cause errors in<br>
determination, so a modified set of factors are used, as follows:<br>
If (FM &gt; 0.82)	Result = Class A<br>
If (FM  0.48) Result = Class B<br>
If (FM  0.16) Result = Class C<br>
If(FM
When the three sets of results have been classified the configuration of the<br>
transformer is determined. By assigning values to each of the class results, the group<br>
of the transformer is determined by summing the result values for each class result.<br>
The constants are defined so that when three class results are summed, if they are the<br>
same, they cannot be confused with a different class result. In this embodiment the<br>
constants are defined as follows, although other definitions are possible.<br>
Class A	= 0x40 (64 decimal)<br>
Class B	= 0x 10 (16 decimal)<br>
Class C	= 0x04 (4 decimal)<br>
Class D	= 0x01 (1 decimal)<br>
So, summing the results for each of the possible groups gives the following<br>
results:<br>
Group 1 (D-D)	= (2 * 0x10) + 0x01 - 0x21 (33 decimal)<br>
Group 2 (D-Y)	= (2 * 0x04) + 0x40 = 0x48 (72 decimal)<br>
Group 3 (Y-D)	 = (2 * 0x10) + 0x40 = 0x60 (96 decimal)<br>
Group 4 (Y-Y)	= (2 * 0x04) + 0x01 = 0x09 (9 decimal)<br>
In other embodiments different methods of classification are used, for example<br>
the use of a neutral network.<br>
Once the transformer group has been determined it is necessary to determine<br>
the presence of neutrals on the transformers, using the algorithm illustrated in figure<br>
2. The transformer is energised using H1-H3, and X1-X3, X2-X1 and X3-X2, are<br>
measured. The highest value is saved as Xpp. The transformer is then energised using<br><br>
H1-H3 and X1-XO, X2-X0 and X3-X0 are measured. The highest value is saved as<br>
Xpn. The transformer is finally energised using H1-H0 and X1-X3, X2-X1 and X3-X2<br>
are measured. The highest value is saved as Xnp.<br>
If Xpn/Xpp &gt; 0.25 the transformer has a neutral on the secondary<br>
If Xnp/Xpp &gt; 0.25 the transformer has a neutral on the primary.<br>
So there is enough information to determine the configuration of transformer:<br><br><br>
If the time taken to determine the configuration is critical, some of the<br>
measurements could be combined with the first stage of the determination process,<br>
though this would add complexity to the implementation of the system.<br>
The final stage of the process is to determine the phase displacement of the<br>
transformer. The algorithm for this is also illustrated in the flow chart in figure 2. As<br>
discussed above, there are three stages to determining the phase displacement of the<br>
transformer. If the transformer has dissimilar windings an intrinsic 30-degree phase<br>
shift introduced. This adds one to the determined phase displacement.<br>
Looking at the tables above showing how the basic displacement of the<br>
transformer is determined, we can arrange the results to give the same outputs for<br>
either class of transformer:<br><br>
So, depending on whether the transformer is class 1 or class 2 it is energised<br>
using the patterns above and the terminals on the secondary that give the minimum<br>
(class 1) or maximum (class 2). The leg results (highest or lowest leg) can be<br>
combined to give a net result for the transformer, by assigning a constant to them and<br>
summing the results:<br><br><br><br><br>
The final stage is to determine if the windings are reversed. The transformer is<br>
energised phase to phase on the primary and the corresponding phase to phase<br>
measurement is made on the secondary. The phase shift of the secondary with respect<br>
to the primary is measured. If it is greater than 90 degrees or less than -90 degrees, the<br>
windings are reversed. The energisation and measurement phases are determined<br>
using the following table:<br><br>
The phase displacement is then be calculated using the following steps:<br>
Are the Primary and Secondary Windings Similar? (Stage 1)<br>
If Yes: Phase Displacement = 0<br>
If No:	Phase Displacement = 1<br>
What is the Configuration result factor? (Stage 2)<br>
0x24 = 36: Add 0 to Phase Displacement<br>
0x12 =18: Add 4 to Phase Displacement<br>
0x09 = 9: Add 8 to Phase Displacement<br>
0x21 = 33: Add 0 to Phase Displacement<br>
0x06 = 6: Add 4 to Phase Displacement<br>
0x18 = 24: Add 8 to Phase Displacement<br>
Are the secondary windings reversed? (Stage 3)<br>
If Yes:	Add 6 to the Phase Displacement<br><br>
If No:	Add 0 to the Phase Displacement<br>
If the result is greater than 12, subtract 12 from the result.<br>
The characteristics of the transformer being tested are now known and the<br>
apparatus can be arranged to measure the turns ratio for the transformer using a single<br>
phase power supply using a known method.<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CHARACTERISING A THREE PHASE<br>
TRANSFORMER USING A SINGLE PHASE POWER SUPPLY<br>
A method and apparatus for characterising a three phase transformer (3) using a single phase<br>
power supply (1). Pairs of input terminals (H0-H3) of the transformer are sequentially<br>
energised for each energisation and the voltage between pairs of output terminals (x0-x3) of<br>
the transformer are measured. Measured voltages are processed in order to characterise the<br>
winding configuration of the transformer. Either simultaneously or subsequently the presence<br>
of neutrals on the primary and/or secondary side of the transformer are identified to enable the<br>
winding configuration to be further characterised. Subsequently any phase displacement of<br>
the transformer is determined. The apparatus comprises means (2) for selectively applying a<br>
single phase power supply (1) to pairs of terminals (H0-H3) on the transformer (3) and for<br>
measuring voltages between pairs of terminals (x0-x3) of the transformer and for measuring<br>
phase difference between the primary and secondary sides of the transformer all under<br>
automatic control of a control means (13) which includes a processing means to process<br>
measured voltages and phase differences in order to characterise the transformer.</td>
