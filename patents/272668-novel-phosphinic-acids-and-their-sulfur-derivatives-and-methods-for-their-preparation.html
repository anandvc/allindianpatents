				<td>NOVEL PHOSPHINIC ACIDS AND THEIR SULFUR DERIVATIVES AND<br>
METHODS FOR THEIR PREPARATION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates generally to the<br>
field of organic chemistry.  More particularly, the present<br>
invention provides novel organic phosphinic acids and their<br>
sulfur derivatives and methods for their preparation.  These<br>
novel compounds find utility as metal extractants.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a compound<br>
defined by formula (I):<br>
 <br>
wherein:<br>
R1 and R2 are different and each of R1 and R2 is independently<br>
selected from:<br>
(a)	-CH2-CHR3R4, where R3 is methyl or ethyl; and R4 is an<br>
optionally substituted alkyl or heteroalkyl;  and<br>
(b)	-CR3(CH2R5)R6, where<br>
R3 is methyl or ethyl; and<br>
R5 is H or an optionally substituted alkyl or<br>
heteroalkyl, and R6 is an optionally substituted alkyl or<br>
heteroalkyl; or<br>
1<br>
 <br>
R5, R€ and the ethylene group to which they are<br>
bonded form a five or six-nembered optionally substituted<br>
cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl ring;<br>
and each of X and Y is independently 0 or S.<br>
Thus, in embodiments, the invention provides the<br>
following compounds of formula (I) :<br>
(a)	(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)<br>
phosphinic acid;<br>

acid;<br>
<br>
(c)	(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl (2-ethylhexyl)phosphinic acid;<br>
(d)	(2,4,4-trimethylpentyi: (1-methyl-l-ethylpentyl)<br>
phosphinic acid; and<br>
(e)	(1-methyl-l-ethylpentyl)(2-ethylhexyl)phosphinic acid;<br>
and their mono- and dithio- derivatives, and salts thereof.<br>
As described herein, compounds of formula (I) can<br>
be prepared for example by allowing a secondary phosphine of<br>
formula (II): <br>
to react with (i) an oxidizing agent, to produce the<br>
corresponding phosphinic acid; (ii) sulfur, to produce the<br>
corresponding dithiophosphini acid; or (iii) a limited<br>
amount of oxidizing agent, to produce the corresponding<br>
 <br>
phosphine oxide, which is subsequently allowed to react with<br>
sulfur to produce the corresponding monothiophosphinic acid.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides<br>
a method for preparing a secondary phosphine of formula (II)<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are as def:.ned above and R2 is<br>
-CH2-CHR3R4, wherein the method comprises allowing a primary<br>
phosphine of formula R1PH2 to react with an olefin of formula<br>
CH2=CR3R4 under free radical conditions.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides<br>
a method for preparing a secondary phosphine of formula (II)<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above and R2 is<br>
-CR3 (CH2R5)R6, wherein the method comprises allowing a primary<br>
phosphine of formula R1PH2 to react in the presence of an<br>
acid catalyst with an olefin of formula HR5C=CR3R6.<br>
Some of the secondary phosphine compounds of<br>
formula (II) are novel.  Thu3, in embodiments, the invention<br>

(d)	(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)(1-methyl-l-ethylpentyl)<br>
phosphine; and<br>
(e)	(l-methy-l-ethylpentyl)(2-ethylhexyl)phosphine.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides<br>
use of a compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof as a<br>
metal extractant.<br>
 <br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a<br>
process for the extraction of a metal from a metal-bearing<br>
solution, comprising contacting said solution with a<br>
compound of formula (I), allowing the compound of<br>
formula (I) to form a complex with the metal, and recovering<br>
the complex.  In embodiments, a compound of formula (I) in<br>
which X and Y are both 0, or a salt thereof, can be used to<br>
selectively extract cobalt(II) from an aqueous solution<br>
comprising cobalt(II) and rickel(II).<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:<br>
Values for R1 and R2 are chosen to yield compounds<br>
of formula (I) that have low melting points.  For many<br>
applications, the compound of formula (I) is used in its<br>
liquid state.  Accordingly, compounds of formula (I) that<br>
are liquid at room temperature (e.g. over a temperature<br>
range of between about 15°C to about 25°C, more particularly<br>
at a temperature of about 16°C, about 20°C and about 25°C)<br>
are generally suitable for applications that are carried out<br>
at or near room temperature whereas compounds of formula<br>
(I) that melt at low temperature (for example at<br>
temperatures less than about. 30°C, about 40°C, about 50°C,<br>
about 60°C, about 80°C, about 100°C, about 150°C) are<br>
generally suitable for applications that are carried out at<br>
slightly elevated temperatures (i.e. above the melting point<br>
of the compound of formula (I)).  Hence, values for R1 and R2<br>
are chosen such that R1 and R2 are different, as the<br>
resulting asymmetry tends tc decrease the melting point of<br>
the compound.<br>
Branching is another determinant of melting point.<br>
Specifically, the melting point tends to decrease as the<br>
degree of branching of R1 and R2 increases.  By definition,<br>
 <br>
each of R1 and R2 is independently branched at the alpha or<br>
beta carbon, but additional branching can occur at the alpha<br>
or omega carbon or at any intermediate point.  Branching at<br>
the alpha carbon and/or beta carbon may improve the ability<br>
of an organophosphinic acid to bind cobalt selectively over<br>
nickel and/or calcium, by increasing steric hindrance around<br>
the central phosphorous atom and thus favouring coordination<br>
of the phosphinic acid with cobalt(II).<br>
The presence of one or more chiral centres in R1<br>
and R2 tends to decrease the melting point, by providing a<br>
mixture of stereoisomers.<br>
The melting point tends to increase as the number<br>
of carbon atoms in the compound increases, so R1 and R2 are<br>
typically chosen such that the compound of formula (I)<br>
contains no more than about 20 carbon atoms.  However, for<br>
some purposes (such as metal extraction from aqueous<br>
solutions), compounds of formula (I) that are hydrophobic or<br>
"water immiscible" are desired.  The term "water immiscible"<br>
is intended to describe compounds that form a two phase<br>
system when mixed with water, but does not exclude compounds<br>
that dissolve in water nor compounds that dissolve water,<br>
provided that the two phase system forms.  For these<br>
purposes, compounds of formula (I) that have a total of<br>
about 12 carbon atoms or more can be useful.<br>
For many applications (such as metal extraction<br>
applications), R1 and R2 are chosen to yield compounds that<br>
are miscible (preferably in all proportions) with an organic<br>
solvent used in the particular application.  The miscibility<br>
of compounds of formula (I) in the specified organic solvent<br>
can readily be determined (e.g. by eye), without the<br>
exercise of inventive skill.<br>
 <br>
R1 and R2 can contain heteroatoms (e.g. the carbon<br>
backbone can be interrupted by one or more atoms selected<br>
from N, 0, and S) or bear additional substituents (such as<br>
hydroxyl, halo, alkoxy, alkylthio, carboxy, and acetyl<br>
groups), provided that the substituents or heteroatoms do<br>
not interfere with the preparation or utility of the<br>
compounds of the invention, as can readily be determined by<br>
routine experimentation requiring no inventive skill.<br>
However, the presence of heteroatoms and additional<br>
substituents are likely to increase costs.  Therefore, for<br>
many purposes, R1 and R2 will not contain heteroatoms or bear<br>
additional substituents.<br>
Thus, for many purposes, each of R1 and R2 is<br>
independently an alkyl group or cycloalkyl group made up of<br>
hydrogen and carbon atoms only, such as: a C5-C16 alkyl<br>
group, i.e. an alkyl group that has a total of between 5 and<br>
16 carbon atoms (i.e. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,<br>
or 16 carbon atoms) and often between 6 to 10 carbon atoms;<br>
or a C5-C16 cycloalkyl group, e.g. a five- or six-membered<br>
ring substituted with at least one alkyl group (i.e. R3 and<br>
optionally one or more additional alkyl groups), such that<br>
said cycloalkyl group has a total of between 6 and 16 carbon<br>
atoms (i.e. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16) and<br>
often between 6 to 10 carbon atoms.  Herein, the term<br>
"alkyl" includes straight and branched chain alkyl radicals.<br>
R3, R4, R5 and R6 are chosen to provide the desired<br>
values for R1 and R2.  For example, when R1 is a C5-C16 alkyl<br>
of formula -CR3 (CH2R5) R6 and R3 and R5 are both methyl, then R6<br>
is C1-C12 alkyl.  R4, R5 and R6 may be branched.<br>
 <br>
Thus, suitable values for R1 and R2 include: 2,4,4-<br>
trimethylpentyl; 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl; 2-ethylhexyl; and<br>
1-methyl-1-ethylpentyl.<br>
(I) METHODS FOR PREPARING COMPOUNDS OF FORMULA (I):<br>
Compounds of formula (I) can be prepared using<br>
known chemical reactions.  Far example, a secondary<br>
phosphine of formula (II)<br>
 <br>
wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above, can be prepared by<br>
adding a primary phosphine to an olefin either by way of<br>
acid-catalysed addition or under free radical conditions.<br>
Then, the secondary phosphine can be reacted with: (i) an<br>
oxidizing agent, to produce phosphinic acid; (ii) sulfur, to<br>
produce dithiophosphinic acid; or (iii) a limited amount of<br>
oxidizing agent, to produce a phosphine oxide that can<br>
subsequently be allowed to react with sulfur to prepare<br>
monothiophosphinic acid.<br>
Free radical conditions are useful for preparing a<br>
secondary phosphine that has an R group substituted at the<br>
beta carbon atom, because free radical conditions favour<br>
addition of phosphine to a primary carbon atom, such as the<br>
terminal carbon atom of a 1-alkene.<br>
Acid catalysis is useful for preparing a secondary<br>
phosphine that has an R group substituted at the alpha<br>
 <br>
carbon, because acid catalysis favours addition of the<br>
phosphine to a tertiary carbon.<br>
(A)  PREPARATION OF SECONDARY PHOSPHINES UNDER FREE RADICAL<br>
CONDITIONS<br>
Methods for adding phosphines to olefins under<br>
free radical conditions are known.  For example, U.S. Patent<br>
Number 4,374,780 describes a method for making bis (2,4,4-<br>
trimethylpentyDphosphinic acid by free radical addition of<br>
two moles of 2,4,4-trimethylpentene-l to phosphine followed<br>
by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Thus, a method for preparing a secondary phosphine<br>
of formula (II):<br>
 <br>
wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above and R2 is -CH2-CHR3R4,<br>
comprises, for example, allowing ci primary phosphine of<br>
formula R1PH2 to react with an olefin of formula CH2=CR3R4<br>
under free radical conditions.<br>
Free radical initiators are known in the art and<br>
the skilled person will be able to select a suitable free<br>
radical initiator for use in the above-described reaction.<br>
Mention is made of azobis free radical initiators, such as<br>
azobisisobutylnitrile.<br>
The phosphine addition reaction is not<br>
particularly temperature limited and will take place over a<br>
 <br>
wide range of temperatures  Consequently, a temperature<br>
range for carrying out the reaction is generally chosen<br>
based on the half life of t.he initiator employed.  For<br>
example, for azobisisobutylnitrile, the reaction can be<br>
carried out at temperatures ranging from about 40° to<br>
about 110°C, preferably about 60° to about 90° C.<br>
To reduce the production of unwanted tertiary<br>
phosphines, the reaction should be carried out with a molar<br>
excess of primary phosphine.<br>
For example, (2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)(2-ethylhexyl)<br>
phosphine can be prepared by addition of:<br>
(a)	(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)phosphine to 2-ethylhex-l-ene or<br>
(b)	2-ethylhexylphosphine to (2,4,4-trimethyl)pentene-l<br>
under free radical conditions as described above.<br>
(B)  PREPARATION OF SECONDARY PHOSPHINES BY ACID-CATALYZED<br>
ADDITION<br>
Methods for adding phosphines to olefins via acid<br>
catalyzed addition have been known for some time (see for<br>
example U.S. Patent Number 2584112).  For example, U.S.<br>
Patent Number 5,925,784 describes a method of making<br>
bis(l,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phosphinic acid by acid-<br>
catalyzed addition of phospiine to diisobutylene, followed<br>
by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Thus, a method for preparing a secondary phosphine<br>
of formula (II) :<br>
 <br>
 <br>
wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above and R2 is<br>
-CR3 (CH2R5)R6, comprises, for example, allowing a primary<br>
phosphine of formula R1PH2 to react in the presence of an<br>
acid catalyst with an olefin of formula HR5C=CR3R6.<br>
The acid catalysed addition step can be<br>
conveniently carried out in the presence of a protonatable<br>
organic solvent (i.e. an organic solvent that contains a<br>
hydroxy (OH) group), such as a glycol or glycol ether.<br>
Examples of suitable glycol or glycol ethers for this<br>
purpose include: ethylene glycol, glycerine, and glyme.<br>
The acid catalyst can be any strong non-oxidizing<br>
acid.  Alkylsulfonic acids (including but not limited to<br>
methanesulfonic acid and toluenesulfonic acid) are preferred<br>
due to their availability, low cosr and compatibility with<br>
most stainless steels (which are commonly used to make<br>
industrial reactors).  However, other strong non-oxidizing<br>
acids such as HCl and H3PO4 may be used in the method of the<br>
invention, although HCl will require that the reaction be<br>
carried out in a halide resistant reactor.  The molar ratio<br>
of acid catalyst to primary phosphine is about 1:1 to<br>
about 5:1, preferably about 1.5:1.0.  A molar excess of acid<br>
catalyst may improve yield, but increases the cost of the<br>
process.<br>
In general, the acid-catalyzed addition step can<br>
be carried out by adding the acid catalyst to a vessel<br>
 <br>
containing the primary phosphine and the olefin under an<br>
inert atmosphere (such as nitrogen) at atmospheric pressure<br>
and elevated temperature (e.g. about 50° to about 160°C,<br>
preferably about 75° to about 125°C), and allowing the<br>
reaction to proceed for between about 2 to about 88 hours<br>
(preferably between about 8 to about 2 0 hours).  Elevated<br>
temperatures may improve yield and reduce reaction time.<br>
The reaction product(s) can be analyzed using standard<br>
methods, e.g. gas chromatography (GC) and/or nuclear<br>
magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis.<br>
The presence of ar excess of olefin may improve<br>
yield in the phosphine addition step but can lead to olefin<br>
dimers and trimers.  The alkylphosphine may be present in<br>
excess, but the excess alkylphosphine should typically be<br>
removed prior to oxidation.  Therefore, in most cases, the<br>
reaction will comprise olefin and the primary phosphine in a<br>
molar ratio ranging from abcut 0.5:1 to about 3:1,<br>
preferably about 1.5:1.0.<br>
Upon completion of the acid catalysed addition<br>
step, the reaction mixture can be worked up (e.g. by washing<br>
with aqueous base, recoverirg the organic phase, and<br>
removing any unreacted starting materials and solvent under<br>
vacuum at elevated temperature (e.g. about 80°C)), to<br>
provide a crude secondary phosphine preparation that can be<br>
used directly in the oxidation step, without further<br>
purification.<br>
The olefin can be a single species or a mixture of<br>
two related olefin species, each having a tertiary carbon<br>
double-bonded to a neighbouring carbon atom.  For example,<br>
diisobutylene is ordinarily available commercially as a<br>
mixture of (2,4,4-trimethyl)pentene-l and (2,4,4-trimethyl)<br>
 <br>
pentene-2.  In the presence: of an acid catalyst, a primary<br>
phosphine can add to both of these species of olefin at<br>
their beta carbon, which is; tertiary.<br>
For example:<br>
(a)	(2,4,4-trimethylpenty])(1,1,3,3-tetramethyl)phosphine<br>
can be prepared by allowing (2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)<br>
phosphine to react with diisobutylene in the presence<br>
of an acid catalyst;<br>
(b)	(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)(2-ethylhexyl)phosphine can<br>
be prepared by allowing 2-ethylhexylphosphine to react<br>
with diisobutylene in the presence of an acid catalyst;<br>
<br>
(c)	(2,4,4-trimethylpenty])(1-methyl-1-ethylpentyl)<br>
phosphine can be prepared by allowing (2,4,4-trimethyl-<br>
pentyl ) phosphine to react with 2-ethylhexene-l in the<br>
presence of an acid cetalyst; and<br>
(d)	(1-methyl-l-ethylpentyl)(2-ethylhexyl)phosphine can be<br>
prepared by allowing 2-ethylhexylphosphine to react<br>
with 2-ethylhexene-l in the presence of an acid<br>
catalyst.<br>
(C) OXIDATION OF A SECONDARY PHOSPHINE<br>
The secondary phcsphines described above can be<br>
oxidized to prepare the corresponding phosphinic acids.<br>
At a molecular level, the oxidation of the<br>
secondary phosphine occurs in two steps.  First, the<br>
secondary phosphine is oxidized to phosphine oxide, which is<br>
then oxidized to form the phosphinic acid.  In practice,<br>
complete oxidation of the secondary phosphine can be<br>
accomplished in a single reaction.  The secondary phosphine<br>
 <br>
can be oxidized, for example;, by allowing it to react with<br>
an oxidizing agent (preferably hydrogen peroxide) in the<br>
presence of an acid catalyst: (e.g. sulfuric acid) and water,<br>
at atmospheric pressure and elevated temperature<br>
(e.g. about 50°C to about 110°C, preferably about 80°C to<br>
about 100°C) for about 4 to about 16 hours or until<br>
complete.  Lower temperatures slow the reaction, resulting<br>
in longer reaction times.  However, higher temperatures tend<br>
to remove one alkyl group, resulting in the formation of<br>
some monoalkylphosphonic ac:.d side product.  The course of<br>
the reaction can be followed for example by 31P NMR.<br>
Suitable oxidizing agents include hydrogen<br>
peroxide, which is an inexpensive and convenient oxidizing<br>
agent.  The stoichiometry of the oxidation reaction dictates<br>
that two equivalents of hydrogen peroxide react with one<br>
equivalent of phosphine in this reaction.  However, the<br>
presence of an excess of hydrogen peroxide can improve yield<br>
(i.e. pushing the oxidation reaction towards completion) at<br>
little extra cost.  So in many cases, hydrogen peroxide will<br>
be present in excess of the secondary phosphine, say in a<br>
ratio of equivalents ranging from between about 2:1 to<br>
about 4:1, preferably about 3:1.<br>
Upon completion oi: the reaction, the reaction<br>
mixture can be worked up (e.g. by washing with aqueous base<br>
(e.g. sodium hydroxide) then aqueous acid (e.g. sulfuric<br>
acid), then drying under vacuum at elevated temperature<br>
(e.g. about 80°C)), to afford a liquid product that contains<br>
the desired phosphinic acid product.<br>
The foregoing method generally affords a liquid<br>
end product that contains the desired phosphinic acid, as<br>
well as certain side products.  When the process is carried<br>
 <br>
out under suitable conditions, the desired phosphinic acid<br>
product can be the major component (e.g. 80-95% or more by<br>
weight) of the liquid end product.<br>
The liquid end product of the prescribed method<br>
i  can be used in metal extract ion processes without further<br>
purification, as most of the; side products are not expected<br>
to interfere with the metal extraction process.  However,<br>
the oxidation step can result in the production of<br>
phosphonic acid side products (i.e. R1PO(OH)2 and R2PO(OH)2),<br>
 which may for example reduce; the selectivity of the end<br>
product for cobalt over calcium and nickel.  If desired,<br>
reaction conditions (especially temperature, as noted above)<br>
can be chosen to minimize the production of phosphonic acid<br>
side products.  If desired, the liquid end product can be<br>
i washed with one or more alkaline water washes to reduce the<br>
level of monophosphonic acids to an acceptable level, e.g.<br>
about 1% or less.<br>
(D) REACTION OF SECONDARY PHOSPHINES OR PHOSPHINE OXIDES<br>
WITH SULFUR<br>
	The secondary pho3phines described above can also<br>
be used as intermediates to prepare the corresponding<br>
monothiophosphinic acids and dithiophosphinic acids.<br>
Dithiophosphinic acids can be prepared, for<br>
example, by allowing a secondary phosphine to react with<br>
 sulfur, in accordance with known methods (e.g. as described<br>
in US Patent Number 5925784 or GB902802).  Secondary<br>
phosphines just defined can be reacted with sulfur, water,<br>
and a base reagent, such as ammonium hydroxide, to produce<br>
the salt of the corresponding secondary dithiophosphinic<br>
 acid, such as the ammonium salt thereof.  Reactions of this<br>
type are generally carried out at temperatures in the range<br>
 <br>
of about 0°C to about 100°C, preferably about 15°C to<br>
about 75°C.  The salt thus prepared can be reacted with an<br>
acid, such as HC1, dilute sulfuric acid, or methane sulfonic<br>
acid to produce the secondary dithiophosphinic acid. These<br>
reactions generally are made to take place at temperatures<br>
in the range of about -30°C to about 75°C, preferably<br>
about 10°C to about 50°C.<br>
Monothiophosphinic acids can be prepared, for<br>
example, by:<br>
(i)    allowing a secondary phosphine to react with a<br>
limiting amount of an oxidizing agent, to produce a<br>
secondary phosphine oxide; and<br>
(ii)   allowing the secondary phosphine oxide to react with<br>
sulfur to produce a monothiophosphinic acid.<br>
A suitable method for preparing monothiophosphinic acids is<br>
described in for example US Patent Number 4555368.  Briefly,<br>
the secondary phosphine can be oxidized to form the<br>
corresponding diorganophosphine oxide, without forming<br>
significant amounts of the corresponding diorganophosphinic<br>
acid.  To achieve this, the oxidation reaction can be<br>
performed by gradual or incremental addition of the<br>
oxidizing agent at a rate wnich provides a controlled<br>
temperature of from about 40°C to about 60°, and preferably<br>
from about 50°C to about 55°C.  The amount of oxidizing<br>
agent added should be sufficient to oxidize substantially<br>
all of the secondary phosphlne and generally an equimolar<br>
amount of oxidizing agent is used.  The time of addition may<br>
vary depending on the start Lng amounts of secondary<br>
phosphine used. Generally, oxidation under controlled<br>
temperature conditions can be completed with gradual or<br>
 <br>
incremental addition of the oxidizing agent over a period of<br>
from about 1 to about 3 hours.<br>
The selection of a particular oxidizing agent is<br>
not critical, so long as it is effective to oxidize the<br>
secondary phosphine to the secondary phosphine oxide.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide is the preferred oxidizing agent for use<br>
herein, because it is inexpensive, readily available, and<br>
the temperature and rate of the oxidation reaction are<br>
easily controlled with its use.<br>
After substantially all of the secondary phosphine<br>
has been converted to the corresponding secondary phosphine<br>
oxide, the resulting secondary phosphine can be heated to an<br>
elevated temperature of between about 60°C to about 90°C,<br>
and preferably from about 6E°C to about 75°C, and an excess<br>
of sulfur and excess of an hydroxide compound added to<br>
convert the secondary phosph.ine oxide to the corresponding<br>
monothiophosphinate compound.  The sulfurization reaction in<br>
the presence of base can be conducted at temperatures of<br>
between about 60°C to about 90°C, and allowed to proceed<br>
substantially to completion. Generally, the reaction can be<br>
completed within a period of from about 1 to about 5 hours<br>
at temperatures of 60°C to 90°C.<br>
The resulting moncthiophosphinic acid can undergo<br>
tautomerization, interconverting between the following<br>
tautomers;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
(II) UTILITY OP COMPOUNDS OF FORMULA I<br>
It is known in the art that organic phosphinic<br>
acids can be used for metal extraction, notably cobalt (II)<br>
extraction (see for example U.S. Patent Numbers 4373780;<br>
4353883; 4348367; and 5925784).  Organic phosphinic acids<br>
are also known to be useful for extraction of other metals,<br>
such as rare earth metals, actinides, and platinum group<br>
metals.<br>
Organic mono- and dithio-phosphinic acids have<br>
also been found to be useful as metal extractants (see for<br>
example U.S. Patent Numbers 5028403 and 4721605) .  The<br>
acidity of these phosphorus-containing acids increases with<br>
increasing sulfur content, which tends to increase the<br>
ability of the acid to extract metals from solutions having<br>
low pH but also tends to ir.crease the difficulty of<br>
subsequently stripping the metal therefrom.<br>
Thus, it can be appreciated that compounds of<br>
formula (I) may be used as metal extractants (e.g. for the<br>
recovery of a variety of metals from aqueous solutions<br>
containing such metals alor.e or in combination with other<br>
less desirable metals).  In. embodiments, compounds of<br>
formula (I) may be used in cobalt extraction processes.<br>
Bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)-phosphinic acid<br>
(disclosed in U.S. Patent number 4374780 and marketed by<br>
Cytec Industries, Inc. under the name CYANEX 272 is widely<br>
used for separating cobalt and/or nickel from either sulfate<br>
or low chloride media.  CYANEX 272 can bind cobalt<br>
selectively, while simultar.eously rejecting calcium,<br>
magnesium, and nickel, which are often present in aqueous<br>
cobalt (II)-bearing solutions.  CYANEX 272 is also used for<br>
the separation of heavy rare earth metals and the selective<br>
 <br>
separation of iron and zinc from cobalt solutions.  However,<br>
CYANEX 272 has certain limitations and drawbacks.  In<br>
particular, CYANEX 272 becomes increasingly viscous and<br>
difficult to work with when it is loaded with cobalt, and as<br>
a result, it is usually leaded to only 70-75% of its maximum<br>
theoretical capacity in industrial processes.<br>
In the examples described herein,<br>
(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl){1,3,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phosphinic<br>
acid (which is a compound cf formula (I) exemplified herein)<br>
has been observed to have a cobalt loading capacity<br>
comparable to that of CYANEX 272, but unlike CYANEX 272,<br>
without becoming overly viscous even at maximum cobalt<br>
loading.  Therefore, in embodiments, (2,4,4-<br>
trimethylpentyl)(1,1,3,3 tetramethylbutyl) phosphinic acid<br>
allows for cobalt loading of up to 100% of the theoretical<br>
capacity in industrial processes, an improvement over CYANEX<br>
272 on the order of 25-30%, without encountering viscosity<br>
problems.  An improved practical cobalt loading capacity<br>
and/or reduction in viscosity problems (as has been observed<br>
with (2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)il,1,3,3-<br>
tetramethylbutyl)phosphinic acid in the examples described<br>
herein) may improve the overall efficiency and productivity<br>
in certain applications, such as commercial cobalt (II)<br>
extraction processes.<br>
In the examples described herein, (2,4,4-<br>
trimethylpentyl) (1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phosphinic acid<br>
has also been observed to be better than CYANEX 272 at<br>
rejecting calcium.  In commercial cobalt extraction<br>
processes, cobalt is typically recovered by stripping it<br>
from an organic phase with sulfuric acid.  Co-extraction of<br>
calcium is undesirable because it may lead to the formation<br>
of gypsum at the interface of :he organic phase and water<br>
 <br>
phase during the step of stripping cobalt from the organic<br>
phase, and so may interfere with and decrease the<br>
productivity of the stripping step.  Thus, in embodiments,<br>
an improved calcium rejection (as has been observed with<br>
(2,4,4 -trimethyl-pentyl) (1,1,3,3 -1etramethylbutyl)<br>
phosphinic acid in the examples described herein) may reduce<br>
the amount of calcium that is co-extracted in cobalt<br>
extraction processes, which may improve the productivity and<br>
efficiency of the cobalt stripping step.<br>
Further, in the examples described herein,<br>
(2,4,4 -trimethylpentyl) (1,1,3,3 -tetramethylbutyl)phosphinic<br>
acid has been observed to be more selective for cobalt over<br>
nickel than CYANEX 272.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 5925784 discloses bis(1,1,3,3-<br>
tetramethylbutyl)phosphinic acid and teaches that this<br>
compound has utility as an agent for separating cobalt<br>
and/or nickel.  However, certain properties of bis (1,1,3,3-<br>
tetramethylbutyl)phosphinic acid limit its industrial<br>
utility; for example it is a solid at room temperature and<br>
has limited solubility in the aromatic and aliphatic<br>
solvents commonly used in ths industry for cobalt extraction<br>
processes.  In contrast, in accordance with the present<br>
invention, values of R1 and R7 can be chosen to provide<br>
compounds of formula (I) that are liquids at room<br>
temperature and/or miscible (preferably in all proportions)<br>
with the aromatic and aliphatic solvents used in cobalt<br>
extraction.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be used for<br>
cobalt extraction in accordance with known methods (for<br>
example, as described in U.S. Patent Numbers 5925784,<br>
4353883, and 4348367).  For example, (2,4,4-trimethyl-<br>
 <br>
pentyl)(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl) phosphinic acid can be<br>
directly substituted for CYANEX 272, although it may be<br>
necessary to modify the process somewhat to accommodate for<br>
differences between the chemical and physical properties of<br>
these compounds.  One skilled in the art can adapt such<br>
known methods to incorporat.e the use of compounds of formula<br>
(I) using routine experimentation, without the exercise of<br>
inventive skill.<br>

EXAMPLE 1; SYNTHESIS OF (2,4,4-TRIMETHYLPENTYL)  (1,1,3,3-<br>
TETRAMETHYLBUTYL)PHOSPHINIC ACID<br>
The end product of this second synthesis of<br>
(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl) (1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phosphinic<br>
acid is referred to hereafter as "Batch 1".<br>
(I) Synthesis of (2, 4, 4-trirtethylpentyl) (1,1, 3, 3-tetra-<br>
methylbutyl)phosphine:<br>
2,4,4-tritnethylper.tylphosphine (302.7 g, 99% GC,<br>
2.07 mol, 1.0 eq.), diisobutylene (a mixture of 2,4,4-<br>
trimethyl-pentene-1 and 2,4,4-trimethyl-pentene-2; 348.3 g,<br>
3.11 mol, 1.5 eq.) and diethyleneglycol (295 g, weight ratio<br>
-0.97) were added into a three neck flask under nitrogen.<br>
The mixture was heated to 80°C at which time methanesulfonic<br>
acid (298.9 g, 3.11 mol, 1.5 eq.) was slowly dripped into<br>
the flask through an addition funnel over 50 minutes. The<br>
mixture was further heated to reflux at 120°C and digested<br>
overnight (16 hrs.).<br>
The reaction mixture was cooled and toluene (300<br>
ml) was added followed by slow addition of an aqueous<br>
solution of NaOH (125 g in 500 g water, 3.11 mol, 1.5 eq.)<br>
such that the temperature of the reaction remained<br>
below 60°C.  After vigorous mixing the contents were<br>
transferred to a separatory funnel to allow a clear phase<br>
separation.  The organic phase was then collected and the<br>
solvent and un-reacted starting materials were stripped off<br>
under vacuum at 80°C.  The resulting product (452 g, 85%<br>
yield) was a clear colourless liquid and was analyzed by 31P<br>
NMR and GC.  Results: 31P NMF.: 5 -23.54 (doublet); and GC/MS:<br>
retention time (m/e) 12.70 min (258).<br>
 <br>
(II) Synthesis of (2,4, 4-tr:.methylpentyl) (1,1, 3,3-tetra<br>
methylbutyl)phosphinic acid.<br>
Water (500 g, 1.0 weight ratio relative to volume<br>
of dialkylphosphine) was added to a three-necked round<br>
bottom flask with a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (5 g,<br>
1% relative to weight of water).  The flask was blanketed<br>
with nitrogen and fitted with a mechanical stirring device.<br>
The (2,4,4-trimethylpentyl) (1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)<br>
phosphine (443 g, 1.7 mol, 1.0 eq.; from step (I) above) was<br>
added to the reaction vessel to form a biphasic system, in<br>
which the top layer is the organic phase.  The reaction<br>
mixture was then heated to 50°C under stirring and nitrogen.<br>
The heat source was removed and an aqueous solution of ~25%<br>
hydrogen peroxide (700 g, 5.2 mol, 3.0 eq.) was slowly<br>
dripped into the reaction mixture ensuring that a slow and<br>
steady increase in temperature occurred while avoiding large<br>
and sudden temperature changes.  After one equivalent of H2O2<br>
was added (~50 min), the external heat source was applied to<br>
provide a reaction temperature of &gt; 95°C before the second<br>
equivalent of H2O2 was added, in like fashion (-45 min) .  At<br>
this point the excess H2O2 was added to ensure complete<br>
oxidation of starting material.  The reaction mixture was<br>
digested at &gt; 95°C overnight (16 hrs.) at which time a<br>
sample was extracted for 31P NMR analysis, to determine the<br>
completion of the reaction.  Results: 31P NMR peak: 8 63.53.<br>
Upon completion of the reaction, toluene (~ 200ml)<br>
was added to the mixture to reduce the viscosity of the<br>
organic layer.  The organic phase was then washed with an<br>
equal volume of water.  The organic phase was then washed<br>
further with an aqueous solution of NaOH (100 g in 1L of<br>
water) to achieve a pH ~ 7-8.  The aqueous layer was removed<br>
and the phosphinic acid was restored with an acidic wash<br>
 <br>
(H2SO4 in water, lOg/L).  The desired product was then<br>
stripped of water and dried under vacuum at 80°C to afford a<br>
clear colourless liquid (40fi g, 82% yield) .<br>
Example 2: SYNTHESIS OF (2,4,4-TRIMETHYLPENTYL)  (1,1,3,3-<br>
TETRAMETHYLBUTYL)PHOSPHINIC ACID<br>
The end product of this second synthesis of<br>
(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl) (1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)<br>
phosphinic acid is referred to hereafter as "Batch 2".<br>
(I) Synthesis of (2,4,4-triitethylpentyl) (1,1,3,3-tetra<br>
methylbutyl)phosphine:<br>
2,4,4-trimethylpentylphosphine (412.4 g, 2.82 mol,<br>
1.0 eq.), diisobutylene (a mixture of 2,4,4-trimethyl-<br>
pentene-1 and 2,4,4-trimethyl-pentene-2; 474.3 g, 4.23 mol,<br>
1.5 eq.) and diethyleneglycol (413.3 g, weight ratio -1.00)<br>
were added into a three neck flask under nitrogen.  The<br>
mixture was heated to 80°C a; which time methanesulfonic<br>
acid (4 07.6 g, 4.24 mol, 1.5 eq.) was slowly dripped into<br>
the flask through an addition funnel over 50 minutes. The<br>
mixture was further heated to reflux at 113°C overnight (16<br>
hrs.).<br>
The reaction mixture was cooled down and toluene<br>
(400 ml) was added followed by slow addition of an aqueous<br>
solution of NaOH (174.8 g in 500g water, 4.37 mol, 1.5 eq.)<br>
such that the temperature of the reaction remained below<br>
60°C.  After vigorous mixing the contents were transferred<br>
to a separatory funnel with an additional 500 ml water and<br>
300 ml toluene.  Clear phase separation was observed and the<br>
aqueous layer was removed, followed by an additional wash of<br>
the organic layer with 1 L of water.  The organic phase was<br>
then collected and the solvent and unreacted starting<br>
 <br>
materials were stripped off under vacuum at 80°C.  The<br>
resulting product (562.1 g, 77% yield) was a clear<br>
colourless liquid and was analyzed by 31P NMR and GC.<br>
Results: 31P NMR: 8 -24.76 (doublet); and GC/MS: retention<br>
time (m/e) 14.98 min (258).<br>
(II) Synthesis of (2 , 4 , 4-trinethylpentyl) (1,1, 3, 3-tetra<br>
methylbuty)phosphinic acid:<br>
Water (578 g, -1.0 weight ratio relative to volume<br>
of dialkylphosphine) was added to a three-necked round<br>
bottom flask with a catalytic amount: of sulfuric acid<br>
(5.8 g, 1% relative to weight of water). The flask was<br>
blanketed with nitrogen and fitted with a mechanical<br>
stirring device. The (2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)<br>
(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl) phosphine (556.9 g, 2.16 mol,<br>
1.0 eq.; from step (I) above) was added to the reaction<br>
vessel to form a biphasic system, in which the top layer is<br>
the organic phase.  The reaction mixture was then heated to<br>
50°C under stirring and nitrogen.  The heat source was<br>
removed and an aqueous solution of -25% hydrogen peroxide<br>
(889.8 g, 6.54 mol, 3.0 eq.) was slowly dripped into the<br>
reaction mixture ensuring that a slow and steady increase in<br>
temperature occurred while avoiding large and sudden<br>
temperature changes.  After one equivalent of H2O2 was added<br>
(~12 0 min), the external heat source was returned to ensure<br>
a reaction temperature of &gt; 95°C before the second equivalent<br>
of H2O2 was added, in like fashion (~90 min).  At this point<br>
the excess H2O2 was added to ensure complete oxidation of<br>
starting material.  The reaction mixture was digested at<br>
&gt; 95°C overnight (16 hrs.) at which time a sample was<br>
extracted for 31P NMR analysis, to determine the completion<br>
of the reaction.  Results: 3:P NMR peak: 8 63.52.<br>
 <br>
Upon completion cf the reaction, toluene (~ 500ml)<br>
was added to the mixture tc reduce the viscosity of the<br>
organic layer.  The aqueous phase was removed and the<br>
organic was treated with an aqueous solution of NaOH (100 g<br>
in 1L of water) to achieve a pH - 7-8.  The aqueous layer<br>
was removed and the phosphinic acid was restored with an<br>
acidic wash (H2SO4 in water, lOOg/L).  The desired product<br>
was then stripped of water and dried under vacuum at 80°C to<br>
afford a clear colourless viscous liquid (551.7 g, 88%<br>
yield).  A sample was taken for NMR analysis and methylated<br>
for analysis by GC/MS.  Res alts: 31P NMR peak: 5 65.73; and<br>
GC/MS: retention time (m/e) 19.02 min (272).<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Two samples of the novel extractant, (2,4,4-<br>
trimethylpentyl) (1,1, 3, 3-tetramethylbutyl) phosphinic acid<br>
(Batch 1 and Batch 2) were <ixaminecl by gas></ixaminecl>
chromatography/mass spectros;copy detector (GC/MSD) to fully<br>
characterize the active ingredient, as well as all other<br>
minor components and impurities.  The acidic components were<br>
first converted to their respective methyl esters to allow<br>
for elution from the gas chromatograph column.<br>
1. EXPERIMENTAL<br>
Two samples of (2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)<br>
(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl) phosphinic acid (Batch 1 and<br>
Batch 2) were accurately weighed to the nearest 0.1<br>
milligram and diluted with toluene to a final concentration<br>
of 20% by weight.  A 500 /µL aliquot of the solution was<br>
allowed to react with an equal volume of methylating reagent<br>
(N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal) , and 0.2 µL of the<br>
resulting mixture was injected into the gas chromatograph.<br>
 <br>
2. RESULTS<br>
The results of GC/MSD analysis (area %) for each<br>
component of the 2 samples cf (2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)<br>
(1,1,3 , 3-tetramethylbutyl) phosphinic acid (Batch 1 and<br>
Batch 2) are shown in Table 1.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
3. DISCUSSION<br>
The chromatographs for the two samples of (2,4,4-<br>
trimethylpentyl) (1,1, 3 , 3-tetramethylbutyl) phosphinic acid<br>
(Batch 1 and Batch 2) were similar in the composition of<br>
components and impurities present and slightly different in<br>
the terms of the quantities of components.  Besides the<br>
major component ((2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)<br>
(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl) phosphinic acid), the analysis<br>
indicated the presence of the corresponding impurities<br>
namely the dialkyl phosphinic acids, the monoalkyl<br>
phosphonic acids and the phcsphine oxides. The presence of<br>
the monoalkyl phosphonic acids must be minimized as they<br>
tend to reduce the cobalt/nickel selectivity of the<br>
extractant.<br>
EXAMPLE 4: Characterization of 2,4,4-trimethylpentyl<br>
(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phosphinic acid<br>
The following test work involved studying the<br>
performance of the new extractant (2,4,4-trimethyl-<br>
pentyl) (1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phosphinic acid (TEST 1)<br>
and CYANEX 272.  The experiments examined the extraction of<br>
single metals from sulfate solutions and their mutual<br>
selectivity as a function of pH, loading capacity of cobalt<br>
and viscosity of organic solutions as a function of cobalt<br>
loading.<br>
 <br>
PART A - EXTRACTION FROM sINGLE METAL SULFATE SOLUTIONS AT<br>
VARYING pH<br>
A.1       EXPERIMENTAL<br>
The single metal aqueous solutions were prepared<br>
by dissolving a weighed amount of the respective sulfate<br>
salt and a weighed amount cf sodium sulfate salt in<br>
deionized water.  The metal concentration in each solution<br>
was 0.001M, except Fe(III) which was 0.0015M.  The sodium<br>
sulfate concentration was 0.5M for all solutions.  The<br>
metals studied were Co(II), Ni(II), Ca(II), Mg(II), Mn(II),<br>
Zn(II), Pe(III), and Cu(II).<br>
The organic solutions were prepared by diluting<br>
(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phosphinic<br>
acid or CYANEX 272 to 0. 1M o:: phosphinic acid with ISOPAR M<br>
diluent.  ISOPAR M is an aliphatic (&gt;99.5%) hydrocarbon<br>
diluent commercially available from Imperial Oil, Canada.<br>
Equilibrium distributions of the various metals<br>
between organic and aqueous phases as a function of pH were<br>
determined at 50°C by contacting equal volumes (300 mL) of<br>
the two phases in a jacketed beaker and mixed with<br>
mechanical stirring.  The temperature of the solution during<br>
extraction was maintained at 50°C by a circulating bath.<br>
The pH was adjusted by adding a known volume of either<br>
sodium hydroxide or sulfuric acid to the aqueous phase.  A<br>
contact time of 15 minutes was used between each pH<br>
adjustment.  Samples of each phase were withdrawn (15 mL)<br>
and analysed.<br>
The equilibrium pH of the aqueous raffinate<br>
samples was measured using a ROSS combination pH electrode<br>
calibrated at room temperature with pH 1.00 (potassium<br>
 <br>
chloride - hydrochloric acid buffer), 4.00 (potassium<br>
biphthlate buffer), and 7.00 (potassium phosphate monobasic<br>
- sodium hydroxide buffer) buffer solutions.<br>
For all experiments, the aqueous samples were<br>
analysed by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS).  The metal<br>
concentration in the organic phase for each sample was<br>
deduced by subtracting the raffinate concentration from the<br>
initial metal concentration in the feed solution.<br>
A.2       RESULTS<br>
Besides cobalt, nickel and calcium, other metals<br>
(i.e. zinc, iron, copper, magnesium and manganese) were also<br>
studied. There was however no significant difference between<br>
(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phosphinic<br>
acid and CYANEX 272 for these metals and their numerical<br>
data are therefore not reported here. The numerical data for<br>
the extraction of cobalt, calcium and nickel as a function<br>
of pH using (2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)(1,1,3,3-<br>
tetramethylbutyl) phosphinic acid and CYANEX 272 are shown<br>
in Table 2.  Table 3 shows the pH50 values for each metal<br>
using (2,4,4-trimethylpentyl) (1,1,3, 3-tetramethylbutyl)<br>
phosphinic acid ("TEST") and CYANEX 272 as well as the ApH50<br>
(ApH50 = pH50Co - pH50metals) values, respectively.  The<br>
pH50 values were determined using the log of the distribution<br>
ratio, log D, and plotting the values as a function of pH.<br>
The distribution coefficient, D, is defined as the ratio of<br>
the total metal content in the organic phase to the metal<br>
content in the aqueous phase.<br>
The results indicate selectivity for cobalt-<br>
nickel, cobalt-zinc, cobalt-Iron, and cobalt-calcium for<br>
(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl) (1,1, 3,3-tetramethylbutyl) phosphinic<br>
acid.  Furthermore, (2, 4, 4-t:rimethylpentyl)<br>
 <br>
(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl) phosphinic acid shows a<br>
substantial increase in selectivity over CYANEX 272 for<br>
cobalt over both calcium and. nickel.  This higher cobalt-<br>
calcium selectivity could have a great advantage in a<br>
solvent extraction plant by decreasing the formation of<br>
gypsum in the circuit.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
PART B - COBALT LOADING CAPACITY AND VISCOSITY<br>
B.1       EXPERIMENTAL FOR THE LOADING CAPACITY OF COBALT<br>
The aqueous solution was prepared by dissolving a<br>
weighed amount of cobalt sulfate salt in deionized water.<br>
The metal concentration in :he solution was 40 g/L.  The<br>
organic solutions were prepared by diluting (2,4,4-tri-<br>
methylpentyl)(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phosphinic acid<br>
extractant or CYANEX 272 to 0.14M of phosphinic acid with<br>
ISOPAR M diluent.  ISOPAR M is an aliphatic (&gt;99.5%)<br>
hydrocarbon diluent commercially available from Imperial<br>
Oil, Canada.<br>
Equilibrium distributions of cobalt between the<br>
organic and aqueous phases vas determined at 50°C by<br>
contacting an aqueous volume (250 mL) and an organic volume<br>
(50 mL) to give an aqueous to organic phase ratio of 5.  The<br>
two phases were contacted in a jacketed beaker and mixed<br>
with mechanical stirring.  The temperature of the solution<br>
during the extraction was maintained at 50°C by a<br>
circulating bath.  The pH was adjusted by adding a known<br>
volume of sodium hydroxide to the aqueous phase.  A constant<br>
pH of 6.13 ± 0.03 for a period of 15 minutes was necessary<br>
to ensure maximum loading of the metal.  The phases were<br>
separated and the organic fiLtered through phase separating<br>
(P/S) paper to ensure that no entrained aqueous was present.<br>
The metal concentration in the organic was determined by<br>
stripping with 100 g/L H2SO4 using equal volumes of both<br>
phases (4 0 mL) for 5 minutes at room temperature.  The strip<br>
liquor was collected in a sanple vial.  An aliquot (35 mL)<br>
of the stripped organic was stripped a second time with an<br>
equal volume (35 mL) of fresh acid.  This was repeated a<br>
 <br>
third time using 30 mL of stripped organic and 30 mL of<br>
fresh acid.<br>
The three strip liquors were kept separate and<br>
analysed individually by ICP.  The three strip liquor<br>
concentrations were summed to determine the amount of cobalt<br>
loaded.  A total of three loading tests were completed<br>
(TEST 1, TEST 2, and TEST 3).<br>
The equilibrium pH of the aqueous samples was<br>
measured as previously described in section above.<br>
B.2       EXPERIMENTAL FOR THE VISCOSITY OF ORGANIC<br>
SOLUTIONS AS A FUNCTION OF COBALT LOADING<br>
The aqueous solution was prepared by dissolving a<br>
weighed amount of cobalt sulfate salt in deionized water.<br>
The metal concentration in the solution was 40 g/L.<br>
The organic solutions were prepared by diluting a<br>
weighed amount of either CYANEX 272 (200 grams, Lot#<br>
WE2060451) or (2 , 4, 4-trimet:iylpentyl) (1,1, 3 , 3-tetramethyl-<br>
buty)phosphinic acid extratant (200 grams, TEST 3)<br>
extractant to 20% (w/w) with ISOPAR M diluent.  These<br>
solutions were split in two equal portions in order to<br>
prepare the different per cent cobalt loading.<br>
Equilibrium distributions of cobalt between the<br>
organic and aqueous phases were determined as previously<br>
described in the section above with the exceptions that the<br>
temperature was room temperature and the aqueous to organic<br>
phase ratio was of unity (500 mL volume for each phase).  A<br>
constant pH of 5.90 ± 0.02, and pH of 6.05 ± 0.02 for<br>
CYANEX 272 and (2,4,4-trimethylpentyl) (1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-<br>
butyl) phosphinic acid extrectant (TEST 3), respectively,<br>
for a period of 15 minutes vas necessary to ensure maximum<br>
 <br>
loading of the metal. Phases were separated and the organic<br>
was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 3000 rpm to ensure that no<br>
entrained aqueous or precipitate was present.<br>
Samples were next prepared by mixing 100% loaded<br>
and 0% loaded at various volumes such that viscosities of<br>
0%, 10%, 30%, 45%, 60%, 75%, 90%, and 100% cobalt loading<br>
could be measured at varying temperatures.<br>
The samples were Tested using a TA Instruments'<br>
AR1000N rheometer.  A step Flow method was used in 90 second<br>
intervals ranging 10 to 60°C.  In most cases data points<br>
were collected at least eve:ry 10°C.  Temperature control<br>
(+/- 0.l°C) was provided by a Peltier plate.  The geometry<br>
consisted of a 60 mm cone and plate with a 2° angle. All<br>
samples were found to be Newtonian, i.e., their viscosities<br>
are independent of the shear rate. Thus tests with varying<br>
temperatures reported were all done at the same shear rate<br>
(500/s).<br>
B. 3       RESULTS<br>
The calculated cobalt concentration in the organic<br>
phase was determined for three samples of (2,4,4-trimethyl-<br>
pentyl) (1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyDphosphinic acid (TEST 1,<br>
TEST 2,and TEST 3) and CYANEX 272 and is shown in Table 4.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
The results indicate a slight difference in the<br>
loading capacity of the two extractants with CYANEX 272<br>
having a slightly higher maximum cobalt loading capacity<br>
than (2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)<br>
phosphinic acid.<br>
The following two tables (5 and 6) show the<br>
viscosity of both (2, 4, 4-trimethylpentyl) (1,1, 3, 3-tetr-<br>
methylbutyl) phosphinic acid and CYANEX 272.  Results<br>
indicate that the viscosity does not change much with<br>
varying cobalt solution loadings for (2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)<br>
(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl) phosphinic acid.  On the other<br>
hand, there is a large increase in viscosity between 75, 90,<br>
and 100% cobalt solution loading for the CYANEX 272 samples.<br>
On a practical basis, this means that 100% cobalt loading<br>
can be achieved with (2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)(1,1,3,3-tetra-<br>
methylbutyl) phosphinic acid whereas CYANEX 272 is limited<br>
to 70-75% cobalt loading to limit the viscosity issues.<br>
