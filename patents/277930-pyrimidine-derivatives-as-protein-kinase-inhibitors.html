				<td>PYRIMIDINE DERIVATIVES AS PROTEIN KINASE INHIBITORS<br>
The present invention relates to substituted pyrirnidine derivatives and their use in therapy. More specifically, but not exclusively, the invention relates to compounds that are capable of inhibiting one or more protein kinases, particularly polo-like kinases.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
The Polo-like kinase family consists of key cell cycle regulatory enzymes with integral roles in controlling entry into and progression through mitosis. Many tumour cells express high levels of PLK1 and are responsive to antisense oligonucleotides targeting this protein.<br>
Initiation of mitosis requires activation of M-phase promoting factor (MPF), i.e. the complex between CDK1 and B-type cyclins [Nurse, P. (1990) Nature, 344, 503-508]. The latter accumulate during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle and promote the inhibitory phosphorylation of the MPF complex by WEE1, MIK1, and MYT1 kinases. At the end of the G2 phase, corresponding dephosphorylation by the dual-specificity phosphatase CDC25C triggers the activation of MPF [Nigg, E.A. (2001) Nat. Rev. Mol Cell Biol, 2, 21-32]. In interphase, cyclin B localizes to the cytoplasm and becomes phosphorylated during prophase, followed by nuclear translocation. The nuclear accumulation of active MPF during prophase is thought to be important for initiating M-phase events [Takizawa, C.G. and Morgan, D.O. (2000) Curr. Opin. Cell Biol, 12, 658-665]. However, nuclear MPF is kept inactive by WFJB1 unless counteracted by CDC25C. The phosphatase CDC25C itself, localized to the cytoplasm during interphase, accumulates in the nucleus in prophase. The nuclear entry of both cyclin B and CDC25C are promoted through phosphorylation by PLK1 [Roshak, A.K., Capper, E.A., hnburgia, C, Fornwald, L, Scott, G. and Marshall, L.A. (2000) Cell. Signalling, 12, 405-411]. This kinase is thus an important regulator of M-phase initiation.<br>
In humans, there exist three closely related polo-like kinases (PLKs) [Glover, D.M., Hagan, I.M. and Tavares, A.A. (1998) Genes Dev., 12, 3777-3787]. They contain a highly homologous N-terminal catalytic kinase domain and their C-termini contain two or three conserved regions, the polo boxes. The function of the polo boxes remains incompletely understood but polo box-dependent PLK1 activity is required for proper metaphase/anaphase transition and cytokinesis [Seong, Y.-S., Kamijo, K., Lee, J.-S., Fernandez, E., Kuriyama, R., MM, T. and Lee, K.S. (2002) J. Biol. Chem., 277, 32282 -32293]. Of the three PLKs, PLK1 is the best characterized; it regulates a number of cell division cycle effects, including the onset of mitosis, DNA-damage checkpoint activation, regulation of the anaphase promoting complex, phosphorylation of the proteasome, and centrosome duplication and maturation. Mammalian PLK2 (also known as SNK) and PLK3 (also known as PRK and FNK) were originally shown to be immediate early gene products. PLK3 kinase activity appears to peak during late S and G2 phase. It is also activated during DNA damage checkpoint activation and severe oxidative stress. PLK3 also plays an important role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and centrosome function in the cell and deregulated PLK3 expression results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [Wang, Q., Xie, S., Chen, J., Fukusawa, K., Naik, U., Traganos, F., Darzynkiewicz, Z., Jhanwar-Uniyal, M. and Dai, W. (2002) Mol. Cell. Biol, 22,3450-3459]. PLK2 is the least-well understood homologue of the three PLKs. Both PLK2 and PLK3 may have additional important post-mitotic functions [Kauselmann, G., Weiler, M., Wulff, P., Jessberger, S., Konietzko, U., Scafidi, J., Staubli, U., Bereiter-Hahn, J., Strebhardt, K. and Kuhl, D. (1999) EMBO J., 18, 5528-5539].<br>
The fact that human PLKs regulate some fundamental aspects of mitosis was shown by anri-PIXl antibody microinjection of human tumour cells [Lane, H.A. and Nigg, E.A. (1996) J. Cell. Biol, 135, 1701-1713]. This treatment had no effect on DNA replication but impaired cell division. Cells were arrested in mitosis and showed abnormal dfetribution of condensed chromatin and monoastral microtubules nucleated from duplicated but unseparated centrosomes. By contrast, non-immortalized human cells<br>
arrested as single, mononucleated cells in G2. Moreover, when PLK1 function was blocked through adenovirus-mediated delivery of a dominant-negative gene, tumour-selective apoptosis in many tumour cell lines was observed, whereas again normal epithelial cells, although arrested in mitosis, escaped the mitotic catastrophe seen in tumour cells [Cogswell, J.P., Brown, C.E., Bisi, J.E. and Neill, S.D. (2000) Cell Growth Differ., 11, 615-623]. PLK1 activity is thus necessary for the functional maturation of centrosomes in late G2/early prophase and subsequent establishment of a bipolar spindle. Furthermore, these results suggest the presence in normal cells of a centrosome-maturation checkpoint that is sensitive to PLK1 impairment. Depletion of cellular PLK1 through the small interfering RNA (siKNA) technique also confirmed that this protein is required for multiple mitotic processes and completion of cytokinesis [Liu, X. and Erikson, R.L. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci. USA, 100, 5789-5794], A potential therapeutic rationale for PLK inhibition is also suggested by work with PLK1-specific antisense oligonucleotides, which were shown to induce growth inhibition in cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo [Spankuch-Schmitt, B., Wolf, G., Solbach, C, Loibl, S., Knecht, R., Stegmuller, M., von Minckwitz, G., Kaufmann, M. and Strebhardt, K. (2002) Oncogene, 21, 3162-3171]. Constitutive expression of PLK1 in mammalian cells was shown to lead to malignant transformation [Smith, M.R., Wilson, MX., Hamanaka, R., Chase, D., Kung, H., Longo, D.L. and Ferris, D.K. (1997) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 234, 397-405]. Furthermore, overexpression of PLK1 is frequently observed in human tumours and PLK1 expression is of prognostic value for patients suffering from various types of tumours [Takahashi, T., Sano, B., Nagata, T., Kato, H., Sugiyama, Y., Kunieda, K., Kimura, M., Okano, Y. and Saji, S. (2003) Cancer Science, 94, 148-152; Tokumitsu, Y., Mori, M., Tanaka, S., Akazawa, K., Nakano, S. and Niho, Y. (1999) Int. J. Oncol, 15, 687-692; Wolf, G., Elez, R., Doermer, A., Holtrich, U., Ackermann, H., Stutte, H.J., Altmannsberger, H.-M., Rubsamen-Waigmann, H. and Strebhardt, K. (1997) Oncogene, 14, 543-549].<br>
Although the therapeutic potential of pharmacological PLK inhibition has been appreciated [Kraker, A.J. and Booher, R.N. (1999) In Annual Reports in Medicinal<br>
Chemistry (Vol. 34) (Doherty, A.M., ed.), pp. 247-256, Academic Press], very little has been reported to date concerning small molecule PLK inhibitors that may be useful as drugs. One of the few biochemical PLK1 inhibitors characterized to date is scytonemin, a symmetric indolic marine natural product [Stevenson, C.S., Capper, E.A., Roshak, A.K., Marquez, B., Eichman, C, Jackson, J.R., Mattern, M., Gerwick, W.H., Jacobs, R.S. and Marshall, L.A. (2002) J. Pharmacol Exp. Ther.s 303, 858-866; Stevenson, C.S., Capper, E.A., Roshak, A.K., Marquez, B., Grace, K., Gerwick, W.H., Jacobs, RS. and Marshall, L.A. (2002) Inflammation Research, 51, 112-114]. Scytonemin inhibits phosphorylation of CDC25C by recombinant PLK1 with an IC50 value of about 2 µM (at an ATP concentration of 10 µM). Inhibition is apparently reversible and the mechanism with respect to ATP of mixed-competitive mode. Similar potency against other protein serine/threonine- and dual specificity cell-cycle kinases, including MYT1, CHK1, CDKl/cyclin B, and PKC, was observed, Scytonemin showed pronounced anti-proliferative effects on various human cell lines in vitro. Further small molecule PLK inhibitors and their use in the treatment of proliferative disorders are described in International patent application WO2004/067000 in the name of Cyclacel Limited.<br>
The present invention seeks to elucidate new small molecule PLK inhibitors. More specifically, the invention seeks to provide small molecule PLK inhibitors that have therapeutic applications in the treatment of a range of proliferative disorders.<br>

Advantageously, certain compounds of the invention exhibit improved selectivity for      one or more kinases compared to structurally related compounds previously known in the art<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the compound of the invention exhibits selectivity for one or more kinases over one or more other kinases.<br>
For example, in one preferred embodiment, the compound of the invention is capable of preferentially inhibiting PLK family kinases over one or more other protein kinases; thus the compound is capable of "selectively" inhibiting PLK family kinases over one or more other protein kinases. As used herein, the term "selectively" refers to the compounds that are selective for PLK over one or more other protein kinases. Preferably, the selectivity ratio for PLK family kinases over one or more other protein kinases is greater than about 2 to 1, more preferably greater than about 5 to 1 or about 10 to 1, even more preferably greater than about 20 to 1, or 50 to 1 or 100 to 1. Selectivity ratios may be determined by the skilled person in the art.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment, the compound of the invention displays selectivity for PLK1. Thus, in one preferred embodiment, the compound of the invention is capable of preferentially inhibiting PLK1 over one or more other protein kinases. Preferably, the selectivity ratio for PLK1 over one or more other protein kinases is greater than about 2 to 1, more preferably greater than about 5 to 1 or about 10 to 1, even more preferably greater than about 20 to 1, or 50 to 1 or 100 to 1.<br>
In an even more preferred embodiment, the compound of the invention displays selectivity for PLK1 over PLK2 and/or PLK3. Thus, in one preferred embodiment, the compound of the invention is capable of preferentially inhibiting PLK1 over PLK2 and/or PLK3. Preferably, the selectivity ratio for PLK1 over PLK2 and/or PLK3 is greater than about 2 to 1, more preferably greater than about 5 to 1 or about 10 to 1, even more preferably greater than about 20 to 1, or 50 to 1 or 100 to 1.<br>
By way of illustration, compound [218] displays selectivity for PLK1 over PLK2 and PLK3 compared with selected compounds of the prior art. For example, compound [218] of the invention is twice as selective for PLK1 versus PLK2 compared to compound [1-64] of WO 07/095188, ca 6-fold more selective than compound [1-76]<br>
and 7-fold more selective than compound p~4] of WO 07/095188. Similarly, compound [218] is 5-fold more selective for PLK1 versus PLK3 compared to compound [1-64] of WO 07/095188, ca 12-fold more selective than compound [1-76] and 5-fold more selective than compound [1-4] of WO 07/095188. Further details may be found in the accompanying Examples.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the compounds of the invention exhibit superior solubility and/or pharmacokinetic properties when compared to structurally related compounds already known in the art<br>
For Example, compound [254] displays superior solubility and/or pharmacokinetic properties to Examples [1-76] and [1-253] of WO 07/095188, thereby rendering the compound more suitable for the treatment of diseases. Again, further details of these comparative studies may be found in the accompanying Examples.<br>
Similarly, compound [371] displays advantageous pharmacokinetic properties in terms of its systemic exposure and oral bioavailability, compared to structurally related compounds known in the art<br>
One preferred embodiment of the invention relates to a subset of compounds that are characterised by low cellular efflux by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters such as the drug-efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp). It is known that P-gp efflux substrates commonly show poor oral absorption due to the action of P-gp which can transport absorbed drug back into the gut [Ambudkar S.V., et al. (2003) Oncogene, 22, 7468-7485]. P-gp can also reduce the systemic exposure of substrates through promoting excretion into bile and urine. In addition to being drug efflux pumps, ABC transporters can confer drug resistance to tumour cells through elevated expression. Expression of P-gp is widely known to be a mechanism by which cancer cells can acquire multi-drug resistance (MDR) [Gottesman M.M., et al. (2002) Nat. Rev. Cancer, 2, 48-58]. Certain tumours derived from cells that normally express P-gp can exhibit intrinsic drug resistance [Ambudkar S.V., et al. (2005) Trends Pharmacol. Set, 26,<br>
385-387]. Drugs that are readily transported out of cells do not accumulate in high levels in transporter-expressing cells, limiting the success of the therapy due to reduced drug-target interaction.<br>
Compounds exhibiting low cellular efflux therefore potentially have applications in the oral treatment of cancer, treatment of epithelial cell derived tumours and drug-resistant malignancies, as well has having a lower potential for inducing drug resistance through increased efflux pump expression. Particularly preferred compounds of the invention that exhibit low cellular efflux include compounds [371], [372] and [377]-[391]. Further details of cell viabihty assays and cellular efflux studies may be found in the Example 9 and Figure 3.<br>
In addition, compounds of the invention which exhibit low MDR/parental cell asymmetry in cell viability assays are also more effective at inhibiting PLK1 within MDR tumour cells than compounds of the prior art. Thus, these compounds have greater potential as therapeutic PLK inhibitors. Details of experiments measuring PLK1 inhibition in A2780 - A2780/ADR cell line pairs are set forth in the accompanying examples.<br>
THERAPEUTIC USE<br>
The compounds of the invention have been found to possess anti-proliferative activity and are therefore believed to be of use in the treatment of proliferative disorders such as cancers, leukaemias and other disorders associated with uncontrolled cellular proliferation such as psoriasis and restenosis.<br>

A further aspect of the invention relates to a method of treating a PLK-dependent disorder, said method comprising administering to a subject in need thereof, a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as defined above in an amount sufficient to inhibit PLK.<br>
<br>
The polo-like kinases (PLKs) constitute a family of serine/threonine protein kinases. Mitotic Drosophila melanogaster mutants at the polo locus display spindle abnormalities [Sunkel et al, J. Cell Sci., 1988, 89, 25] and polo was found to encode a mitotic kinase [Llamazares et al, Genes Dev., 1991, 5, 2153]. In humans, there exist three closely related PLKs [Glover et al., Genes Dev., 1998,12, 3777]. They contain a highly homologous ammo-terminal catalytic kinase domain and their carboxyl termini contain two or three conserved regions, the polo boxes. The function of the polo boxes remains incompletely understood but they are implicated in the targeting of PLKs to subcellular compartments [Lee et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1998, 95, 9301; Leung et al, Nat. Struct. Biol, 2002, 9, 719], mediation of interactions with other proteins [Kauselrnann et al, EMBO J., 1999, 18, 5528], or may constitute part of an autoregulatory domain [Nigg, Curr. Opin. Cell Biol., 1998, 10, 776]. Furthermore, the polo box-dependent PLK1 activity is required for proper metaphase/anaphase transition and cytokinesis [Yuan et al, Cancer Res., 2002, 62, 4186; Seong etal, X Biol. Chem., 2002,277, 32282].<br>
Studies have shown that human PLKs regulate some fundamental aspects of mitosis [Lane et al, J. Cell. Biol, 1996, 135, 1701; Cogswell et al, Cell Growth Differ., 2000, 11, 615]. In particular, PLK1 activity is believed to be necessary for the functional maturation of centrosomes in late G2/early prophase and subsequent establishment of a bipolar spindle. Depletion of cellular PLK1 through the small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique has also confirmed that this protein is required for multiple mitotic processes and completion of cytokinesis [Liu et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 2002,99, 8672].<br>
In a more preferred embodiment of the invention, the compound of the invention is administered in an amount sufficient to inhibit PLK1.<br>
Of the three human PLKs, PLK1 is the best characterized; it regulates a number of cell division cycle effects, including the onset of mitosis [Toyoshima-Morimoto et al, Nature, 2001, 410, 215; Roshak et al, Cell Signalling, 2000, 12, 405], DNA-damage checkpoint activation [Smits et al., Nat. Cell Biol, 2000,2, 672; van Vugt et al., J. Biol.<br>
hem., 2001, 276, 41656], regulation of the anaphase promoting complex [Sumara et al, Mol Cell, 2002, 9, 515; Golan et al, J. Biol Chem., 2002, 277, 15552; Kotani et al, Mol. Cell, 1998, 1, 371], phosphorylation of the proteasome [Feng et al, Cell Growth Differ., 2001, 12, 29], and centrosome duplication and maturation [Dai et al, Oitcogene, 2002,21, 6195].<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment, the compounds of the invention are ATP-antagonistic inhibitors of PLK1.<br>
In the present context ATP antagonism refers to the ability of an inhibitor compound to diminish or prevent PLK catalytic activity, i.e. phosphotransfer from ATP to a macromolecular PLK substrate, by virtue of reversibly or irreversibly binding at the enayme's active site in such a manner as to impair or abolish ATP binding.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the compound of the invention is administered in an amount sufficient to inhibit PLK2 and/or PLK3.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to a method of inhibiting PLK in a cell comprising contacting said cell with an amount of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, such that PLK is inhibited in said cell.<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention relates to a method of treating a proliferative disorder comprising inhibiting PLK by adininistering to a subject in need thereof, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, such that treatment of said proliferative disorder occurs.<br>

SALTS/ESTERS<br>
The compounds of the invention can be present as salts or esters, in particular<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention include suitable acid addition or base salts thereof. A review of suitable pharmaceutical salts may be found in Berge et al, J Pharm Sci, 66, 1-19 (1977). Salts are formed, for example with strong inorganic acids such as mineral acids, e.g. sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid or<br>
hydiohalic acids; with strong organic carboxylic acids, such, as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 4 carbon atoms which are unsubstituted or substituted (e.g., by halogen), such as acetic acid; with saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, phthalic or tetraphthalic; with hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid; with aminoacids, for example aspartic or glutamic acid; with benzoic acid; or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (C1-C4)-alkyl- or aryl-sulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted (for example, by a halogen) such as methane- or p-toluene sulfonic acid. Preferably, the salt is an HC1 salt<br>
Esters are formed either using organic acids or alcohols/hydroxides, depending on the functional group being esterified. Organic acids include carboxylic acids, such as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 12 carbon atoms which are unsubstituted or substituted (e.g., by halogen), such as acetic acid; with saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, phthalic or tetraphthalic; with hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid; with aminoacids, for example aspartic or glutamic acid; with benzoic acid; or with, organic sulfonic acids, such as (C1-C4)-aIkyl- or aryl-sulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted (for example, by a halogen) such as methane- or p-toluene sulfonic acid. Suitable hydroxides include inorganic hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, aluminium hydroxide. Alcohols include alkanealcohols of 1-12 carbon atoms which may be unsubstituted or substituted, e.g. by a halogen).<br>
ENANTIOMERS/TAUTOMERS<br>
In all aspects of the present invention previously discussed, the invention includes, where appropriate all enantiomers and tautomers of the compounds of the invention. The person skilled in the art will recognise compounds that possess an optical properties (one or more chiral carbon atoms) or tautomeric characteristics.    The<br>
 <br>
corresponding enantiomers and/or tautomers may be isolated/prepared by methods known in the art.<br>
STEREO AND GEOMETRIC ISOMERS<br>
Some of the compounds of the invention may exist as stereoisomers and/or geometric isomers - e.g. they may possess one or more asymmetric and/or geometric centres and so may exist in two or more stereoisomeric and/or geometric forms. The present invention contemplates the use of all the individual stereoisomers and geometric isomers of those inhibitor agents, and mixtures thereof. The terms used in the claims encompass these forms, provided said forms retain the appropriate functional activity (though not necessarily to the same degree).<br>
The present invention also includes all suitable isotopic variations of the agent or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. An isotopic variation of an agent of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is defined as one in which at least one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number but an atomic mass different from the atomic mass usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine and chlorine such as 2H, 3H, 13C, I4C, 15N, l70,180,31P, 32P, 35S, 18F and 36C1, respectively. Certain isotopic variations of the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for example, those in which a radioactive isotope such as 3H or 14C is incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 4C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopic variations of the agent of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof of this invention can generally be prepared by conventional procedures using appropriate isotopic variations of suitable reagents.<br>
SOLVATES<br>
The present invention also includes solvate forms of the compounds of the present invention. The terms used in the claims encompass these forms.<br>
POLYMORPHS<br>
The invention furthermore relates to the compounds of the present invention in their various crystalline forms, polymorphic forms and (an)hydrous forms. It is well established within the pharmaceutical industry that chemical compounds may be isolated in any of such forms by slightly varying the method of purification and or isolation form the solvents used in the synthetic preparation of such compounds.<br>
PRODRUGS<br>
The invention further includes the compounds of the present invention in prodrug form. Such prodrugs are generally compounds of the invention wherein one . or more appropriate groups have been modified such that the modification may be reversed upon administration to a human or mammalian subject. Such reversion is usually performed by an enzyme naturally present in such subject, though it is possible for a second agent to be administered together with such a prodrug in order to perform the reversion in vivo. Examples of such modifications include ester (for example, any of those described above), wherein the reversion may be carried out be an esterase etc. Other such systems will be well known to those skilled in the art<br>
ADMINISTRATION<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be adapted for oral, rectal, vaginal, parenteral, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intraarterial, intrathecal, intrabronchial, subcutaneous, intradermal, intravenous, nasal, buccal or sublingual routes of administration.<br>
For oral administration, particular use is made of compressed tablets, pills, tablets, gellules, drops, and capsules. Preferably, these compositions contain from 1 to 250 mg and more preferably from 10-100 mg, of active ingredient per dose.<br>
Other forms of administration comprise solutions or emulsions which may be injected intravenously, intraarterially, intrathecally, subcutaneously, intradermally, intraperitoneally or intramuscularly, and which are prepared from sterile or sterilisable solutions. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be in form of suppositories, pessaries, suspensions, emulsions, lotions, ointments, creams, gels, sprays, solutions or dusting powders.<br>
An alternative means of transdermal administration is by use of a skin patch. For example, the active ingredient can be incorporated into a cream consisting of an aqueous emulsion of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin. The active ingredient can also be incorporated, at a concentration of between 1 and 10% by weight, into an ointment consisting of a white wax or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilisers and preservatives as may be required.<br>
Injectable forms may contain between 10 - 1000 mg, preferably between 10 - 250 mg, of active ingredient per dose.<br>
Compositions may be formulated in unit dosage form, i.e., in the form of discrete portions containing a unit dose, or a multiple or sub-unit of a unit dose.<br>
DOSAGE<br>
A person of ordinary skill in the art can easily determine an appropriate dose of one of the instant compositions to administer to a subject without undue experimentation. Typically, a physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will depend on a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and' length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of<br>
administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the individual undergoing therapy. The dosages disclosed herein are exemplary of the average case. There can of course be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention.<br>
Depending upon the need, the agent may be administered at a dose of from 0.01 to 30 mg/kg body weight, such as from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, more preferably from 0.1 to 1 mg/kg body weight.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, one or more doses of 10 to 150 mg/day will be adrninistered to the patient for the treatment of malignancy.<br>
COMBINATIONS<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the one or more compounds of the invention are administered in combination with one or more other active agents, for example, existing anticancer drugs available on the market. In such cases, the compounds of the invention may be administered consecutively, simultaneously or sequentially with the one or more other active agents.<br>
Anticancer drugs in general are more effective when used in combination. In particular, combination therapy is desirable in order to avoid an overlap of major toxicities, mechanism of action and resistance mechanism(s). Furthermore, it is also desirable to administer most drugs at their maximum tolerated doses with minimum time intervals between such doses. The major advantages of combining chemotherapeutic drugs are that it may promote additive or possible synergistic effects through biochemical interactions and also may decrease the emergence of resistance in early tumor cells which would have been otherwise responsive to initial chemotherapy with a single agent. An example of the use of biochemical interactions in selecting drug combinations is demonstrated by the administration of leucovorin to increase the<br>
binding of an active intracellular metabolite of 5-fluorouracil to its target, thymidylate synthase, thus increasing its cytotoxic effects.<br>
Numerous combinations are used in current treatments of cancer and leukemia, A more extensive review of medical practices may be found in "Oncologic Therapies" edited by E. E. Vokes and H. M. Golomb, published by Springer.<br>
Beneficial combinations may be suggested by studying the growth inhibitory activity of the test compounds with agents known or suspected of being valuable in the treatment of a particular cancer initially or cell lines derived from that cancer. This procedure can also be used to determine the order of administration of the agents, i.e. before, simultaneously, or after delivery. Such scheduling may be a feature of all the cycle acting agents identified herein.<br>
PROCESS<br>
Another aspect relates to a process for preparing a compound of the invention, said process comprising the steps of: (i)      converting a compound of formula (II) to a compound of formula (IV) either<br>
directly or via isolation of a compound of formula (III); and (h)      converting said compound of formula (IV) to a compound of formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Preferably, step (i) comprises heating said compound of formula (II) with NH4CI and Fe in EtOH/H20.<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by way of the following non-limiting examples, and with reference to the following figures, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 shows the area under the curve (AUC) for the plasma concentration of compounds A-H versus time for each compound tested. The dosing vehicle across these experiments remained constant (intravenous = citrate buffer pH 3, 1 rnL/kg; oral = DMA/PEG400/10mM Tartrate buffer, pH 4 (1:3:6), 5 ml/kg); Figure 2 represents the same data as Figure 1, but in the form of oral bioavailability (% F) for each compound.<br>
Figure 3 shows a comparison of selected compounds versus prior art compounds A'-J' (defined in table 8) in parental and MDR tumor cells. Asymmetry ratios are presented relative to compound [378].<br>

1. [Analogous to Method III in Abdel-Magid A.F. et al. (1996) J. Org. Chem., 61, 3849-3862] sodium triacetoxyborohydride (1.5 eq), acetic acid (1 eq), amine (1.1 eq), THF, rt 20h; 2. H2, 10% Pd/C, 60 °C, methanol, flow hydrogenation; 3. sodium iodide (4 eq), chlorotrimethylsilane (4 eq), acetonitrile, 0 °C -rt, 18k<br>
Step 1:<br>
N-benzyloxycarbonyl-4-aminocyclohexanone, a compound known in the art [WO2007/002181 A2] (typically 1 mmol scale), was added to a reaction tube containing THF (5 mL), the appropriate substituted-piperazine, -homopiperazine, or morpholine, along with acetic acid and sodium triacetoxyborohydride. The reaction was stirred at ambient temperature for 20 hours. The reaction was quenched with NaHCO3 solution (2 mL) before acidifying to pH2 with IN HCl solution. The mixture was washed with EtOAc before separating the aqueous layer and basifying to pHIO with 2N NaOH solution. The product was extracted into EtOAc, which was washed with sat. NaCl, dried (MgSO/t) and evaporated under reduced pressure to provide the required benzyl 4-(amine-substituted)cyclohexylcarbamate.<br>
Step 2:<br>
Each benzyl 4-(amine-substimted)cyclohexylcarbamate were dissolved in methanol to a concentration of 0.05 M. Hydrogenation was conducted using an H-Cube™ (ThalesNano Inc.) flow reactor at 1 mL/mim flow rate over 10% Pd/C catalyst heated to 60 °C under full hydrogen mode. Concentration under reduced pressure provided the desired 4-(amme-substiuted)cyclohexanamine product as oils. Solid hydrochloride salts could be obtained by stirring with ethereal HC1.<br>
Where it was required to selectively deprotect the benzylcarbamates in the presence of an TV-benzyl group (intermediates 16 &amp; 18), step 3 was employed instead of step 2.<br>
Step 3:<br>
Sodium iodide (1.5 mmol, 4eq) was dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile (5 mL) and was stirred whilst chlorotrimethylsilane (1.5 mmol, 4 eq) was added. After 5 minutes this mixture was added slowly to a solution of the 4-(amine-substitated)cyclohexanamine dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile (2 mL) cooled in an ice-water bath. After 1 hour the cooling bath was removed and the RM was stirred at ambient temperature for 18 hours. RM was concentrated under reduced pressure and redissolved in 1% water in methanol solution. The mixture was absorbed onto an SCX II column, washed with methanol and eluted with ammonia in methanol. Concentrated in. vacuo to provide the desired 4-(amine-substituted)cyclohexanamine.<br>

EXAMPLE 3<br>
A full-length human CDC25C clone was isolated by PCR from HeLa mRNA and was inserted on a BamHI-Hindin fragment into pRsetA. The amino terminal fragment of CDC25C (encoding residues 1-300) was excised from this vector and inserted into pET28a (between the Ncol and BamHI sites). Expression was under the control of the 17 promoter, and the encoded protein contained a HiS6 tag at the carboxyl terminus. The vector was transformed into E. coli strain BRL(DE3) pLysS for expression experiments. CDC25C was expressed in BL21(DE3) RIL bacteria cells, grown in LB media at 37 °C until OD600nm of 0.6 was reached. The expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG and the bacterial culture was grown further for 3 h. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugarion and the cell pellet was re-suspended in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 and 10 % sucrose, flash frozen, and stored at —70 °C until used. CDC25C protein was purified from E. coli inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were isolated in a buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 % triton X-100). After denaturation in the presence of 6 M urea, the protein was refolded via slow dialysis of the urea. The protein was stored in 25 mM Tris pH 8.0,100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA and 10 % glycerol at -70 °C until used.<br>
A full-length human PLK1 (XM_047240) (amino acids 1-603) clone was amplified from a foetal lung cDNA library using primers incorporating restriction enzyme sites. The 5' primer (gccgctagcgacgatgacgataagatgagtgctgcagtgactgcagggaagc) had an Nhel site prior to the ATG start codon. The 3' primer (ggaattcttaggaggccttgagacgg) incorporated a stop codon prior to the EcoRl site. The PCR product was cloned into the Nhel/EcoRl sites of a baculovirus expression vector, pSSPl. Cloning into this vector resulted in a HLs6 tag fusion at the amino terminus of the PLK1 construct Sf9 cells of a passage number less than 20 were sptit back to give a 300 mL culture volume, at a cell density of 1.5 x 106 cells/mL. Cells were only used for expression in logarithmic growth phase. PLK1 baculovirus (from P2 amplification) was added to give a multiplicity of infection of 3, this is equivalent to 3 virus particles for each insect cell. The flasks were incubated at 27 °C, with shaking at 100 r.p.m. for 48 h. On harvest, cell density and viability was determined, the cultures spun down at 2500 r.p.m. for 5 min<br>
and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The wash was re-spun at the same speed and the pellet was snap frozen. PLK1 protein was purified on a metal affinity column. The insect cell pellet was lysed in a buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM p-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM benzamidine, 20 mM imidazole and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and the pre-cleared supernatant was loaded onto NiNTA-agarose (Qiagen). The affinity column was washed with the lysis buffer and the bound protein was eluted with 250 mM imidazole in the same buffer. After overnight dialysis against 25 mM Tris HC1, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM benzamidine, protease inhibitors cocktail (Sigma) and 10 % glycerol, the purified protein was stored at -70 °C until used.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
PLK1 protein kinase assays were carried out using a 96-well plate format by incubating CDC25C (2 ug/well) with PLK1 (1 ug/well) in 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer pH 7.5, supplemented with 25 mM p-glycerophosphate, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM NaVC&gt;3. Serial dilutions of test compound in assay buffer were added. Reaction was initiated by the addition of 100 uM ATP and 0.5 uCi of [y-32P]-ATP. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, then stopped with 75 mM aq orthophosphoric acid, transferred onto a 96-well P81 filter plate (Whatman), dried, and the extent of CDC25C phosphorylation was assessed by scintillation counting using a Packard TopCount plate reader. The raw assay data was analysed by non-linear regression analysis parameters and IC50 values were determined using the equation: y = A + ((B-A)/(l+((C/x)AD))), where y is % inhibition, A is minimum inhibition, B is maximum inhibition, C is EC50, and D is the slope factor.<br>
Cellular proliferation assays using human tumour cell lines (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, 10801 University Boulevard, Manessas, VA 20110-2209, USA) were carried out. Standard 72-h MTT (thiazolyl blue; 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays were performed (Loveland et a], Biochem. Int., 1992, 27, 501; Haselsberger et al, Anti Cancer Drugs, 1996, 7, 331). Ih short: cells were seeded into 96-well plates according to doubling time<br>
and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Test compounds were made up in DMSO and a 1/3 dilution series prepared in 100 µL cell media, added to cells (in triplicates) and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C. MTT was made up as a stock of 5 mg/mL in cell media and filter-sterilised. Media was removed from ceils followed by a wash with 200 uL PBS. MTT solution was then added at 20 µL per well and incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 4 h. MTT solution was removed and cells again washed with 200 uL PBS. MTT dye was solubilised with 200 uL per well of DMSO with agitation. Absorbance was read at 540 nm and data analysed using curve-fitting software (GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA) to determine IC50 values (concentration of test compound which inhibits cell growth by 50%).<br>
EXAMPLE 5 PLK Selectivity<br>
Table 4 shows the selectivity of compound [218] for PLK1 over PLK2 and PLK3 compared with selected compounds of the prior art By way of illustration, compound [218] of the invention is twice as selective for PLK1 versus PLK 2 compared to compound [1-64] of WO 07/095188, ca 6-fold more selective than compound [1-76] and 7-fold more selective than compound [1-4] of WO 07/095188. Similarly, compound [218] is 5-fold more selective for PLK1 versus PLK3 compared to compound [1-64] of WO 07/095188, ca 12-fold more selective than compound [1-76] and 5-fold more selective than compound p-4] of WO 07/095188.<br>

Solubility Studies<br>
Table 5 shows that compound [254] (boxed structure below) has superior solubility<br>

Nephelometry Studies<br>
If a DMSO solution of a water soluble compound is introduced into aqueous buffer, the mixture remains clear unless the aqueous solubility limit is reached. Above the solubility limit, precipitation occurs and light travelling through the turbid suspension is scattered. The measurement of the intensity of the scattered light is the basis of nephelometric solubility determination.<br>
Selected compounds were screened using a nephelometer to identify the concentration at which turbidity occurs, thereby giving an indication of kinetic solubility. By nephelometry (2% DMSO : 98% phosphate buffered saline pH 7.5) compound [254] was freely soluble at 200 uM (&gt;0.11 mg/mL) which is the highest concentration tested in this assay. In contrast, in the same nephelometry assay, the maximum soluble concentration of prior art Example [1-253] of WO 07/095188 was determined to be 75 uM (Table 6). This shows that compound [254] is more soluble in aqueous buffer in the concentration range used to study compound activity in vitro.<br>
Pharmacokinetic Studies<br>
In order to study compounds in vivo, higher concentrations are often required. To<br>
achieve these higher concentrations, salt forms of compounds are normally utilised.<br>
Compound [254] and Example [1-76] of WO 07/095188 were studied as the free base and hydrochloride salts in various pharmaceutically relevant solvent mixtures that can be used for administration of compounds to living organisms. Having solubilized the compound by heating in the solvent, the solutions were cooled to 25 °C and observed.<br>
Rather than forming a precipitate, supersaturated mixtures tend to form a gelatinous mesophase after cooling that is not suitable or convenient for dosing. It is clear from the data presented in Table 5 that compound [254] and its HC1 salt have consistently better solution profiles than Example [1-76] and its corresponding HC1 salt<br>
The HC1 salt of Example [1-76] was administered to mice as a solution in 3% DMA 97% water by intravenous injection. The maximum tolerated dose appears to be dictated by reaching the maximum concentration of compound in stable solution. At the maximum tolerated dose no xenograft antitumour efficacy was observed (qd x 7 dosing) as insufficient compound concentration could be administered. In contrast, compound [254] and its salt, having significantly higher water solubility is able to be injected at concentrations more likely to produce efficacy in the treatment of diseases.<br>

Pharmacokinetic Properties of compound [3711<br>
(a) Methodology<br>
Preliminary investigations of the pharmacokinetics of selected compounds were carried out in fasted conscious CD-I mice (25-30 g). Compounds were dosed as 1 mg/kg by intravenous administration or 5-10 mg/kg by oral route. Twenty one male mice per administration route (n=3 mice per time point) received dose solution by single bolus injection in the tail vein or by oral gavage. Blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture at 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 and 360 min following iv administration and at 30, 60, 120, 240, 360, 480 and 1440 min following oral adrninistration. Blood samples were collected into tubes containing the anti-coagulant lithium heparin, mixed and placed promptly on crushed ice. Plasma was derived from whole blood by centrifugation, frozen and stored at -80 °C prior to analysis. Plasma concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in electrospray positive mode (ESI LC/MS/MS) using calibration curves prepared in the appropriate matrix. The lower level of quantification (LLOQ) in all cases was ca. 5 ng/mL. Plasma   concentration-time   data   was   processed   using   the   computer   program<br>
WinNonLin version 5.2 from which areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUCall) were calculated by non-compartmental analysis using Model 201 (IV-bolus Input) or Model 200 (Extravascular Input).<br>
(b) Comparison of compounds [371] and [378] with selected prior art compounds Further pharmacokinetic studies were carried to compare compounds [371] and [378] with a series of related analogues (see Table 7; compound [371] corresponds to compound H; compound [378] corresponds to compound I).<br>
Figure 1 plots the area under the curve (AUC) for plasma concentration vs time for each compound tested. The dosing vehicle across these experiments remained constant (intravenous = citrate buffer pH 3, 1 mL/kg; oral = DMA/PEG400/10mM Tartrate buffer, pH 4 (1:3:6), 5 ml/kg). Figure 2 represents the same data in the form of oral bioavailability (%F) for each compound.<br>
The results indicate that compounds H and I exhibit markedly superior systemic exposure and oral bioavailability compared to compounds A-G.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
fa) Cellular Efflux Data<br>
In vitro cell viability assays have been used to measure the effect of drug accumulation<br>
in paired parental and drug resistant tumour cell lines.   The pairs used are the human<br>
ovarian carcinoma A2780 line with its MDR counterpart A2780/ADR and the human<br>
uterine sarcoma MES-SA line with its MDR counterpart MES-SA/Dx5 [Wesolowska<br>
O., et al. (2005) Anticancer Res., 25, 383-389].<br>
Method: Cultivated human rumour ceils of the ovarian cell line A2780 and its doxorubicin-resistant pair, A2780/ADR and the uterine cell line MES-SA and its doxorubicin-resistant pair, MES-SA/DX5 were seeded at 3000 cells per well in Nunc 96-well tissue culture plates, 100µl per well in DMEM media containing 10% foetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin.   The wells of the first column in each plate<br>
 <br>
were filled with 100µl DMEM media instead of cells to provide a blank control for the Alamar Blue. The cells were incubated overnight at 37°C and 5% CO2. The compounds of interest, dissolved in DMSO, were added on to the cells at various concentrations. Dilutions of the compounds were first prepared in DMEM at twice the final desired concentration and 100µl of the dilutions added on to the cells. Each set of compounds were tested in triplicate in each cell line. After 72 hours incubation, 20µl Alamar Blue reagent (AbD Serotec) were added to each well and incubated for 3 hours. The plates were then read at 544/595nm.<br>
The amount of Alamar Blue reagent reacted represents the metabolic activity of the cells. The relative cell activity was calculated as a percentage of the control (cells without compound) and the active compound concentration which inhibited die cell activity by 50% (IC50) was derived. The values were calculated from the average of three individual measurements with blank correction (medium-only control).<br>
The assay was performed on the Biomek FxP, automation platform from Beckman Coulter. The plates were read on the Paradigm plate reader supplied by Beckman Coulter. Asymmetry ratios were calculated as the IC50 value of the compound in the drug resistant cells divided by the IC50 value in the parental cells. Figure 3 shows a comparison of selected compounds versus prior art compounds A'-T (defined in Table 8) in parental and MDR tumor cells. Asymmetry ratios are presented relative to compound [378].<br>
fb) Inhibition of PLK1<br>
In addition, compounds of this invention which exhibit low MDR/parental cell asymmetry in cell viability assays are also more effective at inhibiting PLK1 within MDR tumour cells than compounds of the prior art. Thus, they have greater potential as therapeutic PLK inhibitors. The intermediate filament protein vimentin is a cellular target of PLK1 phosphorylation. Inhibition of PLK1 is associated with a decrease in phospho-vimentin. This has been measured in the A2780 - A2780/ADR cell line pair.<br>
Method: A2780 cells and A2780/ADR cells were plated in separate 96-well plates (Perkin Elmer) at a density of 20 000 cells/well and incubated overnight at 37°C and 5% CO2. Test compounds were added to cells at a range of concentrations, with triplicate wells for each concentration (top concentration of DMSO on cells was 0.1%). After 7hrs incubation, the cells were fixed in ice-cold 3.7% formaldehyde for 10mins. The cells were washed in PBS, then permeabilised in cold methanol for 10mins. The cells were washed again in PBS then incubated with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5mins. Cells were washed once with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) then incubated for 3hrs with antibodies to phospho-histone H3-Serl0 (1:4000; Millipore) and phospho-vimentin-Ser82 (1:1000; MBL), in 1% bovine serum albumin. Antibodies were detected with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexafluor 488 (Invitrogen) and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexafluor 546 (Invitrogen), in 1% bovine serum albumin with 300nM DAPI (Cambridge Biosciences). Plates were scanned on a Cellomics Arrayscan II HCS Reader (Cellomics) using a 10X objective. The Cell Health Profiling V2 Bioapplication (Cellomics) was used to acquire and analyse the images. Phospho-vimentin staining, at intensities above a user-defined threshold, was measured in mitotic cells only (defined by the presence of phospho-histone H3) and the average staining intensity per mitotic cell for each well was reported. IC50 values were derived using average values from three replicate wells. Asymmetry ratios were calculated as the IC50 value of the compound in the drug resistant A2780/ADR cells divided by the IC50 value in the parental A2780 cells. Figure 3 shows a comparison of selected compounds versus prior art compounds A'-J' (defined in Table 8) in parental and MDR tumor cells. As before, asymmetry ratios are presented relative to compound [378].<br>
