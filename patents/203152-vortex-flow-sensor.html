COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10)<br>
VORTEX FLOW SENSOR<br>
ENDRESS+HAUSER FLOWTEC AG of  KAGENSTRASSE  7,  CH-4153 REINACH, SWITZERLAND a SWISS Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the<br>
nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be<br>
performed : -	<br><br>
Vortex Flow Sensor<br>
5	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to vortex flow sensors for measuring the flow velocity or the volumetric flow rate of a fluid flowing through a measuring tube, comprising a bluff body 10   mounted along a diameter of the measuring tube and serving to generate Karmdn vortices.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
15   During the operation of such a vortex flow sensor, a Karman vortex street is formed downstream of the bluff body. Its pressure fluctuations are converted by a vortex sensing element into an electric signal whose frequency is propor¬tional to the volumetric flow rate.<br>
20<br>
EP-A 841 545, corresponding to U.S. Patent Application SN 08/953,229, filed October 17, 1997, discloses a vortex flow sensor for measuring the flow velocity and/or the volumetric flow rate of a fluid flowing through a measuring 25   tube, comprising:<br>
- a bluff body serving to generate Kdrman vortices which is disposed along a diameter of the measuring tube and con¬nected with the measuring tube at at least one fixing point; and 30   - a capacitive vortex sensing element responsive to vortex-induced pressure fluctuations which is inserted in a wall bore of the measuring tube downstream of the bluff body, sealing off the bore toward the external surface of the<br><br>
measuring tube, with the center of the bore and the center of the fixing point lying on a straight surface line of the measuring tube, and which comprises:<br>
—	a diaphragm covering the bore and having a first surface<br>
5      facing toward the fluid and a second surface remote<br>
from the fluid;<br>
—	a rigid, thin sensor vane which is attached to the first<br>
surface, is shorter than the diameter of the measuring<br>
tube, and has flat major surfaces which are in<br>
10      alignment with the straight surface line of the measuring tube; and<br>
—	an electrode arrangement attached to the second surface.<br>
EP-A 841 545 further discloses a vortex flow sensor for 15   measuring the flow velocity and/or the volumetric flow rate of a fluid flowing through a measuring tube, comprising:<br>
—	a bluff body serving to generate Karmdn vortices which is<br>
disposed along a diameter of the measuring tube, is con¬<br>
nected with the measuring tube at at least one fixing<br>
20     point, and has a main bore, extending in the direction of said diameter and through the measuring tube, and at least one secondary bore, which connects the main bore with the fluid; and<br>
—	a capacitive vortex sensing element responsive to vortex-<br>
25     induced pressure fluctuations and inserted in the main<br>
bore, sealing off the external surface of the measuring tube from the fluid, said capacitive vortex sensing element comprising:<br>
—	a diaphragm covering the measuring-tube-side end of the<br>
30      main bore and having a first surface facing toward the<br>
fluid and a second surface remote from the fluid;<br>
—	a rigid sensor vane attached to the first surface; and<br>
—	an electrode arrangement attached to the second surface.<br><br>
As the two vortex flow sensors disclosed in EP-A 841 545 show, the vortex sensing element can be disposed either in the bluff body or in the bore in the wall of the measuring tube. Although such vortex flow sensors have proved to be 5   effective in practice, it is desirable to use piezoelectric sensing elements instead of capacitive sensing elements. The use of piezoelectric elements in vortex flow sensors is in the prior art.<br>

—	a bluff body serving to generate KSrmdn vortices which is<br>
15     disposed along a diameter of the measuring tube and is<br>
permanently connected with the measuring tube at two fix¬ing points; and<br>
—	a vortex sensing element in the form of at least one<br>
piezoelectric element responsive to vortex-induced mech-<br>
20     anical stresses in the bluff body, said vortex sensing element being disposed<br>
—	either in a recess of the bluff body provided in the<br>
area of one of the fixing points<br>
—	or in a recess provided in a prolongation of the bluff<br>
25      body extending toward the outside of the measuring<br>
tube, with<br>
—	either two individual piezoelectric elements being<br>
provided each having one electrode on two opposite<br>
surfaces<br>
30   — or a single piezoelectric element being provided having two electrically separated electrodes on a first sur¬face and a common electrode on an opposite second sur¬face.<br><br>
Furthermore, JP-A 58 - 160 813 discloses a vortex flow sensor for measuring the flow velocity and/or the volumetric flow rate of a fluid flowing through a measuring tube, comprising:<br>

10     mechanical stresses in the bluff body, said vortex<br>
sensing element being disposed<br>
—	either in a recess of the bluff body provided in the<br>
area of the fixing point toward the outside of the<br>
measuring tube, with<br>
15 — either two individual piezoelectric elements being provided each having one electrode on two opposite surfaces<br>
—	or a single piezoelectric element being provided having<br>
two electrically separated electrodes on a first sur-<br>
20      face and a common electrode on an opposite second sur¬face.<br>

-	a bluff body serving to generate Karman vortices which is<br>
disposed along a diameter of the measuring tube and is<br>
permanently connected with the measuring tube at two<br>
fixing points; and<br>
30   - a vortex sensing element responsive to vortex-induced<br>
pressure fluctuations and consisting of two piezoelectric elements which<br><br>
—	are disposed on a surface of a diaphragm of the bluff<br>

-	a bluff body serving to generate Karma n vortices which<br>
10     is disposed along a diameter of the measuring tube and is<br>
permanently connected with the measuring tube at two fixing points; and<br>
-	a vortex sensing element responsive to vortex-induced<br>
pressure fluctuations which<br>
15   — extends downstream of and near and parallel to the bluff body and is permanently connected with the measuring tube at two opposite fixing points, and<br>
—	is provided on a cylindrical prolongation extending<br>
toward the outside of the measuring tube, said cylin-<br>
20      drical prolongation supporting a concentric piezo¬electric element.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The perspective, general views of Figs. 1 and 2 show a 20   cutaway vortex flow sensor 1 with a piezoelectric vortex<br>
sensing element 3 fixed in and to a wall 21 of a measuring tube 2, as seen in the direction of flow and in the direction opposite flow, respectively.<br>
25   In Figs. 1 and 2, a rigid, thin sensor vane 31, extending through a bore 22 in the wall 21 into the interior of the measuring tube 3 and having two flat major surfaces, and a housing cap 32 is all that can be seen of the vortex sens¬ing element 3; of the two major surfaces, only the major<br>
30   surface 311 is visible in Fig. 1.<br><br>
The housing cap 32 comprises a first portion 321, which is of rectangular section and is fixed, e.g. screwed, to an external surface 23 of the measuring tube 3. This is not shown in Figs. 1 to 6 in order to simplify the illustra-5   tion. For the fixing of the housing cap 32 and for the reception of .the vortex sensing element 3, the external surface 23 may be machined to form a flat surface 24 as is assumed in Figs. 3, 4, and 7 to 12.<br>
10   The portion 321 of the housing cap 32 merges into a cylind¬rical second portion 322, and the latter merges into a third portion 323, which receives a connector 324 (see Fig. 3). This construction and shape of the housing cap 32 is not mandatory; any other suitable shape may be chosen.<br>
15<br>
Disposed in the interior of the measuring tube 2 along a diameter thereof is a bluff body 4 which is permanently connected with the measuring tube 2, forming a first fixing point 41 and a second fixing point, which is not visible in 20   Figs. 1 and 2. It is also possible to dispense with one of the fixing points. The center of the bore 22 and the center of the fixing point 41 lie on a straight surface line of the measuring tube.<br>
25   The bluff body 4 has a head surface 42, against which a fluid to be measured, e.g. a liquid, a gas, or a vapor, flows in operation, and two side surfaces, of which only one, the front surface 43, can be seen in Figs. 1 and 2. The head surface 42 and the side surfaces form two separa-<br>
30   tion edges, of which only one, the front separation edge 44, is completely visible in Fig. 1, while the other, the rear separation edge 45, is merely indicated. The separa¬tion edges 44, 45 are generally rounded in order to achieve good vortex shedding.<br><br>
In Fig. 2 it is indicated by broken lines that, according to the second variant of the invention, instead of pro¬viding the sensor vane 31 of Fig. 1, a main bore 46 may be formed in the bluff body 4 parallel to the separation edges 5   44, 45, this bore also extending through the wall of the measuring,tube 2. Preferably at the lower end of the main bore 46, a secondary bore 47 is provided which connects the main bore 46 with the fluid. A sensor sleeve 31' extends into the main bore 46, see Figs. 4, 8, 10, and 12. 10<br>
As the fluid flows against the head surface 42, a Kdrman vortex street is formed downstream of the bluff body 4 due to the fact that vortices are shed alternately at the sep¬aration edges 44, 45 and are carried along by the moving 15   fluid.<br>
These vortices generate local pressure fluctuations in the fluid, which are converted by the vortex sensing element 3 into electric signals. The vortex shedding frequency is a 20   measure of the volumetric flow rate and/or the flow velocity of the fluid.<br>
The shape and cross section of the bluff body 4 of Figs. 1 and 2 are essentially those of a right triangular prism, 25   i.e., a prism of triangular section. However, other conven¬tional shapes of the bluff body can also be used in the in¬vention.<br>
Three embodiments of the piezoelectric vortex sensing 30   element 3 of Figs. 1 and 2 for the first variant of the<br>
invention are shown in vertical sections in Figs. 3, 7, 9, and 11.<br><br>
Three embodiments for the second variant of the invention are shown in vertical sections in Figs. 4, 8, 10, and 12. In Figs. 3, 4, and 7 to 12, the housing cap 32 of Figs. 1 and 2 has been omitted.<br>
5<br>
In Figs. 3,'7, 9, 11, the piezoelectric vortex sensing element 3 comprises a diaphragm 33, 33", 33+ covering the bore 22 in the wall 21 of the measuring tube 2. In Figs. 4, 8, 10, 12, the piezoelectric vortex sensing element 3' 10   comprises a diaphragm 33', 33*, 33++ covering the main bore in the bluff body 4.<br>
These diaphragms have a first surface 331 facing toward the fluid and a second surface 332 remote from the fluid, cf. 15   Fig. 3. The respective diaphragm is fixed to one end of a retaining ring 333, which is higher than the diaphragm; preferably, the diaphragm and the retaining ring are of one-piece construction, as shown.<br>
20   The respective diaphragm is made of a suitable metal, such as high-grade steel, and closes the bore 22 or the main bore 46 in a fluid-tight manner, so that even at a maximum permissible fluid pressure, no fluid can leak to the exter¬nal surface 23 of the measuring tube 2. This is accomp-<br>
25   lished, for example, by interposing a sealing ring 5 bet¬ween a flat supporting surface 25, formed in the wall 21 from outside, for example by milling, and the retaining ring 333.<br>
30   The sensor vane 31, which is shorter than the diameter of the measuring tube 2, is fixed to the first surface 331 of the diaphragm 33. The flat major surfaces 311, 312 are in alignment with a straight surface line of the measuring<br><br>
tube 2 and may form a small wedge, as can be seen in Figs. 1 to 3, 7, 9, and 11.<br>
Attached to the second surface 332 of the diaphragm 33 is a 5   piezoelectric element 34, which is shown in Figs. 5 in a<br>
vertical section. A surface of the piezoelectric element 34 facing toward the diaphragm is provided with a base elec¬trode 343, and a surface remote from the diaphragm is pro¬vided with a first electrode 341 and a second electrode 10   342, which are symmetrical with respect to a median plane of the sensor vane 31. This median plane is indicated in Fig. 3 as a broken line and is perpendicular to the plane of the paper.<br>
15   In Fig. 3, a contact-making body 34 with a first surface<br>
351 facing toward the piezoelectric element 34 and a second surface 352 remote from the piezoelectric element is dis¬posed on a surface of the piezoelectric element remote from the diaphragm, cf. Figs. 6a to 6c, which show further de-<br>
20   tails.<br>
The contact-making body 35 is made of a suitable insulating material, such as ceramic, and has on the first surface 351 a first contact area 353, which contacts the first elec-<br>
25   trode 341 of the piezoelectric element 34, and a second<br>
contact area 354, which contacts the second electrode 342. Very good contact is made if the electrodes 341 and 342 are egual in area to the contact areas 352 and 354, respect¬ively, and completely cover the latter in the assembled<br>
30   condition.<br>
On the second surface 352, the contact-making body 35 has a third contact area 355 and a fourth contact area 356 (see Figs. 6a to 6c), which are electrically connected to the<br><br>
first contact area 353 and the second contact area 354, respectively.<br>
In Fig. 6b it can be seen that this is accomplished by 5   means of conductors 357 and 358, respectively, passing<br>
through the contact-making body 35 from the first surface 351 to the second surface 352. These conductors may also project beyond the surface 352, so that leads can be at¬tached, e.g., soldered, to their projecting ends.<br>
10<br>
This type of through-connection using conductors is not mandatory; it is also possible, for example, to provide a conductive track extending around the edge of the contact-making body 35 in a respective groove.<br>
15<br>
In Fig. 3, an intermediate ring 6 supported on the retain¬ing ring 333 of the diaphragm 33 forces the diaphragm against the measuring tube 2, the intermediate ring 6 being screwed to the measuring tube. Of several screws used for 20   this purpose, one screw 61 can be seen in Fig. 3. The<br>
intermediate ring 6 has an inside diameter approximately equal to the free diameter of the diaphragm 33.<br>
Disposed on the contact-making body 35 is a thrust ring 7 25   with a diameter approximately equal to the free diameter of the diaphragm 33, and thus equal to the inside diameter of the intermediate ring.<br>
The thrust ring 7 supports a clamping plate 8, which is 30   screwed to the intermediate ring 6. Of several screws used for this purpose, one screw 81 can be seen in Fig.3. The clamping plate 8 forces the thrust ring 7 against the con¬tact-making body 35, the latter against the piezoelectric element 34, and the latter against the diaphragm 33.<br><br>
Thus, in the assembled condition of the vortex sensing element 3, a constant mechanical force acts on the piezoelectric element 34, this constant force determining the measurement zero. The electrical bias produced by this 5   mechanical load is reduced by the fact that the piezo¬electric element is connected at the input end to a dif¬ferential amplifier included in evaluation electronics, which are not shown and do not form part of the invention. Via the finite input resistance of the differential arap-10   lifier, the bias is reduced and made zero, so that it does not enter into the measurements.<br>
Therefore, the vortex-induced pressure fluctuations can be measured without this measurement being affected by the 15   process pressure and/or by thermally induced mechanical stresses. "Process pressure" as used herein means the pressure in the fluid, which is substantially constant.<br>
In Fig. 3, two leads 359 and 360 can be seen which connect 20   the third and fourth contact areas 355 and 356, respect¬ively, of the contact-making body 35 to the connector 324. The latter is fitted in the third portion 323 of the hous¬ing cap 32 in a tight manner and serves to feed the meas¬urement signals provided by the piezoelectric element 34 to 25   the aforementioned evaluation electronics.<br>
In operation, the above-explained pressure fluctuations cause deflections of the sensor vane 31 in a direction per¬pendicular to its major surfaces 311, 312. These deflec-30   tions are transmitted by the diaphragm 33 to the piezo¬electric element 34.<br><br>
Fig. 4 shows a vertical section of a first embodiment of a vortex sensing element 3' in accordance with the second variant of the invention. It differs from Fig. 3 only in that instead of the sensor vane 31 of Fig. 3, a rigid 5   sensor sleeve 31'. is attached to the first surface of the diaphragm 33'.<br>
The sensor sleeve 31' is inserted in the above-mentioned main bore 46 of the bluff body 4 if the vortex sensing 10   element is not located downstream of the bluff body as in Figs. 1 to 3. In the main bore 46, the vortex sensing element 3' is moved by the vortex-induced pressure fluct¬uations and deflects the diaphragm 33'.<br>
Figs. 7 and 8 show vertical sections of developments of the vortex sensing elements of Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. A piezoelectric element 34' and a contact-making body 35' corresponding to the piezoelectric element 34 and the con-20   tact-making body 35 of Figs. 3 to 6 are annular in shape and have central holes 344 and 361, respectively.<br>
On the surface of the diaphragm 33' remote from the fluid, a compensating body 334 (in Fig. 7) or 334' (in Fig. 8) is<br>
25   provided which extends into the central holes 344, 361;<br>
preferably, the diaphragm, the retaining ring, and the com¬pensating body are made as one piece, as shown.The areal moment of inertia of the sensor vane 31 or the sensor slee¬ve 31' at the surface of the diaphragm 33 or 33' facing<br>
30   toward the fluid is made approximately equal to the areal moment of inertia of the compensating body 334 or 334' at the surface of the diaphragm 33 or 33' remote from the fluid.<br><br>
Through this dimensioning choice, the mass of the compen¬sating body 334 or 334' is approximately equal to that of the sensor vane 31 (Fig. 7) or the sensor sleeve 31' (Fig. 8), respectively, i.e., slightly less than, exactly equal 5   to, or slightly greater than this mass.<br>
*<br>
By means of the compensating body 334, 334', disturbing effects that accelerations acting on the measuring tube 2 from outside, for example in the form of impacts or vibra-10   tions, may have on the piezoelectric element 34, 34' can be largely compensated for.<br>
The above-mentioned choice of the areal moments of inertia, and thus of the masses, results in the following behavior<br>
15   in the presence of vibrations acting from outside. Let us assume that in Fig. 7 the sensor vane and the compensating body 334 are accelerated to the right in the plane of the paper. Because of the larger mass of the sensor vane, the force acting on the latter is greater than the force acting<br>
20   on the compensating body 334.<br>
The diaphragm 33 transmits this greater force to the com¬pensating body 334 in the opposite direction; the resulting force acting on the compensating body 334 is thus directed 25   to the left, so that the compensating body will move to the left; thus, only a small deflection of the diaphragm 33 will result despite the vibration.<br>
30   Figs. 9 and 10 show schematic vertical sections of a second embodiment of the vortex sensing element 3" according to the first and second variants of the invention, respect¬ively. A first end of a flexible beam 36 is fixed at the center of the second surface of the diaphragm 3 3". The<br><br>
flexible beam 36, the diaphragm 33", and a sensor vane 31" are preferably made as a single piece.<br>
A second end of the flexible beam 36 is nonpermanently 5   fixed to a holder 37 rigidly connected with the wall of the measuring tube, in Figs. 9 and 10, the flexible beam 36 is bolted in place between two outwardly extending flanges 371, 372 of the holder 37.<br>
10   A first piezoelectric element 34" and a second piezoelec¬tric element 34* are bonded lengthwise to a first surface of the flexible beam 36 and a second surface opposite the first surface, respectively. In Fig. 10, instead of a sen¬sor vane 31" as in Fig. 9, a sensor sleeve 31* is provided<br>
15   as in Figs. 4 and 8.<br>
Figs. 11 and 12 show schematic vertical sections of a third embodiment of a vortex sensing element 3* in accordance with the first and second variants of the invention, res-20   pectively. A first end of a flexible beam 36' is nonperman¬ently fixed at the center of the second surface of a dia¬phragm 33*. In Figs. 11 and 12, this end of the flexible beam 36' is bolted in place between two flanges 371", 372" formed by the diaphragm 33*.<br>
25<br>
A second end of the flexible beam 36' is nonpermanently fixed to a holder 37' rigidly connected with the wall of the measuring tube. In Figs. 11 and 12, this second end is bolted in place between two outwardly extending flanges<br>
30   371', 372' of the holder 37'.<br>
A first piezoelectric element 34+ and a second piezoelec¬tric element 34++ are mechanically fixed lengthwise to a first surface of the flexible beam 36' and to a second sur-<br><br>
face opposite the first surface, respectively; preferably, the two piezoelectric elements 34+, 34++ are bolted in place between the flanges 371', 372' and the flanges 371", 372" together with the flexible beam 36'. In Fig. 12, in-5   stead of a sensor vane 31+ as in Fig. 11, a sensor sleeve 31++ is provided as in Figs. 4, 8, and 10.<br><br>
