				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to photochromic molding<br>
compositions and to articles produced therefrom, e.g.<br>
ophthalmic lenses, and also to processes for production<br>
of such articles. These are preferably bulk-colored<br>
molding compositions, but coloring in a dip-coating<br>
bath or by way of another method of introducing/doping<br>
the photochromic dye is likewise possible.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Photochromic molding compositions are starting.<br>
materials used for production of photochromic articles,<br>
e.g. sunglass lenses which undergo reversible tinting<br>
on exposure to light, or similar articles.<br>
Photochromic means that the dye is converted to an<br>
excited state via exposure to light (UV or short-wave<br>
VIS) , the unexcited, thermodynamically state and the<br>
excited state here having different absorption spectra<br>
(cf. definition of Photochromie [Photochromicity] in:<br>
R6mpp Lexikon Chemie [Rompp's Chemical Encyclopedia],<br>
10th edition, page 3303, Georg Thieme Verlag,<br>
Stuttgart) . The excited state generally has an intense<br>
color, whereas the initial form is colorless. The<br>
excited dye molecule returns to the unexcited state via.<br>
a thermal or radiation-induced reverse reaction.<br>
These dyes can be used to produce optical filters whose<br>
variability is light-induced, for example by<br>
introducing the dye into a plastics matrix (bulk<br><br>
coloring), or by applying a coating with dye onto glass<br>
or plastic, (cf., for example, J,F. Rabek in Mechanisms<br>
of Photophysical Processes and Photochemical Reactions<br>
in Polymers, chapter 10, pages 3 77 - 3 91, for incorporation of such dyes into polymeric matrices).<br>
An important application is provided by ophthalmic<br>
lenses, e.g. sunglass; lenses, which spontaneously<br>
darken when subject to insolation. A plurality of<br>
 photochromic dyes and/or one or more inert dyes<br>
together with the photochromic dye are used in order to<br>
give these lenses the desired shade of color. If an.<br>
inert dye is used, the lens, even in the non-irradiated<br>
state, has an underlying tint or a color, and this<br>
 reduces transmittance.<br>
A significant aspect of such applications is that the<br>
number of possible repeats of the reversible<br>
photochromic process has been maximized, and that the<br>
 dye is not irreversibly removed from this cycle by<br>
environmental effects (e.g. oxygen) or side reactions<br>
(e.g. with the polymer matrix or with additives). A<br>
further precondition is that the "switching process"<br>
(excitation) and/or the thermal reverse reaction<br>
 proceed(s) to practical completion within an acceptable<br>
period, rf this is not the case, tinting of the lens<br>
does not occur on exposure to light (no reduction in<br>
transmittance) , and/or the lens retains its tint for a<br>
long time after exposure to light. Both are undesired.<br><br>
Marketing of the first photpchromic plastic lenses<br>
began as early as 1980. However, numerous improvements<br>
in the dyes and in the polymeric matrices had to be<br>
achieved before the photochromic system achieved<br>
 adequate lifetime and satisfactory spectral<br>
performance. Initially, 'such plastics lenses were<br>
practically entirely based on cast systems, e.g. allyl<br>
diglycol carbonate CR39, which is obtainable via<br><br>
polymerization of bisallyl carbonates. Later, lenses<br>
based on (meth) acrylates and on polycarbonates also<br>
became available, and recently an increasing number of<br>
lenses is produced thermoplastically, the materials<br>
often used here being thermoplastic polyurethanes<br>
(TPU).<br>
Some disclosures from the patent literature in the<br>
general context of photochromically doped plastics will<br>
be described below. There are intentionally no details<br>
given of the wide variety of descriptions of systems<br>
such as CR39 which are processed in a casting process<br>
with crosslinking to give lenses, since the present<br>
invention does not encompass such systems.<br>
JP-A-63 02783 7 describes a photochromic system in which<br>
a PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastics matrix with<br>
which a plasticizer has been admixed (from 2 to 15% by<br>
weight) is doped with a photochromic dye. The intention<br>
of this selection of the matrix is that the long-term<br>
stability of such a layer be improved, under constant<br>
exposure to light and heat, and this layer can, for<br>
example, be applied to a nylon film.<br>
JP-A-01180536 likewise describes a photochromic<br>
material intended to be heat-resistant and weather-<br>
resistant. It is composed of a plastics matrix composed<br>
of a transparent plastic and of an additive which is a<br>
polymer having a defined proportion of monomers having hydroxyl groups, e.g. PVB (polyvinyl butyral) or<br>
polyvinyl acetate. A wide variety of possible systems<br>
is stated as transparent plastic, examples being PMMA,<br>
PC, transparent nylon, etc.<br>
JP-A-01024740 is like the two abovementioned<br>
specifications from the tinted vehicle windshields<br>
sector in describing a multilayer structure composed of<br>
two glass layers with an intermediate layer which<br><br>
comprises a photochromic material. A plurality of<br>
possibilities is stated as transparent material of this<br>
intermediate layer, inter alia vinyl resin, acrylic<br>
resin, polyester resin, and polyamide resin,<br>
Spirooxazines inter alia are mentioned as dyes, and a<br>
specific distribution of the dye is emphasized as<br>
advantageous.<br>
WO 01/49478 describes a photochromic lens which is<br>
composed of a PC substrate and of a photochromically<br>
doped coating composed of thermoplastic polyurethane<br>
(TPU) . This coating is applied to a PC preform in an.<br>
in-mold-coating process.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is therefore based inter alia on the<br>
object of providing a photochromic material improved in<br>
comparison with the materials of the prior art. A<br>
particular object is improvement of such materials<br>
based on polyamides.<br>
This object is achieved in particular by providing a<br>
photochromic polyamide molding composition which<br>
comprises a proportion by weight of from 50 to 99% by<br>
weight of at least one transparent homopolyamide and/or<br>
copolyamide, a proportion by weight of from 1 to 50% by<br>
weight of at least one further polymer whose glass<br>
transition temperature is below 80Â°C, and also a<br>
proportion by weight of from 0.001 to 2.0% by weight of<br>
at least one photochromic . dye. This material	can.<br>
optionally comprise, inter alia, further dyes and/or<br>
additives. It is not necessary that photochromic dye<br>
has been previously admixed with this material, and it<br>
is also possible to use the mixture composed of<br>
polyamide and of other polymer with the properties,<br>
mentioned in relation to glass transition temperature<br>
as initial charge and to introduce the dye into the<br><br>
article, e.g. in a dip-coating bath, after or during<br>
production of an article (e.g. production of a lens in<br>
an injection-molding process).<br>
The further polymer preferably has at least one<br>
amorphous phase whose glass transition temperature is<br>
at most 80Â°C. If the further polymer is a block polymer<br>
having a soft segment, the glass transition temperature<br>
of the soft segment should be below 4 0Â°C, preferably<br>
below 25Â°C.<br>
The term used in this specification "transparent<br>
polyamides" is intended to mean polyamides or<br>
copolyamides or molding compositions formed therefrom,<br>
their light transmittance being at least 70% when the<br>
(co)polyamide (in pure form, i.e. without the further<br>
constituents stated above of the inventive molding<br>
composition) takes the form of a thin plaque (plate),<br>
thickness 2 mm. Light transmittance is measured here on<br>
a Perkin Elmer uv/vIs spectrometer in the range from<br>
200 to 80 0 run, using round plaques measuring 70 x 2 mm.<br>
The transmittance value is stated for the wavelength<br>
range from 500 to 700 nm. The round plagues measuring<br>
70 x 2 mm are produced for this purpose by way of<br>
example on an Arburg injection-molding machine in a<br>
polished mold, the cylinder temperature here being from.<br>
200 to 340Â°C and mold temperature from 20 to 140Â°C.<br>
Examples of transparent polyamides that can be used for<br>
these purposes are polyamides and/or copolyamides as<br>
described in DE-A-102 24 947, or DE-A-101. 22. 188,<br>
CH-A-688 624 or EP=A-0 725 TOO",	or a "mixture" thereof.<br>
In relation to transparent polyamides, the disclosure<br>
of these documents and the polyamide systems and<br>
copolyamide systems mentioned therein are expressly<br>
incorporated into this description.<br><br>
One of the advantages of the use of polyamides as main<br>
material is that, unlike materials such as CR39 or<br>
acrylate which have been used hitherto for production<br>
of ophthalmic lenses, these being materials which<br>
required traditional casting processes involving<br>
polymerization (crosslinking), transparent polyamides<br>
(amorphous or microcrystalline) can be processed in<br>
simple injection-molding processes with low cycle<br>
times, i.e. using low-cost mass production. The<br>
inventive polyamide molding composition is therefore<br>
also preferably not crosslinkable.<br>
It is preferable that the mixture is composed of a<br>
proportion by weight of from 70 to 99% by weight,<br>
particularly from 80 to 93% by weight, of the<br>
transparent homopolyamide and/or copolyamide and of a<br>
proportion by weight of from l to 3 0% by weight,<br>
particularly from 2 to 20% by weight, of at least one<br>
further polymer whose glass transition temperature is<br>
below SO or 40Â°C (i.e. without dye), and the mixture is<br>
at the same time likewise preferably in essence<br>
transparent in the above sense or no more than 10%, or<br>
preferably 5%, less transparent than in the above<br>
sense. For components whose optical specification is<br>
less demanding, or for components in which the<br>
photochromic processes are relevant only in reflection<br>
(for example decorative items), lower transparency and<br>
even slight haze are also possible. For components with<br>
a demanding optical specification, transmittance above<br>
70%, preferably above 80%., in the wavelength range from<br>
500 to 700 run (measured at a layer thickness of 2 mm) -is- preferred and/or haze less than 5 or even 3, and<br>
preferably less than 2 (ASTM 1003, layer thickness-<br>
2 mm) .<br>
Addition of polyamide-12 (also called polyamide-12), in<br>
particular of low-viscosity PA12 (solution viscosity or<br>
relative viscosity Î·rel - according to DIN EN ISO 307 in<br><br>
a 0.5 weight% solution in m-cresol at 20Â°C - from 1.5<br>
to 2, preferably from 1.6 to 1.9} can improve haze and<br>
photochromic effect.<br>
Addition of polyamide-12 and/or polyamide oligomer<br>
moreover makes it possible to process the photochromic<br>
polyamide molding composition under milder conditions<br>
and to incorporate the photochromic dye into the<br>
thermoplastic molding composition under milder<br>
conditions, and it is therefore possible to inhibit<br>
substantially any degradation of the unstable<br>
photochromic dye during the extrusion and/or injection-<br>
molding process. An example of a suitable polyamide<br>
oligomer is a polyamide-12 oligomer, preferably with<br>
average molar mass of from 1500 to 25 0 0 g/mol,,<br>
particularly preferably having mainly non-condensable<br>
alkyl end groups.<br>
Various measures can be used to avoid gate marks.<br>
Addition of 10% by weight or more of a low-viscosity<br>
polyamide-12 can be effective in inhibiting formation<br>
of gate marks. Gate marks can likewise be avoided if<br>
the ratio of the solution viscosities of the<br>
transparent polyamide and of the polymer component<br>
whose glass transition temperature is below 80Â°C is<br>
smaller than 1.2, in particular smaller than 1.1. Haze,<br>
too, is reduced as the ratio of the solution<br>
viscosities of the two polymer components falls, for<br>
identical chemical constitution. Addition of polyamide-<br>
12 oligomer makes processing easier overall, by virtue<br>
of lower melt viscosity and longer flow path.<br>
Although it has been possible for some years to prepare<br>
amorphous polyamides, too, in the purity required for<br>
optical applications, examples being polyamides of type<br>
MACM12 as described in DE-A-196 42 885, these being<br>
available from EMS CHEMIE, Switzerland, with trade name<br>
Grilamid TR 90, simple addition of a photochromic dye<br><br>
cannot give satisfactory photochromic results in the<br>
lenses produced from these pure systems.<br>
MACM here represents the compound whose ISO name is<br>
bis(4-amino-3-methylcyclohexyl)methane, which is<br>
commercially available as the C260 grade of Laromin<br>
(CAS No.. 6864-37-5) with trade name 3,3'-dimethyl-4,4'-<br>
diaminodicyclohexylmethane. The numeral 12 represents<br>
an aliphatic linear C12 dicarboxylic acid (DDA,<br>
dodecanedioc acid) , with which the diamine MACM has<br>
been polymerized.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that, contrary to<br>
previous experience to the effect that addition of<br>
photochromic dyes to transparent polyamides does not<br>
give satisfactory photochromic behavior, the inventive<br>
material gives, when processed to give photochromic<br>
articles, unexpectedly long-lived, i.e. frequently<br>
repeatable, reversible photochromic behavior.<br>
Furthermore, the preferred dyes are among the most<br>
stable photochromic systems. The switching process<br>
(excitation) moreover proceeds rapidly and the thermal<br>
reverse reaction likewise proceeds almost to completion<br>
within a reasonable period from seconds to at most a<br>
few minutes.<br>
Normally, only pure polyamide materials whose glass<br>
transition temperature is below. 100Â°C, i.e. not those<br>
present in the form of a mixture,, exhibit pronounced<br>
photochromic behavior, an example being MACM3 6 or<br>
PACM3 6, where PACM represents the compound whose ISO<br>
name is_his(4-aminGcyclGhexyl)methane, available as<br>
Dicykan grade (CAS Mo. 1761-71-3) with tradename<br>
4,4'-diaminodicyclohexylmethane.. However, the defective<br>
mechanical or thermal properties of these materials<br>
generally make them unsuitable by way of example for<br>
ophthalmic lens applications. Addition of a further<br>
polymer to a transparent (co)polyamide alongside the<br><br>
dye is possible. However, these polymers and the<br>
resultant mixture (blend) are subject to stringent<br>
requirements, particularly for ophthalmic lens<br>
applications, and admixture normally results in haze in<br>
the blend. However, optical properties (transmittance,<br>
haze, Abbe number) of the mixtures (blends) should not<br>
be substantially below the level of the pure<br>
polyamides. The photochroraic process should have good<br>
kinetics (darkening and fading within period from<br>
seconds to a few minutes, preferably within from 20 to<br>
60 seconds) and continue over a long lifetime. This is<br>
the case with the proposed materials and with the<br>
articles produced therefrom. As previously mentioned,<br>
these good properties of the bulk-colored articles also<br>
occur when the article is manufactured from the blend<br>
without dye and the dye is introduced after the initial<br>
molding of the article, e.g. in a dip-coating bath. The<br>
presence of the other polymer with low glass transition<br>
temperature alongside the transparent polyamide<br>
provides an environment for the photochromic dyes<br>
permitting the reversible changes of configuration<br>
and/or of conformation which mostly occur during<br>
excitation of the dyes and which are generally required<br>
for the color change.<br>
In one first preferred embodiment, the polyamide<br>
molding composition is one where the glass transition<br>
temperature of the further polymer is below 3 0Â°C,<br>
preferably below 25Â°C. This can give ideal<br>
photochromicity kinetics. Good values are obtained<br>
particularly when the glass transition temperature of<br>
the further polymer is below 0Â°C, preferably in the<br>
range from (-60) - (-20)Â°C.<br>
Another preferred embodiment with excellent kinetics is<br>
one wherein the further polymer is a polyamide based on<br>
cycloaliphatic diamines and aliphatic dicarboxylic<br>
acids having from 6 to 40 carbon atoms., particularly<br><br>
preferably having from 20 to 3 6 carbon atoms, the<br>
cycloaliphatic diamine preferably being MACM and/or<br>
PACM, and the entire polyamide particularly preferably<br>
being MACM3 6 and/or PACM3 6, and/or wherein the further<br>
polymer is a block copolymer having soft segments,<br>
where the glass transition temperature of the soft<br>
segments is preferably below 25Â°C. The further polymer<br>
can, for example, be a polyamide block copolymer having<br>
soft segments, preferably a polyamide-12 block<br>
copolymer, the soft segments here preferably being<br>
polyether soft segments and/or polyester soft segments<br>
and/or polysiloxane soft segments and/or polyolefin<br>
soft segments and/or polyacryiate soft segments.<br>
Preferred polyether segments are those based on the<br>
monomers ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide and/or<br>
tetrahydrofuran.<br>
Possible other further polymers are also polyester<br>
elastomers having soft segments and TPU elastomers<br>
having soft segments, both of these being as previously<br>
described at an earlier stage above in connection with<br>
polyamide block polymers. It is also possible to use<br>
other further polymers, as long as they meet the glass-<br>
transition temperature conditions stated above,<br>
examples being acrylate polymers, methacrylate polymers<br>
(particularly preferably having long pendent groups),<br>
polycarbonate copolymers, styxene copolymers<br>
(preferably based on acrylonitrile, butadiene,<br>
acrylate, methacrylate), polyolefins, particularly<br>
grafted, ethylene copolymers (based on propene, butene,<br>
pentene, hexene, octene, decene, undecene, butadiene,<br>
 styrene, acrylonitrile-, -isop-rene-, isobutylene, or being<br>
derivatives of (meth)acrylic acid, vinyl acetate,<br>
tetrafluoroethylene, vinylidene fluoride, hexafluoro-<br>
propene and 2-chlorobutadiene), polyisobueylene,<br>
polybutyl acrylate, and others.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the transparent <br><br>
horaopolyamide and/or copolyamide is a polyamide based<br>
on cycloaliphatic diamines and on aliphatic<br>
dicarboxylic acids having from 6 to 3 6 carbon atoms, or<br>
is a mixture of such homopolyamides and/or<br>
copolyamides. Excellent transparency values with good<br>
photochromicity are obtained by way of example when the<br>
cycloaliphatic diamines are MACM and/or PACM and/or<br>
when the aliphatic dicarboxylic acid is an aliphatic<br>
dicarboxylic acid having 10, 12, or 18 carbon atoms.<br>
For example, the transparent polyamide can be a<br>
homopolyamide selected from the group of MACM12 (e.g.<br>
Grilamid TR 90, cf. text further below), MACM18, and/or<br>
is a copolyamide selected from the group of<br>
MACM12/PACM12, MACM18/PACM18. It is preferable that the<br>
refractive index of such systems is greater than or<br>
equal to 1.50, the Abbe number being greater than or<br>
equal to 40 and the density being smaller than or equal<br>
to 1.1 g/cm3.<br>
Another advantageous possibility is that the<br>
transparent homopolyamide and/or copolyamide is a<br>
polyamide based on aromatic dicarboxyic acids having<br>
from 8 to 13 carbon atoms or is a mixture of such<br>
homopolyamides and/or copolyamides, preferably based on<br>
lactams and/or aminocarboxylic acids, where the<br>
aromatic dicarboxylic acids are by way of example TPA<br>
(terephthalic acid) and/or IPA (iscphthalic acid) . The<br>
transparent homopolyamide and/or copolyamide can<br>
advantageously be a polyamide selected from the group<br>
of: 6I6T, TMDT, 6I/MACMI/MACMT, 6I/6T/MACMI,<br>
MACMI/MACM3 6, 61, lactam-containing polyamides, such as<br>
 12/PACMX, 12/MAGMI, 1-2-MACMT;6-/PACMT, 6/6I-6/IPDT, or a<br>
mixture thereof. The polyamides are designated pursuant<br>
to ISO 1874-1. Each I here represents isophthalic acid<br>
and each T here represents terephthalic acid, TMD<br>
represents trimethylhexamethylenediamine, IPD<br>
represents isophoronediamine.<br><br>
It is advantageous and possible that the transparent<br>
homopolyamide and/or copolyamide is a polyamide based<br>
on at least one dicarboxylic acid and on at least one<br>
diamine having an aromatic ring, preferably based on<br>
MXD (meta-xylylenediamine), where the dicarboxylic acid<br>
can be aromatic and/or aliphatic, the material<br>
preferably being 6I/MXDI.<br>
It is preferable that the refractive index of such<br>
systems and generally of the transparent homopolyamide<br>
and/or copolyamide is greater than or equal to 1.59,<br>
the Abbe number being greater than or equal to 25 and<br>
the density being smaller than or equal to 1.3 g/cm3.<br>
It is preferable that the solution viscosity or<br>
relative viscosity Î·rel (according to DIN EN ISO 1528-1<br>
or DIN EN ISO 307) is from 1.3 to 2.0, in particular<br>
from 1.40 to 1.85. The glass transition temperature Tg<br>
of the transparent homopolyamide and/or copolyamide is<br>
moreover normally above 9 0Â°C, preferably above 1100C,<br>
particularly preferably above 13 0Â°C.<br>
Another preferred embodiment is one wherein the<br>
photochromic dye is a dye which is reversibly excitable<br>
with DV or short-wave VIS, preferably being a dye based<br>
on spirooxazines. Excitable means that it can be<br>
excited to a state in which its absorption spectrum<br>
alters in such a way that absorption of visible light<br>
takes place, when the dye has been embedded in the<br>
matrix composed of polymer, i.e. in the inventive blend<br>
composed of transparent polyamide and of other polymer<br>
with the glass transition temperature stated above. The<br>
achievable filter effect can be adjusted widely in the<br>
visible region of the spectrum via the selection of the<br>
photochromic dyes and adjustment of the concentration.<br>
It is therefore possible to achieve a completely<br>
reversible reduction to 40% or even 10% of the original<br>
transmittance (generally from 80 to 92%) {in each case<br>
measured on a plaque of thickness 1 or 2 mm with<br><br>
parallel sides).<br>
Other possible dyes which can be incorporated as<br>
photochromic systems are described by way of example in<br>
Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology vol. 6,<br>
"Chromogenic Materials, Photochromie", pages 587-605,<br>
John Wiley and Sons, Inc., or else in: Heins Durr,<br>
Henri Bouas-Laurent (eds.), Photochromism: Molecules<br>
and Systems, Elsevier 2003. These dyes are expressly<br>
incorporated into the present disclosure content for<br>
incorporating into the inventive blends, preference<br>
being given to the spirooxazines described in these<br>
publications. Other possible systems are particularly<br>
those described in DE-A-36 22 871, or described in<br>
WO 2005/030856, or described in EP-A-0 313 341. These<br>
dyes, too, are expressly incorporated herein by way of<br>
reference.<br>
The abovementioned additives optionally present can be<br>
inter alia stabilizers, such as UV stabilizers, heat-<br>
stabilizers, and free-radical scavengers, and/or can be processing aids, plasticizers, further polymers, or a<br>
combination or mixture thereof. The molding<br>
compositions can moreover include nano-scale fillers<br>
and/or nano-scale functional substances, examples being<br>
laminar minerals or metal oxides which increase the<br>
refractive index of ophthalmic lenses.<br>
The invention moreover provides an article free from<br>
haze with at least one region or layer composed of the<br>
polyamide molding composition stated above. It is<br>
preferable that this is a foil, an insert, a profile, a<br>
tube, a hollow body, or an optically variable filter or<br>
particularly preferably an optical lens, with<br>
particular preference an ophthalmic lens.<br>
The article, i.e. particularly the ophthalmic lens,<br>
preferably has a color gradient and/or has a<br><br>
photochromic coating, an antireflection coating,	a<br>
scratch-resistant coating, an optical filter coating,	a<br>
polarizing coating, an oxygen-barrier coating, or	a<br>
combination of such coatings.<br>
In particular for high-specification optical<br>
applications, e.g. in the form of ophthalmic lenses, it<br>
has . proven advantageous for the glass transition<br>
temperature of an article composed of the polyamide<br>
molding composition to be above 90Â°C or 100Â°C,<br>
preferably above 130Â°C, particularly preferably above<br>
150Â°C.<br>
The present invention moreover provides a process for<br>
production of an article as stated above, particularly<br>
preferably of an ophthalmic lens, which comprises<br>
molding a polyamide molding composition as stated above<br>
in an extrusion process, in an injection-molding<br>
process, or in an in-mold-coating process, to give the<br>
article, where the photochromic dye can be introduced<br>
in an advance and/or, if appropriate, in a downstream<br>
dip-bath-coating process and/or thermal transfer<br>
process (or in any other doping process) into the<br>
mixture composed of transparent polyamide and of<br>
further polymer. The photochromic article can also be a<br>
photochromic foil which can be applied to a substrate,<br>
preferably a conventional lens not photochromically<br>
modified, via lamination or adhesive bonding.<br>
Such a process for production of a bulk-colored article<br>
can by way of example comprise compounding the<br>
photochromic dye together with the transparent<br>
homopolyamide and/or copolyamide and with the further<br>
polymer, where the dye can, by way of example, be added<br>
in the form of a liquid concentrate to the polymer melt<br>
composed of transparent homopolyamide and/or<br>
copolyamide and further polymer with the aid of a<br>
metering pump and/or the dye in the form of a solid is<br><br>
applied to the other components in a mixing drum, and<br>
where, if appropriate, application aids can also be<br>
used. In another possible method, the dya and the<br>
further polymer are processed to give a masterbatch<br>
with high color concentration which is preferably up to<br>
3 0%, and the reguired amount of this masterbatch is<br>
processed with the transparent polyamide and/or<br>
copolyamide in an extruder to give pellets or is<br>
converted directly into the finished molding in the<br>
injection-molding machine.<br>
The proposed polyamide molding composition can be used<br>
by way of example as constituent or coating of elements<br>
with spectral filter effect, e.g. in the form of<br>
spectacle lens, sun lens, corrective lens, or optical<br>
filter, or in the form of a switching assembly or<br>
optical signal processing, ski goggles, visor, safety<br>
spectacles, photorecording, display, optical data<br>
storage, or windows of buildings and of vehicles, etc.<br>
Secondly, it can also be used in connection with<br>
decorative elements or with structural elements, for<br>
example in the form of a spectacle frame, toy, or<br>
cover, particularly in the form of a mobile-telephone<br>
case, a part of electronic devices, a coating,<br>
particularly of packaging, of decorative items, of<br>
sports equipment, or of cladding, preferably in the<br>
automobile sector. In the case of the last applications<br>
it is sometimes sufficient to have photochromicity not<br>
in transmission but in reflection.<br>
Further embodiments are described in the dependent claims and are included in the description;<br>
METHODS. OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Examples will be used below to illustrate the<br>
invention. The examples are intended to indicate how a<br>
polyamide molding composition can be prepared and, for<br><br>
example, processed to give a molding, but are not<br>
intended to be interpreted as restricting the protected<br>
subject matter defined in the annexed patent claims.<br>
 Examples 1 to 13 and comparative examples (CE) 1 to 5:<br>
First, the polymer, mixtures, composed of transparent<br>
polyamide and of a block copolymer as further polymer,<br>
were prepared on a Collin Teach-Line ZK25T L/D - 18<br>
twin-screw extruder. The barrel temperatures were from<br>
200 to 280Â°C except in the feed zone, and the screw<br>
rotation rate was 120 to 250 rpm.<br>
The spirooxazine dyes (OP 14 BLUE, OP 19 RED) were<br>
applied with the aid of Tween. 20 (0.05% by weight) to<br>
the pellets of the transparent polyamides or to the<br>
polymer mixtures based on the transparent polyamides,<br>
in a mixing drum. These mixtures were then processed in<br>
an Arburg Allrounder 350-90-220D injection-molding<br>
machine to give plaques of dimensions 30x30xlmm,<br>
the cylinder temperatures being from 200 to 260Â°C and<br>
the mold temperature being from 2 0 to 60Â°C. The screw<br>
rotation rate was from 150 to 400 rpm.<br>
The constitutions of the photochromic polyamide molding<br>
compositions used in each of the inventive examples are<br>
collated in tables 1 and 2, and those of the<br>
comparative examples are collated in table 3.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
*) Irradiation time: 3 0 seconds<br>
The evaluation used- in the .tables .. for photochromic<br>
behavior, using the symbols --, -, o, +, and ++ is<br>
based on qualitative visual assessment, and this is<br>
based on the rapidity of coloring and of fading<br>
(kinetics) , and also on the depth of color achievable<br>
after irradiation.<br>
Optical filtering in spectacle lenses has two<br>
functions. Firstly, the intensity of light reaching the<br>
eye is reduced, and secondly dangerous UV radiation is<br>
kept away from the eye. since most photochromic dyes<br>
have intense absorption bands in the UV-A and UV-B<br>
region, even low concentrations of further UV absorbers<br>
(UV blockers), e.g. Tinuvin 326, are sufficient to<br>
achieve (inventive example 12) adequate UV-region<br>
absorption for spectacle lenses. In inventive<br>
example 12, therefore, even 0.05% by weight of<br>
Tinuvin 32S is sufficient to achieve a pronounced UV<br>
cutoff at 3 90 nm.<br><br><br><br>
*) Irradiation time: 30 seconds<br>
n.d.: not determined<br>
From table 3 it can be concluded that comparative<br>
examples CE3, CE4, and also CE5 show positive results<br>
with respect to photochromic properties, but the<br>
mechanical properties of the materials are unsuitable<br>
for the inventive applications. Articles or layers<br>
produced from molding compositions corresponding to<br>
CE3-CE5 are too soft, or have too little heat<br>
resistance for such applications.<br>
The optical measurements were carried out on<br>
Datacolor SF 600Plus color measurement equipment. An<br>
LED panel (10 x 8 diodes) with an emission maximum at<br>
about 415 nm (half-value width about 50 nm) was used<br>
for excitation of the dyes, applying a voltage of 27 V<br>
with a current of 0.05 ampere. This method was selected<br>
since the effect achieved by this irradiation was the<br>
same, with respect to the photochromic effect, as that<br>
occurring in January at the Applicant's location using<br>
natural insolation when the sky is cloudless. The<br>
spectral studies were carried out at a temperature of<br>
20Â°C, and it is known that the kinetics of darkening<br>
and of fading are temperature dependent.<br>
The plagues were then placed, unirradiated, in the beam<br>
path of the flash lamp (transmittance measurement<br>
mode), and the absorption spectrum was measured from<br>
400 to 700 nm. The plaque was then irradiated for<br>
3 0 sec by means of the LED panel and the absorption<br>
spectrum was recorded immediately after removal of the<br>
radiation source. The absorption spectrum thus measured<br>
provides the maximum achievable darkening (color<br><br>
saturation) for the purposes of present considerations.<br>
However, because the reverse reaction of the dye to<br>
give its colorless form is sometimes very rapid, with<br>
resultant fading of the plaque, a maximum darkening<br>
thus determined is markedly below the genuine<br>
saturation achieved under irradiation, since up to<br>
2 seconds can pass before the actual spectral<br>
measurement takes place. It is clear that the reverse<br>
reaction takes place most rapidly specifically in the<br>
state of maximum darkening, at which the highest<br>
concentration of excited dye molecules is present.<br>
In order to measure the rate of fading, the absorption<br>
spectrum was recorded at various times after removal of<br>
the radiation source. The transrnittanca values<br>
determined at various junctures at wavelength 600 nm<br>
are collated in tables 4 and 5 for inventive examples 3<br>
to 9. The AirwearÂ® T5G lens from ESSILOR, France serves<br>
as comparison. This lens is a plastic lens (thickness<br>
2 mm) composed of polycarbonate. The lens is either<br>
colored by dip-bath coating or coated with a<br>
photochromic lacquer. The transmittance of this lens<br>
was determined at 580 nm, because of the characteristic<br>
positioning of the absorption bands.<br>
Markedly longer irradiation with the LED panel gave<br>
more marked darkening (saturation) than shown in the<br>
values of tables 1-3. By way of example, transmittance<br>
in inventive example 3 is reduced from 60% to 55% if<br>
the irradiation time is extended from 3 0 to<br>
12 0 seconds.<br>
Table 4: Transmittance (%) at 600 nm measured on<br>
30x30x1 mm plagues as a function of time (fading) ;<br>
plaques were previously irradiated for 3 0 seconds with<br>
the LED panel; "0 seconds" therefore represents the<br>
first measurement after the end of irradiation.<br><br><br><br><br>
An impression of the speed of return of the various<br>
test specimens to the colorless state Is given by the<br>
interval stated in tables 4 and 5 during which the<br>
darkening (transmittance in unexcited . state minus<br>
transmittance at color saturation) shows 80% reversion.<br>
It is interesting that this interval for the decrease<br>
in depth of color of the photochromic polyamide<br>
compositions can be controlled within a wide range via<br><br>
selection of the added polymer. Values of from 20 to<br>
65 0 seconds are realized in the present inventive<br>
examples.<br>
Haze was determined at 23Â°C using a Haze-Gard Plus from<br>
Byk-Gardener to ASTM D1003 (illuminant C).<br>
The production process for the plaques of thickness<br>
1 mm as stated in the tables above is not<br>
representative of particularly high-specification<br>
optical applications, since the molds used do not meet<br>
the requirements for such high-level applications. For<br>
comparison. taking the abovementioned inventive<br>
example 3 as a basis, i.e. the molding composition of<br>
inventive example 3, processing was again carried out<br>
to give a flat 2 mm plaque using a mold with better<br>
suitability for high-specification optical purposes<br>
(polished and under ideal injection-molding<br>
conditions). The following values were obtained here in<br>
the unirradiated state: transmittance = 89%,<br>
haze = 1.1. In other words, ideal manufacture of the<br>
moldings gives even higher transmittance and an even<br>
smaller haze value (in the unirradiated state).<br>
The glass transition temperature of the transparent<br>
polyamide used inter alia in inventive example 3 is<br>
155Â°C. The glass transition temperature of the blend<br>
with 10% of PE 73 34 is 151Â°C. The marked improvement in<br>
the photochromic effect cannot therefore be explained<br>
here in the potentially obvious way solely via the<br>
macroscopic magnitude of the glass transition<br>
temperature, since this has been reduced by no more<br>
than 4Â°C by virtue of the mixture. Instead, the local segment freedom of movement at the location of the dye<br>
molecules must be significantly increased, in order to<br>
achieve the desired effect. The higher local freedom of<br>
movement or the reduced local viscosity is brought<br>
about via flexible main chain sections or flexible side<br><br>
chains of the further polymer.<br><br>
FE7334 is a polyesteramide based on polyamide-12 and<br>
dimer diol, described in EP 0955326 B1 (glass<br>

Tween 2 0 is a polyoxyethylene derivative of a fatty<br>
acid ester of sorbitan and is also termed<br>
Polysorbat 20, and is an application aid often used for<br>
various dyes.<br>
PEBAX 5533 and 7033 are polyamide-12 block copolymers<br>
having ether segments from ARKEMA, France (Tg - about<br>
-40Â°C).<br>
NCCÂ® dyes OP 14 BLUE and OP 19 RED from New Prismatic<br>
Enterprise Co. , Ltd., Taiwan were used as photochromic<br>
dyes.<br>
Polyshine Blue I was also used as photochromic dye and<br>
is obtainable from Polychrom Co., Ltd. (Korea).<br>
Tinuvin 326, obtainable from CIBA SC AG, Switzerland,<br>
was also used as UV absorber:<br><br><br>
The relative viscosity (Î·rel) was measured according to<br>
DIN EN ISO 307 in a 0.5 weight% solution in m-cresol at<br>
a temperature of 20Â°C.<br>
The glass transition temperature (Tg.) was determined<br>
according to ISO 11357-1/2;<br>
The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was carried<br>
out with a heating rate of 2 0K/min. The values are<br>
given for the onset.<br>

XE3680 is a heat/ov masterbatch based on polyamide-12.<br>
XE2828 is a polyamide-12 oligomer whose number average<br>
molar mass is about 2000 g/mol, having mainly non-<br>
condensable alkyl end groups.<br>
GRILAMID L16 is a low-viscosity polyamide-12.<br>
Results:<br><br>
Haze and photochromic effect are improved via addition<br>
of low-viscosity polyamide-12 (cf. inventive example 14<br>
and inventive example 15).<br>
Furthermore, addition of polyamide-12 and polyamide<br>
oligomer permits processing of the photochromic<br>
polyamide molding composition under gentler conditions<br>
or incorporation of the photochromic dye into the<br>
thermoplastic molding composition under gentler<br>
conditions, thus permitting substantial inhibition of<br>
degradation of the unstable photochromic dye during the<br>
extrusion and/or injection-molding process.<br>
The gate marks (round plaque, 70 x 2 mm) markedly<br>
visible in inventive example 17 can be avoided by<br>
various measures. Addition of 10% by weight or more of<br>
a low-viscosity polyamide-12 is effective in inhibiting<br>
formation of gate marks.<br>
Gate marks can likewise be avoided if the ratio of<br>
solution viscosities of the transparent<br>
polyamide/copolyamide and of the polymer component<br>
whose glass transition temperature is below 80Â°C is<br>
smaller than 1.2, particularly smaller than 1.1 (see<br>
inventive example 20 compared with inventive example 19<br>
and inventive example 18 compared with inventive<br>
example 17, and also inventive example 21).<br>
Haze, too, decreases for identical chemical<br>
constitution of the polymer components as the ratio of<br>
the solution viscosities of the two polymer components<br>
-falls. In inventive- example 19,with a ratio of 1.22<br>
for the solution viscosities, the observed haze is 3,9,<br>
whereas in IE20 with a lower ratio of solution<br>
viscosities of 1.04, the result is markedly lower haze<br>
of 1.8.<br>
Although addition of polyamide-12 oligomer does not<br><br>
necessarily always inhibit formation of gate marks, it<br>
makes processing easier overall, by virtue of lower<br>
melt viscosity and longer flow path.<br><br>
