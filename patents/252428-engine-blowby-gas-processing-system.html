A pair of couplers 55, 55 having an enormous head are integrated with the outside of the frame 48 and the coupling of the frame 48 to the cleaner case 20 is guaranteed by elastically fitting these into a pair of coupling holes 56, 56 made on the ceiling wall of the cleaner case 20. [0026]<br>
Again as shown in Figs. 3 and 5, a pair of front and rear nuts 57, 57 are attached on one side in a lateral direction of the top face of the cleaner case 20, one ear piece 58 is integrated with the top face of the cleaner case on the other side, one side of the cleaner case 20 is fixed to one side of the body frame 1 by bolts 63, 63 (see Fig. 2) screwed to the nuts 57, 57 and the ear piece 58 is connected to the other sides of the right and left body frames 1 by a bolt. Hereby, the air cleaner 16 is supported by the body frame 1. [0027]<br>
As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the swollen part 17 forming the gas-liquid separating chamber 17a is integrated with the upside of the upstream end of the connecting tube 15 as described above and a battery box 59 made of synthetic resin for housing a battery 64 is coupled to the cleaner case 20 immediately under the swollen part 17 and on one side of the connecting tube 15.<br>
[0028]<br>
A coupling projection 60 the cross section of which is T type is integrated with the back opposite to the cleaner case 20 of the battery box 59 and is fitted to a coupling groove 61 the cross section of which is T type and which is provided to the front of the cleaner case 20 . A bracket 62 is integrated with the front of the batter box 59 and is connected to the body frame 1 by a bolt. Hereby, the battery box 59 is supported by the body frame 1 and the cleaner case 20. [0029]<br>
As a result, dead space immediately under the swollen part 17 and on one side of the connecting tube 15 is utilized for space for installing the battery box 59, the periphery of the engine E can be compacted and the supporting structure of the battery box 59 can be simplified. [0030]<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 3, the rear cushion 6 is arranged utilizing the dead space between the connecting tube 15 and the swollen part 17. [0031]<br>
Next, the action of the embodiment of the invention will be described. [0032]<br>
In an intake process of the engine E, after outside air that enters the air entrance 50 passes a pair of air passages 54, 54, being divided into a pair of air passages, the outside air enters the cleaner case 20 via the common air exit 51, is filtered by the cleaner element 31, passes the frame trap 28,<br>
further passes the connecting tube 15 and the carburetor 12 and is inhaled by the engine E, being mixed with jetted fuel in the carburetor 12. In the while, as intake noise caused in the air cleaner 16 is attenuated, passing a pair of air passages 54, 54 relatively narrowed, noise leaking outside can be reduced. [0033]<br>
However, in the case of a race in which the output of the engine E is regarded as important and the motorcycle M is driven, if the intake noise-damping box 46 is detached from the cleaner case 20 and outside air is directly taken in from the air intake 45 having a large opening, resistance to intake is reduced and the output of the engine can be enhanced. [0034]<br>
While the engine E is driven, blowby gas caused in the crankcase Ec flows into the gas-liquid separating chamber 17a from the breather port 41 via the breather tube 42, when the blowby gas is expanded, it is separated into gas and liquid, separated oil again flows in the breather tube 42 downward and is returned into the crankcase Ec from the breather port 41, the blowby gas from which oil is separated is sent into the intake passage 15a in the connecting tube 15 via the blowby gas exit 36, is inhaled into the engine E, being mixed with inhaled air passing the intake passage 15a and there, a combustion process is executed. [0035]<br>
Even if oil separated from blowby gas in the gas-liquid separating chamber 17a should rise along an inner wall on the<br>
side of the blowby gas exit 36 of the gas-liquid separating chamber 17a by the action of manifold air pressure, the oil can be prevented from entering the blowby gas exit 36 because the rise of the oil is prevented by the oil return wall 37 before the blowby gas exit 36. [0036]<br>
As the swollen part 17 functioning as the gas-liquid separating chamber 17a is integrated with the connecting tube 15, an oil separator tank is not required to be specially provided on the way of the breather tube 42, therefore, means for supporting the tank is not required, the configuration can be simplified and the cost can be reduced. [0037]<br>
Particularly, in case the gas-liquid separating chamber 17a is formed between the swollen part 17 integrated with one side of the upstream end of the connecting tube 15 and the element setting plate 21 covering the open end and the cut-out blowby gas exit 36 is formed in the partition 35 between the gas-liquid separating chamber 17a and the intake passage 15a in the connecting tube 15, the element setting plate 21 joins the configuration of the gas-liquid separating chamber 17a, facilitates the formation of the gas-liquid separating chamber 17a, the number of parts is prevented from being increasing and the cost can be more reduced. [0038]<br>
