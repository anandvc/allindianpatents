				<td>The present invention relates to an improved pro for the production of benzophenones or substituted benzophenones. More particularly, the invention relates to a process for producing benzophenone and methyl-benzophenones, represented by the formula 1 shown  in the drawing accompanying this  specification,<br>
where  R is H or CH  in high selectivity at para  posi-<br>
3<br>
tion  with  the use of benzoyl chloride and  a  zeolite catalyst.   Benzophenone  and methylbenzophenones   in particular  are used mainly as photoinitiators for  UV-curable printing inks and coatings.  They are  employed in  the  perfume industry as a fixative and as  a  fragrance with a flowery note and also as intermediates in the preparation of agricultural chemicals. In the prior art, benzophenone is usually produced by  atmospheric  oxidation of  diphenylmethane  in  the presence of metal catalysts such as copper  naphthenate (  Universal Oil Products Co., US pat. 3642 906,  1969; Nippon Shokubai Kagaku, Jap. Pat. 59 219 248, 1983). Other  processes include Friedel-Crafts  acylation of  benzene  with benzoyl chloride or of  benzene  with phosgene (BASF, DT 403 507, 1920) .<br>
There  are several processes or methods  available in the prior art for the production of  methylbenzophenones from toluene.  In one method, methylbenzophenones<br><br>
isomers  were  obtained by the benzoylation  of  toluene with  benzoyl  chloride using Nafion-H  catalyst  (G.A. .Olah  et al. Synthesis p. 672, 1978).  The method  disclosed  in  this report has the  disadvantage  of  only achieving low Para/Ortho isomer ratio (3.32) . In  another  method (G.A. Olah et  al.  JACS,  93, 6964, 1971) benzoylation of toluene with benzoyl  chloride is described.  The reaction is carried out in  the<br>
presence  of  a lewis acid catalyst, AlCl .   The  main<br>
,3<br>
drawback  of  this homogeneous reaction is the  use  of stoichiometric  amount of catalyst.  operational  problems, corrosion and separation of the catalyst. In  another  report (Applied Catalysis,  59,  197, 1990), liquid phase benzoylation of toluene with  benzoyl  chloride  is disclosed using  solid  superacid  of<br>
2-sulphate  supported  alumina  (SO   /Al 0 ).   Further,<br>
4     2 3<br>
this  method has disadvantage of only  achieving  lower<br>
conversion  of  benzoyl chloride (46  wt.%)  and  lower<br>
Para/Ortho ratio (3.17) of methyl benzophenones.<br>
Several  types  of  insolube  heterogeneous   acid<br>
catalysts have recently been proposed for liquid  phase<br>
reactions,  to replace the  conventional  heterogeneous<br>
catalysts such as AlCl  and sulphuric acid, which often<br>
3<br>
pose  difficult  operational  problems  of   corrosion,<br><br>
catalyst removal from the product and requirement of  a<br>
stoichiometric amount of catalyst.<br>
In  all the methods described above, some of  them<br>
are hazardous and difficult to handle.  In some  cases,<br>
catalyst  is consumed during the reaction and  in  some<br>
cases catalysts are less active.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved process for producing benzophenone and para-methylbenzophenone in high selectivity at higher conversion level by benzoylation of benzene and toluene, respectively, in the presence of a zeolite catalyst.<br>
Another  object  of the present  invention  is  to obviate the drawbacks and limitations of the  prior-art process  by providing an improved process for the  production  of substituted benzophenones from benzene  and toluene.<br>
Yet  another object of the invention is to provide an improved process which operates at a relatively  low temperature.  Still  another  object  of  this  present invention is to provide an improved process which makes use of non-hazardous solid zeolite catalyst. A further object of the invention is to provide an improved process which leads to high yields of  ketones resulting from high conversion and high selectivities.<br>
4<br><br>
Still  another object of the invention is to  provide an improved process which is safe, not being prone to explosions.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of benzophenone or substituted benzophenones of the formula (1) where R<br>
represents H or CH  which comprises reacting benzene or<br>
3<br>
substituted  benzene  with solution of  a  benzoylating<br>
agent  in  organic solvent in the presence of  a  solid<br>
crystalline  microporous  catalyst  composite  material<br>
consisting of alumino silicate having molar composition<br>
in  anhydrous state as follows:  M/n  : AlO2    :  SiO2<br><br>
(where M is proton or alkali or alkaline or rare  earth<br>
metals  with valency n and z is between  2-500)  having<br>
5i0 /Al O  molar ratio of from 2-50 and a pore size  of 2   2 3<br>
o 5-10  Ao  at a temparature in .the range of  5-150 C  at<br>
atmospheric pressure for a period in the range of 1-24 hours and recovering the benzophenone and or substituted benzophenones from the reaction products by conventional methods.<br>
It  has been found that the object of the  present invention can be attained by using microporous alumino-silicate zeolites as catalyst.  .In accordance with  the process  of the present invention benzene  and  toluene<br><br>
can be converted to benzophenone and 4-methyl benzophe-none, respectively in the presence of a zeolite catalyst composite material alumino silicate, using solution  of a benzoylating agent with stirring in a  batch<br>
o reactor at temperatures ranging between 5 to 150 C.<br>
In the process of the present invention,  preferably  a zeolite having a SiO /Al O  molar ratio of 3  to<br>
2   2 3<br>
100  and a pore size of from 5 to 10 Ao is used as  the<br>
catalyst .<br>
When a zeolite with a SiO /Al 0 " molar ratio or  a  ~<br>
2   2 3<br>
pore size being outside the above mentioned range, is used, the formation of benzophenone and para selectivity for 4-methylbenzophenone will be substantially poor. According to the present invention, it is also possible to employ a synthetic zeolite or natural zeolite. Further the ion exchageable cations contained in such zeolites may be usually sodium or potassium, but may further include other cations such as rare earth metals. The cations may be of the same type or of two or more different types.<br>
Benzene and toluene which are employed in the process of the present invention as the starting material are desired to be high in purity. Benzoylating agent used in the present invention contains less than 5% benzoic acid. In order to make the reaction to proceed smoothly and to obtain good results, the amount of benzene/or toluene is preferred to be 1 to 10  times<br><br>
(by weight) that of benzoylating agent. In the present invention, benzoyl chloride may be added to react with benzene/or toluene in a manner as follows: 1) benzoylating agent is first added to the reaction mixture and then temperature raised. 2) benzoylating agent is added continuously dropwise upto 2 hours. 3) The reaction mixture is heated upto 80oC and benzoylating agent is added dropwise continuously upto 2.5 hours. The first embodiment is effective to get ketones from benzene/toluene. The time required for the benzoylation of benzene and toluene is within a range of 0.5 to 24 hours and may be within a range of 1 to 8 hours under more preferable reaction conditions. After completion of the benzoylation reaction the reaction solution cooled to room temperature and analyzed with gas chromatograph.<br>
To conduct benzoylation of a toluene in accordance with the process of the present invention, for instance, the zeolite, benzene/toluene and a benzoylating agent is introduced in to the mixture in a liquid phase while stirring the mixture at a temperature of not higher than the boiling point. In this operation, a reaction solvent may be employed as the case requires. As the benzoylating agent, there may be employed any agent commonly employed for -â¢ benzoylation of aromatic rings. Preferred are Benzoyl chloride, benzoic anhyride and benzoic acid. These benzoylating agent may<br><br>
be employed as diluted with an inert gas such as nitrogen.  The reaction temperature for the benzoylation  is usually  from OoC to the boiling point of the  reaction mixture, preferably from 5o-150oC.  The reaction may be conducted  under reduced or elevated pressure,  but  is usually conducted under atmospheric pressure. According to the process of the present invention, it is possible to selectively and efficiently  benzoyi-ate the para-position of the toluene while  suppressing the benzoylation at the ortho and meta position. The advantages of the process of the present  invention<br>
1.	The process of the present invention shows remarkably high industrial merits over prior art process for the preparation of benzophenone and 4-methyl benzophe-none. The starting materials are easely available and easy to handle and that ketones can be produced in high yield by extremely simple operation.<br>
2.	Another advantageous feature of the process of the present invention is that the reaction is carried out at relatively low temparature between 5o and 150oC.<br>
3.	A yet another advantageous feature of the process of the present invention is the use of the non-hazardous solid alumino silicate catalyst.<br>
4. Another important and advantageous feature cf the process of the present invention is that it does not pose risks of explosion.<br><br>
5.	The most important and advantageous feature of the process of the present invention is that both the yields and the selectivities to para-substituted benzo-phenone are very high.<br>
6.	The use of zeolite as the catalyst in the liquid phase organic reactions of the present invention provides the following advantages:<br><br>
a)	Easy separation of products from solids by means of a simple procedure of filtration.<br>
b)	Adsorption  or inclusion of substrate and  reagent molecules in to the small pores of solids with  nanometer dimensions organizes the molecules in close proximity to lower the activation entropy of the reaction.<br>
c)	The co-existing acid and base sites on zeolites accelerate organic reactions synergistically; simultaneous activation of an electrophile and a nucleophile on an acid site and a base site, respectively becomes possible.<br>
d)	We;ll defined crystalline structure, uniform micro cavitie:s effecting selective reactions of organic molecules incorporeted therein under steric restriction.<br>
e)	High cation-exchangeability to ensure easy adjustment of their acidic and basic properties in a wide range of acidity.<br>
