TITLE<br>
VITRONECTIN RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST PHARMACEUTICALS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
5      The present invention provides novel pharmaceuticals useful for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, methods of imaging tumors in a patient, and methods of treating cancer in a patient.  The pharmaceuticals are comprised of a targeting moiety that binds to the vitronectin 10  receptor that is expressed in tumor vasculature, an<br>
optional linking group, and a therapeutically effective radioisotope or diagnostically effective imageable moiety. The therapeutically effective radioisotope emits a gamma ray or alpha particle sufficient to be cytotoxic. 15  The imageable moiety is a gamma ray or positron emitting radioisotope, a magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent, an X-ray contrast agent, or an ultrasound contrast agent.<br>
20	-*<br>
BACKGROUND (MtTHB  INVENTION<br>
Cancer ^is a major publij^health concern in the United States and around the world.  It is estimated that over 1 million new cases of invasive cancer will be<br>
25  diagnosed in the United States in 1998.  The most<br>
prevalent forms of the disease are solid tumors of the lung, breast, prostate, col oft"'and rectum.  Cancer is typically diagnosed by a combination of in vitro tests and imaging procedures.  The imaging procedures include<br>
30  X-ray computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound imaging and radionuclide scintigraphy. Frequently, a contrast agent is administered to the patient to enhance the image obtained by X-ray CT, MRI and ultrasound, and the administration of a<br>
35  radiopharmaceutical that localizes in tumors is required for radionuclide scintigraphy.<br>
Treatment of cancer typically involves the use of external beam radiation therapy and chemotherapy, either alone or in combination, depending on the type and extent<br><br>
of the disease.  A number of chemotherapeutic agents are available, but generally they all suffer from a lack of specificity for tumors versus normal tissues, resulting in considerable side-effects.  The effectiveness of these 5  treatment modalities is also limited, as evidenced by the high mortality rates for a number of cancer types, especially the more prevalent solid tumor diseases.  More effective and specific treatment means continue to be needed. 10      Despite the variety of imaging procedures available for the diagnosis of cancer, there remains a need for improved methods.  In particular, methods that can better differentiate between cancer and other pathologic conditions or benign physiologic abnormalities are 15  needed.  One means of achieving this desired improvement would be to administer to the patient a<br>
metallopharmaceutical that localizes specifically in the tumor by binding to a receptor expressed only in tumors or expressed to a significantly greater extent in tumors 20  than in other tissue. The location of the<br>
metallopharmaceutical could then be detected externally either by its imageable emission in the case of certain radiopharmaceuticals or by its effect on the relaxation rate of water in the immediate vicinity in the case of 25  magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents.<br>
This tumor specific metallopharmaceutical approach can also be used for the treatment of cancer when the metallopharmaceutical is comprised of a particle emitting radioisotope.  The radioactive decay of the isotope at 30  the site of the tumor results in sufficient ionizing radiation to be toxic to the tumor cells.  The specificity of this approach for tumors minimizes the amount of normal tissue that is exposed to the cytotoxic agent and thus may provide more effective treatment with 35  fewer side-effects.<br>
Previous efforts to achieve these desired improvements in cancer imaging and treatment have centered on the use of radionuclide labeled monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments and other proteins or<br><br><br>
polypeptides chat bind to tumor cell surface receptors. The spec:ficity of these radiopharmaceuticals is frequently very high, but they suffer from several disadvantages.  First, because of their high molecular 5  weight, they are generally cleared from the blood stream very slowly, resulting in a prolonged blood background in the images.  Also, due to their molecular weight they do not extravasate readily at the site of the tumor and then only slowly diffuse through the extravascular space to 10  the tumor cell surface.  This results in a very limited amount of the radiopharmaceutical reaching the receptors and thus very low signal intensity in imaging and insufficient cytotoxic effect for treatment.<br>
Alternative approaches to cancer imaging and therapy 15  have involved the use of smal"3r~molecules, such as<br>
peptides, that bind to tumor cell surface receptors.  An In-Ill labeled somatostatin receptor binding peptide, In-lll-DTPA-D-Phe1-ccteotide# is in clinical use in many countries for imaging t umors .^that express the 20  somatostatin receptor (BaTcerT-et al. Life Sci., 1991, 49, 1583-91 and Krenning, et 'al. pEur. J. Nucl. Med., 1993, 20, 716-31K  Higher doses cff*thi7s* radiopharmaceutical have been investigated for potential treatment of these types of cancer (Krenning, et al., Digestion, 1996, 57, 25  57-61) . Several groups are investigating the use of Tc-99m labeled ananlogs of In-lll-DTPA-D-Phe1-octeotide for imaging and Re-186 labeled analogs for therapy (Flanagan, et al., U.S. 5,556,939, Lyle, et al., U.S. 5,382,654, and Albert et al.,U.S. 5,650,134). 30      Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood<br>
vessels are formed from pre-existing capillaries or post capillary venules; it is an important component of a variety of physiological processes including ovulation, embryonic development, wound repair, and collateral 35  vascular generation in the myocardium.  It is also<br>
central to a number of pathological conditions such as tumor growth and metastasis, diabetic retinopathy, and macular degeneration.  The process begins with the<br><br>
activation of existing vascular endothelial cells in response to a variety of cytokines and growth factors. Tumor released cytokines or angiogenic factors stimulate vascular endothelial cells by interacting with specific 5  cell surface receptors for the factors.  The activated endothelial cells secrete enzymes that degrade the basement membrane of the vessels.  The endothelial cells then proliferate and invade into the tumor tissue.  The endothelial cells differentiate to form lumens, making 10  new vessel offshoots of pre-existing vessels.  The new blood vessels then provide nutrients to the tumor permitting further growth and a route for metastasis.<br>
Under normal conditions, endothelial cell proliferation is a very slow process, but it increases 15  for a short period of time during embryOgenesis,<br>
ovulation and wound healing.  This temporary increase in cell turnover is governed by a combination of a number of growth stimulatory factors and"growth suppressing factors.  In pathological angiogenesis, tljis normal 20  balance is disrupted resulting in continued increased endothelial cell proliferation/ Some of the proangiogen^e factors that have -been identified include basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), angiogenin, TGF-alpha, TGF-beta, and vascular endothelium growth factor 25  (VEGF) . While mterferon-alpha, interferon-beta and<br>
thrombospondm are examples of angiogenesis suppressors.<br>
The proliferation and migration of endothelial cells in the extracellular matrix is mediated by interaction with a variety of cell adhesion molecules (Folkman, J., 30  Nature Medicine , 1995, 1, 27-31).  Integrins are a<br>
diverse family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors by which endothelial cells attach to the extracellular matrix, each other and other cells.  The integrin auP, is a receptor for a wide variety for a wide variety of 35  extracellular matrix proteins with an exposed tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp moiety and mediates cellular adhesion to its ligand: vitronectin, fibronectin, and fibrinogen, among<br>
others.  The mtegrin ocvp\ is minimally expressed on normal<br>
■&amp;<br><br><br>
blood vessels, but is significantly upregulated or; vascular cells within a variety of human tumors.  The role of the avP, receptors is to mediate the interaction of the endothelial cells and the extracellular matrix ar.d 5  facilitate the migration of the cells in the direction of the angiogenic signal, the tumor cell population. Angiogenesis induced by bFGF or TNF-alpha depend cr. the agency of the integrm av(33, while angiogenesis induced by VEGF depends on the integrin av(33 (Cheresh et. al., 10  Science, 1955, 270, 1500-2).  Induction of expression of the integrins a,3, and a2P. on the endothelial cell surface is another important mechanism by which VEGF promotes angiogenesis (Senger, et. al., Proc. Natl. Acad, £ci USA, 1997, 84, 13612-7) . 15      Angiogenic factors interact with endothelial cell surface receptors such as the receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, Flk-1/KDR, Flt-1, Tek, tie, neuropilin-1, endoglin, endosialin, and Axl.  The receptors Flk-1/KDR, neuropilin-1, and FH*-1 recognize 20  VEGF and these interactions play key'roles in VEGF-induced angiogenesis.  The Tie subfamily&gt;of:receptor tyrosine kinases are also expressed prominently during blood vessel formation.<br>
Because of the importance of angiogenesis to tumor 25 . growth and metastasis, a number of chemotherapeutic approaches are being developed to interfere with or prevent this process.  One of these approaches, involves the use of anti-angiogenic proteins such as angiostatin and endostatin.  Angiostatin is a 38 kDa fragment of 30  plasminogen that has been shown in animal models to be a potent inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation. (O'Reilly et. al. , Cell, 1994, 79, 315-328)  Endostatin is a 20 kDa C-terminal fragment of collagen XVIII that has also been shown to be a potent inhibitor. (O'Reilly 35  et. al., Cell, 1997, 88, 277-285)  Systemic therapy with endostatin has been shown to result in strong anti-tumor activity in animal models. However, human clinical trials<br><br>
of these two chemotherapeutic agents of biological origin have been hampered by lack of availability.<br>
Another approach to anti-angiogenic therapy is to use 5  targeting moieties that interact with endothelial cell surface receptors expressed in the angiogenic vasculature to which are attached chemotherapeutic agents. Burrows and Thorpe (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci, USA, 1993, 90, 8996-9000) described the use of an antibody-immunotoxin 10  conjugate to eradicate tumors in a mouse model by destroying the tumor vasculature.  The antibody was raised against an endothelial cell class II antigen of the major histocompatibility complex and was then conjugated with the cytotoxic agent, deglycosylated ricm 15  A chain. The same group (Clin. Can..-Res., 1995, 1, 1623-1634) investigated the use of antibodies raised against the endothelial cell surface receptor, endoglin, conjugated to deglycosylated ricin- A- chain. Both of these conjugates exhibited potent anti-tumor activity in mouse 20 -models.  However, both still suffer'drawbacks to routine human use.  As with most antibodies .or other large, foreign proteins, there is considerable; risk of immunologic toxicity which could limit or preclude administration to humans.  Also, whiTe the vasculature 25  targeting may improve the local concentration of the<br>
attached chemotherapeutic agents, the agents still must be. cleaved from the antibody carrTe'r* arid be transported or diffuse into the cells to be cytotoxic.<br>
Thus, it is desirable to provide anti-angiogenic 30  pharmaceuticals and tumor or new vasculature imaging agents which do not suffer from poor diffusion or transportation, possible immunologic toxicity, limited availability, and/or a lack of specificity.<br>
Another application of anti-angiogenic therapy is in 35  treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  In RA, the ingrowth of a highly vascularized pannus is caused by the excessive production of angiogenic factors by the infiltrating macrophages, immune cells, or inflammatory cells. Therefore, it is desirable to have new<br><br>
pharmaceuticals to destroy the highly vascularized pannus that results and thus treat the disease.<br>
There is also a growing interest in therapeutic angiogenesis to improve blood flow in regions of the body 5  that have become ischemic or poorly perfused.  Several investigators are using growth factors administered locally to cause new vasculature to form either in the limbs or the hearr.  The growth factors VEGF and bFGF are the most common for this application.  Recent 10  publications include.-  Takeshita, S., et. al., J. Clm. Invest., 1994, 92, 662-670; and Schaper, W. and Schaper, J., Collateral Circulation:Heart, Brain, Kidney, Limbs, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, 1993.  The main applications that are under investigation in a number of 15  laboratories are for improving cardiac blood flow and in improving peripheral vessal blood flow in the limbs.  For example, Henry, T. et. al. (J. Amer. College Cardiology, 1998, 31, 65A) describe the use of recombinant human VEGF in patients for improving myocardial perfusion by 20  therapeutic angiogenesis.  Patients received infusions of rhVEGF and were monitored by nuclear perfusion imaging 30 and 60 days^post treatment to determine, improvement in myocardial perfusion.  About 50% of patients showed improvement by nuclear perfusion imaging whereas 5/7 25  showed new collatoralization by angiography. Thus, it is desirable to discover a method of monitoring improved cardiac blood flow which is targeted to new collatoral vessels themselves and not, as in nuclear perfusion imaging, a regional consequence of new collatoral 30  vessels.<br>
The detection, imaging and diagnosis of a number cf cardiovascular diseases need to be improved, including restenosis, atherosclerosis, myocardial reperfusion injury, and myocardial ischemia, stunning or infarction. 35  It has recently been determined that in all of these<br>
disease conditions, the integrin receptor ocvP3 plays an important role.<br><br><br>
For example, in the restenosis complication that occurs in -30-50% of patients having undergone angioplasty or stent placement, neointimal hyperplasia and ultimate reocclusion is caused by aggressively 5  proliferating vascular smooth muscle cells that express av|}3. (Cardiovascular Res., 1997, 36, 408-428; DDT, 1997, 2, 187-199; Current Pharm. Design, 1997, 3, 545-584)<br>
Atherosclerosis proceeds from an intial endothelial damage that results in the recruitment and subintimal 10  migration of monocytes at the site of the injury. Growth factors are released which induce medial smooth muscle cells to proliferate and migrate to the intimal layer. The migrating smooth muscle cells express avp3.<br>
In reperfusion injury, neutrophil transmigration is 15  integrin dependent and the integrins moderate initial<br>
infiltration into the viable border zone.  The induction of a5pi, cc4p&gt;l and avp"5 in infiltrating neutrophils occurs within 3 to 5 hours after reperfusion as neutrophils move from the border 2one to the area of necrosis. 20  (Circulation, 1999, 100, 1-275)<br>
Acute or chronic occlusion of a coronary artery is known to result in angiogenesis in the heart as native collateral vessels are recruited to attempt to relieve the ischemia.  However, even a gradual occlusion usually 25  results in areas of infarction as the resulting<br>
angiogenesis is not sufficient to prevent damage. Cardiac angiogenesis has been associated with increased expression of the growth factors VEGF and FGF and the upregulation of the growth factor receptors flt-1 and 30  flk-1/KDR.  (Drugs, 1999, 58, 391-396)<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is one object of the present invention to provide improved anti-angiogenic pharmaceuticals, comprised of a targeting moiety that binds to the vitronectin receptor 5  that is expressed in tumor neovasculature, an optional linking group, and a radioisotope.  The vitronectin receptor binding compounds target the radioisotope to the tumor neovasculature.  The beta or alpha-particle emitting radioisotope emits a cytotoxic amount of 10  ionizing radiation which results in cell death. The<br>
penetrating ability of radiation obviates the requirement that the cytotoxic agent diffuse or be transported into the cell to be cytotoxic.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to 15  provide pharmaceuticals to treat rheumatoid arthritis. These pharmaceuticals comprise a targeting moiety that binds to a receptor that is upregulated during angiogenesis, an optional linking group, and a radioisotope that emits cytotoxic radiation (i.e., beta 20  particles, alpha particles and Auger or Coster-Kronig electrons).  In rheumatoid arthritis, the ingrowth of a highly vascularized pannus is caused by the excessive production of angiogenic factors by the infiltrating macrophages, immune cells, or inflammatory cells. 25  Therefore, the radiopharmaceuticals of the present<br>
invention that emit cytotoxic radiation could be used to destroy the new angiogenic vasculature that results and thus treat the disease.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to 30  provide imaging agents, comprised of vitronectin receptor binding compounds conjugated to an imageable moiety, such as a gamma ray or positron emitting radioisotope, a magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent, an X-ray contrast agent, or an ultrasound contrast agent.  These 35  imaging agents are useful for imaging tumor<br>
neovasculature, therapeutic angiogenesis interventions in the heart, natural angiogenic processes in response to acute or chronic coronary vessel occlusion, restenosis<br><br><br>
post-angioplasty, atherosclerosis and plaque formation, and reperfusion injury.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide compounds useful for preparing the 5  pharmaceuticals of the present invention.  These compounds are comprised of a non-peptide quinolone containing targeting moiety that binds to a receptor that is upregulated during angiogenesis or during cardiovascular diseases, Q, an optional linking group, 10  Ln, and a metal chelator or bonding moiety, Ch-  The<br>
compounds may have one or more protecting groups attached to the metal chelator or bonding moiety.  The protecting groups provide improved stability to the reagents for long-term storage and are removed either immediately 15  prior to or concurrent with the synthesis of the<br>
radiopharmaceuticals.  Alternatively, the compounds of the present invention are comprised of a peptide or peptidomimetic targeting moiety that binds to a receptor that is upregulated during angiogenesis or during 20  cardiovascular diseases, Q, an optional linking group, Ln/ anda surfactant, Sf.<br>
The. pharjnaceuticals of the present invention may be used for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes. Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention 25  are pharmaceuticals comprised of a diagnostically useful radionuclide (i.e., a radioactive metal ion that has imageable gamma ray or positron emissions).  Therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention are pharmaceuticals comprised of a therapeutically useful 30  radionuclide, a radioactive metal ion that emits ionizing radiation such as beta particles, alpha particles and Auger or Coster-Kronig electrons.<br>
The pharmaceuticals comprising a gamma ray or positron emitting radioactive metal ion are useful for 35  imaging tumors and by gamma scintigraphy or positron emission tomography.  The pharmaceuticals comprising a gamma ray or positron emitting radioactive metal ion are also useful for imaging therapeutic angiogenesis, natural<br><br>
angiogenic processes in response to acute or chronic<br>
coronary vessel occlusion, restenosis post-angioplasty,<br>
atherosclerosis and plaque formation, and reperfusion<br>
injury by gamma scintigraphy or positron emission<br>
5  tomography.  The pharmaceuticals comprising a particle<br>
emitting radioactive metal ion are useful for treating<br>
cancer by delivering a cytotoxic dose of radiation tc the<br>
tumors.  The pharmaceuticals comprising a particle<br>
emitting radioactive metal ion are also useful for<br>
10  treating rheumatoid arthritis by destroying the formation<br>
of angiogenic vasculature.  The pharmaceuticals<br>
comprising a paramagnetic metal ion are useful as<br>
magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents.  The<br>
pharmaceuticals comprising one or more X-ray absorbing or<br>
15  "heavy" atoms of atomic number 20 or greater are useful<br>
as X-ray contrast agents.  The pharmaceuticals comprising<br>
a microbubble of a biocompatible gas, a liquid carrier,<br>
and a surfactant microsphere, are useful as ultrasound<br>
contrast agents.<br>

DEFINITIONS<br>
The compounds herein described may have asymmetric centers.  Unless otherwise indicated, all chiral, 5  diastereomeric and racemic forms are included in the present invention.  Many geometric isomers of olefins, C=N double bonds, and the like can also be present in the compounds described herein, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention.  It will be 10  appreciated that compounds of the present invention<br>
contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms, and may be isolated in optically active or racemic forms.  It is well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms, such as by resolution of racemic forms or by 15  synthesis from optically active starting materials.  Two distinct isomers (cis and trans) of the peptide bond are known to occur; both can also be present in the compounds described herein, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention.  The D and 20  L-isomers of a particular amino acid are designated herein using the conventional 3-letter abbreviation of the amino acid, as indicated by the following examples: D-Leu, or L-Leu.<br>
When any variable occurs more than one time in any 25  substituent or in any formula, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence.  Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-2 R52, then said group may optionally be substituted with up to two R52, and R52 at 30  each occurrence is selected independently from the<br>
defined list of possible R52. Also, by way of example, for the group -N(R53)2, each of the two R53 substituents on N is independently selected from the defined list of possible R53.  Combinations of substituents and/or 35  variables are permissible only if such combinations<br>
result in stable compounds.  When a bond to a substituent is shown to cross the bond connecting two atoms in a<br><br>
ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring.<br>
The term "nonpeptide" means preferably less than three amide bonds in the backbone core of the targeting 5  moiety or preferably less than three amino acids or amino acid mimetics in the targeting moiety.<br>

A "reducing agent" is a compound that reacts with a radionuclide, which is typically obtained as a relatively unreactive, high oxidation state compound, to lower its oxidation state by transferring electron (s) to the 5  radionuclide, thereby making it more reactive.  Reducing agents useful in the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals and in diagnostic kits useful for the preparation of said radiopharmaceuticals include but are not limited to stannous chloride, stannous fluoride, formamidine 10  sulfinic acid, ascorbic acid, cysteine, phosphines, and cuprous or ferrous salts.  Other reducing agents are described in Brodack et. al., PCT Application 94/22496, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A "transfer ligand" is a ligand that forms an 15  intermediate complex with a metal ion that is stable enough to prevent unwanted side-reactions but labile enough to be converted to a metallopharmaceutical. The formation of the intermediate complex is kinetically favored while the formation of the metallopharmaceutical 20  is thermodynamically favored.  Transfer ligands useful in the preparation of metallopharmaceuticals and in diagnostic kits useful for the preparation of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals include but are not limited to gluconate, glucoheptonate, mannitol, glucarate, 25  N, N,N' ,N'-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, pyrophosphate and methylenediphosphonate.  In general, transfer ligands are comprised of oxygen or nitrogen donor atoms.<br>
The term "donor atom" refers to the atom directly attached to a metal by a chemical bond. 30      "Ancillary" or "co-ligands" are ligands that are incorporated into a radiopharmaceutical during its synthesis.  They serve to complete the coordination sphere of the radionuclide together with the chelator or radionuclide bonding unit of the reagent.  For 35  radiopharmaceuticals comprised of a binary ligand system, the radionuclide coordination sphere is composed of one or more chelators or bonding units from one or more reagents and one or more ancillary or co-ligands, provided that there are a total of two types of ligands,<br><br><br>
chelators or bonding units.  For example, a radiopharmaceutical comprised of one chelator or bonding unit from one reagent and two of the same ancillary or co-ligands and a radiopharmaceutical comprised of two 5  chelators or bonding units from one or two reagents and one ancillary or cc?-ligand are both considered to be comprised of binary ligand systems.  For radiopharmaceuticals comprised of a ternary ligand system, the radionuclide coordination sphere is composed 10  of one or more chelators or bonding units from one or more reagents and one or more of two different types of ancillary or co-ligands, provided that there are a total of three types of ligands, chelators or bonding units. For example, a radiopharmaceutical comprised of one 15  chelator or bonding unit from one reagent and two<br>
different ancillary or co-ligands is considered to be comprised of a ternary ligand system.<br>
Ancillary or co-ligands useful in the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals and in diagnostic kits useful for 20  the preparation of said radiopharmaceuticals are comprised of one or more oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, arsenic, selenium, and tellurium donor atoms.  A ligand can be a transfer ligand in the synthesis of a radiopharmaceutical and also serve as an 25  ancillary or co-lig^nd in another radiopharmaceutical. Whether a ligand is termed a transfer or ancillary or co-ligand depends on  whether the ligand remains in the radionuclide coordination sphere in the radiopharmaceutical, which is determined by the 30  coordination chemistry of the radionuclide and the chelator or bonding unit of the reagent or reagents. A •chelator" or "bonding unit" is the moiety or group on a reagent that binds to a metal ion through the formation of chemical bonds with one or more donor atoms. 35      The term "binding site"  means the site in vivo or in vitro that binds a biologically active molecule.<br>
A "diagnostic kit" or "kit" comprises a collection of components, termed the formulation, in one or more vials which are used by the practicing end user in a<br><br>
clinical or pharmacy setting to synthesize diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals.  The kit provides all the requisite components to synthesize and use the diagnostic radiopharmaceutical except those that are commonly 5  available to the practicing end user, such as water or saline for injection, a solution of the radionuclide, equipment for heating the kit during the synthesis of the radiopharmaceutical, if required, equipment necessary for administering the radiopharmaceutical to the patient such 10  as syringes and shielding, and imaging equipment.<br>
Therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, X-ray contrast agent pharmaceuticals, ultrasound contrast agent pharmaceuticals and metallopharmaceuticals for magnetic resonance imaging contrast are provided to the end user 15  in their final form in a formulation contained typically in one vial, as either a lyophilized solid or an aqueous solution.  The end user reconstitutes the lyophilized with water or saline and withdraws the patient dose or just withdraws the dose from the aqueous solution 20  formulation as provided.<br>
A "lyophilization aid" is a component that has favorable physical properties for lyophilization, such as the glass transition temperature, and is added to the formulation to improve the physical properties of the 25  combination of all the components of the formulation for lyophi1i zat ion.<br>
A "stabilization aid" is a component that is added to the metallopharmaceutical or to the diagnostic kit either to stabilize the metallopharmaceutical or to 30  prolong the shelf-life of the kit before it must be used. Stabilization aids can be antioxidants, reducing agents or radical scavengers and can provide improved stability by reacting preferentially with species that degrade other components or the metallopharmaceutical. 35      A "solubilization aid" is a component that improves the solubility of one or more other components in the medium required for the formulation.<br>
A "bacteriostat" is a component that inhibits the growth of bacteria in a formulation either during its<br><br>
storage before use of after a diagnostic Kit is used to synthesize a radiopharmaceutical.<br>

Angiogenesis is the process of formation of new 5  capillary blood vessels from existing vasculature. It is an important component of a variety of physiological processes including ovulation, embryonic development, wound repair, and collateral vascular generation in the myocardium. It is also central to a number of 10  pathological conditions such as tumor growth and metastasis, diabetic retinopathy, and macular degeneration. The process begins with the activation of existing vascular endothelial cells in response to a variety of cytokines and growth factors. The activated 15  endothelial cells secrete enzymes that degrade the<br>
basement membrane of the vessels.  The endothelial cells then proliferate and migrate into the extracellular matrix first forming tubules and subsequently new blood vessels. 20      Under normal conditions, endothelial cell<br>
proliferation is a very slow process, but it increases for a short^period of time during embryogenesis, ovulation and wound healing. This temporary increase in cell turnover is governed by a combination of a number of 25  growth stimulatory factors and growth suppressing factors.  In pathological angiogenesis, this normal balance is disrupted resulting in continued increased endothelial cell proliferation. Some of the pro-angiogenic factors that have been identified include 30  basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), angiogenin,  TGF-alpha, TGF-beta, and vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF), while interferon-alpha, interferon-beta and thrombospondin are examples of angiogenesis suppressors. Angiogenic factors interact with endothelial cell 35  surface receptors such as the receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, Flk-1/KDR, Flt-1, Tek, Tie, neuropilin-1, endoglin, endosialin, and Axl. The receptors Flk-1/KDR, neuropilin-1,  and Flt-1 recognize VEGF and these interactions play key roles in VEGF-<br><br><br>
induced angiogenesis.  The Tie subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases are also expressed prominently during blood vessel formation.<br>
The proliferation and migration of endothelial cells 5  in the extracellular matrix is mediated by interaction with a variety of cell adhesion molecules. Integrins are a diverse family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors by which endothelial cells attach to the extracellular matrix, each other and other cells.  Angiogenesis induced<br>
10  by bFGF or TNF-alpha depend on the agency of the integrin avb3, while angiogenesis induced by VEGF depends on the integrin avb5 (Cheresh et. al., Science, 1995, 270, 1500-2).  Induction of expression of the integrins albl and a2bl on the endothelial cell surface is another important<br>
15  mechanism by which VEGF promotes angiogenesis (Senger, et. al.. Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci USA, 1997, 94, 13612-7).<br>
The pharmaceuticals of the present invention are comprised of a non-peptide targeting moiety for the vitronectin receptor that is expressed or upregulated in<br>
20  angiogenic tumor vasculature.<br>
The ultrasound contrast agents of the present invention comprise a plurality of vitronectin receptor targeting moieties attached to or incorporated into a<br>
25  microbubble of a biocompatible gas, a liquid carrier, and a surfactant microsphere, further comprising an optional linking moiety, Ln, between the targeting moieties and the microbubble.  In this context, the term liquid carrier means aqueous solution and the term surfactant<br>
30  means any amphiphilic material which produces a reduction in interfacial tension in a solution. A list of suitable surfactants for forming surfactant microspheres is disclosed in EP0727225A2, herein incorporated by reference.  The term surfactant microsphere includes<br>
35  nanospheres, liposomes, vesicles and the like. The<br>
biocompatible gas can be air, or a fluorocarbon, such as a C3-C5 perfluoroalkane, which provides the difference in echogenicity and thus the contrast in ultrasound imaging.<br><br>
The gas is encapsulated or contained in the microsphere to which is attached the biodirecting group, optionally via a linking group.  The attachment can be covalent, ionic or by van der Waals forces.  Specific examples of 5  such contrast agents include lipid encapsulated<br>
perfluorocarbons with a plurality of tumor neovasculature receptor binding peptides, polypeptides or peptidomimetics.<br>
X-ray contrast agents of the present invention are 10  comprised of one or more vitronectin receptor targeting moieties attached to one or more X-ray absorbing or "heavy" atoms of atomic number 20 or greater, further comprising an optional linking moiety, Ln, between the targeting moieties and the X-ray absorbing atoms. The 15  frequently used heavy atom in X-ray contrast agents is iodine. Recently, X-ray contrast agents comprised of metal chelates (Wallace, R., U.S. 5,417,959) and polychelates comprised of a plurality of metal ions (Love, D., U.S. 5,679,810) have been disclosed. More 20  recently, multinuclear cluster complexes have been<br>
disclosed as X-ray contrast agents (U.S. 5,804,161, PCT WO91/14460, *and PCT WO 92/17215).<br>
MRI contrast agents of the present invention are comprised of one or more vitronectin receptor targeting 25  moieties..attachedjto one or more paramagnetic metal ions, further comprising an optional linking moiety, Ln, between the targeting moieties and the paramagnetic metal ions. The paramagnetic metal ions are present in the form of metal complexes or metal oxide particles. U.S. 30  5,412,148, and 5,760,191, describe examples of chelators for paramagnetic metal ions for use in MRI contrast agents.  US. 5,801,228, U.S. 5,567,411, and U.S. 5,281,704, describe examples of polychelants useful for complexing more than one paramagnetic metal ion for use 35  in MRI contrast agents.

The pharmaceuticals of the present invention can be synthesized by several approaches.  One approach involves the synthesis of the targeting non-peptide moiety, Q, and 20  direct attachment of one or more moieties, Q, to one or more metal chelators or bonding moieties, Ch, or to a paramagnetic metal ion or heavy atom containing solid particle, or to an echogenic gas microbubble. Another approach involves the attachment of one-er more moi-et-ies, 25  Q, to the linking group, Ln, which is then attached to one or more metal chelators or bonding moieties, Ch, or to a paramagnetic metal ion or heavy atom containing solid particle, or to an echogenic gas microbubble. Another approach involves the synthesis of a non-peptide, 30  Q, bearing a fragment of the linking group, Ln, one or more of which are then attached to the remainder of the linking group and then to one or more metal chelators or bonding moieties, C^, or to a paramagnetic metal ion or heavy atom containing solid particle, or to an echogenic 35  gas microbubble.<br>
The non-peptide vitronectin binding moieties, Q, optionally bearing a linking group, Ln, or a fragment of<br><br>
the linking group, can be synthesized using standard synthetic methods known to those skilled in the art. Preferred methods include but are not limited to those methods described below. 5      The attachment of linking groups, Ln, to the non-peptides, Q; chelators or bonding units, Ch, to the non-peptides, Q, or to the linking groups, Ln; and non-peptides, bearing a fragment of the linking group to the remainder of the linking group, in combination forming 10  the moiety, (O)d-Ln' and then to the moiety Ch; can all be performed by standard techniques.  These include, but are not limited to, amidation, esterification, alkylation, and the formation of ureas or thioureas.  Procedures for performing these attachments can be found in Brinkley, 15  M., Bioconjugate Chemistry  1992, 3(1),   which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A number of methods can be used to attach the non-peptides, Q, to paramagnetic metal ion or heavy atom containing solid particles, X2, by one of skill in the 20  art of the surface modification of solid particles. In general, the targeting moiety Q or the combination (Q)dLn is attached ^o a coupling group that react with a constituent of the surface of the solid particle.  The coupling groups can be any of a number of silanes which 25  react" with "surface"" hydroxy1 groups "on" the" solid particle surface, as described in co-pending United States Patent Application Serial No. 09/356,178, and can also include polyphosphonates, polycarboxylates, polyphosphates or mixtures thereof which couple with the surface of the 30  solid particles, as described in U.S. 5,520,904.<br>
A number of reaction schemes can be used to attach the non-peptides, Q, to the surfactant microsphere, X3. These are illustrated in following reaction schemes where Sf represents a surfactant moiety that forms the 35  surfactant microsphere.<br>
Acylation Reaction:<br><br><br>
Sf-C(=0)-Y+    Q-NH2 or  	&gt;   Sf-C(=0)-NH-Q<br>
Q-OH	or  Sf-C(=0)-0-Q<br>
Y is a leaving group or active ester<br>
5  Disulfide Coupling:<br>
Sf-SH    +   Q-SH     	&gt;   Sf-S-S-Q<br>
Sulfonamide Coupling: 10<br>
Sf-S{=0)2-Y    +    Q-NH2     	&gt;   Sf-S(=0)2-NH-<br>
0<br>
Reductive Amidation: 15<br>
Sf-CHO	+	Q-NH2		&gt;        Sf-NH-Q<br>
In these reaction schemes,  the substituents Sf and 0 can<br>
20  be reversed as well.<br>
The linking group Ln can serve several roles.  First it provides a spacing group between the metal chelator or bonding moiety, C^, the paramagnetic metal ion or heavy atom containing solid particle, X2, and the surfactant<br>
25  microsphere, X3, and the one or more of the non-peptides, Q, so as to minimize the possibility that the moieties Ch-X, Ch-X1, X2, and X3, will interfere with the interaction of the recognition sequences of Q with angiogenic tumor vasculature receptors.  The necessity of<br>
30  incorporating a linking group in a reagent is dependent on the identity of Q, Ch-X, Ch-X1, X2, and X3.  If Ch-X, Ch-X1, X2, and X3, cannot be attached to Q without substantially diminishing its affinity for the receptors, then a linking group is used.  A linking group also<br>
35 provides a means of independently attaching multiple non-peptides, Q, to one group that is attached to Ch-X, Ch-X1, X2, or X3.<br><br><br>
The linking group also provides a means of incorporating a pharmacokinetic modifier into the pharmaceuticals of the present invention.  The pharmacokinetic modifier serves to direct the 5  biodistibution of the injected pharmaceutical other than by the interaction of the targeting moieties, Q,  with the vitronectin receptors expressed in the tumor neovasculature.  A wide variety of functional groups can serve as pharmacokinetic modifiers, including, but not 10  limited to, carbohydrates, polyalkylene glycols, peptides or other polyamino acids, and cyclodextrins.  The modifiers can be used to enhance or decrease hydrophilicity and to enhance or decrease the rate of blood clearance.  The modifiers can also be used to 15  direct the route of elimination of the pharmaceuticals. Preferred pharmacokinetic modifiers are those that result in moderate to fast blood clearance and enhanced renal excretion.<br>
The metal chelator or bonding moiety, Ch, is 20  selected to form stable complexes with the metal ion chosen for the particular application.  Chelators or bonding moieties for diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals are selected to form stable complexes with the radioisotopes that have imageable gamma ray or positron emissions, such 25  as 99mIc, 9STc^_iiixa/_62.Cu, ^i°.Cu, 64Cu, 67£a,- 8Ga_A6Y_ Chelators for technetium, copper and gallium isotopes are selected from diaminedithiols, monoamine-monoamidedithiols, triamide-monothiols, monoamine-diamide-monothiols, diaminedioximes, and 30  hydrazines.  The chelators are generally tetradentate with donor atoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur.  Preferred reagents are comprised of chelators having amine nitrogen and thiol sulfur donor atoms and hydrazine bonding units. The thiol sulfur atoms and the 35  hydrazines may bear a protecting group which can be<br>
displaced either prior to using the reagent to synthesize a radiopharmaceutical or preferably in situ during the synthesis of the radiopharmaceutical.<br><br>
Exemplary thiol protecting groups include those listed in Greene and Wuts, "Protective: Groups in Organic Synthesis" John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1991), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. 5  Any thiol protecting group known in the art can be used. Examples of thiol protecting groups include, but are not limited to, the following: acetamidomethyl. benzamidomethyl, 1-ethoxyethyl, benzoyl, and triphenylmethyl. 10      Exemplary protecting groups for hydrazine bonding units are hydrazones which can be aldehyde or ketone hydrazones having substituents selected from hydrogen, alkyl, aryl and heterocycle.  Particularly preferred hydrazones are described in co-pending U.S.S.N. 15  08/476,296 the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
The hydrazine bonding unit when bound to a metal radionuclide is termed a hydrazido, or diazenido group and serves as the point of attachment of the radionuclide 20  to the remainder of the radiopharmaceutical. A diazenido group can be either terminal (only one atom of the group is bound to^the radionuclide) or chelating.  In order to have a chelating diazenido group at least one other atom of the group must also be bound to the radionuclide.  The 25  atoms bound to the metal are termed donor atoms.<br>
Chelators for inIn and 86Y are selected from cyclic and acyclic polyaminocarboxylates such as DTPA, DOTA, D03A, 2-benzyl-DOTA, alpha-(2-phenethyl)1,4,7,10-tetraazazcyclododecane-l-acetic-4,7,10-30  tris(methylacetic)acid, 2-benzyl-<br>
cyclohexyldiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 2-benzyl-6-methyl-DTPA, and 6,6"-bis[N,N,N*,N"-tetra(carboxymethyl)aminomethyl)-4'-(3-amino-4-methoxyphenyl)-2,2':6',2"-terpyridine.  Procedures for 35  synthesizing these chelators that are not commercially available can be found in Brechbiel, M. and Gansow, 0., J.   Chem.   Soc.   Perkin Trans.   1992,   1,   1175; Brechbiel, M. and Gansow, O., Bioconjugate Chem.   1991, 2,   187; Deshpande, S., et. al. , J. Nucl.  Med.   1990, 31,   473;<br><br><br>

The coordination sphere of metal ion includes all 5  the ligands or groups bound to the metal. For a<br>
transition metal radionuclide to be stable it typically has a coordination number (number of donor atoms) comprised of an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 8; that is there are 4 to 8 atoms 10  bound to the metal and it is said to have a complete<br>
coordination sphere.  The requisite coordination number for a stable radionuclide complex is determined by the identity of the radionuclide, its oxidation state, and the type of donor atoms.  If the chelator or bonding unit 15  does not provide all of the atoms necessary to stabilize the metal radionuclide by completing its coordination sphere, the coordination sphere is completed by donor atoms from other ligands, termed ancillary or co-ligands, which can also be either terminal or chelating. 20      A large number of ligands can serve as ancillary or co-ligands, the choice of which is determined by a variety of considerations such as the ease of synthesis of the radiopharmaceutical, the chemical and physical properties of the ancillary ligand, the rate of<br>
2^  formation,	the yield, and the number of_isomeric..Jroxms of<br>
the resulting radiopharmaceuticals, the ability to administer said ancillary or co-ligand to a patient without adverse physiological consequences to said patient, and the compatibility of the ligand in a 30  lyophil-ized kit formulation. The charge and<br>
lipophilicity of the ancillary ligand will effect the charge and lipophilicity of the radiopharmaceuticals. For example, the use of 4,5-dihydroxy-l,3-benzene disulfonate results in radiopharmaceuticals with an 35  additional two anionic groups because the sulfonate groups will be anionic under physiological conditions. The use of N-alkyl substituted 3,4-hydroxypyridinones results in radiopharmaceuticals with varying degrees of<br><br><br>
lipophilicity depending on the size of the alkyl substituents.<br>
Preferred technetium radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention are comprised of a hydrazido or 5  diazenido bonding unit and an ancillary ligand, ALI, or a bonding unit and two types of ancillary ALI and AL2&gt; or a tetradentate chelator comprised of two nitrogen and two sulfur atoms.  Ancillary ligands ALI are comprised of two or more hard donor atoms such as oxygen and amine 10  nitrogen (sp3 hybridized).  The donor atoms occupy at<br>
least two of the sites in the coordination sphere of the radionuclide metal; the ancillary ligand ALI serves as one of the three ligands in the ternary ligand system. Examples of ancillary ligands ALI include but are not 15  limited to dioxygen ligands and functionalized<br>

The technetium and rhenium radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention comprised of a hydrazido or diazenido bonding unit can be easily prepared by admixing 30  a salt of a radionuclide, a reagent of the present<br>
invention, an ancillary ligand A^i, an ancillary ligand AL2» and a reducing agent, in an aqueous solution at temperatures from 0 to 100 °C.

invention, and a reducing agent, in an aqueous solution at temperatures from 0 to 100 °C.<br>
When the bonding unit in the reagent of the present invention is present as a hydrazone group, then it must 5  first be converted to a hydrazine, which may or may not be protonated, prior to complexation with the metal radionuclide.  The conversion of the hydrazone group to the hydrazine can occur either prior to reaction with the radionuclide, in which case the radionuclide and the 10  ancillary or cc-ligand or ligands are combined not with the reagent but with a hydrolyzed form of the reagent bearing the chelator or bonding unit, or in the presence of the radionuclide in which case the reagent itself is combined with the radionuclide and the ancillary or 15  co-ligand or ligands.  In the latter case, the pH of the reaction mixture must be neutral or acidic.<br>
Alternatively, the radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention comprised of a hydrazido or diazenido bonding unit can be prepared by first admixing a salt of 20  a radionuclide, an ancillary ligand ALI, and a reducing agent in an aqueous solution at temperatures from 0 to 100 °C to form an intermediate radionuclide complex with the ancillary ligand ALI then adding a reagent of the present invention and an ancillary ligand AL2 and reacting 25  further at temperatures from 0 to 100 °C.<br>

The amount of the reagent of the present invention used to prepare the technetium and rhenium radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention can range from 0.01 ug to 10 mg, or more preferably from 0.5 ug to 10  200 ug.  The amount used will be dictated by the amounts of the other reactants and the identity of the radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention to be prepared.<br>
The amounts of the ancillary ligands ALI used can 15  range from 0.1 mg to 1 g, or more preferably from 1 mg to 100 mg.  The exact amount for a particular radiopharmaceutical is a function of identity of the radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention to be prepared, the procedure used and the amounts and 20  identities of the other reactants.  Too large an amount of ALI will result in the formation of by-products comprised o^technetium labeled ALI without a biologically active molecule or by-products comprised of technetium labeled biologically active molecules with the ancillary 25  ligand ALI but without the ancillary ligand AL2 •  Too small an amount of ALI will result in other by-products such as technetium labeled biologically active molecules with the ancillary ligand AL2 but without the ancillary ligand ALi, or reduced hydrolyzed technetium, or 30  technetium colloid.<br>
The amounts of the ancillary ligands AL2 used can range from 0.001 mg to 1 g, or more preferably from 0.01 mg to 10 mg.

Too large an amount of AL2 will result in the formation of by-products<br><br><br>
comprised of technetium labeled AL2 without a biologically active molecule or by-products comprised of technetium labeled biologically active molecules with the ancillary ligand AL2 but without the ancillary ligand ALI .  If the 5  reagent bears one or more substituents that are comprised of a soft donor atom, as defined above, at least a ten-fold molar excess of the ancillary ligand AL2 to the reagent of formula 2 is required to prevent the substituent from interfering with the coordination of the 10  ancillary ligand AL2 to the metal radionuclide.<br>
Suitable reducing agents for the synthesis of the radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention include stannous salts, dithionite or bisulfite salts, borohydride salts, and formamidinesulfinic acid, wherein 15  the salts are of any pharmaceutical^ acceptable form.

The specific structure of a radiopharmaceutical of 20  the present invention comprised of a hydrazido or<br>
diazenido bonding unit will depend on the identity of the reagent of tne present invention used, the identity of any ancillary ligand ALI, the identity of any ancillary ligand AL2- and the identity of the radionuclide. 25  Radiopharmaceuticals comprised of a hydrazido or<br>
diazenido bonding unit synthesized using concentrations of reagents of 1 mg/mL concentrations will be comprised of two hydrazido 30  or diazenido groups from two reagent molecules.

biologically active molecule, will have to be diluted or purified after synthesis to avoid such side-effects.<br>
The identities and amounts used of the ancillary ligands ALI and AL2 will determine the values of the 5  variables y and z.  The values of y and z can<br>
independently be an integer from 1 to 2 .     In combination, the values of y and z will result in a technetium coordination sphere that is made up of at least five and no more than seven donor atoms.  For monodentate 10  ancillary ligands hu2-   2 can be an integer from 1 to 2;<br>
for bidentate or tridentate ancillary ligands &amp;U2,   z  is 1. The preferred combination for monodentate ligands is y equal to 1 or 2 and z equal to 1.  The preferred combination for bidentate or tridentate ligands is y 15  equal to 1 and z equal to 1.<br>

Utility<br>
The pharmaceuticals of the present invention are useful for imaging angiogenic tumor vasculature, therapeutic cardiovascular angiogenesis, and cardiac 5  pathologies associated with the expression of vitronectin receptors in a patient or for treating cancer in a patient.  The radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention comprised of a gamma ray or positron emitting isotope are useful for imaging of pathological processes 10  involving angiogenic neovasculature, including cancer,<br>
diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, restenosis of blood vessels after angioplasty, and wound healing, as well as atherosclerotic plague, myocardial reperfusion injury, and myocardial ischemia, stunning or infarction. 15  The radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention<br>
comprised of a beta, alpha or Auger electron emitting isotope are useful for treatment of pathological processes involving angiogenic neovasculature, by delivering a cytotoxic dose of radiation to the locus of 20  the angiogenic neovasculature.  The treatment of cancer is affected by the systemic administration of the radiopharmaceuticals resulting in a cytotoxic radiation dose to tumors.<br>
The compounds of the present invention comprised of 25  one or more paramagnetic metal ions selected from<br>
gadolinium, dysprosium, iron, and manganese, are useful as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of pathological processes involving angiogenic neovasculature,  as well as atherosclerotic plaque, 30  myocardial reperfusion injury, and myocardial ischemia, stunning or infarction.<br>
The compounds of the present invention comprised of one or more heavy atoms with atomic number of 20 or greater are useful as X-ray contrast agents for X-ray 35  imaging of pathological processes involving angiogenic neovasculature,  as well as atherosclerotic plaque, myocardial reperfusion injury, and myocardial ischemia, stunning or infarction.<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention comprised of an echogenic gas containing surfactant microsphere are useful as ultrasound contrast agents for sonography of pathological processes involving angiogenic 5  neovasculature,  as well as atherosclerotic plaque,<br>
myocardial reperfusion injury, and myocardial ischemia, stunning or infarction.<br>
Representative compounds of the present invention 10  were tested in the following in vitro assays and in vivo models and were found to be active.<br>
Immobilized Human Placental avb3 Receptor Assay<br>
The assay conditions were developed and validated<br>
15  using [1-125]vitronectin.  Assay validation included Scatchard format analysis (n=3) where receptor number (Bmax) and Kd (affinity) were determined.  Assay format is such that compounds are preliminarily screened at 10 and 100 nM final concentrations prior to IC50<br>
20  determination.  Three standards (vitronectin, anti-avB3 antibody, LM609, and anti-avB5, P1F6) and five reference peptides have been evaluated for IC50 determination. Briefly, the method involves immobilizing previously isolated receptors in 9 6 well plates and incubating<br>
25  overnight.  The receptors were isolated from normal,<br>
fresh, non-infectious (HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis, and HTLV free) human placenta.  The tissue was lysed and tissue debris removed via centrifugation.  The lysate was filtered.  The receptors were isolated by affinity<br>
30  chromatography using the immobilized avb3 antibody. The plates are then washed 3x with wash buffer.  Blocking buffer is added and plates incubated for 120 minutes at room temperature.  During this time compounds to be tested and [1-125]vitronectin are premixed in a reservoir<br>
35 plate. Blocking buffer is removed and compound mixture pipetted. Competition is carried out for 60 minutes at room temperature. Unbound material is then removed and wells are separated and counted via gamma scintillation.<br><br><br>
ray contrast agents.  After administration of the appropriate amount of the X-ray absorbing compounds, the whole animal can be placed in a commercially available X-ray imager to image the tumors.  The effectiveness of the 5  contrast agents can be readily seen by comparison to the images obtain from animals that are not administered a contrast agent.<br>
This model can also be used to assess the compounds of the present invention comprised of an echogenic gas<br>
10  containing surfactant microsphere as ultrasound contrast agents.  kitex adrriiTiist.rat.iov, ot ^VYS appropriate S^CAITA: of the echogenic compounds, the tumors in the animal can be imaging using an ultrasound probe held proximate to the tumors.  The effectiveness of the contrast agents can<br>
15  be readily seen by comparison to the images obtain from animals that are not administered a contrast agent.<br>
Rabbit Matrigel Model<br>
This model was adapted from a matrigel model<br>
20  intended for the study of angiogenesis in mice.  Matrigel (Becton &amp; Dickinson, USA) is a basement membrane rich in laminin, collagen IV, entactin, HSPG and other growth factors.  When combined with growth factors such as bFGF [500 ng/ml] or VEGF [2 ug/ml] and injected subcutaneously<br>
25  into the mid-abdominal region of the mice, it solidifies into a gel and stimulates angiogenesis at the site of injection within 4-8 days.  In the rabbit model, New Zealand White rabbits (2.5-3.0 kg) are injected with 2.0 ml of matrigel, plus 1 ug bFGF and 4 ug VEGF.  The<br>
30  radiopharmaceutical is then injected 7 days later and the images obtained.<br>
This model can also be used to assess the effectiveness of the radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention comprised of a beta, alpha or Auger electron<br>
35  emitting isotope.  The radiopharmaceuticals are<br>
administered in appropriate amounts and the uptake at the angiogenic sites can be quantified either non-invasively by iwagiivg tor those isotopes ^itft a coincident, imageable gamma emission, or by excision of the angiogenic sites<br><br><br>
and counting the amount of radioactivity present by standard techniques. The therapeutic effect of the radiopharmaceuticals can be assessed by monitoring the rate of growth of the angiogenic sites in control rabbits 5  versus those in the rabbits administered the radiopharmaceuticals of the present invention.<br>
This model can also be used to assess the compounds of the present invention comprised of paramagnetic metals as MRI contrast agents.  After administration of the 10  appropriate amount of the paramagnetic compounds, the whole animal can be placed in a commercially available magnetic resonance imager to image the angiogenic sites. The effectiveness of the contrast agents can be readily seen by comparison to the images obtain from animals that 15  are not administered a contrast agent.<br>
This model can also be used to assess the compounds of the present invention comprised of heavy atoms as X-ray contrast agents.  After administration of the appropriate amount of the X-ray absorbing compounds, the 20  whole animal can be placed in a commercially available X-ray imager to image the angiogenic sites.  The effectiveness of the contrast agents can be readily seen by comparison to the images obtain from animals that are not administered a contrast agent. 25      This model can also be used to assess the compounds of the present invention comprised of an echogenic gas containing surfactant microsphere as ultrasound contrast agents.  After administration of the appropriate amount of the echogenic compounds, the angiogenic sites in the 30  animal can be imaging using an ultrasound probe held proximate to the tumors.  The effectiveness of the contrast agents can be readily seen by comparison to the images obtain from animals that are not administered a contrast agent. 35<br>
Canine Spontaneous Tumor Model<br>
Adult dogs with spontaneous mammary tumors were sedated with xylazine (20 mg/kg)/atropine (1 ml/kg) . Upon sedation the animals were intubated using ketamine<br><br><br>
(5 mg/kg)/diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) for full anethesia. Chemical restraint was continued with ketamine (3 mg/kg)/xylazine (6 mg/kg) titrating as necessary.  If required the animals were ventilated with room air via an 5  endotrachael tube (12 strokes/min, 25 ml/kg) during the study.  Peripheral veins were catheterized using 20G I.V. catheters, one to serve as an infusion port for compound while the other for exfusion of blood samples.  Heart rate and EKG were monitored using a cardiotachometer 10  (Biotech, Grass Quincy, MA) triggered from a lead II<br>
electrocardiogram generated by limb leads.  Blood samples are generally taken at -10 minutes (control), end of infusion, (1 minute), 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, and 120 min for whole blood cell number and counting. 15  Radiopharmaceutical dose was 300 uCi/kg adminitered as an i.v. bolus with saline flush.  Parameters were monitored continuously on a polygraph recorder (Model 7E Grass) at a paper speed of 10 mm/min or 10 mm/sec.<br>
Imaging of the laterals were for 2 hours with a 20  2 56x256 matrix, no zoom, 5 minute dynamic images.  A<br>
known source is placed in the image field (20-90 uCi) to evaluate region of interest (ROD uptake.  Images were also acquired 24 hours post injection to determine retention of the compound in the tumor.  The uptake is 25  determined by taking the fraction of the total counts in an inscribed area for ROI/source and multiplying the known uCi.  The result is uCi for the ROI.<br>
This model can also be used to assess the effectiveness of the radiopharmaceuticals of the present 30  invention comprised of a beta, alpha or Auger electron emitting isotope.  The radiopharmaceuticals are administered in appropriate amounts and the uptake in the tumors can be quantified either non-invasively by imaging for those isotopes with a coincident imageable gamma 35  emission, or by excision of the tumors and counting the amount of radioactivity present by standard techniques. The therapeutic effect of the radiopharmaceuticals can be assessed by monitoring the size of the tumors over time. This model can also be used to assess the compounds<br><br>
of the present invention comprised of paramagnetic metals as MRI contrast agents. After administration of the appropriate amount of the paramagnetic compounds, the whole animal can be placed in a commercially available 5  magnetic resonance imager to image the tumors.  The<br>
effectiveness of the contrast agents can be readily seen by comparison to the images obtain from animals that are not administered a contrast agent.<br>
This model can also be used to assess the compounds<br>
10  of the present invention comprised of heavy atoms as X-ray contrast agents.  After administration of the appropriate amount of the X-ray absorbing compounds, the whole animal can be placed in a commercially available X-ray imager to image the tumors.  The effectiveness of the<br>
15  contrast agents can be readily seen by comparison to the images obtain from animals that are not administered a contrast agent.<br>
This model can also be used to assess the compounds of the present invention comprised of an echogenic gas<br>
20  containing surfactant microsphere as ultrasound contrast agents.  After administration of the appropriate amount of the echogenic compounds, the tumors in the animal can be imaging using an ultrasound probe held proximate to the tumors.  The effectiveness of the contrast agents can<br>
