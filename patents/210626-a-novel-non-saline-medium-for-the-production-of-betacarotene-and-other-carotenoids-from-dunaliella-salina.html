JP Patent 5,605,1980 describes the invention to cultivate Dunaliella in extremely high productivity, by cultivating Dunaliella in a culture solution of Chlorella extract with hot water is added, having reduced NaCl, feeding CO2 gas to the culture solution. The culture solution is adjusted to have an NaCl concentration of 0.5-3wt%.<br>
The media used in the conventional process and novel process of cultivation is different. For example in the conventional process, sodium chloride is used as a medium whereas in this invention the media does not comprised of NaCl but only magnesium sulphate is used.<br>
Over the prior development the present invention is done for the cultivation of Dunaliella salina and production<br><br>
of  carotenes   using   magnesium   sulphate   in   the   culture medium as the sole source of osmotic balance.<br>
The culture media for the cultivation of Dunaliella salina in the said invention is comprised of carbonates, sulphates, potassium, phosphates, and nitrates with trace elements. Prior to preparing the media to support growth of Dunaliella salina magnesium sulphate as hepta hydrate form is added at the concentration from 3M to 10 M preferably 8 M.<br>
A culture media comprises of Ca2+ 0.01- 20mM preferably 0.02mM, iron sources such as Fe EDTA 0.5 -4.5|iM preferably 2µM, NO+ 0.05 - 1 mM preferably 0.08 mM, phosphate 0.01 - 1 mM preferably 0.4 mM and carbonates as HCO3 0.001 - 0.05 M preferably 0,006 M.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In the said invention a culture media for the growth of Dunaliella salina and production of carotenoids is developed   using   only   Magnesium   sulphate.   The   algae<br><br>
Dunaliella salina is grown in this media to produce Betacarotene, its isomers and other carotenoids. The residue thus obtained after extraction of the said carotenes has high protein content and used as feed supplement for animal feed and for other similar purposes.<br>
It is the primary object of the invention to develop a medium for cultivation of Dunaliella salina for the production of Betacarotene, its isomers and other carotenoids.<br>
Further object of the invention will be clear from the ensuing description.<br>
The present invention provides a process for the cultivation of Dunaliella salina, which belongs to the Class of Chlorophyceae, Order of Volvocales.<br>
It is an embodiment of the invention that this invention leads to contrivance of medium for the cultivation of Dunaliella salina in open ponds especially exposed to<br><br>
sunlight. The osmolarity is contributed only by magnesium sulphate.<br>
It is another embodiment of the invention that this medium for the cultivation of Dunaliella salina in open ponds essentially exposed to sunlight wherein the optimum amount of magnesium sulphate is preferably in the range of 8M.<br>
It is another embodiment of the invention that this medium for the cultivation of Dunaliella salina in open ponds especially exposed essentially to sunlight wherein a medium for cultivation of Dunaliella salina the said medium comprising an artificial sea water having the following ingredients in proportionate concentrations are -MgS04 3-lOM preferably 8M, Ca2+ 0.01- 20mM preferably 0.02mM, iron sources such as Fe EDTA 0.5 - 4.5µM preferably 2µM, NO3 0.05 - 1 mM preferably 0.08 mM, phosphate 0.01 - 1 mM preferably 0.4 mM carbonates as HCO3 0.001 - 0.05 M preferably 0.006 M.<br><br>
It is another embodiment of the invention that this medium for the cultivation of Dunaliella salina in open ponds exposed to sunlight wherein this media initiates betacarotene synthesis in Dunaliella salina to generate mixed carotenoids in particular Betacarotene and its isomers having a concentration 6-8% on dry weight basis.<br>
The algae used in the process for the cultivation in the present invention are unicellular motile cells. The cells are broadly ovoid or ellipsoid in shape with a fine elastic periplast but with no rigid cell wall and has two flagella of 1.5 to 2 times the length of the cell emerge from one edge of the long cell axis, one large chloroplast occupies about half the cell volume and is often arranged in a cup-shape around the nucleus. A single median pyrenoid is embedded in the basal portion of the chloroplast and surrounded by starch granules. These cells reproduce vegetatively by longitudinal division of the motile cells. After extensive experiments, optimum conditions of cultivation have been defined. This results in the desired production of large quantities of carotene, providing as by-product a substance<br><br>
having a high protein content, which can be utilized for various purposes.<br>
When grown outdoors under suitable illumination, the cells are bright orange and have a high carotene content, which can reach values as high as 60 to 80 mg per gram of dry weight of algae. The alga is cultivated under an adequate high intensity of illumination and so it is the best to carry out cultivation outdoors in sunlight.<br>
A culture medium comprises the following nutrients. MgS04 3-lOM preferably 8M. The other ingredients comprise; Ca2+ 0.01-20mM preferably 0.02mM, iron sources such as Fe EDTA 0.5-4.5µM preferably 2µM, NO3-0.05 - 1 mM preferably 0.08 mM and phosphate 0.01 -ImM preferably 0,4 mM, carbonates as UCOz' 0.001 - 0.05 M preferably 0.006 M.<br>
A suitable source of carbon, such as HCO3- or CO2 in growth culture medium is provided. The optimum pH for cultivation is between?.5 and 8.5 and this is advantageously adjusted by adding required quantities of CO2 through a pH<br><br>
controlled   solenoid  valve.   The   optimum  temperature   of cultivation is in the range of about 32-45 ° C.<br>
In order to obtain a high content of carotenoids, it is necessary to provide adequate intensity of illumination. Thus cultivation is done in open environment under sunlight with less (lower than normal) concentration of NOs" for better productivity of carotenoids. Since the cultivation is done outdoors, the diurnal cycle is provided naturally.<br>
The media used in the conventional cultivation process and novel cultivation process is different. For example in the conventional process sodium chloride is used as a medium whereas in this media only magnesium sulphate is used.<br>
EXAMPLE:<br>
Cultivation of Dunaliella salina ARL 5 for Carotene<br>
