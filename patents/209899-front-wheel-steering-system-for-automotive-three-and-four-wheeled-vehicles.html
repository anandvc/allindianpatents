COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"FRONT WHEEL STEERING SYSTEKfFOR AUTOMOTIVE THREE-AND FOUR-WHEELED VEHICLES"<br><br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan,<br>
having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku,<br>
*J	Tokyo, Japan,<br>
o<br>
O<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
[0002]<br>
[Description of the Related Art]<br>
The automotive three-wheeled vehicles or four-wheeled vehicles has a front wheel steering system in which the proportion of the steered angle of the front wheel is variable with respect to the steering angle of the steering handle. One of the known front wheel steering systems of this type is, for example, "RUDDER ANGLE RATIO VARYING APPARATUS" presented in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 0115442/1994 (hereinafter referred to as a related art).<br>
[0003]<br>
The related art described above is, as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 in the same publication, constructed in such a manner that by steering the steering wheel 4 (the reference numbers cited here are the same as those stated in the publication), the steering force is transmitted to the steering wheel 3 0 through the route of the steering shaft 3, the ball screw mechanism 12, the conversion nut member 7, the arm 17, the lever member 16, the cylindrical portion 19, the shaft portion 18, the first gear 21, the second gear 26, the pinion 27, the rack gear 29, the rack shaft 28, the tie rod, and the knuckle arm to rotate the steered wheel 30.<br>
[0004]<br>
In the related art described above, as shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 9, the first gear 21 and the second gear 26 are elliptic<br>
2<br><br>
ge^rs. The steering angle ratio varying means comprising such first and second gears 21, 26 has a non-linear steering angle ratio property in which the steered angle of the steered wheel 30 is small in the region where the steering angle of the steering wheel 4 is small, and the steered angle increases with the steering angle.<br>
[0005]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the related art described above, the first and second gears 21, 26 constituting steering angle ratio varying means are elliptic gears having a complex configuration, which may increase the cost. In addition, in order to ensure further stable operation of the steering angle ratio varying means, preferably, the steering angle ratio varying means is stored in the case 1. The case 1 is contemplated to ensure the sealing property at the input and output portions thereof. Thereby, employment of elliptic gear may cause increase in the cost of the steering angle ratio varying apparatus.<br>
[0006]<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to simplify the construction of the steering angle ratio varying means to decrease the cost of the front wheel steering system for automotive three- and four-wheeled vehicles.<br>
[0007]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br><br>
In order to achieve the object described above, the present invention claimed in Claim 1 is a front wheel steering system for automotive three- and four-wheeled vehicles having right and left front wheels controlled by a steering shaft rotatably mounted on the head pipe of the vehicle body frame, wherein the steering stem is disposed below the steering shaft at the location offset from the steering shaft, the steering stem is connected to the steering shaft via a link mechanism, the right and left front wheels are connected the steering stem via the right and left tie rods and the right and left knuckle arms, the link mechanism is constructed of an upper link, a lower link, and an universal coupling for coupling the upper link and the lower link, so that the steering shaft is disposed between the steering stem and the universal coupling when the link mechanism is viewed in the axial direction of the steering shaft.<br>
[0008]<br>
When link mechanism is viewed in the axial direction of the steering shaft, when the steering angle of the steering shaft is zero, the center of the steering shaft, the universal coupling, and the center of the steering stem are aligned. When viewed from the side of the vehicle body in the direction at a right angle with this line, the proportion of the distance from the universal coupling to the center of the steering stem with respect to the distance from the center of the steering<br>
4<br><br>
s^ft to the universal coupling varies in accordance with the steering angle of the steering shaft. Consequently, the proportion of the steered angle of the front wheel with respect to the steering angle of the steering shaft (steering angle ratio) varies in accordance to the"steering angle of the steering shaft. In this way, the link mechanism has a function to vary the steering angle ratio, so called a steering angle ratio varying function. Since the mechanism performing the steering angle ratio varying action is a link mechanism, the extremely simple construction may be achieved.<br>

In such a front wheel steering system 50, the steering stem 54 is disposed at the location offset rearward from the steering shaft 51, and the steering shaft 51 is disposed between the steering stem 54 and the universal coupling 59 when the link mechanism 53 is viewed in the direction of the axis of the steering shaft, or in the direction shown by the arrow LO.<br>
[0020]<br>
The steering support 33 is formed of a through hole 33a that extends in the vertical direction therethrough for allowing the steering stem 54 to pass.<br>
The front frame 30 is constructed in such a manner that the top plate 61 and the bottom plate 63 are mounted on top and at the bottom of the steering support 33. The top plate 61 comprises a first bearing 62, and the bottom plate 63 comprises a second bearing 64. The front frame 30 of such a construction can support the steering stem 54 via the first and the second bearings 62, 64 so as to be capable of rotation<br><br><br>
b^t not axial movement.<br>
[0021]<br>
Fig. 4 is a plan view of the principal portion of the automotive four-wheeled vehicle according to the present invention showing an automotive four-wheeled vehicle 10 comprising two right and left front wheels 48, 48 and two right and left rear wheels 92, 92. In order to facilitate comprehension of the description, the seat 101 and the roof 106 shown in Fig. 1, and the front frame 30 shown in Fig. 3 are not shown.<br>
The front wheel suspension 40 is constructed in such a manner that the wheel shaft holder blocks 46, 46 are mounted to the tip portions of the right and left swing arms 42, 42 by means of king pins 45, 45 so as to be capable of rightward and leftward swinging motion, and the front wheels 48, 48 are mounted to the wheel shaft holder blocks 46, 4 6 by means of wheel shafts 47, 47 so as to be capable of rotation.<br>
[0022]<br>
Incidentally, the steering system of the automotive four-wheeled vehicle 10 is, for example, an Ackerman steering (Ackerman link mechanism).<br>
More specifically, the front wheel steering system 50 is constructed in such a manner that the left and right tie rods 66, 66 are connected to the lower end of the steering stem 54 via the rod connecting portion 65, and the knuckle arms 46a,<br>
14<br><br>
46^ of the vehicle shaft holder blocks 46, 46 are connected to the tip of the tie rods 66, 66.<br>
[0023]<br>
Fig. 5 is a perspective view of the principal portion of the front portion of the automotive four-wheeled vehicle according to the present invention showing a front wheel suspension 40 and a front wheel steering system 50.<br>
The steering handle 67 mounted to the upper end of the steering shaft 51 is a bar handle. By steering the steering handle 67, the front wheels 48, 48 can be rotated via the steering shaft 51, the link mechanism 53, and the steering stem 54.<br>
[0024]<br>
Fig. 6(a) and (b) are block- and operation diagrams of the front wheel steering system according to the present invention, (a) is a left side view showing the portion around the link mechanism 53 in the front wheel steering system 50. The front wheel steering system 50 takes the following (1) to (3) positioning when viewed in the direction of the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51, or in the direction of the arrow b.<br>
(1)	the center Bl of the universal coupling 59 is disposed at the position offset frontward by the amount SI with respect to the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51.<br>
(2)	the center CI of the second connecting pin 57 is disposed<br><br>
a^the position offset rearward by the amount S2 with respect to the center Bl of the universal coupling 59. The center CI passes through the centerline of the steering stem 54. Therefore, CI is also the centerline of the steering stem 54.<br>
(3)	the center Dl of the first connecting pin 55 is disposed at the position offset frontward by the amount S3 with respect to the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51.<br>
(4)	the relation among the respective offset amounts SI, S2 and S3 are such that the offset amount S3 is set to the value larger than the offset amount SI, and the offset amount S2 is set to the value larger than the offset amount S3 (SKS3<s2></s2>
[0025]<br>
In addition, the front wheel steering system 50 is constructed in such a manner that, as shown in (a), the center Dl of the first connecting pin 55 is disposed below the steering shaft 51, the center CI of the second connecting pin 57 is disposed below the center Dl, and the center Bl of the universal coupling 59 is disposed below the center CI.<br>
The centerline CI of the steering stem 54 is not in parallel with the centerline Al. In other words, the steering stem 54 extends from the center CI of the second connecting pin 57 toward the lower front, and simultaneously inclines slightly in the direction away backward from the centerline Al correspondingly.<br>
[0026]<br>
17<br><br>
^m (b) is a pattern diagram of the link mechanism 53 shown in (a) when viewed in the direction shown by the arrow b. In Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 that will be described later, the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51 shown in the above described (a) is referred to as "point Al", the center Bl of the universal coupling 59 is referred to as "point Bl", the center CI of the second connecting pin 57 is referred to as "point CI", and the center Dl of the first connecting pin 55 is referred to as "point Dl".<br>
(b) shows that when the steering angle of the steering shaft 51 is zero, or in the neutral state, the point Al, the point Bl, the point Cl and the point Dl align on the center CL of the vehicle body.<br>
[0027]<br>
The general operation of the front wheel steering system 50 will be described. When the upper link 5 6 is turned rightward from the neutral state by the angle of a by means of the steering shaft 51, the point Bl is displaced to the point BR. As a consequent, the lower link 58 and the steering stem<br>
54 is rotated rightward about the point Cl by the angle of p. While when the upper link 5 6 is turned leftward by the angle of a, the point Bl is displaced to the point BL. The lower link 58 and the steering stem 54 turn leftward about the point<br>
Cl by the angle of |3. The angle |3 is smaller than the angle a (a&gt;|3).<br>
17<br><br>
^ The precise and detailed operation of the front wheel steering system 50 will be described in conjunction with Fig. 7 below.<br>
[0028]<br>
Fig. 7(a), (b) are operation drawings (part 1) of the front wheel steering system according to the present invention, wherein (a) is a side view showing around the link mechanism 53, and (b) is a plan view of (a) when viewed in the direction of the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51.<br>
When the steering angle of the steering shaft 51 is zero, or in the neutral state, the point Al, the point Bl, the point CI, and the point Dl aligns on the center CL of the vehicle body shown in (b) (on the line passing through the angle 0°and 180°) .<br>
[0029]<br>
When the steering shaft 51 is turned clockwise in the figure from this neutral position, the center of the first connecting pin 55 moves along the swinging track Rl about the point Al from the point Dl through the point D2, the point D3, and the point D4 to the point D5. Simultaneously, the center of the universal coupling 59 moves along the swinging track R 2 from the point Bl through the point B2, the point B3, and the point B4 to the point B5. In other words, when the center of the first connecting pin 55 is displaced from the point Dl to the point D2, the center of the universal coupling 59 is<br>
18<br><br>
displaced from the point Bl to the point B2, and likewise, when the former is displaced to the point D3, the latter is displaced to the point B3, when the former is displaced to the point D4, the latter is displaced to the point B4, and when the former is displaced to the point D5, the latter is displaced to the point B5.<br>
[0030]<br>
For example, the upper link 56 is turned (steered)<br>
clockwise in the figure from 0° by the angle of a by means of the steering shaft 51, the center of the first connecting pin 55 is displaced from the point Dl to the point D3. Simultaneously, the center of the universal coupling 59 is displaced from the point Bl to the point B3. As a consequence, the lower link 58 turns (rotates) together with the steering stem 54 by the angle of (3 corresponding to the displacement from the point Bl to the point B3. The angle a is a steering angle of the steering shaft 51 and the angle p is an angle of rotation of the steering stem 54.<br>
Further, when the steering angle of the steering shaft 51 is 180°, the angle of rotation of the steering stem 54 is<br>
also 180°.<br>
[0031]<br>
Since the steering shaft 51 is disposed between the steering stem 54 and the universal coupling 59, the angle of rotation (3 is smaller than the steering angle a (a&gt;|3).<br><br>
jA: Therefore, the steering force applied by the steering shaft 51 is smaller than the case where the point Al coincides with the point CI.<br>
The proportion of the angle of rotation |3 with respect to the steering angle a, or the steering angle ratio, varies with the proportion X of the offset amount S2 (steering link ratio X) with respect to the offset amount SI shown in Fig. 6.<br>
[0032]<br>
As is already apparent, the respective swinging tracks Rl, R2 shown in the figure (a) by the thick lines represent the projection of the swinging tracks Rl, R2 shown in (b) respectively. In other words, when the front wheel steering system 50 is viewed from the side as in (a), the center of the universal coupling 59 is displaced along the swinging track R2 in accordance with the variation of the steering angle.<br>
When the steering angle is 0°, the center of the universal coupling 59 resides the position of the point Bl on the swinging track R2 in (a). The offset amount of the center of the universal coupling 59 with respect to the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51 at this time is the maximum value SI (See Fig. 6). Subsequently, the offset amount decreases with increase of the steering angle.<br>
[0033]<br>
On the other hand, the offset amount of the center of<br>
20<br><br>
th||universal coupling 59 with respect to the point CI is the<br>
maximum value S2 (See Fig. 6) when the steering angle is 0°. Subsequently, the offset amount decreases with increase of the steering angle. However, since the point CI is arranged behind the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51, the extent of reduction of the offset amount S2 in association with increase of the steering angle is smaller than the extent of reduction of the offset amount SI.<br>
As a result, the proportion of the offset amount S2 with respect to the offset amount SI increases with increase of the steering angle.<br>
[0034]<br>
As is apparent from the description above, in (a), the proportion of the distance from the universal coupling 59 to the center of the steering stem 54 (the above-described offset amount S2) with respect to the distance from the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51 to the universal coupling 59 (the above-described offset amount SI) varies in accordance with the steering angle of the steering shaft 51. As a consequence, the proportion of the steered angle of the front wheel with respect to the steering angle of the steering shaft 51 (steering angle ratio) varies in accordance with the steering angle of the steering shaft 51. IN this way, the link mechanism 53 has a function to vary the steering angle ratio, so called steering angle ratio varying function. Since the mechanism providing<br><br>
a^steering angle ratio varying function is a link mechanism 53, the structure is extremely simple.<br>
[0035]<br>
Fig. 8(a), (b) are operation drawings (part 2) of the front wheel steering system according to the present invention, (a) is a diagrammatic plan view of the front portion of the automotive four-wheeled vehicle showing a state in which the automotive four-wheeled vehicle is in cornering operation. The angle of rotation of the front wheel that comes outside<br>
when cornering (outer wheel) is 9o and the angle of rotation of the front wheel that comes inside when cornering (inner<br>
wheel) is 6i when the steering angle of the bar-type steering handle is a. Since Ackerman steering is employed in the front wheel steering system, the angle of rotation 0o of the outer wheel is smaller than the angle of rotation 9i of the inner wheel (6o
[0036]<br>
(b) is a steering angle ratio characteristic diagram for the front wheel steering system shown in (a), wherein the horizontal axis represents the steering angle a of the steering handle, and the vertical axis represents the angle of rotation<br>
0o of the outer wheel.<br>
In the figure, the thick line with solid dots is a steering angle ratio characteristic curve of the comparative example, which has a general non-linear characteristic when a link<br>
22<br><br>
m^hanism is not provided at the mid section of the steering shaft.<br>
The thin line with hollow dots is a steering angle ratio characteristic curve of the present invention, which has a non-linear characteristic in the case where the steering stem is connected to the steering shaft via a link mechanism. However, the characteristic in the present invention shows the case where the steering link ratio X shown in Fig. 6 above (X=S2/S1) is set to 1.8.<br>
[0037]<br>
The steering angle ratio characteristic curve of the comparative example exhibits an upward sloping convex curve. The curve of the comparative example has a sharp inclination in the range where the steering angle a of the steering handle is approximately not more than 40°, and a slow inclination in the range over 40°.<br>
On the other hand, the steering angle ratio characteristic curve of the present invention exhibits an upward sloping concave curve. The curve of the present invention has a slow inclination (gradual increase) in the range where the steering angle a of the steering handle is approximately not more than 40°, and a sharp inclination in the range over approximately 40°.<br>
[0038]<br>
According to this figure, when the steering angle a<br><br>
ejseeds approximately 52°, the steering angle ratio characteristic curve of the present invention crosses over the steering angle ratio characteristic curve of the comparative example. In other words, the proportion St of the angle of rotation 9o of the outer wheel with respect to the steering angle a of the steering handle (steering angle ratio St) is such that the case of the present invention underruns the case of the comparative example in the range where the steering angle a is approximately not more than 52°, and exceeds in the range over approximately 52°. As a consequence, the angle of rotation 8o of the outer wheel when the steering angle a is not more than approximately 52° is smaller in the case of the present invention than the case of the comparative example. Since the steering angle ratio St is smaller in the present invention, a steering force of the steering handle may be smaller correspondingly.<br>
[0039]<br>
This point will be described more specifically. For example, when the outer wheel is rotated with the angle of rotation of 0o=12°, the angle of rotation a of the comparative example is 22°, while the angle of rotation a of the present invention is 30°, which is larger than the case of the comparative example.  In this way, in the ration where the<br>
steering angle a is not more than approximately 52°, the steering angle a required to rotate the outer wheel with a<br>
24<br><br>
c^tain angle of rotation 60 is larger in the present invention than the comparative example. Therefore, a steering force of the steering handle may be smaller correspondingly in the present invention. Therefore, in the range where the steering<br>
angle a is not more than approximately 52°, a steering force of the steering handle for cornering the automotive four-wheeled vehicle may be reduced.<br>
[0040]<br>
Accordingly, when the steering handle is in about the neutral position, the proportion of the angle of rotation 0o, 6i of the front wheel with respect to the steering angle a of the steering handle, in other word, the response of the handle can be relatively reduced. Accordingly, the sense of steering (feeling of steering) while driving the automotive four-wheeled vehicle straight ahead in the middle- and high-speed range is enhanced, thereby improving maneuverability. In addition, the steering force required to drive the automotive four-wheeled vehicle straight ahead in the middle- and high-speed range may be reduced in comparison with the comparative example.<br>
[0041]<br>
On the other hands, in the range where the steering angle a exceeds approximately 52°, when the steering handle is steered by the steering angle a, the angle of rotation 0o of the outer wheel is larger in the present invention than the<br>
25<br><br>
caae of the comparative example. Therefore, the turning radius of the automotive four-wheeled vehicle can be reduced in the present invention than in the case of the comparative example correspondingly.<br>
[0042]<br>
Employing the bar-type steering handle has the following advantages.<br>
When allowing the automotive four-wheeled vehicle to advance straight ahead in the normal driving in the city, the steering angle a of the bar-type steering handle may be just 0° to 10° to the right and left respectively. In addition, the maximum steering angle a by which the driver generally steers the steering handle (the maximum steering angle) is not more<br>
than 50° to 60° to the right and left respectively. The maximum steering angle is significantly smaller than the case where the handle of steering wheel type is employed.<br>
Therefore, the front wheel steering system of the present invention is specifically effective in the case where the steering handle of a bar-handle type which is used in the range where the maximum steering angle does not exceed 60° to the right and left respectively in terms of feeling of steering.<br>
[0043]<br>
Fig. 9 is a cross-sectional view showing the region around the steering shaft and the adjusting mechanism according to the present invention.<br><br>
The head pipe 23 comprises a through hole 23a in the vertical direction for allowing the steering shaft 51 to pass. The through hole 23a has a relatively large diameter in comparison with the diameter of the steering shaft 51 for enabling the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51 to cross over the centerline El of the head pipe 23 at an arbitrary angle. For example, the through hole 23a is of an elliptic hole elongated in the front and rear direction or of circular form having a larger diameter in comparison with the diameter of the steering shaft 51. The steering shaft 51 and the connecting member 52 are joined by press fitting the steering shaft 51 into the connecting member 52 and welding the lower end portion thereof.<br>
[0044]<br>
The steering adjusting mechanism 7 0 is constructed in such a manner that a top plate 71 and a bottom plate 81 are replaceably mounted on top and at the bottom of the head pipe 23, and a steering shaft 51 is passed through the through hole 71a formed on the top plate 71 and the through hole 81a formed on the bottom plate 81 so as to be capable of rotation. The top plate 71 supports the steering shaft 51 via the first bearing 72 and the locking nut 76. The bottom plate 81 supports the steering shaft 51 via the second bearing 82.<br>
[0045]<br>
More specifically, the top plate 71 comprises a body<br><br>
potion 71b having a through hole 71a, a fitting portion 71c to be fitted into the through hole 23a of the head pipe 23, a flange 71d to be abutted against the top end surface of the head pipe 23, and a positioning groove 71e for positioning by hooking on the projection of the head pipe 23.<br>
The first bearing 72 comprises a outer lace 73 to be fitted in the through hole 71a of the top plate 71, an inner lace 74 to be screwed into the male screw 51a on the steering shaft 51, a number of balls 75...interposed between the outer and inner laces 73 , 74 , and a retainer for retaining the balls 75 . . . which is not shown in the figure. The inner lace 74 also serves as the adjusting nut.<br>
[0046]<br>
The bottom plate 81 comprises a body portion 81b having a thorough hole 81a, a fitting portion 81c to be fitted into the through hole 23a on the head pipe 23, a flange 8Id to be abutted against the lower end surface of the head pipe 23, and a positioning groove 81e for positioning by hooking on the projection of the head pipe 23.<br>
The second bearing 82 comprises an outer lace 83 to be fitted in the through hole 81a of the bottom plate 81, an inner lace 84 to be fitted into the steering shaft 51, a number of balls 85... interposed between the outer and inner laces 83, 84, and a retainer for retaining the balls 85... which is not shown in the figure.<br>
29<br><br>
[0047]<br>
As is apparent from the description above, the steering shaft 51 can be mounted to the head pipe 23 via the top and bottom plates 71, 81 and the first and the second bearing 72, 82 so as to be capable of rotation. The reference numeral 68 is a mounting bolt for mounting the steering handle 67 to the upper end of the steering shaft 51.<br>
[0048]<br>
By the way Fig. 9 shows that the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51 is arranged almost in parallel with, and forward of, the centerline El of the head pipe 23 (center of the through hole 23a) . As a matter of course, the centers of the through holes 71a, 81a of the top and bottom plates 71, 81 to be mounted on top and at the bottom of the head pipe 23 coincide with the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51.<br>
[0049]<br>
Fig. 10 is a drawing showing an example of mounting of the steering shaft according to the present invention (part 1), in which the steering shaft 51 is mounted on the head pipe 23 with the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51 arranged almost in parallel with, and rearward of, the centerline El of the head pipe 23.<br>
The centers of the through holes 71a, 81a of the top and bottom plates 71, 81 to be mounted on top and at the bottom of the head pipe 23 coincide with the centerline Al of the<br><br>
steering shaft 51. By replacing the top and bottom plates 71, 81 shown in Fig. 9 with the top and bottom plates 71, 81 shown in Fig. 10, the position of the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51 changes.<br>
[0050]<br>
Fig. 11 is a drawing showing an example of mounting of the steering shaft according to the present invention (part 2), in which the steering shaft 51 is mounted to the head pipe 23 with the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51 crossed over the centerline El of the head pipe 23 in the forward direction so that the lower end of the steering shaft 51 is placed in front of the centerline El of the head pipe 23.<br>
The centers of the through holes 71a, 81a of the top and bottom plates 71, 81 to be mounted on top and at the bottom of the head pipe 23 coincide with the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51. By replacing the top and bottom plates 71, 81 shown in Fig. 9 with the top and bottom plate 71, 81 shown in Fig. 11, the position of the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51 changes.<br>
[0051]<br>
Fig. 12 is a drawing showing an example of mounting of the steering shaft according to the present invention (part 3), in which the steering shaft 51 is mounted to the head pipe 23 with the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51 crossed over the center line El of the head pipe 23 in the rearward direction<br>
30<br><br>
sOthat the lower end of the steering shaft 51 is placed at the rear the centerline El of the head pipe 23.<br>
The centers of the through holes 71a, 81a of the top and bottom plates 71, 81 to be mounted on top and at the bottom of the head pipe 23 coincide with the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51. By replacing the top and the bottom plates 71, 81 shown in Fig. 9 with the top and bottom plates 71, 81 shown in Fig. 12, the position of the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51 changes.<br>
[0052]<br>
As is apparent from the description above, by replacing a plurality of top plates 71... and a plurality of bottom plates 81..., the position or the angle of the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51 with respect to the centerline El of the head pipe 23 can be changed arbitrarily. By varying the offset amount of the connecting portion 59A with respect to the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51 shown in Fig. 3 described above by changing the position or the angle of the centerline Al, the proportion of the angle of rotation p with respect to the steering angle a may be set to the optimum value.<br>
In this way, the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51 can be set to the arbitrary position or angle by adjusting the steering adjusting mechanism 70 considering the optimal steering characteristics for an automotive four-wheeled vehicle 10.<br>
31<br><br>
In the embodiment of the present invention described above, the following modification may also be applied.<br>
(1)	The front wheel steering system 50 it not limited<br>
to the front wheel steering system for automotive four-wheeled<br>
vehicles 10, but may be for the automotive three-wheeled<br>
vehicles in which the right and left front wheels are steered.<br>
The front wheel steering system in such a case makes the same<br>
action as the front wheel steering system 50.<br>
(2)	The steering handle 67 is not limited to a bar handle, but may be a steering wheel.<br>
(3)	The steering stem 54 may be disposed in parallel with the steering shaft 51.<br>
[0054]<br>
(4)	The steering shaft 51 must simply be disposed<br>
between the steering stem 54 and the universal coupling 5 9 when<br>
the link mechanism 53 is viewed in the direction of the axis<br>
of the steering shaft as shown in Fig. 6. Therefore, in<br>
addition to the case where the universal coupling 59 is disposed<br>
in front of the steering stem 54, the universal coupling 59<br>
may be disposed behind, on the left, or on the right of the<br>
steering stem 54 and the steering shaft 51 is disposed between<br>
the steering stem54 and the universal coupling 59. The setting<br>
of the offset amount SI to S3 is arbitrary.<br>
[0055]<br>
(5)	As shown in Fig. 6, the link mechanism 53 must simply<br><br>
b||a link in generally angular C-shape defined by the line combining the point Dl and the point Bl, and the line combining the point Bl and the point Cl. for example, the center Dl of the first connecting pin 55 may be coincided with the centerline Al of the steering shaft 51. The center Bl of the universal coupling 59 may be disposed below the center Dl of the first connecting pin 55 and above the center Cl of the second connecting pin 57.<br>
[0056]<br>
[Advantages]<br>
As described above, the present invention has the advantages as follows.<br>
The invention claimed in Claim 1 may be constructed so that the link mechanism provides the steering angle ratio varying function by arranging the steering stem below the steering shaft offset from the steering shaft, connecting the steering stem to the steering shaft via the link mechanism, constructing the link mechanism of an upper link, a lower link, and an universal coupling connecting these upper and lower links so that the steering shaft is placed between the steering stem and the universal coupling when the link mechanism is viewed in the direction of axis of the steering shaft.<br>
Therefore, the steering angle ratio varying means can be made into a significantly simple construction, and the steering angle ratio varying means is not necessary to store<br>
