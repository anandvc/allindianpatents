This application is a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S. patent Application Serial No. 10/9-71,310 filed October 22, 2004 .<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to preventing "sudden" thermal runaway in batteries, e.g. , lithium batteries.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In batteries, for example, lithium ion batteries, thermal runaway is a potential problem.  Therma.1 runaway may be initiated by, among other things, physical contact between the anode and cathode of the battery, due to the internal force created by the volume changes of the anode and the cathode during normal cycling, which, in turn, causes a rapid evolution of heat.  The rapid evolution of heat may cause ignition of thermal chemical reactions of anode/electrolyte, cathode/electrolyte, anode/cathode, or electrolyte/electrolyte. The ignition scenario may lead to a hazardous situation for the battery.<br><br>
Thermal runaway may be categorized as "sudden' thermal runaway or 'delayed' thermal runaway.  Sudden thermal runaway refers to very rapid heat evolution, i.e., arising in less than 1 second after inception.  Delayed thermal runaway refers to heat evolution, i.e., arising in more than 3 seconds after inception.  In lithium ion batteries, over 99% of failures are caused by sudden thermal runaway.  Delayed thermal runaway ma.~y be safeguarded against by the use of a 'shutdown' separator (e.g., a separator that responds to increasing heat by pore closure that stops ionic flow between the anode and cathode), or by the rapid dissipation of tieat from the cell.  Sudden thermal runaway, however, has not been successfully dealt with.<br>
Sudden thermal runaway of the Li-ion cells may be simulated in battery safety, tests referred to as:  the 'nail penetration' test or the 'crush' test (crush tests include: ball crush, bar crush, and plate crush) .  In each of these tests, an external force, applied via a nail, ball, bar, or plate, is exerted on the housing (or 'can') of the battery which, in turn, may cause the anode and cathode to come into physical contact.<br>
The foregoing safety tests exacerbate the tight fitting situation already existing within the battery housing.  For example, lithium ion batteries are, most often, produced in<br><br>
cylindrical and prismatic forms.  The anode/separator/cathode are wound or folded, without electrolyte,  into shape and then snuggly fit into their housing (can) and capped shut.  When electrolyte is added, the anode/separator/cathode swell.  This causes internal forces within the can to increase.  Later, during 'formation' (i.e., when the battery is given an initial charge), the anode and cathode expand again (e.g. , the anode may expand by about 10% and the cathode may expand by about 3%) . The expansion during formation again causes internal forces within the can to increase.  These internal forces, such as those from the nail penetration and crush, tests mentioned above, are directed toward the center of the battery.  When the external forces are exerted on the can, those forces are also directed toward the center of the battery.  The result is extraordinary pressures within the batterry and those pressures are forcing the anode and cathode into ph_ysical contact by compressing the microporous membrane separator placed therebetween.<br>
The use of microporous membranes as battery separators is known.  For example, microporous membranes are used as battery separators in lithium ion batteries.  Such separators may be single layered or multi-layered thin films made of polyolefins. These separators often have a 'shut-down' property such that<br><br>
xvhen   the   temperature  of   the  battery reaches   a  predetermined temperature,   the pores   of   the   membrane  close  and  thereby prevent the   flow  of   ions  between  the   electrodes   of   the  battery. Increasing  temperature   in  the   battery may be   caused by  internal shorting,   i.e.,   physical   contact  of   the   anode   and cathode.      The physical   contact  may be   caused by,   for  example,   physical  damage to  the  battery,   damage   to  the    separator  during battery manufacture,   dendrite growth,    excessive  charging,   and the  like. As   such,   the  separator,   a  thin   (e.g.,   typically about   8-25 microns   thickness)   microporous  membrane,   must   have good dimensional   stability.<br>
Dimensional  stability,   as  it   applies  to battery separators, refers   to  the  ability of   the   separator not   to   shrink  or not   to excessively  shrink as  a  result  of   exposure  to   elevated temperatures.      This   shrinkage   is  observed  in  the X  and Y axes  of the   planar   film.     This   term has  not,   to  date,   referred  to  the  Z-direction  dimensional   stability.<br>
Puncture  strength,   as  it   applies  to  battery separators,   is the   film's   ability to  resist   puncture  in  the  Z-direction. Puncture   strength  is   measured,  by observing  the  force  necessary to  pierce   a membrane  with a  moving  needle  of  known physical dimensions .<br><br>
To date, nothing has been done to improve the Z-direction dimensional stability of these battery separators.  Z-direction. refers to the thickness of the separator.  A battery is tightly-wound to maximize its energy density.  Tightly winding means, for a cylindrically wound battery, that forces are directed radially inward, causing a. coinpressive force on the separator across its thickness dimension.  In the increasing temperature situation, as the material of the separator starts to flow and blind the pores, the electrodes of the battery may move toward one another.  As they move closer to one another, the risk of physical contact increases.  The contact of the electrodes must be avoided.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for a battery separator, particularly a battery separator for a lithium ion battery, having improved Z-direction stability, and for a battery separator that can prevent or- reduce failure arising from sudden thermal runaway.<br>
In the prior art, it is known to mix filler into a separator for a lithium battery.  In U.S.. Patent No. 4,650,730, a multi-layered battery separator is disclosed.  The first layer, the 'shut down' layer, is an unfilled microporous<br><br>
membrane.      The  second layer,   the  dimensionally stable   layer,   is a particulate   filled raicroporous   layer.      The  second  layer,   in final   form   (i.e.,   after  extraction of   the  plasticizer),   has   a composition  weight   ratio   of   7-35/50-93/0-15   for<br>
polymer/filler/plasticizer .      There   is  no  mention  of   Z-directiom dimensional   stability;   instead,   dimensional   stability  refers   to the   length  and breadth dimensions   of   the   separator.      The   filler-is  used   as  a processing  aid  so  that   the  high molecular  weight polymer  can be  efficiently   extruded  into  a  film.      In U.S.   Patent No. . 6 , 432 , 586,   a multi -layered battery  separator   for  a  high-energy   lithium battery  is   disclosed.      The  separator  has   a  firs t microporous  membrane   and  a   second nonporous  ceramic   composite layer.      The  ceramic   composite   layer  consists of   a matrix material   and  inorganic par-tides.      The  matrix material   may be selected   from the  group  off   polyethylene  oxide   (PEO), polyvinylidene  fluoride   (PVDF) ,   polytetrafluoroethylene    (PTFE)  , polyurethane,   polyarcylonitrile    (PAN) ,   polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) ,   polytetraethylene   glycol   diacrylate,   copolymers   thereof and  mixtures   thereof.     The   inorganic  particles  may be   selected from the  group  of   silicon   dioxide   (SiO2) ,   aluminum oxide   (A1203) , calcium  carbonate   (CaC03) ,    titanium dioxide   (TiO2) ,   SiS2,   SiPO4 , and   the   like.     The  particialate  makes  up  about  5-80%  by  weight    of the   ceramic   composite  layer,   but  most  preferably  40-60%.      Therre<br><br>
is no mention of Z-direction stability, and the particulate Is chosen for its conductive properties.<br>

In this method, a thermoplastic microporous membrane havin_<g inert thermally non-deforming particulate dispersed therein is placed between the electrodes of battery. thus for example when an external force applied to battery phrysical contact prevented by particulate-filled separator.></g>

Description of the Invention<br>
A battery, as used herein, refers to a charge storage device, e.g., a chemical generator of emf (electromotive force} or a capacitor.  Typically, the battery is a device comprising , in general, an anode, a catriode, a separator, an electrolyte, and a housing (or can) .  The battery, which is believed to havo the greatest potential to benefit from the present invention, is a rechargeable lithium battery, e.g., having a lithium metal (Li), lithium alloy (LiSix, LiSnx, LiAlx, etc.), or a lithiated carbon material (LixCs, where X
lithium batteries are also known as lithium ion batteries or lithium polymer batteries.  The cathodes, electrolytes, and housinqs for such batteries are well known and conventional. The separator, by which the improvement discussed herein is obtained, is discussed in greater detail hereinafter.<br>
A battery separator, as used herein, refers to a. thin, microporous membrane that is placed between the electrodes of a battery.  Typically, it physically separates the electrodes to prevent their contact, allows ions to pass through the pores between the electrodes during discharging and charging, acts as a reservoir for the electrolyte, and may have a x shut down' function.<br>
Microporous membranes typically have porosities in the range of 20-80%, alternatively in the range of 28-60%.  The average pores size is typically in the range of 0.02 to 2. O microns, alternatively in the range of 0.04 to 0.25 microns. The membrane typically has a Gurley Number in the range of 5 to 150 sec, alternatively 20 to 80 sec (Gurley Numbers refers to the time it takes for 10 cc of air at 12.2 inches of water to pass through one square inch of membrane) .  The membrane may range in thickness from about 0.1 to 75 microns, alternatively 8 to 25 microns.  Membranes may be single layered or multi-<br><br>
layered.      In multi-layered membranes,   at   least   one  of   the membranes  will   include  the   filler  discussed  in  greater  detail below.     A multi-layered   separator may have  three   layers  where the   filled layer   is   sandwiched between  two  other  layers  or two-filled  layer may   sandwich  another membrane.     Other  layer,   as used  herein,   refers   to  any  layer,   including  coatings,   other  than the   inventive   layer.     Other   configurations  are  readily apparent to   one  of  ordinary  skill .<br>
Thermoplastic polymer generally refers  to  any synthetic thermoplastic polymer triat   softens  when heated  and returns  to its   original  condition when  cooled.     Such  thermoplastic  polymers include:   polyolefins,   polyvinyl  halogens   (e.g.,,   PVC) ,   nylons, fluorocarbons,   polystyrenes,   and  the  like.     Of   the thermoplastics,   polyolefins  are  the most  interesting. Polyolefins   include,   but   are  not   limited to,   polyethylene,   ultra high  molecular  weight polyethylene   (not   considered a thermoplastic  by   some,   but   included herein nevertheless) , polypropylene,   polybutene,   polymethylpentene,   polyisoprene, copolymers  thereof,   and   blends  thereof.      Exemplary blends include,   but  are  not  limited to,   blends   containing two or more of   the   following  polyetriylene,   ultra  high molecular weight polyethylene,   and polypropylene,   as  well   as,   blends  of  the foregoing with  copolymerrs   such  as   ethylene-butene  copolymer  and<br><br>
ethylene-hexene   copolymer  and  blends   of   those  polymers  and  co-polymers  with differing   molecular weights.<br>
Inert,   thermal   non-deforming particulate  filler refers   to any material   that  when uniformly blended into  the   foregoing thermoplastic polymer does  not   interact  nor  chemically  react with  the  thermoplastic polymer  to  substantially  alter  its fundamental  nature  and will   not,   when used  as  a   component   of   the membrane of   a battery separator,   have   a  material   adverse   impact upon  the  chemistry of  trie  battery.      This  filler  may be  any material  that  is   thermally  stable,   i.e.,   maintains  or substantially maintains    its  physical   shape  at  temperatunres above,    for example,   200° C.      Particulate  most  often refeors   to  a small 'bead or grain,   but  may also describe a  flat  or planar object  or a  rod  or fiber-  like  object.     The  filler  is  small,   and by small  is  meant   an average  particle   size  in  the   submicron (less   than  1  micron)   range  with  a maximum particle   size    no larger  than  40%   of  the membrane  layer thickness,   alternatively no  larger than  10%  of  trie  layer's  thickness.     In  some applications   (e.g.,   when making membranes with  a  thickness  of about   1  micron  or less)r    filler with  nano-sized  average   particle sizes   is  beneficial.<br><br>
Inert, thermally non-deforming particulate filler may be selected from the following group of materials: carbon based materials, metal oxides and hydroxides, metal carbonates , minerals, synthetic and natural zeolites, cements, silicates, glass particles, sulfur-containing salts, synthetic polymers, and mixtures thereof.  Exemplary carbon based materials include: carbon black, coal dusty and graphite.  Exemplary metal oxides and hydroxides include those having such materials as silicon, aluminum, calcium, magnesium, barium, titanium, iron, zinc, and tin.  Specific examples include: TiO2, MgO, SiO2, A1203, SiS2, and SiP04.  Exemplary metal carbonates include those having such materials as: calcium and magnesium.  Specific examples include: CaCO3.  Exemplary minerals include: mica, montmorillonit<e kaolinite attapulgite asbestos talc diatomaceous earrth and vermiculite. exemplary cements include: portland cement. silicates precipitated metal calcium silicate aluminum polysilicate fumed silica alumina gels. sulfur-containing salts molybdenum disulfide zinc sulfide barium sulfate. synthetic polymers polytetrafluoro ethylene polyimide polyesters polyethylene terephtalate .></e>
The  particulate    (or  filler)   may  comprise   any weight  -%r   of the  membrane,   so   long    as  at   the   lowest  end,   there   is  suffi-cient particulate  to  prevent   the   electrodes   from touching  and  at   the upper  end there   is  sufficient   thermoplastic   to  hold  the separator together durring manufacture  of  the  separator anci battery and to  hold  trie  separator  together between  the electrodes.      Such  a range  may be  about   1%  to  about   99% wej_ght   of particulate based upon  the   total  weight  of  the   separator.      Most often,   the  range   should be  between  about   1%  to  about   70% (including  all  possible   subsets   of values   therebetween).<br>
The  foregoing membranes  may be  made by any  conventional process.     The   two most   widely used processes   for  making microporous  membranes    for battery  separators  are  know as  the dry-stretch   (or Celgarrd)   process  and the wet   (or extraction, or TIPS)   process.      The major difference between these processes   is the  method by which  trie  microporous   structure   is   formed.       In   the dry-stretch process,    the pore   structure  is   formed by stretching. In  the wet process/   trie pore  structure is  formed by the extraction of  a  component.     Both processes are   similar in   that the  material   components  are  mixed,   typically  in  an  extruder  or via master-batching,    and  then  formed  into a  thin  film precursor before pore  formation -<br>
The present invention may be manufactured by either process, so long as the inert particulate filler is uniformly mixed into the thermoplastic polymer prior to extrusion of the precursor.<br>
In addition to the above combination of thermoplastic polymer and particulate filler, the mixture may include conventional stabilizers, antioxidants, additives, and processing aids as known to those skilled in the art.<br>
TMA (thermal mechianical analysis) measures the mechand-cal response of a polymer system as the temperature changes.  IThe compression TMA measures the loss of thickness of a film wlien a constant force is applied in the Z-direction to the film as a function of increasing temperature.  In this test, a mechaxiical probe is used to apply a controlled force to a constant aroa of the sample as the temperature is increased.  The movement of the probe is measured as a function of temperature.  The compression TMA is used to measure the mechanical integrity of the filTn.<br>
A standard TMA machine (Model No. TMA/SS/150C, Seiko Instruments Inc., Paramus, NJ) with a probe (quartz cylindrical probe, 3mm diameter) is used.  The load on the probe is 12 5g.<br>
The temperature is increased at the rate of 5°C/min.  The film sample size is a single film with the dimensions of 5x5mm.<br>
In Figures 1 and 2, the X-axis represents temperature and the Y-axis represents % TMA.  % TMA is percentage reduction, in thickness of the membrane as a result of increasing tempera-ture For example, at 0°C, the membrane's thickness is 100% under- the specified load.  In the instant membrane, a maximum compression of 95% (or 5% of tlie original thickness) is suitable to present electrode contact.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, there is shown four (4) TMA compression curves of four different membranes.  Each membr~ane is a microporous membrane of polypropylene.  Curve A is the; controlv (i.e., no filler) .  Curve B has 4% by volume talc. Curve C has 8% talc.  Curve D has 12% talc.  Note that the control has a maximum compression of 100% at.250°C/ whereas Curves C and D never cross the 80% compression lines.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, there is shown four (4) TMA compression curves of four different membranes.  Each membrrane is a microporous membrane of polypropylene.  Curve A is the control (i.e., no filler) .  Curve B has 2.5% by volume TiO2 Curve C has 5% TiO2 -  Curve D has 8.5% Ti02.  Note that the<br>
control has a maximum compression of 100% at 250°C, whereas Curve B has a maximum compression of about 95% and Curves C and D have a maximum compression of about 90%.<br>
The nail penetration test and the crush test (e.g., ba.ll crush) measure battery response to the catastrophic destruction of a cell .  Both tests are internal short circuit tests recommended by Underwriters Laboratory Inc. of Northbrook,  IL to evaluate the safety of a lithium ion cell.  The parameters involved include: celLl voltage, nail/ball crush speed, nail, size/ball diameter, and operating temperature.  The procedutre is as follows: 1. charge the Li-ion cell to the required voltage, 2. adjust the required temperature of the chamber in which the test will be done and. place the cell over the stand designed for the test, 3. attach two or more thermocouples over the surface of the cell, 4. connect the voltage sensing leads to the positive and negative terminals of the cell, 5. connect theB temperature sensing leads to the thermocouples attached to the cell, 6. the entire setup is controlled by a lab view progaram, 7. choose the appropriate nail (a typical nail will be an ilnch long, 3-4 mm thick, and having a sharp point) or metal baljL (6 mm - 12 mm diameter steel ball), 8. once the setup is compHete, choose the speed of the test (usual speed ranges from 2-8 mm/sec), 9. the test is started by the lab view control.<br>
Referring to Figure 3, there is shown five (5) cur~ves illustrating temperature (°C) increase arising from 'nail penetration' as a. function of time (sec).  Each cell tested was in an 18650 design for a lithium ion cell.  The curves labeled A represent the present invention.  Specifically, the memb-rane comprised a microporous membrane of an ultra-high molecular weight polymer (PE) having approximately 53% by weight silica and being made by a wet process.  This membrane had an electrical resistance of 1.49 ohm-cm2, a mix penetration strength of 70 kgf (kilogiram force) , and a dielectric breakdown of 558 V. The curves labeled B represent a prior art separator (tinfilled polyolefin) .  Note the rate of increase in temperature of the conventional (unfilled) separators, while the inventive separator saw little to no temperature increase.  The iLnventive separator's external temperature did not rise above 10O°C from an initial temperature of 25°C for at least 25 seconds after the nail penetration.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, there is shown several curves illustrating voltage (V) decrease arising from a "ball crush' test as a function of time (sec) .  The ball used in the test had a diameter of about 9.4 mm.  Each cell tested was in a prismatic design for a littiium ion cell.  The curves labeled A represent<br>
the present invention.  Specifically, the membrane comprised a microporous membrane of an ultra-high molecular weight polymer (PE) having approximately 53% by weight silica and being made by a wet process.  This membrane had an electrical resistance of 1.49 ohm-cm2, a mix penetration strength of 70 kgf, and a dielectric breakdown of 558 V.  The curves labeled B a.nd C represent prior art separators (unfilled polyolefin) .  Note that separators A show delayed failure, that all separators A passed the test and none of the other separators (B and C) passed, and that the time for trie rise in the external cell temperature (not shown in the Figure) is also higher for separators A than for separators B &amp; C.  The inventive separators' voltage ^remained within 10% of its initial voltage for at least five (5) seconds after being crushed.<br>
A cycling performance test is used to observe the battery operation over its life.  The cycling performance test procedure is as follows: 1. charge the cell a C/2 rate to EOCV of 4.2 V, 2. maintain the cell voltage at 4.2 V until the charging current drops to approximately C/50 rate, 3. discharge the cell at a 1C rate to EODV of 3.0 V, 4. rest the cell for 1-2 minutes, 5. steps 1-4 are called one cycle of charge and discharge.  Repeat them to get the cycling performance for the desired nxamber of cycles.  The following is a definition of the terms: the "C'<br>
rate  is  a  current  ttiat   is  numerically  equal   to  the A-hr   orating of  the  cell    (e.g.,   C/2   rate   for  a   lA-hr  cell   is   500  mA) ,     EOCV  is end of   charge  voltage,    and  EODV  is  end   of  discharge voltage.<br>
Referring  to   Figure   5,   there   is  shown   two   (2)   curves illustrating   the  cycle  performance  of   the   instant   invent ion against  a prior  art    separator.      In this  graph,   discharges capacity   (Ah)    is  shown  as  a   function of  cycle number.     Each  cell tested was   in  a prismatic  design  for a   lithium ion cell.       The curve   labeled A represents   the  present   invention.      Specifically, the membrane  comprised  a microporous membrane of  an ultrra-high molecular weight polymer   (PE)   having  approximately 53%  b»y weight silica  and  being made  by a  wet  process.     This membrane  hxad  an electrical   resistance   of  1.49  ohm-cm2,   a mix penetration,    strength of  70  kgf,   and a dielectric breakdown of  558  V.     The currve labeled C represents  a prior art  separator   (unfilled polyolefin) .      Typically,   when the   strength  of  a  separator  is increase  the   cycle   performance  of  the   separator  decreases.      In the present   invention,   however,   the  cycle performance is improved.<br>
