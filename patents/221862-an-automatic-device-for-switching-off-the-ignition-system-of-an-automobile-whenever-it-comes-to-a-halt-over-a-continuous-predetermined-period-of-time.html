				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This  invention relates to a device for  switching  off the ignition system of an automobile whenever it  cornea to  a  halt over a continuous predetermined  period  of<br>
time.<br>
It  is  common knowledge that an  automobile  is  often<br>
brought to a halt, with the engine running.  When  such<br>
a  situation  occurs over  a  continuous  predetermined<br>
period  of time, the device proposed herein  shuts  off<br>
the  ignition  system and, thus, the  engine,  to  save<br>
fuel .<br>
If  the engine is to be re-started, a simple  procedure<br>
is adopted in order to do so.<br>
A safety feature of the said device is that re-starting<br>
is  made possible only when the vehicle gearing  is  in<br>
neutral  position; not otherwise.  This feature  ia  to<br>
guard   against  the  possibility  of  the   automobile<br>
suddenly  lunging forward, during re-starting,  as  for<br>
instance,  when  the automobile gears are      in  engaged<br>
condition.<br>
The   said   device  can  be   de-activated,   whenever<br>
necessary,  by  a manual override  switch  which,  when<br><br>
operated, enables the automobile to work normally.<br>
Various other features of the device proposed herein will be apparent from the<br>
following further description thereof<br>
According to this invention the automatic device for switching off the ignition system of an automobile whenever it comes to a halt over a continuous predetermined period of time, comprises a sensor for sensing the wheel movement of the automobile; a microcontroller based circuit connected on its input side, to the sensor and on its output side, to the ignition system of the automobile, tor receiving, the output signal from the sensor, and switching otf the ignition system whenever the sensor senses no wheel movement over a continuous predetermined interval of time; a throttle switch, provided for the throttle and connected to the input side of the microcontroller, said throttle switch being actuated, on opening the throttle, to cause the microcontroller to switch on the ignition      system   and     activate      the        starter     system     to re-start<br><br>
the engine; B neutral switch connected to the gear system and to the starter system, the neutral ©witch disenabling the starter system from re-starting the engine unless, while opening the throttle, the gears are in neutral position to enable the starter system to re-start the engine.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings the single Figure in which illustrates, by way of example, and not by way of limitation, the circuitry and layout of one of it« various possible embodiments.<br>
A  sensor S (pulsar coil) senses the wheel movement  of<br>
the automobile.<br>
The  sensor  S is connected to the input  sid»  of  the<br>
ignition   system  (exemplified  by   the   capacitance<br>
discharge ignition unit C, the high tension coil H  and<br>
the spark plug P).  The rpm output from the capacitance<br>
discharge  unit  C is fed to  a  microcontroller  btsed<br>
circuit M.<br>
Thus,  if the user brings the vehicle to a halt  for  a<br>
continuous predetermined period of, say, 10 seconds.<br><br>
the  microcontroller receives the out; signal  from  the<br>
4<br>
sensor S through the capacitance discharge ignition to the effect that the engine is in idle condition over the said period and switches off the ignition system to save fuel. Such continuous period of 10 seconds may elapse at places, such as, traffic signal points, where fuel is wasted while the engine idles. Of course, since such period is predetermined, it may be fixed at any desired value suited to the objective of conserving fuel during idle intervals. If the user desires to re¬start the vehicle, all that he has to do is to follow the procedure set out below :<br>
A throttle switch T is also connected to the input side of the microcontroller M. As soon as the throttle J is opened (after the ignition system has been switched off by the microcontroller) the throttle switch T is actuated, causing the microcontroller to switch on the ignition system and actuate the starter system of the automobile (exemplified by the starter relay R and starter motor V) to re-start the engine, subject to the condition noted below :<br><br>
A neutral switch N is connected to the Btarter system of the automobile. The said switch, when open, disenables the starter system from re-starting the engine, unless while opening the throttle, the vehicle is kept in neutral gear by the user, to close the said switch. In other words, when re-starting the engine, it is necessary to open the throttle -and, at the same time, keep the vehicle in neutral gear. This feature ensures that the vehicle doe© not, inadvertently, lunge forward and cause a traffic accident, as for instance, if the vehicle gears happen to be engaged. Whenever required, the user can de-activate the said device by operating a manual override switch K, in which case the automobile works in the normal manner. The start button F is for normal starting of the vehicle.<br>
The terms and expressions herein are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents  of the features illustrated and  described<br><br>
but it is understood that various other embodiments of the device proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	An automatic device for switching off the ignition system of an automobile whenever it comes to a halt over a continuous predetermined period of time, comprising a sensor for sensing the wheel movement of the automobile; a microcontroller based circuit connected on its input side, to the sensor and on its output side, to the ignition system of the automobile, for receiving, the output signal from the sensor, and switching off the ignition system whenever the sensor senses no wheel movement over a continuous predetermined interval of time; a throttle switch, provided for the throttle and connected to the input side of the microcontroller, said throttle switch being actuated, on opening the throttle, to cause the microcontroller to switch on the ignition system and activate the starter system to re-start the engine; a neutral switch connected to the gear system and to the starter system, the neutral switch disenabling the starter system from re-starting the engine unless, while opening the throttle, the gears are in neutral position, to enable the starter system to re-start the engine.<br>
2.	An automatic device as claimed in Claim 1 wherein a manual override switch is provided for de-activation of the said device.<br>
3.	An automatic device for switching otf the ignition system of an automobile whenever it comes to a halt over a continuous predetermined period of time, substantially as herein described with reference to, and as illustrated in, the accompanying drawings.</td>
