COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See section 10 and rule 13)<br>
1. TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
"Clasp and its Functioning for Jewellery and Accessory"<br>
2. APPLICANT(S)<br>
1.NAME :   Radius Corporation Ltd.<br>
2.NATIONALITY: Indian<br>
3.ADDRESS: 57-58, Vardhman Nagar,<br>
Rajnandgaon - 491441,<br>
State-Chhattisgarh,<br>
India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
/<br><br>
Title of Invention:<br>
"Clasp and its Functioning for Jewellery and Accessory"<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
This invention relates to a connecting device which is used for jewelry and accessories, such as jewellery or pearl necklace, bracelets, chain, foot chain etc. PARTICULARLY, the invention relates to the clasp and its functioning device for Jewellery and its accessories.<br>
Background of Invention:<br>
A connecting device which is used for jewelry and accessories such as a jewellery or pearl necklace, bracelets, chain, foot chain etc. is conventionally known as a clasp. Jewelry clasps are more than just functional components used to securely connect two ends of a necklace or other piece of jewelry. Some clasps are there for function only, with a subdued appearance that keeps them from overpowering the jewelry. Other clasps are bold and are an important part of the jewelry's overall design. Some types of clasps are more secure than others and some are more difficult to open and close without help from another person.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
As shown in FIG. 1,<br>
As per one of prior art, a clasp 20 comprises a female member 21, which is a box having a insertion aperture 22, and male member 26 made of a metal plate bent into a V-shape and formed as a plate-spring. It is used by inserting or pulling out the male member 26, formed into a flat shape by using the fingers to press portion 27 against the back portion, into the aperture of the female member 21.<br>
However, the above-mentioned clasp 20 has a disadvantage in that it is difficult to wear. For instance, it is often necessary to move the clasp 20 to the front of the neck to confirm that the male member 26 is surely connected to the female member 21, and then to move the clasp back behind the neck when the necklace is used. Furthermore, it is not easy to form the male member 26 to a flat shape by pressing portion 28 using the fingers and portion 28 must be inserted into the aperture 22 and surely hooked in the hook-recess 23. Also the exposed Arm 28 causes inconvenience to the user. This art is more difficult for old age users<br>
2<br><br>
having vision problem. Also it does not match with aesthetic grid of jewellery for every design.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2,<br>
Which is another prior art wherein, A spring ring clasp opens when you push backwards on a little lever that slides along a circular ring. Once the clasp is open you simply insert the chain or loop that's attached to the piece you're connecting into the open circle, then release the lever to return it to the closed position. There's a tiny spring inside the clasp that puts pressure on the mechanism to keep the spring ring shut until you decide to open it again. These spring ring clasps are commonly used to secure necklaces, bracelets and anklets, but some people have a difficult time operating very tiny spring ring clasps by themselves. Hence clasps that attach to a good sized loop and that one can handle easily is required. These are more difficult to old age users having vision problem. Also it does not match with aesthetic grid of jewellery for every design.<br>
Few other clasp which exist and are the prior art given below:<br>
A.	"S" Type Claps - Disadvantages - for each opening/one free Arm of "S"<br>
is bent to remove the Jewellery and re-bend to lock. Due to repeated<br>
bending of Metal, it breaks. Also if the Jewellery is pulled with pressure, the<br>
lock is removed due to bending of free Arm of "S" Clasp. These are more<br>
difficult to old age users having vision problem. Also it does not match with<br>
aesthetic grid of jewellery for every design.<br>
B.	Hook Type Clasp - Disadvantages - Simple Hook is inserted in the Ring<br>
or removed for its Functioning. It does not give perfect lock to Jewellery as<br>
at different position of Jewellery if the Hook is not pulled with weight of<br>
jewellery, it unlock and Jewellery is not held. These are more difficult to old<br>
age users having vision problem. Also it does not match with aesthetic grid<br>
of jewellery for every design.<br>
C. Nut Bolt Type Clasp - Disadvantages - A threaded Bolt is used to lock with threaded Nuts. It is exertive to match three Nuts, placed on two ends of Jewellery. Also with regular use, the threads get spoiled. These are more difficult to old age users having vision problem. Also it does not match with aesthetic grid of jewellery for every design.<br>
—-3 -<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a connecting device for jewelry and accessories which is capable of eliminating the above-mentioned problems, which is easy to wear, and which is constructed of only a few small parts so that the cost is economical.<br>
Another object of the invention is to rule out all above disadvantages, and to device a clasp wherein the Functioning is easy for all types of users, Lock is assured, providing safety to Jewellery against misplacement during use. Also it is aesthetically much better and with some change in design of cover metal, it can match with every designn of jewellery.<br>
Another object of the invention is to device a clasp in such a way which add the beauty to the design of the jewelry and acts as a decorative element of the jewellery.<br>
