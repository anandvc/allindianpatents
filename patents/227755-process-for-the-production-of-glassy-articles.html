				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the production of glassy<br>
articles comprising: a step for the preparation of the gel of the interesting material<br>
through the so called sol-gel technique, a step for drying the obtained gel by a pressure<br>
heating in the presence of an inert fluid and under the critical pressure and temperature<br>
of the solvent present in the gel pores and a final step of a thermal treatment in order to<br>
obtain the glassy article. Of course, the process can be stopped at any step in the case<br>
some relevant intermediates are aimed to be drawn, because of other application, such<br>
as, for instance, the sol as such, or the very gel before the syntherization.<br>
It is known that the term "sol-gel" relates to and covers a wide field of procedures<br>
for the production of dry gels, that, in the case, can be densified to prepare<br>
corresponding glassy bodies. The dry gels, as such, can be employed as catalyst<br>
carriers, or in the thermal insulation field, while the glasses obtained thereby can find<br>
applications in various technological fields, mainly in the optic and the semiconductor<br>
fields.<br>
Usually, the glasses are produced by melting mixtures of suitable powders and by<br>
subsequently solidifying the melted product. On the contrary, the sol-gel processes use<br><br>
solutions of the precursors of the interesting materials and avoid to pass through<br>
melting steps, often out of any possible control.<br>
All sol-gel processes known in the art comprise the following steps:<br>
-	preparation of a solution, or suspension, of a precursor formed by a compound<br>
of the element (M) forming the oxide which is the goal for the preparation of<br>
the final glassy article,<br>
-	hydrolysis, acid or base catalyzed, of the precursor, to form M-OH groups,<br>
according to the reaction<br>
MXn + nH20 → M(OH)n + nHX<br>
wherein the unknown capital letters have the meaning hereinafter reported.<br>
The so obtained mixture, i.e. a solution or a colloidal suspension, is named<br>
sol,<br>
-	polycondensation of the M-OH groups according to the reaction<br>
M-OH + M-OH → M-O-M + H20<br>
characterized by an increase of the liquid viscosity (gelation) and by the<br>
contemporaneous formation of a matrix called gel,<br>
-	gel drying with the formation of a porous monolithic body; drying can be<br>
carried out by a controlled solvent evaporation, which produces the so called<br>
xerogel, or by a solvent supercritical extraction which produces the so called<br><br>
aerogel: As above said the dried gel can be industrially used as such, or it can<br>
be densified by a thermal treatment to prepare a glassy body.<br>
The sol-gel techniques, when aimed to the glass production, warrant advantages<br>
on the melting techniques because of a better control of all process parameters and,<br>
consequently, because of the final products which are characterized by higher purity.<br>
Sol-gel processes for the production of glassy bodies, mainly silicon oxide based,<br>
are disclosed in many patents. For instance, US patents n. 4,324,576 and n.5,076,980<br>
relate to processes wherein the precursors are alkoxydes, particularly<br>
tetramethoxyorthosylane (TMOS) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). Improved<br>
processes, aimed to minimize the production costs and to improve the quality of the<br>
final product, are described in US patents nos. 4,680,048, 4,681,615 and 5,207,814 or<br>
in EP 586,013, wherein there is disclosed also the addition of silica to sol obtained<br>
alkoxydes, under pyrogenie or colloidal shape. According to these patents teaching, a<br>
peculiar care is given to the gelling step (polycondensation) and, particularly according<br>
EP 586,013, to the gel drying that, in a method for the production of optical<br>
components and in almost final devices, is carried out at temperature and pressures<br>
above the critical values of the solvent within gel.<br>
The final products are quite good: however, the hypercritical drying technology<br><br>
needs apparata built with particular materials and moreover, can be carried out only by<br><br>
high energy consumptions. US patents nos. 5,243,769 and 5,473,826 disclose methods<br>
for drying porous gels, obtained via sol-gel processes, under temperatures and<br>
pressures lower than the critical values of the gel solvent, which comprise the gel<br>
setting, once immersed in a drying solvent, in a pressure chamber and the increase of<br>
the temperature thereof: the former, in the presence of an inert gas saturated by the<br>
above said solvent vapor, the latter, without such an inert gas, as well as a continuous<br>
monitoring of the internal pressure: however, the deviation from the solvent<br>
temperature and pressure critical values is low, and all methods comprise the use of a<br>
drying solvent in the pressure chamber, in discrete amounts, which forces the<br>
consequent use of recovery procedures.<br>
The Applicant has now found, which is the main object of the present invention,<br>
that it is possible to achieve a process for the production of glassy articles, without any<br>
of the above said drawbacks, which comprises the sol-gel technique to prepare gel, as<br>
well as the drying thereof at temperature and pressure conditions lower than the<br>
solvent critical values, also with very high deviation therefrom; of course, the<br>
processes can be achieved also to prepare and to separate any interesting intermediate,<br>
such as sol to be hydrolyzed, or the very gel before the thermal densification. The<br>
preparation and the separation of such intermediates are, on turn, appendant objects of<br>
the present invention, to which they fully pertain.<br><br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention a process for the production of<br>
glassy articles comprising the following operations:<br>
a)	preparation of an aqueous or hydroalcoholic solution, or suspension, of at least<br>
of a compound having the formula<br>
Xm-M-(OR)n-m<br>
wherein M is a cation of an element belonging to the 3rd, 4th, or 5th Group of<br>
the Periodic System, n means the cation valence, X is R1 or OR1, R1 being the<br>
same of or different from R, m is zero or an integer number lower than 3, R<br>
and R1 are hydrocarbon radical having a carbon atom number up to 12;<br>
b)	hydrolysis of the above said compound, either in solution or in suspension, to<br>
obtain the so called sol;<br>
c)	eventual addition in colloidal suspension of possible M2On<br>
d)	sol gelling;<br>
e)	substitution of the gel pore solvent with a non protic solvent;<br>
f)	gel setting in a pressure chamber;<br>
g)	inert gas fluxing into the pressure chamber;<br>
h) pressure chamber heating over a programmed time period to achieve<br>
predeterminate temperature and pressure values, lower than the relevant<br>
critical value of the gel solvent, and evaporation thereof;<br><br>
i) depressurization of the pressure chamber with vapor discharge;<br>
j) pressure chamber washing by an inert gas;<br>
k) cooling the dried gel and removal thereof from the pressure chamber;<br>
1) dried gel syntherization by heating at a prefixed temperature to form a glassy<br>
body without any cracking.<br>
The colloidal solution (sol) of the step a) is prepared by mixing one or more<br>
metallic oxide precursors, according to the above mentioned formula, with water, or<br>
water/alcohol, in the presence of a catalyst, either acid or base. As above said, M is a<br>
cation, n valenced, of an element belonging to Groups 3, 4 or % of the Element<br>
Periodic System, particularly Si, Ge, Ti and Al, Si being the preferred one. As to all<br>
possible meanings of X, the alkoxide groups are the preferred ones and, with reference<br>
thereto, particular interest is in methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy and butoxy groups.<br>
The hydrolysis is carried out also at room temperature, and the same can be<br>
performed over a time from 5 minutes to beyond 4 hours, till the formation of hydrated<br>
oxides of the cation/s constituting the colloidal solution components. Before gelling,<br>
the obtained sol can be added by a colloidal suspension of the oxide of at least one of<br>
the present cations. For instance , if use is made of a precursor comprising or<br>
constituted by a silicon alkoxide, the above obtained colloidal solution can be added a<br>
solution/suspension prepared by mixing water, possible solvent, fumed silica, an acid<br><br>
or a base. The interruption or the completion of the hydrolysis, at any time before the<br>
gelling start, produce a time stable sol, that can be separated and stored: the possible<br>
removal of such an intermediate also constitutes an object of the present invention.<br>
The sol gelling, according to the step d), is carried out by pouring sol into a mould<br>
and by letting the same stay at a temperature lower than 90°C over a time period from<br>
few minutes to some hours.<br>
At the gelling end, the gel is washed, for instance by an organic solvent, and the<br>
solvent inside the pores thereof is replaced by a non-protic solvent. Such a non-protic<br>
solvent is preferably selected among acetone, dioxane, hydrofuran, acetone being the<br>
preferred one.<br>
The gel shape, obtained thereby, with the most possible minimum solvent content,<br>
is directly set inside a pressure chamber wherein, after closing, an inert gas is fluxed,<br>
mainly nitrogen, at a pressure suitable to achieve, at the pressure chamber temperature<br>
lower than the gel solvent critical temperature, a total pressure lower than the solvent<br>
critical pressure, from pressure values close to the critical pressure values up to the<br>
deviations of about 60% and higher.<br>
There, according to the step h), the pressure chamber temperature is increased<br>
according to a predetermined program, in order to let the gel solvent evaporate.<br><br>
By keeping the programmed temperature, the chamber is depressurizes (step i) to<br>
facilitate the removal of gas and vapor, such as an operation being assisted by the<br>
following chamber cleaning that is preferably carried out by nitrogen.<br>
After the cleaning end, the pressure chamber is cooled, opened and the dried gel is<br>
removed (step k).<br>
The obtained gel, in the shape obtained from the mold used in step g) can,<br>
according to an appendant object of the present invention, be separated and employed<br>
as such, or subjected to the vetrification procedure according to step 1).<br>
Such a procedure comprises to put the dry gel in an oven, to increase the oven<br>
temperature beyond 100°C, also up to 900°C, under an atmosphere containing also<br>
oxygen, that is used to calcinate the gel. After this treatment, or during the same, gas<br>
mixtures can be fed containing chlorine or chlorine precursors, to remove possible<br>
hydroxides present in silica and/or to purify aerogel, the oven temperature being<br>
between 100°C and 1250°C.<br>
At last the oven temperature is increased to a value letting the aerogel be densified<br>
to reach vetrification, such a temperature, with reference to silica material, being<br>
between 900°C and 1650°C, under an inert gas atmosphere, the gas being helium,<br>
oxygen, chlorine, and the like. The duration of any oven treatment can range from tens<br>
of minutes to many hours.<br><br>
The advantages of the process found by the Applicant over those process<br>
operating at subcritical conditions are temperature and pressure of operation still lower<br>
than those claimed by those Patents (US 5,243,769 and US 5,473,836).<br>
In addtition clearly other advantages are to operate withput drying solvent in the<br>
pressure chamber in such amount which forces the consequent use of recovery<br>
procedures.<br>
All above said and further operative details will appear more clear by reading the<br>
following examples, which aim to illustrate the invention without any limitation to the<br>
purposes thereof.<br>
Example 1<br>
26,1 1 of 0,01 N HC1 were added, under stirring, to 9,4 1 of TEOS. After about 60<br>
minutes of continuous stirring, a transparent solution was obtained. 5 kg of powdery<br>
fumed silica were added under strong stirring. The commercial product Aerosil OX-50<br>
was particularly idoneous to be added there accordingly. The mixture was<br>
homogenized by a very strong mechanical stirring for about 60 minutes and, then, by<br>
ultrasounds for about ten minutes. The treated mixture was subjected to centrifugation<br>
and then set in a suitable glass container. This dispersion was added by a 0,01 N<br>
ammonia aqueous solution, in such an amount to warrant the time to pour the very<br><br>
dispersion into the gelation vessels. The treated dispersion was poured into many<br>
cylindric containers, wherein the gelation occurs, having internal diameters of 24mm<br>
and 80mm and heights of 500mm and 1100mm, respectively.<br>
The cylinders were closed and interconnected with polypropilene pipes with 6mm<br>
diameter. After 24 hours and the gelling completion, a fluid was flowed, through the<br>
cylinders and the interconnecting pipes, at a 5ml/minute rate, which comprised a<br>
water/acetone mixture at a composition of 100% water at the very beginning but time<br>
ranging till to become anhydrous acetone within 48 hours. The inlet flow of anhydrous<br>
acetone is maintained till the water concentration, in the outlet fluid is standingly lower<br>
than 0.1%, even if the flowing is stopped over more than 48 hours and then started<br>
again.<br>
Two cylinders with 24mm internal diameter, containig gels treated as above said<br>
and named wet gels, were put in an autoclave having 413 1 internal volume, together<br>
with a vessel with 4 1 acetone. Once the autoclave had been sealed and heated up to<br>
80°C, nitrogen was fed till to let the inside total pressure be 48 bar. Then the<br>
temperature has been increased up to 225°C, at a 5°C/h rate, to let the autoclave inner<br>
gas escape in a controlled way, such to avoid the total pressure becoming higher than<br>
50 bar. The acetone partial pressure and the autoclave fluid temperature continuously<br>
were lower than the critical ones so allowing the process to be carried out under non-<br><br>
critical conditions. At 225°C, tha autoclave was depressurized to 1 bar, over 24 hours,<br>
and nitrogen washed before being opened and the two samples being removed, such<br>
samples being now dry, very porous gels, named aerogels, of cylindrical shape. The<br>
aerogels were put in an oven; the oven was closed and the temperature was raised to<br>
800°C over 24 hours while room air had being flowed, at a 5 1/min rate. After 12 hours<br>
more at this temperature and under helium flowing, the temperature was raised to<br>
1390°C at 10°C/min rate. The temperature is kept at 1390°C for 10 minutes and then<br>
decreased to 800°C, at a 10°C/min rate, when the oven was shut off and cooled to<br>
room temperature, still under nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
The resulting samples were two glassy bodies having no crackings and a<br>
cylindrical shape.<br>
Example 2<br>
Two wet gels, produced according to the preceding example 1, were put in an<br>
autoclave having 413 1 internal volume, together with a container of 35 1 acetone. Once<br>
the autoclave has been sealed and heated to 80°C, nitrogen was fed to let the autoclave<br>
inner pressure reach 9 bar. Then, at 5°C/h rate, the temperature was increased to<br>
225°C, to let the autoclave inner gas escape in a controlled way such to avoid the total<br>
pressure becoming higher than 32 bar.<br><br>
The autoclave fluid pressure and temperature continuously were lower than the<br>
acetone critical ones, i.e. the fluid inside the gel pores, allowing the process to be<br>
carried out under non-critical conditions. At 225°C, the autoclave is depressurized to 1<br>
bar pressure, over 24 hours, and nitrogen washed before being opened and the two<br>
samples being removed, such samples being now dry, very porous, named aerogels, of<br>
cylindrical shape. The aerogels were put in an oven; the oven was closed and the<br>
temperature was raised to 800°C over 24 hours, while bumb air had being flowed, at a<br>
5 1/min rate. After 12 hours more at this temperature and under helium flowing, the<br>
temperature was raised to 1390°C at a 10°C/min rate, still under helium flowing. The<br>
temperature was kept at 1390°C for 10 minutes and then decreased to 800°C, at a<br>
10°C/min rate, when the oven was shut off and cooled to room temperature, under<br>
nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
The resulting samples were two glassy bodies having no crackings and a<br>
cylindrical shape.<br>
Example 3<br>
Two wet gels, produced according to example n.l, were put in an autoclave<br>
having 13 1 internal volume, together with a container of 4 1 acetone. Once the<br>
autoclave has been sealed and heated to 80°C, nitrogen was fed to let the autoclave<br><br>
inner pressure reach 47 bar. Then, at 50°C/h rate, the temperature was increased to<br>
250°C, to let the autoclave inner gas escape in a controlled way such to avoid the total<br>
pressure becoming higher than 50 bar.<br>
The autoclave acetone pressure continuously was lower than the critical one,<br>
allowing the process to be carried out under non-critical conditions. At 225°C, the<br>
autoclave is depressurized to 1 bar pressure, over 24 hours, and nitrogen washed before<br>
being opened and the two samples being removed, such samples being now dry, very<br>
porous, named aerogels, of cylindrical shape. The aerogels were put in an oven; the<br>
oven was closed and the temperature was raised to 800°C over 24 hours, while room<br>
air had being flowed, at a 5 1/min rate. After 12 hours more at this temperature and<br>
under helium flowing, the temperature was raised to 1390°C at a 10°C/min rate, still<br>
under helium flowing. The temperature was kept at 1390°C for 10 minutes and then<br>
decreased to 800°C, at a 10°C/min rate, when the oven was shut off and cooled to<br>
room temperature, still under nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
The resulting samples were two glassy bodies having no crackings and a<br>
cylindrical shape.<br><br>

predeterminate temperature and pressure values, lower than the<br>
relevant critical value of the gel solvent, and evaporation thereof;<br>
i) depressurization of the pressure chamber with vapor discharge;<br>
j) pressure chamber washing by an inert gas;<br>
k) cooling the dried gel and removal thereof from the pressure chamber;<br>
12. Process for the preparation of a get as claimed in the preceding claim in<br>
which according to step g), the inert gas is fluxed at a pressure suitable to<br>
achieve, at the pressure chamber temperature tower than the gel solvent critical<br>
temperature, a total pressure lower than the gel solvent critical pressure, from<br>
total pressure values close to the critical pressure values upto the deviations of<br>
60%<br><br>
13. Process for the production of the get as claimed in claim 12 in which the<br>
inert gas preferably is nitrogen.<br><br>
Process for the production of glassy articles comprising the following<br>
operations: a) preparation of an aqueous or hydroalcoholic solution, or<br>
suspension, of at least of a compound having the formula<br>
Xm-Si-(OR)n-m<br>
Wherein n means the cation valence, X is R1 or OR1, R1 being the same of or<br>
different from R, m is zero or an integer number lower than 3, R and R1 are<br>
hydrocarbon radical having a carbon atom number up to 12; b) hydrolysis of the<br>
above said compound, either in solution or in suspension, to obtain the so called<br>
sol; c) eventual addition in colloidal suspension of possible Si2On; d) sol gelling;<br>
e) substitution of the gel pore solvent with a non orotic solvent; f) gel setting in<br>
a pressure chamber; g) inert gas fluxing into the pressure chamber; h) pressure<br>
chamber heating over a programmed time period to achieve predeterminate<br>
temperature and pressure values, lower than the relevant critical value of the gel<br>
solvent, and evaporation thereof; i) depressurization of the pressusre chamber<br>
with vapor discharge; j) pressure chamber washing by an inert gas; k) cooling<br>
the dried gel and removal thereof from the pressure chamber; I) dried gel<br>
syntherization by heating at a aprefixed temperature to form a glassy body<br>
without any cracking.</td>
