1-AZA-DIBENZOAZULENES AS INHIBITORS Ut TUMOUR NECKOS/S FACTOR PRODUCTION AND INTERMEDIATES FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to l-aza-dibenzoazulene derivatives, to their pharmacologically acceptable salts and solvates, to processes and intermediates for the preparation thereof as well as to their antiinflammatory effects, especially to the inhibition of tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) production and the inhibition of interleukin-1 (IL-1) production as well as to their analgetic action.<br>
Prior Art<br>
There are numerous literature data relating to various aza- and diaza-dibenzoazulenes and to the preparation thereof. It is well-known that some compounds of such structure and salts thereof have an antiinflammatory action and represent a novel class of compounds having such an action. Thus in a series of patents (US 3,711,489, US 3,781,294 and CA 967,573) the preparation of dibenzoazulenes of imidazole class with various 2-substituents such as trifiuoromethyl, pyridyl, naphthyl, phenyl and substituted phenyl is disclosed. There were also prepared corresponding imidazole derivatives with 2-alkylthio substituents of similar action (US 4,198,421; EP 372,445 and W09,118,885).<br>
Dibenzoazulenes of pyrazole class having alkyl, phenyl or substituted phenyl (FR 2,504,140; and Olivera R et al., Tetrahedron Lett, 2000, 47:4353-4356 and 4357-4360) or acetyl and ethoxycarbonyl (Schulz HJ et al, Z. Chem., 1988, 25:181-182) in 2-position are known as well.<br><br>
There are also literature data disclosing the preparation of 2-aza-dibenzoazulene derivatives such as A^-methyl derivatives (Funke C et al., Arzneim-Forsch., 1990, 40:536-529; Bennett RA et al., J. Heterocycl Chem., 1994, 31:293-296) and several patents disclosing dihydro derivatives of 2-aza-dibenzoazulenes (US 3,773,940; US 3,859,439; US 4,112,110; EP 125,484) and tetrahydro derivatives of 2-aza-dibenzoazulenes (US 4,271,179; EP 357,126 and WO 9,854,186). Further, also aromatic 1-thia-dibenzoazulenes having aminoalkyloxy substituents on thiophene ring, which also possess an antiinflammatory action (WO 01/87890) are known.<br>
According to our knowledge and to available literature data, completely unsaturated aromatic 1-aza-dibenzoazulenes of the present invention have hitherto not been prepared or disclosed. Nor is it known that such compounds could possess an antiinflammatory action (inhibitors of TNF-ct production, inhibitors of IL-1 production) or an analgetic action, said actions also being an object of the present invention. In 1975 TNF-ct was defined as a serum factor induced by endotoxin and causing tumour necrosis in vitro and in vivo (Carswell EA et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1975, 72:3666-3670). Besides an antitumour action, TNF-ct also possesses numerous other biological actions important in the homeostasis of organisms and in pathophysiological conditions. The main sources of TNF-ct are monocytes-macrophages, T-lymphocytes and mastocytes.<br>
The discovery that anti-TNF-ot antibodies (cA2) are effective in treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Elliott M et al., Lancet, 1994, 344:1105-1110) led to an increased interest in finding novel TNF-ct inhibitors as possible potent drugs for RA. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease characterized by irreversible pathological changes in the joints. In addition to RA, TNF-a antagonists may also be used in numerous pathological conditions and diseases such as spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gout and other arthritic conditions, sepsis, septic shock, toxic shock syndrom, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, psoriasis, glomerulonephritis,  lupus  erythematosus,  scleroderma,  asthma,  cachexia,  chronic<br><br>
obstructive lung disease, congestive cardiac arrest, insulin resistance, lung fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, viral infections and AIDS.<br>
Some of the proofs indicating the biological importance of TNF-a were obtained by in vivo experiments in mice, in which mouse genes for TNF-a or its receptor were inactivated. Such animals are resistant to collagen-induced arthritis (Mori L et al., J. Immunol., 1996, 757:3178-3182) and to endotoxin-caused shock (Pfeffer K et al., Cell, 1993, 73:457-467). In animal assays where the TNF-a level was increased, a chronic inflammatory polyarthritis occurred (Georgopoulos S et al., J.Inflamm., 1996, 46:86-97; Keffer J et al., EMBO J., 1991, 70:4025-4031) and its pathological picture was alleviated by inhibitors of TNF-a production. The treatment of such inflammatory and pathological conditions usually includes the application of nonÂ¬steroid antiinflammatory drugs and, in more severe cases, gold salts, D-penicillinamine or methotrexate are administered. Said drugs act symptomatically, but they do not stop the pathological process. Novel approaches in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis are based upon drugs such as tenidap, leflunomide, cyclosporin, FK-506 and upon biomolecules neutralizing the TNF-a action. At present there are commercially available etanercept (Enbrel, Immunex/Wyeth), a fusion protein of the soluble TNF-a receptor, and infliximab (Remicade, Centocor), a chimeric monoclonal human and mouse antibody. Besides in RA therapy, etanercept and infliximab are also registered for the therapy of Crohn's disease (Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs, 2000, 9:103).<br>
In an optimum RA therapy, besides inhibition of TNF-a secretion, also the inhibition of 1L-1 secretion is very important since IL-1 is an important cytokin in cell regulation and immunoregulation as well as in pathophysiological conditions such as inflammation (Dinarello CA et al, Rev. Infect. Disease, 1984, 6:51). Well-known biological activities of IL-1 are: activation of T-cells, induction of elevated temperature, stimulation of the secretion of prostaglandine or collagenase, chemotaxia of neutrophils and reduction of iron level in plasma (Dinarello CA, J. Clinical Immunology, 1985, 5:287). Two receptors to which IL-1 may bind are well-known:<br><br>
IL-1RI and IL-1RII. Whereas IL-1RI transfers a signal intracellular^, IL-1RII is situated on the cell surface and does not transfer a signal inside the cell. Since IL1-R1I binds IL-1 as well as IL1-RI, it may act as a negative regulator of IL-1 action. Besides this mechanism of signal transfer regulation in cells, another natural antagonist of IL-I receptor (IL-lra) is present in cells. This protein binds to IL-1RI but does not cause its stimulation. Its potency in stopping the transfer of IL-1 stimulated signal is not high and its concentration has to be 500 times higher than that of IL-1 in order to achieve a break in the signal transfer. Recombinant human IL-lra (Amgen) was clinically tested (Bresnihan B el al., Arthrit. Rheum., 1996, 39:73) and the obtained results indicated an improvement of the clinical picture over a placebo in RA patients. These results indicate the importance of the inhibition of IL-1 action in treating diseases such as RA where IL-1 production is disturbed. Since there exists a synergistic action of TNF-a and IL-1, dual TNF-a and IL-1 inhibitors may be used in treating conditions and diseases related to an enhanced secretion of TNF-a and IL-1.<br>

hydrogen sulfide with compounds IVa according to processes disclosed in the literature.<br>
e) The alcohols of the structure IV may be oxidized to corresponding compounds of the formula IVb, wherein Q, has the meaning of carbonyl, which may further, by reaction with corresponding ylide reagents, result in a prolongation of the chain and in the formation of an alkenyl substituent with carbonyl or ester groups as disclosed in HR patent application No. 20000310.<br>
Besides the reactions mentioned above, the compounds of the formula I may be prepared by transforming other compounds of the formula I and it is to be understood that the present invention also comprises such compounds and processes. A special example of a change of a functional group is the reaction of the aldehyde group with chosen phosphorous ylides resulting in a prolongation of the chain and the formation of an alkeny] substituent with carbonyl or ester groups as disclosed in HR patent application No. 20000310. These reactions are carried out in solvents such as benzene, toluene or hexane at elevated temperature (most frequently at boiling temperature).<br>
By reacting the compounds of the formula IVa with 1-alkyne in an alkaline medium (such as sodium amide in ammonia), the compounds of the formula I, wherein Q] is -C=C-, are obtained. The reaction conditions of this process are disclosed in the literature. At similar reaction conditions (nucleophilic substitution) various ether, thioether or amine derivatives may be prepared.<br>
The formylation of the compounds of the formula I by processes such as e.g. Vilsmeier acylation (US 4,267,184) or reaction of /7-BuLi and N.N-dimethylformamide is a further general example of a transformation. The reaction conditions of these processes are well-known in the literature.<br><br>
By hydrolysis of the compounds of the formula I having nitrile, amide or ester groups, there may be prepared compounds with a carboxyl group, which are suitable intermediates for the preparation of other compounds with novel functional groups such as e.g. esters, amides, halides, anhydrides, alcohols or amines.<br>
Oxidation or reduction reactions are a further possibility of the change of substituents in the compounds of the formula I. Most frequently used oxidation agents are peroxides (hydrogen peroxide, m-chloroperbenzoic acid or benzoyl peroxide) or permanganate, chromate or perchlorate ions. Thus e.g. by the oxidation of an alcohol group by pyridinyl dichromate or pyridinyl chlorochromate, an aldehyde group is formed, which group may be converted to a carboxyl group by further oxidation.<br>
By a selective oxidation of alkylthio group, alkylsulfinyl or alkylsulfonyl groups may be prepared.<br>
By the reduction of the compounds with a nitro group, the preparation of amino compounds is made possible. The reaction is carried out under usual conditions of catalytic hydrogenation or electrochemically. By catalytic hydrogenation using palladium on carbon, alkenyl substituents may be converted to alkyl ones or nitrile group can be converted to aminoalkyl.<br>
Various substituents of the aromatic structure in the compounds of the formula I may be introduced by standard substitution reactions or by usual changes of individual functional groups. Examples of such reactions are aromatic substitutions, alkylations, halogenation, hydroxylation as well as oxidation or reduction of substituents. Reagents and reaction conditions are known from the literature. Thus e.g. by aromatic substitution a nitro group is introduced in the presence of concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid. By using acyl halides or alkyl halides, the introduction of an acyl group or an alkyl group is made possible. The reaction is carried out in the presence of Lewis acids such as aluminum- or iron-trichloride in conditions of Friedel-Cratts<br><br>
reaction. By the reduction of the nitro group, an amino group is obtained, which is by the reaction of diazotizing converted to a suitable starting group, which may be replaced with one of the following groups: H, CN, OH, Hal.<br>
In order to prevent undesired interaction in chemical reactions, it is often necessary to protect certain groups such as e.g. hydroxy, amino, thio or carboxy. For this purpose a great number of protecting groups may be used (Green TW, Wuts PGH, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, 1999) and the choice, use and elimination thereof are conventional methods in chemical synthesis.<br>
A convenient protection for amino or alkylamino groups are groups such as e.g. alkanoyl (acetyl), alkoxycarbonyl (methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or tert-butoxycarbonyl); aryl methoxycarbonyl (benzyloxycarbonyl), aroyl (benzoyl) or alkylsilyl (trimethylsilyl or trimethylsilylethoxymethyl) groups. The conditions of removing a protecting group depend upon the choice and the characteristics of this group. Thus e.g. acyl groups such as alkanoyl, alkoxycarbonyl or aroyl may be eliminated by hydrolysis in the presence of a base (sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide), tert-butoxycarbonyl or alkylsilyl (trimethylsilyl) may be eliminated by treatment with a suitable acid (hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric or trifluoroacetic acid), whereas arylmethoxycarbonyl group (benzyloxycarbonyl) may be eliminated by hydrogenation using a catalyst such as palladium on carbon.<br>
Salts of the compounds of the formula I may be prepared by generally known processes such as e.g. by reacting the compounds of the formula I with a corresponding base or acid in an appropriate solvent or solvent mixture e.g. ethers (diethylether) or alcohols (ethanol, propanol or isopropanol).<br>
Another object of the present invention concerns the use of the present compounds in the therapy of inflammatory diseases and conditions, especially all diseases and conditions induced by excessive TNF-a and IL-1 secretion.<br><br>
Inhibitors of production of cytokins or inflammation mediators, which are the object of the present invention, or pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof may be used in production of drugs for the treatment and prophylaxis of any pathological condition or disease induced by excessive unregulated production of cytokins or inflammation mediators, which drugs should contain an effective dose of said inhibitors.<br>
The present invention specifically relates to an effective dose of TNF-a inhibitor, which may be determined by usual methods.<br>
Further, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical formulation containing an effective non-toxic dosis of the present compounds as well as pharrnaceutically acceptable carriers or solvents.<br>
The preparation of pharmaceutical formulations may include blending, granulating, tabletting and dissolving ingredients, Chemical carriers may be solid or liquid. Solid carriers may he lactose, sucrose, talcum, gelatine, agar, pectin, magnesium stearate, fatty acids etc. Liquid carriers may be syrups, oils such as olive oil, sunflower oil or soya bean oil, water etc. Similarly, the carrier may also contain a component for a sustained release of the active component such as e.g. glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate. Various forms of pharmaceutical formulations may be used. Thus, if a solid carrier is used, these forms may be tablets, hard gelatine capsules, powder or granules, which may be administered in capsules per os. The amount of the solid carrier may vary, but it is mainly from 25 mg to 1 g. If a liquid carrier is used, the formulation would be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatine capsules, sterile injectable liquids such as ampoules or non-aqueous liquid suspensions.<br>
Compounds according to the present invention may be applied per os, parenterally, locally, intranasally, intrarectally and intravaginally. The parenteral route herein means   intravenous,   intramuscular   and   subcutaneous   applications.   Appropriate<br><br>
formulations of the present compounds may be used in the prophylaxis as well as in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and conditions induced by an excessive unregulated production of cytokins or inflammation mediators, primarily TNF-a. They comprise e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis and other arthritic pathological conditions and diseases, eczemas, psoriasis and other inflammatory skin conditions, inflammatory eye diseases, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and asthma.<br>
The inhibitory action of the present compounds upon TNF-a and IL-1 secretion was determined by the following in vitro and in vivo experiments:<br>
Determination of TNF-a and IL-1 secretion in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro<br>
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were prepared from heparinized whole blood after separating PBMC on Ficoll-Paqueâ¢Plus (Amersham-Pharmacia). To determine the TNF-a level, 3.5-5xl04 cells were cultivated in a total volume of 200 p.1 for 18 to 24 hours on microtitre plates with a flat bottom (96 wells, Falcon) in RPMI 1640 medium, into which there were added 10% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum, Biowhittaker) previously inactivated at 56cC/30 min, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 mg/ml of streptomycin and 20 mM HEPES (GIBCO). The cells were incubated at 37Â°C in an atmosphere with 5% C02 and 90% humidity. In a negative control the cells were cultivated only in the medium (NC), whereas in a positive control TNF-a secretion was triggered by adding 1 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharides (LPS, E. coii serotype 011LB4, SIGMA) (PC). The effect of the tested substances upon TNF-a secretion was investigated after adding them into cultures of cells stimulated by LPS (TS). The TNF-a level in the cell supernatant was determined by ELISA procedure according to the suggestions of the producer (R&amp;D Systems). The test sensitivity was

conditions and with the same number of cells and the same concentration of the stimulus by ELISA procedure (R&amp;D Systems). The percentage of inhibition of TNF-ct or IL-1 production was calculated by the equation:<br>
% inhibition = [1- (TS-NC)/(PC-NC)] * 100.<br>
The IC-50 value was defined as the substance concentration, at which 50% of TNF-a production were inhibited.<br>
Compounds showing IC-50 with 20 \iM or lower concentrations are active.<br>
Determination of TNF-a and IL-1 secretion in mouse peritoneal macrophages in<br>
vitro<br>
In order to obtain peritoneal macrophages, Balb/C mouse strain males, age 8 to 12 weeks, were injected i.p. with 300 ug of zymosan (SIGMA) dissolved in a phosphate buffer (PBS) in a total volume of 0.1 ml/mouse. After 24 hours the mice were euthanized according to the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act. The peritoneal cavity was washed with a sterile physiological solution (5 ml). The obtained peritoneal macrophages were washed twice with a sterile physiological solution and, after the last centrifugation (350 g/10 min), resuspended in RPMI 1640, into which 10% of FBS were added. In order to determine TNF-a secretion, 5xl04 cells/well were cultivated in a total volume of 200 u,l for 18 to 24 hours on microtitre plates with a flat bottom (96 wells, Falcon) in RPMI 1640 medium, into which 10% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum, Biowhittaker) inactivated by heat, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 mg/ml of streptomycin, 20 mM HEPES and 50 p.M 2-mercaptoethanol (all of GIBCO) were added. The cells were incubated at 37Â°C in an atmosphere with 5% C02 and 90% humidity. In a negative control the cells were cultivated only in a medium (NC), whereas in a positive control the TNF-a secretion was triggered by adding 10 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharides (LPS, E. coli serotype 011LB4, SIGMA) (PC). The effect of<br><br>
the substances upon the TNF-ct secretion was investigated after adding them into cultures of cells stimulated with LPS (TS). The TNF-a level in the cell supernatant was determined by ELISA procedure specific for TNF-a and TL-1 (R&amp;D Systems, Biosource). The percentage of inhibition of TNF-a or IL-1 production was calculated by the equation: % inhibition = [1- (TS-NC)/(PC-NC)] * 100.<br>
The IC-50 value was defined as the substance concentration, at which 50% of TNF-a production were inhibited.<br>
Compounds showing IC-50 with 10 |aM or lower concentrations are active.<br>
In vivo model of LPS-induced excessive TNF-a or IL-1 secretion in mice<br>
TNF-a or IL-1 secretion in mice was induced according to the already disclosed method (Badger AM et al., J. Pharmac. Env. Therap., 1996, 279:1453-1461). Balb/C males, age 8 to 12 weeks, in groups of 6 to 10 animals were used. The animals were treated p.o. either with a solvent only (in negative and in positive controls) or with solutions of substances 30 minutes prior to i.p. treatment with LPS (E. coli serotype 0111:B4, Sigma) in a dosis of 1-25 (ig/animal. Two hours later the animals were euthanized by means of i.p. Roumpun (Bayer) and Ketanest (Parke-Davis) injection. A blood sample of each animal was taken into a Vacutainer tube (Becton Dickinson) and the plasma was separated according to the producer's instructions. The TNF-a level in the plasma was determined by ELISA procedure (Biosource, R&amp;D Systems) according to the producer's instructions. The test sensitivity was 
 <br>
Active are the compounds showing 30% or more inhibition of TNF-a production at a dosis of 10 mg/kg.<br>
Writhing assay for analgetic activity<br>
In this assay pain is induced by the injection of an irritant, most frequently acetic acid, into the peritoneal cavity of mice. Animals react with characteristic writhings, which has given the name to the assay (Collier HOJ et al, Pharmac. Chemother., 1968, 32:295-310; Fukawa K et al., J. Pharmacol. Meth ., 1980, 4:251-259; Schweizer A et al., Agents Actions, 1988, 23:29-31). The assay is convenient for the determination of analgetic activity of compounds. Procedure: male Balb/C mice (Charles River, Italy), age 8 to 12 weeks, were used. A control group received methyl cellulose p.o. 30 minutes prior to i.p. application of acetic acid in a concentration of 0.6%, whereas test groups received standard (acetylsalicyiic acid) or test substances in methyl cellulose p.o. 30 minutes prior to i.p. application of 0.6% acetic acid (volume 0.1 ml/10 g). The mice were placed individually under glass funnels and the number of writhings was registered for 20 minutes for each animal. The percentage of writhing inhibition was calculated according to the equation:<br>
% inhibition = (mean value of number of writhings in the control group - number of writhings in the test group)/number of writhings in the control group * 100.<br>
Active are the compounds showing such analgetic activity as acetylsalicyiic acid or better.<br>
In vivo model of LPS-induced shock in mice<br>
Male Balb/C mice (Charles River, Italy), age 8 to 12 weeks, were used. LPS isolated from Serrathie marcessans (Sigma, L-6136) was diluted in sterile physiological solution. The first LPS injection was administered intradermally in a dosis of 4 ug/mouse.  18 to 24 hours later, LPS was administered i.v. in a dosis of 90-200<br><br>
u.g/mouse. A control group received two LPS injections as disclosed above. The test groups received substances p.o. half an hour prior to each LPS application. Survival after 24 hours was observed.<br>
Active are the substances at which the survival at a dosis of 30 mg/kg was 40% or more.<br>
