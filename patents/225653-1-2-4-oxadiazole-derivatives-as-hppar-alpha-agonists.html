				<td>1,2,4-OXADIAZOLE DERIVATIVES AS HPPAR ALPHA AGONISTS<br>
The present invention relates to certain novel compounds. In particular,<br>
the present invention relates to compounds that activate the alpha subtype of<br>
the human peroxisome proliferator activated receptor ("hPPAR alpha"). The<br>
present invention also relates to methods for preparing the compounds, their<br>
use in medicine, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and methods for<br>
the prevention or treatment of PPAR mediated diseases or conditions.<br>
Several independent risk factors have been associated with<br>
cardiovascular disease. These include hypertension, increased fibrinogen<br>
levels, high levels of triglycerides, elevated LDL cholesterol, elevated total<br>
cholesterol, and low levels of HDL cholesterol. HMG CoA reductase inhibitors<br>
("statins") are useful for treating conditions characterized by high LDL-c levels.<br>
It has been shown that lowering LDL-c is not sufficient for reducing the risk of<br>
cardiovascular disease in some patients, particularly those with normal LDL-c<br>
levels. This population pool is identified by the independent risk factor of low<br>
HDL-c. The increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with low HDL-c<br>
levels has not yet been successfully addressed by drug therapy (i.e., currently<br>
there are no drugs on the market that are useful for raising HDL-c &gt;40%).<br>
(Bisgaier, C. L; Pape, M. E. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1998, 4, 53-70).<br>
Syndrome X (including metabolic syndrome) is loosely defined as a<br>
collection of abnormalities including hyperinsuinlemia, obesity, elevated levels of<br>
trigylcerides, uric acid, fibrinogen, small dense LDL-c particles, and plasminogen<br>
activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), and decreased levels of HDL-c.<br>
NIDDM is described as insulin resistance which in turn causes<br>
anomalous glucose output and a decrease in glucose uptake by skeletal<br>
muscle. These factors eventually lead to impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and<br>
hyperinsulinemia.<br>
Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPARs) are orphan<br>
receptors belonging to the steroid/retinoid receptor superfamily of ligand-<br>
activated transcription factors. See, for example, Willson, T. M. and Wahli, W.,<br>
Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol (1997), Vol. 1, pp 235-241.<br>
Three mammalian Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors have<br>
been isolated and termed PPAR-alpha, PPAR-gamma, and PPAR-delta (also<br>
known as NUC1 or PPAR-beta). These PPARs regulate expression of target<br>
genes by binding to DNA sequence elements, termed PPAR response elements<br>
(PPRE). To date, PPRE's have been identified in the enhancers of a number of<br>
genes encoding proteins that regulate lipid metabolism suggesting that PPARs<br>
play a pivotal role in the adipogenic signaling cascade and lipid homeostasis (H.<br>
Keller and W. Wahli, Trends Endocrin. Met 291-296, 4 (1993)).<br>
Certain compounds that activate or otherwise interact with one or more of<br>
the PPARs have been implicated in the regulation of triglyceride and cholesterol<br>
levels in animal models. See, for example, U.S. Patents 5,847,008 (Doebber et<br>
al.) and 5,859,051 (Adams et al.) and PCT publications WO 97/28149<br>
(Leibowitz et al.) and WO99/04815 (Shimokawa et al.). PCT patent publication<br>
WO 00/08002 discloses certain novel compounds which exhibit activation,<br>
including dual agonist activity, to PPARgamma and PPARalpha. These<br>
compounds are indicated to be useful for the treatment of type 2 diabetes<br>
mellitus and other diseases mediated by PPARgamma and PPARalpha.<br>
Fibrates are a class of drugs which may lower serum triglycerides 20-<br>
50%, lower LDL-c 10-15%, shift the LDL particle size from the more atherogenic<br>
small dense to normal dense LDL-c, and increase HDL-c 10-15%. Experimental<br>
evidence indicates that the effects of fibrates on serum lipids are mediated<br>
through activation of PPAR alpha. See, for example, B. Staels et al., Curr.<br>
Pharm. Des., 1-14, 3 (1), (1997). Activation of PPAR alpha results in<br>
transcription of enzymes that increase fatty acid catabolism and decrease de-<br>
novo fatty acid synthesis in the liver resulting in decreased triglyceride synthesis<br>
and VLDL-c production/secretion. In addition, PPAR alpha activation decreases<br>
production of apoC-lll. Reduction in apoC-lll, an inhibitor of LPL activity,<br>
increases clearance of VLDL-c. See, for example, J. Auwerx et al.,<br>
Atherosclerosis, (Shannon, Irel.), S29-S37, 124 (Suppl), (1996). PPAR alpha<br>
ligands may be useful for the treatment of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular<br>
disorders, see Fruchart, J.C., Duriez, P., and Staels, B., Curr. Opin. Lipidol.<br>
(1999), Vol 10, pp 245-257.<br>

of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and hydrolysable<br>
esters thereof:<br>
wherein:<br>
X1 is O or S;<br>
X2 is O or S;<br>
n is 1-3;<br>
One of Y and Z is N, and the other is O;<br>
R1 and R2 are independently halogen, H, CF3, OCH3 or C1.3 alkyl;<br>
Each R3 independently is halogen, CF3, C1-6 straight or branched alkyl;<br>
R4 and R5 are independently H or C1-3 alkyl.<br>
y is O, 1,2, 3, 4 or 5.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention discloses a method for<br>
prevention or treatment of a disease or condition mediated by one or more<br>
human PPAR alpha, gamma or delta ("hPPARs") comprising administration of a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention. hPPAR<br>

diabetic dyslipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia, syndrome X (as defined in this<br>
application this embraces metabolic syndrome), heart failure,<br>
hypercholesteremia, cardiovascular disease including atherosclerosis,<br>
arteriosclerosis, and hypertriglyceridemia, type II diabetes mellitus, type I<br>
diabetes, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, inflammation, epithelial,<br>
hyperproliferative diseases including eczema and psoriasis and conditions<br>
associated with the lung or gut and regulation of appetite and food intake in<br>
subjects suffering from disorders such as obesity, anorexia bulimia, and<br>
anorexia nervosa. In particular, the compounds of this invention are useful in<br>
the treatment and prevention of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and<br>
conditions including atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and<br>
mixed dyslipidaemia.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising a compound of the invention, preferably in association<br>
with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a compound of the<br>
invention for use in therapy, and in particular, in human medicine.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides the use of a compound<br>
of the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a<br>
hPPAR mediated disease or condition.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of treatment<br>
of a patent suffering from a hPPAR mediated disease or condition comprising<br>
the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the<br>
invention.<br>
As used herein, "a compound of the invention" means a compound of<br>
formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or hydrolyzable ester<br>
thereof.<br>
While hydrolyzable esters are included in the scope of this invention, the<br>
acids are preferred because the data suggests that while the esters are useful<br>
compounds, it may actually be the acids to which they hydrolyze that are the<br>
active compounds. Esters that hydrolyze readily can produce the carboxylic<br>
acid in the assay conditions or in vivo. Generally the carboxylic acid is active in<br>
both the binding and transient transfection assays, while the ester does not<br>
usually bind well but is active in the transient transfection assay presumably due<br>
to hydrolysis. Preferred hydrolysable esters are C1-6 alkyl esters wherein the<br>
alkyl group may be straight chain or branched chain. Methyl or ethyl esters are<br>
more preferred.<br>
Preferably X1 is O.<br>
Preferably X2 is O.<br>
Preferably Z is N.<br>
Preferably n represents 1.<br>
Preferably R1 and R2 independently represent H, halogen, methyl or OCH3.<br>
More preferably one of R1 and R2 is H. In one particular preferred aspect, R1<br>
represents CH3 and R2 represents H. In another particular preferred aspect,<br>
both R1 and R2 represent H.<br>
Preferably y is 1 and R3 is preferably in the para position. Preferably R3 is C1-6<br>
straight or branched chain alkyl or CF3.<br>
Preferably R4 and R5 are both CH3.<br>
While the preferred groups for each variable have generally been listed<br>
above separately for each variable, preferred compounds of this invention<br>
include those in which several or each variable in formula (I) is selected from the<br>
preferred, more preferred, or most preferred groups for each variable.<br>
Therefore, this invention is intended to include all combinations of preferred,<br>
more preferred, and most preferred groups.<br>
The hPPAR agonists of formula (I) may be agonists of only one type<br>
("selective agonists"), agonists for two PPAR subtypes ("dual agonists"), or<br>
agonists for all three subtypes ("pan agonists"). As used herein, by "agonist", or<br>
"activating compound", or "activator", or the like, is meant those compounds<br>
which have a pKi of at least 6.0 preferably at least 7.0 to the relevant PPAR, for<br>
example hPPARalpha in the binding assay described below, and which achieve<br>
at least 50% activation of the relevant PPAR relative to the appropriate indicated<br>
positive control in the transfection assay described below at concentrations of<br>
10-5 M or less. More preferably, the agonists of this invention achieve 50%<br>
activation of at least one human PPAR in the relevant transfection assay at<br>
concentrations of 10-6 M or less. Preferably, the compounds of formula (I) are<br>
hPPAR agonists. More preferably the compounds are hPPARalpha agonists.<br>

phenoxyj-propionic acid and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and<br>
hydrolysable esters thereof.<br>
Most preferably, the compounds of formula (I) are selective hPPAR alpha<br>
agonists. As used herein, a "selective hPPAR alpha agonist" is a hPPAR alpha<br>
agonist whose EC50 for PPAR alpha is at least 10 fold lower than its EC50 for<br>
PPAR gamma and PPAR delta. Such selective compounds may be referred to<br>
as "10-fold selective." EC50 is defined in the transfection assay described below<br>
and is the concentration at which a compound achieves 50% of its maximum<br>
activity. Most preferred compounds are greater than 100-fold selective<br>
hPPAR alpha agonists (see Table 1).<br>
It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the compounds<br>
of the present invention may also be utilized in the form of a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt or solvate thereof. The physiologically acceptable salts of the<br>
compounds of formula (I) include conventional salts formed from<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acids or bases as well as<br>
quaternary ammonium acid addition salts. More specific examples of suitable<br>
acid salts include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, nitric,<br>
perchloric, fumaric, acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, formic, lactic, maleic,<br>
tartaric, citric, palmoic, malonic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic,<br>
salicylic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, naphthalene-2-sulfonic,<br>
benzenesulfonic hydroxynaphthoic, hydroiodic, malic, steroic, tannic and the<br>
like. Other acids such as oxalic, while not in themselves pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable, may be useful in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in<br>
obtaining the compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts. More specific examples of suitable basic salts include sodium, lithium,<br>
potassium, magnesium, aluminium, calcium, zinc, N,N'-<br>
dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine,<br>
ethyienediamine, N-methylglucamine and procaine salts. Those skilled in the art<br>
of organic chemistry will appreciate that many organic compounds can form<br>
complexes with solvents in which they are reacted or from which they are<br>
precipitated or crystallized. These complexes are known as "solvents". For<br>
example, a complex with water is known as a "hydrate". Solvates of the<br>
compound of formula (I) are within the scope of the invention. References<br>
hereinafter to a compound according to the invention include both compounds<br>
of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates.<br>
The compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivatives are conveniently administered in the form of pharmaceutical<br>
compositions. Such compositions may conveniently be presented for use in<br>
conventional manner in admixture with one or more physiologically acceptable<br>
carriers or excipients.<br>
While it is possible that compounds of the present invention may be<br>
therapeutically administered as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present the<br>
active ingredient as a pharmaceutical formulation. The carrier(s) must be<br>
"acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the<br>
formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further provides for a pharmaceutical<br>
formulation comprising a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt or solvate thereof together with one or more pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers therefore and, optionally, other therapeutic and/or<br>
prophylactic ingredients.<br>
The formulations include those suitable for oral, parenteral (including<br>
subcutaneous e.g. by injection or by depot tablet, intradermal, intrathecal,<br>
intramuscular e.g. by depot and intravenous), rectal and topical (including<br>
dermal, buccal and sublingual) administration although the most suitable route<br>
may depend upon for example the condition and disorder of the recipient. The<br>
formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be<br>
prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods<br>
include the step of bringing into association the compounds ("active ingredient")<br>
with the carrier, which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In<br>
general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into<br>
association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid<br>
carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired<br>
formulation.<br>
Formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented as<br>
discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets (e.g. chewable tablets in<br>
particular for paediatric administration) each containing a predetermined amount<br>
of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension<br>
in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid<br>
emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be<br>
presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.<br>
A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or<br>
more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by<br>
compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form<br>
such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a other conventional<br>
excipients such as binding agents, (for example, syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol,<br>
tragacanth, mucilage of starch or polyvinylpyrrolidone), fillers (for example,<br>
lactose, sugar, microcrystalline cellulose, maize-starch, calcium phosphate or<br>
sorbitol), lubricants (for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, talc,<br>
polyethylene glycol or silica), disintegrants (for example, potato starch or sodium<br>
starch glycollate) or wetting agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate. Moulded<br>
tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the<br>
powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may<br>
optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or<br>
controlled release of the active ingredient therein. The tablets may be coated<br>
according to methods well known in the art.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the present invention may be<br>
incorporated into oral liquid preparations such as aqueous or oily suspensions,<br>
solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, for example. Moreover, formulations<br>
containing these compounds may be presented as a dry product for constitution<br>
with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may<br>
contain conventional additives such as suspending agents such as sorbitol<br>
syrup, methyl cellulose, glucose/sugar syrup, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose,<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminum stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats;<br>
emulsifying agents such as lecithin, sorbitan mono-oleate or acacia; non-<br>
aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils) such as almond oil,<br>
fractionated coconut oil, oily esters, propylene glycol or ethyl alcohol; and<br>
preservatives such as methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid.<br>
Such preparations may also be formulated as suppositories, e.g., containing<br>
conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-<br>
aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers,<br>
bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of<br>
the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions<br>
which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.<br>
The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers,<br>
for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried<br>
(lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of a sterile liquid carrier, for<br>
example, water-for-injection, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous<br>
injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders,<br>
granules and tablets of the kind previously described.<br>
Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository<br>
with the usual carriers such as cocoa butter, hard fat or polyethylene glycol.<br>
Formulations for topical administration in the mouth, for example buccally<br>
or sublingually, include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavoured<br>
basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the<br>
active ingredient in a basis such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.<br>
The compounds may also be formulated as depot preparations. Such<br>
long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example<br>
subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for<br>
example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or<br>
hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion<br>
exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly<br>
soluble salt.<br>
In addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the<br>
formulations may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to<br>
the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral<br>
administration may include flavouring agents.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that reference herein to<br>
treatment extends to prophylaxis as well as the treatment of established<br>
diseases or symptoms. Moreover, it will be appreciated that the amount of a<br>
compound of the invention required for use in treatment will vary with the nature<br>
of the condition being treated and the age and the condition of the patient and<br>
will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. In<br>
general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in<br>
the range of 0.02-5000 mg per day, preferably 1-1500 mg per day. The desired<br>
dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses<br>
administered at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more<br>
sub-doses per day. The formulations according to the invention may contain<br>
between 0.1-99% of the active ingredient, conveniently from 30-95% for tablets<br>
and capsules and 3-50% for liquid preparations.<br>
The compound of formula (I) for use in the instant invention may be used<br>
in combination with other therapeutic agents for example, statins and/or other<br>
lipid lowering drugs for example MTP inhibitors and LDLR upregulators. The<br>
compounds of the invention may also be used in combination with antidiabetic<br>
agents, e.g. metformin, sulfonylureas and/or PPAR agonists (for example PPAR<br>
gamma agonists, including thiazolidinediones such as e.g. Pioglitazone and<br>
Rosiglitazone) or PPAR alpha/gamma agonists, or PPAR delta agonists wherein<br>
the PPAR delta agonists may be selective agonists for PPAR delta, have<br>
agonist activity at PPAR alpha or gamma (dual agonists) or activity at PPAR<br>
alpha and gamma (Pan agonists). The compounds may also be used in<br>
combination with antihypertensive agents such as calcium channel antagonists<br>
and ACE inhibitors. The invention thus provides in a further aspect the use of a<br>
combination comprising a compound of formula (I) with a further therapeutic<br>
agent in the treatment of a hPPAR mediated disease.<br>
When the compounds of formula (I) are used in combination with other<br>
therapeutic agents, the compounds may be administered either sequentially or<br>
simultaneously by any convenient route.<br>
The combinations referred to above may conveniently be presented for<br>
use in the form of a pharmaceutical formulation and thus pharmaceutical<br>
formulations comprising a combination as defined above optimally together with<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient comprise a further aspect of<br>
the invention. The individual components of such combinations may be<br>
administered either sequentially or simultaneously in separate or combined<br>
pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
When combined in the same formulation it will be appreciated that the<br>
two compounds must be stable and compatible with each other and the other<br>
components of the formulation and may be formulated for administration. When<br>
formulated separately they may be provided in any convenient formulation,<br>
conveniently in such a manner as are known for such compounds in the art.<br>
When a compound of formula (I) is used in combination with a second<br>
therapeutic agent active against the same hPPAR mediated disease, the dose<br>
of each compound may differ from that when the compound is used alone.<br>
Appropriate doses will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
Compounds of this invention may be conveniently prepared by a general<br>
process wherein a moiety like (A) is coupled to a chloride (B) using a suitable<br>
non nucleophilic amine. Note that this synthesis is preferably carried out with the<br>
acid group protected by R although R may also represent H. Preferably, R is<br>
C1-6 alkyl (straight chain or branched chain) which can be hydrolyzed off to give<br>
an acid of Formula (I), or if readily hydrolyzable, the resulting ester can be<br>
administered.<br>
For example, when X1 is O, X2 is O, Y is O, Z is N, and R3 is para-CF3: a<br>
preferred synthesis the oxadiazoles is:<br>
The coupling reaction between intermediate A and B may be performed<br>
in the presence of a suitable base such as potassium carbonate, cesium<br>
carbonate , in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile or acetone preferably in<br>
the temperature range room temperature to 80°C, in a suitable solvent such as<br>
acetone or acetonitrile.<br>
When X is O, X2 is O, Y is N, Z is O, and R3 is para-iPr: a preferred<br>
synthesis the oxadiazoles is:<br>
Preferably, R is C1-6 alkyl which can be hydrolyzed off to give an acid of<br>
Formula (I), or if readily hydrolyzable, the resulting ester can be administered.<br>
The synthesis of intermediate of type A when X=O, R= R1=CH3, R2=H is<br>
illustrated below.<br>
Some of the intermediates of type B are commercially available while<br>
others can be synthesized by techniques apparent to a person skilled in the art.<br>
The synthesis of intermediates of type B are illustrated below.<br>
Cyclisation may be performed in a suitable solvent such as xylene or<br>
toluene at reflux.<br>

WO200140207-A1.<br>
(iii) 5-{4-f2-(Methvl-pyridin-2-vl-amino)-ethoxv]-benzvl}-thiazolidine-<br>
2.4-dione<br>
This compound (also referred to as rosiglitazone) was used as a PPAR<br>
gamma reference in the transfection assay described below and was prepared<br>
according to method reported in J.Med.Chem. 1994, 37(23), 3977.<br>
Binding Assay:<br>
Compounds were tested for their ability to bind to hPPAR gamma<br>
hPPAR alpha, or PPAR delta using a Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA). The<br>
PPAR ligand binding domain (LBD) was expressed in E. coli as polyHis tagged<br>
fusion proteins and purified. The LBD was then labeled with biotin and<br>
immobilized on streptavidin-modified scintillation proximity beads. The beads<br>
were then incubated with a constant amount of the appropriate radioligand (3H-<br>
BRL 49653 for PPAR gamma, radiolabelled 2-(4-(2-(2,3-Ditritio-1-heptyl-3-(2,4-<br>
difluorophenyl)ureido)ethyl)phenoxy)-2-methylbutanoic acid for hPPAR alpha<br>
(see WO 00/08002) and labelled GW 2433 (see Brown, P. J et al . Chem. Biol.<br>
1997, 4, 909-918 for the structure and synthesis of this ligand) for PPAR delta)<br>
and variable concentrations of test compound, and after equilibration the<br>
radioactivity bound to the beads was measured by a scintillation counter. The<br>
amount of nonspecific binding, as assessed by control wells containing 50 mMof<br>
the corresponding unlabeled ligand, was subtracted from each data point. For<br>
each compound tested, plots of ligand concentration vs. CPM of radioligand<br>
bound were constructed and apparent K| values were estimated from nonlinear<br>
least squares fit of the data assuming simple competitive binding. The details of<br>
this assay have been reported elsewhere (see, Blanchard, S. G. et. al.<br>
Development of a Scintillation Proximity Assay for Peroxisome Proliferator-<br>
Activated Receptor gamma Ligand Binding Domain. Anal. Biochem. 1998, 257,<br>
112-119).<br>
Transfection assay:<br>
Compounds were screened for functional potency in transient<br>
transfection assays in CV-1 cells for their ability to activate the PPAR subtypes<br>
(transactivation assay). A previously established chimeric receptor system was<br>
utilized to allow comparison of the relative transcriptional activity of the receptor<br>
subtypes on the same target gene and to prevent endogenous receptor<br>
activation from complicating the interpretation of results. See, for example,<br>
Lehmann, J. M.; Moore, L. B.; Smith-Oliver, T. A.; Wilkison, W. O.; Willson, T.<br>
M.; Kliewer, S. A., An antidiabetic thiazolidinedione is a high affinity ligand for<br>
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor y (PPARy), J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270,<br>
12953-6. The ligand binding domains for murine and human PPAR alpha,<br>
PPAR gamma, and PPAR delta were each fused to the yeast transcription<br>
factor GAL4 DNA binding domain. CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with<br>
expression vectors for the respective PPAR chimera along with a reporter<br>
construct containing five copies of the GAL4 DNA binding site driving expression<br>
of secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (SPAP) and p-galactosidase. After<br>
16 h, the medium was exchanged to DME medium supplemented with 10%<br>
delipidated fetal calf serum and the test compound at the appropriate<br>
concentration. After an additional 24 h, cell extracts were prepared and<br>
assayed for alkaline phosphatase and p-galactosidase activity. Alkaline<br>
phosphatase activity was corrected for transfection efficiency using the b-<br>
galactosidase activity as an internal standard (see, for example, Kliewer, S. A.,<br>
et. al. Cell 83, 813-819 (1995)). Rosiglitazone (BRL 49653) was used as a<br>
positive control in the hPPAR gamma assay. The positive control in the hPPAR<br>
alpha assays was 2-methyl-2-[4-{[(4-methyl-2-[4-trifluoromethylphenyl]-thiazol-5-<br>
yl-carbonyl)amino]methyl}-phenoxy]propionic acid. The positive control for<br>
PPAR delta assays was 2-{2-methyl-4-[({4-methyl-2-{trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,3-<br>
thiazol-5-yl}methyl)sulfanyl]phenoxy}acetic acid.<br>
