				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a woven webbing, particularly for automotive seat belts.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Woven webbing, also for use in automotive seat belts, is known from a wealth of publications and practical<br>
examples. In certain cases items are attached to one or more points of the webbing, whereby depending on<br>
how the item are attached this could result in the material of the webbing being weakened, thus resulting in<br>
the specified tensile strength of the webbing possibly no longer being satisfied over the full width in the<br>
scope as demanded. Such items are, for instance, retainer buttons for preventing movement, for example of<br>
a buckle, beyond the point of attachment. In addition, there are, for example, also microphones for<br>
automotive hands-off telephone systems which are attached to seat belts at one or more points. It is in this<br>
arrangement that the attachment damages threads, particularly warp threads, of the webbing to such an<br>
extent that the tensile strength of the webbing is reduced.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to propose a woven webbing, particularly for automotive seat belts which is<br>
suitable for the attachment of applications in the run of the woven webbing, as well as such seat belt<br>
themselves in avoiding or at least greatly reducing the disadvantages known from prior art.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This object is achieved with a woven webbing as disclosed hereunder. The first group of textile warp<br>
threads having a higher extensibility is provided to advantage in a portion in which application items are to<br>
be attached. Because of the higher extensibility of the corresponding textile warp threads any weakening<br>
and thus reduction in the tensile strength of the warp threads caused by the application items is now<br>
compensated such that both groups of warp threads feature the necessary tensile strength when the webbing<br>
is stressed. In this arrangement, the difference in the extensibility of the textile warp threads of the first<br>
group and the textile warp threads of the second group is selected to advantage so that when exposed to<br>
tensile stress all threads counter the tensile force uniformly. If, for instance, laser welding an application<br>
item, e.g. a microphone, to the woven webbing in accordance with the invention results in a weakening of<br>
the warp threads of the first group, this weakening now has no effect on proper functioning of the woven<br>
webbing, since the selected high extensibility of the warp threads of the first group compensates any<br>
weakening of the tensile strength.<br>
In one advantageous further embodiment of the invention the woven webbing comprises warp threads of a<br>
third group comprising electrically conductive means. This now makes it possible to power electric devices<br>
attached to some location of the woven webbing in the sense of the warp threads of the first group; these<br>
electric devices may be, for example, microphones, sensors, controllers, and the like.<br>
In another advantageous further embodiment of the invention the warp threads of the first group comprises<br>
electrically conductive means in thus endowing the warp threads having a higher extensibility with a<br>
second function, namely the conduction of electricity. This combination of enhanced extensibility and<br>
conduction of electricity simplifies the structure of the woven webbing in accordance with the invention as<br>
a whole.<br>
In yet another advantageous further embodiment of the invention the electrically conductive means are<br>
electrically insulated at their surface. No, the electrically conductive means can be routed very close<br>
together because of the individual insulation of the warp threads instead<br><br>
of having to rely on insulation due to a spacing even with electrically conductive warp threads spaced as<br>
viewed in the weft direction. It has been discovered to advantage that varnish coating the electrically<br>
conductive means can now be produced very cost-effectively and reliably in even attaining a color-matched<br>
varnish coating.<br>
In a particularly advantageous further embodiment of the invention the woven webbing is configured so<br>
that the electrically conductive means are wound by the warp threads. This design of the warp threads<br>
would with electrically conductive means has major advantages, especially in contraction and/or stretching<br>
of the woven webbing. The electrically conductive means spirally wound around the warp threads in<br>
accordance with the invention, for example, conducting wire with a rectangular cross-section complies with<br>
the lengthwise movement of the warp threads in their longitudinal direction without themselves being<br>
exposed to any appreciable tensile strength possibly tearing the electrically conductive means out of place.<br>
The pitch in the windings can be advantageously tailored to the particularly application concerned.<br>
In one advantageous alternative in configuring the electrically conductive means arranged at the warp<br>
threads of the first group or third group it is now attained that a finely curled wire is arranged as the<br>
electrically conductive means within warp threads forming a staple common fibre. This design of the<br>
electrically conductive means also permits compensating contraction and/or stretching without ruining the<br>
electrically conductivity..<br>
In still another advantageous further embodiment of warp threads comprising electrically conductive means<br>
are "concealed" so-to-speak in the interior of the woven webbing. This has the major advantage that the<br>
electrically conductive means are now no longer visible whilst, on the other hand, being protected from<br>
wear and corrosion.<br>
In one additional advantageous further embodiment of the woven webbing in accordance with the invention<br>
one or more electrically device(s), especially microphone(s), sensor(s), controller(s) is/are applied to one or<br>
more locations in the region of the warp threads. This now makes it possible to apply an electrical device<br>
expediently for the application concerned at any location in the longitudinal run of the woven webbing; for<br>
example, a microphone for a hand-off telephone system, for a telephone or dictaphone, or a device for<br>
monitoring the health of the vehicle occupant such as pulse, temperature etc., or a lighting fixture or a<br>
loudspeaker.<br>
For a better appreciation of the invention it will now be detailed by wy of an example with reference to the<br>
drawings:<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:<br>
FIG, 1 is a plan view of a woven webbing in accordance with the invention shown simplified<br>
diagrammatically and on a greatly magnified scale<br>
FIG, 2 is the same view of the woven webbing as shown in FIG. 1, showing warp threads but with a<br>
threads but with a microphone attached.<br>
FIG. 3 is a view of a warp thread wound with a electrically conductive means on a greatly magnified<br>
scale<br><br>
Referring now to FIG. 1 there is illustrated in a view simplified diagrammatically a webbing<br>
10 having a width B, warp threads 2 of a certain extensibility running over the outer portions<br>
- in a number which as shown has merely been selected to be symbolic - whereas in the<br>
middle portion, selected in this case just as an example, warp threads 1 of greater<br>
extensibility than the warp threads 2 run. The very short portion of a webbing 10 in<br>
accordance with the invention shown in FIG. 1 has in this case a very broad middle portion,<br>
selected just as an example, in which warp threads 1 having a higher extensibility run. It will<br>
be appreciated that this illustration is shown exaggerated for the sake of clarity. In reality,<br>
such a webbing contains hundreds of warp threads over the width B of the webbing very<br>
much finer than the warp threads 1 and warp threads 2 as shown in FIG. 1. Merely for<br>
orientation of a device to be applied thereto is a circle identified by the reference numeral 5<br>
shown in the middle of the webbing 10, this being, of course, just a qualitative indication.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 2 there is illustrated the webbing 10 as already shown in FIG. 1, now,<br>
however, a microphone 5 being symbolically evident in the middle in the region of the warp<br>
threads 1 of high extensibility. The microphone 5 is connected via warp threads 6 belonging<br>
to the group of warp threads 1 but incorporating electrically conductive means 4. Shown as<br>
an example are two warp threads 6 having the same extensibility as the warp threads 1 but<br>
additionally provided with electrically conductive means 4, details of which are given in the<br>
following. As an alternative the microphone 5 shown as an example in FIG. 2 can be<br>
powered via warp threads 3 shown additionally inserted between the warp threads 1. This is<br>
intended to indicate how the warp threads 3 may likewise include electrically conductive<br>
means - not highlighted in this case - but not necessarily having cross-sections and<br>
parameters other than those of warp threads 1.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3 there is illustrated on a greatly magnified scale a warp thread 3 or 6,<br>
the latter belonging to the group of warp threads 1. The structure of the warp thread as<br>
shown in FIG. 3 as a short discontinued portion is illustrated just as a qualitative indication.<br>
A warp thread core 8 is provided with a rectangular cross-section - see the diagrammatic<br>
illustration to the left of the warp threads 6, 3 in FIG. 3 - the core 8 possibly being made of<br>
PET, for example, whereas the electrically conductive means 4 is selected from a favorable<br>
electrically conductive alloy.<br>
In an additional advantage aspect as shown in FIG. 3 on the left the electrically conductive<br>
means 4 is provided with an insulation 9 consisting of varnish, for example. Here too, the<br>
dimensions are roughly drawn merely qualitatively. The windings of the electrically<br>
conductive means 4, as shown in FIG. 3, have a pitch S, resulting in a spacing a between the<br>
individual windings in conjunction with the width of the electrically conductive means 4<br>
configured as a band. Depending on whether the webbing in accordance with the invention<br>
is extended or contracted as intended after or during weaving, a larger pitch S is selected<br>
when contracted, a smaller pitch S when extended resulting in the spacing a being set so that<br>
no buckling or rupture of the electrically conductive means 4 can materialize.<br>
In viewing the FIGs. as described above, the person skilled in the art will, of course,<br>
immediately appreciate that the weft threads of the webbing 10 in accordance with the<br>
invention are not shown for the sake of a better overview. But, of course, in reality the actual<br>
appearance of a webbing is often such that the warp threads determine the appearance of a<br>
webbing, since the weft threads usually are not at all evident. Contrary to how they are<br>
shown in FIG. 2, the warp threads with the electrically conductive means illustrated<br>
diagrammatically therein are actually embodied concealed in the interior of the webbing so<br><br>
that they are, for one thing, concealed from view and, for another, are protected from<br>
damage from without. In the example aspect as described in this case, warp threads 2 in each<br>
case are shown with electrically conductive means. In reality, however, considerably more<br>
such warp threads may be provided depending on the nature and quantity of the electrical<br>
signals to be conducted.<br>
The conductors achieved by the warp threads with electrically conductive means are thus<br>
brought out to the surface as desired only in defined regions for electrically connecting the<br>
corresponding electrical devices, for example, to which, for instance, by means of laser<br>
welding a cap or housing of an electrical device, for example of a microphone, can be<br>
applied. However, as already emphasized repeatedly, configuring the woven webbing in<br>
accordance with the invention achieves a uniform tensile strength of the warp threads over<br>
the width of the finished webbing. It is also to be noted that it is possible to apply a device to<br>
the surface of the webbing in accordance with the invention not just on one side but on both<br>
sides.<br>
The automotive seat belt in accordance with the invention with the electrically conductive<br>
warp threads included in the weave is suitable moreover with the application of the<br>
corresponding devices for monitoring medical data of a vehicle occupant such as, for<br>
example, pulse, blood pressure, temperature, etc. Apart from this, it is of advantage for<br>
out-of-position-technology since it permits sensing the current position or posture of a<br>
vehicle occupant as to physique, weight, etc and even in tailoring the development of an air<br>
bag in the vehicle interior to the current situation in case of a collision.<br>
Yet another possibility is an additional function with the webbing in accordance with the<br>
invention in namely checking its proper functioning so as to, for example, signal the need for<br>
replacement/renewal in due time due to wear and tear.<br><br>
