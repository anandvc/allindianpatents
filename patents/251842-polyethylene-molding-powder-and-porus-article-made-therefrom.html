				<td>POLYETHYLENE MOLDING POWDER AND<br>
POROUS ARTICLES MADE THEREFROM<br>
Priority Claim<br>
This application is based upon United States Provisional Application Serial<br>
No. 60/578,005 titled "Polyethylene Resin and Porous Articles Made Therefrom,"<br>
filed June 7, 2004, the priority of which is hereby claimed.<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The invention relates to the field of synthetic polymer materials for<br>
molding porous articles. In particular, the invention is directed to a new<br>
polyethylene molding resin which can be shped and sintered to form articles<br>
having high porosity.<br>
Background<br>
Ultra-high-molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE), standard high-<br>
density polyethylene (HDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) have all been<br>
used as polymeric materials for producing different types of molded porous<br>
articles. Such articles include filter funnels, immersion filters, filter crucibles,<br>
porous sheets, pen tips, marker nibs, aerators, diffusers and light weight molded<br><br>
parts. However, the polyethylene formulations used in these applications arc all<br>
associated with various disadvantages.<br>
LDPE and standard HDPE, which include polyethylene of molecular<br>
weight up to 250,000 g/mol, yield good part strength but their melt behavior<br>
results in a narrow processing window with respect to both time and temperature.<br>
As result, there is a strong tendency toward reduced porosity and an increased<br>
quality inconsistency in the molded product. Furthermore, with LDPE or standard<br>
HDPE as the molding powder, the non-uniformity of heating within molds having<br>
complex geometric conduits tends to result in non-uniformity in the porosity of the<br>
product part.<br><br>
In contrast to LDPE and standard HDPE, UHMW-PE formulations with an<br>
average molecular weight above 2,500,000 g/mol exhibit excellent processing<br>
forgiveness. Specifically, it is known in the art that UHMW-PE molding powders<br>
are characterized by a wide time and temperature processing window. However,<br>
these UHMW-PE formulations are known to result in rather weak molded<br>
products. Moreover, regional weak spots tend to be formed when UHMW-PE is<br>
used with molds having a complex geometric conduit. To maintain or improve the<br>
strength of porous articles made from UHMW-PE, US 4,925,880 to Stein discloses<br>
the addition of a polyethylene wax to the UHMW-PE particles. Stein teaches to<br>
add the wax in an amount between 5-60% to improve strength and porosity.<br>
However, the use of polyethylene wax in this manner restricts the time and<br>
temperature processing window and is thus associated with the same disadvantages<br>
as using LDPE and standard HDPE.<br>
High molecular weight polyethylenes are valued for properties such as<br>
chemical resistance, abrasion resistance, strength, water absorption, energy<br>
absorption, heat deflection, and sound-dampening capabilities. Processes for<br>
preparing high molecular weight polyethylenes are known in the art. United States<br>
Patent No. 4,962,167 to Shiraishi et at. discloses a process for making<br>
polyethylene powder by polymerizing ethylene using a solid catalyst component<br>
and an organometallic compound. According to the '167 patent the polyethylene<br>
powder is reported to have bulk densities from 0.30 g/cc to 0.34 g/cc with particle<br>
diameters ranging from 195 to 245 microns.<br>
Another process for making high molecular weight polyethylene is<br>
disclosed by United States Patent No. 4,972,035 to Suga et al., whereby<br>
polymerization is carried out in the presence of a Ziegler catalyst and the<br>
polyethylene is subjected to a high-speed shearing treatment. The morphologies of<br>
the particles in Suga et al. are stated to be substantially spherical, with elliptical or<br>
cocoon-like shapes.<br><br>
United States Patent No. 5,587,440 to Ehlers el al. discloses a method for<br>
making high molecular weight polyethylene powder with bulk densities ranging<br>
from 350 to 460 g/liter using Ziegler type catalysts.<br>
Methods for producing porous articles from high molecular weight<br>
polyethylene powders are likewise known. United States Patent No. 3,024,208, to<br>
Goethel et al. discloses a process for forming porous bodies by placing the<br>
polyethylene powder into containers and heating it under slight pressure. The<br>
porous articles produced by the process in Goethel et al. are reported to have<br>
densities ranging from 0.33 g/cc to 0.66 g/cc and porosities between 32 and 67 %.<br>
Still further processes for making polyethylene articles are noted below.<br>
PCT Application Publication No. WO 85/04365 discloses a sintering<br>
process whereby high molecular weight polyethylene powder is pre-compacted<br>
under pressure and heat to increase its bulk density. The compacted powders are<br>
reported to have bulk densities that are greater than 0.4 g/cc. The bulk density is<br>
increased by altering the particles' morphologies (removing the "fine structure")<br>
by passing the powder through a pellet or roll mill. The particle morphology of<br>
high molecular weight polyethylene can affect the compaction and sintering<br>
behavior of the powder. See, Sangeeta Hambir and J P Jog, Sintering of Ultra<br>
High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Bull. Mater. Sci., v. 23, No. 3 (June 2000).<br>
United States Patent No. 5,977,229 to Barth et al. and United States Patent<br>
No. 3,954,927, discloses porous articles, particularly filters, which are sintered<br>
from high molecular weight polyethylene.<br>
Copending U.S. patent application serial no. 10/640,830 discloses a process<br>
for forming a porous article using a molding powder comprising a polyethylene<br>
polymer having a molecular weight in the range of about 800,000 to about<br>
3,500,000 as determined by ASTM-D 4020, and a particle size distribution in the<br><br>
range of about 10 microns to about 1,000 microns. The particles are spherical in<br>
shape. Commercial examples of resins which can be successfully used in this<br>
process are GUR® 4012 and 4022, produced by Ticona LLC (Florence, KY).<br>
These materials have a powder bulk density in the range of 0.38 to 0.55 gm/cc.<br>
Although GUR® 4012 and 4022 can be shaped and sintered to yield articles having<br>
good porosity! there is still a need for improved polyethylene resins for preparation<br>
of articles having well-controlled porosity and good mechanical strength.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, a molding powder<br>
comprising polyethylene polymer particles is provided. The polyethylene polymer<br>
has a molecular weight within the range of about 600,000 g/mol to about<br>
2,7.00,000 g/mol as determined by ASTM 4020. The polyethylene polymer has an<br>
average particle size that is within the range of about 5 microns to about 1000<br>
microns, and the polyethylene has a powder bulk density in the range of about 0.10<br>
to about 0.30 g/cc.<br>
The polyethylene polymer typically has a molecular weight ranging from<br>
about 750000 g/mol to about 2,400,000 g/mol, and is preferably in between about<br>
800,000 and about 1,800,000 g/mol. A particularly preferred range is from about<br>
900,000 to about 1,500,000 g/mol. Generally, the polyethylene has a powder bulk<br>
density of from about 0.12 to 0.26 grams per cubic centimeter.<br>
The molding powders of the present invention have especially good<br>
strength characteristics. The powder exhibits a characteristic flexural strength<br>
(defined hereinafter) of at least about 0.7 MPa (megapascals). Preferably the<br>
inventive molding powder exhibits a characteristic flexural strength of at least<br>
about 0.9 MPa, or at least about 1.1 MPa.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention the molding powder<br>
comprises a polyethylene with a molecular weight of about 1,000,000 g/mol to<br><br>
about 2,600,000; a particle size of about 5 to about 800 microns; and a powder<br>
bulk density ranging from about 0.12 to 0.29 g/cc. Alternatively, the polymer may<br>
have a molecular weight that ranges from about 1,000,000 g/mol to about<br>
1,800,000 g/mol and have an average particle size that is between about 10 and<br>
200 microns.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for<br>
preparing a porous article from the inventive resin powder. The molding powder<br>
comprises polyethylene with a molecular weight between about 600,000 and<br>
2,700,000 g/mol; an average particle size ranging from about 5 to about 1000<br>
microns; and a powder bulk density between about 0.10 and 0.30 g/cc. The<br>
powder is formed into the desired shape and heated to a temperature of between<br>
140°C and 300°C for a sufficient time to permit the polymer to expand and soften.<br>
The powder is preferably heated to temperatures of between about 150°C to about<br>
280°C, and even more preferably to about 170 °C to about 260°C. The porous<br>
article is subsequently cooled.<br>
In still another yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided<br>
a porous article that is prepared from a polyethylene powder which has a<br>
molecular weight of between about 600,000 g/mol to about 2,700,000 g/mol; an<br>
average particle size in the range of about 5 microns to about 1,000 microns, and a<br>
powder bulk density in the range of about 0.1 to about 0.3 g/cc. Generally, the<br>
porous article has an average pore size of between about 5 µm and 100 µm and,<br>
even more typically, between about 50 µm and 80 µm. Also, the porous article<br>
usually has a porosity of between about 30 to 85 percent; preferably between about<br>
60 and 75 percent.<br>
Further features and advantages of the present invention will become<br>
apparent from the discussion that follows.<br><br>

Detailed Description<br>
The present invention is described in detail below with reference to the<br>
various examples and appended Figures. Modifications to particular examples<br>
within the spirit and scope of the present invention, set forth in the appended<br>
claims, will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, terms are to be construed in accordance with<br>
their ordinary meaning. Following are some exemplary definitions of terms used<br>
in this specification and the appended claims.<br>
The present invention provides a new and improved molding powder<br>
comprising polyethylene polymer particles. Specifically, the polyethylene<br>
polymer has a molecular weight within the range of about 600,000 g/mol to about<br>
2,700,000 g/mol. The particle size distribution of the polyethylene polymer<br>
particles is within the range of about 5 microns to about 1000 microns, and the<br>
polymer particles have a powder bulk density in the range of about 0.10 to about<br>
0.30 g/cc.<br><br>
In accordance with more particular embodiments of the invention, the<br>
molecular weight of the polyethylene polymer may fall within any of the following<br>
molecular weight ranges as determined by ASTM 4020: from about 750,000 g/mol<br>
■+.	<br>
to about 2,400,000 g/mol; and from about 800,000 g/mol to about 1,750,000<br>
g/mol. In further embodiments of the invention, the powder bulk density may be<br>
in the range of from about 0.12 to 0.26 g/cc or, preferably, from about 0.18 to<br>
about 0.26 g/cc.<br>
The production of high molecular weight polyethylene is typically<br>
achieved by the catalytic polymerization of ethylene monomer with a<br>
heterogeneous catalyst and Aluminium Alkyl as cocata|yst. The ethylene is<br>
usually polymerized in gaseous phase or slurry phase at relatively low<br>
temperatures and pressures. The polymerization reaction may be carried out at a<br>
temperature of between 50°C and 100°C and pressures in the range of 0,02 and<br>
2MPa.<br>
The molecular weight of the polyethylene can be adjusted by adding<br>
hydrogen. Altering the temperature or the Aluminium alkyl (type and<br>
concentration) may also be used to fine tune the molecular weight. Additionally,<br>
the reaction may occur in the presence of antistatic agents to avoid wall fouling<br>
and product contamination.<br>
Preferred catalysts include Ziegler-Natta type catalysts. Ziegler type<br>
catalysts are typically halides of transition metals from Groups IV-VIII react with<br>
alkyl derivatives of metals or hydrides from Groups I-III. Exemplary Ziegler<br>
catalysts include those based on the reaction products of aluminium and<br>
magnesium alkyls and titanium tetrahalides. Magnesium Chloride and porous fine<br>
grained materials, like silica, may also be used as support. Specifically the<br>
reaction product of Titaniumtetrachloride and Isoprenylaluminium is preferred.<br><br>
The solid catalyst component results as the reaction product of a diluted Ti<br>
(IV)-chloride and diluted Isoprenylaluminium. The mole ratio (Ti:Al) is between<br>
1:0.01 and 1:4 at a reaction temperature between -40°C and 100°C. The feed of<br>
titaniumtetrachloride is between 0.5 min and 60 min. An aliphatic solvent is used,<br>
which is purified through distillation and mole sieve treatment.<br>
Preferred reaction conditions are a temperature in the range of-20°C and<br>
50°C, most preferred is the range of 0°C and 30°C. The concentration of<br>
titaniumtetrachloride is in the range of 0.1 and 9.1 mole/1, preferred 0.2 and 5<br>
mole/1. The concentration of aluminiumalkyl is in the range 0.02 and 0.2 mol/l.<br>
The titanium component is added to the aluminium component. The dosing time is<br>
in the range of 0.1 min and 60 min, preferred l min to 30 min. The reaction<br>
mixture is cooled or heated to ambient temperature. The amount of Ti (III) is at<br>
least 95% after 10h. The isorenyl is supplied from Crompton; the<br>
titaniumtetrachloride from Akzo. The particle morphology is controlled through<br>
concentration of reactants, reaction temperature and agitation speed.<br>
The polymerization is carried out in suspension at low pressure and<br>
temperature in one or multiple steps, continuous or batch. The polymerization<br>
temperature is in the range of 30°C and 130°C, preferred is the range of 50°C and<br>
90°C. The ethylene partial pressure is in the range of less than 10 MPa, preferred is<br>
the range of 0.05 and 5MPa. Isoprenyl aluminium is used as cocatalyst. The ratio<br>
of Al:Ti is in the range of 1 and 30:1, more preferred is the range of 2:1 and 20:1.<br>
The solvent is an inert organic solvent as typically used for Ziegler type<br>
polymerizations. Examples are butane, pentane, hexane, cyclohexene, nonane,<br>
decane, higher homologous pure or as mixture of these. The polymer molecular<br>
mass is controlled through feeding hydrogen. The ratio ethylene partial pressure<br>
and hydrogen partial pressure is in the range of 5 to 100, preferred is the range of<br>
10 and 50. The polymer is isolated and dried in a fluidized bed drier under<br>
nitrogen. The solvent may be removed through steam distillation in case of using<br><br>
high boiling solvents. Salts of long chain fatty acids may be added as a stabilizer.<br>
Typical examples are calcium- magnesium or zink-Stearate.<br>
Optionally, other catalysts such as Phillips catalysts, metallocenes and post<br>
metallocenes may be employed, metallocene and postmetallocene catalysts are<br>
also well known. Generally a cocatalyst such as alumoxane is also employed.<br>
United States Patent Application No. 2002/0040113 to Fritzsche et al, the entirety<br>
of which is incorporated herein by reference, discusses several catalyst systems for<br>
producing ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. The selection of particularly<br>
active catalysts may enable the fluidized bet process to be made continuous.<br>
As stated, the powders of the present invention preferably have molecular<br>
weights between 600,000 g/ mol and 2,700,000 g/mol and a relatively low bulk<br>
density. The powders have a lower bulk density, in part, due to their unique<br>
porous particle morphology. The polyethylene particles of the present invention<br>
typically have a characteristic microglobular appearance. The particles have<br>
irregular geometries with uneven surface features. The particles also have porous<br>
surface features. The porous particle morphology of the polyethylene powder is a<br>
significant factor in contributing to the high porosity of the molded articles made<br>
according to the present invention. In contrast, many conventional high molecular<br>
weight polyethylenes have a relatively spherical particle morphology. Spherical<br>
particles typically have an elliptical shape with relatively smooth surface features.<br>
The morphology of the polymer develops as the particle grows. The break-<br>
up of the catalyst may determine the final particle morphology. The size of the<br>
catalyst particles may also determine the particle size of the polymer. The final<br>
polymer particle is typically 10-50 times as large as the original catalyst particle.<br>
Factors such as particle size, particle morphology, particle size distribution, and<br>
bulk density are significant properties of the powder because they affect the<br>
porosity characteristics of articles which are molded from the powder.<br><br>
United States Patent No. 5,300,470 to Cuffiani et al. discloses catalysts<br>
used in the production of high molecular weight polyethylene. Cuffiiani notes that<br>
the morphology of the polymer particle substantially replicates that of the catalyst<br>
particle, i.e., morphologic replica. And, the morphology of the catalyst can be<br>
controlled, for example, by precipitating the catalyst components from a liquid<br>
phase under particular conditions. (Cuffiani at col. 1, lines 45-60). EP 1124860 to<br>
Ehlers et al., noted above, discloses Ziegler type catalysts used in the production<br>
of high and ultra high molecular weight polyethylene. The solid catalyst<br>
component is the reaction product of titanium tetrachloride and an aluminium<br>
alkyl. The catalyst morphology is controlled through dosing rate, reaction<br>
temperature, concentration and the ratio of educts.<br>
Additional materials may be added to the molding powder, depending on<br>
the desired properties of the molded article. For example, it may be desirable to<br>
combine the polyethylene powder with activated carbon for filtering applications.<br>
The powder may also contain additives such as lubricants, dyes, pigments,<br>
antioxidants, fillers, processing aids, light stabilizers, neutralizers, antiblock, or the<br>
like. Preferably, the molding powder consists essentially of polyethylene polymer,<br>
such that additional materials do not alter the basic and novel characteristics of the<br>
powder, i.e., processing flexibility and being suitable for forming articles with<br>
superior porosity and mechanical strength.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, a process for forming<br>
a porous article is provided. The process involves molding a shape from a<br>
molding powder comprising polyethylene polymer particles. The polyethylene<br>
polymer typically has a single modal molecular weight distribution. Here again,<br>
the molecular weight of the polyethylene polymer is within the range of about<br>
600,000 g/mol to about 2,700,000 g/mol as determined by ASTM. The particle<br>
size distribution of the particles of the polyethylene polymer is within the range of<br>
about 5 microns to about 1000 microns. The polymer particles have a powder bulk<br>
density in the range of about 0.10 to about 0.30 g/cc. Advantageously, the process<br><br>
provides a desirable processing window for producing articles with excellent<br>
porosity and strength.<br>
Molded articles may be formed in accordance with the invention by a free<br>
sintering process which involves introducing the molding powder comprising the<br>
polyethylene polymer particles into either a partially or totally confined space, e.g.,<br>
a mold, and subjecting the molding powder to heat sufficient to cause the<br>
polyethylene particles to soften, expand and contact one another. Suitable<br>
processes include compression molding and casting. The mold can be made of<br>
steel, aluminum or other metals.<br>
Sintering processes are well-known in the art. The mold is heated to the<br>
sintering temperature, which will vary depending upon individual circumstances.<br>
In one embodiment, this temperature is in the range of about 100°C and 300°C.<br>
The sintering temperature may also be within the following ranges: 140°C to<br>
300°C and 140°C to 240°C. The mold is typically heated in a convection oven,<br>
hydraulic press or infrared heaters. The heating time will vary and depend upon<br>
the mass of the mold and the geometry of the molded article. Typical heating time<br>
will lie within the range of about 5 to about 300 minutes. In more particular<br>
embodiments, the heating time may be in the range of about 25 minutes to about<br>
100 minutes. The mold may also be vibrated to ensure uniform distribution of the<br>
powder. As noted in Goethel el al., higher temperatures generally produce molded<br>
articles that have higher densities and are harder. Also, the strength of the desired<br>
article correlates with the length of heating time. The optimum temperatures and<br>
heating times depend on the molecular weight of the polymer.<br>
A molding pressure may be applied, if desired. In cases requiring porosity<br>
adjustment, a proportional low pressure can be applied to the powder. Subjecting<br>
the particles to pressure causes them to rearrange and deform at contact points<br>
until the material is compressed. The molding powders of the present invention,<br>
however, are preferably not compacted either before or during the sintering<br><br>
process. Generally, a powder that is compacted will yield articles with lower<br>
porosities.<br>
During sintering, the surface of individual polymer particles fuse at their<br>
contact points forming a porous structure. The polymer particles coalesce together<br>
at the contact points due to the diffusion of polymer chains across the interface of<br>
the particles. The interface eventually disappears and mechanical strength at the<br>
interface develops. Subsequently, the mold is cooled and the porous article<br>
removed. The cooling step may be accomplished by conventional means, for<br>
example it may be performed by blowing air past the article or the mold, or<br>
contacting the mold with a cold fluid. Upon cooling, the polyethylene typically<br>
undergoes a reduction in bulk volume. This is commonly referred to as<br>
"shrinkage." A high degree of shrinkage is generally not desirable as it can cause<br>
shape distortion in the final product.<br>
Advantageously, parts made in accordance with the process of the<br>
invention and with the polyethylene powder of the described molecular weight<br>
range have an improved strength and porosity relative to other HMW-PE and<br>
UHMW-PE grades. The polyethylene molding powder of the invention provides<br>
excellent processing flexibility and low pressure drop, high porosity through much<br>
lower porosity reduction than standard HDPE and LDPE. The articles obtained in<br>
accordance with the claimed invention have exceptionally high porosity, excellent<br>
porosity uniformity, and good strength for porous and porous filtration<br>
applications. Other applications include sound-dampening, absorbent wicking,<br>
fluidizing sheets or membranes, analytical equipment, venting and aeration. The<br>
molding powder of the present invention is particularly suitable for forming<br>
sintered air and liquid filters.<br>
A porous element for a fluid filter made in accordance with the present<br>
invention can be seen in Figures 1-3. Figure 1 illustrates a filter element 10 as<br>
seen in the viewing direction of a first porous side wall 12. Narrower, second<br><br>
porous side walls 14 laterally join the first side walls 12 to each other so as to form<br>
a box like structure. The porous side walls of filter element 10 are sintered from<br>
the molding powder of the present invention. A partition 16 separates an<br>
unfiltered gas side 18 from a filtered gas side 20. When the filter is operating, the<br>
medium to be filtered is sucked through an opening, not shown, and flows from the<br>
unfiltered gas side 18 through the porous side walls 12,14 into the hollow interior<br>
of filter element 10. The solid particles to be separated from the medium are<br>
retained on the surface of filter element 10 and may be cleaned off periodically.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, the medium is further sucked through a flow passage 22 in<br>
head 24 to the clean gas side 20. From there it is discharged through an opening,<br>
not shown, to the outside of the apparatus. The space 26 between sidewalls 12,<br>
continues in flow passage 22 and extends through head 24 to clean gas side 20.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates two first sidewalls 12 and a narrow, second side wall 14. It<br>
can be seen that filter element 10 comprises two halves 28 and 30 coupled along<br>
their longitudinal axis 32. The halves are also connected along wall portions 34<br>
and 36, thereby creating individual cells and increasing the strength of the entire<br>
filter element 10. Further discussion of sintered filter elements appears in United<br>
States Patent No. 6,331,197 to Herding et al., the entirety of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
Additional sintered fillers can be seen in United States Patent No.<br>
6,770,736 and copending United States Patent Application Serial no. 10/855,749,<br>
which disclose activated carbon filters using high molecular weight polyethylene<br>
as a binder. The filter unit is produced by mixing finely divided activated carbon<br>
with the polyethylene and molding the powder by thermoplastic sintering.<br>
Procedures<br>
In the following examples, polyethylene molding powder was prepared<br>
using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst.<br><br>
Catalyst Preparation<br>
The catalyst is prepared in a 600 1 reactor using 13mol isoprenylaluminium<br>
in 2521 Exxsol D30 (Exxon solvent grade). Titaniumtetrachloride (3000 mol/I)<br>
was fed within 180 sec at a starting temperature of 10 - 15°C. The final Ti:Al ratio<br>
was 0.78. The agitation was stopped after 2h post reaction at 25°C. The upper<br>
solvent layer was removed after 15h. The catalyst solid component was used for<br>
polymerization after diluting with 200 1 Exxsol D30.<br>
Polymerization<br>
The polymerization was performed in a single step continuous process.<br>
Exxsol D30 was used as solvent. The reactor volume was 401, the reaction<br>
temperature 85°C at ethylene partial pressure in the range of 0.11 MPa and 0.2<br>
MPa.<br>
Polymer Powder Preparation<br>
The polymer powder was separated from the solvent which was eliminated<br>
through a steam distillation. The resulting powder was dried in a fluidized bed<br>
under nitrogen. 500ppm Ca-Stearate was added as an acid scavenger and blended<br>
in a Hentschel mixer in order to destroy agglomerates.<br>
Sintered samples were made according to the following procedure:<br>
The porous test samples were prepared by forming porous plaques with a<br>
diameter of 140mm and a thickness of 6.0 - 6.5 mm in a suitable mold. The mold<br>
is filled with the polymer powder and the sides are tapped to settle the powder for<br>
uniformity and to improve packing. The top of the mold is leveled, the mold is<br>
covered and placed into the convection oven. The sintering temperature and time<br>
are reported in the tables for each example and specimen. The mold was then<br>
removed from the press and cooled quickly. The sample was removed from the<br>
mold and allowed to air cool for 40 minutes.<br><br>
The characteristic flexural strength of a powder is determined by preparing<br>
a 140 mm diameter disk having a thickness of about 6.25 mm by way of the above<br>
procedure, sintering the part for about 25 minutes at 220°C, and measuring the<br>
flexural strength of the disk in accordance with DIN TSO 178.<br>
The shrinkage (in %) is defined as the diameter of the porous plaque in<br>
reference with the diameter of the mold.<br>
The polymer powder and the porous plaques were analyzed for various<br>
properties according to the following procedures:<br>
Property	Method<br>
Molecular weight	ASTM D-4020<br>
Average Particle size	Laser Scattering <br>
Bulk density	DIN 53 466<br>
Average pore size	DIN ISO 4003<br>
Porosity	DIN 661332<br>
Flexural strength	DIN ISO 1783<br>
Pressure Drop	Internal4<br>
Properties of the tested powders are summarized in Table 1. Sinter<br>
conditions and properties of porous parts are summarized in Tables 2 -5.<br>
1	Helos, Sympatec with Rodos SR<br>
2	Hg-Porosimeter, AutoPore IV Series 9500, Micromeretics<br>
3	UTS Type 10T Universal Testing Machine (UTS Testsysteme GmbH)<br>
4	Porous plaque with diameter: 140 mm, thickness: 6,2-6,5 mm ; airflow: 7,5 m3 / h<br><br><br>
Examples 1-5<br>
Porous plaques were produced by the free sintering process discussed<br>
above from the polyethylene powders of Polymer ]. The polyethylene powder<br>
was introduced into a mold, and the mold was heated according to the temperature<br>
listed in Table 2, below. The mold was held at the temperature for the time<br>
indicated. The shrinkage of the powder is indicated in the table below, as well as<br>
results for the porosity of the filter, the strength of the filter, and the pressure drop.<br><br><br><br>
Comparative Examples<br>
Sintered parts were also made from polyethylene powders A, B, and C.<br>
These samples represent different powder morphology and molecular weight.<br>
These articles were prepared and tested according to the same procedures as in<br>
Examples 1-5.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
As can be seen from comparing Tables 2-5, the polyethylene molding<br>
powder of the present invention exhibits excellent porosity characteristics while<br>
still maintaining good mechanical strength. Porous articles made from the<br>
comparative polymers exhibited lower flexural strength, higher pressure drops and<br>
so forth as is appreciated from the data.<br>
