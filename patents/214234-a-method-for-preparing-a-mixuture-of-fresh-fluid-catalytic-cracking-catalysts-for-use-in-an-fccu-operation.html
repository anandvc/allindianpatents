A METHOD FOR PREPARING A SUBSTITUTE FOR FRESH FLUID<br>
CATALYTIC CRACKING CATALYST<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
	[001]	This invention relates to a method for improved fluid catalytic<br>
cracking (FCC) catalyst management by preparing a mixture of two or more of<br>
fresh, treated FCC equilibrium catalyst, untreated FCC equilibrium catalyst,<br>
and one or more FCC additives for use as a substitute for fresh catalyst<br>
addition to an FCC unit (FCCU) or for use as supplemental catalyst addition<br>
along with a reduced amount of fresh catalyst addition to the FCCU.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
	[002]	The fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process has been in<br>
operation for over 50 years and has gone through many changes. These<br>
changes have been in the well-known catalyst and additives employed in the<br>
process, as well as mechanical and process changes. In the last decade<br>
there has been a slow but constant pressure and realization that proper FCC<br>
catalyst management can result in a significant reduction in the FCC<br>
operating costs and improved FCC operating stability.<br>
	[003]	A first significant disclosure for improved FCC catalyst<br>
management was disclosed in my European Patent Application No. 0 408 606<br>
B1 "Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) Catalyst and Additive Loading Control<br>
System" and in the Bartholic, Lippert U.S. Patent No. 5.389,236 "Method and<br>
Apparatus for Controlling Introduction of Catalysts into FCC Units", which are<br>
incorporated by reference in their entirety in this application. These two<br>
publications disclose an improved method for adding fresh FCC catalyst and<br>
FCC additives to an FCCU, Refiners who have employed these systems<br>
have noted improvements in the operating stability of their FCC unit (FCCU)<br>
and reduced catalyst/additive usage, which translates into reduced unit<br>
operating costs, and more on-specification products. The use of these<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2O04/O33589	PCT/US2003/02856I<br>
systems for FCC additive addition has been widely employed. However, the<br>
use of these systems for fresh catalyst addition has not been widely accepted,<br>
because it requires a fairly large capital expenditure and replacement of the<br>
existing fresh catalyst storage hopper of the FCCU.<br>
	[004]	In my U.S. Patent No. 5,888,919 "Process for Zeolitic Catalyst<br>
Reactivation" and the Bartholic, Davis U.S. Patent No. 5,900,383 "Process for<br>
Increasing the Activity of Zeolite Containing Particulate Solids", which are<br>
incorporated by reference in their entirety in this application, there are<br>
disclosed processes which enable for the reuse of FCC equilibrium catalyst by<br>
Increasing the equilibrium catalyst activity through forming what is referred to<br>
herein as "reactivated FCC equilibrium catalyst".<br>
	[005]	There are also well-known processes for removing deposited<br>
metals, primarily Ni and V, from equilibrium catalyst to form what is referred to<br>
herein as "demetalized equilibrium FCC catalyst". One such process, known<br>
as DEMET, was originally developed by ARCO in the 1950's and 1960's to<br>
remove metals from high aluminia FCC equilibrium catalyst. This process<br>
was further developed to remove metals from zeolitic FCC equilibrium<br>
catalyst. An improved DEMET process is described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,686,197, which is incorporated herein by reference. More recently, Coastal<br>
Corporation, has further refined this process to remove metals<br>
(demetalization) and increase the activity (reactivation) of zeolitic catalyst.<br>
This latter process is referred to as the ACT Process and is described in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6.046,125, which is incorporated herein by reference. It should be<br>
noted that demetalization refers to the removal of one or more metal elements<br>
that are deposited on the catalyst from the feed and are considered to be<br>
detrimental to the FCC catalyst activity or yield structure of the product of the<br>
process. Among these metals are Ni, which increases hydrogen production,<br>
and Na and V, which are also detrimental to catalyst activity.<br>
	[006]	Up until now, the typical refiner has added fresh catalyst and<br>
additives to maintain the desired catalyst activity in the FCCU and has<br>
withdrawn excess equilibrium catalyst to maintain the desired unit inventory.<br>
In an FCCU, I estimate that only about 30%, more or less, of the circulating<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2004/033589	PCT/US2OO3/O28561<br>
catalyst inventory has a substantial catalytic activity. The other 70 wt%, more<br>
or less, is relatively catalytically inert. Of the 30% active material, the activity<br>
of the circulating catalyst particles ranges from a high of fresh catalyst activity<br>
to very low activity. If one uses an activity test unit to quantify the activity<br>
(defined as conversion to lower molecular weight hydrocarbons of a standard<br>
gas oil feed in the activity test unit divided by the quantity {100-	[conversion in<br>
the activity test unit]	}), the circulating catalyst inventory in a typical FCCU<br>
might have an activity of 2.33 (for 70% conversion in activity test unit; i.e.,<br>
70/100-70=2.33). The fresh catalyst activity might be 13.28 (for 93%<br>
conversion) or 5.7 times as active as the circulating catalyst inventory, which<br>
is sometimes referred to equilibrium catalyst or ECAT. The inert catalyst<br>
particles in the circulating catalyst inventory might have an activity of 0.33 (for<br>
25% conversion). More importantly, if one compares the coke yield on the<br>
activity test for these activity ranges, one might find the coke yield for the<br>
fresh catalyst to be 3 to 5 times higher than the coke yield on the ECAT. This<br>
is important since it limits the zeolite content of fresh FCC catalyst to about<br>
15-30% in the typical FCCU.<br>
	[007]	Because of environmental concerns and disposal costs, most<br>
refiners withdraw a minimum of equilibrium catalyst from their units. In this<br>
case, the fresh catalyst added to the FCCU is typically selected and added to<br>
maintain a desired yield structure and unit activity and to make up for unit<br>
catalyst losses through the cyclones of the FCCU.<br>
	[008]	Equilibrium catalyst or ECAT is defined as the catalyst that is<br>
circulating in the FCCU and consists of the fresh FCC catalyst and FCC<br>
additives which were just added to the unit plus the FCC catalyst and FCC<br>
additives which have made more than one cycle between the reactor and the<br>
regenerator of the FCCU and are less active than the fresh catalyst and<br>
additives. In those units that process feedstocks which contain metals and<br>
other catalyst poisons the equilibrium catalyst also has thereon metals and<br>
poisons deposited from the feedstock.<br>
	[009]	Some refiners processing high quality feeds (containing low<br>
metals and catalyst poisons) may elect to add more fresh catalyst than the<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2OO4/033589	PCT/US2003/028561<br>
amount lost from the unit. Therefore, they will withdraw ECAT that is usually<br>
of high quality (low metals, higher than normal activity) that they will then sell<br>
to operators of units which process residual oil or might be experiencing a<br>
high catalyst loss problem. This high quality ECAT is typically sold at less<br>
than 50% of the fresh catalyst selling price.<br>
	[010]	Units processing residual oil that contains metals, such as Ni,<br>
V, and Na, and other catalyst poisons in excessive amounts will require that<br>
the refiner add fresh catalyst or high quality ECAT to maintain the unit ECAT<br>
activity and metals level at some predetermined value that will give the<br>
desired unit yield structure and profitability. In this case, usually the amount<br>
of catalyst addition is more than the catalyst losses from the unit, so the<br>
refiner must remove ECAT from the unit for disposal. Since this ECAT is of<br>
poor quality, the refiner must pay for its disposal.<br>
	[011]	In a typical FCCU adding fresh catalyst, a large percentage<br>
(30-70%) of the fresh catalyst is lost through the cyclone system of the unit.<br>
The majority of the initial loss is the catalyst fines and moisture contained in<br>
the fresh catalyst, plus some loss by attrition. The rest of the loss of catalyst<br>
from the unit is mainly equilibrium catalyst and the amount varies with the<br>
cyclone efficiency, because the cyclones are less than 100% efficient in<br>
separating the catalyst from the vapors. In FCC units that have metals in the<br>
feed, the type and quantity of catalyst addition will be determined to control<br>
both the equilibrium catalyst activity/selectivity and level of metals deposited<br>
on the catalyst. Some refiners have added purchased equilibrium catalyst to<br>
their unit to control the unit inventory, selectivity, metals level and/or activity of<br>
the circulating catalyst inventory (note: ECAT losses are considerably less<br>
than that of fresh catalyst, since the ECAT has very low fines and moisture<br>
content and low attrition). Typically, these refiners will purchase low metals<br>
equilibrium catalyst with an activity equal to or greater than the catalyst<br>
activity in their units and add this purchased ECAT in place of fresh catalyst<br>
addition.<br>
	[012]	Up until now, because of limitations in FCCU catalyst<br>
hopper/storage capacity to segregate catalyst types, the typical refiner has<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2004/033589	PCT/US2003/028561<br>
amount lost from the unit. Therefore, they will withdraw ECAT that is usually<br>
of high quality (low metals, higher than normal activity) that they will then sell<br>
to operators of units which process residual oil or might be experiencing a<br>
high catalyst loss problem. This high quality ECAT is typically sold at less<br>
than 50% of the fresh catalyst selling price.<br>
	[010]	Units processing residual oil that contains metals, such as Ni,<br>
V, and Na, and other catalyst poisons in excessive amounts will require that<br>
the refiner add fresh catalyst or high quality ECAT to maintain the unit ECAT<br>
activity and metals level at some predetermined value that will give the<br>
desired unit yield structure and profitability. In this case, usually the amount<br>
of catalyst addition is more than the catalyst losses from the unit, so the<br>
refiner must remove ECAT from the unit for disposal. Since this ECAT is of<br>
poor quality, the refiner must pay for its disposal.<br>
	[011]	In a typical FCCU adding fresh catalyst, a large percentage<br>
(30-70%) of the fresh catalyst is lost through the cyclone system of the unit.<br>
The majority of the initial loss is the catalyst fines and moisture contained in<br>
the fresh catalyst, plus some loss by attrition. The rest of the loss of catalyst<br>
from the unit is mainly equilibrium catalyst and the amount varies with the<br>
cyclone efficiency, because the cyclones are less than 100% efficient in<br>

equilibrium catalyst with an activity equal to or greater than the catalyst<br>
activity in their units and add this purchased ECAT in place of fresh catalyst<br>
addition.<br>
	[012]	Up until now, because of limitations in FCCU catalyst<br>
hopper/storage capacity to segregate catalyst types, the typical refiner has<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2004/0033589	PCT/US2003/028561<br>
usually been restrained to the use of one fresh FCC catalyst or one outside<br>
supply of FCC ECAT that is added from the fresh catalyst storage hopper of<br>
the FCCU. That is, the typical FCCU has one fresh storage hopper and one<br>
equilibrium storage hopper. Therefore, if the refiner purchases FCC ECAT<br>
from an outside source, he must use the fresh catalyst storage hopper to add<br>
this material. If he adds this outside-purchased material to the ECAT storage<br>
hopper, there will be cross contamination with the unit's ECAT when unit<br>
ECAT is withdrawn to maintain unit inventory or during a shutdown, when the<br>
unit inventory is removed from the unit to the ECAT storage hopper. If the<br>
refiner wants to add both fresh and outside ECAT to his unit, then he must<br>
install another addition hopper for this outside ECAT.<br>
	[013]	As the number of catalyst additives, fresh catalyst, and<br>
equilibrium catalyst employed in the FCCU increases, the number of hoppers<br>
for catalyst addition and catalyst storage increases, and the catalyst<br>
management associated with this part of the FCCU operation takes up more<br>
and more time and resources. Every time a new catalyst, fresh or equilibrium,<br>
or catalyst additive, arrives at the refinery, it must be weighed on the refinery<br>
scale, the hopper must be inventoried by transferring from the truck, rail car,<br>
or container. This transfer requires depressuring the existing hopper, pulling<br>
a vacuum on the hopper, connecting the truck, rail car, or container to the<br>
hopper, connecting up pressuring air and conveying air, and manually<br>
regulating the transfer of the material into the hopper. After the transfer is<br>
complete, the hopper must be pressured and placed back in service, and the<br>
above procedure reversed so that the truck, rail car, or container can be<br>
weighed to determine the amount of catalyst delivered. Given the size of the<br>
equipment involved, this procedure may take eight hours or more, and ties up<br>
personnel that have other duties.<br>
	[014]	The present invention concerns a method which improves<br>
catalyst management so as to reduce the associated time required by the<br>
refinery personnel. The present invention also reduces the overall catalyst<br>
costs. A further objective of the present invention is to reduce catalyst<br>
transportation costs. Also, the present invention enables the refiner to form<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2OO4/O33589	PCT/US2OO3/O2856I<br>
an alliance with a single catalyst supplier, who would supply all the refiner's<br>
requirements for fresh, equilibrium, demetalized, and reactivated FCC catalyst<br>
and FCC additives. This is especially useful as more and more consolidation<br>
in the refining industry occurs. Another object of this invention is to utilize the<br>
weigh scale function as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,389,236 to supply<br>
signals to an offsite location that can monitor the FCC unit inventory of fresh<br>
catalyst and additives. In this way, the refiner can maintain minimum FCC<br>
catalyst inventory (lower cost) and the supplier can deliver product only when<br>
required. Another object of the present invention is to provide the refiner with<br>
the ability to select from a multiple of sources (fresh, reactivated ECAT,<br>
demetalized ECAT, additives) for the FCCU "fresh catalyst" (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "intermediate fresh catalyst" or, IFC) that will result in the<br>
desired unit yield structure and activity at the lowest possible price. Still<br>
another object of the present invention is to reduce the refiner's capital<br>
requirements, in that he will not be required to add more hoppers or build<br>
on-site demetalization or reactivation systems. In addition, this invention<br>
enables reuse of ECAT, which will result in the use of less raw materials and<br>
energy, reduce unit catalyst losses, result in a higher unit activity than an<br>
equivalent fresh catalyst, since more of the ECAT will remain in the unit<br>
compared to fresh catalyst, and result in less disposal to landfill.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
	[015]	What I have discovered is that, by utilizing sources of ECAT,<br>
catalyst demetalization facilities, catalyst reactivation facilities, and/or the<br>
ability to manufacture fresh catalyst with zeolite contents of greater than 20%,<br>
and by blending the resulting materials, with or without FCC additives, an IFC<br>
can be produced that will satisfy the refiner's FCC catalyst requirements at a<br>
lower cost, e.g., 50% to 80% of the refiner's present fresh FCC catalyst cost.<br>
This will also decrease the refiners catalyst management time, capital<br>
requirements, number of additive hoppers at the FCCU, and the number of<br>
catalyst shipments that need to be received by the refiner. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of this invention, a signal from an FCCU's additive hopper(s) to a<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2004/033589	PCT/US2OO3/O2856I<br>
remote location can be used to facilitate catalyst inventory control and reduce<br>
operating costs.<br>
	[016]	To achieve the objects of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a method for preparing a mixture of FCC catalyst components for<br>
use in an FCCU, which comprises: performing an analysis of an FCCU<br>
operation; determining the catalyst requirements for the FCCU based on said<br>
analysis; determining the catalytic properties of at least two FCC catalyst<br>
components selected from the group consisting of untreated equilibrium FCC<br>
catalyst, reactivated equilibrium FCC catalyst, demetallized equilibrium FCC<br>
catalyst, reactivated and demetallized equilibrium FCC catalyst and fresh high<br>
activity FCC catalyst containing a zeolite component; and blending said at<br>
least two components in proportions, based on the determined properties of<br>
said at least two components and the determined catalyst requirements, to<br>
form a mixture of the components suitable for addition to the FCCU.<br>
	[017]	Preferably, the mixture is added to the FCC unit through a<br>
weighed catalyst addition system, and a signal from a weighing device is used<br>
to control the inventory of the catalyst addition system. If the equilibrium<br>
hopper is also equipped with weigh cells, the unit catalyst withdrawals can be<br>
automated and the equilibrium catalyst hopper inventory continually<br>
monitored, which will improve ECAT management. If the equilibrium hopper<br>
is also equipped with weight cells, the unit catalyst withdrawals can be<br>
automated and the continually equilibrium catalyst hopper inventory<br>
monitored, which will improve ECAT management.<br>
	[018]	The objectives of this invention can be realized by analyzing<br>
the operation of an FCCU and determining the catalyst and additive<br>
requirements for the operation, and then premixing all or part of the required<br>
FCC catalyst and catalyst additive in an off-site facility, or the individual<br>
components of the mixture can be mixed on-site in the addition hopper<br>
located in the unit. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the catalyst<br>
addition hopper and ECAT hopper have weight cells or a weighing device that<br>
gives a continuous readout of the weight of the catalyst in the hopper. This<br>
device can generate a signal which can, if desired, also be supplied to an<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2004/O33589	PCT/US2OO3/O28561<br>
offsite location, such as the catalyst supplier's offices, so that the supplier can<br>
monitor the unit inventory of fresh catalyst, ECAT, and additives. In this way,<br>
the refiner can maintain minimum catalyst inventory (lower cost) and the<br>
supplier can deliver the necessary catalyst and additives and remove ECAT<br>
only when required.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
	[019]	The invention will be more fully understood from the-following<br>
description thereof read with reference to the accompanying drawing,<br>
wherein:<br>
	[020]	Fig. 1 illustrates a preferred apparatus and flow diagram useful<br>
in the practice of the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
	[021]	In the practice of this invention, in order to determine what<br>
properties must be associated with the IFC catalyst, the supplier and refiner<br>
need to analyze the FCC operations. This would normally entail evaluating<br>
the currently-used catalyst and additives being added to the unit and ECAT<br>
properties (chemical and physical), such as, activity, zeolite content, pore<br>
volume, surface area, particle size distribution, additive concentrations,<br>
hydrogen production, carbon on catalyst, and the contents of rare earth,<br>
sodium, iron, nickel, vanadium, and copper plus any other catalyst properties<br>
that might be effecting the operation. One would also evaluate the unit yields<br>
and product properties, the unit limitations, the unit's catalyst and additive<br>
addition rates and withdrawals, and the refiner's objectives. In addition, the<br>
feedstock source and properties, such as, gravity, sulfur, ramsbottom carbon,<br>
nitrogen (basic and total), distillation, aniline point, PONA, and the amount of<br>
nickel, vanadium, sodium, iron and copper plus any other feedstock related ,<br>
details that might effect the operation should be known.<br>
	[022]	From the above information, one can then make an IFC<br>
catalyst that has properties between the catalyst added to the unit and the<br>
ECAT in the unit that will result in an IFC catalyst that will produce the desired<br>
unit yields and product properties at a cheaper cost and a significant reduction<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2004/033589	PCT/US2003/028561<br>
in unit catalyst losses. Most likely the IFC catalyst requirements that will be<br>
the most important will be activity, rare earth content, surface area, hydrogen<br>
production, and nickel, vanadium, and sodium content.<br>
	[023]	The ultimate supplier of the refinery FCC catalyst and catalyst<br>
additives preferably has access to facilities needed to blend the components<br>
needed to produce the desired IFC. The supplier preferably has access to<br>
catalyst testing facilities and be able to produce or acquire high zeolitic<br>
content FCC catalyst (which contains &gt;20% 
demetalized ECAT, reactivated ECAT, demetalized-reactivated ECAT, ECAT<br>
of various types, and FCC additives as blending components. These<br>
components are then tested to determine properties such as for activity,<br>
metals, surface area, pore volume, stability, yields, physical and chemical<br>
properties, and blended to obtain the desired IFC. As an example, assume<br>
that, based on the analysis of the FCCU operation, it is determined that the<br>
refiner needs an IFC having an activity of 5.9, minimum nickel activity to<br>
produce hydrogen, low vanadium levels, and an acceptable yield structure.<br>
The supplier would then take the components' properties and blend the<br>
components according to the following formula:<br>
IFC Activity = sum of (Wt% of each component in blend) (Activity of<br>
that component)<br>
Where: Activity = (conversion in lab test unit)/	[100-(conversion in lab<br>
test unit)]<br>
IFC, wt ppm of vanadium = sum of (wt% of each component in<br>
blend)(wt ppm vanadium of that component)<br>
The components for the IFC blend may be selected from two or more<br>
of the following:<br>
a.	Fresh catalyst - catalytic active material that is added to<br>
	the unit to affect the ECAT activity and unit yields and<br>
	product properties<br>
b.	Demetalized catalyst - ECAT that has been treated to<br>
	remove some portion of metals or catalyst poisons that<br>
	have been deposited on the ECAT from the feed<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2004/033589 PCT/US2OO3/O28561<br>
c.	Reactivated catalyst - Fresh or ECAT that has been<br>
treated to increase its activity.<br>
d.	Demetalized-Reactivated Catalyst - ECAT that has been<br>
treated to both increase its activity and remove some<br>
portion of metals or catalyst poisons that have been<br>
deposited on the ECAT from the feed.<br>
e.	Additives - any material, liquid or solid, that is added to<br>
the FCC unit as a minor component of the circulating<br>
ECAT to affect a specific operating characteristic of the<br>
FCC operation (such as aid the burning of CO to CO2 in<br>
the regenerator, reduce SOX emissions, increase gasoline<br>
octane, etc.)<br>
	[024]	It should be noted that, for example, a fresh catalyst with 40%<br>
zeolite might have a fresh activity of 19; a reactivated ECAT, an activity of 3.0;<br>
and a demetalized ECAT, an activity of 2.3. Therefore a blend of these three<br>
materials to obtain a 5.9 IFC activity would contain 20% high activity fresh<br>
catalyst, 40% of reactivated ECAT, and 40% of demetalized ECAT. This IFC<br>
might cost 60% of the equivalent fresh catalyst.<br>
	[025]	The supplier would then make a laboratory IFC blend of the<br>
components and test the IFC blend for the refiner's criteria. Any reactivated<br>
ECAT, even that from the refiner's unit would be higher activity than the<br>
starting ECAT as shown in the above-mentioned referenced catalyst<br>
reactivation patents, so the percentage of high activity fresh catalyst required<br>
should be a small percentage of the total blend. Since the manufacturing cost<br>
of high zeolite content fresh catalyst is almost identical to lower zeolite content<br>
catalyst and the other component costs are a percentage of fresh catalyst, the<br>
cost of producing these IFC mixtures with these less expensive components<br>
will always be less than the fresh catalyst it is replacing.<br>
	[026]	If the nickel activity of the blend is too high (i.e. demetalized<br>
ECAT is not available or because it is more costly and complicated to remove<br>
nickel than V, the ECAT was only treated to remove V) antimony, bismuth or<br>
another nickel treatment could be applied to the blend to reduce the nickel<br>
activity. Another advantage of this invention is that the blend can be treated<br>
or adjusted as required before it is shipped.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
	[027]	Fig. 1 depicts a preferred catalyst addition apparatus 10. A<br>
suitably sized and shaped weigh hopper 12 contains an inventory of IFC<br>
material 14. A support system 16 for the weigh hopper 12 is provided with a<br>
weighing device 18 such as load cells or scales. The weighing device 18 is<br>
preferably connected to a weigh indicator 20 such as a digital display 22. In<br>
effect, the weighing device 18 weighs both the weigh hopper 12 and the<br>
catalyst inventory 14 contained in said hopper. The weigh indicator 20 can be<br>
adapted to display the combined weight of the weigh hopper 12 and catalyst<br>
inventory 14. In the alternative, the empty weight of the weigh hopper 12 can<br>
be automatically subtracted from the combined weight of the weigh hopper 12<br>
and catalyst inventory 14 so that a read-out display 22 of the weigh indicator<br>
20 shows only the weight of the catalyst inventory 14. In either case, the<br>
weighing device 18 will detect changes in the weight of the catalyst inventory<br>
14 over time as catalyst is taken from the weigh hopper 12 and added to a<br>
FCC unit not shown in Fig. 1.<br>
	[028]	The signal to weigh indicator 20 can be routed both locally and<br>
to a remote location, such as, off-site at the IFC's supplier's facility or where<br>
the catalyst management personnel are located. By monitoring this signal,<br>
one can tell such things as the addition rate per day. the present inventory,<br>
and predict when a new shipment of IFC should arrive at the unit and<br>
schedule accordingly. For management of withdrawn ECAT inventory, the<br>
catalyst management personnel would determine when the ECAT inventory<br>
was at its limit and schedule to have this ECAT removed from the hopper and<br>
sold or disposed of according to the present guidelines.<br>
	[029]	In one preferred embodiment of this invention, IFC from a<br>
source not shown in Fig. 1 is added to the catalyst inventory 14 via a hopper<br>
loading valve 26 and catalyst injection pipe 28. The catalyst injection pipe 28<br>
might also serve as a hopper venting system through the use of an<br>
appropriate hopper vent valve 30 (which is preferably equipped with a silencer<br>
device 32).<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2OO4/O33589	PCT/US2003/028561<br>
	[030]	Plant air 34 is delivered to the catalyst addition apparatus 10<br>
via an air conduit system 36 such as the flexible hose and pipe system<br>
depicted in Fig. 1. The air conduit system 36 also is more preferably provided<br>
with various valves, e.g., valves 38,40,42,44, and 46 in order to provide a<br>
means for distributing the plant air 34 to various parts of the catalyst addition<br>
apparatus 10. The air conduit system 36 is preferably provided with a<br>
pressure gauge 48 and pressure gauge 50 for respectively measuring the air<br>
pressure outside and inside the weigh hopper 12. In any case, one'of the<br>
main functions of the plant air 34 is to entrain the catalyst 14 and transfer it to<br>
an FCC unit. An air line 52 (especially on provided with a non-return valve<br>
54) carrying plant air stream 34 will most preferably pass under the hopper<br>
12. The bottom of the hopper 12 will be provided with a valve such as a ball<br>
valve 56 (preferably one provided with a so-called Thompson valve 58) so<br>
that catalyst 14 can be withdrawn from the bottom of the weigh hopper 12 and<br>
entrained in the plant air stream 34 when valve 56 is open. The stream of<br>
plant air 34 containing the catalyst 14 is then directed to the FCC unit via lines<br>
60 and 62. Line 62 also can be provided with a non-return valve 64 and ball<br>
valve 66 as indicated. Line 62 might also be provided with a metering<br>
indicator 68 to further check upon the function of the delivery system.<br>
	[031]	Again, the entrainment of the catalyst 14 into the stream of<br>
plant air 34 is preferably controlled by valve 58 which is, in turn, most<br>
preferably regulated and monitored by a computer memory and control device<br>
70. Most preferably, the computer memory and control device 70 also will be<br>
associated with those mechanical and electrical control and indicator devices<br>
normally associated with such processes and equipment in ways which are<br>
well known to this art. For example, the memory and control device 70 could<br>
be associated with an air supply indicator 72, a valve indicator 74, a manual<br>
test button 76, a drain 78, an air supply 79, a remote input 80, a Thompson <br>
valve signal 82, a pneumatic control device 84, and an override indicator 86<br>
generally depicted in Fig. 1.<br>
	[032]	In one preferred embodiment of this invention, a remote signal<br>
from the IFC addition hopper 12 would be sent to a remote location so that the<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2OO4/O33589	PCT/US2OO3/O2856I<br>
supplier would be able to ship the IFC to the refiner only as it is required. It is<br>
also possible to send separately each of the blending components to the<br>
refinery so that they can be blended in the addition hopper. This might be the<br>
case if any of the available components were available at another offsite<br>
facility.<br>
	[033]	In a preferred embodiment, the total FCC catalyst management<br>
system, the refiner's ECAT hopper would also be equipped with a catalyst<br>
weigh scale. This would allow the refiner to have an accurate record of the<br>
FCC unit withdrawals. Combining this withdrawal record with periodic ECAT<br>
analysis would allow the refiner to calculate the activity and composition of the<br>
ECAT hopper inventory. In a preferred embodiment, the ECAT hopper weigh<br>
scale system would send a signal to a remote location so that the ECAT<br>
hopper inventory could be controlled. Better still, it would allow for the IFC<br>
supplier to determine if the ECAT has a use as a blending component (after<br>
reactivation/demetalization) or should be sent to disposal, both of which could<br>
be arranged by catalyst management. Up until now, to determine the amount<br>
of ECAT withdrawal from the FCCU or the amount of ECAT in the ECAT<br>
hopper, the hopper would need to be depressured and measured by dropping<br>
a weighed measuring device from the top of the hopper to the ECAT level to<br>
get an outage. This outage was then converted to weight on a calculated<br>
graph. It is very evident, that this method is less than accurate.<br>
	[034]	Having described preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, it is to be understood that these are only exemplary, and the scope<br>
of the invention is to be determined by the appended claims and their<br>
equivalents.<br>
