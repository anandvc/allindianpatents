FIELD  OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a device for leakage detection in a self-closing valve<br>
of an LPG cylinder.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Every LPG Cylinder is provided with a Self Closing Valve (SC valve) on it.<br>
This valve will normally be in close condition and only when the spindle of<br>
the  valve is  pressed,   LPQ  inside  the cylinder,  which is in liquid form<br>
vapourises and passes through the valve into the regulator and further to the<br>
stove.<br>
The SC Valve has two in-built sealing means, to arrest any leak into the<br>
atmosphere. The two sealing means are facilitated by:<br>
L  Spindle Gasket<br>
2. Joint packing (or) O-Ring<br>
Both the said sealing means comprises moulded Nitrile rubber components.<br>
Item No. 1. is I-Stage sealing, positioned on the spindle of the valve, which<br>
protects any leak from the Valve, such type of leakage being called Valve Pin<br>
Leak.<br>
Item no. 2 is Il-Stage sealing, which prevents any leakage of the valve pin<br>
leak and normal gas flow into atmosphere. This is operational when the<br>
regulator or the safety cap is fixed on to the SC Valve.<br>
However, over a period of usage, both the sealing means may get worn off<br>
and  dirt accumulation may occur in the item  no.   1,  which may lead to<br>
leakage.<br>
All cylinders are checked for both the type of leakages (to ensure both the sealine means are in serviceable condition) at LPG filing plants, before<br><br>
dispatch to distributors and then to customers. If any leakage is detected during the existing checking process, the defective components are replaced or the valve is taken out of service. However there is always a minor possibility that cylinders with leaky valves as mentioned above might slip into the market considering the enormous volume of operation. It is therefore the object of the invention to provide a device, which can simultaneously detect in- situ the pin-leak and 'O'-ring-leak through the self-closing valve of the LPG cylinder,<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a portable leak detection device which is easy to operate and does not require any external power input. Still another object of the invention is to provide a device, which can be produced and operated economically and does not require any operational input besides an insignificant quantity of normal water.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly there is provided a device for leak detection in a self-closing valve of an LPG cylinder, the LPG cylinder having LPG in liquid form inside the cylinder, the self-closing valve of the cylinder having plurality of sealing means and when pressed through its spindle, emits vapourised LPG via a regulator to the stove, the device comprising atleast two individially consecutively applicable leakage detection means encapsuled in an enclosure for leakage detection through said self-closing valve, the first leak detection means comprising a tube having a top cap releasably fixed-at a top end of the tube; a nozzle attached to the tube at an opposite end; a top inner cap interposed at an upper end of the tube being pressably connected to said-top cap; a sleeve radially inwardly disposed at a lower end of the tube being press-fitted to said nozzle;; and a capillary tube extending upwardly being;<br><br>
flow ably connected to said nozzle, the second leak detection means comprising an open-ended tube having a top cap and a nozzle being pressably fixable at a top end and at a bottom end thereto, a float provided inside said open-ended tube being vertically displaceable under the pressure of the LPG when leaking through said self-closing valve of the LPG cylinder.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
Fig - 1 illustrates a device for leak detection (DLD) in a self - closing valve of an LPG-cylinder having liquefied petroleum gas in liquid form. Such a portable device can be conveniently used in-situ for checking the gas-leakage through the self-closing valve of the cylinder. The device does not require any external source of power or any operational input except a small quantity of water. The device (DLD) comprises basically two leak detection means (1,2)<br><br>
encapsuled in an enclosure which are individually consecutively applied over the self-closing valve to detect any gas-leakage through the in-built sealing means of the cylinder. The first leak detection means (1) which constitutes a pin-leak tester comprises a tube (5) having a top cap (3) which can be press-fit to the tube (5); a nozzle (9) is pressably fitted at a lower end of the tube (5); a top inner cap (4) is disposed inside the tube (5) which is connected to the top cap (3); a capillary tube (7) connected to the nozzle (9) which also accommodates a sleeve (6) being pressably fitted. The second leak detection means (2) which constitutes an 'O'-ring leak tester comprises an open-ended tube (12) having a top cap (l l)i a nozzle (15) is fitted at an opposite end of the tube (12); a float (13) interposed in the tube being displaceable vertically when under the pressure of leaked LPG.<br>
The nozzle (9) is provided with a through hole of 0 1.6 mm and the nozzle (15) is provided with a 0 0.9 mm hole from the 2,5 mm step to the central axis and hole of the same dia to meet from the center of the top 7.15 mm flat step. This top cap (3) is provided with a vent hole from top and the top cap (11) is provided with a vent hole from sides.<br>
rO'-Rings (16) are provided on the top caps (3,11) and the nozzles (9,15). A transparent sticker of 20 cms height to be pasted to indicate water level (6) on the first leak detector means (1).<br>
Capillary (7) to be inserted to the Nozzle (9) with a sealant (16). Further, Sleeve (6) is fitted on to the Nozzle by press fit. Top Inner cap (4) is fitted on to the Top cap (3) by press fit.<br>
Both the assembled parts are connected in between with the acrylic tube (5) and the bottom joint is provided with a sealant (16).<br>
The float (13) is positioned inside the tube (12) and connected to both the top cap (ll) and the nozzle (15) at both ends with a press fit. Sealant (16) are provided at both joints at the ends of the tube (12).<br><br>
Figures 2 and 3 represent individually sectional views of the first leak<br>
detection  means   (l)   and  the   second  detection means  (2)  detailing the<br>
constructional disposition of the constituent integers.<br>
Figure - 4 shows the working of the first leak detection means (1) which is<br>
applied first on the self-closing valve of the LPQ-cylinder.<br>
The first leak detection means (1) is to be placed on the cavity of Sc- valve.<br>
In case of leak, the same passes through the hole in the nozzle (9) and<br>
propagates through the SS capillary tube (7) inside the sleeve (6). The gas<br>
further gets filled in the empty space of the sleeve (6). Once the volume of<br>
leaked gas exceeds the empty space, it starts pushing the water inside the<br>
sleeve (6). When the water level (10) inside the sleeve (6) touches the hole at<br>
the bottom of the sleeve (6), it escapes out as bubble through the water<br>
medium outside the sleeve (6).<br>
The gas thus escaped, vents through the breather hole given in the Top inner<br>
cap (4) to the atmosphere.<br>
Fig- 5 illustrates the working of the second leak detection means (2) which is<br>
individually  consecutively   applied   to   the   self-closing  valve   of  the  LPG<br>
Cylinder.<br>
The Second leak detection means (2) is placed on the valve cavity and pressed<br>
and held towards the valve from top.<br>
The nozzle (15) presses the SC Valve spindle, thereby allowing LPG from the<br>
cylinder to fill the Valve cavity.<br>
Since the upper portion of the SC Valve is held sealed by the second leak<br>
detection means (2), any leak of ORing of SC Valve, escapes through the<br>
minute holes of the top portion of the nozzle (15) and emerges out to the<br>
acrylic tube (12) and lifts the float (13) inside the tube (12).<br>
The nozzles (9,15), the top caps (3, ll), the top inner cap (4) and the float (13)<br>
comprises molded nylon. The capillary tube (7) comprise stainless steel, the<br><br>
sealants and 'O' rings comprise nitrile rubber. The tubes (5,12) comprise<br>
acrylic.<br>
Althrough the present invention has been described with certain degree of<br>
particularity,   it   is   understood   that   the   description   of   the   preferred<br>
embodiment is by way of example only and that numerous changes to form<br>
