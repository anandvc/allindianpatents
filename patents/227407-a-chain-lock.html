				<td>Technical field<br>
The invention, relates to a chain lock for link chains having two lock parts which can be displaced by limited amounts with respect to each other in the longitudinal direction of the lock in order to open and close the lock and in each case have two ends which are connected to each other via a longitudinal web and of which in each case one forms a stud having a retaining web extending over part of the circumference of the stud and in each case one is provided with a recess serving to receive the stud and having a retaining groove for the retaining web.<br>
Prior art<br>
Chain locks of the above type are disclosed in DE 23 54 028 C and FR-A 2 333 170. The retaining webs of its studs, in the same manner as the retaining grooves of their recesses, have parallel side walls over a large part of their length. The same also applies to the retaining webs and retaining grooves of the studs and recesses of two other chain locks disclosed in DE 298 21 312 U and FR-A 2 333 170, in which the stud and the recess have end parts which widen  or  expand  increasingly  in  the  transverse<br><br>
direction toward the interior of the bow. In the case of both known constructions, during the installation and removal of the lock, the identically designed lock parts have to be displaced with respect to each other in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the lock by amounts which correspond to the length of the parallel side wall sections and which, on account of their size, make the opening and closing of the lock more  difficult.  A shortening of  the distance of longitudinal displacement is achieved in the case of a chain lock disclosed in DE 199 14 015 C by the fact that the retaining webs and the retaining grooves are provided in the region of their parallel side wall sections with intermediate spaces and cutouts which permit the lock parts to be joined together in a partially overlapping intermediate position by means of a movement directed perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the lock in order to subsequently join them together  along  a  relatively  short  distance  of displacement in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the lock. The known chain lock which is described last has retaining webs and retaining grooves with parallel side wall sections which - as experience has shown  -  then,   1ike  the  previously  described constructions, cause problems if the chain lock is to be opened after a relatively long period of use. This is because dirt and frictional corrosion between the studs and recesses which mesh together in a manner virtually free from play regularly lead to a type of adhesive connection between the studs and recesses, the strength of which is primarily determined by the size of the opposite, parallel side wall sections. Shortened distcuices of longitudinal displacement are also made possible by a chain lock which is disclosed in DE 298 11 337 u, in which the studs are provided only at their outer ends with extremely short retaining webs. The disadvantage of this lock is that the loads to be<br><br>
absorbed by the short retaining webs are extremely high and promote premature breakages of the lock. DE 83 20 392 U discloses a chain lock which has retaining webs serving at the ends of a curved web for engagement in grooves of recesses and in which the curved web of the one lock part fits into a curved longitudinal slot of the other lock part. It goes without saying that, in the case of this chain lock, the problem outlined is particularly severe. A chain lock for link chain is disclosed in DE 20304534 U.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The invention is based on the object of providing, without losses of strength, a chain lock of the type under consideration, in which not only are the distances of displacement of the lock parts that are required for opening and closing the lock comparatively short, as in the case of the chain lock according to DE 298 11 332 U, and which can therefore easily be opened even after relatively long periods of use. The above object is achieved according to the invention in a surprisingly simple manner by the fact that the stud and the recess have a cross section which widens or expands continuously in the longitudinal direction of the lock toward the interior of the lock.<br><br>
Tests have revealed that chain locks designed within the context of the invention can regularly be opened, even after long-term use, by means of a short blow of a hammer exerted on one of the lock parts after any securing elements which are present have been previously removed, the advantage indicated coming to fruition in particular if the stud has a plurality of retaining webs and the recess has a plurality of retaining grooves.<br>
Further features and details of the invention emerge from the sublimes and the description below of a preferred embodiment which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings<br>
In the drawings:<br>
fig. 1  shows, partially in section, the side view of a chain lock comprising two identical lock parts<br>
fig. 2 shows the perspective illustration of an individual lock part<br>
fig. 3  shows a side view of the lock part according to Fig, 2<br>
fig. 4 shows a section along the line IV-IV in fig. 3<br>
fig. 5 shows the plan view of the lock part according to figs 2 and 3<br>
fig. 6 shows a first side view of the lock parts to be connected, and<br><br>
fig. 7 shows a second side view of the lock parts to be connected.<br>
ways of  implementing the Invention<br>
Fig. 1 shows a chain lock, which comprises two identically designed lock parts 1 and 2, in the closed state. Details of the construction of the lock parts 1 and 2 emerge from figures 2 to 5.<br>
Each lock part has two ends 4 and 5 which are connected to each other via a longitudinal limb 3 and of which one is provided with a stud 6 and one is provided with a recess 7 serving to receive the stud 6 of the respective other lock part. The stud 6 and the recess 7 have a height H which is essentially identical to the inner width bi of the chain lock. Two retaining webs 8 and 9 provided on the stud 6 are assigned two retaining grooves 10 and 11 provided on the recess 7. As can be best be seen from fig. 5, both the studs 6 and the recess 7 have a cross section which widens or expands in the longitudinal direction of the chain lock toward the interior of the lock, i.e. neither the flanks of the retaining webs 8, 9 nor those side wall sections of the retaining grooves 10, 11 which are assigned to them run parallel to one another.  In the case of the embodiment illustrated in the figures, the flanks of the retaining webs 8, 9 are of wedge-shaped design, i.e. rectilinear design, and those side wall sections of the retaining grooves 10, 11 which are assigned to them form beveled surfaces matched to the wedge angle a. The angle a is to be of the order of magnitude of 10 to  30°;  in  the  embodiment  illustrated,  it  is approximately 15°.<br>
As can be seen wi th reference to a comparision of figures 6 and 7, the size of the angle a determines the minimum distance of displacement of the lock parts 1<br><br>
and 2 in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the chain lock. Fig. 6 illustrates the distance A by which the lock parts 1 and 2, after they have been joined together in the direction of the arrows 12 and 13, would have to be displaced in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the lock if the flanks of the retaining webs 8, 9 and the side wall sections of the retaining grooves 10, 11 were to run parallel to one another. Pig. 7 shows that the distance of longitudinal displacement can be shortened to a value a because of the wedge-shaped design of the flanks of the retaining webs 8, 9 and the bevel of the side wall sections of the retaining grooves 10, 11, the shortening facilitating both the installation and the removal. If the particular circumstances also permit easy installation and removal of the lock when long distances of displacement of the lock parts in the longitudinal direction are used, i.e. it matters only that the lock can be easily opened after long periods of use and severe stressing, the angle a may also assume values smaller than 10°.<br>
In conjunction with the easy releasability of the lock parts 1 and 2 from each other, in addition to the width bs of the retaining webs 8, 9 that is decisive for the strength, their height h, is also of importance. It should as far as possible neither drop below nor exceed values of 3 to 6 mm.<br>
14 and 15 are transverse holes for receiving cylindrical securing elements, which also serve for force transmission.<br><br><br>
