Referring first to Figure 1, a colour magnetic matrix display of the present invention comprises: a first glass plate 10 carrying a cathode 20 and a second glass plate 90 carrying a coating of sequentially arranged red, green and blue phosphor stripes 80 facing the cathode 20. The phosphors are preferably high voltage phosphors. A final anode layer (not shown) is disposed on the phosphor coating 80. A permanent magnet 60 is disposed between glass plates 90 and 10. The magnet is perforated by a two dimension matrix of perforation or "pixel wells" 70. An array of anodes 50 are formed on the surface of the magnet 60 facing the phosphors 80. For the purposes of explanation of the operation of the display, this surface will be referred to as the top of the magnet 60. There is a pair of deflection anodes 51 and 52 associated with each coliunn of the matrix of pixel wells 70. The anodes 51 and 52 of each pair extend along opposite sides of the corresponding column of pixel wells 70. A control grid 40 is formed on the surface of the magnet 60 facing the cathode 10. For the purposes of explanation of the operation of the display, this surface will be referred to as the bottom of the magnet 60. The control grid 40 comprises a first group of parallel control grid conductors extending across the magnet surface in a column direction and a second group of parallel control grid conductors extending across the magnet surface in a row direction so that each pixel well 70 is situated at the intersection of different combination of a row grid conductor and a column grid conductor. As will be described later, plates 10 and 90, and magnet 60 are brought together, sealed and then the whole is evacuated. In operation, electrons are released from the cathode and attracted towards control grid 40. Control grid 40 provides a row/column matrix addressing mechanism for selectively admitting electrons to each pixel well 70. Electrons pass<br><br>
through grid 40 into an addressed pixel well 70. In each pixel well 70, there is an intense magnetic field. The pair of anodes 51 and 52 at the top of pixel well 70 accelerate the electrons through pixel well 70 and provide selective sideways deflection of the emerging electron beam 30. Electron beam 30 is then accelerated towards a higher voltage anode formed on glass plate 90 to produce a high velocity electron beam 30 having sufficient energy to penetrate the anode and reach the underlying phosphors 80 resulting in light output. The higher voltage anode may typically be held at lOkV.<br>
The magnetic matrix display device is described in more detail in UK patent application No. GB 9517465.2, the contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The row and column conductors of control grid 40 each have their own drive signals. The combination of cathode 20, control grid 40, and deflection anodes 50 forms a tetrode structure for each pixel of the display. Matrix addressing by control grid 40 permits individual pixel control without individual row and column control for each pixel. This reduces driver requirements from X x Y for a given resolution to X + Y. Furthermore, with two sets of conductors (row and column) forming control grid 40 (row and column), one can be used for biasing the tetrode and the other used for controlling amplification of the electron beam 30.<br>
As mentioned above, the display is a matrix addressed device where each pixel lies at the intersection of a row conductor and a column conductor. Vhen drive voltages on intersecting row and column conductors are suitable, the pixel at the intersection will illuminate. Scanning may be organised as a raster scan. However, this may lead to low phosphor excitation times and high internal frequencies. A more desirable approach is to activate all pixels on an entire row or column simultaneously. This<br><br>
reduces internal data rate and increases phosphor excitation time, but may require more internal electronic circuitry.<br>
Active matrix liquid crystal displays typically activate an entire row simultaneously. The activated row then progresses down the screen. This is generally known in the art as "row scanning". In row scanning systems, each column has a corresponding analog driver. In a 640X480 pixel display therefore, with 640 pixels per row, the number of column drivers required is 640 per colour, giving 1920 column drivers in total.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention, column scanning is employed instead of row scanning. Thus for a 640X480 resolution display, the number of drivers is 480 per colour, giving 1520 row drivers in total. It will thus be appreciated then that column scanning offers a reduction in analog driver requirement over row scanning.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, an example of a display system of the present invention comprises a 1024 X 768 magnetic matrix display device. Each column conductor of control grid 40 (Figure 1) is connected to a separate output of column driver means 110. The coltimn driver means 110 comprises four 256 bit shift registers 111-114 connected in series with a common clock input CLK. Each row conductor of control grid 40 is connected to a separate output of row driver means 120. Row driver means 120 comprises 768 row drivers 130 split into blocks 121-123 of 256 row drivers 130. Inputs to row driver means 120 are provided by master timing and deserialiser logic 100 via a 24 bit data bus 101, an 8 bit address bus 102, a control bus 103 and timing signal lines 104. A data input together with clock input CLK' for column driver means 110 are also provided by master timing and deserialiser logic 100. Clock input CLK' is divided by 3 by counter 150 prior to application to the clock inputs CLK of column driver means 110.<br><br>
Referring now to Figure 5A, logic 100 comprises row driver load logic. The row driver load logic comprises a pixel clock recovery circuit 260. The output of clock recovery circuit 260 is connected to the input of a divide-by-24 counter 270. The output of counter 270 provides a data valid signal DV on control bus 103 and timing lines 104. The output of counter 270 is also connected to the input of a divide-by-256 counter 280 having an 8 bit parallel output connected to address bus 101. The output of counter 290 is connected to the input of a divide-by-three counter 290 having a two bit parallel output. The parallel output of counter 290 is connected to the input of a 2:3 demultiplexer 310. The outputs from demultiplexor 310 are connected to chip select lines S1-S3 on control bus 103. The output of counter 290 is connected to the input of a divide-by-two counter 300 having complementary outputs. The output of counter 260 are connected to LA and LB control lines of control bus 103.<br>
Referring now to Figure 5B, logic 100 also comprises row driver output logic constituted by counters 270-300, clock recovery circuit a pixel clock recovery circuit 260, and demultiplexor 310. The CHIP SELECT outputs of demultiplexor 310 are connected to red, green, and blue enable lines RE, GE, BE of control bus 103. The outputs of counter 300 are connected to SB and SA lines of timing lines 104.<br>
Referring now to Figure 5C, logic 100 further comprises an anode drive circuit for generating drive signals Al and A2 to drive anode drive means 140 to energise anodes 51 and 52. The anode drive circuit comprises first and second two input OR gates 320 and 330. One input of first OR gate 320 is connected to the RED ENABLE output of demultiplexor 310. The other input of OR gate 320 is connected to the GREEN ENABLE output of demultiplexor 310. The GREEN ENABLE OUTPUT of demultiplexor 310 is also connected to one input of the second OR gate 330. The other input of OR gate 330 is connected to the BLUE ENABLE output.<br><br>
Referring now to Figure 5D, logic 100 further includes column sequencing clock logic comprising counters 270, 280, and 290, and clock recovery circuit 260. The output CLK' of counter 290 is connected to clock input CLK of registers 111-114 of column drive means 110 via counter 150.<br>
Figure 6 shows an arrangement of logic 100 in which the column sequencing clock logic, anode drive logic, row driver load logic and row driver output logic are combined, with the inverting output of counter 300 providing the LA and LB signals on a single line LA/LB of control bus 103, and the non-inverting output of counter 300 providing the SA and SB signals on a signal line SB/SA of timing lines 104.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, each row driver 130 comprises a first 24 bit register 200 and a second 24 bit register each having parallel outputs selectively connectable to an 8 bit digital to analogue convertor (DAC) 190 via a 48:8 multiplexer 180. DAC 190 has an enable input connected to data valid line DV of timing lines 104. A 24:48 demultiplexor 160 selectively connects the registers 200 and 210 to the data bus 101. A controller 170 is connected to demultiplexor 160. Controller 170 is connected to address bus 102 and control bus 103. Multiplexer 180 has a first control input (not shown) connected to controller 170 and a second control input connected to line SB/SA of timing lines 104.<br>
In operation, logic 100 receives a serial video data stream from an external video source such as a display adaptor of a personal computer system. The image defined by the data stream is produced on the display device by sequentially driving each column in turn from the left hand side. All rows are driven simultaneously by their respective row drivers for each column scanned. Each pixel well 70 in the display device sequentially produces Red, Green and Blue Colours and therefore requires access to all colour information associated with the corresponding pixel.<br><br>
Referring to Figure 13, each pixel is represented in the data stream by 24 bit word. Each of the Red, Green and Blue colours of the pixel is defined by a different 8 bits of the word. Thus each pixel is associated with a total of 24 bits of colour information yielding 16777216 shades. First to arrive at logic 100 is Red Bit 0 and last to arrive is Blue Bit 7. The data stream is ordered such that, for each column, data is sent for all rows starting from the top row and finishing with the bottom row.<br>
Clock recovery circuit 260 reconstructs a pixel clock signal from the input data stream. Logic 100 also comprises a deserialiser (not shown) for converting the input data stream back into parallel data with reduced frequency. Logic 100 still further comprises a sync detector (not shown) for detecting frame and column synchronisation (sync) pulses from the input data stream for picture synchronisation.<br>
24 bit colour data extracted from the input data stream for each pixel is routed by logic 100 via data, address, and control buses 101-103 to the row driver associated with each row conductor of control grid 40. The colour data is clocked out to the recipient row conductor by timing control signals 104 derived from the reconstructed pixel clock and sync pulses.<br>
Concurrently with row conversion, column driver means 110 is switched under control of the pixel signal in such a manner that the each group of 768 24 bit colour data words loaded into the row drivers 130 actuates the correct column of pixels.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4, deflection anodes 51 and 52 are energised under control of waveforms Al and A2 respectively to scan electron beam 30 from each pixel well 70 across Red, Green and Blue phosphor stripes 80 in the order shown at 152. RED, GREEN and BLUE video signals are sequentially gated onto the row conductors in synchronisation with Al and A2. The clock<br><br>
inputs CLK to column driver means 110 is produced by reducing, via counter 150, the frequency of clock signal CLK' by an amount sufficient to accommodate beam indexing deflection signals Al an A2 so that for each column of pixels addressed, red, green and blue, phosphor stripes are scanned. Logic 100 produces a column drive pulse which is propagated by columns drive means 110 along register chain 111-114 as illustrated by waveforms COLUMN 1, COLUMN 2, COLUMN 3 up to COLUMN N to sequentially energise successive column conductors across the screen of the display (where N is the total number of columns, 1024 in the present example). Thus, the column drive signal sequentially selects each successive pixel in a given row as it passes along register chain 111-114. As mentioned earlier, each pixel in the display is associated with separate red, green and blue phosphor stripes. To scan each of these during one column period, two steps are taken: a) The 8 bits of data for the respective colour is routed from the relevant register 200 or 210 to DAC 190 and converted to produce a quantised analog level on the associated row; and, b) Deflection anodes 51 and 52 are driven such that the electron beam from the relevant pixel well 70 is directed onto the coloured phosphor stripe corresponding to the 8 bits of data converted by DAC 190.<br>
It will be appreciated from Figure 4 that three separate sets of colour data for Red, Green, and Blue are sequentially converted to analog signals during each column period. Deflection anode switching is synchronised to the conversions. Referring again to Figure 5D, counter 290 is provided in clock line CLK feeding column driver means 110 to facilitate this timing format.<br>
As mentioned earlier, the input video stream comprises a column sync signal and a frame sync signal. Each column sync pulse indicates that the video source is about to send a new column of colour data. The column sync pulse resets a clock recovery circuit 260 for each new column. Each frame sync pulse resets the column driver means 110 in preparation for the next<br><br>
frame and also provides a gate pulse 105 for brightness level sampling. The gate pulse 105 will discussed in detail later.<br>
Referring again to Figure 5A, the pixel clock signal recovered by recovery circuit 260 is first divided by 24 by counter 270. A division by 24 is chosen because data bus 101 is 24 bits wide. It will however be appreciated that, in other embodiments of the present invention, each data word may be greater than or less than 24 bits in length. The output of counter 270 is then divided by 256 by counter 280. The 8 parallel outputs of counter 280 address the 24 bits on data bus 101 to the appropriate row driver 130 via address bus 102. The output from counter 270 provides a DATA VALID signal to the appropriate row driver 130 via control bus 103. The output of counter 280 is then divided by counter 290. The 2 bit output of counter 290 provides a control input to demultiplexer 310. The output lines of demultiplexer 310 provide CHIP SELECT lines on control bus 103. Address bus 102 is connected to all three 256 row blocks 121-123 of row driver means 120. Thus each block 121-123 receives the same 8 bit address from counter 280. Each block 121-123 is selected sequentially by the CHIP SELECT output of demultiplexer 310 so that data from data bus 101 is only loaded into one of blocks 121-123 at a time. The complementary outputs LA/LB and SB/SA of counter 300 are toggled by the output of counter 290. The LA/LB line of control bus 103 is thus toggled between two states LA and LB. When the LA/LB line is in the LA state, controller 170 configures demultiplexer 160 to connect the data bus 101 to register 200. When the LA/LB line is in the LB state, controller 170 configures demultiplexer 160 to connect the data bus 101 to register 210. The data valid signal DV en control bus 170 triggers, via controller 170, the register connected to data bus 101 via demultiplexer 160 to load the 24 bit data word on the data bus 101. Whilst colour data for the next column is loaded from data bus 101 into one of registers 200 and 210, the data stored in the other of registers 200 and 210 is converted by DAC 190 into analog video levels for drivine the corresDondine row conductor.<br><br>
Thus, at any time, data can be loaded into one of registers 200 and 210 while the other register is providing data to the DAC 190. These events are completely asynchronous. However, both registers 200 and 210 cannot be accessed from the same side concurrently. This loading method advantageously permits data to be imported from the video source continuously and at a slower rate than conventional display systems as no blanking time is required.<br>
As mentioned earlier, multiplexer 180 has 48 inputs and 8 outputs. The inputs of multiplexer 180 are divided into two groups of 24, with one group connected to the output of register 200 and the other group connected to output of register 210. Each group is sub-divided into 3 sub¬groups of 8 inputs. Each sub-group is connected to different 8 bit portion, R, G, and B, of the corresponding register 200,210. Each 8 bit portion stored a different colour data value of the 24 bit pixel word loaded into the register 200,210. Referring back to Figure 5B, counter 300 toggles the SB/SA line of timing lines 104 between to states SB and SA. When the SB/SA line is in the SA state, the group of inputs of multiplexer 180 connected to register 200 is activated, vnien the SB/SA line is in the SB state, the group of inputs of multiplexer 180 connected to register 210 is activated. Enable lines RE, GE, and BE of control bus 103 select, via controller 107, which one of the 3 sub-groups of the group of inputs selected by the SB/SA line is connected to the 8 bit output of multiplexer 180 and thus to the input to DAC 190. The data valid signal DV of timing lines 104 causes DAC 190 convert the 8 bits selected via multiplexer 180 into an analog video level on the associated row conductor.<br>
The data rate of the incoming video stream may be of the order of 1.51 GigaBits/sec. The frequency of the pixel clock generated by recovery circuit may thus be of the order of 1.51 GHz. The data valid signal DV may thus have a frequency of 63MHz. The output of counter 280 may thus have a frequency of 250kHz. Thus, the output of counter 290 may have a frequency<br><br>
of 82kHz. It will thus be appreciated that, despite relatively high input data rates, most of logic 100 can be implemented with relatively low frequency, and thus relatively low cost semiconductor technology.<br>
In a modification to the preferred embodiment of the present invention hereinbefore described, there is provided brightness control means for adjusting the brightness and contrast control means for adjusting the contrast of the displayed image. Both the brightness and contrast control means operate by biasing the operating point of the aforementioned tetrode structure of each pixel. Specifically, in a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, brightness control is implemented by introducing a degree of adjustment to the quiescent operating current flowing between the cathode 20 and the final anode for all pixels of the display device. In an especially preferred embodiment of the present invention, contrast control is implemented by introducing a variable scaling factor to the transfer function of the DAC 190 in each row driver 130, eg: Vowit = kVr«f X DATA, where Vout is the output voltage from the DAG 190; Vr«f is the DAG reference voltage; DATA is the 8 bit input to the DAG; and, k is the variable scaling factor. It will be appreciated that k may be the same for each of Red, Green and Blue colour components of the pixels addressed by the DAC 190 to give contrast control only. Alternatively, there may be separate variables of k for each colour component, kr«a, kgreen, and k)&gt;i.u«, to provide colour control.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention hereinbefore described with reference to Figure 2, the outputs of the column drive means 110 were binary, having either a high voltage state allowing the row driver means 120 to set the pixel intensity or a low voltage state effectively disabling the corresponding column of pixels by preventing electron flow, even with maximum output for the row driver means 120.<br><br>
In a modification to the preferred embodiment of the present invention hereinbefore described, each output of the register chain 111-114 is connected to an individual transistor buffer circuit. The buffer circuits are all fed by a common variable brightness reference voltage. In operation, one of the buffer circuits is turned on by the corresponding output from the column river means 110, the reference voltage is effectively gated onto the corresponding column of pixels. A problem with this arrangement is that it introduces many more discrete electronic components to the display system (1024 buffer circuits).<br>
Referring now to Figure 7B, in an alternative modification of the preferred embodiment of the present invention hereinbefore described, the register chain 111-114 is replaced by an analog "bucket brigade" delay line 400'.<br>
Referring now to Figure 7A, a conventional bucket brigade delay line 400 comprises a chain 420 of charge coupled devices each having a tap 430 from which an incremental delay of an input signal Vm can be obtained in use. The taps 430 are connected to selection logic 410 which permits a user to program a desired delay into the delay line according to application.<br>
Referring back to Figure 7B, the aforementioned alternative modification of the preferred embodiment of the present invention the delay line 400' is modified from the conventional design by removing the selection logic 410. This is because all the taps are required to be made available. There are 1024 taps each connected to a different one of the column conductors of control grid 40. Column clock signal CLK is connected to a clock input of the delay line 400'.<br>
In operation, at the start of each frame, an adjustable voltage Vin is sampled by the first tap 430 of the chain 420. Each charge coupled<br><br>
device in the chain 420 transfers the sampled voltage to the next in response to the column clock signal from counter 150. The sampled voltage determines the brightness of the displayed picture. With the exception of the tap carrying the pulse, all taps of delay line 400' are held at a voltage below the cut-off or "black" level of the pixel tetrode structure to prevent spurious picture distortions. The sampled voltage is effectively produces a pulse which is shifted along the chain 420 by the column clock signal CLK. Figures 8A to 8C demonstrate the progress of the pulse through the delay line 400'.<br>
With reference to Figure 9A, one method of brightness control involves maintaining a constant amplitude contrast range imposed on a variable black level. Referring now to Figure 9B, another method of brightness control involves maintaining a constant peak output level and varying the black level at the expense of reduce contrast range. Either of these methods may be employed in embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Referring now to Figure 10, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the voltage level Vm sampled by delay line 400* is provided by a brightness control circuit comprising a potentiometer 440 connected at one end to a maximum brightness voltage level Vn«x and to a minimum brightness voltage level Vmm, where Vmm is at the black level of the pixel tetrode structure, at the other end. The wiper of the potentiometer 440 is connected to one input of a two input analog multiplexer 450. The other input of the multiplexer 450 is connected to Vmin. A control input to multiplexer 450 is connected to the frame sync signal FS from logic 100. he output from multiplexer 450 is connected to the input of delay line 400'. In operation, each frame sync pulse triggers the multiplexer 450 to shift the input to the delay line 400' from Ymm to the voltage level at the wiper of potentiometer 440. In the absence of a frame sync pulse, the input of delay line 400' is maintained at Vmm.<br><br>
Referring now to Figure 11, in a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the DAC 190 of each row driver 130 is an 8 bit current mode DAC comprising a bank of ratioed current sinks 490. Sinks 490 are selectively connectable in parallel in dependence upon the 8 bit input DATA from multiplexer 180 via a switch array 480. A transconductance amplifier 460 is connected to the switch array 480. A variable current reference 470 is connected to the sinks 490.<br>
In operation, the sum lout of the currents flowing through sinks 490 is drawn out through switch array 480. Sinks 490 are selectively connectable in parallel via switch array 480 in accordance with 8 bit input DATA. The summed current is converted to an output voltage Vout for driving the row conductors by transconductance stage 460. The summed current passed through sinks 480 is diimped to suitable reference voltage supply rail. Although the ratio of current sinks 480 is fixed, the absolute current for each sink is determined by current reference 470. Current reference 470 is set by external voltage input Vref. It will thus be appreciated that variable contrast control may be provided by introducing means for varying Vw&gt;f. Vref allows true analog control over the output of DAC 190 rather than quantised control.<br>
Referring now to Figure 12, an especially preferred embodiment of the present invention, includes combined contrast and colour control means for varying reference voltage Vref to DACs 190. The contrast and colour control means comprises a potentiometer 500 having a track connected at one end to a higher level voltage supply V+ and at the other end to a lower level voltage supply. The wiper of potentiometer 500 is connected to the input of a buffer amplifier 390. The output of buffer 390 is connected to one end of the tracks of three potentiometers 501-503. The other end of the tracks of potentiometers 501-503 is connected to the lower voltage supply. The wipers of potentiometers 501-503 are connected to the inputs of an analogue multiplexer 400. Multiplexer 400 has two control inputs<br><br>
each of which is connected to a different one of beam indexing signals Al and A2. The output of multiplexer 400 is connected to the Vr«f input of the DACs 190.<br>
In operation, a user can adjust the contrast of the display by adjusting potentiometer 500. The voltage selected by potentiometer 500 is then provided to potentiometers 501-503 via buffer 390. Each colour intensity can be adjusted relative to the other colour intensities by adjusting a corresponding one of potentiometers 501-503. As aforementioned, each row driver sequentially converts R, G, and B data into row drive voltages for each pixel in the corresponding row. In synchronisation with the sequential conversion, the electron beam corresponding to each pixel is sequentially indexed to each colour sub-pixel of the pixel by indexing signals Al and A2. The indexing signals selected the colour control voltage via multiplexer 400 corresponding to the sub-pixel indexed, thereby setting Vref in accordance with colour. By varying reference voltage Vref as each colour is converted, variations in relative colour intensity may be introduced. By applying the contrast control voltage to the input of the colour control, the colour control values track each other, thereby maintaining a constant colour point of the display despite changes in contrast setting.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention have been hereinbefore described with reference to a magnetic matrix display. It will however, be appreciated that at least some of the features described may be applicable to other display technologies such as, for example, field emission display technologies.<br>
