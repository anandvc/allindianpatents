				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to Bi-directional AC or DC Voltage Regulator and to the<br>
field of electrical power supplies.<br>
Background Art<br>
A conventional AC variable transformer (a variac) for stepping down a mains voltage, for<br>
example 230 volts AC to a reduced AC voltage, comprises AC voltage input terminals,<br>
across which is connected an inductive winding, and AC output terminals, which draw<br>
power from the winding at a selectable voltage, depending upon where a wiper blade is<br>
positioned along the winding. The wiper is typically a rotating wiper which rotates across<br>
the winding which is formed in a substantially cylindrical or ring shape. The wiper may be<br>
driven by a servo motor, in order to automatically move the wiper, thus varying the<br>
output voltage in response to a control signal.<br>
However, the conventional variac has the problems of high weight, large size and poor<br>
response time in moving the wiper blade, and produces noise which is fed back onto the<br>
mains supply and through to the output terminals.<br>
An apparatus which has been used in DC power systems to transform and regulate<br>
voltage is the Cu<br>
k converter. Such a device is described in US 4, 186, 437 and in a<br>
paper entitled "Topologies of Bidirectional PWM DC-DC Power Converters" from the<br>
1993 IEEE National Aerospace and Electronics Conference. A basic topology Cuk<br>
converter, has a circuit comprising input and output choke inductances, an energy-<br>
transfer capacitor, an output smoothing capacitor, a diode and a switching transistor.<br>
This arrangement permits the DC output voltage to be stepped up or stepped down for a<br>
given input voltage depending on the proportion of time the transistor conducts during a<br>
period of its operation. This ratio is known as the duty cycle of the transistor.<br>
During a first time interval when the transistor is off, the diode is forward biased and the<br>
capacitor is charged in the positive direction through the inductor. During a second time<br>
interval, the transistor is turned on, and the capacitor becomes connected across the<br>
diode, reverse biasing it. Thus, the energy transfer capacitor discharges through the load<br>
and the output inductance, charging the output capacitor to a negative potential.<br>
The circuit operation is repeated when the transistor is turned off again.<br>
The DC output voltage Vout is dependent upon a number of parameters. Firstly the input<br>
voltage Vin naturally effects the voltage value across the output terminals of the<br>
converter. If all other parameters are kept constant and the input voltage Vin is increased,<br>
the DC output voltage of the converter will also increase. As discussed previously,<br>
the duty cycle (5) of conduction of the transistor is another parameter which effects the<br>
DC output voltage Vout. A high duty cycle (5) may yield a stepped up voltage at the output<br>
terminals, while a low duty cycle (5) will produce an output voltage Vout which is, smaller<br>
in magnitude than the input voltage Vin. The remaining principal parameter which<br>
controls converter performance is the converter circuit efficiency (e).<br>
It has been evaluated that the voltage relationship between the output signal and the<br>
input signal is as follows :<br>
Vout/Vin = de/(1-d)<br>
Further extensions of the converter have a similar operation to that discussed above.<br>
In another embodiment of a Cuk converter, the input and output choke inductors are<br>
coupled by a common core. There are obvious advantages in developing the converter<br>
in this way, namely, reductions in converter size, weight and component numbers,<br>
while the basic DC-to-DC conversion properties of the converter remain unchanged.<br>
Further, it has been shown that a significant reduction in ripple current magnitudes can<br>
be achieved by magnetic coupling of the choke inductances.<br>
An isolating transformer can be introduced to the Cuk converter to provide galvanic<br>
isolation between the output and the input voltages Vout and Vin. As the transformer<br>
is isolated by the two energy-transfer capacitors, no DC transformer core magnetization<br>
can take place.<br>
The Cuk converter may have coupling of the input and output inductances an isolating<br>
transformer. This converter benefits from the features described above but its basic<br>
operation remains unchanged.<br>
The Cuk converters discussed so far permit only DC voltage/current transformation and<br>
allow power to flow in one direction only. In order to fully understand the invention, a<br>
further possible extension of the Cuk converter is described below.<br>
Although the converter is similar to a basic topology Cuk converter and is essentially a<br>
DC regulator the additional components, a second transistor and second diode, permit<br>
bi-directional operation of the converter.<br>
The controlling signals supplying the base of the transistors switch each of the<br>
transistors on and off alternately, in anti-phase with each other.<br>
During a first time interval, when the first transistor is off and the second transistor is on,<br>
the first diode is forward biased and the energy-transfer capacitor is charged in the<br>
positive direction through the input inductor.<br>
During a second time interval, when the first transistor is on and the second transistor is<br>
of the energy transfer capacitor is connected across the first diode, reverse biasing it.<br>
Therefore, the energy-transfer capacitor discharges through the output load and<br>
inductance, and in the process charges the output capacitance to a negative potential.<br>
The circuit operation described above is similar to that of a basic topology Cuk converter.<br>
However, this converter is symmetrical in respect of the inputs and the outputs, and<br>
therefore will permit power flow in either direction.<br>
As described previously, use can be made of a common core to couple the input and<br>
output choke inductances to reduce ripple, and/or an isolating transformer to provide<br>
galvanic isolation.<br>
Cuk converter technology has been used exclusively to convert a DC input voltage<br>
to a DC output voltage, and is essentially unidirectional in terms of power flow.<br>
A further example of the prior art is given in US 5,321,597<br>
which discloses a complex Cuk-like circuit which is<br>
primarily used as a galvanic isolation, device for DC<br>
electrical signals.<br>
The present Application addresses the problem of providing<br>
an apparatus which permits bi-directional power flow so as<br>
to be able to accommodate regenerative load currents. In<br>
a preferred aspect, the invention provides an AC or DC<br>
voltage regulator/converter which, while functionally<br>
analogous to conventional iron/copper AC transformers,<br>
benefits from solid state control so as to permit a<br>
reduction in weight, size and cost while improving<br>
performance when compared to conventional means.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention there is<br>
provided a bi-directional AC or DC voltage regulator<br>
having a controller, an input circuit and an output<br>
circuit, the input and output circuits being capacitively<br>
coupled one to the other and being symmetrical one<br>
relative to the other, wherein each circuit comprises two<br>
terminals across which are connected a capacitor and, in<br>
parallel with the capacitor, a series connection of an<br>
inductor and a switching network controlled by the<br>
controller wherein;<br>
each switching network has two branches in<br>
anti-parallel, and<br>
each branch comprises a switching means (Q1,Q2;<br>
Q3,Q4) for permitting only uni-directional current, flow;<br>
CHARACTERIZED IN THAT:<br>

switching means in the input circuit which, if closed,<br>
would permit current flow through the switching network,<br>
and simultaneously operates the oppositely aligned<br>
switching means in the output circuit so that it is in the<br>
opposite switching state to the high frequency operated<br>
switching means in the input circuit.<br>
Preferably, an isolation transformer in conjunction with a<br>
pair of energy transfer capacitors can be inserted between<br>
the input and output circuits permitting magnetic and<br>
capacitive coupling thereof. Alternatively, the input and<br>
output circuits may be coupled capacitively only, through<br>
a single energy transfer capacitor.<br>
Where a transformer is used to couple the input circuit to<br>
the output circuit, the turns ratio may be selected so as<br>
to establish the required output voltage range for a given<br>
input voltage.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
inductor of the input circuit is magnetically coupled to<br>
the inductor of the output circuit.<br>
Preferably, each switching means effectively comprises a<br>
series connection of a transistor and an aligned diode.<br>
Preferably, the controller monitors the polarity of the<br>
input voltage so as to establish which of the switching<br>
means would, if closed, permit current to flow through the<br>
switching network.<br>
Preferably, the duty cycle of the transistors in the input<br>
and output circuits which are operated at high frequency<br>
can be varied so as to vary the actual output voltage<br>
within an output voltage range.<br>
Preferably, those transistors not operated at high<br>
frequency are held closed.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF CONVENTIONAL ART<br>
A basic topology Cuk converter, as illustrated in Figure 1 of the drawings, has a circuit<br>
comprising input and output choke inductances L1 and L2, an energy-transfer capacitor<br>
C1, an output smoothing capacitor C2, a diode D1 and a switching transistor Q1.<br>
This arrangement permits the DC output voltage to be stepped up or stepped down for a<br>
given input voltage depending on the proportion of time the transistor Q1 conducts<br>
during a period of its operation. This ratio is known as the duty cycle of the transistor.<br>
During a first time interval when the transistor Q1 is off. the diode D1 is forward biased<br>
and the capacitor C1 is charged in the positive direction through the inductor L1. During<br>
a second time interval, the transistor Q1 is turned on, and the capacitor C1 becomes<br>
connected across the diode D , reverse biasing it. Thus the energy transfer capacitor C1<br>
discharges through the load and the output inductance L2, charging the output capacitor<br>
C2 to a negative potential. The circuit operation is repeated when the transistor Q1 is<br>
turned off again.<br>
The DC output voltage Vout is dependent upon a number of parameters. Firstly, the input<br>
voltage Vin naturally effects the voltage value across the output terminals of the<br>
converter. If all other parameters are kept constant and the input voltage Vin is increased,<br>
the DC output voltage of the converter will also increase. As discussed previously, the<br>
duty cycle (6) of conduction of the transistor Q1 is another parameter which effects the<br>
DC output voltage Vout. A high duty cycle (5) may yield a stepped up voltage at the<br>
output terminals, while a low duty cycle (5) will produce an output voltage Vout which is,<br>
smaller in magnitude than the input voltage Vin. The remaining principal parameter which<br>
controls converter performance is the converter circuit efficiency (e).<br>
It has been evaluated that the voltage relationship between the output signal and the<br>
input signal is as follows:<br>
Vout/Vin = de/(1-d)<br>
Further extensions of the converter, illustrated in Figures 2 to 4, have a similar operation<br>
to that discussed above.<br>
Figure 2 shows a Cuk converter in which the. input and output choke inductors L1 and<br>
L2 are coupled by a common core. There are obvious advantages in developing the<br>
converter in this way, namely, reductions in converter size, weight and component<br>
numbers, while the basic DC-to-DC conversion properties of the converter remain<br>
unchanged. Further, it has been shown that a significant reduction in ripple current<br>
magnitudes can be achieved by magnetic coupling of the choke inductances L1 and<br>
L2.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates how an isolating transformer TX1 can be introduced to the Cuk<br>
converter to provide galvanic isolation between the output and the input voltages Vout<br>
and Vin. As the transformer TX is isolated by the two energy-transfer capacitors Cla<br>
and Clb, no DC transformer core magnetization can take place.<br>
The Cuk converter illustrated in Figure 4 has coupling of the input and output<br>
inductances L1 and L2 and an isolating transformer TX1. This converter benefits from<br>
the features described above but its basic operation remains unchanged.<br>
The Cuk converters discussed so far permit only DC voltage/current transformation and<br>
allow power to flow in one direction only. In order to fully understand the invention, a<br>
further possible extension of the Cuk converter is described below, with reference to<br>
Figures 5 and 6 of the drawings.<br>
Although the converter illustrated in Figure 5 is similar to a basic topology Cuk converter<br>
and is essentially a DC regulator the additional components, a second transistor Q2 and<br>
second diode D2, permit bi-directional operation of the converter.<br>
The controlling signals supplying the base of the transistors switch each of the<br>
transistors on and off alternately, in anti-phase with each other.<br>
During a first time interval, when the first transistor Q1 is off and the second transistor<br>
Q2 is on, the first diode D1 is forward biased and the energy-transfer capacitor C1<br>
is charged in the positive direction through the input inductor L1.<br>
During a second time interval, when the first transistor Q1 is on and the<br>
second transistor Q2 is of the energy transfer capacitor C1 is connected across the<br>
first diode D1, reverse biasing it. Therefore, the energy-transfer capacitor C1 discharges<br>
through the output load and inductance L2, and in the process charges the output<br>
capacitance C2b to a negative potential.<br>
The circuit operation described above is similar to that of a basic topology Cuk converter.<br>
However, the converter of Figure 5 is symmetrical in respect of the inputs and the<br>
outputs, and therefore will permit power flow in either direction.<br>
As described previously, use can be made of a common core to couple the input and<br>
output choke inductances LI and L2 to reduce ripple, and/or an isolating transformer<br>
TX1 to provide galvanic isolation. Figure 6 illustrates the addition of such an isolating<br>
transformer TX1 to this circuit of Figure 5.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to Figure 7 of the drawings, a bi-directional AC or DC voltage<br>
regulator/transformer according to the invention comprises an input circuit and an output<br>
circuit which is symmetrical to the input circuit. As the regulator/transformer is fully<br>
symmetrical with regard to the input and output terminals, power may flow in either<br>
direction giving the regulator/transformer its bi-directional characteristics. As such, the<br>
input and output terminals can be interchanged. The regulator/transformer will first be<br>
described with reference to an AC input.<br>
Since the two circuits are symmetrical, it is only<br>
necessary to describe the arrangement of the components<br>
within one of the circuits. This is sufficient to develop<br>
a full understanding of the construction of the<br>
regulator/transformer.<br>
The input circuit has two terminals AC1 and AC2 across<br>
which are connected a capacitor C2a and, in parallel with<br>
the capacitor C2a, a choke inductor L1 serially connected<br>
to an energy-transfer capacitor Cla which in turn is<br>
connected to a winding of an isolating transformer TX1<br>
that magnetically couples the input and output circuits.<br>
A switching network S1, comprising two diodes D1 and D2<br>
and two transistors Ql and Q2, is connected between the<br>
inductor L1/capacitor Cla junction and the transformer<br>
winding/terminal AC2 junction of the circuit.<br>
Firstly it is necessary to consider a period during which<br>
terminal AC1 is positive with respect to terminal AC2 and<br>
load current is in phase with load voltage. Transistor Q2<br>
and transistor Q3 are held on and therefore, in<br>
conjunction with diode D2 and diode D3, provide<br>
bi-directional current paths. During this period<br>
transistors Ql and Q4 switch alternately at high frequency<br>
in response to a high frequency control signal from the<br>
controller. For a first time interval of this high<br>
frequency alternation, transistor Ql is off and transistor<br>
Q4 is on. During this interval diode D4 is forward biased<br>
and. the energy transfer capacitors Cla and Clb charge<br>
through the choke inductor L1. During a second time<br>
interval of the high frequency alternation, the switching<br>
states of transistors Ql and Q4 are reversed. Once this<br>
occurs, the energy transfer capacitors Cla and Clb<br>
discharge, driving current through the output load via<br>
inductance L2, and charging the output capacitor C2b.<br>
Circuit operation is repeated when transistor Ql is turned<br>
off and transistor Q4 is turned on again.<br>
Secondly it is necessary to consider a period during which<br>
terminal AC1 is positive with respect to terminal A.C2 and<br>
load current is out of phase with load voltage. Transistor<br>
Q2 and transistor Q3 are held on and therefore, in<br>
conjunction with diode D2 and diode D3, provide<br>
bi-directional current paths. During this period<br>
transistors Ql and Q4 switch alternately at high frequency<br>
in response to the high frequency control signal from the<br>
controller. For a first time interval of this high<br>
frequency alternation, transistor Q4 is off and transistor<br>
Ql is oa. During this interval diode Dl is forward biased<br>
and the energy transfer capacitors Cla and Clb charge<br>
through the choke inductor L2. During a second time<br>
interval of the high frequency alternation, the switching<br>
states of transistors Ql and Q4 are reversed. Once this<br>
occurs, the energy transfer capacitors Cla and Clb<br>
discharge, driving current out through the input terminals<br>
via inductance L1, and charging the input capacitor C2a.<br>
Circuit operation is repeated when transistor Q4 is turned<br>
off and transistor Ql is turned on again.<br>
Thirdly it is necessary to consider a period during which<br>
terminal AC1 is negative with respect to terminal AC2 and<br>
load current is in phase with load voltage. Transistor Ql<br>
and transistor Q4 are held on and therefore, in<br>
conjunction with diode Dl and diode D4, provide<br>
bi-directional current paths. During this period<br>
transistors Q2 and Q3 switch alternately at high frequency<br>
in response to the high frequency control signal from the<br>
controller. For a first time interval of this high<br>
frequency alternation, transistor Q2 is off and transistor<br>
Q3 is on. During this interval diode D3 is forward biased<br>
and the energy transfer capacitors Cla and Clb charge<br>
through the choke inductor Ll. During a second time<br>
interval of the high frequency alternation, the switching<br>
states of transistors Q2 and Q3 are reversed. Once this<br>
occurs, the energy transfer capacitors Cla and. Clb<br>
discharge, driving current through the output load via<br>
inductance L2, and charging the output capacitor C2b.<br>
Circuit operation is repeated when transistor Q2 is turned<br>
off and Q3 is turned on again.<br>
Fourthly it is necessary to consider a period during which<br>
terminal AC1 is negative with respect to terminal AC2 and<br>
load current is out of phase with load voltage. Transistor<br>
Q1 and transistor 0.4 are held on and therefore, in<br>
conjunction with diode Dl and diode D4, provide<br>
bi-directional current paths. During this period<br>
transistors Q2 and Q3 switch alternately at high frequency<br>
in response to the high frequency control signal from the<br>
controller. For a first time interval of this high<br>
frequency alternation, transistor Q3 is off and transistor<br>
Q2 is on. During this interval diode D2 is forward biased<br>
and the energy transfer capacitors Cla and Clb charge<br>
through the choke inductor L2. During a second time<br>
interval of the high frequency alternation, the switching<br>
states of transistors Q2 and Q3 are reversed. Once this<br>
occurs, the energy transfer capacitors Cla and Clb<br>
discharge, driving current out through the input terminals<br>
via inductance L1, and charging the input capacitor C2a.<br>
Circuit operation is repeated when transistor Q3 is turned<br>
off and transistor Q2 is turned on again.<br>
The output voltage Vout across the output terminals AC3<br>
and AC4 is dependent upon the input voltage Vin and the<br>
high frequency switching duty cycle of S1 and S2. Thus if<br>
the input voltage amplitude Vin is sinusoidal, the output<br>
voltage Vout will follow in proportion dependent upon the<br>
high frequency switching duty cycle of S1 and S2 and the<br>
turns ratio of the isolating transformer TX1.<br>
When pairs of transistors are switched in the manner<br>
described above, it is possible to transform AC voltages<br>
in proportion to the duty cycle of the control signal and<br>
the turns ratio of the transformer TX1. In addition<br>
refinement of the high frequency control signal source,<br>
which alternately controls pairs of transistors, will<br>
permit harmonic distortion correction, synthesis of<br>
harmonics and/or fast acting regulation control to<br>
compensate for voltage drops in the circuit, mains voltage<br>
fluctuations and load variance. The frequency of the<br>
control signal is preferably from one to several orders of<br>
magnitude greater than the AC input frequency and may be,<br>
for example, from 500 Hertz to 250 KHertz.<br>
It will readily be understood from the above description<br>
that exactly the same circuitry and controller will<br>
produce, from a DC input, a regulated DC output. Power<br>
can flow through the converter in either direction,<br>
whether used with an AC supply or a DC supply.<br>
In Figure 7 the two branches of each switching network S1<br>
and S2 are illustrated as a pair of series-connected<br>
transistors and diodes, Q1-D2 and Q2-D1 for example,<br>
connected at their transistor-diode junctions. This<br>
topography enables the use of integrated circuit<br>
sub-assemblies of Ql and Dl, and Q2 and D2. Functionally,<br>
however, the transistor-diode uni-directional switching<br>
means of Figure 7 is exactly the same as that of Figure 8<br>
in which two discrete branches are shown for each<br>
switching network.<br>
In Figure 8 the input circuit and output circuit are shown<br>
as being coupled, not by the capacitors C1a and C1b and<br>
isolating transformer TX1 of Figure 7, but by a capacitor<br>
Cl which is connected between the inductor (L1,<br>
L2)/switching network (Sl;S2) junctions of both circuits;<br>
and by a. direct connection of the switching network (S1;<br>
S2)/terminal (AC2; AC4) junctions of both circuits. The<br>
circuit of Figure 8 loses the step up/step down function<br>

of the output circuit.<br>
6. A bi-directional AC or DC voltage regulator as claimed in any preceding claim,<br>
wherein each switching means comprises a series connection of a transistor (Q1, Q2 ;<br>
Q3, Q4) and an aligned diode (D2, D1 ; D4, D3).<br>
7. A bi-directional AC or DC voltage regulator as claimed in any preceding claim<br>
wherein the controller monitors the polarity of the input voltage so as to establish which<br>
pair of the switching means (Q1, D2 or Q2, D1 in the input circuit, and Q4, D3 or Q3, D4<br>
in the output circuit) would, if closed, permit current to flow through the respective<br>
switching networks (S1 and S2).<br>
8. A bi-directional AC or DC voltage regulator as claimed in any preceding claim,<br>
wherein the duty cycle of the switching means (Q1 or Q2) in the input circuit and the<br>
switching means (Q4 or Q3) in the output circuit operated at high frequency can be<br>
varied so as to vary the actual output voltage within an output voltage range.<br>
9. A bi-directional AC or DC voltage regulator as claimed in any preceding claim,<br>
wherein the switching means (Q2 or Q1) in the input circuit and the switching means<br>
(Q4 or Q3) in the output circuit which are not operated by the controller at high<br>
frequency are held closed.<br>
The invention provides a bi-directional AC or DC voltage<br>
regulator having a controller, an input circuit and an<br>
output circuit, the input and output circuits being<br>
capacitively coupled one to the other and being symmetrical<br>
one relative to the other, wherein each circuit comprises<br>
two terminals (AC1, AC2; AC3, AC4) across which are<br>
connected a capacitor (C2a; C2b) and, in parallel with the<br>
capacitor (C2a; C2b), a series connection of an inductor<br>
(L1; L2) and a switching network (S1; S2) controlled by the<br>
controller. Each switching network (S1; S2) has two<br>
branches in anti-parallel, of which each branch permits<br>
only uni-directional current flow and comprises a switching<br>
means. Since both branches of each switching network<br>
comprise switching means, then the device may be<br>
constructed as an AC or DC regulator/transformer which<br>
retains the capacity to permit bi-directional power flow.</td>
