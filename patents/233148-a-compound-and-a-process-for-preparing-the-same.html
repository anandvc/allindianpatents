				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a cannabidiol compound being antiinflammatory agent having analgesic, antianxiety, anticonvulsive, neuroprotective, antipsychotic and anticancer activity.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Cannabidiol (CBD, la) is the major non-psychotropic cannabinoid in most Cannabis preparations, such as hashish and marihuana.CBD causes none of the psychotropic effects typical ofA9-tetrahydrocannabinol (A9-THC) (Martin, Pharmacol. Rev.. 38, 45-74 1986). CBD does not bind to the known cannabinoid receptors CB1 or CB2. and therefore does not cause the central or peripheral effects mediated by these receptors. However it has been shown in in vitro assays, in animal tests, as well as in some human, preliminary trials, to produce numerous pharmacological effects, some of which are of potential therapeutic value. Thus, recent reports describe the in vitro effects of CBD on immune cells, such as the inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production by mouse peritoneal macrophages and the suppression of TNF, IL-lÎ± and IFNy by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Coffey etal.. Intern. J.lmmunopharmacol.. 18, 749-752 L1996J; Watzl etal. Int. J. Immunopharmicol.. 13, 1091-1093 [1991 J;Srivastava etal., Immunopharmacol., 179-185 [1998]: for a review see Klein etal.. Immunol. Today. 19,373-381 [1998])and"Malfait etal.. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.[U. S. A.]. 97.9561-9566[2000].". These in vitro studies lend support to earlier reports on analgesic andantiinllammatory effects in animals. Formukong etal., (inflammation 12. 361-371 [1988]) have found that CBD is much more potent than aspirin in thephenylbenzoquinone writhing test in mice (a standard analgesic assay). In the tetradecanovlphorbolacetable (IPA) induced erythema of mouse ear (anantiinflammatory assay) CBD caused 92% inhibition of the inflammation response on application of a l00ug/ml solution. CBD has been found to produce several, potentially therapeutic, effects in animal models, as well as in patients with neurological diseases (for a review seeConsroe.(Neurobiol. Disease,5 534-551 [1998]). in anxiety (Guimaraes etal.Gen.Pharmacol., 25, 161-164[1994] ; Zuardi etal., Psychopharmacology [Berlin], 76<br>
Sci.[U. S. A.], 97,9561-9566[2000].". These in vitro studies lend support to earlier reports on analgesic andantiinflammatory effects in animals. Formukong etal., (inflammation 12, 361-371 [1988]) have found that CBD is much more potent than aspirin in thephenylbenzoquinone writhing test in mice (a standard analgesic assay). In the tetradecanoylphorbolacetable (TPA) induced erythema of mouse ear (anantiinflammatory assay) CBD caused 92% inhibition of the inflammation response on application of a lOOug/ml solution. CBD has been found to produce several, potentially therapeutic, effects in animal models, as well as in patients with neurological diseases (for a review seeConsroe,(Neurobiol. Disease,_5 534-551 [1998]), in anxiety (Guimaraes etal.,Gen.Pharmacol., 25, 161-164[1994] ; Zuardi etal., Psychopharmacology [Berlin], 76, 245-250 [1982] and in psychosis (Zuardi et al., J. Clin. Psychiatry, 56, 485-486 [1995]. Hampson et al., (Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA, 95, 8268-8273 [1998]) have found that CBD is an neuroprotective antioxidant.<br>
Surprisingly, while the enantiomeric THC's differ in their biological activity (Mechoulam et ai., "Marijuana/cannabinoids: neurobiology and neurophysiology" ed. L. Murphy and A. Bartke, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, pp 1-33 [1992]), both CBD enantiomers have the same anticonvulsive and certain hormonal profiles (Leite et al., Pharmacol., 124, 141-146 [1982]; Cordova et al., Psychoneuroendocrinology, 5, 53-62 [1980]). However the comparative pharmacology of CBD enantiomers has not been further explored. Also the syntheses and the pharmacology of CBD metabolites are unknown.<br>
Said syntheses and the pharmacology have now been explored and it has surprisingly been found that compounds of general formula I<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which R" stands for COOH or CH2OH; and R" stands for<br>
a.	straight or branched alkyl of 5 to 12 carbon atoms;<br>
b.	a group -O-R'", where R"' is straight or branched alkyl of 5 to 9 carbon atoms,<br>
or a straight or branched alkyl substituted at the terminal carbon atom by a<br>
phenyl group;<br>
c.	a group - (CH2)n-O-alkyl, where n is an integer from 1 to 7 and the alkyl group<br>
contains 1 to 5 carbon atoms, and<br>
pharmaceutic compositions comprising same, are antiinflammatory agents and which have analgesic, antianxiety, anticonvulsive, neuroprotective, antipsychotic and anticancer, activity.<br>
The present invention thus consists in pharmaceutical preparations comprising!! compounds of genera! formula I being antiinflammatory agents, which have<br>
analgesic, antianxiety, anticonvulsive, neuroprotective, antipsychotic and anticancer activity comprising as active ingredient a compound of general formula I.<br>
The compounds of general formula I excluding those in which R" stands for C5H11 are novel and are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations according to the present invention may have any suitable form, e. g. be a tablet, a capsule, a granule, a suspension, a solution, etc. They may comprise in addition to the active ingredient an excipient, such as a carrier, a disintegrant, a lubricant, a stabilizer, a flavoring agent and even an other pharmaceutical effective compound.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations according to the present invention may be prepared by conventional methods. They comprise the various ingredients in the required amounts.<br>
The compounds of general formula and the pharmaceutical preparations comprising same are advantageously provided to the patient in a daily dosage of the compound in between 0.01 and 20 mg/kg<br>
The present invention consists also in the use of a compound of general formula I and pharmaceutical composition comprising same in the preparation of a medicament.<br>
The present invention also consists in a method for the treatment of human<br>
beings with a compound of general formula I or with a pharmaceutical preparation ;<br>
/ comprising same.<br>
The present invention consists also in processes for the preparation of compounds of general formula I.<br>
The process for the preparation of compounds of general formula I in which R'=CH2OH and R"=<br>
a.	straight or branched alkyl of 5 to 12 carbon atoms;<br>
b.	a group -O-R"', where R'" is straight or branched alkyl of 5<br>
to 9 carbon atoms, or a straight or branched alkyl substituted at the terminal carbon atom by a phenyl group;<br>
c.	a group - (CH2)n-O-alkyl, where n is an integer from 1 to 7 and the alkyl<br>
group contains 1 to 5 carbon atoms.<br>
involves 8 steps starting from a compound of general formula 1, in which R'=CH3 and R" is one of the substituents indicated above.<br>
The process involves blocking of the phenolic groups in order to allow further chemical transformations (step a) followed by selective epoxidation of the ring double bond (step b), selective opening of the epoxide ring to form an allylic alcohol (c), then several steps (d,e,f,g) which by allylic rearrangement lead to the dimethpxy derivative of the desired compound. The final step (h) involves demethoxylation under harsh conditions to form the desired allylic alcohol.<br>
The specific process for the preparation of a compound of general formula I in which R'stands for CH2OH and R" stands for C5H11 or for r,1'-dimethylheptyl (DMH) comprises:<br>
a.	reacting    CBD   or   the   dimethyl   heptyl   homologue   thereof   with<br>
methyliodide and potassium carbonate in DMF;<br>
b.	reacting the dimethylether obtained with 3-chlorobenzoic acid to obtain<br>
the corresponding epoxide;<br>
c.	the    epoxide    obtained    being    reacted    with    methyl    magnesium<br>
N-cyclohexyl - isopropylamide in toluene;<br>
d.	the compound obtained in step c being acetylated;<br>
e.	the acetylate obtained being reacted with t-butyldimethylsilybromide;<br>
f.	the bromide obtained being reacted with (nBu)4NH4Oac in acetone to<br>
obtain the allyl acetate diether; and<br>
g.	the ether obtained being heated in a sodium hydroxide solution; and<br>
h.        the compound obtained being heated with methylmagnesium iodide to<br>
obtain the required compound. The process for the preparation of compounds of general formula I in which R'=COOH and R"=<br>
a.	straight or branched alkyl of 5 to 12 carbon atoms;<br>
b.	a group -O-R"', where R'" is straight or branched alkyl   Î±5<br>
to 9 carbon atoms, or a straight or branched alkyl substituted at the terminal carbon atom by a phenyl group;<br>
c.	a group - (CH2)n-O-alkyl, where n is an integer from 1 to 7 and the alkyl<br>
group contains 1 to 5 carbon atoms.<br>
involves as starting material an intermediate compound (general formula 6) obtained in the synthesis described in Figs. 3A and 3B. It is exemplified in Figs 3A, 3B and 4, by (6a) in which R"=C5H11 or (6b) in which R"=DMH. The first steps involves<br>
demethoxylation of the phenolic groups (step a), followed by acetylation (b). The triacetate with general formula (12) can be rearranged and brominated in a single step (c) to yield a bromide (13) which by oxidation (d,e) and hydrolysis (f) leads to the desired compound.<br>
The specific process for the preparation of a compound of general formula I, in which R' stands for COOH and R" stands for C5Hn or for DMH comprises:<br>
a.	the compound obtained in step d above being reacted with methyl<br>
magnesium iodide;<br>
b.	the triol obtained being acetylated;<br>
c.	the acetylate obtained being rearranged and brominated to obtain the<br>
corresponding bromide;<br>
d.	the bromide obtained being oxidized with potassium chromate in<br>
hexamethylphosphoric triamide;<br>
e.	the aldehyde obtained being oxidized with sodium chlorite and reacted<br>
with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide to obtain the desired<br>
compound.<br>
The above specific processes are illustrated in Figs. 3A, 3B and 4. The starting material of the compounds of general formula I in which R' stands for CH3 and R" stands for<br>
a.	straight or branched alky! of 5 to 12 carbon atoms;<br>
b.	a group -O-R"\ where R'" is straight or branched alkyl of 5 to 9<br>
carbon atoms, or a straight or branched alkyl substituted at the terminal<br>
carbon atom by a phenyl group;<br>
c.	a group - (CH2)n-O-alkyl, where n is an integer from 1 to 7 and the alkyl<br>
group contains 1 to 5 carbon atoms.<br>
were prepared of the process exemplified in Fig. 5 in which mentha-2,8-diene-1-ol is condensed with a resorcinol substituted in position 5 (Leite et al.).<br>
The present invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following examples and experiments without being limited by same. The reference to Figures refer to those annexed to the Specification.<br>
I.	Examples<br>
In all the examples, 1H NMR spectra were measured on a Varian VXR-300S spectrophotometer using TMS as the internal standard. All chemical shifts are reported in ppm. Specific rotations were detected with a Perkin-Elmer 141 polarimeter. Column chromatography was performed with ICN silica gel 60A. Organic solutions were dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate.<br>
Example 1 Dimethoxy-CBD (4a)<br>
CBD 1a, (3g, 9.95 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (55 ml). K2CO3 (7.35g, 53.3 mmol) and CH3I (2.3 ml, 36.9 mmol) were added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 hours. The reaction was monitored by TLC (10% Ether/P.E.) till the starting material was disappeared. Then 200ml of water were added and the solution was extracted with Ether. The organic phase was washed with brine till neutral pH, dried on MgSO4 and filtered.  Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure afforded 3.2 g of the product (yield 98%).<br>

Butyllithium in hexane (5.6 ml, 14 mmol) was added to a 0Â°C solution of N-cyclohexylisopropylamine (1.85 ml, 11.3 mmol) in anhydrous toluene (10 ml, distilled over sodium) under N2 atmosphere. After 15 min, methylmagnesium bromide in ether (3.8 ml, 11.4 mmol) was injected, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 45 min at room temperature. A solution of (5a) (1g, 2.79 mmol) in dry toluene (3 ml) was added, and the mixture was heated to 40Â°C and stirred for two hours. Then the reaction was cooled to 0Â°C and quenched by the slow addition of 5M HCI. The organic phase was separated by a separatory funnel, and then the aqueous phase was extracted with ether. The combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried over MgSO4 and filtered.

The effect of various doses of CBD-7-oic acid (3a) (Example 28), and of CBD-DMH-7-oic acid (3b) (Example 28) and of indomethacin (20 mg/kg) after arachidonic acid-induced swelling of the ear are shown in Fig.2. The effects were measured over 75 min after the administration of arachidonic acid. The experimental<br>
details are identical to those described for the testing of CBD (1a) and derivatives<br>
thereof.<br>

B.	Cannabinoid dose 40 mg/kg; indomethacin 20 mg/kg<br>
C.	Cannabinoid dose 5 mg/kg; indomethacin 20 mg/kg<br>
II.        Pharmacological Activity Antiinflammatory activity<br>
The results presented in Figs 1,2 indicate that the CBD metabolites 2a and 3a, as well as their dimethylheptyl homologs 2b and 3b are antiinflammatory. Fig 1 shows that the results with 2a and 2b significantly differ from those with the control solution. However both compounds (at 40 mg/kg) are less active than the potent antiinflammatory drug indomethacin (at 20 mg/kg). Fig 1 also indicates that the antiinflammatory effects of 2a and 2b (at 40 mg/kg), although lower than those of indomethacin (at 20 mg/kg), parallel its action for at least about 90 min.<br>
It has previously been shown that some cannabinoids exhibit biphasic effects in various assays (Sulcova et al., Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 59,_1998). Hence we looked at the antiinflammatory effects of 3a and 3b over a wide range of doses (Fig 2). The effect of the acids at 40 mg/kg, i.p. was found to be essentially equivalent to that of indomethacin (20 mg/kg, i.p.). Both 3a and 3b at 80 mg/kg were less effective than indomethacin (20 mg/kg). However at 5 mg/kg, 3b fully suppressed the inflammation and was comparable to indomethacin (20 mg/kg). Compound 3a was less active than 3b at 5 mg/kg.<br>
In another line of experiments it was found that the above described compounds in particular cannabidiol-7-oic acid {3 a) and cannabidiol- DMH- 7-oic acid (3 b) inhibit in vitro up to 90% TNFa production by murine macrophages and by the monocytic cell line RAW 264.7. The inhibition is dose dependent (10 ug - 0.001 ug/ml). Tables of results are attached in following Tables A and B.<br>

This anti TNFa effect is also seen in vivo. High levels of TNFa appear in serum of mice after ip injection of 5 mg/kg/mouse lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Administration of cannabidiol-DMH-7-oic acid (3 b) in 2 different doses 0.5 and 5 mg/kg simultaneously with LPS, suppressed serum TNFa level. At the lower dose of 0.5 mg/kg 80% suppression of TNFa level was observed. The same effect was observed with other compounds described herewith. Thus 7-hydroxy-CBD (2a) in doses of 10 ug/kg i.p. suppressed serum TNFc in mice (30%).<br>
The above compounds in particular 7-hydroxy-cannabidiol (2a) and 7-hydroxy-cannabidiol-DMH (2b) also inhibit markedly nitric oxide (NO) generation by murine macrophages (up to 90%).<br>
Oxygen radicals intermediate (ROl) generation by macrophages, assayed by chemiluminescence, demonstrated almost total inhibition (up to 95%) when the cells were incubated with cannabidiol-7-oic acid (_ a) and cannabidiol-DMH-7-oic acid 0 /b). Table of results are attached in following Table C.<br>

The experimental methods used have been described in Gallily et al. (Eur. J. Pharmacol. 406, R5-R7, 2000), Avron and Gallily (J. Leukocyte Biol. 57, 264-268, 1995) and Gallily et al. (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 283, 918-924, 1997).<br>
The above results indicate that 7-hydroxy-CBD (2a) and 7-hydroxy-CBD-DMH (2b) show antiinflammatory activity. The acids 3a and 3b are much more promising, with 3b (at 5 mg/kg) being as potent as indomethacin (at 20 mg/kg). Said acids show also some analgesic activity.<br>
In view of the potent activity of 7-hydroxy-CBD-DMH (2b) and in particular of CBD-DMH-7-oic acid (3b) numerous additional side chain homoiogs were prepared. They were  synthesized  according  to  Figs.  3A and  3B,  the  starting  resorcinol derivatives being: 5-(1,2-dimethyl heptyl)-resorcinol 5-(1,2-dimethyloctyl) resorcinol 5-(1,2-dimethy!hexyi) resorcinol 5-(1,1-dimethyl heptyl) resorcinol 5-(1-ethyl-2-methylpropyi) resorcinol 5-methylnony! resorcinol 5-(1-methylnonyl) resorcinol 5-(1-methy!octyl) resorcinol 5-(1,2,4-trimethyihexyi) resorcinol 5-(1-ethylheptyl) resorcinol<br>
leading to CBD-type compounds derived from compound type 16. These were converted into the respective homoiogs 17 and 18, following the synthetic Figs. 3 and 4.<br>
There have also been used 5-substituted resorcinols in which the side-chain contains an ether such as OCH3, OC2H5, OC3H7(n), OC4H9(n), OCH(CH3)2, OCH(CH3)C2H5, OCH2CH(CH3) etc.<br>
A further group we used was based on 5 substituted resorcinols in which the alkyl group was substituted: O-CH(CH3)(CH2)4CH3<br>
O-CH(CH3)CH2CH2C6H5 O-CHCH3)CH2CH2CH2C6H5<br>
Antinociceptive activity<br>
It has been found that 2a, 2b, 3a and 3b attenuate the late phase of pain behavior produced by formalin-induced chemical change. Thus mice injected with formalin (3.2% dissolved in saline) licked their paws 8 + 2 times over 5 min, recorded 30 min after the formalin administration. All four compounds, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b (20 mg/kg each) fully blocked the licking.<br>
Antianxiety and anticonvulsive effects<br>
Preliminary data indicated that in addition to the antiinflammatory and analgesic effects the metabolites 2a and 3a and the homologs 2b and 3b have antianxiety and anticonvulsive effects.  Preliminary data also indicate that compounds described herein, such as 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b prevent the uptake of endocannabinoids into neuronal cells and may thus prolong their activity. This action may explain the antianxiety and anticonvulsive activity of these compounds.<br>
Anticancer effects<br>
It has been found that cannabidiol and other compounds such as cannabidiol-DMH-7-oic acid (3  b) described in this specification cause high rate of programmed cell death (apoptosis) in human HL-60 promyelecytic leukemia cells. The apoptosis was cannabinoid dose dependent (0.1 ug/ml to 8 ug/ml).  Moreover a very marked synergism reaching up to 85% of apoptosis was seen when HL-60 cells were irradiated by y ray (800 rad) and treated with cannabidiol and/or other compounds described. The method used, namely determination by the fluorescent Hoechst 33258 stain, is described by T.R.Chen (Cell Res. 104, 255-262, 1977). A Table of results is appended in following Table D.<br>

ill        Receptor Binding Assays<br>
The CB1 binding assays were performed with synaptosomal membranes prepared from rat brains (Devane et al., 1992). The CB2 assays were performed with transfected cells (Mechouiam et al., 1995). Ail assays were done in triplicate. The previously described probe [3H]HU-243 was employed in a centrifugation-based ligand binding assay (Devane et a!., 1992a, Devane et al., 1992b). It has a K1 value of45 + 7pM.<br>
Animals and Drugs<br>
Female Sabra mice (2 months old, Harlan-Sprague Dawley, Jerusalem) were used for a series of tests and for the assays for inflammation and peripheral pain. Groups of 5 mice were used in each experiment. Compounds 2a, 2b, 3a and 3b were dissolved in vehicle (ethano!:emulphor:saline=1:1:18) and injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) in volumes of 0.1 ml/10g in mice as previously described (Hanusetal., 1999).<br>
The experiments on animals were performed according to standards determined by the committee on ethics in animal research of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.<br>
Arachidonic acid-induced ear inflammation in the mouse<br>
Ear inflammation was measured by assessing ear tissue swelling after topical application of arachidonic acid. Nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs have been shown to reduce swelling in this model (Young et al., 1984). Sixty minutes after i.p. injections of the drug, namely the CBD derivatives or indomethacin, arachidonic acid was applied to the inner surface of one ear (4.5 mg in 5 \x\ ethanol). The opposite ear served as control (5 p.l ethanol). Ear thickness was determined (in 0.01 mm units) every 15 min for 90 min starting immediately after arachidonic acid application using a dial thickness gauge (Mitutoyo, Japan).<br>
Peripheral pain<br>
Pain mediated by the peripheral nervous system, was tested in the 'formalin test' for cutaneous (peripheral) pain (Tjolson et al., 1992; Calignano et al., 1998; Jaggar et al, 1998). The compound tested (or vehicle) was injected i.p. Formalin (3.2% dissolved in saline) was injected s.c. in the plantar surface of the hind paw of a mouse (in 20 Âµl volumes) 90 min after the drug. Immediately after formalin administration nociception was assessed (every 5 min for 1 hr) by the number of times the animal licks for formalin-injected paw.<br>
Statistical analyses<br>
Time curves were compared by two-way analyses-of-variance (ANOVA: time x dose). Differences from vehicle treatments were compared by one-way ANOVA;s, followed by post-hoc Newman-Keuls tests (Prism software from Graph Pad, San Diego). c<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
