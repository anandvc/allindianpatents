				<td>PROCESSOR SECURITY DIAGNOSTICS FOR HYBRID VEHICLE ELECTRIC<br>
MOTOR CONTROL SYSTEM<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/986,373, filed on November 8, 2007. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to hybrid vehicles, and more<br>
particularly to processor security diagnostics for hybrid vehicles.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The background description provided herein is for the purpose<br>
of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently<br>
named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well<br>
as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the<br>
time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
[0004] Referring now to FIG. 1, an electric hybrid vehicle 10 is shown.<br>
The electric hybrid vehicle 10 includes an engine assembly 12, a hybrid power<br>
assembly 14, a transmission 16, a drive axle 18, and a control module 20. The<br>
engine assembly 12 includes an internal combustion engine 22 that is in<br>
General Motors No. P003019-PTH-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000703<br>
communication with an intake system 24, a fuel system 26, and an ignition<br>
system 28.<br>
[0005] The intake system 24 includes an intake manifold 30, a throttle<br>
32, and an electronic throttle control (ETC) 34. The ETC 34 controls the throttle<br>
32 to control airflow into the engine 22. The fuel system 26 includes fuel<br>
injectors (not shown) to control a fuel flow into the engine 22. The ignition<br>
system 28 ignites an air/fuel mixture provided to the engine 22 by the intake<br>
system 24 and the fuel system 26.<br>
[0006] The engine 22 is coupled to the transmission 16 via a coupling<br>
device 44. The coupling device 44 may include one or more clutches and/or a<br>
torque converter. The engine 22 generates torque to drive the transmission 16<br>
and propel the electric hybrid vehicle 10. The transmission 16 transfers power<br>
from the engine 22 to an output shaft 46, which rotatably drives the drive axle 18.<br>
[0007] The hybrid power assembly 14 includes one or more motor<br>
generator units. For example only, as shown in FIG. 1, the hybrid power<br>
assembly 14 includes two motor generator units: a first motor generator unit<br>
(MGU) 38 and a second MGU 40. The hybrid power assembly 14 also includes<br>
a power control device 41 and a rechargeable battery 42.<br>
[0008] The first and second MGUs 38 and 40 operate independently<br>
and at any given time may each operate as either a motor or a generator. An<br>
MGU operating as a motor supplies power (e.g., torque), all or a portion of which<br>
may be used to drive the output shaft 46. An MGU operating as a generator<br>
converts mechanical power into electrical power.<br>
General Motors No. P003019-PTH-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000703<br>
[0009] For example only, the first MGU 38 may generate electrical<br>
power based on the output of the engine 22, and the second MGU 40 may<br>
generate electrical power based on the output shaft 46. Electrical power<br>
generated by one of the MGUs 38 and 40 may be used , for example, to power<br>
the other of the MGUs 38 and 40, to recharge the battery 42, and/or to power<br>
electrical components. While the MGUs 38 and 40 are shown as being located<br>
within the transmission 16, the MGUs 38 and 40 may be located in any suitable<br>
location.<br>
[0010] The control, module 20 is in communication with the fuel system<br>
26, the ignition system 28, the ETC 34, the MGUs 38 and 40, the power control<br>
device 41, and the battery 42. The control module 20 is also in communication<br>
with an engine speed sensor 48 that measures an engine speed. For example,<br>
the engine speed may be based on the rotation of the crankshaft. The engine<br>
speed sensor 48 may be located within the engine 22 or at any suitable location,<br>
such as near the crankshaft.<br>
[0011] The control module 20 controls operation of the engine 22 and<br>
the MGUs 38 and 40. The control module 20 also selectively controls recharging<br>
of the battery 42. The control module 20 controls recharging of the battery 42<br>
and the operation of the MGUs 38 and 40 via the power control device 41. The<br>
power control device 41 controls power flow between the battery 42 and the<br>
MGUs 38 and 40. For example only, the power control device 41 may be an<br>
inverter and/or an IGBT (insulated gate bipolar transistor).<br>
General Motors No. P003019-PTH-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000703<br>
[0012] The control module 20 may include multiple processors for<br>
controlling respective operations of the electric hybrid vehicle 10. For example,<br>
the control module 20 may include a first processor for determining desired<br>
torque for the engine 22 and the MGUs 38 and 40 and a second processor for<br>
controlling torque of each of the MGUs 38 and 40.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0048] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in<br>
no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should<br>
be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It<br>
should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different<br>
order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.<br>
[0049] As used herein, the term module refers to an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
General Motors No. P003019-PTH-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000703<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that<br>
provide the described functionality.<br>
[0050] Referring now to FIG. 2, a functional block diagram of an<br>
exemplary control module 100 of an electric hybrid vehicle according to the<br>
present disclosure is presented. The control module 100 includes a drive<br>
diagnostic module 102, a hybrid control processor (HCP) 104, and a motor<br>
control processor (MCP) 106. The drive diagnostic module 102 receives various<br>
inputs including, but not limited to, engine speed, motor speed, and motor torque.<br>
[0051] For example, the drive diagnostic module 102 receives the<br>
engine speed from the engine speed sensor 48. The drive diagnostic module<br>
102 also receives a motor speed measured by a motor speed sensor 107 and a<br>
motor torque (Tmot) measured by a motor torque sensor 108. The motor speed<br>
sensor 107 and the motor torque sensor 108 measure the speed and torque of<br>
the first MGU 38, respectively. As the electric hybrid vehicle 10 includes more<br>
than one MGU, the drive diagnostic module 102 may receive the motor speed<br>
and torque of more than one MGU. For example, the drive diagnostic module<br>
102 may also receive the motor speed and torque of the second MGU 40.<br>
[0052] The drive diagnostic module 102 generates various signals 110<br>
based on the engine speed, the motor speed, and the motor torque. The HCP<br>
104 receives the signals 110 from the drive diagnostic module 102. The HCP<br>
104 determines a requested motor torque 112 for an MGU based on the received<br>
signals 110. While the HCP 104 is shown as determining the requested motor<br>
General Motors No. P003019-PTH-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000703<br>
torque 112 for the first MGU 38, the HCP 104 may determine a requested motor<br>
torque for each of the MGUs 38 and 40.<br>
[0053] The MCP 106 receives the requested motor torque 112 from the<br>
HCP 104 and controls the torque of the first MGU 38 based on the requested<br>
motor torque 112. For example, the MCP 106 may cause power to be supplied<br>
to the first MGU 38 in an amount that allows the first MGU 38 to produce the<br>
requested motor torque 112. In other words, the MCP 106 controls the torque of<br>
the first MGU 38 based on the requested motor torque 112. As such, it is<br>
desirable to ensure that the torque commanded by the MCP 106 accurately<br>
corresponds to the requested motor torque 112.<br>
[0054] The control module 100 may include multiple layers of<br>
security/diagnostics to ensure accuracy and consistency between the HCP 104<br>
and the MCP 106. For example, one layer of diagnostics may relate to<br>
diagnostics of basic components and subsystems such as voltage and current<br>
sensors, temperature sensors, and resolver performance diagnostics. Another<br>
layer of diagnostics may relate to an independent calculation of achieved motor<br>
torque. This independent calculation of the achieved motor torque may be<br>
implemented using separate memory locations for software, calibration variables,<br>
and static variables. Values used in the calculation may be verified (e.g., using<br>
checksum verification) between different execution loops.<br>
[0055] Yet another layer of diagnostics may be implemented to prevent<br>
software execution and/or processor faults of the MCP 106. For example only,<br>
the control module 100 may include a processor such as a Programming Logic<br>
General Motors No. P003019-PTH-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000703<br>
Device (PLD) processor 120. While the PLD processor 120 is shown as being<br>
located external to the MCP 106, the PLD processor 120 may be located in any<br>
suitable location.<br>
[0056] The PLD processor 120 may be used to verify the MCP 106.<br>
Likewise, the MCP 106 may be used to verify the PLD processor 120. The PLD<br>
processor 120 and/or the MCP 106 may be verified via an information exchange.<br>
For example, the PLD processor 120 may send a seed value to the MCP 106.<br>
The MCP 106 determines a return key value based on the seed value and<br>
transmits the return key to the PLD processor 120.<br>
[0057] The PLD processor 120 determines the functionality of the MCP<br>
106 based on the return key (e.g., by comparing the return key to an expected<br>
key). If the return key does not match the expected key, the PLD processor 120<br>
may implement remedial actions. For example, the PLD processor 120 may<br>
reset the MCP 106 and/or command the first MGU 38 to enter a secure<br>
shutdown mode. Similarly, the MCP 106 determines the functionality of the PLD<br>
processor 120 based on action the PLD processor 120 in response to the return<br>
key. If the PLD processor 120 does not respond as expected, the MCP 106 may<br>
implement remedial actions.<br>
[0058] Referring now to FIG. 3, a functional block diagram of an<br>
exemplary motor control system 130 is presented. The motor control system 130<br>
includes the MCP 106 that controls torque of the first MGU 38. The motor control<br>
system 130 may include one or more additional MCPs, such as those shown in<br>
FIG. 4. The MCP 106 may include one or more submodules, such as a<br>
General Motors No. P003019-PTH-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000703<br>
processor monitoring module (PMM) 132. The PLD processor 120<br>
communicates seed and return key information to and from the MCP 106 via the<br>
PMM 132.<br>
[0059] Referring now to FIG. 4, a functional block diagram of an<br>
exemplary motor control system 140 is presented. The motor control system 140<br>
includes the MCP 106 and a second MCP 142. The MCPs 106 and 142 control<br>
torque of the MGUs 38 and 40, respectively. Like the MCP 106, the second<br>
MCP 142 includes a processor monitoring module (PMM) 144. The second MCP<br>
142 and the PMM 144 may function similarly or identically to the MCP 106 and<br>
the PMM 132. As such, while the principles of the present application will be<br>
discussed as they relate to the MCP 106 and the PMM 132, the principles of the<br>
present application are also applicable to the second MCP 142 and the PMM 144<br>
and/or any other suitable MCP and PMM.<br>
[0060] Referring again to FIG. 3, the PMM 132 monitors conditions of<br>
the PLD processor 120 and the MCP 106 and may provide warning and/or fault<br>
information when faults are detected. For example only, the PMM 132 may<br>
detect a PLD processor fault based on the seed/key exchange. In other words,<br>
the PMM 132 may log fault codes and/or trigger remedial action based on a<br>
faulty PLD processor 120. The PMM 132 may further determine proper program<br>
flow of motor torque monitoring.<br>
[0061] The PLD processor 120 may also monitor the condition of the<br>
MCP 106 and initiate fault warnings/indications and/or initiate remedial action.<br>
For example, if the PLD processor 120 determines that the key received is<br>
Genera! Motors No. P003019-PTH-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000703<br>
incorrect, the PLD processor 120 may reset the MCP 106 and/or perform a motor<br>
shutdown procedure. Conversely, if the PMM 132 determines that the seed<br>
received from the PLD processor 120 is incorrect, the PMM 132 may perform a<br>
corresponding remedial action (e.g., log a corresponding fault code).<br>
[0062] The PLD processor 120 generates the seeds based on a<br>
predetermined sequence. For example only, the predetermined sequence may<br>
be based on a Pseudo Random Binary Sequence (PRBS). The PMM 132<br>
generates the return keys based on the seeds. The PMM 132 may generate the<br>
return keys, for example, according to a lookup table and/or a nonlinear mapping.<br>
[0063] After receiving a return key, the PLD processor 120 determines<br>
whether the return key is correct. When the PLD processor 120 determines that<br>
the return key is correct, the PLD processor 120 sends another seed to the PMM<br>
132. If, however, the PLD processor 120 determines that the PMM 132 returned<br>
an incorrect key, the PLD processor 120 may be expected to resend the same<br>
seed.<br>
[0064] The PMM 132 then determines whether the PLD processor 120<br>
sent an incorrect seed. For example, one of the MCP 106 and the PMM 132<br>
may store the received seed in memory, such as a buffer (not shown). The PMM<br>
132 reads the stored seed and determines whether the seed is an incorrect seed.<br>
For example, the PLD processor 120 may be expected to send different seeds<br>
between consecutive program loops. Accordingly, a received seed may be<br>
incorrect if it is the same as the stored seed.<br>
General Motors No. P003019-PTH-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000703<br>
[0065] The PMM 132 increments a fail count value (e.g., X of an X-of-Y<br>
counter) for each incorrect seed received. In other words, the PMM 132<br>
increments the fail count value for each repeated transmission of the same seed.<br>
The PMM 132 may log a fault code and/or trigger an appropriate fault action if<br>
the fail count value reaches a limit (e.g., X &gt; limit) within a predetermined period<br>
(e.g., Y of the X-of-Y counter). Each of the limit and the predetermined period<br>
may be set based on calibrated values.<br>
[0066] The PMM 132 may also selectively intentionally send an<br>
incorrect return key to the PLD processor 120 to determine whether the PLD<br>
processor 120 is properly detecting incorrect return keys. The PLD processor<br>
120 is expected to notify the PMM 132 when an incorrect key is received. For<br>
example, the PLD processor 120 may assert a signal, such as a bad key signal,<br>
on an input of the PMM 132 in response to an incorrect key. When the PMM 132<br>
sends the correct key, the PLD processor 120 does not assert the signal.<br>
[0067] When the PMM 132 determines that the PLD processor 120 did<br>
not respond appropriately to either a correct key or an incorrect key, the PMM<br>
132 may increment a fail count value (e.g., X of an X-of-Y counter). The PMM<br>
132 may log a fault code and/or trigger an appropriate fault action if the fail count<br>
value reaches a limit (e.g., X = limit) within a predetermined period (e.g., Y of the<br>
X-of-Y counter). Each of the limit and the predetermined period may be set<br>
based on calibrated values.<br>
[0068] When the PMM 132 is not functioning properly, the PMM 132<br>
will return incorrect keys in response to received seeds. When the PMM 132<br>
General Motors No. P003019-PTH-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000703<br>
fails to return the correct key within a predetermined period, the PLD processor<br>
120 may initiate remedial action. For example only, the PLD processor 120 may<br>
initiate a power-on reset of the MCP 106. The PLD processor 120 may also<br>
initiate a motor shutdown procedure. For example only, the motor shutdown<br>
procedure may include short circuiting or open circuiting all of the phases of the<br>
MGU 38. After the reset, the MCP 106 may initiate other remedial actions,<br>
including, but not limited to, logging a fault code. The HCP 104 may initiate other<br>
actions in response to the reset of the MCP 106, including, but not limited to,<br>
indicating a communication fault and/or initiating a global vehicle level shutdown.<br>
[0069] Referring now to FIG. 5, a flowchart depicting an exemplary<br>
method 500 performed by the PLD processor 120 is presented. The method 600<br>
begins in step 502 where the method 500 generates a first seed (Seed1). The<br>
first seed is output in step 504. The first seed is output to the PMM 132, which<br>
generates the return key.<br>
[0070] The method 500 receives the return key in step 506 and<br>
determines whether the return key is correct in step 508. If the return key is<br>
correct, the method 500 continues to step 510; if the return key is incorrect, the<br>
method 500 transfers to step 514. The method 500 may determine whether the<br>
return key is correct, for example, based on a comparison with an expected<br>
return key.<br>
[0071] In step 510, the method 500 generates a second seed (Seed2).<br>
The method 500 outputs the second seed in step 512. In this manner, the<br>
General Motors No. P003019-PTH-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000703<br>
method 500 generates the second seed when the PMM 132 returns the correct<br>
return key in response to the first seed. The method 500 then ends.<br>
[0072] Referring back to step 514, the method 500 indicates that the<br>
return key is incorrect. In step 516, the method 500 determines whether a fault<br>
has occurred. If true, the method 500 continues to step 518; if false, the method<br>
500 transfers to step 520. The method 500 may determine that a fault has<br>
occurred when, for example, the PMM 132 has returned an incorrect return key<br>
for at least a predetermined period of time. In step 518, the method 500 takes<br>
remedial action. The remedial action may include, for example, initiating a<br>
power-on reset of the MCP 106 and/or logging a fault code.<br>
[0073] In step 520, the method 500 outputs the first seed. In this<br>
manner, the method 500 returns the first seed to the PMM 132 when the PMM<br>
132 provides an incorrect return key in response to the first seed. The method<br>
500 then ends. While the method 500 is shown as ending after steps 512, the<br>
method 500 may continue. For example, the method 500 may return to step 506<br>
after step 512 or step 520 is performed.<br>
[0074] Referring now to FIG. 6, a flowchart depicting an exemplary<br>
method 600 performed by the PMM 132 is presented. The method 600 begins in<br>
step 602 where the method 600 receives the first seed (Seed1). In step 604, the<br>
method 600 determines whether the first seed is correct. If the first seed is<br>
correct, the method 600 transfers to step 610; if the first seed is incorrect, the<br>
method 600 proceeds to step 606. The method 600 may determine that the first<br>
General Motors No. P003019-PTH-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000703<br>
seed is incorrect when, for example, the first seed is the same the seed received<br>
before the first seed was received in step 602.<br>
[0075] In other implementations, the method 600 may determine<br>
whether the PLD processor 120 has responded correctly in step 604. If the PLD<br>
processor 120 responded correctly, the method proceeds to step 610; if the PLD<br>
processor 120 responded incorrectly, the method 600 proceeds to step 606. The<br>
PLD processor 120 may respond incorrectly by, for example, failing to assert the<br>
bad key signal when the PMM 132 intentionally provided the PLD processor 120<br>
with an incorrect return key.<br>
[0076] The method 600 increments a fail counter in step 606 and<br>
determines whether a fault has occurred in step 608. If true, the method 600<br>
proceeds to step 612; if false, the method 600 continues to step 610. For<br>
example only, the method 600 may determine that a fault has occurred when the<br>
fail counter reaches a predetermined value within a predetermined period of time.<br>
In step 612, the method 600 takes remedial action. The method 600 may take<br>
remedial action by, for example, initiating a power-on reset of the MCP 106<br>
and/or logging a fault code. The method 600 generates the return key in step<br>
610 and outputs the return key to the PLD processor 120 in step 614. The<br>
method 600 ends after step 612 or 614 is performed. While the method 600 is<br>
shown as ending after step 612 or 614, the method 600 may continue. For<br>
example, the method 600 may return to step 602 after step 614 is performed.<br>
