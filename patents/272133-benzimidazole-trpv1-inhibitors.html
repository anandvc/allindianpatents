Therapeutic Use<br>
Noxious chemical, thermal and mechanical stimuli excite peripheral nerve endings of small diameter sensory neurons (nociceptors), deriving from sensory ganglia (e. g., dorsal root, nodose and trigeminal ganglia), which initiate signals that arc perceived as pain. Nociceptors are crucial for the detection of harmful or potentially harmful stimuli (e.g., noxious thermal, chemical, and/or mechanical) arising from changes in the extracellular environment during inflammatory, ischemic or otherwise traumatic conditions and that cause or have the potential to cause tissue damage (Wall, P. D., and Melzack, R., Textbook of Pain, 2005, New York: Churchill Livingstone).<br>
Nociceptors transduce noxious stimuli into membrane depolarization that leads to an action potential, its subsequent conduction to the CNS, and ultimately to the perception of pain, discomfort, etc. as well as to certain responses thereto. At the molecular level, nociception is carried out by ion channels and/or receptors. Plant-derived vanilloid compounds (e.g., capsaicin and rcsiniferatoxin) arc known to selectively depolarize nociceptors and elicit sensations of burning pain — the sensation that is typically evoked by capsaicin-containing hot chili peppers. Therefore, capsaicin mimics the action of physiological/endogenous stimuli that activate the "nociceptive pathway". Advances in pain biology have identified a vanilloid receptor, called TRPV1 (a.k.a. capsaicin receptor). Because nociceptors are drivers of unwanted pain and inflammatory conditions in human beings and animals, modulation of their function is a validated strategy for palliative and other analgesic therapies.<br>

Commercially available bromo-diaminobenzene Compound 1-1 is protected, in this instance with a Boc group, to provide a Compound 1-2. Compound 1-2 is then coupled with a suitably substituted phenyl group by a variety of coupling reactions (Suzuki, Stille) that are well known to those versed in the art. A particularly useful method is by a palladium catalyzed cross-coupling Suzuki reaction (see Huff, B. et. al. Org. Syn., 1997, 75: 53-60; and, Goodson, F. E. et. al. Org. Synth., 1997, 75: 61-68).<br><br>
In this instance, a mixture of Compound 1-2 and a boronic acid or boronatc ester Compound 1-3 in sodium carbonate and a catalytic amount of a palladium catalyst in a mixture of dioxane or dimethoxyethane and water or ethanol is heated to 100 °C or more to give an intermediate Compound 1-4.<br>
Suitable palladium catalysts for this reaction include, but are not limited to, a dichloro[l,l'-bis-(diphenylphosphino)fcrroccne] palladium(11) dichloromcthancadduct [PdCl2dppf] and palladium tetrakistriphenylphosphine [Pd(PPh3)4].<br><br>
The Compound 1-4 Boc protecting groups are removed under acidic conditions to give a Compound 1-5, which is stirred in a solvent such as ethanol with a halogenated acetimidic acid ethyl ester hydrochloride salt (wherein X represents 2-chloro- or 2-bromo-), prepared according to the procedure described in J. Med. Chem., 1986, 29, 2280) to give a Compound 1-6.<br><br>

Compound 1-6 is then reacted with H-L-Ar(R4)r to provide a Compound 1-7 of Formula (I).<br>
For example, to prepare compounds of the present invention wherein L is -Ci_3alkyl-Y- and Y is O, Compound 1-6 is reacted with a solution of an alcohol substituted Ai ring (in a solvent such as acetone) in the presence of a base (such as cesium carbonate) with heating to provide an ether analogue compound of Formula (I).<br>

SCHEME II<br>
Scheme II provides an alternate procedure to produce compounds of the present invention.<br><br>
Compound 1-1 is reacted with a halogenated acetimidic acid ethyl ester hydrochloride salt (wherein X represents 2-chloro- or 2-bromo-), under conditions described in Scheme I to provide Compound ll-l.<br><br>
As described in Scheme I, Compound II-l is reacted with H-L-Ai-(R4)r (wherein H is a leaving group) to provide a Compound 11-2, which may be carried forward using Suzuki type coupling with a Compound 1-3 to provide Compound 1-7 of Formula (I).<br>
SCHEME III<br>
Scheme III provides an alternate procedure to produce ether-linked compounds of the present invention.<br><br>
Reaction of an alcohol Compound II1-1 with bromoacetonitrile in a solvent such as DMF with sodium carbonate and an equivalent of sodium iodide gives a Compound III-2. Reaction of Compound III-2 with 2N HC1 and 1.1 equivalents of ethanol gives a Compound III-3.<br><br>
Reaction of Compound III-3 with Compound 1-1 in ethanol gives a Compound III-4.<br><br><br>
Reaction of Compound III-4 with a boronic acid or boronate ester Compound 1-3 in sodium carbonate and a catalytic amount of a palladium catalyst in a solvent at a temperature of at least about 100 °C gives a Compound III-5 of Formula (I).<br><br>
Compound III-5 can be reacted witli R3X to provide a Compound lll-6a and Compound III-6b as a tautomeric mixture. Each substantially pure isomer may subsequently be obtained using separation techniques known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Suitable palladium catalysts for this reaction include, but are not limited to, a dichloro[l ,1 '-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]palladium (IT) dichloromethane adduct (PdCl2dppf), palladium tctrakistriphcnylphosphine [Pd(PPh3)4] and l,l'-[bis(di-tert-butylphosphino)ferrocene]-palladium dichloride [l,r-di(tbpf)-palladium dichloride]. Suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, a mixture of dioxane or dimethoxyethane and water or ethanol.<br>
Protecting groups may be needed at certain stages of the synthesis depending upon substituents and functional groups present on the reactants. Reaction time may be reduced by using a similar or lower temperature in a microwave synthesizer. Microwave accelerated reactions were performed using a Biotage Initiator Microwave Synthesizer.<br><br>
The product of each process step may be separated from the reaction mixture and purified before use as a starting material in a subsequent step. Separation techniques typically include evaporation, extraction, precipitation and filtration. Purification techniques typically include column chromatography (Still, W. C. et. al., J. Org. Chcm., 1978, 43, 2921), thin-layer chromatography, crystallization and distillation.<br>
The starting materials and product of each process step may be confirmed by spectroscopic, spectrometric and analytical methods including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
For preparing compounds of the present invention, common solvents known to those skilled in the art were used such as, but not necessarily limited to: ethyl ether (Et20), tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane, benzene, toluene, hexanes, cyclohexanc, dichloromethane (DCM) and dichloroethane (DCE). Compounds of the present invention may be isolated as the acid addition salt and may contain one or more equivalents of the acid. The free base may be obtained by techniques known to those skilled in the art.<br>

A 5-L 3-neck round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser with gas outlet adapter, a Claisen head with a thermocouple and nitrogen inlet adapter, and heating mantle was charged with 4-trifluoromethyl-phenoI (225.25 g, 1.39 mol), DMF (1.91 L), followed by Nal (208.3 g, 1.39 mol), Na2C03 (294.5 g, 2.78 mol), and bromoacetonitrile (214.2 g, 1.76 mol). A modest exotherm to 37 °C was noted. The reaction was warmed to 65 °C for 2 h and the brown suspension was assayed by several methods and judged not to be complete. The reaction was heated to 80 °C for 1 h, when the phenol was found to be absent by HPLC. The reaction was allowed to come to room temperature overnight (14 h). The reaction was diluted with water (2 L), transferred to a 22-L separatory funnel with additional water (6 L) and extracted with a mixture of methyl-t-butylether(MTBE)/ether (2 x 3 L, 2:1, then 2 L, 1:1). The combined organic layers were washed with aqueous HC1 (10 %, 2 x 700 ml), aqueous KOH (3 M, 300 mL), water (2 x 700 mL), and brine (2 x 700 mL). The organics were dried (Na2S04) and filtered though silica gel (500 g), and the silica gel was washed with MTBE/ether (~ 1 L). The organics were concentrated in vacuo and the resulting orange oil transferred to a smaller flask with dichloromethane and MTBE.

A 5-L 3-neck round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, 1-L pressure-equalizing addition funnel and gas outlet adapter, Claisen head with a thermocouple and nitrogen inlet adapter, in an ice bath, was charged with HC1 in ether (2 M, 815 mL) via addition funnel. The addition funnel was replaced with a clean 500-mL addition funnel, and the solution was stirred until the internal temperature was approximately 0 °C. To the addition funnel was added (4-trifluoromethyl-phenoxy)-acetonitrile (neat, 273.0 g, 1.36 mol) followed by ethanol (86.9 mL, 1.49 mol). The solution of (4-trifluoromethyl-phenoxy)-acetonitrile was added drop-wise over 20 min, so not to exceed 2.6 °C. The stirring was continued for 20 min in the ice bath after the addition was complete. The ice bath was removed and the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 6 h. At 15 °C, the orange solution became hazy, followed by sudden precipitation of a thick solid. Once room temperature was achieved, ether (800 mL) was added, a spatula was used to free the solid from the sides of the flask, and the solid was filtered with a Buchner funnel. The yellowish solid became white after washing with ether (500 mL), and the solid was air-dried for 12 h at rt.

A 12-L 4-neck round bottom flask equipped with a thermocouple, heating mantle, mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser with argon outlet to a bubbler, and an argon inlet adapter was purged with argon for 1 h. Solid Na2C03 (336.8 g, 3.18 mol) and water (975 mL) were added and the contents stirred until completely dissolved. There was no attempt to control the rise in temperature to 38 °C. To the solution were added 2-(tert-butylamino) sulfonylphenylboronic acid (163.4 g, 0.637 mol), 5-bromo-2-(4-trifluoromethyl-phenoxyrnethyl)-1H-benzoirnidazole (196.6 g, 0.53 mol) and DME (2 L). The argon inlet was removed and the heterogeneous mixture was sparged as vigorously as possible with two pipette-tip argon lines for 1 h. 1 ,l'-Di(tbpO-palladium dichloride (34.5 g, 0.053 mol) was added, the argon inlet replaced, and the reaction was warmed to 61 °C, where it was held for 30 min. Two additional liters of sparged DME was added, and the heating resumed to 78 °C and maintained for 12 h. The heating was turned off (automatically) and the reaction was allowed to cool to room temperature overnight.<br>
The reaction was diluted with water (1.5 L), transferred to a 22-L separatory funnel, and the layers were separated. The top layer (01) was diluted with EtOAc (1 L), and additional separation of an aqueous bottom layer (Al) that resulted was drained with the<br><br>
initial bottom layer (thick with salts). The EtOAc diluted top layer (01) was put aside. The aqueous fraction (Al) was diluted with water (1 L, to dissolve all the salts), returned to the separatory runnel, and extracted with EtOAc (1.5 L). The resulting aqueous layer (A2) was removed and saved for later. The remaining organic layer (02) was combined with the first EtOAc diluted top layer (01) and the combined fraction was washed with water (1.5 L). The resulting aqueous layer (A3) was drained into A2. The remaining organic layer (03) was washed with water (1 L), and the resulting aqueous layer (A4) was drained into A2.

The Bl product fraction sample (previously transferred to a 3-L round bottom flask) was dissolved in boiling toluene (~210 mL) and pre-warmed heptane (180 mL) was added until just cloudy. A stir bar was added, the mixture was stirred at room temperature; and within 4-5 min, a thick solid precipitated that was not stirrable. Immediately, a portion of toluene (250 mL) was added using it to transfer the suspension to a 12-L 4-neck round bottom flask equipped with a thermocouple, heating mantle, mechanical stirrer, and reflux condenser. Additional toluene (1100 mL) was added with warming to near reflux (100 °C), enough to completely dissolve the solid. Pre-warmed heptane (1700 mL) was added, followed by the careful addition of more heptane (room temperature, 1200 mL) until the solution was permanently cloudy. The heating mantle was removed, and notice was taken of the oily black film on the bottom of the flask, and the solution was quickly decanted to a clean 12-L 4-neck round bottom flask. However, more globs formed as product oiled out again. The heating mantle was reapplied, toluene (300 mL) was added, the solution was heated to near 100 °C, and most of the oil dissolved (a spatula was used to mechanically remove the oil from the sides of the flask). The mantle was removed and the hazy solution was allowed to cool to room temperature overnight (heavy precipitation was noted around 60 °C). The next day, the solid was filtered from the orange filtrate, and the solid was washed with heptane (2 x 100 mL) that was kept separate from the main filtrate. The product was collected in an amber jar and dried in a hi-vac oven at 55 °C, to afford 90.2 g (35.7% isolated yield; 97.9%, HPLC area%) of the title compound as an off-white solid.<br>
The B2 product fraction sample (previously transferred to a 3-L round bottom flask) was dissolved in boiling toluene (750 mL) but was not totally clear. Pre-warmed heptane (660 mL) was added, and the mixture was transferred to a 12-L 4-neck round bottom flask equipped with a thermocouple, heating mantle, mechanical stirrer, and reflux condenser. Instant crystallization occurred when stirred; heating was reapplied, and toluene (1.95 L) was added until the solution was clear at near boiling. Warming was continued and pre-warmed heptane (2 L) was added, followed by the careful addition of more heptane (room temperature, 7.7 L) until the additions caused the persistence of a<br><br>

A 5-L 4-neck round bottom flask equipped with a thermocouple, heating mantle, mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser with gas outlet, and a nitrogen inlet adapter was charged with N-tert-butyl-2-[2-(4-trifluoromcthyl-phenoxymethyl)-1H-benzoimidazol-5-yl]-benzenesulfonamide (150.0 g, 0.298 mol) and HC1 in isopropyl alcohol (TPA) (5-6 M, 2.51 L). The reaction was warmed step-wise with stirring, first to 45 °C, then 60 °C, and finally 72 °C. Heating was continued for 12 h, after which time the heat was turned off, and the reaction allowed to cool to room temperature. HPLC analysis showed there to be about 1.8% of N-tert-butyl-2-[2-(4-trifluoromethyl-phenoxymethyl)-lH-benzoimidazol-5-yl]-benzenesulfonamide remaining. The reaction was chilled in an ice bath to 4 °C, the solid was filtered and washed with TPA (350 mL). The grayish solid (159.2 g) was air-dried for a short while. During this drying, a 22-L 4-ncck round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer was assembled and charged with aqueous sodium bicarbonate (saturated, 3 L) and EtOAc (12 L). The grayish solid was added to the stirred biphasic mixture and within 5 minutes, was completely dissolved. The mixture was transferred to a 22-L separatory funnel and the layers were separated. The aqueous layer (pH 8.5) was discarded. The organic layer was washed with aqueous sodium bicarbonate (saturated, 1 L), brine (half-saturated, 1 L), dried (Na2SC&gt;4) between 4 x 4 L Erlenmeyer flasks, and filtered over fresh Na2S04. The dried EtOAc layer-containing product was<br><br>
placed in a 22-L rotary evaporator flask with Si-thiol functionalized silica gel (Silicycle, 150 g) and swirled in a 45 °C for 1 h. The silica gel was removed by Filtration (sintered glass funnel), washed with ad lib EtOAc, and evaporated on a large rotary evaporator. Towards the end of the evaporation, MeCN (1 L) was added to the suspension to assist the azeotropic distillation of residual EtOAc. Evaporation was complete when no liquid distilled at a vacuum of 65 torr. The flask containing the whitish brown solid (125.3 g) was placed in a 22-L heating mantle and carefully heated with MeCN (2200 mL) with the aid of a large paddle stirrer. The completely clear, boiling yellow solution was quickly filtered though a coarse-sintered glass funnel into a 4 L heavy-walled side arm flask. A stir bar was added, the solution was stirred while crystallization ensued and the suspension came to room temperature (approx 2.5 h). The suspension was chilled for 30 min, filtered and washed with MeCN (up to 300 mL).

(+/- 0.1 g) and sodium methoxide in methanol (0.5 M, 1145.0 g) was weighed out, and<br>
then poured to the 3-L round bottom, washing with fresh methanol (150 mL). The flask<br>
was attached to a rotary evaporator (no vacuum) and swirled at a bath temperature of 30 °C<br>
until the solid had dissolved. The vaccum was carefully applied and the solvent removed<br>
in vacuo, with a bath temperature no higher than 38 °C. High vacuum (-20 torr) was<br>
applied, and drying was continued at 38 °C for 1 h. The flask was transferred to hi-vac<br><br>
(-20 torr) drying oven, and drying continued at 37 °C for 4 h. The flask was removed, the material was mechanically freed from the sides of the flask, the free-flowing material was poured out of the flask into a large crystallizing dish, and the small lump of MeOH-wet material that remained at the bottom was transferred to a small crystallizing dish. Drying was continued in the hi-vac oven at 43 °C for about 14 h (overnight). Analysis showed both samples in the crystallizing dishes to have the same amount of MeOH (6.3 % wt/wt = 1 equiv MeOH); therefore both were combined in one bottle, which afforded 181.8 g (97% isolated yield; 98.1-99.6%, HPLC area%) of the disdium salt as a slightly off-white solid.

BIOLOGICAL, EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Human TRPV1 (hTRPVl) binding assay<br>
Compounds of the present invention were tested for their ability to inhibit the binding of [3H] RTX to hTRPV 1 receptors in a [3H] RTX binding assay as previously described (See, PCT International Application WO02/33411A1 and Elfrida G.R. et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 2002, 300(1): 9-17.)<br>
HEK293 cells were transfected with hTRPVl vanilloid receptors and washed with Hank's balanced Salt Solution, dissociated with cell dissociation buffer (Sigma), and then centrifuged at 1000 x g for 5 min. Cell pellets were homogenized in cold 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH = 7.4), containing 5.8 mM NaCl, 320 mM sucrose, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.75 CaCl2 and 5 mM KC1 and centrifuged at 1000 x g for 15 min. The resultant supernatant was then centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 15 min. The pelleted membranes were stored in a freezer at -80°C.<br>
Approximately 120 ug protein/ mL from membranes were incubated with indicated concentrations of [3H]RTX in 0.5 mL of the HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.25 mg/mL fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction mixture was then cooled to 4°C, and 0.1 mg of ai-acid glycoprotein was added to each sample, which was then incubated at 4°C for 15 min. The samples were centrifuged at 18,500 x g for 15 min. The tip of the microcentrifuge tube containing the pellet was cut off. Bound radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. Non-specific binding was measured in the presence of 200 nM unlabeled RTX.<br>
Alternatively, a binding assay using rat tissue was used. Rat spinal cord was homogenized twice with a Polytron and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min in 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH = 7.4), containing 5.8 mM NaCl 5.8, 320 mM sucrose, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.75 mM CaCl2 0.75 and 5 mM KC1. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 15 min. The pellet was saved in a tube, and 10 mL of assay buffer were added into the tube. The pellet and buffer were mixed with a Polytron. The assay contained 120 ug/mL membrane protein and 0.3-0.6 nM [3H]-RTX (Perkin-Elmer, Boston) in a total volume of<br><br>
0.5 mL HEPES buffer. Following incubation for 60 min at 37 °C, the samples were cooled on ice, and 0.1 mg of ai-acid glycoprotein were added into the samples. After centrifugation at 18,500 x g for 15 min, the supernatant was aspirated and the tips of tubes were cut off and placed into 6 mL vials.<br>
Data were calculated according to the equation: % inhibition = 100% x [(total binding-binding)/(total binding-non specific binding)]. Kj values were calculated using a Prism program.<br>
Compound 1 was tested and found to provide a Kj value of 2.7 nM.<br>
Example 2<br>
Human TRPV1 (hTRPV 1) functional assay<br>
The functional activity of the test compounds was determined by measuring changes in intracellular calcium concentration using a Ca++-sensitive fluorescent dye and FLIPR™ technology. Increases in Ca++ concentration were readily detected upon challenge with capsaicin.<br>
HEK293 cells expressing hTRPV 1 were grown on poly-D-lysine coated 384 well black-walled plates (BD 354663) and 1 day later loaded with Calcium 3 Dye for 35 min at 37°C, 5% CO2 and then for 25 min at room temperature, and subsequently tested for<br>
agonist-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels using FLIPR™ technology. Cells were challenged with test compounds (at varying concentrations) and intracellular Ca2+ was measured for 5 min prior to the addition of capsaicin to all wells to achieve a final concentration of 0.030 uM eliciting ~80% maximal response.<br>
EC50 or IC50 values were determined from concentration-response studies, which were generated using the average of quadruplicate wells for each data point. For those compounds tested, IC50 and percent inhibition values are shown in Table 1. The symbol "a" represents percent inhibition obtained at a test concentration of 0.5 urn; the symbol "b" represents percent inhibition obtained at a test concentration of 0.2 urn; the symbol "c" represents an IC50 value (nM) derived from a variety of test concentrations. The term "NA" means that the result is not applicable for a particular compound.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Chemically-Induced Models Of Inflammatory Pain<br>
Compounds of the present invention were tested in animal models of inflammation and inflammatory pain. To assess the ability of test compounds to reverse thermal hyperalgesia, baseline response latencies on a radiant heat (RH) paw stimulator were obtained before an intraplantar injection of 100 uL (1 ug/uL) CFA (1:1 CFA:saline) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Only withdrawal responses that were quick hind paw movements (with or without licking of the hind paw) were recorded. Paw movements associated with locomotion or a shifting of weight were not considered a withdrawal response. The stimulus intensity that produced 10-15 sec baseline withdrawal latencies was used and a maximum cutoff of 20 sec was imposed. Hypersensitivity was evaluated 24 h after CFA. Only rats that exhibited at least a 25 % reduction in response latency from baseline (i.e. hyperalgesia) were included in further analysis.<br><br>
Following the post-inflammogen latency assessment, rats were orally dosed (2.5 mL/kg) with test compound (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (20 % hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextran). To determine the time of peak effect, latencies were redetermined 30, 60, 100, 180 and 300 min after compound administration.<br>
