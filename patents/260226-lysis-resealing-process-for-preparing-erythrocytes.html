Lysis/resealing process and device for incorporating an active ingredient, in particular asparaginase or inositol hexaphosphate, in erythrocytes<br>
The present invention relates to a process which allows the so-called lysis/resealing technique to be carried out, which allows active ingredients to be incorporated in erythrocytes. The invention also relates to a device which can carry out that process.<br>
The invention further relates to erythrocyte compositions which contain asparaginase or the like, or inositoi hexaphosphate, and which can be obtained by carrying out the process according to the invention.<br>
The lysis/resealing technique is described in patents EP-A-101 341 and EP-A-679 101. The latter describes a relatively complex installation which comprises, firstly, a refrigerated housing for the lysis portion, in which there is placed an assembly comprising single-use elements, including a dialysis cartridge, tubes, chicane type or serpentine pouches and removable metal elements, such as a serpentine cooling arrangement, and, secondly, a housing for the resealing, which housing is provided with reheating means and in which a single-use assembly of plastics material is placed.<br>
The red corpuscles, which have been separated from the plasma beforehand and which are subjected to weak ion forces (in a hypotonic medium), swell until they reach a critical volume, at which the membrane is distended to the point of becoming permeable to ions and macromolecules. Examination under a microscope of the erythrocyte membranes then reveals the appearance of pores which measure from 20 to 500 nm, as a result of which haemoglobin may escape (P. Seeman J. Cell. Biol. 1967, 32(1): 55-70). Restoration of the isotonicity of the suspension medium brings about closure of the pores, making the membrane impermeable to macromolecules. Only permeability to ions is maintained.<br>
The hypotonic shock is brought about by causing the red corpuscles to circulate in the « blood » compartment of a clialyser, preferably having hollow fibres, and causing<br><br>
WO 2006/016247	PCT/IB2005/002323<br>
2<br>
a hypotonic solution to circulate in counter-current in the « dialysate » compartment. The advantage of this technique resides in the confinement of the red corpuscles during the hypotonic shock, which allows losses of constituents which are essential to the life of those cells to be considerably reduced. Thus, the half-life of the red corpuscles is not significantly modified in vivo.<br>
The advantage of using red corpuscles as vehicles for medicaments, in comparison with other techniques, such as encapsulation in liposomes or microspheres, resides substantially in that those corpuscles have «natural» biocompatibility, are completely biodegradable according to a well-known process, have a relatively long in vivo life expectancy (approximately 120 days) and in that various chemical and therapeutic molecules can be encapsulated therein.<br>
The process of internalisation by lysis and resealing of the erythrocytes is a complex multi-factor phenomenon. Some significant physical/chemical parameters which have a bearing on the variability of the results are the concentration in terms of haemoglobin before dialysis, the flow rate of the erythrocyte suspension in the dialyser, the osmolarity of the buffer of hypotonic dialysis, the dialysis temperature and resealing temperature and the trans-membranous pressure in the dialyser. The osmotic fragility of the erythrocytes varies from one blood sample to the next and could be a leading biological factor. Thus, L. Boucher et al., Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1996, 24, 73-78, studied the influence of the variations in the osmotic fragility of various populations of red corpuscles on the distribution and final concentration of inositol hexaphosphate. In conclusion, the authors indicate that the initial osmotic fragility of the red corpuscles has a predominant role in terms of the degree of lysis and the variations in internalisation of the active ingredient, and that that osmotic fragility depends on a number of factors, such as the permeability of the red corpuscles, the relationship between surface-area/volume and ion content, the physiological state and age of the donor (see also A.A. Hussain et al., Br. J. Haematol. 1984, 57(4): 716-718), the length of time the blood is stored, the presence of medicaments, illnesses (see also K. Kolanjiappan et al., Clin. Chim. Acta 2002, 320(1-2): 143-149) and treatments. The results obtained, with the flow rate of the erythrocyte suspension being caused to vary, demonstrated the extreme sensitivity of the operating conditions, with a flow rate of from 12 to 14 ml/min<br><br>
WO 2006/(116247	PCT/IB2005/002323<br>
3<br>
depending on whether the red corpuscles belong to a group having a low level of fragility or a group having a high level of fragility.<br>
Therefore, those texts provide initial information on the various factors which influence the osmotic fragility of the red corpuscles and the effectiveness of incorporation by means of the lysis/resealing technique. They allow an understanding of the difficulties encountered in practice, which explain that that technique cannot be applied routinely in human health care.<br>
A quite recent publication summarises the current situation very well. C. G. Millan et al. published, in Journal of Controlled Release 2004, 95 : 27-49, a general review of the use of erythrocytes as pharmaceutical vehicles, in which they conclude that, in spite of the interest which they are exciting in human medicine, their development is still very limited today because of the difficulties of storage, risks of contamination and absence of a proven industrial procedure allowing the preparation thereof.<br>
Asparaginase is an enzyme produced from bacterial microorganisms (E. Coli or Erwinia) which hydrolyses and depletes asparagine, an amino acid which is indispensable for synthesising the proteins necessary for cell life, in particular fibroblasts. Some cancerous lymphoblastic cells do not have, unlike normal cells, the capacity to synthesise their asparagine themselves and are dependent on extracellular sources. Treatment by asparaginase therefore deprives them of that constituent, leading to their death. This antimitotic is selective with respect to tumour cells.<br>
In humans, however, native asparaginase induces the production of antibodies which are present in more than 70 % of patients on average, leading to an increase in the clearance of asparaginase and allergic reactions which are sometimes very severe (B. Wang et al., Leukaemia 2003 17,8 : 1583-1588). Thus, although asparaginase is very effective in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemias, it is highly toxic and may lead to hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from a simple reaction of the urticary type to a full-blown anaphylactic shock. Furthermore, there are observed detrimental effects of the neurological type (disturbances to consciousness), haemostatic type (hypofibrinogenaemia, reduction in the serum level of antitlirombin<br><br>
WO 2006/016247	PCT/IB2005/002323<br>
4<br>
IIIand other coagulation factors, leading to haemorrhagic and/or thrombotic complications), gastro-intestinal type and pancreatic type (including acute inflammations of the pancreas).<br>
The encapsulation of asparaginase in erythrocytes allows the therapeutic index to be improved (D. Schrijvers et al., Clin. Pharmacokinet. 2003, 42 (9): 779-791). Therefore, it would be extremely advantageous to provide a process which allows asparaginase to be encapsulated in erythrocytes in a reproducible and industrial manner.<br>
Furthermore, inositol hexaphosphate has been proposed as a substitute for 2,3-DPG (2,3-diphosphoglycerate) in erythrocytes in order to significantly reduce the affinity of oxygen for haemoglobin and to increase the release of oxygen in tissues (EP-A-0 101 341). Patents US 4,321,259, US 5,612,207 and US 6,610,702 describe the incorporation of that substitute in erythrocytes and the use thereof in various therapeutic applications. They include an indication as an additive for a cancer treatment by means of radiotherapy, in order to improve the oxygenation of hypoxic tumours and their sensitivity to radiotherapy. However, that indication is not accompanied by any feasibility element.<br>
For encapsulation, US 4,321,259 uses the fusion between erythrocytes and liposomes which contain inositol hexaphosphate. US 5,612,207 uses a technique by electroporation. US 6 610 702 sets out an improvement in the electroporation technique, by inositol hexaphosphate being associated with ammonium cations in order to form a biocompatible hydrosoluble complex which can promote introduction in erythrocytes. Finally, in Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1996, 24, 73-78, described above, L. Boucher et al. study the introduction of inositol hexaphosphate in erythrocytes by the lysis/resealing technique. Therefore, various routes are available to the person skilled in the art in order to introduce that compound into erythrocytes. As C. G. Millan et al. (above), mentions, when making reference to inositol hexaphosphate for the transport of oxygen in general, however, the use of erythrocytes incorporating a molecule such as inositol hexaphosphate nowadays encounters the absence of a proven industrial procedure.<br><br>
WO 2006/016247	PCT/IB2005/002323<br>
5<br>
in this application, therefore, it would be very advantageous to have a process which allows inositol hexaphosphate to be encapsulated in erythrocytes in a reproducible and industrial manner.<br>
Taking the above into consideration, the problem addressed by the applicant is to provide a process for industrial lysis/resealing which allows erythrocytes to be produced incorporating desired quantities of active ingredient in a reproducible manner, and allowing a product to be obtained which complies with the standards for blood transfusion (sterility, absence of pathogens and pyrogens).<br>
An important object of the invention is to provide such a process which can be applied to globular concentrates which comply with the standards required for blood transfusion.<br>
Another object is to provide such a process which allows asparaginase or inositol hexaphosphate to be encapsulated in erythrocytes in an effective, reproducible, reliable and stable manner.<br>
These objects, as well as others, are achieved by a lysis/resealing process for preparing erythrocytes containing at least one active ingredient, the process comprising the following steps:<br>
1	- placing a globular concentrate in suspension in an isotonic solution having a<br>
haematocrit level which is equal to or greater than 65 %, with refrigeration at from + 1<br>
to + 8 °C,<br>
2	- measuring the osmotic fragility based on a sample of erythrocytes from that same<br>
globular concentrate,<br>
the steps 1 and 2 being able to be carried out in any order (including in parallel),<br>
3	- lysis and internalisation procedure of the active ingredient, inside the same<br>
chamber, at a temperature which is constantly maintained at from + 1 to + 8 °C,<br>
comprising allowing the erythrocyte suspension haing a haematocrit level which is<br>
equal to or greater than 65 % and a hypotonic lysis solution which is refrigerated at<br>
from + 1 to + 8 °C, to circulate in a dialysis cartridge; the lysis parameters being<br>
adjusted in accordance with the osmotic fragility measured previously; and<br><br>
WO 2006/016247	PCT/IB2005/002323<br>
6<br>
4 - resealing procedure carried out in a second chamber, inside which the temperature is adapted to the resealing, preferably from + 30 to + 40 °C, and in the presence of a hypertonic solution.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, step 2 is carried out on a sample of the suspension prepared in step 1. As it will be explained thereafter, the suspension may have been prepared from a globular concentrate that has been subjected to usual processing operations such as washing with a saline solution. Moreover, the active ingredient to be internalized may be present in this suspension. Therefore, it is advantageous to carry out step 2 on a sample of this suspension and in the case the active ingredient is in the initial suspension, step 2 is carried out on a sample of suspension containing the active ingredient.<br>
The term « internalisation » is intended to refer to the introduction of the active ingredient inside the erythrocytes.<br>
According to a feature of the invention, the globular concentrate is.suspended in an isotonic solution having a high haematocrit level which is equal to or greater than 65 %, and preferably equal to or greater than 70 %, and that suspension is refrigerated at from + 1 to + 8 °C, preferably from + 2 to + 6 °C, typically in the order of + 4 °C. According to a particular method, the haematocrit level is from 65 to 80 %, preferably from 70 to 80 %.<br>
In accordance with an important feature of the invention, the osmotic fragility is measured relative to the erythrocytes shortly before the lysis step. The erythrocytes or the suspension containing them are advantageously at a temperature near to or identical to the temperature selected for lysis. According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the measurement of the osmotic fragility carried out is rapidly used, that is to say that the lysis procedure is carried out a short time after the sample is taken. Preferably, that time interval between the sample being taken and the start of lysis is less than or equal to 30 minutes, still more preferably less than or equal to 25 minutes, or even to 20 minutes.<br><br>
WO 2006/01 f)247	PCT/IB2005/002323<br>

The two parameters which allow the dialysis to be controlled are the time for which the cells are present in the dialyser (in accordance with the characteristics thereof) and the osmolarity of the dialysate. The two parameters must be adjusted in accordance with the characteristics of osmotic strength, or conversely osmotic fragility, of the red corpuscles which are processed in order to be subjected to the lysis/resealing steps. That osmotic strength can be characterised by at least one of the following parameters :<br>
a.	the osmolarity of the medium for which haemolysis appears, that is to say, the<br>
start of the formation of the pores.<br>
b.	The velocity V of haemolysis, which is established by the gradient of the linear<br>
portion of the haemolysis % = f (osmolarity of the medium) curve.<br>
c.	The percentage of haemolysis for a given osmolarity.<br>
d.	The osmolarity which allows 50% haemolysis (H50) to be obtained.<br>
e.	The time for obtaining a given percentage of haemolysis (for example, 50 %).<br>
According to preferred embodiments, the osmotic strength is characterised by means of the parameters b, d or b and d.<br>
Therefore, the osmotic fragility must be measured within a short period of time, which is compatible with the short time interval between the sample being taken and the start of lysis. In accordance with a feature of the invention, one or more of those haemolysis parameters is measured, against a hypotonic solution, having known isotonicity, for example, water (distilled water or the like), through a semi-permeable membrane. A manual method may be envisaged. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, however, the osmotic fragility is measured by means of an automatic measuring device which is configured to measure the osmotic fragility of a sample of erythrocytes in less than 15 minutes, more particularly in less than 12 minutes and preferably in less than 10 minutes, and the result obtained is used within a brief period of time in order to adjust the lysis parameters and to start the lysis.<br>
The measurement of the osmotic fragility may be carried out by means of a device which at least partially automates the manual technique described by J.V. Dacie in Practical Haematology, 2nd edn, Churchill, London 1956. An example of such a device is described in the article by J. Didelon et al., Clinical Hemorheology and<br><br>
WO 2006/016247	PCT/IB2005/002323<br>
8<br>
Microcirculation 23 (2000) 31-42. The principle is based on the use of a device which brings together, at one side and the other of a semi-permeable membrane, the sample of the erythrocyte suspension to be evaluated, and a hypotonic solution, having known isotonicity, for example, distilled water, in suitable volumes, so as to 5 generate slow haemolysis of the erythrocytes as the NaCI ions diffuse towards the solution, for example, distilled water. The progress of haemolysis over time is followed by a measurement of the transmittance (see also J. Didelon et al., Biorheology 37, 2000 : 409-416) by means of a laser beam which has a wavelength of 808 nm. A photoelectric cell measures the variations in the light transmitted 10 through the suspension. For example, the measurements are carried out over 10 minutes. The device allows one or more of the parameters a - e mentioned above to be obtained.<br>
According to a first method, the measurement of the osmotic fragility is carried out on<br>
15 a sample whose initial temperature is from + 1 to + 8 °C, preferably with distilled<br>
water which is also at that temperature, under conditions in which the change in the<br>
temperature isn't detrimental to the measurement. In accordance with a second<br>
method, the measurement of the osmotic fragility is carried out on a sample which is<br>
maintained at the temperature of from + 1 to + 8 °C. Thus, the measurement device<br>
20 described in J. Didelon et al. above may be modified in order to allow the<br>
temperature to be controlled. Preferably, this temperature is similar or identical to the<br>
lysis temperature.<br>
Once one or more of those parameters has/have been determined, a relationship can 25 be applied taking into consideration the parameter(s) in order to establish either the<br>
flow rate of the cells in the dialyser, or the osmolarity of the dialysate, which is<br>
sufficient to obtain red corpuscles which encapsulate the «active» substance and/or<br>
the desired quantity thereof:<br>
Flow rate of erythrocytes =	[Ax (H50)] + [Bx (V)] + K<br>
30	- A and B = variables which are adjustable in accordance with<br>
the dialyser and osmolarity of the lysis solution - K 3= adjustment constant.<br>
Osmolarity of dialysate = [C x (H50)] + [D x (V)] + K<br><br>
WO 2006/016247	PCT/IB2005/002323<br>
9<br>
-	C and D = variables which are adjustable in accordance with<br>
the dialyser and the flow rate of erythrocytes in the dialyser<br>
-	K = adjustment constant.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the concentration of NaCI in g/L which brings about 50% haemolysis is measured (parameter d.) and the flow rate of the erythrocyte suspension in the dialysis cartridge is adjusted in accordance with the measured concentration values.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, the lysis procedure is started when the temperature of the erythrocyte suspension is from + 1 to + 8 °C, and the osmotic fragility has been measured and the lysis parameters recorded.<br>
According to an advantageous feature, the initial suspension to be processed is placed in the lysis/internalisation chamber mentioned above. According to an embodiment of the invention, the process uses a refrigerated module which is provided with temperature control, a pouch of the erythrocyte suspension which is refrigerated at from + 1 to + 8 DC is placed in that module and is connected, or is to be connected, to a sterile single-use removable assembly which comprises a dialysis cartridge, tubes for connecting the cartridge, at one side, to the pouch and, at the other side, to the lysis solution, the module further comprising means which can bring about the circulation of the erythrocyte suspension and the lysis solution, inside which module the temperature is stabilised at from + 1 to + 8 °C. The refrigerated module has dimensions so as to accommodate the pouch and the removable single-use assembly. The fact that the pouch, the dialysis cartridge, the lysis solution, which are connected by the various tubes, are provided in a single refrigerated module of this type is an advantageous feature of the process according to the invention.<br>
The term « pouch » refers to the flexible pouches which are commonly used in the field of blood transfusions and blood derivatives.<br>
According to an important aspect of the invention, steps are taken to keep the erythrocytes in homogeneous suspension in the pouch so as to keep stable the haematrocrit level of the suspension passing through the dialyser. In accordance with<br><br>
WO 2006/016247	PCT/IB2005/002323<br>
10<br>
a feature of the invention, the pouch is thus provided with external loop type circulation which can bring about circulation of the suspension to and from the pouch.<br>
The term dialysis cartridge is intended to refer to an element which comprises two compartments which are separated by a dialysis wall, through which ion exchange may be effected which allows the osmotic pressure of an aqueous solution located in one of the compartments to be modified in a controlled manner, with an aqueous solution comprising a salt being introduced into the other compartment. This type of cartridge is widely used in the medical field. According to a preferred method, a dialysis cartridge having hollow fibres is used, for example, a cartridge of this type having the following specific properties: internal diameter of the fibres of from 100 to 400 µm, total external surface-area of the fibres of from 0.3 to 2 m2, length of fibres of from 10 to 40 cm, ultra-filtration coefficient of from 1.5 to 8 ml/h.mmHg.<br>
As has been set out in detail above, the lysis procedure can be started when the temperature of the suspension in the pouch is from + 1 to + 8 °C. According to an advantageous method, the temperature of the suspension is controlled by means of a sensor which is positioned on the external loop type circulation.<br>
In accordance with the osmotic fragility detected, two main parameters may be adjusted, the flow rate of the erythrocyte suspension in the dialysis cartridge and the osmolarity of the lysis solution, given that it is preferable to fix, in both cases, a constant flow rate for the lysis solution. The value of the flow rate is not critical. Typically, for a dialysis cartridge having hollow fibres, as described above, the flow rate of the lysis solution is fixed at from 50 to 300 ml/min, preferably from 150 to 250 ml/min.<br>
The lysis solution is a saline solution which is hypotonic relative to the suspension of red corpuscles. When it is fixed at a constant value, its osmolarity may typically be from 20 to 120 mOsm, preferably from 70 to 110 mOsm, for example, in the order of 90 mOsm.<br>
By way of example, the lysis solution may comprise Na2HPO4 and/or NaH2PO4 and a sugar, such as glucose.<br><br>
WO 2006/016247	PCT/IB2005/002323<br>
II<br>
According to a first method, the flow rate of the erythrocyte suspension through the dialysis cartridge is adjusted whilst the flow rate and osmolarity of the lysis buffer are fixed. The higher the osmotic fragility, the more the flow rate of the suspension is increased. Typically, for a cartridge whose specifications have been indicated above, the flow rate will be caused to vary within the range from 5 to 200 ml/min, preferably from 10 to 40 ml/min.<br>
According to a second method, the osmolarity of the lysis solution is adjusted, whilst the flow rates of the suspension and the lysis solution are fixed. The higher the osmotic fragility, the more the osmolarity of the lysis solution is increased. Typically, the osmoiarity will be caused to vary within the range from 10 to 200 mOsm/l, preferably from 20 to 150 mOsm/l.<br>
According to a third method, both the flow rate of the erythrocyte suspension through the dialysis cartridge and the osmolarity of the lysis solution are adjusted.<br>
In accordance with the invention, one introduces one or more active ingredients intended to be incorporated in the erythrocytes. The active ingredient(s) can be present in the suspension pouch and/or introduced, preferably progressively, into the suspension circulation upstream or downstream of the dialysis cartridge. Since the volumes introduced are small, refrigeration of the active ingredient is optional.<br>
The suspension of red corpuscles is preferably produced from a globular concentrate which is from a blood group compatible with the recipient, has had the leucocytes removed, has no pathogens detected and in particular is provided in a pouch, for example, containing 500 ml. The red corpuscles may have been irradiated when they are intended for highly immuno-deficient patients who might experience an immunological reaction of the « transplant/host » type (R.J.

According to a particular feature of the invention, the initial globular concentrate which is used to prepare the suspension has been subjected beforehand to a<br><br>

The outlet tube may be connected to a second pouch (intermediate pouch) which can collect the erythrocyte suspension which is discharged from the lysis as well as a resealing solution (preferably introduced by a secondary tube which opens into the outlet tube slightly upstream of the point at which it opens into the intermediate pouch). That pouch is advantageously arranged in a second module which is provided with means capable of controlling the temperature in the module at from + 30 to + 40 °C, preferably from + 35 °C to + 38 °C.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment, the single-use removable assembly comprises, in a single unit, the pouches, circulation tubes, injection tubes (provided with an injection device or a receptacle which is intended to co-operate with such a device), dialysis cartridge and preferably a flask of lysis solution.<br>
Preferably, the removable assembly itself does not comprise specific means intended for cooling or heating. These functions are only carried out by the modules or chambers in which the two portions of the assembly are placed.<br>
The pumps used in the process and the device of the invention are preferably peristaltic pumps (occlusion pumps); according to one embodiment, the pump which brings about the recirculation of the suspension to and from the initial pouch and the pump for circulating the lysis buffer have a constant, predetermined rotation rate, whereas the pump which conveys the suspension towards the dialysis cartridge has a rotation rate which can be adjusted in accordance with the osmotic fragility of the erythrocytes to be processed.<br>
The active ingredient may be introduced by any suitable means, for example, a fixed-rate plunger syringe, which is optionally controlled, connected to the corresponding<br><br>

16<br>
injection tube. By way of a variant, the plunger syringes may be replaced with peristaltic pumps.<br>
The device comprises means for adjusting the flow rate of the erythrocyte suspension through the lysis cartridge and/or adjusting the osmolarity of the lysis solution in accordance with the osmotic fragility of the erythrocytes to be processed.<br>
According to a feature, the flow rate adjustment means are configured to control the pump which conveys the suspension towards the dialysis cartridge. According to another alternative feature, the adjustment means are configured to control the osmolarity of a lysis solution, either in order to dilute and lower the osmolarity, or to increase that osmolarity by a suitable solute being introduced. By way of a variant, a lysis solution having an osmolarity which is adjusted relative to the osmotic fragility of the erythrocytes to be processed may optionally be introduced into the module.<br>
According to a preferred method, the device comprises electronic means which can control the lysis process and optionally the resealing process in accordance with instructions which are input by the operator (for example, the operator directly inputs the data concerning the flow rate of the erythrocyte suspension), or in accordance with data input by the operator, with reference to the osmotic fragility (the electronic means being configured in order to establish and adjust the lysis parameters, for example, the flow rate of the erythrocyte suspension). Those electronic means are preferably connected to the temperature sensors (allowing the temperature in the modules and/or at the temperature sensor for the erythrocyte suspension to be controlled). Those means can control and operate the pumps, for example, the pressure and flow rate of the suspension through the dialysis cartridge.<br>
The modules are preferably provided, at least at one face, with a glass surface which allows visual control of the installation, and the circulation of the solutions and suspensions.<br>
The process and the device according to the invention may be used to incorporate a number of active ingredients, selected in particular from medicaments, vaccines,<br><br>

The present invention further relates to the use of such erythrocytes which contain inositol phosphate, in particular inositol hexaphosphate, which can be obtained in accordance with the process of the invention, for the preparation of a medicament or drug which is intended to treat a patient with hypoxia. Hypoxia is caracterised by a low oxygen delivery to the tissues, particularly to muscle and bones. This treatment is particularly interesting to treat patient suffering of drepanocytosis.

The inositol hexaphosphate or the like incorporated in the erythrocytes leads to a diminution of the oxygen affinity of the hemoglobin. This leads to a better oxygenation of tissues and to a reduction of the hypoxy symptoms due to drepanocytosis. P50 is the O? pressure (PO2) corresponding to a 50 % oxygen saturation of hemoglobin. An increase of P50 by 25 mmHg leads to an increase of oxygenation of about twice (oxygenation is the difference in saturation between PO2 values of 100 mmHg and 40 mmHg). Therefore, for an adult having 2000 mL of red blood cells, transfusion of a blood bag containing 200 mL of erythrocyles containing<br><br>
WO 2006/016247	PCT/IB2005/002323<br>
22<br>
inositol hexaphosphate may lead to a rise of more than 10 % of erythrocytes having an oxygenation power that is twice the normal. This leads to more than 20 % increase of oxygenation which is beneficial in hypoxy individuals.<br>
The method may comprise transfusions by a volume representing between 5 and 20 %, preferably 10-15 % of the erythrocytes mass of the individual, and the frequency of transfusion may be advantageously of one per month or two months.<br>

The removable assembly comprises a flexible pouch 2 which contains the erythrocyte suspension to be lysed. That pouch 2 is provided with a flexible tube 3, in a loop type configuration, which co-operates with the pump P1 in order to bring about circulation to and from the pouch in order to keep the erythrocytes in suspension. The pouch is further connected, at its base, to a flexible tube 4 which is connected to the inlet of the « blood » compartment of a dialysis cartridge 5. That tube 4 cooperates with the pump P2 which brings about the circulation of the suspension from the pouch to the cartridge. A controlled plunger type syringe PS1 is connected to the tube 4 upstream of the cartridge 5, that plunger type syringe being intended to introduce an active ingredient into the circulation of erythrocytes. The outlet of the « blood » compartment of the cartridge 5 is connected to a flexible outlet tube 6 which opens outside the module 1. A second controlled plunger type syringe PS2 is connected to the tube 6, that plunger type syringe being intended to introduce an active ingredient into the circulation of lysed erythrocytes. A flask 7 which contains a lysis solution is arranged in the module 1 and is connected to the « dialysate » inlet of the cartridge 5 by a flexible tube 8 which co-operates with the pump P3 which brings about the circulation of the lysis solution through the cartridge 5. Finally, the lysis solution which is discharged from the cartridge is evacuated from the module 1 by a flexible evacuation tube 9 which opens into a flask 10 which is located outside the module 1.<br>

EXAMPLE 2 : ENCAPSULATION OF ASPARAGINASE<br>
In this example, the osmotic fragility is defined by the concentration of NaCI expressed in g/L bringing about 50% haemolysis.<br>
1) Influence of asparaqinase on the osmotic fragility:<br>
a. Preparation of asparaginase solutions:<br>
2.5 ml of 0.9% NaCI were injected by means of a syringe, via the septum, into a flask<br>
which contains 10000 IU of asparaginase in powder form. The admixture was<br>
agitated until dissolved, a mother solution at a concentration of 4000 ILJ/ml then being<br>
obtained. The contents were removed by means of the syringe and it was placed in a<br>
5 ml haemolysis tube. 3 solutions were prepared and stored at + 4°C : a 0 lU/ml<br><br>

25<br>
solution (constituting a 0.9% NaCl control), a 3200 ILJ/ml solution (625 ^1 of 0.9% NaCI solution were added to the mother solution) and a 1600 IU/ml solution (1 ml of the 3200 IU/ml solution was removed, to which 1 ml of 0.9% NaCI solution was added).<br>
b. Washing the red corpuscles:<br>
-	starting from whole blood which was taken over citrate phosphate dextrose and<br>
centrifuged at +4°C for 20 minutes at 1000g,<br>
-	the plasma was decanted and the buffycoat removed,<br>
-	0.9% NaCI was added at + 4°C, volume for volume, to the concentrate of red<br>
corpuscles,<br>
-	centrifuging was carried out for 20 minutes at 1000 g, then the supernatant was<br>
removed,<br>
-	a second washing operation was carried out, then a third, by repeating both<br>
preceding steps<br>
-	the supernatant was removed and the haematocrit was adjusted to 80% with a<br>
0.9% NaCI solution,<br>
-	tubes were prepared with a volume of suspension of red corpuscles of 875 µl.<br>
This was carried out on 6 blood samples from 6 different donors.<br>
c. Addition of the asparaginase solution<br>
-	the initial osmotic fragility was measured with respect to the 6 samples,<br>
-	125 pL of 0, 1600 or 3200 IU/ml asparaginase solution were added at the rate of 6<br>
tubes for each asparaginase concentration; each tube was gently agitated for a few<br>
moments. The final concentrations contained in the three groups of six tubes are: 0,<br>
200 and 400 ILJ/ml. The tubes were stored at +4°C on crushed ice until the osmotic<br>
fragility was measured,<br>
-	4 incubation times were tested: 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes. The end of the incubation<br>
time is defined as the removal of the tube from the crushed ice,<br>
-	the measurement of osmotic fragility is carried out at ambient temperature.<br><br>

26<br>
d.	The measurements of osmotic fragility are carried out on the device marketed by<br>
SODEREL MEDICAL, Haillecourt, France, under the name OSMOCELLS®<br>
e.	Results<br>
The development and dispersion of the osmotic fragility of the erythrocytes before dialysis, in the absence or in the presence of asparaginase, are set out in Figures 3, 4 and 5.<br>
These results demonstrate a wide variability of the osmotic fragility of the erythrocytes from one blood sample to the next, in accordance with the concentration of asparaginase present and in accordance with time. These results emphasise the importance of measuring the osmotic fragility on the erythrocyte sample to be processed, as close as possible to the dialysis phase, and preferably in the presence of the asparaginase to be encapsulated.<br>

c. Results<br>
Figure 6 shows the encapsulation yield in the case of 400 IU/ml asparaginase with a flow rate P2 of 22 ml/min in the dialyser. It appears that the encapsulation yield varies in accordance with the osmotic fragility before dialysis (5 samples). Optimisation of the process of the invention is brought about by the dialysis parameters being adjusted, and in particular the flow rate of the erythrocyte suspension in the dialyser, in accordance with the osmotic fragility measured, so as to ensure an encapsulation yield which is as constant as possible in spite of the variability inherent in the blood samples.<br>
With the flow rate P2 (flow rate of the erythrocyte suspension in the dialysis cartridge) being taken as the adjustment means, it was possible to establish the following optimum levels for the dialysis cartridge used.<br>

4 to 4.7	25<br>
3.5 to 4	22<br>
The reduction in the flow rate P2 for an osmotic fragility &gt; 4.7 is explained by phenomena resulting from dialysis. The increase in the trans-membranous pressure for flow rates in the order of 26 ml/min and above brings about an increase in the osmosis effect. Therefore, it is advantageous to decrease the flow rate P2, as indicated.<br><br>

In preliminary tests carried out on 14 different samples without taking into account the osmotic fragility and without the flow rate being adjusted, but with flow rates P2 of from 18 to 30 ml/min, it was possible to measure a mean encapsulation yield of from 32 + 12.4%, which represents an excessively wide variability. On the contrary, the adjustement of the flow rate P2 in the above experiment allowed to obtain a much more homogenous mean encapsulation yield (29.8 % ±2.1).<br><br>
