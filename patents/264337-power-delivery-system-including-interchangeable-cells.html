NAMES OF PARTIES TO A JOINT RESEARCH AGREEMENT<br>
[0003] Not applicable.<br>
INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE OF MATERIAL ON DISK<br>
[0004] Not applicable.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0005] In recent years, circuits for medium-voltage variable frequency drive (VFD)<br>
applications have received attention. Several novel methods have been introduced in the past<br>
decade. For example, in a circuit comprising series-connected inverters as described in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,625,545 to Hammond, the disclosure of which is incoiporated herein by reference in<br>
its entirety, an inverter or power cell 110 includes a three-phase diode-bridge rectifier 112, one<br>
or more direct current (DC) capacitors 114, and an H-bridge inverter 116. The rectifier 112<br>
converts the input 118 alternating current (AC) voltage to a substantially constant DC voltage<br>
1<br><br>
that is supported by the capacitors 114 that are connected across the rectifier 112 output. The<br>
output stage of the inverter 110 includes an H-bridge inverter 116 that includes two poles, a left<br>
pole and a right pole, each with two devices. The inverter 110 transforms the DC voltage across<br>
the DC capacitors 114 to an AC output 120 using pulse-width modulation (PWM) of the<br>
semiconductor devices in the H-bridge inverter 116.<br>
[0006] A circuit including power cells such as 110 in FIG. 1, when connected to a<br>
load, such as a motor, can provide power from an input source to the motor when operating in<br>
the motoring mode. Such a power cell may sometimes be referred to as a unidirectional or two-<br>
quadrant (2Q) cell. This is because when the four quadrants of speed and torque are considered,<br>
referring to FIG. 2, the operating characteristics 210 of this cell are such that it operates in either<br>
the quadrant where both speed and torque are positive (first quadrant 201) or the quadrant where<br>
both speed and torque are negative (third quadrant 203).<br>
[0007] However, when the motor speed needs to be reduced, power from the motor<br>
needs to be absorbed by the inverter. This mode of operation, when power must be absorbed by<br>
the inverter, is referred to as the regeneration mode. In such situations, regenerative or four-<br>
quadrant cells are required. An example of a regenerative cell is shown in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,301,130 to Hammond. As shown in FIG. 3, a regenerative power cell 360 may include an<br>
active front end 362 that serves as a first converter that uses insulated gate bipolar transistors<br>
(IGBTs) Q5 - Q10 or other switching devices controlled by PWM. The first converter 362 is<br>
electrically connected in parallel to a second converter 364 and to one or more DC link<br>
capacitors 366. Such a cell receives power from a transformer 346 and delivers it to other cells<br>
in the group and a load 349. Referring to FIG. 2, this cell permits operating characteristics 220<br>
in all four quadrants 201 - 204, including the quadrant where both speed and torque are positive<br>
2<br><br>
(first quadrant 201), the quadrant where torque is positive and speed is negative (second quadrant<br>
202), the quadrant where both speed and torque are negative (third quadrant 203), and the<br>
quadrant where torque is negative and speed is positive (fourth quadrant 204).<br>
[0008] In the prior art, motor systems included two-quadrant or four-quadrant cells.<br>
However, systems that are designed to accommodate one or the other are limited in applicability.<br>
The disclosure contained herein describes attempts to solve one or more of the problems<br>
described above.<br>

7<br><br>
[0031] In various embodiments, a multi-level power circuit includes a plurality of<br>
power cells to drive a load. FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a circuit having such<br>
power cells. In FIG. 4, a transformer 410 delivers three-phase, medium-voltage power to a load<br>
430 such as a three-phase induction motor via an array of single-phase inverters (also referred to<br>
as power cells). The transformer 410 includes primary windings 412 that excite a number of<br>
secondary windings 414 - 425. Although primary winding 412 is illustrated as having a star<br>
configuration, a mesh configuration is also possible. Further, although secondary windings 414<br>
- 425 are illustrated as having a mesh configuration, star-configured secondary windings are<br>
possible, or a combination of star and mesh windings may be used. Further, the number of<br>
secondary windings illustrated in FIG. 4 is merely exemplary, and other numbers of secondary<br>
windings are possible. The circuit may be used for medium voltage applications or, in some<br>
embodiments, other applications.<br>
[0032] Any number of ranks of power cells are connected between the transformer 410<br>
and the load 430. A "rank" is considered to be a three-phase set, or a group of power cells<br>
established across each of the three phases of the power delivery system. Referring to FIG. 4,<br>
rank 450 includes power cells 451-453, rank 460 includes power cells 461-463, rank 470<br>
includes power cells 471-273, and rank 480 includes power cells 4S1-483. Fewer than four<br>
ranks, or more than four ranks, are possible. A central control system 495 sends command<br>
signals to local controls in each cell over fiber optics or another wired or wireless<br>
communications medium 490.<br>
[0033] FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary power cell structure 510. The power cell 510<br>
includes a chassis 512 and a set of power input/output connectors 521-525. Exemplary internal<br>
components of the cell may include any number of capacitors, a heat sink, and an electronics<br>
8<br><br>
assembly that may include items such as insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) modules and<br>
one or more rectifier modules. The IGBTs may be separated for I/O bus locations and to<br>
increase thermal performance.<br>
[0034] The chassis 512 encloses various components of the power cell 510, such as<br>
one or more capacitors, printed circuit boards, heat sinks, etc. The chassis 512 may be fabricated<br>
from any suitable material, such as galvanized steel or another metal, that both mechanically and<br>
electromagnetically isolates the power cell from other power cells in the system during both<br>
normal operation and many abnormal operating conditions. The chassis 512 may serve to<br>
protect internal components of the power cell 510 from damage during shipping and handling,<br>
and it may be configured in a manner such that the electronic module 510 can be placed on any<br>
of its sides without causing any damage to the components of the electronic module 510.<br>
According to various embodiments, the chassis 512 may be comprised of several portions<br>
connected together, and one or more portions of the chassis 512 may be removable. In addition,<br>
the chassis 512 may be of a thickness sufficient to prevent any debris resulting from a failure of<br>
the internal components of the electronic module 510 from exiting the space enclosed by the<br>
chassis 512, thereby preventing any collateral damage to other components in the vicinity of the<br>
electronic module 510.<br>
[0035] As shown in FIG. 5, the power cell 510 may further comprise a plurality of<br>
power plug connectors 521 - 525 coupled to an internal input or output power bus that is<br>
configured to route power to and from the electronic module 510. For example, three of the<br>
power plug connectors 522- 524 may be configured to receive three-phase power from a source,<br>
while two of the power plug connectors 521 and 525 may be configured to deliver single-phase<br>
9<br><br>
power to a load.. The power plug connectors permit the cells to be plugged into a master power<br>
plane.<br>
[0036] The power cell arrangement described in FIGs. 4 and 5 provides a modular,<br>
multilevel system that allows cells to be replaced as needed to accommodate different design<br>
requirements, or to replace a failed cell. In addition, the cells 510 shown in FIG. 5 are physically<br>
interchangeable so that they may contain either the elements of a two-quadrant cell, such as the<br>
elements shown in FIG. 1, or the elements of a regenerative (four-quadrant) cell, such as the<br>
elements shown in FIG. 3. In this manner, individual cell locations can be populated replaced as<br>
with regenerative or non-regenerative cell as necessary to provide for a desired degree of<br>
braking. The chassis 512 of each cell 510 will thus have substantially the same size and shape,<br>
regardless or whether it is a regenerative cell or non-regenerative cell.<br>
[0037] FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary support structure 644 for multiple power cells,<br>
such as nine cells, within a housing wherein each power cell or other electronic module is<br>
positioned on one or more mounting rails 646 so that the rear of each cell faces a backplane 648<br>
and the cell's power plugs contact the cell power connections 621-625 through the backplane<br>
648. The backplane 648 may be fabricated from any suitable non-conductive material, such as a<br>
high-strength non-conductive laminate material, and it provides a barrier between individual<br>
cells and other aspects of the system.<br>
[003 8] The support structure is designed to provide a plurality of cell locations 650,<br>
each of which may receive an interchangeable cell (such as 510 in FIG. 5) that is either a<br>
regenerative cell or a non-regenerative cell. In this manner, a single power cell system may<br>
include all regenerative cells, all non-regenerative cells, or some mixture of regenerative and<br>
non-regenerative cells depending on the desired degree of braking. A cell 510 may be sized to<br>
10<br><br>
slide into a cell location 650 along the support rails 646, and the cell's power plugs will then<br>
engage the cell power connections 621-625. Optionally, additional connections such as wire<br>
trays 630 may be provided to accommodate control wires that are routed to and from the cells.<br>
Also optionally, one or more secondary power busses 628 may be provided for the direction of<br>
current to or from each cell. FIG. 7 illustrates the exemplary support structure 644 with a power<br>
cell 510 positioned in one of the cell locations.<br>
[0039] Still other embodiments will become readily apparent to those skilled in this art<br>
from reading the above-recited detailed description and drawings of certain exemplary<br>
embodiments. It should be understood that numerous variations, modifications, and additional<br>
embodiments are possible, and accordingly, all such variations, modifications, and embodiments<br>
are to be regarded as being within the spirit and scope of this application<br>
