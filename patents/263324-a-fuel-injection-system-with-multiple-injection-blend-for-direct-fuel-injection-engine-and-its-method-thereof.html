MULTIPLE INJECTION BLEND FOR DIRECT INJECTED ENGINES<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to methods and systems for<br>
direct fuel injection engines.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Controlling the amount of fuel and air to be delivered per<br>
cylinder for a four stroke internal combustion engine is important to achieve<br>
optimum performance. Proper timing of intake and exhaust valves also<br>
provide for better performance. Conventional engines include camshafts that<br>
regulate the timing of the valves. The rotation of the camshaft can be<br>
controlled to ensure proper timing of each valve. In addition cam phasers<br>
may be included to alter the position of the camshafts relative to the<br>
crankshaft, which provides for further opportunities to properly adjust the<br>
timing of each valve.<br>
[0004] The placement of fuel injectors within the engine and the<br>
control of fuel injection timing also impacts engine performance. Spark-<br>
ignited direct injected (SIDI) engines locate one fuel injector per cylinder,<br>
mounted directly over the cylinder head. Each injector is controlled<br>
individually to inject fuel directly into the cylinder.<br>
[0005] Conventional methods of controlling fuel during idle<br>
conditions in a SIDI engine include intentionally retarding the spark timing in<br>
order to provide a reserve torque. Spark timing is then advanced when a<br>
request for torque is initiated. This allows the engine to respond to load<br>
demands during idle operation. Retarding spark at idle provides for sub-<br>
optimal efficiency.<br><br>
2<br>
[0006] Other methods of fuel injection control include delivering<br>
multiple fuel injection events per cylinder per combustion cycle. A direct<br>
injection engine may use two injection events per cylinder per combustion<br>
cycle in special operation regimes to provide additional energy for converter<br>
lightoff, a smooth idle, and reduce engine knock. Unfortunately, the dual<br>
injection mode of operation produces higher hydrocarbon emissions and<br>
particulates. Accordingly, engine control may primarily include providing one<br>
injection event per cylinder per combustion cycle for emissions reasons. The<br>
dual injection method may be sparingly used for special operation regimes.<br>
[0007] Dual injection per cylinder per combustion cycle generates<br>
more or less engine torque than a single injection mode within the same<br>
engine at similar operating conditions. Accordingly, drivability may be<br>
affected by sudden engine output torque changes during periods when the<br>
fuel delivery mode changes from a single to a multiple injection mode and vice<br>
versa.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0008] Accordingly, a fuel injection system for a direct fuel injection<br>
engine is provided. The system includes an injection mode module to select a<br>
fuel injection mode to be one of a single injection mode and a dual injection<br>
mode and a fuel injection command module that transitions between the<br>
single and dual injection modes by varying the timing of fuel injection events<br>
relative to a crankshaft position.<br>
[0009] In addition, a fuel injection method of a direct fuel injection<br>
engine is provided. The method includes operating the engine in a single<br>
injection mode, commanding fuel delivery at a first crankshaft position,<br>
receiving a request to transition from a single injection mode to a dual<br>
injection mode and transitioning to the dual injection mode by commanding<br>
fuel delivery at a second crankshaft position and at a third crankshaft position<br>
wherein the third crankshaft position is changed incrementally during<br><br>
3<br>
subsequent combustion cycles until a target third crankshaft position is<br>
reached.<br>
[0010] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0016] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
is in no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For<br>
purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings<br>
to identify the same elements. As used herein, the term module and/or device<br>
refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit,<br>
a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or<br>
more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit and/or other<br>
suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0017] Referring now to Figure 1, an engine system 10 includes an<br>
engine 12 that combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque. Air<br>
is drawn into an intake manifold 14 through a throttle 16. The throttle 16<br>
regulates mass air flow into the intake manifold 14. Air within the intake<br>
manifold 14 is distributed into cylinders 18. Although a single cylinder 18 is<br>
illustrated, it can be appreciated that the engine can have a plurality of<br>
cylinders including, but not limited to, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16 cylinders.<br>
[0018] A fuel injector 20 is electronically controlled to inject fuel into<br>
the cylinder 18. Fuel is combined with air as it is drawn into the cylinder 18<br>
through the intake port. An intake valve 22 selectively opens and closes to<br>
enable the air to enter the cylinder 18. The intake valve position is regulated<br>
by an intake camshaft 24. A piston (not shown) compresses the air/fuel<br>
mixture within the cylinder 18. A spark plug 26 initiates combustion of the<br>
air/fuel mixture, driving the piston in the cylinder 18. The piston drives a<br>
crankshaft (not shown) to produce drive torque. Combustion exhaust within<br>
the cylinder 18 is forced out through an exhaust manifold 28 when an exhaust<br>
valve 30 is in an open position. The exhaust valve position is regulated by an<br>
exhaust camshaft 32. The exhaust can then be treated in an exhaust system<br>
(not shown). Although single intake and exhaust valves 22,30 are illustrated,<br>
it can be appreciated that the engine 12 can include multiple intake and<br>
exhaust valves 22,30 per cylinder 18.<br><br>
5<br>
[0019] A crankshaft sensor 34 senses a position of the crankshaft<br>
and generates a crankshaft signal. A control module 36 receives the<br>
crankshaft signal, interprets the signal as degrees of rotation and schedules<br>
fuel injection events based on the interpretation of the signal. The control<br>
module 36 sends a fuel injection signal to the fuel injector to control the<br>
amount and the timing of the fuel delivery. The fuel injection signal can be a<br>
pulse width modulated signal where the pulse width regulates the amount of<br>
fuel delivered to the cylinder.<br>
[0020] Referring now to Figure 2, the present disclosure provides a<br>
control method and system that governs the transitions between single and<br>
dual fuel injection modes. A dataflow diagram illustrates a fuel injection<br>
system that may be embedded within the control module 36. Various<br>
embodiments of fuel injection systems according to the present disclosure<br>
may include any number of sub-modules embedded within the control module<br>
36. The sub-modules shown may be combined and/or further partitioned to<br>
similarly govern the transitions between the single injection mode and the dual<br>
injection mode during engine operation.<br>
[0021] In various embodiments, the control module 36 of Figure 2<br>
includes an injection mode module 50 and a fuel injection command module<br>
52. The injection mode module 50 receives engine and vehicle operating<br>
data 54 as an input. As can be appreciated, the inputs to the injection mode<br>
module 50 may be sensed from the system 10, received from other control<br>
modules (not shown) in the system, or determined from other sub-modules<br>
within the control module 36. Figure 3 provides a flow chart with an<br>
exemplary method of transitioning between single injection and dual injection<br>
modes where vehicle operating data 54 includes coolant temperature, engine<br>
speed and vehicle speed. This exemplary method will be described in greater<br>
detail hereinafter.<br><br>
6<br>
[0022] Based on the operating data 54, the injection mode module<br>
50 selects an injection mode 56 to be one of a single injection mode and a<br>
dual injection mode. The fuel injection command module 52 receives the<br>
injection mode 56 and a crankshaft position 58 as inputs. The fuel injection<br>
command module 52 schedules fuel injection events and provides a fuel<br>
command 60 based on the injection mode 56 and the crankshaft position 58.<br>
[0023] During the dual injection mode, two injection events are<br>
scheduled per cylinder per combustion cycle. This generates a change in<br>
torque without increasing fuel consumption. Fuel injection command module<br>
52 smoothly transitions engine operation between single and dual injection<br>
modes of operation. Torque variations or "bumps" during operating mode<br>
transitions are minimized.<br>
[0024] Referring to Figure 3, the flow chart illustrates an exemplary<br>
method of transitioning between single injection and dual injection modes. In<br>
this example, it may be beneficial to switch from a single injection mode to a<br>
dual injection mode to perform catalytic converter light off. Catalytic converter<br>
light off may be implemented soon after engine start-up to quickly heat up the<br>
catalyst within the catalytic converter to reduce engine emissions. Catalytic<br>
converter light off is an example sub-mode of dual injection operation that<br>
may be determined by injection mode module 50. Once this sub-mode of<br>
operation is entered, control block 66 determines the temperature of the<br>
engine coolant. Decision block 68 determines if the coolant temperature is<br>
less than a predetermined constant K1. K1 may be chosen to represent a<br>
temperature indicative of an engine operating at start up or having run for a<br>
minimal amount of time. If the coolant temperature is greater than or equal to<br>
K1, control returns to control block 66. If the coolant temperature is less than<br>
K1, control block 70 determines the engine operating speed.<br>
[0025] Control block 72 determines if the engine speed is less than<br>
a predetermined constant K2. If the engine is operating at a relatively low<br>
speed near idle, catalytic converter light off may be desirable. If the engine is<br><br>
7<br>
operating at a higher speed, sufficient energy and additional fuel may already<br>
be supplied to the catalytic converter such that additional fuel need not be<br>
provided. Accordingly, if the engine speed is greater than or equal to K2,<br>
control returns to control blqck 66. If the engine speed is less than K2, control<br>
block 74 determines the vehicle speed.<br>
[0026] If the vehicle is in motion above a predetermined speed,<br>
catalytic converter light off may not be desirable because immediate engine<br>
response to a torque request may be desired. As such, decision block 76<br>
determines if the vehicle speed is less than the predetermined constant K3. If<br>
the vehicle speed is greater than or equal to K3, control is returned to control<br>
block 66. If the vehicle speed is less than K3, control block 78 transitions<br>
engine fuel injection from the single injection mode to the dual injection mode.<br>
The specific steps taken during the transition will be described in greater<br>
detail hereinafter.<br>
[0027] Once a transition from the single injection mode to the dual<br>
injection mode has been completed, control block 80 determines the amount<br>
of time that the engine has been operating in the dual injection mode.<br>
Decision block 82 determines if the dual injection mode operating time is<br>
greater than a predetermined constant K4. If the engine has not been<br>
operating within the dual injection mode greater than K4, control returns to<br>
control block 80. If the dual injection mode operating time exceeds K4, control<br>
block 84 calculates an amount of energy added to the catalytic converter by<br>
operation in the dual injection mode.<br>
[0028] Decision block 86 determines if the energy added exceeds a<br>
predetermined threshold of K5. If the energy threshold has not been reached,<br>
control returns to control block 84. If the energy threshold, K5, has been<br>
exceeded, catalytic converter light off has been completed and control block<br>
88 transitions from the dual injection mode to the single injection mode.<br><br>
8<br>
[0029] Referring now to Figure 4, timing diagrams for scheduling<br>
fuel injection events according to the present disclosure are shown. In the<br>
example depicted, control begins in the dual injection mode shown generally<br>
at 100. During the dual injection mode, two injection events are scheduled<br>
per cylinder per combustion cycle. If injection mode module 50 determines<br>
that appropriate conditions exist, control switches to a single injection mode<br>
shown generally at 200.<br>
[0030] Injection mode module 50 may determine through evaluation<br>
of operating data 54 that a dual injection mode should be entered. Examples<br>
relating to special operation regimes where mode switching would be<br>
beneficial include dual injection sub-modes such as the catalytic converter<br>
light off sub-mode previously described as well as idle fuel efficiency increase<br>
sub-mode, an idle stability sub-mode and an engine knock reduction sub-<br>
mode. While these sub-modes will not be described in great detail, it should<br>
be noted that entry and exit from these sub-modes of operation of double<br>
injection may cause torque variations as previously described. As such, the<br>
present disclosure provides an apparatus and a method of minimizing torque<br>
variations during transition between dual injection and single injection modes.<br>
[0031] Fuel injection events can be scheduled according to the<br>
crankshaft position indicated by degrees of crank rotation. A crankshaft signal<br>
can be interpreted as a position in crank degrees. Each diagram illustrates<br>
the position of the crankshaft in crank degrees during intake and compression<br>
cycles. The piston begins an intake stroke at three hundred sixty (360) crank<br>
rotation degrees before top dead center at 110. The piston begins a<br>
compression stroke at one hundred eighty (180) crank rotation degrees before<br>
top dead center (also referred to bottom dead center (BDC)) at 120. The<br>
piston ends the compression stroke at top dead center or zero (0) crank<br>
rotation degrees shown at 130. Firing of spark for both the single injection<br>
mode 200 and the dual injection mode 100 typically occurs near top dead<br>
center of the compression stroke at 140. In the example depicted in Figure 4,<br><br>
9<br>
firing occurs between ten (10) and zero (0) crank degrees before top dead<br>
center. However, as will be described, spark timing may also be varied to<br>
provide a smooth transition between single and dual injection modes.<br>
[0032] As mentioned, the dual injection mode 100 provides two fuel<br>
injection events per cylinder per intake and compression cycle. The first<br>
injection event is scheduled early in the intake cycle and can be scheduled<br>
anywhere between two hundred fifty (250) and three hundred eighty (380)<br>
crank degrees before top dead center. An exemplary range for scheduling<br>
the first fuel delivery is between two hundred and seventy (270) and three<br>
hundred and thirty (330) crank degrees before top dead center as shown at<br>
160.<br>
[0033] The second fuel injection event is scheduled in one of the<br>
intake and compression cycles and can be scheduled anywhere between zero<br>
(0) and three hundred sixty (360) crank degrees before top dead center. An<br>
exemplary range for scheduling the second fuel delivery is between one<br>
hundred twenty (120) and two hundred seventy (270) crank degrees before<br>
top dead center as shown at 170. The second injection event injects the<br>
remainder of fuel necessary for the combustion cycle.<br>
[0034] If an injection mode change is requested, the injection mode<br>
is transitioned over time to the single injection mode 200 where a single<br>
injection event is scheduled early in the intake cycle. The injection event is<br>
scheduled early and can be scheduled anywhere between two hundred fifty<br>
(250) and three hundred eighty (380) crank degrees before top dead center.<br>
An exemplary range for scheduling the fuel delivery is between two hundred<br>
and seventy (270) and three hundred and thirty (330) crank degrees before<br>
top dead center as shown at 180. The single injection mode 200 delivers<br>
more or less torque than dual injection for the same conditions but allows for<br>
spark timing to be near minimum best torque (MBT) or knock border limit<br>
(KBL) to improve efficiency.<br><br>
10<br>
[0035] Figure 4 includes additional timing diagrams depicting<br>
injection pulse timing during the transition between dual injection mode 100<br>
and single injection mode 200. In particular, timing diagram 210 shows the<br>
start of transition from dual injection mode 100 to single injection mode 200.<br>
Within the first step of the transition at timing diagram 210, the first fuel<br>
delivery 160 is performed at the same or similar time as previously described<br>
in reference to dual injection mode 100 while a second fuel injection event is<br>
scheduled ten degrees advanced from the prior second injection as shown at<br>
220. Timing diagram 230 represents the next intake and compression strokes<br>
for a given cylinder where the first injection event schedule remains constant<br>
while the second injection event has been advanced another ten crank<br>
degrees as shown at 240. Timing diagrams 250 and 270 depict second<br>
injection events 260 and 280, respectively. Second injection event 260<br>
occurs at ten crank degrees advanced relative to second injection event 240.<br>
Second injection event 280 occurs ten degrees advanced relative to second<br>
injection event 260. After timing diagram 270 has been implemented, control<br>
switches to single injection mode 200. To transition from single injection<br>
mode 200 to dual injection mode 100, the previously described method is<br>
reversed.<br>
[0036] As mentioned earlier, spark delivery timing may also be<br>
varied during injection mode switching. Spark timing modification is based on<br>
the sub-mode of dual injection. In the idle fuel efficiency increase sub-mode,<br>
spark timing is typically near MBT in the dual injection mode. During<br>
transition from the dual injection to the single injection mode, spark timing is<br>
retarded by about five to ten degrees so that torque fluctuations are<br>
minimized. Spark advance is lag filtered toward MBT during transitions from<br>
the single injection to the dual injection mode.<br><br>
11<br>
[0037] Idle stability and catalytic converter light off sub-modes<br>
typically include retarding spark timing to after top dead center during the dual<br>
injection mode. When transitioning from the dual injection mode to the single<br>
injection mode, spark timing is advanced toward the single injection target<br>
spark timing at a rate of about two degrees per cylinder combustion event.<br>
This process is reversed during transition from the single injection to the dual<br>
injection mode.<br>
[0038] The engine knock reduction sub-mode is entered to ensure<br>
absence of engine knock. The dual injection mode is entered to achieve this<br>
goal. During transition from the single injection to the dual injection mode,<br>
spark timing is lag filtered toward a dual injection spark timing target. The<br>
target spark timing is less retarded than possible to assure engine knock<br>
reduction.<br>
[0039] It should be appreciated that transition between the single<br>
injection mode and the dual injection mode may be accomplished solely via<br>
adjustment of the second injection event timing as depicted in Figure 4 or may<br>
also include in combination modifying the spark timing during the transition.<br>
In addition, those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the<br>

commanding fuel delivery at a first crankshaft position;<br>
receiving a request to transition from a single injection mode to a dual<br>
injection mode; and<br>
transitioning to the dual injection mode by commanding fuel delivery at<br>
a second crankshaft position and at a third crankshaft position wherein the third<br>
crankshaft position is changed incrementally during subsequent combustion cycles<br>
until a target third crankshaft position is reached.<br><br>
14<br>
11.	The method of claim 10 wherein the commanding fuel delivery<br>
at a first crankshaft position further includes commanding fuel delivery when<br>
the crankshaft position is within a first predetermined range during an intake<br>
cycle of an engine cylinder.<br>
12.	The method of claim 11 wherein the commanding fuel delivery<br>
at a second crankshaft position and at a third crankshaft position further<br>
includes commanding fuel delivery at the second crankshaft position when the<br>
crankshaft position is within a second predetermined range and commanding<br>
fuel delivery at the third crankshaft position when the crankshaft position is<br>
within a third predetermined range during intake and compression cycles of<br>
the engine cylinder.<br>
13.	The method of claim 12 wherein the second predetermined<br>
range is substantially the first predetermined range.<br>
14.	The method of claim 10 wherein the third crankshaft position is<br>
retarded at a rate of ten degrees per cylinder combustion event until the target<br>
third crankshaft position is reached.<br>
15.	The method of claim 14 wherein the third crankshaft position is<br>
varied between 120 and 270 degrees of crankshaft rotation before top dead<br>
center.<br>
16.	The method of claim 10 further including receiving a request to<br>
transition from the dual injection mode to a single injection mode and<br>
transitioning to the single injection mode by commanding fuel delivery at the<br>
third crankshaft position to be advanced at a predetermined rate during<br>
subsequent combustion cycles.<br><br>
15<br>
17.	The method of claim 10 wherein transitioning to the dual<br>
injection mode includes commanding spark delivery at a first spark timing<br>
position and varying spark timing per subsequent combustion cycles until<br>
spark is delivered at a second spark timing position.<br>
18.	The method of claim 17 further including anticipating a sub-<br>
mode of dual injection operation to be entered and setting the first spark<br>
timing position based on the anticipated sub-mode.<br>
19.	The method of claim 18 wherein the sub-modes include idle fuel<br>
efficiency increase, idle stability, catalytic converter light off and engine knock<br>
reduction.<br>
20.	The method of claim 19 wherein the first spark timing position is<br>
set to a value ranging from five to ten degrees retarded from a maximum<br>
brake torque value and wherein the second spark timing position is near the<br>
maximum brake torque value when transitioning to the idle fuel efficiency<br>
increase sub-mode.<br>
21.	The method of claim 19 wherein transitioning to one of the idle<br>
stability and the catalytic converter light off sub-modes includes setting the<br>
second spark timing position to occur after top dead center.<br>
22.	The method of claim 19 wherein transition to the engine knock<br>
reduction sub-mode includes setting the second spark timing position at a<br>
value retarded relative to the first spark timing position.<br><br>
A fuel injection system for a direct fuel injection engine includes an<br>
injection mode module. The injection mode module selects a fuel injection<br>
mode to be one of a single injection mode and a dual injection mode. A fuel<br>
injection command module transitions between the single and dual injection<br>
modes by varying the timing of fuel injection events relative to a crankshaft<br>
position.<br></td>
