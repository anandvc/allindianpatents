				<td>Surfactant Composition Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a surfactant composition comprising a sorbitan-ester and a sorbitol ester, to an emulsion formed using the surfactant composition, and in particular to a personal care or cosmetic product formed from the emulsion.<br>
Background<br>
Sorbitan esters have been used for many years as surface active agents, having emulsifying, dispersing, wetting and/or solubilising properties in a wide range of applications such as personal care, cleaning, general industrial, food, and many others. In particular, sorbitan esters have been used as emulsifiers in personal care applications, for example skin care, sunscreens, toiletries, decorative cosmetics, perfumes and fragrances.<br>
Commercial production of sorbitan esters normally involves the reaction of sorbitol with fatty acids or derivatives thereof, and results in a complex mixture of products including sorbitol mono- di-, tri-, and higher esters, sorbitan mono-, di-, and higher-esters, isosorbide mono-, and di-esters, and non-esterified sorbitol, sorbitan and isosorbide. The concentrations of the aforementioned individual components can vary, but sorbitan esters are the main components. There can be significant amounts<br>
-* •„<br>
of isosorbide esters present, but sorbitol esters are normally present at very low concentrations. The number of carbon atoms present in the hydrophobe of the sorbitol/sorbitan/isosorbide esters is dependant upon the particular fatty acid(s) employed in the reaction, and the average number thereof will be substantially the same for all of the components.<br>
Current commercially available sorbitan esters are effective emulsifiers in many applications, but there is still a requirement to improve the properties thereof, particularly in personal care applications, such as flexibility of use, improved water resistance, smooth and light skin feel, and spreading properties. Often an additional co-emulsifier is required to be used with sorbitan esters, and there would be significant advantages if a sorbitol based self-emulsifying system could be<br><br>
developec i.e. without the need for a co-emulsifier, particularly one capable of forming liquid crystals in water, and especially in oil in water emulsions.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
We have now surprisingly discovered a surfactant composition which overcomes or significantly reduces at least one of the aforementioned problems.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a surfactant composition comprising at least one sorbitan ester and at least one sorbitol ester wherein the mean number of carbon atoms of the hydrophobe of the sorbitan ester is greater than that of the sorbitol ester.<br>
The invention also provides a method of forming a surfactant composition which comprises mixing together a sorbitan ester component and a sorbitol ester component wherein the mean number of carbon atoms of the hydrophobe of the sorbitan ester is greater than that of the sorbitol ester.<br>
The invention further provides an emulsion comprising a surfactant composition capable of forming liquid crystals in water which comprises at least one sorbitan ester and at least one sorbitol ester wherein the mean number of carbon atoms of the hydrophobe of the sorbitan ester is greater than that of the sorbitol ester.<br>
The invention further provides a personal care or cosmetic product comprising a surfactant composition comprising at least one sorbitan ester and at least one sorbitol ester wherein the mean number of carbon atoms of the hydrophobe of the sorbitan ester is greater than that of the sorbitol ester.<br>
The invention still further provides the use of a surfactant composition comprising at least one sorbitan ester and at least one sorbitol ester wherein the mean number of carbon atoms of the hydrophobe of the sorbitan ester is greater than that of the sorbitol ester, to stabilise an emulsion.<br><br>
The invention yet further provides the use of a surfactant composition comprising at least 3% by weight of at least one one sorbitol ester, to form liquid crystals in the water phase of an oil in water emulsion, to stabilise the emulsion.<br>

The concentration of sorbitan ester, preferably sorbitan laurate, in the sorbitol ester component is suitably less than 30%, preferably in the range from 1 to 20%, more preferably 3 to 12%, particularly 5 to 9%, and especially 6 to 8% by weight of the total composition.<br>
The concentration of free polyol, preferably sorbitol, sorbitan and/or isosorbide, present in the sorbitol ester component is preferably in the range from 2 to 60%, more preferably 10 to 50%, particularly 15 to 40%, and particularly 20 to 30% by<br><br>
weight of the to-=1 composition. Preferably greater than 50%, more preferably greater than 75%, particularly greater than 85%, and especially greater than 95% by weight of the free polyol in the sorbitol ester component is sorbitol.<br>
The preferred concentration ranges of sorbitol monoesters and diesters in the sorbitol ester component are the same as those given above for the surfactant composition according to the present invention.<br>
In order to form a surfactant composition according to the present invention, the sorbitan ester component is suitably mixed together with the sorbitol ester component at a weight ratio in the range from 0.5 to 100:1, preferably 3 to 50:1, more preferably 7 to 15:1, particularly 8 to 10:1, and especially 8.5 to 9.5:1.<br>
The surfactant composition according to the present invention is capable of forming liquid crystals in water, preferably forms liquid crystals, more preferably in emulsions, and particularly in oil in water emulsions. The liquid crystals which are formed are preferably lyotropic liquid crystals (i.e. both concentration and temperature dependant), more preferably lamellar phase liquid crystals, and particularly L alpha phase (neat) liquid crystals.<br>
The surfactant composition is suitable for use in forming emulsions (and dispersions), i.e. as the, or as part of the, emulsifier system, such as water in oil emulsions, oil in polyol (e.g. glycerol) emulsions, particularly oil in water emulsions, and especially for use in personal care or cosmetic products.<br>
The oil phase of the emulsion according to the present invention will preferably mainly be an emollient oil of the type used in personal care or cosmetic products. The emollient can and usually will be an oily material which is liquid at ambient temperature. Alternatively it can be solid at ambient temperature, in which case in bulk it will usually be a waxy solid, provided it is liquid at an elevated temperature at which it can be included in and emulsified in the composition. The manufacture of the composition preferably uses temperatures up to 100°C, more preferably about 80°C, and therefore such solid emollients will preferably have melting temperatures of less than 100°C, and more preferably less than 70°C.<br><br>
Suitable normally liquid emollient oils include non-polar oils, for example mineral or paraffin, especially isoparaffin, oils, such as that sold by Uniqema as Arlamol (trade mark) HD; or medium polarity oils, for example vegetable ester oils such as jojoba oil, vegetable glyceride oils, animal glyceride oils, such as that sold by Uniqema as Estol (trade mark) 3603 (caprylic/capric triglyceride), synthetic oils, for example synthetic ester oils, such as isopropyl palmitate and those sold by Uniqema as Estol 1512 and Arlamol DOA, ether oils, particularly of two fatty e.g. C8 to C18 alkyl residues, such as that sold by Cognis as Cetiol OE (dicaprylether), guerbet alcohols such as that sold by Cognis as Eutanol G (octyl dodecanol), or silicone oils, such as dimethicione oil such as those sold by Dow Corning as DC200, cyclomethicone oil, or silicones having polyoxyalkylene side chains to improve their hydrophilicity; or highly polar oils including alkoxylate emollients for example fatty alcohol propoxylates such as that sold by Uniqema as Arlamol E (propoxylated stearyl alcohol). Suitable emollient materials that can be solid at ambient temperature but liquid at temperatures typically used to make the compositions of this invention include jojoba wax, tallow and coconut wax/oil. When non-polar oils are used it may be desirable to use relatively high concentrations of surfactant composition according to the present invention, in order to achieve suitably satisfactory emulsification, particularly to obtain small oil droplets.<br>
Mixtures of emollients can and often will be used, and in some cases solid emollients may dissolve wholly or partly in liquid emollients or in combination the freezing point of the mixture is suitably low. Where the emollient composition is a solid (such as fatty alcohols) at ambient temperature, the resulting dispersion may technically not be an emulsion (although in most cases the precise phase of the oily disperse phase cannot readily be determined) but such dispersions behave as if they were true emulsions and the term emulsion is used herein to include such compositions.<br>
The concentration of the oil phase may vary widely. The amount of oil in the emulsion is suitably in the range from 1 to 90%, preferably 3 to 60%, more preferably 5 to 40%, particularly 8 to 20%, and especially 10 to 15% by weight of the total composition.<br><br>
The amount of water (or polyol, e.g. glycerin) present in the emulsion is suitably greater than 5%, preferably in the range from 30 to 90%, more preferably 50 to 90%, particularly 70 to 85%, and especially 75 to 80% by weight of the total composition. The amount of surfactant composition defined herein in an emulsion or personal care or cosmetic product according to the present invention is suitably in the range from 0.1 to 10%, preferably 0.5 to 8%, more preferably 1 to 7%, particularly 1.5 to 6%, and especially 2 to 5.5%, by weight of the total composition.<br>
The emulsions according to the present invention may also contain other additional surfactant materials which form part of the emuisifier system. Other suitable surfactants include relatively hydrophilic surfactants, e.g. having a HLB value of greater than 10, preferably greater than 12, and relatively hydrophobic surfactants e.g. having a HLB value of less than 10, preferably less than 8. Relatively hydrophilic surfactants include alkoxylate surfactants with an average in the range from about 10 to about 100 alkylene oxide, particularly ethylene oxide residues; and relatively hydrophobic surfactants include alkoxylate surfactants preferably with an average in the range from about 3 to about 10 alkylene oxide, particularly ethylene oxide residues.<br>
Personal care or cosmetic emulsions can be divided by viscosity into milks and lotions, which preferably have a low shear viscosity (measured at shear rates of about 0.1 to 10 s"1 as is typically used in Brookfield viscometers) of up to 10,000 mPa.s, and creams which preferably have a low shear viscosity of more than 10,000 mPa.s. Milks and lotions preferably have a low shear viscosity in the range from 100 to 10,000, more preferably 200 to 5,000, and particularly 300 to 1,000 mPa.s. The amount of surfactant composition according to the present invention present in a milk or lotion is preferably in the range from 2 to 3% by weight of the total composition.<br>
Creams preferably have a low shear viscosity of at least 20,000, more preferably in the range from 30,000 to 80,000, and particularly 40,000 to 70,000 mPa.s, although even higher viscosities e.g. up to about 106 mPa.s, may also be used. The amount of surfactant composition present in a cream is preferably in the range from 4 to 5.5% by weight of the total composition.<br><br>
The emulsions of the invention may be made by generally conventional emulsification and mixing methods. For example, the surfactant composition may be added to (i) the oil phase, which is then added to the aqueous phase, or (ii) both the combined oil and water phases, or (iii) the water phase, which is then added to the oil phase. Method (iii) is preferred. In all of these methods, the resulting mixture can then be emulsified using standard techniques. It is preferred to either heat the aqueous and oil phases usually above about 60°C, e.g. to about 80 to 85°C, or to subject the aqueous phase to high intensity mixing at lower, e.g. about ambient, temperature. Vigorous mixing and the use of moderately elevated temperatures can be combined if desired. The heating and/or high intensity mixing can be carried out before, during or after addition of the oil phase but once emulsified, care should be taken not to destroy the liquid crystal system by excessive mixing or stirring.<br>
The emulsions can also be made by inverse emulsification methods, whereby the surfactant composition is added to either the oil phase or the aqueous phase, and the aqueous phase is mixed into the oil phase to initially form a water in oil emulsion. Aqueous phase addition is continued until the system inverts to form an oil in water emulsion. Plainly a substantial amount of aqueous phase will generally be needed to effect inversion and so this method is not likely to be used for high oil phase content emulsions. Vigorous mixing and the use of moderately elevated temperatures can be combined if desired. Heating can be carried out during or after addition of the aqueous phase and before, during or after inversion. High intensity mixing can be carried out during or after addition of the aqueous phase, and before or during inversion<br>
The emulsions may for example be microemulsions or nanoemulsions, having a mean droplet size over a wide range, preferably in the range from 10 to 10,000 nm. In one embodiment,, the emulsion droplet size may be reduced, for example by high pressure homogenisation, preferably to a value in the range from 100 to 1,000 nm, more preferably 300 to 600 nm.<br>
The emulsions according to the present invention are stable, measured as described herein, preferably for greater than one month, more preferably greater than two months, particularly greater than three months, and especially greater than four months at ambient temperature (23°C), and also preferably at 40°C. The stability at<br><br>
even higher temperatures can be particularly important, and therefore the emulsion is stable, measured as described herein, suitably for greater than one week, preferably greater than two weeks, more preferably greater than 3 weeks, particularly greater than one month, and especially greater than two months at 50°C. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the liquid crystals created during emulsion formation are substantially maintained during the aforementioned time and temperature testing regimes.<br>

In this specification the following test methods have been used.<br>
(1) Analysis of C12 Sorbitol Esters by Reverse Phase HPLC The test sample was dissolved in isopropyl alcohol/water and injected on a HPLC system using a Reversed Phase C8 column and an evaporative light scattering detector. The different sorbitol esters and unreacted polyol were eluted using a<br><br>
gradient of water and acetonitrile and indentified by their retention times. Quantification was based on peak area percent.<br>
(a)	Reagents<br>
All reagents were of recognised analytical quality, namely isopropyl alcohol, acetonitrile, and water (all 'HiPerSolve', ex BDH).<br>
(b)	Equipment<br>
HPLC system employed was Agilent 1 100 series comprising G1379A de-gasser, G1311A quaternary pump, G1313A autosampFer and G1316A column oven with a Polymer Labs PL ELS-1000 evaporative light scattering detector and Chemstation LC software. Other materials used were 28.25 ml glass vial (ex VWR 215007823), 2 ml autosampler vial (ex VWR 3721 1 1 102), 1 1 mm autosampler vial crimp cap (ex VWR 37221 1 134), 1 1 mm vial crimping tool (VWR 372340544), disposable pasteur pipettes (ex VWR 241259352), Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8 HPLC column, 5 urn, 150 mm length x 4.6 mm internal diameter (Part No 993967-906).<br>
(c)	Procedure<br>
(i) Power to Agilent 1 1 00 series HPLC system turned on.<br>
(ii) Solvent reservoirs topped up, as required.<br>
(iii) Power and nitrogen supply to the Polymer fabs PL ELS-1000 evaporative light<br>
scattering detector turned on.<br>
(iv) Power to HPLC computer turned on.<br>
(v) Software for PL ELS-1000 detector started.<br>
(vi) The method employed had the following settings; evaporator temperature = 85°C,<br>
nebuliser temperaure = 60°C, gas flow rate = 1.0 litres/min, autozero offset = 0, and<br>
time constant = 0. The detector was allowed to stabilize for 20 minutes prior to use.<br>
(vii) Software for HPLC started up.<br>
(viii) Method was set up according to the following parameters; eluent A was water,<br>
eluent B was acetonitrile, gradient was as Table 1 below, flow = 1 .0 ml/min, injection<br>
volume = 20 ul, column temperature = 40°C, and run time = 40 minutes.<br><br>
Table 1. Gradient Time        Water       Acetonitrile (min)<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
(ix) Approximately 50±5 mg of sample was dissolved in 10 ml of isopropyl alcohol.<br>
Gentle heating was used to speed up the dissolution process, if required. If the<br>
sample was still not in solution, a few drops of water were added until the solution<br>
was clear.<br>
(x) Using a clean pasteur pipette, a 2 ml autosampler vial was filled with the solution<br>
and the vial closed using a crimp cap and crimping tool.<br>
(xi) Sample vial was placed in autosampler tray.<br>
(xii) Sample details were entered.<br>
(xiii) Sample was run.<br>
(d) Results<br>
All peaks in the resultant chromatogram were integrated and summed. Peak areas for polyol, and the various ester peaks were then calculated and expressed as a percentage of the total peak areas (polyol and ester component peaks were identified by LC-MS or by LC retention times of standards).<br>
(2) Analysis of C16/C18 Sorbitan Esters bv Reverse Phase HPLC The procedure described in (1) above for sorbitol esters was employed except that (i) an Inertsil ODS-2 HPLC Column, Sum, 250 mm length x 4.6 mm internal diameter (Chrompack Cat. No. 28408) was used, (ii) acetone was used instead of water, and (iii) the gradient was as in Table 2 below.<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br><br>
Stability was assessed by observing the emulsions after storage at ambient temperature (23°C), cold at 5°C or under elevated temperature storage at 40°C and 50°C. Measuring storage stability at 50°C is a very severe test. The composition was stable if no visible separation of the emulsion occurred. The stability of the liquid crystals in the emulsion was also assessed by observing under a microscope using polarized light.<br>
(4) Emulsion Viscosity<br>
Viscosity was measured at 23°C with a Brookfield LVT viscometer using an appropriate spindle (LV1, LV2, LV3, or LV4 - depending on the viscosity of the emulsion being tested) at 6 rpm (0.1 Hz), 1 day after making the emulsions and results are quoted in mPa.s.<br>
