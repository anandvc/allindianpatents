				<td>CONTROLLED RELEASE OF PHENOLIC OPIOIDS<br>
The present application claims the benefit of United States provisional patent<br>
application number 60/809,082 filed on May 26, 2006 and United States provisional patent<br>
application number 60/901,795 filed on February 16, 2007, the contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein in their entirety.<br>
The present invention relates to controlled release of phenolic opioids. More<br>
particularly it relates to a method of providing patients with controlled release of phenolic<br>
opioids using prodrugs having a particular substituent on the phenolic hydrogen atom, to<br>
prodrugs of phenolic opioids and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the prodrugs.<br>
Delivery systems are often essential in safely administering active agents such as<br>
drugs. Often delivery systems can optimize bioavailability, improve dosage consistency and<br>
improve patient compliance (e.g., by reducing dosing frequency). Solutions to drug delivery<br>
and/or bioavailability issues in pharmaceutical development include converting known drugs<br>
to prodrugs. Typically, in a prodrug, a polar functional group (e.g., a carboxylic acid, an<br>
amino group, phenol group, a sulfhydryl group, etc.) of the active agent is masked by a<br>
promoiety, which is labile under physiological conditions. Accordingly, prodrugs are usually<br>
transported through hydrophobic biological barriers such as membranes and may possess<br>
superior physicochemical properties in comparison to the parent drug. Prodrugs are usually<br>
non-toxic and are ideally electively cleaved at the locus of drug action. Preferably, cleavage<br>
of the promoiety occurs rapidly and quantitatively with the formation of non-toxic<br>
by-products (i.e., the hydrolyzed promoiety).<br>
Prodrugs as described above are capable of providing patients with safe and effective<br>
treatment if the patients follow the directions given by the attending physician. Unfortunately<br>
human patients do not always follow the directions that they have been given. They may<br>
accidentally take an overdose of the prodrug, or deliberately abuse it, for example by taking<br>
an overdose, by injecting or inhaling it, or by using readily available household chemicals<br>
(like vinegar or baking soda) to obtain the active drug from the prodrug. Abuse is a particular<br>
concern with prodrugs of opioids, which are properly used for the treatment of pain.<br>
It would be desirable to have a prodrug of an opioid that has built-in control, so that it<br>
is difficult to use the prodrug other than in the way it is intended.<br>
A way has now been found for configuring prodrugs of phenolic opioids that affords<br>
controlled release of the drugs.<br>
Phenolic opioids form a sub-group of the opioids, and include the widely prescribed<br>
drugs hydromorphone, oxymorphone, and morphine.<br>
According to one aspect, the present invention provides a method of providing a<br>
patient with post administration-activated, controlled release of a phenolic opioid, which<br>
comprises administering to said patient a corresponding compound in which the phenolic<br>
hydrogen atom has been substituted with a spacer leaving group bearing a nitrogen<br>
nucleophile that is protected with an enzymatically-cleavable moiety, the configuration of the<br>
spacer leaving group and nitrogen nucleophile being such that, upon enzymatic cleavage of<br>
the cleavable moiety, the nitrogen nucleophile is capable of forming a cyclic urea, carbamate<br>
or thiocarbamate, liberating the compound from the spacer leaving group so as to provide the<br>
patient with controlled release of the phenolic opioid.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides the use in the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for providing a patient with post administration-activated, controlled release of a<br>
phenolic opioid, of a corresponding compound in which the phenolic hydrogen atom has been<br>
substituted with a spacer leaving group bearing a nitrogen nucleophile that is protected with<br>
an enzymatically-cleavable moiety, the configuration of the spacer leaving group and nitrogen<br>
nucleophile being such that, upon enzymatic cleavage of the cleavable moiety, the nitrogen<br>
nucleophile is capable of forming a cyclic urea, carbamate or thiocarbamate, liberating the<br>
compound from the spacer leaving group so as to provide the patient with controlled release<br>
of the phenolic opioid.<br>
The corresponding compound (prodrug in accordance with the present invention)<br>
provides post administration-activated, controlled release of the phenolic opioid, because it<br>
requires enzymatic cleavage to initiate release of the compound, and because the rate of<br>
release of the opioid depends upon both the rate of enzymatic cleavage and the rate of<br>
cyclisation. Accordingly, the prodrug has reduced susceptibility to accidental overdosing or<br>
abuse, whether by deliberate overdosing, administration through an inappropriate route, such<br>
as by injection, or by chemical modification using readily available household chemicals.<br>
The prodrug is configured so that it will not provide excessively high plasma levels of the<br>
active drug if it is administered inappropriately, and cannot readily be decomposed to afford<br>
the active drug other than by enzymatic-cleavage.<br>
The enzyme capable of cleaving the enzymatically-cleavable moiety may be a<br>
peptidase - the enzymatically-cleavable moiety being linked to the nucleophilic nitrogen<br>
through an amide (e.g. a peptide: -NHCO-) bond. In some embodiments, the enzyme is a<br>
digestive enzyme such as, for example, pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, colipase, elastase,<br>
aminopeptidase N, aminopeptidase A, dipeptidylaminopeptidase IV, tripeptidase or<br>
enteropeptidase. Accordingly, in one embodiment of the method, the corresponding<br>
compound is administered orally to the patient.<br>
The enzyme-cleavable moiety linked to the nitrogen nucleophile through an amide<br>
bond may be, for example, a residue of an amino acid or a peptide, or an (alpha) N-acyl<br>
derivative of an amino acid or peptide (for example an N-acyl derivative of a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carboxylic acid, such as an N-acetyl derivative). The peptide<br>
may contain, for example, up to 10 amino acid residues. For example, it may be a dipeptide<br>
or tripeptide. Each amino acid may advantageously be a naturally occurring D or L-amino<br>
acid (such as an L-amino acid). Examples of naturally occurring amino acids are alanine,<br>
arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glycine, glutamine, glutamic acid, histidine,<br>
isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan,<br>
tyrosine, lysine and valine. Accordingly, examples of enzyme-cleavable moieties include<br>
residues of the L-amino acids listed hereinabove and the N-acetyl derivatives thereof, and<br>
dipeptides and tripeptides formed from two or three of the L-amino acids listed hereinabove,<br>
and the N-acetyl derivatives thereof.<br>
The cyclic group formed when the phenolic opioid is released is conveniently<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable, in particular a pharmaceutically acceptable cyclic urea,<br>
carbamate or thiocarbamate. It will be appreciated that cyclic ureas in particular are generally<br>
very stable and have low toxicity.<br>
In one specific example of the invention, the spacer leaving group bearing a<br>
nucleophile that is protected with a cleavable moiety is a group of formula<br>
-C(O)-N(CH3)-(CH2)2-NH(R4) wherein R4 is an enzyme-cleavable moiety linked to the NH<br>
group through an amide bond. When the N-R4 amide bond is cleaved enzymatically, a<br>
nitrogen nucleophile (-NH2) is freed, and this cyclises back onto the carbonyl group, forming<br>
a cyclic urea and releasing the phenolic opioid.<br>
Generally, the spacer group may be any group capable of forming a cyclic urea,<br>
carbamate or thiocarbamate when the phenolic opioid is displaced by the nitrogen<br>
nucleophile. Accordingly, the spacer group may be, for example, a group of formula -C(O)-<br>
Y-L-N-(R3)(R4); in which:-<br>
Y is -NR5-, -O- or -S-;<br>
L is an unsubstituted or substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, carbocyclic or heterocyclic<br>
group, or a combination of two or more such groups linked together by a single bond, a spiro<br>
linkage, a single or double bond or by a C=0, O, S, SO, SO2, CONH, NHCO or NH linkage;<br>
each of R3 and R5 is independently is hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl or<br>
substituted aryl; and<br>
R4 is an enzyme-cleavable moiety linked to the nitrogen of the N(R3) group through<br>
an amide bond.<br>
In one embodiment, R4 is a group of formula<br>
wherein: <br>
each R6 is independently hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl,<br>
arylalkyl, substituted arylalkyl, heteroalkyl, substituted heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, substituted<br>
heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, substituted heteroarylalkyl, or optionally, R6 and R7 together with<br>
the atoms to which they are bonded form a cycloheteroalkyl or substituted cycloheteroalkyl<br>
ring;<br>

substituted alkoxycarbonyl, aryl, substituted aryl, arylalkyl or substituted arylalkyl;<br>
p is an integer from 1 to 5;<br>
each W is independently -NR8-, -O- or -S-; and<br>
each R8 is independently hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl or substituted aryl, or<br>
optionally, each R6 and R8 independently together with the atoms to which they are bonded<br>
form a cycloheteroalkyl or substituted cycloheteroalkyl ring.<br>
It will be appreciated that when W is NH and R7 is H or acyl, then R4 is a residue of<br>
an amino acid or peptide, or an N-acyl derivative thereof. When W is NR8, R7 is H or acyl<br>
and R6 and R8 together with the atoms to which they are bonded form a pyrrolidine ring, then<br>
R4 is a residue of proline or an N-acyl derivative thereof.<br>
Accordingly, in another embodiment, R4 is a residue of a D or L-amino acid (such as<br>
an L-amino acid) selected from alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glycine,<br>
glutamine, glutamic acid, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline,<br>
serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, lysine and valine; a residue of a dipeptide or tripeptide<br>
composed of two or three D or L amino acid residues (such as L-amino acid residues) selected<br>
independently from alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glycine, glutamine,<br>
glutamic acid, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine,<br>
threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, lysine and valine; or a residue of an N-acyl derivative thereof,<br>
such as an N-acetyl derivative.<br>
In one embodiment, L is an unsubstituted or substituted 1,2-phenylene group. For<br>
example, Y-L-NR3 together may form a 1,2-diaminophenylene group which is unsubstituted<br>
or substituted on the phenylene moiety with one or two substituents selected from a halogen<br>
atom, (l-4C)alkyl and (l-4C)alkoxy.<br>
In another embodiment, L is a divalent group of formula<br>
in which:-<br>
n is an integer from 1 to 10; and<br>
each of R1 and R2 is independently hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl or<br>
substituted aryl, or R1 and R2 together with the carbon to which they are attached form a<br>
cycloalkyl or substituted cycloalkyl group, or two R1 or R2 groups on adjacent carbon atoms<br>
may, together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached, form a cycloalkyl or<br>
substituted cycloalkyl group.<br>
Accordingly, in one embodiment, the spacer leaving group bearing a nucleophile that<br>
is protected with a cleavable moiety is of formula -C(O)-Y-(C(R1)(R2))n-N-(R3)(R4); the<br>
spacer leaving group corresponding with the group -C(O)-Y-(C(R1)(R2))n-, the nucleophilic<br>
nitrogen atom that is protected with a cleavable moiety corresponding with the group -N-<br>
(R3)(R4) and the cleavable moiety corresponding with the group R4; in which:<br>
Y is -NR5-, -O- or -S-;<br>
n is an integer from 1 to 10;<br>
each R1, R2, R3 and R5 is independently hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl or<br>
substituted aryl, or R1 and R2 together with the carbon to which they are attached form a<br>
cycloalkyl or substituted cycloalkyl group, or two R1 or R2 groups on adjacent carbon atoms<br>
may, together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached, form a cycloalkyl or<br>
substituted cycloalkyl group;<br><br>
each R6 is independently hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl,<br>
arylalkyl, substituted arylalkyl, heteroalkyl, substituted heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, substituted<br>
heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, substituted heteroarylalkyl, or optionally, R6 and R7 together with<br>
the atoms to which they are bonded form a cycloheteroalkyl or substituted cycloheteroalkyl<br>
ring;<br>
R is hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, acyl, substituted acyl, alkoxycarbonyl,<br>
substituted alkoxycarbonyl, aryl, substituted aryl, arylalkyl or substituted arylalkyl;<br>
p is an integer from 1 to 5;<br>
each W is independently -NR8-, -O- or -S-; and<br>
each R8 is independently hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl or substituted aryl, or<br>
optionally, each R6 and R8 independently together with the atoms to which they are bonded<br>
form a cycloheteroalkyl or substituted cycloheteroalkyl ring.<br>
Thus, if XH represents the phenolic opioid that is released, then the corresponding<br>
compound may be represented by the general formula (I)<br><br>
and the cyclic urea, carbamate or thiocarbamate may be presented by the formula<br><br>
In one embodiment, each of R1, R2, R3 and R5 is independently hydrogen, alkyl,<br>
substituted alkyl, aryl or substituted aryl.<br>
In another embodiment, R6 is a side atom or group of a natural amino acid, such as H<br>
(from glycine), -CH2(CH2)3NH2 (from leucine), -CH2CH2CH2NHC(NH)NH2 (from arginine),<br>
4-hydroxybenzyl (from tyrosine), CH2COOH (from aspartic acid) or CH2CH2COOH (from<br>
glutamic acid).<br>
In another embodiment, R7 is a hydrogen atom, or an unsubstituted of substituted acyl<br>
group, for example (l-6C)alkanoyl, such as acetyl or t-butanoyl; benzoyl unsubstituted or<br>
substituted by methylenedioxy or one or two substituents selected from (l-4C)alkyl, (1-<br>
4C)alkoxy or halogen, such as benzoyl or piperonyl; CONRxRy in which Rx and Ry are each<br>
independently hydrogen or (l-4C)alkyl, such as CONH2), or a hemiacid or hemiester, such as<br>
CH2CH2COOH or CH2CH2COOEt. The unsubstituted of substituted acyl group is<br>
conveniently the residue of a pharmaceutically acceptable carboxylic acid.<br>
Examples of particular values are:-<br>
forY: -NR5;<br>
for R5: (l-4C)alkyl, such as -CH3;<br>
forL: -CH2CH2-<br>
for R1 and R2: hydrogen or (l-4C)alkyl, such as CH3; more particularly hydrogen;<br>
forn: 2 or 3;<br>
for R3: hydrogen or (l-4C)alkyl, such as -CH3;<br>
for W: NH;<br>
for R6: H, -CH2(CH2)3NH2, -CH2CH2CH2NHC(NH)NH2, 4-hydroxybenzyl, CH2COOH or<br>
CH2CH2COOH;<br>
for R7: hydrogen, (l-6C)alkanoyl, such as acetyl or t-butanoyl, or optionally substituted<br>
benzoyl, for example benzoyl unsubstituted or substituted by methylenedioxy or one or two<br>
substituents selected from (l-4C)alkyl, (l-4C)alkoxy or halogen, such as benzoyl or<br>
piperonyl; in particular hydrogen or acetyl;<br>
for a cycloheteroalkyl or substituted cycloheteroalkyl ring formed by R6 and R8 together with<br>
the atoms to which they are bonded: pyrrolidinyl;<br>
for p: 1 or 2;<br>
for R4: arginine, N-acetylarginine, N-t-butanoylarginine, N-benzoylarginine, N-<br>
piperonylarginine, N-glycinylarginine, lysine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, tyrosine, proline<br>
and N-glycinylproline.<br>
Generally the corresponding compound (the prodrug in accordance with the invention)<br>
is administered orally. However, in certain embodiments it is envisaged that it could be<br>
administered by another route.<br>
Each corresponding compound may have a different release profile, the rate of release<br>
of the phenolic opioid depending upon the rate at which the cleavable moiety is cleaved, and<br>
the rate in which the nitrogen nucleophile can undergo an intramolecular cyclization - release<br>
reaction thus displacing the phenolic opioid. Accordingly, one embodiment of the method<br>
comprises administering a plurality of corresponding compounds to the patient, each<br>
corresponding compound having a different spacer leaving group and/or a different cleavable<br>
moiety so as to provide the patient with a different controlled release of the phenolic opioid.<br>
Specific examples of phenolic opioids include oxymorphone, hydromorphone,<br>
morphine and derivatives thereof. Particular mention is made of oxymorphone,<br>
hydromorphone and morphine. Other examples of phenolic opioids are buprenorphine,<br>
dihydroetorphine, diprenorphine, etorphine and levorphanol.<br>
The prodrugs may be administered alone or may be co-administered with one or more<br>
other active agents. In one embodiment, they may be co-administered with a peripheral<br>
opioid antagonist, such as (R)-N-methylnaltrexone (N-MTX), or a pro-drug thereof. It will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art that (R)-N-methylnaltrexone antagonizes the actions of<br>
opioids such as hydromorphone, oxymorphone and morphine, but is incapable of crossing the<br>
blood brain barrier. It therefore antagonizes only their peripheral actions, which are<br>
undesirable, not their actions on the central nervous system, such as pain relief, which are<br>
desirable. In one embodiment, the pro-drug of (R)-N-methylnaltrexone is a compound of<br>
formula (I) in which X represents the phenolic residue of (R)-N-methylnaltrexone, Y, R1, R ,<br>
n, R3 have any of the meanings given hereinabove, and R4 is hydrogen or has any of the<br>
meanings given hereinabove. Such a pro-drug may be administered orally. Compounds in<br>
which R4 has any of the meanings given above desirably release (R)-N-methylnaltrexone in<br>
the way that the pro-drug of the opioid releases the opioid it is being used to antagonize.<br>
Such compounds may be formulated for co-administration with a pro-drug of an opioid<br>
according to the present invention, for example in a pharmaceutical composition comprising<br>
both compounds and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. It will be appreciated that the<br>
parent drug, (R)-N-methylnaltrexone has poor oral bioavailability, and generally needs to be<br>
administered parenterally. Thus, the pro-drugs of (R)-N-methylnaltrexone in accordance with<br>
the present invention are useful whenever oral (R)-N-methylnaltrexone therapy is desired.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a prodrug of oxymorphone,<br>
hydromorphone or morphine that is capable of providing post administration-activated<br>
controlled release of oxymorphone, hydromorphone or morphine. Accordingly, the present<br>
invention provides a compound of structural Formula (I):<br><br>
or a salt, hydrate or solvate thereof wherein:<br>
X is oxymorphone, hydromorphone or morphine, wherein the hydrogen atom of the<br>
phenolic hydroxyl group is replaced by a covalent bond to -C(O)-Y-(C(R1)(R2)m-N-(R3)(R4);<br>
Y is-NR5-,-0-or-S-;<br>
n is an integer from 1 to 4;<br>
each R1, R2, R3 and R5 is independently hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl or<br>
substituted aryl, or R1 and R2 together with the carbon to which they are attached form a<br>
cycloalkyl or substituted cycloalkyl group, or two R1 or R2 groups on adjacent carbon atoms<br>
may, together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached, form a cycloalkyl or<br>
substituted cycloalkyl group;<br><br>
each R6 is independently hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl,<br>
arylalkyl, substituted arylalkyl, heteroalkyl, substituted heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, substituted<br>
heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, substituted heteroarylalkyl, or optionally, R6 and R7 together with<br>
the atoms to which they are bonded form a cycloheteroalkyl or substituted cycloheteroalkyl<br>
ring;<br>
R7 is hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, acyl, substituted acyl, alkoxycarbonyl,<br>
substituted alkoxycarbonyl, aryl, substituted aryl, arylalkyl or substituted arylalkyl;<br>
p is an integer from 1 to 10;<br>
each W is independently -NR8-, -O- or -S-; and<br><br>
each R8 is independently hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl or substituted aryl, or<br>
optionally, each R6 and R8 independently together with the atoms to which they are bonded<br>
form a cycloheteroalkyl or substituted cycloheteroalkyl ring.<br>
For example, when X is a residue of hydromorphone, the compound of formula (I) has<br>
the structure <br>
In one embodiment, X is hydromorphone or oxymorphone. In another embodiment, X<br>
is morphine.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a compound of formula I<br><br>
or a salt, hydrate or solvate thereof wherein:<br>
X is (R)-N-methylnaltrexone, wherein the hydrogen atom of the phenolic hydroxyl<br>
group is replaced by a covalent bond to -C(O)-Y-(C(R1)(R2))„-N-(R3)(R4); and Y, R1, R2, n,<br>
R3 and R4 have any of the meanings given hereinabove.<br>
In another aspect, pharmaceutical compositions are provided which generally<br>
comprise one or more compounds of Formula (I), salts, hydrates or solvates thereof and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as a diluent, carrier, excipient or adjuvant. The<br>
choice of diluent, carrier, excipient and adjuvant will depend upon, among other factors, the<br>
desired mode of administration.<br>
In still another aspect, methods for treating or preventing various diseases or disorders<br>
are provided. The methods generally involve administering to a patient in need of such<br>
treatment or prevention a therapeutically effective amount of a compound Formula (I) and/or<br>
a pharmaceutical composition thereof.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows the plasma concentration time course of the production of N-MTX<br>
following oral (PO) dosing in rats.<br>
Figure 2 shows the plasma concentration time course of the production of<br>

As used herein, the term "alkyl" by itself or as part of another substituent refers to a<br>
saturated branched or straight-chain monovalent hydrocarbon radical derived by the removal<br>
of one hydrogen atom from a single carbon atom of a parent alkane. Typical alkyl groups<br>
include, but are not limited to, methyl; ethyl, propyls such as propan-1-yl or propan-2-yl; and<br>
butyls such as butan-1-yl, butan-2-yl, 2-methyl-propan-l-yl or 2-methyl-propan-2-yl.<br>

Selection of appropriate protecting groups, reagents and reaction conditions for any of<br>
the steps in the above Schemes is well within the ambit of those of skilled in the art. Other<br>
methods for synthesis of the prodrugs described herein will be readily apparent to the skilled<br>
artisan and may be used to synthesize the compounds described herein. Accordingly, the<br>
methods presented in the Schemes herein are illustrative rather than comprehensive.<br>
The invention further provides all the novel intermediates described herein.<br>
In general, the prodrugs disclosed herein may be used to treat and/or prevent the same<br>
disease(s) and/or conditions as the parent drug which are well known in the art (see, e.g.,<br>
Physicians Desk Reference, 2000 54th Edition and the Merck Index, 13th Edition). Phenolic<br>
opioids are useful in the treatment of pain.<br>
For example, a prodrug of a phenolic opioid such as hydromorphone could be used,<br>
inter alia, to treat or prevent pain including, but not limited to include, acute pain, chronic<br>
pain, neuropathic pain, acute traumatic pain, arthritic pain, osteoarthritic pain, rheumatoid<br>
arthritic pain, muscular skeletal pain, post-dental surgical pain, dental pain, myofascial pain,<br>
cancer pain, visceral pain, diabetic pain, muscular pain, post-herpetic neuralgic pain, chronic<br>
pelvic pain, endometriosis pain, pelvic inflammatory pain and child birth related pain. Acute<br>
pain includes, but is not limited to, acute traumatic pain or post-surgical pain. Chronic pain<br>
includes, but is not limited to, neuropathic pain, arthritic pain, osteoarthritic pain, rheumatoid<br>
arthritic pain, muscular skeletal pain, dental pain, myofascial pain, cancer pain, diabetic pain,<br>
visceral pain, muscular pain, post-herpetic neuralgic pain, chronic pelvic pain, endometriosis<br>
pain, pelvic inflammatory pain and back pain.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein comprise a prodrug disclosed<br>
herein with a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, so as to provide a<br>
form for proper administration to a subject.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical vehicles include excipients such as starch, glucose, lactose,<br>
sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate,<br>
talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the<br>
like. The present pharmaceutical compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of<br>
wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing,<br>
thickening, lubricating and coloring agents may be used.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions may be manufactured by means of conventional mixing,<br>
dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or<br>
lyophilizing processes. Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in a conventional<br>
manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers, diluents, excipients or<br>
auxiliaries, which facilitate processing of compositions and compounds disclosed herein into<br>
preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the<br>
route of administration chosen.<br>
The present pharmaceutical compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions,<br>
emulsion, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders,<br>
sustained-release formulations, suppositories, emulsions, aerosols, sprays, suspensions or any<br>
other form suitable for use known to the skilled artisan. In some embodiments, the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle is a capsule (see e.g., Grosswald et al, United States<br>
Patent No. 5,698,155). Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical vehicles have been<br>
described in the art (see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Philadelphia College of<br>
Pharmacy and Science, 19th Edition, 1995).<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for oral delivery may be in the form of tablets, lozenges,<br>
aqueous or oily suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, capsules, syrups, slurries,<br>
suspensions or elixirs, for example. Orally administered compositions may contain one or<br>
more optional agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or<br>
saccharin, flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry coloring agents<br>
and preserving agents, to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, when<br>
in tablet or pill form, the compositions may be coated to delay disintegration and absorption<br>
in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of<br>
time. Oral compositions can include standard vehicles such as mannitol, lactose, starch,<br>
magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, sucrose, sorbitol,<br>
maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl<br>
cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), granulating agents, binding agents and disintegrating agents<br>
such as the cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as<br>
sodium alginate etc.<br>
In some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions are in the form of lozenges or<br>
lollipops where dissolution and release of the active ingredients occurs in the oral cavity,<br>
generally through the oral mucosa. For these embodiments, buffering agents may also be<br>
used to provide an optimum environment for delivery of the agents or compositions.<br>
Additional components may include, for example, sweeteners, binders, diluents,<br>
disintegrating agents, lubricating agents, etc.<br>
In still other embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is a dissolving sublingual<br>
tablet, where dissolution and release of the active ingredients occurs under the tongue, and the<br>
compositions and/or compounds disclosed herein are absorbed through the oral mucosa. In<br>
these embodiments, buffering agents may also be used to provide an optimum environment<br>
for delivery of each of the agents. Additional components may include, for example,<br>
sweeteners, binders, diluents, disintegrating agents, etc.<br>
The methods that involve oral administration of compounds disclosed herein of can<br>
also be practiced with a number of different dosage forms, which provide sustained release.<br>
In some embodiments, the dosage form is comprised of beads that on dissolution or<br>
diffusion release compositions and/or compounds disclosed herein over an extended period of<br>
hours, preferably, over a period of at least 6 hours, more preferably, over a period of at least 8<br>
hours and even more preferably, over a period of at least 12 hours and most preferably, over a<br>
period of at least 24 hours. The beads may have a central composition or core comprising<br>
compounds disclosed herein and pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles, including optional<br>
lubricants, antioxidants and buffers. The beads may be medical preparations with a diameter<br>
of about 1 to about 2 mm. Individual beads may comprise doses of the compounds disclosed<br>
herein. The beads, in some embodiments, are formed of non-cross-linked materials to<br>
enhance their discharge from the gastrointestinal tract. The beads may be coated with a<br>
release rate-controlling polymer that gives a timed-release profile.<br>
The time-release beads may be manufactured into a tablet for therapeutically effective<br>
administration. The beads can be made into matrix tablets by direct compression of a<br>
plurality of beads coated with, for example, an acrylic resin and blended with excipients such<br>
as hydroxypropyhnethyl cellulose. The manufacture of beads has been disclosed in the art<br>
(Lu, Int. J. Pharm. 1994, 112, 117-124; Pharmaceutical Sciences by Remington, 14th ed, pp<br>
1626-1628 (1970); Fincher, J. Pharm. Sci. 1968, 57,1825-1835; Benedikt, United States<br>
Patent No. 4,083,949) as has the manufacture of tablets (Pharmaceutical Sciences, by<br>
Remington, 17th Ed, Ch. 90, pp 1603-1625 (1985).<br>
In other embodiments, an oral sustained release pump may be used (Langer, supra;<br>
Sefton, 1987, CRC Crit Ref Biomed. Eng. 14:201; Saudek etal, 1989, N. Engl J Med.<br>
321:574).<br>
In still other embodiments, polymeric materials can be used (See "Medical<br>
Applications of Controlled Release," Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Press., Boca Raton,<br>
Florida (1974); "Controlled Drug Bioavailability," Drug Product Design and Performance,<br>
Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Langer et at, 1983, JMacromol. Sci. Rev.<br>
Macromol Chem. 23:61; Levy et al, 1985, Science 228: 190; During et al., 1989, Ann.<br>
Neurol. 25:351; Howard et al., 1989, J. Neurosurg. 71:105). In some embodiments,<br>
polymeric materials are used for oral sustained release delivery. Such polymers include, for<br>
example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and hydroxyethylcellulose (most preferred,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose). Other cellulose ethers have been described (Alderman, Int.<br>
J. Pharm. Tech. &amp; Prod. Mfr. 1984, 5(3) 1-9). Factors affecting drug release are well known<br>
to the skilled artisan and have been described in the art (Bamba et al, Int. J. Pharm. 1979, 2,<br>
307).<br>
In still other embodiments, enteric-coated preparations can be used for oral sustained<br>
release administration. Coating materials include, for example, polymers with a<br>
pH-dependent solubility {i.e., pH-controlled release), polymers with a slow or pH-dependent<br>
rate of swelling, dissolution or erosion (i.e., time-controlled release), polymers that are<br>
degraded by enzymes {i.e., enzyme-controlled release) and polymers that form firm layers<br>
that are destroyed by an increase in pressure {i.e., pressure-controlled release).<br>
In yet other embodiments, drug-releasing lipid matrices can be used for oral sustained<br>
release administration. For example, solid microparticles of compositions and/or compounds<br>
disclosed herein may be coated with a thin controlled release layer of a lipid {e.g., glyceryl<br>
behenate and/or glyceryl palmitostearate) as disclosed in Farah et al, United States Patent No.<br>
6,375,987 and Joachim et al, United States Patent No. 6,379,700. The lipid-coated particles<br>
can optionally be compressed to form a tablet Another controlled release lipid-based matrix<br>
material which is suitable for sustained release oral administration comprises polyglycolized<br>
glycerides as disclosed in Roussin et al, United States Patent No. 6,171,615.<br>
In yet other embodiments, waxes can be used for oral sustained release administration.<br>
Examples of suitable sustained releasing waxes are disclosed in Cain et al, United States<br>
Patent No. 3,402,240 (carnauba wax, candedilla wax, esparto wax and ouricury wax);<br>
Shtohryn et al, United States Patent No. 4,820,523 (hydrogenated vegetable oil, bees wax,<br>
caranuba wax, paraffin, candelillia, ozokerite and mixtures thereof); and Walters, United<br>
States Patent No. 4,421,736 (mixture of paraffin and castor wax).<br>
In still other embodiments, osmotic delivery systems are used for oral sustained<br>
release administration (Verma et al, Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm. 2000,26:695-708). In some<br>
embodiments, OROS® systems made by Alza Corporation, Mountain View, CA are used for<br>
oral sustained release delivery devices (Theeuwes et al, United States Patent No. 3,845,770;<br>
Theeuwes et al, United States Patent No. 3,916,899).<br>
In yet other embodiments, a controlled-release system can be placed in proximity of<br>
the target of the compositions and/or compounds disclosed herein thus requiring only a<br>
fraction of the systemic dose (See, e.g., Goodson, in "Medical Applications of Controlled<br>
Release," supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)). Other controlled-release systems are discussed<br>
in Langer, 1990, Science 249:1527-1533 may also be used.<br>
In still other embodiments, the dosage form comprises compounds disclosed herein<br>
coated on a polymer substrate. The polymer can be an erodible or a nonerodible polymer. The<br>
coated substrate may be folded onto itself to provide a bilayer polymer drug dosage form. For example, compounds disclosed herein can be coated onto a polymer such as a polypeptide,<br>
collagen, gelatin, polyvinyl alcohol, polyorthoester, polyacetyl, or apolyorthocarbonate and the<br>
coated polymer folded onto itself to provide a bilaminated dosage form. In operation, the<br>
bioerodible dosage form erodes at a controlled rate to dispense the compounds over a<br>
sustained release period. Representative biodegradable polymers comprise a member selected from the group consisting of biodegradable poly(amides), poly (amino acids), poly(esters),<br>
poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), poly(carbohydrate), poly(orthoester), poly<br>
(orthocarbonate), poly(acetyl), poly(anhydrides), biodegradable poly(dihydropyrans), and<br>
poly(dioxinones) which are known in the art (Rosoff, Controlled Release of Drugs, Chap. 2,<br>
pp. 53-95 (1989); Heller et al., United States Patent No. 3,811,444; Michaels, United States<br>
Patent No. 3,962,414; Capozza, United States Patent No. 4,066,747; Schmitt, United States<br>
Patent No. 4,070,347; Choi et al, United States Patent No. 4,079,038; Choi et al, United<br>
States Patent No. 4,093,709).<br>
In other embodiments, the dosage form comprises compounds disclosed herein loaded<br>
into a polymer that releases the drug(s) by diffusion through a polymer, or by flux through<br>
pores or by rupture of a polymer matrix. The drug delivery polymeric dosage form comprises<br>
a concentration of 10 mg to 2500 mg homogenously contained in or on a polymer. The<br>
dosage form comprises at least one exposed surface at the beginning of dose delivery. The<br>
non-exposed surface, when present, is coated with a pharmaceutically acceptable material<br>
impermeable to the passage of the drug(s). The dosage form may be manufactured by<br>
procedures known in the art. An example of providing a dosage form comprises blending a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier like polyethylene glycol, with a known dose of<br>
compositions and/or compounds disclosed herein at an elevated temperature, (e.g., 37 °C),<br>
and adding it to a silastic medical grade elastomer with a cross-linking agent, for example,<br>
octanoate, followed by casting in a mold. The step is repeated for each optional successive<br>
layer. The system is allowed to set for about 1 hour, to provide the dosage form.<br>
Representative polymers for manufacturing the dosage form comprise a member selected<br>
from the group consisting of olefin, and vinyl polymers, addition polymers, condensation<br>
polymers, carbohydrate polymers, and silicone polymers as represented by polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene, polyvinyl acetate, polymethylacrylate, polyisobutylmethacrylate, poly<br>
alginate, polyamide and polysilicone. The polymers and procedures for manufacturing them<br>
have been described in the art (Coleman et al., Polymers 1990, 31,1187-1231; Roerdink et<br>

In other embodiments, the dosage form comprises an osmotic dosage form, which<br>
comprises a semipermeable wall that surrounds a therapeutic composition comprising<br>
compounds disclosed herein. In use within a subject, the osmotic dosage form comprising a<br>
homogenous composition, imbibes fluid through the semipermeable wall into the dosage form<br>
in response to the concentration gradient across the semipermeable wall. The therapeutic<br>
composition in the dosage form develops osmotic pressure differential that causes the<br>
therapeutic composition to be administered through an exit from the dosage form over a<br>
prolonged period of time up to 24 hours (or even in some cases up to 30 hours) to provide<br>
controlled and sustained release. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero<br>
order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations.<br>
In other embodiments, the dosage form comprises another osmotic dosage form<br>
comprising a wall surrounding a compartment, the wall comprising a semipermeable<br>
polymeric composition permeable to the passage of fluid and substantially impermeable to the<br>
passage of compounds disclosed herein present in the compartment, a drug-containing layer<br>
composition in the compartment, a hydrogel push layer composition in the compartment<br>
comprising an osmotic formulation for imbibing and absorbing fluid for expanding in size for<br>
pushing the drug composition layer from the dosage form, and at least one passageway in the<br>
wall for releasing the composition. The method delivers compounds disclosed herein by<br>
imbibing fluid through the semipermeable wall at a fluid imbibing rate determined by the<br>
permeability of the semipermeable wall and the osmotic pressure across the semipermeable<br>
wall causing the push layer to expand, thereby delivering the compounds disclosed herein<br>
from the dosage form through the exit passageway to a subject over a prolonged period of<br>
time (up to 24 or even 30 hours). The hydrogel layer composition may comprise 10 mg to<br>
1000 mg of a hydrogel such as a member selected from the group consisting of a polyalkylene<br>
oxide of 1,000,000 to 8,000,000 weight-average molecular weight which are selected from the<br>
group consisting of a polyethylene oxide of 1,000,000 weight-average molecular weight, a polyethylene oxide of 2,000,000 molecular weight, a polyethylene oxide of 4,000,000<br>
molecular weight, a polyethylene oxide of 5,000,000 molecular weight, a polyethylene oxide<br>
of 7,000,000 molecular weight and a polypropylene oxide of the 1,000,000 to 8,000,000<br>
weight-average molecular weight; or 10 mg to 1000 mg of an alkali carboxymethylcellulose of<br>
10,000 to 6,000,000 weight average molecular weight, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose<br>
or potassium carboxymethylcellulose. The hydrogel expansion layer comprises 0.0 mg to 350<br>
mg, in present manufacture; 0.1 mg to 250 mg of a hydroxyalkylcellulose of 7,500 to 4,500,00<br>

hydroxypentylcellulose) in present manufacture; 1 mg to 50 mg of an osmagent selected<br>
from the group consisting of sodium chloride, potassium chloride, potassium acid<br>
phosphate, tartaric acid, citric acid, raffinose, magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, urea,<br>
inositol, sucrose, glucose and sorbitol; 0 to 5 mg of a colorant, such as ferric oxide; 0 mg to 30<br>
mg, in a present manufacture, 0.1 mg to 30 mg of a hydroxypropylalkylcellulose of 9,000 to<br>
225,000 average-number molecular weight, selected from the group consisting of<br>
hydroxypropylethylcellulose, hydroxypropypentylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and hydropropylbutylcellulose; 0.00 to 1.5 mg of an<br>
antioxidant selected from the group consisting of ascorbic acid, butylated hydroxyanisole,<br>

acids, salts of aromatic acids, stearic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, a mixture of a salt of a<br>
fatty, alicyclic or aromatic acid and a fatty, alicyclic or aromatic acid.<br>
In the osmotic dosage forms, the semipermeable wall comprises a composition that is<br>
permeable to the passage of fluid and impermeable to the passage of compounds disclosed<br>
herein. The wall is non-toxic and comprises a polymer selected from the group consisting of a<br>
cellulose acylate, cellulose diacylate, cellulose triacylate, cellulose acetate, cellulose diacetate<br>
and cellulose triacetate. The wall comprises 75 wt % (weight percent) to 100 wt % of the<br>
cellulosic wall-forming polymer; or, the wall can comprise additionally 0.01 wt % to 80 wt %<br>
of polyethylene glycol, or 1 wt % to 25 wt % of a cellulose ether selected from the group<br>
consisting of hydroxypropylcellulose or a hydroxypropylalkylcellulose such as<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. The total weight percent of all components comprising the<br>
wall is equal to 100 wt %. The internal compartment comprises the drug-containing<br>
composition alone or in layered position with an expandable hydrogel composition. The<br>
expandable hydrogel composition in the compartment increases in dimension by imbibing the<br>
fluid through the semipermeable wall, causing the hydrogel to expand and occupy space in<br>
the compartment, whereby the drug composition is pushed from the dosage form. The<br>
therapeutic layer and the expandable layer act together during the operation of the dosage<br>
form for the release of compounds disclosed herein to a subject over time. The dosage form<br>
comprises a passageway in the wall that connects the exterior of the dosage form with the<br>
internal compartment The osmotic powered dosage form can be made to deliver drug from<br>
the dosage form to the subject at a zero order rate of release over a period of up to about 24<br>
hours.<br>
The expression "passageway" as used herein comprises means and methods suitable<br>
for the metered release of the compounds disclosed herein from the compartment of the<br>
dosage form. The exit means comprises at least one passageway, including orifice, bore,<br>
aperture, pore, porous element, hollow fiber, capillary tube, channel, porous overlay, or<br>
porous element that provides for the osmotic controlled release of the compounds disclosed<br>
herein. The passageway includes a material that erodes or is leached from the wall in a<br>
fluid environment of use to produce at least one controlled-release dimensioned<br>
passageway. Representative materials suitable for forming a passageway, or a multiplicity<br>
of passageways comprise a leachable poly(glycolic) acid or poly(lactic) acid polymer in the<br>
wall, a gelatinous filament, poly(vinyl alcohol), leach-able polysaccharides, salts, and<br>
oxides. A pore passageway, or more than one pore passageway, can be formed by<br>
leaching a leachable compound, such as sorbitol, from the wall. The passageway<br>
possesses controlled-release dimensions, such as round, triangular, square and elliptical, for<br>
the metered release of compositions and/or drugs from the dosage form. The dosage form<br>
can be constructed with one or more passageways in spaced apart relationship on a single<br>
surface or on more than one surface of the wall. The expression "fluid environment"<br>
denotes an aqueous or biological fluid as in a human patient, including the gastrointestinal<br>
tract. Passageways and equipment for forming passageways are disclosed in Theeuwes et al,<br>

a phospholipid (e.g., egg phospholipids, soybean phospholipids or soybean lecithin) and<br>
water. It will be appreciated that other ingredients may be added, for example glycerol or<br>
glucose, to adjust the tonicity of the emulsion. Suitable emulsions will typically contain up to<br>
20% oil, for example, between 5 and 20%. In some embodiments, EDTA is added as a<br>
preservative.<br>
In addition to the formulations described previously, compounds disclosed herein may<br>
also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be<br>
administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by<br>
intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, compounds disclosed herein may be formulated<br>
with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example, as an emulsion in an<br>
acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a<br>
sparingly soluble salt.<br>
When used to treat and/or prevent diseases the compounds disclosed herein and/or<br>
pharmaceutical compositions thereof may be administered alone or in combination with other<br>
pharmaceutical agents including compounds disclosed herein and/or pharmaceutical<br>
compositions thereof. The compounds disclosed herein may be administered or applied per<br>
se or as pharmaceutical compositions. The specific pharmaceutical composition depends on<br>
the desired mode of administration, as is well known to the skilled artisan.<br>
Compounds disclosed herein and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof may be<br>
administered to a subject by intravenous bolus injection, continuous intravenous infusion, oral<br>
tablet, oral capsule, oral solution, intramuscular injection, subcutaneous injection, transdermal<br>
absorption, buccal absorption, intranasal absorption, inhalation, sublingual, intracerebrally,<br>
intravaginally, rectally, topically, particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin or any other<br>
convenient method known to those of skill in the art. In some embodiments, compounds<br>
disclosed herein and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof are delivered via sustained<br>
release dosage forms, including oral sustained release dosage forms. Administration can be<br>
systemic or local. Various delivery systems are known, (e.g., encapsulation in liposomes,<br>
microparticles, microcapsules, capsules, "patient controlled analgesia" drug delivery systems,<br>
etc.) that can be used to deliver compounds disclosed herein and/or pharmaceutical<br>
compositions thereof.<br>
Compounds disclosed herein and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof may also be<br>
administered directly to the lung by inhalation. For administration by inhalation, the<br>
compounds disclosed herein and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof may be conveniently<br>
delivered to the lung by a number of different devices. For example, a Metered Dose Inhaler<br>
("MDI") which utilizes canisters that contain a suitable low boiling propellant, e.g.,<br>
dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromemane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide<br>
or other suitable gas may be used to deliver the compounds disclosed herein and/or<br>
pharmaceutical compositions thereof.<br>
Alternatively, a Dry Powder Inhaler ("DPI") device may be used to administer<br>
compounds disclosed herein and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof (See, e.g., Raleigh et<br>
ah, Proc. Amer. Assoc. Cancer Research Annual Meeting, 1999, 40, 397). DPI devices<br>
typically use a mechanism such as a burst of gas to create a cloud of dry powder inside a<br>
container, which may then be inhaled by the patient. A popular variation is the multiple dose<br>
DPI ("MDDPI") system, which allows for the delivery of more than one therapeutic dose.<br>
For example, capsules and cartridges of gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be<br>
formulated containing a powder mix of the compositions and/or compounds disclosed herein<br>
and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch for these systems.<br>
Another type of device that may be used to deliver the compounds disclosed herein<br>
and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof is a liquid spray device supplied, for example, by<br>
Aradigm Corporation, Hayward, CA. Liquid spray systems use extremely small nozzle holes<br>
to aerosolize liquid drug formulations that may then be directly inhaled.<br>
In some embodiments, a nebulizer device is used to deliver compounds and/or<br>
pharmaceutical compositions thereof disclosed herein. Nebulizers create aerosols from liquid<br>
drug formulations by using, for example, ultrasonic energy to form fine particles that may be<br>
readily inhaled (e.g., Verschoyle et al, British J. Cancer, 1999, 80, Suppl. 2, 96; Armer et al,<br>
United States Patent No. 5,954,047; van der Linden et al, United States Patent No.<br>
5,950,619; van der Linden et al, United States Patent No. 5,970,974).<br>
In still other embodiments, an electrohydrodynamic ("EHD") aerosol device is used to<br>
deliver the compounds disclosed herein and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof. EHD<br>
aerosol devices use electrical energy to aerosolize liquid drug solutions or suspensions (see<br>
e.g., Noakes et al, United States Patent No. 4,765,539; Coffee, United States Patent No.<br>
4,962,885; Coffee, International Publication No. WO 94/12285; Coffee, International<br>
Publication No. WO 94/14543; Coffee, International Publication No. WO 95/26234; Coffee,<br>
International Publication No. WO 95/26235; Coffee, International Publication No. WO<br>
95/32807). Other methods of intra-pulmonary delivery of a compound disclosed herein<br>
and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof are known to the skilled artisan and are within the<br>
scope of the present disclosure.<br>
Transdermal devices can also be used to deliver the compounds disclosed herein<br>
and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof. In some embodiments, the transdermal device is<br>
a matrix type transdermal device (Miller et al, International Publication No. WO<br>
2004/041324). In other embodiments, the transdermal device is a multi-laminate transdermal<br>
device (Miller, United States Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0037059).<br>
The amount of compounds disclosed herein and/or pharmaceutical compositions<br>
thereof that will be effective in the treatment or prevention of diseases in a patient will depend<br>
on the specific nature of the condition and can be determined by standard clinical techniques<br>
known in the art. The amount of compounds disclosed herein and/or pharmaceutical<br>
compositions thereof administered will, of course, be dependent on, among other factors, the<br>
subject being treated, the weight of the subject, the severity of the affliction, the manner of<br>
administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician.<br>
In certain embodiments, compounds disclosed herein and/or pharmaceutical<br>
compositions thereof can be used in combination therapy with at least one other therapeutic<br>
agent. The compounds disclosed herein and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof and the<br>
therapeutic agent can act additively or, more preferably, synergistically. In some<br>
embodiments, compounds disclosed herein and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof are<br>
administered concurrently with the administration of another therapeutic agent. For example,<br>
compounds disclosed herein and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof may be administered<br>
together with another therapeutic agent (e.g. including, but not limited to, peripheral opioid<br>
antagonists, laxatives, non-opioid analgesics and the like). In other embodiments, compounds<br>
disclosed herein and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof are administered prior or<br>
subsequent to administration of other therapeutic agents.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising a compound of Formula (I), or a salt, hydrate of solvate thereof, in which X is<br>
(R)-N-methylnaltrexone and a compound of Formula (I), or a salt, hydrate of solvate thereof,<br>
in which X is a phenolic opioid, such as oxymorphone, hydromorphone or morphine, and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many modifications, both to materials<br>
and methods, may be practiced without departing from the scope of this disclosure.<br>

Protocols for Evaluating Test Compounds<br>
la. "Kitchen" Test<br>
The stability of a test compound in the presence of the readily available household chemicals,<br>
acetic acid (vinegar) and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) may be demonstrated in the<br>
following "Kitchen" Test.<br>
0.5 mg of a test compound is dissolved in 1 ml of each of the following solutions<br>
corresponding with possible household chemicals: 30% aqueous acetic acid; 50% aqueous<br>
ethanol and saturated aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). Each solution is<br>
kept at room temperature for 20-24 hours and then heated at 85°C for 20-24 hours.<br>
Hydromorphone release and general stability are monitored by analytical HPLC. A compound<br>
is considered as having passed this test if after 20 hours the hydromorphone concentration<br>
does not exceed 10% of the starting material or other product of degradation.<br>
The compounds exemplified herein have passed this test.<br>
lb. Demonstration of the controlled release of parent drug from "activated" prodrugs.<br>
IN VITRO DEMONSTRATION<br>
The controlled release of parent drug (e.g. hydromorphone) from the prodrug was<br>
demonstrated by the synthesis, and in vitro testing of several compounds depicted in Table 1.<br>
Compounds A, and C are examples of "activated" prodrugs whereby the enzyme-cleavable<br>
activating group has been omitted to enable specific evaluation of the kinetics attending the<br>
intramolecular cyclization-release sequence. As previously described, the intramolecular<br>
cyclization-release sequence results in the concomitant formation of a cyclic urea with the<br>
release of the parent drug.<br>
These release kinetics of these compounds were evaluated in aqueous solutions at increasing<br>
pH. The liberation of hydromorphone during the course of these reactions was confirmed by<br>
LC-MS analysis. Compound D is an interesting example of a molecule that bears a<br>
nucleophilic nitrogen atom, yet it is rendered incapable of undergoing the intramolecular<br>
cyclization-release reaction due to the conformational restrictions imposed by the cyclic<br>
piperazine ring (i.e it cannot adopt the conformation required for the nucleophilic addition of<br>
the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen into the carbonyl carbon of the carbamate moiety). A<br>
further example of the structural features required for the intramolecular cyclization-release<br>
reaction is provided by compound B representing a molecule is in its "unactivated" form (i.e.<br>
the lone pair of electrons on the now acylated nitrogen atom are unavailable for nucleophilic<br>
attack on the carbamate). It is interesting to note that the intramolecular cyclization-release<br>
reactions can be suppressed at low pH by deactivation of the nucleophilic nitrogen atom via<br>
protonation.<br>
These data confirm the functional roles of the spacer and the "activated" nucleophilic<br>
nitrogen in the intramolecular cyclization-release of the parent drug molecule.<br>
Table 1. The liberation of hydromorphone from prodrug in aqueous solutions.<br>
IN VIVO DEMONSTRATION<br>
In order to investigate the formation of parent drug form prodrug in vivo, compounds<br>
depicted in Table 2 were synthesized and administered intravenously to rats. Subsequent to<br>
dosing, plasma levels of hydromorphone were measured as described in the experimental<br>
section. Compounds A, and B are examples of "activated" prodrugs whereby the enzyme-<br>
cleavable activating group has been omitted to enable specific evaluation of the kinetics<br>
attending the intramolecular cyclization-release sequence As previously described, the<br>
intramolecular cyclization-release sequence results in the concomitant formation of a cyclic<br>
urea with the release of the parent drug.<br>
When these drugs are administered to rats, hydromorphone is liberated. Compound C is an<br>
interesting example of a molecule that bears a nucleophilic nitrogen atom, yet it is rendered<br>
incapable of undergoing the intramolecular cyclization-release reaction due to the<br>
conformational restrictions imposed by the cyclic piperazine ring (i.e it cannot adopt the<br>
conformation required for the nucleophilic addition of the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen<br>
into the carbonyl carbon of the carbamate moiety). When this compound is administered to<br>
rats, no hydromorphone is detected. Compound D is an example of a prodrug whereby the<br>
enzyme-cleavable protecting group has been attached to a piperazine nitrogen. This molecule<br>
was studied to assess the possibility of a direct enzyme-mediated hydrolysis of the carbamate<br>
moiety. The data indicates that this process does not occur in vivo. Interestingly, when<br>
Compound D is administered to rats Compound C is formed and no hydromorphone is<br>
liberated, thus also providing further evidence for the in vivo "activation" of the described<br>
produgs.<br>

2. In vitro human µ-opioid receptor binding assay.<br>
This test measures the affinity of test compounds for the µ-opioid receptor relative to<br>
hydromorphone.<br>
General procedure:<br>
The general procedure follows the protocol described by Wang, J.-B., Johnson, P.S., Perscio,<br>
A.M., Hawkins, A.L., Griffin, C.A. and Uhl, G.R. (1994). FEBS Lett., 338: 217-222.<br>
Assay: µ-opioid receptor<br>
Origin: human recombinant (HEK-293 cells)<br>
Reference compound: [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO)<br>
Radioligand: [3H]DAMGO (0.5 nM)<br>
Non-specific ligand: naloxone (lOuM)<br>
Incubation: 120 min @ 22°C<br>
Method of detection: scintillation counting<br>
Analysis and expression of results: The specific binding to the receptors is defined as the<br>
difference between the total binding and the non-specific binding determined in the presence<br>
of an excess of unlabelled ligand. The results are expressed as a percent of control of specific<br>
binding and as a present inhibition of control specific binding obtained in the presence of test<br>
compounds. The IC50 values (molar concentration causing a half-maximal inhibition of<br>
control specific binding), and Hill coefficients (nH) were determined by non-linear regression<br>
analysis of competition curves using Hill equation curve fitting.<br>
The above results are consistent with the structure activity relationships for opioids obtained<br>
in the literature, obtained from screening of these representative molecules, demonstrate the<br>
deactivation of opioid potency when the promoiety is appended to the phenol residue of<br>
hydromorphone.<br>
3. Pharmacokinetic Data<br>
Plasma timecourse of hydromorphone following IV administration to rat<br>
IV dosing: Test compound is dissolved in saline (2mg/ml) and injected into the tail vein of<br>
jugular vein cannulated male Sprague-Dawley rats. Hydromorphone (HM) at 1 mg/kg,<br>
oxyydromorphone (OM) at 0.5 mg/kg, morphine (MR) at 1 mg/kg, and N-methylnaltrexone<br>
(N-MTX) at 2 mg/kg are used as positive controls, and the test compounds are dosed at a<br>
parent opioid equivalent dose (e.g. equal to 1 mg/kg , 0.5 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg). At specified<br>
time points, blood is withdrawn, quenched into methanol, centrifuged at 14000 rpm @ 4°C,<br>
and stored at -80°C until analysis. Samples are quantified via LC/MS/MS using an ABI 3000<br>
triple-quad mass spectrometer.<br>
Oral dosing: The test compound is dissolved in saline (20mg/ml) and dosed via oral gavage<br>
into jugular vein cannulated male Sprague-Dawley rats. HM, OM, MR and 10 mg/kg, and N-<br>
MTX at 20 mg/kg are used positive controls and the test compound is dosed at an<br>
approximate parent opioid equivalent dose (e.g. equal to 10 or 20 mg/kg). At specified time<br>
points, blood is withdrawn, quenched into methanol, centrifuged at 14000 rpm @ 4°C, and<br>
stored at -80°C until analysis. Samples are quantified via LC/MS/MS using an ABI 3000<br>
triple-quad mass spectrometer.<br>
Compared to hydromorphone, compounds according to the invention afford a lower Cmax<br>
of hydromorphone when administered IV, but demonstrate similar Cmax values to<br>
hydromorphone when administered orally.<br>
Compared to oxymorphone, compounds according to the invention afford a lower Cmax of<br>
oxymorphone when administered IV, but demonstrate similar Cmax values to oxymorphone<br>
when administered orally.<br>
Compared to morphine, compounds according to the invention afford a lower Cmax of<br>
morphine when administered IV, but demonstrate similar Cmax values to morphine when<br>
administered orally.<br>
The compound of Example 19, which is a secondary carbamate prodrug of (R)-N-<br>
Methylnaltexone, describes one aspect of the invention which embodies a method of<br>
providing a patient with post administration-activated, controlled release of a phenolic opioid<br>
antagonist, in this case a peripherally active opioid antagonist. Compared to (R)-N-<br>
methylnaltrexone, the compound affords a superior Cmax value compared to (R)-N-<br>
methylnaltrexone when administered orally.<br>
Figure 1. Plasma concentration time course of the production of N-MTX following oral (PO)<br>
dosing in rats. The solid line represents the plasma concentration of N-MTX following PO<br>
dosing of N-MTX at 20 mg/kg. The dashed line represents the plasma concentration of N-<br>
MTX produced following oral dosing of Example 19 at 20 mg/kg.<br>
Figure 2. Plasma concentration time course of the production of hydromorphone and N-MTX<br>
following PO dosing of prodrugs in rats. The solid line represents the plasma concentration<br>
of hydromorphone following PO dosing of Example 3 at 10 mg/kg. The dashed line<br>
represents the plasma concentration of N-MTX following oral dosing of Example 19 at 20<br>
mg/kg.<br>
By examining the plasma time course represented by figure 1 it is clear that the utility of (R)-<br>
N-methylnaltrexone may be limited by its poor pharmacokinetic profile (e.g. oral<br>
bioavailability). This limitation can be overcome by the prodrug represented by the<br>
compound of Example 19 which provides an improved pharmacokinetic profile (e.g.<br>
increased oral bioavailabilty). Furthermore figure 2 demonstrates that the prodrug approach<br>
represented by the compounds of Examples 3 and 19 allows for higher, and perhaps<br>
complimentary, plasma levels of opioid agonist and antagonist to be obtained when prodrugs<br>
thereof are dosed orally.<br>
Plasma timecourse of hydromorphone following IV administration in dog.<br>
Fifteen male beagle dogs were selected from the Test Facility's colony of non-naïve animals<br>
and placed into five groups of three animals per group. The animals were assigned to the<br>
study based on acceptable health as determined by a staff veterinarian following a pre-study<br>
health status check. The animals were fasted overnight prior to each dosing session and food<br>
was returned to the animals approximately 4 hours post-dose for each dose session. All<br>
substances were stored at 22±5°C prior to dosing under desiccate conditions.<br>
Intravenous administration.<br>
The test compounds were prepared in 0.9% NaCl at a target concentration of 0.4 mg/mL (0.4<br>
mg/kg final dose) for intravenous administration. Hydromorphone was prepared in 0.9%<br>
NaCl at a target concentration of 0.2 and 0.1 mg/m (0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg final dose) for<br>
intravenous administration.<br>
A dose formulation sample (0.15 mL) was collected from each intravenous formulation, prior<br>
to dosing, pre- and post-filtration. All dose formulation samples were stored at -20±5°C until<br>
analyzed.<br>
Test compounds were administered through a temporary percutaneous catheter placed in a<br>
peripheral vein at a target dose level of 0.4 mg/kg and a dose volume of 1 mL/kg. The<br>
Animals received a slow intravenous bolus push over a 1.5 minute period. Hydromorphone<br>
was administered similarly at a target dose level of 0.2 mg/kg and a dose volume of 1 mL/kg.<br>
The animals received a slow intravenous bolus push over a 2 minute period. Immediately<br>
following intravenous dosing, the catheters were flushed with 3 mL of saline prior to removal.<br>
Blood samples (0.5 mL, whole blood, Li-Heparin anticoagulant) were collected prior to<br>
dosing and at timepoints up to 24 hours following intravenous dosing. All samples were<br>
collected via direct venipuncture of a peripheral vein, quenched into methanol, centrifuged at<br>
14000 rpm @ 4°C, and stored at -80°C until analysis. Samples are quantified via LC/MS/MS<br>
using an ABI 3000 triple-quad mass spectrometer.<br>
Oral administration.<br>
The test compounds were prepared in 0.9% NaCl at a target concentration of 4 mg/mL (4<br>
mg/kg final dose) for oral administration. Hydromorphone, was prepared in 0.9% NaCl at a<br>
target concentration of 2 mg/mL (2 mg/kg final dose) for oral administration. The oral<br>
formulations were mixed by swirling and sonicated as needed to aid in complete dissolution.<br>
A dose formulation sample (0.15 mL) was collected from each oral formulation prior to<br>
dosing. All dose formulation samples were stored at -20±5°C until analyzed.<br>
Test compounds were administered via oral gavage at a target dose level 4 mg/kg and at a<br>
dose volume of 1 mL/kg. Hydromorphone was administered via oral gavage at a target dose<br>
level 2 mg/kg and at a dose volume of 1 mL/kg. Immediately following oral dosing the<br>
gavage tubes were flushed with 10 mL of water prior to removal. Blood samples (0.5 mL,<br>
whole blood, Li-Heparin anticoagulant) were collected prior to dosing and at timepoints up to<br>
24 hours following oral dosing.. All samples were collected via direct venipuncture of a<br>
peripheral vein, quenched into methanol, centrifuged at 14000 rpm @ 4°C, and stored at<br>
-80°C until analysis. Samples are quantified via LC/MS/MS using an ABI 3000 triple-quad<br>
mass spectrometer.<br>
Results:<br>
Table 12. Maximum concentration (Cmax) of hydromorphone (HM) found in blood<br>
after IV dosing in dogs.<br>
Compared to hydromorphone, compounds according to the invention afford a lower Cmax<br>
of hydromorphone when administered IV, but demonstrate similar Cmax values to<br>
hydromorphone when administered orally.<br>
Taken together, these test data demonstrate that compounds according to the invention are<br>
capable of providing patients with post administration-activated, controlled release of a<br>
phenolic opioid. In particular, the data demonstrate that the pro-drugs release opioid when<br>
administered orally, but resist release of opioid when subjected to conditions commonly used<br>
by those who wish to abuse the drug.<br>
