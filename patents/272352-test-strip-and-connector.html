BACKGROUND<br>
[0001]	Electrochemical methods and devices for determining analyte concentrations in<br>
fluid samples find wide application in the treatment and management of medical<br>
conditions such as diabetes. Individuals suffering from diabetes monitor their blood<br>
glucose concentrations using such methods often several times per day.<br>
[0002]	Electrochemical methods generally rely upon the correlation between a current, a<br>
potential or accumulated charge and the concentration of analyte, typically in conjunction<br>
with a reagent that produces charge carriers when combined with the analyte. The<br>
electrochemical biosensors for performing the tests are typically disposable test strips<br>
having a reagent disposed thereon that chemically reacts with a biological fluid such as<br>
blood. The test strip is mated to a test meter such that the test meter can measure the<br>
reaction between the analyte and the reagent to determine the concentration of the<br>
analyte. For electrochemically-based test strips, the electrical signal is transferred to the<br>
meter through electrical contact pads on the test strips and contacts within the meter strip<br>
port connector.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0003]	In one aspect, an analyte test strip is provided that includes a generally planar<br>
substrate and a plurality of conductive areas disposed on the substrate to define five<br>
distinct conductive portions comprising at least five contact lands defining respective<br>
 <br>
vertices of a polygon, and in which two contact lands are located in a single conductive<br>
portion.<br>
[0004]	In another embodiment, an analyte measurement system is provided that includes<br>
a housing and a test strip. The housing includes a connector module disposed in the<br>
housing. The connector module includes a plurality of spaced apart contact leads<br>
disposed in the connector module. The test strip includes a generally planar substrate.<br>
The test strip includes a plurality of conductive areas disposed on the substrate to define<br>
five distinct conductive portions having at least five contact lands defining respective<br>
vertices of a polygon, and in which two contact lands are located in a single conductive<br>
portions so that the plurality of spaced apart contact leads engages respective contact<br>
lands when the substrate is inserted into the connector module.<br>
[0005]	In yet a further embodiment, a method of operating a test measurement device is<br>
provided. The method can be achieved by providing a measurement device having seven<br>
contact leads; designating two contact leads as strip detection contact leads; and locating<br>
seven contact lands as respective vertices of a polygon on a substrate with two contact<br>
lands that are in substantial alignment with the strip detection contact leads when the<br>
substrate is inserted into the measurement device.<br>
[0006]	These and other embodiments, features and advantages will become apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art when taken with reference to the following more detailed<br>
description of the invention in conjunction with the accompanying drawings that are first<br>
briefly described herebelow.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0014]	The following detailed description should be read with reference to the drawings,<br>
in which like elements in different drawings are identically numbered. The drawings,<br>
which are not necessarily to scale, depict selected exemplary embodiments and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the invention. The detailed description illustrates by way of<br>
example, not by way of limitation, the principles of the invention. This description will<br>
clearly enable one skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and describes several<br>
embodiments, adaptations, variations, alternatives and uses of the invention, including<br>
what is presently believed to be the best mode of carrying out the invention.<br>
[0015]	As used herein, the terms "about" or "approximately" for any numerical values or<br>
ranges indicate a suitable dimensional tolerance that allows the part or collection of<br>
components to function for its intended purpose as described herein. In addition, as used<br>
herein, the terms "patient", "host" and "subject" refer to any human or animal subject and<br>
 <br>
are not intended to limit the systems or methods to human use, although use of the<br>
subject invention in a human patient represents a preferred embodiment.<br>
[0016]	Referring generally now to FIGS. 1A and 4B, test strip 90 shown in FIGS. 1A and<br>
1B is typically coupled to a meter 92 or other electrical device by an electrical connector<br>
module 200, which is configured to couple with and contact the end of test strip 90 at<br>
contact pads 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19. In particular, the contact pads 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19<br>
define five distinct conductive portions which may have at least five contact lands 100<br>
(Fig. 3A) defining respective vertices of a polygon on a generally planar surface of test<br>
strip 90, and in which two contact lands are located in a single conductive portion. By<br>
this arrangement, the plurality of spaced apart contact leads (206, 208, 210, 212, 214) of<br>
the connector module 200 engages respective contact lands 100 (FIGS. 3A and 4A) when<br>
the test strip is inserted into the connector module 200 of the meter 92.<br>
[0017]	The meter 92 typically includes a potentiostat or other component to provide a<br>
potential and/or current for the electrodes of test strip 90. The meter 92 also typically<br>
includes a processor (e.g., a microprocessor or logical processing hardware) for<br>
determining analyte concentration from the test strip signals. The meter 92 may also<br>
include a display for displaying results determined from the test strip signals including,<br>
for example, analyte concentration, rate of change of analyte concentration, and/or the<br>
exceeding of a threshold analyte concentration (indicating, for example, hypo-or<br>
hyperglycemia).<br>
[0018]	Connector 200 is generally a two-part structure, having a first member 202 and a<br>
second member 204 (see FIG. 1 A). Positioned between and secured by first member 202<br>
and second member second member 204 are contact leads 206, 208, 210, 212, 214, 216<br>
and 218 that provide electrical connection between test strip 90 and a meter. These leads<br>
206, 208, 210, 212, 214, 216 and 218 have terminal ends to physically contact pads 11,<br>
13, 15, 17, and 19 (shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B) and distal ends to connect to second<br>
member 204. Proximal end 5 of test strip 90 which has the contact pads can be slid into<br>
or mated with connector 200 by placing test strip 90 into a slide area (not shown), which<br>
 <br>
provides a support for and retains test strip 90. The contact structures of connector 200<br>
make electrical contact with the correct pads of the sensor so that the working electrode<br>
and counter electrode(s) are correctly coupled to the meter.<br>
[0019]	Leads 206, 208, 210, 212, 214, 216 and 218 may be parallel, non-overlapping and<br>
run longitudinally from their distal end to their terminal end. Leads 206, 208, 210 and<br>
212 end at their respective terminal ends, but leads 214, 216 and 218 continue<br>
longitudinally past the proximal end of leads 206, 208, 210 and 212. As described<br>
previously, the terminal ends of leads 206, 208, 210, 212, 214, 216 and 218 can be<br>
staggered such that the contact landing areas form a polygon, e.g., a heptagon or a<br>
pentagon.<br>
[0020]	FIG. 1B is an exploded perspective view of a test strip 90, which includes<br>
multiple layers disposed upon a substrate 5. These layers may include a conductive layer<br>
50, an insulation layer 16, a reagent layer 22, an adhesive layer 60, a hydrophilic layer<br>
70, and a top layer 80. Test strip 90 may be manufactured in a series of steps wherein the<br>
conductive layer 50, insulation layer 16, reagent layer 22 and adhesive layer 60 are<br>
sequentially deposited on substrate 5 using, for example, a screen printing process as<br>
described in U.S. Pre-Grant Publication No. US20050096409A1 and published<br>
International Application No.'s WO2004040948A1, WO2004040290A1,<br>
WO2004040287A1, WO2004040285A2, WO2004040005A1, WO2004039897A2, and<br>
WO2004039600A2. In an alternative embodiment, an ink jetting process may be used to<br>
deposit reagent layer 22 on substrate 5. An exemplary ink jetting process is described in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,179,979. Hydrophilic layer 70 and top layer 80 may be deposed from a<br>
roll stock and laminated onto substrate 5. In an alternative embodiment, a sputtering<br>
process is used to apply conductive layer 50 and patterns are created in conductive layer<br>
50 by laser ablation. Test strip 90 includes a distal portion 3 and a proximal portion 4 as<br>
shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B.<br>
[0021]	The fully assembled test strip 90, as shown in FIG. 1B, includes an inlet 82<br>
through which a blood sample may be drawn into a sample-receiving chamber 84. Inlet<br>
 <br>
82 may be formed by cutting through a distal portion 3 of test strip 90. A blood sample<br>
can be applied to inlet 82 to fill a sample-receiving chamber 84 so that glucose can be<br>
measured. The side edges of a first adhesive pad 24 and a second adhesive pad 26<br>
located adjacent to reagent layer 22 each define a wall of sample receiving chamber 84.<br>
A bottom portion or "floor" of sample receiving chamber 84 includes a portion of<br>
substrate 5, conductive layer 50, and insulation layer 16. A top portion or "roof of<br>
sample receiving chamber 84 includes distal hydrophilic portion 32.<br>
[0022]	For test strip 90, as shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B, conductive layer 50 includes a<br>
reference electrode 10, a first working electrode 12, a second working electrode 14, a<br>
reference contact pad 11, a first contact pad 13, a second contact pad 15, a strip detection<br>
contact pad 17 and an optional informational contact pad 19 (e.g., for calibration code<br>
information). Reference contact pad 11, first contact pad 13, second contact pad 15, strip<br>
detection contact pad 17 and informational contact pad 19 provide electrical connection<br>
to a test meter (denoted in FIG. 1A in dashed outline) to allow for data and measurement<br>
collection. In other embodiments, contact pad 17 may be informational and contact pad<br>
19 may be used for strip detection.<br>
[0023]	Strip port connector electrical contact landing areas are shown in FIGS. 2A - 2C.<br>
Strip port connector electrical contact landing areas may each be located at a vertex of a<br>
polygon. The polygon may have a regular or irregular shape with an odd number of<br>
vertices. Where the polygon is irregular in shape, its sides may not all have the same<br>
length or whose interior angles do not all have the same measure. In embodiments in<br>
which the polygon is regular in shape, the polygon is equilateral and equiangular. In one<br>
embodiment, the polygon is a heptagon (see FIG. 2A). In another embodiment, the<br>
polygon is a pentagon (see FIGS. 2B and 2C). Alternative embodiments of the contact<br>
portion of conductive layer 50 with the landing area for the strip port connector contacts<br>
superimposed thereon are shown in FIGS. 3A - 3F. In FIGS. 3A - 3F, the contact<br>
landing areas are each preferably located at the vertex of a heptagon. The shaded regions<br>
indicate the location of the strip detection pad that turns on the meter when test strip 90 is<br>
 <br>
inserted therein. The strip detection pad is configured and arranged to close an electrical<br>
circuit between two contacts within the meter when test strip 90 is properly inserted into<br>
the meter. Proper insertion into the meter means that test strip 90 is inserted right side up,<br>
that the correct end of test strip 90 is inserted into the meter, and that test strip 90 is<br>
inserted far enough into the meter that reliable electrical connections are made between<br>
the electrodes contact pads and the corresponding contacts within the meter.<br>
[0024]	The arrangement of contact pads and strip port connector electrical contact-<br>
landing areas may be used to identify the geographical area in which the test strip may be<br>
used. If, for example, a customer inserts a test strip in a meter that does not have the<br>
correct configuration of contact pads and strip port connector electrical contact landing<br>
areas, then the meter will not be turned on or a test result will not be obtained.<br>
[0025]	Referring again to FIG. 1B, reference electrode 10, first working electrode 12 and<br>
second working electrode 14 are connected to reference contact pad 11, first contact pad<br>
13, and second contact pad 15, respectively, by electrode extensions called "traces". The<br>
traces may be routed external to polygon, internal to polygon or may be routed both<br>
external and internal to polygon. First working electrode trace 8 provides an electrically<br>
continuous pathway from first working electrode 12 to first contact pad 13. Similarly, a<br>
second working electrode trace 9 provides an electrically continuous pathway from<br>
second working electrode 14 to second contact pad 15 and reference electrode trace 7<br>
provides an electrically continuous pathway from reference electrode 10 to reference<br>
contact pad 11.<br>
[0026]	Suitable materials which may be used for the conductive layer are Au, Pd, Ir, Pt,<br>
Rh, stainless steel, doped tin oxide, carbon, and the like. In one embodiment, the<br>
material for the conductive layer may be a carbon ink such as those described in U.S.<br>
patent 5,653,918. In another embodiment, the material for the conductive layer may be a<br>
sputtered metal, and in particular a noble metal such as gold, palladium, or alloys thereof.<br>
[0027]	For test strip 90, insulation layer 16 includes aperture 18 that exposes a portion of<br>
reference electrode 10, first working electrode 12, and second working electrode 14, all<br>
 <br>
of which can be wetted by a liquid sample. For example, insulation layer 16 may be<br>
Ercon E6110-116 Jet Black Insulayer™ ink, which may be purchased from Ercon, Inc<br>
(Waltham, Massachusetts).<br>
[0028]	Reagent layer 22 may be disposed on a portion of conductive layer 50, substrate<br>
5, and insulation layer 16 as shown in FIG. 1B. In an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, reagent layer 22 may include chemicals such as an enzyme, a mediator which<br>
selectivity react with glucose and a buffer for maintaining a desired pH. Examples of<br>
enzymes suitable for use in this invention may include either glucose oxidase or glucose<br>
dehydrogenase. More specifically, the glucose dehydrogenase may have a<br>
pyrroloquinoline quinone co-factor (abbreviated as PQQ and may be referred to its<br>
common name which is methoxatin). Examples of mediator suitable for use in this<br>
invention may include either ferricyanide or ruthenium hexamine trichloride<br>
([RuIII(NH3)6Cl3 which may also be simply referred to as ruthenium hexamine).<br>
Examples of buffers suitable for use in the present invention may include phosphate,<br>
citrate or citraconate. Examples of reagent formulations or inks suitable for use in the<br>
present invention can be found in US patents 5,708,247 and 6,046,051; published<br>
international applications WO01/67099 and WO01/73124.<br>
[0029]	In one embodiment, the formulation may include a 200 mM phosphate buffer<br>
having a pH of about 7 and a ruthenium hexamine mediator concentration ranging from<br>
about 5% and greater, preferably ranging from about 10% and greater, and yet more<br>
preferably ranging from about 15% to about 20% (percentage based on weight of<br>
mediator / volume of buffer). The pH of around 7 was chosen because glucose oxidase<br>
has a sufficiently high activity at this pH when using ruthenium hexamine as a mediator.<br>
The upper range for ruthenium hexamine was based on its solubility. When the enzyme<br>
ink is formulated to have greater than a 20% ruthenium hexamine concentration, solid<br>
particles of ruthenium hexamine were present in reagent layer 22 which do not dissolve<br>
during testing. The presence of undissolved ruthenium hexamine is believed to cause a<br>
decrease in the test strip-to-test strip precision. When the enzyme ink is formulated to<br>
 <br>
have less than a 15% ruthenium hexamine concentration, the magnitude of the test<br>
current values decreased with the concentration of ruthenium hexamine.<br>
[0030]	In one embodiment, the formulation may have an enzyme activity ranging from<br>
about 1500 units/mL to about 8000 units/mL. The enzyme activity range may be selected<br>
so that the glucose current does not depend on the level of enzyme activity in the<br>
formulation so long as the enzyme activity level is within the above stated range. The<br>
enzyme activity should be sufficiently large to ensure that the resulting glucose current<br>
will not be dependent on small variations in the enzyme activity. For instance, the<br>
glucose current will depend on the amount of enzyme activity in the formulation if the<br>
enzyme activity is less than 1500 units/mL. On the other hand, for enzyme activity levels<br>
greater than 8000 units/mL, solubility issues may arise where the glucose oxidase cannot<br>
be sufficiently dissolved in the formulation. Glucose oxidase may be commercially<br>
available from Biozyme Laboratories International Limited (San Diego, California,<br>
U.S.A.). The glucose oxidase may have an enzyme activity of about 250 units/mg where<br>
the enzyme activity units are based on an o-dianisidine assay at pH 7 and 25 °C.<br>
[0031]	Optionally, reagent layer 22 includes a matrix material that aides in retaining the<br>
reagent layer 22 on the surface of conductive layer 50 in the presence of fluid sample and<br>
has both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains. Useful matrix materials include<br>
hydrophilic clay, kaolin, talc, silicates, diatomaceous earth or silicas such as Cab-o-Sil®<br>
TS630 or Cab-o-Sil® 530 (Cabot Corporation, Boston, USA). While not wishing to be<br>
bound by any particular theory, it is believed that silica forms a gel network in the<br>
presence of the sample that effectively maintains the coating on the surface of the<br>
electrode. Other useful matrix materials include polymeric materials such as sodium<br>
alginate, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene oxide, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate,<br>
polymeric latex materials, polyethersulfones, acrylic and methacrylic acid polymers;<br>
polymers derived from starch, cellulose and other natural polysaccharides, polyamides or<br>
collagen. An example of a useful coating composition is disclosed in Example 1 of US<br>
patent number 5,708,247. Reagent layer 22 may also optionally include at least one<br>
 <br>
stabilizing agent such as albumin, sucrose, trehalose, mannitol or lactose, an agent such<br>
as hydroxyethylcellulose to adjust the viscosity, an antifoam agent such as DC 1500, and<br>
at least one wetting agent such as polyvinylpyrrilidone or polyvinyl acetate.<br>
[0032]	In exemplary embodiments, reagent layer 22 is applied as a generally even layer<br>
to the exposed surface of the electrodes. The thickness of reagent layer 22 prior to<br>
contacting the fluid sample can be about 50 microns and usually does not exceed 20<br>
microns. To provide an effective coating on the surface of the electrode, the thickness of<br>
the layer can be less than about 5 microns and is usually not less than about 7 microns.<br>
[0033]	For test strip 90, adhesive layer 60 includes first adhesive pad 24, second adhesive<br>
pad 26, and third adhesive pad 28 as shown in FIG. 1B. In an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, adhesive layer 60 may comprise a water based acrylic copolymer pressure<br>
sensitive adhesive which is commercially available from Tape Specialties LTD, which is<br>
located in Tring, Herts, United Kingdom (part#A6435). Adhesive layer 60 is deposed on<br>
a portion of insulation layer 16, conductive layer 50, and substrate 5. Adhesive layer 60<br>
binds hydrophilic layer 70 to test strip 90.<br>
[0034]	Hydrophilic layer 70 includes a distal hydrophilic portion 32 and proximal<br>
hydrophilic portion 34. In one embodiment, hydrophilic layer 70 is a polyester material<br>
having one hydrophilic surface such as an anti-fog coating, which is commercially<br>
available from 3M.<br>
[0035]	For test strip 90, top layer 80 includes a clear portion 36 and opaque portion 38 as<br>
shown in FIG. 1B. Top layer 80 is disposed on and adhered to hydrophilic layer 70. As a<br>
non-limiting example, top layer 80 may be a polyester. It should be noted that the clear<br>
portion 36 substantially overlaps distal hydrophilic portion 32, allowing a user to visually<br>
confirm that the sample-receiving chamber 84 is sufficiently filled. Opaque portion 38<br>
helps the user observe a high degree of contrast between a colored fluid such as, for<br>
example, blood within the sample receiving chamber 84 and the opaque portion 38 of top<br>
layer 80.<br>
 <br>
[0036]	It is believed that, given the large number of electrochemically-based test strips<br>
on the market, users might try to use a less expensive test strip in a meter that is not<br>
designed for that meter, which could lead to inaccurate test results. If a less expensive<br>
test strip gives accurate test results in a meter for which it is not designed, this could<br>
result in illegal third party importation of test strips.<br>
[0037]	As provided for by applicants herein, various embodiments can be utilized to<br>
ameliorate the above problem. Such embodiments would also reduce third party<br>
importation of test strips that are not intended to be used in an intended geographical<br>
region or regions.<br>
[0038]	Also, by virtue of the arrangement of odd number of vertices of 5 or greater in a<br>
polygon defined by the contact lands, the arrangement would allow for a sufficient<br>
number of connection points with the meter and test strip. That is, with reference to FIG.<br>
4A, the spatial distribution of the vertices 100 can be used when selecting pairs of<br>
vertices for providing the meter switching functionality. Any pair of vertex connection<br>
points can be utilized without posing any compromise to the availability of the three<br>
remaining vertices (with a pentagonal polygon) to provide the working and reference<br>
electrode connections. Similarly for higher order odd-numbered polygons (for example a<br>
heptagon) any pair of connection vertices can be selected for the switching function and<br>
any other pair of vertices, such that, when joined, produce a circuit that is non-crossing<br>
with the first switch-pair, and thus can be selected for a second function, leaving the final<br>
three vertices still fully accessibly for the working and the reference electrodes. Further,<br>
the spatial distribution can most effectively be utilized by constraining the use of the<br>
interior of the polygon for the meter-switching functionality and the exterior of the<br>
polygon figure for the measurement circuitry. This ensures that there will be no conflict<br>
between the circuitry requirements and maximizes the versatility of the concept for the<br>
number of incompatible test-strip variations that can be generated. The spatial<br>
distribution of the polygon figure results in a clear open space in the center of the figure,<br>
 <br>
regardless of the complexity of any devised switching regime. This clear space can be<br>
utilized for strip anti-counterfeit security features.<br>
[0039]	While the invention has been described in terms of particular variations and<br>
illustrative figures, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the invention is<br>
not limited to the variations or figures described. In addition, where methods and steps<br>
described above indicate certain events occurring in certain order, those of ordinary skill<br>
in the art will recognize that the ordering of certain steps may be modified and that such<br>
modifications are in accordance with the variations of the invention. Additionally,<br>
certain of the steps may be performed concurrently in a parallel process when possible, as<br>
well as performed sequentially as described above. Therefore, to the extent there are<br>
variations of the invention, which are within the spirit of the disclosure or equivalent to<br>
the inventions found in the claims, it is the intent that this patent will cover those<br>
variations as well. Finally, all publications and patent applications cited in this<br>
specification are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety as if each individual<br>
publication or patent application were specifically and individually put forth herein.<br>
