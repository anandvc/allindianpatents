				<td>AN IMPROVED PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF 4-HYDROXY-BUTAN-2-ONE<br>
This invention relates to an improved process for the production of 4-hydroxy-butan-2-one of formula (2) Raspberry ketone (R=H) [Fig 1] is an important insect attractant for the scarabaeid subfamily and efficient perfume chemicals of modern time. Zingerone (R=OCH3) [Fig 1] is also a pharmaceutically active compound and a key intermediate en route to the bronchospasmolytic active compound. 4-hydroxy-butan-2-one (2) is one of the important raw materials for the preparation of Raspberry ketones and its derivatives [Fig-1, a &amp; b]. The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 4-hydroxy-butan-2-one (2) from readily available starting material 1,3- butane diol (1), oxidising particularly with Na2S205/NaBr03/H20/PTC, Na2S205/NaI03, DMSO/HI/H20 and DMSO/N2H4.H2O/I2/H2O more particularly using Na2S205/NaBr03/H20/PTC in a solvent. The compound (2) is one of the important raw materials for the production of Raspberry ketone (R =H) and Zingerone (R=OCH3) [Fig 1]<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
The following are the references so far available in the literature for the preparation of 4-hydroxy-butan-2-one (2) from 1,3-butane diol (1)<br>
Hitherto 4-hydroxy-butan-2-one (2) has been prepared by the methods described below:<br>
1.       By selective oxidation of 1,3-butane diol (1) with Distannoxane/Br2 Tetrahedron Letters, No. 50, pp- 4597-4600, (1976).<br>
According to the method disclosed in this paper, the 1,3—butane diol (1) is allowed to react with (Bii3Sn)20-Br2 in DCM (dichloromethane) solvent at room temperature. The drawback of the method is that it involves poisonous Tin (Sn) metal in the reaction mixture and DCM, a health hazard is used as solvent along with Bromine (Br) .The yield of 4-hydroxy-butan-2-one (2) is only 66%<br>
2.	By oxidation of 1,3-butane diol (1) with t-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) and Zeolite<br>
Tetrahedron Letters, vol-53, No. 46, pp-15867-76, (1997).<br>
In this reported procedure oxidation of (1) is carried out with t-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) and Zeolite (3A°, M.S) under microwave irradiation (MW) at solid state. After completion of the reaction, extracted with ether and worked-up. The main drawback of the method is that the method involves complete anhydrous conditions and (TBHP) is an expensive reagent. The yield of the process is 64% only.<br>
3.	By Oxidation of (1) with K2Fe04-Al203-CuS04.5 H20<br>
Tetrahedron Letters, Vol-27, No. 25, pp- 2875-78, (1986)<br>
The method selectively oxidise (1) to (2) in 85% yield at room temperature in benzene solvent. The main limitation of the process is that it involves highly carcinogenic solvent benzene though the yield is very good (85%). Also, the reaction time of the method is very longer (30 hours).<br>
4.	By selective oxidation of (1) with H2O2/TS-1 and DMDO<br>
Tetrahedron Letters, Vol-35, No. 45, pp- 8477- 80, (1994)<br>
The reagents H2O2/TS-I and DMDO selectively oxidise (1) to (2) in poor to very good yields. The yield of the selective oxidation (1) to (2) with DMDO (dimethyldioxirane) is very poor and it is not readily available. Though the yield of (1) to (2) with the oxidation TS-1 (Zeolite) is very good, but the preparation of TS-1 is not easy i.e it is prepared by using long procedure by dopping Titanium metal (Ti) in the Zeolite.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation<br>
of 4-hydroxy-butan-2-one (2)<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a method for the oxidation of 1,3-butane<br>
diol (1) to 4-hydroxy-butan-2-one (2)<br>
Yet, another objective of the present invention is to provide oxidation of (1) to (2) by eliminating<br>
the use of benzene and dichloromethane as solvent.<br>
Yet, another objective of the present invention is to carry out the reaction in an aqueous solvent<br>
eliminating the requirement of anhydrous conditions.<br>
Yet, another objective of the present invention is to carry out the reaction with readily available<br>
chemicals, eliminating the requirement of costly and toxic chemicals like Tin (Sn) and Bromine. Accordingly, an improves»process for the production of 4-hydroxy-butan-2-one of formula (2), as wherein shown in the drawing accompanying this specification which comprises stirring of compound of formula (1) in an organic system with Na2S205/NaBr03/PTC/H20 at a temperature ranging between 0 to 80 °C for a period in the range of 18-28 hours, removing the organic solvent by distillation under reduced pressure, treating the above said reaction mixture with acetic acid (5%) followed by extraction with water immiscible organic solvent, washing with sodium bicabonate solution( 5%), and removal of solvent under reduced pressure passing the residue through a coloumn and extracting with solvent to get compound of formula (2).<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>

In another embodiment of the invention the ratio of Na2S2O5 and NaBrO3 used may be in the range of 1:1<br>
