THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>
[39 OF 1970]<br>
PROVISIONAL/ COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"LOW FLOOR TYPE TWO-WHEELED VEHICLE"<br><br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br>
The   following  specification  particularly  describes   the   nature   of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
[DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION] <br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a technique for arranging devices in a low floor type two-wheeled vehicle. <br>
[Prior Art]<br>
For example, in FIG. 10 of Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-142529 entitled "Two-wheeled Motor Vehicle," there is shown a two-wheeled motor vehicle 1 wherein a horizontally extending portion 16a is disposed between a front wheel 2 (this and the following reference numerals related to this prior art are quoted from the above publication) and a rear wheel 3, and a foot board 4 (not shown) is laid across the horizontally extending portion 16a, thereby permitting a rider 5 to put his or her feet thereon.  Since the horizontally extending portion 16a is very close to the ground, such a vehicle is called a "low<br>
2<br><br>
floor type two-wheeled vehicle."<br>
Further, a power unit 24 which includes a motor 63 and a controller 65 is disposed concentratively within a circle of the rear wheel 3.<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
For disposing the power unit 24, etc. concentratively within the rear wheel 3 as mentioned above, it is inevitably required that the diameter of the rear wheel be made large to a certain extent.  In this case, however, a limit is encountered in the selection of wheel diameter and hence it becomes difficult to adopt a wheel of a small diameter.<br>
Further, if the power unit 24, etc. are disposed concentratively within the rear wheel 3, mass is biased to the rear wheel side and there is a fear that a mass balance of the vehicle may be badly influenced.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a low floor type two-wheeled vehicle capable of enhancing the degree of freedom in the selection of wheel diameter and capable of attaining a satisfactory mass balance of the vehicle. <br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
3<br><br>
For achieving the above-mentioned object, in claim 1 there is provided a low floor type two-wheeled vehicle with a low step floor disposed between a bar handle and a seat, characterized in that the seat is supported by a pair of right and left seat supporting frames, a power unit is mounted swingably through pivot shafts provided in the seat supporting frames in such a manner that a cylinder of an internal combustion engine faces between the paired seat supporting frames, a fuel tank is disposed in front of and along the seat supporting frames so as to cover the cylinder from the front and from above, the cylinder being positioned in a front position of the power unit, and an electric appliances box is mounted to upper portions of rear sides of the seat supporting frames. <br>
The fuel tank, the power unit, and the electric appliances box are disposed concentratively around the seat supporting frames such that the fuel tank is disposed in front of and along the seat supporting frames, the power unit is mounted to lower portions of rear sides of the seat supporting frames, and the electric appliances box are mounted to upper portions of the rear sides of the seat supporting frames.<br>
4<br><br><br>
Although in the prior art main devices such as the power unit are disposed concentratively within the circle of the rear wheel, in the present invention main devices such as the power unit are disposed concentratively around the seat supporting frames different from the rear wheels.<br>
As a result, not only it is possible to freely select a desired rear wheel diameter, but also a mass balance in the vehicle body can be set freely and satisfactorily.<br>
In claim 2, a body frame of the low floor type two-wheeled vehicle comprises only a main frame extending from a head pipe and the seat supporting frames connected to the main frame, the main frame comprising an inclined portion extending backward and obliquely downward from the head pipe and a horizontal portion extending horizontally from a lower end of the inclined portion.<br>
The main frame is composed of the inclined portion and the horizontal portion, and the head pipe and the seat supporting frames are added to the main frame to constitute a body frame, so that the body frame becomes simple and the concentration of mass becomes more marked.<br>
5<br><br><br>
In claim 3, the horizontal portion of the main frame is almost covered with the step floor, while the inclined portion of the main frame and the seat supporting frames are exposed.<br>
Since the inclined portion of the main frame and the seat supporting frames are uncovered, the greater part of the body frame is exposed, not only the appearance of the vehicle is improved but also the cost for cover can be reduced. <br>
[Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will be described hereinunder with reference to the accompanying drawings.  The drawings should be seen in the directions of reference numerals.<br>

In claim 3, the horizontal portion of the main frame is almost covered with the step floor, while the inclined portion of the main frame and the seat supporting frames are exposed.<br>
Since the inclined portion of the main frame and the seat supporting frames are uncovered, the greater part of the body frame is exposed, not only the appearance of the vehicle is improved but also the cost for cover can be reduced.<br>
[Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will be described hereinunder with reference to the accompanying drawings.  The drawings should be seen in the directions of reference numerals.<br>
FIG. 1 is a side view of a low floor type two-wheeled vehicle embodying the present invention, in which and also in the following description Fr stands for a front side.<br>
In a two-wheeled motor vehicle 10 as the low floor type two-wheeled vehicle, a front fork 16 is attached to a head pipe 15 disposed at a front end of a main frame 11, a front wheel 17 is secured to the front fork 16<br><br>
frame is not present above the rear wheel 31, permits the attainment of a simple frame construction with concentrated mass.<br><br>
In the figure, the numeral 38 denotes a rear fender, numeral 41 denotes a head lamp, numeral 42 denotes a front winker, 43 a speedometer, 44 an adjusting screw, 45 an air cleaner, 47 a cushion material, and numeral 54 denotes a muffler connected to an exhaust pipe 59E which extends from a cylinder head 55.<br>
By disposing the cushion material 47 on an upper surface of the tail light 34 it is possible to support the seat 37 elastically.  The cushion material 47 may be provided on the seat 37 side.<br>
Further, numeral 48 denotes a curved step portion formed at a front portion of the step floor 25.<br>
A characteristic feature of this figure is that there is not used any other cover than the step floor 25. As a result, the inclined portion 23 and horizontal portion 24 of the main frame 11, as well as one seat pipe 86, can be seen in side view. For example, if the inclined portion 23 and the horizontal portion 24 of the main frame 11 are chromium-plated, the design characteristic of the body<br><br>
frame will be exhibited more effectively.<br>
Particularly, since no frame is present behind the seat pipes 86, a neat design can be created above the rear wheel 31 and such a simple frame construction permits the attainment of reduction in both weight and size.<br>
FIG. 2 is a view as seen in the direction of arrow 2 in FIG. 1.  In FIG. 2, a step means 85 is formed by welding a pair of metallic rods 88 to a front side of the inclined portion 23 of the main frame 11 so as to project right and left approximately horizontally, and the step floor 25 is made up of a cover member 89 disposed above the horizontal portion of the main pipe and a pair of step floor boards 91 connected to both sides of the cover member 89.  Preferably, the step floor boards 91 are higher in rigidity than the cover member 89. Alternatively, if the step floor boards 91 are formed of a hard material and the cover member 89 is formed of a somewhat softer material, it is possible to attain the reduction in weight of the step floor 25.<br>
As described above, the step floor boards 91 on which the rider"s feet are put directly are made high in<br><br>
rigidity or hardness to ensure a rigidity capable of withstanding the rider"s load and at the same time the portions capable of being reduced in weight can so weight-reduced; besides, it is also possible to prevent deformation and flaw.<br>
Therefore, the step floor 25 is extended up to a front position below the step means 85 and the curved step portions 48 are formed at front end portions.  A sufficient space is ensured for the step portions, thereby enhancing the freedom of riding posture.  This can be attained easily because the rigidity of the step floor boards 91 is high.<br>
FIG. 3 is an enlarged view of a principal portion of the low floor type two-wheeled vehicle according to the present invention, in which the left-hand side of the figure corresponds to the front side of the vehicle. Between a pair of seat pipes 86 spaced apart in the surface and back direction of the figure there is mounted the power unit 28 swingably through pivot shafts 29 disposed behind the seat pipes 86, the fuel tank 27 is disposed in front of and along the seat pipes 86 so as to cover a cylinder 56 from the front and from above, the cylinder 56 being disposed in a front portion of the<br><br>
power unit 28, and the electric appliances box 21 is mounted to upper portions of rear sides of the seat pipes 86.<br>
Within the electric appliances box 21 are mainly received a battery, an ignition unit, a regulator, and a starter relay, so this example is advantageous in that wiring may be short and that it suffices for only one portion to have a waterproof structure.  Further, the tail light 34 and rear winkers 35 are integrally mounted to an upper surface of the electric appliances box 21.<br>
Numeral 21a denotes an ignition switch, numeral 27a denotes a fuel supply port cap, and numeral 58E denotes a belt-connection type transmission mechanism provided in the power unit 28.<br>
It is an operating lever 74 that projects from the cross pipe 87 disposed at the upper ends of the seat pipes 86 . A ratchet mechanism which includes the operating lever 74 will be described below.<br>
The fuel tank 27, the power unit 28, and the electric appliances box 21 are disposed concentratively around the seat pipes 86 in such a manner that the fuel tank 27 is located in front of and along the seat pipes 86 which<br><br>
serve as seat supporting frames for supporting the seat 37, the power unit 28 is mounted to lower portions of the rear sides of the seat pipes 86, and the electric appliances box 21 is mounted to upper portions of the rear sides of the seat pipes 86.<br>
Although in the prior art main devices such as the power unit are disposed concentratively within a circle of the rear wheel, in the present invention main devices such as the power unit are disposed around the seat supporting frames different from the rear wheel.<br>
As a result, not only it is possible to freely select a desired rear wheel diameter, but also a mass balance in the vehicle body can be set freely and satisfactorily.<br>
FIG. 4 is an exploded perspective view of a ratchet mechanism adopted in the present invention.  This ratchet mechanism, indicated at GOB, is basically a combination of a pair of ratchet portions 64 each having plural teeth (first tooth 61, second tooth 62, third tooth 63) and a lock portion 67 having locking pawls 66.  More specifically, the ratchet portions 64 are formed on a cylindrical portion 68, the seat holding plate 36 is extended from the cylindrical portion 68, the cylindrical<br><br>
portion 68 is inserted into the cross pipe 87 through an upper opening 93 formed in the cross pipe which is of a large diameter and is positioned between a pair of right and left disks 92 incorporated in the cross pipe 87, then is connected to the disks 92 through a pivot bolt 71, thereby permitting the ratchet portions 64 and the seat holding plate 36 to rotate with the pivot bolt 71 as fulcrum. <br>
On the other hand, the operating lever 74 is extended below the seat and backward from the lock portion 67 having the locking pawls 66, then the lock portion 67 is inserted into the cross pipe 87 through a lower opening 94 formed in the cross pipe of a large diameter and is connected to the pair of right and left disks 92 through a sub bolt 75, whereby the lock portion 67 can be allowed to swing with the sub bolt 75 as fulcrum.  The components indicated at 95 are springs, numeral 96 denotes a lid, the components indicated at 97 are decorative caps, and the components indicated at 99 are guide grooves which are open even after mounting the lid 96 to the disks 92 to permit movement of the operating lever 74.<br>
In this example, since the operating lever 74 is disposed below and behind the seat, the fuel tank (see<br><br>
FIG. 3) disposed in front of and along the seat pipes 86 can be made sufficiently large in size.<br>
FIG. 5 is a combined assembling diagram and operation diagram of the ratchet mechanism adopted in the present invention.  With the lower opening 94 closed by the lid 96, there is obtained a good appearance because the lock portion 67 is closed with the lid 96.<br>
The locking pawls 66 come into engagement with the first teeth 61 and this engaged state is maintained under the biasing force of the springs 95.  With the ratchet, by merely pushing up the seat holding plate 36 side it is possible to make switching from a horizontal position (sitting position) indicated by a solid line to an intermediate inclined position, then further up to a maximum inclined position, with no likelihood of return to the original state.<br>
Return can be made by depressing the operating lever 74 to the phantom line position against the springs 95 to disengage the locking pawls 66 from the first to third teeth 61 to 63.<br>
Since in this example the operating lever 74 is formed long in the transverse direction of the vehicle body, it can be operated smoothly.<br>
18<br><br><br>
Next, reference will be made below to a combined structure of the seat holding plate 36 with the seat 37.<br>
FIG. 6 is an exploded diagram of the seat holding plate and the seat, in which the seat 37 is allowed to face above the seat holding plate 36, while a channel-like metal piece 81 is allowed to face below the seat holding plate 36 and is fixed to a bottom of the seat 37 with bolts 82.<br>
Then, an adjusting screw 44 is fitted in the channel-like metal piece 81 upward from below. <br>
FIG. 7 is a diagram explaining a sliding motion of the seat related to the present invention.  In the same figure, by loosening the adjusting screw 44, the seat 37 can be moved forward or backward (right or left in the figure) as desired.  Numeral 83 denotes a stopper, which functions to prevent the channel-like metal piece 81 from coming off the seat holding plate 36.<br>
The following description is now provided about the operation of the low floor type two-wheeled vehicle constructed as above.<br>
FIG. 8 is an operation diagram in a standing ride.<br><br>
In the same figure, the seat 37 is adjusted to its maximum inclined position and is allowed to slide (to a desired position between solid and phantom lines) to match the rider"s constitution and desire, and then the adjusting screw 44 is tightened.  The rider, indicated at M, leans on the seat 37 while allowing his or her hip to contact the seat lightly and drives the two-wheeled vehicle 10 in this state.  At this time it is preferable that the angle of the seat be set in the range of between 45° and 60°.<br>
FIG. 9 is an operation diagram of the vehicle on which the rider rides in a half-sitting posture.  The seat 37 is adjusted to its intermediate inclined position and is allowed to slide to match the rider"s constitution and desire, then the adjusting screw 44 is tightened.  The rider M sits on the seat 37 lightly and the two-wheeled vehicle 10 is traveled in this state. At this time it is desirable that the seat angle be set in the range of 15° to 30°.  This riding style is suitable for a small-statured person.<br><br>
FIG. 10 is an operation diagram of the vehicle on which the rider rides in a sitting posture.  The seat 37<br><br>
is adjusted to the sitting position and is allowed to slide forward or backward (right or left in the figure) to match the rider"s constitution and desire, then the adjusting screw 44 is tightened.  The rider M sits deep on the seat  21  and  in   this  state drives   the  vehicle  10.<br>
What is important is that the rider M can stretch his or her knee any time by putting his or her foot on the step means 85.<br>
Further, the rider can insert his or her toe tips below the step means 85 and put them on the curved step portions 48.<br>
It follows that the step means 85 can be added while keeping the step floor 25 wide.<br><br>
The shape of the seat supporting frames is not specially limited, but may be any other shape than the illustrated pipes, for example the frames may be plates or cast products.<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
According to the present invention constructed as above there are attained the following effects.<br>
In  claim 1, in  a  low floor  type  two-wheeled vehicle with a low step floor disposed between a bar handle and a<br><br>
seat, a fuel tank, a power unit, and an electric appliances box are disposed concentratively around seat supporting frames which support the seat in such a manner that the fuel tank is disposed in front of and along the seat supporting frames, the power unit is  mounted   to lower portions of rear sides of the seat supporting frames, and the electric appliances box is mounted to upper portions of the rear sides of the seat supporting frames.<br>
As a result, it is possible to select a desired rear wheel diameter and a mass balance in the vehicle body can be set freely and satisfactorily.<br>
In claim 2, a main frame is composed of an inclined portion and a horizontal portion, and a head pipe and the seat supporting frames are added to the main frame to constitute a body frame, so that the body frame is simple and mass concentration becomes more marked.<br>
In claim 3, the horizontal portion of the main frame is almost covered with the step floor, while the inclined portion of the main frame and the seat supporting frames are  exposed.  Thus, since the inclined portion and the seat supporting frames are uncovered, the greater part of<br>
