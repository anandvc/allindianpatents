PRODUCT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to detergent compositions comprising a fragrant reaction product. Particularly, the present invention relates to detergent compositions comprising a fragrant reaction product produced by reacting an amine and a perfume component.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Laundry and cleaning products are well-known in the art. However, consumer acceptance of these products is determined not only by the performance achieved with these products but also by the aesthetics associated therewith. The perfume components are therefore an important aspect of the successful formulation of such commercial products.<br>
Consumers prefer that the laundered fabrics maintain the pleasing fragrance over time. When wearing these fabrics, they may feel comfortable if the fragrance lasts a long time. Indeed, perfume additives make laundry compositions more aesthetically pleasing to the consumer, and in some cases the perfume imparts a pleasant fragrance to fabrics treated therewith.<br>
Further, after drying fabrics under the sun, fabrics obtain a "sun-dried type" of odor. Consumers often prefer this to a standard perfume odor. Also they often consider fabrics with these odors to be cleaner. Because consumers like the odor, they like to dry fabrics under the sun. In some countries, however, consumer cannot dry their fabrics outside because the air is not clean, or there is<br><br>
too much rain.   As a result, they have to dry their fabrics indoors and cannot expect to enjoy this benefit of having a "sun-dried type" of odor on their fabrics.<br>
A detergent composition comprising a perfume which can provide a "sun-dried type" of odor has now been found.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a detergent composition comprising a fragrant reaction product produced by reacting a primary amine compound and a perfume component which is selected from the group consisting of C6-C12 aliphatic aldehydes, C6-C12 acyclic terpene aldehydes and mixtures thereof, wherein the primary amine compound has an Odor Intensity Index that isless than the Odor Intensity Index of a 1% solution of methylanthranilate in dipropylene glycol, and the fragrant reaction product has a Dry Surface Odor Index of more than 5.<br>
In a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a detergent composition comprising from about 1% to about 60% by weight of a detersive surfactant, from about 0% to about 60% by weight of a detergent builder and from about 0.0001% to about 10% by weight of a fragrant reaction product produced by reacting a primary amine compound and a perfume component wherein the primary amine compound has an Odor Intensity Index less than the Odor Intensity Index of a 1% solution of methyanthranilate in dipropylene glycol, and the fragrant reaction product has a Dry Surface Odor Index of more than 5.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a detergent composition comprising a fragrant reaction product produced by reacting a primary amine compound and a perfume component which is selected from the group consisting of C6-C14 aliphatic aldehydes, C6-C14 acyclic terpene aldehydes and mixtures thereof, wherein the primary amine compound has an Odor Intensity Index less than the Odor Intensity Index of a 1% solution of methylanthranilate in dipropylene glycol, and the fragrant reaction product has a Dry Surface Odor Index of more than 5, and the detergent composition is packed within a closed packaging system having a moisture vapor transmission rate of less than 50g/m2/24 hours.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
While the specification concludes with claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the invention, it is believed the present invention will be better understood from the following description.<br>
All percentages are by weight of total composition unless specifically stated otherwise.<br>
All ratios are weight ratios unless specifically stated otherwise.<br>
Definitions<br>
As used herein, "comprising " means that other steps and other ingredients which do not affect the end result can be added. This term encompasses the terms " consisting of" and " consisting essentially of.<br>
All cited references are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Citation of any reference is not an admission regarding any determination as to its availability as prior art to the claimed invention.<br>
As used herein, the term "detergent composition" or "detergent" is intended to designate any of the agents conventionally used for removing soil, such as general household detergents or laundry detergents of the synthetic or soap type.<br>
FRAGRANT REACTION PRODUCT<br>
The present invention is directed to a fragrant reaction products that produces a "sun-dried odor." This fragment reaction product is useful in a cleaning composition for washing a fabric and/or a hard surface. As used herein the term "cleaning composition" includes both a detergent composition which provides a fabric cleaning benefit and a hard surface cleaning benefit. Cleaning compositions are typically used for laundering fabrics and cleaning hard surfaces such as dishes, floors, tiling, bathrooms, toilets, kitchens and other surfaces. The cleaning compositions may comprise from about 0.0001% to about 10%, preferably from about 0.001% to about 5%, and more preferably from about 0.01% to about 2% by weight of the fragrant reaction products of the present invention.<br><br>
The fragrant reaction product is produced by reacting a compound containing a primary amine compound and a perfume component which is selected from the group consisting of a C6-C14 aliphatic aldehyde, a C6-C14 acyclic terpene aldehyde and a mixture thereof. Preferably, the perfume component is selected from the group consisting of citral; neral; iso-citral; dihydro citral; cironellal; octanal; nonanal; decanal; undecanal; dodecanal; tridecanal; 2-methyl decanal; methyl nonyl acetaldehyde; 2-nonen-1-al; 2-decanal; undecenal; undecylenic aldehyde; 2, 6 dimethyl octanal; 2, 6, 10-trimethyl-9-undecen-1-al; trimethyl undecanal; dodecenal; melonal; 2-methyl octanal; 3, 5, 5, trimethyl hexanal and a mixture thereof.<br>
When a fabric is washed with a detergent composition containing the fragrant reaction product herein, a "sun dried odor" is produced on a fabric even though the fabric is not actually dried in the sun. The reaction mixture is formed by selecting the starting aldehydes such that at least one of them is present naturally in cotton fabrics after the fabric is dried in the sun and thus, are a component of the sun dried odor.<br>
The fragrant reaction products of this invention can comprise mixtures of various different products produced by different reactions according to the present invention. These mixtures of fragrant reaction products can be made separately and then admixed, or they can be produced simultaneously by reacting one or more primary amine with one or more perfume components. For example, a preferred fragrant reaction products comprises, by weight : 30% of the product of a reaction between ethyl 4-amino benzoate ("EAB") and 2-nonen-1-al; 10% of the product of reaction between EAB and methyl nonyl acetaldehyde; 20% of the product of reaction between EAB and undecylenic aldehyde; 10% of the product of reaction between EAB and lauric aldehyde; and 30% of the product of reaction between EAB and citral.<br>
A        Primary amine<br>
The primary amine compounds suitable for use in the present invention are characterized by their Odor Intensity Index, which is preferably less than the Odor Intensity Index of a 1% solution of methylanthranilate in dipropylene glycol. The primary amine is non-volatile, meaning that the primary amine has a boiling point of at least about 125 °C, and preferably of from about 150 °C to about 300 °C.    The primary amine useful herein also has a molecular weight of at least<br><br>
about 80 g/mol, preferably from about 100 g/mol to about 30,000 g/mol, and more preferably from about 125 g/mol to about 25,000 g/mol. Such boiling point and molecular weight information for a primary amine is easily available from standard texts, or from the supplier of the primary amine. The primary amine useful herein includes primary amines having linear, branched, and/or cyclic chains, and may be saturated, unsaturated, polymeric, or aromatic primary amines. Unsaturated, polymeric, and aromatic primary amines are especially preferred herein. Unsaturated, polymeric, and aromatic primary amines containing both an alkoxy and a carboxylate ester group in their structures are even more preferred. A primary amine possessing multiple reactive amine groups is also useful herein, and preferred.<br>
Preferred polymeric primary amines include polyethyleneimines commercially available as "Lupasols" from BASF, including Lupasol FG (MW 800), G20wfv (MW 1,300), PR8515 (MW 2,000), WF (MW 25,000), FC (MW 800), G20 (MW 1,300), G35 (MW 1,200), G100 (MW 2,000), HF (MW 25,000), P (MW 750,000), PS (MW 750,000), SK (MW 2,000,000), SNA (MW 1,000,000). Especially preferred primary amines useful herein include meta-, para- and ortho-amino methyl benzoate, n-ethyl amino benzoate, Kymene 557H and Kymene 450 (polymeric amines formed of repeating polyamide and reactive azetidine and epoxide moieties from Hercules), Lupasol HF, and mixtures thereof. Primary amines useful herein are available from, for example, BASF AG (Ludwigschafen, Germany); Bush Boake Allen, Ltd. (London, Great Britain); Haarmann &amp; Reimer GmbH (Holzminden, Germany); and Hercules, Inc. (Wilmington, Delaware, USA).<br>
Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the free electron pair of the primary amine's nitrogen neucleophilically attacks the carbonyl carbon of the perfume component, in the presence of an acid catalyst, to form the Schiff Base reaction product and water. The acid catalyst acts as a carbonyl activator, which significantly increases the reaction rate. The Schiff Base reaction product has a desirable odor and may be activated by a change in external conditions, such as pH, temperature, and moisture, so as to deliver a high level of odor impact when needed, e.g., when a clothing item is worn. This results in a controlled release of perfume from the laundered item. Accordingly, such perfumes possess distinct advantages over traditional perfumes, which constantly release their scent, until they are depleted.     For example, less<br><br>
perfume may be employed, while still providing a consumer-acceptable odor. As perfumes may be very expensive, this may significantly reduce costs.<br>
Furthermore, because of the physical and chemical properties of perfume raw materials, many desirable scents cannot be deposited on fabrics like the sun dry order via traditional perfumes. This way of controlled release facilitates the deposition of such scents on dry fabrics.<br>
Odor Intensity Index method<br>
As used herein, the term "Odor Intensity Index", is defined by a test whereby the pure chemicals being tested are diluted at 1% by weight in dipropylene glycol, an odor-free solvent. Smelling strips, or so called "blotters", are dipped and presented to an expert panelist for evaluation. Theexpert panelists are assessors trained for at least six months in odor grading and whose gradings are regularly checked for accuracy and reproducibility versus a reference on an on-going basis. For each amine compound, the panelist is presented two blotters: one reference (methyl anthranilate, unknown to the panelist) and the sample. The panelst is asked to rank both smelling strips on a 0-5 odor intensity scale, where 0 indicates that no odor is detected, 5 indicates that very strong odor is detected.<br>
The following represents the Odor Intensity Index of an amine compound suitable for use in the present invention, according to the above procedure. In each case, the numbers are arithmetic averages from 5 expert panellists and the results are statisticallysignificant at a 95% confidence level:<br>
Methylanthranilate 1 % (reference)	3.4<br>
Ethyl-4-aminobenzoate (EAB) 1 %	0.9<br>
B-Perfume<br>
The perfume component of the present invention is selected from the group consisting of C6-C14 aliphatic aldehydes, C6-C14 acyclic terpene aldehyde and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the perfume component of the present invention is selected from C8-C12 aliphatic aldehydes, C8-C12 acyclic terpene aldehydes and mixtures thereof. Most preferably, the perfume component of the present invention is selected from the group consisting of citral;<br><br>
neral; iso-citral; dihydro citral; citronellal; octanal; nonanal; decanal; undecanal; dodecanal; tridecanal; 2-methyl decanal; methyl nonyl acetaldehyde; 2-nonen-1-al; decanal; undecenal; undecylenic aldehyde; 2, 6 dimethyl octanal; 2, 6, 10-trimethyl-9-undecen-1-al; trimethyl undecanal; dodecenal; melonal; 2-methyl octanal; 3, 5, 5, trimethyl hexanal and mixtures thereof. The preferable mixtures are, for example, a mixture comprising 30% by weight of 2-nonen-1-al, 40% by weight of undecylenic aldehyde and 30% by weight of citral or a mixture comprising 20% by weight of methyl nonyl acetaldehyde, 25% by weight of lauric aldehyde, 35% by weight of decanal and 20% by weight of 2-nonen-1-al.<br>
Isomers of these components are also suitable for use herein.<br>
The cleaning composition of the present invention may further comprise other perfumes. Other perfumes can provide an additional fragrance to the cleaning product and/or can provide a fragrance during a different stage of the washing process. Other perfumes are conventionally added to the cleaning composition as a spray-on component during the manufacturing process. When adding other perfumes, the ratio of the other perfumes to the fragrant reaction product must be controlled. If the cleaning composition comprises too low a proportion of the fragrant reaction product, the desired "sun-dried odor" may not be noticeable. However, if the cleaning composition comprises too low proportion of other perfumes, the cleaning composition may not have a high enough overall odor impact. The weight ratio of the other perfumes to fragrant reaction product useful herein is from about 100:1 to about 16:100. Preferably, the ratio is from about 30:1 to about 1:5.<br>
C-Process<br>
Preparation of the fragrant reaction product is as follows. The primary amine compound reacts with perfume components and yield "inline". The imine can easily be prepared by a condensation reaction between a primary amine compound and a carbonyl compound in the perfume component..<br>
A typical reaction profile is as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br>
α,ß-unsaturated ketones do not only condense with an amine to form imines, but can also further undergo a competitive 1,4-addition to form a (J-aminoketones.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
By means of this simple method, compound and composition containing said compounds are made which achieve a delayed release of the active ingredient.<br>
While not required herein, it is highly preferred that the perfume ingredient is present in an equimolar amount to the reactive amine group.<br>
D-Release mechanism<br>
The present invention provides for a delayed release of the perfume component. While not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the release occurs by the following mechanisms:<br>
For an imine compound, the perfume components are released by breaking the imine bond, leading to the release of the perfume component from the primary amine compound. This can be achieved by either hydrolysis, photochemical cleavage, oxidative cleavage, or enzymatic cleavage in fabric or hard surface.<br>
The release of the perfume component may be accelerated by, for example, ironing, tumble-drying, and/or wearing the treated fabric.<br>
E. Dry Surface Odor Intensity Index<br>
The fragrant reaction product(s) of reaction between the primary amine compound and the perfume component provides a dry surface Odor Intensity Index of more than 5, preferably at least 10.<br>
By Dry Surface Odor Index, it is meant that the product of reaction provides a Delta of more than 5, wherein Delta is the difference between the Odor Index of the dry surface treated with the product(s) of the present invention and the Odor Index of the dry surface treated with only the perfume raw material.<br>
For the above Dry Surface Odor Index, the product of the present invention suitable for use in the present invention needs to fulfill at least one of the following two tests. Preferred the product of the present invention suitable for use in the present invention fulfill both test.<br>
For the test sample: 20g of the cleaning composition herein, having a total fragrant reaction product level of 0.1% by weight was added to a 30 liter twin tub clothes washing machine. Two 100% cotton terry-cloth swatches were added to the washing machine. The remainder of the 1.3kg laundry load was formed of cotton T-shirts, bath towels, and acrylic fabrics. The load was washed in 30 °C water, according to the regular washing cycle.<br>
For the control, a cleaning composition containing the same weight level of an unreacted perfume component was used, on two control swatches. The cleaning composition dosage, fabric load, washing cycle, etc. for the control and the sample are otherwise identical.<br>
Within 45 min to 1 hour after the end of the washing cycle, one of the fabric swatches is hung on a line and dried for 24 hours , away from any possible contamination. Unless specified, all drying takes place indoors. During drying, the ambient conditions are at a temperature between 18-25°C and between 40-80% humidity. The other fabric swatch is placed in a tumble drier and undergoes a 15 min drying cycle, and put aside until 24 hours later.<br>
Odor is assessed by an expert panelist who smells and grades the fabrics. A 0-100 scale is used for all fabric odor gradings. The grading scale is as follows:<br>
100 = extremely strong perfume odor<br>
75 = very strong perfume odor<br>
50 = strong odor<br>
40 = moderate perfume odor<br>
30 = slight perfume odor<br>
20 = weak perfume odor<br>
10 = very weak perfume odor<br>
0 = no odor<br>
A difference of more than 5 grades after one day and/or 7 days between (a cleaning composition containing) the fragrant reaction product and (a cleaning composition containing) the unreacted perfume component is statistically significant. A difference of 10 grades or more after one day and/or 7 days represents a step-change. In other words, the fragrant reaction product useful herein has a difference of at least 5 grades, preferably at least 10 grades, from the unreacted perfume component after 24 hours. Incorporation of the fragrant reaction production the cleaning compositions can conveniently be carried out, if necessary, by conventional means. Preferably, the fragrant reaction product is sprayed-onto, encapsulated and added to, dry added to , or agglomerated with a scented or unscented product base. The encapsulated fragrant reaction product may be encapsulated, e.g. as described in GB 1 464 616, or in cyciodextrin. Agglomeration preferably take place with a non-ionic surfactant and sodium carbonate. Preferably, the fragrant reaction product is pre-formed before incorporation into the cleaning compositions. In other words, the perfume component and the amine compound are first reacted together to obtain the fragrant reaction product and the incorporated into the cleaning compositions. Pre-forming allows one to better control the yield, quantity, purity, etc. of the fragrant reaction product, and avoids undesirable side reactions.<br>
F. Closed packaging system<br>
The detergent of the present invention is preferably packed within a closed packaging system having a moisture vapour transmission rate of less than about 40g/m2/24 hours. The moisture vapour transmission rate is preferable less than about 30g/m2/24 hours, and more preferably, less than about 20g/m2/24 hours.<br>
A closed packaging system may help maintain the fragrant reaction production a stable condition in the cleaning composition . A lower moisture vapour transmission rate reduces undesirable reverse reactions which may occur. These reverse reactions may cause changes in the cleaning composition's appearances and/or odor, and reduce its ability to provide an optimal sun-dried odor impact on dry fabrics.<br>
Any appropriate packaging material can be used for the closed packaging system. Preferably, the packaging material is selected from the group consisting of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), laminated paper, coated paper, sandwich paper, aluminium and the like.<br>
Detersive surfactant<br>
The detergent compositions of the present invention includes surfactants wherein the surfactant can be selected from the group consisting of nonionic and/or anionic and/or cationic and/or amphoiytic and/or zwitterionic and/or semi-polar surfactants.<br>
The surfactant is typically present at a level of from about 0.01% to about 60% by weight. More preferred levels of incorporation are from about 1% to about 35% by weight, most preferably from about 1% to about 30% by weight of detergent compositions in accord with the invention.<br>
The surfactant is preferably formulated to be compatible with enzyme components present in the composition. In liquid or gel compositions the surfactant is most preferably formulated such that it promotes, or at least does not degrade, the stability of any enzyme in these compositions.<br>
Preferred surfactants to be used according to the present invention comprise as a surfactant one or more of the nonionic and/or anionic surfactants described herein.<br>
Polyethylene, polypropylene, and polybutylene oxide condensates of alkyl phenols are suitable for use as the nonionic surfactant of the present invention, with the polyethylene oxide condensates being preferred. These compounds include the condensation products of alkyl phenols having an alkyl group containing from about 6 to about 14 carbon atoms, preferably from about 8 to about 14 carbon atoms, in either a straight-chain or branched-chain configuration with the alkylene oxide. In a preferred embodiment, the ethylene oxide is present in an amount equal to from about 2 to about 25 moles, more preferably from<br>
about 3 to about 15 moles, of ethylene oxide per mole of alkyl phenol. Commercially available nonionic surfactants of this type include Igepal™ CO-630, marketed by the GAF Corporation; and Triton™ X-45, X-114, X-100 and X-102, all marketed by the Rohm &amp; Haas Company. These surfactants are commonly referred to as alkylphenol alkoxylates (e.g., alkyl phenol ethoxylates).<br>
The condensation products of primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols with from about 1 to about 25 moles of ethylene oxide are suitable for use as the nonionic surfactant of the nonionic surfactant s of the present invention. The alkyl chain of the aliphatic alcohol can either be straight or branched, primary or secondary, and generally contains from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms. Preferred are the condensation products of alcohol having an alkyl group containing from about 8 to about 20 carbon atoms, more preferably from about 10 to about 18 carbon atoms, with from about 2 to about 10 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol.

polysaccharide, e.g. a polyglycoside, hydrophilic group containing from about 1.3 to about 10, preferably from about 1.3 to about 3, most preferably from about 1.3 to about 2.7 saccharide units. Any reducing saccharide containing 5 or 6 carbon atoms can be used, e.g., glucose, galactose and galactosyl moieties can be substituted for the glucosyl moieties (optionally the hydrophobic group is attached at the 2-, 3-, 4-, etc. positions thus giving a glucose or galactose as opposed to a glucoside or galactoside). The intersaccharide bonds can be, e.g., between the one position of the additional saccharide units and the 2-, 3-, 4-, and/or 6- positions on the preceding saccharide units.<br>

ADDITIONAL INGREDIENTS Builders<br>
The detergent composition of the present invention can optionally comprise builders.<br>
The level of builder can vary widely depending upon the end use of the composition and its desired physical form. When present, the compositions will typically comprise at least 1% builder, preferably from 1% to 80%. Liquid formulations typically comprise from 5% to 50%, more typically 5% to 30%, by weight, of detergent builder. Granular formulations typically comprise from 1 % to 80%, more typically from 5% to 50% by weight, of the detergent builder. Lower or higher levels of builder, however, are not meant to be excluded.<br>
Inorganic or P-containing detergent builders include, but are not limited to, the alkali metal, ammonium and alkanolammonium salts of polyphosphates (exemplified by the tripolyphosphates, pyrophosphates, and glassy polymeric meta-phosphates), phosphonates, phytic acid, silicates, carbonates (including bicarbonates and sesquicarbonates), sulphates, and aluminosilicates. However, non-phosphate builders are required in some locales. Importantly, the compositions herein function surprisingly well even in the presence of the so-called "weak" builders (as compared with phosphates) such as citrate, or in the so-called "underbuilt" situation that may occur with zeolite or layered silicate builders.<br>
Examples of silicate builders are the alkali metal silicates, particularly those having a Si02:Na20 ratio in the range 1.0:1 to 3.2:1 and layered silicates,<br>
such as the layered sodium silicates described in U.S. 4,664,839.   NaSKS-6 is<br>
the trademark for a crystalline layered silicate marketed by Hoechst (commonly<br>
abbreviated herein as "SKS-6"). Unlike zeolite builders, the Na SKS-6 silicate builder does not contain aluminum. NaSKS-6 has the delta-Na2Si05 morphology<br>
form of layered silicate. It can be prepared by methods such as those described in DE-A-3,417,649 and DE-A-3,742,043. SKS-6 is a highly preferred layered silicate for use herein, but other such layered silicates, such as those having the general formula NaMSixO2x+1yH2O wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, x is a<br>
number from 1.9 to 4, preferably 2, and y is a number from 0 to 20, preferably 0<br>
can be used herein.    Various other layered silicates from Hoechst include<br>
NaSKS-5, NaSKS-7 and NaSKS-11, as the alpha, beta and gamma forms. As noted above, the delta-Na2SiO5 (NaSKS-6 form) is most preferred for use herein<br>
Other silicates may also be useful such as for example magnesium silicate, which can serve as a crispening agent in granular formulations, as a stabilizing agent for oxygen bleaches, and as a component of suds control systems.<br>
Examples of carbonate builders are the alkaline earth and alkali metal carbonates as disclosed in DE 2,321,001.<br>
Aluminosilicate builders are useful in the present invention. Aluminosilicate builders are of great importance in most currently marketed heavy duty granular detergent compositions, and can also be a significant builder ingredient in liquid detergent formulations. Aluminosilicate builders include those having the empirical formula: Mz/n[(AIO2)z(SiO2)y]xH20<br>
wherein z and y are integers usually of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to y is in the range from 1.0 to 0, and x is an integer from 0 to 264, and M is a Group IA or IIA element, e.g., Na, K, Mg, Ca with valence n.<br>
Useful aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are commercially available. These aluminosilicates can be crystalline or amorphous in structure and can be naturally-occurring aluminosilicates or synthetically derived. A method for producing aluminosilicate ion exchange materials is disclosed in U.S. 3,985,669. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials useful herein are available under the designations Zeolite A, Zeolite P (B), Zeolite MAP and Zeolite X. In an especially preferred embodiment, the crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange material has the formula: <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein x is from 20 to 30, especially 27. This material is known as Zeolite A. Dehydrated zeolites (x = 0 - 10) may also be used herein. Preferably, the aluminosilicate has a particle size of 0.1-10 microns in diameter.<br>
Organic detergent builders suitable for the purposes of the present invention include, but are not restricted to, a wide variety of polycarboxylate compounds. As used herein, "polycarboxylate" refers to compounds having a plurality of carboxylate groups, preferably at least 3 carboxylates. Polycarboxylate builder can generally be added to the composition in acid form, but can also be added in the form of a neutralized salt. When utilized in salt form, alkali metals, such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, or alkanolammonium salts are preferred.<br>
Included among the polycarboxylate builders are a variety of categories of useful materials. One important category of polycarboxylate builders encompasses the ether polycarboxylates, including oxydisuccinate, as disclosed in Berg, U.S. 3,128,287, U.S. 3,635,830. See also "TMS/TDS" builders of U.S. 4,663,071. Suitable ether polycarboxylates also include cyclic compounds, particularly alicyclic compounds, such as those described in U.S. 3,923,679; 3,835,163; 4,158,635; 4,120,874 and 4,102,903.<br>
Other useful detergency builders include the ether hydroxypolycarboxylates, copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethylene or vinyl methyl ether, 1, 3, 5-trihydroxy benzene-2, 4, 6-trisulphonic acid, and carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, the various alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of polyacetic acids such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and nitriiotriacetic acid, as well as polycarboxylates such as mellitic acid, pyromellitic, succinic acid, oxydisuccinic acid, polymaleic acid, benzene 1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, and soluble salts thereof.<br>
Citrate builders, e.g., citric acid and soluble salts thereof (particularly sodium salt), are polycarboxylate builders of particular importance for heavy duty liquid detergent formulations due to their availability from renewable resources and their biodegradability. Citrates can also be used in granular compositions, especially in combination with zeolite and/or layered silicate builders. Oxydisuccinates are also especially useful in such compositions and combinations.<br>
Also suitable in the detergent compositions of the present invention are the<br>
3,3-dicarboxy-4-oxa-1,6-hexanedioates and the related compounds disclosed in U.S. 4,566,984.    Useful succinic acid builders include the C5-C20 alkyl and<br>
alkenyl succinic acids and salts thereof. A particularly preferred compound of this type is dodecenylsuccinic acid. Specific examples of succinate builders include: laurylsuccinate, myristylsuccinate, palmitylsuccinate, 2-dodecenylsuccinate (preferred), 2-pentadecenylsuccinate, and the like. Laurylsuccinates are the preferred builders of this group, and are described in EP 0,200,263.<br>
Other suitable polycarboxylates are disclosed in U.S 4,144,226 and in U.S.<br>
3,308,067. See also U.S. 3,723,322.<br>
Fatty acids, e.g., C12-C18 monocarboxylic acids such as oleic acid and/or<br>
its salts, can also be incorporated into the compositions alone, or in combination<br>
with the aforesaid builders, especially citrate and/or the succinate builders, to provide additional builder activity. Such use of fatty acids will generally result in a diminution of sudsing, which should be taken into account by the formulator.<br>
In situations where phosphorus-based builders can be used, and especially in the formulation of bars used for hand-laundering operations, the various alkali metal phosphates such as the well-known sodium tripolyphosphates, sodium pyrophosphate and sodium orthophosphate can be used. Phosphonate builders such as ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphonate and other known phosphonates (see, for example, U.S. Patents 3,159,581; 3,213,030; 3,422,021; 3,400,148 and 3,422,137) can also be used.<br>
Bleaching Compounds - Bleaching Agents and Bleach Activators<br>
The detergent compositions of herein may optionally contain bleaching agents or bleaching compositions containing a bleaching agent and one or more bleach activators. When present, bleaching agents will typically be at levels of from 1% to 30%, more typically from 5% to 20%, of the detergent composition, especially for fabric laundering. If present, the amount of bleach activators will typically be from 0.1% to 60%, more typically from 0.5% to 40% of the bleaching composition comprising the bleaching agent-plus-bleach activator.<br>
The bleaching agents used herein can be any of the bleaching agents useful for detergent compositions in textile cleaning or other cleaning purposes that are now known or become known. These include oxygen bleaches as well as other bleaching agents like hypochlorite bleaching agents. Perborate bleaches, e.g., sodium perborate (e.g., mono- or tetra-hydrate) can be used herein. When hypochlorite is used, a highly preferred hypochlorite bleaching component is an alkali metal hypochlorite. Although alkali metal hypochlorites are preferred, other hypochlorite compounds may also be used herein and can be selected from calcium and magnesium hypochlorite. A preferred alkali metal hypochlorite for use herein is sodium hypochlorite.<br>
Another category of bleaching agent that can be used without restriction encompasses percarboxylic acid bleaching agents and salts thereof. Suitable examples of this class of agents include magnesium monoperoxyphthalate hexahydrate, the magnesium salt of metachloro perbenzoic acid, 4-nonylamino-4-oxoperoxybutyric acid and diperoxydodecanedioic acid. Such bleaching agents are disclosed in U.S 4,483,781, U.S 740,446, EP 0,133,354, and U.S 4,412,934.<br>
Highly preferred bleaching agents also include 6-nonylamino-6-oxoperoxycaproic acid as described in U.S 4,634,551.<br>
Peroxygen bleaching agents can also be used. Suitable peroxygen bleaching compounds include sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate and equivalent "percarbonate" bleaches, sodium pyrophosphate peroxyhydrate, urea peroxyhydrate, and sodium peroxide. Persulfate bleach (e.g., OXONE, manufactured commercially by DuPont) can also be used.<br>
A preferred percarbonate bleach comprises dry particles having an average particle size in the range from 500 micrometers to 1,000 micrometers, not more than 10% by weight of said particles being smaller than 200 micrometers and not more than 10% by weight of said particles being larger than 1,250 micrometers. Optionally, the percarbonate can be coated with silicate, borate or water-soluble surfactants. Percarbonate is available from various commercial sources such as FMC, Solvay and Tokai Denka.<br>
Mixtures of bleaching agents can also be used.<br>
Peroxygen bleaching agents, the perborates, the percarbonates, etc., are preferably combined with bleach activators, which lead to the in situ production in aqueous solution (i.e., during the washing process) of the peroxy acid corresponding to the bleach activator. Various non-limiting examples of activators are disclosed in U.S 4,915,854, and U.S 4,412,934. The nonanoyloxybenzene sulfonate (NOBS), 3,5,5-tri-methyl hexanoyl oxybenzene sulfonate (ISONOBS) and tetraacetyl ethylene diamine (TAED) activators are typical, and mixtures thereof can also be used. See also U.S. 4,634,551 for other typical bleaches and activators useful herein. Highly preferred amido-derived bleach activators are those of the formulae:<br>
R1N(R5)C(O)R2C(O)L or R1C(O)N(R5)R2c(O)L wherein R1 is an alkyl group containing from 6 to 12 carbon atoms, R2 is an alkylene containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, R5 is H or alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl containing from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and L is any suitable leaving group. A leaving group is any group that is displaced from the bleach activator as a consequence of the nucleophilic attack on the bleach activator by the perhydrolysis anion. A preferred leaving group is phenyl sulfonate.<br>
Preferred examples of bleach activators of the above formulae include (6-octanamido-caproyl)oxybenzenesulfonate,      (6-nonanamidocaproyl)oxybenzene<br>
sulfonate, (6-decanamido-caproyl)oxybenzenesulfonate, and mixtures thereof as described in U.S. Patent 4,634,551, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Another   class   of   bleach   activators   comprises   the   benzoxazin-type activators disclosed by Hodge et al in U.S. Patent 4,966,723.  A highly preferred activator of the benzoxazin-type is: O<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Still another class of preferred bleach activators includes the acyl lactam activators, especially acyl caprolactams and acyl valerolactams of the formulae:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R6 is H or an alkyl, aryl, alkoxyaryl, or alkaryl group containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Highly preferred lactam activators include benzoyl caprolactam, octanoyl caprolactam, 3,5,5-trimethylhexanoyl caprolactam, nonanoyl caprolactam, decanoyl caprolactam, undecenoyl caprolactam, benzoyl valerolactam, octanoyl valerolactam, decanoyl valerolactam, undecenoyl valerolactam, nonanoyl valerolactam, 3,5,5-trimethylhexanoyl valerolactam and mixtures thereof. See also U.S. Patent 4,545,784, issued to Sanderson, October 8, 1985, incorporated herein by reference, which discloses acyl caprolactams, including benzoyl caprolactam, adsorbed into sodium perborate.<br>
Bleaching agents other than oxygen bleaching agents are also known in the art and can be utilized herein. One type of non-oxygen bleaching agent of particular interest includes photoactivated bleaching agents such as the sulfonated zinc and/or aluminum phthalocyanines. See U.S. 4,033,718. If used, detergent compositions will typically contain from 0.025% to 1.25%, by weight, of such bleaches, especially sulfonate zinc phthalocyanine.<br>
If desired, the bleaching compounds can be catalyzed by means of a manganese compound. Such compounds are well-known in the art and include, for example, the manganese-based catalysts disclosed in U.S. 5,246,621, U.S.<br><br>
5,244,594; U.S. 5,194,416; U.S. 5,114,606; and EP 549,271 A1, 549.272A1,<br>

Soil Release Agent<br>
In the present invention, an optional soil release agent can be added. Typical levels of incorporation in the composition are from 0% to 10%, preferably from 0.2% to 5%, of a soil release agent. Preferably, such a soil release agent is a polymer.<br>
Soil Release agents are desirably used in fabric softening compositions of the instant invention. Any polymeric soil release agent known to those skilled in the art can optionally be employed in the compositions of this invention. Polymeric soil release agents are characterized by having both hydrophilic segments, to hydrophilize the surface of hydrophobic fibers, such as polyester and nylon, and hydrophobic segments, to deposit upon hydrophobic fibers and remain adhered thereto through completion of washing and rinsing cycles and, thus, serve as an anchor for the hydrophilic segments. This can enable stains occurring subsequent to treatment with the soil release agent to be more easily cleaned in later washing procedures.<br>
If utilized, soil release agents will generally comprise from about 0.01% to about 10.0%, by weight, of the detergent compositions herein, typically from about 0.1% to about 5%, preferably from about 0.2% to about 3.0%.<br><br>
The following, all included herein by reference, describe soil release polymers suitable for use in the present invention.

Enzyme<br>
The compositions and processes herein can optionally employ one or more enzymes such as lipases, proteases, cellulase, amylases and peroxidases. A preferred enzyme for use herein is a cellulase enzyme. Indeed, this type of enzyme will further provide a color care benefit to the treated fabric. Cellulases usable herein include both bacterial and fungal types, preferably having a pH optimum between 5 and 9.5. U.S. 4,435,307 discloses suitable fungal cellulases from Humicola insolens or Humicola strain DSM1800 or a cellulase 212-producing fungus belonging to the genus Aeromonas, and cellulase extracted from the hepatopancreas of a marine mollusk, Dolabella Auricula Solander. Suitable cellulases are also disclosed in GB-A-2.075.028; GB-A-2.095.275 and DE-OS-2.247.832. CAREZYME® and CELLUZYME® .(Novo) are especially useful. Other suitable cellulases are also disclosed in WO 91/17243 to Novo, WO 96/34092, WO 96/34945 and EP-A-0,739,982. In practical terms for current<br><br>
commercial preparations, typical amounts are up to 5 mg by weight, more typically 0.01 mg to 3 mg, of active enzyme per gram of the detergent composition. Stated otherwise, the compositions herein will typically comprise from 0.001% to 5%, preferably 0.01 %-1% by weight of a commercial enzyme preparation. In the particular cases where activity of the enzyme preparation can be defined otherwise such as with cellulases, corresponding activity units are preferred (e.g. CEVU or cellulase Equivalent Viscosity Units). For instance, the compositions of the present invention can contain cellulase enzymes at a level equivalent to an activity from 0.5 to 1000 CEVU/gram of composition. Cellulase enzyme preparations used for the purpose of formulating the compositions of this invention typically have an activity comprised between 1,000 and 10,000 CEVU/gram in liquid form, around 1,000 CEVU/gram in solid form.<br>
Other preferred optional ingredients include enzyme stabilisers, polymeric soil release agents, materials effective for inhibiting the transfer of dyes from one fabric to another during the cleaning process (i.e., dye transfer inhibiting agents), polymeric dispersing agents, suds suppressors, optical brighteners or other brightening or whitening agents, chelating agents, fabric softening clay, anti-static agents, other active ingredients, carriers, hydrotropes, processing aids, dyes or pigments, solvents for liquid formulations and solid fillers for bar compositions.<br>
Liquid detergent compositions can contain water and other solvents as carriers. Low molecular weight primary or secondary alcohols exemplified by methanol, ethanol, propanol, and isopropanol are suitable. Monohydric alcohols are preferred for solubilizing surfactant, but polyois such as those containing from 2 to 6 carbon atoms and from 2 to 6 hydroxy groups (e.g., 1,3-propanediol, ethylene glycol, glycerine, and 1,2-propanediol) can also be used. The compositions may contain from 5% to 90%, typically 10% to 50% of such carriers.<br>
Granular detergents can be prepared, for example, by spray-drying (final product density 520 g/l) or agglomerating (final product density above 600 g/l) the Base Granule. The remaining dry ingredients can then be admixed in granular or powder form with the Base Granule, for example in a rotary mixing drum, and the liquid ingredients (e.g., nonionic surfactant and perfume) can be sprayed on<br>
The detergent compositions herein will preferably be formulated such that, during use in aqueous cleaning operations, the wash water will have a pH of between 6.5 and 11, preferably between 7.5 and 10.5. Laundry products are typically at pH 9-11. Techniques for controlling pH at recommended usage levels<br><br>
include the use of buffers, alkalis, acids, etc., and are well-known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Method of use<br>
Also provided herein is a method for providing a delayed release of active aldehydes which comprises the step of contacting the surface to be treated with a compound or composition of the invention, and thereafter contacting the treated surface with a material, preferably an aqueous medium like moisture or any other means susceptible of releasing the perfume from the amine fragrant reaction product.<br>
By "surface", it is meant any surface onto which the compound can deposit. Typical examples of such material are fabrics, hard surfaces such as dishware, floors, bathrooms, toilet, kitchen and other surfaces in need of a delayed release of perfume aldehydes such as that with litter like animal litter. Preferably, the surface is selected from a fabric, a tile, a ceramic; more preferably is a fabric.<br>
By "delayed release" is meant release of the active component (e.g perfume) over a longer period of time than by the use of the active (e.g., perfume) itself.<br>
