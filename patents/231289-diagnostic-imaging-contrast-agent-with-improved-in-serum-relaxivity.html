DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING CONTRAST AGENT WITH IMPROVED IN SERUM RELAXIVITY<br>
Technical field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (M.R.I.)/ a technique used in the medical diagnosis field for a number of years, to rapidly detect a series of anomalies and/or pathological conditions of living human or animal body organs or tissues. (i. e. : Stark D.D. , Bradley W.G. Jr., Eds. : "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", the C.V. Mosby Company, St. Louis, Missouri (USA), 1988). In particular, the invention relates to new chelating agents, especially aminopolycarboxylie acid derivative compounds and to metal chelates thereof with bivalent or trivalent paramagnetic ions and/or salts thereof as well as their use as M.R.I, contrast agents. Background of the invention<br>
Diagnostic imaging techniques, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging have been used in medical diagnosis for a long time. The use of contrast media to improve tissue differentiation, to delineate structures "or monitor physiological functions constitutes in some cases a fundamental contribution in the best formulation of some medical diagnosis and a valid support for radiologist work.<br>
The medical use of aminopolycarboxylie acid or carboxylic acid derivatives and metal chelates thereof as M.R.I, contrast agents is well known. Said contrast agents, to simplify, can be seen as pertaining to two main groups:  the linear and the cyclic ones.<br><br>
The present invention relates to linear polyaminopolycarboxylie acid derivatives, as well as their complexes with paramagnetic metal ions, in particular the Gd3 + ion.<br>
Patent literature is rich in patent and patent applications relating to the use of linear polyaminopolycarboxylie acid derivatives in the preparation of MRI contrast agents. These compounds generally are derived from the simplest one, N,N,Nf,N'f,N!'-diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid, (DTPA), of which the Meglumine salt of the Gd^ + complex has been commercialised for a number of years as MAGNEVIST(R). To improve stability, water solubility and selectivity and to reduce toxicity of these contrast agents generally patent literature proposes the preparation of esters or amido derivatives of said acids or the introduction of substituents on the diethylene unit of the diethylenetri amine DTPA skeleton. As an example of said patent literature we can cite: Guerbet EP 661279; Concat Ltd., WO 95/05118; Dibra WO 95/15319; Mallinckrodt WO 94/08630; Green Gross Corp. JP 06016606 and JP 0 5229998; Mallinckrodt US 5,141,740 and "US 5,077,037; Cockbain-Nycomed WO 91/15467 and WO 92/11232; Salutar US 4,889,931 and 4,858,451; Abbot Laboratoires EP 279307; Nycomed EP 299795; Metasyn Inc. WO 95/28179; Schering EP 680 464; and document cited in these patent publications. Some documents further exist in which substituents have been introduced in a to one or more carboxylie DTPA groups; for example: Bracco EP-B-2 30893 and US 5,182,370; Schering WO 96/16928, WO 96/16929, WO 96/26180  and  DE  4341724  enclosing  a  derivatives,<br><br>
generally comprising an aromatic group, particularly useful for the imaging of the hepatobiliary system. In particular, some patent literature further exist, in which the introduction of an aromatic or lipophilic group on the chelant structure is specifically stated to make the contrast agent particularly useful for a best definition of the liver and the biliary duct: the General Hospital Corporation US 4,899,755 and WO -A-86/06605. Summary of the invention<br>
The compounds of the present invention are diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid derivatives characterised by having a hindering group in a to at least one of the 5 DTPA carboxylic groups wherein said substituent has the dimension of a C1-C90 alkyl, linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated chain, which is substituted or interrupted by at least two cyclic, optionally aromatic, carbocyclic or eterocyclic, saturated or unsaturated, isolated or fused units.<br>
Said hindering group is probably responsible for the interaction of the paramagnetic chelates with biological components of the fluids in which the agent diffuses, wherein said interaction produces the surprisingly high relaxivity values that we have measured in Human Reconstructed Serum.<br>
Relaxivity values of the contrast agent of the present invention have been tested either in saline or in human serum obtained by Seronorm™ Human, freeze-dried human serum produced by Nycomed Pharma AS, Oslo, Norway. Serum obtained from said Seronorm™ is substantially equivalent to the fresh one, so its use in<br><br>
the relaxivity determination grants a good picture of the !,in vivo" behaviour and, further, an excellent reproducibility of this test.<br>
The compounds object of the present invention are characterised by very high r1 and r2 relaxivity values. When measured in Seronorm™ Human at 20 MHz, at a temperature of 39°C, and at a concentration comprised from 0 to 1 mM, compounds of the present invention usually have r* relaxivity equal to or, preferably, higher than 15 s"^mM~^. Detailed disclosure of the invention<br>

The preparation of the compounds of the present application comprises the regiospecific introduction of<br><br>
the hindering substituent in a to a carboxylic group of the acetic acid bound to the central nitrogen atom of DTPA.<br>
One of the preferred synthetical ways used refers to that introduced by Rapoport (J. Org. Chem. 199 3, 58, 1151-1158), starting from natural or synthetical a-amino acid derivatives. An alternative way comprises the use of synthons such as glutamic acid or lysine, which allows the introduction of hindering groups quite distant from the carbon atom in a to a carboxylic group of the central acetic acid residue, exploiting the terminal acid or amino functions, respectively, of a.m. amino acids.<br>
Starting from suitable precursor synthons it is also possible make use of the synthesis disclosed in US 5,514,510.<br>
As far as the introduction of the hindering substituent at the a- position to the carboxylic group of one of the acetic groups bound to the side nitrogen atoms of DTPA is concerned, the synthesis scheme below can be followed:<br><br><br><br>
The synthesis comprises the following steps:<br>
(a)	precursor (1), wherein X = CI, Br or other leaving groups, is reacted with a diethylenetriamine excess in water, at a temperature of about 50°C, to obtain almost selectively compound (2), which is reacted in step<br>
(b)	with sodium bromoacetate in water at pH 10, to give the pentaacid (3), which is reacted, in the subsequent step<br>
(c)	with a suitable oxide or salt of a metal having atomic number comprised from 20 to 31, 39, from 42 to 44, 49 and from 57 to 83 (such as Gd203, GdCl3) e with the appropriate amount of a physiologically acceptable organic base (such as meglumine) or of an inorganic base the cations of which are sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, or mixtures thereof, to give the final compound (4),<br>
wherein:<br>
Men+ = ion of the metal element having atomic number<br>
comprised from 20 to 31, 39, from 42 to 44, 49 and from<br>
57 to 83 (such as Gd3+);<br>
n = number of the positive charges of said ion;<br>
m = number of the overall negative charges of the metal<br>
chelate;<br>
B2+ = Na+, K+, Mg + +, Ca++ or mixtures thereof, or it is<br>
the salt of a physiologically acceptable organic base;<br>
z = number of the positive charges of B;<br>
p = an integer so that: p x z = m.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Table 1 above discloses the high relaxivity shown in serum by the compounds of the present application; r* and ?2 relaxivity values of some of the preferred compounds are reported, in comparison with the corresponding r1 and r2 values measured for some of the mayor prior-art compounds: Gd-DTPA Dimeglumine salt (MAGNEVIST(R)); Gd-BOPTA Dimeglumine salt and Gd-EOB-DTPA Dimeglumine salt.<br>
The data of Table 1 clearly show that the compounds of the present invention have surprisingly high relaxivity values r* and r^, measured in Seronorm™ Human. This is particularly interesting from the application point of view, both as far as the improvement in the obtainable images, the development of formulations specific to particular districts and the determination of optimum low dosages of the contrast medium are concerned.<br>

Ethanolamine (15.15 g; 0.25 mol) was dropped in 10 minutes into a suspension of t-butyl bromoacetate (112.3 g; 0.58 mol) and KHCO3 (62.57 g; 0.62 mol) in DMF (400 mL) , maintained at 0°C under inert atmosphere. After 22 h at 20°C the suspension was diluted with a saturated solution of NaHC03 (400 mL) and Et20 (400 mL) . After separation, the aqueous phase was extracted with Et20<br><br>
(suu mL); tne organic pnases were collected, ariea (Na2S04) and concentrated. The obtained oil (100 g) was dissolved in CH9CI2 (700 mL) , then triphenylphosphine was added (79,76 g; 0,30 mol). To the solution, cooled to 0°C, solid NBS was slowly added (53,4 g; 0,30 mol). After 2.5 h the solution was concentrated to dryness and diluted with Et20 (500 mL); the salts were filtered off, the solution was diluted with Et20 (500 mL) , then left at 4°C for 16 h. The salts were filtered off and the solution was concentrated; the oily residue (100 g) was purified by flash chromatography (silica gel; 95:5 n-hexane/EtOAc). The fractions having comparable purity were collected and evaporated to dryness, obtaining the desired compound (57 g; 0,16 mol). Yield 65%. Gaschromatographic titre:     99   %    (area   %)<br>
