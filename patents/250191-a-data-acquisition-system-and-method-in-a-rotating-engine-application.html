				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The disclosed invenion relates to filter systems in general and, in<br>
particular, to a self-tuning filter for data acquisition.<br>
Description of the Background<br>
It is known that the acquisition of data at high sampling rates, typically<br>
greater than 5000 samples per second, is a difficult process and that the<br>
sampled data is very prone to sampling error due to noisy signals. Such noise is<br>
an inherent problem in many applications such as in internal combustion<br>
engines. That noise can lead to what is called "aliasing" which is caused by<br>
interference of the noise frequency with the sampling frequency. An aliased<br>
signal is a false signal that results from a sampling rate that is less frequent than<br>
desirable. Where a sensed condition changes very rapidly, it may be difficult or<br>
impossible to sense the condition at a frequency that eliminates aliasing.<br>
To resolve the aliasing problem in such circumstances, it is common to<br>
filter the signal by applying a low-pass filter to the signal between the sensing<br>
device and the data acquision device. Such a low-pass filter may be setup as<br>
an "anti-aliasing" filter by setting a filter corner frequency of the anti-aliasing filter<br>
at half of the sampling frequency. Such filtering, however, introduces additional<br>
problems as the filtering process delays the signal causing a timing mismatch.<br>
To resolve the timing mismatch, it is preferable to have a programmable filter<br>
controlled by the data acquisition unit so that the data acquisition unit can control<br><br>
The level of filtering being applied and compensate for the timing mismatch<br>
associated with the comer frequency set at the anti-aliasing filter.<br>
The approach of using a programmable anti-aliasing filter is complicated,<br>
however, if the sampling frequency changes with time, such as in the situation of<br>
degree-of-rotation based sampling of an engine operating characteristic during<br>
transient operation. In such a case, the filter frequency needs to change to<br>
match the changing sampling frequency to maintain measurement accuracy.<br>
US 4763207 disclosed herein a method of and system for reproducing an analog<br>
signal using digital techniques. The system includes means for encoding the<br>
analog signal in digital form and means for decoding the encoded analog signal.<br>
The encoding means includes means for detecting the upper bandwidth limit of<br>
the input analog signal during each of a plurality of successive sample intervals.<br>
Means coupled to the detecting means are included for sampling the input<br>
analog signal at a sampling rate determined in accordance with the detected<br>
upper bandwidth limits to derive a series of voltage levels which together define<br>
a sampled approximation of the input analog signal. Means are coupled to the<br>
sampling means for converting each voltage level and the sampling rate at which<br>
such voltage level was derived into digital signals. Also included are means for<br>
detecting when the input analog signal is at substantially a zero level, means for<br>
developing a digital indication of the length of time the signal is at such level and<br>
means for combining the digital indication with the digital signals to develop a<br>
digital representation of the input analog signal. The decoding means includes<br>
means for sequentially retrieving the digital signals, means coupled to the<br><br><br>
retrieving means for converting the digital signals into the sampled<br>
approximation of the input analog signal and a low-pass filter coupled to the<br>
converting means having a cut-off frequency determined in accordance with the<br>
encoded sampling rate for filtering the sampled approximation to reproduce the<br>
input analog signal.<br>
EP 0952335 Brandenburg discloses a sensor assembly for sensing the crankshaft<br>
position on an engine. This sensor assembly includes a tone ring, sensor,<br>
bandpass filter, and a gain limiter. Brandenburg does not disclose a data<br>
acquisition apparatus that samples a sensed signal at the rate of a varying - rate<br>
digital clocking signal. Although Brandenburg's sensor assembly includes a<br>
bandpass filter, the filter is not click-tunable, nor does it have a cutoff or corner<br>
frequency that is maintained at a ratio of the digital clocking signal frequency.<br>
US 5900830 describes a customized album recording system is under the control<br>
of a central microprocessor or mini-computer. A master library or storage<br>
medium is filled with a repertoire of recorded information items (such as musical<br>
selections) which may originate with any suitable source, such as phonograph<br>
records, tapes, sound tracks, compact discs, or the like. Each information item is<br>
stored in the library under its own address. On read out, an operator keys in the<br>
addresses identifying the selected items which are read out of the library<br>
medium and stored in a large capacity memory, usually to provide about forty-<br>
five minutes of total listening time. Then, all of the music is read out of that large<br>
capacity memory and recorded at a high speed onto a suitable album size<br>
medium, such as a tape cassette, for example. The source music and the<br><br><br>
customized album music are usually recorded in an analog form. The music<br>
which is processed within the system is in a digital form. Thus, the various<br>
transfers of music from the master storage to the recorded album, may be<br>
accomplished at a high speed of digital transmission. In an alternative<br>
embodiment, instead of reading out an entire album amount of recorded<br>
information items, the central computer successively reads out limited amounts<br>
of data on a demand and fetch basis. A computer provides both the analog-to-<br>
digital and the digital-to-analog conversions in order to improve fidelity.<br>
Thus, there is a need for an adjustable low-pass filter system that can follow a<br>
changing sampling frequency.<br>
There is a further need for a digital frequency multiplier that has improved<br>
operating characteristics over a phase - lock loop.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides solutions to the shortcomings of prior<br>
input filtering devices and frequency multiplying devices. Those of ordinary skill<br>
in the art will readily appreciate, therefore, that those and other details, features,<br>
and advantages will become further apparent in the following detailed<br>

signal changes to a predetermined state. A clock-tunable filter is, furthermore,<br>
coupled to the digital signal so that the frequency of the clock-tunable filter is<br>

unit and applied to an input having a variable sampling frequency.<br><br>

a clock - tunable filter. That method includes sensing a frequency at with a<br>
digital clocking signal changes state and adjusting a frequency of the clock-<br>
tunable filter in relationship to the frequency at which the digital clocking signal<br>
changes state. In that method the digital clocking signal causes an input to read<br>
a value incident on the input when the digital clocking signal changes to a<br>
predetermined state. That method is particularly applicable to acquiring data<br>

filters. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate, therefore, that<br>
those and other details, features, and advantages will become further apparent<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
It is to be understood that the figures and descriptions of the present<br>
invention included herein illustrate and describe elements that are of particular<br>
relevance to the present invention, while eliminating, for purposes of clarity, other<br>
elements found in typical data acquisition systems. Because the construction<br>
and implementation of such other elements are well known in the art, and<br>
because a discussion of them would not facilitate a better understanding of the<br>
present invention, a discussion of those elements is not provided herein. It is<br>
also to be understood that the embodiments of the present invention that are<br>
described herein are illustrative only and are not exhaustive of the manners of<br>
embodying the present invention. For example, it will be recognized by those<br>
skilled in the art that the present invention may be readily adapted to provide a<br><br><br>
high quality filtered signal in many applications other than internal combustion<br>
engine sensing applications.<br>
The disclosed invention provides a method and apparatus for adjusting<br>
filter frequency as a function of sampling frequency. Initially, a method and<br>
apparatus for adjusting the frequency at which a low-pass filter operates in<br>
response to a changing sampling frequency is provided. The invention utilizes a<br>
"self-tuning filter" that comprises a clock-tunable filter and a frequency matching<br>
device.<br>
The filter is placed intermediate a sensor and an input of a data acquisition<br>
unit to act upon a signal provided by the sensor by removing high frequency<br>
noise that may be incident on, for example, a conductor carrying the signal.<br>
Signals below the frequency threshold at which the filter is set, which include<br>
signals in the frequency range provided by the sensor in a properly designed<br>
system, are permitted to pass through the filter to the input.<br>
In certain circumstances, a sampling rate utilized by a data acquisition<br>
system may vary. For example, in degree-based sampling of an operating<br>
engine, wherein it is desired to sense properties and/or operating conditions such<br>
as the position, speed, or acceleration of an engine shaft each time the shaft<br>
rotates a predetermined number of degrees, the sampling rate will vary with the<br>
speed of the engine. Thus, when the engine is operating in a transient mode<br>
(i.e., the engine is accelerating or decelerating), the sampling rate will also vary.<br>
When acquiring data, for example in connection with an operating internal<br>
combustion engine, electromagnetic noise is typically generated by the engine<br>
and may interfere with signals as they are transferred from the engine to the data<br>
acquisition unit. A low-pass filter or anti-aliasing filter is often used to remove<br>
high frequency noise from the signal prior to reading the signal at an input of the<br>
data acquisition unit. When utilizing a low-pass filter to remove high frequency<br>
noise, it is desirable to set the filter frequency as a function of the sampling<br><br><br>
frequency. For example, a filter corner frequency setting that is half of the<br>
sampling fi equency is an appropriate ratio in many applications. Such a filter<br>
frequency will delay the signal by an amount approximately equal to the time<br>
between two samples. Furthermore, because filters cause signal receipt at the<br>
input to be delayed and because the amount of that delay is dependent upon the<br>
filter frequency, it is beneficial for the data acquisition unit to be aware of the filter<br>
frequency. Thus, when sampling a signal at a varying rate, it would be beneficial<br>
to change the filter frequency to maintain filter frequency at a constant ratio of the<br>
sampling frequency. In that way, the data acquisition unit can calculate the filter<br>
frequency from the sampling frequency and calculate the signal delay from the<br>
filter frequency. Thus, the present invention utilizes a tunable low-pass filter and<br>
provides a frequency matching input to the filter that is based on a frequency<br>
matching device output. Of course, the frequency matching device may include<br>
phased-lock loop technology that multiplies a frequency signal to provide the<br>
desired filter corner frequency. The manipulated frequency matching signal may<br>
then be applied to the filter.<br>
A sampling clock having a clock controlling a digital output is commonly<br>
employed to operate a multiplexed input board of a data acquisition unit. The<br>
clock will cause the digital output to pulse at a desired sampling frequency. The<br>
digital output is furthermore coupled to the input board to operate sample and<br>
hold circuits on the input board. In that manner, each pulse is used to trigger the<br>
input board to sample an input and hold the value sensed at that input in a buffer<br>
where the value may be accessed by a processor portion of the data acquisition<br>
unit. The sampling rate is furthermore communicated between the processor<br>
and the clock and may be varied by the processor. Thus, the sampling clock<br>
may be utilized as a frequency matching device.<br>
In the following example, the sampling clock acts as the frequency<br>
matching filter control device by providing its output signal to the clock-tunable<br><br><br>
Filter. with a suitable design the filter unit will then follow the sampling<br>
frequency set to a constant ratio of that frequency, which may be half of the<br>
sampling requency.<br>
Referring now to the drawings for the purpose of illustrating the preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention and not for the purpose of limiting the same,<br>
Figure 1 strates a self-tuning filter 101 of the present invention applied to a<br>
data acquisition application 100. The self-tuning filter 101 includes a frequency<br>
matching circuit 106 and a clock - tunable filter 104.<br>
As applied to tne data acquisition application depicted in Figure 1, the self-tuning<br>
filter 101 is cojpled to an input signal 102 and a data acquisition device 112. The<br>
input signal 1J2 is coupled to a signal input terminal (Sig) 120 of the clock-<br>
tunable filter 104. A frequency matching circuit 106 provides a filter control<br>
signal 108 is coupled to an operating frequency terminal (Con) 122 of the clock-<br>
tunable filter 104. A filtered signal HO is incident at an output terminal (Out) 123<br>
of the clock-tu lable filter 104. The filtered signal 110 is coupled to an input (not<br>
shown) of the data acquisition device 112. The filtered signal is read by the data<br>
acquisition device 112 and may serve any of a number of purposes including, for<br>
example, logging of the filtered signal or manipulation of output devices (not<br>
shown) in response to the filtered siynal 114 is generated by the data acquisition<br>
device 112 in the present example and coupled to the frequency matching circuit<br>
106.<br><br><br>
The input signal 102 may be an analog signal emanating form a sensor (not<br>
shown) such as, for example, a speed sensor, an acceleratio sensor, a pressure<br>
sensor, a temperature sensor, flow sensor, a humidity sensor, or a shaft<br>
position sensor. The shaft position sensor may, for example, sense the position<br>
of a generator shaft or a cam an automotive application. The sensor may<br>
provide an input signal which for example, be a current,	<br><br>
voltage, or resistance which udjusts in relation to the sensed phenomenon.<br>
Thus, if the sensor is sensor sensing the flow of fuel into a cylinder of an<br>
engine, for example, signal may be provided from the sensor at a flow rate<br>
of 10 milliliters per and a 5 V signal may be provided at a flow rate of 100<br>
milliliters per minute between 10 and 100 milliliters per minute may be<br>
proportionate between and 20mA. The input signal may be coupled from the<br>
sensor to the clock-tur. filter 104 by, for example, copper conductors.<br>
The sampling signal 114 may be provided by any digital signal<br>
operating at the frequency. Thus, the sampling frequency signal 114<br>
may be internally from wtinin the data acquisition device 112 or<br>
externally clocked from device external to a data acquisition device 112. An<br>
example of a sampling equency signal that is externally clocked is an engine<br>
encoder 124 that a chanye of state each time an engine shaft 126<br>
rotates a predeten number of degrees. The signal from such an engine<br>
encoder 124 may be ut.-zed to trigger data sampling as well as providing an<br>
input to the self- the present invention.<br>
An example of internally clocked sampling frequency signal is a signal<br>
produced by a sampling clock (not shown) internal to a data acquisition device<br>
112. The sampling in such a case, provides a digital output that controls<br>
the sampling rate the data acquisition device 112. The digital output of such a<br>
sampling clock state at the sampling rate and each input controlled by<br>
the digital output is sampled when the digital output changes to a predetermined<br>
state, such as a . Thus, a sensed value may be incident at the input<br>
continuously and the input may read the sensed value each time the digital<br>
output of either an or externally clocked device changes to the<br>
predetermined state The value at the input may then be placed in a buffer<br>
where it may be accessed by the data acquisition device 112. Each time the<br><br>
predetermined state is achieved the input may read the new value incident at<br>
the input and place tnat updated value in the buffer.<br>
The digital output of the sampling clock is also used, in the present example, to<br>
provide the sampling frequency signal 114 to the frequency matching circuit 106.<br>
The frequency matcning circuit 106 matches the sampling frequency to the<br>
clocking frequency required by the clock-tunable filter 104. That matching is<br>
accomp.ished by multiplying the frequency of the sampling frequency signal 1147<br>
by a . That factor is furthermore established by reference to the operating<br>
characteristics of the particular clock-tunable filter 104 utilized. The frequency<br>
matching circuit 105 in one embodiment of the present example includes a<br>
phase-lock loop, which multiples the sampling frequency signal 114 and provides<br>
a filter control signa; 108 to the operating frequency terminal (Con) 122. Thus,<br>
the rrequency provided to the operating frequency terminal (Con) 122 is<br>
proportionate to the sampling frequency of the data acquisition device 112.<br>
Figure 2 is a set of cnarts 150 illustrating engine encoder output 154 and<br>
frequency matching circuitry output 156 at various engine speeds in an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The engine speed chart 152 illustrates an<br>
engine accelerating from 1000 rpm to 9000 rpm over a ten second period.<br>
The engine encoder pulse train chart 154 illustrates a typical engine encoder<br>
pulse train corresponding to the two second point of the engine speed chart, an<br>
engine encoder pulse corresponding to the four second point of the engine speed<br><br><br>
char:, and an engine encoder pulse train corresponding to the six second point of<br>
the speed chart. The engine encoder pulse train corresponding to the two<br>
second point is depicted at 158, the engine encoder pulse train corresponding to<br>
the second point is depicted at 160, and the engine encoder pulse train<br>
corresponding to the six second point is depicted at 162, and those depictions<br>
are illustrated to scale. One form of the engine encoder 124, which is utilized<br>
in present example, provides a pulse for every	<br><br>
degree of engine rotation. Other engine encoders 124 may provide, for example,<br>
a puise for every half degree of rotation or a pulse for every tenth of a degree of<br>
rotation. Thus, in the present example wherein the engine encoder 124 provides<br>
a single pulse for every degree of rotation, a total of 360 pulses are output by<br>
the engine encoder 124 for every rotation of the engine. Engine encoder pulse<br>
train output may be calculated from engine speed such that the pulse train<br>
output for any given engine speed may be determined. Engine speed in rpm<br>
may, therefore, be divided oy 60 seconds per minute to arrive at engine speed<br>
per second. Engine speed per second may then be multiplied by the number of<br>
encoder pulses per revolution (in this example, 360 pulses per rotation) to arrive<br>
at the engine encoder pulse train in cycles per second or hertz. Engine encoder<br>
pulse train for an engine encoder providing a pulse for every one degree of<br>
rotation is equal to 360/60 or six times engine speed in rpm.<br>
Utilizing that equation, engine encoder pulse train output at the two second mark<br>
on the engine speed chart 152, when the engine is operating at 1500 rpm, is<br>
equal to 9000 Hz. Engine encoder pulse train at the four second mark on the<br>
engine speed chart 152, when the engine is operating at 6000 rpm, is equal to<br>
36,000 Hz, and engine encoder pulse train at the six second mark on the engine<br>
speed chart 152, when the engine is operating at 8500 rpm, is equal to 51,000<br>
Hz.<br>
The frequency matching circuitry pulse train chart 156 illustrates a pulse train<br>
output of one embodiment of the frequency matching circuitry corresponding to<br><br><br>
the two second point of the engine speed chart, a pulse train output<br>
corresponding to the four second point of the engine speed chart, and a pulse<br>
train output corresponding to the six second point of the engine speed chart.<br>
The two second frequency matching circuitry pulse train is depicted at 164, the<br>
four second frequency matching circuitry pulse train is depicted at 166, and the<br>
six second frequency matching circuitry pulse train is depicted at 168, and those<br><br>
depictions are not illustrates to scale. A form of frequency matching circuitry 106<br>
utilized in the present example, provides 56 pulses for every engine encoder<br>
pulse or a frequency of 56 times that of the engine encoder. Other multipliers<br>
may also be used through the frequency matching circuitry as desired. For<br>
example, various multipliers may be employed to match the filter or other hard<br>
ware utilized. Thus, in the present example wherein the frequency matching<br>
circuitry 106 provides 56 pulses for every engine encoder pulse, at the two<br>
second point when the engine encoder pulse train is 9000 Hz or 9 kHz, the pulse<br>
train output by the frequency matching circuitry 106 is 56 times 9 kHz, or 504<br>
kHz. At the four second point, when the engine encoder pulse train is 36 kHz,<br>
the pulse train output by the frequency matching circuitry 106 is 56 times 36<br>
kHz, or 2016 kHz, and at the six second point, when the engine encoder pulse<br>
train is 51 kHz, the pulse train output by the frequency matching circuitry 106 is<br>
56 time s51 kHz, or 2856 kHz.<br>
The present invention provides a corner frequency of approximately one-half the<br>
sampling frequency and provides a constant between receipt of a signal at the<br>
filter and output of the filtered signal from the filter to the data acquisition device<br>
of approximately one sample. In the following embodiment, the clock -tunable<br>
filter 104 is selected to have a clock to cut-off frequency ratio of 100. The clock -<br>
tunable filter 104 also has a group delay of 0.028 ms at a corner frequency of 20<br>
kHz. Moreover, the ratio of group delay to corner frequency is constant such that<br>
group delay may be calculated for nay corner frequency.<br><br>
Figure 3 is a chart 180 that illustrates the constancy of frequency ratios with time<br>
to maintain the ratio of sampling frequency to filter corner frequency at a<br>
constant of near two, thereby achieving a filter corner frequency that is equal to<br>
approximately half the sampling frequency across the range of sampling<br>
frequencies experienced. In the embodiment illustrated, the ratio of filter control<br>
signal frequency to filter corner frequency is 100, as shown at 182. Filter control<br><br>
Signal frequency is 100 times the filter corner frequency because filter control<br>
signal frequency is input into the clock-tunable filter 104 and is, therefore,<br>
divided by the clock to cut-off frequency ratio of 100 to arrive at the corner<br>
frequency.<br>
The ratio of filter control signal frequency to sampling frequency is 56, as shown<br>
at 184. The ratio of filter control signal frequency to sampling frequency is<br>
accomplished because the frequency matching circuit 106 multiples the sampling<br>
frequency 114 by 56 and outputs that frequency as the filter control signal 108.<br>
The ratio of sampling frequency to filter corner frequency is, therefore, equal to<br>
the ratio of filter corner frequency divided by the ratio of filter control signal<br>
frequency to sampling frequency- Thus, in the present embodiment, the ratio of<br>
sampling frequency to filter corner frequency is 100 divided by 56, or 1.79 as<br>
shown at 186.<br>
Clock -tunable filters 104 are available having clock to cut-off frequency ratios of<br>
values 100, including for examples 50. Such clock-tunable filter 104<br>
may be with various frequency matching circuits to create other filter<br>
control circuits having a frequency that is approximately half the cut-off<br>
frequency .<br>
Thus, with an engine speed of 6000 rpm with an encoder causing<br>
the data device to sample once for every degree of engine rotation,<br><br><br>
the sampling frequency is 6000 rpm times 360 samples/rotation divided by 60<br>
sec/min = 36 kHz. Utilizing frequency matching circuitry that provides 56 filter<br>
control signal pulses per sample, the ratio of filter control signal frequency to<br>
sampling frequency is fifty-six to one. The frequency of the filter control signal<br>
108, at a sampling frequency of 36 kHz, is 36 kHz times 56, or 2016 kHz.<br>
The filter delay or group delay is the time that a signal delayed in getting to the<br>
data acquisition device due to the filter. A desirable filter delay value is one<br>
sampling cycle.<br><br>
The clock-tunable filter selected for the present embodiment is a<br>
commercially available model LTC 1066-1, manufactured by Linear Technology<br>
of Milpitas California. That fitter has a fitter delay of 0.028 ms at 20 kHz. A filter<br>
having a filter delay of 0.028 ms at 20 kHz does not provide a perfect half cycle<br>
comer frequency but that commercially available component gives close to the<br>
desired half cycle comer frequency. A perfect half cycle comer frequency, in the<br>
present configuration would require a filter having a filter delay of 0.025 ms at 20<br>
kHz,.<br>
The selected clock-tunable filter does, however, provide the desired one<br>
sample delay at all desired frequencies. Thus, at a corner frequency of 20 kHz,<br>
the sampling frequency would be equal to the control signal frequency of 20 kHz<br>
divided by the frequency matching circuit multiplier of 56 times the clock to cut-off<br>
frequency ratio of 100, or 35.7 kHz. The 35.7 kHz sampling frequency occurs at<br>
an engine speed of 5,950 rpm (35.7 kHz times 360 pulses per rotation divided by<br>
60 sec/min). Moreover, the time between samples is equal to 1/35.7 kHz, or<br>
0.028 ms. Thus, as desired, the filter delay of 0.028 ms is equal to the time<br>
between samples and the invention achieves the desired one sample delay time.<br>
Furthermore, the sample delay time holds true for all engine speeds.<br>
Thus, at 1500 rpm with a sampling rate of 9 kHz, the ideal filter delay of<br>
one divided by nine thousand or 0.111 ms is achieved. Similarly, the ideal filter<br>
delay at 9000 rpm of one divided by fifty-one thousand, or 0.0198 ms and at<br>
6000 rpm the ideal filter delay of one divided by thirty-six thousand, or 0.0277 is<br>
achieved.<br>
The 35.7 kHz sampling frequency is equal to 1.79 times the corner<br>
frequency of 20 kHz. Therefore, the desired ratio of sampling frequency to filter<br>
corner frequency of approximately two is also achieved. The proportionality of<br>
sampling frequency to filter comer frequency across engine speeds of 1000 rpm<br>
to 9000 rpm is illustrated in Figure 4. The sampling and filter frequency<br><br><br>
Proportionality chart 200 of figure 4 depicts frequency in Hz on a vertical axis<br>
204, engine speed in rpm on a horizontal axis 202, sampling frequency at various<br>
engine speeds 206 and filter corner frequency at various speeds 208.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates a group or filter delay of the clock-tunable filter at various<br>
engine speeds in this embodiment. The group of filter delay is depicted at 226 on<br>
group delay chart 220 having a vertical axis 224 demarked in milliseconds of<br>
delay time and a horizontal axis 222 demarked in engine speed rpm.<br>
Figure 6 is a chart 240 illustrating that the delay time in a sample reaching the<br>
data acquisition device 112 due to the self-tuning filter 101 is equal to one<br>
sample at all engine speeds. The group delay due to the self-tuning filter 101 is<br>
illustrated by line 242 and is equal to one sample of delay, demarked on the<br>
vertical axis 244 at various engine speeds demarked on the horizontal axis 246.<br>
Thus, another goal of achieving a constant filter delay in a system having a<br>
variable sampling rate is also achieved.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates a digital frequency multiplier 250 included in the frequency<br>
matching circuit 106 in another embodiment of the present invention. It will be<br>
noted that the digital frequency multiplier 250 described hereinbefore multiplied<br>
the sampling frequency by fifty -six while the digital frequency multiplier 250<br>
described in connection with figure 7 multiplies the sampling frequency by 10.<br>
These and other multipliers may be used with various embodiments of the<br>
present invention.<br><br><br>
In operatio with the sampling frequency signal 114 operating for the duratio of<br>
the current example at 1000 Hz, a first counter register 260 will count low to<br>
high transitions on the oscillator 252 output (out) 256 clocking signal 254, which<br>
is opening at 1 MHz, a second counter register 272 will count low to high<br>
transitions on a scaled oscillator signal 266 received from an output (out) 268 of<br>
a frequency divider 264 which is operating at 100 kHz until the second counter<br>
register 272 is reset at 288 by a low to high transition of the sampling frequency<br><br>
signal 114. In the present example, a compare register 280 will have a value of<br>
100 at its input terminal (in1) 278. That value of 100 is equal to the number of<br>
low to high transitions received at a clock terminal (clk) 270 of the second<br>
counter register 272 between individual low to high transitions of the sampling<br>
frequency signal 114, i.e., 100 kHz divided by 1000 Hz, or a count of 100. The<br>
compare register 280 will furthermore transition its output from low to high each<br>
time the count signal 284 received form the output (out) 282 of the first counter<br>
register 260 at its input (in2) 286 reaches a value equal to the value of a signal<br>
276 received from an output (out) 274 of the second counter register 272 at its<br>
other input (inl) 278. Thus, the compare register output 292 will transition each<br>
time the count at input (in2) 286 reaches 100 in the present example. Because<br>
the frequency of the signal 254 provided to the clock terminal (clk) 258 of the<br>
first counter register 260 is ten times greater than the frequency of the signal<br>
266 provided to the clock terminal (clk) 270 of the second counter register 272,<br>
a compare register output (out) 292 will transition ten times for each transition<br>
of the sampling frequency signal 114 received at a load terminal 290. When the<br>
compare register output (out) 292 transitions, the output signal 294 of the<br>
compare register 280 will reset the first counter register 260 at 296 and trigger a<br>
toggle register 300 at 298. The toggle register 300 then provides a filter control<br>
signal 108 at output (out) 302 that operates at a frequency ten times greater<br>
than that of the sampling frequency signal 114. It will be recognized that the<br>
filter control signal 108 provided to the clock-tunable filter 104 may be set to<br><br>
operate at a frequency that may be any desired multiple of the sampling<br>
frequency signal 114 by selecting a frequency divider 264 that divides the<br>
oscillator clocking signal 254 received at input (in) 262 by the desired multiple.<br>
The embodiments of the invention lend several important features to the design<br>
of a filter for a signal having a changing sampling rate : (i) the filter frequency<br>
may always be set in direct proportion to the sampling frequency; (ii) the signal<br>
delay may always be set to a fixed number of samples, and can be arranged to<br>
be a single sample point delay if the filter frequency is set at an	<br><br>
appropriate value; and (iii) the system is capable of following any sampling rate<br>
set by the system without external intervention.<br>
The present invention produces a very adaptable anti-aliasing filter system<br>
for high-speed data acquisition where there is little or no communication with the<br>
host computer and yet the filter is always set to the most suitable condition. The<br>
application of this idea may be universally applied to any data acquisition<br>
application in which an anti-aliasing hardware filter is required or desired to<br>
ensure accurate logging of data and subsequent software filtering.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to<br>
specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that<br>
various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from<br>
the spirit and scope thereof. In particular, it should be noted that the present<br>
invention provides a filter having a frequency that will adjust to any sampling<br>
signal including signal operating at a constant sampling rate and a signal<br>
operating at a variable sampling rate. Thus, the present invention also<br>
beneficially provides a filter that may be used in a constant sampling application<br>
without requiring manual set-up by an operator. Thus, it is intended that the<br>
