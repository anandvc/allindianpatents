				<td>The invention relates to paper and paper oriented products by coating the kraft paper with the coating resolution as more fully described in the Invention. It Is possible to get a glossy paper, which is sturdy and cost effective. This invention Is a method for manufacturing a novel coated kraft paper. The coating is made of pigments like KCG LUMPS, CaCo3, NUCLAY 90 and HYDROCARB 90 with binders like DL 930 and PVA 325 to these are added CAUSTIC SODA, POLYSALT &quot;S&#x27;. SORBITAL, DYE CCL IS GRADE BLUE and DYE CCL &amp; VIOLET to which water is added in the required quantity to make the coating slurry. And coating slurry is coated on the kraft paper as described in this specification to make an economical attractive low GSM weight coated kraft paper which is also eco friendly.</td>

				<td>This invention in general relates to paper and paper-oriented products. This invention is more concerned with Kraft Paper. More pertinently this Invention relates to a novel method of manufacturing coated Kraft paper. This invention Is also concerned with the machinery employed in manufacturing coated Kraft paper.<br>
Using the materials in Table 1 below, the coating slurry will be made by mixing and dissolved in water to prepare coating solution. This coating solution consists of pigments and binders. The coating solution is supplied to coating machine in the applicator tray. A rotating roll made of steel with chrome plating having uniform smoothness also known as applicator roll fitted partly submerged in coating solution, picks-up coating solution on its circumstance. The Kraft paper to be coated is passed over the top surface picks-up coating solution. Any excess picked up solution by the Kraft paper is whipped out with the help of air knife. The wet coated Kraft paper passes through hot air chamber for drying and dried Kraft paper is getting rewind at the end of the coating machine. This coated Kraft paper will be passed through calendar machine for required glossiness and then it will cut into required size into sheets through cutters or will be made into reels as per requirement by passing through re-winder machine. These into bundles or reels for dispatch to the market.<br>
Today the practice In the market is to print on top of Kraft and Duplex Board as top ply of master carton to enable the manufacturer to print the Information regarding the product and information regarding the company it belongs to . Duplex Board, as a top ply has the following disadvantages.<br>
a.	Forces the consumer to use much higher GSM thus increasing the weight<br>
of the carton.<br>
b.	The Burst Factor of carton comes down thus forces to use higher Burst<br>
Kraft in other layer or increase ply of boxes to reach the desired level.<br>
c.	It cracks on fold thus giving ugly look to carton.<br>
These disadvantages make an innovator to think what can be done next to get the desired goal without increasing the cost. The corporate worid is looking for building brand equity and it is very important to see how the packaged product looks while getting delivered, or put on point of display. Customer's decision¬making becomes faster in case if the packaging is colorful and more attractive.<br>
By coating the Kraft paper with the coating solution a described in the invention it would be possible to get a glossy paper which will be sturdy and at the same time cost effective. This also enables the companies wanting to make their cartion attractive and create to switch over to multi colored boxes to give better look to the cartons, which make the customer feel good.<br><br>
It is the primary object of invention to invent a novel coated Kraft paper.<br>
It is another object of the Invention to invent a novel coated Kraft paper, which is unique.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a method of manufacturing novel coated Kraft paper.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a novel process of manufacturing coated Kraft paper wherein the process is economical.<br>
It is another object of the invention to Invent a novel process of manufacturing coated Kraft paper wherein the process requires minimum labour.<br>
Further objects of the Invention will be clear from the following description. Now the invention will be described in detail. The nature of the invention and the manner in which the invention is to be performed is given in the following description.<br>
TABLE : 1<br><br><br><br><br><br>
It is not very easy to reach the final goal, as one need to optimize on plenty of properties to give the desired product. It look time and labour with day and night work on the product and after trails an optimized CLAY COATED KRAFT successfully achieved to give answer to all modern day packaging needs.<br><br>
The features of clay-coated Kraft are:<br>
1.	It is economical comparing to coated duplex board.<br>
2.	Since it is coated, color reproduction will be better giving alt what is required for building brand equity.<br>
3.	Due to tower GSM the carton weight comes down thus saving on transportation cost.<br>
4.	As the product can be given as per customer specification on BF (Bursting factor) or RCT (Ring Crush Test) thus the need of changing No. of ply or higher requirement of other ply<br>
does not arise.<br>
5. As the clay-coated Kraft does not crack at fold, it gives good took and rigidity to the carton.<br>
6. The process wastage is reduced, as all layers are alike.<br>
Thus a cost of effective solution in the form of cfay-coated Kraft has arrived in today's world of cost consciousness. As the clay coated Kraft is Eco-friendly, one could achieve their duty of preserving nature. By using less fibre one can contribute in a big way to produce more paper with the available resources.<br>
It will be understood that the foregoing description Is only illustrative of the present invention and it is not intended that the Invention be limited thereto. Many other specific embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to one skilled in the art from the foregoing disclosure. All substitution, alterations and modification of the present invention to which the present inventton Is readily susceptible without departing from the spirit of the invention and which come within the scope of the following claims are part and parcel of this invention.<br><br>

2   A method of manufacturing coated kraft paper comprising the following steps, Using the raw materials ,  as in Claim<br>
1. The coating solution is supplied to the applicator tray of the coating machine which is available in the market in which a rotating roll known as applicator roll fitted partly submerged in coating solution, picks-up coating solution on its circumference, the Kraft paper to be coated is passed over the top surface picks - up coating solution, any excess picked up solution by the Kraft paper is whipped out with the help of air knife, the wet coated Kraft paper pass through hot air chamber having a temperature of 180° C for drying and dried Kraft paper is getting rewind at the end of the coating machine, this coated Kraft paper will be passed through calendar machine for required glossiness and then it will cut into required size into sheets through cutters or will be made into reels as per requirement by passing through re-winder machine, these into bundles or reels.</td>
