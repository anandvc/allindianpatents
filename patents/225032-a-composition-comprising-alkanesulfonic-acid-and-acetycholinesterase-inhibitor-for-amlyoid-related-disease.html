Background<br>
Alzheimer's disease is a devastating disease of the brain that results in progressive memory loss leading to dementia, physical disability, and death over a relatively long period of time. With the aging populations in developed countries, the number of Alzheimer's patients is reaching epidemic proportions.<br>
People suffering from Alzheimer's disease develop a progressive dementia in adulthood, accompanied by three main structural changes in the brain: diffuse loss of neurons in multiple parts of the brain; accumulation of intracellular protein deposits termed neurofibrillary tangles; and accumulation of extracellular protein deposits termed amyloid or senile plaques, surrounded by misshapen nerve terminals (dystrophic neurites). A main constituent of these amyloid plaques is the amyloid-p peptide (A|3), a 39-43 amino-acid protein that-is produced through cleavage of the (β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), Extensive research has been conducted on the relevance of Aβ deposits in Alzheimer's disease, see, e.g., Selkoe, Trends in Cell Biology 8,<br><br>
447-453 (1998). Aβ naturally arises from the metabolic processing of the amyloid precursor protein ("APP") in the endoplasmic reticulum ("ER"), the Golgi apparatus, or the endosomal-lysosomal pathway, and most is normally secreted as a 40 ("Aβl-40") or 42 ("Apl-42") amino acid peptide (Selkoe, ifanu. Rev. Cell Biol. 10, 373-403 (1994)). A role for Ap as a primary cause for Alzheimer's disease is supported by the presence of extracellular amyloid p peptide ("AP") deposits in senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease ("Alzheimer's disease"), the increased production of Ap in cells harboring mutant Alzheimer's disease associated genes, e.g., amyloid precursor protein, preseniiin I and presenilin II; and the toxicity of extracellular soluble (oligomeric) or fibrillar Aβ to cells in culture. See, e.g., Gervais, Eur. Biopharm. Review, 40-42 (Autumn 2001); May, DDT6,459-62 (2001). Although symptomatic treatments exist for Alzheimer's disease, this disease cannot be prevented or cured at this time.<br>
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by diffuse and neuritic plaques, cerebral angiopathy, and neurofibrillary tangles. Plaque and blood vessel amyloid is believed to be formed by the deposition of insoluble Aβ amyloid protein, which may be described as diffuse or fibrillary. Both soluble oligomeric Ap and fibrillar Ap are also believed to be neurotoxic and inflammatory. Amyloid fibrils, once deposited, can become toxic to the surrounding cells. For example, die Ap fibrils organized as senile plaques have been shown to be associated with dead neuronal cells and microgliosis in patients with Alzheimer's disease. When tested in vitro, Ap peptide was shown to be capable of triggering an activation process of microglia (brain macrophages), which would explain the presence of microgliosis and brain inflammation found in die brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Once these amyloids have formed, there is no known, widely accepted therapy or treatment that significantly dissolves amyloid deposits or prevents the formation of deposits in situ. Presently available pharmaceutical technology for treatment of P-amyloid diseases is almost entirely symptomatic, providing only temporary or partial clinical benefit Although some pharmaceutical agents have been described that offer partial symptomatic relief, no comprehensive pharmacological therapy is currently available for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.<br><br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
"Amyloidosis" or "amyloid disease" refers to a pathological condition characterized by the presence of amyloid fibers. Amyloid is a generic term referring to a group of diverse but specific protein deposits (intracellular or extracellular) which are seen in a number of different diseases. Though diverse in their occurrence, all amyloid deposits have common morphologic properties, stain with specific dyes (e.g., Congo red), and have a characteristic red-green birefringent appearance in polarized light after staining. They also share common ultrastructural features and common X-ray diffraction and infrared spectra. The term "amyloid-p diseases" includes those diseases, conditions, pathologies, and other abnormalities of die structure or function of the brain, including components thereof, in which the causative agent is amyloid. The area of the brain affected in an amyloid-p disease may be the stroma including the vasculature or the parenchyma including functional or anatomical regions, or neurons themselves. A subject need not have received a definitive diagnosis of a specifically recognized amyloid-p disease.<br>
Local deposition of amyloid is common in the brain, particularly in elderly individuals. The most frequent type of amyloid in the brain is composed primarily of Ap peptide fibrils, resulting in dementia associated with sporadic (non-hereditary) Alzheimer's disease. In fact, the incidence of sporadic Alzheimer's disease greatly exceeds forms shown to be hereditary. Nevertheless, fibril peptides forming plaques are very similar in both types.<br>
APP is expressed and constitutively catabolized in most cells. The dominant catabolic pathway appears to be cleavage of APP within the Aβ sequence by an enzyme provisionally termed a-secretase, leading to release of a soluble ectodomain fragment known as APPsa. In contrast to this non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP can also be cleaved by enzymes known as p-and y-secretase at the N- and C-termini of the Ap, respectively, followed by release of Ap into the extracellular space. To date, BACE has been identified as P-secretase (Vasser, et al9 Science 286:735-741,1999) and presenilins have been implicated in y-secretase activity (De Strooper, et aLf Nature 391,387-90 (1998)).<br>
The 39-43 amino acid Aβ peptide is produced by sequential proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the enzyme(s) p and y secretases. Although Ap40 is the predominant form produced, 5-7% of total Ap exists as Ap42 (Cappai et at, Int. J. Biochem, Cell Biol 31. 885-89 (1999)). The length of the Ap peptide appears to dramatically alter its biochemical/biophysical properties. Specifically, the additional two amino acids at the C-terminus of Ap42 are very hydrophobic, presumably increasing the propensity of Ap42 to aggregate. For example, Jarrett, et al demonstrated that AP42 aggregates very rapidly in vitro compared to Ap -40, suggesting feat the longer forms of Ap may be the important pathological<br><br>
proteins that are involved in the initial seeding of the neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease (Jarrett, et aly Biochemistry 32,4693-97 (1993); Jarrett, et a/., Ann. NY. Acad. ScL 695,144-48 (1993)).<br>
This hypothesis has been further substantiated by the recent analysis of the contributions of specific forms of Ap in cases of genetic familial forms of Alzheimer's disease ("FAD"). For example, the "London" mutant form of APP (APPV717I) linked to FAD selectively increases the production of Ap 42/43 forms versus Ap 40 (Suzuki, et al.yScience 264,1336-40 (1994)) while the "Swedish" mutant form of APP (APPK670N/M671L) increases levels of both Ap40 and AP42/43 (Citron, et aL, Nature 360,672-674 (1992); Cai, etal, Science 259, 514-16, (1993)). Also, it has been observed that FAD-linked mutations in the Presenilin-l ("PS1") or Presenilin-2 (aPS2**) genes will lead to a selective increase in AP42/43 production but not AP40 (Borchelt, et al, Neuron 17,1005-13 (1996)). This finding was corroborated in transgenic mouse models expressing PS mutants that demonstrate a selective increase in brain AP42 (Borchelt, op cit.; Duff, et al% Neurodegeneration 5(4), 293-98 (1996)). Thus the leading hypothesis regarding the etiology of Alzheimer's disease is that an increase in AP42 production or release is a causative event in the disease pathology.<br>
Epidemiological studies show that subjects with elevated cholesterol levels have an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (Notkola, et al.t Neuroepidemiology 17(1), 14-20 (1998); Jarvik, et aL, Neurology 45(6), 1092-96 (1995)). In addition to the data which suggests that elevated levels of Ap are associated with Alzheimer's disease, other environmental and genetic risk factors have been identified. For example, a relationship exists between serum cholesterol levels and the incidence and the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. The best studied of these is polymorphism of the apolipoprotein E ("ApoE") gene: subjects homozygous for the e4 isoform of ApoE (apoE4) have consistently been shown to have an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (Strittmatter, ef a/,, Proc. Nat'I Acad. ScL USA 90:1977-81 (1993). Because ApoE is a cholesterol transport protein, several groups have observed a correlation between the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and circulating levels of cholesterol (Mahley, Science 240,622-30 (1998); Saunders, et cd.y Neurology 43,1467-72 (1993); Corder, et ai, Science 261, 921-23 (1993); Jarvik, et al, Ann. N.Y. Acad ScL 826,128-46 (1997)). Moreover, cholesterol loading increases the production of Ap protein (Simons, et ai, Proc. Nat'I Acad. ScL USA 95, 6460-64 (1998)), while pharmacological reduction of cholesterol with the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin decreases levels of both Ap -40 and Ap -42 (Fassbender, et al9 Proc. Nat'I Acad ScL USA 98,5856-61 (2001)) in vitro. Consistent with these data are the results of epidemiological studies which have shown that treatment with certain HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly used to normalize cholesterol levels in humans, reduces the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (Wolozin, et ai, Arch Neurol 57,1439-43 (2000); Jick, et al, Lancet 356, 1627-31 (2000). Taken together, these data suggest a link between regulation of cholesterol<br><br>
levels and Alzheimer's disease. In addition, a relationship with coronary disease has been demonstrated (discussed further below).<br>
Amyloid-p peptide (AP) is a 39-43 amino acid peptide derived by proteolysis from a large protein known as Beta Amyloid Precursor Protein ("PAPP"). Mutations in PAPP result in familial forms of Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and senile dementia, characterized by cerebral deposition of plaques composed of Ap fibrils and other components, which are described in further detail below. Known mutations in APP associated with Alzheimer's disease occur proximate to the cleavage sites of p or y-secretase, or within Ap. For example, position 717 is proximate to the site of gamma-secretase cleavage of APP in its processing to Ap, and positions 670/671 are proximate to the site of p-secretase cleavage. Mutations at any of these residues may result in Alzheimer's disease, presumably by causing an increase in the amount of the 42/43 amino acid form of Ap generated from APP. The familial form of Alzheimer's disease represents only 10% of the subject population. Most occurrences of, Alzheimer's disease are sporadic cases where APP and Ap do not possess any mutation.<br>
The structure and sequence of Ap peptides of various lengths are well known in the art Such peptides can be made according to methods known in the art, or extracted from the brain according to known methods (e.g., Glenner and Wong, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 129, 885-90 (1984); Glenner and Wong, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 122,1131-35 (1984)). In addition, various forms of the peptides are commercially available.<br>
As used herein, the terms "P amyloid," "amyloid-p," and the like refer to amyloid p proteins or peptides, amyloid p precursor proteins or peptides, intermediates, and modifications and fragments thereof, unless otherwise specifically indicated. In particular, "AP" refers to any peptide produced by proteolytic processing of the APP gene product, especially peptides which are associated with amyloid pathologies, including Api-39, Api-40, Apl-41, Api-42, and Apl -43. For convenience of nomenclature, "Api -42" may be referred to herein as *AP(1 -42)" or simply as "Ap42" or wAp42w (and likewise for any other amyloid peptides discussed herein). As used herein, the terms "p amyloid," "amyloid-p," and "AP" are synonymous. Unless otherwise specified, the term "amyloid" refers to amyloidogenic proteins, peptides, or fragments thereof which can be soluble (e.g., monomeric or oligomeric) or insoluble (e.g., having fibrillary structure or in amyloid plaque). See, e.g., MP Lambert, et al9 Proc. Nat'lAcad. Set USA 95, 6448-53 (1998).<br>
According to certain aspects of the invention, amyloid-p is a peptide having 39-43 amino-acids, or amyloid-p is an amyloidogenic peptide produced from PAPP. The amyloid-p diseases that are the subject of the present invention include age-related cognitive decline, early Alzheimer's disease as seen in Mild Cognitive Impairment ("MCI"), vascular dementia, or Alzheimer's disease ("AD"), which, may be sporadic (non-hereditary) Alzheimer's disease or<br><br>
familial (hereditary) Alzheimer's disease. The amyloid-p disease may also be cerebral amyloid angiopathy ("CAA") or hereditary cerebral hemorrhage. The amyloid-p disease may be senile dementia, Down's syndrome, inclusion body myositis ("IBM"), or age-related macular degeneration ("ARMD").<br>
The present invention relates to the use of certain compounds, denoted a "first agent," representative examples of which include substituted and unsubstituted alkanesulfonic acids, in combination with a second agent that is biologically active for the treatment or prevention of amyloid-P diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions for the prevention or treatment of such diseases and methods of preparing and using these compositions.<br>
The invention pertains to pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use thereof for the treatment of amyloid-p diseases. The pharmaceutical compositions comprise a first agent that treats or prevents an amyloid-P disease, e.g., by preventing or inhibiting amyloid-p fibril formation, neurodegeneration, or cellular toxicity. The pharmaceutical composition also comprises a second agent that is an active pharmaceutical ingredient; that is, the second agent is therapeutic and its function is beyond that of an inactive ingredient, such as a pharmaceutical carrier (or vehicle), preservative, diluent, or buffer. The second agent may be useful in treating or preventing an amyloid-p disease or another neurological disease. The first and second agents may exert their biological effects by similar or unrelated mechanisms of action; or either one or both of the first and second agents may exert their biological effects by a multiplicity of mechanisms of action. A pharmaceutical composition may also comprise a third compound, or . even more yet, wherein the third (and fourth, etc.) compound has the same characteristics of a second agent.<br>
It should be understood that the pharmaceutical compositions described herein may have the first and second, third, or additional agents in die same pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier or in a different pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for each described embodiment. It further should be understood that the first, second, third and additional agent may be administered simultaneously or sequentially within described embodiments. Alternatively, a first and second agent may be administered simultaneously, and a third or additional agent may be administered before or after the first two agents.<br>
The term "combination" as in the phrase "a first agent in combination with a second agent" includes co-administration of a first agent and a second agent, which for example may be dissolved or intermixed in the same pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, or administration of a first agent, followed by the second agent, or administration of the second agent, followed by the first agent. The present invention, therefore, relates to methods of combination therapeutic treatment and combination pharmaceutical compositions.<br><br>
The term "concomitant" as in the phrase "concomitant therapeutic treatment" includes administering an agent in the presence of a second agent. A concomitant therapeutic treatment method includes methods in which the first, second, third, or additional agents are co-administered. A concomitant therapeutic treatment method also includes methods in which the first or additional agents are administered in the presence of a second or additional agents, wherein the second or additional agents, for example, may have been previously administered. A concomitant therapeutic treatment method may be executed step-wise by different actors. For example, one actor may administer to a subject a first agent and a second actor may administer to the subject a second agent, and the administering steps may be executed at the same time, or nearly the same time, or at distant times, so long as the first agent (and additional agents) are after administration in the presence of the second agent (and additional agents). The actor and the subject may be the same entity (e.g., human).<br>
The combination of agents used within the methods and pharmaceutical compositions described herein may have a therapeutic additive or synergistic effect on the conditions) or disease(s) targeted for treatment. The combination of agents used within the methods or pharmaceutical compositions described herein also may reduce a detrimental effect associated with at least one of the agents when administered alone or without the other agent(s) of the particular pharmaceutical composition. For example, the toxicity of side effects of one agent may be attenuated by another agent of the composition, thus allowing a higher dosage, improving patient compliance, and improving therapeutic outcome. Physicians may achieve the clinical benefits of previously recognized drugs while using lower dosage levels, thus minimizing adverse side effects. The additive or synergistic effects, benefits, and advantages of the compositions apply to classes of therapeutic agents, either structural or functional classes, or to individual compounds themselves.<br>
The present methods and compositions relate to the treatment of amyloid-p diseases and conditions. As explained elsewhere herein, the various diseases and conditions involve several biological processes that produce the clinically recognized disease or condition. The inventors believe that targeting more than one of these biological processes simultaneously by the concomitant methods described herein enhances the therapeutic benefits of the individual agents. For example, potentiating the activity of the acetylcholine secreted by the remaining cholinergic neurons by administering cholinesterase inhibitors, while at the same time preventing further neuronal loss by enhancing clearance of Ap from the brain, is clearly desirable compared to the use of only one individual treatment. Because the therapeutic targets outlined herein are independent, yet interconnected, it is desirable to act on more than one target at the same time. Two agents administered simultaneously and acting on different targets may act synergistically to modify or ameliorate disease progression or symptoms. Accordingly, one embodiment of the invention is concomitant therapy with a pharmaceutical composition described herein. In<br><br>
another embodiment, the combination of the first agent of the invention with a second (therapeutic) agent produces an enhanced therapeutic profile, for example, a profile that is greater than the sum of the benefits of the treatment with each agent independently.<br>
In addition, Alzheimer's disease patients often suffer from secondary conditions such as depression, delusions and psychosis, or sleep disturbance. From the point of view of ease of manufacture, patient compliance, and ease of administration, it is advantageous to combine multiple medicines that the Alzheimer's patient self-administers into one combined medicament. Because of cognitive impairment, patient compliance among Alzheimer's disease patients is very low, and therefore the methods and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are especially advantageously applied to the treatment of this subject population because this combination of medicines is less likely to result in forgotten doses and may produce greater compliance. Combination of the compounds of the invention (/.e., the first agents of the compositions discussed below) with other palliative medications, which may be for diseases other than Alzheimer's, is another beneficial application of the present invention.<br>
In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein prevent or inhibit amyloid protein assembly into insoluble fibrils which, w v/vo, are deposited in various organs, or it reverses or favors deposition in subjects already having deposits. In another embodiment, the compound may also prevent the amyloid protein, in its soluble, oligomeric form or in its fibrillar form, from binding or adhering to a cell surface and causing cell damage or toxicity. In yet another embodiment, the composition may block amyloid-induced cellular toxicity or microglial activation. In another embodiment, the compound may block amyloid-induced neurotoxicity.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be administered therapeutically or prophylactically to treat diseases associated with amyloid-p fibril formation, aggregation or deposition. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may act to ameliorate the course of an amyloid-p related disease using any of the following mechanisms (this list is meant to be illustrative and not limiting): slowing the rate of amyloid-p fibril formation or deposition; lessening the degree of amyloid-p deposition; inhibiting, reducing, or preventing amyloid-p fibril formation; inhibiting neurodegeneration or cellular toxicity induced by amyloid-p; inhibiting amyloid-p induced inflammation; or enhancing the clearance of amyloid-p from the brain.<br>
The invention pertains to a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of an amyloid-P disease comprising a first agent and a second agent in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, where the first agent prevents or inhibits amyloid-p fibril formation, neurodegeneration, or cellular toxicity; and the second agent is a therapeutic drug or nutritive supplement<br>
Similarly, the invention includes a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of an amyloid-p disease comprising a first agent and a second agent in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, wherein the first agent prevent" ~" *"k:u:*o «««i/M/i_fi AMI formation, neurodegenera-<br><br>
tion, or cellular toxicity; and the second agent is a therapeutic drug or nutritive supplement, such that cognitive function is stabilized or further deterioration in cognitive function is prevented, slowed, or stopped.<br>

Furthermore, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also include a compound that increases the cerebral bioavailability of either the first agent or the second agent The invention also relates to the use of a first agent and a second agent in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment or prevention of an amyloid-p disease comprising a first agent and a second agent in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier,<br><br>
wnerein the tirst agent prevents or inhibits amyloid-P fibril formation, neurodegeneration, or cellular toxicity; and the second agent is a therapeutic drug or nutritive supplement<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be effective in controlling amyloid-p deposition either following their entry into the brain (following penetration of the blood brain barrier) or from the periphery. When acting from the periphery, a compound of a pharmaceutical composition may alter the equilibrium of Ap between the brain and the plasma so as to favor the exit of Aβ from the brain. An increase in the exit of Ap from the brain would result in a decrease in Ap brain concentration and therefore favor a decrease in Aβ deposition. Alternatively, compounds that penetrate the brain could control deposition by acting directly on brain Ap e.g., by maintaining it in a non-fibrillar form or favoring its clearance from the brain, or protecting brain cells from the detrimental effect of Ap. These compounds could also prevent Aβ in the brain from interacting with a cell surface and therefore prevent neurotoxicity or inflammation.<br>
In some aspects the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention contain a first agent that prevents or inhibits p-amyloid fibril formation, either in the brain or other organ of interest (acting locally) or throughout the entire body (acting systemically). Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors believe that the first agent as described herein may inhibit or reduce an interaction between amyloid-p and a cell surface constituent, for example, a glycosaminoglycan or proteoglycan constituent of a basement membrane, and that inhibiting or reducing this interaction is primarily responsible for the observed neuroprotective effects. For example, die first agent may also prevent an amyloid-P peptide from binding or adhering to a cell surface, a process which is known to cause cell damage or toxicity. Similarly, the first agent may block amyloid-induced cellular toxicity or microglial activation or amyloid-induced neurotoxicity, or inhibit amyloid-p induced inflammation. The first agent may also reduce the * rate or amount of p-amyloid aggregation, fibril formation, or deposition, or the first agent lessens the degree of amyloid-p deposition. The first agent may also inhibit, reduce, or prevent amyloid-P fibril formation.<br>
Additionally, the first agent may enhance the clearance of amyloid-p from the brain; or the first agent may favorably alter the equilibrium of amyloid-P between the brain and the plasma to decrease the amount of amyloid-p in die brain. The first agent may lower the levels of amyloid p peptides, e.g., both AP40 and Ap42 in.the CSF and the plasma, or the first agent may lower the levels of amyloid p peptides, e.g., Ap40 and Ap42 in the CSF and increase it in the plasma.<br>
Regardless of the particular mechanism by which the first agent exerts its biological effects, die first agent prevents or treats amyloid-p diseases, such as for example Alzheimer's disease. The first agent may reverse or favor deposition of amyloid in a subject having amyloid deposits, or the first agent may favor plaque clearance or slow deposition in a subject having<br><br>
amyloid deposits. For example, the first agent decreases the amyloid-p concentration in the brain of a subject versus an untreated subject, and the first agent penetrates into the brain, that is, it crosses the blood-brain barrier ("BBB") where is exerts it biological effect. Therefore, the first agent may maintain soluble amyloid in a non-fibrillar form. Accordingly, the first agent may . increase the rate of clearance of soluble amyloid from the brain of a subject versus an untreated subject.<br>

In another aspect of the invention, the amyloid-p peptide is a peptide having 39-43 amino-acids, which is an amyloidogenic peptide produced from J3APP.<br>
The "amyloid-p disease" (or "amyloid-p related disease," which terms as used herein are synonymous) may be Mild Cognitive Impairment; vascular dementia; Alzheimer's disease, including sporadic (non-hereditary) Alzheimer's disease and familial (hereditary) Alzheimer's disease; cerebral amyloid angiopathy or hereditary cerebral hemorrhage; senile dementia; Down's syndrome; inclusion body myositis; or age-related macular degeneration.<br>
In another embodiment, the method is used to treat Alzheimer's disease (e.g., sporadic or familial Alzheimer's disease). The method can also be used prophylactically or therapeutically to treat other clinical occurrences of amyloid-p deposition, such as in Down's syndrome individuals and in subjects with cerebral amyloid angiopathy ("CAA") or hereditary cerebral hemorrhage.<br>
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy ("CAA") refers to the specific deposition of amyloid fibrils in the walls of leptomingeal and cortical arteries, arterioles and in capillaries and veins. It is commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome and normal aging, as well as with a variety of familial conditions related to stroke or dementia (see Frangione, et al, Amyloid: 1 Protein Folding Disord. 8, Suppl. 1,36-42 (2001)). CAA can occur sporadically or be hereditary. Multiple mutation sites in either Ap or the APP gene have been identified and are<br><br>
clinically associated with either dementia or cerebral hemorrhage. Exemplary CAA disorders include, but are not limited to, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of Icelandic type (HCHWA-I); the Dutch variant of HCHWA (HCHWA-D; a mutation in A(3); the Flemish mutation of Aβ; the Arctic mutation of Aβ; the Italian mutation of Ap; the Iowa mutation of Ap; familial British dementia; and familial Danish dementia.<br>
Additionally, abnormal accumulation of APP and of amyloid-p protein in muscle fibers has been implicated in the pathology of sporadic inclusion body myositis ("IBM") (Askanas, et al, Proc. Natl Acad ScL USA 93,1314-19 (1996); Askanas, et al.t Current Opinion in Rheumatology 7,486-96 (1995)). Accordingly, the compounds of the invention can be used prophylactically or therapeutically in the treatment of disorders in which amyloid-p protein is abnormally deposited at non-neurological locations, such as treatment of IBM by delivery of the compounds to muscle fibers.<br>
Additionally, it has been shown that Ap is associated with abnormal extracellular deposits, known as drusen, that accumulate along the basal surface of the retinal pigmented epithelium in individuals with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). ARMD is a cause of irreversible vision loss in older individuals. It is believed that Ap deposition could be an important component of the local inflammatory events that contribute to atrophy of the retinal pigmented epithelium, drusen biogenesis, and the pathogenesis of ARMD (Johnson, et al9 Proc. Natl Acad. ScL USA 99(18), 11830-5 (2002)). Therefore, the invention also relates to the treatment or prevention of age-related macular degeneration.<br>
The invention pertains to pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use thereof for the treatment of amyloid-p diseases. The pharmaceutical compositions comprise a first agent that, e.g., prevents or inhibits amyloid-p fibril formation, neurodegeneration, or cellular toxicity. The pharmaceutical composition also comprises a second agent that is an active pharmaceutical ingredient; that is, the second agent is therapeutic and its function is beyond that of an inactive ingredient, such as a pharmaceutical carrier, preservative, diluent, or buffer. The second agent may be useful in treating or preventing an amyloid-P disease or another neurological disease. The first and second agents may exert their biological effects by similar or unrelated mechanisms of action; or either one or both of the first and second agents may exert their biological effects by a multiplicity of mechanisms of action. A pharmaceutical composition may also comprise a third compound, or even more yet, wherein the third (and fourth, etc.) compound has the same characteristics of a second agent The "second agenf * is selected in accord with the following therapeutic principles.<br><br>
Pharmacologic Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease and Other Amvloid-B Diseases<br>
The pathology of Alzheimer's disease includes a number of characteristic components, including but not limited to p-amyloid deposits, such as diffuse plaques and senile plaques; cytoskeletal pathology, such as hyperphosphoiylated tau and paired helical filaments; cholinergic degeneration, such as basal cholinergic neuronal loss and reduced ChAT in cortex and septum; inflammation, such as gliosis; and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction, such as cognitive loss, apathy and aggression. To reflect the varied characteristics of the disease, a variety of therapeutic approaches to the disease have been taken. To date, clinically validated treatments for Alzheimer's disease remain confined to symptomatic interventions such as treatment with enhancers of cognitive function, e.g., acetylcholinesterase, acetyl/ butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors, or NMDA receptor antagonists. There are no treatments known to slow the rate of cognitive decline in subjects.<br>
Several broad therapeutic strategies for disease-modifying agents are currently being approached. These include, for example, the following: inhibiting the P and gamma- secretase enzymes that generate Aβ from APP; preventing oligomerization or fibrillogenesis of Aβ or enhancing its clearance from the brain, e.g. by active or passive immunization with A3, by administering anti-fibrillogenic small molecule compounds or peptides, or by metal chelation; blocking or inhibiting inflammation and neurodegeneration induced by Ap; reducing the formation of phosphorylated Tau protein in the neurofibrillary tangles; and modulating cholesterol homeostasis. A range of compounds with antioxidant, neuroprotective or neurotrophic properties are contemplated for treating Alzheimer's disease; numerous approaches such as these and others are intended to be within the scope of the invention. See, e.g., J. Hardy, etal% Science 297,353-56 (2002).<br>
There are many different mechanisms by which these therapeutic approaches could treat Alzheimer's disease. For example, vaccination therapy could stimulate an immune response against Ap peptides, leading to clearance of the peptides from the body. P and gamma- secretase inhibitors could lead to decreased production of Ap peptides. Copper/zinc chelators such as clioquinol could decrease the interaction of copper and zinc with Ap peptides, leading to the clearance of amyloid plaques. Activating a-secretase, which cleaves within Aβ, would be expected to decrease the production of Ap and is thus another target.<br>
Pathways involved in neurodegeneration or apoptosis are also targets for therapeutic intervention. For example, the phosphorylation of poly Q ataxin by the Akt kinase is required for neurodegeneration, suggesting that the Akt kinase could be a target Orr, et al, Neuron 38(3), 375-87 (2003); Zoghbi, et al, Cell 113(4), 457-68 (2003). Tau is found in neurofibrillary tangles hyperphosphoiylated and inhibition of the kinases involved in its phosphorylation, e.g., GSK-3, is also a target See, e.g., WO 96/35,126.<br><br>
Many strategies for targeting amyloid include, inter alia, preventing oxidative damage with anti-oxidants (e.g., melatonin, curcumin); inhibiting amyloid formation or deposition with anti-aggregation agents (e.g., peptides, metal chelators, glycosaminoglycan mimetics); altering APP metabolism (e.g., with wortmannin or secretase inhibitors); shifting the equilibrium between levels of amyloidogenic peptides in the periphery and the central nervous system (e.g., with antibodies, vaccines, gelsolin, GM1, IGF-1) and decreasing microglial activation leading to inflammation (e.g., Fc, TGFJ31).<br>
Therapeutic treatment strategies may employ anti-fibrillogenic agents. For example, a therapeutic agent may bind to Aβ to prevent or inhibit its fibril formation. For example, the 16-21 region of the Ap peptide, KLVFFA, is responsible for the p-sheet formation and the intermolecular interactions of Ap during fibrillogenesis. Peptides from this region have been extensively tested for their antifibrillogenic activity (Tjernberg LO, et al, J. Biol Chem. 272, 12601-05 (1997); Findeis, et aL9 Biochemistry 38,6791-6800 (1999); Findeis, et al9 Amyloid, 231-41 (Dec 2001)). Agents, including non-peptidic agents, of the invention may be used as an anti-fibrillogenic agent in this way. The non-amyloidogenic pathway may be regulated through phosphorylation processes. Alteration of PKC levels and activity is one of the most consistent findings in Alzheimer's disease brain tissue. In addition, altered signal transduction mechanisms, particularly PKC, are found consistently in peripheral tissues from Alzheimer's disease subjects suggesting that these changes are not secondary to neuronal loss and may be directly involved in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Altered APP metabolism is a key event in the amyloid cascade hypothesis. The studies on the role of PKC in the regulated APP processing have established that the Ap forming amyloidogenic pathway and the a -secretase non-amyloidogenic pathway appear to be balanced. The target of PKC phosphorylation is not the APP molecule itself, yet the possibility that PKC targets directly the a-secretase or other key cellular factors possibly related to the vesicular trafficking of APP or the a-secretase, has not been resolved. M. Racchi, et al, Experimental Gerontology 38, 145-57 (2003). Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. One or more kinases are principally responsible for initiating the hyperphosphorylation of tau in vivo that leads to its apparent dissociation from microtubules and aggregation into insoluble paired helical filaments. Hyperphosphorylation of tau may underlie tangle formation in Alzheimer's disease. Calpain is responsible for cleavage of p35 and treating cells with Ap aggregates can trigger p35 activation and the subsequent cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of tau and perhaps other cytoplasmic substrates. D. Selkoe, Physiol. Rev. 81(2), 741-66 (2001). Suitable agents for use in the invention may target any of these biological processes.<br>
In some cases, one drug may target more than one therapeutic approach. For example, studies suggest that butyryl cholinesterase inhibitors which inhibit the activity of the cholinesterase enzyme are also associated with Ap (Darvesh, et aL, Cell. Mol Neurobiol 21,<br><br>
285-96 (2001)). Phenscrine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, may inhibit both the activity of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme and the processing or translation of the APP mRNA. Cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins, e.g. avorstatin, could increase processing of amyloid precursor protein by alpha-secretase, leading to the decreased production of Ap peptides. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, indomethacin, and sulindac sulphide, could selectively inhibit the production of the Ap42 peptide, in addition to inhibiting the inflammation induced by Ap. The decrease in Ap42 peptide that occurs in transgenic mice when administered fluribuprofin, marketed as Ansaid™ (Upjohn, now Pfizer, New York, New York), which is in Phase II human clinical trials Myriad Genetics, Inc. (Salt Lake City, Utah), has been correlated with improved memory and special learning.<br>
The method relates to a method for treating or preventing an amyloid-p related disease by administering at least two agents, each of which is a compound that exerts a therapeutic effect when so administered and is useful in treating or preventing a neurological or psychological condition or disease. The first compound of the invention, as described further below, may be an alkanesulfonic acid that is useful for treating or preventing an amyloid-P related disease. The second compound is therapeutic, i.e., its function is beyond that of an inactive ingredient, such as a pharmaceutical carrier, preservative, diluent, or buffer. The second compound may be useful in treating or preventing an amyloid-p related disease or another neurological disease. The second compound may also be useful in diminishing specific symptoms which are characteristic of Alzheimer*s disease (eg. memoiy loss, anxiety, etc.) The first and second compounds may exert their biological effects by similar or unrelated mechanisms of action; or either one or both of the first and second compounds may exert their biological effects by a multiplicity of mechanisms of action. A third compound, or even more yet, may likewise be used in a method of the invention, wherein the third (and fourth, etc.) compound has the same characteristics of a second compound.<br>
In one embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are formulated to be orally administered to a subject The first agent and said second agent may be simultaneously administered. The first agent and the second agent may modulate different biological processes in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The first agent and the second agent may act on different targets. For example, the first agent may be therapeutically useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and the second agent may be therapeutically useful in the treatment of CAA, The first agent and the second agent may have different binding affinities or specificities for peptides, proteins, or enzymes involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The first agent and the second agent, when simultaneously present in a subject, act synergistically to » reduce, inhibit, or ameliorate the symptoms or pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
The term "subject** includes living organisms in which amyloidosis can occur, or which are susceptible to amyloid diseases, e.g., Alzheimer's disease. Examples of subjects include<br><br>
humans, monkeys, cows, sheep, goats, dogs, cats, mice, rats, and transgenic species thereof. Administration of the compositions of the present invention to a subject to be treated can be carried out using known procedures, at dosages and for periods of time effective to modulate amyloid aggregation or amyloid-induced neurotoxicity in the subject as further described herein. An effective amount of the therapeutic compound necessary to achieve a therapeutic effect may vary according to factors such as the amount of amyloid already deposited at the clinical site in the subject, the age, sex, and weight of the subject, and the ability of the therapeutic compound to modulate amyloid aggregation in the subject. Dosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation.<br>
In an exemplary aspect of the invention, the subject is a human. For example, the subject may be a human over 40 years old, or a human over 50 years old, or a human over 60 years old, or even a human over 70 years old. The subject may be a female human, including a postmenopausal female human, who may be on hormone (estrogen) replacement therapy. The subject may also be a male human.<br>
A subject may be a human at risk for Alzheimer's disease, e.g., being over the age of 40 or having a predisposition for Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease predisposing factors identified or proposed in the scientific literature include, among others, a genotype predisposing a subject to Alzheimer's disease; environmental factors predisposing a subject to Alzheimer's disease; past history of infection by viral and bacterial agents predisposing a subject to Alzheimer's disease; and vascular factors predisposing a subject to Alzheimer's disease. A subject may also have one or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease (e.g., atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries, angina pectoris, and myocardial infarction) or cerebrovascular disease (eg., atherosclerosis of the intracranial or extracranial arteries, stroke, syncope, and transient ischemic attacks), such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoking, familial or previous history of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and cardiovascular disease. Hypercholesterolemia typically is defined as a serum total cholesterol concentration of greater than about 5.2 mmol/L (about 200 mg/dL).<br>
Several genotypes are believed to predispose a subject to Alzheimer's disease* These include the genotypes such as presenilin-1, presenilin-2, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) missense mutations associated with familial Alzheimer's disease, and a-2-macroglobulin and LRP-1 genotypes, which are thought to increase the risk of acquiring sporadic (late-onset) Alzheimer's disease. E,van Uden, et al, J. NeuroscL 22(21), 9298-304 (2002); JJLGoto, et aL, J. Mol. Neurosci. 19(1-2), 37-41 (2002). Another genetic risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease are variants of ApoE, the gene that encodes apolipoprotein E (particularly the apoE4 genotype), a constituent of the low-density lipoprotein particle. WJ Strittmatter, et aL,<br><br>
Annu. Rev. NeuroscL 19, 53-77 (1996). The molecular mechanisms by which the various ApoE alleles alter the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease are unknown, however the role of ApoE in cholesterol metabolism is consistent with the growing body of evidence linking cholesterol metabolism to Alzheimer's disease. For example, chronic use of cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins has recently been associated with a lower incidence of Alzheimer's disease, and cholesterol-lowering drugs have been shown to reduce pathology in APP transgenic mice. These and other studies suggest that cholesterol may affect APP processing. Environmental factors have been proposed as predisposing a subject to Alzheimer's disease, including exposure to aluminum, although the epidemiological evidence is ambiguous. In addition, prior infection by certain viral or bacterial agents may predispose a subject to Alzheimer's disease, including the herpes simplex virus and chlamydia pneumoniae. Finally, other predisposing factors for Alzheimer's disease can include risk factors for cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, including cigarette smoking, hypertension and diabetes. "At risk for Alzheimer's disease" also encompasses any other predisposing factors not listed above or as yet identified and includes an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease caused by head injury, medications, diet, or lifestyle.<br>

The methods of the invention may be applied as a therapy for a subject having Alzheimer's disease or a dementia, or the methods of the invention may be applied as a prophylaxis against Alzheimer's disease or dementia for subject with such a predisposition, as in a subject, e.g., with a genomic mutation in the APP gene, the ApoE gene, or a presenilin gene. The subject may have (or may be predisposed to developing or may be suspected of having) vascular dementia, or senile dementia, or Mild Cognitive Impairment. In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the subject may have another amyloid-p related disease such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or the subject may have amyloid deposits, especially amyloid-p amyloid deposits in the subject's brain.<br>
Definition of Dementia<br>
The essential features of a dementia are multiple cognitive deficits that include memory impairment and at least one of the following: aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or a disturbance in executive functioning (the ability to think abstractly and to plan, initiate, sequence, monitor, and stop complex behavior). The order of onset and relative prominence of the cognitive disturbances and associated symptoms vary with the specific type of dementia, as discussed in the following.<br><br>
Memory impairment is generally a prominent early symptom. Individuals with dementia have difficulty learning new material and may lose valuables, such as wallets and keys, or forget food cooking on the stove. In more severe dementia, individuals also forget previously learned material, including the names of loved ones. Individuals with dementia may have difficulty with spatial tasks, such as navigating around the house or in the immediate neighborhood (where difficulties with memory are unlikely to play a role). Poor judgment and poor insight are common as well. Individuals may exhibit little or no awareness of memory loss or other cognitive abnormalities. They may make unrealistic assessments of their abilities and make plans that are not congruent with their deficits and prognosis (e.g., planning to start a new business). They may underestimate the risks involved in activities (e.g., driving).<br>
In order to make a diagnosis of dementia, the cognitive deficits must be sufficiently severe to cause impairment in occupational or social functioning and must represent a decline from a previous level of functioning. The nature and degree of impairment are variable and often depend on the particular social setting of the individual. For example, Mild Cognitive Impairment may significantly impair an individual's ability to perform a complex job but not a less demanding one.<br>
Cognitive or degenerative brain disorders are characterized clinically by progressive loss of memoiy, cognition, reasoning, judgment and emotional stability that gradually leads to profound mental deterioration and ultimately death. It is generally believed that the disease begins a number of years before it manifests itself in the mild cognitive changes that are the early signs of Alzheimer's disease. "Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type" begins gradually, and is usually diagnosed after other specific causes have been ruled out Diagnostic criteria for Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type include the development of multiple cognitive deficits manifested by both memory impairment (anterograde or retrograde, i.e., impaired ability to learn new information or to recall previously learned information); and one or more of the following cognitive disturbances: aphasia (language disturbance), apraxia (impaired ability to carry out motor activities despite intact motor function), agnosia (failure to recognize or identify objects despite intact sensory function), disturbance in executive functioning (/.., planning, organizing, sequencing, and abstracting); where these cognitive deficits each cause significant impairment in social or occupational functioning and represent a significant decline from a previous level of functioning. The course is characterized by gradual onset and continuing cognitive decline, and the cognitive deficits are not due to another condition that causes progressive deficits in mejnoiy and cognition (e,g., cerebrovascular disease, brain tumor, hypothyroidism, vitamin B or folic acid deficiency, niacin deficiency, hypercalcemia, neurosyphilis, HTV infection, or chemical exposure). The cognitive disturbance may be accompanied by a behavioral disturbance, such as ' wandering, aggression, or agitation, or a psychological disturbance, such as depression or psychosis. See "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders," 4* Ed., Text Revision,<br><br>
by American Psychiatric Association (2000). For example, the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's Disease (McKhann et al% 1984, Neurology 34:939-944). The patient's cognitive function can be assessed by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscaie (ADAS-cog; Rosen, etal, 1984,^/w. J. Psychiatry 141:1356-1364).<br>
Alzheimer's Disease Is the prototype of a cortical degenerative disease. A major component of the presenting symptoms is usually subjective complaints of memory difficulty, language impairment, dyspraxia, at which point diagnosis is primarily based on exclusion of other possible etiologies for dementia. No features of the physical examination or laboratory evaluation are pathognomonic for dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Some studies have apparently discriminated patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type from patients with dementia of other etiologies and from normal controls by using techniques such as EEG, MRI, and SPECT, but these studies have been difficult to replicate consistently, and at present, brain-imaging studies are best used to exclude other identifiable causes.<br>
A variety of diagnostic tests have been developed for Alzheimer's disease. Clinical criteria have been verified prospectively in autopsy studies and have been found to be highly specific although only moderately sensitive. Implementation of the criteria requires extensive evaluation, including an informant-based history, neurological examination, neuropsychological testing, and laboratory, and neuroimaging data. Alzheimer's disease is characterized pathologically by generalized atrophy of the cerebral cortex and by neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic (amyloid) plaques, and granulovacuolar degeneration. Although plaques and tangles may be detected in the brains of the elderly without Alzheimer's disease, they are more numerous in patients with dementia. Controversy remains whether brains with plaques from individuals without Alzheimer's diseasewere "normal variations" or early pathological signs of incipient disease. A definitive diagnosis ultimately requires both the characteristic dementia in life and the characteristic pathology after death.<br>
The natural course of Alzheimer's disease is exacerbation and progression of clinical symptomatology. Brain degeneration as measured by in vivo imaging techniques such as MRI has not been found to correlate closely with the state of clinical disease. The final common clinical picture is of a bedridden patient, wholly dependent on others for all basic functions, even for turning in bed. Nutrition can often be provided only by nasogastric or gastrointestinal tubes.<br>
The study of the pathobiology of Alzheimer's disease has identified at least four chromosomal loci associated with familial cases; the degeneration of central neurochemical systems, especially basal forebrain structures related to acetylcholine-mediated neurotransmission; factors associated with the formation of plaques and tangles; and exogenous (e.g., infectious and toxic) processes that may contribute to the development of sporadic cases. •<br><br>
Although amyloid itself is a normal brain product, excessive amounts of oligomeric or fibrillar forms of Ap may be neurotoxic.<br>
For Alzheimer's disease, advanced age and a family history of the disease are the greatest important risk factor. A family history of Down's syndrome or of hematological malignancies, such as leukemia, myelolymphoma, or Hodgkin's disease, is also associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. For Alzheimer's disease, other risk factors identified tentatively in recent years include female sex, a past history of head trauma, and lower education. Vascular dementias are highly associated with the risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. Those factors include hypertension (especially with systolic pressures greater than 160 mmHg), cardiac disease, transient ischemic attacks, diabetes mellitus, carotid bruits, and sickle cell disease. Obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and elevated serum cholesterol and lipid levels may also be risk factors for cerebrovascular disease.<br>
A general physical examination is a routine component of the workup for Alzheimer's disease. It may reveal evidence of systemic disease causing brain dysfunction, such as an enlarged liver and hepatic encephalopathy, or it may demonstrate systemic disease related to particular CNS processes. Focal neurological findings, such as asymmetrical hyperreflexia or weakness, are seen more often, in vascular than in degenerative diseases. Frontal release signs and primitive reflexes, while suggesting pathology in the frontal lobe, are present in many disorders and often point to a greater extent of progression. The first step in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is to exclude delirium, which may be distinguished from dementia by its cardinal feature: disturbance of consciousness. Level of consciousness or arousal should be determined to be stable before a diagnosis of Alzheimer's diseasecan be made with confidence. It should also be distinguished from focal or specific cognitive impairments, such as those seen in aphasic or amnestic patients. Mood disorders can present with cognitive symptoms, particularly in the dementia of depression or pseudodementia. A history of a mood disorder or a current disturbance in neurovegetative function indicates the possibility of a major depressive disorder.<br>
The course and prognosis of a dementia syndrome vary with its cause. Alzheimer's diseasedoes not necessarily equal progressive deterioration, although many of the pathobiological processes underlying dementia are degenerative. The rate of progression may vary within families or from individual to individual. Age at onset is an important feature of Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia in the United States. Onset usually occurs after age 60 years and the prevalence increases exponentially with each successive decade, although cases have been reported in patients as young as 30 years. Familial forms of dementia of the Alzheimer's type appear to have an earlier age at onset. Cerebrovascular disease, the second most common cause of Alzheimer's disease, is associated with an earlier age at onset overall.<br><br>
As a class, the dementias can be distinguished to some extent by their course, especially earlier in the disease process. Degenerative dementias are insidious in onset and gradually progressive. Despite the clinical rule of a steadily progressive course in dementia of the Alzheimer's type, some individuals may reach a plateau for several years in the overall functional impairment before progression resumes and continues on to death. Vascular dementias may follow a stepwise pattern, in which new deficits appear abruptly and are associated with new vascular events, but the vascular dementias also often have an insidious onset and a slow but steadily progressive course. The first step in the treatment of dementia is verification of the diagnosis. Preventive pharmacological agents include antihypertensive, anticoagulant, or antiplatelet agents. Blood pressure control has been demonstrated to improve cognitive function in patients with vascular dementia, but it should be noted that antihypertensive beta-blocking agents have been associated with exaggeration of cognitive impairment. Angiotensin-converting enzyme ("ACE") inhibitors and diuretics have not been linked to the exaggeration of cognitive impairment and are thought to lower blood pressure without affecting cerebral blood flow (cerebral blood flow is presumed to correlate with cognitive function). Surgical removal of carotid plaques may prevent subsequent vascular events in carefully selected patients.<br>
Numerous neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, GABA, and serotonin, and several neuropeptides, including somatostatin and substance P, are decreased in dementia. Multiple neuropharmacologicai strategies have been devised in the hope of replenishing the deficient neurotransmitters. Replacement therapy for acetylcholine has been the most common and widely publicized strategy. Efforts at replenishment have included the use of acetylcholine precursors, e.g., choline salycilate (Arthropan™, Purdue Pharma, L.P., Stamford, Connecticut) and lecithin from polyenylphosphatidylcholine (Phoschol™, Nutrasal LLC, Oxford, Connecticut); cholinergic agonists, e.g., arecoline (methyl iV-methyltetrahydronicotinate, and cholinesterase inhibitors, such as described herein. Instead of targeting a neurotransmitter defect, other strategies are directed toward neuronal protection and regeneration. Selegiline (Eldepryl™, Somerset, Tampa, Florida), a monoamine oxidase ("MAO") type B ("MAO-B") inhibitor, slows die progression of Parkinson's disease, presumably by limiting endogenous generation of destructive oxidative products, and the same effect may be used therapeutically in the treatment of Alzheimer's patients. Similar antioxidant treatments are being used experimentally with other dementias, including Huntington's disease and vascular dementia. Naloxone (Narcan), an opiate antagonist, is thought to have possible application in vascular dementia based on animal studies in which it was demonstrated to decrease the sequelae of cerebral ischemia. See, e.g., C.Stowe, etal,Ann:Pharmacother. 27,447-48 (1993). Nerve growth factor is being studied as a means of promoting neural regeneration or sprouting.<br><br>
As used herein, "treatment" of a subject includes the application or administration of a composition of the invention to a subject, or application or administration of a composition of the invention to a cell or tissue from a subject, who has a amyloid-p related disease or condition, has a symptom of such a disease or condition, or is at risk of (or susceptible to) such a disease or condition, with the purpose of curing, healing, alleviating, relieving, altering, remedying, ameliorating, improving, or affecting the disease or condition, the symptom of the disease or condition, or the risk of (or susceptibility to) the disease or condition. The term "treating" refers to any indicia of success in the treatment or amelioration of an injury, pathology or condition, including any objective or subjective parameter such as abatement; remission; diminishing of symptoms or making the injury, pathology or condition more tolerable to the subject; slowing in the rate of degeneration or decline; making the final point of degeneration less debilitating; improving a subject's physical or mental well-being; or, in some situations, preventing the onset of dementia. The treatment or amelioration of symptoms can be based on objective or subjective parameters; including the results of a physical examination or a psychiatric evaluation. For example, the methods of the invention successfully treat a subject's dementia by slowing the rate of or extent of cognitive decline.<br>
Also, the invention relates to a method for preventing or inhibiting amyloid production in a subject. For example, such a method comprises administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention capable of reducing the concentration of Aβ, such that amyloid production or accumulation is prevented or inhibited.<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to a method where at least the first compound is for preventing, reducing, or inhibiting amyloid production in a subject. For example, such a method comprises administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition capable of inhibiting Ap accumulation, such that Af3 amyloidosis is prevented, reduced, or inhibited.<br>
"Inhibition" of amyloid deposition includes preventing or stopping of amyloid formation, e.g,, fibrillogenesis, clearance of soluble Ap from brain, inhibiting or slowing down of further amyloid deposition in a subject with amyloidosis, e.g., already having amyloid deposits, and reducing or reversing amyloid fibrillogenesis or deposits in a subject with ongoing amyloidosis. Inhibition of amyloid deposition is determined relative to an untreated subject, or relative to the treated subject prior to treatment, or, e.g., determined by clinically measurable improvement, e.g., or in the case of a subject with brain amyloidosis, e.g., an Alzheimer's or cerebral amyloid angiopathy subject, stabilization of cognitive function or prevention of a further decrease in cognitive function (te., preventing, slowing, or stopping disease progression), or improvement of parameters such as the concentration of Ap or tau in the CSF.<br>
"Modulation" of amyloid deposition includes both inhibition, as defined above, and enhancement of amyloid deposition or fibril formation. The term "modulating" is intended,<br><br>
therefore, to encompass prevention or stopping of amyloid formation or accumulation, inhibition or slowing down of further amyloid aggregation in a subject with ongoing amyloidosis, e.g., already having amyloid aggregates, and reducing or reversing of amyloid aggregates in a subject with ongoing amyloidosis; and enhancing amyloid deposition, e.g., increasing the rate or amount of amyloid deposition in vivo or in vitro. Amyloid-enhancing compounds may be useful in animal models of amyloidosis, for example, to make possible the development of amyloid deposits in animals in a shorter period of time or to increase amyjoid deposits over a selected period of time. Amyloid-enhancing compounds may be useful in screening assays for compounds which inhibit amyloidosis in vivo, for example, in animal models, cellular assays and in vitro assays for amyloidosis. Such compounds may be used, for example, to provide faster or more sensitive assays for compounds. In some cases, amyloid enhancing compounds may also be administered for therapeutic purposes, e.g., toenhance the deposition of amyloid in the lumen rather than the wall of cerebral blood vessels to prevent CAA. Modulation of amyloid aggregation is determined relative to an untreated subject or relative to the treated subject prior to treatment.<br>
In an embodiment, the method is used to treat Alzheimer's disease (e.g., sporadic or familial Alzheimer's disease). The method may also be used prophylactically or therapeutically to treat other clinical occurrences of amyloid-p deposition, such as in Down's syndrome individuals and in subjects with hereditary or sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy ("CAA"), which lead to cerebral hemorrhage (or hemorrhagic stroke).<br>
Additionally, abnormal accumulation of APP and of amyloid-P protein in muscle fibers has been implicated in the pathology of sporadic inclusion body myositis ("IBM") (Askanas, et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 93,1314-19 (1996); Askanas, etal, Current Opinion in Rheumatology 7,486-96 (1995)). Accordingly, the compounds of the invention can be used prophylactically or therapeutically in the treatment of disorders in which amyloid-p protein is abnormally deposited at non-neurological locations, such as treatment of IBM by deliveiy of the compounds to muscle fibers.<br>
Additionally, it has been shown that Ap is associated with abnormal extracellular deposits, known as drusen, that accumulate along the basal surface of the retinal pigmented epithelium in individuals with age-related macular degeneration ("ARMD"). ARMD is a cause of irreversible vision loss in older individuals. It is believed that Ap deposition could be an important component of the local inflammatory events that contribute to atrophy of the retinal pigmented epithelium, drusen biogenesis, and the pathogenesis of ARMD (Johnson, et al, Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 99(18), 11830-5 (2002)).<br>
The present invention therefore relates to the use of a first agent, e.g., an alkanesulfonic acid compound, in the prevention or treatment of amyloid-p related diseases, including, inter alia, Alzheimer's disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, inclusion body myositis, Down's<br><br>
syndrome, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and macular degeneration, in combination with a second therapeutic agent.<br>
Accordingly, the invention relates to methods employing and compositions including substituted or unsubstituted alkylsulfonic acids that are substituted or unsubstituted straight- chain alkylsulfonic acids, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkylsulfonic acids, and substituted or unsubstituted branched- chain alkylsulfonic acids. Also, it is noted that the term "alkylsulfonic acid" as used herein is to be interpreted as being synonymous with the term "alkanesulfonic acid."<br>
In another embodiment, the subject has mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is a condition characterized by a state of mild but measurable impairment in thinking skills, but is not necessarily associated with the presence of dementia. MCI frequently, but not necessarily, precedes Alzheimer's disease. It is a diagnosis that has most often been associated with mild memory problems, but it can also be characterized by mild impairments in other thinking skills, such as language or planning skills. However, in general, an individual with MCI will have more significant memory lapses than would be expected for someone of their age or educational background. As the condition progresses, a physician may change the diagnosis to Mild-to-Moderate Cognition Impairment, as is well understood in this art.<br>
In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein prevent or inhibit amyloid protein assembly into insoluble fibrils which, in vivo, are deposited in various organs, or it reverses or fevors deposition in subjects already having deposits. In another embodiment, the agent may also prevent the amyloid protein, in its soluble, oligomeric form or in its fibrillar form, from binding or adhering to a cell surface and causing cell damage or toxicity. In yet another embodiment, the agent may block amyloid-induced cellular toxicity or microglial activation. In another embodiment, the agent may block amyloid-induced neurotoxicity.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be administered therapeutically or prophylactically to treat diseases associated with amyloid-P fibril formation, aggregation or deposition. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may act to ameliorate the course of an amyloid-p related disease using any of the following mechanisms (this list is meant to be illustrative and not limiting): slowing the rate of amyloid-^ fibri) formation or deposition; lessening the degree of amyloid-p deposition; inhibiting, reducing, or preventing amyloid-p fibril formation; inhibiting neurodegeneration or cellular toxicity induced by amyloid-P; inhibiting amyloid-p induced inflammation; or enhancing the clearance of amyloid-p from the brain ;or enhancing the catabolism or degradation of amyloid-P; or lowering the levels of amyloid-p in the CSF; or modulating the levels of amyloid-p in the plasma.. Another way of decreasing Aβ could be that these compounds act on secretases so that Ap levels are reduced (as seen with proteoglycans).<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be effective in controlling amyloid-P deposition either following their entry into the brain (following penetration of the blood brain barrier) or from the periphery. When acting from the periphery, an agent of a pharmaceutical composition may alter the equilibrium of Aβ between the brain and the plasma so as to favor the exit of A3 from the brain. An increase in the exit of Ap from the brain would result in a decrease in Aβ brain concentration and therefore favor a decrease in Aβ deposition. Alternatively, agents that penetrate the brain could control deposition by acting directly on brain Ap, e.g., by maintaining it in a non-ftbrillar form or favoring its clearance from the brain or enhancing its degradation rate in the brain or in the peripheral organs. These agents may also prevent Aβ in the brain from interacting with a cell surface and therefore prevent neurotoxicity or inflammation.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be administered therapeutically or prophylactically to treat diseases associated with amyloid-p fibril formation, aggregation, or deposition. The compositions of the invention may act to ameliorate the course of an amyloid-p related disease by a variety of mechanisms. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein prevent or inhibit amyloid protein assembly into insoluble fibrils which, in vivo, are deposited in various organs, or it favors plaque clearance or slows deposition in subjects already having deposits. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions may also prevent the amyloid protein, in its soluble, oligomeric form or in its fibrillar form, from binding or adhering to a cell surface and causing cell damage or toxicity. In yet another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions may block amyloid toxicity. In other embodiments, the agent may act be slowing the rate of amyloid-p fibril formation or deposition. In yet another embodiment, the agent may lessen the degree of amyloid-P deposition. Still other examples include inhibiting, reducing, or preventing amyloid-p fibril formation; inhibiting neurodegeneration or cellular toxicity induced by amyloid-P; inhibiting amyloid-p induced inflammation; or enhancing the clearance of amyloid-p from the brain brain or enhancing its degradation rate in die brain or in the peripheral organs.<br>
At least one of the therapeutic agents of the invention may be effective in controlling amyloid-P deposition either following their entry into the brain (following penetration of the blood brain barrier) or from the periphery. When acting from the periphery, an agent may alter the equilibrium of Aβ between the brain and the plasma so as to favor the exit of Ap from the brain. An increase in the exit of Ap from the brain would result in a decrease in Aβ brain concentration and therefore favor a decrease in Ap deposition. Alternatively, agents that penetrate the brain could control deposition by acting directly on brain Aβ, e.g., by maintaining it in a non-fibrillar form or favoring its clearance from the brain, or by favoring catabolism or acting on secretase so that Ap production is reduced.<br><br>
In one aspect, the invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising two agents, each of which exerts a therapeutic effect when administered to a subject in need thereof, and is useful in treating or preventing a neurological disease. The first agent of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention is selected from substituted and unsubstituted alkanesulfonic acids and alkanesulftiric acids that are useful for treating or preventing an amyloid-p related disease. The second agent is therapeutic, /.*., its function is beyond that of an inactive ingredient, such as a pharmaceutical carrier, preservative, diluent, or buffer. The second agent may be useful in treating or preventing an amyloid-p related disease or another neurological disease. The first and second agents may exert their biological effects by similar or unrelated mechanisms of action; or either one or both of the first and second agents may exert their biological effects by a multiplicity of mechanisms of action. A pharmaceutical composition may also comprise a third agent, or even more yet, wherein the third (and fourth, etc.) agent has the same characteristics of a second agent<br>
The invention also relates to packaged pharmaceutical products containing two agents, each of which exerts a therapeutic effect when administered to a subject in need thereof, and is useful in treating or preventing a neurological disease. The first agent of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be selected from substituted and unsubstituted alkanesulfonic acids and alkanesulftiric acids that are useful for treating or preventing an amyloid-p related disease. The second agent is therapeutic, Le.y its function is beyond that of an inactive ingredient, such as a pharmaceutical carrier, preservative, diluent, or buffer. The second agent may be useful in treating or preventing an amyloid-p related disease or another neurological disease. The agents may exert their biological effects by similar or unrelated mechanisms of action; or either one or more than one of the agents may exert their biological effects by a multiplicity of mechanisms. A pharmaceutical composition may also comprise a third agent, or even more agents yet, wherein the third (and fourth, etc.) agent has the same characteristics of a second agent In some cases, the individual agents may be packaged in separate containers for sale or delivery to the consumer. The agents of the invention may be supplied in a solution with an appropriate solvent or in a solvent-free form (e.g., lyophilized). Additional components may include acids, bases, buffering agents, inorganic salts, solvents, antioxidants, preservatives, or metal chelators. The additional kit components are present as pure compositions, or as aqueous or organic solutions that incorporate one or more additional kit components. Any or all of the kit components optionally further comprise buffers.<br>
The present invention also includes packaged pharmaceutical products containing a first agent in combination with (e.g., intermixed with) a second agent The invention also includes a pharmaceutical product comprising a first agent packaged with instructions for using the first agent in the presence of a second agent or instructions for use of the first agent in a method of the invention. The invention also includes a pharmaceutical product comprising a second or<br><br>
additional agents packaged with instructions for using the second or additional agents in the presence of a first agent or instructions for use of the second or additional agents in a method of the invention. Alternatively, the packaged pharmaceutical product may contain at least one of the agents and the product may be promoted for use with a second agent.<br>
"Inhibition" of amyloid deposition includes preventing or stopping of amyloid formation, e.g., fibrillogenesis, inhibiting or slowing down of further amyloid deposition in a subject with amyloidosis, e.g., already having amyloid deposits, and reducing or reversing amyloid fibrillogenesis or deposits in a subject with ongoing amyloidosis. Inhibition of amyloid deposition is determined relative to an untreated subject, or relative to the treated subject prior to treatment, or, e.g., in the case of a subject with brain amyloidosis, e.g., an Alzheimer's or cerebral amyloid angiopathy subject, stabilization of cognitive function or prevention of a further decrease in cognitive function (i.e., preventing, slowing, or stopping disease progression).<br>
The term "modulating" is intended to encompass prevention or stopping of amyloid formation or accumulation, inhibition or slowing down of further amyloid aggregation in a subject with ongoing amyloidosis, e.g., already having amyloid aggregates, and reducing or reversing of amyloid aggregates in a subject with ongoing amyloidosis; and enhancing amyloid deposition, e.g., increasing the rate or amount of amyloid deposition in vivo or in vitro. Amyloid-enhancing compounds may be useful in animal models of amyloidosis, for example, to make possible the development of amyloid deposits in animals in a shorter period of time or to increase amyloid deposits over a selected period of time. Amyloid-enhancing compounds may be useful in screening assays for compounds which inhibit amyloidosis in vivo, for example, in animal models, cellular assays and in vitro assays for amyloidosis. Such compounds may be used, for example, to provide faster or more sensitive assays for compounds. In some cases, amyloid enhancing compounds may also be administered for therapeutic purposes, e.g., to enhance the deposition of amyloid in the lumen rather than the wall of cerebral blood vessels to prevent CAA. Modulation of amyloid aggregation is determined relative to an untreated subject or relative to the treated subject prior to treatment.<br>
As used herein, "treatment" of a subject includes the application or administration of a therapeutic agent to a subject, or application or administration of a therapeutic agent to a cell or tissue from a subject, who has a diseases or disorder, has a symptom of a disease or disorder, or is at risk of (or susceptible to) a disease or disorder, with the purpose of curing, healing, alleviating, relieving, altering, remedying, ameliorating, improving, or affecting the disease or disorder, the symptom of die disease or disorder, or the risk of (or susceptibility to) the disease or disorder.<br>
This invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of a condition selected from mental retardation, developmental disorders, disruptive behavioral disorders, organic mental disorders (including dementia and psychoactive substance induced<br><br>
organic mental disorders), psychoactive substance abuse disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, dissociative disorders, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia and personality disorders in a human, comprising an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor. The second agent may also be a neurotransmitter-release enhancer, i.e., they possess the ability to enhance or stimulate the release of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin in humans. They are therefore able to function as therapeutic agents in the treatment of a variety of conditions in humans, the treatment or prevention of which can be effected or facilitated by the enhancement or stimulation of acetylcholine, dopamine, or serotonin release. Such conditions include Alzheimer's disease, age associated memory impairment and Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Parkinson's disease. They also include mental retardation, developmental disorders, disruptive behavioral disorders, organic mental disorders (including dementia and psychoactive substance induced organic mental disorders), psychoactive substance abuse disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, dissociative disorders, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, and personality disorders.<br>
The invention is also ideally suited for the treatment of familiar or hereditary forms of Alzheimer's disease because, for example, therapeutic prophylactic pharmaceutical treatment could be initiated earlier in a patient's life. Presently, all therapeutic regimens that are commercially available treat only the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, as explained elsewhere herein. The present invention provides methods and compositions, however, that treat the underlying etiology of the disease itself, and therefore may be used in a prophylactic manner. The biological processes that give rise to Alzheimer's disease may occur in a person for some time before clinically observable symptoms arise. Ordinarily, according to current medical science, such a period in a person's life would be undetectable and treatment with current medicines would be useless. For people with an identified predisposition for developing Alzheimer's disease compositions of the present invention may delay the onset of symptoms.<br>
Furthermore, the invention pertains to any novel chemical agent described herein. That is, the invention relates to novel agents, and novel methods of their use as described herein, including those coumpounds that may be within the scope of the Formulae disclosed herein, and<br>
which are not disclosed in the cited Patents and Patent Applications.<br>

In one aspect, the invention pertains to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an alkanesulfonic acid and a second agent that is useful in the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's disease. The second agent may be curative, Lc, modulate the causative agents of Alzheimer's disease, or it may be palliative, i.e., alleviate the symptoms of the disease, e.g., by enhancing memory or improving cognitive function. The second agent may be a drug that is useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease itself, or it may be used to treat a condition associated with Alzheimer's disease, e.g. a secondary condition, or it may be a drug commonly prescribed to Alzheimer's disease subjects.<br>
According to current understanding of the natural history of Alzheimer's disease, several different drug targets have been identified. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention may comprise a second agent that is specific for any one of the biological processes giving rise to the clinical presentation of Alzheimer's disease. The invention is not to be considered bound by any particular theory of the etiology of Alzheimer's disease, and so the second agent according to the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be any agent that either by itself or in combination with an alkanesulfonic acid is empirically observed to be efficacious in the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, a summary of the biological processes believed to give rise to Alzheimer's disease itself or the symptoms thereof is useful inasmuch as any one of these biological processes may be modulated by a second agent in a pharmaceutical composition of the invention.<br>
The language "in combination with" a second agent or treatment includes co-administration of an alkanesulfonic acid, administration of an alkanesulfonic acid first,<br><br>
followed by the second, or treatment and administration of the second agent first, followed by an alkanesulfonic acid.<br>
The condition associated with Alzheimer's disease may be a symptom characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, for example, hypothyroidism, cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease, memoiy loss, anxiety, or a behavioral dysfunction (e.g., apathy, aggression, or incontinence); a psychological condition or a neurological condition.

The First Apent<br>
Compositions of certain alkanesulfiir-oxides, including alkanesulfonic acids and alkanesulfuric acids, and more particularly including, for example, 3-amino-l-propanesuIfonic acid and certain salts thereof have been shown to be useful in the treatment of amyloid-p related diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. See WO 96/28187, WO 01/85093, and U.S. Pat. No, 5,840,294. The anionic group of the composition is believed to inhibit an interaction between an'amyloidogenic protein and a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) or proteoglycan constituent of a basement membrane to thus inhibit amyloid deposition.<br><br>
The ability of a therapeutic compound of the invention to inhibit an interaction between an amyloidogenic protein and a glycoprotein or proteoglycan constituent of a basement membrane can be assessed by an in vitro binding assay, such as that described herein or in U.S. . Pat. No. 5,164,295. Briefly, a solid support such as a polystyrene microtiter plate is coated with an amyloidogenic protein (e.g., serum amyloid A protein or p-amyioid precursor protein (P-APP)) and any residual hydrophobic surfaces are blocked. The coated solid support is incubated with various concentrations of a constituent of basement membrane, for example HSPG, either in the presence or absence of a compound to be tested. The solid support is washed extensively to remove unbound material. The binding of the basement membrane constituent {e.g., HSPG) to the amyloidogenic protein (e.g., p-APP) is then measured using an antibody directed against the basement membrane constituent that is conjugated to a detectable substance (e.g., an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase) by detecting the detectable substance. A compound which inhibits an interaction between an amyloidogenic protein and a glycoprotein or proteoglycan constituent of a basement membrane will reduce the amount of substance detected (e.g., will inhibit the amount of enzyme activity detected). A therapeutic compound of the invention may interact with a binding site for a basement membrane glycoprotein or proteoglycan in an amyloidogenic protein and thereby inhibit the binding of the amyloidogenic protein to the basement membrane constituent. Basement membrane glycoproteins and proteoglycans include laminin, collagen type IV, fibronectin and heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), perlecan, and agrin. In a similar embodiment, the therapeutic compound inhibits an interaction between an amyloidogenic protein and HSPG. Consensus binding site motifs for HSPG in amyloidogenic proteins have been described {see, e.g., Cardin and Weintraub, Arteriosclerosis 9,21-32 (1989)).<br>
The method also relates to a method for treating or preventing an amyloid-P related disease by administering at least two agents, each of which exerts a therapeutic effect when so administered and is useful in treating or preventing a neurological disease. The first agent of the invention is selected from alkanesulfonic acids that are useful for treating or preventing an amyloid-P related disease. The second agent is therapeutic, i.e., its function is beyond that of an inactive ingredient, such as a pharmaceutical carrier, preservative, diluent, or buffer. The second agent may be useful in treating or preventing an amyloid-p related disease or another neurological disease. The second agent may also be useful in diminishing specific symptoms which are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (e.g., memory loss, anxiety, etc.). The first and second agents may exert their biological effects by similar or unrelated mechanisms of action; or either one or both of the first and second agents may exert their biological effects by a multiplicity of mechanisms of action. A third agent, or even more yet, may likewise be used in a method of the invention, wherein the third (and fourth, etc.) agent has the same characteristics of a second agent The invention relates to a method of treating or preventing an amyloid-P related disease in a subject (for example, a human) comprising administering to the subject a theraneutic<br><br>
amount of a alkanesulfonic acid, such that amyloid fibril formation or deposition, neurodegeneration, or cellular toxicity is reduced or inhibited. In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method of treating or preventing an amyloid-p related in a subject (for example, a human) comprising administering to the subject a therapeutic amount of an alkanesulfonic acid, such that cognitive function is stabilized or further deterioration in cognitive function is prevented, slowed, or stopped in subjects with brain amyloidosis, e.g., Alzheimer's disease or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method of treating or preventing an amyloid-p disease in a subject (for example, human) comprising administering to the subject a therapeutic amount of a alkanesulfonic acid, such that activities of daily living are improved or stabilized in subjects with brain amyloidosis, e.g., Alzheimer's disease.<br>

That is, unless otherwise stipulated, any chiral carbon center may be of either (#)- or (5)-stereochemistiy. Such isomers can be obtained in substantially pure form by classical separation techniques and by stereochemically-controlled synthesis. In addition, the compounds of the present invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with acceptable solvents such as water, THF, ethanol, and the like. In general, the solvated forms are considered equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the present invention. The term "solvate" represents an aggregate that comprises one or more molecules of a compound, with one or more molecules of a pharmaceutical solvent, such as water, ethanol, and the like.<br>
In certain embodiments, a straight-chain or branched-chain alkyl group may have 30 or fewer carbon atoms in its backbone, e.g., C1-C30 for straight-chain or C3-C30 for branched-chain. In certain embodiments, a straight-chain or branched-chain alkyl group may have 20 or fewer carbon atoms in its backbone, e.g., Q-C20 for straight-chain or C3-C20 for branched-chain, and more, for example, 18 or fewer.

Likewise, cycloalkyl groups may have from 3-8 carbon atoms in their ring structure, for example, 5 or 6 carbons hi the ring structure. The term "Ci-Ce" as in "Cj-Q alkyl" means alkyl groups containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Moreover, unless otherwise specified the term alkyl includes both "unsubstituted alkyls" and "substituted alkyls," the latter of which refers to alkyl groups having substituents replacing one or more hydrogens on one or more carbons of the hydrocarbon backbone. Such substituents may include, for example, alkenyl, alkynyl, halogeno, hydroxy!, alkylcarbonyloxy,<br><br>
arylcarbonyloxy, alkoxycarbonyloxy, aryloxycarbonyloxy, carboxylate, alkylcarbonyl, arylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl, dialkylaminocarbonyl, alkylthiocarbonyl, alkoxyi, phosphate, phosphonato, phosphinato, cyano, amino (including alkyl amino, dialkylamino, arylamino, diarylamino, and alkylarylamino), acylamino (including alkylcarbonylamino, arylcarbonylamino, carbamoyl and ureido), amidino, imino, sulfhydryl, alkylthio, arylthio, thiocarboxylate, sulfates, alkanesulfiny!, sulfonato, sulfamoyl, sulfonamido, nitro, trifluoromethyl, cyano, azido, heterocyclyl, alkylaryl, or aromatic (including heteroaromatic) groups.<br>

Thus, the term amino includes cyclic amino moieties such as piperidinyl or pyrrolidinyl groups, unless otherwise stated. Thus, the term "alkylamino" as used herein means an alkyl group having an amino group attached thereto. Suitable alkylamino groups include groups having 1 to about 12 carbon atoms, for example, 1 to about 6 carbon atoms. The term amino includes compounds or moieties in which a nitrogen atom is covalently bonded to at least one carbon or heteroatom. The term "dialkylamino" includes groups wherein the nitrogen atom is bound to at least two alkyl groups. The term "atylamino" and "diarylamino" include groups wherein the nitrogen is bound to at least one or two aryl groups, respectively.

According to the invention, a suitable cationic group may be a hydrogen atom. In certain cases, the cationic group may actually be another group on the therapeutic compound that is positively charged at physiological pH, for example an amino group. A "counter ion" is required to maintain electroneutrality, and is pharmaceutical^ acceptable in the compositions of the invention. Compounds containing a cationic group covalently bonded to an anionic group may be referred to as an "internal salt."<br>
Unless otherwise specified, the chemical moieties of the compounds of the invention, including those groups discussed above, may be "substituted or unsubstituted." In some<br><br>
embodiments, the term "substituted** means that the moiety has substituents placed on the moiety other than hydrogen (i.e., in most cases, replacing a hydrogen), which allow the molecule to perform its intended function. Examples of substituents include moieties selected from straight or branched alkyl (e.g;,C|-C5), cycloalkyl (e.g., C3«Cg), amino groups (including -NH2), -SO3H, -OSO3H, -CN, -N02, halogen (e.g., -F, -CI, -Br, or -I), -CH2OCH3, -OCH3, -SH, -SCH3, -OH, and -CO2H.<br>
It will be understood that "substitution" or "substituted with" includes the implicit proviso that such substitution is in accordance with permitted valence of the substituted atom and the substituent, and that the substitution results in a stable compound, e.g., which does not spontaneously undergo transformation such as by rearrangement, cyclization, elimination, etc. As used herein, the term "substituted" is meant to include all permissible substituents of organic compounds.

The structures of some of the compounds of this invention include stereogenic carbon atoms. It is to be understood that isomers arising from such asymmetry (e.g., all enantiomers and diastereomers) are included within the scope of this invention unless indicated otherwise. That is, unless otherwise stipulated, any chiral carbon center may be of either (R)- or (5)-stereochemistiy. Such isomers can be obtained in substantially pure form by classical separation techniques and by stereochemically-controlled synthesis. . Furthermore, alkenes can include either the E- or Z- geometry, where appropriate.

In another aspect, the invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a first agent, e.g.% an alkanesulfonic acid, and another drug that targets secondary symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, such as behavioral and emotional difficulties. For example, some approved medications exist that appear to improve memory and cognition, but do not address the underlying pathology, as discussed more fully elsewhere herein.<br>
Hie discussion below explains in more detail the various therapeutic approaches and classes of medications for Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Cognitive Enhancers - Cholinesterase Inhibitors<br>
Alzheimer's Disease is associated with degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the basal . forebrain that play a fundamental role in cognitive functions, including memory. Alzheimer's disease patients exhibit a marked reduction in acetylcholinesterase activity and choline uptake. Becker, et al, Drug Development Research 12,163-95 (1988). In one aspect, the present invention is related to increasing levels of acetylcholine by the administration of an inhibitor of choline esterase (e.g., acetylcholinesterase or butyrylcholinesterase). Cholinergic neurons make up a major neuronal system of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Cholinergic neurons produce the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. In the central nervous system, acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter and is released by cholinergic neurons in, among other places, the hippocampus and frontal cortex of the brain. Hie hippocampal area of the brain, particularly those areas where acetylcholine is released, is believed to have functions associated with cognition, learning, and memory. Degenerative diseases with symptoms such as loss of cognition, learning, and memory, have been linked to a loss in cholinergic neurons. Cholinergic dysfunction, characterized by marked degeneration of cholinergic innervation in the basal forebrain, and reduction of choline acetyltransferase, acetylcholinesterase, and the nicotinic and muscarinic receptors are known to be very early features of Alzheimer's disease. Other neurotransmitter systems, such as glutamatergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic, are also disrupted in Alzheimer's disease, but at a later stage of the disease.<br>
The present invention also relates to the combination use of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist or muscarinic agonist that results in cognition enhancement. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists improve cognitive function in Alzheimer's patients. Wilson, etal., Pharmacol Biochem. Behavior 51,509-14 (1995); Arneric, et al, Alzheimer Disease Assoc. Disorders 9(suppl. 2), 50-61 (1995); Buccafusco, et al, Behav* Pharmacol 10,681-90 (1999). Muscarinic and nicotinic agonists have been reported to enhance cognitive tasks in<br><br>
animal models and in humans. Schwarc, et al, J. Pharmacol Experim. Theraput. 291, 812-22 (1999); Veroff, et al, Alzheimer Disease Assoc. Disorders 12,304-12 (1998); Bodick, etal, Alzheimer Disease Assoc. Disorders 1 l(SuppI. 4), SI 6-22 (1997).<br>
In subjects with Alzheimer's disease, the number of cholinergic neurons innervating the hippocampus typically decreases, and the progressive loss of these cholinergic neurons mirrors the loss in memory and cognitive function in these subjects. Acetylcholine is synthesized by choline acetyltransferase ("ChAT"). Once released by the neuron, it is degraded by cholinesterases, e.g., acetylcholinesterase ("AChE"). Thus either potentiating the activity of ChAT or inhibiting the activity of a cholinesterase, e.g., AchE, may raise levels of the neurotransmitter. These medications alone appear to provide primarily symptomatic improvement.<br>
Another therapeutic strategy for increasing levels of acetylcholine is based on up-regulating ChAT in the neurons. For example, estrogen increases the level of acetylcholine by up-regulating ChAT in the hippocampus of rats. Luine, et al, Brain Res. 191,273-77 (1980); Luine, Exp. Neurology 89,484-90 (1985), Singh, et al, Brain Res. 644,305-12 (1994). Also clinical information implies that post-menopausal women on hormone replacement therapy (estrogen with or without progestins) may be less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease and more likely to have existing symptoms alleviated. See, e.g., WO 93/014085 (indole derivatives as having the ability to enhance the release of acetylcholine); U.S. Pat. No. 5,278,162 (substituted polycyclic compounds that enhance acetylcholine release).<br>
Many choline esterase inhibitors are known. Certain cholinesterase inhibitors are approved for use in treatments for improving memory and learning in Alzheimer's subjects. Tacrine (Cognex™, Warner-Lambert Co., now Pfizer, New York, New York) was the first approved cholinesterase inhibitor but is rarely used because of negative side effects like stomach and liver problems. Donepezil (Aricept™, Eisai Co, Ltd) is more selective for acetyl-cholinesterase and shows fewer side effects than tacrine. Rivastigmine (Exelon™, Novartis Pharma SA) targets a specific subtype of acetyl-cholinesterase that is present at high concentrations in the brains of Alzheimer's subjects. Galanthamine (Reminyl™, Janssen Pharmaceutica Products, LP) has a dual mode of action in the brain; in addition to working as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, galanthamine also appears to exert action on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain. These cholinesterase inhibitors may be acetyl-cholinesterase or butyryl-cholinesterase inhibitors or both. Another example is phenserine (currently in advanced clinical trials in the United States). In addition to its cholinergic effects, phenserine may inhibit p-APP production by a separate and distinct mechanism of action at the level of the mRNA level. Another example is AIT-082 (also in advanced clinical trials). The degradation pathway of AchE may also be inhibited by inhibitors such as physostigmine (Synapton™, or (Antilirium Injectable™, Forrest Laboratories, New York, New York)), quilostigmine, tolserine,<br><br>
thiatolserine, cymserine, thiacymserine, neostigmine, eseroline, zifrosilone, mestinon, huperzine A and icopezil.<br>
Phenserine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is in development (Axonyx, New York, New York) for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease. Phenserine, which has been shown to increase memory and learning in the laboratory animals, works through two mechanisms: it inhibits the degradation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brains of animals, and it inhibits the production of a toxic form of the p-amyloid protein in the brain that is thought to be a cause of the death of brain cells in Alzheimer's disease. Unlike other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that simply suppress the activity of the enzyme, Phenserine's dual mechanism of action suggests that it not only has the potential to improve memory and cognition but also to slow the progression of the disease. Compared to currently marketed drugs for Alzheimer's, Phenserine is more brain-targeted versus the rest of the body and is more rapidly cleared from the blood. In preclinical studies, Phenserine demonstrated a brain-to-blood ratio of 10:1. These properties of Phenserine could potentially maximize the therapeutic effects of the drug in the brain and reduce side effects by clearing the drug from the blood quickly. Since undesirable side effects and drug interactions often arise due to the presence of drugs in the body for an extended period, Phenserine's rapid disappearance from the blood suggests that it will represent a more tolerable treatment option to existing therapies. Even though Phenserine is rapidly cleared from the body, the drug remains bound to the acetylcholinesterase enzyme in the brain allowing it to have a long duration of therapeutic action. Substituted phenserines and phenylcarbamates of eseroline, noreseroline, and benzylnoreseroline are also specific inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase See, e.g., U.S. Pat.

In addition, the present invention relates to a method for maintaining or preventing a decrease in the levels of acetylcholine in the frontal cortex or hippocampus regions of the brain in mammals comprising administering to a mammal in need thereof, an effective amount of a first agent, e.g., an alkanesulfonic acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and optionally a choline esterase inhibitor.<br>
Further, the present invention relates to a method for inhibiting conditions or detrimental effects caused by a deficiency of choline acetyltransferase or acetylcholine in the frontal cortex or hippocampus regions of the brain in mammals comprising administering to a mammal in need<br><br>
thereof, an effective amount of a first agent, e.g., an alkanesulfonic acid, or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof, and optionally a choline esterase inhibitor.<br>
Moreover, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a first agent, e.g., an alkanesulfonic acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and optionally a choline esterase inhibitor; and a pharmaceutical carrier, diluent, or excipient.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is where the condition caused by a decrease of choline acetyltransferase or acetylcholine in the frontal cortex or hippocampus regions of the brain is Alzheimer's disease.<br>
As used herein, the term "effective amount" means an amount of a first agent, e.g., an alkanesulfonic acid, that is capable of maintaining brain cell ability to produce stable levels of acetylcholine in the brain, such as in the hippocampus and frontal cortex regions, or inhibiting conditions or detrimental effects caused by a decrease of acetylcholine in mammals. When an alkanesulfonic acid or other such first agent is co-administered with an AChE inhibitor the term "effective amount" also means an amount of such an agent capable of inhibiting AChE. An inhibitor of AChE may be represented as "AChEi"<br>
In this context, the term "inhibiting" in the context of inhibiting conditions or detrimental effects caused by a deficiency of ChAT or acetylcholine in the frontal cortex or hippocampus regions of the brain includes its generally accepted meaning, /.e., prohibiting, restraining, alleviating, ameliorating, slowing, stopping, or reversing the progression or severity of a decrease in ChAT and acetylcholine and the pathological sequelae, z.e., symptoms, resulting from that event.<br>
The term "up-regulating ChAT" refers to increasing the enzymatic activity of ChAT, le., promoting the conversion of choline to acetylcholine. This promotion would include an increase in the efficiency or rate of reaction of ChAT and choline or an increase in the amount of ChAT present at the site of action. This increase in the amount of enzyme present may be due to gene regulation or another synthetic step in the enzyme's formation or a decrease in the enzyme's de-activation and metabolism.<br>
It has been shown that Ap can inhibit the efflux of acetylcholine from neurons upon new stimulation, and in addition that exogenous Ap may inhibit high affinity choline uptake. Normally acetylcholine efflux levels (e.g. from hippocampus) are decreased in the presence of Ap in the brain. Ap may act in several different ways to exert these effects, such as acting at the choline transporter, modulating post synaptic events, or acting on neuronal acetyl cholinesterase . receptors (e.g., nAChr (<x7 it has been shown that antibodies capable of binding to ap can normalize acetylcholine efflux levels which are usually reduced in the presence a brain et cholignergic dysfunction app v717f transgenic mice is normalized following anti-ap antibody administration. see abstract from neuroscience meeting new></x7><br>
Orleans, Nov. 2003 program no. 133.9.). A first agent of the invention, e.g., an alkanesulfonic acid, may act similarly to normalize acetylcholine levels by binding to AfJ. The presence of an alkanesulfonic acid may thus prevent Ap from inhibiting the efflux of acetylcholine, thereby leading to an increase in the amount of acetylcholine at the synapse. It is likely therefore that an alkanesulfonic acid and an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor will act synergistically to ameliorate cholinergic neurotransmission, as both agents act to potentiate the levels of acetylcholine.<br>
Ester Neurosciences (Herzlia Pituach, Israel) antisense drug (EN101) for the treatment of myasthenia gravis, demonstrated for the first time effective and safe use of an orally-administered antisense therapy for a neurological condition that lessened the severity of symptoms of myasthenia gravis, with no cholinergic symptoms nor significant adverse events based on balancing cholinergic transmission via controlled modulation of the company's novel target, a stress-response variant of acetylcholinesterase. AChE is an enzyme that degrades the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. EN101 selectively inhibits the production of the target at the critical stage of its biosynthesis, thereby allowing an effective treatment, while minimizing side effects and substantially improving upon the short-duration palliative relief currently observed with conventional inhibitors. EN101 is the lead compound in Ester's disease-modifying platform technology for the pre-expression control of a specific variant of the AChE protein, which is applicable to a wide range of neurological disorders.<br>

In 1993, tacrine became the first agent approved specifically for the treatment of cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Tacrine is a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor and is thought to work by increasing the availability of intrasynaptic acetylcholine in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. The medication may also have other actions, Donepezil, another reversible cholinesterase inhibitor, is now available for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Another example of a second agent is xanomeline, which is a muscarinic selective ml and m4 (muscarinic) acetylcholine receptor agonist and shows moderate improvement in cognitive performance, greater efficacy in decreasing psychotic symptoms, and agitation.

Cognitive Enhancers - NMDA Receptor Antagonists<br>
Excessive excitation by neurotransmitters can cause the degeneration and death of neurons. It is believed that this degeneration is in part mediated by the excitotoxic actions of the excitatory amino acids glutamate and aspartate at the A^methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor. An increased level of one or more glutamate-related compounds is associated with many neurodegenerative disorders and neurodegeneration associated with long term disease states such as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, which is also known as motor neuron disease), Parkinson's disease and acquired immunodeficiency (AIDS). Excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists that block NMDA receptors are recognized for usefulness in the treatment of disorders. NMDA receptors are intimately involved in the phenomenon of excitotoxicity, which may be a critical determinant of outcome of several neurological disorders. Disorders known to be responsive to blockade of the NMDA receptor include acute cerebral ischemia (stroke or cerebral trauma, for example), muscular spasm, convulsive disorders, neuropathic pain and anxiety, and may be a significant causal factor in chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. Compounds that effect the greatest protection of neurons from NMDA receptor-mediated injury, e.g.9 that injury resulting from stimulation of the NMDA receptor by glutamate or other excitatory amino acids or structurally similar compounds may be used in one embodiment of the invention.<br>
Some examples of NMDA receptor antagonists are known and commercially available. Memantine (Ebixa™ or Axura™, recently available in the U.S. from Merz Pharmaceuticals, Frankfurt am Main, Germany), which operates by yet another mechanism, appears to prevent or reduce the brain damage caused by Alzheimer's disease by blocking NMDA receptors in the brain. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,614,560. Memantine (l-amino-3,5-dimethyl adamantine) reduces neuronal damage by blocking NMDA receptor-operated channel activation by excitatory amino acids (such as glutamate-related compounds) at concentrations that are readily obtainable in<br><br>
human subjects taking the drug (Wesemann, et a/., J. Neural Transmission (Supp.) 16,143 (1980)).<br>
Several drugs have NMDA antagonist activity without causing hypofunction because of activity at some other type of receptor. In the brains of healthy lab animals, such NMDA antagonists do not cause the vacuoles and other toxic side effects that are caused by NMDA antagonists such as PCP and MK-801, because of activity at die additional neuronal receptors. Such drugs, and the receptors they interact with in addition to NMDA receptors, include the following: Ibogaine, which also suppresses excitatory activity at sigma receptors and which may also be active at serotonin receptors, and Eliprodil, which also increases inhibitory activity at sigma receptors; Certain anti-cholinergic drugs such as procyclidine, trihexyphenydyl, and biperiden, which also suppress excitatory activity at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors; and Certain quinoxalinediones, including NBQX, ACEA 1021, and ACEA 1031, which are discussed below, and which suppress activity at non-NMDA receptors (i.c, kainic acid receptors and AMPA receptors), in addition to NMDA receptors. As described in Example 11, NBQX blocks non-NMDA receptors so strongly that it acts as a safener agent when co-administered with MK-801. Accordingly, these and other quinoxalinediones are of great interest to pharmaceutical companies, and offer strong promise as inherently safened NMDA antagonists. Low-toxicity NMDA antagonists offer good candidates both for treating Alzheimer's disease, and for additional developmental research to identify analogs having adjusted balances in their dual or multiple receptor binding affinities. For example, the anti-parkinsonian agents procyclidine, trihexyphenydyl, and biperiden all have affinities for muscarinic receptors that are several times higher than for NMDA receptors. Further examples of NMDA receptor antagonists include those in U.S. Pat No. 4,906,779, which discloses disubstituted guanidines, e.g., NJf -di-w-tolyl guanidine, JV^'-di-o-ethylphenyl guanidine, .tyW-di-m-ethylphenyl guanidine, and W,AT-di-o-iodophenyI-guanidine; U.S. Pat No. 5,498,610, which discloses 5-(l-hydroxy-2-piperidino)-propyl-2(liy,3i?)-indolone analogs. A muscarinic agonist may also be used in this invention, A class of styryl amidine derivatives, which are antagonists of the human NMDA receptor, are selective for those containing the NR2B subunit, and may, in some embodiments, be used in the invention. U.S. Published Application No. 2003/0,119,871. Suitable NMDA receptor antagonists also include ipenoxazone, which is available from Nippon Chemiphar Co. Ltd.<br>
The term "agonist," as used herein, refers to amolecule which, when interacting with a biologically active molecule, causes a change (e.g., enhancement) in the biologically active molecule, or which positively modulates the activity of the biologically active molecule. An agonist interacts with a receptor and initiates a physiological or a pharmacological response characteristic of that receptor. As known in the ait, agonists include, but are not limited to proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids or any other molecules which bind or interact with<br><br>
biologically active molecules. The terms "antagonist" or "inhibitor," as used herein, refer to a molecule which, when interacting with a biologically active molecule, blocks or negatively modulates the biological activity of the biologically active molecule. Antagonists oppose the receptor-associated responses normally induced by other bioactive agents {i.e., agonists). Antagonists and inhibitors include, but are not limited to, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids or any other molecules that bind or interact with biologically active molecules. Inhibitors and antagonists may effect the biology of entire cells, organs, or organisms (e.g., an inhibitor that slows or prevents neuronal degeneration and death).<br>
Estrogens<br>
Estrogen plays a powerful, pleiotropic role in many neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease. Women have been shown to have increased risk, earlier onset, and more rapid progression of Alzheimer's Disease than men, although not gender-specific morbidity. Postmenopausal loss of estrogens leads to generally reversible decreases in memoty that respond to estrogen replacement therapy. Besides mechanisms of blocking neurotoxicity directly, estrogen acts at various levels of plasticity: axon sprouting, synaptogenesis, and promoting synaptic transmission (electrophysiologically and biochemically). These effects may be ascribed to either receptor-dependent mechanisms, primarily transcriptional, including direct effects of ER in transcription and indirect effects through other transcription factors like CREB and Akt, as well as their retrograde transport or receptor-independent (rapid) mechanisms involving activational effects of second messenger systems, coexisting neurotransmission, or coordinated activation of both, as well as oxidative effects of the estrogen molecule. Estrogen replacement decreases the risk of Alzheimer's disease in postmenopausal women, delays the age of onset, and perhaps slows the decline. Estrogenic agent include estrogen, lasofoxifene, droloxifene, tamoxifen, and raloxifene (Evista™, Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, Indiana).<br>

flon-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Druzs<br>
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ("NSAIDs'*) appear to be associated with a lower likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease. Anti-inflammatory drugs are believed to interfere with aspects of the microglial, astrocytic, and cytokine responses that occur in Alzheimer's disease. NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, naproxen, sulindac, and indomethacin, have been shown to be selective A042-lowering agents. A subset of NSAIDs lower amyloidogenic A042 independently of cyclooxygenase activity. S.Weggen, et alt "A subset of NSAIDs lower amyloidogenic A|M2 independently of cyclooxygenase activity." Nature 414,212-16 (2001). Although the mechanisms by which these NSAIDs lower A{342 have not been established, the effect is independent of cyclooxygenase inhibition, which is the primary anti-inflammatory target of these compounds. NSAIDs do not appear to change the total level of Aβ produced but shift cleavage from A{342 to a less toxic shorter 38-amino acid Ajl peptide (A038), which suggests that they interact with y-secretase. One class of developmental compounds are inhibitors of PDE4, which act as anti-inflammatory drug in mice. These anti-inflamatoiy agent, e.g., rolipram, appear to block the microglial inflammatory response, and may have toxic side effects, but newer analogs without such properties are in development. Wilcock, et a/., "Intracranially Administered Anti-Abeta Antibodies Reduce Beta-Amyloid Deposition by Mechanisms Both Independent of and Associated with Microglial Activation. J. Neurosci. 23(9), 3745-51 (2003). For example, Memory Pharmaceutical's MEM 1414 is a PDE4 inhibitor currently in testing for Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Suitable anti-inflammatory agents include COX-2 inhibitors (such as Vioxx™ and Celebrex™), cytokine inhibitors (such as thalidomide disclosed in WO 95/04533 and dexanabinol) complement inhibitors, Ieukotriene receptor antagonists and combinations thereof. Examples include acetic acid aerivatives sulindac (Clinoril™, Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Rahway, New Jersey), indomethacin (Indocin™, Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Rahway, New Jersey); etodolac (Lodine™, Wyeth, Madison, New Jersey), nabumetone (Relafen™, GlaxoSmithKline, Middlesex, England), tolmetin sodium (Tolectin™, McNeil Pharmaceuticals, Spring House, Pennsylvania); anthranilic acid derivatives: meclofenamate sodium (Meclomen™, Pfizer, New York, New York), mefenamic acid (Ponstel™, Pfizer, New York, New Yoric); enolic acid derivatives: piroxicam (Feldene™, Pfizer, New York, New York), mobic (meloxicam); phenylacetic acid derivatives: arthrotec (diclofenac/misoprostol), Voltaren™ (diclofenac); propionic acid derivatives: naproxen sodium (Anaprox™, Naprosyn™, Hofimann-La Roche Inc. (Roche), Nutley, N J.)» flurbiprofen (Ansaid™, Upjohn, now Pfizer, New York, New York), oxaprozin (Daypro™, G.D Searle, now Pfizer, New York, New York); ibuprofen (Motrin™, Upjohn, now Pfizer, New York, New York), fenoprofen calcium (Nalfon™, Dista, Ranbaxy, Princeton, NJ),, ketoprofen (Oruvail™ or Orudis™, Wyeth, Madison, New Jersey), ketorolac tromethamine (Toradol™, Syntex Laboratories, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (Roche), Nutley, N.J.);<br><br>
salicylic acid derivative: diflunisal (Dolobid™, Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Rahway, New Jersey); and COX-2 selective inhibitors: Bextra™ (valdecoxib), Celebrex™ (celecoxib, Pfizer, New York, New Yoric), and Vioxx™ (rofecoxib, Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Rahway, New Jersey). Flurbiprofen is currently the subject of clinical trials with Alzheimer's patients by Myriad Genetics.<br>
Maas BiolAB (Albuquerque, New Mexico) is developing cyclosporin as an antiinflammatory neuroprotection agent. EP 813,420 Bl. Cyclosporins, a class of drugs best known as immunosuppressants, were discovered to have a new use as the most effective neuroprotectants across the spectrum of neurological disease models when they cross the blood-brain barrier. Cyclosporins protect the brain's mitochondria and prevent neuron death due to traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's diseases and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) animal models.<br>
Anti-Oxidants<br>
As a lipid rich organ, the CNS is particularly susceptible to effects of lipid peroxidation in modulating cellular signaling pathways, cell dysfunction, and cell death in the nervous system. In Alzheimer's disease, emerging evidence provides strong support for a role for oxidative stress in neurodegeneration, as multiple indices of oxidative stress have been observed, including protein oxidation, decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage.<br>
Free radicals (e.g., superoxide radicals) are used by phagocytes to kill bacteria and to oxidatively destroy foreign matter. Ordinarily excess superoxide is quenched by superoxide dismutase, however if oxidative stress causes the overproduction of radicals, or if the production of the superoxide exceeds the capacity of superoxide dismutase, then unintended oxidative damage may occur. B. Halliwell, Acta Neurol Scand. 126,23-33(1989). In Alzheimer's subjects, protein oxidation, DNA oxidation, and lipid peroxidation are greater than in age-matched controls. S.S. Pitchumoni, etal,N. Engl J. Med. 46(12), 1566-72 (1998).<br>
An "antioxidant" is any substance capable of protecting against the damages of oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species such as free radicals. Antioxidants are generally desined so that they may be oxidized over other materials. In addition to superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase react with hydrogen peroxide and convert it to water and diatomic oxygen. Other antioxidants include vitamin E (a-tocopherol), vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin A (retinoic acid), co-enzyme Q, and selegiline.<br>
Vitamin E, a-tocopherol, quenches a free radical by donating a hydrogen atom thereby producing a tocopheroxy radical, which scavenges yet another peroxyl radical to produce a-tocopherol quinone, a stable compound. Unlike many other antioxidants, vitamin E is<br><br>
lipophilic and therefore soluble in the central nervous system and able to localize in a cell membrane thus preventing lipid peroxidation. Glutamate and A{3 together have been shown to stimulate the production of free radicals in cultured neurons, but this process is retarded by the addition of catalase or a-tocopherol and agents that increase catalase activity. H. Hara, et al.y Brain Res. 510,335-38 (1990). Vitamin E has been shown to slow cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease and in rat models. Patients with Alzheimer's disease treated with vitamin E showed a decreased rate of functional decline. Although it is not clear what causal relation oxidation has to Alzheimer's disease etiology, e.g., whether it is a secondaiy effect of the stress caused by synaptic or neuronal loss, antioxidant therapies have shown limited but promising efficacy in treating Alzheimer's disease. Vitamin E lacks negative medication interaction and may be used in combination with other Alzheimer's disease therapies. CBehl, et al, "Vitamin E protects nerve cells from beta-amyloid protein toxicity." Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 186, 944-50 (1992); M.Sano, et alt "Rationale and design of a multicenter study of selegiline and a-tocopherol in the treatment of Alzheimer disease using novel clinical outcomes." Alzheimer Dis. Assoc. Disord. 10,132-40 (1996); H.Kappus, et al, "Tolerance and safety of vitamin E: a toxicological position report" Free Radic. Biol. Med. 13,55-74 (1992)).<br>
Selegiline inhibits monoamine oxidase, which may convert certain protoxins into toxins. L.S. Schneider, J. Clin. Psychiatry 57,30-36 (1996). Selegiline and other monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors may protect neurons from oxidative damage while not interfering with the action of type A inhibitors, which metabolize serotonin and norepinephrine. Selegiline also inhibits oxidative deamination of dopamine, which prevents the formation of free radicals and subsequent neuronal damage. M. Sano, et al., Alzheimer Dis. Assoc. Disord. 10,132-140 (1996). Selegiline, through its anti-oxidative and neuroprotective properties may slow progression of Alzheimer's disease. Selegiline effect on catecholamine metabolism may also contribute to die efficacy of selegiline in delaying the progression of Alzheimer's disease in patients with moderate impairment.<br>
Other antioxidants include free radical scavengers (Egb-761, yuyu Industrial, CPl-21, dexanabinol and iron chelators, which prevent iron from reacting to form hydroxyl radicals. Desferoxamine prevents radical damage in vivo, and clinical trial shows that it may slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Yet another example is HCT-1026 (NO-flurbiprofen), which-is a nitric oxide-donating derivative of flurbiprofen presently being developed in human clinical trials by NicOx SA (Sophia Antipolis, France). The chronic use of certain NSAIDS may result in gastrointestinal ulcers and impaired kidney function. Nitric oxide is believed to prevent or reverse such side-effects, thus making HCT-1026 particularly noteworthy.<br><br>
Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR) Agonists<br>
Also useful in the present invention are compositions or therapeutic combinations that further comprise at least one (one or more) activators for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ("PPAR")- The activators act as agonists for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Three subtypes of PPAR have been identified, and these are designated as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha ("PPARa"), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ("PPAR-y") and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta ("PPARS," which is also known as "PPARP" or "NUC1").<br>
Exposure of mammalian cells to PPAR agonists, particularly PPARa or PPAR5 agonists, modulates, e.g., decreases the production or release of Aβ, particularly Ap42, from the cells. See, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0125338, which describes administrations of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors for the treatment of amyloidosis and conditions and diseases associated therewidth. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARot, PPAR8, PPARP, and PPARy) are a subfamily of the nuclear receptor gene family, Desvergne, et aly Endocrine Rev. 20,649-88 (1999)). PPARs are usually activated by fatty acids and similar derivatives. PPAR8 has been identified as being useful in increasing high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in humans. See, e.g., WO 97/28149, which describes PPAR agonists that are useful for raising high density lipoprotein (HDL) plasma levels in mammals. PPARa activator compounds are useful for, among other things, lowering triglycerides, moderately lowering LDL levels and increasing HDL levels. Useful examples of PPARa activators include fibrates.<br>
In contrast to PPARa, the function of PPARS is not well understood. Although PPARS is ubiquitously expressed the brain, adipose tissue and skin have higher levels of relative mRNA expression (J.M. Peters, etal, Mol Cell Biol 20, 5119-28 (2000)). The expression profile of PPARS suggests that it may be involved in brain functions. G. Xing, et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 217,1015-25 (1995). Furthermore, PPARS may be implicated in reverse cholesterol transport, W,R. Oliver, et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Set USA 98,5306-11 (2001). Examples of PPARS agonists include valproic Acid (Lampen, et al, Tox. Appl Pharmacol 160, 238-49 (1999)), GW501516 (W.R. Oliver, etalyProc. Natl Acad Scl USA 98,5306-11 (2001)), L-165041, L-165461, L-783483, and L-796449 (Berger, et al, 1 Biol Chem. 274, 6718-25(1999)).<br>
Routine experimentation may be performed to determine if a composition affects the release of Ap from at least one cell in vivo. A suitable assay involves SM-4 cells, which are stably transfected with Swedish mutant amyloid Precursor Protein, and then treated with a PPARa or PPARS agonist, such as pirinixic acid, or derivative thereof. After treatment, the media is collected and assayed for AP40 or Ap42. A statistically significant decrease (p
 <br>
compound decreases Ap42 production or release by a statistically significant amount relative to control (absence of the compound or presence of vehicle) it is considered to be an AP42-modulating agent according to the invention.<br>
An exemplary PPAR agonist is pirinixic acid, which has been shown to induce a decrease in AP42 production or release from SM-4 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Pirinixic acid has been identified as a hypolipidemic agent, see, U.S. Pat No. 3,814,761, which characterized it and related compounds as anti-Iipidemic agents. Although it might be tempting to view the activity of pirinixic acid on A|342 production or release as being directly related to its hypolipidemic role, particularly in view of the clinical correlation between hypercholesterolemia and Alzheimer's disease. Wolozin, Proc. Nat'l Acad Set. USA 98, 5371-73 (2001)). Fibratesare known to act as cholesterol-lowering agents but they generally are not known to reduce A342 production or release. For example, it has been reported that when SM-4 cells were treated with clofibrate and the culture media was collected in order to assay Ap42 levels, clofibrate was found to increase A(342 extracellular levels at a concentration range of 50-500 jaM. Similar results were found with 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid ("ETYA**) at 20-50 joM concentrations. The fact that three PPARa agonists (all of which are cholesterol lowering agents) have disparate effects on AP42 production or release from SM-4 cells implies that some PPARa agonists affect Ap42 production or release via a mechanism that is not strictly concomitant with their role as cholesterol lowering agents. See, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0013699, which describes novel heterocycles designed to prevent, treat, or ameliorate symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease, regulating production or levels of amyloid-P peptides in the bloodstream or brain.<br>

Cholesterol-Lowerine Aeents<br>
Since one aspect of the present invention relates to treating Alzheimer's disease, regulating production of or levels of amyloid p (AP) peptides or regulating the amount of ApoE isoform 4 in the bloodstream or brain by treatment with a combination of active ingredients wherein the active ingredients may be administered separately, the invention also relates to combining separate pharmaceutical compositions in kit form. That is, the invention includes a kit wherein two separate units are combined: a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least a compound of any of the Formulae described herein and a separate pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor or lipid-lowering agent as described above. In one embodiment, the kit may include directions for the administration of the separate components. The kit form is particularly advantageous when the separate components must be administered in different dosage forms (e.g., oral and parenteral) or are administered at different dosage intervals.<br>
In another alternative embodiment, the compositions used in the methods of the present invention can further comprise one or more AcylCoA:Cholesterol Oacyltransferase ("ACAT") Inhibitors, which can reduce LDL and VLDL levels, coadministered with or in combination with the compound(s) of the Formulae herein discussed above. ACAT is an enzyme responsible for esterifying excess intracellular cholesterol and may reduce the synthesis of VLDL, which is a product of cholesterol esterificatkm, and overproduction of apo B-100-containing lipoproteins.<br>
Non-limiting examples of useful ACAT inhibitors include avasimibe ([[2,4,6-tris(l-methylethyl)phenyl]acetyl]sulfamic acid, 2,6-bis(l-methylethyl)phenyl ester, formerly known as CHOI 1), HL-004, lecimibide (DuP-128) and CL-277082<br>
(JVK2,4-difluorophenyl)-JV^[[4^^	See P. Chang<br>
et #/., "Current, New and Future Treatments in Dyslipidaemia and Atherosclerosis", Drugs 60(1), 55-93 (2000).<br>
There is a complex relationship between Alzheimer's disease, cholesterol homeostasis, and agents used for regulating cholesterol levels in the body. WO 00/28981 discloses the administration of an inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase) to reduce the risk of onset of Alzheimer's disease. The inhibitors used were lovastatin, pravastatin, or a combination thereof. However, a similar correlation was not seen with simvastatin. WO 00/31548 also discloses inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase, particularly statins. Interestingly, simvastatin is a suggested inhibitor, contrasting with the results disclosed in WO 00/28981, which states that the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in simvastatin-treated subjects was not decreased.<br>
More than half of the total body cholesterol in humans is derived from intrinsic biosynthesis. HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methyIglutaryI-coenzyme A ) reductase is the enzyme<br><br>
catalyzing the early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis, i.e., conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. These complexes may be separated by density ultracentrifugation into high (HDL), intermediate (IDL), low (LDL), and very low (VLDL) density lipoprotein fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol synthesized in the liver are incorporated into VLDLs and released into the plasma for delivery to pheripheral tissues. In a series of subsequent steps, VLDLs are transformed into IDLs and cholesterol-rich LDLs. HDLs, containing apolipoprotein A, are hypothesized to participate in the reverse transport of cholesterol from tissues back to the liver. Elevated levels of total cholesterol, i.e., hypercholesterolemia, low LDL-choIesterol (LDL-C), and apolipoprotein B (a membrane transport protein for LDL) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and its transport complex, apolipoprotein A are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of total cholesterol and LDL-C, and inversely with the level of HDL-C. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been shown to reduce total serum cholesterol levels, LDL-C, and apolipoprotein B, most likely by increasing the catabolism of LDL and hepatic extraction of LDL precursors, blocking enzymatic cholesterol synthesis, and simultaneously increasing HD levels.. These lipid lowering drugs lower serum cholesterol levels and reduce the incidence of both cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,831,115; 5,807,834; 5,801,143; 5,798,375; and 5,786,485. Statins, well known for the treatment of prevention of coronary heart disease, block a rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol by HMG-CoA reductase. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,465,516.<br>
While Alzheimer's disease is typically characterized pathologically by the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles found at autopsy in the brains of subjects afflicted with the disease, vascular components of the disease have also been noted. These include lesions in the cerebral microcirculation and vascular deposits of Ap protein, which is also a major constituent of the senile plaques found in Alzheimer's disease.<br>
In addition to a relationship with coronary disease, it is known that there is a relationship between serum cholesterol levels and the incidence and the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Epidemiological studies show that subjects with elevated cholesterol have an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. (Notkola et a/., "Serum total cholesterol, apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele, and Alzheimer's disease," Neuroepidemiology; 17(1): 14-20 (1998); Jarvik et al.9 "Interactions of apolipoprotein E genotype, total cholesterol level, age and sex in prediction of Alzheimer's disease: a case-control study," Neurology 45(6):1092-6 (1995).) Other studies have established that subjects possessing the apolipoprotein e4 genotype ("apoE4") that codes for a variant of apolipoprotein, a cholesterol transport protein, have an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease, as well as for elevated levels of cholesterol and for heart disease. R.Mahley, "Cholesterol transport protein with expanding role in cell biology," Science 240, 622-30 (1988);<br><br>
Saunders, et al, "Association of apolipoprotein E allele e4 with late-onset familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease," Neurology AX 1467-72 (1993); Corder, et al, "Gene dose of apolipoprotein E type 4 allele and the risk of Alzheimer's disease in late-onset families," Science 261:921-923 (1993); Jarvik, et al, "Coronary artery disease, hypertension, ApoE and cholesterol: a link to Alzheimer's disease?" Ann. NY. Acad Set 826:128-146 (1997). Both apoE4 and a second putative risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, a-2-macroglobulin, bind to a receptor, the lipoprotein receptor related protein, which is important for cellular uptake of cholesterol, (Narita et al, "Alpha2-macroglobulin complexes with and mediates the endocytosis of beta-amyloid peptide vfa cell surface low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein," J. Neurochem. 69(5):1904-11 (1997); and Blacker era/., "Alpha-2 macroglobulin is genetically associated with Alzheimer's disease," Nature Genetics 19:357-60 (1998).) Other studies have shown that cholesterol increases the production of Aβ protein, which accumulates in the brains of subjects with Alzheimer's disease and is thought by many researchers to cause the neurodegeneration underlying the disease. D J.Selkoe, "Cell biology of the beta-amyloid precursor protein arid the genetics of Alzheimer's disease," Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology, 61, 587-96 (1996); and Simons, et al., "Cholesterol depletion inhibits the generation of P-amyloid in hippocampal neurons," Proc. Nat'l Acad. ScL USA, 95,6460-04 (1998).<br>
The apolipoprotein E isoform 4 (ApoE isoform 4) is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. PCT Patent Application No. WO 95/06470 discloses administration of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) to regulate levels of (ApoE isoform 4) in humans to prevent and treat Alzheimer's Disease. A normal cellular function of ApoE is uptake and delivery of lipids. The ApoE isoform correlates with an increased risk for atherosclerosis, increased amyloid plaque deposition and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. K.Fassbender, et al, "Simvastatin Strongly Reduces Levels of Alzheimer's Disease jJ-amyloid peptides AP42 and AP40 in vitro and in v/vo", Proa Nat'l Acad. ScL USA 98: 5856-5861 (2001). PCT Patent Application WO 00/28981 discloses at page 3 that patients possessing the ApoE isoform 4 have an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease, as well as elevated levels of cholesterol and increased risk for heart disease.<br>
Levels of cholesterol in the brain are critical for synapse formation and maintenance and recent studies identify cholesterol as a limiting factor in synaptogenesis. Reduced cholesterol may place a limit on plastic processes thus reducing the tendency to develop Alzheimer's disease. An issue for very long axons is the ability to supply sufficient cholesterol for rapid axonal growth, especially in regeneration. Alzheimer's disease brain contains less cholesterol, and this contributes to Alzheimer's disease-related alterations in membrane composition, membrane fluidity, and lipid bilayer structure and dynamics. Statins, as inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis, may reduce the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. Long term potentiation is inhibited<br><br>
by cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors and long term potentiation induction is associated with pathway-specific increases in lipid production. For example, axonal growth ceases when cholesterol synthesis is inhibited by pravastatin and could be reactivated by addition of<br>
cholesterol to either cell bodies or distal axons.<br>
The term, "HMO CoA reductase inhibitor," refers to any compound which inhibits the bioconversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methyIgIutaryI coenzyme A to mevalonic acid catalyzed by the enzyme HMG CoA reductase.

In addition to their direct effects on Hpid/cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism, statins in combination with substrates of nitric oxide synthase are known to facilitate transport of drugs across the blood brain barrier ("BBB"). Inasmuch as Alzheimer's disease is a disease of the brain, an especially useful pharmaceutical composition is a combination of a statin second agent and a nitric oxide synthase substrate second agent (e.g., L-Arg) as well as a first agent as described herein. A family of enzymes called Nitric Oxide Synthase ("NOS") form nitric oxide from L-arginine, and the nitric oxide produced is responsible for the endothelium dependent relaxation and activation of soluble guanylate cyclase, neurotransmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems, and activated macrophage cytotoxicity. Nitric Oxide Synthase, occurs in many distinct isoforms which include a constitutive form (cNOS) and an inducible form (iNOS). The constitutive form is present in normal endothelial cells, neurons and some other tissues. Formation of nitric oxide by the constitutive form in endothelial cells is thought to play an important role in normal blood pressure regulation, prevention of endothelial dysfunction such as hyperiipodemia, arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and restenosis. The inducible form of nitric oxide synthase has been found to be present in activated macrophages and is induced in vascular smooth muscle cells, for example, by various cytokines or microbial products. The conversion of precursor substrates such as L-arginine into nitric oxide is enzymatically catalyzed by NOS and the resulting by-product of the conversion of L-arginine is L-citruIIine. L-arginine as used herein includes all biochemical equivalents (Le. salts, precursors, and its basic form).<br>

Simvastatin has been used to reduce levels off-amyloid peptides A042 and AP40 in vitro and/www, for example, in guinea pigs. Wolozin, B.etal^Arch Neurol 57:1439-1443,2000, describe the analysis of a subject population treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The authors reported that the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease was 60-73% lower in these subjects than in subjects taking other medications. In this study, a causal relationship could not be established. Jick, H. etal, The Lancet 356:1627-1631,2000, also reviewed subject records and found that in individuals 50 years and older, statin administration was associated with a substantially lowered risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and other conditions. Similarly, Acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitors have been used to decrease plasma cholesterol in various animal models including rats, guinea pigs and rabbits (Tanaka etal,£ Med Chem. 41:2390-2410,1998; }\mq\)&amp;oetaL,Biochem.

Arnvloid Inhibitors (Anti-Amvloid Therapeutic Approaches)<br>
Other important targets for therapeutic intervention are the mechanisms which convert APP into Ap. In particular, down-regulation of the p and gamma-secretases and up-rcgulation of alpha-secretase (which cleaves within the Ap peptide) would inhibit the production of Ap peptide, p-secretase or BACE has been identified by several groups and is an aspartyl protease en2yme. However the molecular identity of the gamma-site APP processing enzyme, gamma-secretase, still remains to be determined. It is clear that presenilins are required for y-secretase cleavage of APP. Ap secretion is almost completely blocked in neurons lacking presenilin 1. There are a number of possibilities for the function of presenilins: (1) They could be required for<br><br>
intracellular trafficking and sorting of APP to the y-secretase compartment, or (2) They could serve as a co-factor for y-secretase cleavage. (C, Haass, et aLt Science 286,916-19 (1999); MS Wolfe, et alt Biochemistry 38,4720-27 (1999); T. Bayer, et aU Brain Pathology 11,1-11 (2001); B. De Strooper, et ah, Nature 391,387-91 (1998)). See also, WO 2003/103652 and<br>
WO 2003/103653.<br>
y-Secretase cleaves at the C-terminus of A3 and is primarily responsible for generating the pathogenic 42-amino acid form of Ap, Ap42, which forms insoluble toxic fibrils and accumulates in senile plaques. M Hutton, et a/., Essays Biochem. 33,117-31 (1998); R.L. Nussbaum and C.E. Ellis, N Engl J, Med 348(14), 1356-64 (2003); T. Iwatsubo, et al, Neuron 13,45-53 (1994), W.P. Esler and M.S. Wolfe, Science 293,1449-54 (2001). Although the normal function of APP is unknown, it is predominantly expressed in the brain and is suspected of participating in cell adhesion, synaptic growth, and neural repair.<br>
Amyloid-p forms a continuum of aggregation species: monomeric amyloid-p, soluble oiigomeric amyloid-p, insoluble protofibrils, aroyloid-p, diffuse amyloid, compact amyloid, and neuritic or senile amyloid, the latter two being the pathologic and diagnostic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Independent of fibril or plaque formation, however, amyloid-p may alter membrane potential and firing, synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and learning. Amyloid-P, especially amyloid-P 1-42, has been shown to be neurotoxic. Accordingly, amyloid-p itself represents a significant drug target Recent evidence suggests that plaques per se are less toxic than oligomers or protofibrils. These oiigomeric forms of Ap could be responsible for the first stage of the disease when neuronal cell death is initiated.

Dense microspheres or spherons may be turned into plaques when they are burst in vitro or when injected into experimental animals. P. Averback, J. Alzheimer *s Disease 1,1-34 (1998). The compound NX-D2858 (Nymox Pharmaceutical Corp., Dorval, Quebec, Canada) blocks the transformation of spherons into senile plaques and may stop or slow the progress of Alzheimer's<br><br>
disease. U.S. published application no. 2003-0083298. Another compound that may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is Ateroid™ (Hunter-Fleming,) and related mucopolysaccharides, such as glycosaminoglycans having an average molecular weight equal to 2,400 Da, which have been described as suitable for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. EP 1,181,024<br>
Another compound is indole-3-propionic acid (Oxygon™, Mindset), which is described as preventing the cytotoxic effects of amyloid beta protein on cells, as well as blocking amyloid deposition and therefore useful in treating a fibrillogenic disease, such as Alzheimer's disease. U.S. Pat. No. 6,395,768 BL Suitable amyloid aggregation inhibitors also include reumacon available from Conpharm AB.<br>

Amyloid-Formation Inhibitors<br>
The present invention pertains to a method for treating or preventing a disease state associated with amyloidosis, the method comprising administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of an agent for reducing the concentration of fibrillar or soluble Aβ, such that said disease state associated with amyloidosis is treated or prevented.<br>
In an embodiment, the methods of the invention are based, at least in part, on inhibiting an interaction between an amyloidogenic protein and a constituent of basement membrane to inhibit amyloid deposition. The constituent of basement membrane is a glycoprotein or proteoglycan, e.g., heparan sulfate proteoglycan. A therapeutic agent used in the method of the invention may interfere with binding of a basement membrane constituent to a target binding site on an amyloidogenic protein, thereby inhibiting amyloid deposition. In some aspects, the methods of the invention involve administering to a subject a therapeutic agent which inhibits amyloid deposition. "Inhibition of amyloid deposition" is intended to encompass prevention of amyloid formation, inhibition of further amyloid deposition in a subject with ongoing amyloidosis and reduction of amyloid deposits in a subject with ongoing amyloidosis. Inhibition of amyloid deposition is determined relative to an untreated subject or relative to the treated subject prior to treatment Amyloid deposition is inhibited by inhibiting an interaction between an amyloidogenic protein and a constituent of basement membrane. "Basement membrane" refers to an extracellular matrix comprising glycoproteins and proteoglycans, including laminin,<br><br>
collagen type IV, fibronectin and heparan sulfate proteoglycan ("HSPG"). In one embodiment, amyloid deposition is inhibited by interfering with an interaction between an amyloidogenic protein and a sulfated glycosaminoglycan such as HSPG, Sulfated glycosaminoglycans are known to be present in all types of amyloids {see Snow, et al Lab. Invest. 56,120-23 (1987)) and amyloid deposition and HSPG deposition occur coincidental ly in animal models of amyloidosis (see Snow, etal. Lab. Invest. 56,665-75 (1987)).<br>
The ability of a therapeutic compound of the invention to inhibit an interaction between an amyloidogenic protein and a glycoprotein or proteoglycan constituent of a basement membrane may be assessed by an in vitro binding assay, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,164,295. Alternatively, the ability of a compound to bind to an amyloidogenic protein or to inhibit the binding of a basement membrane constituent (e.g., HSPG) to an amyloidogenic protein (e.g., Aβ) may be measured using a mass spectrometry assay where soluble protein, e.g., A3, is incubated with the compound. A compound that binds to, e.g., Aβ, will induce a change in the mass spectrum of the protein.<br>
For example, a therapeutic agent of the invention may interact with a binding site for a basement membrane glycoprotein or proteoglycan in an amyloidogenic protein and thereby inhibits the binding of the amyloidogenic protein to the basement membrane constituent. Basement membrane glycoproteins and proteoglycans include laminin, collagen type IV, fibronectin and HSPG. In an embodiment, the therapeutic agent inhibits an interaction between an amyloidogenic protein and HSPG. Consensus binding site motifs for HSPG in amyloidogenic proteins have been described ($ee, e.g., Cardin and Weintraub, Arteriosclerosis 9, 21-32 (1989)).<br>
Metal Chelators<br>
Zn2+ mediates neurodegenerative processes observed in seizure, ischemia, trauma, and Alzheimers disease. Zn2+ is observed in the extracellular plaque and degenerating neurons in Alzheimer's disease, which may contribute to neuronal degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. Oxidative damage in the neocortex associated with Alzheimer's disease may be the result of gradual build up of metal ions like zinc and copper. Copper and zinc have particularly high concentrations in the P-amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's subjects. Both metals are essential, but normally only small amounts are required and excess metals are excreted. It is hypothesized that p-amyloid converts dissolved oxygen to hydrogen peroxide, which in turn causes cell damage. Metal chelators may be used to diminish the oxidative burden. In APP transgenic mice treated with clioquinol (an antibiotic and bioavailable Cu/Zn chelator), marked reduction in Ap deposition occurred after several months of treatment Zinc and other divalent cations appear necessary for Ap aggregation. Thus, metal chelation may have some therapeutic benefit in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, either by preventing Ap aggregation or by<br><br>
disrupting preformed aggregates. In the laboratory, the copper-zinc chelator clioquinol may dissolve amyloid-beta deposits in postmortem brain tissue from Alzheimer's disease subjects. In APP transgenic mice treated with clioquinol (an antibiotic and bioavailable Cu/Zn chelator), marked reduction in Ap deposition occurred after several months of treatment A new study extends these results to mice genetically prone to overproduce amyloid-p. Clioquinol cut amyloid deposits in half over a nine week period with no adverse effects. The mice treated with clioquinol also exhibited significantly improved scores on a behavioral rating scale. The affinity of clioquinol for Zn is in the nanomolar range, whereas the affinity of Ap for Zn2+ is in the low micro molar range. Clioquinol had been approved by the FDA as an antibiotic, but was removed from the market about 30 years ago because of side effects involving the loss of Vitamin B-12. The antibiotic clioquinol, also known as 5-chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoIine or iodochlorhydroxyquin, a known copper/zinc chelator is a reasonably well tolerated drug in humans and is currently in a phase II clinical trial for Alzheimer's disease. T.E. Golde, /. Clin. Invest. 111,11-18 (2003). Clioquinol chelates copper and zinc in vitro, and reduces Ap deposition in a mouse model. Moreover, interim results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 32 subjects with Alzheimer's disease suggested that this drug slowsthe rate of cognitive decline in the most severely affected group.<br>
Suitable copper/zinc chelators include clioquinol available from PN Gerolymatos SA. Preliminary positive results have been generated by a human clinical trial in which clioquinol, supplemented with B-12, appears to be helpful in humans with Alzheimer's. Bush, el al&gt; Proc. Nat'l Acad Set USA 99,7317-19 (1999), U.S. Publshed Patent Application No. 2002/0,025,944.

Phanquinone (4,7-phenanthroline-5,6-dione) has hitherto been used for the treatment of various disorders, such as amoebiasis. However, its use for the treatment or prevention of memory improvement has been suggested. Phanquinone has been marketed by Ciba-Geigy as Entobex™, Phanquinone is also a metal chelator in the same family as clioquinol. According to the present invention the use of phanquinone for the manufacture of a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment or prevention of memory impairment is provided.<br>
Behavioral Management of Alzheimer's disease<br>
Patients with Alzheimer's disease may also be treated for behavioral disturbances associated with progression of the disease. Use of such treatments is intended to decrease psychotic symptoms such as paranoia, delusions and hallucinations, and associated or<br><br>
independent agitation, screaming, combativeness or violence, and thereby increase the comfort and safety of patients. Antipsychotics and antidepressants can be used intermittently in patients with defined psychotic symptoms.<br>
Benzodiazepines may be used briefly and judiciously for emergency sedation but otherwise should be avoided because they can produce delirium and tend to further compromise residual cognitive capacities. Lithium (Eskalith), centrally active p-adrenergic blockers, carbamazepine (Tegretol™, Ciba-Geigy Pharmaceuticals, now Novartis, Basel, Switzerland), and valproate (Depakene) have been used empirically in the treatment of affective lability and aggressive outbursts, Resperidone can also be used for psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease. Olanzabine, sertindole, and quetiapine can also be used. Still other examples include trazodone; p blockers, propranolol, metoprolol and pindotol (especially for some agitated patients with dementia). When male patients display intrusive disinhibited sexual behavior, a particular problem in patients with frontal lobe dementias, medroxyprogesterone and related hormonal agents may be employed. Glycosaminoglycan polysulfate (Ateroid™) can also improve depressive symptomatology in old-age dementia. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol Biol. Psychiatry 13, 977-81 (1989).<br>
Treatment of apathy is also considered. Dopaminergic agents, such as psychostimulant CD-amphelamine, methylphemidate), amantadine (Symmetrel™, Du Pont Multi-Source Products, Wilmington, DE), bromocriptine and b'uproprion are helpful in the treatment of severe apathy. A.E.Wallace, etal, "Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of methylphenidate in older, depressed, medically ill patients? Am. J. Psychiatry 152, 929-31 (1995).<br>
SSRIs are often chosen as the initial treatment because of their better side effect profiles, Once-a-day dosing may be appropriate. Examples of SSRIs include fluoxetine (Prozac™, Pulvules, Dista, Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, Indiana), paroxetine, sertraline, bupropion, and venlagaxin. Among the tricyclic and heterocyclic agents, theoretical reasoning and clinical experience suggest avoiding agents with prominent anticholinergic activity (e.g., amitriptyline, imipramine). Among the remaining agents, sample dosing strategies are given here for nortriptyline. MAOIs are also considered for individuals unresponsive to or unable to take other agents (tranylcypromine and phenelzine are examples)<br>
When sleep disturbances occur without other psychiatric symptoms beyond the dementia itself, some clinicians prescribe trazodone or Zolpidem. Benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam or oxazepam) and chloral hydrate may be used. Triazolam in particular is not recommended for individuals with dementia because of its association with amnesia. Diphenhydramine, which is found in most over-the-counter sleep preparations, is used by some clinicians, but its anticholinergic properties make it suboptimal for die treatment of demented patients.<br><br>
Some individuals with dementia show disinhibited behavior, including making inappropriate jokes, neglecting persona! hygiene, exhibiting undue familiarity with strangers, or disregarding conventional rules of social conduct. Occasionally, they may harm others by striking out. Suicidal behavior may occur, especially in mildly impaired individuals, who are more likely to have .insight into their deficits and to be capable of formulating (and carrying out) a plan of action. Anxiety is fairly common, and some patients manifest "catastrophic reactions,M overwhelming emotional responses to relatively minor stressors, such as changes in routine or environment. Depressed mood, with or without neurovegetative changes, is quite common, as are sleep disturbances independent of depression. Delusions can occur, especially those involving themes of persecution (e.g., the belief that misplaced possessions have been stolen). Misidentifications of familiar people as unfamiliar (or vice versa) frequently occur. Hallucinations can occur in all sensory modalities, but visual hallucinations are most common. Some patients exhibit a peak period of agitation (or other behavioral disturbances) during the evening hours, which is sometimes referred to as "sundowning."<br>
Delirium is frequently superimposed on dementia because the underlying brain disease increases susceptibility to the effects of medications or concurrent general medical conditions. Individuals with dementia may also be especially vulnerable to psychosocial stressors (e.g., going to the hospital, bereavement), which may exacerbate their intellectual deficits and associated problems.<br>
Dementia is sometimes accompanied by motor disturbances, which may include gait difficulties, slurred speech, and a variety of abnormal movements. Other neurological symptoms, such as myoclonus and seizures, may also occur.<br>
When male patients display intrusive disinhibited sexual behavior, a particular problem in patients with frontal lobe dementias, medroxyprogesterone and related hormonal agents are sometimes recommended (HLKyomen, et al, "The use of estrogen to decrease aggressive physical behavior in elderly men with dementia*" J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 39,1110-12 (1991); S.S.Rich, et aL, "Leuprolide acetate for exhibitionism in Huntington's disease." Mov. Disord. 9, 353-57 (1994); P.G.Weiler, et aL&gt; "Propranolol for the control of disruptive behavior in senile dementia." /. Geriatr. Psychiatry Neurol 1,226-30 (1988)), but only case series support this recommendation at present.<br>
Glycosaminoglycan polysulfate (e.g., Ateroid™) in old-age dementias; effects upon depressive symptomatology in geriatric patients. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacoi Biol Psychiatry 13,977-81 (1989)) The literature concerning the treatment of apathy is much sparser. There is minimal evidence that dopaminergic agents, such as psychostimulants (d-amphetamine, methylphenidate), amantadine, bromocriptine, and bupropion, are helpful in the treatment of severe apathy, but promising case reports suggest that efficacy studies are warranted (AJ3. Wallace, et al9 "Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of methylphenidate in older,<br><br>
depressed, medically ill patients." Am. J. Psychiatry 152, 929-31 (1995)). Psychostimulants have also received some support for the treatment of depression in elderly individuals with severe general medical disorders (RPickett, et al, "Psychostimulant treatment of geriatric depressive disorders secondary to medical illness." J. Geriatr. Psychiatry Neurol 3,146-51 (1990); L.W.Lazarus, et al9 "Methylphenidate and nortriptyline in the treatment of poststroke depression: a retrospective comparison?Arch Phys. Med Rehabil 75,403-06 (1994); T.R.Price, et al, "Safety and efficacy of ECT in depressed patients with dementia: a review of clinical experience." Convulsive Ther. 5,1-74(1989)).<br>
SSRIs are often chosen as the initial treatment because of their better side effect profiles. Once-a-day dosing is appropriate- Fluoxetine,. Paroxetine,. Sertraline, bupropion and venlagaxin are examples of SSRIs treatment. Among the tricyclic and heterocyclic agents, theoretical reasoning and clinical experience suggest avoiding agents with prominent anticholinergic activity (e.g., amitriptyline, imipramine). Among the remaining agents, sample dosing strategies are given here for nortriptyline<br>
Among the tricyclic and heterocyclic agents, theoretical reasoning and clinical experience suggest avoiding agents with prominent anticholinergic activity (e.g., amitriptyline, imipramine). Among the remaining agents, sample dosing strategies are given here for nortriptyline, desipramine, and trazodone.<br>
Depression is common in patients with dementia. Patients with depression should be carefully evaluated for suicide potential. Depressed mood may respond to improvements in the living situation or stimulation-oriented treatments, but patients with severe or persistent depressed mood with or without a foil complement of neurovegetative signs should be treated with antidepressant medications. Although formal evaluation of the efficacy of antidepressants for demented patients is limited, there is considerable clinical evidence supporting their use. The choice among agents is based on the side effect profile and the characteristics of a given patient. MAOIs are also considered for individuals unresponsive to or unable to take other agents (tranylcypromine and phenelzine are examples).<br>
Treatment of sleep disturbance in dementia is aimed at decreasing the frequency and severity of insomnia, interrupted sleep, and nocturnal confusion in patients with dementia. The goals are to increase patient comfort and to decrease the disruption to families and caregivers. Sleep disorder is common in dementia (Satlin A: Sleep disorders in dementia. Psychiatr. Ann. 24,186-90 (1994); C.CHoch, et aU "Sleep patterns in Alzheimer, depressed, and healthy elderly." West J. Nurs. Res. 10,239-56 (1988)) and is not always so disruptive that the risk of medication side effects is outweighed by the need for a pharmacologic trial. When sleep disturbances occur without other psychiatric symptoms beyond the dementia itself, some clinicians prescribe trazodone or Zolpidem. Benzodiazepines (£.&amp;, lorazepam or oxazepam) and chloral hydrate may in some cases be used. Triazolam in particular is not recommended for<br><br>
individuals with dementia because of its association with amnesia. Diphenhydramine, which is found in most over-the-counter sleep preparations, is used by some clinicians,,but its anticholinergic properties make it suboptimal for the treatment of demented patients.<br>

Blood-Brain Barrier<br>
Nitric oxide is a vasodilator of the peripheral vasculature in normal tissue of the body. Increasing generation of nitric oxide by nitric oxide synthase causes vasodilation without loss of blood pressure. The blood-pressure-independent increase in blood flow through brain tissue increases cerebral bioavailability of blood-bom compositions. This increase in nitric oxide may be stimulated by administering L-arginine. As nitric oxide is increased, cerebral blood flow is consequently increased, and drugs in the blood stream are carried along with the increased flow into brain tissue. Therefore, L-arginine may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention to enhance delivery of agents to brain tissue after introducing a pharmaceutical composition into the blood stream of the subject substantially contemporaneously with a blood ' flow enhancing amount of L-arginine. WO 00/56328<br>
Agents of the invention that exert their physiological effect in vivo in the brain may be more useful if they gain access to target cells in the brain. Non-limiting examples of brain cells are neurons, glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia), cerebrovascular cells (muscle cells, endothelial cells), and cells that comprise the meninges. The blood brain barrier ("BBB") typically restricts access to brain cells by acting as a physical and functional blockade that separates the brain parenchyma from the systemic circulation (see, e.g., Pardridge, et at.t J. Neurovirol. 5(6), 556-69 (1999); Rubin, et al9 Rev, Neurosci. 22,11-28 (1999)). Circulating molecules are normally able to gain access to brain cells via one of two processes: lipid-mediated transport through the BBB by free diffusion, or active: (or catalyzed) transport.<br><br>
The agents of the invention may be formulated to improve distribution in vivo, for example as powdered or liquid tablet or solution for oral administration or as a nasal spray, nose drops, a gel or ointment, through a tube or catheter, by syringe, by packtail, by pledget, or by submucosal infusion. For example, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) excludes many highly hydrophilic agents. To ensure that the more hydrophilic therapeutic agents of the invention cross the BBB, they may be formulated, for example, in liposomes. For methods of manufacturing liposomes, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,522,811; 5,374,548; and 5,399,331. The liposomes may comprise one or more moieties which are selectively transported into specific cells or organs ("targeting moieties" or "targeting groups" or "transporting vectors"), thus providing targeted drug delivery (see, e,g9 V.V. Ranade J. Clin Pharmacol 29,685 (1989)). Likewise, the agents may be linked to targeting groups that facilitate penetration of the blood brain barrier. In one embodiment, the method of the present invention employs a naturally occurring polyamine linked to an agent that is a small molecule and is useful for inhibiting Ap deposition.<br>
To facilitate transport of agents of the invention across the BBB, they may be coupled to a BBB transport vector (for review of BBB transport vectors and mechanisms, see, Bickel, ei al, Adv. Drug Delivery Reviews 46,247-79 (2001)). Exemplary transport vectors include cationized albumin or the OX26 monoclonal antibody to the transferrin receptor; these proteins undergo absorptive-mediated and receptor-mediated transcytosis through the BBB, respectively. Natural cell metabolites that may be used as targeting groups, include, inter alia, putrescine, spermidine, spermine, or DHA. Other exemplary targeting moieties include folate or biotin (see, e.g., U.S. Pat No. 5,416,016); mannosides (Umezawa, et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commtm. 153,1038 (1988)); antibodies (P.G. Bloeman, et al, FEBSLett. 357,140 (1995); M. Owais, et al, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 39,180 (1995)); surfactant protein A receptor (Briscoe, et al., Am. J. Physiol 1233,134 (1995)); gpl20 (Schreier, et al, J. Biol Chem. 269, 9090 (1994)); see also, K. Keinanen and ML. Laukkanen, FEBSLett 346,123 (1994); JJ. Killion and I.J. Fidler, Immunomethods 4,273 (1994).<br>
Examples of other BBB transport vectors that target receptor-mediated transport systems into the brain include factors such as insulin, insulin-like growth factors ("IGF-I," and "IGF-IT), angiotensin II, atrial and brain natriuretic peptide ("ANP " and "BNP"), interleukin I f^JLAT) and transferrin. Monoclonal antibodies to the receptors that bind these factors may also be used as BBB transport vectors. BBB transport vectors targeting mechanisms for absorptive-mediated transcytosis include cationic moieties such as cationized LDL, albumin or horseradish peroxidase coupled with polylysine, cationized albumin or cationized immunoglobulins. Small basic oligopeptides such as the dynorphin analogue E-2078 and the ACTH analogue ebiratide may also cross the brain via absorptive-mediated transcytosis and are potential transport vectors.<br>
Other BBB transport vectors target systems for transporting nutrients into the brain. Examples of such BBB transport vectors include hexose moieties, eg., glucose and<br><br>
monocarboxylic acids, e.g., lactic acid and neutral amino acids, e.g., phenylalanine and amines, e.g., choline and basic amino acids, e.g., arginine, nucleosides, e.g., adenosine and puripe bases, e.g., adenine, and thyroid hormone, e.g., triiodothyridine. Antibodies to the extracellular domain of nutrient transporters may also be used as transport vectors. Other possible vectors include angiotensin H and ANP, which may be involved in regulating BBB permeability.<br>
In some cases, the bond linking the therapeutic agent to the transport vector may be cleaved following transport into the brain in order to liberate the biologically active agent. Exemplary linkers include disulfide bonds, ester-based linkages, thioether linkages, amide bonds, acid-labile linkages, and Schiff base linkages. Avidin/biotin linkers, in which avidin is covalently coupled to the BBB drug transport vector, may also be used. Avidin itself may be a drug transport vector.<br>
Transcytosis, including receptor-mediated transport of compositions across the blood brain barrier, may also be suitable for the agents of the invention. Transferrin receptor-mediated delivery is disclosed in US- Pat Nos. 5,672,683; 5,383,988; 5,527,527; 5,977,307; and 6,015,555. Transferrin-mediated transport is also known. P.M.

In general, it is well within the ordinary skill in the art to prepare an ester, amide or hydrazide derivative of an agent of the invention, for example, from the corresponding carboxylic acid and a suitable reagent. For instance, a carboxylic acid-containing compound, or a reactive equivalent thereof, may be reacted with a hydroxyl-containing compound, or a reactive equivalent thereof, so as to provide the corresponding ester. See, e.g., "Comprehensive Organic Transformations," 2nd Ed., by R.C. Larock, VCH Publishers John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. (199989); "March's Advanced Organic Chemistry," 5th Ed., by M.B. Smith and J. March, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. (2000).<br>
The compound may also act from the periphery, causing a change in the equilibrium of the amyloid protein concentration in the two compartments i.e. (systemic vs central). In this case a compound may not be required to penetrate the brain to induce or decrease the concentration of Aβ in the brain (a "sink" effect)<br>
Prodrugs<br>
The present invention is also related to prodrugs of the agents of the Formulae disclosed herein. Prodrugs are agents which are converted in vivo to active forms {see, e.g., R.B. Silverman, 1992, 'The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action," Academic Press, Chp. 8). Prodrugs can be used to alter the biodistribution (e.g., to allow agents which would not typically enter the reactive site of the protease) or the pharmacokinetics for a particular agent For example, a carboxylic acid group, can be esterified, e.g., with a methyl group or an ethyl group to yield an ester. When the ester is administered to a subject, the ester is cleaved, enzymaticaliy or non-enzymatically, reductively, oxidatively, or hydrolytically, to reveal the anionic group. An anionic group can be esterified with moieties (e.g., acyloxymethyl esters) which are cleaved to reveal an intermediate agent which subsequently decomposes to yield the active agent. The prodrug moieties may be metabolized in vivo by esterases or by other mechanisms to carboxylic acids.<br><br>
Examples of prodrugs and their uses are well known in the art (see, e.g., Berge, et al.9 "Pharmaceutical Salts", J. Pharm. ScL 66,1-19 (1977)). The prodrugs can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the agents, or by separately reacting the purified agent in its free acid form with a suitable derivaitizing agent. Carboxylic acids can be converted into esters via treatment with an alcohol in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
Examples of cleavable carboxylic acid prodrug moieties include substituted and unsubstituted, branched or unbranched lower alkyl ester moieties, (e.g., ethyl esters, propyl esters, butyl esters, pentyl esters, cyclopentyl esters, hexyl esters, cyclohexyl esters), lower alkenyl esters, dilower a Iky I-ami no lower-alkyl esters (e.g., dtmethylaminoethyl ester), acylamino lower alkyl esters, acyloxy lower alkyl esters (e.g., pivaloyloxymethyl ester), aryl esters (phenyl ester), aryl-Iower alkyl esters (e.g., benzyl ester), substituted (e.g., with methyl, halo, or methoxy substituents) aryl and aryl-lbwer alkyl esters, amides, lower-alkyl amides, dilower alkyl amides, and hydroxy amides.<br>
Pharmaceutical Preparations<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising agents according to any of the Formulae herein for the treatment of an amyloid-p related disease, as well as methods of manufacturing such pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
In general, the agents of the present invention may be prepared by the methods illustrated in the general reaction schemes as, for example, in the patents and patent applications refered to herein, or by modifications thereof, using readily available starting materials, reagents and conventional synthesis procedures. In these reactions, it is also possible to make use of variants which are in themselves known, but are not mentioned here. Functional and structural equivalents of the agents described herein and which have the same general properties, wherein one or more simple variations of substituents are made which do not adversely affect the essential nature or the utility of the agent.<br>
The agents of the invention may be supplied in a solution with an appropriate solvent or in a solvent-free form (e.g., lyophilized). In another aspect of the invention, the agents and buffers necessary for carrying out the methods of the invention may be packaged as a kit The kit may be commercially used according to the methods described herein and may include instructions for use in a method of the invention. Additional kit components may include acids, bases, buffering agents, inorganic salts, solvents, antioxidants, preservatives, or metal chelators. The additional kit components are present as pure compositions, or as aqueous or organic solutions that incorporate one or more additional kit components. Any or all of the kit components optionally further comprise buffers.<br><br>
The therapeutic agent may also be administered parenterally, intraperitoneally, intraspinally, or intracerebrally. Dispersions can be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations may contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.<br>
To administer the therapeutic agent by other than parenteral administration, it may be necessary to coat the agent with, or co-administer the agent with, a material to prevent its inactivation. For example, the therapeutic agent may be administered to a subject in an appropriate carrier, for example, liposomes, or a diluent Pharmaceutical^ acceptable diluents include saline and aqueous buffer solutions. Liposomes include water-in-oil-in-water CGF emulsions as well as conventional liposomes (Strejan et a/., J, Neuroimmunol 7,27 (1984)).<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. In all cases/the composition must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, without limitation, any non-immunogenic pharmaceutical adjuvants suitable for oral, parenteral, nasal, mucosal, transdermal, intravascular (IV), intraarterial (IA), intramuscular (IM), and subcutaneous (SC) administration routes, such as phosphate buffer saline (PBS).<br>
The vehicle can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, isotonic agents are included, for example, sugars, sodium chloride, or polyalcohols such as mannitol and sorbitol, in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate or gelatin.<br>
Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the therapeutic agent in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the therapeutic agent into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile<br><br>
powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-diying which yields a powder of the active ingredient (Le., the therapeutic agent) plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.<br>
The therapeutic agent can be orally administered, for example, with an inert diluent or an » assimilable edible carrier. The therapeutic agent and other ingredients may also be enclosed in a hard or soft shell gelatin capsule, compressed into tablets, or incorporated directly into the subject's diet For oral therapeutic administration, the therapeutic agent may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. The percentage of the therapeutic agent in the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied. The amount of the therapeutic agent in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of therapeutic agent calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical vehicle. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the therapeutic agent and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such a therapeutic agent for the treatment of amyloid deposition in subjects.<br>
The present invention therefore includes pharmaceutical formulations comprising the agents of the Formulae described herein, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for aerosol, oral and parenteral administration. Also, the present invention includes such agents, or salts thereof, which have been Iyophilized and which may be reconstituted to form pharmaceutically acceptable formulations for administration, as by intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injection. Administration may also be intradermal or transdermal.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, an agent of the Formulae described herein, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may be administered orally or through inhalation as a solid, or may be administered intramuscularly or intravenously as a solution, suspension or emulsion. Alternatively, the agents or salts may also be administered by inhalation, intravenously or intramuscularly as a liposomal suspension.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations are also provided which are suitable for administration as an aerosol, by inhalation. These formulations comprise a solution or suspension of the desired agent of any Formula herein, or a salt thereof, or a plurality Of solid particles of the agent or salt The desired formulation may be placed in a small chamber and nebulized. Nebulization may be<br><br>
accomplished by compressed air or by ultrasonic energy to form a plurality of liquid droplets or solid particles comprising the agents or salts. The liquid droplets or solid particles should have a particle size in the range of about 0.5 to about 5 microns. The solid particles can be obtained by processing the solid agent of any Formula described herein, or a salt thereof, in any appropriate manner known in the art, such as by micronization. The size of the solid particles or droplets will be, for example, from about 1 to about 2 microns. In this respect, commercial nebulizers are available to achieve this purpose.<br>
A pharmaceutical formulation suitable for administration as an aerosol may be in the form of a liquid, the formulation will comprise a water-soluble agent of any Formula described herein, or a salt thereof, in a carrier which comprises water. A surfactant may be present which lowers the surface tension of the formulation sufficiently to result in the formation of droplets within the desired size range when subjected to nebulization.<br>
Peroral compositions also include liquid solutions, emulsions, suspensions, and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers suitable for preparation of such compositions are well known in the art. Typical components of carriers for syrups, elixirs, emulsions and suspensions include ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, liquid sucrose, sorbitol, and water. For a suspension, typical suspending agents include methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, tragacanth, and sodium alginate; typical wetting agents include lecithin and polysorbate 80; and typical preservatives include methyl paraben and sodium benzoate. Peroral liquid compositions may also contain one or more components such as sweeteners, flavoring agents and colorants disclosed above.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions may also be coated by conventional methods, typically with pH or time-dependent coatings, such that the subject agent is released in the gastrointestinal tract in the vicinity of the desired topical application, or at various times to extend the desired action. Such dosage forms typically include, but are not limited to, one or more of cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinylacetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate, ethyl cellulose, waxes, and shellac.<br>
Other compositions useful for attaining systemic delivery of the subject agents include sublingual, buccal and nasal dosage forms. Such compositions typically comprise one or more of soluble filler substances such as sucrose, sorbitol and mannitol; and binders such as acacia, microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, GHdants, lubricants, sweeteners, colorants, antioxidants and flavoring agents disclosed above may also be included.<br>
The compositions of this invention can also be administered topically to a subject, e.g., by the direct laying on or spreading of the composition on the epidermal or epithelial tissue of the subject, or transdermal^ via a "patch". Such compositions include, for example, lotions,<br><br>
creams, solutions, geis and solids. These topical compositions may comprise an effective amount, usually at least about 0.1%, or evan from about 1% to about 5%, of an agent of the invention. Suitable carriers for topical administration typically remain in place on the skin as a continuous film, and resist being removed by perspiration or immersion in water. Generally, the carrier is organic in nature and capable of having dispersed or dissolved therein the therapeutic agent. The carrier may include pharmaceutical^ acceptable emolients, emulsifiers, thickening agents, solvents and the like.<br>
Active agents are administered at a therapeutically effective dosage sufficient to inhibit amyloid deposition in a subject. A "therapeutically effective" dosage inhibits amyloid deposition by, for example, at least about 20%, or by at least about 40%, or even by at least about 60%, or by at least about 80% relative to untreated subjects. In the case of an Alzheimer's subject, a "therapeutically effective" dosage stabilizes cognitive function or prevents a further decrease in cognitive function (le.9 preventing, slowing, or stopping disease progression). The present invention accordingly provides therapeutic drugs. By "dierapeutic" or "drug" is meant an agent having a beneficial ameliorative or prophylactic effect on a specific disease or condition in a living human or non-human animal.<br>
Furthermore, active agents are administered at a therapeutically effective dosage sufficient to decrease deposition in a subject of amyloid protein, e.g:, Ap40 or AJJ42. A therapeutically effective dosage inhibits amyloid deposition by, for example, at least about 15%, or by at least about 40%, or even by at least 60%, or at least by about 80% relative to untreated subjects.<br>
In another embodiment, active agents are administered at a therapeutically effective dosage sufficient to increase or enhance amyloid protein, e.g., Ap40 or A(J42, in the.blood of a subject A therapeutically effective dosage increases the concentration by, for example, at least about 15%, or by at least about 40%, or even by at least 60%, or at least by about 80% relative to untreated subjects.<br>
In yet another embodiment, active agents are administered at a therapeutically effective dosage sufficient to improve ADAS-cog test scores by, e.g., at least about 1 point, at least about 2 points, at least about 3 points, at least about 4 points, at least about 5 points, at least about 10 points, at least about 12 points, at least about 15 points, or at least about 20 points relative to untreated subjects.<br>
Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such agents can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e,g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50, and usually a larger therapeutic index are<br><br>
more efficacious. While agents that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such agents to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.<br>
It is understood that appropriate doses depend upon a number of factors within the ken of the ordinarily skilled physician, veterinarian, or researcher. The dose(s) of the small molecule will vary, for example, depending upon the identity, size, and condition of the subject or sample being treated, further depending upon the route by which the composition is to be administered, if applicable, and the effect which the practitioner desires the small molecule to have upon the nucleic acid or polypeptide of the invention. Exemplary doses include milligram or microgram amounts of the small molecule per kilogram of subject or sample weight (e.g., about 1 microgram per kilogram to about 500 milligrams per kilogram, about 100 micrograms per kilogram to about 5 milligrams per kilogram, or about 1 microgram per kilogram to about 50 micrograms per kilogram). It is furthermore understood that appropriate doses depend upon the potency with respect to the expression or activity to be modulated. Such appropriate doses may be determined using the assays described herein. When one or more of these small molecules is to be administered to an animal (e.g., a human) in order to modulate expression or activity of a polypeptide or nucleic acid of the invention, a physician, veterinarian, or researcher may, for example, prescribe a relatively low dose at first, subsequently increasing the dose until an appropriate response is obtained. In addition, it is understood that the specific dose level for any particular animal subject will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific agent employed, the age, body weight, general health, gender, and diet of the subject, the time of administration, the route of administration, the rate of excretion, any drug combination, and the degree of expression or activity to be modulated.<br>
The ability of an agent to inhibit amyloid deposition can be evaluated in an animal model system that may be predictive of efficacy in inhibiting amyloid deposition in human diseases, such as a transgenic mouse expressing human APP or other relevant animal models where Ap deposition is seen. Likewise, the ability of an agent to prevent or reduce cognitive impairment in a model system may be indicative of efficacy in humans. Alternatively, the ability of an agent. can be evaluated by examining the ability of the agent to inhibit amyloid fibril formation in vitro, e.g., using a fibrillogenesis assay such as that described herein, including a ThT, CD, or EM assay. Also the binding of an agent to amyloid fibrils may be measured using a MS assay as described herein.<br>
Pharmaceuticallv Acceptable Salts<br>
Certain embodiments of the present agents can contain a basic functional group, such as amino or alkylamino, and are, thus, capable of forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts with<br><br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acids. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" in this respect, refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts of agents of the present invention. These salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the agents of the invention, or by separately reacting a purified agent of the invention in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid, and isolating the salt thus formed.<br>
Representative salts include the hydrohalide (including hydrobromide and hydrochloride), sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, nitrate, acetate, valerate, oleate, palmitate, stearate, laurate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tartrate, napthylate, mesylate, giucoheptonate, lactobionate, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, and laurylsulphonate salts and the like. See, e.g., Berge et aL, "Pharmaceutical Salts", Jl Pharm. ScL 66,1-19(1977).<br>
In other cases, the agents of the present invention may contain one or more acidic functional groups and, thus, are capable of forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts with pharmaceutically acceptable bases. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" in these instances refers to die relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic base addition salts of agents of the present invention.<br>
These salts can likewise be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the agents, or by separately reacting the purified agent in its free acid form with a suitable base, such as the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation, with ammonia, or with a pharmaceutically acceptable organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine. Representative alkali or alkaline earth salts include the lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and aluminum salts and the like. Representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include ethylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanoiamine, piperazine and the like.<br>

Such equivalents are intended to be encompassed by the scope of the following claims. All patents, patent applications, and literature references cited herein are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety. This invention is further illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed as limiting.<br>
"Pharmaceutically acceptable salts" also includes, for example, derivatives of agents modified by making acid or base salts thereof, as described further below and elsewhere in the present application. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; and alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids.

inorganic or organic acids. Such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, and nitric acid; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, palmoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, and isethionic acid. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be synthesized from the parent agent which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts may be prepared by reacting the free acid . or base forms of these agents with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two.<br>

Binding and Antifibrillozenic Assays<br>
Test compounds were purchased from commercial sources or synthesized and screened by mass spectroscopy ("MS") assays. The MS assay gives data on the ability of compounds to bind to an amyloid.<br>
In the mass spectroscopy ("MS") assay, samples were prepared as aqueous solutions containing 20% ethanol, 200 nM of a test compound and 20 pM of solubilized Ap40. The pH value of each sample was adjusted to 7.4 (±0.2) by addition of 0,1% aqueous sodium hydroxide. The solutions were then analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy using a Waters ZQ 4000 mass spectrometer. Samples were introduced by direct infusion at a flow-rate of 25 nL/min within 2 hr. after sample preparation. The source temperature was kept at 70 °C and the cone voltage was 20 V for all the analysis. Data were processed using Masslynx 3.5 software. The MS assay gives data on the ability of compounds to bind to soluble Aβ, whereas the ThT, EM and CD assays give data on inhibition of fibrillogenesis. The results from the assay for binding to Ap are summarized in Table 2. "+-H-" indicates strong binding; "-H-" indicates<br><br>
moderate binding;"+" indicates weak binding;"-" indicates no detectable binding; and entries left blank were not determined.<br>
An ultraviolet absorption assay is also available, and this assay gives an indication of the ability of test compounds to bind to (fibrillar) Ap. The experiments were carried out in a blinded fashion. Test compound at 20 fiM was incubated with 50 nM AjJ(MO) fibers for 1 h at 37°C in Tris buffered saline (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 containing 0.01 sodium azide). Following incubation, the solution was centrifuged for 20 min at 21,000 g to sediment the Aβ(l-40) fibers along with any bound test compound. The amount of test compound remaining in the supernatant was determined by reading the absorbance. The fraction of test compound bound was then calculated by comparing the amount remaining in the supernatants of incubations with Ap to the amount remaining in control incubations which do not contain Ap fibers. Thioflavin T and Congo Red, both of which are known to bind to Ap fibers, are included in each assay run as positive controls. Before assaying, test compounds were diluted to 40 fiM, which is twice the concentration in the final test, and then scanned using the Hewlett Packard 8453 UV/VIS spectrophotometer to determine if the absorbance was sufficient for detection.<br>
Observed Synergistic Effects of Combination Therapy in Human Patients<br>
In this example, mild and moderate patients have been treated with an alkanesulfonic acid, namely 3-amino-l-propanesulfonic acid, in combination with other therapeutic compounds used to diminish symptoms characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (e.g., loss of cognitive functions). Hie examples comprise the use of an alkanesulfonic acid in combination with cognitive enhancers such as acetylcholine esterase inhibitors ("AChEi")- The effect of these combination therapies on the change in ADAS-cog score in the patients was determined.<br>
Patients were treated with the test alkanesulfonic acid for a period of 9 months. A group of patients received the test compound alone while another group were treated with the test compound in combination with an AChEi, namely donepezil.<br>
Effect on ADAS-Cog. Upon entering the study, Alzheimer's patients were categorized as being "mild" or "moderate" according to their MMSE ("Mini Mental State Examination") score. B.WJRover, et at, "Mini-mental state exam in clinical practice." Hospital Practice 22(1 A), 99 et seqt (1987). (According to this examination a MMSE score in the range of 19 to 26 was considered "mild," and a score in the range 13 to 18 was considered "moderate." Then, the change in mental function of these patients was analyzed by using their ADAS-Cog scores, which were recorded periodically over a nine month period. During this time, certain of the patients received the test alkanesulfonic acid compound, and others received the same alkanesulfonic acid concomitantly with donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. The average<br><br>
change in ADAS-Cog score for each group of patients was compared to the standard reported change in similar Alzheimer's disease patients who have been treated with donepezil alone. The reference and experimental data are tabulated below, according to the particular therapeutic<br>
regimen and the patient population:<br><br>
A positive change in ADAS-Cog score reflects a deterioration of cognitive function of a "mild AD" patient; stabilization is seen by a change of ±1; and a negative change shows an improvement in cognitive function. The medical literature predicts that patients with Alzheimer's disease who do not receive any treatment will, on average, have a change in ADAS-cog score over nine months varying from +2.5 (for "mild" patients) to +5 (for "moderate" patients).<br>
As the results indicate, patients who were treated with the test compound alone had a stable ADAS-Cog score (-0.5 on average, both the mild and moderate groups are considered together for convenience), and therefore the test compound appears to have limited a further decrease in the cognitive function of patients in this group over the test period.<br>
The quantitative effects for each therapeutic drug regimen when administered separately are known. An additive effect for the combined mild plus moderate patient group would therefore be in the in the range of (+5.0 to +2.5) + (-0.5), which calculates to a deterioration on the ADAS-Cog scale of +2.0 to +4.5 points. Surprisingly, the opposite effect is observed. The effect of concomitant administration of the test alkanesulfonic acid compound with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor led to an improvement of cognitive function (-3.0), whereas the predicted result is a decline. These results show an example of the benefit of having combination therapy for Alzheimer's disease patients.<br>
The alkanesulfonic acid used in the study is known to have an effect on the concentration of Ap in the brain. We also determined the effect of test compound on the change in Ap CSF levels of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease compared to that seen in patients treated with a triple combination of test compound with AChEi and statin.<br><br>
Patients treated with alkanesulfonic test compound in the presence or absence of AchEi and statin were evaluated for their Ap CSF concentration at time 0 and 3 months following the initiation of treatment with the alkanesulfonic acid. The change in Ap42 CSF concentration was compared to the respective placebo group.<br>
Patients treated with the test compound had a decrease of 34% in Ap CSF concentration. The test compound was previously shown to decrease the levels of both soluble and insoluble Ap42 in the brain of transgenic mice. Based on the mice studies the test compound is hypothesized to favor the clearance of Ap from the brain and CSF prior to its deposition. The decrease in Ap CSF concentration seen in patients treated with the test compound is greater than that seen in the placebo group, where patients showed a non-significant increase of 15% in their Ap CSF concentration. This result demonstrates a difference of 49% between the two groups. Patients treated with the triple therapy (test compound and AchEi and statin) showed a decrease of 31% - while patients on AChEi and statin showed an increase of 45% in their Ap42 CSF levels. This triple therapy showed a greater effect on the change (-76%) of AP42 CSF concentration when compared to the appropriate controls.<br>
In sum, when compared to the respective placebo group, the combination of test compound with AchEi and statin showed a much greater effect on the Ap CSF concentration than test compound alone.<br>
Methodology. CSF was obtained from patients before and after treatment with the test compound at daily doses of 100 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg. CSF was fractionated by FPLC following treatment with formic acid, and then the Ap containing fraction was lyophilised. The amount of Aβ peptide was measured using an ELISA assay (Biosource). The test alkanesulfonic acid-containing composition was found to reduce the CSF level of Ap when patients were treated with 200 or 300 mg daily doses. A majority of patients on placebo and on 100 mg daily doses showed stable Ap CSF levels over a 3-month period, whereas the greatest reduction of Ap occurred in patients receiving 200 or 300 mg daily doses. The presence of a drug in the cerebrospinal fluid suggests that the drug crosses the blood brain barrier to penetrate the brain. The presence of the alkanesulfonic acid in the CSF was determined in patients who had received treatment for three months. In these patients, CSF was collected five hours following dosing, and levels of alkanesulfonic acid were determined by LC-MS/MS. The test alkanesulfonic acid was found to be present in CSF of patients in a dose-dependent manner, e.g., patients receiving 200 or 300 mg daily dosing had a greater concentration than that seen in patients with 100 mg daily dosing.<br>
Cognitive function with combination therapy-alkanesulfonic acid plus an acetyl cholenesterase inhibitor. Mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease patients who had been on cognition enhancers (Aricept™ or Exelon™) were co-medicated with daily doses of test drug (300 mg alkanesulfonic acid) for six months. At the time the experiments were undertaken the<br><br>
peer-reviewed medical literature indicated that patients who had been on AChE inhibitors for more than twelve months would be expected to show a decline in cognitive functions of at least two to three points on the ADAS-Cog scale over a sue month period. In order to determine whether the drug could potentiate or even stabilize the benefits of AChE inhibitors, patients were treated with both AChE and the test drug for a period of six months. Although the expectation was that the cognitive functions of patients receiving only AChE inhibitors would inevitably decline, the study shows that patients receiving co-medication had stable or improved ADAS-Cog, as illustrated in Graph A of the Figures, attached hereto. These results show that the test drug given concomitantly with AChE inhibitors is able to maintain and even improve the cognitive function of patients.<br><br><br><br>
