Field of Invention <br>
The present invention relates to Textile Industry and more Particularly this invention relates to Top Arm compact pressure unit. Hitherto, in Textile Machine such as Simplex Machine, Spinning Machine wherein the Air Pressure is applied over the unit through Hose. This method has its own liabilities such as leakage of air, breakdown of compressor motor. Correspondingly the quality of yam is affected and also reduction in quality.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
In the existing technology, compressor motor for creating air pressure is found necessary. In order to operate the compressor, electrical energy is required. Even  though. Air-pressure unit is of vogue from the early days of Textile Technology, it has its own disadvantage such as specific need of electricity with consequent maintenance problem in the compressor motor. In addition, during the period of power cut, the entire textile manufacturing unit would be left idle, there by causes degeneration of textile products. Further, energy saving is the need of the hour. In such context, it decided to innovate an alternate technology to replace the Air pressure unit.<br>
The objective of the invention is to overcome the problem in the prior art.<br>
Following are the draw-backs associated with the existing technology.<br>
1.	Total shutdown during power-cut.<br>
2.	Maintenance is required periodically.<br>
3.	Energy saving methodology is not followed.<br>
4.	Installation and dependency rate is high.<br>
5.	Capital investment is comparatively high.<br><br>
6. Every resumption of textile unit after shutdown or failure in compression occurs, the yam m each and every top-arm at its end used to be terminated. It requires skilled labour to work again, manually.<br>
Various methods such as magnetic compression, hydraulic compression and electrical compression were tried. Though the compressive force was acquired, the net achievement was not satisfactory resulting m this invention.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
Top arm compact pressure unit for textile machine is characterized in that it comprises a main body (3) where the handle (1) is fitter at the top, a handle (1) which is to apply required pressure, a saddle (2) which is fitted to the main body (3) having front, middle and back portion to allow yam to pass through, a chamber (8) where the coil spring (7) is incorporated, a enact platform (9) which is fitted at the top portion of the spring where the required pressure is applied, a pressure plate (10) which is fitted at the bottom portion of the coil spring (7), a pressure screw(12) which is fixed with pressure plate at the bottom where the required pressure is adjusted. Detailed Description of the Invention:<br>
In the field of textile musty, top arm compactor unit plays main role in producing good quality of yam. Main projective of the invention using mechanical force all the above said problems were solved.<br>
The Textiles Industry played a key role in fulfilling the one of the basic necessities of human bema. Quality yam produced better quality in Cloth. The Ring Frame top-arm pressure, is one of the main aspect to produce better quality yam. Therefore the Technology, now innovated is pressure applied thro' the coil. Hitherto, Pneumatic pressure Top-arm used in Textile Simplex wherein the Air pressure  is     causing  leakage of air, breakdown of Compressor   Motor   etc.,<br><br>
Correspondingly the quality of yam is affected with reduction in the quantity. Therefore we conducted trials with various methods for applying the pressure over the unit. We succeeded in our attempt and have invented the COMPACT PRESSURE UNIT without the disadvantages found in the pneumatic pressure unit. The Mechanical is applied over the unit. "Basic Amenity" with Energy saving and Quality Serving manner product by means of the newly innovated " COMPACT PRESSURE UNIT"<br>
The top arm pressure unit consists of,<br>
1.Handle<br>
2.saddle<br>
3.Main body<br>
4.clamp bracket<br>
5.Air tube.<br>
6.Rubber hose<br>
y.coil spring<br>
8. chamber<br>
9.Impact platform.<br>
10.Pressure plate<br>
11.Press unit.<br>
12.Pressure screw<br>
When handle is pressed yarn pass through front middle and back roll of the saddle. When thread pass through the last saddle exact dimension is obtained. When air flow through the air tube (5) which is fitted with clamp bracket (4) air does not pass through evenly. Further rubber hose (6) get worn out resuk in leakage of air and break down of compressor. The object of the invention is overcome of the problem there by increase the quality of yarn. The inventor has provided a spring coil inside a chamber and mechanical pressure is<br><br>
applied through the coil. A chamber may be either circular or hexogonal as explained different embodiments of invention.<br>
In order to keep the coil spring 7 in place inside the chamber (8) there is provided an impact platform at the top of the spring and a pressure plate (10) at the bottom. (Fig 7 and 8). Press unit is denoted by numeral (11)<br>
Detailed Description of the Drawings:<br>
The invention will now be described in detail with reference to drawings accompany the complete specification.<br>
Figure 1 shows in elevation air pressing unit for simplex and spinning machine known in the art wherein the air inlet pipe is circular.<br>
Figure 2 shows in elevation air pressing unit for simplex and spinning machine known in the art wherein the air inlet pipe is hexagonal.<br>
Figure 3 shows top arm compact pressure unit according to the invention wherein the arm is in un-engaging position and when the spring is enclosed in a circular chamber.<br>
Figure 4 shows top arm compact pressure unit according to the invention wherein the arm is in engaging position and when the spring is enclosed in a circular chamber.<br><br>
Figure 5 shows top arm compact pressure unit accordingly to the invention, wherein the arm is in un-engaging position and when the spring is enclosed in a hexagonal chamber.<br>
Figure 6 show top arm compact pressure unit accordingly to the invention. wherein the arm is in engaging position and when the spring is enclosed in a hexagonal chamber.<br>
Figure 7 &amp; 8 show how spring is fitted inside either the circular or hexagonal chamber.<br>
Referring to the drawings the unit consist a handle (I) fitted to the main body (3). The main body has a saddle (2). The saddle has front, middle and end portion to accommodate three rolls where the yam pass through.<br>
In the conventional method shown in Figure (1) air is passed through rubber hose (6) either in the circular steel pipe or hexognonai steel pipe.<br>
When handle is pressed yarn pass through front middle and back roll of the saddle. When thread pass through the last saddle exact dimension is obtained. When air flow through the air tube (5) which is fitted with clamp bracket (4) air does not pass through evenly. Further rubber hose (6) get worn out result in leakage of air and break down of compressor. The object of the invention is overcome of the problem there by increase the quality of yam. The inventor has provided a spring coil inside a chamber and mechanical pressure is applied through the coii. A chamber may be either circular or hexogonal as explained different embodiments of invention.<br><br>
In order to keep the coil spring 7 in place inside the chamber (8) there is provided an impact platform at the lop of the spring and a pressure plate (10) at the bottom. (Fig 7 and 8). Press unit is denoted by numeral (1!)<br>
