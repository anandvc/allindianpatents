				<td>AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS OF OPTICAL BRIGHTENERS<br>
The instant invention relates to storage stable aqueous solutions of stilbene optical brighteners with polyvinyl alcohols which can be directly used by the papermaker.<br>
It is well known that the whiteness and thereby the attractiveness of coated papers can be improved by the addition of optical brighteners to the coating slip. In order to satisfy the demand for coated papers of higher whiteness, there is a need for more efficient optical brighteners.<br>
WO 96/00221 discloses tetrasulphonated stilbene brighteners derived from amino acids for use in paper, textiles and detergents. Polyvinyl alcohols are included in a list of additives which are said to boost the performance of brighteners when applied to the surface of paper.<br>
WO 98/42685 discloses hexasulphonated stilbene brighteners made by using certain amino acids, disclaiming the compounds of WO 96/00221. Also described is a method for the fluorescent whitening of a paper surface by applying the brightener as part of a pigmented coating composition which also comprises polyvinyl alcohol as a water-soluble co-binder or protective colloid.<br>
EP 1355004 describes the use of certain stilbene brighteners which are not derived from amino acids for brightening aqueous coating slips comprising at least one latex binder and at least one synthetic co-binder differing therefrom. Polyvinyl alcohols are cited as being preferred synthetic co-binders.<br>
Japanese Kokai 62-106965 discloses certain hexasulphonated stilbene brighteners derived from amino acids. The brighteners are claimed to be very effective for the fluorescent whitening of paper, and may be applied to the paper surface as part of a sizing solution or a pigmented coating composition. Polyvinyl alcohol is mentioned as a possible component of the sizing solution.<br>
Even though it is known from the prior art that polyvinyl alcohol, among other compounds, can boost the brightening performance, until now the papermaker, when wanting to use said alcohol, has had to add it separately to the coating slip. Therefore a need still exists to simplify the process of preparing brightened, coated papers.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that it is possible to produce storage stable solutions consisting essentially of a stilbene optical brightener and a polyvinyl alcohol which may be used directly by the papermaker, in that they may be diluted with water and/or be metered directly into a coating composition, to provide coated papers of a particularly high whiteness.<br>
The invention thus provides aqueous optical brightener solutions consisting essentially of<br>
(a)     at least one optical brightener of formula (1)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
M     is hydrogen, an alkali metal atom, ammonium or a cation derived from an<br>
amine, preferably hydrogen or sodium, most preferably sodium, n       is 1 or 2, and X      is a natural or unnatural amino acid from which a hydrogen atom of the<br>
amino group has been removed;<br>
(b)    polyvinyl alcohol having a degree of hydrolysis greater than 75% and a<br>
Brookfield viscosity of 2-40 mPa.s (4% w/w aqueous solution at 20°C); and<br>
(c)    water.<br>
In optical brighteners for which n is 1, the SO3M group is preferably in the 4-position of the phenyl ring.<br>
In optical brighteners for which n is 2, the SO3M groups are preferably in the 2,5-positions of the phenyl ring.<br>
Examples of amino acids from which X may be derived are alanine, 2-aminobutyric acid, asparagine, aspartic acid, S-carboxymethylcysteine, cysteic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, iminodiacetic acid, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, N-methyltaurine, norleucine, norvaline, phenylalanine, 2-phenylglycine, pipecolinic acid, proline, sarcosine, serine, taurine, threonine, and valine. Where the amino acid contains a chiral centre, either optical isomer, or the racemic mixture, can be used.<br>
Preferred amino acids are aspartic acid, glutamic acid and iminodiacetic acid.<br>
The aqueous solutions may contain up to 10% by weight of salt, typically sodium chloride, formed as a by-product from the production of the optical brightener.<br>
The aqueous solutions may also contain one or more antifreezes, biocides, complexing agents or other additives, as well as organic by-products formed during the preparation of the optical brightener.<br>
The polyvinyl alcohol preferably has a degree of hydrolysis greater than or equal to 80% and a Brookfield viscosity of 2-20 mPa.s.<br>
Preferably the weight ratio of polyvinyl alcohol to optical brightener lies in the range 0.01:1 to 1.5:1. More preferably, the ratio lies in the range 0.03:1 to 1:1.<br>
The water content of the solution is suitably at least such that the solution is still stirrable and preferably easily pourable; in concentrated solutions the concentration of<br>
the optical brightener is advantageously in the range 6 to 60%, preferably 10 to 50% by weight of the solution.<br>
The pH of the aqueous solutions is preferably from neutral to clearly alkaline, in particular in the range pH 7 to pH 10. The pH may, if necessary, be adjusted by addition of M-corresponding bases, e.g. alkali metal hydroxides or carbonates, ammonia or amines.<br>
The optical brightener solutions of the invention are storage-stable and may be used directly as such, in that they may be diluted with water and/or be metered directly into a coating composition. Thus a further object of the invention is the addition of the brightener solutions to coating compositions in order to obtain a coated and optically brightened paper.<br>
Thus, the invention also provides a process for the production of coated paper that is optically brightened at least in the coating, wherein a coating composition as described above is coated onto paper after sheet formation.<br>
The coating compositions are essentially aqueous compositions that contain at least one binder and a white pigment, in particular an opacifying white pigment, and may additionally contain further additives such as dispersing agents and defoamers.<br>
Although it is possible to produce coating compositions that are free from white pigments, the best white substrates for printing are made using opaque coating compositions that contain 10-70% white pigment by weight. Such white pigments are generally inorganic pigments, e.g., aluminium silicates (kaolin, otherwise known as china clay), calcium carbonate (chalk), titanium dioxide, aluminium hydroxide, barium carbonate, barium sulphate, or calcium sulphate (gypsum).<br>
The binders may be any of those commonly used in the paper industry for the production of coating compositions and may consist of a single binder or of a mixture of primary and secondary binders. The sole or primary binder is preferably a synthetic latex, typically a styrene-butadiene, vinyl acetate, styrene acrylic, vinyl acrylic or<br>
ethylene vinyl acetate polymer. The secondary binder may be, e.g., starch, carboxymethylcellulose, casein, soy polymers, or polyvinyl alcohol.<br>
The sole or primary binder is used in an amount typically in the range 5-25% by weight of white pigment. The secondary binder is used in an amount typically in the range 0.1-10% by weight of white pigment.<br>
The optical brightener of formula (1) is used in an amount typically in the range 0.01-1% by weight of white pigment, preferably in the range 0.05-0.5% by weight of white pigment.<br>
