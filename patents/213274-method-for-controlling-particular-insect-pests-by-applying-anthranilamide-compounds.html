TITLE<br>
METHOD FOR CONTROLLING PARTICULAR INSECT PESTS BY APPLYING<br>
ANTHRANTLAMIDE COMPOUNDS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a method of use for controlling invertebrate pests in both agronomic and nonagronomic environments of certain anthranilamides, their //-oxides, agriculturally suitable salts and compositions.<br>
The control of invertebrate pests is extremely important in achieving high crop efficiency. Damage by invertebrate pests to growing and stored agronomic crops can cause significant reduction in productivity and thereby result in increased costs to the consumer. The control of invertebrate pests in forestry, greenhouse crops, ornamentals, nursery crops, stored food and fiber products, livestock, household, and public and animal health is also important. Many products are commercially available for these purposes, but the need continues for new compounds that are more effective, less costly, less toxic, environmentally safer or have different modes of action.<br>

The team "halogen", either alone or in compound words such as "haloalkyl", includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. Further, when used in compound words such as "haloalkyl", said alkyl may be partially or fully substituted with halogen atoms which may be the same or different. Examples of "haloalkyl" include F3C, CICE^, CF3CH2 and CF3CCI2. The tenns "haloalkenyl", "haloalkynyl", "haloalkoxy", and the like, are defined analogously to the tram "haloalkyl". Examples of "haloalkenyl" include (Ci)2C=CHCH2 and CF3CH2CH=CHCH2. Examples of "haloalkynyl" include HOCCHC1, CF3OC, CCl3CsC and FCH2CsCCH2. Examples of "haloalkoxy" include CF30, CC13CB20, HCF2CH2CH20 and CF3CH20.<br>
The total number of carbon atoms in a substituent group is indicated by the "Cj-Cj" prefix where i and j are numbers from 1 to 8. For example, C]-C4 alkylsulfonyl designates methylsulfoiiyl through butylsulfonyl; C2 alkoxyalkyl designates CH3OCH2; C3 alkoxyalkyl designates, for example, CH3CH(OCTi3), CH3OCH2CFI2 or CH3CH2OCH2; and C4 alkoxyalkyl designates the various isomers of an alkyl group substituted with an alkoxy group containing a total of four carbon atoms, examples including CH3CH2CH2OCH2 and CH3CH2OCH2CH2. hi the above recitations, when a compound of Formula I comprises a heterocyclic ring, all. substituents are attached to this ring through any available carbon or nitrogen by replacement of a hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen.<br>
The term "optionally substituted with one to tkee substituents' indicates that one to three of the available positions on the group may be substituted. When a group contains a substituent which can be hydrogen, for. example R6, then, when this substituent is taken as hydrogen, it is recognized that this is equivalent to said group being unsubstituted.<br>
Compounds of Formula I can exist as one or more stereoisomers. The various stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers, atropisomers and geometric isomers. One skilled in the art will appreciate that one stereoisomer may be more active and/or may exhibit beneficial effects when enriched relative to the other stereoisomer^) or when separated from the other stereoisomers). Additionally, the skilled artisan knows how to separate, enrich, and/or to selectively prepare said stereoisomers. Accordingly, the compounds of Formula I may be present as a mixture of stereoisomers, individual stereoisomers, or as an optically active fomi. Similarly, compounds of Foimula 10 can exist as one or more stereoisomers. The various stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers, atropisomers and geometric isomers. One skilled in the ait; will appreciate that one stereoisomer of a compound of Formula 10 may be more useful in preparing a specific stereoisomer of Foimula I. Additionally, the skilled artisan knows how to separate, enrich, and/or to selectively prepare said stereoisomers. Accordingly, the compounds of Foimula 10 may be present as a mixture of stereoisomers, individual stereoisomers, or as an optically active foim.<br><br>

The salts of the compounds of Formula I include acid-addition salts with inorganic or<br>
organic acids such as hydrobromic, hydro chloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, acetic, butyric,<br>
fumaric, lactic, maleic, malonic, oxalic, propionic, salicylic, tartaric, 4-tolUenesuffonic or<br>
valeric acids.<br>
As noted above, R7 is (among others) a phenyl, a benzyl, a 5- or 6-membered<br>
heteroaromatic ring, a naphthyl ring system or an aromatic 8-, 9- or 10-membered fused<br>
heterobicyclic ring system, each ring or ring system optionally substituted with one to three<br>
substituents independently selected from R9. The term "optionally substituted" in<br>
connection with these R7 groups refers to groups which are unsubstituted or have at least one<br>
non-hydrogen substituent that does not extinguish the invertebrate pest control activity<br>
possessed by the unsubstituted analog. Note also that J-l through J-4 below denote 5- or<br>
6-membered heteroaromatic rings. An example of a phenyl ring optionally substituted with<br>
1 to 3 R9 is the ring illustrated as J-5 in. Exhibit 1, wherein r is an integer from 0 to 3. An<br>
example of a benzyl riug optionally substituted with 1 to 3 R9 is the ring illustrated as J-6 in<br>
Exhibit 1, wherein r is an integer from 0 to 3. An example of a naphthyl ring system<br>
optionally substituted with 1 to 3 R9 is illustrated as J-59 in Exhibit 1, wherein r. is an integer<br>
from 0 to 3. Examples of a 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic ring optionally substituted<br>
with 1 to 3 R9 include the rings J-7 through J-58 illustrated in Exhibit 1 wherein r is an<br>
integer from 0 to 3. Note that J-7 through J-26 are examples of JM, J-27 through J-41 are<br>
examples of J-2, and J-46 through J-58 are examples of J-3 and J-4. The nitrogen atoms that<br>
require substitution to fill then valence are substituted with H or R9. Note that some J<br>
groups can only be substituted with less than 3 R9 groups (e.g. J-l9, J-20, J-23 through J-26<br>
and J-37 through. J-40 can only be substituted with one R9). Examples of aromatic 8-, 9- or<br>
10-membered fused heterobicyclic ring systems optionally substituted with 1 to 3 Rp include<br>
J-60 through J-90 illustrated in Exbibit 1 wherein r is au integer from 0 to 3. Although R9<br>
groups are shown in the structures J~5 through J-90, it is noted that they do not need to be<br>
present since they are optional substituents. Note that when the attachment point between<br>
(R9),. and the J group is illustrated as floating, (R9)r can be attached to any available carbon<br>
atom of the J group. Note that when the attachment point on the J group is illustrated as<br>
floating, the J group can be attached to the remainder of Formula I through any available<br>
carbon of the J group by replacement of a hydrogen atom.<br>

The reaction is generally conducted in a solvent, which can comprise alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol, halogenated alkaues, such as dichloromeuiaue, aromatic solvents, such as benzene, toluene and chlorobenzene, ethers, such as tetrahydi'ofuran, and polar aprotic solvents, such as acetonitrile, such as such as acetonitrile, N,AMiraethylformamide, and the like. Alcohols and polar aprotic solvents are preferred for use with inorganic bases. Potassium carbonate as base and acetonitrile as solvent are preferred. The reaction is generally conducted between about 0 and 150 °C, with most typically between ambient temperature and 100 °C.   The product of Formula 32b can be isolated by conventional techniques such as extraction. The ester of Formula 32b can then be converted to the carboxylic acid of Formula 4d by the methods already described for the conversion of Formula 32 to Formula 4d in Scheme 17. Further experimental details for the method of Scheme 21 are illustrated in Example 16.<br>
Compounds of Formula 38 can be prepared from compounds of Formula 33 as outlined in Scheme 22.<br>

wherein R13 is C1-C4 alkyl.<br>
In mis method, a hydrazine compound of Formula 33 is contacted with a compound of Formula 40 (a fumarate ester or maleate ester or a rnixture thereof may be used) in the presence of a base and a solvent. The base is typically a metal alkoxide salt, such as sodium<br><br>

methoxide,   potassium   methoxide,   sodium   ethoxide,   potassium   ethoxide,   potassium fe/Y-butoxide, lithium tert-butoxide. and the like. Greater than 0.5 equivalents of base versus the compound of Formula 33 should be used, preferably between 0.9 and 1.3 equivalents. Greater than 1.0 equivalents of the compound of Formula 40 should be used/preferably 5     between 1.0 to 1.3 equivalents. Polar protic and polar aprotic organic solvents can be used, such as alcohols, acetomtrile, tetrahydrofuraii, JV^-dimemylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide-and the like. Preferred solvents are alcohols such as methanol and ethanol. It is especially preferred that the alcohol be the same as that making up the funiarate or maleate ester and the alkoxide base. The reaction is typically conducted by mixing the compound of Formula 10     33 and the base in the solvent. The mixtiue can be heated or cooled to a desired temperature and the compound of Formula 40 added over a period of time.    Typically reaction temperatures are between 0 °C and the boiling point of the solvent used. The reaction may be conducted under greater than atmospheric pressure in order to increase the boiling point of the, solvent.   Temperatures between about 30 and 90 °C are generally preferred    The 15      addition time can be as quick as heat transfer allows.  Typical addition times are between 1 minute and 2 hours.   Optimum reaction temperature and addition time vary depending upon the identities of the compounds of Formula 33 and Formula 40.   After addition, the reaction mixture can be held for a time at the reaction temperature.   Depending upon the reaction temperature, the required hold time may be from 0 to 2 hours. Typical hold times 20      are 10 to 60 minutes.  The reaction mass then can be acidified by adding an organic acid, such as acetic acid and die like, or an inorganic acid, such as hydro chloric acid, sulfuric acid aud the like. Depending on the reaction conditions and the means of isolation, the -C02R1;* function on the compound of Formula 38 may be hydrolyzed to -CO2H; for example, the presence of water in the reaction mixture can promote such hydrolysis.  If the carboxylic 25      acid (-C02H) is formed, it can be converted back to -C02R13 wherein R13 is C1-C4 allcyl using esterification methods well-known in the art.   The desired product, a compound of Formula 38, can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, such as crystallization, extraction or distillation.<br>
It is recognized that some reagents and reaction conditions described above for 30 preparing compounds of Formula I may not be compatible with certain functionalities present in the intermediates. In these instances, the incorporation of protection/deprotection sequences or functional group interconversions into the synthesis will aid in obtaining the desired products. The use and choice of the protecting groups will be apparent to one skilled in chemical synthesis (see, for example, Greene. T. W.: Wuts, P. G. M. Protective Groups in 35 Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed.; Wiley: New York, 1991). One skilled in the art will recognize that, in some cases, after the introduction of a given reagent as it is depicted in any individual scheme, it may be necessary to perform additional routine synthetic steps not described ha detail to complete the s^vnthesis of compounds of Formula I.

The mixture was stirred 5 minutes jat this temperature, and then 2-arrrino-3-methyl-5-chlorobenzoic acid (i.e. the product from Example 6, Step A) (1.86 g, 10 mmol) was added all at once. Then a solution of pyridine (2.8 raL, 2.7 g, 35 mmol) in acetonitiile (10 mL) was added dropwise in 5 mm at -5 to 0 °C.  The mixture was stirred 15 minutes at -5 to 0 °C,<br>
20 and then methanesulfonyl chloride (1.0 mL, 1.5 mL, 13 mmol) in acetonitrile (5 mL) was added dropwise in 5 iniu at -5 to 0 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred 15 minutes at this temperature, then allowed to warm, slowly to room temperature, and stirred 4 h. Water (15 mL) was added dropwise, aud the mixture was stirred 15 minutes. Then the mixture was filtered, and the solids were washed with 2:1 acetonitrile-water (3 x 3 inL), then with<br>
25 acetonitrile (2x3 mL), and dried under nitrogen to afford the title product as a pale yellow powder, 3.83 g (94.0% crude yield), melting at 199-201 °C. HPLC of the product using a Zorbax® RX-C8 chromatography column (4.6 mm * 25 cm, eluent 25-95% acetonitrile/ pH 3 water) showed a major peak corresponding to the title compound and having 97.8% of total chrornatogram peak area.<br>

Formulation/Utility<br>
Compounds of this invention will generally be used as a formulation or composition with an agriculturally suitable carrier comprising at least one of a liquid diluent, a solid diluent or a surfactant. The formulation or composition ingredients are selected to be consistent with the physical properties of the active ingredient, mode of application and environmental factors such as soil type, moisture and temperature. Useful formulations include liquids such as solutions (including emulsifiable concentrates), suspensions, emulsions (including microemulsions and/or suspoemulsions) and the like which optionally can be thickened into gels. Useful formulations further include solids such as dusts, powders, granules, pellets, tablets, films, and the like which can be water-dispersible ("wettable") or water-soluble. Active ingredient can be (micro)encapsulated and further formed into a suspension or solid formulation; alternatively the entire formulation of active ingredient can be encapsulated (or "overcoated"). Encapsulation can contiol or delay release of the active ingredient. Spray able formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes from about one to several hundred liters per hectare. High-strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation.<br>
The formulations will typically contain effective amounts of active ingredient, diluent and surfactant within the following approximate ranges that add up to 100 percent by weight.<br>

'typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers, 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, New Jersey. Typical liquid diluents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed., Interscience, New York, 1950. McCutcheon 's Detergents andEmuhifiers Annual, Allured Publ. Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents, Chemical Publ. Co., Inc., New York, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foam, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth and the like, or thickeners to increase viscosity.<br>
Surfactants include, for example, polyethoxylated alcohols, polyethoxylated alkylphenols, polyethoxylated sorbitan fatty acid esters, dialk)'! sulfosuccinates, alkyl<br><br>

sulfates, alkylbenzene sulfonates, organosilicones, i^A^dialkyltaurates, lignin sulfonates, naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensates, polycarboxylates, and polyoxyeth}'lene/polyoxyprop3'lene block copolymers. Solid diluents include, for example, clays such as bentonite, montmorillonite, attapulgite and kaolin, starch, sugar, silica, talc, 5      diatomaceous earth, urea, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate and bicarbonate, and sodium sulfate. Liquid diluents include, for example, water, A^A^dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, TV-alkylpyrrolidone, ethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, paraffins, alkylbenzenes, alkylnaphthalenes, oils of olive, castor, linseed, rung, sesame, corn, peanut, cotton-seed, soybean, rape-seed and coconut, fatty acid esters, ketones such as 10     cyclohexanone, 2-heptanbne, isophoroue and 4-hydi'oxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone, and alcohols such as methanol, cyclohexanol, decauol and tetrabydiofurfuiyl alcohol.<br>
Solutions, including emulsifiable concentrates, can be prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Dusts and powders can be prepared by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer mill or fluid-energy mill. Suspensions are usually prepared by wet-milling; see, for 15     example, U.S, 3,06O,0S4. Granules and pellets can be prepared by spraying the active<br>
material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See Browning, "Agglomeration", Chemical Engineering, December 4, 1967', pp 147-48, Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook, 4th Ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 1963, pages 8-57 and following, and PCT Publication WO 91/13546. Pellets can be prepared as described in U.S. 4,172,714. 20      Water-dispersible and water-soluble granules can be prepared as taught in U.S. 4,144,050, U.S. 3,920,442 and DE 3,246,493. Tablets can be prepared as taught in U.S. 5,180,587, U.S. 5,232,701 and U.S. 5,208,030. Films can be prepared as taught in GB 2,095,558 and U.S. 3,299,566.<br>

In certain instances, combinations with other invertebrate pest control compounds or 25     agents having a similar spectrum of control but a different mode of action will be<br>
particularly advantageous for resistance management. Thus, compositions of the present invention can further comprise an biologically effective amount of at least one additional invertebrate pest control compounds or agents having a similar spectrum of control but a different mode of action. Contacting a plant genetically modified to express a plant 30     protection compound (e.g., protein) orthe locus of the plant with a biologically effective amount of a compound of invention can also provide a broader spectrum of plant protection and be advantageous for resistance management.<br>
Invertebrate pests are controlled and protection of agronomic, horticultural and specialty crops, animal and human health is achieved by applying one or more of the 35     compounds of this invention, in an effective amount, to the environment of the pests including the agronomic and/or nonagronomic locus of infestation, to the area to be protected, or directly on the pests to be controlled. Thus: the present invention further comprises a method for the control of foliar- and soil-inhabiting invertebrates and protection<br><br>
WO 03/015518<br><br>
PCT/US02/25fil3<br><br>
99<br>
of agronomic and/or nonagronomic crops, comprising contacting the invertebrates or their environment with a biologically effective amount of one or more of the compounds of the invention, or with a composition comprising at least one such compound or a composition comprising at least one such compound and an effective amount of at least one additional 5     biologically active compound or agent. A preferred method of contact is by spraying. Alternatively, a granular composition comprising a compound of the invention can be applied to the plant foliage or the soil. Compounds of this invention are effective in delivery through plant uptake by contacting the plant with a composition comprising a compound of this invention applied as a soil drench of a liquid formulation, a granular formulation to the 10     soil, a nurs ery box treatment or a dip of transplants. Other methods of contact include<br>
application of a compound or a composition of the invention by direct and residual sprays, aerial sprays, seed coats, microencapsulations, systemic uptake, baits, eartags, boluses, foggers, fumigants, aerosols, dusts and many others.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be incorporated into baits that are consumed by<br>
15     the invertebrates or within devices such as traps and the like. Granules or baits comprising<br>
between 0.01-5% active ingredient, 0.05-10% moisture retaining agent(s) and 40-99%<br>
vegetable flour are effective in controlling soil insects at very low application rates,<br>
particularly at doses of active ingredient that are lethal by ingestion rather than by direct<br>
contact.<br>
20	The compounds of. this invention can be applied in their pure state, but most often<br>
application will be of a formulation comprising one or more compounds with suitable carriers, diluents, and surfactants and possibly in combination with a food depending on the contemplated end use. A preferred method of application involves spraying a water dispersion or refined oil solution of the compounds. Combinations with spray oils, spray oil 25     concentrations, spreader stickers, adjuvants, other solvents, and synergists such as piperonyl butpxide often enhance compound efficacy.<br>
The rate of application required for effective control (i.e. "biologically effective amount") will depend on such factors as the species of invertebrate to be controlled, the pest's life cycle, life stage, its size, location, time of year, host crop or animal, feeding 30     behavior, mating behavior, ambient moisture, temperature, and the like. Under normal circumstances, application rates of aboutO.01 to 2kg of active ingredient per hectare are sufficient to control pests in agronomic ecosystems, but as little as 0.0001 kg/hectare may be sufficient or as much as 8 kg/hectare may be required. For nonagronomic applications, effective use rates will range from about 1.0 to 50 ma/square meter but as little as 5^      0.1 mg/square meter may be sufficient or as much as 150 nag/square meter may be required. One skilled in the art can easily determine the biologically effective amount necessary for the desired level of invertebrate pest control.<br><br>

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION<br>
TESTA<br>
For evaluating control of fall armyworm (Spodoptemfmgiperda) the test unit consisted of a small open container with a 4-5-day-old com (maize) plant inside. This was pre-infested with 10-15 1 -day-old larvae on a piece of insect diet by us e of a core sampler to remove a plug from a sheet of hardened insect diet having many larvae growing on it and transfer the plug containing lan-'ae and diet to the test unit. The larvae moved onto the test plant as the diet plug dried out.<br>
Test compounds were formulated using a solution containing 10% acetone, 90?/Q water and 300 ppm X-77© Spreader Lo-Foam Formula non-ionic surfactant containing alkylarylpolyoxyethylene. free fatty acids, glycols and isopropanol (Loveland Industries. Inc.). unless otherwise indicated. 'The formulated compounds were applied in 1 mL of liquid<br><br>

through a SUJ2 atomizer nozzle with 1/8 JJ custom body (Spraying S3'3tems Co.) positioned 1.27 cm (0.5 inches) above the top of each test unit. AH experimental compounds in this screen were sprayed at 50 ppm and replicated three times. After spraying of the formulated test compound, each test unit was allowed to dry for 1 hour and then a black, screened cap was placed on top. The test units were held for 6 days in a growth chamber at 25 °C and 70% relative humidity. Plant feeding damage was then visually assessed.<br>

At four days after application the total number of dead thrips was recorded.<br>
•   Of the compounds tested, the following resulted in at least 90% mortality at 10 ppm: 542.<br>
TESTO Test O followed an alternative protocol for evaluating control of Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineate). Several hours prior to spraying, 5 mg (100% active ingredient, ai) of the test compounds were dissolved in 1 mL of acetone. Using the aqueous solution of 500 ppm of Ortho X-77™, the sample bottle was rinsed and added to the test compounds. This sample solution was then brought to 100 mL with the aqueous solution. Serial dilutions are made to obtain 50 mL of 10 ppm.<br>
Formulated experimental compounds were sprayed to run-off on three week old potato or tomato plants. The plants were placed on a rotating turntable sprayer (10 rpm). Test solutions were applied using a flat fan air-assisted nozzle (Spraying Systems 122440) at 10 psi (69 KPa). Once the plants were dried, leaves were excised from the treated plant. The leaves were cut, and then the pieces were placed singly into a 5.5 cm-by-3.5 cm cell of a sixteen-well plastic tray. Each cell contained a 2.5 square of moistened chromatography paper to prevent desiccation. One second instar larvae was placed in each cell. At three days after infestation total number of dead Colorado potato beetles was recorded.<br>
Of the compounds tested., the following resulted in at least 90% mortality at 10 ppm: 497: 500; 530: 543: 544, 558, 562 and 684.<br><br>

TESTP Seventy-eight cotton plants were grown in the greenhouse with natural lighting in Sassafras soil in six inch pots. When six true leaves were on the plant (approximately 36 cm tall) the soil was drenched with a solution of Compound 497:500, 530: 531 or 543. Each of the 5 compounds was dissolved in 2 mL of acetone, and distilled water was added to make 300 ppm solutions of each of the compounds. The pots were divided into six groups (13 plants / treatment), and 10 mL of each solution was applied over the soil surface of each group with one group left untreated. The plants were arranged in the greenhouse in a randomized block design. Each treatment was divided into three groups for sampling at 24, 48, and 96 hours.<br>
Leaves were taken from the base and tenninal of the plants. The leaves from the third node and the terminal leaves greater than 15 cm2 were sampled per plant. One clipped leaf from each plant was cut into four pieces and each piece was placed into an well with one second-ktstar larvae of Heliothis yirescens (tobacco budworra). Larval mortality (%M) was recorded 96 hours after sampling. The percentage of leaf feeding (%FF) was also recorded. Consumption of the leaf in the well was reported as 0 - 100% (0 equals no feeding). Results are listed in Table P.<br>
