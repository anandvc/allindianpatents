                                          [See Section l0 and RULE 13]<br>
"MOTOR-ASSISTED DRIVE UNIT FOR MOTOR-ASSISTED VEHICLE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br><br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
[Detailed  Description  of   the   Invention]<br>
[00-01]<br>
[Technical Field to Which the Invention Pertains]<br>
The present invention relates to a motor-assisted drive unit for a motor-assisted vehicle, and particularly to a motor-assisted drive unit for a motor-assisted vehicle, which assist unit is significantly small-sized and thereby suitable for a motor-assisted vehicle having only a small space for mounting the motor-assisted drive unit.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
A vehicle such as a bicycle, characterized by detecting a manual drive torque, that is, a leg-power, and biasing a power assist source (DC motor) connected to a drive system in accordance with the detected leg-power, thereby assisting the leg-power, has been conventionally proposed.  One example of a drive unit including such a power assist source, that is, a motor-assisted drive unit has been disposed, for example, in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 11-5584.  The drive unit is disposed at the back of a crank shaft and its neighborhood, wherein a<br><br>
controller casing for housing a controller including electronic parts (power transistor, CPU, and the like) for driving the motor, and a the controller casing projects downwardly from a motor casing for housing the motor. [0003]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The prior art drive unit, which includes the controller casing projecting downwardly from the motor casing, has a problem that it is large-sized.  Further, the prior art drive unit has not taken into account the miniaturization thereof. [0004]<br>
An object of the present invention is to solve the above-described problems of the prior art drive unit and to provide a motor-assisted drive unit for a motor-assisted vehicle, which is made as small in size as possible. [0005]<br>
[Means for solving the Problem]<br>
To achieve the above object, according to a first feature of the present invention, there is provided a motor-assisted drive unit for a motor-assisted vehicle, including a motor as a power assist source housed in a<br><br>
casing, characterized by including a control board on which control devices of the motor are mounted; wherein the control board is provided in the casing in such a manner as to be disposed in the direction nearly-perpendicular to the motor shaft of the motor; and at least part of the control board extends, as seen along the axial direction of the motor, to a position at which it is overlapped to the motor. With this feature, since part of the control board is overlapped to the motor, as seen along the axial direction of the motor, the motor-assisted drive unit can be made as small in size as possible, and since the area of the control board extends to a position at which it is overlapped to the motor, the inner space of the casing can be made effectively used. [0006]<br>
According to a second feature of the present invention, a CPU as one of the control devices of the motor is mounted on a portion, overlapped to the motor, of the control board in such a manner as to project in a gap between the overlapped portion of the control board and the motor. With this feature, it is possible to dispose a CPU having a relatively large mounting area in the conventional dead space. [0007]<br><br>
According to a third feature of the present invention, there is provided a motor-assisted drive unit for a motor-assisted vehicle, including a motor as a power assist source housed in a casing, characterized by-including a first control board and a second control board on each of which control devices of the motor are mounted; wherein the first and second control boards are disposed in the casing in such a manner as to extend in the direction nearly perpendicular to the motor shaft of the motor; and the second control board is overlapped, as seen along the axial direction of the motor, to part of the first control board.  With this feature, since the second control board is overlapped to part of the first control board, as seen from the axial direction of the motor, the motor-assisted drive unit can be made small in size as possible.  Further, control devices mounted on the first and second control boards can be efficiently disposed in consideration of the correlation between the control devices, and the first and second control boards can be disposed in the casing without occurrence of a dead space. [0008]<br>
According to a fourth feature of the present invention, control devices, typically, a CPU, a capacitor,<br><br>
and a relay are mounted on the first control board, and a FET is mounted on the second control board. With this feature, since the control devices being small in heat generation, such as the CPU, capacitor, and relay, and the control devices being large in heat generation, such as the FET are mounted on the first and second control boards separated from each other, respectively, it is possible to prevent the heat generated from the FET from being directly transferred to the control devices such as the CPU, capacitor, and relay. [0009]<br>
According to a fifth feature of the present invention, the first control board is configured as a printed wiring board, and the second control board is configured as a light metal board.  Also, according to a sixth feature of the present invention, the second control board is directly attached to the inner wall surface of the casing, and the first control board is disposed over the second control board with a specific gap put therebetween. With these features, it is possible to easily transfer the heat, which is generated from the FET and the like mounted on the second control board, to the casing via the light metal board, and to prevent the first control board from being affected by the above heat<br><br>
as much as possible. [0010]<br>
According to a seventh feature of the present invention, the control board is elastically supported on the casing; according to an eighth feature of the present invention, the control board is elastically supported by using a vibration-proof rubber disposed around a casing boss portion for rotatably supporting the motor shaft of the motor; and according to a ninth feature of the present invention, the vibration-proof rubber is compressed between the control board and a motor supporting portion of the casing. With these features, vibration of the vehicle generated during running is less transmitted to the control board, to stabilize the operation of the electric parts mounted on the control board, thereby prolonging the service life of the electric parts. [0011]<br>
According to a tenth feature of the present invention, the control devices of the motor are mounted on both surfaces of the control board; a semiconductor device and a board having a good thermal conductivity at least part of which is in contact with the semiconductor device are provided on the surface, on the casing side,<br><br>
of the control board; and the board having a good thermal conductivity is in contact with the casing. With this configuration, it is possible to effectively transfer heat generated from the semiconductor device by a simple, inexpensive structure.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a motor-assisted drive unit for a motor-assisted vehicle, comprising a motor as a power assist source housed in a casing, wherein said motor-assisted drive unit has a first control board and a second control board on each of which control devices of said motor are mounted; wherein said first and second control boards are disposed in said casing in such a manner as to extend in the direction perpendicular to a motor shaft of said motor; wherein said second control board is overlapped, as seen along the axial direction of said motor, with part of said first control board; wherein the first control board has a hole centered at the motor shaft for insertion of said motor shaft; and wherein said second control board has a first region overlapped with the motor, characterised in that said second control board has a second region not overlapped with the motor, wherein said first region is smaller than said second region.<br><br>

[0019]<br>
A battery residual amount meter 200 including an operational switch 201 and five light emitting diodes 202 is provided on the upper surface of the battery 2. When the operational switch 201 is depressed by a driver, the battery residual mount is expressed by lighting of the light emitting diodes 202.  If the residual amount of the battery is sufficient, the five light emitting diodes 202 are all turned on, and as the residual amount of the battery becomes small, the light emitting diodes are turned off one by one in the arrangement order from top to bottom.  A wire is laid out from the upper to the lower portion of a battery main body 210 along the outer side surface of the battery main body 210.  A fuse 211 is inserted at a midpoint of the wire and a charging coupler 212 is connected to the lower end of the wire.  Fig. 10 shows a side surface of the battery on the seat post 71 side. When the battery 2 is inserted in a battery holder 87, the charging coupler 212 faces to the side surface of the battery 2 on the seat post 71 side. [0020]<br>

[0032]<br>
The drive motor 21 having a shaft parallel to the crank shaft 83 is housed in the second housing 99, and is fixedly supported by the first casing half 95.  The output from the drive motor 2 is transmitted to the drive (motor-assisted) sprocket 84 via a roller type speed reducer 100, a reduction gear train 101, and a second one-way clutch 102 in order to assist the leg-power applied to the pedals 79. [0033]<br>
Referring particularly to Fig. 2, the roller type speed reducer 100 includes a motor shaft 103 of the drive<br><br>
motor 21; a bowl type outer ring 85 surrounding the motor shaft 103; and a plurality of (three, in this embodiment) reduction rollers 104, 105 and 106 allowed to roll in contact with the outer surface of the motor shaft 103 and the inner surface of the outer ring 85.  The roller type speed reducer 100 functions to silently reduce the assisting power from the drive motor 21 and transmitted the reduced power to the reduction gear train 101 side. [0034]<br>

On the other hand, a cylindrical second bearing portion 109 corresponding to the leading end of the output shaft 115 is provided in the second casing half 96.  The leading end of the output shaft 115 is rotatably supported by the second bearing portion 109 via the ball bearing 110.<br><br>
[0035]<br>
The reduction rollers 104, 105 and 106 are rotatably supported by roller shafts 111, 112 and 113 via needle bearings 116, 117 and 118, respectively.  One end of each of the roller shafts 111, 112, and 113 is supported by the first casing half 95, and the other end thereof is supported by a supporting plate 119.  The supporting plate 119 is fastened, by means of screw members 121, on bosses 120 integrally provided on the first casing half 95 in such a manner as to be each located between the reduction rollers 104, 105, and 106. [0036]<br>
Of the reduction rollers 104, 105 and 106, each of the reduction rollers 104 and 105 is supported by the left side first casing half 95 and the supporting plate 119 in such a manner that the position thereof along the circumferential direction of the motor shaft 103 is fixed. A fitting hole 122 with its bottom closed, to which one end of each of the roller shafts 111 and 112 of the reduction rollers 104 and 105 is fitted, is provided in the first casing half 95. [0037]<br>
Of the reduction rollers 104, 105 and 106, the reduction roller 106 is supported by the first casing<br><br>
half 95 and the supporting plate 119 in such a manner that the position thereof in the circumferential direction of the motor shaft 103 is changeable within a specific restricted range in order that the reduction roller 106 is cutting into the portion between the motor shaft 103 and the outer ring 85 by frictional engagement with the motor shaft 103 upon rotation of the motor shaft 103. [0038]<br>
A fitting hole 123 with its bottom closed, to which one end of the roller shaft 113 of the reduction roller 106 is to be fitted, is provided in the first casing half 95.  A spring 124 for biasing a pin (not shown) pressing the roller shaft 113 is provided in the fitting hole 123. The reduction roller 106 is biased by the spring 124 in the direction in which it is cutting into the portion between the motor shaft 103 and the outer ring 85. [0039]<br>
Of the reduction rollers 104, 105 and 106, the reduction rollers 104 and 106 have the same outside diameter, while the reduction roller 105 has an outside diameter larger than that of the reduction rollers 104 and 106.  The axial line of the output shaft 115 is eccentric from that of the motor shaft 103.<br><br>
[0040]<br>
With this roller type speed reducer 120, when the motor shaft 103 is rotated in the direction 125 shown in Fig. 2 in accordance with the operation of the drive motor 21, the reduction roller 106 is cutting into the portion between the motor shaft 103 and the outer ring 85, thereby functioning as a wedge therebetween.  As a result, the contact surface pressure of each of the reduction rollers 104, 105 and 106 between the motor shaft 103 and the outer ring 85 is increased, so that the output torque from the drive motor 21 is transmitted from the motor shaft 103 to the output shaft 115 via the reduction rollers 104, 105 and 106 and the outer ring 85.  In this case, the motor shaft 103 is restricted in the three directions by the reduction rollers 104, 105 and 106 surrounding the motor shaft 103, and thereby a force proportional to the drive torque of the drive motor 21 acts between each of the reduction rollers 104, 105 and 106 and the motor shaft 103.  As a result, it is possible to damp vibration generated from the drive motor 21 by the roller type speed reducer 100. [0041]<br>
The reduction gear train 101 includes a drive gear 126 as a power transmission portion and a driven gear 127<br><br>
meshed with the drive gear 126.  The drive gear 126 is integrally provided to the output shaft 115 at a position between the second bearing portion 109 of the second casing half 96 and the outer ring 85. [0042]<br>
In the roller type speed reducer 100, the motor shaft 103 is supported by the first bearing portion 107 of the first casing half 95 via the ball bearing 108, and the output shaft 115 is supported in a cantilever manner by the second bearing portion 109 of the second casing half 96 via the ball bearing 110.  In this case, a length LA from the center of the ball bearing 108 and the axial center of each of the reduction rollers 104, 105 and 106 is set to be twice or more as large as an outer diameter DA of a contact portion, with each of the reduction rollers 104, 105 and 106, of the motor shaft 103 (LA&gt;DAX2); and a length LB from the axial center of each of the reduction rollers 104, 105 and 106 and the axial center of the ball bearing 110 is set to be one-half or more as large as an inside diameter DB of the outer ring 85 (LB&gt;DBxl/2) . [0043]<br>
With this dimensional setting, the supporting length of the motor shaft 113 from the ball bearing 108<br><br>
and the cantilever supporting length of the output shaft 115 from the ball bearing 110 are suitably set, respectively so that even if the assembling accuracy of the motor shaft 103 with each of the reduction rollers 104, 105 and 106 of the roller type speed reducer 100 is relatively roughly set, the effect of such setting is minimized at the meshed portion of the driven gear 127 with the drive gear 126 of the output shaft 115. [0044]<br>
The driven gear 127 of the reduction gear train 101 is disposed in such a manner as to coaxially surround a rotation drive shaft 128.  The rotation drive shaft 128 is rotatably supported by the second casing half 96 via a ball bearing 129, and also rotatably supported by the first casing half 95 via a ball bearing 130.  The drive sprocket 84 is fixed to an end portion, projecting from the second casing half 96, of the rotation drive shaft 128. [0045]<br>
A ball bearing 131 and a second one-way clutch 102 are provided between the rotation drive shaft 128 and the driven gear 127.  The second one-way clutch 102 has a clutch outer ring 132 integrally provided on the driven gear 127, and a clutch inner ring 133 integrally provided<br><br>
on the rotation drive shaft 128.  The second one-way clutch 102 has the same structure as that of the first one-way clutch 41.  The second one-way clutch 102 permits, as the drive motor 21 is operated, the transmission of a torque generated by the drive motor 21 and reduced by the roller type speed reducer 100 and the reduction gear train 101 to the rotation drive shaft 128, that is, the drive sprocket 84; but permits, when the operation of the drive motor 21 is stopped, idling of the rotation drive shaft 109 in order not to obstruct the rotation of the drive sprocket 69 due to the leg-power applied to the pedals 79.  A hanger portion 134 formed on the casing 94 is fastened to the bracket 93 fixed to the down pipe 69. [0046]<br>
Referring particularly to Fig. 3, a control unit for controlling the operation of the drive motor 21 is housed in the second housing 99 on the left (in Fig. 3), rear side from the drive shaft 21.  The control unit has a first control board 136 mounted on the inner wall of the first casing half 95 by means of mounting members 151a, 151b, and 151c, and a second control board 135 mounted on the first casing half 95 with a specific gap put between the first control board 136 and the same.  The second control board 135 is overlapped to a portion of the first<br><br>
control board 136.  The gap between the first and second control boards 136 and 135 is ensured by collars 142 and 143 in which bolts are inserted. [0047]<br>
The first control board 136, which is preferably configured as a printed wiring board, has an area extending from the inner peripheral wall of the first casing half 95 to the periphery of the first bearing portion 107.  In other words, the first control board 136 has an area extending to a position at which it is overlapped to the motor 21, as seen from the axial direction A of the drive motor 21.  Control devices such as a CPU 20, a capacitor 29, and relay 30 are mounted on the first control board 136.  In order to effective use of a space on the first control board 136, the CPU having a low height and a large area is disposed in the gap between a portion, overlapped to the drive motor 21, of the first control board 136 and the drive motor 21. [0048]<br>
The second control board 135, which may be configured as a light metal board having a good thermal conductivity, preferably, an aluminum board, is directly attached on the inner wall surface of the first casing half 95.  Devices such as a FET 27 and a diode 28 are<br><br>
mounted on the second control board 135 while being put between the first control board 136 and the second control board 135.  The heat generated from these devices are transferred to the first casing half 95 via the second control board 135.  Accordingly, it is possible to effectively prevent the above devices from being heated at high temperatures. [0049]<br>
Another configuration example of the control unit will be described with reference to Figs. 11 and 12.  Fig. 11 is a partial sectional side view of a motor 21 portion and its neighborhood of the motor-assisted drive unit; and Fig. 12 is a view, seen along the direction A, of the motor 21 portion and its neighborhood shown in Fig. 11, in a state in which the motor 21 is removed. [0050]<br>
A first control board 136 such as a printed wiring board is disposed on a plane behind the motor 21 and perpendicular to the motor shaft as seen along the direction A of Fig. 11 in such a manner as to be in proximity to the motor 21.  The first control board 136 has a circular hole centered at the motor shaft, and a motor shaft supporting portion 300 as a case boss portion having a circular cross - section is inserted in the<br><br>
circular hole.  An annular vibration-proof rubber ring 301 is mounted between the inner periphery of the circular hole and the outer periphery of the motor shaft supporting portion 300 in a state being elastically, largely compressed therebetween.<br>
[0051]<br>
Like the configuration example (see Figs. 1 and 3), the capacitor 29, relay 30, and the like are mounted on the surface of a portion, not overlapped to the motor 21, of the first control board 136, and a part having a low height and a relatively large area, such as the CPU 20<br>
(not shown), is mounted on the surface of a portion, overlapped to the motor 21, of the first control board 136. A second control board 302 configured as a light metal board having a good thermal conductivity, for example, an aluminum board is supported on the back surface of a portion of the first control board 136 in such a manner as to be overlapped thereto.  A central portion of the second control board 302 is mounted to the inner wall surface of the first casing half 95 (see Fig. 1) with one screw 303.  An insertion hole 304 in which a tool for turning the screw 303 is to be inserted is formed in the first control boar 136 at a position facing to the screw 303.<br><br>
[0052]<br>
The devices such as the FET 27 and diode 28 are mounted on the back surface of the first control board 136 in such a manner as to be put in a space between the second control board 302 and the same.  The upper surfaces of these devices are in contact with the second control board 302. Accordingly, the heat generated from the devices such as the FET 27 and the diode 28 is transferred to the first casing half 95 via the second control board 302, and therefore, these devices can be effectively prevented from being heated at high temperatures. [0053]<br>
A speed sensor 145 for sensing a magnetic body 144 provided on the driven gear 127 thereby detecting the rotational speed of the driven gear 127 is mounted on the back surface, opposite to the aluminum board 135, of the first casing half 95. [0054]<br>
When the pedals 79 are manually actuated in the drive direction, the inner ring 42 fixed to the clutch shaft 83 is rotated, and the rotation is transmitted to the ratchet teeth 46 via the ratchet claws 44.  The rotation of the transmission plate 40 is transmitted to<br>
I<br><br>
the drive sprocket 80 via the compression coil springs 56; however, since a load is applied to the drive sprocket 80, the rotation of the transmission plate 40 is not immediately transmitted to the drive sprocket 80.  The compression coil springs 56 are first deflected depending on the load applied thereto, and when the deflection of the compression coil springs 56 is balanced against the load, the drive sprocket 80 is rotated.  In this way, the transmission plate 40 and the drive sprocket 80 are rotated while being offset from each other in the rotational direction depending on the load, to give a drive force to the rear wheel via the chain 82 .  The load applied to the drive sprocket 80 is detected as a force generated when the pedals 79 are actuated by a driver, that is, a leg-power. [0055]<br>
Since the projection 48 projecting from the sensor portion 1 of the leg-power detector is rotated together with the transmission plate 40, the positional relationship between the leg-power transmission ring (inner ring) 5 supporting the projection 48 and the outer ring 2 fixed to the drive sprocket 80 is determined depending on the leg-power.  The positional relationship is detected by the sensor portion 1, and is supplied to a<br><br>
control unit (not shown) for detecting the leg-power. [0056]<br>
When the pedals 79 are actuated in the direction reversed to the drive direction, or when the actuation of the pedals 79 is stopped during running of the vehicle, the engagement between the ratchet claws 44 and the ratchet teeth 46 is released, and accordingly, the drive sprocket 80 is not rotated, or during running, the drive sprocket 80 is rotated independently from the crank shaft 83 . [0057]<br>
As described above, according to this embodiment, since the board on which the control devices of the motor are mounted is, as seen along the axial direction of the motor, disposed in such a manner as to extend in the direction perpendicular to the motor shaft and to be partially overlapped to the motor, it is possible to eliminate the need of housing the control board in a casing projecting downwardly from a motor casing as the prior art drive unit, and hence to make the size of the motor-assisted drive unit as small as possible.  Further, since the second control board is overlapped to the first control board, as seen along the axial direction of the motor, it is possible to further miniaturize the motor-<br><br>
assisted drive unit. [0058]<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
As described above, according to the inventions described in claims 1 to 6, since the board on which the &gt; control devices of the motor are mounted is, as seen along the axial direction of the motor, disposed in such a manner as to extend in the direction perpendicular to the motor shaft and to be partially overlapped to the motor, it is possible to make the size of the motor-assisted drive unit as small as possible.  In addition to the above effect, the inventions described in claims 1 to 6 exhibits the following effects. [0059]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 1, since the control board on which the control devices of the motor are mounted extends, as seen along the axial direction of the motor, to a position at which it is overlapped to the motor, it is possible to dispose the control board having a large area in the casing, and to effectively use the inner space of the casing. [0060]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 2, it is possible to dispose the CPU having a relatively large<br><br>
mounting area in a space behind the motor, which has been regarded as the dead space, and hence to increase the degree of freedom in arrangement of the control devices to be mounted on the control board, other than the CPU.<br>
[0061]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 3, since the second control board is overlapped to part of the first control board, as seen from the axial direction of the motor, the motor-assisted drive unit can be more miniaturized.  Further, control devices mounted on the first and second control boards can be efficiently disposed in consideration of the correlation between the control devices, and the first and second control boards can be disposed in the casing without occurrence of a dead space.<br>
[0062]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 4, since the control devices being small in heat generation, such as the CPU, capacitor, and relay, and the FET being large in heat generation are mounted on the boards separated from each other, it is possible to prevent the heat generated from the FET from being directly transferred to the control devices such as the CPU, capacitor, and relay.<br><br>
According to the inventions described in claims 5 and 6, it is possible to efficiently transfer the heat, which is generated from the FET and the like mounted on the second control board, to the casing via the light metal board, and since the first control board is disposed over the second control board with a specific gap put therebetween, it is possible to prevent the first control board from being affected by the above heat as much as possible. [0064]<br>
According to the inventions described in claims 7, 8 and 9, vibration of the vehicle generated during running is less transmitted to the control board, to stabilize the operation of the electric parts mounted on the control board, thereby prolonging the service life of the electric parts. [0065]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 10,<br>
it is possible to effectively transfer heat generated<br>
from the semiconductor device by a simple, inexpensive<br>
structure. <br>
