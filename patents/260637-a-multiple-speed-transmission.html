MULTI-SPEED TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS-REFFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/912,764 filed on April 19, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a multiple speed transmission<br>
having a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting<br>
devices and more particularly to a transmission having eight or more speeds,<br>
four planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multiple speed transmission uses a combination of<br>
friction clutches, planetary gear arrangements and fixed interconnections to<br>
achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical arrangement of the<br>
planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging, cost and desired speed<br>
ratios.<br>

Attorney Docket No. P001270-PTT-DLT<br>
[0005] While current transmissions achieve their intended purpose, the<br>
need for new and improved transmission configurations which exhibit improved<br>
performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency, responsiveness and<br>
smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced size and weight, is<br>
essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved, cost-effective,<br>
compact multiple speed transmission.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0027] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0028] At the outset, it should be appreciated that the embodiments of<br>
the transmission of the present invention have an arrangement of permanent<br>
mechanical connections between the elements of the four planetary gear sets.<br>
These mechanical connections generically link or relate the transmission<br>
embodiments. More specifically, a first component or element of a first planetary<br>
gear set is permanently coupled to a ground or a transmission housing. A<br>
second component or element of the first planetary gear set is permanently<br>
coupled to a second component or element of a second planetary gear set. A<br>
first component or element of the second planetary gear set is permanently<br>
coupled to a first component or element of a third planetary gear set. A second<br>
component or element of the third planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a<br>
second component or element of a fourth planetary gear set. A third component<br>
or element of the first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a third<br>
component or element of the fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0029] Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of an eight speed<br>
transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a<br>
schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device such as an<br>
automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary gear set<br>
wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear are each<br>
represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes: one for<br>
9<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001270-PTT-DLT<br>
the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one for the ring gear. The<br>
relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the<br>
ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever ratios, in turn, are used<br>
to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve an appropriate<br>
ratios and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or interconnections between<br>
the nodes of the various planetary gear sets are illustrated by thin, horizontal<br>
lines and torque transmitting devices such as clutches and brakes are presented<br>
as interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is<br>
grounded. Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams<br>
can be found in SAE Paper 810102, "The Lever Analogy: A New Tool in<br>
Transmission Analysis" by Benford and Leising which is hereby fully incorporated<br>
by reference.<br>
[0030] The transmission 10 includes an input shaft or member 12, a<br>
first planetary gear set 14 having three nodes: a first node 14A, a second node<br>
14B and a third node 14C, a second planetary gear set 16 having three nodes: a<br>
first node 16A, a second node 16B and a third node 16C, a third planetary gear<br>
set 18 having three nodes: a first node 18A, a second node 18B and a third node<br>
18C, a fourth planetary gear set 20 having three nodes: a first node 20A, a<br>
second node 20B and a third node 20C and an output shaft or member 22.<br>
[0031] The first node 14A of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to<br>
ground, a stationary element or the transmission housing 50. The second node<br>
14B of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to the first node 20A of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set 20. The third node 14C of the first planetary gear set 14 is<br>
10<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001270-PTT-DLT<br>
coupled to first node 16A of the second planetary gear set 16. The third node<br>
16C of the second planetary gear set 16 is coupled to third node 18C of the third<br>
planetary gear set 18. The first node 18A of the third planetary gear set 18 is<br>
coupled to the third node 20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20. The second<br>
node 16B of the second planetary gear set 16 is coupled to the input shaft or<br>
member 12.<br>
[0032] A first clutch 26 selectively connects the second node 16B of<br>
the second planetary gear set 16 to the first node 18A of the third planetary gear<br>
set 18. A second clutch 28 selectively connects the third node 16C of the second<br>
planetary gear set 16 and the third node 18C of the third planetary gear set 18 to<br>
the first node 18A of the third planetary gear set 18. A third clutch 30 selectively<br>
connects the second node 18B of the third planetary gear set 18 to the output<br>
shaft or member 22. A fourth clutch 32 selectively connects the second node<br>
20B of the fourth planetary gear set 20 to the output shaft or member 22. A<br>
brake 34 selectively connects the third node 14C of the first planetary gear set 14<br>
to the ground, stationary element or transmission housing 50.<br>
[0033] Referring now to FIG. 2, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 according to the<br>
present invention. In FIG. 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of FIG. 1 is<br>
carried over. The clutches, brake and couplings are correspondingly presented<br>
whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as components of<br>
planetary gear sets such as sun gears, ring gears, planet gears and planet gear<br>
carriers.<br>
11<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001270-PTT-DLT<br>
[0034] For example, the first planetary gear set 14 includes a sun gear<br>
member 14C, a planet gear carrier member 14B that rotatably supports a set of<br>
planet gears 14D and a ring gear member 14A. Planet gears 14D are each<br>
configured to intermesh with both sun gear member 14C and ring gear member<br>
14A. Sun gear member 14C is connected for common rotation with a first<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 46 and a second interconnecting shaft or<br>
member 52. Ring gear member 14A is connected to the ground, stationary<br>
element or transmission housing 50 through a third interconnecting shaft or<br>
member 47. The planet gear carrier member 14B is connected for common<br>
rotation with a fourth interconnecting shaft or member 48.<br>
[0035] The input shaft or member 12 is preferably continuously<br>
connected to an engine (not shown) or to a turbine of a torque converter (not<br>
shown). The output shaft or member 22 is preferably continuously connected<br>
with the final drive unit or transfer case (not shown).<br>
[0036] Planetary gear set 16 includes a sun gear member 16A, a<br>
planet carrier member 16B that rotatably supports a set of planet gears 16D and<br>
a ring gear member 16C. Sun gear member 16A is connected for common<br>
rotation with second interconnecting shaft or member 52. Planet carrier member<br>
16B is connected for common rotation with input shaft or member 12 and a fifth<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 54. Ring gear member 16C is connected for<br>
common rotation with a sixth interconnecting shaft or member 56. Planet gears<br>
16D are each configured to intermesh with both sun gear member 16A and ring<br>
gear member 16C.<br>
12<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001270-PTT-DLT<br>
[0037] Planetary gear set 18 includes a sun gear member 18C, a ring<br>
gear member 18A and a planet carrier member 18B that rotatably supports a set<br>
of planet gears 18D. Sun gear member 18C is connected for common rotation<br>
with sixth interconnecting shaft or member 56. Ring gear member 18A is<br>
connected for common rotation with a seventh interconnecting shaft or member<br>
58 and a ninth interconnecting shaft or member 59. Planet carrier member 18B<br>
is connected for common rotation with an eighth interconnecting shaft or member<br>
60. Planet gears 18D are each configured to intermesh with both sun gear<br>
member 18C and ring gear member 18A.<br>
[0038] Planetary gear set 20 includes a sun gear member 20C, a ring<br>
gear member 20A and a planet carrier member 20B that rotatably supports a set<br>
of planet gears 20D. Sun gear member 20C is connected for common rotation<br>
with ninth interconnecting shaft or member 59. Ring gear member 20A is<br>
connected for common rotation with fourth interconnecting shaft or member 48.<br>
Planet carrier member 20B is connected for common rotation with a tenth<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 62. Planet gears 20D are each configured to<br>
intermesh with both sun gear member 20C and ring gear member 20A.<br>
[0039] The torque-transmitting mechanisms or clutches 26, 28, 30, 32<br>
and brake 34 allow for selective interconnection of the shafts or interconnecting<br>
members, members of the planetary gear sets and the housing. For example,<br>
first clutch 26 is selectively engageable to connect ring gear member 18A and<br>
seventh interconnecting shaft or member 58 to fifth interconnecting shaft or<br>
member 54. Second clutch 28 is selectively engageable to connect seventh<br>
13<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001270-PTT-DLT<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 58 to sixth interconnecting shaft or member 56.<br>
Third clutch 30 is selectively engageable to connect output shaft or member 22 to<br>
eighth interconnecting shaft or member 60. Fourth clutch 32 is selectively<br>
engageable to connect tenth interconnecting shaft or member 62 to output shaft<br>
or member 22. Brake 34 is selectively engageable to connect first<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 46 to transmission housing 50 to restrict rotation<br>
of first interconnecting shaft or member 46 relative to transmission housing 50.<br>
[0040] Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, the operation of the<br>
embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 will be described. It will be<br>
appreciated that transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the input<br>
shaft or member 12 to the output shaft or member 22 in at least eight forward<br>
speed or torque ratios and at least one reverse speed or torque ratio. Each<br>
forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of one or<br>
more of the torque-transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first clutch 26, second clutch<br>
28, third clutch 30, fourth clutch 32 and brake 34), as will be explained below.<br>
FIG. 3 is a truth table presenting the various combinations of torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms that are activated or engaged to achieve the various gear states.<br>
Actual numerical gear ratios of the various gear states are also presented<br>
although it should be appreciated that these numerical values are exemplary only<br>
and that they may be adjusted over significant ranges to accommodate various<br>
applications and operational criteria of the transmission 10. Examples of the gear<br>
ratios that may be obtained using the embodiments of the present invention are<br>
14<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001270-PTT-DLT<br>
also shown in FIG. 3. Of course, other gear ratios are achievable depending on<br>
the gear diameter, gear teeth count and gear configuration selected.<br>
[0041] To establish reverse gear, third clutch 30, fourth clutch 32 and<br>
brake 34 are engaged or activated. Third clutch 30 connects output shaft or<br>
member 22 to eighth interconnecting shaft or member 60. Fourth clutch 32<br>
connects output shaft or member 22 to tenth interconnecting shaft or member 62.<br>
Brake 34 connects first interconnecting shaft or member 46 to transmission<br>
housing 50 to restrict rotation of first interconnecting shaft or member 46 and sun<br>
gear 14C relative to transmission housing 50. Likewise, the eight forward ratios<br>
are achieved through different combinations of clutch and brake engagement, as<br>
shown in FIG. 3.<br>
1<br>
[0042] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the eight speed transmission 10 assumes, first of all, that all<br>
the clutches and the brake not specifically referenced in a given gear state are<br>
inactive or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e., changes of<br>
gear state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake engaged or<br>
activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
[0043] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
