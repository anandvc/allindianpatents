The nuts 75 ... penetrate through elastic members 93 *.♦ fitted to the front portion fitting portions 73 ... so as to be intermediately disposed between the stays 73 ... and the front portion fitting portions 73 ..., and bolts 76 ... penetrating through washers 94 ... clamping parts of the elastic members 93 ... between them and the front portion fitting portions 73 .„ are mated with and fastened to the nuts 75 •„, whereby intermediate portions in the front-rear direction of the rear side covers 38L, 38R are elastically supported on a rear portion of the vehicle body frame F.<br>
In Fig. 12, rear portion fitting portions 77, 77 are integrally provided at the upper ends of rear portions of the rear side covers 38L, 38R. The rear portion fitting portions 77, 77 are co-fastened to the tall frame 22 connecting between rear portions of the rear frames 14, 14, together with a grab rail 79 by pairs of bolts 78, 78 ....<br>
The tandem seat 26 is disposed at upper portions of the rear side covers 38L, 38R, and is tiltably connected to the upper ends of front portions of the rear side covers 38L, 38R through a hinge 80 (See Fig. 4).<br>
Referring to Fig. 13 also, at least parts of the left-right pair of rear side covers 38L, 38R, in this embodiment lower end portions of front portions of the rear side covers 38L, 38R, are overlapped with each other on the lower side of a front portion of the tandem seat 26.<br>
Namely, a lower end portion of a front portion of<br><br>
the right-side rear side cover 38R is overlapped with the lower end of a front portion of the left-side rear side cover 38L from the front side; at the overlapped portion, the right-side rear side cover 38R is provided with an insertion hole 80, and a clip nut 82 having a screw hole 81 smaller in diameter than the insertion hole 80 is fitted in the insertion hole 80 so that the screw hole 81 is coaxially communicated with the insertion hole 80.<br>
The left-side rear side cover 38L is overlapped with the right-side rear side cover 38R, with a portion of the clip nut 82 therebetween, and the left-side rear side cover 38L is provided with an insertion hole 83 larger in diameter than the screw hole 81, coaxially with the screw hole 81.<br>
A rear portion of the rear upper cover 36 is so formed as to cover the overlapped portions of the rear side covers 38L, 38R from the front side, and the rear portion of the rear upper cover 36 is provided with an insertion hole 84 corresponding to the insertion hole 83. The rear portion of the rear upper cover 36 so disposed as to cover the overlapped portions of the rear side covers 38L, 38R from the front side is fastened to the overlapped portions of the rear side covers 38L, 38R by mating and fastening a screw member 85 inserted through the insertion holes 83, 84 to the screw hole 81.<br>
The screw member 85 integrally and coaxially comprises a screw shaft portion 85a to be mated with the<br><br>
screw hole 81, a large diameter shaft portion 85b having a length corresponding to the thickness of the overlapped portions of the left-side rear side cover 38L and the rear upper cover 36 and a diameter larger than that of the screw shaft portion 85a and inserted through the insertion holes 83, 84, and an enlarged diameter head portion 85c to be engaged with the outside surface of the rear upper cover 36f so that an excessive fastening load is prevented from acting on the overlapped portions of the left-side rear side cover 38L and the rear upper cover 36.<br>
Meanwhile, the outside surfaces of the rear side covers 38L, 38R are each demarcated into non-coated zones Zl, Z2 and a coated zone Z3.<br>
Namely, portions of the rear side covers 38L, 38R located on the lower side of a front half portion of the tandem seat 26 are each set as the first non-coated zone Zl, and the lower end portions of front portions of the rear side covers 38L, 38R on the upper side of the foot steps 18 are each set as the second non-coated zone Z2. These non-coated zones Zl, Z2 remain as skin layers without any coating after molding of the rear side covers 38L, 38R, and if required, they may be provided in the molding step with a grain pattern 86 (hatched in Figs, 1 to 3) consisting of minute recesses and projections for ensuring that scratches and stains thereon will not be conspicuous.<br>
On the other hand, the coated zone Z3 other than the first and second non-coated zones Zl, Z2 occupies most part<br><br>
of the outside surfaces of the rear side covers 38L, 38R, and the non - coated zones Z1, Z 2 are exposed on the upper side and the lower side of a front portion of the coated zone Z3, with the coated zone Z3 therebetween.<br>
Demarcation of the outside surfaces of the rear side covers 38L, 38R into the non-coated zones Zl, Z2 and the coated zone Z3 is conducted by molding molded bodies of the rear side covers 38L, 38R using a coloring material in the molding material, then masking the portions corresponding to the non-coated zones Zl, Z2, coating the residual portion, namely, the portion corresponding to the coated zone Z3 with a paint of an appropriate main color, and thereafter the mask is removed. By this, the non-coated zones Zl, Z2 remaining as the skin layer having the grain pattern 86 are exposed.<br>
Next, the action or effect of this embodiment will be described. In the vehicle body cover 30 covering the vehicle body, at least one part of the upper ends of front portions (in this embodiment, the whole parts of the upper ends * of front portions) of the left-right pair of main frame side covers 31L, 31R supported on the vehicle body frame F while covering both lateral sides of the main frame 13 are overlapped with each other on the rear side of the head pipe 12, and a front portion of the upper cover 34 covering the upper side of the main frame 13 is fastened to the overlapped portions of the main frame side covers 31L, 31R.<br><br>
Therefore, a stay for fitting at least the front portion of the upper cover 34 to the side of the vehicle body frame F is unnecessary, the number of stays to be provided on the vehicle body frame F is reduced, hence the number of component parts can be reduced, and stays which would reduce the degree of freedom in laying out cables such as a throttle cable 95 and a carburetor choke cable 96 (See Fig. 4) in the vicinity of the head pipe 12 are eliminated, thereby facilitating the layout of the cables and the like. In addition, appearance can be enhanced by good matching of the upper ends of the front portions of the left-right pair of main frame side covers 31L, 31R and the front portion of the upper cover 34,<br>
Besides, the upper ends of the front portions of the main frame side covers 31L, 31R are engaged with each other so as to maintain the overlapped condition of the main frame side covers 31L, 31R; therefore, at the time of fastening the front portion of the upper cover 34 to the overlapped portions of the main frame side covers 31L, 31R, the fastening work can be facilitated by maintaining the overlapped conditions of the main frame side covers 31L, 31R, and the fastened condition of the upper ends of the front portions of the main frame side covers 31L, 31R and the front portion of the upper cover 34 can be made rigid.<br>
In addition, the upper side of the fastened portions of the upper portions of the main frame side covers 31L, 31R onto the main frame 13 is covered by the upper cover 34,<br><br>
so that the fastened portions of the upper portions of the main frame side covers 31L, 31R onto the main frame 13 are hidden by the upper cover 3 4, whereby appearance can be enhanced.<br>
The left-right pair of rear side covers 38L, 38R covering both sides of a rear portion of the vehicle body frame F on the lower side of the tandem seat 26 are supported by the vehicle body frame F, at least parts of the front portions (in this embodiment, the lower ends of the front portions) of the rear side covers 38L, 38R are overlapped with each other on the lower side of a front portion of the tandem seat 26, and a rear portion of the upper cover 34 is fastened to the overlapped portions of the rear side covers 38L, 38R.<br>
Therefore, it is unnecessary to provide the vehicle body frame F with a stay for fitting the rear portion of the upper cover 34 to the side of the vehicle body frame F, whereby the number of component parts can be more reduced, and a space for disposing component parts such as electrical equipments can be secured between the rear portion of the upper cover 34 and the vehicle body frame F.<br>
The upper cover 34 is composed of the front upper cover 35 and the rear upper cover 36 disconnectably connected to each other, and a rear portion of the front upper cover 35 is fastened to the main frame side covers 31L, 31R. Therefore, a portion near the center in the front-rear direction of the upper cover 34 can be fixed to<br><br>
the main frame side covers 31L, 31R, and at the time of maintenance of the ignition unit 88 or the like, it is unnecessary to detach the upper cover 34 as a whole; namely, detaching of only the rear upper cover 36 is enabled, whereby maintenance work can be facilitated.<br>
Further, the front portion of the rear upper cover 36 is engaged with the rear portion of the front upper cover 35 while covering the location of fastening of the rear portion of the front upper cover 35 to the main frame side covers 31L, 31R; therefore, the location of fastening of the rear portion of the front upper cover 35 to the main frame side covers 31L, 31R is covered by the rear upper cover 36, whereby appearance can be enhanced, the fitting and detaching of the rear upper cover 36 is facilitated, and maintenance work can be more facilitated.<br>
Incidentally, the outside surfaces of the left-right pair of rear side covers 38L, 38R are each demarcated into the coated zone Z3 and the first and second non-coated zones Zl, Z2. Therefore, without composing each of the rear side covers 38L, 38R of a plurality of cover components, portions of the rear side covers 38L, 38R are set to be non-coated covers, whereby an excellent color effect on a design basis can be obtained while preventing an increase in the number of component parts and contriving a reduction in cost, and it is possible to ensure that scratches and stains will not be conspicuous* In addition, the demarcation between the coated zone Z3 and the non-<br><br>
coated zones Zl, Z2 can be freely changed.<br>
The first non-coated zone Zl is set as the portions of the rear side covers 38L, 38R located on the lower side of a front half portion of the tandem seat 26, while the lower end portions of front portions of the rear side covers 38L, 38R located on the upper side of the foot steps 18 are set as the second non-coated zone Z2, and the non-coated zones Zl, Z2 are provided with the grain pattern 86,<br>
Of the rear side covers 38L, 38R, those portions with which the rider's feet are liable to come into contact are provided with the first and second non-coated zones Zl, Z2. Therefore, even when the rider's feet come into contact with the first and second non-coated zones Zl, Z2 and scratch or stain the non-coated zones Zl, Z2, the color of the rear side covers 38L, 38R is prevented from being changed, and it is possible to ensure that the scratches and stains will hardly be conspicuous*<br>
Further, at the time of getting on and off the tandem seat 26, the rider's feet are liable to come into contact with the outside surface of the front upper cover 35 in the upper cover 34. The outside surface of the front upper cover 35 is maintained in a non-coated condition provided with a grain pattern 86. Therefore, even when the feet come into contact with the outside surface of the front upper cover 35 to scratch or stain the outside surface of the front upper cover 35, the color of the front upper cover 35 is prevented from being changed, and it is<br><br>
possible to ensure that the scratches and stains will hardly be conspicuous. Besides, when the scratches or stains on the outside surface of the front upper cover 35 have become conspicuous, the front upper cover 35 can be easily replaced because the front upper cover 35 can be easily detached from the main frame side covers 31L, 31R.<br>
While the embodiment of the present invention has been described above, the present Invention is not limited to or by the above embodiment, and various design modifications can be made without departure from the present invention as set forth in claims.<br>
For example, while the rear side covers 38L, 38R are each provided with two non-coated zones Zl, Z2 in the above embodiment, three or more non-coated zones may be set on each of the rear side covers 38L, 38R. In addition, while the rear side covers 38L, 38R are formed of a synthetic resin in the above embodiment, the rear side covers may be formed of other material such as metallic sheet,<br><br><br><br>
