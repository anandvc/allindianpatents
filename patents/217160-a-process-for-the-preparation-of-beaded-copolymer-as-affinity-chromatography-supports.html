				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of noveldesivatised <br>
macroporous<br>
beaded crosslinked polymers that are useful iit the preparation as chromatography<br>
supports. The invention more particularly relates to a process for the derivatisation of macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers useful as affinity chromatography supports for purification of enzymes such as penicillinase.<br>
Penicillinase hydrolyses the cyclic amide bond present in penicillins to form corresponding penicilloic acid. The penicilloic acid thus formed does not exhibit any antimicrobial activity. This property enables the use of penicillinase in Sterility Test of sterile penicillin preparations and as a marker enzyme in Enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA). The substrates, inhibitors or their analogues are used as ligands for purification of penicillinase by affinity chromatography.<br>
The use of affinity supports prepared by derivatisation of gels particularly agarose gels are known for purification of penicillinase. The Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Vol 15, p. 229 (1979) describes the use of 6-amino penicillanic acid or 7-amino desacetoxycephalosporanic acid bound to agarose. Current Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy. Vol 1, p. 751, (1982) describes the use of cefotaxime bound to Sepharose 4E. Yet another publication in Journal of Chromatography, Vol 448, p. 109, (1988) describes the use of N-acetyl-D-penicillamine coupled to Sepharose 4B. German Patent No. DD 260,292 (1988) describes the use of aminobenzylpenicillin coupled to macroporous carriers of organic, inorganic or bioorganic material.<br>
The use of aforesaid affinity supports for purification of penicillinase suffers from one or<br><br>
more of the following disadvantages :<br>
Activation by using toxic chemicals like cyanogen bromide, Bed compression, Lower flow rates and Attrition if used in batch mode.<br>
In our copending application No. NF 307/00 we have described and claimed a process for the preparation of macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers. The copolymers have the following properties that are desired for a support for use in affinity chromatography: uniform bead size, resistant to attrition, stable bed volume at varying conditions of pH and ionic strength and presence of built-in glycidyl functional group for binding of ligand molecules. Thus, the macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers described and claimed in our copending application No. NF 307/00 can be derivatised and used as a support in affinity chromatography.<br>
Ampicillin, amoxycillin, cephalexin, cephadroxyl, cephalosporin C, 6-amino penicillanic acid. 7-amino des acetoxy cephalosporanic acid are either substrate, substrate analogues or product analogues of penicillinase. Primary amino group present in these molecules can react with the glycidyl functional group on the macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers to form affinity supports. The beta-lactam moieties on these derivatised affinity supports are labile and prone to degradation by hydrolysis of cyclic amide bond with time, resulting into chemically nonhomogenous structures. In order to maintain structural uniformity, the beta-lactam moiety is chemically hydrolysed to<br><br>
generate the corresponding acid moiety.<br>
The main object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of novel macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers.<br>
Another object is to provide a process for the preparation of affinity chromatography supports useful for the purification of penicillinase<br>
Yet another object is to provide a process for the preparation of affinity chromatography supports useful for the purification of penicillinase wherein toxic chemicals are not used.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of novel desivatised macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers which comprises suspending macroporous<br>
beaded crosslinked allyl glycidyl ether copolymers in a buffer solution having molarity in the range of 0.05 to 0.2 and pH in the range of 7 to 8, adding to the suspension the ligand solution, adjusting pH in the range of 8.0 to 9.0, shaking the mixture at a temperature in the range of 20 to 30°C for a period upto 48 hours, decanting the supernatant from the reaction mixture, suspending the ligand linked copolymer beads in a base solution having pH in the range of 10.0 to 11, shaking the mixture at a temperature in the range of 20 to 30°C for a period upto 2 hours, collecting the beads by filtration and if required preserving the beaded macroporous beaded copolymers in a suitable buffer.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the ligand chosen for making the ligand solution is an antibiotic and is selected from ampicillin, amoxycillin, cephalexin,<br><br>
cephadroxyl, cephalosporin C, 6-amino penicillanic acid, 7-amino des acetoxy cephalosporanic acid and the ratio of the copolymer and ligand may be in the range of 1:1 to 1: 20.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the base solution used is such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the buffer solution used may be such as phosphate, tris chloride and its molar concentration in the range of 0.05 to 0.2 and pH in the range of 7 to 8.<br>
In still another embodiment of the invention, the novel beaded crosslinked copolymer beads is preserved by suspending the beads in buffer solution such as phosphate, tris chloride having molarity in the range of 0.05 to 0.2 and pH in the range of 7.0. to 8.0<br>

A process for the preparation of noveldesivatised macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers which comprises suspending macroporous beaded crosslinked allyl glycidyl ether copolymers in an inorganic buffer solution having molarity in the range of 0.05 to 0.2 and pH in the range of 7 to 8, adding to the suspension the ligand solution, adjusting pH in the range of 8.0 to 9.0, shaking the mixture at a temperature in the range of 20 to 30°C for a period upto 48 hours, decanting the supernatant from the reaction mixture, suspending the ligand linked copolymer beads in a basic solution having pH in the range of 10.0 to 11, shaking the mixture at a temperature in the range of 20 to 30°C for a period upto 2 hours, collecting the beads by filtration and if required preserving the beaded macroporous beaded copolymers in a suitable buffer.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein, the ligand chosen for making the ligand<br>
solution is an antibiotic such as ampicillin, amoxycillin, cephalexin, cephadroxyl,<br>
cephalosporin   C,       6-amino       penicillanic   acid,   7-amino   des   acetoxy<br>
cephalosporanic acid and the ratio of the copolymer and ligand is in the range of<br>
1:1 to 1:20.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claims 1 and 2, wherein, the base solution used is such as<br>
sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide.<br><br>
4. A process as claimed in claims 1 to 3, wherein, the buffer solution used is phosphate, tris chloride and its molar concentration in the range of 0.05 to 0.2 and pH in the range of 7.0 to 8.0.<br><br>
5.<br><br>
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 4, wherein, the novel beaded crosslinked copolymer beads is preserved by suspending the beads in buffer solution such as phosphate, tris chloride having molarity in the range of 0.05 to 0.2 and pH in the range of 7 to 8.<br><br>
6.        A process for the preparation of novel desivatised macroprocess  baded crosslimted<br>
copolymer useful as macaffinity chromatography supports as herein described with reference to the Examples 7 to 16.<br><br><br></td>
