SLIDE FASTENER SLIDER AND MOLD FOR DIE-CASTING THE SAME BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a slide fastener slider manufactured by molding a cantilevered pull-tab attaching lug on a slider body by die-casting using metal, then threading in attachment ring of a pull tab onto the pull-tab attaching lug from its free end and finally plastically deforming the pull-tab attaching lug by pressing. The invention relates also to a mold for die-casting such slider.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art:<br>
In slide fastener sliders of the described type, it has been a common practice to provide a cantllevered pull-tab attaching lug on a front end of an upper wing of the slider body so as to leave a gap between its rear or free end and the upper wing, then to thread the attachment ring of the pull tab onto the pull-tab attaching lug via the gap and finally to plastically deform the pull-tab attaching lug by pressing to reduce the size of the gap to prevent accidental removal of the attached pull tab.<br>
Japanese Utility Model Publication No. Hei 2-12889 discloses a die-casting mold for slide fastener slider, comprising an upper die of lateral-split type for molding the upper half part of the upper<br><br>
wing and the cantilevered pull-tab attaching lug, a lower die of lateral-split type for molding the exteriors of lower half part of the lower wing, a first slide core disposed between the upper and lower dies and longitudinally slidable to enter the slider body from its front end for molding the front part of the guide post and the interiors of a guide channel and of guide flanges, and a second slide core engageable with the first slide core and longitudinally slidable to enter the slider body from its rear end for molding the rear part of the guide post and exteriors of the guide channel and of the guide flanges.<br>
According to the above-mentioned conventional slider, when the pull-tab attaching lug is pressed on its top surface to plastically deform its base after the pull tab is mounted onto the pull-tab attaching lug, a great pressing force is required so that the base would tend to be cracked or otherwise damaged. Besides, the slider body inevitably has parting lines on the longitudinal, central portions of the slider, including the pull-tab attaching lug, making the overall appearance of the slider body unsightly.<br>
According to thte above-mentioned conventional die-casting mold, since the upper emd lower dies for molding the slider body are parted laterally in opposite directions, parting lines would occur longitudinally and centrally on and along the slider body itself and the pull-tab attaching lug as well, making the overall appearance of the slider unsightly. Further, with this conventional mold, it is difficult to manufacture such a slider that the pull-tab attaching<br><br>
lug can be plastically deformed easily by pressing.<br>

DETAILED DERCRTPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The principle of the present invention are particularly useful when applied to a die-casting slide fastener slider and a mold for die-casting a slide fastener slider, several preferred embodiments of which will now be described in detail with reference to the<br><br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 through 3, in a slide fastener slider of the type in which a pull tab 17 is to be attached to a slider body<br>
1	after the slider body 1 has been molded, the slider body 1 is molded of metal such as aluminum alloy or zinc alloy by die-casting and is composed of upper and lower wings 2, 3 connected at their front ends 10 by a guide post, and a cantilevered, namely, inverted L-shaped pull-tab attaching lug 5 stands on the upper surface of the upper wing<br>
2	and projects from the upper surface of the guide post 4 toward a rear end 11 of the upper wing 2.<br>
The upper and lower wings 2, 3 have along their respective side edges a pair of downwardly bent upper guide flanges 7, 7 and a pair of upwardly bent lower guide flanges 7,7, defining between the upper and lower wings 2,3a Y-shaped guide channel 8 for guiding a pair of rows of fastener elements. The upper guide flanges 7 or the lower guide flanges 7 may be omitted, depending on the type of fastener elements.<br>
The pull-tab attaching lug 5 projecting on the slider body 1 over the upper wing 2 has a right-angled hexahedral hollow 12 extending longitudinally through its base and projecting from the upper end of the guide post 4 and terminates in a downwardly directed rear or free end. As shown in Fig. 2, an end projection 14 extends from the free end of the pull-tab attaching lug 5 i.e. in a lower surface toward the rear end 11 of the slider body 1 and terminates short of the upper surface of the upper wing 2, having a width substantially equal to<br><br>
the hollow 12.<br>
The hollow 12 extends from the base of the pull-tab attaching lug 5 to a base of the end projection 14, as shown in Fig. 3. having a varying width gradually decreasing along the lower surface of the pull-tab attaching lug 5 in a form of a recess. The upper wing 2 has in its upper surface a recess 16 extending from the rear end 11 forwardly beyond a position underneath an inner edge of the end projection 14 and having an arcuate transverse cross section, as viewed from the rear side of the upper wing 2, such that the distance between the inner edge of the end projection 14 and an inner end of the recess 16 is at least slightly larger than the radial thickness D (Fig. 2) of an attachment ring 18 of the pull tab 17.<br>
The recess 16 has a contour substantially complementary to a part of the contour of an outer surface of the attachment ring 18 of the pull tab 17. A gap 15 defined between the end projection 14 and the bottom of the recess 16 is equal to or slightly larger than the radial thickness D of the attachment ring 18 of the pull tab 17 so that the attachment ring 18 can pass freely. Once the attachment ring 18 has passed the gap 15 with the pull tab 17 assuming an upright posture, it is difficult to remove the pull tab 17 off the pull-tab attaching lug 5 as long as the pull tab 17 assumes a horizontal posture, because the gap 15 between thte end projection 14 and the upper surface of the upper wing 2 is smaller than the thickness of the attachment ring 18 irrespective of the presence of the recess 16. Therefore, after the attachment ring 18 has been threaded onto the pull-tab attaching lug<br><br>
5, when the pull-tab attaching lug 5 is pressed downwardly toward the upper wing 2 to plastically deform to reduce the size of the gap 15, the pull tab 17 can no longer be removed off the pull-tab attaching lug 5.<br>
Alternatively the recess 16 may be omitted, namely, the upper surface of the upper wing 2 may be flat as long as the gap 15 between the upper surface of the upper wing 2 and the end projection 14 is substantially equal to and slightly larger than the radial thickness D of the attachment ring 18 of the pull tab 17.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a modified slider body 1 according to a second embodiment of the present invention. In this modified slider body 1, the cantilevered pull-tab attaching lug 5 standing on the upper surface of the upper wing 2 is tapered from the upper portion of its base toward the rear end near the rear end 11 of the upper wing 2, as viewed in plan, facilitating threading the attaching ring 18 of the pull tab 17 onto the pull-tab attaching lug 5.<br>
Fig. 5 shows another modified slider body 1 according to a third embodiment. In this embodiment, the cantilevered pull-tab attaching lug 5 standing on the upper surface of the upper wing 2 has a uniform width except that its rear end near the rear end 11 of the upper wing 2 is rounded, as viewed in plan, to prevent the attachment ring 18 from jamming between the rear end portion of the pull-tab attaching lug 5 and the upper wing 2, facilitating operating the pull tab 17. Fig. 6 shows still another modified slider body 1 according to a fourth embodiment. This embodiment is differentiated over the<br><br>
foregoing embodiments that the upper wing 2 has on its upper surface a central platform 19 extending longitudinally between the front and rear ends 10, 11 of the slider body 1 and over opposite sides of the base of the pull-tab attaching lug 5. With this platform 19, if the setup of the die-casting mold is such that possible parting lines are aligned with the ridges of the platform 19, it is possible to make the parting lines not eye-catching but neat in appearance.<br>
The mold for die-casting the foregoing slide fastener slider will now be described with reference to Figs. 7 through 11. Firstly as shown in Figs. 8 and 11, the mold includes upper and lower dies 20, 21 vertically engageable with each other for molding the upper and lower surfaces of the slider body 1, a mutually cooperating set of first and second slide cores 22,23 (described below), and a mutually cooperative set of third and fourth slide cores 24, 25 adapted to be longitudinally slldably located along the contact surface of the upper and lower dies 20, 21 for molding the guide post 4 of the slider body 1 and the guide flanges 7 (i.e., the guide channel 8).<br>
As shown in Fig. 11, the upper die 20 has a first cavity 26 for forming part of the upper surface of the upper wing 2, i.e. the upper surface of the slider body 1, and the upper surface of the pull-tab attaching lug 5, the first cavity 26 including a first groove 28 slldably receptive of the first and second slide cores 22, 23 as shown in Fig. 9. And the lower die 21 has a second cavity 27 for forming the lower surface of the lower wing 3, i.e. the bottom surface of the slider body 1, the second cavity 27 including a second groove 29<br><br>
slidably receptive of the third and fourth slide cores 24, 25 as shown in Fig. 10. The lower die 21 is fixed and the upper die is vertically movable toward and away from the lower die 21. Alternatively, they may be arranged oppositely.<br>
The first and second slide cores 22, 23 slidable in along the first groove 28 of the upper die 21 for forming the cantilevered pull-tab attaching lug 5 standing on the slider body 1 are each in the f onn of a bar square in transverse cross section having a thickness smaller than the height of the pull-tab attaching lug 5, with their inner end being engageable, as shown in Fig. 9, and the first slide core 22 has at its inner end a central projection 30 for forming the hollow 12, which extends through the base of the pull-tab attaching lug 5, and a pair of side projections 31, 31 disposed and spaced one on each side of the central projection 30 for forming side walls 13 of the hollow 12, generally forming a fork-like shape.<br>
The second slide core 23 is engageable with the first slide core 22 to mold the pull-tab attaching lug 5 and has at its inner end a socket hole 32 receptive of the central projection 30 of the first slide core 22 centrally of a core body thereof, and a pair of tongues 33 slidably engageable with the side projections 31 for forming part of the side walls 13 of the base of the pull-tab attaching lug 5, as shown in Fig. 9. A pair of inwardly bulging protuberances 34 each having an inverted D-shaped transverse cross section are disposed on confronting inner surfaces of the tongues 33, and a stepped cutout 35 is disposed at a common base of the protuberances 34 and is<br><br>
engageable with the central projection 30 for forming the downwardly projecting end projection 14 at the distal end of the pull-tab attaching lug 5.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 8, the second slide core 23 has Longitudinally on a lower surface of its core body a central ledge 36 projecting from the end surface of the stepped cutout 35, having in arcuate transverse cross section and a width substantially equal :o the distance between the protuberances 34 and extending to an Intermediate position of the protuberances 34. A distal end of the central ledge 36 is adapted to be disposed underneath and in contact fith a lower surface of the central projection 30 of the first slide !ore 22 for forming the recess 16 in the upper surface of the upper ring 2. Provision of the central ledge 36 in the second slide core 3 iB arbitrary.<br>
