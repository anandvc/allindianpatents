The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
GRANTED<br>
19-10-2004<br><br>
(Detailed  Description  of   the   Invention]<br>
[0001]	<br>
[Field of the Invention]<br><br>
The present invention relates to a leg shield for a<br>
motorcycle in which its design is newly improved.<br><br>
[0002]     <br>
[Prior Art]<br>
A motorcycle for a business work is provided with a leg<br><br>
shield for covering front sections of both legs of a rider<br>
at a front part of a vehicleâ€”<br><br><br>
This leg shield will be described as follows.<br>
Fig. 6 is a side elevational view for showing a prior art motorcycle; wherein a motorcycle 100 is comprised of a front fork 102 attached to a front section of a chassis frame 101 in such a way it can be steered, a front wheel 103, a handle<br>
104	fixed tp the upper part of the front fork 102, a leg shield<br>
i<br>
105	integrally fixed to the front section and the upper section<br>
of the chassis frame 101, a power unit 106 composed of an engine<br>
and a transmission installed at the central section of the<br><br>
!<br>
chassis frame 101, a rear wheel 107 driven by the power unit<br><br>
106	and a seat 108 fixed to the rear and upper part of the<br>
chassis frame 101.<br>
i<br>
The leg shield 105 is a resin component having an<br><br>
inspection small  window   111   opened   therein. [0003]<br>
[Problems   tp   be   Solved  by   the   Invention]<br><br>
In the case of the aforesaid leg shield 105, the small window 111 lis molded by an exclusive mold, resulting in an increase in cost of the mold, complication of a mold removal<br>
step during its molding operation and a reduction in<br>
productivity.<br>
Further, the small window 111 is molded into such a shape as one in which the circumferential edges of the small window 111 are smoothly connected. However, diversification in<br>
i<br>
requirements of the users in recent years, a new design has been requested not only for the outer shape of the leg shield 105, but also for the small window 111. It has been required that the small window 111 is formed into such a shape as one<br><br>
not found in the market up to now.<br>
In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide a leg shield for a motorcycle in which<br>
a molding with a mold can be easily carried out and a design<br>
of the small window is newly improved.<br>
[0004]<br>
[Means for(Resolving the Problem] In order to attain the aforesaid object, Claim 1 is<br>
constructed in a motorcycle such that a main pipe is extended<br>
from a head pipe in a rearward direction and a leg shield to<br>
cover an upper part and side parts of the main pipe and also<br>
cover front sections of both legs of a rider is fixed, the<br>
leg shield is comprised of right and left shield half members<br>
arranged at the right side and the left side of the main pipe<br>
and a center cover fixed to the upper sections of these right<br>
and left shield half members, and recesses for forming the<br>
right and left windows are formed when the center cover is<br>
fixed to anupper side of each of the right and left shield<br><br>
half members, are formed.<br><br><br>
Accordingly, there is provided a leg shield for a motorcycle comprising: a main pipe extended from a head pipe in a rearward direction; and! a leg shield fixed to cover an upper part and side parts of said main pipe and also cover front sections of both legs of a rider,<br>
characterize by<br><br>
said leg shield comprising: right and left shield half members arranged at a right side and a left side of said main pipe; a center<br>
cover fixed to upper sections of said right and left shield half<br>
members; and recesses for forming right and left windows when<br>
the center cover is fixed to upper sides of each right and left shield<br>
half members.<br><br>
The  right and left half members  are  formed with  recesses to<br>
eliminate the prior art small window forming mold and at the same time<br><br>
to simplify a mold removing step.<br><br>
In addition, a center cover is fixed to the recesses formed at the<br><br>
right and left shield half members to form the right and left windows<br>
;<br>
having   corner  sections   of   acute   or   obtuse   angle   at   their   inner<br><br>
circumstances so as to improve a design of each of the windows of the leg<br>
shield.	<br><br><br>
[0006]<br>
In Claim 2, the center cover can be independently fixed<br>
to or removed from the right and left shield half members. Removing the center cover improves a maintenance<br>
characteristic more.<br><br>

41 and a center cover 43, for example, coloring of the right<br>
i<br>
and left shield half members 42, 41 and the center cover 43 can be made different, and then diversity in design of the leg shield 117 can be attained. [0012]<br>
Fig.3 is a side elevational view for showing the leg shield of the present invention and a substantial part of an inner side of the leg shield. The leg shield 17 may cover a main pipe 81 extending from the head pipe 12 in a rearward direction, a cross pipe 82 extending from the midway part of the main pipe 81 in a rearward direction, a cylinder 83 and a cylinder head 84 of the engine 18, an intake pipe 85 in an intake system connected to the cylinder head 84, a carburetor<br><br><br>
86 and an air cleaner case 87. [0013]<br>
The right and left shield half members 42, 41 (the member 42 at the back side is not shown) and the center cover 43 are<br>
aligned to each other to form the right and left windows 92,<br>
91 (the window 92 at the back side is not shown). The right<br>
and left windows 92, 91 have the same shape from each other<br>
as viewed in the side elevational view and so the description<br><br>
will be made in reference to the left window 91.<br>
The left window 91 is a substantial triangle-shaped<br>
window opened at a position where the upper part of the<br>
i carburetor 86 is exposed, wherein the left window is comprised<br>
1 of a short substantial linear first straight line section 93,<br>
a curved secltion 94 curved downwardly from this first linear<br>
straight line section 93 in a downward direction and a long<br>
substantiallinear second straight line section 95 connecting<br>
these first linear straight line section 93 and the curved<br>
section 94.<br>
[0014]<br>
The fir;st linear section 93 is formed by the front slant section 57 of the recess 53 of the left shield half member 41 shown in Fig.2, the curved section 94 is formed by a bottom curved section 61 of the recess 53 of the left shield half section 41 shown in Fig.2 and the second linear section 95 is formed by the forward extending section 66 of the center cover 43 shown in Fig.2.<br>
A corner section 96 connecting the first linear section 93 with the curved section 94 is of an arcuate shape, a corner<br><br>
section 97 connecting the curved section 94 with the second linear section 95 is of an acute angle and a corner section 98 connecting the second linear section 95 with the first linear section 93 . [0015]<br>
As shown in Figs . 2 and 3 as described above, the recesses<br>
53, 54 are formed at the upper sides 52, 51 of the right and<br>
left shield half members 42 and 41, thereby each of the right<br>
and left shield half members 42, 41 can be formed by one mold,<br>
the mold for the small window can be eliminated in contrast<br>
to the prior art case in which a small window is opened at<br>
the leg shield and at the same time the mold removing step<br>
can be simplified and the molding operation for the right and<br><br>
left shield half members 42, 41 with the mold can be easily<br>
I:<br>
carried out Accordingly, an expenditure of the mold for the leg shield 7 can be reduced and its productivity can be improved. [0016]<br>
In addition, the recesses 54 and 53 are formed in the right and left shield half members 42, 41 and the center cover 43 is fixed to the recesses 53, 54 to form the right and left windows 92, '91, so that the sections of acute angle or obtuse angle not yet found in the prior art can be molded at the circumferential edges of the right and left windows 92, 91 and then a design of each of the right and left windows 92, 91 of the leg shield 17 can be improved. [0017]<br>
Then, an action of the leg shield 17 described above will<br><br><br>
be further described as follows.<br>
Fig .4 is an illustrative view for illustrating an action of the leg  shield of the present invention, wherein in the<br>
case that the number of idling rotation is adjusted by the<br>
carburetor86, for example, a screw driver D is inserted<br>
through either the left window 91 or the right window 92 (not<br>
shown), an iidling adjustment screw (not shown) arranged at<br>
the carburetor 86 is turned by this screw driver D to cause<br>
a fuel flow rate during idling operation to be changed.<br>
In addition, in the case that an air-fuel ratio is<br><br><br>
adjusted by<br><br>
the carburetor 86, the screw driver D is inserted<br><br>
through either the left window 91 or the right window 92, a<br><br>
et injection 8 6 is remove<br>
on member (not shown) arranged at the carburetor ed with the screw driver D, then another jet<br>
injection nfember having a different diameter of fuel flow passage is replaced with the former one to cause the fuel flow rate to be changed. [0018]     <br>
Then, an action of the center cover 43 of the leg shield<br>
17 will be described as follows.<br>
Fig. 5 is an illustrative view for showing an action of<br>
the center cover of the leg shield of the present invention,<br>
wherein as the elements which can not be acknowledged through<br>
the right and left windows 92, 91 (the right window 92 is not<br>
shown) after removing the center cover 43, it is inspected<br>
about the states of the cylinder, cylinder head, intake pipe,<br>
carburetor 816 and air cleaner case 87, for example, whether<br>
or not sound is produced from both the cylinder and the cylinder<br><br>
head, or an oil leakage is present, or a fuel is leaked from the carburetor 86 and abnormal state is found in intake sound of the air cleaner case 87, respectively.<br>
As described above, the center cover 43 is removed to enable its (maintenance characteristic to be improved more.<br>
[0019]<br><br>
Further, although the leg shield 17 shown in Fig.2 is<br><br>
constructed right and 1<br>
such that the recesses 53, 54 are arranged at the eft shield half members 42, 41, the present invention is not limited to this arrangement, the recesses may be formed at the center cover, the center cover having<br>
the recesses may be fixed to the right and left shield half<br><br>
members to form the right and left windows, respectively.<br><br>
[0020]     <br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
i With the aforesaid configuration, the present invention<br>
may provide) the following effects.<br>
, Since the leg shield for the motorcycle described in<br>
Claim 1 is constituted of the right and left shield half members<br>
arranged at jthe right and left sides of the main pipe and the<br>
center cover fixed to the upper section of each of the right<br>
and left shield half members and then the recesses forming<br>
the right and left windows are formed when the center cover<br>
is fixed to the upper side of each of the right and left shield<br>
half members, each of the right and left shield half members<br>
can be formed with one mold, respectively. With such an<br>
arrangement as above, it is possible to eliminate the mold<br>
for the small window to the contrary in the prior art in which<br><br><br>
a small window is opened at the leg shield, a step for removing the mold can be simplified and the molding of both right and left shield half members with the mold can be easily carried out. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce an expenditure for the mold for the leg shield and to improve its productivity.<br>
In addition, it is possible to mold the sections having acute angle or obtuse angle not found in the prior art at the circumferential edges of the right and left windows and to improve a design of each of the right and left windows of the leg shield [0021]<br>
removal of characteris<br>
Since the leg shield for the motorcycle described in Claim 2 is made such that the center cover can be independently fixed to or removed from the right and left half shield members.<br>
the center cover enables a maintenance tic of it to be improved more.<br>
