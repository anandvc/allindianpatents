COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10; Rule 13]<br>
"A PROCESS FOR PREPARING A THIOESTER COMPOUND"<br>
TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRIES, LTD., having a place of business at 5 Basel Street, P.O. Box 3190, Petah Tiqva, 49131, Israel,<br><br><br>
GRANTED<br>
10/5/2006<br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a thioester compound.<br>
This invention claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §1.119(e) of provisional application Serial No. 60/266,162, filed February 2,2001.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel processes of preparing substituted 2-(2-pyridylmethyl) sulfinyl-1H-benzimidazoles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Several substituted 2-(2-pyridylmethyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole are known gastric proton pump inhibitors. These include omeprazole (5-inethoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyidyl)methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole),   lansoprazole (2-[[[3-methyl-4-(2,2,2-trifluoro-ethoxy)2-pyidyl)methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole), pantoprazole (5-<br>
(difluoromemoxy)-2-[[(3,4-dithemoxy-2-pyidyl)methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole), and<br>
rabeprazole(2-[[[4-(3-methoxy-propoxy)-3-memyl-2-pyidinyl]methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole. Fox example, omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor commercially available for the treatment of gastric ulcers. The compound is disclosed in European Patent No. 5318.<br>
A<br><br>
The reported synthesis of these substituted 2-(2-pyridyhnethyl)sulfinyl-1H-benzimidazoles principally involves generally an oxidation process of a thioether moiety to form a thioester moiety of the compound of formula A:<br><br><br>
Various methods employing various different oxidants to perform this oxidation are known. For example, Canadian Patent No. 1,263,119 describes the use of hydrogen peroxide over a vanadium catalyst (such as vanadium pentoxide, sodium vanadate and vanadium acteylacetonate). Canadian Patent No. 1,127,158 similarly describes the use of peracids, 5        peresters, ozone, etc. European Patent Application, Publication No. 533,264 describes the use of magnesium monoperoxyphthalate as the oxidizing agent. PCT Publication No. W091/18895 describes the use of m-chloroperoxy benzoic acid as the oxidizing agent. GB Pat. No.2,069,492 generally describes this acid and other peroxy acids in the oxidation of substituted (phenylthiomethyl)pyridines.<br>
10<br>
Use of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as an oxidant has already been suggested for the performance of various organic oxidations. Sharpless et at, Aldrichimica Acta 12:63 (1979) review the use of THBP as an oxidant and compared with hydrogen peroxide and other peracids. Sharpless et al. describe the use of TBHP in the epoxidation of olefinic<br>
15	alcohols in the presence of VO(acac)2 or Mo(CO)5 catalysts. The oxidation of sulphides,<br>
however, is not described.<br>
In an effort to develop a method for the selective oxidation of sulphides to<br>
sulphoxides, Choudray et al, J. Mol. Catalysts, 75:L7-L12 (1992) describe the use of TBHP<br>
20	in the presence of vanadium pillared clay. The results demonstrated selectivity for the<br>
oxidation to sulphoxide in preference to the sulphone far superior to that of known TBHP/vanadium catalysts. The use of VO(acac)2 or V2O5 resulted in sulphones rather than sulfoxide predominating in the final product.<br>
25	There has been a long felt need for efficient and safe methods for the selective<br>
oxidation of a thioether moiety of formula B to a thioester moiety of formula A. The present invention provides efficient and safe methods of preparing various substituted 2-(2-pyridylmethyl) sulfinyl-1H-benzimidazoles.<br>

pyridyl)memyl]thio]bezimidazole (MPB) were added. 1.5 ml aqueous tert-butyl<br><br>
hydroperoxide (TBHP) (70%) was added over a 5-minute period at 16-17 C and the solution was then stirred for 3 hours. After completion of the reaction, the product mixture was cooled to about 15°C and treated with aqueous sodium metabisulphate. The resultant solid was filtered off, washed with cooled ethyl acetate to afford the end product as an almost white 5        solid (2.5 grams, yield 79%).<br>

22°C. The reaction was allowed to proceed to completion (about 3 hours), after which the<br>

10        hydroperoxide (TBHP) (70%) is added over a 5-minute period at 16-17°C and the solution is then stirred for 3 hours. After completion of the reaction, the product mixture is cooled to about 15°C and treated with aqueous sodium metabisulphate.
