THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH<br>
IT IS TO BE PERFORMED<br><br>
This invention relates to a device and a method for securely, gripping or holding together stacks of sheets.<br>
This invention is particularly directed to but not limited to sheets in the form of bank notes or currency notes [paper money].<br>
The present application claims priority from Provisional Application No. 840/MUM/2004 Dt. 05/08/2004, which is incorporated here by reference.<br>
Particularly, this invention envisages devices used alone or in conjunction with other devices, to compactly and securely grip sheets or currency notes which are arranged in stacks which have a substantially parallelepiped aligned configuration and a defined stacking plane and axis, having at least one uniformly collated edge to apply the said gripping means, duly integrated with a tamper evident feature with provisions to enable authenticity or accountability markings and also to irreversibly leave a trace of any attempts of unauthorised tampering with the contents of the said stack, with provision for easy authorised and / or intentional destacking of the said stack of sheets or currency notes by deliberate deformation, fracturing or frangibility of at least a portion the devices individually or collectively.<br>
As is known institutes, which issue bank notes, also known as the central banks, commercial banks, financial and trade institutions have to handle large quantities of paper money every day. Similarly offices and individuals handle large numbers of paper sheets. For this purpose, the bank notes or sheets are first sorted as per denomination and quality grades, verified for authenticity, and counted either manually or mechanically and grouped into sets of predetermined quantities, typically 100 currency notes, bound together for convenient handling, distribution, storage, transportation and transaction. To hold such groups together, store, transport and transact them without the risk of the notes separating and also in order to prevent tampering, and theft from them, staples or elastomeric bands are applied to them, securing them together or the notes are stapled together with metallic staples. However, it has been observed that, despite the application of bands using the above methods, any of the staples, clips or bands may be taken off without breaking/tearing, allowing the removal of one or more sheet or bank notes surreptitiously. The staples, clips or bands may then be replaced in its original position,<br>
2<br><br>
without leaving a trace of the theft, which has taken place. More particularly in the case of currency notes, this simple banding process maybe acceptable in case of the central virgin currency manufacturing or processing bodies distributing the currency notes only through controlled and highly secure distribution channels. However in case of repackaging of loose circulating currency for public use, simple banding proves grossly inadequate, and unacceptable by both the bank as well as the customer regarding the indisputable proof of contents of the stack, bundle or packet. In bank parlance the stack of 100 currency notes is termed as a packet and 10 such packets when grouped are called a bundle.<br>
To eliminate this possibility, after banding bank notes, at least in the Indian context, were typically stapled through at a particular location over the bank, and to further disable the removal of the said staple, a bank label with a tamper evident sticker was applied suitably along with the banding and stapling. In this case the notes were counted and verified while still secure in packet/ bundle. A notable limitation with this step was that in the process of stapling the notes had to be physically punctured with holes. The user further aggravated the damage during the process of removal of the staples. An important damaging action in the earlier practice worth noting was the difficulty encountered by the persons de-stacking the group of documents / sheets or notes, following the age old practice, such persons would twist approximately half the stacks in opposite directions until the staples tore their way through the stack. To complicate the problem the earlier process lacked repeatability in its operation, whereby old defunct stapling machines were flogged into service by banks, financial and commercial establishments. Thus a single staple applied by the old defunct machine was not sufficient to serve its purpose and the operators of such machines re-applied staples several times from either side until a satisfactory result was obtained. All the aforesaid earlier practices resulted in mutilation of the bank notes wherein each process caused irreversible damage to the bank notes because of repeated holes made in the notes during stapling and re-stapling by defunct machines and consumables and the gross damage caused to the notes during de-stapling. The loss and damage to the currency notes was to such a great extent that the Reserve Bank of India has issued strict guidance against stapling the notes, under the Clean Note Policy, issued in November 2001.<br>
In the absence of stapling, the commonly practiced method is banding, strapping, or application of elastomeric bands relies on a constant circumferential force in the band, one component of this force acts perpendicular to the plane / axis of stacking by the band<br>
3<br><br>
applied serves to grip the documents/ sheets or notes together, whereas the other component of the force acts in a direction causing buckling of the stack. Thus in this case the maximum hoop, circumferential, or longitudinal stress practicably applicable by the band or strap is limited to a force, which grips or clamps the stack together but prevents the same from buckling. However this resulting force is not enough and it is possible to easily remove a few notes without leaving a trace of the theft.<br>
For the above reason there is a requirement of a secure, tamper evident, verifiable, countable and compact means of securely and tamper evidently gripping and holding a pre- sorted, pre-verified, pre-counted and collated stack, packet or bundle of sheets or currency notes, for the purpose of storage, transportation, handling and use as integral stacks, packets or bundles in the transaction course of commerce or trade. The process must be simple, rapid, precise and must provide a strong, secure and tamper evident finished product, with provision for easy authorised and / or intentional destacking without damaging the said stack, packets or bundles of sheets or currency notes. The issuing bank, institution or person must be able to mark its accountability, authenticity and guarantee and the receiving bank, institution or person must be able to satisfy himself by counting or verifying the sheets or notes while still in the securely packed condition, thus enabling any dispute between the issuer and receiver to be resolved. Most importantly the process must be compact, cost effective and simple for the users, the banks and commercial establishments and the common man to afford and use.<br>
Till date even major banks and commercial and financial institutions have not found a viable alternate means to the problems. This invention serves to provide a method and device to solve this problem. In the course of trade, commerce or transactions of such stacks in circulation, it maybe necessary to revalidate the contents by an authority other than the original issuing authority, this invention also provides means for such revalidation by simply applying another tamper evident means with fresh authentication or accountability markings over and above the originally applied means without destacking or unbundling.<br>
There are other similar high value or precious documents or sheets, which require secure, verifiable and tamper evident means of holding them securely for the purpose of easy<br>
4<br><br>
transactions, such as share certificates, lottery tickets, to which the device and method of this invention can be applied to achieve the desired objectives.<br>
The principal object of this invention is to provide a clip or clips applied either alone or in conjunction with a tamper evident film wrap or sleeve, applicable by a device provided along with / therefor, for the purpose of securely, irreversibly, non easily duplicable, and tamper evidently, gripping a stack of paper currency notes, sheets or documents together:-which have a substantially parallelepiped aligned configuration and a defined stacking plane and axis, having at least one uniformly collated edge or corner to apply the same, for the ease of storage, transportation, distribution and transactions, which renders the removal of a single or multiple document, sheet or note extremely difficult in the course of normal trade and commerce.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a clip either alone or in conjunction with a tamper evident film wrap or sleeve which when applied in accordance with this invention, does not damage the currency notes, sheets or documents contents of the said stack.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a clip either alone or in conjunction with a tamper evident film wrap or sleeve which when applied in accordance with this invention, allows the contents of the stack so produced to be verified, either mechanically or manually, for quantity, quality or authenticity without opening or impairing the functionality of any competent<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a clip either alone or in conjunction with a tamper evident film wrap or sleeve when applied in accordance with this invention, duly integrated with the clip material, whenever desired can be easily opened without damaging the sheets, documents or notes.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a clip either alone or in conjunction with a tamper evident film wrap or sleeve, which when once applied in accordance with this invention and subsequently opened cannot be used to re-clip or re-grip the bundle or stack.<br>
5<br><br>
Typically the said clip prior to application, is initially flexible and deformable and the said clip is made as a sheet metal component or may be in the form attained as an extruded profile with specially designed cross section to attain the objectives of the invention.<br>
Typically the said clip is applied over the side formed by the collated edges of the stack by means of a device, which applies external forces in various directions to deform or crimp the clip rendering it rigid enough to retain the desired gripping force, by means, such as, but not limited to crimping, denting, bending, beading, forming, planishing and the like.<br>
The said clip is provided with at least three planar members, two opposing planar members which when applied to the stack contact the parallel opposite faces of the said stack, hereinafter termed as the "Gripping Members" and the common connecting planar member which when applied to the stack is corresponding to the side surface formed by the collated edges of the stack, hereinafter termed as the "Connecting Spine Member".<br>
The said clip is presented for application over the said stack in a formable or preformed condition with the Connecting Spine Member flat or preferably preformed slightly convex or concave and which is deliberately provided with an abundantly / optimal large base dimension, specially designed for the dimensions of the stack proposed to be gripped and with the two opposite Gripping Members tapering open outwards in an operative configuration of the clip so as to accommodate and enable easy insertion of loose, fluffy documents, sheets or notes, prior to gripping in compressed or compacted state.<br>
In the simplest form the clip may be made in-situ from a continuous strip of metal having desired thickness and metallurgical properties present in the form of a coiled roll. The applicator machine shall unwinds the coiled strip, shears individual clip material of the desired length and preforms the clip ready to accept the stack for application as described above.<br>
In another case the clip may be individually cut or blanked and preformed to its initial form and a desired number of such clips maybe provided in a neatly stacked form, for dispensation and application as described above.<br>
6<br><br>
Further the clip may have non-symmetrical dimensions or forms of the two opposite gripping member e.g. one may be longer or wider or thicker or formed differently than the other, and the connecting spine member may be provided with notched or projections so as to allow only one particular way of location by the for applying the clip in accordance with this invention.<br>
Typically the clip material may be deliberately cold worked, embossed, dented, corrugated, beaded or coined, to impart strength and work hardening to desired portions of the clip, while keeping the other portions initially flexible for application and retention of the forces described above.<br>
Typically the clip may include certain dimples, raised portions, bosses, brackets, holes, recessions, or knife edges whether staggered or not, at strategic locations in the geometry so as to enable concentration of the force elements at the said strategic locations, to ensure a better grip by the Retained Gripping Force, so as to attain the aforesaid objective/s of the invention.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the invention the clip is provided with a weakened cross section or a geometric design pattern by, cutting, scoring, or pressing or by introducing fatigue so as to define a frangible area, which can make the duly applied clip easy to open by bending, fracturing or tearing along this weakened section. This feature can further ensure that the once applied cannot be reapplied after the same is opened.<br>
Typically the clip may be surface treated by any surface treatment processes, such as, electro plating, painting, lacquering, anodising, powder coating, phosphating, blackodising etc. so as impart corrosion resistance as well as enhance the aesthetic appeal of the same. The surface treatments on the inside of the clips maybe with special characteristics such as defined thickness, defined softness or anti-skid property to ensure that the gripped notes in contact are not damaged and to achieve better gripping properties. The outside surface treatments may include application of adhesives, glues so as to ensure better integration with the tamper evident film sleeve described later in this invention.<br>
Typically the clip may be provided with projections or profiles as means for easy opening, such as tabs, radii along the edges that come in contact with the contents of the stack when<br>
7<br><br>
the stack is split into approximate halves held in either hand and turned and pulled in opposite directions causing the deemed rigid clip to yield irreversibly and deform or fracture and let go the contents of the stack. There maybe provided certain features to enable use of common everyday household items such as coins, keys, bottle openers etc for opening the clip.<br>
Typically the clip may be preformed with its edges and corners well rounded, deburred or beaded by bending over so as to eliminate or minimise the sharp edges or corners so as to prevent damage to the contents of the gripped stack and also prevent injury to the users of the clip.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention there is provided a clip in conjunction with a Membranous frangible film wrap or sleeve integrally adhered or locked in position with respect to the applied clip in an operative configuration of the said clip, said clip securely gripped the contents of the said stack and said wrap or sleeve protecting the tamper evident features of the gripped stack in such a manner so as to virtually render the tampering of the contents of said stack impossible, without irreversibly leaving trace of the same.<br>
Typically the membranous frangible tamper evident film wrap or sleeve maybe provided in the form of a shrink film, of known materials such as but not limited to polyethylene, polyolefin, Poly-Vinyl-Chloride PVC, PET and the like which may be provided in the form of a continuous tube or a lay flat film roll, which may be formed and applied in-situ, or the same may be provided in the form of pre-formed envelopes, pouches or preformed cup like forms neatly packed in a stacked form.<br>
Typically the membranous frangible tamper evident film wrap or sleeve may be a heat shrink film having pre-oriented heat shrink properties, such that the same shrinks more in the circumferential direction around the stack, with a relatively lower shrinkage along the longitudinal stacking axis of the stack.<br>
Typically the membranous frangible tamper evident film wrap or sleeve may be preprinted with the brand, logo, advertisement or graphic designs of the issuer or user. The printings maybe done by any suitable known methods such as but not limited to rotogravure,<br>
8<br><br>
flexographic, offset, or screen printing process. The graphic designs or matter printed maybe deliberately distorted or stretched to account for the shrinkage of the film, so that the final image appears normal and undistorted.<br>
Typically the membranous frangible tamper evident film wrap or sleeve may incorporate difficult to duplicate features such as hologram, colour changing inks, hidden messages printed with invisible inks, fluorescent inks, machine readable inks or the like as may be desired by the users requirements.<br>
Typically the outside surface of the membranous frangible tamper evident film wrap or sleeve may be specially coated so as to enable writing with ordinary pens so as to allow the issuing bank, institution or person to mark its accountability, authenticity and guarantee by way of ink seals, signatures code numbers etc. This coating may be made soluble with common solvents such that if anyone tries to erase the markings the coating will dissolve and make the attempt to tamper abundantly visible.<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a process of forming a clipped parallelepiped stack of the type described above said stack having a plurality of separate sheets or notes comprising the steps of providing a clip as described herein above having gripping members and a connecting spine member and applying an external force, of a controlled magnitude, on the external and opposite surfaces of the Gripping Members of the said clip typically in the direction perpendicular to the axis and plane of the parallelepiped stack, so as to compress or compact the said notes or sheets from the said stack to in effect render removal of one or more notes or sheets extremely difficult without either tearing off the documents, sheets or notes or without causing de-stacking and thereby leaving a trace of tampering, and deforming the gripping members and the connecting spine members such that the outwardly tapering gripping Members bend inwards and contact the opposite parallel surfaces of the loose and fluffy stack causing the notes to be compressed and compacted to develop the desired a secure grip and causing buckling of the Connecting Spine Member deliberately provided with convexly or concavely with an abundantly / optimal large dimension, in a generally convex or concave direction with reduced radius, to match the reduced compressed and compacted securely gripped stack dimension.<br>
9<br><br>
The method includes the step of while still holding the stack by the earlier described Applied Gripping Force, applying at least one other external force of a predetermined magnitude on the external surface of the Connecting Spine Member of the said clip typically in the direction parallel to the axis or plane and of stacking, hereinafter termed as the "Crimping Force" denoted as "CF", causing the Connecting Spine Member to deform or crimp.<br>
A further step includes during this deforming or crimping process reducing the radius of the concave or convex body of the spine member, to match the reduced compressed and compacted securely gripped stack dimension, and flattening and therefore expanding the connecting spine member resulting in the formation of ridges along the two common edges of the connecting spine member and the two opposing gripping Members.<br>
Typically this Crimping Force, so applied to the initially deformable clip provides rigidity to the thus applied clip. The initially deformable clip applied in accordance with this invention, thus deemed or rendered rigid under the jointly and sequentially applied Gripping Force and Crimping Force/s, therefore the now rigid clip is able to retain a residual and permanent component of the Applied Gripping Force, on the compressed or compact state of the currency notes, documents or sheets of the said stack to ultimately render removal of one or multiple documents, extremely difficult without either tearing off the documents, sheets or notes or without causing de-stacking and thereby leaving a trace of tampering, even after the removal of the said externally applied forces. Thus this residual and permanent force acting on the said stack delivers the basic results desirable in accordance with this invention, and this residual and permanent force is hereinafter termed as the "Retained Gripping Force" denoted as "RGF".<br>
Typically, the process if this invention includes the step of providing predetermined profiles, cavities and / or indentations patterns, to deform the gripping members and / or the connecting spine member of the clip, during the aforesaid process of application, to provide the gripping and / or crimping members with additional rigidity to better retain the Retained Gripping Force.<br>
Typically, the said provided profiles, cavities and / or indentations patterns are mutually interfering on the abutting faces which further deforms the clip and more particularly the<br>
10<br><br>
connecting spine member and the ridges formed during the initial crimping process, to further enhance the rigidity to better retain the Retained Gripping Force. In another preferred embodiment of the process of this invention a crimping force element is provided, which after the flattening and formation of the crimped ridge, further deforms, wrinkles the clip members as above, more particularly the said ridge to further enhance the rigidity to better retain the Retained Gripping Force.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the process of this invention the applied gripping Force and the Crimping Force are applied as two components of a single unidirectional force.<br>
In this case the tools for applying the Applied Gripping Force are in the shape of tapered wedges housed in a housing with matching taper. Upon application of the single unidirectional force through the provided linkages the wedge shaped tools operating in the tapered housing move towards each other in turn exerting the Applied Gripping Force. After sufficient Applied Gripping Force is exerted the base member provided with yielding bushes in the linkage becomes operative and exerts the crimping force.<br>
It is within the scope of this invention that the process includes applying multiple clips to the stack at advantageous locations such as at the corners of the stack, our opposite edges of the stack or multiply applied at regular intervals in cases where the length of the edge of the stack is long to achieve the objectives of this invention.<br>
Typically the membranous frangible tamper evident film wrap or sleeve can be applied independently on the pre-packed stacks in accordance with this invention, to enable another person to revalidate and mark his accountability, authenticity or guarantee without destacking the originally griped stack by applying his own tamper evident means over and above the existing one.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention the said membranous frangible tamper evident film wrap or sleeve is integrated with the clip to irreversibly prevent, without tearing or leaving a trace of tampering, the sliding-off of the tamper evident member over the compactly applied clip and then after tampering with the contents of the stack, re-sliding-on the tamper evident member, thereby concealing the tampering.<br>
11<br><br>
The invention therefore provides a process of integrating by applying known kinds of adhesives or glues such as but not limited to pressure sensitive adhesives, hot-melt adhesives, micro-encapsulated adhesive systems, etc to the outside surface of the clip, and during or after applying the tamper evident member ensuring the bond between the two. Typically the said integration is achieved by separately coating two components of a two component adhesive system, one on the outside surface of the clip and the other on the inside surface of the tamper evident member. Each component in its individual state is non-tacky and thus enable easy handling of the clip and the tamper evident member, but when the two come in contact under the influence of heat or pressure they form a firm bond.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the invention the said integration is achieved mechanically by providing spikes or tines formed on the surface of the clip, and which puncture the tamper evident member to form a mechanical bond. Such spikes or tines may be pressed folded back after puncturing the film so as to prevent objectionable sharp points from causing injury to the users.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of this invention the clip material and the tamper evident film material are pre-integrated, with the clip adhered or bonded to the film at a regular pitch, and provided in a roll form, such that the film is indexed by the desired pitch cut and sealed to form a pouch with the clip located centrally. Thus the stack is presented for clipping by the aforesaid forces is simultaneously held by the shrinking tamper evident film achieved by a blast of hot air.<br>
Typically the clip material and the tamper evident film material are pre-integrated, with the clip adhered or bonded to the film with another membranous film member adhered to the inside surface of the clip and / or the tamper evident film member, in effect encapsulating or sandwiching the clip material between these two film material providing a better integration between the clip and the tamper evident film wrap.<br>
The inner film material may serve the purpose of providing a soft anti-skid component in contact with the notes, sheets or documents contents of the stack for better grip without damage to the said contents.<br>
12<br><br>
The encapsulated or sandwiched clip material is thus also protected from the external environment preventing corrosion, therefore demanding less rigorous and cost effective surface treatments. The adhesives used for this pre-integration may be doped with known corrosion prevention chemicals such as phosphates, chromates, oxides and the like.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the said inner film can be deliberately strong and thick and provided with extra longitudinal dimension so that it substantially juts out and beyond the two gripping surfaces and this extra material jutting out serves as a tab which can be used to grip the film by hand and pulled in opposite direction as a means to easily open the applied clip, without using the contents of the stack as opening means.<br>
Typically the clip material and the tamper evident film material are pre-integrated with or without the second inner film, and pre-formed in the form of a roughly rectangular or trapezoid tapering cups partly preshrunk to achieve the tapering form to achieve packing in a neatly stacked form and having ease of insertion of the loose fluffy notes through the large mouth of the pre-formed clip and film combinations. The pre-formed clip and film combinations, other detailed forms to enable automatic, semi-automatic or manual dispensation of a single set, and further to enable gripping of the clip and locating it in the devices for applying the Applied Gripping Force and the Crimping Force, along with the blast of hot air or applies heat for shrinking the tamper evident film material, while concurrently enabling the provided collating devices, which provide vibrations centering and holding of the stack which is presented for compactly, securely and tamper evidently gripping in accordance with this invention. Thus in a single operation the finished product is obtained.<br>
According to this invention therefore, there is provided a device for compactly and securely gripping sheets or currency notes which are arranged in a stack which has a substantially parallelepiped aligned configuration defined by parallel opposite faces, a defined stacking plane and axis, and at least one uniformly collated edge, said device having<br>
[i] gripping means, in the form of two opposing planar deformable resilient gripping members which when applied to the stack in an operative deformed configuration of the device, contact and grip the parallel opposite faces of the said stack with a gripping force,<br>
13<br><br>
and a deformable spine member connecting the said gripping members which when<br>
applied to the stack in an operative deformed configuration of the device , contacts and<br>
grips the collated edge ; and<br>
[ii] tamper evident means, integratable with the gripping means, said tamper evident<br>
means having provisions to enable authenticity or accountability markings and also to<br>

Typically, the process includes the step of applying at least one other external force of a predetermined magnitude on the external surface of the Connecting Spine Member of the said clip typically in the direction parallel to the axis or plane and of stacking, causing the Connecting Spine Member to at least partially deform or crimp .<br>
18<br><br>
Typically, the process includes the step during this deforming or crimping process whereby the radius of the concave or convex body of the spine member is reduced to match the reduced compressed and compacted securely gripped stack dimension, is flattened and therefore expands the connecting spine member resulting in the formation of ridges along at least a portion of the two common edges of the connecting spine member and the two opposing gripping Members.<br>
Typically, the Crimping Force is applied to the initially deformable clip to provide rigidity to the clip.<br>
Typically, the deformed clip rendered rigid retains at least a component of the gripping force to grip the stack to ultimately render removal of one or multiple documents, extremely difficult without either tearing off the documents, sheets or notes or without causing de-stacking and thereby leaving a trace of tampering, even after the removal of the said externally applied forces.<br>
Typically, the process includes the step of providing predetermined profiles, cavities and / or indentations patterns, to deform the gripping members and / or the spine member of the clip, to provide the gripping and / or crimping force with additional rigidity to better retain the gripping Force.<br>
Typically, the profiles, cavities and / or indentations patterns are mutually interfering on the abutting faces and further deform the clip and more particularly the spine member and ridges formed during the crimping process, to further enhance the rigidity to better retain the Gripping Force.<br>
Typically, the process includes the step of providing an additional crimping force element, which after causing the flattening and formation of the crimped ridge on the spine member, further deforms, wrinkles the said ridge to further enhance the rigidity to better retain the Gripping Force.<br>
Typically, the gripping Force and the Crimping Force are applied as two components of a single unidirectional force.<br>
19<br><br>

Typically, the process includes the step of integrating the membranous frangible tamper evident film wrap or sleeve with the said clip prior to applying the clip and the wrap or sleeve to the stack.<br>
Typically, the process includes the step of applying known kinds of adhesives or glues such as but not limited to pressure sensitive adhesives, hot-melt adhesives, microencapsulated adhesive systems, to the outside surface of the clip, and adhering the membranous frangible tamper evident film wrap or sleeve to the clip before, during or after applying the clip to the stack and ensuring a bond between the clip and the membranous frangible tamper evident film wrap or sleeve.<br>
Typically, the process includes the step of applying by separately coating two components of a two component adhesive system, one on the outside surface of the clip and the other on the inside surface of the said wrap or sleeve, each component in its individual state being non-tacky, but when the two come in contact under the influence of heat or pressure they form a firm bond.<br>
20<br><br>
Typically, the process includes the step of integrating the clip and the said wrap or sleeve mechanically by providing spikes or tines formed on the surface of the clip, which puncture the tamper evident member wrap or sleeve to form a mechanical bond. Typically, the process includes the step of folding back the spikes or tines after puncturing the film so as to prevent objectionable sharp points from causing injury to the users.<br>
Typically, the clip material and the tamper film wrap or sleeve are pre-integrated, with the clip adhered or bonded to the film at a regular pitch, and provided in a roll form, such that the film is indexed by the desired pitch cut and sealed to form a pouch with the clip located centrally.<br>
Typically, the stack presented for clipping by the aforesaid forces is simultaneously held by the shrinking tamper evident film wrap or sleeve achieved by a blast of hot air.<br>
Typically, the tamper evident film wrap or sleeve is shrunk to fit the stack by a hot blast of air.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the clip is pre-integrated, with an additional film bonded to the inside surface of the clip and/or the tamper evident film member, in effect encapsulating or sandwiching the clip between these two film material providing a better integration between the clip and the tamper evident film wrap or sleeve.<br>
Typically, the adhesives used for pre-integration of the clip and the films are doped with known corrosion prevention chemicals such as phosphates, chromates, oxides and the like.<br>
Typically, the said additional film is selected from a more tear resistant material and has an extra longitudinal dimension so that it substantially juts out and beyond the two gripping surfaces and this extra material jutting out serves as a tab which can be used to grip the film by hand and pulled in opposite direction as a means to easily open the applied clip, without using the contents of the stack as opening means.<br>
In accordance with yet another embodiment of the invention, the clip and the wrap or sleeve are pre-integrated with or without the second inner film, and pre-formed in the form of a roughly rectangular or trapezoid tapering cup partly preshrunk to achieve the tapering<br>
21<br><br>

Figure 4 is a schematic view which elaborates the basic geometry of a preformed clip 10, with a uncurved Spine Member 12, the gripping member 14 and the opposite Gripping member 16 taper open outwards so as to accommodate and enable easy insertion of loose, fluffy documents, sheets or notes. The feature of providing the clip with deburred and well rounded edges, which prevent injury to the users and also prevent damage to the stack contents 200 during application or opening, are shown by numeral 24 and the common Spine member provided with notch or projection 26 which allows only one particular way of location for applying of the clip.<br>
Figure 5 is another schematic view which elaborates the basic geometry of a preformed clip 10, in which the gripping member 14 and the opposite Gripping member 16 taper are<br>
24<br><br>
provided with indentations 18 which cause force concentration to enable a better grip of the contents of the stack. A weakened cross section 28 provided on the connecting spine member defines a frangible area, which can make the duly applied clip easy to open by bending, fracturing or tearing along this weakened section and also ensuring that the once applied cannot be reapplied after the same is opened.<br>
Figure 6 is a cross sectional view of a preformed clip 10 with the connecting spine member 12 preformed slightly convex generally and the clip is provided as a sheet metal component with the gripping indentations 18 obtained by sheet-metal forming techniques.

In this view the rounding and provision to more particularly prevent damage to the contents of the stack denoted by the numeral 24.<br>
Figure 8 is a view whereby the outwardly tapering open configuration of the preformed clip 10 is generally used advantageously for compactly and neatly stacking the preformed clips, for the ease of storage, transportation and application.<br>
Figure 9 is an isometric views of the clip 10 depicted in a predominantly flat configuration for achieving the ease and compactness for the purpose of stacking and transportation and which can be easily bent to the form suitable for application by the specially provided means therefor. This view permits via graphical illustration of the features whereby the clip 10 is provided duly cold worked upon by sheet-metal forming methods more particularly such as but not limited to embossing, coining, planishing, etc. to impart strength and work hardening to desired portions of the clip geometry, generally denoted by the numeral 30. The indentations 18, which may be pre-formed or may be formed during the process of application of the clip, are provided for the purpose of developing a better grip. The thus provided element may also impart strength to better retain the applied gripping force but must not be confused with the element 30 which provides hardness and / or strength to specific strategically designated areas of the clip 10 by cold working.<br>
25<br><br>
There are also provided zones or sections 32, which make some portions initially flexible for deformation and application, such as, by corrugation, wrinkling and the like. Here too the element 28 must not be confused with element 32. Element 28 is weakened cross section provided for the purpose of ease to open by bending, fracturing or tearing and also to prevent reusability, whereas the element 32 is provided for the initial flexibly for the purpose of application.<br>
Figure 10A to figure 10D illustrates the way by which the clip 10 provided as a sheet metal component with the connecting spine member 12 preformed slightly convex, is applied to the stack 200 by a force applying device indicated generally by the reference numeral 120.<br>
Figure 10A depicts the clip 10, the gripping members 14 and 16 with preformed indentations 18 are tapering open outwards and the loose fluffy and uncompacted stack 200 of sheets, notes or documents are easily inserted into the clip, and the collated edge of the stack is held properly located by the not illustrated locating and collating element 122.<br>

Figure 10C depicts the machine elements 124 and 126 which apply Gripping Force causing the contents of stack 200 to be compressed and compacted. Clip elements 18 concentrate the applied gripping force on small areas of the stack to develop a better grip. The connection member 12 has buckled convexly to match the compacted dimension produced by the applied gripping force.<br>
Figure 10D depicts the machine element 128 provided as a tool or die for the purpose of applying the crimping force. The stack 200 and clip 10 while still being held by the machine elements 124-and 126 exerting the applied gripping force is now applied the crimping force by machine element 128. On account of the inward movement of 128 the connecting spine member 12 has been flattened and has in turn expanded to form ridges 20 rendering rigidity to the clip. The mutually interfering profiles, cavities and / or<br>
26<br><br>
indentations patterns on the abutting faces of elements 124, 126 and 128 are generally denoted by the numeral 130 and further inward movement of 128 cause these interfering elements 130 to form ingressed deformation 22 of clip and more particularly the connecting spine member 12 and the ridges 18, to further enhance the rigidity of the clip to improve the Retained Gripping Force.<br>
Figure 11A to figure 1 ID elaborate the application of the clip 10 provided with a concave Spine member 12 to the stack 200 by the device 120.<br>
Figure 11A depicts the clip 10, the gripping members 14 and 16 have turned inwards to become parallel and in contact with the opposite surfaces of the stack 200 because of the inward motion of the machine elements 124 and 126. The gripping members 14 and 16 do not have preformed indentations, however the machine elements 124 and 126 are provided with specially provided indentor profiles generally denoted by the numeral 132.<br>
Figure 11B depicts the machine elements 124 and 126 for applying Gripping Force causing the contents of stack 200 to be compressed and compacted. Clip elements 18 are formed at this stage by the indentors 132. The connecting spine member 12 buckles concavely to match the compacted dimension produced by the applied gripping force.<br>
Figure 11C shows the application of Crimping Force by the machine element 128, while the stack and clip are held by the machine elements 124 and 126c causing the connecting member 12 to flatten and produce the ridge 20.<br>
Figure 1 ID shows the possibility of deploying other tools 134 which exert another force to further deform the clip and its applied rigidity so as to improve the Retained Gripping Force.<br>
Figure 12 is a three dimensional schematic view explaining the application as described by drawings 11A to 11D<br>
Figure 13A shows the clip 10 applied on opposite sides of stack 200 while figure 13B shows the clip 10 applied over the corners of the stack 200, and in the gist of the presentation such multiple application are part of the present invention.<br>

Figure 14A and 14B depict the application of the clip with the help of a single unidirectional force, whose components are advantageously available as the Applied Gripping Force and the Crimping Force. The machine elements 124 and 126 alongwith their preferred embodiments 132 are provided as wedges housed in a tapering housing 136 of the machine 120. These elements are connected to the machine element 128 alongwith the preferred embodiments 130 through linkages 138 provided with slots and a compressible bush 140. Springs are also provided to abundantly open the pair of machine elements to accept the clip 10 in its initial form. The unillustrated element 122 provided in the machine 120 enables proper location and collation of the clip 10 and the stack 200 for application of the clip. Upon deployment of the single unidirectional force, the machine elements first turn inward with the griping elements 14 and 16. Further movement engages them to move parallely inwards interacting with the tapered housing 136 exerting the Applied Gripping Force. After sufficient Applied Griping Force has been applied the specially provided bushes 140 yield and allow the crimping machine element to engage in the manner desired to achieve the objective of this invention.<br>
To make the stack 200, which is tightly gripped by clip or clips 10 applied in accordance with this invention, a tamper evidently griped stack, a membranous frangible tamper evident means 60 is applied by integration means 90 so as to obtain the desired compact finished product.<br>
Figure 15 schematically depicts a way by which, the tamper evident shrink film wrapper 60 is applied over the pre-obtained, stack 200 and clip 10 assembly. Here, the tamper evident element 60 is provided in the form of a preformed envelope, slid over the said assembly and shrunk. During shrinking the graphically denoted glue or adhesive coating 92, provided on the external clip surface integrates with the tamper evident film element 60. Alternately the graphically denoted area 94 provided as a selective, partially and pre-coated area adheres irreversibly with the clip. The elements 92 and 94 may be individual components of a two component adhesive system, which integrally form the bond 90 during the shrinking process.<br>
Figure 16 schematically depicts the revalidation possibilities, whereby only individual tamper evident elements 60 with all their related features can be applied over existing finished products, so as to change the accountable, authentic and guarantee markings,<br>
28<br><br>
afresh by revalidating over and above the existing stacks 200, without first destacking the same.<br>
For the sake of providing ease of explanation, the application of the clip 10 on the stack 200 by specially provided means 120, and then separately the application of the tamper evident film member 60 duly integrated with clip 10 by integration means 90, to deliver the desired finished product in accordance with this invention was shown. Advantageously, the clip 10 and the tamper evident film 60 can be presented as a pre-integrated pair by means 90, for application to finally deliver the results in accordance with this invention.<br>
Figure 17 shows a cross-sectional view of the clip 10, pre-integrated by adhesive means 92 to the membranous frangible tamper evident film member 60 to form the bond 90.<br>
Figure 18A shows the possibility of mechanical integration of the clip 10 with the tamper evident film 60 by the provision of spikes or tines 96 which puncture the tamper evident film 60 and as shown in figure 18B the tines 96 are bent over ensuring a mechanical bond integrating the clip 10 with the tamper evident film 60.<br>
Figure 19 shows a sectional view of the clip 10, pre-integrated on the outside by adhesive means 92 to the membranous frangible tamper evident film member 60 with the provision of another tough anti-skid film member 98 adhered in the inside of the clip by other adhesive means 99 to the inside of the clip in such a manner that the clip 10 is encapsulated between the two film members 60 and 98. The inner film member is shown substantially projecting beyond the clip members 14 and 16 so as to provide space for gripping this projections between fingers of either hand and pulling apart to open the applied clip whenever required. Figure 19A is an enlarged partial cross section view to effectively show the details described for figure 19.<br>
Keeping the gist and sprit of this invention, it is possible to present many ways of presenting and dispensing pre-integrated pairs of the clip element 10 and the tamper evident element 60 for the purpose of application. To keep the approach simple Figure 20 shows a sophisticated arrangement where in the preformed clip 10 is adhered and bonded by means 92 or 94 to the membranous frangible tamper evident film member 60 and also<br>
29<br><br>
duly affixed on the inside with an anti-skid, protective, and oversized film member 98. This assembly is sealed at appropriate location 63 on film 60 and then partly preshrunk and preformed and provided as a compactly stackable cup like shape 100. The large opening of the thus provided assembly 100 enables easy insertion of the stack contents with gradually guided into the predominantly parallelepiped aligned configuration. Vibrations and other collating means can now be applied by the machine 120 provided to collate the stack while also applying the gripping and crimping forces with heat to shrink the tamper evident member 60 to deliver the compact finished product in one operation. Figure 20A shows the stack form of a few preformed assembly 100.<br>
Figure 21 A, 2IB and 21C demonstrate the easy ways by which the securely and tamper evidently gripped stack 200 can be opened for consumption. Figure 21A demonstrates the method by which approximately half of the stack is held in either hand and tugging and pulling in opposite directions to rip open the applied means. Figure 21B generally depicts the possibility of provisions of tabs or projections 40 on the clip, which engage with common everyday objects 300, e.g. a bottle opener 302, for effortlessly opening such stacks. Figure 21C demonstrates the easy opening feature of the film member 98, which when provided oversized and tough serves the purpose of providing tabs for gripping by hands and pulling apart for opening the clip.<br>
