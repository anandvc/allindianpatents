STRIP-CASTING MACHINE FOR PRODUCING A METAL STRIP AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING SAME<br>
The invention pertains to a stripip-casting machine for producing a metal strip with two rotatably supported casting rolls set up next to each other to form a casting gap, where the casting rolls can be shifted away from the casting position to a servicing position and back again, and to a method for controlling the strip-casting machine.<br>
In strip-casting machines with two casting rolls, arranged essentially parallel to each other, aide pieces are used to form the boundaries of the casting gap on the narrow sides.  When strips, especially steel strips are cast, these side pieces are worn down by abrasive wear as a result of the friction with the casting rolls and also, in the lower part, by the friction with the solidified strip.  When thus worn out, these side pieces must be replaced.  So that they can be replaced, the side pieces are moved out of the casting oosition, in which they rest against the barrels, by means of the setting device in an essentially horizontal direction away from the barrels and into a setting position.  Then side piece changing devices, e.g., robots, which are mounted on the casting platform on both sides of the machine,<br><br>
raise the side pieces up and out of the setting position. Japanese Patent Kokai JP-5[1993]-329,583 A, for example, describes robots of this type for replacing these side pieces.<br>
In the known scrip-casting machines, the casting rolls are stationary and are mounted rigidly underneath a ladle turret and a tundish vessel or the like.  When these casting rolls must be serviced by regrinding or when they must be replaced, for example, a great deal of complicated disassembly and reassembly work is involved, because the casting rolls are difficult to access in themselves.  Because of their weight, furthermore, they must be lifted away by a crane and set back into position again with an accuracy on the scale of millimeters.  The conneccion and disconnection of the water lines or the electrical connecting lines is also associated with cumbersome v;ork procedures because of the limited degree of accessibility present.  It is even necessary to divide the structural frame on which the casting rolls are supported into two parts.<br>
Another disadvantage of these known strip-casting machines is that, during the maintenance or servicing of the casting rolls or of the machine, no casting work can be done, which limits the casting output of the installation.<br>
In a stripcasting machine of the general type in question according to WO-A 53/22,087, the casting rolls are supported on a<br><br>
care, which can be moved along rails by a cylinder over a distance equal to approximately half the length of the cart. This design of the strip-casting machine, however, 13 suitable only for casting rolls of small diameter.  The accessibility to the casting rolls in the servicing position a certain distance away from the casting position, furthermore, is still only slightly improved, because the rolls are still relatively close to the  casting position.<br>
The present invention was based on the task of creating a strip-casting machine of the general type described above in which optimum accessibility to the machine and especially co the casting rolls is made possible, as a result of which the rolls can be serviced or replaced rapidly, and in which the availability of the strip-casting machine for casting and thus the casting output of the installation can be increased.<br>
The task is accomplished according to the invention in chat the casting rolls can be shifted away from the casting position by a distance such that a second, prepared pair of casting rolls can be moved into the casting position.<br>
With this design of the strip-casting machine according to the invention; in which the casting rolls can be shifted into a servicing position some distance away from the casting position and immediately replaced by another prepared set of casting<br><br>
rolls, considerable advantages are obtained in comparison with the known systems.<br>
In an elaboration of the invention, it is provided that the casting rolls are supported rotatably on a structural frame; chat the structural frame can  be shifted away from the casting position by the distance indicated above; and that a second structural frame provided with prepared casting rolls can be shifted into the casting position.<br>
By shifting the structural frame with the casting rolls to a servicing position, tools, gauges, finishing equipment, measurement and other control devices, etc., can be set up permanently at this location.  This allows the machine to be maintained and serviced both quickly and also professionally. After a structural frame has been moved away to allow, for example; the casting rolls to be replaced with others of a different width or in cases where the casting rolls are no longer functional, newly prepared casting rolls on a different structural frame can be brought immediately into position underneath the tundish vessel, so that casting can begin again or continue.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention and additional advantages of same are explained in greater detail below on  the basis of the drawings:<br><br>

-	Figure 2 is a section through the strip-casting machine according to Figure 1;<br>
-	Figure 3 is a section through the casting machine with illustration of the servicing positions of the casting rolls;<br>
-	Figure 4 id a schematic top view of the casting machine; and<br>
-	Figure 5 is a schematic top view of a variant in the form of a twin-strand casting machine.<br>
Figure 1 shows a strip-casting machine 20 of a casting installation 10 for metal strip 15, especially a steel strip, which can be produced in a continuous casting operation.  This strip-casting machine 20 is supported on a carrier system 12 and is supplied with molten metal from a tundish vessel (not shown), located above it, as known from conventional strip-casting systems,<br>
This strip-casting machine 20 consists primarily of two casting rolls 22, 24, essentially parallel to each other, the axes of which are approximately horizontal, and which are provided at each end with a lateral sealing element 25, as a<br><br>
result of which an enclosed space is creaced with a casting gap open at: the bottom.  The casting rolls 22, 24 are rotayably supported at each end on a structural frame 32, and each is driven in a controlled rr.anner by its own motor.  One of the parts 32 of the structural frame 32. 32' and the casting roll 22 belonging to it can be swing around an axis 71 by an adjusting means 72 for the purpose of adjusting the width of the casting gap.<br>
Each of the casting rolls 22, 24 consists of a motor-driven cylindrical jacket and a stationary axle 75, on which the jacket is rotatably supported.  Each of the axles 75 is supporced at each end in the structural frame 32, 32'.  This design with stationary axles 75 makes it possible to assemble the structural frame and the axles easily together into a unit.<br>
The casting rolls 22, 24 in the structural frame 32 and the lateral sealing elements 25 are surrounded on all sides by a sealable housing 30.  During the casting operation, the interior 33 of the housing is kept filled with a shielding gas, preferably an inert gas.  It is highly advantageous for this box-shaped housing 3 0 to leave a certain gap between it and the casting rolls 22, 24 and the structural frame 32 both at the sides and also at the cop.<br>
A cover 35, which rests approximately horizontally on top of<br><br>
the housing 30, is provided; this cover can "be shifced from the closed position shown to a raised position 35' and shifced horizontally away from this raised position to a position 35". For this purpose, che cover has rollers 27 on the sides, which travel along suitable rails 23,  In the closed position shown, the cover 35 is advantageously lowered to the bottom level 14 to produce the desired seal of the housing 30,<br>
The housing 30 also has openings 39, which can also be closed by doors 36; these openings are provided so that manipulators 40, which can travel outside the housing 30, can carry each of the lateral sealing elements 25 of the casting rolls 22, 24 away from the operating position shown, through the openings 39 and out of the housing 3 0 and back again.  Each manipulator 40 has for this purpose a supporting arm 41, to which the lateral sealing element 25 is attached.  The sealing element can thus be moved by the manipulator 40 from the operating position to a remote servicing position 25' and back again.  In the operating position of the manipulator 40, it is possible :o use a separate protective enclosure 3 8 to seal off the unsealed opening 39,  This protective enclosure 33 surrounds the manipulator 40 and is pressed tight against the side of the housing 30.  Also indicated are holders 83 for delivering and taking away the lateral sealing Glements 2 5.  It is advantagaous<br><br><br><br>
an opening.  When pivoted into the positions 3hown in dash-dot line; the flaps 54', 55' ^erve  as a guide path for the mecai strip 15,<br>
The housing 3 0 has a feed line (not shown) for the injectiion of shielding gas into the interion 33; the gas can be sent around a Circuit and cooled before being returned.  Upon completion ct the casting operation but: before the housing is opened, the shielding gas can be drawn. off into a storage tank, and the air in it can be filtered out if desired.<br>
According to the invention, the casting rolls 22, 24 and at least the structural frame 32 supporting them are supported on rails 4a or the like so that they can be shifted from the casting position G shown to a servicing position W and back again.  In the present exemplary embodiment , furthermore, the box-like housing 3 0 surrounding the structural frame 32 is also movable, for which purpose it has wheels 37, guided externally on the rails 48, 46'.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 2 also, the rails 48, 48, which form a pair and carry the housing 30; have a section in the area of the casting position G which is separate from the rest of the length of the rails.  This section is designed so that its height can be adjusted by lifting cylinders El or the like, which are attached to a structure 62.  In Figure 1, this section of the<br><br>
rails is shown in the lowered position together which the h 30, whereas in Figure 2 it is shown in the position in which it is aligned with the adjacent section of 48' of the rails.  In the lowered position, the water feed lines 54 leading to the casting rolls 22, 24 are connected  to the water supply system. 65, which is provided in the housing floor.  The water feed lines 64 are in the structural frame 32, whereas the water supply system 6 5 along with the appropriate feed and discharge lines extends underneath the housing 30.  Thus chs water lines 64 are connected and disconnected automatically upon actuation of the lifting cylinders 51.  By means of non return valves (not shown), the cooling water can be prevented from escaping when the lines are disconnected.<br>
The lower contact surface of the cover 3 5 is underneath the floor 14 when the cover is in the lowered position, i,e., in the position where it seals off the housing, so chat the housing can be shifted horizontally underneath the floor 14.  As shown m Figure 2, the cover is supported by its rollers 27 on the rails 28 as it is being moved and can be raised and lowered independently of the housing by lifting cylinders 74.<br>
When the housing 3 0 is to be replaced, a new one with prepared casting rolls 30 is pushed into the casting position G and lowered.  Then the lateral sealing elements 2 5 are pressed by<br><br>
the manipulators 4C against the end surfaces of the casting rolls<br>
22, 24 with a defined pressure; the protective enclosures 38 and<br>
the cover 3 5 are connected tightly to the housing 30; and the<br>
inferior of the housing is mertised by the shielding gas.<br>
An additional advantage of the invention is that this<br>
replacement of the casting rolls 22, 24 can be carried out "on<br>
the fly", as it were; that is, the casting pipe, which passes<br>
through the cover 35 and projects between the casting rolls 22,<br>
24, can be kept in position without the need to raise the tundish<br>
vessel 18 which holds it.  During a replacement operation, the<br>
cover 35 is raised; the lateral sealing elements 25 are removed;<br>
and the casting rolls 22, 24 are rolled away from the housing 3 0<br>
horizontally in the direction of their rotational axes.  In a<br>
corresponding manner, the new casting rolls or casting rolls of a<br>
different width, for example, are brought up in such a v/ay that<br>
the casting pipe assumes a position between them again but<br>
without actually contacting them.  Thus casting can continue<br>
without the need to empty the tundish vessel 16.  The only step<br>
which must be taken before casting can start again is to open the<br>
element which seals the cutlet of the vessel.  As a result, the<br>
output of the strip-casting machine according to the invention<br>
can be increased significantly.<br>
According to Figure 3. the housing 30 is designed within the<br><br>
scope of the invention so chat it can be moved along with the used cascing rolls 22, 24 far enough away from the casting position G that a second housing 3 0 with prepared casting rolls can be conveyed into the casting position G.  After reaching the casting position G. this housing 30 can be made ready for casting by lowering the rails 48 and  thus connecting the lines 64 to the water supply system 65 and by closing the cover 35.  It is advantageous for the distance between the casting position G and the servicing position W to be equal to several lengths of the housing or of the casting rolls, so that work can be carried out in the servicing position without interference from the casting operation.  The exact distance depends on the circumstances of the individual casting installation.<br>
Figure 4 shows a casting installation 10 which works with a single strand.  A ladle turret 81 conventional in and of itself holds a ladle 82, from which the molten steel is poured into a tundish vessel 18.  The molten steel then passes between the casting rolls located in the casting position G.  The metal strip emerging at the bottom from between the two casting rolls is then conducted away in the direction of the arrow S3.  In the servicing position W, the casting rolls 22, 24 are serviced by, for example, turning or grinding the surface or by some other type of surface treatment or are possibly replaced by new cascing<br><br>
rolls as suggested in the figure.  These casting rolls 22, 24 are pushed away together with their housing 30 along the rails 43'. The tundish vessels 18, 18' are also prepared for use.  These could also be pivoted into the casting position by the ladle turret.<br>
Figure 5 shows a casting installation 80 with two strands, one next to the other, where, in contrast to the installacion according to Figure 4, two ladle turrets 31, each with its cwn:<br>
servicing position W, are provided.  In addition, two housings 30 with casting rolls 22, 24 are stationed between the casting positions G of the two strands; this location can also serve advantageously as a servicing position.<br>
The invention could also be implemented to very great advantage in a twin-scrand casting installation, in which two strands are supplied with molten metal by a tundish vessel with two outlet pipes.  In this case, two housings, each with two casting rolls, would be used, one next to the other.  An on-the-fly replacement could be accomplished here by replacing the one or other housing while casting continues with the other.<br>
Instead of being positioned next to the casting rolls by manipulators 40, the lateral sealing elements could in principle be mounced on the structural frame and moved away into the servicing position along with the structural frame.  The housing<br><br>
30 could also remain m the casting position.  In that case, only the structural frame, equipped with appropriate wheels, and the casting rolls would be moved away.<br>
In principle, other means of moving the structural frame and the casting rolls such as, for example, suspension rails or an air-cushion bed could be used instead of rails.<br>
The housing could also be guided along continuous rails without a section which can be lowered.  The water line connections would in that case have to be designed as plug-in connections, as a media pressure plate, or the like.<br><br><br><br>
