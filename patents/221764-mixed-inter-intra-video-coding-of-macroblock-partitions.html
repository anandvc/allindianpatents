This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.<br>
60/438,427 (Attorney Docket No. PU030010), filed January 7, 2003 and entitled<br>
"MIXED INTER/INTRA VIDEO CODING OF MACROBLOCK PARTITIONS", which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed towards video encoders, and more<br>
particularly, towards an apparatus and method for encoding mixed interblock and<br>
intrablock video.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Video data is generally processed and transferred in the form of bit streams.<br>
Typical video compression encoders gain much of their compression efficiency by<br>
forming a reference picture prediction of a picture or macroblock to be encoded, and<br>
encoding the difference between the current picture and the prediction. The more<br>
closely that the prediction is correlated with the current picture, the fewer the number<br>
of bits that are needed to compress that picture, thereby increasing the efficiency of<br>
the process. Thus, it is desirable for the best possible reference picture prediction to<br>
be formed.<br>
Interblock ("inter") and intrablock ("intra") coding are commonly used in video<br>
compression standards. Generally, an encoder makes an inter/intra coding decision<br>
for each macroblock based on coding efficiency and subjective quality<br>
considerations. Some partitions (e.g., 16x8, 8x16 or 8x8 sub-blocks) of a 16x16<br>
macroblock, for example, might be more efficiently coded using intra coding while<br>
other partitions of the same macroblock might be more efficiently coded using inter<br>
coding.<br>
Thus, each individual macroblock was either coded as Intra, i.e., using only<br>
spatial correlation, or coded as Inter, i.e., using temporal correlation from previously<br>
coded frames. Inter coding is typically used for macroblocks that are well predicted<br>
from previous frames, and intra coding is generally used for macroblocks that are not<br>
well predicted from previous frames, or for macroblocks with low spatial activity.<br>
The JVT video compression standard, which is also known as H.264 and<br>
MPEG AVC, uses tree-structured hierarchical macroblodk partitions. Inter-coded<br>
16x16 pixel macroblocks may be broken into macroblock partitions, of sizes 16x8,<br>
8x16, or 8x8. 8x8 macroblock partitions are also known as sub-macroblocks. Submacroblocks<br>
may also be broken into sub-macrobiock partitions, of sizes 8x4, 4x8,<br>
and 4x4. An encoder may select how to divide the macroblock into partitions and<br>
sub-macrobiock partitions based on the characteristics of a particular macroblock in<br>
order to maximize compression efficiency and subjective quality.<br>
Multiple reference pictures may be used for Inter prediction, with a reference<br>
picture index coded to indicate which of the multiple reference pictures is used. In P<br>
pictures (or P slices), only single directional prediction is used, and the allowable<br>
reference pictures are managed in list 0. In B pictures (or B slices), two lists of<br>
reference pictures are managed, list 0 and list 1. In B pictures (or B slices), single<br>
directional prediction using either list 0 or list 1 is allowed, or bi-prediction using both<br>
list 0 and list 1 is allowed. When bi-prediction is used, the list 0 and the list 1<br>
predictors are averaged together to form a final predictor.<br>
Each macroblock partition may have independent reference picture indices,<br>
prediction type (e.g., list 0, list 1, bi-prediction), and an independent motion vector.<br>
Each sub-macrobiock partition may have independent motion vectors, but all submacrobiock<br>
partitions in the same sub-macrobiock use the same reference picture<br>
index and prediction type.<br>
It was proposed that intra prediction could be used for some of the partitions of<br>
an inter-coded macroblock. Because of complexity concerns, ultimately this flexibility<br>
was disallowed, and intra-coding mode is not allowed for individual macroblock<br>
partitions under the current standards. Some of the increased complexity in<br>
supporting both inter and intra coded partitions inside the same macroblock is due to<br>
the intra spatial directional prediction used in the JVT standard. Disallowing mixed<br>
inter/intra coding inside the same macroblock can hurt coding efficiency and<br>
especially subjective quality. For some blocks in an image, intra coding is more<br>
efficient than intra coding.<br>
The Main and Extended profiles of the JVT standard provide a tool for<br>
weighted prediction. When weighted prediction is in use, a weighting factor and an<br>
offset are applied to inter predictions. For single directional prediction, the weighted<br>
predictor is formed as:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and for bi-directional prediction, the weighted predictor is formed as:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
where W0 and O0 are the list 0 reference picture weighting factor and offset,<br>
respectively, and W, and OT are the list 1 reference picture weighting factor and<br>
offset, and LWD is the log weight denominator-rounding factor. SampleP0 and<br>
SamplePi are the list 0 and list 1 initial predictors, and SampleP is the weighted<br>
predictor. Weighting factors and offsets are optionally coded in the slice header and<br>
are associated with particular reference picture indices.<br>
The relevant syntax elements in the JVT standard are:<br>
luma_log_weight_denom, chromajog_weight_denom, luma_weightJO,<br>
chroma_weight_IO, luma_offset_IO, chroma_offset_IO, Iuma_weight_l1 ,<br>
chroma_weight_H , Iuma_offset_l1 , and chroma_offset_H .<br>
In addition, more than one reference picture index can be associated with a<br>
particular reference picture store by using reference picture reordering, which allows<br>
more than one weighting factor to be used while predicting from the same reference<br>
picture store.<br>
The Joint Video Team ("JVT") video compression standard explicitly supports<br>
16x16 pixel macroblocks being divided into smaller sized macroblock partitions for<br>
inter coding, but does not support inter coding of some partitions of a macroblock and<br>
intra coding of other partitions of the same macroblock.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
These and other drawbacks and disadvantages of the prior art are addressed<br>
by an apparatus and method that provide mixed inter/intra coding of macroblocks<br>
through the use of weighted prediction.<br>
A video encoder and corresponding method are provided for mixed inter/intra<br>
encoding of a macroblock having a plurality of partitions, where the encoder includes<br>
a reference picture weighting applicator coupled with a reference picture weighting<br>
factor unit for assigning weighting factors corresponding'to each of the inter and intra<br>
coded partitions, respectively; and the corresponding method for encoding a<br>
macroblock with several partitions includes inter-coding at least one partition and<br>
intra-coding at least a second partition.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are capable of providing<br>
mixed inter/intra coding in compliance with the JVT compression standard through<br>
the use of weighted prediction. In accordance with the principles of the invention,<br>
mixed inter/intra coding of partitions within the same macroblock is allowed, which<br>
can improve coding efficiency as well as subjective video quality.<br>

PU020340), filed April 9, 2003, having a common assignee, and entitled "ADAPTIVE<br>
WEIGHTING OF REFERENCE PICTURES IN VIDEO DECODING"; and in U.S.<br>
Patent Application Serial No. 10/410,456 (attorney docket number PU020477), also<br>
filed April 9, 2003 and also having a common assignee, and entitled "ADAPTIVE<br>
WEIGHTING OF REFERENCE PICTURES IN VIDEO ENCODING", both of which<br>
are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties; an apparatus and method are<br>
disclosed which utilize a set of weighting factors transmitted once per picture or slice,<br>
with a particular weighting factor associated with each reference picture index.<br>
Turning now to Figure 3, a video encoder with integrated motion estimation<br>
and weighting prediction is indicated generally by the reference numeral 300. An<br>
input to the encoder 300 is connected in signal communication with.a non-inverting<br>
input of a summing junction 310. The output of the summing junction 310 is<br>
connected in signal communication with a block transformer 320. The transformer<br>

a reference picture weighting factor selector 372. The input to the encoder 300 is<br>
further connected in signal communication with a second input of the reference<br>
picture weighting factor selector 372 to provide the current picture to the selector.<br>
The output of the reference picture weighting factor selector 372, which is indicative<br>
of a weighting factor, is connected in signal communication with a first input of a<br>
multiplier 374. A second input of the multiplier 374 is connected in signal<br>
communication with the reference picture output of the reference picture store 370. It<br>
should be noted that although shown simply as a multiplier 374, other types of<br>
weighting factor applicators may be constructed other than a multiplier, as would be<br>
apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The output of the multiplier 374 is connected in signal communication with a<br>
weighted reference picture store 376. The output of the weighted reference picture<br>
store 376 is connected in signal communication with a first input of a motion estimator<br>
380 for providing a weighted reference picture. The output of the motion estimator<br>
380 is connected in signal communication with a first motion compensator 382 for<br>
providing motion vectors. The output of the motion estimator 380 is further<br>

the encoder 300, which is the current picture, is further connected in signal<br>
communication with a second input of the absolute difference generator 384. The<br>
output of the absolute difference function 384 is connected in signal communication<br>
with a third input of the reference picture weighting factor selector 372.<br>
A third output of the reference picture store 370 is connected in signal<br>
communication with a second input of the second motion compensator 390. The<br>
output of the second motion compensator 390, which is indicative of a motion<br>
compensated reference picture, is connected in signal communication with a first<br>
input of a multiplier 392. The output of the reference picture weighting factor selector<br>
372, which is indicative of a weighting factor, is connected in signal communication<br>
with a second input of the multiplier 392. The output of the multiplier 392 is<br>
connected in signal communication with an inverting input of the summing junction<br>
310.<br>
In U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/410,479 (attorney docket number<br>
PU020339), filed April 9, 2003 and having a common assignee, and entitled<br>
"MOTION ESTIMATION WITH WEIGHTING PREDICTION", and which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; an apparatus and method are<br>
disclosed for combining the weighting factor search with the motion estimation<br>
search, resulting in a higher number of computations performed for finding the<br>
weighting factor with motion estimation than for performing estimation alone in the<br>
absence of reference picture weighting.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, a flow diagram for a method of encoding macroblocks is<br>
indicated generally by the reference numeral 400. Here; a begin block 410 passes<br>
control to a function block 412, which finds the best Inter macroblock division,<br>
calculates the cost for each partition, CPINTER; and calculates the cost for the entire<br>
macroblock, CINTER. The block 412 passes control to a function block 414, which<br>
finds the best Intra prediction direction and calculates the cost for the entire<br>
macroblock, CINTRA. The block 414 passes control to a decision block 416, which<br>
determines whether CINTER is less than CINTRA.<br>
If CINTER is not less than CINTRA, control passes to a function block 418 that<br>
Intra codes the entire macroblock, and then passes control to an end block 434. If,<br>
on the other hand, CINTER is less than CINTRA, control passes to a function block<br>
420, which uses Inter coding for the macroblock and selects the first (/=0) partition of<br>
the macroblock. The block 420 passes control to a function block 422, which<br>
calculates the cost for the current partition, CPINTRA,, which is coded as Intra using<br>
a zero weighting factor. The block 422, in turn, passes control to a decision block<br>
424, which determines whether CPINTER, is less than CPINTRA,.<br>
If CPINTER, is less than CPINTRA,, control passes to a function block 426,<br>
which Inter codes the current partition /, and passes control to a decision block 430.<br>
If, on the other hand, CPINTER/ is not less than CPINTRA,, control passes to a<br>
function block 428, which non-predictively Intra codes the partition / using a zero<br>
weighting factor, and passes control to the decision block 430.<br>
The decision block 430, in turn, determines whether the current partition /is<br>
the last partition in the macroblock. If the current partition /is not the last partition in<br>
the macroblock, control passes to a function block 432, which increments the current<br>
partition /', and passes control back to the function block 422. If, on the other hand,<br>
the current partition /is the last partition in the macroblock, then control passes to the<br>

Thus, in operation of the present invention, mixed inter/intra coding of<br>
partitions of the same macroblock can be accomplished using the JVT compression<br>
standard. Intra coding of a macroblock partition is accomplished by using a weighting<br>
factor of zero with the weighted prediction tool in the Main and Extended profiles of<br>
the JVT standard. This type of intra coding is referred to as non-predictive intra<br>
coding, to differentiate it from the spatial directional intra coding used when entire<br>
macroblocks are intra coded. A macroblock containing some non-predictive intra<br>
coded partitions is still considered to be an inter coded macroblock.<br>
A weighting factor of zero is coded in the slice header, associated with a<br>
particular reference picture index. The encoder may associate multiple reference<br>
picture indices with a particular reference picture store, using reference picture<br>
reordering, in order to allow both a zero and a non-zero weighting factor to be<br>
associated with a particular reference picture store. Or the encoder may choose to<br>
use the default reference picture ordering, without using reference picture reordering,<br>
and to associate only a zero weighting factor with a particular reference picture store.<br>
If only a zero weighting factor is associated with a given reference picture store, it can<br>
not be used for inter prediction, so the encoder will select to do this when it is<br>
determined that this reference picture store would not be frequently selected for inter<br>
prediction. A long-term reference picture can be associated with a zero weighting<br>
factor for this purpose.<br>
For the single directional prediction case, with a weighting factor of zero, the<br>
weighted prediction formula for calculating the inter prediction:<br>
SampleP = Clip 1 (((SampleP0- W0 + 2LWD-1])&gt;&gt; LWD) + O())<br>
becomes:<br>
SampleP = O0<br>
The offset value O0 may be set to be equal to zero, or to 128, or to any other<br>
desired value. MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 effectively use an offset of 128 for intra coding.<br>
With a sample prediction of zero or of O0 for all pixels of a macroblock<br>
partition, the macroblock partition is effectively intra coded, but spatial directional<br>
prediction is not performed. The partition is referred to as being non-predictive intra<br>
coded.<br>
In B pictures (or B slices), non-predictive intra coding for a macroblock<br>
partition can be accomplished either by selecting only List 0 or List 1 prediction and<br>
(2<br>
the reference picture index which was associated with a zero weighting factor.<br>
Alternatively, bi-prediction could be used, with a zero weighting factor sent in the slice<br>
header for a particular index for list 0 and for another index for list 1, and nonpredictive<br>
intra coding could be accomplished for that macroblock partition by coding<br>
using bi-prediction with the appropriate zero weighting factor associated reference<br>
picture indices for list 0 and list 1.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a JVT video encoder<br>
encodes the macroblocks of a picture. When encoding a given mac.roblock, in<br>
addition to determining how to divide a macroblock into partitions and submacroblock<br>
partitions, the encoder determines whether is it is more advantageous for<br>
each macroblock partition to be coded as non-predictive intra or as inter (e.g., list 0,<br>
list 1, direct, or bi-predictive). For those macroblock partitions(s) which are to be<br>
coded as non-predictive intra, an inter coding mode (e.g., list 0, list 1, direct, or bipredictive)<br>
is used in the mb_type for that partition, with reference picture indices<br>
used that are associated with a zero weighting factor. Non-predictive intra coded<br>
partitions are not further divided in sub-macroblock partitions, as is generally allowed<br>
for 8x8 sub-macroblock partitions, as additional bits would be required to indicate the<br>
division into sub-macroblock partitions, with no benefit. The differential motion vector<br>
for the non-predictive intra coded partition is set to zero, because that will use the<br>
fewest number of bits to code, and all possible values of the motion vector will yield<br>
the same decoded pixels.<br>
Using this method, intra coding is effectively accomplished for some but not all<br>
of the partitions of a macroblock, which is compatible with the JVT compression<br>
standard. No intra spatial directional prediction is performed for non-predictive intra<br>
coded partitions.<br>
An exemplary method for encoding a macroblock in accordance with the<br>
proposed invention is shown in the flowchart 400 described with respect to Figure 4.<br>
The best division of the macroblock into macroblock partitions and sub-macroblock<br>
partitions for Inter coding of the macroblock is determined using rate-distortion<br>
optimization, and a cost measure is calculated for each partition, CPINTER/, and for<br>
the entire macroblock, CINTER. The cost for coding the partition includes the cost of<br>
coding the reference picture index, the motion vector, and the prediction residual.<br>
Then the best Intra spatial prediction direction for the Intra coding of the macroblock<br>
is determined and a cost measure is calculated for Intra coding of the entire<br>
macroblock, CINTRA. Then if CINTER is not less than CJNTRA, the entire<br>
macroblock is coded as Intra, using spatial directional prediction. Otherwise, the<br>
macroblock is ceded as an inter macroblock.<br>
Next, each partition of the inter macroblock is considered to be coded as inter<br>
or non-predictive intra. The cost for intra coding the partition, using zero weighted<br>
prediction is computed, CPINTRA,, considering the cost of coding the reference<br>
picture index, and the residual, and the zero valued differential motion vector cost.<br>
If for the partition /CPINTER, is less than CPINTRA,, the partition /will be inter<br>
coded normally, and may be further divided into sub-macroblock partitions.<br>
Otherwise, the partition will be non-predictive intra coded, by selecting the reference<br>
picture index associated with a zero weighting factor.<br>
