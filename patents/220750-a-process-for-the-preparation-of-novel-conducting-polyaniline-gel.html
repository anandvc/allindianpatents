				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of novel polyaniline gel in water in its conducting, form. More particularly it relates to a process for the preparation of polyaniline gel in aqueous medium in its conducting form, known as the emeraldine salt form. This compound has the general formula 1 in the drawing shown below wherein R = H or CH/j and Rx = alkyl sulphonate or its sodium salt with x=7- 12.(Figure Removed)<br>
Formula 1<br>
The novel polyaniline gel prepared by the process of this invention could be used to process high quality conductive polyaniline film, just prior to gelation.<br>
Considerable attention has been focused on polyaniline in the recent years since this material possesses interesting electrical and optical properties, well suited to such a variety of applications. Protonation-deprotonation processes can reversibly control its electrical properties. It can exist in several molecular forms, differing in chemical compositions, structures and electrical conductivity. All these forms can be in! i.TCoiiverled into cadi oilier by chemical or electrochemical oxidation. Processing<br>
difficulties due to its inherent insolubility and infusibility considerably hampers the industrial development of conductive polyaniline prepared chemically by conventional methods.<br>
The development of synthetic methodology to get processable polyaniline is of great interest because of the advantages offered by the material in post-synthesis processing.<br>
There are three possible methods for improving the processibility of polyanilines:<br>
1.	Preparation of polyaniline dispersions, However, the Polyaniline dispersions<br>
reported so far precipitate rapidly, thus limiting the storage stability of the<br>
material.<br>
2.	Prefunctionalisation of the starting monomer with a suitable group prior to<br>
polymerisation. The products obtained were found to be intractable in the acid<br>
form and can be made soluble only by converting it into the non-conductive base<br>
form.<br>
3.	Formation of the polymer salt using an acid functionalised by a large non-polar<br>
substituent known as counterion induced processibility. The research so far<br>
carried out using this method introduced polyanilines soluble in organic solvents<br>
There are no reports of conductive processable polyaniline gel in water. The process for the preparation of novel polyaniline gel in its conducting form as described and claimed by this invention is reported for the first time.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation<br>
of novel conductive polyaniline gel in water, to overcome the drawback of proccssability problem of polyaniline, in its conducting form, namely the emeraldine salt.<br>
Another object is to provide a process for the preparation of conductive polyaniline gel in water using alkyl and alkyl aryl sulphonic acids as the protonating agent, which have surfactant properties.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a process wherein the synthesised processable emeraldine salt is a gel in water.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of conductive polynailine gel in water from which high quality, thick and thin conductive polyaniline films could be processed just prior to gelation.<br>
•<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of conductive processable novel polyaniline gel in water in its conducting form, of formula 1 in the drawing accompanying wherein R = H or CHs and Rx = alkyl sulphonate or its sodium salt with x =7 - 12, which comprises polymerising aromatic amine in the presence of a sulphonic acid, in aqueous medium, in the presence of an oxidising agent at a temperature in the range of 0°C to 60°C, for a period ranging between 2 to 24 hours, collecting the resultant product to obtain polyaniline gel of formula 1. (Figure Removed)<br>
Formula 1<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the aromatic amines used for polymerisation may be aniline or substituted aromatic amines selected from o-toluidine, m-toluidine.<br>
In another embodiment, the sulphonic acid used may be selected from alkyl sulphonic acid, octane sulphonic acid, nonane sulphonic acid, decane sulphonic acid, dodecane sulphonic, or alkyl aryl sulphonic acid such as dodecyl benzene sulphonic acid.In still another embodiment of the invention, the oxidising agent used may be selected from ammonium persulphate, potassium persulphate, potassium bromate, potassium iodate, sodium iodate, potassium dichromate, potassium permanganate.<br>
The amount of oxidising agent used may be in ihc range of 0.5 to 3 %.<br>
