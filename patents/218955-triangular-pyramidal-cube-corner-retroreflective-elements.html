The present invention relates to triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements having a novel structure and a triangular-pyramidal cc retroreflective assembly in which the triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements are arranged. More minutely, the present invention relates to retroreflective elements (hereafter simply referred to as retroreflective elements or reflective elements) such as triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements constituting a retroreflective body useful for reflectors such as signs including traffic signs and construction work signs, visible tapes of vehicles and motorcycles, safety materials of clothing and life preservers, markings of signboards, and reflectors of visible light, laser beam, or infrared-ray reflective sensors, and an assembly of the retroreflective elements.<br>
Still more minutely, the present invention relates to triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements characterized in that triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements protruding beyond a common bottom plane (Sx-SxO share one base edge (x) on the bottom plane (Sx-SxO and are arranged in the closest-packed state so as to be faced each other, the bottom plane (Sx-SxO is a common plane including a plurality of the base edges (x,x,...) shared by the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements, two triangular-pyramidal reflective elements faced each other include the shared base edges (x,x,...) on the bottom plane (Sx-Sx') and form a substantially same-shape element pair faced each other so as to be symmetric to planes (Lx-Lx, Lx-Lx,...) vertical to the bottom plane (Sx-Sx'), and when assuming the height from the bottom plane (Sx-Sx') including the base edges (x,x,...) shared by the two triangular-pyramidal reflective elements faced each other up to<br><br>
apexes (Hi and H2) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements as hx, the height from a bottom plane (Sy-SyO including other base edges (y,y,...) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements up to the apexes (Hi and H2) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements as hy, and the height from a bottom plane (Sz-SzO including still other base edges (z,z,...) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements up to the apexes (Hi and H2) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements as hz, at least any two of hx, hy, and hz are substantially different from each other and a mirror reflective layer is formed on reflective side faces of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements.<br>
Background Art<br>
A retroreflective body for reflecting entrance light toward a light source has been well known so far and the reflective body using its retroreflectivity is widely used in the above industrial fields. Particularly, a triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective body (hereafter also referred to as a CC reflective body) using the internal-total-reflection theory such as triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements (hereafter also simply referred to as triangular-pyramidal reflective elements or CC reflective elements) are remarkably superior to a retroreflective body using conventional micro glass beads in retroreflective efficiency of light and thereby, uses of the triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements have been increased year by year because of its superior retroreflective performance.<br>
However, though conventional publicly-known triangular-pyramidal retroreflective elements show a preferable retroreflective 3fficiency when an angle formed between the optical axis (axis passing through the apex of a triangle equally separate from three faces constituting triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements and inserting with each other at an angle of 90°) of the elements and an entrance ray is small because of the reflection :heory of the elements, the retroreflective efficiency is suddenly owered (that is, the entrance angle characteristic is deteriorated) as ;he entrance angle increases. Moreover, the light entering the face of<br><br>
the irianguiar-pyramidal reflective elements at an angle less than the critical angle (oc) meeting an internal-total-reflection condition decided in accordance with the refractive index of a transparent medium constituting the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements and that of air reaches the back of the elements without totally reflecting from the interface of the elements. Therefore,[a retroreflective sheeting using triangular-pyramidal reflective elements generally has a disadvantage that it is inferior in entrance angularity,!<br>
However, because triangular-pyramidal retroreflective elements can reflect light in the direction in which the light enters over the almost entire surface of the elements, reflected light does not reflect by diverging at a wide angle due to spherical aberration like the case of micro-glass bead reflective elements. However, the narrow divergent angle of the reflected light easily causes a trouble that when the light emitted from a head lamp of an automobile retroreflects from a traffic sign, it does not easily reach, for example, eyes of a driver present at a position separate from the optical axis of the head lamp. The frequency of the above type of the trouble increases more and more (that is, observation angularity is deteriorated) because an angle (observation angle) formed between the entrance axis of rays and the axis connecting a driver with a reflection point increases.<br>
Many proposals have been made so far for the above cube-corner retroreflective sheeting, particularly for a triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective sheeting and various improvements are studied.<br>
For example, the specification of Jungersen's US Patent No. 2,481,757 discloses retroreflective elements assembly in which all base edges of triangular-pyramidal reflective elements are present on the same plane, the optical axis of each retroreflective elements tilts from the direction vertical to the basic plane, and a mirror reflective layer is formed on surfaces of prism side faces of the retroreflective 9lements. These retroreflective elements form a retroreflective element pair faced each other at the both sides of a shared base edge<br><br>
and the optical axis of the retroreflective element pair tilts in directions opposite to each other.<br>
Moreover, the official gazette of Stamm's Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Sho 49-106839 (specification of US Patent No. 3,712,706) discloses a retroreflective sheeting constituted by an assembly of normal triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements each of whose bottom planes is an equilateral triangle and on each of whose reflection-side surfaces a mirror reflective layer is formed. The optical axis of each of the retroreflective elements is vertical to the bottom plane of the elements.<br>
The triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements in the above two proposals respectively have a mirror reflective layer on surfaces of their prism side faces. Therefore, incoming light hardly passes through retroreflective elements but it is substantially Bntirely reflected. ThereforeFwhen comparing the above retroreflective elements with triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements having no mirror reflective layer according to jnly the internal total reflection theory, all rays to be retroreflected jreatly increase and are superior in entrance angularity.<br>
However, CC reflective elements designed so that the optical ixis tilts have a problem that differences between areas of three •eflective side faces (faces a, b, and c) excessively increase and the •etroreflective performance is deteriorated.<br>
The present inventor et al. have found in recent years that it is )ossible to improve the entrance angularity of a retroreflective heeting constituted by the above retroreflective elements by substantially making the depth (h')[equal to the height of apexes (Hi and H2) from the bottom plane (X-X')] of the elements of a face (face c) having a base edge on the bottom plane (X-X') of the retroreflective elements substantially larger than the depth (h) of a face (virtual face Z-Z') including base edges (z, and w) of two faces substantially perpendicularly crossing with the face c of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements from the apexes. The invention of the present inventor et al. is disclosed in the official gazette of Patent No. 2954709.<br><br>
However, also in the case of these elements, the trouble is not solved that when the entrance angle of entrance rays increases, the internal total-reflection condition is not satisfied and the entrance light does not reflect on the reflection side face but it passes through elements.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements (CC reflective elements) superior in retroreflective performance at an entrance angle of 30° or more, preferably at an angle of 40° or more.<br>
According to the present invention, the above object and advantage are achieved by triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements characterized in that the triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements protruding beyond a common bottom plane (Sx-SxO share one base edge (x) on the bottom plane (Sx-SxO and are arranged in the closest-packed state so as to be faced each other, the bottom plane (Sx-SxO is a common plane including a plurality of the base edges (x,x,...) shared by the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements, two triangular-pyramidal reflective elements faced each other include the shared base edges (x,x,...) on the bottom plane (Sx-Sx') and form a substantially same-shape element pair faced each other so as to be symmetric to planes (Lx-Lx, Lx-Lx,...) vertical to the bottom plane (Sx-SxO, and when assuming the height from the bottom plane (Sx-SxO including the base edges (x,x,...) shared by the two triangular-pyramidal reflective elements faced each other up to apexes (Hi and H2) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements as hx, the height from a bottom plane (Sy-Sy') including other base edges (y,y,...) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements up to the apexes (Hi and H2) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements as hy, and the height from a bottom plane (Sz-SzO including still other base edges (z,z,...) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements up to the apexes (Hi and H2) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements as hz, at least any two of hx, hy, and hz are substantially different from each other and a<br><br>
mirror reflective layer is formed on reflective side faces of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements.<br>
In the case of the present invention, triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements are preferable in which the optical axis of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements tilts so that the angle formed between the optical axis and a vertical line extended from apexes (Hi and H2) of the elements to the bottom plane (Sx-SxO of the optical axis ranges between 0.5° and 12° in the direction for the difference (q-p) between the distance (q) from the intersection (Q) of the optical axis and the bottom plane (Sx-Sx') up to base edges (x,x,...) shared by the element pair and the distance (p) from the intersection (P) of the vertical line and the bottom plane (Sx-Sx') up to the base edges (x,x,...) shared by the element pair to become plus (-1-) or minus (-).<br>
In the case of the present invention, triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements are preferable in which the optical axis of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements tilts so that the angle formed between the optical axis and the above vertical line ranges between 0.5° and 1.5°.<br>
In the case of the present invention, triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements are also preferable in which the optical axis of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements tilts so that the angle formed between the optical axis and the above vertical line ranges between 4° and 12°.<br>
More preferable triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements of the present invention are triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements in which the optical axis of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements tilts in the direction for the difference (q-p) between the distance (q) from the intersection (Q) of the optical axis and the bottom plane (Sx-SxO up to base edges (x,x,...) shared by the element pair and the distance (p) from the intersection (P) of a vertical line extended from apexes (Hi and H2) of the elements to the bottom plane (Sx-Sx) and the bottom plane (Sx-Sx') up to the base edges (x,x,...) shared by the element pair to become plus (-*-) and hx is substantially larger than hy and hz.<br><br>
Still more preferable triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements of the present invention are triangular cube-corner retroreflective elements in which the above hy and hz are substantially equal to each other and hx is substantially larger than hy and hz.<br>
Still more preferable triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements of the present invention are triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements in which the optical axis of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements tilts in the direction for the difference (q-p) between the distance (q) from the intersection (Q) of the optical axis and the bottom plane (Sx-SxO up to base edges (x,x,...) shared by the element pair and the distance (p) from the intersection (P) of a vertical line extended from apexes (Hi and H2) of the elements to the bottom plane (Sx-Sx) and the bottom plane (Sx-SxO up to base edges (x,x,...) shared by the element pair to become minus (-) and hx is substantially smaller than hy and hz.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
FIG. 1 and FIGs. 2(a) and 2(b) show one mode of a pair of triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements Ri and R2. FIG. 1 is a top view of a CC retroreflective body in which CC reflective elements are arranged, FIG. 2(a) is a top view showing a pair of the CC reflective elements shown in FIG. 1, and FIG. 2(b) is a sectional view of the reflective elements Ri and R2 cut at a plane<br><br>
vertical to a common bottom plane (Sx-SxO including points C2, H2, Hi, and Ci in FIG. 2(a) and base edges (x,x,...) shared by many pairs of reflective elements.<br>
In FIG. 1, ai, bi, ci, a2, b2, and C2 denote arranged reflective elements such as reflection side faces of the reflective elements Ri and R2 in FIG. 2(a), x denotes an adjacent reflective element such as base edge shared by the reflection side faces (face ci) and (face C2) of Ri and R2, y denotes a base edge shared by a reflection side face (face bi) and another reflection side face (face b2) of an adjacent reflective element separate from Ri and R2, and z denotes a base edge shared by still another reflection side faces (ai) and (a2) of a separate adjacent reflective element. Adjacent reflective elements sharing the above base edges (x,x,...) form a substantially-same-shaped element pair including the above base edges (x,x,...) and faced each other so as to be substantially symmetric to planes (Lx-Lx, Lx-Lx,...) vertical to the bottom plane (Sx-SxO and are arranged on the bottom plane (Sx-SxO in the closest-packed state so as to be faced each other.<br>
Moreover, in FIGs. 2(a) and 2(b), Hi and H2 denote apexes of cube corners of the reflective elements Ri and R2, a dotted line (Hi-P) denotes a vertical line extended from the apex Hi of the reflective element Ri to the bottom plane (Sx-Sx), and a dotted line (Hi-Q) denotes an optical axis passing through the apex Hi of the reflective element Ri. Therefore, the tilt of the optical axis of the reflective element Ri is shown by 0.<br>
The line x-x in FIG. 2(a) shows one base edge (x,x,...) shared by reflective elements Ri and R2 on one bottom plane (Sx-SxO shared by the CC reflective elements Ri and R2. In FIG. 2(b), the intersection of the vertical line extended from apexes of the reflective elements to the bottom plane (Sx-SxO and the bottom plane (Sx-Sx') is shown by P and the intersection of the optical axis through the apex Hi of the reflective element Ri and the bottom plane (Sx-Sx') is shown by Q.<br>
In FIG.2 (b), the plane (Lx-Lx) is a plane including a base edge (x) shared by the both elements Ri and R2 on a plane (Sx-Sx') shared by the reflective elements Ri and R2 and vertical to the shared plane<br>
(Sx-Sx')<br><br>
The reflective elements Ri and R2 form a substantially-same-shaped element pair faced each other so as to be substantially symmetric to the above plane (Lx-Lx) vertical to the bottom plane (Sx-SxO. The same is appUed to FIGs. 3(a) and 3(b) to be described later.<br>
In the case of the present invention, the fact that the tilt [angle from the vertical line (Hi-P)] of the optical axis (Hi-Q) of a reflective element such as the reflective element Ri is plus (-1-) denotes that (q-p) is plus (+), the fact that the tilt is minus (-) denotes that (q-p) is minus (-), and the fact that (q-p) is equal to 0 denotes that the optical axis is orthogonal to the common bottom plane (Sx-Sx') including base edges (x,x,...) of many reflective element pairs.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2(b), optical axes (Hi-Q and H2-Q) of the CC reflective element pair tilt in the direction for the difference (q-p) between the distance (p) from the intersection (F) of the vertical line extended from the apexes (Hi and H2) of the CC reflective elements to the bottom plane (Sx-Sx') and the bottom plane (Sx-Sx') up to the base edge (x) shared by the CC reflective element pair and the distance (q) from the intersection (Q) of the optical axis and the bottom plane (Sx-Sx') up to the base edge (x) shared by the CC reflective element pair to become plus (-1-).<br>
Moreover, in FIG. 2(b), the dotted line (Sx-Sx') denotes a bottom plane including many base edges (x,x,...), the dotted line Sy-Sy' denotes a bottom plane including many base edges (y,y,...), and the dotted line Sz-Sz' denotes a bottom plane including many base edges (z,z,...). Moreover, hx denotes the height from the bottom plane (Sx-Sx') including base edges (x,x,...) shared by two triangular-pyramidal reflective elements faced each other up to apexes (Hi, and H2) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements, hy denotes the height from the bottom plane (Sy-Sy') including other base edges (y,y,...) up to apexes (Hi and H2) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements, and hz denotes the height from the bottom plane (Sz-Sz') including still other base edges (z,z,,..) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements up to apexes (Hi and H2) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements.<br><br>
the present invention, the bottom plane (Sx-SxO is present at a position lower than the bottom planes (Sy-Sy') and (Sz-SzO and the bottom planes (Sy-S/) and (Sz-SzO are present on the same plane. That is, hx is larger than hy and hz and hy and hz are equal to each other.<br>
Therefore, the reflection side faces (ai and ^2) and (bi and b2) have shapes slightly cut out by reflection side faces (ci and C2), reflection side faces (ai and 32) and (bi and hz) are quadrangular, and reflection side faces (ci and C2) are pentagonal.<br>
A mirror reflective layer (4) is formed on surfaces of reflection side faces (ai and a2), (bi and hz), and (ci and 02) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements.<br>
FIGs. 3(a) and 3(b) show still another mode of a pair of triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements (CC reflective elements) Ri and R2 of the present invention, in which FIG. 3(a) is a top view of one of the reflective elements and FIG. 3(b) is a sectional view of reflective elements R2 and Ri vertical to the common bottom plane (Sx-Sx') including base edges (x,x,...) including points C2, H2, Hi, and Ci of FIG. 3(a) and shared by many reflective element pairs.<br>
In FIGs. 3(a) and 3(b), the bottom plane (Sx-Sx) including the base edges (x,x,...) is present at a position higher than the bottom plane (Sy-SyO including the base edges (y,y,...) and the bottom plane (Sz-SzO including the base edges (z,z,...) and the bottom planes (Sy-SyO and (Sz-SzO are present on the same plane. That is, hx is smaller than hy and hz and hy and hz are equal to each other.<br>
Therefore, reflection side faces (ci and C2) have shapes slight cut out by reflection side faces (ai and a2) and (bi and b2), reflection side faces (ai and az) and (bi and b2) are quadrangular, and reflection side faces (ci and C2) are triangular.<br>
Moreover, as shown in FIG. 3(b), optical axes (Hi-Q and H2-Q) of the CC reflective element pair tilt in the direction for the difference (q-p) between the distance (p) from the intersection (P) of vertical hnes (Hi-P and H2-P) extended from apexes (Hi and H2) of the CC reflective elements to the bottom plane (Sx-Sx) and the bottom plane<br><br>
(Sx-Sx') up to the base edge (x) shared by the CC reflective element pair and the distance (q) from the intersection (Q) of the optical axes and the bottom plane (Sx-Sx) up to the base edge (x) shared by the CC reflective element pair to become minus (-).<br>
The present invention relates to triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements characterized in that triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements protruding beyond a common bottom plane (Sx-Sx') share one base edge (x) on the bottom plane (Sx-Sx') and are arranged in the closest-packed state so as to be faced each other, the bottom plane (Sx-Sx') is a common plane including a plurality of the base edges (x,x,...) shared by the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements, two triangular-pyramidal reflective elements faced each other include the shared base edges (x,x,...) on the bottom plane (Sx-Sx') and form a substantially same-shape element pair faced each other so as to be symmetric to planes (Lx-Lx, Lx-Lx,...) vertical to the bottom plane (Sx-Sx'), and when assuming the height from the bottom plane (Sx-Sx') including the base edges (x,x,...) shared by the two triangular-pyramidal reflective elements faced each other up to apexes (Hi and H2) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements as hx, the height from a bottom plane (Sy-Sy') including other base edges (y,y,...) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements up to the apexes (Hi and H2) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements as hy, and the height from a bottom plane (Sz-Sz') including still other base edges (z,z,...) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements up to the apexes (Hi and H2) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements as hz, at least any two of hx, hy, and hz are substantially different from each other and a mirror reflective layer is formed on reflective side faces of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements.<br>
It is allowed that any one of the heights hx, hy, and hx of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements is different from others. However, to improve the entrance angularity, the heights can be properly selected so as to become large or small so that areas of reflection side faces (ai, bi, and ci and a2, b2, and C2) become equal to each other.<br><br>
When the optical axis of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements tilts in the direction for the difference (q-p) between the distance (q) from the intersection (Q) of the optical axis and the bottom plane (Sx-SxO up to base edges (x,x,...) shared by the element pair and the distance (p) from the intersection (P) of the vertical line extended from the apexes (Hi and H2) of the elements to the bottom plane (Sx-Sx') and the bottom plane (Sx-Sx) up to the base edges (x,x,...) shared by the element pair to become plus (+), it is more preferable that hx is substantially larger than hy and hz. However, when the optical axis tilts in the direction for (q-p) to become minus (-), it is still more preferable that hx is substantially smaller than hy and hz.<br>
Moreover, when at least two of the above hx, hy, and hz are substantially different from each other and it is assumed that the maximum one of the hx, hy, and hz is hmax and the minimum one of them is hmin, it is preferable that the following expression is effectuated.<br>
1.03 
And it is more preferable that the following expression is effectuated.<br>
1.05 
In the case of CC reflective elements meeting the above hmax/hmin, it is possible to almost equalize areas of three reflection side faces (cl and c2), (al and a2), and (bl and b2) of the CC reflective elements and thereby improve the retroreflective performance of three-face-reflecting and retroreflecting.<br>
It is preferable that the heights hx, hy, and hz of the above CC reflective elements range between 50 and 500 μm and more preferable that they range between 60 and 200 μm. When any one of the heights hx, hy, and hz is less than 50 μm, retroreflected light excessively diverges and the front brightness characteristic is<br><br>
deteriorated. However, when any one of the heights hx, hy, and hz exceeds 500 μm, this is not preferable because the thickness of a sheeting becomes excessively large and a soft sheeting is not easily obtained.<br>
In the case of the present invention, it is preferable that triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements have an optical axis tilting by 0.5° to 12°.<br>
When triangular-pyramidal reflective elements superior in rotation angularity are necessary, it is preferable that the tilt of the above optical axis ranges between 0.5° and 1.5° and more preferable that the tilt ranges between 0.6° and 1.4°.<br>
When triangular-pyramidal reflective elements superior in entrance angularity are necessary, it is preferable that the tilt of the above optical axis ranges between 4° and 12° and more preferable that the tilt ranges between 5° and 10°.<br>
Though three prism face angles formed when three reflection side faces (al, bl, and cl) or (a2, b2, and c2) serving as prism faces of CC reflective elements cross each other substantially become orthogonal, it is preferable that they are not always strictly orthogonal (90.000°) to each other but it is preferable to provide a very-slight angular deviation from a right angle. By providing a very-slight angular deviation to the prism face angles, it is possible to properly diverge the light reflected from obtained CC reflective elements. However, when the angular deviation is excessively increased, the light reflected from the obtained CC reflective element is excessively diverged and the retroreflective performance is deteriorated. Therefore, it is preferable that at least one prism face angle formed when these three reflection side faces (al, b, and cl) or (a2, b2, and c2) cross each other generally ranges between 89.5° and 90.5° and more preferable that the angle ranges between 89.7° and 90.3° and is slightly deviated from 90.000°.<br>
It is allowed to use any type of mirror reflective layer as a mirror reflective layer on the surface of retroreflective elements of the present invention and the type is not restricted. However, it is<br><br>
preferable to use a mirror reflective layer made of a metal such as aluminum, copper, silver, or nickel.<br>
It is preferable that the thickness of a mirror reflective layer ranges between 800 and 1,500 A. When the thickness of the mirror reflective layer is 800 A or more, this is preferable because the reflection efficiency of the mirror reflective layer is sufficient and the quantity of light passing through the layer is very little. When the thickness is 800 A or less, this is preferable because the retroreflective efficiency is not deteriorate or the appearance does not become dark.<br>
Many triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective elements of the present invention are collected and used as a CC retroreflective body. Moreover, it is allowed to form many CC reflective elements into a triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective sheeting and use it by setting it on an object such as a vehicle or traffic sign. Furthermore, it is allowed to use many CC reflective elements by directly forming them on an object. Therefore, though a mode to be used is not restricted, CC reflective elements are generally formed into a sheeting and used.<br>
Then, a mode of a preferable structure of a triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective sheeting on which CC reflective elements of the present invention are arranged is described below by referring to FIG. 4 showing a sectional view of the mode.<br>
In FIG. 4, symbol 3 denotes a reflective element layer on which triangular-pyramidal reflective elements (Ri and R2)(7) of the present invention are arranged in the closest-packed state, 4 denotes a mirror reflective layer present on the reflection side face of the reflective elements, and 8 denotes an entrance direction of light. It is possible to provide a surface protective layer (l), a print layer (2) for communicating information to an observer or coloring a sheeting, an adhesive layer (5) used to attach a retroreflective sheeting to other structure, and a stripping-material layer (6) for protecting the adhesive layer (5) until the retroreflective sheeting is attached.<br>
It is possible to use a resin same as that used for a retroreflective element layer (3) for the above surface protective layer<br><br>
vi/. moreover, to improve the weather resistance, it is possible to use any one of an ultraviolet absorbing agent, light stabilizer, and anti-oxidizing agent or use a combination of them.<br>
It is generally possible to set the print layer (2) between the surface protective layer (l) and the retroreflective element (3), on the surface of the light-entrance side of the surface protective layer (l) or between reflection side faces (a, b, and c) and a mirror reflective layer. In general, it is possible to set the print layer (2) by means of gravure printing, screen printing, or ink-jet printing.<br>
It is possible to properly select a publicly-known material for the adhesive layer (5) and stripping-material layer (6) used for the adhesive used to attach a retroreflective sheeting of the present invention to a metallic plate, wooden plate, glass plate, or plastic plate.<br>
A triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective sheeting on which CC reflective elements of the present invention are arranged is used so that light (8) comes in from the top of the surface protective layer (l). Therefore, it is possible to manufacture the above retroreflective sheeting by using a cube-corner molding die in which the above CC reflective elements are arranged on a metallic belt as concave shapes obtained by reversing shapes of the CC reflective elements, heating a soft proper resin sheeting superior in optical transparency and uniformity and pressing the resin sheeting to be described later against the molding die, reversing and transferring the shape of the die to the resin sheeting to obtain a substrate sheeting, and forming a mirror reflective layer on the substrate sheeting in accordance with, for example, a method such as aluminizing.<br>
Typical manufacturing methods of the above cube-corner molding die are described in, for example, the above Stamm's patent in detail. Also in the case of the present invention, it is possible to manufacture a mother die by a method conforming to the above publicly-known methods.<br>
The above mother die is also formed through copying as an electroforming die whose convex and concave portions are reversed<br><br>
by the electroforming method. A plurality of electroforming dies are accurately cut and then, the dies can be used by combining and joining them up to a final die size for molding a microprism sheeting with a synthetic resin.<br>
A combined electroforming die is used to mold a synthetic resin as a synthetic-resin-molding die. The synthetic-resin molding method can use compression molding or injection molding.<br>
The compression molding can be performed by inserting a formed thin-wall nickel electroforming die having a thickness of approx. 1 mm, a synthetic-resin sheeting having a predetermined thickness, and a silicone-rubber sheeting having a thickness of approx. 5 mm serving as a cushion material into a compression-molding press heated to a predetermined temperature and then, preheating the sheeting for 30 sec at a pressure of 10 to 20% of a molding pressure, then heating and pressuring the sheeting for ipprox. 2 min under conditions of 180° to 230°C and 10 to 30 kg/cm2. Thereafter, by cooling the sheeting up to room temperature while Dressing it and releasing the pressure, it is possible to obtain a nolded prism.<br>
Moreover, it is possible to obtain a continuous sheet-like )roduct by joining a thin-wall electroforming die having a thickness »f approx. 0.5 mm formed by the above method in accordance with he above welding method to form an endless belt die, and setting the lelt die to a pair of rollers constituted by a heating roller and a ooling roller and rotating the rollers, supplying melted synthetic esin to the belt die on the heating roller in the form of a melted heeting, pressure-molding the sheeting with one or more silicone oilers, then cooling the sheeting to a glass transition point or lower n the cooling roller, and removing the sheeting from the belt die.<br>
The synthetic resin which can be used to mold the above ubstrate sheeting is not restricted. However, it is preferable to use a ynthetic resin having optical transparency and uniformity such as ny one of polycarbonate resin, vinyl-chloride resin, (meth)acrylic esin, epoxy resin, styrene resin, polyester resin, fluorocarbon resin.<br><br>
olefin resin such as polyethylene resin or polypropylene resin, cellulose-based resin, and urethane resin.<br>
A triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective sheeting of the present invention allows a mirror reflective layer made of a metal such as aluminum, copper, silver, or nickel to be formed on the surface of the above substrate retroreflective elements thus obtained by using means such as vacuum deposition, chemical plating, or sputtering. Among methods for forming a mirror reflective layer, the vacuum deposition method using aluminum is preferable because a deposition temperature can be lowered and thereby a thermal deformation of retroreflective elements in a deposition step can be minimized and moreover, the color tone of an obtained mirror reflective layer becomes the most bright.<br>
A continuous deposition treatment apparatus for forming the above aluminum mirror reflective layer is constituted by a vacuum vessel in which a vacuum degree can be kept at approx. 7 to 9x10"^ mmHg, a delivery unit for delivering a prism raw sheeting formed by two layers such as a substrate sheeting set in the vacuum vessel and a surface protective layer formed on the surface of the light-incoming side of the substrate sheeting, a winding unit for winding a deposition-treated prism raw sheeting, and a heating unit set between the vacuum vessel and these units and capable of melting aluminum with an electric heater in a graphite crucible. Pure aluminum pellets having a purity of 99.99 wt% or more and granular metallic titanium are put in the graphite crucible so that the weight ratio is 100:1 so that they can be deposited on a reflection side face as a mirror reflective layer by aluminum atoms melted and evaporated at a voltage of 350 to 360 VAC, a current of 115 to 120 A, and a treatment rate of 30 to 70 m/min.<br>
A temperature of 950° to 1,100°C can be used as the above aluminum melting temperature.<br>
It is also possible to cool the deposition-treated prism raw sheeting with a water-cooling roller before it is wound on a roller by a winding unit.<br><br>
Moreover, it is possible to set a single prism raw sheeting in a bell-shaped vacuum vessel and vacuum-deposit the sheeting in the form of a single sheeting. The same condition as described above can be used as the deposition conditions in this case.<br>
It is possible to further set an adhesive layer and a stripping-material layer to cube-corner retroreflective elements provided with a mirror reflective layer after applying preservation treatment to the elements according to necessity.<br>
The present invention is further specifically described below in accordance with embodiments. Embodiment 1-<br>

Moreover, the ratio hmax/hmin between the maximum value hmax and minimum value h^in of heierhtq of the elements was 1.1.<br><br>
A convex cube-corner molding die which was made of nickel and whose shape was reversed was formed in accordance with the electroforming method by using the above brass mother die. A polycarbonate-resin sheeting ("lupilon H3000" made by Mitsubishi Engineering-Plastics Corp.) having a thickness 200 μm was compression-molded at a molding temperature of 200°C, a molding pressure of 50 kg/cm2, and a molding time of 3 min by using the above molding die and moreover, an acrylic film [Sanduren HBL008 made by Mitsubishi Rayon Co., Ltd.] was laminated under the same conditions. Thereafter, the resin sheeting was cooled up to 30°C while pressurized and then taken out to form a prism raw sheeting constituted by two layers such as a surface protective layer having a thickness of approx. 50 μm. and a reflective element layer on which cube corners whose support layer has a thickness of approx. 150μm and h of 80 μm were arranged in the closest-packed state.<br>
The prism raw sheeting was set to a vacuum deposition unit constituted by a heating unit capable of melting aluminum with an electric heater in a graphite crucible set in a vacuum vessel capable of keeping a vacuum degree at approx. OxlO"'* mmHg. Pure aluminum pellets having a purity of 99.99% or higher and granular metallic titanium were put in the graphite crucible so that the weight ratio between them was 100:1, and three reflection side faces of CC reflective elements were deposited as a mirror reflective layer with aluminum atoms vacuum-deposited and evaporated at a voltage of 350 VAC, a current of 115 to 120 A, and a processing time of 5 min.<br>
o<br>
In this case, the thickness of an aluminized film was 1,100 A.<br>
A triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective sheeting was formed by layering an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive (Nissetsu KP1818 made by Nippon Carbide Industries Co., Inc.) having a thickness of 60 μm and a stripping sheeting made of polypropylene having a thickness of 100 μm (made by Okura Industrial Co., Ltd.) on the deposition face of the deposition-treated prism raw sheeting. Embodiment 2'-<br><br>
Parallel grooves with V-shaped sectional form were cut on a 100 mm-square brass plate with the surface flatly cut in a first direction (y-direction in FIG. 1) and a second direction (z-direction in FIG. l) at a repetitive pattern in accordance with the fly cutting method by using a diamond cutting tool having a tip angle of 68.53° so that repetitive pitches in the first and second direction were 210.87 μm, depths (hy and hj of the grooves were 100 μm, and the crossing angle between the first and second directions was 58.76°.<br>
Thereafter, V-shaped parallel grooves were cut along a third direction (x-direction in FIG. 1) so that a repetitive pitch (repetitive pitch of line x in FIG. 2) was 214.92°, the depth (hx) of the grooves was 105 μm, and crossing angles between the first and second directions on one hand and the third direction on the other were 60.62° to form a mother die on which many convex triangular-pyramidal reflective elements respectively having a height (hx) of 105 fim from a virtual face (Sx-Sx) of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements were arranged in the closest-packed state on the brass plate. The optical-axis tilt angle 9 of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements was +1° and prism face angles of three faces constituting a triangular pyramid were all 90° and h max'nmin was 1.1.<br>
A triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective sheeting was formed by using the above brass mother die and the same method as the case of Embodiment 1. Comparative Example-<br>
Parallel grooves respectively having a V-shaped cross section were cut on a 100 mm-square brass plate with the surface flatly cut along a first direction (y-direction in FIG. l) and a second direction (z-direction in FIG. l) at a repetitive pattern in accordance with the fly cutting method so that repetitive pitches of the first and second directions were 169.71 μm, depths (hy and hz) of the grooves were 80 μm, and the crossing angle between the first and second directions was 60.00° by using a diamond cutting tool having a tip angle of 70.53°.<br>
Thereafter, V-shaped parallel grooves were cut in a third direction (x-direction in FIG. l) so that a repetitive pitch (repetitive<br><br>
pitch of line x in FIG. 2&gt; was 169.71μm, the depth (hx) of the grooves was 80 μm, and crossing angles between the first and second direction on one hand and the third direction on the other were 60.00° by using a diamond cutting tool having a tip angle of 77.04° to form a mother die on which many convex triangular-pyramidal cube corners having a height (hx) of 80 μm from the virtual face (Sx-Sx') of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements were arranged in the closest-packed state on the brass plate. The optical-axis tilt angle 9 of the triangular-pyramidal reflective elements was -i-7°, prism face angles of three reflection side faces constituting a triangular pyramid were 90°, and heights of the elements were all equal to each other. A triangular-pyramidal cube-corner retroreflective sheeting was formed by using the above brass mother die and the same method as the case of Embodiment 1.<br>
Table 1 shows values obtained by measuring retroreflection coefficients of triangular-pyramidal retroreflective sheetings prepared for the above Embodiments 1 and 2 and Comparative Example [every unit of reflection brightness is (cd/Lx*m2).]<br>
The retroreflection coefficients were measured in accordance with the photometric measuring method specified in JIS Z 8714 "Retroreflectors-Optical properties-Measuring method" by setting combinations of observation angles and entrance angles to 0.2°/5° and 0.2°/30°.<br>
To observe entrance angularities of triangular-pyramidal retroreflective sheetings prepared for the above Embodiments 1 and 2 and Comparative Example, retroreflection coefficients of various samples were measured by changing entrance angles from 5° to 10°, 20°, 30°, 40°, and 50° at an observation angle of 0.2°. In FIG. 5, entrance angles are assigned to the abscissa and the ordinate shows values obtained by dividing retroreflection coefficients at various entrance angles by the retroreflection coefficient at an entrance angle of 5° as brightness change rates.<br>
From Table 1 and FIG. 5, it is found that the retroreflective sheetings prepared for Embodiments 1 and 2 of the present invention are extremely superior in reflection performance particularly at<br><br>
entrance angles of 10° to 30° for which visibility is particularly requested on a traffic sign and the reflection performance is superior to the reflection performance at the front (entrance angle of 5°.)<br>
The above characteristic makes it possible to extremely improve the visibility from a vehicle running on an adjacent roadway.<br>
However, in the case of the retroreflective sheeting prepared for Comparative Example, the reflection performance is deteriorated as an entrance angle increases and inferior to the reflection performance at the front (entrance angle of 5°) at entrance angles of 10° to 30° at which the visibility is important in the case of a traffic sign.<br><br>
