DESCRIPTION<br>
NITROGENOUS    HETEROCYCLIC    DERIVATIVE   AND    ORGANIC ELECTROLUMINESCENT ELEMENT EMPLOYING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel nitrogenous heterocyclic derivative, i.e., a novel derivative of heterocyclic compound having nitrogen atom and to an organic electroluminescent device (an electroluminescent device will be referred to as an electroluminescence device, hereinafter) which utilizes the novel compound. More particularly, the present invention relates to a derivative of heterocyclic compound having nitrogen atom useful as constituting component of an organic electroluminescence ("electroluminescence" will be occasionally referred to as "EL", hereinafter) device, i.e., an organic EL device achieving elevation of luminance and of efficiency in light emission even under low driving voltage, and also achieving long term stabilization by improvement of an electrode adhesion in accordance with an employment of the derivative of heterocyclic compound having nitrogen atom for at least one layer composing organic compound layers of the EL device.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
An organic electroluminescence device is a spontaneous light emitting device which utilizes the principle that a fluorescent substance emits light by energy of recombination of holes injected from an anode and electrons injected from a cathode when an electric field is applied. Since<br><br>
an organic EL device of the laminate type driven under a low electric voltage was reported by C. W. Tang of Eastman Kodak Company (C. W. Tang and S. A. Vanslyke, Applied Physics Letters, Volume 51, Pages 913, 1987), many studies have been conducted on organic EL devices using organic materials as the constituting materials. Tang et al. used a laminate structure using tris(8_hydroxyquinolinol)aluminum for the light emitting layer and a triphenyldiamine derivative for the hole transporting layer. Advantages of the laminate structure are that the efficiency of hole injection into the light emitting layer can be increased, that the efficiency of forming excited particles which are formed by blocking and recombining electrons injected from the cathode can be increased, and that excited particles formed among the light emitting layer can be enclosed.<br>
As the structure of the organic EL device, a two-layered structure having a hole transporting (injecting) layer and an electron transporting and light emitting layer and a three-layered structure having a hole transporting (injecting) layer, a light emitting layer and an electron transporting (injecting) layer are well known. To increase the efficiency of recombination of injected holes and electrons in the devices of the laminate type, the structure of the device and the process for forming the device have been studied.<br>
Conventionally, trials for raising efficiency of light emission of the organic EL device by providing an electron injecting/transporting layer have been repeated. In this case, there were drawbacks that formation of exciplex was found, and that lifetime of light emission was short in spite of obtaining highly illuminant light emission. Further, a long time electric drive   caused   separation   between   a   metal-electrode   and   an   organic<br><br>
compound or crystallization of the organic compound layer and the electrode resultantly whitening, further decreasing luminance of light emission, and it was necessary to prevent such a phenomena.<br>
As the examples of heterocyclic compound having nitrogen atom such as pyrazine compound, quinoline compound, quinoxaline compound and so on employed as a constituting component of the organic EL device, there are 2,3,5,6-tetraphenyl pyrazine, 2,3,4-triphenyl quinoline and 2,3-diphenyl quinoxaline that are all disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,077,142. However, because melting points of these compounds is low, there were disadvantages of such as inviting unfavorable fact such that even employing these compounds as amorphous thin-film layer of the organic EL device soon induces crystallization and disturbs light emission almost at all. Also, there were disadvantages that an electric drive caused the above separation, which made the lifetime short.<br>
Furthermore, a blue-light'emitting device with the use of a heterocyclic compound having nitrogen atom is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-6877, and an organic EL device with the use of a heterocyclic compound having nitrogen atom for a light emitting material or a hole injection transport material is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-35664. The invention of Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-6877 provides blue-light emission having peak wave-length in 430 to 480 nm, and the invention of Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-35664 provides a luminance of about 500 cd/m2 under the application of an electric voltage of 6 V when using the heterocyclic compound having nitrogen atom as hole injection<br><br>
material, and also provides a luminance of about 2300 cd/m2 under the application of electric voltage of 12 V when using the compound as a light emitting material. However, the voltage was too high to keep practical performance and an organic EL device having excellent efficiency of light emission under the application of lower electric voltage was required.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a novel derivative of heterocyclic compound having nitrogen atom useful as a constitutional component of an organic EL device. Another object of the present invention is to provide an organic EL device achieving elevation of luminance and of efficiency in light emission and also achieving long lifetime by improvement of an electrode adhesion in accordance with an employment of the derivative of heterocyclic compound having nitrogen atom for at least one layer composing organic compound layers of the EL device.<br>
As a result of intensive researches and studies to achieve the above object by the present inventors, a derivative of heterocyclic compound having nitrogen atom was found to be a novel compound with specific structure useful as a material for an organic El device. Further, employing the compound as a component of at least one layer (in particular, electron injecting layer) in organic compound layers of an organic EL device was also found enabling to achieve elevation of luminance and of efficiency in light emission and also to achieve long lifetime by improvement of an electrode adhesion. Such being the case, the present invention has been accomplished on the basis of the foregoing findings and information.<br><br>

Among the above constructions, construction (8) is preferable. However, the construction of the organic EL device is not limited to those shown above as the examples.<br>
It is preferable for the organic EL device of the present invention to employ the compound of the present invention as a constituting material for the light emitting layer and/or the electron injecting layer. Although the hole injecting layer or the electron injecting layer is not always necessary for the device structure, an organic EL device having these layers has an advantage of improving light emitting property. Further, the hole injecting layer, the light emitting layer and the electron injecting layer may be mixedly sandwiched between a pair of electrodes. Furthermore, a mixed layer may be made with the use of a binder such as a high molecular compound in order that each constituting component exists stably.<br><br>
An explanation about an organic EL device of anode / hole injecting layer / light emitting layer / electron injecting layer / cathode type example of the present invention will be described hereinunder. In general, the organic EL device is produced on a substrate which transmits light. The substrate which transmits light is the substrate which supports the organic EL device. As the substrate which transmits light, for example, glass sheet, synthetic resin sheet and quortzes are advantageously employed. It is preferable that the substrate which transmits light has a transmittance of light of 50 % or greater in the visible region of 400 to 700 nm. It is also preferable that a flat and smooth substrate is employed.<br>
As the anode, an electrode made of a material such as a metal, an alloy, a conductive compound and a mixture of these materials which has a great work function (4 eV or more) is preferable. Specific examples of the material for the anode include metals such as Au and conductive materials such as Cul, ITO (indium tin oxide), Sn02, ZnO and In-Zn-O. The anode can be prepared by forming a thin film of the electrode material described above in accordance with a process such as the vapor deposition process and the sputtering process. When the hght emitted from the Ught emitting layer is obtained through the anode, it is preferable that the anode has a transmittance of the emitted light greater than 10%. It is also preferable that the sheet resistivity of the anode is several hundred Q / □ or smaller. The thickness of the anode is, in general, selected in the range of from 10 nm to 1 m and preferably in the range of from 10 to 200 nm although the preferable range may be different depending on the adopted material.<br>
As the cathode, an electrode made of a material such as a metal, an<br><br>
alloy, a conductive compound and a mixture of these materials which has a small work function (4 eV or smaller) is employed. Specific examples of the material for the cathode include sodium, sodium-potassium alloys, magnesium, magnesium-silver alloys, lithium, magnesium/copper mixture, magnesium-indium alloys, AI/AI2O3, indium, aluminum-lithium alloys, etc. The cathode can be prepared by forming a thin film of the electrode material described above in accordance with a process such as the vapor deposition process and the sputtering process. It is also preferable that the sheet resistivity of the cathode is several hundred Q/ D or smaller. The thickness of the cathode is, in general, selected in the range of from 10 nm to 500 nm and preferably in the range of from 50 to 200 nm. Additionally, it is convenient that either the anode or the cathode of the organic EL device is transparent or translucent in order to transmit light because an efficiency of light emission improves.<br>
In the organic EL device of the present invention, it is preferable that a layer of a chalcogenide, a metal halide or a metal oxide (this layer may occasionally be referred to as a surface layer) is disposed on the surface of at least one of the pair of electrodes prepared as described above. Specifically, it is preferable that a layer of a chalcogenide (including an oxide) of a metal such as silicon and aluminum is disposed on the surface of the anode at the side of the light emitting layer, and a layer of a metal halide or a metal oxide is disposed on the surface of the cathode at the side of the light emitting layer. Due to the above layers, stability in driving can be improved-Preferable examples of the chalcogenide include SiOx (l^x^2), AlOx (l^xgl.5), SiON and SiAlON. Preferable examples of the metal<br><br>
halide include LiF, MgF2, CaF2 and fluorides of rare earth metals. Preferable examples of the metal oxide include CS2O, Li20, MgO, SrO, BaO and CaO.<br>
In the organic EL device of the present invention, it is preferable that a mixed region of an electron transfer compound and a reductive dopant or a mixed region of a hole transfer compound and an oxidizing dopant is disposed on the surface of at least one of the pair of electrodes prepared as described above. Due to the mixed region disposed as described above, the electron transfer compound is reduced to form an anion, and injection and transportation of electrons from the mixed region into the light emitting medium can be facilitated. The hole transfer compound is oxidized to form a cation, and injection and transportation of holes from the mixed region into the light emitting medium is facilitated. Preferable examples of the oxidizing dopant include various types of Lewis acid and acceptor compounds. Preferable examples of the reductive dopant include alkali metals, compounds of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, rare earth metals and compounds of these metals.<br>
In the organic EL device of the present invention, the light emitting layer has the following functions:<br>
(1)	The injecting function^ the function of injecting holes from the anode or<br>
the hole injecting layer and injecting electrons from the cathode or the<br>
electron injecting layer when an electric field is applied;<br>
(2)	The transporting function: the function of transporting injected charges (electrons and holes) by the force of the electric field; and<br>
(3)	The light emitting function^ the function of providing the field for recombination of electrons and holes and leading the recombination to the<br><br>
emission of light.<br>
It is preferable to employ the foregoing compound of the present invention as the light emitting material composing the light emitting layer in the organic EL device of the present invention. In the case where the compound of the present invention is employed as the light emitting material, the compound may be used alone or in combination with any of publicly known light emitting materials. In the case where the compound of the present invention is employed for other than the light emitting layer, the light emitting material in the light emitting layer is not particularly restricted but may be selectively employed in option from among the conventional well known light emitting materials. For example, polycyclic condensed aromatics, fluorescent whitening agents such as benzoxazole base, benzothiazole base, benzimidazole base or so, and compounds having favorable thin film formation property such as metal chelated oxanoid compound, distyrylbenzene_based compound and so on are employed as the light emitting material. Examples of the polycyclic condensed aromatics include condensed ring light emitting substances containing anthracene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene, chrysene and perylene backbone structure, other condensed ring light emitting substances containing about 8 condensed rings, etc. Specifically, 1,1,4,4-tetraphenyM ,3-butadiene, 4,4'-(2,2-diphenyl vinyl) biphenyl and so on are employable as the light emitting material. The light emitting layer may be composed of single layer comprising one or more kind of these light emitting materials or may be laminated with a light emitting layer comprising another kind of compound.<br>
As the process for forming the light emitting layer, a well known<br><br>
process such as the vapor deposition process, the spin coating process and the LB process can be employed. It is particularly preferable that the light emitting layer is a molecular deposit film. The molecular deposit film is a thin film formed by deposition of a material compound in the gas phase or a thin film formed by solidification of a material compound in a solution or in the liquid phase. In general, the molecular deposit film can be distinguished from the thin film formed in accordance with the LB process (the molecular accumulation film) based on the differences in the aggregation structure and higher order structures and functional differences caused by these structural differences.<br>
As disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Laid-Open No. Shou 57(1982)-51781, the bight emitting layer can also be formed by dissolving a binder such as a resin and the material compounds into a solvent to prepare a solution, followed by forming a thin film from the prepared solution in accordance with the spin coating process or the like.<br>
A hole injecting layer in the organic EL device of the present invention consists of a hole transfer compound, and is capable of transferring hole which is injected from the anode to the light emitting layer. By intervening the hole injecting layer between the anode and the light emitting layer, large numbers of holes are injected into the light emitting layer even though a relatively lower electric field is applied. Moreover, because electrons injected into the light emitting layer from the cathode or the electron injecting layer are, with the influence of an electronic barrier existing on interfacial area between the light emitting layer and the hole injecting layer,  a superior organic EL device with<br><br>
favorable light emitting property such as improving an efficiency of light emission can be obtained.<br>
The hole transfer compound used for such a hole injecting layer which is deployed between the two electrodes is capable of transferring holes adequately into the light emitting layer when the holes are injected from the anode. A compound which exhibits, for example, a mobility of holes of at least 10'6 cmW * second under application of an electric field of from 104 to 106 V/cm is preferable as the hole transfer compound. With regard to the hole transfer compound, it is not particularly specified as long as it has the above favorable light emitting property. Namely, any compound may be selectively employed as the hole transfer compound from among compounds such as used in custom as charge injection and charge transport material of holes among a light conducting material or publicly known as the hole injecting layer of the organic EL device.<br>
Examples of the above hole transfer compound include copper<br>
phthalocyanine,	N,N,N',N'tetraphenyl-4,4'-diaminophenyl,<br>
N,N'-diphenyl-N,N'-di (3-methylphenyl)-4,4'-diaminobiphenyl (TPDA),<br>
2,2-bis	(4-di-p-tolylaminophenyl)	propane,	l.lbis<br>
(4-di-p-tolylaminophenyl)	cyclohexane,	N,N,N',N'-tetra-p-tolyl-4,<br>
4'-diaminobiphenyl, etc. Further, crystals of inorganic semiconductor such as Si, SiC or CdS and amorphous material may be also employed as the hole transfer compound. The hole injecting layer may be composed of single layer comprising one or more kind of these hole injecting materials or may be laminated with a hole injecting layer comprising another kind of compound.<br>
To form the hole injecting layer or the hole transporting layer, a<br><br>
thin film may be formed from the material for the hole injecting layer or the hole transporting layer, respectively, in accordance with a well known process such as the vacuum vapor deposition process, the spin coating process, the casting process and the LB process. Although the thickness of the hole injecting layer and the hole transporting layer is not particularly limited, the thickness is usually from 5 nm to5  ym.<br>
An electron injecting layer in the organic EL device of the present invention consists of an electron transfer material, and is capable of transferring electron which is injected from the cathode to the light emitting layer. In the organic EL device of the present invention, it is preferable to employ the foregoing compound of the present invention as the electron injecting material.<br>
In the case where the compound of the present invention is employed for other than the electron injecting layer, the electron injecting material is not particularly restricted but may be selectively employed in option from among the conventional well known electron injecting material compounds. The reductive dopant used in the present invention is defined as a compound which is added to the interfacial region between the electron injecting layer and the cathode and enhances the effect of electron injection. In the present invention, an organic EL device containing a reductive dopant among the compound of the present invention is preferable. The reductive dopant is defined as the substance capable of reducing an electron transporting compound. Therefore, various substances with some extent of reductive property are employable as the reductive dopant. Examples of the reductive dopant include at least one compound  selected from  alkali metals,  alkali  metal complexes,  alkali<br><br>
metal compounds, alkaline earth metals, alkaline earth metal complexes, alkaline earth metal compounds, rare earth metals, rare earth metal complexes and rare earth metal compounds.<br>
Examples of the alkali metal include Na (the work function: 2.36 eV), K (the work function: 2.28 eV), Rb (the work function: 2.16 eV) and Cs (the work function: 1.95 eV).<br>
Examples of the alkaline earth metal include Ca (the work function: 2.9 eV), Sr {the work function: 2.0 to 2.5 eV) and Ba (the work function: 2.52 eV).<br>
Examples of the rare earth metal include Sc, Y, Eu, Tb, Ce, eta.<br>
Examples of the alkali metal compound described above include alkali metal oxides such as IJ20, CS2O, NaO, etc., and alkali metal halides such as LiF, NaF, KF, LiCl, KC1, NaCl, etc.<br>
Examples of the alkaline earth metal oxide include CaO, BaO, SrO, BeO, etc.<br>
Examples of the alkahne earth metal halide include fluorides such as CaF2, BaF2, SrFa, MgF2 and BeF2, or halides except the fluorides.<br>
Preferable reductive dopant has a work function of 2.9 eV or smaller. Specific examples of preferable reductive dopant include at least one kind or more of the alkaline metal selected from a group consisting of Na (the work function: 2.36 eV), K (the work function: 2.28 eV), Rb (the work function: 2.16 eV) and Cs (the work function: 1.95 eV). Further, the examples include at least one kind or more of the alkaline earth metal selected from a group consisting of Ca (the work function: 2.9 eV), Sr (the work function: 2.0 - 2.5 eV) and Ba (the work function: 2.52 eV). Among these, more preferable reductive dopants include at least one kind or more<br><br>
selected from the group consisting of K, Rb and Cs, the latter Rb or Cs being farther more preferable and the last Cs being the most preferable. These alkaline metals have particularly high reducing capability, and only an addition of relatively small amount of them into an electron injection zone enables to achieve both improvement of luminance and lifetime extension of the organic EL device. Further, a combination of two or more kinds of the alkaline metals is also preferable as the reductive dopant having the work function of 2.9 eV or smaller. In particular, a combination including Cs, for example, combinations of Cs and Na, Cs and K, Cs and Rb or Cs, Na and K are preferable. Containing Cs in combination enables to reveal reducing capability effectively, and the addition into the electron injection zone achieves both improvement of luminance and lifetime extension of the organic EL device. Also, aside from the alkali metals, even an employment of at least one or more kinds of metal compound selected from the group consisting of alkali metal chalcogenide, alkaline earth metal chalcogenide, halide of alkali metal and halide of alkaline earth metal also achieves similar effects. Still further, an employment of alkali metal organic complexes or alkaline earth metal organic complexes also achieves similar effects.<br>
In the organic EL device of the present invention, an electron injecting layer comprising electric insulating material, semiconductor and inorganic compound may be disposed between the cathode and the organic layer. The disposition of the electron injecting layer enables to effectively prevent a leak of electric current and to improve the electron injection property. It is preferable that at least one metal compound selected from the group consisting of alkali metal chalcogenides, alkaline earth metal<br><br>
chalcogenides, alkali metal halides and alkaline earth metal halides is used as the insulating material. It is preferable that the electron transporting layer is constituted with the above alkali metal chalcogenide since the electron injecting property can be improved. Preferable examples of the alkali metal chalcogenide include LizO, LiO, Na2S, Na2Se and NaO. Preferable examples of the alkaline earth metal chalcogenide include CaO, BaO, SrO, BeO, BaS and CaSe. Preferable examples of the alkali metal halide include LiF, NaF, KF, LiCl, KCl and NaCl. Preferable examples of the alkaline earth metal halide include fluorides such as CaF2, BaF2, SrF2, MgFa and BeF2and halides other than the fluorides.<br>

It is preferable that the inorganic compound constituting the electron injection layer is in the form of a fine crystalline or amorphous insulating thin film. When the electron injection layer is constituted with the above inorganic compound, a more uniform thin film can be formed and defective pixels such as dark spots can be decreased. Examples of the inorganic compound include the alkali metal chalcogenides, the alkaline earth metal chalcogenides, the alkali metal halides and the alkaline earth metal halides which are described above.<br>
The electron injecting layer in the organic EL device of the present invention can be formed in accordance with the publicly known thin-film formation method such as the vacuum vapor deposition process, the spin coating process,  the casting process or the LB process employing the<br><br>
compound of the present invention or other electron injection material. Although the thickness of the electron injecting layer is not particularly limited, the thickness is usually from 5 nm to 5 n m. The electron injecting layer may be composed of single layer comprising one or more kind of these electron injecting materials or may be laminated with an electron injecting layer comprising another kind of compound. Furthermore, inorganic hole injection materials such as p type-Si and p type-SiC, inorganic electron injection materials such as n type a -Si and n type a -SiC are employed as the electron injection material for composing electron injecting layer. Specific examples of the above electron injection material correspond to inorganic semiconductors disclosed in International Patent Publication No. WO 90/05998, etc.<br>
Following is a description regarding a preparing method about the organic EL device of the present invention. An explanation about an organic EL device of anode / hole injecting layer / light emitting layer / electron injecting layer / cathode type example of the present invention will be described as a preferred embodiment hereinunder. First, a thin film consisting of a desired electrode substance, for example, a substance for the anode is formed over a suitable substrate so as to finally achieve a film thickness of 1 (jmor thinner, preferably within a range from 10 nm to 200 nm in accordance with a vapor deposition method, a sputtering method, etc. Then, the hole injecting layer, the light emitting layer and the electron injecting layer which are all EL device composing elements are made by successively forming thin films consisting of each composing material into multi layers. With regard to a thin fdm formation process to be used, there are the spin coating process, the casting process or the<br><br>
vapor deposition process as the foregoing description. A vacuum vapor deposition process is preferable because a uniform film can be easily obtained and the possibility of formation of pin holes is small. In the case where the vacuum vapor deposition process is adopted as the thin film formation process, the vapor deposition condition is different according to the kind of the compound employed, a crystal structure or an association structure each as an object of molecular pile membrane. However, it is generally preferable to appropriately select among port heat temperature of 50 to 400 °C, vacuum of 10 6 to 10"3 Pa, vapor deposition rate of 0.01 to 50 nm/ second, substrate temperature of -50 to 300 °C, and film thickness of 5 nm to 5 y m respectively. After forming the above layers, a thin fdm consisting of a cathode substance is formed thereupon into a film thickness of 1 /imor thinner, preferably within a range from 50 to 200 nm, in accordance with, for example, the vapor deposition process or the sputtering process, thereby making cathode and resultantly obtaining a desired organic EL device. Additionally, in preparation of the organic EL device, reversing the formation order, a formation in order of the cathode, the electron injecting layer, the light emitting layer, the hole injecting (transporting) layer and the anode may be applicable.<br>
In the above production of the organic EL device, it is preferable that the above layers from the anode to the cathode are formed successively while the production system is kept in a vacuum after being evacuated.<br>
Further, a preparation of an organic EL device of the anode / the light emitting layer / the cathode type wherein a hole injecting layer, a light   emitting   layer   and   an   electron   injecting   layer   as   coexisting<br><br>
sandwiched between a pair of electrode is as the following: For example, forming a thin film consisting of anode substance over a suitable substrate, making a light emitting layer (or, a light emission area) by applying or dip coating a solution comprising a hole injection material, a light emitting material, electron injection material and a binder such as polyvinylcarbazole, polycarbonate, polyacrylate, polyester and polyether or so and, thereupon, forming a film consisting of cathode substance. After further vacuum vapor deposition of device materials which correspond to the light emitting layer or the electron injecting layer over the formed light emitting layer, the film consisting of cathode substance may be formed thereupon.<br>
The organic EL device which can be produced as described above emits light when a direct voltage of 3 to 50 V is applied in the condition that the anode is connected to a positive electrode (+) and the cathode is connected to a negative electrode (—). When the connection is reversed, no electric current is observed and no light is emitted at all. When an alternating voltage is applied to the organic EL device, the uniform light emission is observed only in the condition that the polarity of the anode is positive and the polarity of the cathode is negative. When an alternating voltage is applied to the organic EL device, any type of wave shape can be employed.<br>
Employing the derivative of heterocyclic compound having nitrogen atom of the present invention for the organic compound layer, particularly for the electron injecting layer, adhesion between the organic compound layer containing the compound of the present invention and the electrode (particularly, cathode) in the organic EL device of a the present<br><br>
invention is improved.<br>

Example 1 (Preparation of the organic EL device employing the compound of the present invention in an electron injecting layer)<br>
A glass substrate (manufactured by GEOMATEC Company) with a dimension of 25 mmx75 mm and 1.1 mm in thickness having an ITO transparent electrode was cleaned by application of ultrasonic wave in isopropyl alcohol for 5 minutes and then by exposure to ozone generated by ultraviolet light for 30 minutes. The glass substrate having the transparent electrode line which had been cleaned was adhered to a substrate holder of a vacuum vapor deposition apparatus. On the surface<br><br>
of the cleaned substrate at the side having the transparent electrode line, a film of N,N'-bis (N,Nr-diphenyl-4aminophenyl)-N,N-diphenyl-4,4'-diamino-l,l'_biphenyl (referred to as a "film of TPD232", hereinafter) having a thickness of 60 nm was formed in accordance with the resistance heating deposition method in a manner such that the formed film covered the transparent electrode. The formed film of TPD232 worked as the hole injecting layer. Subsequent to the film-forming of the film of TPD232, a film of 4,4'-bis [N-(l-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino] biphenyl (referred to as a "film of NPD", hereinunder) having a thickness of 20 nm was formed over the film of TPD232 in accordance with the resistance heating deposition method. The formed film of NPD worked as the second hole injecting layer (or hole transporting layer). Over the formed film of NPD, 4',4"-bis(2,2diphenylvinyl)-9,10-biphenylanthracene (referred to as "DPVDPAN", hereinafter) having a thickness of 40 nm was further formed in accordance with the resistance heating deposition method. The formed film of DPVDPAN worked as the light emitting layer. Subsequent to the film-forming of the film of DPVDPAN, a film of Compound (1-3) of the present invention having a thickness of 10 nm was formed over the film of DPVDPAN in accordance with the resistance heating deposition method. The formed film of the compound (1-3) worked as the electron injecting layer. Thereafter, Li (the source of lithium: produced by SAES GETTERS Company) was binary vapor deposited and Compound (l"3):Li film having a thickness of 10 nm was formed as the electron injecting layer (or, the cathode) with the film-forming rate of 1.6 A/second: lA/minute. On the formed compound (1-3): Li film, metallic aluminum having the film thickness of 130 nm was vapor deposited to form a metal cathode and an<br><br>
organic EL device was prepared.<br>

The formed film of TPD232 worked as the first hole injecting layer (hole transporting layer). Subsequent to the film-forming of TPD232, a film of the foregoing NPD having a thickness of 20 nm was formed over the formed film of TPD232 in accordance with the resistance heating deposition method. The formed film of NPD worked as the second hole injecting layer (hole transporting layer). Subsequent to the film-forming of the film of NPD, a film of Compound (14-7) of the present invention having a thickness of 40 nm was further formed over the film of NPD in accordance with the resistance heating deposition method.
