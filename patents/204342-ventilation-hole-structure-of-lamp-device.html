PROVISIONAL/COMPLETE SPECIFICATION	<br>
[See Section 10] VENTILATION-HOLE STRUCTURE OF LAMP DEVICE<br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan,, 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome,, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br>
GRANTED<br>
10-5-2005<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the  nature   of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001] [Technical Filed to Which the Invention Pertains]<br>
The present invention relates to a ventilation-hole structure of a lamp device, configured such that the size and shape of the ventilation-hole can be freely set and the ventilation-hole can be disposed in such a manner as not to interfere with other parts. [0002] [Prior Art]<br>
A lamp device used for a vehicle has an inconvenience that the temperature of the inside of the lamp device is increased when a bulb switches on and water droplets may adhere on the inner surface of the lamp device because of a difference in temperature of the inside of the lamp device between in the switch-on state and in the switch-off state.  To cope with such an inconvenience, the lamp device is generally provided with a ventilation-hole for communicating the inside of the lamp device to atmospheric air.<br>
Such a ventilation-hole of a lamp device has been described, for example, in Japanese Utility Model Registration No. 2,547,379 entitled "Lamp Device Mounting Structure for Scooter-type Vehicle".<br><br><br>
[0003]<br>
The above-described technique includes, as.shown in Fig. 17 of the document, a case 40 taken as a reflector, and a lens 51 mounted to the front portion of the case 40, wherein the lower portions of the case 40 and the lens 51 are taken as labyrinth-like fitting portions and a ventilation-hole (not shown) for ventilating the inside of the.case 40 is provided at the fitting portions. [0004] [Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The above-described technique has a problem that since the ventilation-hole is provided at the labyrinth¬like fitting portions, the shape and the size of the ventilation - hole are limited.<br>
Another problem of the above-described technique is as follows.  Namely, as shown in Figs. 5 and 8 of the document,- a front cover 11 is disposed under the ventilation-hole.  The front cover 11 must be disposed with a specific clearance put between the front cover 11 and the lower portions of the labyrinth-like fitting portions so as not to harm the ventilation performance of the ventilation-hole.  As a result, the size of the front cover 11 becomes large and the shape of the front cover 11 is limited.<br><br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a ventilation-hole structure of a lamp device, capable of increasing the degree of freedom in setting the size and shape of the ventilation-hole and disposing the ventilation-hole while giving no limitation to disposition of other parts.<br>
[0005] [Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
To achieve the above object, according to an invention described in claim 1, there is provided a lamp device including a reflector formed into a bowl shape opening forwardly, a cylindrical socket for mounting an electric bulb on the bottom of the bowl-shaped reflector, and a lens disposed in such a manner as to block the opening portion of the reflector; characterized in that a roof for covering the upper surface of the socket extends from the reflector and a notch extending in the direction of the axial line of the socket is formed in the upper portion of the socket, to thereby allow the flow of air into/from the reflector through the notch which communicates an enclosed space in the reflector to atmospheric air while preventing the permeation of water in the notch by means of the roof.<br>
[0006]<br><br><br>
With this configuration, it is possible to increase the degree of freedom in setting the shape and size of the notch by providing the roof extending from the reflector and opening the notch in the socket.<br>
Since the roof and notch are provided in a margin space on the back surface side of the reflector, the provision of the roof and notch does not give any limitation to the disposition of other parts. [0007]<br>
According to an invention described in claim 2, in addition to the configuration of the invention described in claim 1, a flange is provided at a mouthpiece portion of the electric bulb in such a manner as to cover, from behind, the opening portion of the notch.<br>
With this configuration, it is possible to prevent the permeation of a spray of water or the like scattered from behind the lamp device in the ventilation-hole.<br><br><br>

covering the front side of the headlamp 12; a leg shield 32 for covering the driver's legs; a step floor 33 allowing the driver's feet to rest thereon; an under¬cover 34, disposed under the step floor 33, for covering the under side of the body frame 11; and a rear cover 35 for covering the rear half of the body frame 11.<br>
In the figure, reference numeral 41 designates a front cushion unit; 43 is a main stand; 44 is a kick arm for starting the engine; 45 is a tail lamp: 46 is a rear fender; and 47 is a muffler. [0010]<br>
Fig. 2 is a perspective rear view of the headlamp provided with the ventilation-hole of the present invention.<br>
The headlamp 17 includes a reflector 51 formed into a bowl shape opening forwardly and projecting rearwardly; a cylindrical socket 52 integrally provided on the bottom portion of the reflector 51; a bulb assembly 53 as an electric bulb mounted to the socket 52; a lens 54 (not shown here but will be described later) mounted to the reflector 51 in such a manner as to block the opening portion of the reflector 51; and a rim 55 for covering the outer periphery of the front portion of the reflector 51 and the outer periphery of the lens 54.<br><br><br>
[0011]<br>
The reflector 51 includes a circular-arc wall 62 configured as a roof raised rearwardly from a back surface 61,of the reflector 51 in such a manner as to be in proximity to the upper portion of the socket 52, and two raised pieces 63 raised rearwardly from the outer periphery of the front portion of the reflector 51.<br>
The rear portion of the bulb assembly 53 includes a flange 64, and a connector-receiving portion 65 to which a connector of a lead wire for supplying a current to a bulb to be described later is connected.<br>
The rim 55 has two raised pieces 66 projecting rearwardly from the rim 55.  The raised pieces 66 are mounted on the handlebar 16 (see Fig. 1) side together with the raised pieces 63 of the reflector 51. [0012]<br>
Fig. 3 is a sectional view taken on line 3-3 of Fig. 2.  The headlamp 17 is configured such that a cylindrical portion 67 is disposed on the front portion of the reflector 51; a flange 68 is disposed on the rear portion of the cylindrical portion 67; a lens cylindrical portion 71 is disposed on the outer periphery of the lens 54; and a lens flange 72 is disposed on the rear portion of the lens cylindrical portion 71, wherein the lens cylindrical<br><br><br>
portion 71 is fitted around the cylindrical portion 67 of the reflector 51. [0013]<br>
A notch 73 is formed in the upper portion of the peripheral wall of the socket 52 in such a manner as to axially extend from the opening edge to an intermediate portion of the socket 52.<br>
The bulb assembly 53 includes a bulb main body 75 as a light source; a bulb base portion 76 as a mouthpiece for supporting the bulb main body 75; the above - described flange 64 and the connector receiving portion 65 provided on the rear portion of the bulb base portion 76; and an L-shaped projection 77 provided on the outer peripheral surface of the bulb base portion 76.  In the case of mounting the bulb assembly 53 in the socket 52, the bulb assembly 53 having been inserted in the socket 52 is rotated, whereby the L-shaped projection 77 is caught by projections 74 (which will be described later) of the socket 52.  In the figure, reference numeral 78 designates an O-ring; and CL is the axial line of the socket 52, that is, the reference line of the bulb assembly 53. [0014]<br>
The circular-arc wall 62 of the reflector 51 projects rearwardly from the rear end of the socket 52 by<br><br>
a length P.  Preferably, when the bulb assembly 53 is mounted in the socket 52, the circular-arc wall 62' projects rearwardly from the flange 64 of the bulb assembly 53 by a specific length Q, typically, Q = 2 mm.<br>
The outside diameter D of the rear end of the socket 52 is set to be equal to or less than the outside diameter Dl of the flange 64 of the bulb assembly 53 (Dl<br>
- D)"<br>
The above-described notch 73 and the flange 64 of<br>
the bulb assembly 53 for blocking the opening portion of<br>
the notch 73 form a ventilation-hole 80 of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0015]<br>
Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) are views illustrating the notch for forming the ventilation-hole of the present invention, wherein Fig. 4(a) is a rear view of the headlamp 17, and Fig. 4(b) is a plan view of the socket 52.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4(a), the notch 73 of the socket 52 is formed at the uppermost portion of the cylindrical socket 52, that is, at a position including the vertical plane passing through the axis of the socket 52.  The notch 73 has a specific width W, typically, W = 5 mm in the horizontal direction.<br><br><br>
[0016]<br>
The circular-arc wall 62 formed coaxially with the socket 52 is opened on each of the right and left sides by an angle 6 , typically, 0 = 45 with respect to a vertical line VL passing through the axial line CL of the socket 52 (see Fig. 3).  It is to be noted that, in Fig. 4 (a) , the axial line CL extends in the direction from front to back of the paper plane.  The circular-arc wall 62 is separated from the outer peripheral surface of the socket 52 by a specific clearance C, typically, C = 5 mm.<br>
The socket 52 includes the projections 74, which project from the inner peripheral surface of the socket 52 for fixing the bulb assembly 53 (see Fig. 3) in the socket 52. [0017]<br>
Referring to Fig. 4(b), the notch 73 is formed into a rectangular shape extending in the direction of the axial line CL of the socket 52. [0018]<br>
The function of the above-described ventilation-hole 80 will be described below.<br>
Figs. 5(a) to 5(c) are first functional views illustrating a first function of the ventilation-hole of the present invention.<br><br><br>
Referring to Fig. 5(a), when a water droplet "d" is dropped from above the headlamp 17, it flows down along the circular-arc wall 62 and does not enter the ventilation-hole 80.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5(b), when the bulb main body 75 switches on, air in the headlamp 17 is warmed and expanded with heat generated by the bulb main body 75, and as shown by arrows, the air flows out of the headlamp 17 through the ventilation-hole 80. [0019]<br>
Referring to Fig. 5(c), when the bulb main body 75 switches off after the state (b), the air in the headlamp 17 is contracted because the temperature of the air is lowered, and as shown by arrows, air of outside flows in the headlamp 17 through the ventilation-hole 80.<br>
In this way, the ventilation-hole 80 can achieve the droplet-permeation preventive function while keeping the ventilation function. [0020]<br>
Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) are functional views of a ventilation-hole as a comparative example.<br>
Fig. 6(a) shows a state in which a ventilation-hole 102 is opened in the lower portion of a socket 101 of a headlamp 100.  In the figure, reference numeral 103<br><br><br>
designates an outer peripheral surface of the socket 101, and 104 is a bulb main body. [0021]<br>
For example, when a water droplet "d" is dropped from above, it flows along the outer peripheral surface 103 of the socket 101 and reaches the lower portion of the socket 101.<br>
At this time, the water droplet "d" is possibly spread into a film-shape at the ventilation-hole 102 to block the ventilation-hole 102.  If the lighting bulb main body 104 switches off in such a state as shown in Fig. 6(b), the water droplet "d" possibly enters the socket 101 together with air flowing in the socket 101. [0022]<br>
Figs. 7(a) and 7(b) are second functional views illustrating a second function of the ventilation-hole of the present invention.  In this example, the scooter-type vehicle is tilted.<br>
Referring to Fig. 7(a), when a water droplet "d" is dropped from above the headlamp 17, it flows down along the circular-arc wall 62.<br>
Even if the vehicular body is most tilted and<br>
thereby the headlamp 17 is tilted by an angle CL , since the circular-arc wall 62 has an excess arc length L as<br><br>
shown in Fig. 7(a), the water droplet "d" does not enter the ventilation-hole 80. [0023]<br>
Referring to Fig. 7(b), when the bulb main body 75 switches on, air in the headlamp 17 is expanded, and as shown by arrows, the air flows out of the headlamp 17 through the ventilation-hole 80.  When the bulb main body 75 switches off, the air in the headlamp 17 is contracted, and thereby outside air flows in the headlamp 17 through the ventilation-hole 80 in the direction reversed to that shown by the arrows.<br>
In this way, even if the headlamp 17 is tilted, the ventilation-hole 80 can achieve the droplet-permeation preventive function while keeping the ventilation function. [0024]<br>
Fig. 8 is a third functional view illustrating a third function of the ventilation-hole of the present invention.  As described above, the ventilation-hole structure in this embodiment is configured as shown . in Fig. 3.  That is to say, the outside diameter Dl of the flange 64 of the bulb assembly 53 is equal to or larger than the outside diameter D of the socket 52 having the notch 73, and the circular-arc wall 62 projects<br><br>
rearwardly from the flange 64 of the bulb assembly 53 mounted in the socket 52 by the length Q.  As a result, even if a water droplet "d" is flied horizontally or obliquely from behind the headlamp 17 as shown in Fig. 8, the water droplet "d" does not permeate in the ventilation-hole 80 because it is blocked by the flange 64 and the circular-arc wall 62.<br>
Accordingly, the provision of the circular-arc wall 62 and the flange 64 makes it possible to further improve the water droplet-permeation preventive function while keeping the ventilation function.<br>
[0025]<br>
The shape of the notch 7 3 for forming the ventilation-hole 80 of the present invention is not limited to the rectangular shape as shown in Fig. 4(b), but may be a round shape, a polygonal shape, or a slot or elliptic shape having a major axis extending in the direction of the axial line CL of the socket 52.<br>
The shape of the wall 62 is also not limited to the circular-arc shape as shown in Fig. 4(a), but may be a plane shape, a free curve plane, or a combination of some planes.<br>
[0026] [Effect of the Invention]<br><br>
The present invention having the above configuration exhibits the following effects:<br>
According to the ventilation-hole structure of the lamp device described in claim 1, since the roof extends from the reflector and the notch is opened in the upper portion of the socket, it is possible to simply form the ventilation-hole only by opening the notch in the socket and hence to increase the degree of freedom in setting the shape and size of the notch.<br>
Since the roof and notch are provided in a margin space on the back surface side of the reflector, the provision of the roof and notch does not give any limitation to the disposition of other parts. [0027]<br>
According to the ventilation- hole structure of the lamp device described in claim 2, since the flange is provided at the mouthpiece portion of the electric bulb in such a manner as to cover, from behind, the opening portion of the notch, it is possible to prevent the permeation of a spray of water or the like scattered from behind the lamp device in the ventilation- hole.<br><br><br>
