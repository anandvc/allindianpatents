				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATING POWER BY COMBUSTION OF VAPORIZED FUEL<br>
[0001]	The   present   invention   relates   to   a   power   producing<br>
apparatus and method of use thereof. A preferred apparatus can include a liquid fueled combustion chamber supplying heat to a power conversion device outputting up to 510 kg-m/sec (5,000 watts) of mechanical and/or electrical power.<br>
[0002]	The    need   to.  power   portable   electronics   equipment,<br>
communications gear, medical devices and other equipment in remote<br>
field service has been on the rise in recent years, increasing the demand<br>
for highly efficient, mobile power systems.   These applications require<br>
power sources that provide bnth high power and energy density, while also<br>
requiring minimal size and weight, low emissions and cost.<br>
[0003]	To  date,   batteries  have   been  the   principal   means  for<br>
supplying portable sources of power.   However, due to the time required<br>
for recharging, batteries have proven inconvenient for continuous use<br>
applications.   Moreover, portable batteries are generally limited to power<br>
production in the range of several milliwatts to a few watts and thus cannot<br>
address the  need for significant levels of mobile,  lightweight power<br>
production.<br>
[0004]	Small generators powered by internal combustion engines,<br>
whether gasoline- or diesel-fueled have also been used. However, the noise and emission characteristics of such generators have made them wholly unsuitable for a wide range of mobile power systems and unsafe for indoor use. While conventional heat engines powered by high energy density liquid fuels offer advantages with respect to size, thermodynamic scaling and cost considerations have tended to favor their use in larger power plants.<br>
[0005]	In view of these factors, a void exists with regard to power<br>
systems in the size range of approximately 5.1 to 51 kg-m/sec (50 to 500<br>
watts). Moreover, in order to take advantage of high energy density liquid fuels, improved fuel preparation and delivery systems capable of low fueling rates are needed. Additionally, such systems must also enable highly efficient combustion with minimal emissions.<br>
[0006]	A   combustion  device  wherein   fuel   is   atomized   by   an<br>
ultrasonic atomizing device is proposed in U.S. Patent No. 5,127,822. According to this patent, atomizers have been proposed wherein fuel is supplied to a combustion chamber in fine droplets to accelerate vaporization of the fuel and reduce the combustor residence time required to achieve acceptable combustion efficiency.<br>
[0007]	U.S. Patent No. 5,127,822 patent proposes an arrangement<br>
wherein fuel is supplied at 5 cc/min and the fuel is atomized into droplets having a Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) of 40 urn. Other atomizing techniques are proposed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,095,436 and 6,102,687. An ultrasonic atomizer for supplying fuel to an internal combustion engine is proposed in U.S. Patent No. 4,986,248.<br>
[0008]	U.S. Patent No. 4,013,396 proposes a fuel aerosolization<br>
apparatus wherein a hydrocarbon fuel (e.g., gasoline, fuel oil, kerosene, etc.) is dispensed into a condensation area with the intention of forming an aerosolized fuel of relatively even sized droplets less than 1 urn in diameter.<br>
[0009]	The aerosolized fuel is intended to be mixed with air to<br>
provide a desired air-to-fuel ratio and combusted in the combustion area of<br>
a heating burner and a hyat 3xchanger transfers heat from the combusted<br>
fuel to a heat-carrying medium such as air, gas or liquid.<br>
[0010]	A    fuel-vaporizing    device    said    to    address    problems<br>
associated with incomplete combustion of fuel aerosols in internal combustion engines is proposed in U.S. Patent No. 5,472,645. According to U.S. Patent No. 5,472,645, because aerosol fuel droplets do not ignite and combust completely in internal combustion engines, unburned fuel residues are exhausted from the engine as pollutants such as hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and aldehydes with<br>
concomitant production of oxides of nitrogen (NOX). The proposal of U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,472,645 is intended to improve combustion of aerosol fuels<br>
by breaking liquid fuel down into an air-fluid stream of vaporized or gas-<br>
phase elements containing some unvaporized aerosols containing<br>
hydrocarbons of higher molecular weight, the lighter fuel distillates said to<br>
quickly evaporate to the gas phase, mix with air and are to be fed to an<br>
internal combustion engine while the heavier fuel portions are said to be<br>
transformed into a gas-phase vaporized state before they exit a cyclone<br>
vortex device and enter the intake manifold of the engine.<br>
[0011]	U.S. Patent No. 4,344,404 proposes an apparatus for<br>
supplying aerosol fuel droplets mixed with air to an internal combustion engine or burner, the fuel droplets said to have sizes of 0.5 to 1.5Âµm. The liquid fuel in aerosol form is intended to be mixed with air in a air-to-fuel ratio of about 18:1 so as to produce the least CO, HC and NOX emissions from the engine.<br>
[0012]	Various devices have been proposed for heating fuels into a<br>
vaporized fuel that is combusted by a burner.   See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,193,755; 4,320,180; and 4,784,599.<br>
[0013]	U.S.   Patent   No.   3,716,416   discloses   a   fuel-metering<br>
device intended for use in a fuel cell system.   The fuel eel! system is<br>
intended to be self-regulating, producing power at a predetermined<br>
level.    The proposed fuel metering system includes a capillary flow<br>
control device for throttling the fuel flow in response to the power output<br>
of the fuel cell, rather than to provide improved fuel preparation for<br>
subsequent combustion. Instead, the fuel is intended to be fed to a fuel<br>
reformer for conversion to H2 and then fed to a fuel cell.   In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the capillary tubes are made of metal and the capillary<br>
itself is used as a resistor, which is in electrical contact with the power<br>
output of the fuel cell.  Because the flow resistance of a vapor is greater<br>
than that of a liquid, the flow is throttled as the power output increases.<br>
The fuels suggested for use include any fluid that is easily transformed<br>
from a liquid to a vapor phase by applying heat and flows freely through<br>
a capillary.   Vaporization appears to be achieved in the manner that vapor lock occurs in automotive engines.<br>
[0014]	U.S. Patent No. 6,276,347 proposes a supercritical or near-<br>
supercritical    atomizer   and    method   for   achieving    atomization   or<br>
vaporization of a liquid.   The supercritical atomizer of U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,276,347 is said to enable the use of heavy fuels to fire small, lightweight,<br>
low compression ratio, spa k-ignition piston engines that typically bum<br>
gasoline.  The atomizer is intended to create a spray of fine droplets from<br>
liquid, or liquid-like fuels, by moving the fuels toward their supercritical<br>
temperature and releasing the fuels into a region of lower pressure on the<br>
gas stability field in the phase diagram associated with the fuels, causing a<br>
fine atomization or vaporization of the fuel.     Utility is disclosed for<br>
applications such as combustion engines, scientific equipment, chemical<br>
processing,  waste  disposal  control,  cleaning,  etching,   insect  control,<br>
surface modification, humidification and vaporization.<br>
[0015]	To  minimize  decomposition,   U.S.   Patent   No.   6,276,347<br>
proposes  keeping  the fuel   below the -supercritical  temperature  until<br>
passing the  distal  end  of a  restrictor for atomization.     For certain<br>
applications, heating just the tip of the restrictor is desired to minimize the<br>
potential for chemical reactions or precipitations.   This is said to reduce<br>
problems associated with impurities, reactants or materials in the fuel<br>
stream which otherwise tend to be driven out of solution, clogging lines<br>
and filters. Working at or near supercritical pressure suggests that the fuel<br>
supply system operate in the range of 21.1 to 56.2 kg/cm2 (300 to 800<br>
psig).  While the use of supercritical pressures and temperatures might<br>
reduce clogging of the atomizer, it appears to require the use of a<br>
relatively more expensive fuel pump, as well as fuel lines, fittings and the<br>
like that are capable of operating at these elevated pressures.<br>
[0016]	Power  conversion   arrangements   are   proposed   in   U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 4,638,172; 5,836,150; 5,874,798; 5,932,940; 6,109,222; and 6,198,038. Of these, U.S. Patent No. 4,638,172 proposes a direct current generator operatively coupled to a small internal combustion<br>
engine,  the  generator said  to output between  4 volts  (V) and   150<br>
milliamperes (mA) to 110 V and over 250 mA.  U.S. Patent No. 5,836,150<br>
proposes a micro thrust and heat generator that can be used as a thrust<br>
source for a micro machined turbo-electric generator.  U .S. Patent No.<br>
5,874,798 proposes a micro-turbine generator device wherein air is fed<br>
into the device to generate electricity for use with portable electronic<br>
products.    U.S.  Patent No. 5,932,940 proposes a micro-gas turbine<br>
engine including a combustion chamber used to drive a microgenerator<br>
which is intended to output 1.0 to 3.1   kg-m/sec (10 to 30 watts) of<br>
electrical   power  for  replacement of  batteries   in   portable  electronic<br>
devices while producing 20 times the power for the same weight and<br>
volume   (e.g.,   replacing   batteries   for   portable   computers,   radios,<br>
telephones, power tools, heaters, coolers, military applications, etc.).<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,109,222 patent proposes a micro heat engine that is<br>
intended to generate 1.0 to 3.1 kg-m/sec 10 to 30 watts of electrical<br>
power wherein a free piston is reciprocated by a periodic combustion<br>
process.<br>
[0017]	In  one aspect, the present invention  is directed to an<br>
apparatus for producing power from a source of liquid fuel, comprising:<br>
(a)	at least one capillary flow passage, said at least one<br>
capillary flow passage having an inlet end and an outlet end, said inlet<br>
end in fluid communication with the source of liquid fuel;<br>
(b)	a  heat source arranged  along said  at least one<br>
capillary flow passage, said heat source operable to heat the liquid fuel in<br>
said at least one capillary flow passage to a level sufficient to change at<br>

stream of substantially vaporized fuel from said outlet end of said at least<br>
one capillary flow passage;  <br>
(c)	a combustion chamber for combusting the stream of<br>
substantially   vaporized   fuel   and   air,   said   combustion   chamber  in<br>
communication with said outlet end of said at least one capillary flow<br>
passage; and<br>
(d)      a   conversion   device   operable   to   convert   heat<br><br>
released by combustion in said combustion chamber into mechanical and/or electrical power.<br>
[0018]	In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a<br>
method of generating power, comprising;<br>
(a)	supplying liquid fuel to at least one capillary flow<br>
passage;<br>
(b)	causing a stream of substantially vaporized fuel to<br>
pass through an outlet of the at least one capillary flow passage by heating<br>

power using a conversion device.<br>
[0019]	To address  problems  associated  with  the formation of<br>
deposits during the heating of liquid fuel, another aspect of the present invention provides a method and means for cleaning deposits formed during the operation of the apparatus.<br>

[0040]	The present invention provides a power producing apparatus<br>
which advantageously combusts a high energy density liquid fuel.   In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the apparatus includes at least one capillary sized<br>
flow passage connected to the fuel supply, a heat source arranged along<br>
the flow passage to heat liquid fuel in the flow passage sufficiently to<br>
deliver a stream of vaporized fuel from an outlet of the flow passage, a<br>
combustion chamber in which the vaporized fuel is combusted, and a<br>
conversion device which converts heat produced by combustion in the<br>
combustion chamber into mechanical and/or electrical power.<br>
[0041]	The flow passage can be a capillary tube heated by a<br>
resistance heater, a section of the tube heated by passing electrical<br>
current therethrough.  The capillary flow passage also is characterized by<br>
having a low thermal inertia, so that the capillary passageway can be<br>
brought up to the desired temperature for vaporizing fuel very quickly, e.g.,<br>
within 2.0 seconds, preferably within 0.5 second, and more preferably<br>
within 0.1 second.  The capillary sized fluid passage is preferably formed<br>
in a capillary body such as a single or multilayer metal, ceramic or glass<br>
body.  The passage has an enclosed volume opening to an inlet and an<br>
outlet either of which may be open to the exterior of the capillary body or<br>
may be connected to another passage within the same body or another<br>
body or to fittings. The heater can be formed by a portion of the body such<br>
as a section of a stainless steel tube or the heater can be a discrete layer<br>
or wire of resistance heating material incorporated in or on the capillary<br>
body.<br>
[0042]	The   fluid   passage   may   be   any   shape   comprising   an<br>
enclosed volume opening to an inlet and an outlet and through which a fluid may pass. The fluid passage may have any desired cross-section with a preferred cross-section being a circle of uniform diameter. Other capillary fluid passage cross-sections include non-circular shapes such as triangular, square, rectangular, oval or other shape and the cross section of the fluid passage need not be uniform. The fluid passage can extend rectiiinearly or non-rectilinearly and may be a single fluid passage or multi-path fluid passage.<br>
[0043]	A capillary-sized  flow  passage  can  be  provided  with a<br>
hydraulic diameter that is preferably less than 2 mm, more preferably<br>
less than 1 mm, and most preferably less than 0.5 mm.   The "hydraulic<br>
diameter" is a parameter used in calculating fluid flow characteristics<br>
through a fluid carrying element and is defined as four times the flow<br>
area of the fluid-carrying element divided by the perimeter of the solid<br>
boundary in contact with the fluid (generally referred to as the "wetted"<br>
perimeter).    For a tube having a circular flow passage, the hydraulic<br>
diameter and the actual diameter are equivalent.   In the case where the<br>
capillary passage is defined by a metal capillary tube, the tube can have<br>
an inner diameter of 0.01 to 3 mm, preferably 0.1 to 1 mm, most preferably<br>
0.15 to 0.5 mm.  Alternatively, the capillary passage can be defined by<br>
transverse cross sectional area of the passage that can be 8 x 10-5 to 7<br>
mm2, preferably 8 x 10-3 to 8 x 10-1 mm2 and more preferably 2 x 10-3 to 2<br>
x 10-1 mm2.  Many combinations of a single or multiple capillaries, various<br>
pressures, various capillary lengths, amounts of heat applied to the<br>
capillary, and different shapes and/or cross-sectional areas will suit a<br>
given application.<br>
[0044]	The conversion device can be a Stirling engine, micro-turbine<br>
or other suitable device for converting heat to mechanical or electrical power with an optional generator capable of producing up to about 510 kg-m/sec (5,000 watts) of power. The liquid fuel can be any type of hydrocarbon fuel such as jet fuel, gasoline, kerosene or diesel oil, an oxygenate such as<br>
ethanol, methanol, methyl tertiary butyl ether, or blends of any of these and<br>
the fuel is preferably supplied to the flow passage at pressures of preferably<br>
less than 7.0 kg-m/sec (100 psig), more preferably less than 3.5 kg-m/sec (50<br>
psig), even more preferably less than 0.7 kg-m/sec (10 psig), and most<br>
preferably less than 0.4 kg-m/sec (5 psig). The vaporized fuel can be mixed<br>
with air to form an aerosol having a mean droplet size of 25 urn or less,<br>
preferably 10 Âµm or less, thus allowing clean and efficient ignition capabilities.<br>
[0045]	According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, liquid<br>
fuel is delivered via a heated capillary tube (e.g., a small diameter glass,<br>
ceramic or metallic material such as stainless steel tube having an inner<br>
diameter of 3 mm or less) to a combustion chamber in which Lhe vaporized<br>
fuel is mixed with preheated or unheated air.   The vaporized fuel can be<br>
mixed with air at ambient temperature, which is drawn into air supply<br>
passages leading into the combustion chamber. Alternatively, the vaporized<br>
fuel can be mixed with air that has been preheated such as by a heat<br>
exchanger that preheats the air with heat of exhaust gases removed from the<br>
combustion chamber.   If desired, the air can be pressurized such as by a<br>
blower prior to mixing with the vaporized fuel.<br>
[0046]	During vaporization of liquid fuel  in  a  heated capillary<br>
passage, deposits of carbon and/or heavy hydrocarbons may accumulate on the capillary walls and flow of the fuel can be severely restricted which ultimately can lead to clogging of the capillary flow passage. The rate at which these deposits accumulate is a function of capillary wall temperature, the fuel flow rate and the fuel type. While it is thought that fuel additives may be useful in reducing such deposits, should clogging develop, the fuel vaporizing device of the present invention advantageously provides a means for cleaning deposits formed during operation.<br>
[0047]	In accordance with the present invention, the air-fuel mixture is<br>
combusted in a combustion chamber to produce heat that is converted into mechanical or electrical power.   The power-producing device provides<br>
reliable liquid fuel delivery and atomization of vaporized fuel prior to combustion.<br>
[0048]	The heated capillary flow passage has the ability to form an<br>
aerosol of small fuel droplets (e.g., 25 urn or less, preferably 10 urn or less) when the vaporized fuel mixes with air at ambient temperature, operating at liquid fuel pressures below 7.0 kg-m/sec (100 psig), preferably less than 3.5 kg-m/sec (50 psig), more preferably less than 0.7 kg-m/sec (10 psig), and even more preferably less than 0.4 kg-m/sec (5 psig). The present invention possesses the ability to combust fuel at low air supply pressure (e.g., below 50.80 mm H2O (2 in H2O)), starts rapidly, provides for control of fouling, clogging and gumming, operates at reduced levels of exhaust emissions and requires low ignition energy to ignite the fuel-air mixture.<br>
[0049]	One advantage of the apparatus according to the invention<br>
is  its  ignition   energy  requirement characteristics.     Minimum  ignition<br>
energy is a term used to describe the ease with which an atomized<br>
fuel/air mixture can be ignited, typically with an igniter such as a spark<br>
ignition source.    The device according to the invention can  provide<br>
vaporized fuel  and/or aerosol with droplets  having  a  Sauter Mean<br>
Diameter (SMD) of less than 25 um, preferably less than 10 urn and<br>
more preferably less than 5 um, such fine aerosols being useful to<br>
improve the start-up characteristics and flame stability in gas turbine<br>
applications.   Additionally, very significant reductions in minimum ignition<br>
energy can be achieved for fuels having values of SMD at or below 25 um.<br>
For   example,   as   discussed   in   Lefebvre,   Gas   Turbine   Combustion<br>
(Hemisphere Publishing Corporation, 1983) at page 252, Emin, a term that<br>
correlates the ease with which an atomized fuel/air mixture may be ignited,<br>
is shown to sharply decrease as SMD decreases.    Minimum ignition<br>
energy is roughly proportional to the cube of the Sauter Mean Diameter<br>
(SMD) of the fuel droplets in the aerosol.   SMD is the diameter of a<br>
droplet whose surface-to-volume ratio is equal to that of the entire spray<br>
and  relates to the  mass transfer characteristics of the  spray.     The<br>
relationship between Emix and SMD for various fuels is shown in Lefebvre to be roughly approximated by the following relationship:<br>
log Emm = 4.5(log SMD) + k;        where Emin is measured in mJ,<br>
SMD is measured in Âµm, and k is a constant related to fuel type.<br>
[0050]	According to Lefebyre, heavy fuel oil has a minimum ignition<br>
energy of about 800 mJ at a SMD of 115 Âµm and a minimum ignition energy of about 23 mJ at a SMD of 50 urn. Isooctane has a minimum ignition energy of about 9 mJ at a SMD of 90 urn and a minimum ignition energy of about 0.4 mJ at a SMD of 40 urn. For a diesel fuel, when SMD is equal to 100 urn, Emin is about 100 mJ. A reduction in SMD to 30 urn would yield a reduction in Eminto about 0.8 mJ. As may be appreciated, ignition s ystem requirements a re substantially reduced for SMD values below 25 Âµm.<br>
[0051]	The power conversion a pparatus a ccording to the p resent<br>
invention has been found to exhibit highly desirable low ignition energy<br>
requirements.    A low ignition energy requirement improves the power<br>
producing benefits of the present invention by reducing the weight of the<br>
overall system and maximizing the power output through the reduction of<br>
the parasitic power losses associated with the ignition system.<br>
[0052]	!n view of the benefits hereinabove described, low energy<br>
spark ignition devices are preferred for the igniter of the power producing<br>
apparatus.   Preferred are small piezo-electric ignition devices capable of<br>
providing a spark energy in the range of about 5 to 7 mJ.   Such devices<br>
are known to be simple, compact and present no parasitic load issues.<br>
The ultra-fine fuel vaporization provided by the apparatus of the invention<br>
cooperates to provide excellent ignition characteristics with low energy<br>
piezo-electric ignition devices.<br>
[0053]	The emissions characteristics of liquid-fueled combustion<br>
devices a re k nown t o be sensitive to t he q uality o f t he fuel d roplet s ize distribution.     High  quality,  fine  sprays  promote fuel  evaporation and<br>
enhance mixing, thereby reducing the need for fuel-rich combustion and<br>
the often-attendant generation of smoke and soot.   Small droplets follow<br>
flow streamlines and  are  less prone to impact against burner walls.<br>
Conversely, large droplets can impact burner walls and cause CO and<br>
hydrocarbon  emissions  and  carbon deposits.     This  problem  is more<br>
noticeable in devices where the flames are highly confined.<br>
[0054]	The heat produced during combustion of the vaporized fuel<br>
can be converted to electrical or mechanical power. For instance, the heat<br>
could be converted to any desired amount of electrical or mechanical<br>
power, e.g., up to 510 kg-m/sec (5000 watts) of electrical power or<br>
mechanical power.   Compared to portable battery technology which can<br>
only provide approximately 2.0 kg-m/sec (20 W) for a few hours or a noisy,<br>
high emissions, internal combustion engine/generator producing above<br>
102   kg-m/sec   (1    kW),   the   apparatus   according   to   one   preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention offers a quiet, clean power source in the few<br>
hundred watt range.<br>
[0055]	Various technologies exist for conversion of heat produced in<br>
the combustion chamber according to the invention into electrical or<br>
mechanical power.   For instance, in the 2.0 to 510 kg-m/sec (20 to 5000<br>
watt) range, at least the following technologies are contemplated: Stirling<br>
engines for conversion of heat into mechanical power which can be used<br>
to drive a generator, micro-gas turbines which can be used to drive a<br>
generator, thermoelectric for direct conversion of heat into electricity, and<br>
thermophotovoltaics for direct conversion of radiant energy into electricity,<br>
[0056]	The thermoelectric devices offer advantages in terms of<br>
being quiet and durable, and coupled with external combustion systems,<br>
offer the potential for low emissions and flexibility as to fuel. Various types<br>
of thermoelectric generators.which can be used as the conversion device,<br>
include   those   disclosed   in   U.S.   Patent   Nos.   5,563,368;   5,793,119;<br>
5,917,144;   and   6,172.427,   the   disclosures   of   which   are   hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
 [0057]	The thermophotovoltaic devices offer advantages in terms of<br>
being quiet, providing moderate power density, and coupled with external<br>
combustion systems offer the potential for low emissions and flexibility as<br>
to fuel.   Various types of thermophotovoltaic devices, which can be used<br>
as the conversion device, include those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,512,109; 5,753,050; 6,092,912; and 6,204,442, the disclosures of which<br>
are hereby incorporated by reference.    As shown in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,204,442, a  heat  radiating  body can  be used to absorb heat from<br>
combustion gases and heat radiated from the heat radiating body is<br>
directed to a photocell for conversion to electricity, thus protecting the<br>
photocell from direct exposure to the combustion gases.<br>
[0058]	Micro-gas turbines could  be desirable  in  terms  of high<br>
specific   power.      Microturbine  devices,  which   can   be   used   as  the<br>
conversion device, include those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,836,150;<br>
5,874,798;   and   5,932,940,   the   disclosures   of   which   are   hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
[0059]	Stirling engines offer advantages with respect to size, quiet<br>
operation, durability, and coupled with external combustion systems offer the potential for low emissions and flexibility as to fuel. Stirling engines that can be used as the conversion device will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0060]	Referring now to FIG. 1, a fuel-vaporizing device for use in<br>
the apparatus of the present invention is shown. Fuel vaporizing device 10, for vaporizing a liquid fuel drawn from a source of liquid fuel, includes a capillary flow passage 12, having an inlet end 14 and an outlet end 16. A fluid control valve 18 is provided for placing inlet end 14 of capillary flow passage 12 in fluid communication with a liquid fuel source F and introducing the liquid fuel in a substantially liquid state into capillary flow passage 12. As is preferred, fluid control valve 18 may be operated by a solenoid. A heat source 20 is arranged along capillary flow passage 12. As is most preferred, heat source 20 is provided by forming capillary flow passage 12 from a tube of electrically resistive<br>
material,  a portion  of capillary flow  passage  12 forming  a  heater<br>
element when a source of electrical current is connected to the tube at<br>
connections 22 and 24 for delivering current therethrough.  Heat source<br>
20, as may be appreciated, is then operable to heat the liquid fuel in<br>
capillary flow passage  12 to a level sufficient to change at least a<br>
portion thereof from the liquid state to a vapor state and deliver a<br>
stream of substantially vaporized fuel from outlet end 16 of capillary<br>
flow passage 20.  By substantially vaporized is meant that at least 50%<br>
of the liquid fuel is vaporized by the heat source, preferably at least 70%,<br>
and more preferably at least 80% of the liquid fuel is vaporized.<br>
[0061]	Fuel vaporizing device 10 also includes means for cleaning<br>
deposits formed during the operation of the apparatus of the present<br>
invention.   The means for cleaning deposits shown in FIG. 1 includes<br>
fluid control valve 18. heat source 20 and an oxidizer control valve 26<br>
for placing capillary flow passage 12 in fluid communication with a<br>
source of oxidizer C. As may be appreciated, the oxidizer control valve<br>
can be located at or near either end of capillary flow passage 12 or<br>
configured to be in fluid communication with either end of capillary flow<br>
passage 12.  If the oxidizer control valve is located at or near the outlet<br>
end 16 of capillary flow passage 12, it then serves to place the source<br>
of oxidizer C in fluid communication with the outlet end 16 of capillary<br>
flow passage 12.    In operation, heat source 20 is used to heat the<br>
oxidizer C in capillary flow passage 12 to a level sufficient to oxidize<br>
deposits formed   during  the  heating  of the  liquid  fuel   F.     In  one<br>
embodiment, to switch from a fueling mode to a cleaning mode, the<br>
oxidizer   control   valve   26   is   operable   to   alternate   between   the<br>
introduction of liquid fuel F and the introduction of oxidizer C into<br>
capillary flow passage 12 and enables the in-situ cleaning of capillary<br>
flow passage when the oxidizer is introduced into the at least one<br>
capillary flow passage.<br>
[0062]	One technique for oxidizing deposits includes passing air or<br>
steam through the capillary flow passage. As indicated, the capillary flow<br><br>
passage i s p referabiy heated during the c leaning o peration s o t hat the<br>
oxidation   process   is   initiated   and  nurtured   until  the   deposits  are<br>
consumed.   To enhance this cleaning operation, a catalytic substance<br>
may be employed, either as a coating on, or as a component of, the<br>
capillary wall  to   reduce  the  temperature  and/or  time   required  for<br>
accomplishing  the  cleaning.      For continuous  operation  of the  fuel<br>
vaporizing device, more than one capillary flow passage can be used<br>
such that when a clogged condition is detected, such as by the use of a<br>
sensor, fuel flow can be diverted to another capillary flow passage and<br>
oxidant flow initiated through the clogged capillary flow passage to be<br>
cleaned.    As an example, a capillary body can include a plurality of<br>
capillary flow passages therein and a valving arrangement can be<br>
provided to selectively supply liquid fuel or air to each flow passage.<br>
[0063]	Alternatively, fuel flow can be diverted from a capillary flow<br>
passage and oxidant flow initiated at preset intervals.   Fuel delivery to a<br>
capillary flow passage can be effected by a controller.  For example, the<br>
controller can  activate  fuel  delivery for a   preset time  period  and<br>
deactivate fuel delivery after the preset amount of time.  The controller<br>
may also effect adjustment'of the pressure of the liquid fuel and/or the<br>
amount of heat supplied to the capillary flow passage based on one or<br>
more sensed conditions.   The sensed conditions may include inter alia:<br>
the fuel pressure, the capillary temperature or the air-fuel ratio.   The<br>
controller may also control one or more capillary flow passages to clean<br>
deposits.<br>
[0064]	The cleaning technique may be applied to combustion devices<br>
having a single flow passage. However, if the combustion device is intermittently shut down during the cleaning operation, the energy supplied to the flow passage during cleaning would preferably be electrical. The time period between cleanings may either be fixed based upon experimentally determined clogging characteristics, or a sensing and control device may be employed to delect clogging and initiate the cleaning process as<br>
required.    For example, a control device could detect the degree of<br>
clogging by sensing the fuel supply pressure to the capillary flow passage.<br>
[0065]	As indicated, the oxidation cleaning technique may also be<br>
applied   to   fuel   vaporizing   devices  that   are   required   to   operate<br>
continuously.      In  this  case,   multiple   capillary  flow  passages  are<br>
employed. An exemplary multiple capillary flow passage fuel-vaporizing<br>
device for use in the present invention is illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3.<br>
FIG.   2   presents   a   schematic  view   of   a   multiple   capillary   tube<br>
arrangement, integrated into a single assembly 94.   FIG. 3 presents an<br>
end view of the assembly 94.  As shown, the assembly can include the<br>
three capillary tubes 82A, 82B, 82C and a positive electrode 92, which<br>
can include a solid stainless steel rod.   The tubes and the rod can be<br>
supported in a body 96 of electrically insulating material and power can<br>
be supplied to the rod and capillary tubes via fittings 98.   For example,<br>
direct current can be supplied to upstream ends of one or more of the<br>
capillary tubes and a connection 95 at the downstream ends thereof can<br>
form a return path for the curent through rod 92.<br>
[0066]	Reference is made now to FIG. 4, wherein a multiple<br>
capillary tube vaporizing system 80 for use in the practice of the present<br>
invention is shown. The system includes capillary tubes 82A through C,<br>
fuel supply lines 84A through C, oxidizer supply lines 86A through C,<br>
oxidizer control valves 88A through C, power input' lines 90A-C and<br>
common ground 91.   The system 80 allows cleaning of one or more<br>
capillary tubes while fuel delivery continues with one or more other<br>
capillary tubes.    For example, combustion of fuel via capillary flow<br>
passages 82B and 82C can be carried out during cleaning of capillary<br>
flow passage 82A.    Cleaning of capillary flow passage 82A can be<br>
accomplished by shutting off the supply of fuel to capillary tube 82A,<br>
supplying air to capillary flow passage 82A with sufficient heating to<br>
oxidize deposits in the capillary flow passage.   Thus, the cleaning of<br>
one   or   several  capillaries   can   be   carried   out  while   continuously<br>
delivering fuel. The one or more capillary flow passages being cleaned<br>
are preferably heated during the cleaning process by an electrical<br>
resistance heater or thermal feedback from the application.  Again, the<br>
time period between cleanings for any given capillary flow passage may<br>
either be fixed based upon known clogging characteristics, determined<br>
experimentally, or a sensing and control system may be employed to<br>
detect deposit buildup and initiate the cleaning process as required.<br>
[0067]	FIG. 5 shows an exemplary schematic of a control system<br>
to operate an apparatus in accordance with the present invention, the<br>
apparatus incorporating an oxidizing gas supply for cleaning clogged<br>
capillary  passages.    The control system  includes  a  controller 100<br>
operably  connected  to  a fuel  supply  102  that  supplies fuel  and<br>
optionally air to a flow passage such as a capillary flow passage 104.<br>
The controller is also operably connected to a power supply 106 that<br>
delivers power to a resistance heater or directly to a metal capillary flow<br>
passage 104 for heating the tube sufficiently to vaporize the fuel.   If<br>
desired, the combustion system can include multiple flow passages and<br>
heaters operably connected to the controller 100.   The controller 100<br>
can be operably connected to one or more signal sending devices such<br>
as an on-off switch, thermocouple, fuel flow rate sensor, air flow rate<br>
sensor, power output sensor, battery charge sensor, etc. whereby the<br>
controller 100 can be programmed to automatically control operation of<br>
the combustion system in response to the signal(s) outputted to the<br>
controller by the signal sending devices 108.<br>
[0068]	In operation, the fuel vaporizing device of the apparatus<br>
according to the present invention can be configured to feed back heat produced during combustion such that the liquid fuel is heated sufficiently to substantially vaporize the liquid fuel as it passes through the capillary reducing or eliminating or supplementing the need to electrically or otherwise heat the capillary flow passage. For example, the capillary tube can be made longer to increase the surface area thereof for greater heat transfer, the capillary tube can be configured to pass through the<br>
combusting fuel or a heat exchanger can be arranged to use exhaust gas from the combustion reaction to preheat the fuel.<br>
[0069]	FIG.   6  shows,  in simplified  form,  how  a  capillary flow<br>
passage 64 can be arranged so that liquid fuel traveling therethrough can<br>
be heated to an elevated temperature to reduce the power requirements<br>
of the fuel-vaporizing  heater.     As  shown,  a  portion  66 of a  tube<br>
comprising the capillary flow passage passes through the flame 68 of the<br>
combusted fuel.   For initial start up, a resistance heater comprising a<br>
section of the tube or separate resistance heater heated by electrical<br>
leads 70, 72 connected to a power source such as a battery 74 can be<br>
used to initially vaporize the liquid fuel.   After ignition of the vaporized<br>
fuel by a suitable ignition arrangement, the portion 66 of the tube can be<br>
preheated by the heat of combustion to reduce the power otherwise<br>
needed for continued vaporization of the fuel by the resistance heater.<br>
Thus, by preheating the tube, the fuel in the tube can be vaporized<br>
without using the resistance heater whereby power can be conserved.<br>
[0070]         As will be appreciated, the fuel vaporizing device and<br>
attendant system depicted in FIGS. 1  through 6 may also be used in<br>
connection   with   another   embodiment   of   the   present   invention.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 1, the means for cleaning deposits includes fluid<br>
control valve 18, a solvent control valve 26 for placing capillary flow<br>
passage 12 in fluid communication with a solvent, solvent control valve<br>
26 disposed at one end of capillary flow passage 12. In one embodiment<br>
of the apparatus employing solvent cleaning, the solvent control valve is<br>
operable to alternate between the introduction of liquid fuel and the<br>
introduction of solvent into capillary flow passage 12, enabling the in-situ<br>
cleaning of capillary flow passage 12 when the solvent is introduced into<br>
capillary flow passage 12.  While a wide variety of solvents have utility,<br>
the solvent may comprise liquid fuel from the liquid fuel source.   When<br>
this is the case, no solvent control valve is required, as there is no need<br>
to alternate between fuel and solvent, and the heat source should be<br>
phased-out or deactivated during the cleaning of capillary flow passage<br>
12.<br>
[0071]	FIG. 7 presents another exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention. A fuel-vaporizing device 200 for use in the apparatus of the present invention has a heated capillary flow passage 212 for delivering liquid fuel F. Heat is provided by heat source 220, which is arranged along capillary flow passage 212. As is most preferred, heat source 220 is provided by forming capillary flow passage 212 from a tube of electrically resistive material, a portion of capillary flow passage 212 forming a heater element when a source of electrical current is connected to the tube at connections 222 and 224 for delivering current therethrough,<br>
[0072]	in order to clean deposits formed during operation of fuel<br>
vaporizing device 200, an axially moveable rod 232 is positioned through<br>
opening 236 of end cap 234 of device body 230 so as to be-in axial<br>
alignment with the opening of inlet end 214 of capillary flow passage<br>
212.   Packing material 238 is provided within the interior volume of end<br>
cap 234 for sealing. Referring now to FIG. 7A, axial moveable rod 232 is<br>
shown fully extended within capillary flow passage 212,   As may be<br>
appreciated, selecting the diameter of axial moveable rod 232 for minimal<br>
wall clearance within the interior of capillary flow passage 212 produces<br>
a combination capable of removing substantially all of the deposits built<br>
up along the interior surface of capillary flow passage 212 during the<br>
operation of fuel vaporizing device 200.<br>
[0073]	FIG. 8 shows a schematic of an apparatus in accordance<br>
with the invention which includes a free-piston Stirling engine 30, a combustion chamber 34 wherein heat at 550-750Â°C is converted into mechanical power by a reciprocating piston which drives an alternator 32 to produce electrical power. The assembly also includes a capillary flow passage/heater assembly 36, a controller 38, a rectifier/regulator 40, a battery 42, a fuel supply 44, a recuperator 46, a combustion blower 48, a cooler 50, and a cooler/blower 52. In operation, the controller 38 is<br>
operable to control delivery of fuel to the capillary 36 and to control<br>
combustion of the fuel in the chamber 34 such that the heat of combustion<br>
drives a piston in the Stirling engine such that the engine outputs electricity<br>
from the alternator 32.   If desired, the Stirling engine/alternator can be<br>
replaced with a kinematic Stirling engine that outputs mechanical power.<br>
Examples of combustion chambers and air preheating arrangements can<br>
be found  in   U.S.  Patent  Nos.  4,277,942,  4,352,269,  4,384,457 and<br>
4,392,350, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
[0074]	FIG. 9 presents a partial cross-sectional schematic view of a<br>
power-producing device in accordance with another embodiment of the<br>
invention, which can form part of a heat conversion device such as a<br>
Stirling engine assembly.  As shown in FIG. 9, air delivered to an air inlet<br>
by an air blower enters the combustion chamber 34 and mixes with<br>
vaporized   fuel   delivered   to   the   chamber   by   the   capillary/heater<br>
arrangement 36.  Heat of combustion in the chamber 34 heats the end of<br>
the Stirling engine 30 and a sliding piston reciprocates within an alternator<br>
in a manner that generates electricity.  The chamber 34 can be designed<br>
to allow the exhaust gases to preheat incoming air and thus lower the<br>
energy requirements for combusting the fuel.   For instance, the housing<br>
can include a multiwall arrangement, which allows the incoming air to<br>
circulate in a plenum, which is heated by exhaust gases circulating in an<br>
exhaust passage.  Inlet air (indicated by arrow 55) can be caused to swirl<br>
in the combustion chamber by passing the air through s wirier vanes 56<br>
around the combustion chamber 34. The combusted air-fuel mixture heats<br>
the  heat conversion, device (Stirling engine) 30  and  exhaust gases<br>
(indicated by arrows 57) are removed from the combustion chamber.<br>
[0075]	In general, the power conversion apparatus could include a<br>
liquid fuel source, at least one flow passage (e.g., one or more heated<br>
capillary tubes) through which fuel from the fuel supply is vaporized and<br>
delivered   to  a   combustion   chamber  wherein  the  vaporized  fuel   is<br>
combusted, and heat produced in the combustion chamber is used to drive<br>
a Stirling engine or other heat conversion device.  A heat exchanger can<br>
be used to preheat air as the air travels through air passages in the heat<br>
exchanger thereby maximizing efficiency of the device, i.e., by preheating<br>
the air mixed with the vaporized fuel to support combustion in the<br>
chamber, less fuel is needed to maintain the Stirling engine at a desired<br>
operating temperature. The exhaust gas can travel through exhaust ducts<br>
in the heat exchanger whereby heat from the exhaust gas can be<br>
transferred to the air being delivered to the combustion chamber.<br>
[0076]	The combustion chamber can incorporate any suitable<br>
arrangement wherein air is mixed with the vaporized fuel and/or an air-fuel mixture is combusted. For example, the fuel can be mixed with air in a venturi to provide an air-fuel mixture and the air-fuel mixture can be combusted in a heat-generating zone downstream from the venturi.   In order to initiate combustion, the air-fuel mixture can be confined in an ignition zone in which an igniter such as a spark generator ignites the mixture.  The igniter can be any device capable of igniting the fuel such as   a   mechanical   spark   generator,   an   electrical   spark   generator, resistance heated ignition wire or the like. The electrical spark generator can be powered by any suitable power source, such as a small battery. However,  the   battery  can   be   replaced  with  a   manually operated piezoelectric   transducer   that   generates   an   electric   current   when activated. With such an arrangement, current can be generated electro-mechanically due to compression of the transducer.    For instance, a striker   can   be   arranged   so   as   to   strike   the   transducer  with   a predetermined force when the trigger is depressed.     The electricity generated by the transducer can be supplied to a spark generating mechanism by suitable circuitry.  Such an arrangement could be used to ignite the fuel-air mixture.<br>
[0077]	Some of the electrical power generated by the conversion<br>
device can be stored in a suitable storage device such as a battery or capacitor, which can be used to power the igniter. For example, a manually operated switch can be used to deliver electrical current to a resistance-heating element or directly through a portion of a metal tube,<br>
which vaporizes fuel in the flew passage and/or the electrical current can be supplied to an igniter for initiating combustion of the fuel-air mixture delivered to the combustion chamber.<br>
[0078]	If desired, the heat generated by combusting the fuel could<br>
be used to operate any types of devices that rely on mechanical or<br>
electrical power. For instance, a heat conversion source could be used to<br>
generate electricity for portable electrical equipment such as telephone<br>
communication  devices  (e.g.,  wireless  phones),  portable computers,<br>
power   tools,    appliances,   camping   equipment,   military   equipment,<br>
transportation equipment such as mopeds, powered wheelchairs and<br>
marine   propulsion   devices,   electronic   sensing   devices,   electronic<br>
monitoring   equipment,   battery  chargers,   lighting   equipment,   heating<br>
equipment, etc. The heat conversion device could also be used to supply<br>
power to non-portable devices or to locations where access to an electrical<br>
power grid is not available, inconvenient or unreliable.   Such locations<br>
and/or non-portable devices include remote living quarters and military<br>
encampments, vending machines, marine equipment, etc.<br>
Examples Example 1<br>
[0079]	Tests were performed wherein JP 8 jet fuel was vaporized by<br>
supplying the fuel to a heated capillary flow passage at constant pressure with a micro-diaphragm pump system.   In these tests, capillary tubes of different diameters and lengths were used. The tubes were constructed of 304 stainless steel having lengths of 2.5 to 7.6 cm (1 to 3 in) and internal diameters (ID) and outer diameters (OD), in cm (in), as follows: 0.025 ID/0.046 OD (0.010 ID/0.018 OD), 0.033 ID/0.083 OD (0.013 ID/ 0.033 OD), and 0.043 ID/0.064 OD (0.017 ID/0.025 OD). Heat for vaporizing the liquid fuel was generated by passing electrical current through a portion of the metal tube. The droplet size distribution was measured using a Spray-Tech laser diffraction system manufactured by Malvern.  FIG. 10 presents the results of tests conducted for a capillary tube of 0.025 ID/0.046 OD<br>
 (0.010 ID/0.018 OD).   As shown, results of these tests revealed droplets<br>
having a Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) of between 1.7 and 3.0 um. SMD<br>
is the diameter of a droplet whose surface-to-volume ratio is equal to that<br>
of the entire spray and relates to the spray's mass transfer characteristics.<br>
[0080]	The  apparatus according to  the  present  invention also<br>
produced    measurable    single    and    bimodal    spray    distributions.<br>
Measurements revealed a single mode SMD of 2.3 Âµm and bimodal SMD<br>
of 2.8 Âµm, the 'single mode providing aerosol droplet sizes of mostly<br>
between 1.7 and 4.0 um whereas the bimodal spray distribution provided<br>
80% or more of the aerosol droplets in the range of 1.7 to 4.0 um with the<br>
remainder of droplet sizes in the range of 95 to 300 Âµm.<br>
Example 2<br>
[0081]	Tests were performed using a commercial grade gasoline<br>
that was vaporized by supplying the fuel to a heated capillary flow passage at constant pressure with a micro-diaphragm pump system. In these tests, capillary flow passages of different diameters and lengths were used. The following table shows empirical findings for various capillary tube configurations. (Table Removed)<br>
(<br>
Exarnple 3<br>
[0082]	Tests were conducted to demonstrate the effect of fuel<br>
pressure on fuel flow rate.   FIG. 11 shows the measurements obtained<br><br>
with various tube dimensions for various fuel throughput and fuel pressures, the (â¢) data points indicating a 0.043 ID cm (0.017 in ID), 7.6 cm (3 in) long tube and the (A) data points indicating a 0.010 ID, 7.6 cm (3 in) long tube. The apparatus according to the invention exhibited excellent atomization performance with desired fuel flow versus pressure loss characteristics at fuel throughputs as high as 203.9 kg-m/sec (2000 W). (JP8 fuel flow rate: 1 mg/s = 42.5 W chemical energy).<br>
Example 4<br>
[0083]	Tests were conducted to d emonstrate the benefits of the<br>
oxidation cleaning technique on a heated capillary flow passage using an unadditized, sulfur-free base gasoline known to produce high levels of deposit formation. The capillary flow passage employed for these tests was a 5.08 cm (2.0 in) long heated capillary tube constructed of stainless steel, having an inner diameter of 0.058 cm (0.023 in). Fuel pressure was maintained at 0.7 kg/cm2 (10 psig). Power was supplied to the capillary to achieve various levels of R/R0; where R is the heated capillary resistance and R0 is the capillary resistance under ambient conditions.<br>
[0084]	FIG. 12 presents a graph of fuel flow rate vs. time.   As<br>
shown, for this gasoline containing no detergent additive, significant clogging was experienced in a very short period of time, with a 50% loss in flow rate observed in as little as 10 minutes.<br>
[0085]	After substantial clogging was experienced, fuel flow was<br>
discontinued and air at 0.7 kg/cm2 (10 psig) substituted. Heating was provided during this period and, in as little as one minute later, significant cleaning was achieved, with flow rates returning to prior levels.<br>
Example 5<br>
[0086]	This example demonstrates that clogging is far less severe<br>
in the heated capillary flow passage of Example 4, when a commercial-<br>
grade gasoline employing an effective additive package is employed. As shown in FIG. 13, less than a 10% reduction in fuel flow rate was experienced after running the device for nearly four hours.<br>
Example 6<br>
[0087]	To compare various gasolines and the impact of detergent<br>
additives on clogging, five test fuels were run in the heated capillary flow passage of Example 4. The fuels tested included an unadditized base gasoline containing 300 ppm sulfur, an unadditized base gasoline containing no sulfur, the suliur-free base gasoline with a commercially available after-market additive (additive A) added and the sulfur-free base gasoline with another commercially available after-market additive (additive B) added.<br>
[0088]	As   shown  in   FIG.   14,  the  additized  fuels  performed<br>
similarly, while unadditized fuels experienced severe clogging in less than one hour of operation.<br>
Example 7<br>
[0089]	This  example compares the operation over time  of a<br>
capillary flow passage operating on an unadditized jet fuel (JP-8) to the same capillary flow passage operating on an unadditized No. 2 diesel fuel operated in a capillary flow passage having an I.D. of 0.036 cm (0.014 in) and a 5.1 cm (2 in) length. Fuel pressure was set to 1.1 kg/cm2 (15 psig). Power was supplied to the capillary to achieve a level of R/Ro of 1.19; where R is the heated capillary resistance and R0 is the capillary resistance under ambient conditions.<br>
[0090]	As shown in FIG. 15, the fuels performed similarly over the<br>
first ten minutes of operation, with the diesel fuel suffering more severe clogging thereafter.<br>
Example 8<br>
[0091]	Tests  were   conducted   to   assess  the   efficacy  of the<br>
oxidation cleaning technique on a heated capillary flow passage using an unadditized, No. 2 diesel fuel known to produce high levels of deposit formation. The capillary flow passage employed for these tests was a 5.1 cm (2 in) long heated capillary tube constructed of stainless steel, having an inner diameter of 0.036 cm (0.014 in).   Fuel pressure was maintained at 1.1 kg/cm2 (15 psig).   Power was supplied to the capillary to achieve a level of R/R0 of 1.19; where R, once again, is the heated capillary resistance and R0 is the capillary resistance under ambient conditions.<br>
[0092]	FIG. 16 presents a graph of fuel flow rate vs. time.   As<br>
shown, for this fuel containing no detergent additive, significant clogging<br>
was experienced in a very short period of time, with a 50% loss in flow<br>
rate observed in about 35 minutes of continuous operation.<br>
[0093]	In a second run, after five minutes of operation, fuel flow<br>
was discontinued and air at 0.7 kg/cm2 (10 psig) substituted for a period<br>
of five minutes.   Heating was also provided during this period.   This<br>
procedure was repeated every five minutes.  As shown in FIG. 16, the<br>
oxidation cleaning process increased fuel flow rate in virtually every<br>
instance and tended to slow the overall decline in fuel flow rate over<br>
time.   However, the efficacy of the process was somewhat less than<br>
was achieved using an unadditized gasoline, as described in Example<br>
4.<br>
Example 9<br>
[0094]	Tests were conducted to assess the effect of a commercial<br>
grade anti-fouling detergent additive blended with the No. 2 diesel fuel of Example 8 on fuel flow rate over time in a heated capillary flow passage. The capillary flow passage employed for these tests, once again, was a 5.1 cm (2 in) long heated capillary tube constructed of<br>
stainless steel, having an inner diameter of 0.036 cm (0,014 inch).  Fuel<br>
pressure was  maintained at  1.1   kg/cm2 (15  psig) and  power was<br>
supplied to the capillary to achieve a level of R/R0 of 1.19.<br>
[0095]	FIG. 17 presents a comparison of fuel flow rate vs. time for<br>
the additized No. 2 diesel fuel and an unadditized diesel fuel. As shown, for the fuel containing no detergent additive, significant clogging was experienced in a very short period of time, with a 50% loss in flow rate observed in about 35 minutes of continuous operation, while the same base fuel containing the detergent showed far less clogging over an extended period of time.<br>
