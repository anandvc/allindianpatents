				<td>Isoflavone nanoparticles and use thereof<br>
The present invention is directed to isoflavone nanoparticle compositions comprising an isoflavone in the form of nanoparticles and preferably a carrier. The isoflavone nanoparticle compositions are particularly useful for preparing cosmetic compositions, pharmaceutical compositions, foodstuff, food additives, animal food and animal food additives. In the compositions comprising the isoflavone nanoparticle compositions recrystallization of the isoflavone to bigger particles is retarded. The isoflavone is preferably genistein.<br>
Isoflavones are a group of vegetable dyes belonging to the flavonoids and are derived from isoflavones. The following isoflavones are particularly important:<br><br><br>
(Table &amp; Figure Removed)<br>
One of the most important isoflavones is genistein.<br>
Genistein is a well-known pharmaceutically and cosmetically active ingredient which has anti-bacterial activity. Genistein is a calmodulin-antagonist, and of particular importance is the enzyme-inhibitory activity of genistein e.g. against tyrosine kinases, dopa-carboxylases, etc. Genistein can also be used in insecticides. The chemical name of genistein is 4',5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone, and the compound can be obtained by purification from natural, products, such as soy products (e.g. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 179:661-667, 1991), but it can also be chemically synthesized by methods known in the art. Genistein is commercially available from many suppliers and in a high purity. The chemical structure of genistein is as follows:<br><br>
(Figure Removed) <br><br>
A significant number of publications are directed to genistein and the use thereof, and it can e.g. be referred to US-A 5,824,702, WO 03/068218 or US-A 5,948,814, to mention only three recent ones of the numerous patents and patent applications in this field.<br>
Genistein is normally produced in crystalline powder form e.g. according to a process as disclosed in WO 2004/009576. Such a powder form has a very poor flowability. The poor powder flowability renders the crystalline powder difficult for use in making tablets and other application forms that require the powder to be free flowing. The same problem occurs if one tries to make formulations with other isoflavones.<br>
Furthermore, it is difficult to include isoflavones, in particular genistein e.g. in food supplements in a reasonably high concentration and in a form which provides a high bioavailability of the isoflavone (or genistein).<br>
These problems are particularly addressed in WO 99/38509, which suggests solving these problems by coupling e.g. the Genistein with an amphiphilic carrier to form a micelle having an average diameter of less than about 100 nm. The amphiphilic carriers disclosed in this document are essentially polyethyleneglycolyzed fatty acid glycerides such as those obtained from fully or partially hydrogenated various vegetable oils.<br>
However, such .micelles are difficult to obtain and their field of application is rather limited and only nutritional supplements are disclosed in WO 99/38509.<br>
Regarding topical application forms,,despite the numerous documents describing genistein. and its applications, the presently marketed topical compositions with genistein either contain only very low concentrations of genistein, such as 0.01 wt.-% or less, or contain an organic solubilizer or solvent for genistein, such as ethanol. The presence of organic solvents such as ethanol in topical compositions should, however, be avoided, if possible, since some organic solvents such as ethanol can cause skin irritations.<br>
If one prepares a topical composition which is solely based on water as a solvent and contains higher concentrations of commercially available genistein, such as more than 0.1 wt.-%, in particular more than 0.2 wt-% or 0.5 wt.-% or more genistein, such a topical composition becomes gritty during storage. Applying such a gritty topical composition to the skin can cause irritations, and the consumer acceptance is low, in particular, if the composition is a cosmetic composition. Furthermore, together with becoming gritty the activity of the genistein in the aqueous topical formulation can decrease upon storage.<br>
Nanosuspensions of water-insoluble pharmaceutically active compounds and methods of preparing such nanosuspensions are known in the art, and it can be referred e.g. to US-A 5,858,410 and US-A 5,145,684. These documents disclose many possible active ingredients which can be provided in the form of nanosuspensions, but they are quiet on genistein. Both documents are mainly concerned with a method to increase the bioavailability of a drug, and they do not address topical compositions and problems which occur in topical compositions.<br>
Furthermore, there exist several review articles on drug nanoparticles or micron-sized drug particles, e.g. "Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 47 (2001) 3-19". This document discloses that providing a drug in the form of nanoparticles might increase the saturation solubility and the dissolution velocity of the drug. The document is mainly concerned with the bioavailability of water-insoluble drugs which are for oral or parenteral administration. Topical formulations and problems which might occur in topical formulations are not disclosed. Genistein is not disclosed.<br>
Another review article "Pharmaceutical Development and Technology, Vol. 9, No. 1, pages 1-13,-2004" compares the different processes for producing micron-sized drug particles and their advantages and disadvantages. According to the document, the production of small dry particles is still a challenge, and some problems are discussed which occur, in particular if the small particles are prepared by comminution of bigger dry particles and not by association of molecularly dispersed drug. While the document generally mentions that micronized drugs can be used for intravenous, topical, oral or ophthalmic compositions, the main focus is on pulmonary dry administration and improvement of the bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs. Apart from the above general information, topical compositions are not mentioned and genistein is not mentioned either.<br>
Considering the wide application of isoflavones and in particular of genistein in topical and oral compositions, in solid and liquid compositions, in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and nutritional industry, there is a need to provide isoflavones, and in particular genistein in a form which can easily be handled and formulated into all kinds of application forms, not only at a high concentration in oral compositions but also in topical compositions.<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to provide isoflavones and in particular genistein in a form which meets the above need.<br>
In particular the isoflavones, such as genistein, should be provided in a form which makes it possible to prepare topical aqueous compositions, in particular topical aqueous cosmetic compositions, which are preferably free of ethanol and preferably also free of other organic solvents, and which contain the isoflavone (particularly the genistein) in a high concentration of more than 0.01 wt.-%, but preferably in even much higher concentrations such as 0.3 wt.-% or more. The compositions should be stable during storage for at least three months, preferably for at least six months, more preferably for at least one year and not develop grittyness during this time.<br>
The isoflavones such as the genistein should also be provided in a form which is particularly suitable for food and food additives or beverages or health food such as tofu, yogurt, orange juice etc. where a high bioavailability, mixability, content uniformity, physical stability etc. must be provided.<br>
The present invention is based on the unexpected finding that compositions of isoflavones, in particular of genistein, wherein the isoflavone is not in the form of micelles, are stable, if the isoflavone, optionally together with a carrier and water, is micronized by certain processes to obtain a nanoparticle composition in which the particles have an average particle size of D[4.3] of 3 • ^im or less. Those compositions are designated -herein as isoflavone or genistein nanoparticle compositions.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides the isoflavone nanoparticle compositions and suitable processes for producing the isoflavone nanoparticle compositions.<br>
The isoflavone nanoparticle compositions contain the isoflavone nanoparticles and optionally a carrier and, immediately after their preparation, usually water, however, it is possible to remove the water. Preferably, the compositions consist essentially<br>
(i)	of the isoflavone nanoparticles or<br>
(ii)	of the isoflavone nanoparticles and water or<br>
(iii)	of the isoflavone nanoparticles and a carrier or<br>
(iv)	of the isoflavone nanoparticles and water and a carrier.<br>
"Consisting essentially of means that not more than 10%, preferably not more than 5%, more preferably not more than 2% other components than the specified components are present in the compositions.<br>
The isoflavones are not in the form of micelles as disclosed in WO 99/38509, and such micelles are not formed by the processes of the present invention and the carrier used according to the invention is preferably not an amphiphilic carrier of the type disclosed in WO 99/38509, i.e. a saturated or monounsaturated polyethyleneglycolyzed fatty acid glyceride.<br>
Unexpectedly, the compositions of nanoparticles of an isoflavone and optionally a carrier and optionally water according to the invention can be incorporated into topical aqueous compositions such as cosmetic compositions in high concentrations of 0.3 wt.-% or more,<br>
and these topical compositions do not become gritty upon storage. The activity of the isofiavone in these topical compositions does not decrease either during storage.<br>
The isofiavone nanoparticle compositions are preferably prepared by a high pressure homogenization process, wherein a mixture of an isofiavone, which is preferably crystalline, optionally the carrier and water is subjected to a high pressure homogenizer. Particularly preferred is furthermore a process in which a mixture of an isofiavone, which is preferably crystalline, optionally the carrier and water is subjected to an agitated bead mill. Optionally the resulting suspension is subjected to a drying process.<br>
The compositions of nanoparticles of genistein, optionally a carrier and optionally water, which are provided by the present invention, have never been described in the prior art. In order to avoid confusing these compositions with the pharmaceutical compositions, cosmetic compositions, nutritional compositions and other compositions which are also encompassed by the present invention, the above defined compositions of nanoparticles of isoflavones optionally a carrier and optionally water will be referred to as isofiavone (or genistein) nanoparticle compositions.<br>
The present invention also provides cosmetic compositions, pharmaceutical compositions, foodstuff, beverages, animal food, food additives, insecticides and other principally known isoflavone-containing compositions. Examples of nutritional products are tofu, yogurt, orange juice etc. Included are not only topical compositions but also oral or parenteral compositions containing the isofiavone nanoparticle compositions of the invention. Preferred are pharmaceutical compositions and cosmetic compositions, in particular aqueous topical compositions which are preferably free of ethanol, containing the isofiavone nanoparticle compositions.<br>
The invention furthermore provides processes for producing the isofiavone nanoparticle compositions as defined above. In a preferred process a mixture of isofiavone, which is preferably crystalline, optionally the carrier and water is subjected to a high pressure homogenizer and optionally the resulting suspension is subjected to a drying process. In an even more preferred process, the isofiavone, optionally the carrier and water, is subjected to an agitated bead mill, and the resulting suspension is optionally subjected to a drying process.<br>
The invention will be further described for genistein which is the most preferred isoflavone of the present invention. However, the further description is also valid for the other isoflavones covered by the present invention. It is of course also possible to use a mixture of more than one isoflavone, e.g. of genistein and one or more further isoflavones. The term "isoflavone" as used herein is meant to encompass all those possibilities. -<br>
The genistein nanoparticle compositions of the present invention contain genistein and preferably a carrier. The carrier is not specifically restricted and is generally added to facilitate the formation of a spray-dried powder that can be handled more easily. Without the carrier, the spray-dried powder would be very fine, resulting in low yield and high dusting. In a preferred embodiment the carrier also functions as a stabilizer to minimize the flocculation of nanoparticles in aqueous suspensions, in particular, if the stabilizer is e.g. modified starch, cellulose derivatives, gum acacia and milk protein. Generally, the carrier is selected from one or more carbohydrates, one or more proteins or a mixture of carbohydrates and proteins. Preferred carbohydrates are modified starch, sorbitol, maltose, maltodextrin, gum acacia, pectin, alginate, guar gum, xanthan, cellulose derivatives such as carboxymethylcellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and mixtures thereof. Most preferred are modified starch and mixtures comprising modified starch, and the modified starch is preferably a starch which is hydrophobically modified, so that it can act as a surfactant. An example of such a hydrophobically modified starch is starch sodium octenyl succinate, which is e.g. available under the designation "Capsul" from National Starch and Co., New Jersey, USA.<br>
If the carrier comprises a protein, the protein is preferably selected from gelatin, milk protein, soy protein and mixtures thereof. Furthermore, mixtures of one or more carbohydrates as defined above with one or more proteins as defined above can be used, if appropriate.<br>
Preferred carriers which are contained in the genistein nanoparticle compositions of the present invention are carriers which also have the ability to stabilize an aqueous suspension of the genistein. Such carriers generally contain a hydrophobic part and a hydrophilic part such as hydrophobically modified starch, cellulose derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, gum acacia and milk proteins. These carriers/stabilizers are preferred components of the genistein nanoparticle compositions of the present invention.<br>
However, it should be understood that it is not essential for the invention that the carrier also has a stabilizing function on suspensions of the genistein. The genistein nanoparticle compositions of the invention are preferably used in topical, pharmaceutical or cosmetic compositions which might already contain suspension stabilizers (or the formulation process alone is adequate to resuspend the genistein nanoparticles), and therefore, the presence of a suspension stabilizer in the genistein nanoparticle compositions of the invention is not absolutely necessary. However, if the genistein nanoparticle compositions of the invention already contain a carrier which has also suspension stabilizing activity, it might be possible to reduce the amount of suspension stabilizer in the topical cosmetic or pharmaceutical composition which is prepared with the genistein nanoparticle compositions of the invention. The genistein nanoparticle compositions of the invention are usually prepared as aqueous suspensions containing genistein, a carrier and water. In a preferred embodiment the aqueous suspensions are then subjected to a suitable drying method such as spray-drying or freeze-drying to eliminate most or all of the water and to obtain a granular or powdery product. According to the present invention both compositions-are preferred, the aqueous suspensions containing genistein, water and optionally a carrier and the dry compositions containing genistein and optionally a carrier. Thus, in a preferred embodiment the compositions of the invention consist of genistein, a carrier and optionally water. It should be understood that the term carrier as used therein includes a mixture of several different carriers as defined above.<br>
If the genistein nanoparticle compositions of the present invention are powder compositions or granular compositions, they comprise preferably at least 1 wt.-% of genistein, preferably 20 wt.-% or more, more preferably 50 wt.-% of genistein or more with 90 wt.-% of genistein or more also being preferred. The rest of the genistein nanoparticle compositions is the optional carrier and, depending on the drying process, residual water which is not removed from the genistein nanoparticle composition. Thus, preferably the genistein nanoparticle composition contains 99 wt.-% or less of carrier and, if applicable, residual water, preferably 80 wt.-% or less, more preferably 50 wt.-% or less of carrier and, if applicable, residual water, and 10 wt.-% or less of carrier and, if applicable, residual water is also preferred. Preferably the genistein nanoparticle compositions of the present invention contain at least 1 wt.-% of carrier and, if applicable, residual water, preferably the genistein nanoparticle compositions of the present invention contain 5 wt.-% or more of carrier and, if applicable, residual water. Preferred granular or powder genistein nanoparticle compositions contain genistein in an amount from 1 to 99 wt.-%, from 30 to 95 wt.-%, from 30 to 95 wt.-%, from<br>
50 to 95 wt.-%, from 70 to 95 wt.-%, from 70 to 90 wt.-%, from 90 to 99 wt.-%, from 90 to 95 wt.-%, the rest being carrier and, if applicable, residual water. Of course, compositions not containing a carrier but only genistein and, if applicable, residual water are also preferred. The genistein nanoparticle compositions in the form of a powder can be prepared from the aqueous suspensions described below by a conventional spray drying process or a freeze drying process.<br>
If the genistein nanoparticle composition of the present invention is in the form of an aqueous suspension containing genistein, optionally a carrier and water, the amount of water is not particularly restricted, but generally these aqueous compositions will contain 0.5% or more, preferably 3% or more, preferably 5% or more of genistein and optionally a carrier, more preferably 10% or more, more preferably 20% or more, 30% or more, 40% or more or 50% or more of genistein and optionally carrier, the rest being water, wherein the relative amounts of genistein and carrier are as defined above. The minimum amount of water which is present in the aqueous suspensions is the amount necessary to form a suspension. The aqueous suspensions of the invention can be directly obtained from the production process and in this case the amount of solid particles in the suspension and thus also the amount of water in the suspension depends on the equipment which is used for preparing the suspension. If a higher solids content should be provided, it is possible to remove water from the aqueous suspension as required, e.g. by evaporation, preferably at constant temperature. Preferred are aqueous suspensions which are directly obtained by high pressure homogenization or by agitated ball milling (wet grinding) of genistein and optionally a carrier, and such suspensions usually contain 40% or more of water. Aqueous suspensions which contain 50% or more of water, the rest being genistein and optionally a carrier in relative amounts as defined above, are also preferred.<br>
Preferred compositions are also compositions containing genistein in an amount in the range of 10 to 50 wt.-% and carrier in an amount of a ratio of genistein to carrier in the range of 10:1 to 1:10, preferably 10:1 to 1:1 or 1:1 to 1:5 such as about 1:2, the rest of the composition being water, such as compositions containing 25% of genistein, 5% of carrier and 70% of water. Preferred are also compositions containing 10 to 30% of genistein (preferred 15 to 25% of genistein, particularly about 20% of genistein), 15 to 40% of carrier (preferred 20 to 30% of carrier, particularly about 25% of carrier) and the rest being water.<br>
n important feature of the genistein nanoparticle compositions of the invention is the particle size of the genistein, which is 3 urn or less, preferably 1 |jm or less, such as about 0.5 um. Preferred ranges of the average particle size of the genistein in the genistein nanoparticle compositions of the invention are 0.05 to 3 urn, more preferred 0.05 to 1 urn, still more preferred 0.05 to 0.5 um. Furthermore, a particle size of 0.3 to 1.0 urn is preferred. Preferred are also the above ranges with 0.1 instead of 0.05 as lower limit for the average particle size. All particle sizes above are average particle sizes D[4,3], i.e. volume mean diameters or De Brouckere mean diameters. Preferably, the particle size of the genistein particles according to D[3,2] are within the ranges of 0.05 to 0.5, preferably of 0.1 to 0.2, where D[3,2] is the surface mean diameter or the sauter mean diameter. All measurements of particle size referred to in this specification are made by laser diffraction technique using a "Matersizer 2000" of Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK, and further information on the above particle sizes D[4,3] and D[3,2] can e.g. be found in "Basic principles of particle size analytics", Dr. Alan Rawle, Malvern Instruments Limited, Engima Business Part, Grovewood Road, Malvern, Worcestershire, WR14 1XZ, UK and the "Manual of Malvern particle size analyzer".<br>
Applicants do not wish to be bound by theory, and it is not known whether the particles in the carrier containing genistein nanoparticle composition of the present invention contain a mixture of genistein and carrier, which means that genistein and the carrier are present in the same particle, or whether particles of genistein and particles of carrier are independently present in the genistein nanoparticle compositions. It is also possible that the genistein nanoparticle composition contains particles which consist solely of genistein, particles which comprise both genistein and carrier and particles which consist solely of carrier. All these possibilities are included within the present invention, and if the genistein nanoparticle compositions of the present invention comprise particles which contain both genistein and carrier, the above particle size refers to the particle as such comprising both genistein and the carrier.<br>
If nothing else is stated, in this application parts and percentages are per weight and are based on the weight of the composition.<br>
The genistein nanoparticle compositions of the invention can be used for all purposes for which genistein has been used in the prior art, but in particular genistein nanoparticle compositions of the present invention are for use in pharmaceutical compositions, cosmetic<br>
ompositions, foodstuff, animal food or food additives with food additives and cosmetic compositions being most preferred.<br>

Particularly preferred are cosmetic and pharmaceutical compositions, still more preferred are cosmetic compositions.<br>
The term "cosmetic preparation" or "cosmetic composition" as used in the present application refers to cosmetic compositions as defined under the heading "Kosmetika" in Rompp Lexikon Chernie, 10th edition 1997, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, New York.<br>
The cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention contain the genistein nanoparticle compositions of the present invention together with cosmetically or pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or diluents. If nothing else is stated, the excipients, additives, diluents, etc. mentioned in the following are suitable for both pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions.<br>
The topical cosmetic and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention preferably comprise more than 0.01%, preferably 0.1% or more, more preferably 0.2% or more of the nanoparticles of genistein and optionally a carrier. However, the effect which is achieved by incorporating the genistein nanoparticle compositions into the topical cosmetic and pharmaceutical compositions is most impressive in pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions containing 0.3% or more of genistein, because at these high concentrations the topical pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions of the present invention have a particularly low increase in the particle size of the genistein nanoparticles during storage (and sometimes there is even a decrease). The effect at such high concentrations is much more pronounced than at lower concentrations of less than 0.3%, which is particularly surprising and advantageous, because it allows the provision of cosmetic and pharmaceutical compositions having very high concentrations of genistein, which could not be obtained using prior art genistein compositions. Therefore, the cosmetic and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention will contain the nanoparticles containing Genistein and optionally a carrier in a concentration of preferably 0.3% or more, more preferably 0.5% or more. The following ranges of nanoparticies of genistein and optionally carrier are also preferred: 0.3% to 3%, 0.3% to 2%, 0.3% to 1% and the above ranges, where the lower limit is 0.4 or 0.5% instead of 0.3%.<br>
Regarding the kind of the topical cosmetic and pharmaceutical composition and the preparation of the topical cosmetic and pharmaceutical preparations as well as for further suitable additives, it can be referred to the pertinent literature, e.g. to Novak G.A., Die kosmetischen Praparate - Band 2, Die kosmetischen Praparate - Rezeptur, Rohstoffe, wissenschaftliche Grundlagen (Verlag fur Chem. Industrie H. Ziolkowski KG, Augsburg).<br>
It is furthermore possible to include the genistein nanoparticle compositions of the present invention into oral cosmetic and pharmaceutical composition, e.g. in the form of pills, tablets, capsules that may contain granules or pellets, as a liquid, oral formulation or as an<br>
erson. Useful procedures and useful additives for preparing oral compositions are e.g. disclosed in the standard literature Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, Lippincot, Williams &amp; Wilking (Editors) 2000, which is included herein by reference. It is preferred to incorporate the compositions of the present invention into foodstuff and in particular into animal, food, more particularly into pet food. How to prepare such foodstuff is known in the art.<br>
As usual additives for oral compositions, in particular for tablets, usual excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, disodium or dipotassium phosphate, sodium or potassium phosphate, glycine, disintegration agents such as starch or alginic acid, binders such as polyvinylpyrolidone, saccharose, gelatin and gum arable, lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate or talcum can be used. If the compositions are filed into gelatin capsules, usual additives for the preparation of granules are lactose or lactate as well as polyethylene glycols with a high molecular weight. Further additives and excipients as well as additives and excipients for other oral .formulations and for food additives are known to a skilled person, and it can be referred to the pertinent literature such as "Grundzuge der Lebensmitteltechnik", Horst Dieter Tscheuschner (Editor), 2. Edition, Hamburg, Beers 1996.<br>
The composition can also contain one or more additional pharmaceutically or cosmetically active ingredients, in particular for preventing or reducing acne, wrinkles, lines, atrophy, inflammation, as well as topical anesthetics, artificial tanning agents and accelerators, antimicrobial agents, and antifungal agents and sunscreen additives.<br>
Examples are peptides (e.g., Matrixyl™ [pentapeptide derivative]), glycerol, urea, guanidine (e.g., amino guanidine); vitamins and derivatives thereof such as ascorbic acid, vitamin A (e.g., retinoid derivatives such as retinyl palmitate or retinyl propionate), vitamin E (e.g., tocopherol acetate), vitamin B3 (e.g., niacinamide) and vitamin B5 (e.g., panthenol) and the like and mixtures thereof, wax-based synthetic peptides (e.g., octyl palmitate and tribehenin and sorbitan isostearate-and palmitoyl-oligopeptide), anti-acne medicaments (resorcinol, salicylic acid, and the like); antioxidants (e.g., phytosterols, lipoic acid); flavonoids (e.g., isoflavones, phytoestrogens); skin soothing and healing agents such as aloe vera extract, allantoin and the like; chelators and sequestrants; and agents suitable for aesthetic purposes such as essential oils, fragrances, skin sensates, opacifiers, aromatic compounds (e.g., clove oil, menthol, camphor, eucalyptus oil, and eugenol), desquamatory actives, anti-<br><br>
acne actives, vitamin B3 compounds, anti-oxidants, peptides, hydroxy acids, radical scavengers, chelators, farnesol, anti-inflammatory agents, topical anesthetics, tanning actives, skin-lightening agents, anti-celiulites agents, flavonoids, antimicrobial actives, and antifungal actives, in particular bisabolol, alkyldiols such as 1,2-pentanediol, hexanediol or 1,2-octanediol, vitamins, panthenol, phytol, phytanetriol, ceramides and pseudoceramides, amino acids and bioactive peptides, protein hydrolysates, AHA acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, plant extracts, DNA or RNA and their fragmentation products or carbohydrates, biotin, conjugated fatty acids, carnitin, vitamin E, A, C, B3, B6, B12, oligopeptides, carnosine, biochinonen, phytofluen, phytoen, folic acid, and their corresponding derivatives.<br>
The content of the genistein in the oral cosmetic and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention is usually about 0.1% to 90%, preferably about 1% to 80%. Typically in pharmaceutical compositions, such as a tablet, the genistein can go as high as 50%, but preferably it is in the 1% - 10% range. The application is such that the desired effect occurs and depends on the patient and the desired effect. A usual daily dosage can be in a range from about 1 mg/day to 1 g/day, e.g. about 5 mg/day to 100 mg/day.<br>
The cosmetic and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can also be in the form of injectable compositions, in particular if the compositions are for promoting hair growth. The preparation of injectable cosmetic and pharmaceutical compositions is known to a skilled person, and it can be referred to the pertinent literature, in particular to Remington already cited above.<br>
According to the invention nutritional products containing the genistein nanoparticle compositions of the invention are also preferred, such as yogurt, tofu, fruit juices such as orange juice, etc. The content of the genistein nanoparticles is not particularly restricted, but usually the content of genistein in these products is 0.01% or more, preferably 0.1% or more, but generally not higher than 10% or 5%. The oral pharmaceutical and nutritional products of the present invention have the particular advantage that the genistein has a high bioavailability combined with an unexpected high physical stability (the genistein particles do not grow to an unacceptable size).<br>
The genistein nanoparticle compositions of the present invention are preferably obtained by fragmentation of genistein crystals and optionally the carrier in a high pressure homogenizer. The genistein nanoparticle compositions of the present invention are more<br>
preferably obtained by milling genistein (in particular genistein crystals) and optionally carrier in an agitated bead mill. The fragmentation and milling is usually carried out with an aqueous suspension.<br>
Suitable homogenizers are known in the prior art and commercially available and for example it can be referred to DeBEE 2000 high pressure homogenizer of B.E.E. International Ltd., Migdal Haemek, Israel. The homogenizer is preferably operated at a pressure from 500 bar to 4000 bar, more preferably at a pressure from 500 bar to 3000 bar, most preferably at a pressure from 500 bar to 2000 bar. Preferably, the homogenizer is equipped with a nozzle system as disclosed in EP-A 1 008 380.<br>
Preferably the genistein and the carrier are cycled through the high pressure homogenizer 1 to 200 times, more preferably 5 to 100 times, such as 5 to 30 times. The required number of cycles can easily be found by some routine experiments.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment first the genistein without the carrier is subjected to a homogenization in a high pressure homogenizer, for example for 5 to 100 times, such as 5 to 30 times, then a solution of the carrier is added and homogenization is continued for example for further 1 to 50, such as 1 to 10 cycles. If necessary, the number of cycles can be increased.<br>
It is believed that during homogenization the genistein crystals are fragmented mostly by cavitation and shearing created in the high pressure process, and the aqueous nanosuspension which is processed can have a solid content of up to 50% or even more. The aqueous nanosuspension can be used as such for preparing the pharmaceutical or cosmetic compositions of the present invention or it can first be subjected to a drying step in order to obtain a powder or granular composition consisting essentially of genistein, optionally the carrier and eventually residual water which is not removed by the drying process. The drying can be done by usual processes such as spray-drying or freeze-drying.<br>
The genistein nanoparticle compositions of the present invention are most preferably obtained by fragmentation in an agitated bead mill by a wet grinding process. Suitable wet grinding mills are known in the prior art and commercially available and for example it can be referred to Netzsch LMZ 4 wet grinding mill of NETZSCH-Feinmahltechnik GmbH, Sedanstrafie 70, 95100 Selb, Germany. Preferably the genistein and optionally the carrier<br>
are cycled through the agitated bead mill 1-50 times, more preferably 3-40 times, more preferably 5-30 times and most preferably 8-25 times.<br>
The grinding media can consist e.g. essentially of AI2O3, Si3N4, TiO2, WC (tungsten carbide) or of Zr02 or.a combination of those compounds. Most preferably ZrO2-type grinding media like Zr02 stabilized with Y203 are used.<br>
The aqueous nanosuspension which is processed can have a solids content of up to 25% or even more.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the water is removed as much as possible by choosing suitable drying conditions, and the water content is lower than e.g. 10%.<br>

O/W emulsions with different genistein forms<br><br>
(Table  Removed)The advantage of using the genistein form consisting of nanoparticles versus the conventional crystalline form in typical cosmetic formulations is illustrated by Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. Cosmetic formulations containing active ingredients should be stable upon storage at different temperatures for at least one year at room temperature. One important parameter monitored in a stability watch is the appearance of the cosmetic formulation under a microscope. Cosmetic formulations containing difficult to solubilize active ingredients will very often develop crystals upon storage, sometimes just within a few days. This phenomenon is even more pronounced by observing formulations which were stored at 5°C. There are many drawbacks with formulations which have developed such large crystals as illustrated in Fig. 2, which shows a microscopical examination of formulation #2 with conventional crystalline genistein after 6 months storage at room temperature, namely the reduced bioavailability of the active ingredient to the skin and the risk for the cosmetic consumer to perceive their presence upon application to the skin. As illustrated by Fig. 1, which shows a microscopical examination of formulation #1 with stabilized nanoparticles of genistein after 6 months storage at room temperature, the same cosmetic preparation with<br>
stabilized nanoparticles of genistein is perfectly stable, even after storage of 6 months at room temperature.<br>
Example 9<br>
O/W emulsions with different genistein forms<br><br>
(Table  Removed)To further illustrate the benefits obtained with nanoparticles of genistein versus conventional crystalline genistein, the cosmetic formulations described above (#3 and #4) were submitted to a very challenging stability test: The formulations were stored at. a temperature varying from 5°C to 43°C every 24 hours during 3 weeks. The appearance of the formulations was observed under a microscope and is illustrated by Fig. 3, which shows a microscopical examination of formulation #3 with stabilized nanoparticles of genistein after 19 days storage'at 5°C/43°C (cycles of 24 hours at each temperature), and Fig. 4, which shows a microscopical examination of formulation #4 with conventional crystalline genistein after 19 days storage at 5°C/43°C (cycles of 24 hours at each temperature).<br>
As illustrated by Fig. 3 the nanoparticles of genistein are still very finely dispersed in the cosmetic preparation, contrary to Fig. 4 which illustrates that conventional crystalline genistein in the same preparation has formed large crystals.<br>
Example 10<br>
To force the crystallization in a disperse system, a test was used in which the temperature is changed over a self-defined timeframe and in self-defined sequences. The test is called •"swing" test (changing temperature test). The purpose of this test is to dissolve small particles at the higher temperature and to force re-crystallization at lower temperature. But it is also a stress testing method which shows if a formulation is stable. The following formulations were used for the "swing" test:<br><br>
(Table  Removed)Manufacturing specifications:<br>
Oil- and water phase (o + w) were separately heated up to 70°C (± 5°C) and were added together. The thickening agent (t) was added under moderate agitation. The mixture was homogenized for 30 seconds at 24'000 RPM by means of an Ultra-Turrax T25 homogenizer. The emulsion was cooled down slowly to 45°C ± 5°C under moderate stirring (horseshoe mixer, 120 RPM). At this temperature the pH value was adjusted to pH 6.5-7D by adding base (b). Genistein (g) was added to the still fluid emulsion and was incorporated by homogenizing again for 30 sec. 24'000 RPM by means of an Ultra-Turrax T25<br>
homogenizer. The formulation was cooled down to 25°C ± 5°C under moderate stirring (horseshoe mixer, 120 RPM). •<br>
Standard stability assessment:<br>
As a standard stability test the following conditions were used: the formulated cosmetic samples were stored: 5°C ± 2°C, ambient temperature (e.g. 20-25°C) and 43°C ± 2°C with checkpoints after 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. A few samples show crystal growth not before 3 months, which means that a long period goes by where no statement of future morphologic stability can be made.<br>
Stability assessment by "swing" test:<br>
To force this crystallization the "swing" test was used and as minimum and maximum temperatures 5°C and 43°C were chosen. Each temperature was held over a period of 24 hours. The duration of this test was at first set to 20 days, which means that the samples run through a cooling/heating sequence (= 1 sequence) 10 times.<br>
Figures 5 to 7 show the results of the "swing" test. Genistein-containing emulsions where prepared as described above using the genistein nanoparticle compositions as described below. The following genistein samples and concentrations were employed and the emulsions were measured immediately after preparation and after subjecting the samples to ten sequences of the "swing" test:<br>
Figure 5(a): Composition of example 3 in a concentration of 0.3% Figure 5(b): Composition of example 3 in a concentration of 0.5% Figure 5(c): Composition of example 3 in a concentration of 1.0%<br>
Figure 6(a): Composition of example 6 in a concentration of 0.3% Figure 6(b): Composition of example 6 in a concentration of 0.5% Figure 6(c): Composition of example 6 in a concentration of 1.0%<br>
Figure 7(a):    Composition of example 7, after dry grinding in a Jet mill in a concentration of<br>
0.3%<br>
Figure 7(b):    Composition of example 7 after dry grinding in a Jet mill in a concentration of<br><br>
Figure 7(c): Composition of example 7 after dry grinding in a Jet mill in a concentration of 0.1%<br>
Figure 8(a):    Composition	of example	7 final product as described in example 7 in a<br>
concentration of 0.3%                      .	<br>
Figure 8(b):    Composition	of example	7 final product as described in example 7 in a<br>
concentration of 0.5%<br>
Figure 8(c):    Composition	of example	7 final product as described in example 7 in a<br>
concentration of 1.0%.<br>
The magnification was the same in all figures, and a distance of 500 urn is indicated in figure 5(a).<br>
It can be seen that even under the severe conditions of the "swing" test the topical cosmetic compositions of the present invention do not show any increase in the particle size, even in very high concentrations of 0.3 to 1.0%. The "swing" test in fact had no effect on the particle size or the particle distribution.<br>
Contrary thereto, in figure 7, where genistein was used before milling or homogenization, the particle size significantly changed during the "swing" test. Huge crystals are formed and clusters of crystals can be seen after ten sequences.<br><br><br><br>
