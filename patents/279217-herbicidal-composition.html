HERBICIDAL COMPOSITION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a herbicidal<br>
composition which improves the herbicidal effect of a<br>
herbicidal sulfonylurea compound or its salt by use of a<br>
polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether phosphate or its salt.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Heretofore, in cultivation of crop plants in<br>
cropland, it has been desired to control weeds which<br>
inhibit the growth or the harvest of crop plants.<br>
Further, in non-cropland also, it is beneficial for<br>
utilization of the non-cropland to effectively control<br>
weeds. Thus, control of weeds is necessary in each of<br>
cropland and non-cropland, and various herbicides have<br>
been used. However, in recent years, there is a movement<br>
to reduce the dosage of a herbicidally active ingredient<br>
as far as possible, so as to reduce the environment load<br>
at a site where the herbicide is applied or the periphery<br>
thereof.<br>
For example, blending of a nonionic surfactant with<br>
a spray solution is known to improve the herbicidal<br>
effect and to reduce the dosage of the herbicide, and an<br>
alkylaryl polyglycol ether type surfactant (tradename:<br>
 <br>
Citowett, manufactured by BASF France) may be mentioned<br>
as a general purpose product.  Further, EP0598515<br>
discloses remarkable improvement of the herbicidal effect<br>
by blending of an ethoxylated fatty amine type surfactant<br>
with a vegetable oil and/or a mineral oil in application<br>
of nicosulfuron or primisulfuron as a specific herbicidal<br>
sulfonylurea compound.<br>
Patent Document 1:  EP0598515<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
OBJECT TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE INVENTION<br>
It has been desired to improve the effect of a<br>
herbicidally active ingredient and to reduce the dosage<br>
as far as possible, so as to reduce the environment load<br>
on a site where the herbicide is applied or the periphery<br>
thereof more than ever.<br>
MEANS TO ACCOMPLISH THE OBJECT<br>
The present inventors have conducted extensive<br>
studies to accomplish the above object and as a result,<br>
found that the herbicidal effect of a herbicidal<br>
sulfonylurea compound or its salt can be remarkably<br>
improved by use of a specific compound, and accomplished<br>
the present invention.<br>
Namely, the present invention relates to a<br>
herbicidal composition comprising (1) a herbicidal<br>
sulfonylurea compound or its salt and (2) a<br>
 <br>
polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether phosphate or its salt.  The<br>
present invention further relates to a method for<br>
controlling undesired plants or inhibiting their growth,<br>
which comprises applying (1) a herbicidal sulfonylurea<br>
compound or its salt and (2) a polyoxyalkylene alkyl<br>
ether phosphate or its salt, to the undesired plants or<br>
to a place where they grow.  Still further, the present<br>
invention relates to a method for improving the<br>
herbicidal effect of (1) a herbicidal sulfonylurea<br>
compound or its salt, by using (2) a polyoxyalkylene<br>
alkyl ether phosphate or its salt.<br>
EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, the herbicidal<br>
effect of a herbicidal sulfonylurea compound (hereinafter<br>
referred to as a SU compound) or its salt is effectively<br>
brought about and improved by a polyoxyalkylene alkyl<br>
ether phosphate (hereinafter referred to as a POA alkyl<br>
ether phosphate) or its salt.  Further, the dosage of the<br>
herbicide can be reduced by the POA alkyl ether phosphate<br>
or its salt, whereby the environment load on a site where<br>
the herbicide is applied or the periphery thereof can be<br>
remarkably reduced and further, the reduction in the<br>
dosage of the herbicide contributes to remarkable<br>
reduction in the cost required for storage or<br>
transportation.<br>
 <br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The herbicidal composition of the present invention<br>
comprises a SU compound or its salt and a POA alkyl ether<br>

compound or its salt is formulated by using various<br>
additives, the formulation is diluted with e.g. water<br>
together with a POA alkyl ether phosphate or its salt,<br>
and the diluted liquid is applied to undesired plants or<br>
to a place where they grow, or (2) a SU compound or its<br>
salt, and a POA alkyl ether phosphate or its salt, are<br>
formulated together with various additives, and the<br>
resulting formulation diluted with e.g. water or as it is<br>
without dilution, is applied to undesired plants or to a<br>
place where they grow.<br>

In the present invention, a salt as a coadjuvant may<br>
be used if required, in order to more significantly<br>
improve the herbicidal effect of the SU compound or its<br>
salt, to expand the range of weeds to be controlled<br>
against which the herbicidal effect is exhibited, or to<br>
expand the timing for the application of the herbicide.<br>
Such a salt may be either an inorganic salt or an organic<br>
salt.  The inorganic salt may, for example, be a<br>
phosphate such as Na2HPO4, NaH2PO4, K2HPO4 or KH2PO4.  The<br>
organic salt may, for example, be an aliphatic<br>
carboxylate such as a citrate, a succinate, a malate, an<br>
oxalate, a lactate, a gluconate or a heptonate, an<br>
aminopolycarboxylate such as a salt of<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a salt of<br>
iminodiacetic acid (IDA), a salt of nitrilotriacetic acid<br>
 <br>
(NTA), a salt of ethylene glycol bis(2-aminoethyl ether)-<br>
N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a salt of<br>
ethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), or a salt of<br>
cyclohexanediaminetetraacetic acid (CDTA), an amino acid<br>
salt, a hydroxycarboxylate or an aromatic carboxylate.<br>
Among them, the inorganic salt is preferably a phosphate.<br>
The organic salt is preferably a citrate, an oxalate, a<br>
succinate, an EDTA salt or an amino acid salt.  The amino<br>
acid salt is more preferably glutamate.  The salt is<br>
preferably a sodium salt.<br>
The herbicidal composition of the present invention<br>
may be either in a form such that the herbicidal<br>
composition containing the SU compound or its salt, and<br>
the POA alkyl ether phosphate or its salt, or a<br>
surfactant containing it, are mixed, for example, at the<br>
time of application, or in a form such that they are<br>
preliminarily formulated.  The same applies to a case<br>
where a salt as a coadjuvant is used. Various additives<br>
may be used if desired, when the SU compound or its salt<br>
and the POA alkyl ether phosphate or its salt are<br>
formulated, or when a salt as a coadjuvant is further<br>
added to the above compounds and formulated.  The<br>
additives to be used are not particularly limited so long<br>
as they can be used in this technical field, and examples<br>
thereof include another surfactant (a surfactant other<br>
than a surfactant containing the POA alkyl ether<br>
phosphate or its salt), a carrier, a binder, a vegetable<br>
 <br>
oil, a mineral oil, an anti-settling agent, a thickener,<br>
an antifoaming agent and an antifreezing agent.<br>
Formulation may be carried out in accordance with a<br>
conventional method in this technical field.<br>
In the present invention, a herbicidal compound<br>
other than the SU compound or its salt may be mixed or<br>
used in combination if desired, whereby more excellent<br>
effects or activity is exhibited in some cases.  For<br>
example, it may sometimes be possible to improve e.g. the<br>
range of the weeds to be controlled, the timing for the<br>
application of the herbicide or the herbicidal activities.<br>
The SU compound or its salt and another herbicidal<br>
compound may be individually prepared and mixed at the<br>
time of application, or they may be formulated together<br>
and applied.  Such another herbicidal compound may<br>
suitably be selected from the following compound groups<br>
(1) to (11) (common names including ones under<br>
application for approval by ISO).  Even when not<br>

In the present invention, the mix ratio of the SU<br>
compound or its salt to the POA alkyl ether phosphate or<br>
its salt can not generally be defined since it is<br>
suitably changed depending upon the types of the SU<br>
compound and the POA alkyl ether phosphate, the types of<br>
the formulations, weather conditions, the type or the<br>
size of weeds to be controlled, etc. However, the mix<br>
ratio is, for example, from 13:1 to 1:10,000, preferably<br>
from 6:1 to 1.-3,000, more preferably from 3:1 to 1:300,<br>
furthermore preferably from 1:1 to 1:30, by weight ratio.<br>
In the present invention, in a case where a salt as<br>
a coadjuvant is further used, the ratio of the POA alkyl<br>
ether phosphate or its salt to such a salt can not<br>
generally be defined since it is suitably changed<br>
depending upon the type of the SU compound or its salt,<br>
the type of the POA alkyl ether phosphate or its salt,<br>
the type of such a salt, the types of the formulations,<br>
weather conditions, the type or the size of weeds to be<br>
 <br>
controlled, etc. However, the ratio is, for example,<br>
from 500:1 to 1:5, preferably from 50:1 to 1:1, more<br>
preferably from 25:1 to 1:1, by weight ratio.<br>
Further, the mix ratios for various applications are<br>
as follows for example.<br>
(1)	In a case where the SU compound or its salt is<br>
formulated by using various additives, the obtained<br>
formulation is diluted with e.g. water together with the<br>
POA alkyl ether phosphate or its salt, and the diluted<br>
liquid is applied to undesired plants or to a place where<br>
they grow, the application can be carried out as follows.<br>
That is, when the formulated SU compound or its salt and<br>
the POA alkyl ether phosphate or its salt are diluted<br>
with e.g. water in an amount of from 3 0 to 5,00 0 L/ha,<br>
preferably from 50 to 2,000 L/ha, the POA alkyl ether<br>
phosphate or its salt is added in an amount of from 0.005<br>
to 4 wt%, preferably from 0.01 to 2 wt%, based on the<br>
diluted liquid.<br>
(2)	In a case where the SU compound or its salt, and the<br>
POA alkyl ether phosphate or its salt, are formulated<br>
together with various additives, and the obtained<br>
formulation diluted with e.g. water or as it is without<br>
dilution, is applied to undesired plants or to a place<br>
where they grow, the application can be carried out as<br>
follows.  That is, the SU compound or its salt and the<br>
POA alkyl ether phosphate or its salt are blended to be<br>
within the above weight ratio, followed by application.<br>
 <br>
(3)	In a case where one or more other herbicidal<br>
compounds are mixed with the SU compound or its salt, the<br>
application can be carried out in accordance with the<br>
blend ratio in the above (1) or (2).<br>
(4)	In a case where a salt as a coadjuvant is further<br>
used in each of the above cases (1), (2) and (3), the<br>
application can be carried out as follows. Namely, at<br>
the time of dilution with e.g. water as described above,<br>
the salt as a coadjuvant is added in an amount of from<br>
0.0001 to 0.05 wt%, preferably from 0.001 to 0.02 wt%,<br>
based on the diluted liquid, followed by application.<br>
The herbicidal composition of the present invention<br>
is capable of controlling a wide range of undesired<br>
plants such as sedges (or cyperaceae) such as rice<br>
flatsedge (Cyperus iria L.) or purple nutsedge (Cyperus<br>
rotundus L.) , grasses (or gramineae) such as<br>
