Back ground Art<br>
One of the approaches against thrombosis is the inhibition of the enzyme activity towards thrombin. Recently, compounds having antagonistic effects on thrombin receptors are expected to exhibit excellent effects for the treatment and prevention of Ihrombin-related diseases such as thrombosis, vascular restenosis, deep phlebothrombosis. pulmonary embolism, cerebral infarction, cardiac diseases, dis.seminated intravascular coagulation syndrome, hypertension, inflammatory diseases, rheumatism, asthma, glomerulonephritis, osteoporosis, nerve disorders, malignant tumors, and so on. Accordingly, there was a need for thrombin receptor antagonists that satisfy points such as pharmacological activity, receptor specificity to thrombin receptors, safety, dose and oral usefulness.<br><br><br><br>
(hereinafter, it may be referred to as "morpholine-substituted phenacyl derivative (B)).<br>
A method of producing the fluorinated cyclic benzamidine derivative (A) is described as dissolving 4,5-diethoxy-3-fluorophthalomtrile, which is represented by the following formula, in ethylacetate-ethanol-methanol, and adding platmum oxide.<br><br>
However, this method has a low yield of the desired compound, leads to formation of<br><br>
numerous by-products, and requires purification immediately after the reaction due to product instability.   Furthermore, since the products have high adsorptivity for the platinum catalyst, treatments to avoid hazardous ignition from the remaining platinum catalyst are necessary even after catalyst filtration, thus posing complicated purification issues.   Patent Document 1 uses a known compound l,2-diethoxy-3-fluorobenzene as the raw material for producing a fluorinated cyclic benzamidine derivative (A), but its low overall yield was a problem.<br>
Therefore, methods of producing the fluorinated cyclic benzamidine derivative (A), or a salt thereof, that give high overall yields, have easy reaction procedures, and are useful even in an industrial scale production were anticipated.<br>
Patent document laisctoses a method ot producing the morpholine-substituted phenacyl derivative (B) using 2-tert-butylphenyl as the raw material.    However, this method has problems such as: the necessity to include manipulations to secure safety since a mtro compound is used in the reaction procedure; the need to use expensive reagents such as 2-bromoethylether; and low overall yield.<br>
Therefore, economical and industrially advantageous methods for producing the morpholine-substituted phenacyl derivative (B) or a salt thereof, which have simple reaction procedures and give high overall yields were required.<br>
Furthermore, the reaction of coupling the fluorinated cyclic benzamidine derivative (A) or a salt thereof with the morpholine-substituted phenacyl derivative (B) to obtain the cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) or a salt thereof also had complicated purification procedure issues.<br>
Therefore, there was a need for overall industrially advantageous methods for producing the cyclic benzamidine derivative (C), or a salt thereof, including methods of synthesizing raw materials such as the aforementioned compound (A) and compound (B).<br>

These compounds may serve as intermediates in generating the morpholine-substituted phenacyl derivative (B).<br><cvclic benzamidine derivative><br>
In the present invention, the method for producing the cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) represented by formula (XIII) (may also be referred to as compound (XIII))<br><br><br>
(wherein, Hal" represents a halogen atom), using a hydrocarbon or ether as the solvent.<br>
Generally, the reaction can be carried out by simply mixing these compounds (A) and (B) and stirring in a solvent.    Furthermore, post-reaction treatments and procedures of isolation and purification may also be performed to isolate and purify the desired cyclic benzamidme derivative (C) as a &amp;ee benzamidme or a salt thereof.<br>
Examples of ethers that are used as the solvent include THF.<br>
Examples of hydrocarbons that are used as the solvent include n-hexane, K-heptane, benzene, toluene, and xylene, and among them, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as n-hexane and rt-heptane are preferred.<br>
These solvents can be used individually or in combinations of two or more types of solvents.<br>
When the ether or hydrocarbon is used as a solvent in the reaction, the salt of cyclic<br><br>
benzamidine derivative (C) is precipitated from the reaction system as crystals. Therefore, the extreme simplicity involved in isolating and puriiying die cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) salt of interest is industrially advantageous.<br>
Among these solvents, an ether is preferable and THF is particularly preferable. When using an ether such as THF as the solvent, the ether may be used alone or mixed with a non-ether poor solvent.<br>
Examples of the poor solvent include hydrocarbons such as n-hexane, «-heptane, benzene, toluene, and xylene.    Among them, «-heptane may be preferably used.    Addition of such a poor solvent after completion of the reaction as an after-treatment increases the salt yield of the cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) (compound (XlII)).<br>
When using ether as the solvent with an additionally mixed poor solvent, the ether proportion in the solvent is preferably 50 weight % or more and less than 100 weight %.<br>
A poor solvent is added following the reaction with ether, and when the ether proportion in the solvent falls within the above range, precipitation of crystals can be performed with increased efficiency.<br>
The reaction temperature is preferably 0°C to room temperature or so, and the reaction tune is preferably 10 minutes to 50 hours or so.<br>
The fluorinated cyclic benzamidine derivative (A) and the morpholme-substituted phenacyl derivative (B), which are the raw materials for the cyclic benzamidine derivative (C), can be prodixed by known methods or by the production methods of the present mvention. Preferably, they are produced by the above-mentioned methods of the present invention for producing the fluorinated cyclic benzamidine derivative (A) and/or by those used for producing the morpholine-substituted phenacyl derivative (B).    It is desirable from the perspective of increasing overall yields to react the fluorinated cyclic benzamidme derivative (A) with the morpholine-substituted phenacyl derivative (B).    The phrase "(A) and/or (B)" means at least either (A) or (B) is included.<br>
The methods of the present invention for producing the cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) or a salt thereof may comprise a recrystallization step.    More specifically, the cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) or a salt thereof obtained by the aforementioned methods can be further purified by recrystallization.<br>
The recrystallization method involves adding crude crystals of the cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) or a salt thereof mto a mixed solvent containing water and alcohol such as methanol or ethanol m a discretionary ratio, or a mixed solvent containing water and ether such as THF in a discretionary ratio, and dissolving the crude crystals at low temperatures.    For example, after dissolution, additional water can be added to precipitate the crystals.    A mixed solvent comprising alcohol and water is preferable.    For the alcohol, ethanol is preferred.<br><br>
For the dissolution above, the volume ratio of water to ether or water to alcohol in the mix is preferably 0:100 to 80:20, and more preferably in the range between 10:90 and 30:70.<br>
The temperature at which crude crystals precipitate is preferably 50°C or lower, and more preferably 45°C or lower.    The cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) and a salt thereof are unstable to heat, and when they are placed under high temperatures for a long period of time, their quality may decrease due to degradation, generation of by-products, and such.    For example, when a mixed solvent comprising water and ethanol is used, the cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) or a salt thereof can be easily dissolved at low temperatures, and thus, their quality is not decreased by the heatmg needed for dissolution.    Furthermore, since ethanol is used, this method is very safe from operational and pharmaceutical aspects.    In addition, it is industrially advantageous since crystals are precipitated simply by adding water.<br>
The cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) or a salt thereof obtained by such methods of the present invention have excellent thrombin receptor inhibhory activity, and are useful as thrombin receptor antagonists.<br>
