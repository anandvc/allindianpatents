MULTI-SPEED TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/866,702, filed on November 21, 2006. The disclosure of the above application is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	The invention relates to a multi-speed transmission having both a plurality<br>
of planetary gear sets and torque transmitting devices that are selectively engagcable to<br>
achieve multiple gear ratios.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]	A typical multi-speed transmission uses a combination of friction clutches<br>
and planetary gear arrangements to achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and<br>
placement of the planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging, cost and<br>
desired speed ratios.<br>
[0004]	While conventional transmissions achieve their intended purpose, the need<br>
for new and improved transmission configurations continues with the design of lighter<br>
and more compact vehicles. Accordingly, there is a need for a cost-effective, compact<br>
and multi-speed transmission.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005]	A transmission is provided having an input member, an output member,<br>
first, second and third planetary gear sets, a first interconnecting member, a second<br>
interconnecting member and six torque-transmitting mechanisms. The torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms are selectively engageable in combinations of at least three to<br>
establish at least eight forward speed ratios and at least one reverse speed ratio between<br>
1<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000057-PTT-DLT<br>
the input member and the output member. The planetary gear sets each have first, second<br>
and third members. The first interconnecting member continuously interconnects the first<br>
member of the first planetary gear set with a stationary element. The second<br>
interconnecting member continuously interconnects the third member of the second<br>
planetary gear set with the third member of the third planetary gear set. The six torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms are selectively engageable to interconnect one of the first,<br>
second, and third members with another of the first, second, and third members.<br>

transmitting mechanisms is selectively engageable to interconnect the second member of<br>
the first planetary gear set with the first member of the third planetary gear set.<br>

transmitting mechanisms is selectively engageable to interconnect the second member of<br>
the first planetary gear set with the second member of the second planetary gear set.<br>

continuously interconnected with the first member of the second planetary gear set and<br>
2<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000057-PTT-DLT<br>
the output member is continuously interconnected with the second member of the third<br>
planetary gear set.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0022]	The  following description  is merely exemplary  in nature and  is  not<br>
intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0023]	Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of an eight speed transmission 10<br>
is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a schematic representation of<br>
the components of a mechanical device such as an automatic transmission. Each<br>
individual lever represents a planetary gear set wherein the three basic mechanical<br>
components of the planetary gear are each represented by a node. Therefore, a single<br>
lever contains three nodes: one for the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one<br>
for the ring gear. The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to<br>
represent the ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever ratios, in turn, are<br>
used to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve an appropriate ratios<br>
4<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000057-PTT-DLT<br>
and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the nodes of<br>
the various planetary gear sets are illustrated by thin, horizontal lines and torque<br>
transmitting devices such as clutches and brakes are presented as interleaved fingers.<br>
Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams can be found in<br>

brake 80 to establish the various forward and reverse gear speeds is the same throughout<br>
the various embodiments. Transmissions 10 and 100 are capable of transmitting torque<br>
from the input shaft or member 12 to the output shaft or member 14 in at least eight<br>
forward torque ratios and two reverse torque ratios as indicated in the truth table of FIG.<br>
5. Each of the forward torque ratios and the reverse torque ratios is attained by<br>
engagement of one or more of the torque-transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first clutch 70, a<br>
second clutch 72, a third clutch 74, a fourth clutch 76, a fifth clutch 78 and a brake 80).<br>
[0041]	To establish the reverse torque ratio (Rev  1), the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms or clutches are selected as set forth in the table of FIG. 5. As shown in FIG.<br>
5, brake 80, fourth clutch 76 and first clutch 70 are engaged to achieve the reverse torque<br>
ratio (Rev 1). The brake 80 connects the carrier member 56 with the transmission<br>
housing 36 in transmission 10 and 100. The fourth clutch 76 connects ring gear member<br>
24 to sun gear member 52 in transmission 10. However, in transmission 100 the fourth<br>
clutch 76 connects carrier member 106 to sun gear member 52. The first clutch 70 of<br>
transmission 10 connects carrier member 28 to sun gear member 42 and input shaft or<br>
member 12. However, the first clutch 70 of transmission 100 connects second ring gear<br>
member 104 to sun gear member 42 and input shaft or member 12. Likewise, the eight<br>
forward ratios and second reverse ratio are achieved through different combinations of<br>
clutch and brake engagement, as shown in FIG. 5.<br>

Attorney Docket No. P000057-PTT-DLT<br>
[0042]	It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation and gear<br>
states of transmissions 10 and 100 assumes, first of all, that all the clutches and brake not<br>
specifically referenced in a given gear state are inactive or disengaged and, second of all,<br>
that during gear shifts, i.e., changes of gear state, between at least adjacent gear states, a<br>
clutch or brake engaged or activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
Those skilled in the art will readily understand that a different speed ratio is associated<br>
with each torque ratio. An example of the gear ratios that may be obtained using the<br>
embodiments of the present invention are also shown in FIG. 5. Of course, other gear<br>
ratios are achievable depending on the gear diameter, gear teeth count and gear<br>
configuration selected.<br>
[0043]	The present invention contemplates that downshifts follow essentially the<br>
reverse sequence of the corresponding upshift (as described above), and several power-on<br>
skip-shifts are possible (e.g. from 1st to 3rd).<br>
[0044]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br>
