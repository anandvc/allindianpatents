				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an improved method of thermal spraying of boilers. The<br>
invention further relates to a coating composition for carrying-out the improved<br>
method of thermal spraying of boilers. The invention also relates to a device for<br>
implementing the improved method of thermal spraying of boilers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Erosion-resistant coatings are frequently used on fossil boiler components such<br>
as burner panels, wall blower areas, steam cooled walls, economizer tubes and<br>
bends, inlet header of low temperature superheater (LTSH) etc, including various<br>
other components of the system that are prone to erosion due to flying ash.<br>
Erosion of these components generally occurs by impingement of fly ash having<br>
highly erosive constituents. Existing base materials for fossil boiler components<br>
such as carbon and low alloy steels do not have adequate erosion resistance<br>
under these conditions. For example, coal fired boiler components such as<br>
economizers, LTSH when exposed to fly ash have been found to undergo<br>
significant erosion due to the Indian coal containing as high as 45% ash. This<br>
problem is severe in India, where boilers are heavily depended on coal or lignite<br>
as the fuel. The severe erosion that damages the boiler components causing<br>
frequent maintenance related shutdowns, loss of generation and the need to<br>
replace various components on a regular basis.<br>
Erosive high temperature wear in boilers is one of the main causes of downtime<br>
and one of the principle engineering problems in these installations. As a result<br>
of the combustion process, the oxide particles produced have much higher<br>
melting point than the boiler operating temperature. Thus, these particles remain<br><br>
intact and then get entrained into the exhaust gas resulting in a constant<br>
bombardment of particulate matter. Maintenance costs for replacing worn tubes<br>
are very high and the downtime associated with unscheduled breakdowns<br>
caused by the failure of exchange tubes is a source of lost revenue. The<br>
environment is also very erosive due to a number of sources.<br>
While it is possible to provide additional protection shields by way of covering to<br>
the erosion prone areas, the shields can not be used at the areas where higher<br>
flue gas temperature exists for example, wall blower, burner panel etc because<br>
they get warped or even burnt. At low temperature areas, if installation of the<br>
shields is not proper, these shields get displaced exposing the surface for erosion<br>
and sometimes even shift the erosion location.<br>
In order to avoid erosion problems in power stations during the shut down,<br>
generally, the tubes are either replaced, or an weld overlay of carbon steel by<br>
SMAW technique is attempted which is quite cumbersome process in practice as<br>
it takes more time and more labour and even the tube might get damaged.<br>
Further these weld overlay or replacement of tubular panels is not totally<br>
effective during prolonged exposure to erosion.<br>
Current erosion resistant coatings are usually applied by thermal spray<br>
techniques, such as high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) and weld overlay by SMAW of<br>
carbon steel for various boiler components.<br>
Of all the different prior art deposition processes, HVOF yield the most dense<br>
erosion resistant coatings and as such, is generally preferred for forming erosion<br>
resistant coatings. Even though the HVOF yields coatings with high residual<br><br>
stress, it however, limits the coating thickness to about 300 microns in thickness.<br>
Further, because of the gas constituents used in the HVOF process, and the<br>
resulting particle temperature and velocity, the so-formed coatings generally<br>
contain some degree of decarburization, which significantly reduces the coating<br>
erosion resistance. Further, there is a need for large amounts of LPG gas and<br>
oxygen for carrying out the coating and making them available at site is a major<br>
problem besides safety issues. The time taken for the coating is also very high.<br>
Japanese patent JP2185961 discloses a method to improve the corrosion and<br>
erosion resistances of a steel tube for a boiler coated with a self-fluxing alloy<br>
such as MSF Ni 1-45 or MSF Co 1 standardized by JIS by previously forming an Al<br>
coated layer on the steel tube. The outer surface of a steel tube is coated with Al<br>
and a self-fluxing alloy contg. Ni-Cr-B-Si-C-Fe-Co, Ni-Cr-B-Si-C-Fe-Co-Cu, Ni-Cr-<br>
B-Si-C-Fe- Co-Mo-Cu or Ni-Cr-B-Si-C-Fe-Co-Mo-W is flame sprayed and fused on<br>
the resulting Al coated layer to obtain a steel tube for a boiler.<br>
Japanese patent JP10030897 describes an overlay welding process which<br>
overlays the Ni alloy in a desired area in the longitudinal direction with a<br>
specified thickness and a bending process which bends the steel tubes in U<br>
shape. The composition of the Ni alloy includes 15 to 20wt.% of Cr, 9 to 15wt.%<br>
of Mo and the rest of Ni. The high temperature steel tube includes the<br>
serpentine-formed steel tube having the coating layer in an area in contact with<br>
a high temperature gas out of straight running parts and or curved parts of the<br>
high temperature steel tube.<br><br>
Chinese patent CN1858293 relates to surface processing material technology, in<br>
particular, a nano grade modified wear resistant and erosion resistant arc<br>
sprayed wire material. The wire material has coating of Fe or Ni, and powdered<br>
core comprising high carbon ferrochrome 45-60 wt%, Ni 10-20 wt%, ferrosilicon<br>
4-10 wt%, ferroboron 5010 wt%, Cr3C2, TiB2 or TiC 10-15 wt%, micron level<br>
TiB2 5-15 wt%, nanometer level AI2O3 5-15 wt%, and optional wollastonite 1-3<br>
wt%, ZrO2 2-5 wt% and TiO2 5-15 wt%. The material is used mainly for coating<br>
the surface of blower blade, tube wall in power station boiler etc. and the coated<br>
layer can increase the surface life of the said parts.<br>
Chinese patent CN1814852 discloses an invention related to surface engineering<br>
field used in the protection of power station boiler pipelines including welding a<br>
layer of hardness alloy on a cleaned metal matrix with self protection metal core<br>
wire, in which, the weld current is 180-220A, voltage is 18-22V, the welded<br>
metal matrix is sprayed with sand to eliminate the oxidized skins, rust and the<br>
old coating and expose the metallic brightness then a compound layer of anti-<br>
erosion and anti-abrasion is sprayed on the matrix by an arc spraying method.<br>
Canadian patent CA1067354 discloses a method of boiler tube coating wherein<br>
steel tubes or pipes, for example, steel boiler tubes and/or integrated panels of<br>
steel boiler tubes, are provided with a fused overlay of a corrosion and erosion<br>
resistant coating comprised of a refractory hard component, e.g. tungsten<br>
carbide, dispersed through a corrosion resistant matrix alloy.<br><br>
US patent 7,141,110 discloses an improved erosion resistant coatings for hydro<br>
electric turbine component. The erosion resistant coating composition includes<br>
nanostructured grains of tungsten carbide (WC) and/or submicron sized grains of<br>
WC embedded into a cobalt chromium (CoCr) binder matrix. A high velocity air<br>
fuel thermal spray process (HVAF) is used to create thick coatings in excess of<br>
about 500 microns with high percentages of primary carbide for longer life better<br>
erosion resistant coatings. These materials and processes are especially suited<br>
for hydroelectric turbine components.<br>
US patent US7066242 discloses a method of prevention of erosion of boiler<br>
tubes. The refractory shield assembly comprises: a semi-circular, elongate, metal<br>
shield; a plurality of spaced apart anchors protruding from the front surface of<br>
the shield; a layer of abrasion-resistant refractory material overlying the surface<br>
and extending between and engaging the anchors, whereby the refractory<br>
material is held on the shield by the anchors; and means, such as clamps, for<br>
securing the shield on a boiler tube. The refractory shield assembly functions to<br>
protect the underlying boiler tube from erosion by a stream of hot combustion<br>
gas containing particulates.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for quicker and improved coating<br>
methods and coating compositions that provide effective protection against<br>
erosion resistance, such as is required for boiler components such as burner<br>
panels, steam cooled walls, etc. Improved coating methods and/or coating<br>
compositions on regions of boiler components desirably need coatings with a<br>
combination of high erosion resistance, low residual stresses, and higher<br>
thickness to provide a coating with long life and high erosion resistance under<br>
Indian operating conditions having coal with high ash content.<br><br>

coatings. Accordingly, there is provided a process for twin wire arc spraying with<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1- Schematically shows a prior art process of providing a protective plate<br>
over the tube for erosion protection including wire arc coating.<br>
Figure 2- shows an embodiment of the device for implementing an improved<br>
method of thermal spraying of boilers according to the invention.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
Thermal spray coatings is an alternate approach to the wire arc coating that<br>
offers advantages because they allow in situ recoating of the boiler tubes with<br>
the additional ability to repair localized defects inside the boiler. The ability to<br>
recoat boilers during a scheduled outage is especially attractive because<br>
downtime can be minimized, which translates into significant operational cost<br>
savings.<br>
Wire arc spraying is a thermal spraying method which utilizes the heat from an<br>
electric arc to melt various metallic materials. In this method, two consumable<br>
wire electrodes (5) are fed automatically to the arc zone. The initiated arc<br>
between the wire electrodes (5) melts the wire tips. The fused metal is atomized<br>
by compressed air using an air nozzle (7), and thrown with high velocity onto a<br>
substrate (6), forming the coating (Fig. 2). Normally, a dc constant potential<br>
power source (9) is used to provide a voltage between 18 and 40V depending on<br>
the spray material. The voltage should be kept at the lowest level with regard to<br>
arc stability in order to produce smooth and dense coatings.<br>
Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate<br>
identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, protective shields<br>
over the tube. The erosion resistance coating on a boiler panel is shown in FIG. 2<br>
is to be made with the least possible outlay by the process according to the<br>
invention. As per figure 2, the coating is completely made by making use of only<br>
twin wire arc thermal spray process using the nano grade wire of following<br>
chemistry.<br><br>
Wire Material Chemistry<br>
Chromium 
Molybdenum 
The development of nanoscale coatings can be achieved via processing through<br>
a solid/solid-state transformation, which can occur during wire arc spraying. This<br>
route to nanoscale coatings is enabled by developing alloys that readily form<br>
metallic glass structures at cooling rates in the range of thermal spray processes<br>
(i.e., 104 to 105 K/s) (Ref 1,2). During the devitrification step, the glass recursor,<br>
when heated to its crystallization temperature, readily transforms into a<br>
nanoscale composite structure. This refinement is due to the uniform nucleation<br>
and extremely high nucleation frequency during crystallization, resulting in little<br>
time for grain growth before impingement between neighboring grains. By this<br>
route, it is possible to develop very stable nanostructures that resist coarsening<br>
at elevated temperatures. The erosion resistant coating composition includes<br>
amorphous matrix structure containing starburst shaped boride ((FeCrMoW)2B)<br>
and carbide (FeCrMoW)23C6) crystallites with sizes ranging from 60 to 140 nm.<br>
The chief advantage of this approach, in contrast to other approaches outlined<br>
previously, is that the feedstock material cored wire for wire-arc spraying is<br>
physically identical to conventional feedstock, which eliminates the spraying<br>
problems normally associated with nanosized particulate materials and also<br>
bypasses their high cost. The ability to develop nanoscale microstructures with<br>
enhanced properties using conventional technology is revolutionary.<br><br>
Conventional power source for wire arc spraying can be used and flux core wire<br>
of nano grade wire is used. All the coatings are developed and applied by wire<br>
arc spraying. According to this embodiment, the wire arc spraying of nanograde<br>
wire is carried out as per the enclosed parameters in Table 1. In the laboratory<br>
test of the above wire arc sprayed tube exhibited the required hardness, reduced<br>
porosity and oxide inclusions and finally thermal spraying is being performed in<br>
the actual power plant site. The microstructure is composed of three phases,<br>
consisting of Fe, a carbide phase, tentatively identified as the (Fe-Cr-W-Mo)23C6<br>
type phase, and a boride phase, tentatively identified as the (Fe-Cr-Mo-W)3B<br>
type phase. The microstructure is found to consist of ≈ 2/3 volume fraction of<br>
nanoscale complex carbide and complex boride phases intermixed with the Fe<br>
phase.<br>
Table -1 Typical Wire arc Spraying parameters<br><br>
During spraying, the visual examination reveals that there is no spalling, and<br>
bend testing of the coating in a 1.25 mm carbon steel sheet reveals that there is<br>
no cracking or spalling.<br><br>
The compelling properties observed result from the ability to develop nanoscale<br>
composite microstructures in air using conventional wire-arc spray guns. The<br>
ability to spray the above wire-arch coatings in the field has been demonstrated,<br>
because the coating is found to be easy to apply with a wide processing window<br>
and very good spray forgiveness, and, once coated, is easily recoated and<br>
repaired. While there are many different types of coating materials with different<br>
combinations of properties, all coatings can only provide protection to a<br>
component as long as they remain bonded to the component.<br>
The advantages of the invention can be seen, inter alia, in the fact that the wire<br>
arc spraying can be done by making use of simple wire arc spraying equipment<br>
without costly consumables required for HVOF process. Further, the old method<br>
of HVOF or protective shields on the erosion prone area requires lot of lead time<br>
in providing the protection and also costly. Moreover, this method will not be<br>
suitable for providing life of more than 2 years.<br><br>
