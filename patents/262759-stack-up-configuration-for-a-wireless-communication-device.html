STACK-UP CONFIGURATION FOR A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION DEVICE<br>
RELATED APPLICATION<br>
The present application relates to co-pending United States Application No.<br>
11/014,541 entitled STACK-UP CONFIGURATION FOR A WIRELESS<br>
COMMUNICATION DEVICE, of concurrent ownership, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to a component configuration in a wireless<br>
communication device, and more specifically to a component stack-up configuration of a<br>
wireless communication device to reduce a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) level.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
As the wireless communication industry continues to grow, the demand increases<br>
for smaller and smaller wireless communication devices. A wireless communication<br>
device also may be referred to herein as a "wireless device," a "handset," a "cellular<br>
phone", a "mobile phone", etc. Decreasing the size of a wireless device presents design<br>
challenges including the challenge of placing device components within a smaller<br>
volume. Additional challenges include maintaining acceptable levels of radio frequency<br>
(RF) energy radiated from the wireless device in a concerned near-field range while<br>
maintaining radiated efficiency of the device.<br>
When the RF module is transmitting, a power amplifier magnifies an electronic<br>
signal and then broadcasts this modulated energy into the air through the antenna. A first<br>
portion of this energy travels through free space to the target destination. Another portion<br>
of this energy is dissipated as heat within the device. Finally, some of the energy is<br>
absorbed by objects near the device, including the user's body.<br>
The power density surrounding an antenna of a wireless device varies as a<br>
function of, for example, distance from the antenna and orientation of the antenna. The<br>
fields around an antenna typically are divided into two regions. A first region is one near<br>
the antenna called the near field, and a second region is one at a large distance from the<br>
antenna called the far field. The boundary between the two is often taken to be at the<br><br>
WO 2006/065934	PCT/US2005/045309<br>
2<br>
radius, R, where R = 2L2/Î», where L is the maximum dimension of the antenna and A is<br>
the wavelength. The far field is the region where the radiation pattern is independent of<br>
distance from, e.g., a transmitting antenna. The near field is the region that is closest to<br>
the transmitting antenna and in which the field pattern depends on the distance from the<br>
antenna.<br>
Limits for safe human exposure to radio frequency (RF) energy radiated from a<br>
wireless device in the near field are given in terms of a unit referred to as the Specific<br>
Absorption Rate (SAR). Specific Absorption Rate is an amount of radio frequency energy<br>
absorbed by the body when using a radio transmitter. The acceptable SAR level varies<br>
from country to country. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) limits the<br>
amount of acceptable exposure to RF energy from a mobile phone to a specific local (or<br>
spatial peak) SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram of tissue (1.6 W/kg). When the wireless<br>
device is operating within these limits, the device poses no hazards to users. Thus,<br>
compliance with applicable near-field exposure limits must be considered in any mobile<br>
phone design.<br>
The SAR levels of various phones vary due in part to the fact that SAR is a<br>
function of many different parameters, including device geometry, transmission<br>
frequency, amplifier power level, antenna location, etc. A typical stack-up configuration<br>
of a prior art cellular phone 70 is shown in Figure 4. The phone 70 is encased in a<br>
housing 88 having a front face 84 and a back face 86. Components of the phone 70<br>
include a circuit board 74 that holds processing circuitry (not shown) for controlling a<br>
display 72, a key pad 80, RF and other noisy, i.e., radiating, components 90 enclosed by<br>
canister-type shielding 76, and other device components (not shown). An antenna 82 is<br>
coupled through a feed point 92 to a transmitter and receiver on the circuit board 74. A<br>
battery 78 also is encased within the housing 88 for powering the components of the<br>
device 70.<br>
Continuing with Figure 4, the prior art stack-up configuration for the phone 70 is a<br>
display 72 on the front face 84 of the housing 88, which is stacked above the circuit board<br>
74, which may have one or more canister-type shields 76 above and below the circuit<br>
board for shielding noisy components. The battery 78 is stacked below the circuit board,<br>
and typically is accessible through a battery door 94 on the back surface 86 of the<br><br>
WO 2006/065934	PCT/US2005/045309<br>
3<br>
housing 88. In addition to the canister-type shields 76 covering the noisy components<br>
residing on the circuit board, the phone 70 of the prior art requires additional shielding<br>
(not shown), referred to herein as compliance shielding, to bring the phone 70 into SAR<br>
compliance since high energy density appears immediately above the front face 84. This<br>
additional shielding may include foil, RF absorbing material, metalized plastic, and metal<br>
brackets, etc.<br>
The shielding within the phone 70 that is used to comply with acceptable SAR<br>
levels continues to present a significant burden in the manufacture of the phone in terms<br>
of actual design efforts, iteration of compliance testing, and costs for the additional<br>
compliance shielding. The above described challenges are amplified as phone sizes<br>
decrease. Thus, it is desirable to continue innovations in the industry that lower the SAR<br>
level of the phone before the addition of the compliance shielding, and that reduce final<br>
costs of the phone in design and material costs.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
A wireless communication device includes a housing with a back face and a front<br>
face for holding a display and keypad. A battery for providing power to the components<br>
of the wireless communication device sits within the housing and at least partially<br>
between the display and a front surface of a circuit board. The circuit board holds<br>
processing and RF circuitry for the wireless communication device. The back surface of<br>
the circuit board holds radiating circuit components which are shielded by canister-type<br>
shielding. An external or internal antenna is connected to the circuit board at a feed<br>
point. The antenna in one embodiment of the invention is stacked below the circuit<br>
board, that is, between the back face of the housing and the back surface of the circuit<br>
board.<br>
The placement of the battery in a space between the display and the circuit board<br>
decreases the Specific Absorption Rate measured at a set distance above the front face<br>
of the housing as compared to a traditional device stack up configuration in which the<br>
battery is placed below the circuit board and is accessible from a back face of the<br>
housing. The decrease in the SAR level decreases the amount of additional compliance<br>
shielding required to comply with acceptable SAR levels. This particularly advantageous<br>
as the size of wireless devices continue to decrease.<br><br>
WO 2006/065934	PCT/US2005/045309<br>
4<br>
The stack up configuration of the battery and display above the circuit board also<br>
can provide a cavity having an increased volume for holding a speaker. The volume of<br>
the cavity is determined by the combined heights of the battery and the display, the width<br>
of the circuit board or housing, and the difference in the length of the circuit board and the<br>
battery. The increased cavity volume can improve the quality of sounds from the speaker<br>
of the wireless communication device.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
As the wireless industry expands, cell phone manufactures are developing<br>
innovative wireless devices that are smaller and smaller in size. The decreasing size of<br>
phones exposes more radio frequency (RF) energy to the user's head, measured by a<br>
Specifc Absorption Rate (SAR) level, in the near field and radiates less RF energy in the<br>
far field. Thus, to reduce the human exposure and improve the radiated efficiency while<br>
maintaining a small-sized phone is very challenging. The present invention addresses<br>
this challenge by presenting an innovational stack-up configuration of the components<br>
within the phone.<br>
As discussed above, the prior art phones as illustrated in Figure 4 have a<br>
traditional mechanical stack-up from a top surface of a phone to a back surface. The<br>
traditional stack-up is a display, e.g., liquid crystal display (LCD), on the top surface,<br>
followed by a main board, shielding and a battery. Typically, the antenna feed point is on<br>
the main board. In contrast, the stack-up configuration of one embodiment is illustrated in<br>
Figure 1. A wireless device 2 is enclosed in a housing 4 having a front face 6 and a back<br>
face 8. The top surface 6 of the wireless device 2 holds the display 10 and keypad 22. A<br>
battery 12 is housed behind the display and above a circuit board 16. The circuit board<br>
16 holds the majority of the electronic circuitry for the wireless device 2 including noisy<br>
components 24, that is, components that radiate RF energy. The radiating components<br>
24 are shielding by shielding materials 14 such as canisters, RF absorbing material,<br>
metalized plastic covers, etc. In the illustrated embodiment of Figure 1, the antenna 18<br>
is an external antenna 18 having an antenna feed point 20 on the back surface 26 of the<br>
circuit board 16. RF energy of a modulated RF signal radiates from the antenna 18<br>
creating the near fields and the far fields.<br>
The mechanical stack up configuration of Figure 1 decreases the amount of<br>
energy radiated in the concerned near field as compared to the prior art stack-up<br>
configuration of Figure 4. Specifically, the placement of the battery 12 between the<br>
display 10 and the circuit board 16 contributes to the decrease in the radiated energy in<br>
the concerned near field area. As discussed below, simulation for energy density<br>
distribution in free space is performed at a plane 28 adjacent the front face 6 of the<br><br>
WO 2006/065934	PCT/US2005/045309<br>
6<br>
device 2. The plane 28, which is 0.5mm above the front face, also approximates the<br>
placement of the user's head when using the device 2.<br>
Figure 5 is a graph of the free space energy density (J/m3) distributed on a plane<br>
28 in Figure 4 for a traditional stack-up, as shown by curve 90, and distributed on a plane<br>
28 in Figure 1 for an embodiment of the present invention stack-up, as shown by curve<br>
92. Both simulations are done without including the compliance shielding as discussed<br>
above. The plane 28 is 0.5mm above the front face. The sample simulation results taken<br>
on a plane 28 as shown in Figures 1 and 4 are shown for illustrative purposes only.<br>
Other simulations may result in varying values for the energy density, and the illustrated<br>
example should not be considered as limiting for the embodiments of the present<br>
invention. The graph shows, for the concerned area, that the maximum energy density<br>
above the tradition stack-up of Figure 4 is approximately 3.8 times the energy density<br>
above the innovations stack-up configuration of Figure 1.<br>
In one sample SAR performance simulation of the prior art stack-up configuration<br>
of Figure 4, with a phone thickness from the front face 84 to the back face 86 of 22 mm,<br>
the average SAR based on IEEE standard 1529 is 2.10 W/kg at 24 dBm. This simulation<br>
result is taken without the compliance shielding as discussed above. Thus, for this<br>
particular sample prior art phone to attain the required SAR standard of 1.6 W/kg, the<br>
device housing would have to include additional compliance shielding. In comparison, the<br>
innovational stack-up of Figure 1, with a same thickness of 22 mm, has an averaged SAR<br>
based on IEEE-1529 of 1.58 W/kg at 24 dBm. For this simulation analysis, the SAR<br>
value is reduced for the stack-up configuration of the present invention by approximately<br>
24.8%. Thus, the amount of compliance shielding required to bring the sample present<br>
invention phone into compliance with the SAR standard is reduced. This reduction<br>
represents cost savings in design time, manufacture time and materials.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 are provided to illustrate a SAR performance as described above,<br>
and are based on the sample simulations. Figure 6 illustrates a user's head 102 with a<br>
prior art phone 104 against his or her head 102. Specific Absorption Rate power density<br>
"bands" A, B, C, D in W/kg decrease with distance from the source 104. Band A<br>
represents the area on the user's head absorbing the highest power density. In<br>
comparison, the SAR power densities of an embodiment of the present invention are<br><br>
WO 2006/065934	PCT/US2005/045309<br>
7<br>
reduced as shown in Figure 7. As shown with reference to bands A', B', C, D', the area<br>
of the user's head 102 absorbing the highest power density is significantly smaller than<br>
that of the prior art.<br>
A simulated radiated performance in free space, in a far field, for a sample<br>
traditional stack-up has radiation efficiency of 92.84% with a directivity of 2.73 dBi, and a<br>
gain of 2.41 dBi. In comparison, the stack-up configuration of a sample embodiment of<br>
the present invention yields a radiation efficiency of 92.86% with a directivity of 2.75 dBi,<br>
and a gain of 2.43 dBi. Thus, both the traditional stack-up and the innovated stack-up<br>
have the same radiated performance in free space. However, in a far field, for a prior art<br>
sample next to the head, the simulation results show a radiated efficiency of 22.77% with<br>
a directivity of 5.98 dBi, and a gain of -0.45 dBi. In comparison, the stack-up<br>
configuration of a sample embodiment of the present invention yields a radiation<br>
efficiency of 32.72% with a directivity of 5.89 dBi, and a gain of 1.04 dBi. Therefore, the<br>
innovational stack-up configuration has a better antenna efficiency of approximately 10%<br>
in a far field as compared to the traditional stack-up while the sample is held next to a<br>
human head.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates an end view of the device 30 of another embodiment of the<br>
invention. The stack up configuration along a height axis, H, is the circuit board 36<br>
above the shielding 38 and external antenna 40, the battery 34 above the circuit board<br>
36, and the display 32 above the battery 34. As shown, the device 30 does not require a<br>
particular placement of the components with respect to a length axis L and width axis W<br>
of the device 30 to obtain a reduction in the SAR. In one embodiment of the device 30 of<br>
Figure 2, the battery 34 is accessible through a battery door 44 in the housing 42.<br>
Figure 3 is a perspective view of another embodiment of the wireless device stack-<br>
up configuration 50 having an internal antenna 66 connected to the circuit board 54 by a<br>
feed point 68. The battery 58 is stacked below the display 52 and keypad (not shown),<br>
and above the circuit board 54. Radiators and other components such as memory on the<br>
bottom surface of the circuit board 54 are shielded by shields 56. In this embodiment, the<br>
speaker 60 is placed in the volume 64 left open from the stack-up of the battery 58 and<br>
the display 52. This volume 64 improves the sound quality of the speaker 60. Also<br>
shown in this space 64 is the microphone 62.<br><br>

Figure 8 is a block diagram 110 of the components of an embodiment of the<br>
present invention showing a relative position with respect to a housing front and back<br>
surfaces. The display 124 and keypad 126 on a front face of the device 110 are<br>
controlled by device circuitry on the circuit board 120. A speaker 128 and microphone<br>
130 send and receive audio signals to the device circuitry 120. The power supply 122,<br>
e.g., a battery, supplies the components of the device 110 with power through the circuit<br>
board 120. An antenna 116 is connected by a feed point 118 to the circuit board 120.<br>
Shielding 132 cover at least some of the circuitry on the circuit board 120.<br>
Figure 9 is a block diagram illustrating a wireless communication device 150 that<br>
may be used in connection with the various embodiments described herein. However,<br>
other wireless communication devices and/or architectures may also be used, as will be<br>
clear to those skilled in the art. In the illustrated embodiment, wireless communication<br>
device 150 comprises an antenna 152, a multiplexor 154, a low noise amplifier ("LNA")<br>
156, a power amplifier ("PA") 158, a modulation circuit 160, a baseband processor 162, a<br>
speaker 164, a microphone 166, a central processing unit ("CPU") 168, a data storage<br>
area 170, and a user interface 172. In the wireless device 150, radio frequency ("RF")<br>
signals are transmitted and received by antenna 152. Multiplexor 154 acts as a switch,<br>
coupling antenna 152 between the transmit and receive signal paths. In the receive path,<br>
received RF signals are coupled from a multiplexor 154 to LNA 156. LNA 156 amplifies<br>
the received RF signal and couples the amplified signal to a demodulation portion of the<br>
modulation circuit 160. The demodulator strips away the RF carrier signal leaving a<br>
base-band receive audio signal, which is sent from the demodulator output to the base-<br>
band processor 162. If the base-band receive audio signal contains audio information,<br>
then baseband processor 162 decodes the signal, converts it to an analog signal, and<br>
sends it to the speaker 164.<br>
The baseband processor 162 also receives analog audio signals from the<br>
microphone 166. These analog audio signals are converted to digital signals and<br>
encoded by the base-band processor 162. The base-band processor 162 also codes the<br>
digital signals for transmission and generates a base-band transmit audio signal that is<br>
routed to the modulator portion of modulation circuit 160. The modulator mixes the base-<br>
band transmit audio signal with an RF carrier signal generating an RF transmit signal that<br><br>
WO 2006/065934	PCT/US2005/045309<br>
9<br>
is routed to the power amplifier 158. The power amplifier 158 amplifies the RF transmit<br>
signal and routes it to the multiplexor 154 where the signal is switched to the antenna<br>
port for transmission by antenna 152. The baseband processor 162 is also<br>
communicatively coupled with the central processing unit 168 which has access to a data<br>
storage area 170. The central processing unit 168 is configured to execute instructions<br>
(i.e., computer programs or software) that can be stored in the data storage area 170.<br>
Computer programs can also be received from the baseband processor 162 and stored<br>
in the data storage area 170 or executed upon receipt.<br>
The description and drawings contained herein are particular embodiments of the<br>
invention and are representative of the subject matter broadly contemplated by the<br>
invention. However, the invention encompasses other embodiments that will be obvious<br>
to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is limited only by the<br>
