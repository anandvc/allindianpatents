				<td> The  present   invention   relates   to   a   process  for  the   degradation   of  technical<br>
hexachlorocyclohexane.<br>
This invention particularly relates to the development of bacterial inoculants<br>
for the elimination of tech-HCH from contaminated soil through biodegradation.<br>
Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH, has been one of the most extensively used<br>
broad spectrum organochlorine insecticides, which amounts to nearly 47% of total<br>
pesticides used in India (David, D.V. 1992, Pest Management and Pesticides:<br>
Indian Scenario, Namrata Publications, Madras, India). Commercial formulations<br>
of HCH contain a mixture of α-,ß-,γ- and δ- isomers at 65-70, 5-20, 10-15 and 3-4<br>
%  respectively,  among  which  the y-  isomer  is  the  only  active  insecticide<br>
(Bachmann.A, Walet.P, de Bruin. W, Huntgens. J.L, Roelofsen. W and Zender.<br>
A,J,B, Appl.Environ. Microbiol. 54:143-149). All the isomers persist for several<br>
years and cause environmental concern. The residues of technical grade HCH<br>
have been detected in soil, water and air (Deo.P.G, Karanth. N.G and Karanth.<br>
N.G.K,  Biodegradation  of hexachlorocyclohexane  isomers  in  soil  and food<br>
environments. Crit. Rev. Microbiol, 20:57-58). The residues of HCH have been<br>
found  in  adipose  tissue  and  also  in  breast  milk  (tanabe.S,   Gondaira.   F,<br>
Subramanian. A, Ramesh. A. Mohan. D, Kumaran, P, Venugopalan. V.K and<br>
Tatsukawa. R., 1990, J.Agric. Food Chem. 38:899-903). Almost all food stuffs<br>
including processed foods in India have been shown to contain high levels of HCH<br>
(Kannan. K, Tanabe. R., Ramesh. A,, Subramanian. A and Tatsukawa, R. 1992, J.<br>
Agric. Food Chem. 40: 518-524). These residues enter the human body through<br>
food chain from contaminated soil, animal feed, poultry feed, etc.<br><br>

In all these cases, accumulation of intermediary metabolites have been reported, implying incomplete degradation of HCH.<br>

Truffaut. N., Normand. P., Vogei. T. M. and Simonet. P. 1996. J. Bacteriol. 178: 6049- 6055, wherein, few bacterial strains such as Sphingomonas paucimobillis, Pseudomonas versicularis and Pseudomonas spp. could degrade different isomers of HCH under aerobic conditions.<br>
Reference may be made to Kunhi A. A. M. 1995. MICON Internationai-1994, wherein, mixed microbial culture/ microbial consortium isolated from HCH-contaminated soil was able to degrade HCH isomers in shake flasks.<br>
Reference may be made to an Indian patent 2448/DEL/95, wherein, a microbial consortium isolated from soil by enrichment technique could degrade HCH upto 100ppm after acclimation.<br>
Reference may be made to an Indian patent 2147/ DEL/ 98, wherein a microbial consortium was isolated from HCH- contaminated soil by long- term enrichment technique. This consortium when acclimated with y- HCH was able to degrade 100ppm of y- HCH in shake flasks.<br>
Reference may be made to an Indian patent (Submitted), wherein a microbial consortium, obtained by pooling a-, p-,y- and 5- HCH - degrading consortia was acclimated with technical grade HCH. The resultant consortium was able to degrade 25 ppm of tech.- HCH in soil.<br>
Drawback in all the above works is that the HCH- degraded by axenic cultures is very low and degradation time is long. Only single isomers have been used in many cases. In all these cases, the microorganisms are added as such and no inoculant formulations are available. Hence, it is imperative to develop an inoculant formulation capable of degrading tech- HCH in soil.<br><br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of inoculants formulation useful for the degradation of tech-hexachlorocyclohexane in soil<br>
Another object of the present invention is to prepare inoculant formulations for the treatment of soil for the elimination of tech- HCH residues.<br>

In another embodiment of the present invention, the medium used may be selected from 0.06-0.07% KH2PO4, 0.5-0.6% Na2HPO4&gt; 0.02-0.03% NH4NO3, 0.02-0.03% MgSO4 7H2O, 0.01-0.02% Ca(NO3)2, 0.45-055% cone. H2SO4 supplemented with 1 ml of mineral solution containing 0.1% FeSO4, 0.1% MnSO4 H20, 0.025% CuCI2.2H20, 0.025% Na2Mo04 2H20 and 0.01% H3BO3, with a final pH in the range of 7-8.<br>

The mixed microbial consortium (CFR 2003) was prepared by incorporating 10 bacterial strains (Table 1) and was mutated to degrade increasing concentrations of tech- HCH. This defined mixed culture could degrade 25 ng tech- HCH by 120 h in soil. The inoculant formulations were obtained by<br><br>
inoculating the mixed culture to sterile Sphagnum mass or wheat bran separately at 10 cells/ml based on plate count and incubating them at ambient temperature (25° to 28°C) for 30 days. The pellets of inoculant formulations were obtained by inoculating the mixed microbial culture to sterile Sphagnum mass or wheat bran (separately) and making them in to pellets of approximately 0.5g (dry weight) and air-drying them. These inoculant formulations could be effectively deployed for the treatment of tech-HCH in soil.<br>
A novel process was deployed for the elimination of tech-HCH from soil and contaminated material using inoculant formulations of mixed microbial culture. The microbial consortium was deployed by enrichment of mixture of HCH-contaminated soil (collected from sugarcane field) and sewage (collected from Mysore Municipal Corporation sewage plant in shake flasks containing individual isomers of HCH, the four different consortia were pooled and then inoculated to tech-HCH(5 ng/ml). Then the consortium that got established was resolved into individual members and identified as 7 Pseudomonas spp. one each of Burkholderia sp., Flavobacterium sp., and Vibrio sp.<br>

The mutants of the above cultures have been developed by subjecting them to increasing concentrations of tech-HCH used as a sole source of carbon and energy, by conventional technique.<br>
Technical grade HCH (tech- HCH) was obtained from Hindustan Insecticides, Mumbai, India. Other chemicals used in the media and reagents were of analytical grade and were obtained from standard Indian companies<br>
The basal mineral medium used for the enrichment and for growth of the individual cultures as well as the mixed cultures (consortium, CFR- 2003) contained (per litre of distilled water), 0.675g KH2PO4, 5,455 g Na2HPO4, 0.25 g NH4N03, 0.2 g MgS04. 7H2O, 0.1 g Ca(N03)2 and 1 ml of mineral solution (containing mg/ml) FeS04, 1.0, MnSO4. H2O 1.0, CuCI2.2H20, 0.25,Na2Mo042H2O, 0.25,, H3B03, 0.10 and cone. H2S04 5 ml. The pH of the medium was 7.5. Required quantity of HCH was added to the medium as described later.<br>
The inoculant formulation was prepared in Sphagnum mass and wheat bran. Around 200 gm quantity of powdered Sphagnum mass was dispensed into plastic bags after neutralizing the Sphagnum to pH 7.0 with CaC03. The neutralized Sphagnum was sterilized by autoclaving for 15 mins at 121°C, 15 Ibs pressure for three successive days. The neutralized Sphagnum was inoculated with 80ml of cell suspension containing 109" cells ml"1 based on plate count. Bags were incubated aseptically for 21- 30 days at ambient temperature (26- 28 °C).<br><br>
Packaged inocula were stored at 8 °C until further use. Same protocol was used to prepare inoculant formulations from wheat bran.<br>
To prepare inoculant pellets, thrice autoclaved Sphagnum mass/ wheat bran was mixed with bacterial suspension, palletized and air- dried. Air-dried pellets were packaged and stored at 8 °C until further use.<br>
Nutrient agar plates were used for resolving different bacterial strains from the consortium as well as to study their taxonomy. Nutrient agar contained 3g beef extract, 5g peptone, 5g NaCI and 20g agar-agar per liter of distilled water (pH 7.0).<br>
Individual isolates of the consortium were grown in 50 ml of wheat bran hydrolysate or glucose-yeast extract medium in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 0.5 % reducing sugars and incubating at 30 °C on a rotary shaker (150 rpm). After 72 h of growth, the cells were harvested, pooled at equal ODeoo, induced with tech- HCH for 24 h and used as inoculum after washing the harvested cells with 0.1% tween 80 and minimal medium. This induced consortium was used in the preparation of inoculant formulations.<br>
For the degradation of tech-HCH in soil, 80 g sterile soil was taken in plastic cup and spiked with known concentration of tech-HCH in acetone. Then the above developed consortium / inoculant formulation was inoculated at known colony forming units (cfus).<br>
The growth of the culture in shake flasks was determined by estimating protein of alkali -digested sample. In the inoculant formulation and in the soil<br><br>
sample growth was estimated by determining the colony forming units (cfus) on nutrient agar.<br>
Quantitative determination of the substrate residues (tech-HCH) was done by thin layer chromatography or gas chromatography, with 63Ni electron capture detector. The soil sample was extracted thrice with equal volumes of acetone : ethylacetate (1 : 1), acetone : ethyl acetate (5: 95), and ethyl acetate. The solvent layers were pooled, evaporated and the residue was redissolved in a convenient volume of acetone. Known volume of the acetone containing the residue was loaded on to a silica gel -G coated plate (0.3 mm) and developed in cyclohexane. The plates were air dried and HCH isomers were detected by spraying the plate with 2% solution of o-tolidine in acetone and exposing to sunlight. The spots were delineated by marking with a needle and the area was measured. The concentration was computed from a standard plot of log concentrations versus square root of the area, prepared for reference standard of tech-HCH. For gas chromatography, 63Ni electron capture detector was used. The conditions used were as follows: column 2mm ID and 200 cm length, packed with OV-17 and 1.95 QF-1 on 80 - 100 mesh chromosorb W, carrier gas nitrogen, flow at 30 ml / min, column temperature 210° C, injector temperature 230° C, detector 320° C.The solvent fraction was passed through florisil column to remove impurities.<br>
The enrichment of HCH-contaminated soil and sewage water with different isomers of HCH was done in 250 ml conical flasks in a shaker at 150 rpm. The microbial consortium that got established in shake flasks with individual isomers of HCH was mixed together and acclimated with 5 µg/ ml tech- HCH. Acclimation to<br><br>
higher concentrations was carried out after ensuring that the previously added concentration has been degraded completely. At 25 ng/ ml tech- HCH concentration in shake flasks, all the isomers of tech- HCH were found to be degraded completely. The individual bacterial strains of the consortium were identified by Microbact Gram Negative Bacterial identification System. Table 1 gives the composition of the tech- HCH acclimated bacterial consortium.<br>

The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
The mineral medium contained 0.675g KH2PO4, 5.455g Na2HP04, 0.250 g NH4N03 in one litre distilled water. 80g of soil was taken in plastic cups and 25 |ug tech- HCH/ g soil was added and mixed well. The inoculant formulation prepared in Sphagnum mass was added at levels containing 109 cells/ g soil. The final moisture level was maintained at 15%. Only the consortium was used in one set of experiments to compare the degradation with inoculant formulation. The cups were incubated at 25- 30 °C in a wooden chamber. Sampling was done at regular intervals and analysed for growth (CPU) and residual substrate. The results are presented in Table 2. Complete disappearance of all the four isomers of tech-HCH was observed by 120 h of incubation. The observations were same in both the types of inoculant formulations prepared using Sphagnum .<br>

The mineral medium contained 0.675g KH2PO4, 5.455g Na2HP04, 0.250g NH4N03 in one litre distilled water. 80g of soil was taken in plastic cups and 25 ^g tech- HCH/ g soil was added and mixed well. The inoculant formulation prepared in wheat bran was mixed to the spiked soil at the levels containing 109 cells/ g soil. The final moisture level was maintained at 15%. The cups were incubated at 25-30 0(19HCa wooden chamber. Sampling was done at regular intervals and analysed for growth (CPU) and residual substrate. The results are presented in Table 3. Complete disappearance of all the four isomers of tech- HCH was observed by 144 h of ubation.<br>

Example 3<br>
The stability of the inoculant formulations was studied by determining the number of organisms surviving after known period of storage. It was observed that the inoculant formulations prepared in Sphagnum mass was stable compared to that of wheat bran. The individual members did not survive after one month of storage in wheat bran pellet. The results are presented in Table 4.<br><br>

Example 4<br>
The mineral medium contained 0.675 g KH2PO4, 5.455 g Na2HP04, 0.250 g NH4N03. 80 g soil was taken in plastic cups and 25 ^ig tech-HCH /g soil was added and mixed well. The consortium was added at 2 |ig protein /g soil through 2000 ng protein /g soil. The final moisture level in the soil was maintained at 15%. The cups were incubated at 25 - 30 ° C in a wooden chamber. Sampling   was done at regular intervals and analysed for growth (cfus) and residual substrate. The results are presented in table 5. Complete disappearance of the substrate was observed when 500 fj,g protein /g soil was used. All four isomers of HCH disappeared completely by 120 h of incubation.<br>

Example 5<br>
The mineral medium contained 0.675 g KH2P04, 5.455 g Na2HPO4, 0.250 g NH4NO3. 80 g soil was taken in plastic cups and 25 |ig tech-HCH /g soil was added and mixed well. The consortium was added at 500 jxg protein /g soil. The final moisture level in the soil was maintained at 15%. The cups were incubated at 25 - 30 ° C in a wooden chamber. Sampling was done at regular intervals and analysed for growth (cfus) and residual substrate. The results are presented in table 6. It was observed that degradation was observed even at a low tech-HCH<br><br>
concentration of 2 jag /g soil. The time taken for degradation of tech-HCH increased with increase in tech-HCH concentration. 25^g tech-HCH /g soil was completely degraded by 120 h. But higher concentration were not completely degraded.<br>
