				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1 Field of the invention    <br>
The present invention relates to a telescopewith a multistage <br>
telescope cylinder    for<br>
selectively extending and retracting telescopic sections of a multi-section telescoping structure; and more particularly, to a telescoping system with a multi-stage telescopic cylinder.<br>
2.  Description of Related Art<br>
Many prior art telescoping systems include multiple single stage telescopic cylinders or a single multi-stage telescopic cylinder for extending and retracting multi-section telescopic structures such as multi-section booms. A multi-stage telescopic cylinder includes a plurality of cylinders and pistons arranged in a telescopic manner one within the other. Seals between respective pistons and cylinders, and internal passageways, permit hydraulic fluid to flow for either extending or retracting the cylinders. Each cylinder is typically connected to a section in the multi-section telescoping structure to telescope that section. Also, the inner most or smallest rod, forming a portion of the inner most or smallest piston, is connected to the base section of the multi-section telescoping structure.<br>
Typically, these multi-stage telescoping cylinders require hydraulic connections, for example, at least at the outer most or largest cylinder. As a result, these systems include hose reels which allow extension and retraction of hydraulic fluid carrying hoses attached to the multi-stage telescopic cylinder at the hydraulic connections. U.S. Patent 4,726,281 to De<br><br>
Filippi discloses such a telescoping system. Such systems can also require mounting control valves on the multi-stage telescoping structure near or at those hydraulic connections.<br>
U.S. Patents Nos. 5,111,733; 3,610,100; 3,603,207; and 3,128,674 disclose telescoping systems which eliminate hydraulic connections along the telescopic cylinder or cylinders. Instead, the hydraulic connections are made at the inner most or smallest rod of the telescopic cylinder. These telescoping systems, however, have complex inner most rod structures and/or have hydraulic control systems including more than one control valve.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The present invention will become more fully understood from the detailed description given hereinbelow and the accompanying drawings which are given by way of illustration only, and thus are not limitative of the present invention, and wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates the longitudinal cross-section of a telescoping system according to the present invention which includes a two-stage telescopic cylinder.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Fig. 1 illustrates the longitudinal cross-section of a telescoping system according to the present invention which includes a two-stage telescopic cylinder. As shown, the two stage telescopic cylinder includes a first tele cylinder 1 and a second tele cylinder 2. The first tele cylinder 1 includes a cylindrical first rod 4 connected to an annular first piston head 6. The first piston head 6 is disposed within a cylindrical second rod 8 of the second tele cylinder 2. The second rod 8 serves as the cylinder for the first tele cylinder 1. An annular second piston head 10 is connected to the second rod 8, and is disposed within a cylinder 16.<br>
Preferably, one end of the first rod 4 is mounted to the base section of a multi-section telescoping structure. A multi-section telescoping boom will be described as the multi-section telescoping structure for purposes of discussion. The multi-section telescoping boom can be a 3, 4, or 5 section boom. Fig. 1 illustrates the connections between the telescopic cylinder of the present invention and a five section boom. Specifically, the first rod 4 is connected to the base section, the second rod 8 is connected to the inner mid section, and the cylinder 16 is connected to the center mid section.<br>
The first rod 4 has a first port 18, a second port 20, and a common port 22 formed in an end thereof. The first rod 4 contains a first passageway 12 communicating with the first port 18, a second passageway 14 communicating with the second<br><br>
port 20, and a third passageway 15 communicating with the common port 22. The first piston head 6 includes a fourth passageway 24 formed therein such that hydraulic fluid entering the first rod 4 via the first port 18 and flowing through the first passageway 12 communicates with a first chamber 28. As shown in Fig. 1, the first chamber 28 is defined by the second rod 8, the first piston head 6 and the second piston head 10.<br>
The first piston head 6 also includes a fifth passageway 26 which allows fluid communication between the third passageway 15 and a second chamber 30. The second chamber 30 is defined by the first rod 4, the second piston head 6, and the second rod 8.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the second rod 8 includes a cylindrical inner wall 51 and a cylindrical outer wall 52. The cylindrical outer wall 52 has an inner barrel 54 and an outer barrel 56 which form a sixth passageway 58. The inner barrel 54 includes a seventh passageway 32 formed therein which allows fluid communication between the second chamber 30 and the sixth passageway 58. The outer barrel 56 includes an eighth passageway 34 formed therein which allows fluid communication between the sixth passageway 58 and a third chamber 36. As shown, the third chamber 36 is defined by the outer barrel 56, the second piston head 10, and the cylinder 16.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the cylindrical inner wall 51 extends through the first piston head 6 and into the first rod 4 to form a ninth passageway 38. The ninth passageway 38 allows fluid communication between the second passageway 14 and a tenth passageway 42 formed in the second piston head 10. Accordingly, the second, the ninth and the tenth passageways 14, 38 and 42 allow fluid communication between the second port 20 and a fourth chamber 40. As shown, the fourth chamber 40 is defined by the second piston head 10 and the cylinder 16.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the telescoping system further includes first and second holding valves 48 and 50 disposed at the first and second ports 18 and 20, respectively. The first holding valve 48 allows hydraulic fluid to freely flow into the first port 18, but only allows hydraulic fluid to flow out of<br><br>
the first port 18 when hydraulic fluid is received at its bias input. Similarly, the second holding valve 50 allows hydraulic fluid to freely flow into the second port 20, but only allows hydraulic fluid to flow out of the second port 20 when hydraulic fluid is received at its bias input. A first solenoid valve 44 regulates the supply of hydraulic fluid to<br>
the first holding valve _48, and is open in a de-energized<br>
state. A second solenoid valve 46 controls the supply of hydraulic fluid to the second holding valve 50, and is closed in a de-energized state. Both the first and second solenoid valves 44 and 46 are connected to a first control port of a control valve 60. A second control port of the control valve 60 is connected to the common port 22 and the bias inputs of the first and second holding valves 48 and 50.<br>
The control valve 60 is a tri-state control valve. In a first state, the hydraulic fluid supplied to the control valve 60 by a pump 63 is output from the first control port (i.e., to the first and second solenoid valves 44 and 46) , while the hydraulic fluid at the second control port is exhausted to a reservoir 64. In a second state, no hydraulic fluid is supplied to or exhausted from either the first or second control ports. In the third state, the hydraulic fluid from the pump 63 is supplied to the second port (i.e., the common port 22 and the bias inputs of the first and second holding valves 48 and 50) , while the hydraulic fluid at the first control port is exhausted to the reservoir 64.<br>
As further shown in Fig. 1, a relief valve 62 connects a line leading from the second solenoid valve 46 to the second holding valve 50 with the line leading from the control valve 60 to the common port 22.<br>
The operation of the telescoping system shown in Fig. 1 will now be described. The telescopic cylinder according to the present invention has two modes of operation: sequenced and synchronized. Sequenced operation will be discussed first. Assuming that the telescopic cylinder illustrated in Fig. 1 is fully retracted, the first and second solenoid valves 44, 46 are de-energized, and the control valve 60 is placed in the<br><br>
first state. In the de-energized state, the first solenoid valve 44 is open and the second solenoid valve 46 is closed. Consequently, hydraulic fluid flows via the first solenoid valve 44 through the first holding valve 48 into the first port 18. The hydraulic fluid supplied to the first port 18 flows via the first passageway 12 and the fourth passageway 24 into the first chamber 28, and exerts a force on the second piston head 10. As a result, the second rod 8 and the cylinder 16 will extend.<br>
Once fully stroked the first solenoid valve 44 and the second solenoid valve 46 are energized. The fully stroked position can be detected by, for example, a proximity switch (not shown). Energizing the first and second solenoid valves 44 and 46 causes the first solenoid valve 44 to close and the second solenoid valve 46 to open. Hydraulic fluid then flows through the second solenoid valve 46 and the second holding valve 50, and enters the second port 20. The hydraulic fluid flowing into the second port 20 enters the fourth chamber 40 via the second, ninth, and tenth passageways 14, 38, and 42. This hydraulic fluid exerts pressure on the cylinder 16 causing the cylinder 16 to extend. Once fully stroked, the second solenoid valve 46 is de-energized. Again, the fully stroked position can be detected using a proximity switch (not shown).<br>
To retract the telescopic cylinder illustrated in Fig. 1, the second solenoid valve 46 is opened and the control valve 60 is placed in the third state. Hydraulic pressure is thus supplied to the common port 22 and the bias inputs of the first and second holding valves 48 and 50. The supply of hydraulic fluid pilots the first and second holding valves 48, 50 open to allow hydraulic fluid to flow out of the first and second ports 18, 20. The hydraulic fluid supplied to the common port 22 flows into the second chamber 30 via the third and fourth passageways 15 and 26. The force exerted upon the second rod 8 by the hydraulic fluid, however, does not cause the second rod 8 to retract since the first solenoid valve 44 is maintained in the closed state. Instead, the hydraulic fluid flows into the third chamber 36 via the seventh, sixth, and eighth passageways<br><br>
32, 58, and 34. The hydraulic fluid pressure then exerts a force on the cylinder 16 causing the cylinder 16 to retract because the second solenoid valve 46 is open.<br>
Once the second cylinder 16 has fully retracted, the second solenoid valve 46 is closed and the first solenoid valve 44 is opened. In this state, hydraulic fluid is allowed to flow through the first solenoid valve 44, such that the force exerted on the second rod 8 by the hydraulic fluid causes the second rod 8 to retract.<br>
In the synchronized mode of operation, the first and second solenoid valves 44 and 46 are switched between the open and closed states at predetermined positional settings to extend the second piston head 10 and the cylinder 16 in a synchronized manner. Likewise, once the hydraulic fluid has been supplied to the common port 22, the first and second solenoid valves 44 and 46 are also switched between the open and closed state in order to retract the second rod 8 and the cylinder 16 in a synchronized manner.<br>
In the telescoping system according to the present invention, all the hydraulic connections to the telescopic cylinder are made at the end of the first rod 4, which is mounted to the base section of the multi-section boom. Consequently, all the hydraulic connections to the telescopic cylinder are made at the base section of the boom.<br>
Accordingly, the telescoping system according to the present invention eliminates the need for hose reels and associated hoses.<br>
Because hydraulic fluid connections are not made along the length of the telescopic cylinder, the telescoping system according to the present invention does not require mounting valves on the boom sections near or at those connections. Instead, the solenoid valves 44 and 46 can be mounted to the turntable supporting the multi-section boom.<br>
Furthermore, by using a double barreled outer wall for the second rod, the structure of the inner most rod is greatly simplified. By structuring the hydraulic control system using holding valves and solenoid valves, only a single control valve<br><br>
is required to control the operation of the telescopic cylinder according to the present invention.<br>
The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
