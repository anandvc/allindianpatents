				<td>"Interchangeable Drive System"<br>
The invention pertains to a drive system according to the introductory part of patent claim 1,<br>
as well as to a method for controlling such drive systems.<br>
It is known in case of devices or machines for handling bottles, cans or similar containers, as<br>
described in the document DE 190 43 907 Al, that the drive systems present should be<br>
designed in an interchangeable manner. In such machines, there is a horizontally arranged<br>
rotor that has several plate-like container carriers on its circumference, which carry the<br>
bottles, cans or similar items. The containers are placed at a point of the rotor circumference<br>
on the container carriers and fixed on to the carriers by means of suitable agents, so that on<br>
rotation of the container carrier they also rotate along with it. During a revolution of the rotor<br>
the containers are guided along several processing stations, which for example provide the<br>
containers with labels or imprints according to the design of the machine.<br>
For rotating the container carriers and the containers on them, a control drive is foreseen. For<br>
precise alignment of the container to the respective passed processing stations, additionally<br>
sensors are foreseen, for among other things angle measurement, and a control electronic<br>
mechanism is foreseen that takes care of precise alignment and guided rotation of the<br>
container at the processing stations. It is also known how to design the control drive with a<br>
control electronic mechanism, sensors and if required additional components, into a compact<br>
structural unit as drive system that is attached in an interchangeable manner on the rotor.<br>
The machine has a super-ordinate machine control that controls handling of the containers<br>
while running through the machine. For transmitting control commands to the individual<br>
machine components, various connection paths can be foreseen, for example a bus system or<br>
something similar.<br>
The modular drive units have an electronic control device that contains control programmes<br>
necessary for functioning of the drive, for example for evaluating the sensor information and<br>
precise controlling of a pre-given angular position.<br>
The modular design of the drive system enables us to quickly interchange a defective drive on<br>
the machine in case of repair work. One does not have to take up complicated mounting and<br>
dismounting jobs, as the complete module can be interchanged as a whole. However, here<br><br>
arises the problem that the class of the described machine is very large and as a result the<br>
structure of the machines is very different. Due to this reason, depending on the type of<br>
machine, the control drives have to fulfil different requirements, which are achieved among<br>
other things, in that different control programmes are used for the drive systems of different<br>
machines. In case of interchange, there occurs the problem that one has to take care that the<br>
programme version used within the drive system is suitable for the corresponding machine,<br>
which according to the state-of-the-art technology leads to the situation that several drive<br>
systems have to be kept ready in stock in order to be able to react to faults in different<br>
machine types, as described.<br>
It is the task of this invention to make a drive system of the described type available, which<br>
can be used without manual adaptation for several different machines and thus avoids the<br>
above described disadvantages.<br>
To fulfil this task, a drive system having the features mentioned in patent claim 1 is<br>
suggested.<br>
The drive system has a configuration that can be used in several handling machines. On<br>
account of the re-describable design of the storage device for the control programme, or the<br>
hardware, the respective version suitable for the machine can be transmitted to the storage<br>
devices of the drive system. Contrary to the conventional system, where this has to take place<br>
with the help of extra installed hardware or replacement of the storage device, in this<br>
invention the transmission can take place directly from the super-ordinate machine unit into<br>
the storage device.<br>
After complete mounting or replacement of the drive system in the machine, with the help of<br>
the available communication interface, a connection is established between the storage<br>
element and the electronic control-regulating unit and/or monitoring unit of the drive system<br>
and the super-ordinate machine control. This can subsequently precisely transmit control<br>
programmes suitable for this machine into the storage device.<br>
In this way, it is possible that specific drive systems that are not interchangeable do not have<br>
to be kept ready for each machine type, but a uniform drive is present that is provided with<br><br>
the required control programmes after mounting into a machine and then becomes completely<br>
functionally efficient on this machine.<br>
The control programme can be stored in the machine control itself or in external storage units<br>
accessible to the machine control. Known controls often have integrated, flexibly usable<br>
control devices that can be used for this purpose.<br>
The machine control is therefore designed as SPS, PC or micro-controller.<br>
Ideally, the control programme is stored in the data format used for the drive system, i.e. in<br>
the form of a binary file, so that it can easily be directly transmitted to the storage device of<br>
the drive system and one does not have to go through any complicated conversion steps.<br>
For differentiating the different control programmes, these could have a version identification<br>
element that can be read by the machine control. In this way, it is easily possible to<br>
distinguish the different versions of control programmes from one another, in order to<br>
determine which programme is required for the actual machine in question. The machine<br>
control can then subsequently compare the read version identification element of the newly<br>
inserted drive with the one available in its storage device and determine whether<br>
interchanging of the stored programme is necessary. If that be the case, the machine control<br>
transmits the stored control programme to the drive system and overwrites for example the<br>
programme already present in the storage device, so that as a result it contains the correct<br>
suitable programme.<br>
This can take place either automatically or manually, whereby ideally after interchanging the<br>
drive system checking is undertaken. The then required interchanging, if necessary, can<br>
similarly take place automatically or after confirmation, for example, by an operator.<br>
This and further extensions of the invention can be obtained from the sub-claims.<br>
For fulfilling the task of the invention, additionally a device for handling bottles, cans and<br>
similar containers is suggested according to claim 9. This device similarly fulfils the required<br>
task in a favourable manner.<br><br>
For fulfilling the task, the invention further presents a controlling method for drive systems<br>
according to claim 10, which similarly fulfils the required task in a favourable manner.<br>
The invention is described in more details below on the basis of drawings. The following are<br>
shown:<br>
Fig. 1 A schematic top view on a processing/handling machine as per the invention; and<br>
Fig.2 A partially sectioned schematic view of a drive system as per the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically depicts a processing machine according to the invention generally<br>
denoted by 1. It has a circular rotor 2 that is supported to rotate about a vertical axis and is<br>
rotated by a drive system that is not shown in details. On the rotor there are several container<br>
carriers 3 that circulate along with the rotor and in themselves can rotate about their central<br>
axis.<br>
Containers 4, like for example bottles, are delivered to the machine by a conveying<br>
mechanism 5 and placed on the container carriers 3 by a protractor 6, where they are pressed<br>
by a fixing unit (not shown in details) from above on to the container carrier 3.<br>
The containers are then guided past the processing stations 7 by the rotating rotor 2, where the<br>
containers are provided with labels, for example, on the front and back side. For this/by<br>
rotating the container carrier 3, on the one hand, the exact positioning of the labels on the<br>
front or back side is ensured, and by corresponding rotation of the container 4 while passing<br>
by, a clean application of the labels is also ensured. After the containers have been guided<br>
past all the handling stations, they are removed from the container carriers 3 by another<br>
protractor 8 after loosening the fastening mechanism and placed on the conveying mechanism<br>
5, from where they are subsequently transported away.<br>
For precise positioning of the container carriers 3, a drive system is foreseen that is generally<br>
designated as 9 and shown in more details in fig. 2. The drive system 9 is structured as a<br>
compact module and is inserted with its cover plate 10 into corresponding recesses in the<br>
rotor 2 and fixed there. It carries on its upper side respectively one container carrier 3.<br><br>
For precise rotation of the container carrier 3, an electro-motor servo drive 11 is foreseen in<br>
the interior space, whose rotation axis is connected directly or, in an extension, through a<br>
gear, with the rotation axis of the container carrier 3.<br>
For determining the actual angular position of the servo drive 11 and hence of the container<br>
carrier 3, a rotation angle sensor 12 is foreseen on the servo drive 11. Another sensor 13 is<br>
foreseen for monitoring further operating parameters and for detecting faults.<br>
The sensors 12 and 13 are connected to a control unit 14. This has an internal storage unit 15<br>
for recording running operating parameters and another storage device 16 for recording a<br>
control programme.<br>
The control unit 14 is connected to an external bus system 19 by means of a communication<br>
interface 17 through a plug connection 18.<br>
The bus system 19, apart from being connected to the drive systems 9 according to the<br>
invention, is also connected to a super-ordinate machine control 20. This monitors the<br>
functioning of the machine 1 with a number of sensors (not shown in details) and forwards<br>
control commands to the various machine components. Among other things, it forwards<br>
appropriate control commands related to the actual required positioning of a container carrier<br>
3 to the drive systems 9.<br>
These control commands that are transmitted to the control device 14 through the bus system<br>
19 and the communication interface 17 are evaluated there, and on the basis of the actual<br>
position of the container carrier 3 made known by the sensor 12, corresponding control<br>
impulses are generated for required rotation of the servo motor 11 and transmitted to it.<br>
Additionally, in the described art and manner, return messages about the actual position of the<br>
container carrier 3 can be transmitted by the control 14 to the machine control 20.<br>
The machine control 20 also has a storage zone 21, in which required control programmes for<br>
the individual components of the machine are stored. Besides, the machine control 20 can<br>
query through the bus system 19 from the individual control unit 14, as to which version<br>
identification element the storage programmes stored in their storage unit 16 have. Moreover,<br>
the machine control 20 can compare these identification elements with identification elements<br><br>
of the control programmes stored in its storage 21. It is also possible to transmit the control<br>
programmes stored in the storage 21 to selected control units 14 through the communication<br>
interface 17 and thus overwrite the control programmes stored there in the storage 16.<br>
In case of a defect in any part of a drive system 9, this defect is identified by the control unit<br>
14 and conveyed to the machine control 20 through the communication connections 17.<br>
Irrespective of the intensity of the defect, it subsequently releases an alarm and brings the<br>
machine to a standstill. It also displays corresponding messages and identifies the<br>
corresponding drive system.<br>
Subsequently this drive system 9 can be replaced by a functional one by detaching the<br>
complete unit from the rotor 2 and again inserting and fixing the new functional unit.<br>
Thereafter, only the electrical and the communication connections have to be re-established<br>
and the machine is basically again ready for use.<br>
After complete installation, the machine control 20 asks the version identification element of<br>
the control unit 14 newly installed in the storage unit 16 about the stored control programme<br>
and compares this identification element with that of the stored programme stored in its<br>
storage 21 and which is required for correct functioning of the machine. If both identification<br>
elements match, corresponding messages are generated and the machine 1 is again taken into<br>
operation.<br>
If the version identification elements do not match, the machine control 20 passes on a copy<br>
of the suitable control programme available in its storage 21 to the control unit 14 through the<br>
bus system 19 and the communication connection 17; the control unit 14 then overwrites the<br>
control programme already present in its storage unit 16. After completion of the<br>
transmission process and checking, if required, as to whether the transmission was successful,<br>
the correct control programme is now also present in the replaced drive system 9, so that<br>
subsequently re-commissioning of the machine 1 is initiated by the machine control, as<br>
described above.<br>
In the description of the design example above, one exclusively spoke of control software.<br>
Within the scope of this application, the term control software implies that software which is<br>
required for operating the drive systems, whereby within the scope of this invention it is not<br><br>
absolutely necessary that this software is completely transmitted by the machine control 20 to<br>
the storage unit 16 of the drive system. For example, parts of the required software may<br>
already be present within the drive system.<br>
Within the scope of this application, the term control software implies software components<br>
that are commonly known as operating system, as well as also software components that are<br>
commonly known as application software.<br>
Here the term "operating system" refers to programmes or data that provide the super-ordinate<br>
software, e.g. the control software, the information and control commands necessary for<br>
operating the hardware components within the drive systems. The term "application<br>
software" in the shown design example refers, for example, to the rotation programme, i.e. the<br>
instruction as to how the containers have to rotate during a circulation of the rotor.<br>
Obviously the invention is not restricted to the above mentioned design example, but can be<br>
varied in multiple respects without departing from the basic concept of the invention.<br>
Hence it is not necessary to use the drive system only for driving plate-like container carriers.<br>
Rather several drive systems that can be applied in handling machines can be designed as a<br>
modular unit and can be adapted to the respective application purpose by using appropriately<br>
adapted control programmes. Even in such systems, the invention obviously finds<br>
application.<br>
Also further variations of the invention, like the application of external storages instead of<br>
integrated storage units, star-like communication systems instead of using bus systems,<br>
several possible drives etc. have been enumerated here only as examples of variation.<br><br><br>
