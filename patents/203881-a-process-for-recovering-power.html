COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 ; rule 13\]<br>
"A PROCESS FOR PRODUCINQ POWER FROM LIQUEF4EEX-UA^JRAL -GAS21"<br><br>
EXXONMOBIL UPSTREAM RESEARCH COMPANY, of P.O. Box 2189, Houston, Texas 77252-3189, United States of America.<br><br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
WO 99/50536<br><br>
PCT/US99/06131<br><br>
PRODUCING POWER FROM LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to a process for converting liquefied natural gas at one pressure to liquefied natural gas at a higher pressure and producing by-5     product power by economic use of the available liquefied natural gas cold sink.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Natural gas is often available in areas remote to where it will be ultimately used. Quite often the source of this fuel is separated from the point of use by a large body of water and it may then prove necessary to transport the natural gas by large<br>
10     vessels designed for such transport. Natural gas is normally transported overseas as cold liquid in carrier vessels. At the receiving terminal, this cold liquid, which in conventional practice is at near atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of about -160°C (~256°F) must be regasified and fed to a distribution system at ambient temperature and at a suitable elevated pressure, generally around 80 atmospheres.<br>
15      This requires the addition of a substantial amount of heat and a process for handling LNG vapors produced during the unloading process. These vapors are sometimes referred to as boil-off gases.<br>
Many suggestions have also been made and some installations have been built to use the large cold potential of the LNG. Some of these processes use the LNG<br>
20     vaporization process to produce by-product power as a way of using the available LNG cold. The available cold is used by using as a hot sink energy sources such as seawater, ambient air, low-pressure steam and flue gas. The heat-transfer between the sinks is effected by using a single component or multi-component heat-transfer medium as the heat exchange media. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,320,303 uses<br>
25     propane as a heat-transfer medium in a closed loop process to generate electricity. The LNG liquid is vaporized by liquefying propane, the liquid propane is then vaporized by seawater, and the vaporized propane is used to power a turbine which drives an electric power generator. The vaporized propane discharged from the<br><br><br>
WO 99/50536<br><br>
PCT/US99/06131<br><br>
turbine then warms the LNG, causing the LNG to vaporize and the propane to liquefy. The principle of power generation from LNG cold potential is based on the Rankine cycle, which is similar to the principle of the conventional thermal power plants.<br>
Before the practice of this invention, all proposals for using the cold potential 5      of LNG involved regasification of the LNG. The prior art did not recognize the<br>
benefits of converting liquefied natural gas at one pressure to liquefied natural gas at a higher temperature and using the cold potential of the lower pressure LNG.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The practice of this invention provides a source of power to meet the 10     compression horsepower needed to convert conventional LNG to pressurized LNG.<br>
In the process of this invention, liquefied natural gas is pumped from a pressure at or near atmospheric pressure to a pressure above 1379 kPa (200 psia). The pressurized liquefied natural gas is then passed through a first heat exchanger whereby the pressurized liquefied natural gas is heated to a temperature above -112°C<br>
15      (-170°F) while keeping the liquefied natural gas at or below its bubble point. The process of this invention simultaneously produces energy by circulating in a closed power cycle through the first and second heat exchanger a first heat-exchange medium, comprising the steps of (1) passing to the first heat exchanger the first heat-exchange medium in heat exchange with the liquefied gas to at least partially liquefy<br>
20     the first heat-exchange medium; (2) pressurizing the at least partially liquefied first heat-exchange medium by pumping; (3) passing the pressurized first heat-exchange medium of step (2) through the first heat exchange means to at least partially vaporize the liquefied first heat-exchange medium; (4) passing the first heat-exchange medium of step (3) to the second heat exchanger to further heat the first heat-exchange<br>
25     medium to produce a pressurized vapor; (4) passing the vaporized first heat-exchange medium of step (3) through an expansion device to expand the first heatrexchange medium vapor to a lower pressure whereby energy is produced; (5) passing the<br><br><br>
WO 99/50536<br><br>
PCT/US99/06131<br><br><br>
expanded first heat-exchange medium of step (4) to the first heat exchanger, and (6) repeating steps (1) through (5).<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
The present invention and its advantages will be better understood by referring 5     to the following detailed description and the attached drawing which is a schematic flow diagram of one embodiment of this invention to convert LNG at one temperature and pressure to a higher temperature and pressure and recovering power as a by¬product. The drawing is not intended to exclude from the scope of the invention other embodiments set out herein or which are the result of normal and expected 10     modifications of the embodiment disclosed in the drawing.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This process of this invention uses the cold of liquefied natural gas at or near atmospheric pressure to produce a liquefied natural gas product and to provide a power cycle that preferably provides power, part of which is preferably used for the 15     process.<br>
Referring to the drawing, reference character 10 designates a line for feeding liquefied natural gas (LNG) at or near atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of about -160°C (-256°F) to an insulated storage vessel 11. The storage vessel 11 can be an onshore stationary storage vessel or it can be a container on a ship. Line 10 may 20     be a line used to load storage vessels on a ship or it can be a line extending from a container on the ship to an onshore storage vessel.<br>
Although a portion of the LNG in vessel 11 will boil off as a vapor during storage and during unloading of storage containers, the major portion of the LNG in vessel 11 is fed through line 12 to a suitable pump 13. The pump 13 increases the 25     pressure of the PLNG to the pressure above about 1,3 80 kPa (200 psia), and preferably above about 2,400 kPa (350 psia).<br><br><br>
WO 99/50536<br><br>
PCT/US99/06131<br><br>
The liquefied natural gas discharged from the pump 13 is directed by line 14 through heat exchanger 15 to heat the LNG to a temperature above about -112°C (-170°F). The pressurized natural gas (PLNG) is then directed by line 16 to a suitable transportation or handling system.<br>
5	A heat-transfer medium or refrigerant is circulated in a closed-loop cycle. The<br>
heat-transfer medium is passed from the first heat exchanger 15 by line 17 to a pump 18 in which the pressure of the heat-transfer medium is raised to an elevated pressure. The pressure of the cycle medium depends on the desired cycle properties and the type of medium used. From pump 18 the heat-transfer medium, which is in liquid 10     condition and at elevated pressure, is passed through line 19 to heat exchanger 15 wherein the heat-transfer medium is heated. From the heat exchanger 15, the heat-transfer medium is passed by line 20 to heat exchanger 26 wherein the heat-transfer medium is further heated.<br>
Heat from any suitable heat source is introduced to heat exchanger 26 by 15     line 21 and the cooled heat source medium exits the heat exchanger through line 22. Any conventional low cost source of heat can be used; for example, ambient air, ground water, seawater, river water, or waste hot water or steam. The heat from the heat source passing through the heat exchanger 26 is transferred to the heat-transfer medium. This heat-transfer causes the gasification of the heat-transfer medium, so it 20     leaves the heat exchanger 26 as a gas of elevated pressure. This gas is passed through line 23 to a suitable work-producing device 24. Device 24 is preferably a turbine, but it may be any other form of engine, which operates by expansion of the vaporized heat-transfer medium. The heat-transfer medium is reduced in pressure by passage through the work-producing device 24 and the resulting energy may be recovered in 25     any desired form, such as rotation of a turbine which can be used to drive electrical generators or to drive pumps (such as pumps 13 and 18) used in the regasification process.<br>
The reduced pressure heat-transfer medium is directed from the work-producing device 24 through line 25 to the first heat exchanger 15 wherein the heat-<br><br><br>
WO 99/50536<br><br>
PCT/US99/06131<br><br>
transfer medium is at least partially condensed, and preferably entirely condensed, and the LNG is heated by a transfer of heat from the heat-transfer medium to the LNG. The condensed heat-transfer medium is discharged from the heat exchanger 15 through line 17 to the pump 18, whereby the pressure of the condensed heat-transfer 5     medium is substantially increased.<br>
The heat-transfer medium may be any fluid having a freezing point below the boiling temperature of the pressurized liquefied natural gas, does not form solids in heat exchangers 15 and 26, and which in passage through heat exchangers 15 and 26 has a temperature above the freezing temperature of the heat source but below the<br>
10     actual temperature of the heat source. The heat-transfer medium may therefore be in liquid form during its circulation through heat exchangers 15 and 26 to provide a transfer of sensible heat alternately to and from the heat-transfer medium. It is preferred, however, that the heat-transfer medium be used which goes through at least partial phase changes during circulation through heat exchangers 15 and 26, with a<br>
15      resulting transfer of latent heat.<br>
The preferred heat-transfer medium has a moderate vapor pressure at a temperature between the actual temperature of the heat source and the freezing temperature of the heat source to provide a vaporization of the heat-transfer medium during passage through heat exchangers 15 and 26. Also, the heat-transfer medium, in<br>
20     order to have a phase change, must be liquefiable at a temperature above the boiling temperature of the pressurized liquefied natural gas, such that the heat-transfer medium will be condensed during passage through heat exchanger 15. The heat-transfer medium can be a pure compound or a mixture of compounds of such composition that the heat-transfer medium will condense over a range of temperatures<br>
25      above the vaporizing temperature range of the liquefied natural gas.<br>
Although commercial refrigerants may be used as heat-transfer mediums in the practice of this invention, hydrocarbons having 1 to 6 carbon atoms per molecule such as propane, ethane, and methane, and mixtures thereof, are preferred heat-transfer mediums, particularly since they are normally present in at least minor amounts in 30     natural gas and therefore are readily available.<br><br><br>
WO 99/50536<br><br>
PCT/US99/0613J<br><br>
Example<br>
A simulated mass and energy balance was carried out to illustrate the preferred embodiment of the invention as described by the drawing, and the results are set forth in the Table below. The data in the Table assumed a LNG production rate of about 5     753 MMSCFD (37,520 kgmole/hr) and a heat-transfer medium comprising a<br>
50%-50% methane-ethane binary mixture. The data in the Table were obtained using a commercially available process simulation program called HYSYS™. However, other commercially available process simulation programs can be used to develop the data, including for example HYSIM™, PROE™, and ASPEN PLUS™, which are 10     familiar to persons skilled in the art. The data presented in the Table are offered to provide a better understanding of the present invention, but the invention is not to be construed as necessarily limited thereto. The temperatures and flow rates are not to be considered as limitations upon the invention which can have many variations in temperatures and flow rates in view of the teachings herein.<br>
