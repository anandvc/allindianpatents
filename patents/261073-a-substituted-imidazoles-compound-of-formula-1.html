				<td>SUBSTITUTED imidazolS AND THEIR USE AS PESTICIDES<br>
This invention relates to imidazols having parasiticidai properties. The compounds of interest are substituted imidazols and, more particularly, the invention relates to alpha substituted 2-benzyi imidazols.<br>
There Is a need for improved antiparasitic agents for use with mammals, including humans and animals, and In particular there fe a need for improved insecticides and acaricides. Furthermore there is a need for improved topical products with convenient administration and which contain one or more of such antipcirasitic agents which can be used to effectively treat ectoparasites, such as Insects and acarids, and particularly aracids such as mites and ticks. Such products would be particularly useful for the treatment of companion animals, such as cats, dogs and horses, and livestock, such as cattle.  There is equally a need for agents to control parasitic infestations in animal hosts other than mammals, including insects such as bees, which are susceptible to parasites such as varroa mites.<br>
The compounds currently available for insecticidal and acaricidal treatment of companion animals and livestock do not always demonstrate good activity, good speed of action, or a long duration of action. Most treatments contain hazardous chemicals that can have serious consequences when either used too' often or when used in excess of recommended quantities. Many products have toxic side effects and some are lethal to cats when accidentally ingested. They are not always suitable for use as a topical or spot-on formulation and some topical and spot-on formulations are disadvantaged by common side effects in animals and owners. Persons applying these insecticide! and acaricidal agents are advised to limit their exposure to the chemicals by wearing gloves and avoiding Inhalation of the chemical vapours. Pet collars and tags have been utilised to overcome some problems, but these are susceptible to chewing and therefore are disadvantageous since the compound may be accidentally orally ingested. Thus, treatm ents currently achieve varying degrees of success depending on a variety of factors including toxicity and the method of administration. In some cases toxicity may be attributed to their non-selective activity at various receptors. In addition it has recently been shown that some current agents are becoming ineffective as the parasites develop resistance.<br>
The present invention overcomes one or more of the various disadvantages of, or improves upon, the properties of existing compounds. In particular the present invention develops some new alpha substituted 2-benzyl imidazols which demonstrate such properties.<br>
Heterocyclic derivatives have been disclosed in the prior art as having insecticidal and acaricidal activity against agricultural pests, for example International patent application publication no. WO 03/092374.<br>
Generic disclosures also exist In the prior art of heterocyclic derivatives which optionally encompass alpha substituted 2-benzyl imidazols. For example, international patent application publication no. WO 2005/007188 describes a generic structure, which optionally encompasses alpha substituted 2-benzyl imidazols for the inhibition of the hatching of an ectoparasite egg; international patent application publication no. WO 2004/103959 describes a generic structure which optionally encompasses alpha<br><br>
 substituted 2-benzyl imidazols for use as antibacterial agents; international patent applications<br>
publication nos WO 01/00586 and WO 99/28300 both describe a generic structure which optionally<br>
encompasses alpha substituted 2-benzyl imidazols and discloses their adrenergic activity; and US<br>
patent US 6,103,733 describes a generic structure which optionally encompasses alpha substituted 2-<br>
benzyl imidazols for increasing blood serum and HDL cholesterol levels. However, none of this prior art<br>
exemplifies any alpha substituted 2-benzyl imidazols, nor does the prior art Indicate that such<br>
compounds would be useful against a spectrum of parasites relevant to companion animals and livestock<br>
or against the range of ectoparasite lifecycle stages.<br>
Thus, it is an aim of the present invention to overcome one or more of the various disadvantages of, or improve on the properties of, known compounds. In particular it is an aim of the Invention to develop some new alpha substituted 2-benzyl substituted imidazols. It is a further aim that such new compounds have the same or improved activity when compared to the prior art compounds against parasites. It is another aim of the present invention to develop compounds which have a similar or decreased toxicity profile when compared to the prior art compounds. It is yet another aim to develop compounds which demonstrate selectivity for the octopaminergic receptor, a known invertebrate neurotransmitter, over the ubiquitous animal adrenergic receptor. Furthermore, it is an aim of the invention to reduce the exposure of both humans and animals to the treatment by developing compounds which can be dosed as a low volume spot-on or topical application. The compounds of the present invention have especially good ability to control arthropods as shown by the results of tests demonstrating their potency and efficacy. In particular, the compounds of the present Invention are active against ticks and they are able to prevent ticks from attaching to, and feeding from, the host annnai. It is yet another aim of the present invention to provide compounds which have good speed of action when compared to those of the prior art and hence an improved efficacy against the transmission of tick borne diseases.<br>
It is alsio desirable that the compounds of the present invention should have one or more of the same or improved duration of action, an improved pharmacokinetic profile, improved safety, improved persistence, improved solubility or other improved physicochemical and formulation properties such as good spreading after topical application compared to those of the prior art<br>

Within the scope of the invention are so-called 'prodrugs' of the compounds of formula (I). Thus certain derivatives of compounds of formula (I) which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body of an animal, be converted by the host or parasite into compounds of formula (I) having the desired activity, for example, by hydroiytic or enzymatic cleavage.<br><br>
Such derivatives are referred to as 'prodrugs'. It will be appreciated that certain compounds of formula (I)<br>
may themselves act as pro-drugs of other compounds of formula (J). Further information on the use of<br>
prodrugs may be found in 'Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vbf 14, ACS Symposium Series (T<br>
Higuohi and W Stella) and 'Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design', Pergamon Press, 1987 (ed. E B<br>
Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association).<br>
Prodrugs In accordance with the invention can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the compounds of formula (I) with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as 'pro-moieties' as described, for example, In "Design of Prodrugs" by H Bundgaard {Elsevier, 1985).<br>
Some examples of prodrugs in accordance with the invention include:<br>

(ii) where the compound of form ula (I) contains an alcohol functionality (-OH), an ether thereof, for example, replacement of the hydrogen with {C1-CB)alkanoyioxymethyl; and<br>
(in) where the compound of formula (I) contains a primary or secondary amino functionality (-N1H2 or -NHR where R * H), an amide thereof, for example, replacement of one or both hydrogens with (Cr Cio)alkanoyl.<br>
Prodrugs in accordance with the invention can, for example, be produced by reacting compounds of formula (I) wherein R8 is H with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as 'pro-drug moieties' as described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs" by H Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985); "Design and application of prodrugs," Textbook of Drug Design and Discovery, {3,d Edition), 2002,410-458, (Taylor and Francis Ltd., London); and references therein. Examples of substituents include: alkyl amines, aryl amines, amides, ureas, carbamates, carbonates, imines, enamfnes, imides, suffenamides, and sulfonamides.

In a further aspect, the present invention provides processes for the preparation of a compound of<br>
formula (I), or a pharmaceutical!/, veterinarily or agriculturally acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutical^, veterinarily or agriculturally acceptable solvate (including hydrate) of either entity, as illustrated below.<br>
The following processes are illustrative of the general synthetic procedures which may be adopted in order to obtain the compounds of the invention.<br>

It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that sensitive functional groups may need to be protected and deprotected during synthesis of a compound of the invention. This may be achieved by conventional methods, for example as described in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" by TW Greene and PGM Wuts, John W3iley &amp; Sons lnc {1999), and references therein. Thus, when one or mora of R*, Ft2, R3, R4, R5, R6, RT, R8r R9, R10, R11 R1a, R,s and R18 contain reactive functional groups then additional protection may be provided according to standard procedures during the synthesis oi compounds of formula (J). ]n the processes described below, for all synthetic precursors used In the synthesis of compounds of formula (I), the definitions of R\ R2, R3, R*. R6, R8, R7, R8, R9, R10 R11 R12, R15 and R16, wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, Rs, R7, R8, R9, R10, R" R1a, R,s and R'6, are as defined for formula (I), are intended to optionally Include suitably protected variants, P\ P2, P3, P4, P5, Pfi, P7, P8, P3, Pm. P1t P12,P15 and P16. Such suitable protecting groups for these functionalities are described in the references listed below and the use of these protecting groups where needed Is specifically Intended to fall within the scape of the processes described in the present invention for producing compounds of formula (!) and its precursors. When suitable protecting groups are used, then these will need to be removed to yield compounds of formula (I). Depratection can be effected according to standard procedures including those described in the references listed below. When R6 is a protecting group it is preferred that it is chosen Irom benzyl, p-methoxybenzyl, diethcxymethyf, allyl and trityl.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be obtained from other compounds of formula (I) by standard procedures such as electrophilic or nucleophilic substitution, organometallic catalysed cross coupling reactions and functional group interconversions known to those skilled in the art. For example, compounds of formula (I) In which one or more of R1, Ra, R3, R4 and R5 are C02Rc wherein RC = aikyl, may be transformed into compounds of formula (I) in which one or more of R1, R2, R3, R4 and R6 are C02Rd wherein Rd = NH2 upon treatment with ammonium hydroxide at 85Â°C for 2 h. Similarly compounds of formula (I) wherein one or more of R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are C02Rd wherein Rd = NH2 upon treatment with a dehydrating agent such as thionyl chloride at low temperatures in an anhydrous solvent such as N,N-dimethylforrnamlde produce the corresponding nitrile compound.<br>
Compounds of fonnula (I), wherein R8 is C1-C4 aikyl, R9, R11 and R12 are hydrogen and R6 is hydrogen or alkyl and R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are as defined previously<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
may be synthesised from compounds of formula (II) using standard hydrogenation procedures. For example, compounds of formula (II) wherein Ra is hydrogen, and Rb is hydrogen or alky) may be reduced to compounds of form ula (!) in a suitable protic solvent such as methanol or propan-2-ol under a hydrogen atmosphere at temperatures up to 60Â°C and elevated pressure up to 300 psi in the presence of 10% palladium on carbon or Freiborg activated 10% palladium on carbon lor up to 72 h.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) in which one or more of R1, R2, Ra, R4 and R6 are optionally halo, and the remainder of R1, R2, R3, R* and R5 are as previously defined, may be accessed from compounds of formula (II) in which one or more of R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are optionally hato by hydrogenation procedures. Thus, compounds of formula (II) may be reduced to give compounds of formula (I) under a hydrogen atmosphere at temperatures up to 60Â°C and elevated pressure up to 200psi In the presence of 10% palladium on carbon and a chelating agent such as zinc bromide in a standard protic solvent such as methanol or propan-2-ol.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula (I) may be obtained from compounds of form ula (II) by transfer hydrogenation conditions. For example, ammonium formale or formic actd or ammonium formate in the presence of formic acid may be used to generate an in situ source of hydrogen which when In the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst such as 10% palladium on carbon in an alcoholic solvent such as propan-2-ol, for 2 - 3 hours at temperatures up to 80Â°C can be used to effect the transformation of compounds of formula (II) to compounds of formula (I). Optionally reactions using formic add as the hydrogen source may be performed without alcoholic solvents.<br>

Stereoselective hydrogenations may be performed to yield a preferred stereoisomer using chiraJ catalysts, in accordance with standard organic chemistry textbooks or literature precedent. For example there are many known homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic methods using transition metals such as palladium, rhodium and ruthenium. One particularly preferred catalyst is bis(norbomadiene)rhodium(l) tetraf luoroborate.   Enantiopure ligands that have been utilised to effect enantioselective hydrogenations have been referenced m the literature and illustrative examples of homochiral ligands include phospholanes such as Duphos and its analogues, ferrocenyl ligands such as Josiphos, H(R)-2-diphenylphosphino)feirocenyl]ethy!di-tert-butylphospriine, biphenyl ligands such as (+/-)-2,2-Bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-brnaphthalene (BINAP) and miscellaneous ligands such as Prophos, Dtamp, Bicp, Monophos. References providing details of enantioselective hydrogenations include Y. Yamanori, T. Imamoto, Reviews on Heteraatam Chemistry, 1999, 20, 227; T. Clark, C. Landis, Tetrahedron : Asymmetry, 2004,15,14,2123; H. Blaser, Topics in Catalysis, 2002,19,1,3; H.

Thus, enantiomerically enriched compounds of formula (!) may be obtained from acMra! compounds of formula (II) by stereoselective hydrogenation. For example, compounds of formula (fl) wherein PJ? is hydrogen, and Rb is hydrogen or alkyl may be reduced to compounds of formula (1) in a suitable protlc solvent such as methanol under a hydrogen atmosphere at ambienl temperatures and elevated pressure up to 60 psi in the presence of a rhodium catalyst such as bis<norbomadiene telrafluoroborale and chiral ligand such as to give optically enriched compounds of formula></norbomadiene>
Chiral resolution can be utilltsed to enhance the enantiomeric purity of compounds of formula (f).   For example, an acid salt can be enantjoselectively formed upon addition of an enantiomerically pure chiral acid such as di-p-toluoyl-L-tartaric acid in a suitable protlc solvent such as methanol. Using this process one enanriomer preferentially forms a crystalline salt which can be removed by fillralion whereas the other enantiomer remains in the mother liquor. Upon separately basifying the salt and mother liquor with a suitable base such as sodium hydroxide (1N), the enantiomers are resolved to give separated optically enriched compounds of formula (I). .<br>
Alternatively, racemic compounds of formula (I) may be resolved using chiral HPLC procedures, known to those skilled in the art, to give enantiomerically pure compounds of formula (I).<br>
Compounds of formula (II) wherein R6 is a protecting group such as benzyl or substituted benzyl e.g. p-rnethoxybenzyl, may be deprotected and reduced under hydrogenation conditions to give compounds of formula (I) wherein R6 is hydrogen.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
imidazol ring formation can also be utilised to access compounds of formula {.!), other synthetic methods are precedented in textbooks and the literature. One illustrative example is from desirably substituted phenylacetonftrile reactants, for example a compound such as 2-(2,3-dimethylphenyl)propanenitrile may be reacted with an appropriately substituted ethylenediamine for example, the p-toluenesulfomc acid salt of ethylenediamine at elevated temperatures ranging from 140Â°-180Â°C to form the compound of formula (I) wherein R1R2 and R8 are methyl and R3, R4, Rs, R8 and R9, R1T and R12are hydrogen.<br>
Another example of imidazol ring formation is from the reaction of suitably 2-substituted 2-aryl-1 ,1-dibromoethenes and an appropriately substituted ethylenediamine at room temperature to give the<br><br>
intermediate 2-substituted 2-arylmethyiimidazoline. Standard oxidation procedures such as Swern<br>
oxidation can transform the Intermediate 2-substJtuted 2-arylmethyllmldazoline Into compounds oi formula (I)<br>
Compounds of formula (II) may be prepared fay Wittlg chemistry by the reaction of a compound of formula (X) with the appropriate alkylphoaphonium salt-derived phosphorus ylid. For example treatment of a methyJtriphenylphosphonium hallde with a strong base in a suitable solvent, followed by the addition of (X), will produce a compound of formula (II) wherein both Raand Rb are hydrogen. Preferably the base reagent is a solution of n-butyllithium in hexane, the soh/ent is ether or tetrahydrofuran and the reaction is conducted at from about room temperature to about 35Â°C.<br>
Compounds of formula (II) may undergo functional group tnterconversion into other compounds of formula (II). For example, wherein one or more of R1, Ra, R3, R* and RB are bromo or iodo, and R6 is protected with a suitable protecting group such as benzyl, palladium catalysed coupling reactions such as StiHe, Heck and Suzuki coupling reactions may be effected. For example, treatment of such organohalide compounds of formula (II) with a suitable boronic acid such as an aikyi or aryl boronic acid, in an inert solvent such as toluene, in the presence of a suitable base such as potassium phosphate, a suitable phosphlne ligand such as tricyclohexylphosphine and palladium acetate under an inert atmosphere at elevated temperatures up to 120 Â°C for up to 18 h provides the corresponding alkylated or arylated compound of formula (II). Similarly, compounds of formula (II) wherein one or more of R1, Ra, R3, R4 and R5 are bromo or iodo, and R6 is protected with a suitable protecting group such as benzyl, may undergo transmetallatlon reaction with a palladium catalyst such as [1,1-<br>
bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]pa)ladium (II) chloride followed by cross coupling with a suitable boronic anhydride such as trialkytboroxine under an inert atmosphere, in the presence of a mild base such as sodium carbonate and a suitabie inert solvent such as dioxane and water at elevated temperatures up to 120Â°C. Alternatively, compounds of formula (II) wherein one or more of R\ R2, R3, R4 and R5 are bromo or iodo, and R6 is protected with a suitable protecting group such as benzyl, may undergo nucleophllic substitution reactions. For example, nitrite compounds may be formed upon treatment of such a halo compound of formula (II) in a polar solvent such as N,N-dirrsethylacetamide with a cyanide source such as copper cyanide at temperatures up to 150Â°C for 3 days to give the corresponding compound of formula (II) wherein one or more of R1 R2 R3, R4 and R5 are cyano, and R6 is protected with a suitable protecting group such as benzyl. Nitrite compounds of formula (II) may also be formed from the corresponding halo compound of formula (II) upon treatment with a cyanide source such as sodium cyanide in the presence of a suitable transmetallating agent such as nickel bromide in a polar solvent such as N-methylpyrrolidinone and healing in a 150 W microwave at up to 150Â°C for 5 min. Nitrile compounds of formula (II) may also be formed from the corresponding halo compound of formula (II) from the reaction of a suitable cyanide source such as potassium hexacyanoferrate, a transmetallating agent such as copper iodide, a salt such as potassium iodide, and a coordinating agent such as dimethylemylenediamine in a polar solvent such as N-methylpyrrolidinone under an inert atmosphere at elevated temperatures up to 140Â°C for up to 60 hours.<br><br><br>
Compounds of formula (II) may be prepared from compounds of formula (Ill) by standard dehydration<br>
conditions, optionally R8 may be a suitable protecting group e.g. benzyl, or substituted benzyl.<br>
 (Formula Removed)<br>
Thus, dehydration may be effected under acidic conditions. For example compounds of formula (Hi) may be treated with an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric add (4 - 6N) or concentrated sulphuric add, for up to 72 h, optionally in an organic miscible solvent such as acetonitrlle, optionally at elevated temperatures up to 60DC. Alternatively, dehydration may result from heating compounds of formula (III) at reflux wfth an organic acid such as trifluoroacetie acid or p-toluenesulphonic acid in an aprotic solvent such as toluene. Othen/vlse, compounds of formula (111) may be dehydrated using Eaton's reagent, typicaity stirring at room temperature for several hours neat or in a polar solvent such as methanol. Dehydration may also be effected by treating a compound of formula (III) with thionyi chloride in a poiar solvent such as acetonitrlle.<br>
Compounds of formula (III) may be used to directly access compounds of formula (I) upon treatment with Pearlman's catalyst In a suitable protic solvent such as methanol under a hydrogen atmosphere, in cases wherein Ra is a benzylic protecting group a deprotected compound of formula (I) will be obtained wherein Rs is hydrogen. Alternatively, compounds of formula (HI) wherein R8 is a protecting group such as benzyl may be deprotected, dehydrated and reduced simultaneously by hydrogenation under acidic conditions. For example, upon treatment of compounds of formula (III) with a hydrogen source such as ammonium formate in the presence of an acid such as formic acid and 10% palladium on carbon, optionally for up to 72 h, compounds of formula (I) wherein R8 is hydrogen are obtained.<br>

As an alternative the compounds may be administered to a non-human animal with the feedstuff and for this purpose a concentrated feed additive or premix may be prepared for miwng wflh the normal animal feed.<br>
All the aforementioned aqueous dispersions or emulsions or spraying mixtures can be applied, for example, to crops by any suitable means, chiefly by spraying, at rates which are generally of the order of about 100 to about 1,200 liters of spraying mixture per hectare, but may be higher or lower (eg. low or ultra-low volume) depending upon the need OT application technique. The compounds or compositions according to the invention are conveniently applied to vegetation and in particular to roots or leaves having pests to be eliminated. Another method of application of the compounds or compositfons according to the Invention is by chemigation, that is to say, the addition of a formulation containing the active ingredient to irrigation water. This irrigation may be sprinkler irrigation for foliar pesticides or it can be ground irrigation or underground irrigation for soil or for systemic pesticides.<br>
The concentrated suspensions, which can for example be applied by spraying, are prepared so as to produce a stable fluid product which does not settle (fine grinding) and usually contain from about 10 to about 75% by weight of active ingredient, from about 0.5 to about 30% of surface-active agents, from about 0.1 to about 10% of thixotropic agents, from about 0 to about 30% of suitable additives, such as anti-foaming agents, corrosion inhibitors, stabilizers, penetrating agents, adhesfves and, as the carrier,<br><br>
water or an organic liquid In which the active ingredient is poorly soluble or Insoluble. Some organic solids<br>
or inorganic salts may be dissolved in the carrier to help prevent settling or as antifreezes for water.<br>
The wettable powers (or powder for spraying) are usually prepared so that they contain from about 10 to about 80% by weight of active ingredient, from about 20 to about 90% of a solid carrier, from about 0 to about 5% of a wetting agent, from about 3 to about 10% of a dispersing agent and, when necessary, from about 0 to about 80% of one or more stabifizers and/or other additives, such as penetrating agents, adhesives, anti-caking agents, colorants, or the like. To obtain these wettable powders, the active ingredients) is(are) thoroughly mixed an a suitable blender with additional substances which may be impregnated on the porous flfter and is(are) ground using a mill or other suitable grinder. This produces wettable powders, the wettability and the suspendability of which are advantageous. They may be suspended in water to give any desired concentration and this suspension can be employed very advantageously in particular for application to plant foliage.<br>
The "water di'spersible granules (WG)' (granules which are readily dispersible in water} have compositions which are substantially close to that of the wettable powders. They may be prepared by granulation of formulations described for the wettable powders, either by a wet route (contacting finely divided active ingredient with the inert filler and a little water, ag. 1 to 20% by weight, or with an aqueous solution of a dispersing agent or binder, folfowed by drying and screening}, or by a dry route (compacting followed by grinding and screening).<br>
Depending on the method of application or the nature of the composition or use thereof, the rates and concentrations of the formulated composiSons may vary according. Generally spealdng, the compositions for application to control arthropod, plant nematode, helminth or protozoan pests usually contain from about 0.00001 % to about 95%, more particularly from about 0.0005% to about 50% by weight of one or more compounds of formula (I), or pesticidally acceptable salts thereof, or of total active ingredients (that is to say the compound of formula (I), or a pesticidally acceptable salt thereof, together with: other substances toxic to arthropods or plant nematodes, anthelmintics, anticocddiafs, synergists, trace elements or stabilizers). The actual compositions employed and their rate of application will be selected to achieve the desired effects) by the farmer, livestock producer, medical or veterinary practitioner, pest control operator or other person skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be combined with soluble macromotecular entities, such as cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containihg polymers, in order to improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste-masking, bioavailability and/or stability for use in any of the aforementioned modes of administration.<br>
Drug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are found to be generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion complexes maybe used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, i.e. as a carrier, diluent, or solubiliser. Most commonly used for these purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-<br><br>
cyclodextrins, examples of which may be found in International Patent Applications Nos. WO 91/11172,<br>
WO 94702518 and WO 98/55148.<br>

The biological activity of the compounds was tested using one or more of the test methods outlined below.<br>
In vitro tick assay<br>
Application of octopamine agonists to acarids for example, ticks, causes distinct behavioural changes compared to untreated control ticks. Treated ticks become agitated and move constantly, this prevents ticks attaching and feeding on a host animal to which the compound has been applied. Normal behaviour of ticks is to go into stasis whBn all other external stimuli are removed. Agitation and movement can be measured in vitro in the laboratory to predict efficacy and potency in vivo.<br>
The assay was run using unfed Rhipioephalus sanguineus (brown dog tick) and preooated glass vials with an inner surface area of 34.5cm2. Each compound was tested in duplicate.<br>
Compound (345Âµg) was dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (500ul) and delivered to each vial. The vials were placed on a tilting roller In a fume hood for 2 hours to allow the isopropyl alcohol to evaporate giving a compound concentration for each vial of 10Âµg/cma. Five R.sanguineus (male and female) were added to each coated vial and the vial sealed with a firm wad of cotton wool. Vials were then kept, undisturbed, on the bench at room temperature. Observation and recordings of activity were taken at 24, 48 and 72 hours after addition of ticks to the vials. The ED100 value was determined as the lowest dose at which all five ticks were seen moving around inside the vial.<br><br>
Octopamine activity<br>
One skilled in the art could determine agonist activity of compounds against insect octopamine receptors expressed in CHO cells by adapting the methods described in B. Maguetra, H. Chatwin, P. D. Evans, J. Neurochemistry, 2005, 94,2,547. Compound activity can be measured as an increase in cAMP by various methods known to a skilled person and can be recorded as %Vrnax (Vmax=maximal octopamine response) and EC50.<br>
Adrenergic activity<br>
Methods from literature procedures were simply adapted, as could be readily performed by one skilled In the art, in order to determine cc2 adrenergic activity of the compounds. Suitable procedures Include those described in J J. Meana, F. Barturen, J. A. Garcia-Sevffla, Journal of Neurochemistry, 1989,1210; and D. J. Loftus, J. M. Stolk, D. C. U'Pritchard, Life Sciences, 1984,35,610.<br>
