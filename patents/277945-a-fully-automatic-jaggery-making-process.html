BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SCHEMATIC DRAWINGS:-<br>
Fig.1. Schematic showing the process in the present invention<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:-<br>
As shown in the accompanying figure 1, the present invention relates to a fully automatic Jaggery making process wherein the Sugar Cane is fed to the cane carrier connected to cane conveyor which continuously feeds the cane to the cane crusher (01) to continuously extract the sugar juice and separate Bagasse on the other end. The juice is passed through the primary filter (02) comprising of filter mesh to remove coarse Bagasse particles. The juice after preliminary filtration is preheated to temperature of 70 to 90 °C in preheater (03) of any of suitable construction such as shell &amp; tube heat exchanger, plate heat exchanger or pipe in pipe heat exchanger in<br>
 <br>
a continuous manner. The preheated juice is then passed through secondary filter (17) of suitable design such as rotary vacuum drum filter. The measured quantity of clarificant such as Bhindi powder or guar gum or lime or sodium carbonate etc is added with the help of continuous metering pump to the preheated juice to agglomerate the fine Bagasse particles. The mixing of clarificant with the juice is ensured by efficient mixing system (18). The juice is then continuously clarified in a clarifier (04) of suitable design such as rotary vacuum drum filter or any suitable continuous clarifier to remove agglomerated Bagasse particles from the sugarcane juice. The Clarified juice is passed through a secondary pre-heater (19) of suitable design such as pipe in pipe or shell &amp; tube heat exhcnage ror plate heat exchanger to make up for the temperature drop that might have occurred during clarification processes. It is then boiled to concentrate in super efficient multistage evaporators (05). The concentrate from evaporator which has brix typically in the range of 50 to 70% is collected in a intermediate concentrate storage tank f06) and it is further concentrated to 80-90° brix in continuous and automatic mode in secondary concentrator (07). Lastly, the Jaggery Syrup is molded or flaked in a cooling equipment (08) to produce solidified Jaggery of desired shape and size. The water evaporated during concentration of sugarcane juice is recovered in condensate tank (10) after condensation in the evaporation stages and condenser (09). This water is substantial in quantity and can be made available for irrigation. It can also be treated further to make it potable. It can also be treated further and used as distilled water for high end applications such as battery refill water etc. Therefore, the process in the present invention is water conserving. The raw water tank (12) is used for washing, start up of plant and supplies water to boiler (14) after treatment through softner (11). Deaerator (13) removes the dissolved oxygen from boiler feed water. The bagasse from cane crusher (01) is fed to the boiler (14) with the help of fuel feeding system (15) and the ash from boiler is conveyed by ash handling system (16).  The  boiler supplies  steam  to Clarifier (04),  multistage evaporator (05), intermediate concentrate storage tank (06) and secondary concentrator (07).<br>
As example of the present invention, the table below gives the numbers for jaggery plant of 73 ton per day (TPD) sugarcane crushing capacity.<br>

b.	Wiped Film Evaporator<br>
The wiped film evaporator comprises of a jacketed stirred vessel on inside walls of which the jaggery syrup is allowed to flow. The outside walls of the vessel are in contact with the heating medium (Steam / Hot Water / Thermic Fluid). The thin film is formed as the jaggery syrup flows on inside wall of the vessel. The thin film is continuously wiped by the rotating scraper facilitating heat transfer across the film. The heat is supplied to the film by the fluid in the jacket. The water evaporated as a result of this heat exchange is collected and removed from the vapor space at the top in the same vessel.<br>
c.	Up-flow Wiped Film Evaporator<br>
This comprises of a jacketed cylindrical vessel having concentric central pipe with longitudinal blades held in position by leaf springs. The suitable ehat medium such as steam, hot water or thermal oil is supplied to the jacket. The feed is supplied to the cylindrical vessel from bottom. It flows upwards through the annular space between the concentric central pipe and the cylindrical vessel. The central pipe is rotated by a motorized shaft at one end and it is supported on the other end. As the central pipe rotates, the longitudinal blades which are held in close contact with the inner surface of cylindrical vessel, scrap the film formed at the surface. The vessel has a top vapor space where the vapor liquid separation takes place. The concentrate is collected as a overflow from the vessel. The feed rate to the evaporator is continuously monitored by brix meter / TDS meter installed on the<br>
 <br>
