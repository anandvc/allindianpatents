BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A number of strategies have been proposed for identifying and retrieving<br>
multimedia data objects stored in a database. At the heart of each of these strategies<br>
is a search problem, where a query point is compared to a set of multidimensional<br>
(MD) objects in the database. For example, a sample of a song having multiple<br>
characteristics (dimensions) may be compared to a number of songs stored in a<br>
database to find a song or songs having the same or similar characteristics. As a<br>
result of the search, either one or more matches are found, or no match exists in the<br>
set of objects in the database. These search problems are usually framed as some<br>
form of high dimensional search, where data and query points are mapped into the<br>
same high dimensional feature space." For a particular query point, a match is found<br>
by finding a data point in the feature space which is close enough to the query point<br>
to be considered a match. More specifically, these approximate matching problems<br>
are usually framed as epsilon distance queries using some Lp metric, such that the<br>
epsilon used is significantly less than the average interpoint distance.<br>
Traditional query processing strategies for solving such problems (e.g. nearest neighbor, epsilon range searching), suffer poor performance due to intrinsic difficulties associated with high dimensionality. These traditional query processing strategies become even more problematic when different matching distances are used for different data points, which turns out to be a very important case for<br><br><br>
complex high dimensional searches, such as audio fingerprinting and the like. As a result, the most straightforward approach towards solving such problems, linear scan, has typically outperformed more sophisticated approaches. Unfortunately, while simple linear scanning typically achieves better performance with respect to complex high dimensional searches than more complex query processing strategies, linear scanning is a very time intensive process.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Described herein are various systems and methods that facilitate rapid searching of MD data objects in an MD feature space. In accordance with one embodiment, prior to searching, each dimension in the MD feature space is divided into a number of intervals. When a query point is received, a single interval that overlaps the query point is selected from each dimension. A reduced set of MD data objects is then selected that includes only those MD data objects that overlap the selected intervals. This reduced set of MD data objects, rather than the entire set of MD data objects in the feature space, is then used to determine matches for the query point, thereby greatly increasing the efficiency of the search process.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
In general, the systems and methods described herein relate to, or may be used in conjunction with, searching a plurality of multidimensional (MD) data objects to determine which one or ones of the MD data objects overlap a given query point. In accordance with various embodiments, MD data objects are represented as hyper-rectangles in a feature space. If the MD data objects to be searched are not hyper-rectangles, the MD data objects are first mapped to hyper-rectangles in a feature space. To facilitate rapid searching of the hyper-rectangles,<br>
each dimension in the feature space is first divided into a number of predetermined intervals. A bit vector index is then created for each interval in each dimension. Each bit vector index indicates whether each of the hyper-rectangles in the feature space does or does not overlap the interval associated with the bit vector.<br>
When a query point is received, a single interval that overlaps the query point is selected from each dimension. The bit vector indices associated with each of the selected intervals are then logically ANDed together to form a single result bit vector index. The result bit vector index identifies a reduced set of hyper-rectangles within the feature space. This reduced set of hyper-rectangles, or MD data objects approximated by the hyper-rectangles in the reduced set, may then be quickly searched using a linear scan to determine a match or matches for the query point.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 1, illustrated therein is one embodiment of an exemplary data mapping and searching system 100. As shown, the searching system 100 includes a data store 102, a mapping module 104, a search module 106, a shape approximater module 108, and an MD feature space 110. Included in the data store 102 are a number of data items 112 (Di through Dn). Coupled to the MD feature space 110 are a number of MD data objects of a first type 114 (S) through Sn) and a number of MD data objects of a second type 116 (R1 through Rn).<br>
In accordance with one implementation, the MD feature space 110 is a type that is used for mapping, manipulating, storing, and/or accessing MD data points or objects in a computing system or computing process. In accordance with this<br>
implementation, MD data points in the MD feature space 110 are vectors of values. These vectors have length equal to the number of dimensions in the MD feature space. The precise form and meaning of each index in these vectors may vary, depending on the form of the MD feature space. In accordance with this implementation, the MD data objects 114 and 116 are sets of MD data points. The MD data objects 114 and 115 may be defined as functions or algorithms that determine whether an MD data point is a member of the set of data points defined by the MD object. As used herein, an MD data object is said to be "coupled to" an MD feature space when the underlying function or algorithm that defines the MD object manipulates vectors whose type corresponds to the MD feature space.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that MD data points and objects may be described or defined in terms of geometry. In accordance with this geometric definition, MD data point vectors are considered coordinates in a high-dimensional space. MD data objects are sets of MD data points, hence may be considered to be shapes or regions in this high-dimensional space. As such, MD data points or objects are referred to herein as being "in" or "within" or "coupled to" an MD feature space. An MD feature space is said to "include" an MD data point or object.<br>
With respecting to searching in the MD feature space 112, an MD data point that is subject to search is referred to herein as a query point. An MD data object is said to overlap a query point if the query point is a member of the set of MD data points that make up the MD data object. This set membership can be determined by applying the underlying function or algorithm of the MD object to the query point.<br>
Further, an MD data object is said to match the query point if the MD data object is likely to overlap the query point. Matching is therefore an approximation to overlap. The phrase "searching a feature space" is used herein to describe performing matching and overlap operations of MD data points and objects that are coupled to the MD feature space.<br>
In general, the search module 106 is operable to determine which of the data items 112 in the data store 102 matches a given query point 122. However, as explained in detail below, the search module 106 does not search the data items 112 in data store 102 directly. Rather, the data items 112 are first mapped to MD data objects in the feature space 110 by the mapping module 104. The search module 106 then evaluates the query point and the MD data objects in the feature space 110 to determine which MD data objects match the query point 122.<br>
In accordance with one implementation, the mapping module 104 maps the data items 112 directly to MD data objects of a second type 116. It is then with respect to the MD data objects of the second type 116 that the search module 106 conducts the search. In accordance with another implementation, the mapping module 104 maps the data items 112 to MD data objects of the first type 114. In this embodiment, the shape approximater module 108 then converts or maps the MD data objects of the first type 114 to MD data objects of the second type 116. The search module 106 then conducts the search with respect to the MD data objects of the second type 116 and/or the MD data objects of the first type 114.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment, the data store 102 is composed of or includes computer-readable media. For example, and without limitation, in accordance with one implementation, the data store 102 is a database having data objects stored on a computer-readable media, such as magnetic or optical media. As used herein, computer-readable media may be any available media that can store and/or embody data and/or computer executable instructions, and that may be accessed by a computing system or computing process. Computer-readable media may include, without limitation, both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media, and modulated data signals. The term "modulated data signal" refers to a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal.<br>
In accordance with one implementation, each of the data items 112 in the data store 102 is a data sample or file. For example, and without limitation, in accordance with one implementation, each of the data items 112 is a media sample or file, such as an audio or video sample or file. In accordance with other implementations, the data items 112 may be other types of samples or files.<br>
In general, the mapping module 104 is operable to map data items 112 in the data store to MD data objects in the feature space 108. As previously noted, the data items 112 may be mapped either as MD data objects of the first type 114 or as MD data objects of a second type 116. However, as described in greater detail below, the mapping module 104 will typically map data items 112 to MD data objects of the first type 114.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are many different types (shapes) and sizes of MD data objects. Two common types of MD data objects are hyper-spheres and hyper-rectangles. Other types of MD data objects are, without limitation, hyper-ellipsoids orpolytopes.<br>
As explained in greater detail below, in accordance with various embodiments described herein, the MD data objects of a first type 114 are hyper-spheres and the MD data objects of a second type 116 are hyper-rectangles. As such, for simplicity, the MD data objects of the first type 114 will be referred to herein as hyper-spheres and the MD data objects of the second type 116 will be referred to herein as hyper-rectangles. However, it should be understood that the various methods and systems described herein may be equally applicable where the MD data objects of the first type are other varieties of MD data objects.<br>
A hyper-rectangle may be defined as a set of all points in an MD feature space such that each point has a value in each dimension in the feature space, the value lying between a minimum and a maximum value per dimension. A hyper-sphere may be defined as a set of all points in an MD feature space such that each point has Euclidean distance to a fixed point less than or equal to a threshold. The fixed point is known as the center of the hyper-sphere.<br>
Turning to Fig. 2, illustrated therein is a generalized exemplary representation of the feature space 110 including a number of hyper-rectangles 214-222. To simplify presentation, a 2-dimensional feature space including 2-dimensional hyper-rectangles is shown. However, it should be understood that the<br>
feature space 110, and the hyper-rectangles included therein, may have any positive number of dimensions.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the feature space 110 has a first dimension (diml) 210 and a second dimension (dim2) 212. As previously noted, each dimension in a feature space 110 can attain a range of possible values. This range of possible values is shown along each dimension. While only positive integer values are shown along the dimensions 210 and 212 in Fig. 2, it will be appreciated that each dimension may also include negative values and floating point values. Likewise, it should be appreciated that while only hyper-rectangles having positive integer value ranges are shown in Fig. 2, hyper-rectangles that have value ranges that extend into negative values, hyper-rectangles having only negative value ranges, or hyper-rectangles having floating point value ranges are also possible.<br>
A number of different conventions may be used in specifying the size and location of the hyper-rectangles in a feature space 110. FIG 2 illustrates one exemplary convention that may be used in specifying the size and location of the hyper-rectangles in the feature space 110. In particular, each hyper-rectangle in the feature space 110 includes an identifier (Rl, R2, . . . , etc.) and two coordinate pairs. As shown, the first coordinate pair identifies the location of the lower left corner of the hyper-rectangle and the second coordinate pair indicates the upper right corner of the hyper-rectangle with respect to the feature space 110. For example, the lower left most hyper-rectangle 214 in the feature space is designated as Rl {1,1} - {4,2}. In this example, Rl indicates the hyper-rectangle identifier,<br>
{1,1} indicates the lower left corner of the hyper-rectangle 214, and {4,2} indicates the upper right comer of the hyper-rectangle 214. As will be appreciated, the ranges of the attributes of the hyper-rectangles Rl through R5 along dimensions one and two may be determined from these ordered pairs.<br>
Returning now to Fig. 1, in accordance with one implementation, the search module 106, the mapping module 104, and the shape approximate! module 108 are each composed of, or include, computer executable instructions. In accordance with one implementation these computer executable instructions axe stored or embodied in one or more types of computer-readable media and are executed by one or more computing processes or devices, such as shown and described below with respect to Fig. 7.<br>
It should be understood that while the search module 106, the mapping module 104, and the shape approximater module 108 are described herein as comprising or including computer executable instructions embodied in computer-readable media, the search module 106, the mapping module 104, the shape approximater module 108, and any or all of the functions or operations performed thereby, may likewise be embodied all or in part as interconnected machine logic circuits or circuit modules within a computing device. Stated another way, it is contemplated that the search module 106, the mapping module 104, the shape approximater module 108, and their operations and functions, may be implemented as hardware, software, firmware, or various combinations of hardware, software, and/or firmware.<br>
In general, as previously described, the shape approximater module 108 is operable to map or convert hyper-spheres 114 to hyper-rectangles 116 in the feature space 110. The manner in which this mapping is accomplished by the shape approximater module 108 may vary, based on the type of hyper-sphere 114 that is being mapped or converted. For example, and without limitation, in accordance with one implementation, each hyper-sphere 114 is mapped to a hyper-rectangle 116 having a size that completely encloses the hyper-sphere 114. For example, a hyper-sphere 114 may be mapped to a hyper-rectangle 116 having dimensions such that if the hyper-sphere 114 were positioned in the center of the hyper-rectangle 116, the hyper-sphere 114 would be completely contained within the hyper-rectangle 116. As such, it will be appreciated that the overall size or volume of a hyper-rectangle will be dependent on the overall size or volume of the hyper-sphere from which it is mapped.<br>
In one implementation, each hyper-rectangle 116 will be the smallest possible hyper-rectangle that would completely enclose the hyper-sphere 114 from which it is mapped. In other implementations, if false negative search results are permissible, each hyper-rectangle 116 may be the smaller than the smallest possible hyper-rectangle that would completely enclose the hyper-sphere 114 from which it is mapped.<br>
It should be understood, that while the hyper-rectangles 116 have been described as being mapped from hyper-spheres in the feature space 110 using the shape approximater module 108, in accordance with other embodiments, the hyper-<br>
rectangles 116 in the feature space may be created in, or mapped to, the feature space 110 using other modules or systems or mapping techniques.<br>
In general, the search module 106 performs searches of the feature space 110 to identify hyper-rectangles that overlap a given query point 122. Given that a hyper-rectangle is an MD data object, the definition of overlapping and matching a hyper-rectangle is described, above. In accordance with one implementation, the search module 106 performs the operations illustrated in FIGS. 3, 4, 5, and/or 6, as will now be described.<br>
Turning first to Fig. 3, illustrated therein is an exemplary operational flow including operations 300 that may be performed by the search module prior to searching the feature space 110. In accordance with one implementation, the operations 300 are performed once the feature space 110 has been populated with hyper-rectangles 116. As described in greater detail below, the operations 300 create a set of bit vector indices that are used during the search process. The operations 300 may be performed at various times. Typically, however, the operations 300 will not be performed before each search operation. Rather, the operations 300 will typically be performed when a large number of hyper-rectangles 116 have been added or removed from the feature space 110. For example, the operations 300 may only be performed after a given number of modifications have taken place with respect to the bit vector indices.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, at the start of the operational flow 300, a partition operation 310 partitions each dimension in the feature space 110 into a number of<br><br>
disjoint intervals. For example, as shown in Fig. 2, both dimensions 210 and 212 have both been partitioned into three disjoint intervals. As shown, dimension one 210 has been partitioned into interval one, which encompasses all values in dimension one 210 below the value 4; interval two 226, which encompasses all values in dimension one between values 4 and 8; and interval three 228, which encompasses all values in dimension one above value 8. While not specifically shown, dimension two, and any other dimensions in the feature space 110, would be partitioned in a similar manner.<br>
The precise manner in which the starting and ending points of the intervals are determined may vary, and may be dependent on such things as hyper-rectangle distribution and/or hyper-rectangle size. For example, and without limitation, in accordance with one implementation, when m intervals are desired, m — 1 divisions or interval dividers are selected between the intervals. For example, as shown in Fig. 2, three intervals require the selection of two interval dividers (3 - 1 — 2). In accordance with this implementation, the first and last interval in each dimension will be unbounded on one side. For example, as shown in Fig. 2, interval one 210 is bounded on one side by value 4, but remains unbounded at its other side. Similarly, interval two 212 is bounded on one side by value 8, but remains unbounded at its other side.<br>
In accordance with one implementation, the position of each interval divider is selected such that it falls either at the beginning or end (boundary) of a value range of one of the hyper-rectangles in the feature space. For example, as shown in<br>
Fig. 2, the divider 230 between interval one 224 and interval two 226 occurs at the end of the value range of Rl 214 along dimension one 210. Similarly, the divider 232 between interval two 225 and interval three 228 occurs at the end of the value range of R2 216 along dimension one 210.<br>
In accordance with one implementation, the locations of the interval dividers are determined as follows. Assuming |S| equals the number of hyper-rectangles in the feature space, m is the desired number of intervals, a/b is used to represent division of b into a with integer truncation, a%b represents the remainder of the division a/b, andk=(2*|S|)%m.<br>
Equation(l)   FirstIDsj=j*[(2*|S|)/m] +j	1=j
Equation (2) RemaminglDsj = j*[(2*|S|)/m] + k k+1=j
Using Equations (1) with respect to the feature space and hyper-rectangles shown in FIG. 2, it can be seen that k=(2*5)%3=l. Therefore FirstlDSi = l*[(2*5)/3] + 1= 4. The first division is then at the 4th rectangle boundary (where the boundaries are sorted in increasing order). Using Equations (2) with respect to<br>
the feature space and hyper-rectangles shown in FIG. 2, it can be seen that RemainingIDs2 = 2*[(2*5)/3] + 1=7. Therefore, the second division is at the 7th rectangle boundary. Since the 4th and 7th boundaries are at 4 and 8 respectively, this is where the dividers are located. In accordance with one embodiment, a restricted set of rectangle boundaries is used based upon prior knowledge of query point distributions. This restricted set of boundaries would then be used in a manner identical to what has been described.<br>
Following the partitioning operation 310, a bit vector indices construction operation then constructs a bit vector index corresponding to each interval in each dimension. In particular, for each interval, a bit vector index is created that specifies whether or not each of the hyper-rectangles 116 in the feature space 110 overlaps the interval. A hyper-rectangle 116 may be said to overlap an interval in a dimension if all or a part of its value range lies within the value range specified by the interval. For example, with respect to Fig. 2, each of hyper-rectangles Rl 214, R4 220, and R5 222 overlaps interval one 224; each of hyper-rectangles R2 216, R4 220, and R5 222 overlaps interval two 226; and each of hyper-rectangles R3 218 and R5 222 overlaps interval three 224.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment, each bit vector index includes the same number of bits as there are hyper-rectangles in the feature space. Furthermore, each bit in the bit vector index is associated with a single one of the hyper-rectangles in the feature space. In accordance with another embodiment, bit vectors may include a greater number of bits than hyper-rectangles. For example, in one embodiment,<br>
when a hyper-rectangle is removed from the feature space, its associated bit may simply be set to "0", rather than being removed from the bit vector index.<br>
Each bit in a bit vector index indicates whether or not the hyper-rectangle to which it is associated overlaps the interval associated with the bit vector index. For example, a bit having a value of "1" might indicate that its associated hyper-rectangle overlaps the interval associated with the bit vector index, and a bit having a value of "0" might indicate that its associated hyper-rectangle does not overlap the interval associated with the bit vector index. For example, with respect to Fig. 2, a first bit vector index associated with Interval one 224 includes five bits and may be written as [1 0 0 1 1], where the first bit (1) indicates that Rl overlaps interval one, the second bit (0) indicates that R2 does not overlap interval one, the third bit (0) indicates that R3 does not overlap interval one, the fourth bit (1) indicates that R4 overlaps interval one, and the fifth bit (1) indicates that R5 overlaps interval one. Using this convention, the bit vector index associated with interval two 226 is [0101 1], and the bit vector index associated with interval three 228 is [0 0 1 0 1].<br>
Turning now to Fig. 4, illustrated therein is a detailed exemplary operational flow 400 including operations that may be used for constructing bit vector indices for the feature space 110. It will be appreciated that the operational flow 400 is operable to handle the construction of bit vector indices for any number of dimensions in the feature space 110 and any number of dimension intervals.<br>
As shown, at the start of the operation flow 400, a dimension set operation 410 sets or initializes a dimension variable (dim) to a value of 1. Following the<br>
dimension set operation 410, a partition dimension operation 412 partitions the dimension "dimension(dim)" into intervals, as described above. As will be appreciated, since the dimension variable dim is currently set to 1, the partition dimension operation 412 will partition the first dimension of the given feature space. Following the partition dimension operation 412, a set interval operation 414 sets or initializes an interval variable intvl to a value of 1. Next, a set hyper-rectangle operation 416 sets or initializes a hyper-rectangle variable rect to a value •ofl.Following the set hyper-rectangle operation 416, a set bit operation 418 determines if the hyper-rectangle specified by the hyper-rectangle variable rect overlaps the interval specified by the interval variable intvl, in the dimension specified by the dimension variable dim. If it is determined that the specified hyper-rectangle overlaps the specified interval in the specified dimension, the set bit operation 418 sets a bit associated with the specified hyper-rectangle in a bit vector index associated with the specified interval in the specified dimension to 1. If, however, it is determined that the specified hyper-rectangle does not overlap the specified interval in the specified dimension, the set bit operation 418 sets a bit associated with the specified hyper-rectangle in a bit vector index associated with the specified interval in the specified dimension to 0.<br>
Next, an increment hyper-rectangle operation 420 increments the hyper-rectangle variable rect. A rectangle number determination operation 422 then determines if the hyper-rectangle variable rect is equal to the number of hyper-<br>
rectangles in the feature space plus 1. If the hyper-rectangle variable rect is not equal to the number of hyper-rectangles in the feature space, the operational flow 400 returns to the set bit operation 418. However, if the hyper-rectangle variable rect is equal to the number of hyper-rectangles in the feature space plus 1, the operational flow 400 proceeds to an increment interval operation 424, where the interval variable intvl is incremented.<br>
Following the increment interval operation 424, an interval determination operation 426 determines if the interval variable intvl equals the number of intervals in the dimension specified by dimension variable dim plus 1. If the interval variable intvl does not equal the number of intervals in the dimension specified by dimension variable dim plus 1, the operational flow returns to the set hyper-rectangle operation 416. However, if the interval variable intvl does equal the number of intervals in the dimension specified by dimension variable dim plus 1, the operational flow proceeds to an increment dimension operation 428, where the dimension variable dim is incremented.<br>
Following the increment dimension operation 428, a dimension determination operation 430 determines if the dimension variable dim equals the number of dimensions in the feature space plus 1. If the dimension variable dim does not equal the number of dimensions in the feature space plus 1, the operational flow 400 returns to the partition dimension operation 412. However, if the dimension variable dim does equal the number of dimensions in the feature space plus 1, the operational flow 400 ends.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 5, illustrated therein is an exemplary operational flow 500 that may be used in searching the feature space 110. More particularly, the operational flow 500 may be used in searching the feature space 110 after bit vector indices have been created for each of the intervals in the feature space 110, either in accordance with the operational flows 300 and/or 400, as described above, or by some other operations. As shown, at the beginning of the operational flow 500, a receive query operation 514 receives a query item. Next, a map query operation 515 maps that query item into a query point in the MD feature space.<br>
Following the map query operation 515, and interval selection operation 516 selects an interval from each dimension that overlaps the query point. An interval in a dimension may be said to overlap a query point if the value of the query point in the dimension lies within the value range specified by the interval. Next, an ANDing operation 518 logically ANDs all of the bit vector indices corresponding to the intervals selected in the interval selection operation 516. This logical ANDing of the bit vector indices produces a single result bit vector index that specifies a set of hyper-rectangles that match the received query point. As will be appreciated, the set of hyper-rectangles specified by the result bit vector index will in most cases be significantly smaller than the set of all hyper-rectangles within the feature space 110.<br>
Following the ANDing operation 518, a matching operation 520 compares the received query point to each of the hyper-rectangles indexed by Is in the result bit vector index to determine which of these hyper-rectangles overlap the received<br>
query point. In the case where each of the hyper-rectangles is mapped from an associated MD data object, rather than comparing the received query point to each of the hyper-rectangles specified by the result bit vector index, the received query point may be compared directly to the MD data object associated with the hyper-rectangles indexed by 1 s in the result bit vector index.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 6, illustrated therein is another, more detailed exemplary operational flow 600 including operations that may be used for searching a feature space 110. As with the operational flow, the operational flow 600 may be carried out after bit vector indices have been created for each of the intervals in the feature space 110, whether in accordance with the operational flows 300 and/or 400, as described above, or by some other operations. As shown, at the beginning of the operational flow 600, a receive query operation 610 receives a query point. After a query point has been received, a set dimension operation 612 sets a dimension variable dim equal to 1. Next, a determine interval operation 614 determines an interval in the dimension specified by the dimension variable dim that includes the query point. Stated another way, interval operation 614 determines an interval in the dimension specified by the dimension variable dim that overlaps the query point. A select bit vector index operation 616 then selects the bit vector index corresponding to the interval determined in determine interval operation 614.<br>
Following the select bit vector index operation 616, a dimension determination operation 618 determines if the dimension variable dim is equal to 1. If the dimension dim is equal to 1, a set result bit vector index operation 620 sets<br>
the result bit vector index equal to the bit vector index selected in the select bit vector index operation 616, and the operational flow proceeds to a dimension variable increment operation 624. However, if the dimension determination operation 618 determines that the dimension variable dim is not equal to 1, the operational flow 600 proceeds to an ANDing operation 622, where the bit vector index selected in the select bit vector index operation 616 is logically ANDed with, or into, the result bit vector. Next, the dimension variable increment operation 624 increments the dimension variable dim.<br>
Following the dimension variable increment operation 624, a dimension determination operation 626 determines if the dimension variable dim equals the number of dimensions in the feature space. If the dimension variable dim does not equal the number of dimensions in the feature space, the operational flow 600 returns to the determined interval operation 614. However, if the dimension variable dim does equal the number of dimensions in the feature space, the operational flow proceeds to a find hyper-rectangle operation 628, where the hyper-rectangles corresponding to each "1" in the result bit vector are found. Next, a compare data object operation 630 compares the received query point to all of the MD data objects associated with the hyper-rectangles found by the fine hyper-rectangle operation 628. A return data object operation 630 then returns all MD data objects that match the received query point, and the operational flow 600 ends.<br>
