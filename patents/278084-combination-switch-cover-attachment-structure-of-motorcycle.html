[Technical Field to Which the Invention Belongs]<br>
The   present  invention   relates   to   a   combination   switch   cover attachment structure of a motorcycle. [0002] [RelatedArt]<br>
As a combination switch cover attachment structure of a motorcycle, there has been known one which covers a periphery of a combination switch with a cover (for example, see patent document l). [0003]<br>
[Patent Document l]<br>
Published Utility Model Application Sho 57 (1982)-42146 (Page 1, Fig. 2) [0004]<br>
Fig. 2 of patent document 1 will be described below with reference to Fig. 9.    Note that reference numerals are allotted again.<br>
Fig. 9 is a cross-sectional view showing a conventional combination switch cover attachment structure of a motorcycle.     In  Fig.  9,  a part attachment seat 412 is attached to a top bridge 411 which connects both sides of an upper portion of a front fork with each other.    A combination switch 413 is attached to the part attachment seat 412.   A periphery of the combination switch 413 is covered with a cover 416 which is fixed by hooking . a claw 415 on a hole 414 provided in the part attachment seat 412.    Note that reference numeral 417 is a handle pipe and reference numeral 418 is a meter. [0005] [Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The foregoing cover 416 is hooked on the hole 414 of the part attachment seat 412 by use of the claw 415.    Thus, the cover may be detached by external forces.    Therefore, there is scope for improvement in measures to prevent tampering with the combination switch 413. [0006]<br>
Moreover, in the periphery of the combination switch 413, the part attachment seat 412 and the cover 416 appear to be a cover having a two-part split structure. Thus, for example, if these part attachment seat 412 and cover 416 are set to be a cover, as a single-piece component, in the periphery of the combination switch 413, external appearance can be improved more. [0007]<br>
Accordingly,  an object of the present invention is to improve a combination switch cover attachment structure of a motorcycle, whereby enhancing   effects   of   tampering   prevention   and   improving   external appearance. [0008] [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In   order   to   realize   the   aforementioned   object,    Claim    1   is characterized in that in a motorcycle, in which a combination switch is<br>
 <br>
provided in a front portion of a top bridge connecting both left and right sides of an upper portion of a front fork and a periphery of the combination switch is covered with a switch cover, the switch cover is formed to have a shape of a cup with a bottom which has an opening in its lower portion; an attachment portion at the switch cover side in a cover attachment stay for attaching the switch cover to the top bridge is fastened to the switch cover from therebelow at a position above an edge of the opening; and an attachment portion at the top bridge side in the cover attachment stay is provided below the attachment portion at the switch cover side and is fastened to a front face of the top bridge from the front. [0009]<br>
The attachment portion at the switch cover side in the cover attachment stay is fastened at the position above the edge of the opening. Furthermore, fastening directions of the attachment portion at the switch cover side and the attachment portion at the top bridge side are different from each other. Thus, it is difficult to detach the switch cover and effects of tampering prevention can be improved. [0010]<br>
Moreover, by use of the switch cover, that is a single-piece component, the periphery of the combination switch is simplified. Furthermore, the attachment portion at the switch cover side and the attachment portion at the top bridge side are not visible from the above. Thus, the external appearance can be improved. [0011]<br>
Claim 2 is characterized in that a meter is provided in front of the combination switch.<br>
The meter makes it possible to prevent tampering from the front with the combination switch. [0012]<br>
Claim 3 is characterized in that cable guide members for guiding cables are integrally provided in the cover attachment stay.<br>
The integration of the cover attachment stay and the cable guide makes it possible to reduce the number of components as well as the number of assembly steps. [0013] [Embodiments of the Invention]<br>

As described above, in the present invention, fastening directions of the screws 246 and 247 are different from each other.    Thus, it is made difficult to detach the switch cover 43. [0024]<br>
Assembly of the switch cover 43 is performed in the following manner. Specifically, after the combination switch 42 is attached to the top bridge 41, the cover attachment stay 122 is attached to the front face 224 of the top bridge 41 by use of the screws 246 and 246. Next, the switch cover 43 is attached to the cover attachment stay 122 by use of the screws 247 and 247. [0025]<br>
Fig. 4 is a perspective view showing the vehicle body front portion according to the present invention. In Fig. 4, the combination switch 42 and the switch cover 43 which covers the periphery of the combination switch 42 are disposed in front of the top bridge 41 to which the handle 23 is attached. Moreover, the meter 27 is disposed in front of the switch cover 43 and both sides of the vehicle body front portion including the switch cover 43 are surrounded by the front cowls 78 and 78. [0026]<br>
The switch cover 43 is formed of a single piece component. Thus, the periphery of the combination switch 42 is simplified. Moreover, an attachment portion of the top bridge 41 and the cover attachment stay 122 and an attachment portion of the switch cover 43 and the cover attachment stay 122 are not visible from the above. Thus, external appearance can be improved. Furthermore, the switch cover 43 is surrounded by the meter 27 in its front and by the front cowls 78 and 78 from its both sides.    Thus, it is<br>
possible to prevent tampering of detaching the switch cover 43.<br>
Here, reference numeral 251 is a clutch lever and reference numeral 252 is a brake lever. [0027]<br>
Fig. 5 is a perspective view showing a state of attaching the switching cover according to the present invention. Fig. 5 shows the switch cover 43 which covers the upper portion of the combination switch 42.<br>
The switch cover 43 includes: a front hanging portion 255 provided in its front; a slope portion 256 formed to taper upward from the front hanging portion 255; and an upper flat portion 257 in which the above-described cylinder portion insertion hole 242 is made open. [0028]<br>
Fig. 6 is a perspective view showing a state of attaching the cover attachment stay according to the present invention. Fig. 6 shows a state where the switch cover 43 (see Fig. 5) is detached from the state of Fig. 5.<br>
The cover attachment stay 122 includes a stay main body 261 formed by bending a flat plate. The stay main body 261 is a component in which vertical portions 262 and 263 provided on both left and right sides of the stay main body 261 and a curved portion 264 are integrally formed, the curved portion 264 being curved forward so as to avoid the cylinder portion 228 in order to connect the vertical portions 262 and 263 with each other. The vertical portions 262 and 263 are attached to the top bridge 41 and the switch cover 43 is attached to the curved portion 264. Note that, here, omitted is a cable guide member of the cover attachment stay 122, which will be entirely shown in Fig. 8. [0029]<br>
Fig. 7 is a perspective view showing a state of attaching the combination switch and the switch cover according to the present invention. In Fig. 7, a tampering prevention bar 266 disposed under the bolts 233 and 233 is attached to lower ends of the vertical portions 262 and 263 of the stay main body 261. [0030]<br>
For example, even if it is attempted to loosen the bolts 233 and 233 in order to detach the combination switch 42 from the top bridge 41, the tampering prevention bar 266 covers an area under the bolts 233 and 233. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent tools from being fitted to the bolts 233<br>
 <br>
and 233 from under the combination switch 43.    Thus, tampering can be<br>
prevented.<br>
[0031]<br>
Fig. 8 is a perspective view showing the entire cover attachment stay according to the present invention. Fig. 8 shows a state where the cover attachment stay 122 is viewed from the same direction as that of Fig. 7.<br>
