				<td>Intraocular Lens Delivery System with Temperature Control<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a device for delivering an intraocular lens<br>
into an eye and more particularly to a temperature-controlled intraocular lens<br>
delivery device.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The human eye functions to provide vision by transmitting light through a<br>
clear outer portion called the cornea, and focusing the image by way of a<br>
crystalline lens onto a retina. The quality of the focused image depends on many<br>
factors including the size and shape of the eye, and the transparency of the<br>
cornea and the lens.<br>
When age or disease causes the lens to become less transparent, vision<br>
deteriorates because of the diminished light which can be transmitted to the<br>
retina. This deficiency in the lens of the eye is medically known as a cataract.<br>
An accepted treatment for this condition is surgical removal of the lens and<br>
replacement of the lens function by an artificial intraocular lens (IOL).<br>
In the United States, the majority of cataractous lenses are removed by a<br>
surgical technique called phacoemulsification. During this procedure, an opening<br>
is made in the anterior capsule and a thin phacoemulsification cutting tip is<br>
inserted into the diseased lens and vibrated ultrasonically. The vibrating cutting<br>
tip liquifies or emulsifies the lens so that the lens may be aspirated out of the eye.<br>
The diseased lens, once removed, is replaced by an artificial lens.<br><br><br>
The IOL is injected into the eye through the same small incision used to<br>
remove the diseased lens. The IOL is placed in an IOL injector in a folded state.<br>
The tip of the IOL injector is inserted into the incision, and the lens is delivered<br>
into the eye.<br>
Many lOLs manufactured today are made from a polymer with specific<br>
characteristics. These characteristics allow the lens to be folded, and when<br>
delivered into the eye, allow the lens to unfold into the proper shape. The<br>
polymers used to make these lenses have characteristics that are temperature-<br>
dependant. Heating the polymer allows the IOL to be compressed more easily,<br>
thus allowing it to fit through a smaller incision. A smaller incision is desirable<br>
because it promotes faster healing and is less traumatic for the patient.<br>
The temperature characteristics of the polymers used to make lOLs can<br>
impact the lens implantation process significantly. For some polymers, a change<br>
in hardness or viscosity occurs over a relatively narrow range. For example, at<br>
colder temperatures, the polymer may become brittle and break if folded. At<br>
higher temperatures, the polymer may become gooey and lose its shape<br>
retaining ability. Therefore, it is desirable to maintain the polymer in a specific<br>
temperature range so that the IOL can maintain its integrity.<br>
In practice, some surgeons have manually heated lOLs using the outside<br>
of autoclaves or warmers designed to warm baby wipes. Such warming is<br>
uncontrolled. As noted, the polymers used to manufacture artificial lenses are<br>
sensitive to temperature, and more precise temperature control can achieve<br>
desired results.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for a temperate-controlled intraocular lens<br>
injection device.<br><br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Reference is now made in detail to the exemplary embodiments of the<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used throughout the<br>
drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br><br><br>
Figure 1 is a top cross section view of a cartridge and hand piece that<br>
collectively function as an intraocular lens injector. In the embodiment pictured in<br>
Figure 1, a two piece IOL injector system includes hand piece 100 and cartridge<br>
150. In hand piece 100, injector body 125 houses a shaft 105 connected to a<br>
plunger 110. Shaft 105 is typically rigid and is connected to plunger 110 such<br>
that movement of shaft 105 translates into movement of plunger 110. In this<br>
manner, plunger 110 is designed to reciprocate within injector body 125. Two<br>
tabs, such as tab 115 are located on one end of hand piece 100. Area 120 is<br>
adapted to receive cartridge 150.<br>
Cartridge 150 includes two tabs, such as tab 165, a nozzle 160, and a<br>
chamber 155. Chamber 155 holds an IOL. Nozzle 160 is hollow and is designed<br>
to allow an IOL to pass through it and into an eye. The interior of cartridge 150<br>
contains a continuous passage that includes chamber 155 and nozzle 160. An<br>
IOL located in chamber 155 can be transferred out of cartridge through nozzle<br>
160.<br>
Figure 2 shows how cartridge 150 and hand piece 100 fit together. As<br>
depicted in the embodiment shown in Figure 2, cartridge 150 is located in area<br>
120. Plunger 110 is designed to reciprocate within injector body 125 and<br>
chamber 155. Shaft 105 and plunger 110 are generally constrained to move<br>
back and forth in a direction that is parallel to body 125. The tabs on cartridge<br>
150, such as tab 165, are designed to fit under the tabs on hand piece 100, such<br>
as tab 115. In this position, cartridge 150 is secured to hand piece 100.<br>
In operation, shaft 105 is moved thus causing plunger 110 to move. To<br>
insert cartridge 150, shaft 105 and plunger 110 are drawn back so that plunger<br>
110 is located outside of area 120. Area 120 receives cartridge 150, and plunger<br><br><br>
110 is advanced into cartridge 150. In particular, plunger 110 is designed to<br>
enter chamber 155 and contact the IOL contained in chamber 155. When<br>
plunger 110 is advanced further, is pushes the IOL out of chamber 155 through<br>
nozzle 160. Nozzle 160 is inserted into an incision made in the cornea thus<br>
allowing the IOL to be delivered into the eye.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show a side cross section view of the cartridge 150 and<br>
hand piece 100 depicted in Figures 1 and 2. In this embodiment, cartridge 150<br>
fits into hand piece 100 as shown. In Figure 4, plunger 110 is in chamber 155 of<br>
cartridge 150.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 depict exploded cross section views (both top and side) of<br>
a cartridge with a heater according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The location of heater 505 is shown by the dashed lines. In the embodiment of<br>
Figures 5 and 6, heater 505 is located above and below chamber 155. This<br>
allows heater 505 to heat the IOL contained in chamber 155. In addition, heater<br>
505 extends to nozzle 160, allowing heat to be transferred to the IOL while the<br>
IOL is in the nozzle 160. Heater 505 may also be located such that it surrounds<br>
chamber 155 or such that it is only on one side of chamber 155.<br>
Heater 505 is typically a resistive type heater. In one embodiment, heater<br>
505 is a continuous wire with a resistance through which a current is passed. In<br>
other embodiments, heater 505 contains resistive elements connected in series<br>
through which a current is passed. The amount of current passed through heater<br>
505 and the resistive characteristics of heater 505 are selected to provide the<br>
proper amount of heat for heating an IOL contained in chamber 155.<br>
Electrical connections (not shown) provide current to heater 505. These<br>
connections typically provide current to heater 505 from a power source, such as<br><br><br>
a battery. In addition, a control line (not shown) provides signals that control the<br>
operation of heater 505. In this embodiment, a controller (not shown) receives<br>
temperature information from heater 505 and provides signals that control the<br>
operation of heater 505.<br>
Heater 505 may be located on the outer surface of cartridge 150, the inner<br>
surface of cartridge 150, or embedded in cartridge 150. Typically, cartridge 150<br>
is made from a polymeric material. Heater 505 may be embedded in the<br>
polymeric material.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 depict exploded cross section views (both top and side) of<br>
a hand piece with a heater according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The location of heater 705 is shown by the dashed lines. In this embodiment,<br>
heater 705 is located below plunger 110. In this manner, cartridge 150 fits in<br>
hand piece 100 above heater 705. Heater 705 heats cartridge 150 and the IOL<br>
that it contains. Like heater 505, heater 705 is a resistive type heater.<br>
Heater 705 may be located on the outer surface of hand piece 100, the<br>
inner surface of hand piece 100, or embedded in hand piece 100. When hand<br>
piece 100 is made of a polymeric material, heater 705 may be embedded in the<br>
polymeric material. When hand piece 100 is made of a metallic material, heater<br>
705 may be located on one of its surfaces.<br>
Electrical connections (not shown) provide current to heater 705. These<br>
connections typically provide current to heater 705 from a power source, such as<br>
a battery. In addition, a control line (not shown) provides signals that control the<br>
operation of heater 705. In this embodiment, a controller (not shown) receives<br>
temperature information from heater 705 and provides signals that control the<br>
operation of heater 705.<br><br><br>
Figures 9 and 10 depict exploded cross section views (both top and side)<br>
of a hand piece with a heater according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The location of heater 905 is shown by the dashed lines. In this<br>
embodiment, the heater is located on the plunger 110. Heat from heater 905 is<br>
transferred to the IOL directly when the plunger 110 is inserted into chamber 155<br>
of cartridge 150. Like heaters 505 and 705, heater 905 is a resistive type heater.<br>
Heater 905 may be located on the outer surface of plungerl 10, the inner<br>
surface of plunger 110, or embedded in plunger 110. When plunger 110 is made<br>
of a polymeric material, heater 705 may be embedded in the polymeric material.<br>
Electrical connections (not shown) provide current to heater 905. These<br>
connections typically provide current to heater 905 from a power source, such as<br>
a battery. In addition, a control line (not shown) provides signals that control the<br>
operation of heater 905. In this embodiment, a controller (not shown) receives<br>
temperature information from heater 905 and provides signals that control the<br>
operation of heater 905.<br>
In one embodiment, only one of the above heater configurations is<br>
selected. In other words, if a heater is located in the cartridge, then it is not<br>
present in the hand piece. Likewise, if a heater is present in the hand piece, it is<br>
not present in the cartridge.<br>
In another embodiment, two heaters may be used. For example, a heater<br>
may be present on the plunger 110 as well as on the injector body 125. This<br>
allows heat to be transferred to the IOL indirectly through the cartridge (in the<br>
case of the heater located on the injector body 125) as well as directly (in the<br>
case of the heater located on the plunger 110). Numerous other similar<br>
configurations are within the scope of the present invention.<br><br><br>
The operation of heaters 505, 705, and 905 is similar. Each of these<br>
heaters produces heat when current is passed through them. Typically, a<br>
controller controls the amount of current and timing of the current applied to the<br>
heaters. When actuated, the heaters are designed to maintain the IOL within a<br>
desired temperature range.<br>
Figures 11 and 12 depict top and side cross section views of an IOL<br>
injector into which a heater may be incorporated. In the embodiment of Figure<br>
11, an IOL delivery system 1100 includes a plunger 1105 located on one end of a<br>
shaft 1110. Shaft 1110 is typically rigid and is connected to plunger 1105 such<br>
that movement of shaft 1110 translates into movement of plunger 1105. In this<br>
manner, plunger 1105 is designed to reciprocate within injector body 125.<br>
Guides 1120, 1122 ensure that plunger 1105 moves back and forth in a direction<br>
parallel to housing 1115. Housing 1115 contains plunger 1105 and shaft 1110.<br>
Nozzle portion 1130 is located on one end of IOL delivery system 1100.<br>
Hollow interior 1125 is located in nozzle portion 1130 and is designed to hold an<br>
IOL. A continuous passage extends from guides 1120, 1122 through hollow<br>
interior 1125 and out of nozzle portion 1130 at its distal end. An IOL contained in<br>
hollow interior 1125 adjacent to guides 1120, 1122 can pass out of the distal or<br>
tip end of nozzle portion 1130 and into an eye.<br>
In operation, shaft 1110 is moved thus causing plunger 1105 to move.<br>
Shaft 1110 and plunger 1105 are generally constrained to move back and forth in<br>
a direction that is parallel to and within housing 1115. An IOL is located in hollow<br>
interior 1125 adjacent to guides 1120, 1122. Plunger 1105 is designed to engage<br>
the IOL and push the IOL through hollow interior 1125, out of the distal or tip end<br>
of nozzle portion 1130 and into an eye. The distal or tip end of nozzle portion<br><br><br>
1130 in inserted into an incision made in the cornea. The IOL is delivered into<br>
the eye through this incision.<br>
Figures 13 and 14 show top and side cross section views of an intraocular<br>
lens injector with two different heater locations according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. In Figures 13 and 14, heater 1305 is located on the<br>
plunger, and heater 1310 is located on the nozzle portion. The location of<br>
heaters 1305, 1310 is shown by the solid lines. In the embodiment of Figures 13<br>
and 14, heater 1305 is located on the plunger, and heater 1310 is located above<br>
and below the hollow interior 1125 of the nozzle portion 1130. In other<br>
embodiments, heater 1310 surrounds hollow interior 1125 or is located on one<br>
side of it.<br>
When heater 1305 is located on plunger 1105, heat is transferred to the<br>
IOL when plunger 1105 makes contact with the IOL. When heater 1310 is<br>
located on nozzle portion 1130 and surrounds hollow interior 1125, heat is<br>
transferred to the IOL as it resides in hollow interior 1125.<br>
Heaters 1305, 1310 are typically resistive type heaters. In one<br>
embodiment, heaters 1305, 1310 each comprise a continuous wire with a<br>
resistance through which a current is passed. In other embodiments, heaters<br>
1305,1310 each contain resistive elements connected in series through which a<br>
current is passed. The amount of current passed through heaters 1305, 1310<br>
and the resistive characteristics of heaters 1305, 1310 are selected to provide the<br>
proper amount of heat for heating an IOL.<br>
Electrical connections (not shown) provide current to heaters 1305, 1310.<br>
These connections typically provide current to heaters 1305, 1310 from a power<br>
source, such as a battery. In addition, a control line (not shown) provides signals<br><br><br>
that control the operation of heaters 1305, 1310. In this embodiment, a controller<br>
(not shown) receives temperature information from heaters 1305, 1310 and<br>
provides signals that control the operation of heaters 1305, 1310.<br>
Heater 1305 may be located on the outer surface of plunger 1105, the<br>
inner surface of plunger 1105, or embedded in plunger 1105. Typically, plunger<br>
1105 is made from a polymeric material. In such a case, heater 1105 may be<br>
embedded in the polymeric material. Likewise, heater 1310 may be located on<br>
the outer surface of nozzle portion 1130, the inner surface of nozzle portion 1130,<br>
or embedded in nozzle portion 1130. Typically, nozzle portion 1130 is made from<br>
a polymeric material. In such a case, nozzle portion 1130 may be embedded in<br>
the polymeric material.<br>
In one embodiment, only one of the above heater configurations is<br>
selected. In other words, if a heater is located in the plunger 1105, then it is not<br>
present in the nozzle portion 1130. Likewise, if a heater is present in the nozzle<br>
portion 1130, it is not present in the plunger 1105.<br>
In another embodiment, two heaters may be used. For example, a heater<br>
may be present on the plunger 1105 as well as on the nozzle portion 1130. This<br>
allows heat to be transferred to the IOL indirectly through nozzle portion 1130 (in<br>
the case of the heater located on the nozzle portion 1130) as well as directly (in<br>
the case of the heater located on the plunger 1105). Numerous other similar<br>
configurations are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The operation of heaters 1305 and 1310 is similar. Each of these heaters<br>
produces heat when current is passed through them. Typically, a controller<br>
controls the amount of current and timing of the current applied to the heaters.<br><br><br>
When actuated, the heaters are designed to maintain the IOL within a desired<br>
temperature range.<br>
As shown in the above embodiments, a heater can be located in close<br>
proximity to an IOL to heat the IOL so that it can be more easily delivered into the<br>
eye. Since lOLs are generally made or a polymeric material that is temperature<br>
sensitive, providing heat through an integral heater helps to keep the IOL at a<br>
temperature at which it can be more easily compressed while still maintaining its<br>
shape characteristics. Thus, a heater can be used to maintain the IOL within a<br>
desired temperature range so that the IOL can be more easily delivered into the<br>
eye.<br>
While the above embodiments detail the location and composition of the<br>
heater, the following embodiments describe the IOL delivery system more<br>
completely. Figure 15 is a block diagram of a portion of an intraocular lens<br>
injector system according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the<br>
embodiment of Figure 15, one part of the IOL delivery system includes a<br>
controller 1505, a motor, 1510, an input device 1515, and a power source 1520.<br>
Controller 1505 is connected to motor 1510 via interface 1530, to input device<br>
1515 via interface 1535, and to power source 1520 via interface 1525. Interface<br>
1540 connects controller 1505 to a heater (not shown).<br>
Controller 1505 is typically an integrated circuit capable of performing logic<br>
functions. In various embodiments, controller 1505 is a motor controller or a<br>
heater controller. In other embodiments, controller 1505 is a simple<br>
microprocessor. Controller 1505 is typically in the form of a standard IC package<br>
with power, input, and output pins.<br><br><br>
In the embodiment of Figure 15, controller 1505 is an integrated circuit<br>
capable of receiving an input from input device 1515 via interface 1535.<br>
Controller receives its power from power source 1520 via interface 1525.<br>
Controller 1505 may also receive information from a heater (not shown) via<br>
interface 1540. In this embodiment, controller 1505 has two control outputs.<br>
Controller 1505 sends control outputs to motor 1510 via interface 1530.<br>
Controller also sends control outputs to a heater (not shown) via interface 1540.<br>
Input device 1515 is typically a switch or a button that activates some part<br>
of the IOL delivery system. In one embodiment, input device 1515 is a switch<br>
that is activated to activate the heater.<br>
Power source 1520 provides power to controller 1505, motor 1510, and<br>
heater (not shown). In one embodiment, power source 1520 is a battery. In<br>
another embodiment, power source 1520 is a cable that directs power from a<br>
surgical console.<br>
Motor 1510 is designed to drive a plunger to inject the IOL into an eye. In<br>
one embodiment, motor 1510 is a stepper motor. Interfaces 1525, 1530, 1535,<br>
and 1540 can be any type of interface suitable. In one embodiment, these<br>
interfaces are wires. In other embodiments, these interfaces are capable of<br>
sending and receiving power and/or data.<br>
Figure 16 is a top cross section view of a battery-powered intraocular lens<br>
delivery system depicting two different heater locations according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The IOL delivery system 1600 of Figure 16<br>
joins the elements of Figures 13 and 14 with the elements of Figure 15. In Figure<br>
16, IOL delivery system 1600 includes battery 1605, controller 1505, input device<br>
1515, motor 1510, shaft 1110, housing 1115, guides 1120,1122, hollow interior<br><br><br>
1125, interfaces 1525, 1530, 1535, 1540, and heaters 1305, 1310. An indicator,<br>
such as an LED, (not shown) may also be present on housing 1115.<br>
Battery 1605 is located within housing 1115 at one end of IOL delivery<br>
system 1600. Battery 1605 provides power to controller through interface 1525.<br>
Battery 1605 also provides power to motor 1510 and one or both heaters 1305,<br>
1310. Input device 1515, when activated, provides a signal to controller 1505<br>
through interface 1535. Controller 1505 controls heater 1305, 1310 through<br>
signals sent over interface 1540. While interface 1540 is shown as connecting<br>
heater 1305 to controller 1505, it may connect heater 1310 to controller 1505.<br>
Controller 1505 controls the operation of motor 1510 through signals sent over<br>
interface 1530. Motor 1510 is connected to shaft 1110 and moves shaft 1110<br>
when activated. Shaft 1110 is connected to a plunger (not shown). Guides 1120,<br>
1122, located in housing 1115, constrain shaft 1110 and plunger (not shown) to<br>
move back and forth in a direction that is generally parallel to housing 1115.<br>
Hollow interior 1125 is located in the nozzle portion of the IOL delivery system<br>
1600. Two heater locations 1305,1310 are also depicted.<br>
While two heater locations are shown, either one or both of the heaters<br>
1305, 1310 may be present. In one embodiment, heater 1305 is present and<br>
heater 1310 is not. In such a case, heater 1305, located on the plunger, heats an<br>
IOL directly when it contacts or comes near the IOL. In another embodiment,<br>
heater 1310 is present and heater 1305 is not. In such a case, heater 1310 heats<br>
the IOL. In yet another embodiment, both heaters 1305 and 1310 are present. In<br>
this case, both heaters heat the IOL.<br>
In operation, controller 1505 receives an input from input device 1515. As<br>
noted, input device 1515 is typically a switch or button. In this example, the input<br><br><br>
received directs the controller 1505 to turn on a heater, such as heater 1305 or<br>
heater 1310, or both. Via interface 1540, controller 1505 switches the heater on<br>
so that it can heat the IOL. Controller 1505 also receives temperature<br>
information from heater 1305 and/or heater 1310 over interface 1540. Controller<br>
1505 controls heater 1305 and/or heater 1310 to maintain the IOL within a<br>
desired temperature range. An indicator, such as a light emitting diode, (not<br>
shown), illuminates to provide an indication that the IOL is in the desired<br>
temperature range. While the IOL is in the desired temperature range, controller<br>
activates motor 1510 to drive shaft 1110 and a plunger (co-located with heater<br>
1305) to deliver an IOL out of hollow interior 1125 and into the eye.<br>
Controller 1505 can utilize any number of different algorithms to control<br>
heater 1305 and/or heater 1310. In one embodiment consistent with the<br>
principles of the present invention, controller 1505 uses an on/off control<br>
algorithm to switch the heater on and off to maintain the IOL within a desired<br>
temperature range. In another embodiment, controller 1505 controls the amount<br>
of current applied to heater 1305 and/or heater 1310 to regulate its temperature.<br>
In this method, the heater is maintained in a temperature range to ensure that the<br>
IOL is maintained in a desired temperature range.<br>
In another embodiment, controller 1505 implements a proportional-<br>
integral-derivative controller ("PID controller"). A PID controller accepts a<br>
feedback signal from the heater and controls the heater by using the feedback<br>
signal. A PID controller can effectively maintain the heater at a desired set point.<br>
For example, if the set point is 35 or 40 degrees Celsius, then the PID controller<br>
maintains the heater at 35 or 40 degrees Celsius. The heater can be maintained<br>
at any set point by using a PID controller.<br><br><br>
The desired temperature range can be preset at the factory. Since the IOL<br>
delivery system is used to deliver lOLs made of the same polymeric material, a<br>
preset temperature range of a few degrees Celsius or less is appropriate for the<br>
desired temperature range. Typically, the polymeric material used to make lOLs<br>
has temperature dependent characteristics that are observable over relatively<br>
small temperature ranges of a few degrees Celsius. In such a case, a desired<br>
temperature range should be in the range of a few degrees Celsius or less.<br>
Controller 1505 can utilize any number of different algorithms to control<br>
motor 1510. In the case where motor 1510 is a stepper motor, controller 1505<br>
advances the motor's shaft incrementally, thus advancing the shaft 1110 and<br>
plunger incrementally. In one embodiment shaft 1110 is the shaft found on a<br>
stepper motor. In another embodiment, the shaft on a stepper motor is coupled<br>
to shaft 1110.<br>
The embodiment of Figure 17 is the same as that of Figure 16 except that<br>
power is provided to the IOL delivery system 1700 through a cable 1705. Cable<br>
1705 extends from the IOL delivery system 1700 to a surgical console (not<br>
shown). The surgical console typically contains a number of ports, such as ports<br>
that provide electric or pneumatic power. The console also contains a display<br>
that displays information about the operation of the system. In the embodiment<br>
shown in Figure 17, controller 1505 interfaces with cable 1705. Controller 1505<br>
may send information to and receive information from the console via cable 1705.<br>
In one embodiment, the console performs most, if not all, of the control functions.<br>
In such a case, controller 1505 may not be present. Instead, cable 1705 carries<br>
interfaces 1530, 1535, and 1540, receives input signals from input device 1515,<br>
and provides control signals to motor 1510 and heater 1305.<br><br><br>
In Figure 17, only one heater, heater 1305, is shown. Heater 1305 is<br>
located on the plunger and is designed to directly heat the IOL. Nozzle portion<br>
1130 is also visible.<br>
The embodiment of Figure 18 is the same as that of Figure 17 except that<br>
the heater 1310 is located on the nozzle portion 1130 and not on the plunger<br>
1105.<br>
In operation, IOL delivery system 1700 and IOL delivery system 1800 each<br>
receive their power via cable 1705. Both operate in a similar fashion. In one<br>
embodiment, controller 1505 of IOL delivery system 1700 receives an input signal<br>
from input device 1515. This input signal tells the controller to activate heater<br>
1305. Alternatively, when controller 1505 is not present and the control functions<br>
are handled by the surgical console, the input signal from input device 1515 is<br>
received by the console via cable 1705. Controller 1505, if present, or the<br>
console, if controller 1505 is not present, controls the operation of heater 1305 to<br>
maintain the IOL within a desired temperature range. While the IOL is in the<br>
desired temperature range, the surgeon inserts the tip end of nozzle portion 1130<br>
into a small incision in the cornea of the eye and activates the plunger to inject<br>
the IOL into the eye. Typically, the surgeon depresses a foot switch to actuate<br>
motor 1510. Motor 1510 drives shaft 1110 and plunger 1105 displacing the IOL<br>
out of hollow interior 1125, through the tip end of nozzle portion 1130, and into<br>
the eye.<br>
The foot switch is connected to the main surgical console. In this manner,<br>
the signal from the foot switch tells the console that the surgeon wishes to inject<br>
the IOL into the eye. The console either controls this operation directly by<br>
activating motor 1510 or it sends a signal to controller 1505, if present, and<br><br><br>
controller 1505 controls the operation of the motor. In this manner, if controller<br>
1505 is not present, then the main surgical console controls the operation the IOL<br>
delivery device 1700.<br>
The embodiment of Figure 19 is the same as that of Figure 16 except that<br>
spring 1905 and spring lock 1910 replace motor 1510. In this embodiment,<br>
spring 1905 provides the force to drive shaft 1110 and plunger 1105 to deliver the<br>
IOL into the eye. One end of spring 1905 is connected to housing 1115 or some<br>
structure (not shown) on the interior of housing 1115. Shaft lock 1910 acts to<br>
hold shaft 1110 in place. In this position, spring 1905 is under tension. When<br>
shaft lock 1910 is released, spring 1905 pushes shaft 1110 in a direction toward<br>
the end of nozzle portion 1130. This in turn pushes plunger 1105 and drives the<br>
IOL out of nozzle portion 1130 and into the eye.<br>
In one embodiment, shaft lock 1910 is controlled by controller 1505. In<br>
another embodiment, shaft lock 1910 is held in place by a mechanical coupling<br>
(not shown) that is released by button or switch (not shown). In such a case,<br>
controller 1505 may be a simple controller designed to operate heater 1305<br>
and/or heater 1310. In this case, the IOL delivery device 1900 may be<br>
disposable.<br>
In operation, disposable IOL delivery device 1900 is activated by activating<br>
input device 1515. Input device 1515 is typically a switch or a button that turns<br>
on heater 1305, heater 1310, or both heaters 1305 and 1310. The heater(s) get<br>
their power from battery 1605. Battery 1605 supplies current to the heater(s).<br>
After the heater(s) warm the IOL so that the IOL is within a desired temperature<br>
range, an indicator (not shown) such as an LED is illuminated. This lets the<br>
surgeon know that the IOL is ready to be injected. The surgeon then inserts the<br><br><br>
tip end of the nozzle portion 1130 (which is located at heater 1310) into an<br>
incision in the cornea and releases the shaft lock 1910. The shaft lock may be<br>
disabled or released by activating a mechanical shaft lock release (not shown).<br>
Such a shaft lock release may be in the form of a switch or button. Once the<br>
shaft lock is released, the spring pushes shaft 1110 and plunger 1105 (which is<br>
located at heater 1305) toward the tip end of nozzle portion 1130. Plunger 1105<br>
pushes the IOL out of interior cavity 1125, through the tip end of nozzle portion<br>
1130, and into the eye.<br>
Regardless of which embodiment is practiced, a safety feature may be<br>
added to the IOL delivery system. This safety feature allows the IOL to be<br>
inserted into the eye only when the IOL is within the desired temperature range.<br>
In such a case, the delivery of the IOL into the eye is prevented by a mechanical<br>
lock or by the controller (depending on the implementation) until the IOL reaches<br>
the desired temperature range. Such a safety scheme is easily implemented in<br>
the controller 1505 or the main surgical console.<br>
Figure 20 is a flow chart of one method of operation of an intraocular lens<br>
injector system according to an embodiment of the present invention. In 2010,<br>
the IOL is heated. In 2020, the IOL is maintained within a desired temperature<br>
range. In 2030, the IOL is delivered into the eye while it is in the desired<br>
temperature range.<br>
Figure 21 is a flow chart of another method of operation of an intraocular<br>
lens injector system according to an embodiment of the present invention. In<br>
2110 the heater is activated. In 2120, the IOL is heated. If the IOL has not<br>
reached the desired temperature range in 2130, then the delivery of the IOL is<br>
prevented in 2170 and the IOL continues to be heated in 2120. If the IOL has<br><br><br>
reached the desired temperature range in 2130, then in 2140, an indication is<br>
provided that the IOL is in the desired temperature range. This indication can be<br>
visual such as illuminating an LED. In 2150, the temperature of the IOL is<br>
maintained in the desired temperature range. In 2160, the IOL is delivered into<br>
the eye while it is in the desired temperature range.<br>
Figure 22 is a flow chart of another method of operation of an intraocular<br>
lens injector system according to an embodiment of the present invention. In<br>
2210, an input signal indicating that the heater should be activated is received. In<br>
2220, the heater is activated. In 2230, the IOL is heated. If the IOL has not<br>
reached the desired temperature range in 2240, then in 2250, feedback is<br>
provided to the controller and in 2230, the IOL continues to be heated. If the IOL<br>
has reached the desired temperature range in 2240, then in 2260, an indication is<br>
provided that the IOL is in the desired temperature range. In 2270, the<br>
temperature of the IOL is maintained in the desired temperature range. In 2280,<br>
a signal is sent to activate the plunger. In 2290, the IOL is delivered into the eye<br>
while it is in the desired temperature range.<br>
From the above, it may be appreciated that the present invention provides<br>
an improved system for delivering an intraocular lens into an eye. The present<br>
invention provides a temperature-controlled intraocular lens injection device that<br>
allows the lens to be heated to a desired temperature range thus improving its<br>
compressability. This allows the lens to be delivered through a smaller incision.<br>
