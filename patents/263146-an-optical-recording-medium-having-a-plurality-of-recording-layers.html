DESCRIPTION<br>
This application is divided out of Indian Patent Application<br>
No. 937 / KOLNP / 2005 filed on 19th May 2005.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an optical<br>
recording medium having a plurality of recording<br>
layers, on which recording and reading of information<br>
can be performed by irradiating a laser beam from one<br>
side thereof, such as DVD-R or the like, and a<br>
recording/reading method and a recording/reading<br>
apparatus for the optical recording medium.<br>
Background Art<br>
Various types of optical recording media such<br>
as CD-R, CD-RW, MO and so forth are widely recognized<br>
and spread as external storages for information<br>
processing apparatuses such as computers because they<br>
can store a large volume of information and can be<br>
randomly accessed easily. With an increase in<br>
quantity of handled information, there is a demand to<br>
increase the recording density.<br>
Among various optical recording media,<br>
optical recording media (optical disks) having a<br>
recording layer containing an organic dye (also<br><br>
referred to as a dye containing recording layer) such<br>
as CD-R, DVD-R, DVD+R and the like are particularly<br>
widely used because they are relatively inexpensive<br>
and have compatibility with read-only optical disks.<br>
Media such as CD-R representative of optical<br>
disks having the dye containing recording layer, for<br>
example, are in a laminated structure which has a dye<br>
containing recording layer and a reflective layer in'<br>
order on a transparent disk substrate along with a<br>
protective layer for covering the dye containing layer<br>
and the protective layer. Recording and reading are<br>
performed with a laser beam through the substrate.<br>
DVD-R, which is representative as well, has<br>
a laminated structure in which a dye containing<br>
recording layer, a reflective layer and a protective<br>
layer covering them are formed in this order on a first<br>
transparent disk substrate, and a so-called dummy disk,<br>
which is a second disk substrate (which may be<br>
transparent or opaque) and a reflective layer formed<br>
on the second disk substrate is formed on the<br>
protective layer through or not through an adhesive<br>
layer. Recording and reading are performed with a<br>
laser beam from one side of the disk through the first<br>
transparent disk substrate. The dummy disk may be of<br>
only a transparent or opaque disk substrate, or may<br>
be provided with a layer other than the reflective<br>
layer. Meanwhile, DVD+R has almost the same<br><br>
structure as DVD-R, description of which will be<br>
hereinafter represented by DVD-R.<br>
In order to largely increase the recording<br>
capacity of the optical recording medium, two<br>
single-sided DVD-Rs as above are bonded together to<br>
form a medium having two recording layers, which is<br>
known as a double-sided DVD-R (double-sided,<br>
dual-layer DVD-R). Recording and reading are<br>
performed by irradiating a laser beam onto each of the recording layers from the both sides (that is, the<br>
laser beam is irradiated from one side of the medium<br>
to perform recording and reading on a recording layer<br>
closer to this side, while the laser beam is irradiated<br>
from the other side of the medium to perform recording<br>
and reading on the other recording layer closer to the<br>
other side) .<br>
Other than the above, widely known is an<br>
optical recording medium (optical disk) having a<br>
phase-change recording layer such as CD-RW, DVD-RW or<br>
the like. A rewritable optical recording medium<br>
having a phase-change recording layer has generally<br>
protective layers on and under the recording layer.<br>
With respect to optical recording media<br>
having a plurality of recording layers, there is, in<br>
these years, a demand for a single-sided incident type<br>
optical recording medium (for example, single-sided<br>
incident type DVD-R) on which recording and reading<br><br>
can be performed on a plurality of recording layers<br>
by irradiating a laser beam from one side so as to avoid an increase in size and complexity of the<br>
recording/reading apparatus, and enable continuous<br>
reading from the plural recording layers.<br>
To meet the above demand, there has been<br>
proposed a single-sided incident type DVD-R of the<br>
dual-layer type having two recording layers, for<br>
example, as the single-sided incident type optical<br>
recording medium having the structure below (refer to<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. HEI<br>
11-66622, for example).<br>
For example, a single-sided incident type<br>
DVD-R of the dual layer type is formed by laminating,<br>
on a first light-transmissible substrate, a first<br>
recording layer made from an organic dye on which<br>
information can be optically recorded by irradiating<br>
a laser beam for recording, a first reflective layer<br>
made of a semi-light-transmissible reflective film<br>
that can pass through a part of the laser beam for<br>
reading, an intermediate layer that can pass through<br>
the laser beam for recording and the laser beam for<br>
reading, a second recording layer made from an organic<br>
dye on which information can be optically recorded by<br>
irradiating the laser beam for recording, a second<br>
reflective layer reflecting the laser beam for reading,<br>
and a second light-transmissible substrate in this<br><br>
order.<br>
In the single-sided incident type optical<br>
recording medium having a plurality of recording<br>
layers such as a dual-layer, single-sided incident<br>
type DVD-R or the like, the optimum recording/reading<br>
conditions such as recording pulse strategy<br>
(recording strategy, write strategy), recording<br>
power, reading power, etc. largely differ depending<br>
on each recording layer.<br>
For this, it is desirable that a<br>
recording/reading apparatus which performs recording<br>
or reading of information on each of the recording<br>
layers of a single-sided incident type optical<br>
recording medium having a plurality of recording<br>
layers can switch the recording/reading conditions<br>
such as recording pulse strategy, recording power,<br>
reading power, etc., for example, thereby to<br>
accurately and surely perform recording or reading of<br>
information.<br>
In order to allow the recording/reading<br>
apparatus to randomly access to each of the recording<br>
layers of the optical recoding medium to record or read<br>
information, it is necessary that the<br>
recording/reading conditions are instantaneously<br>
switched according to the recording layer, in<br>
particular.<br>
There is an idea that address information is<br><br>
continuously given to a plurality of recording layers,<br>
and the recording/reading apparatus determines which<br>
recording layer the relevant layer is on the basis of<br>
read address information, for example. However, such<br>
manner still has difficulty in instantaneously<br>
telling which recording layer the relevant recording<br>
layer is.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, description will be made of an<br>
optical recording medium (write-once optical<br>
recording medium) , a recording/reading method and a<br>
recording/reading apparatus for the optical<br>
recording medium according to an embodiment of this<br>
invention with reference to FIGS. 1 through 6.<br>
An optical recording medium according to this<br>
embodiment is a single-sided incident type optical<br>
recording medium having a plurality of recording<br>
layers, on which recording or reading of information<br>
can be performed by irradiating light (laser beam)<br>
from one side thereof.<br>
In this embodiment, description will be made,<br>
taking a dual-layer DVD-R (write-once optical<br>
recording medium) of a single-sided incident type<br>
having, for example, two recording layers as an<br>
example of the single-sided incident type optical<br>
recording medium (single-sided incident type DVD-R).<br>
(1) Structure of Optical Recording Medium<br>
First, description will be made of two types<br>
of optical recording media (optical disks) having<br>
different laminated structures as the optical<br><br>
recording media according to this embodiment.<br>
(A) Type 1<br>
FIG. 1 is a sectional view typically showing<br>
an optical recording medium (of type 1; single-sided<br>
incident type optical recording medium of the<br>
laminated type) according to this embodiment.<br>
The optical recording medium of the type 1<br>
according to this embodiment has a first recording<br>
layer (first recording layer, first dye' containing<br>
recording layer) 2 containing a dye, a semitransparent<br>
fist reflective layer (hereinafter referred to as a<br>
semitransparent reflective layer) 3, an intermediate<br>
resin layer (intermediate layer) 4, a second recording<br>
layer (second recording layer, second dye containing<br>
recording layer) 5 containing a dye, a second<br>
reflective layer 6, an adhesive layer 7 and a second<br>
substrate (second substrate) 8 in this order on a<br>
disk-shaped transparent (light-transmissible) first<br>
substrate (first substrate, first<br>
light-transmissible substrate) 1. Optical beams<br>
(laser beams) are irradiated from the side of the first<br>
substrate 1 to perform recording or reading.<br>
In this embodiment, "transparent<br>
(light-transmissible)" signifies "transparent<br>
(light-transmissible) to optical beams used for<br>
recording on or reading from the optical recording<br>
medium." Transparent (light-transmissible) layers<br><br>
include a layer which absorbs more or less the optical<br>
beams used for recording or reading. For example,<br>
when the layer has a transmittance of not less than<br>
50 percent, preferably not less than 60 percent to the<br>
wavelength of an optical beam used for recording or<br>
reading, the layer is considered to be practically<br>
light-transmissible (transparent).<br>
Concavities and convexities (lands and<br>
grooves) are formed on the transparent first substrate<br>
1 and the intermediate resin layer 4. Recording<br>
tracks are formed with a concave portion and/or a<br>
convex portion. Here, a recording track 11 on the<br>
transparent first substrate 1 is formed with a groove<br>
(portion) of the first substrate 1, that is, the<br>
convexity (portion) with respect to the direction of<br>
the incident light. A recording track 12 on the<br>
intermediate resin layer 4 is formed with a groove<br>
(portion) of the intermediate resin layer 4, that is,<br>
the convex portion with respect to the direction of<br>
the incident light. Incidentally, the recording<br>
tracks 11 and 12 may be formed with the concavities<br>
with respect to the direction of the incident light,<br>
or may be formed with both the concavity and convexity<br>
with respect to the direction of the incident light.<br>
Generally, it is preferable that the recording track<br>
is formed with a convex portion with respect to the<br>
direction of the incident light. In this invention,<br><br>
the concavity and convexity are defined with respect<br>
to the direction of incident light beams used for<br>
recording or reading unless not specifically<br>
mentioned.<br>
These recording tracks 11 and 12 are made<br>
slightly snake in the radial direction at<br>
predetermined amplitude and frequency (this called<br>
"wobble"). Isolated pits (address pits) are formed<br>
according to a certain rule on the land adjacent to<br>
the track 11 or the track 12, for example (this called<br>
"Land Pre-Pit"; LPP). Address information is<br>
beforehand recorded with the Land Pre-Pit. Such<br>
Pre-Pit may be formed for other information. It is<br>
also possible to reverse the direction of the wobble<br>
or modulate the frequency, thereby to record such<br>
information.<br>
Next, each of the layers will be described,<br>
(a) With Respect To First Substrate 1-<br>
It is desirable that the first substrate 1<br>
has excellent optical characteristics, that is, the<br>
first substrate 1 is transparent, has small<br>
birefringence, and so force. It is also desirable<br>
that the first substrate 1 has excellent molding<br>
properties, that is, the first substrate 1 can be<br>
readily formed in injection molding. When the first<br>
substrate 1 has small hygroscopicity, such property<br>
is desirable because the warping (tilt) of the<br><br>
.substrate can be decreased and the good mechanical<br>
characteristics can be achieved.<br>
Further, it is desirable that the first<br>
substrate 1 has shape stability so that the optical<br>
recording medium has some degree of rigidity. When<br>
the second substrate 8 has sufficient shape stability,<br>
the first substrate 1 is not required to have large<br>
shape stability.<br>
As such material, it is possible to use resins<br>
such as acrylic resins, methacrylic resins,<br>
polycarbonate resin, polyolefin resins (particularly,<br>
amorphous polyolefin) , polyester resins, polystyrene<br>
resin, epoxy resin, and so forth, and glass. The<br>
first substrate 1 may be comprised of a plurality of<br>
layers. It is possible to provide a resin layer made<br>
from a radiation-setting resin such as a UV curing<br>
resin or the like on the substrate made from glass,<br>
resin, or the like. Incidentally, "radiation" is a<br>
general term for light (ultraviolet radiation,<br>
visible radiation, infrared ray, etc.), electron<br>
beams, and the like.<br>
Meanwhile, polycarbonate is preferable from<br>
the viewpoint of optical properties, high<br>
productivity such as molding properties and the like,<br>
cost, low hygroscopicity, shape stability, etc. From<br>
the viewpoint of chemical resistance, low<br>
hygroscopicity and the like, amorphous polyolefin is<br><br>
preferable. From the viewpoint of high-speed<br>
responsibility and the like, a glass substrate is<br>
preferable.<br>
The first substrate 1 is preferably thin. It<br>
is preferable that the first substrate 1 has a<br>
thickness of 2 mm or less, more preferably 1 mm or less.<br>
The smaller the distance between the objective lens<br>
and the recording layer and the thinner the substrate,<br>
the smaller is coma aberration, which is advantageous<br>
to increase the recording density. To obtain<br>
sufficient optical properties, hygroscopicity,<br>
molding properties and shape stability, some degree<br>
of thickness is required. It is thus preferable that<br>
the thickness of the first substrate 1 is generally<br>
10 n m or more, more preferably 30/im or more.<br>
In order to well perform recording and<br>
reading on both of the first recording layer 2 and the<br>
second recording layer 5 in this optical recording<br>
medium, it is desirable to suitably adjust the<br>
distance between the objective lens and the both<br>
recording layers. For example, it is preferable to<br>
set the focus of the objective lens at an almost<br>
intermediate point between the both recording layers<br>
because accesses to the both layers become easy.<br>
More concretely, in DVD-ROM and DVD-R system,<br>
the distance between the objective lens and the<br>
recording layer is adjusted to be most suitable when<br><br>
the thickness of the substrate is 0.6 mm.<br>
When this layer structure is compatible with<br>
DVD-ROM, it is most preferable that the first<br>
substrate 1 has a thickness obtained by subtracting<br>
a half of the film thickness of the intermediate resin<br>
layer 4 from 0.6 mm. If so, the approximately<br>
intermediate point between the both layers is<br>
approximately 0 . 6 mm, thus the focusing servo control<br>
can be readily performed on the both recording layers.<br>
When another layer such as a buffer layer,<br>
a protective layer or the like exists between the<br>
second recording layer 5 and the first reflective<br>
layer 3, it is most preferable that the first substrate<br>
1 has a thickness obtained by subtracting a half of<br>
a sum of the thicknesses of that layer and the<br>
intermediate resin layer 4 from 0.6 mm.<br>
Concavities and convexities are formed<br>
spirally or concentrically on the first substrate 1<br>
to form grooves and lands. Generally, with such<br>
grooves and lands as being recording tracks,<br>
information is recorded on and read from the first<br>
recording layer 2. In the case of a so-called DVD-R<br>
disk on which recording and reading are performed by<br>
condensing a laser beam having a wavelength of 650 nm<br>
with an objective lens having a numerical aperture of<br>
0.6 to 0.65, the first recording layer 2 is generally<br>
formed in spin coating, so that the film of the first<br><br>
recording layer 2 is thick at the grooves, which is<br>
suitable for recording and reading.<br>
In this optical recording medium, it is<br>
preferable that the groove of the first substrate 1,<br>
that is, the convexity with respect to the direction<br>
of the incident light beam, is used as the recording<br>
track 11. Here, the concavity and the convexity are<br>
portions recessed and projecting in relation with the<br>
direction of the incident light beam. Generally, the<br>
width of the groove is about 50 to 500 nm, and the depth<br>
of the groove is about 10 to 250 nm. When the recording<br>
track is spiral, the track pitch is preferably about<br>
0.1 to 2.0 ix m. The first substrate 1 may have concave<br>
or convex pits such as Land Pre-Pit or the like as<br>
required.<br>
From the viewpoint of cost, it is preferable<br>
to manufacture the substrate having such concavities<br>
and convexities in injection molding from a stamper<br>
having concavities and convexities. When a resin<br>
layer made from a radiation-setting resin such as a<br>
UV curing resin or the like is formed on the substrate<br>
made from glass or the like, a concavity or a convexity<br>
such as a recording track or the like may be formed<br>
on the resin layer,<br>
(b) With Respect To First Recording Layer 2<br>
Generally, the sensitivity of the first<br>
recording layer 2 is almost equivalent to that of the<br><br>
recording layer used in a single-sided recording<br>
medium ("single-sided" means, for example, CD-R,<br>
DVD-R, DVD+R or the like).<br>
In order to realize a good recording/reading<br>
performance, it is preferable that the first recording<br>
layer 2 contains a low-exothermic dye having high<br>
refractive index.<br>
Further, a combination of the first recording<br>
layer 2 and the first reflective layer 3 is preferably<br>
within appropriate ranges of the reflection,<br>
transmission and absorption of light, whereby the<br>
recording sensitivity is improved and the thermal<br>
interference during recording is decreased.<br>
As such organic dye material, there are<br>
macrocyclic azaannulene type dyes (phtalocyanine dye,<br>
naphtalocyanine dye, porphyrin dye, etc.),<br>
pyrromethene type dyes, polymethine type dyes<br>
(cyanine dye, merocyanine dye, squalirium dye, etc.)<br>
anthoraquinone type dyes, azulenium type dyes, metal<br>
complex azo type dyes, metal complex indoaniline type<br>
dyes, etc.<br>
Among the above various organic dyes, metal<br>
complex azo type dyes are preferable because they have<br>
excellent recording sensitivity, durability and<br>
light resistance. Particularly, a compound<br>
represented by the following general formula ( I ) or<br>
(II) is preferable:<br><br><br>
(where rings A1 and A2 are nitrogen-containing<br>
aromatic heterocycles, each of which can<br>
independently have a substituent; rings B1 and B2 are<br>
aromatic rings, each of which can independently have<br>
a substituent; and X is an alkyl group having carbon<br>
number 1 to 6 substituted with at least two fluorine<br>
atoms).<br>
An organic dye used in the recording layer<br>
of this optical recording medium is preferably a dye<br>
compound having the maximum absorption wavelength X<br>
max within a range from the visible rays to the near<br>
infrared rays of approximately 350 to 900 nm, and<br>
suited to recording with a laser of blue to near<br>
microwave. More preferable is a dye suited to<br><br>
recording with a near infrared laser having a<br>
wavelength of about 770 to 830 nm (typically at 780<br>
nm, 830 nm, etc.) used generally for CD-R having a<br>
wavelength of about 620 to 690 nm, a red laser<br>
(typically at 635 nm, 650 nm, 680 nm, etc.) used for<br>
DVD-R, or a so-called blue laser having a wavelength<br>
of 410 nm or 515 nm.<br>
It is possible to use one kind of dye, or mix<br>
two or more the same or different kinds of dyes and<br>
use them. Further, it is possible to use together<br>
dyes suited for recording with a recording beam at a<br>
plurality of wavelengths to realize an optical<br>
recording medium coping with recording with a laser<br>
beam in a plurality of wavelength bands.<br>
The recording layer may contain a transition<br>
metal chelate compound (for example, acetylacetonato<br>
chelate, bisphenyldithiol, salicylaldehyde oxime,<br>
bisdithio-a-diketone or the like) as a singlet oxygen<br>
quencher in order to stabilize the recording layer or<br>
improve the light resistance, or a recording<br>
sensitivity improving agent such as a metal system<br>
compound or the like in order to improve the recording<br>
sensitivity. Here, the metal system compound is that<br>
a metal such as a transition metal or the like in the<br>
form of atom, ion, cluster or the like is contained<br>
in a compound. As such metal system compound, there<br>
are, for example, organometallic compounds such as<br><br>
ethylenediamine complexes, azomethine complexes,<br>
phenylhydroxyamine complexes, phenanthroline<br>
complexes, dihydroxyazobenzene complexes, dioxime<br>
complexes, nitrosoaminophenol complexes,<br>
phyridyltriazine complexes, acetylacetonato<br>
complexes, metallocene complexes, porphyrin<br>
complexes, and the like. There is no limitation with<br>
respect to the metal atom, but a transition metal is<br>
preferable.<br>
Further, a binder, a leveling agent, an<br>
antiforming agent and the like may be together used<br>
to make the recording layer of this optical recording<br>
medium as required. As a preferable binder, there are<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone,<br>
nitrocellulose,, cellulose acetate, ketone resins,<br>
acrylic resins, polystyrene resins, urethane resins,<br>
polyvinyl butyral, polycarbonate, polyolefin, etc.<br>
The film thickness of the recording layer is<br>
not specifically limited because the suited film<br>
thickness differs according to the recording method<br>
or the like. However, in order to obtain sufficient<br>
modulation amplitude, the film thickness is<br>
preferably 5 nm or more, more preferably 10 nm or more,<br>
and specifically preferably 20 nm or more, in general.<br>
However, the recording layer is required not to be<br>
excessively thick in order to appropriately pass<br>
through the light in this optical recording medium.<br><br>
Accordingly, the film thickness of the recording layer<br>
is generally 3 iz rn or less, preferably 1 p. m or less,<br>
and more preferably 200 nm or less. The film<br>
thickness of the recording layer differs from the<br>
groove to the land. In this optical recording medium,<br>
the film thickness of the recording■layer is at the<br>
groove of the substrate.<br>
As the method of making of the recording layer,<br>
there can be applied a thin film deposition generally<br>
performed such as vacuum evaporation, sputtering<br>
method, doctor blade method, cast method, spin coating,<br>
dipping method or the like. From the standpoint of<br>
productivity and cost, spin coating is preferable.<br>
Vacuum evaporation is more preferable than coating<br>
method because it can yield a recording layer having<br>
uniformity in the film thickness.<br>
In case that the recording layer is made by<br>
spin coated, the rotation speed is preferably 10 to<br>
15000 rmp. After the spin coating, a process of<br>
annealing or applying solvent vapor or the like may<br>
be performed.<br>
As a coating solvent used when the recording<br>
layer is formed in a coating method such as doctor<br>
blade method, cast method, spin coating, dipping<br>
method or the like, the type of solvent is not limited,<br>
thus any solvent can be used so long as it does not<br>
attack the substrate. For example, there are ketone<br><br>
alcohol type solvents such as diaceton alcohol,<br>
3-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-butanone and the like,<br>
cellosolve type solvents such as methyl cellosolve,<br>
ethyl cellosolve and the like, chain hydrocarbon type<br>
solvents suh as n-hexane, n-octane and the like, ring<br>
hydrocarbon type solvents such as cyclohexane,<br>
methylcyclohexane,	ethylcyclohexane,<br>
dimethylcyclohexane,	n-butylcyclohexane,<br>
tert-butylcyclohexane, cyclooctane and the like,<br>
perfluoroalkylalcohol type solvents such ' as<br>
tetrafluoropropanol,	octafluoropentanol,<br>
hexaf luorobuta-nol and the like, hydroxy carboxylic<br>
acid ester type solvents such as methyl lactate, ethyl<br>
lactate, methyl 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid and the like,<br>
etc .<br>
In the case of vacuum evaporation, organic<br>
dyes are put in a crucible disposed inside a vacuum<br>
chamber, along with dyes with -such as various<br>
additives and the like as required, for example, the<br>
inside of the vacuum chamber is evacuated to about.10"2<br>
to 10~5 Pa by an appropriate vacuum pump, after that,<br>
the crucible is heated to vaporize dyes and other<br>
additives, and the recording layer components are<br>
deposited on the substrate placed opposite to the<br>
crucible, whereby the recording layer is formed,<br>
(c) With Respect To First Reflective Layer 3<br>
The first reflective layer 3 is a reflective<br><br>
layer having some degree of light transmittance,.<br>
Namely, the first reflective layer 3 is a reflective<br>
layer which has small absorption (absorption of<br>
recording/reading beam) , a light transmittance of not<br>
less than 40 percent, and appropriate light<br>
reflectance (of not less than 30 percent, in general).<br>
For example, by providing a thin metal film having high<br>
reflectance, it is possible to give appropriate<br>
transmittance. It is desirable that the first<br>
reflective layer 3 have some degree of corrosion<br>
resistance. Further, it is desirable that the<br>
semitransparent reflective layer 3 has shutting-off<br>
properties so that the first recording layer 2 is not<br>
affected by seeping of the upper layer (here the<br>
intermediate resin layer 4) of the first reflective<br>
layer 3 .<br>
To secure high transmittance, the thickness<br>
of the first reflective layer 3 is preferably 50 nm<br>
or less, in general. The thickness of the first<br>
reflective layer 3 is more preferably 30 nm or less,<br>
and still more preferably 25 nm or less. However, the<br>
first reflective layer 3 is required to be thick to<br>
some degree in order to avoid an effect of the upper<br>
layer of the first reflective layer 3 on the first<br>
recording layer 2. Thus, the thickness of the first"<br>
reflective layer 3 is generally 3 nm or more, and more<br>
preferably 5 nm or more.<br><br>
As the material of the first reflective layer<br>
3, it is possible to use, in the pure metal or in the<br>
form of alloy, metals and semimetals such as Au, Al,<br>
Ag, Cu, Ti, Cr, Ni, Pt, Ta, Pd, Mg, Se, Hf, V, Nb, Ru,<br>
W, Mn, Re, Fe, Co, Rh, Ir, Zn, Cd, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Te,<br>
Pb, Po, Sn, Bi and rare earth metals, which have<br>
appropriately high reflectance at the wavelength of<br>
the reading beam. Among them, Au, Al and Ag have high<br>
reflectance, thus are suitable as the material of the<br>
first reflective layer 3. The semitransparent<br>
reflective layer 3 may contain other component other<br>
than the above as being the main component.<br>
A material containing Ag as the main<br>
component is particularly preferable because of its<br>
low cost and high reflectance. Here, the main<br>
component signifies a material contained not less than<br>
50 percent.<br>
Since the first reflective layer 3 has thin<br>
film thickness, large crystal grains of the film cause<br>
reading noise. Thus, it is preferable to use a<br>
material having small crystal grains. Since pure<br>
silver tends to have large crystal grains, it is<br>
preferable to use Ag as in the form of alloy.<br>
Particularly, it is preferable to contain Ag<br>
as the main component, and 0.1 to 15 atomic percent<br>
of at least one element selected from the group<br>
consisting of Ti, Zn, Cu, Pd, Au and rare earth metals.<br><br>
When two or more of Ti, Z.n, Cu, Pd, Au and rare earth<br>
metals are contained, each of these may be 0.1 to 15<br>
atomic percent. However, the sum of these is<br>
preferably 0.1 to 15 atomic percent.<br>
A particularly preferable alloy composition<br>
is one that contains Ag as the main component, 0.1 to<br>
15 atomic percent of at least one element selected from<br>
the group consisting of Ti, Zn, Cu, Pd and Au, and 0.1<br>
to 15 atomic percent of at least one rare earth element.<br>
Among the rare earth metals , neodymium is particularly<br>
preferable. In more concrete, AgPdCu, AgCuAu,<br>
AgCuAuNd, AgCuNd, etc. are preferable.<br>
As the first reflective layer 3, a layer made<br>
from only Au is preferable because it has small crystal<br>
grains and corrosion resistance, but it is more<br>
expensive than an Ag alloy.<br>
Alternatively, it is possible to use a layer<br>
made from Si as the first reflective layer 3.<br>
It is possible to stack, one after the other,<br>
a thin film having low reflectance and a thin film<br>
having high reflectance both made from materials other<br>
than metals to form multi-layers, and use them as the<br>
reflective layer.<br>
As a method for forming the first reflective<br>
layer 3, there can be applied, for example, sputtering,<br>
ion plating, chemical evaporation, vacuum<br>
evaporation, etc. It is possible to provide an<br><br>
inorganic or organic intermediate layer and an<br>
adhesive layer between the first substrate 1 and the<br>
first recording layer 3 in order to improve the<br>
reflectance, the recording performance and the<br>
adhesive properties. For example, it is possible<br>
that an intermediate layer (or an adhesive layer) , the<br>
first recording layer 2, and an intermediate layer (or<br>
an adhesive layer) and the first reflective layer 3<br>
are stacked in this order on the first substrate 1 to<br>
provide the intermediate layer (or the adhesive layer)<br>
between the first substrate 1 and the first recording<br>
layer 2, and to provide the intermediate layer (or the<br>
adhesive layer) between the first recording layer 2<br>
and the first reflective layer 3.<br>
(d) With Respect To Intermediate Resin Layer 4<br>
The intermediate resin layer 4 is required<br>
to be transparent, and to allow grooves and pits to<br>
be formed thereon with concavities and convexities.<br>
It is preferable that the intermediate resin layer 4<br>
has strong adhesion, and small shrinkage factor at the<br>
time that the intermediate resin layer 4 hardens and<br>
adheres, which gives higher stability to the shape of<br>
the medium.<br>
It is desirable that the intermediate resin<br>
layer 4 is made from a material that does not damage<br>
the second recording layer 5. The intermediate resin<br>
layer 4 and the second recording layer 5 are soluble<br><br>
into each other in ordinary cases because the<br>
intermediate resin layer 4 is generally made from a<br>
resin which is soluble the dye materials of the second<br>
recording layer 5. For this, it is desirable to<br>
provide a buffer layer to be described later between<br>
the both layers in order to prevent the intermediate<br>
resin layer 4 from dissolving the second recording<br>
layer 5 and from giving damage thereto.<br>
Further, it is desirable that the<br>
intermediate resin layer 4 is made from a material that<br>
does not damage the first reflective layer 3. It is<br>
possible to provide a buffer layer to be described<br>
later between the both layers in order to avoid the<br>
damage.<br>
In this optical recording medium, it is<br>
preferable to accurately control the film thickness<br>
of the intermediate resin layer 4 . The film thickness<br>
of the intermediate resin layer 4 is preferably 5<br>
\x rn or more, in general. It is necessary to provide<br>
a certain degree of distance between the two recording<br>
layers in order to perform the focusing servo control<br>
separately on the two recording layers. The film<br>
thickness of the intermediate resin layer 4 is<br>
required to be generally 5 \x m or more, and preferably<br>
10 \x m or more although it depends on the focusing<br>
servo mechanism. Generally, the distance between the<br>
two recording layers can be smaller as the objective<br><br>
lens has a larger numerical aperture. However, when<br>
the intermediate resin layer 4 is excessively thick,<br>
it takes a long time to adjust the focusing servo to<br>
the two recording layers and the objective lens has<br>
to be moved for a long distance, which is thus<br>
undesirable^ Further, an excessively thick layer<br>
requires a long time to harden, which leads to a<br>
decrease in productivity. Accordingly, the film<br>
thickness of the intermediate resin layer 5 is<br>
preferably 100 n m or less.<br>
Spiral or concentric concavities and<br>
convexities are formed on the intermediate resin<br>
layer 4 to form grooves and lands. Generally, such<br>
grooves and lands are used as recording tracks to<br>
record or read information in or from the second<br>
recording layer 5. Since the second recording layer<br>
5 is formed in coating, the film thereof is thick at<br>
the groove, thus suits for recording and reading. In<br>
this optical recording medium, it is preferable to use<br>
the groove of the intermediate resin layer 4, that is,<br>
the convex portion to the direction of the incident<br>
light beam, as the recording track 12. Here, the<br>
concave portion and the convex portion are a concave<br>
portion and a convex portion with respect to the<br>
direction of the incident light beam. Generally, the<br>
width of the groove is about 50 to 500 nm, and the depth<br>
of the same is about 10 to 250 nm. When t.he recording<br><br>
track is spiral, the track pitch is preferably about<br>
0.1 to 2.0 JJ. m. Concave or convex pits such as Land<br>
Pre-Pit may be formed as required.<br>
It is preferable from the viewpoint of the<br>
cost that such concavities and convexities are<br>
manufactured by transferring the concavities and<br>
convexities from a resin stamper or the like having<br>
the concavities and convexities to a setting resin<br>
such as a photo-setting resin, and other kind of resins .<br>
Hereinafter, such method will be occasionally<br>
referred to as 2P method (Photo Polymerization<br>
method).<br>
As the material of the intermediate resin<br>
layer 4, available are thermoplastic resins,<br>
thermosetting resins, electron beam setting resins,<br>
ultraviolet ray curing resins (including retarded<br>
setting type), etc., for example.<br>
The intermediate resin layer 4 can be formed<br>
by dissolving a thermoplastic resin, thermosetting<br>
resin or the like in an appropriate solvent to prepare<br>
a coating solution, applying the solution, and drying<br>
(heating) the solution. In the case of a ultraviolet<br>
curing resin, the intermediate resin layer 4 can be<br>
formed by dissolving the resin as it is or dissolving<br>
the resin in an appropriate solvent to prepare a<br>
coating solution, coating the coating solution, and<br>
radiating ultraviolet rays to cure the resin. There<br><br>
are various types of ultraviolet ray curing resins.<br>
However, any one of them can be used so long as it is<br>
transparent. One of these materials can be used or<br>
some of them can be mixed together to be used. Not<br>
only single layer but also multiple layers are<br>
applicable.<br>
As the coating method, a coating method such<br>
as spin coating, cast method or the like is applicable,<br>
like the recording layer. Among them, spin coating<br>
is preferable. A resin having high viscosity can be<br>
coated in screen printing or the like. Use of a<br>
ultraviolet ray curing resin that has low viscosity<br>
at a temperature of 20 to 4 0° C is preferable because<br>
no solvent is necessary to coat the resin. It is<br>
preferable to prepare the resin so that the viscosity<br>
thereof is 20 to 4000 mPa • s.<br>
As the ultraviolet ray curing adhesives,<br>
there are radical type ultraviolet ray curing<br>
adhesives and cation type ultraviolet ray curing<br>
adhesives, both of which are usable.<br>
As the radical type ultraviolet curing<br>
adhesives, all the known compositions are available.<br>
A composition containing an ultraviolet ray curing<br>
compound and a photopolymerization initiator as<br>
essential ingredients is used. As the ultraviolet<br>
ray curing compound, monofunctional (meta)acrylate<br>
or multifunctional (meta)acrylate is available as a<br><br>
polymeric monomer ingredient. These can be used<br>
solely, or two or more kinds of them can be used<br>
together. In this invention, acrylate and<br>
metaacrylate will be together referred to as<br>
(meta)acrylate.<br>
For example, the followings are the polymeric<br>
monomers that can be used for this optical recording<br>
medium. As monofunctional (meta)acrylate, there is,<br>
for example, (meta) acrylate or the like having, as the<br>
substituent, a group of methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl,<br>

and the like, di(meta)acrylate of<br>

of diole obtained by adding 4 or more moles of ethylene<br>
oxide or propylene oxide to 1 mole of neopentyl glycol,<br>
di(meta)acrylate of diole obtained by 2 moles of<br>
ethylene oxide or propylene oxide to 1 mole of<br>
bisphenol A, di or tri (meta) acrylate of triol obtained<br>
by adding 3 or more moles of ethylene oxide or<br>
propylene oxide to trimethylolpropane,<br>
di (meta) acrylate of diol obtained by adding 4 or more<br>
moles of ethylene oxide or propylene oxide to 1 mole<br>
of bisphenol A, trimethylolpropanetri(meta)acrylate,<br>

poly(meta)acrylate of dipentaerythritol, ethylene<br>
oxide denaturated phospholic acid (meta)acrylate,<br>

(meta)acrylate, etc.<br>
One that can be used together with polymetic<br>
monomer is polyester (meta)acrylate, polyether<br>
(meta)acrylate, epoxy (meta)acrylate, urethane<br>
(meta)acrylate or the like, as polymeric oligomer.<br>
As a photopolimerization initiator used for<br>
this optical recording medium, any one of the known<br>
initiators that can harden a used ultraviolet ray<br>
setting compound represented by polymeric oligomer<br>
and/or polymeric monomer can be used. As the optical<br><br>
•polymerization initiator, the molecular fission type<br>
or the hydrogen abstraction type is suitable.<br>
As such photopolymerization initiator,<br>
suitably used are bensoin isobutyl ether,<br>

one,<br>

e-l-one, and the like can be together used. Further,<br>
benzophenone, 4-phenylbenzophenon, isophthalphenone,<br>
4-benzoyl-4'-methyl-diphenylsulfide or the like,<br>
which are photopolimerization initiator of the<br>
hydrogen abstraction type, can be together used.<br>

initiator, amine that does not cause the addition<br>
reaction with the above polymeric component, such as<br>

p-dimethylaminoisoamylbenzoate,<br>
N,N-dimethylbenzylamine,<br>

is preferable to select and use one of the above<br>
photopolymerization initiators and sensitizers which<br>
has excellent solubility to the ultraviolet ray curing<br>
compound and does not hinder the ultraviolet ray<br>
transmissivity.<br>
As the cation type ultraviolet ray curing<br>
adhesive, all the known compositions can be used.<br>
Epoxy resins containing a photopolimerization<br>
initiator of the cation polymerization type<br>
correspond to this . As photo initiators of the cation<br>
polymerization type,_ there are sulfonium salts,<br>
iodonium salts, diazonium salts, etc.<br>
As examples of iodonium salts, there are<br>

4-methylphenyl-4-(1-methylethyl)phenyliodonium<br><br>
hexafluorophosphate,<br>
4-methylphenyl-4-(1-methylethyl)phenyliodonium<br>
hexafluoroantimonate,<br>
4-methylphenyl-4-(1-methylethyl)phenyliodonium<br>
tetrafluoroborate,<br>
4~methylphenyl-4-(1-methylethyl)phenyliodonium<br>
tetrakis (penthafluorophenyl)borate, etc.<br>
As the epoxy resin, any one of bisphenol<br>
A-epichlorohydrin type, alicylic epoxy, long-chain<br>
aliphatic type, brominated epoxy resin, glycidyl<br>
ester type, glycidyl ether type, heterocyclic system,<br>
etc. is available.<br>
As the epoxy resin, it is preferable to use<br>
one that has small contents of liberated free chlorine<br>
and chlorine ions in order to avoid the resin from<br>
damaging the reflective layer. The quantity of<br>
chlorine is preferably not larger than 1 wt%, and more<br>
preferably not larger than 0.5 wt%.<br>
A rate of the cation polymerization type<br>
photo-initiator per 100 % by weight of the cation type<br>
ultraviolet ray curing resin is generally 0.1 to 20 %<br>
by weight, and preferably 0.2 to 5 % by weight. In<br>
order to use more effectively the wavelengths in the<br>
near infrared ray region or the visible radiation<br>
region in the wavelength band of the ultraviolet ray<br>
source, it is possible to use together a known optical<br>
sensitizer. As such optical sensitizer, there are<br><br>
anthracene, phenotiazine, benzylmethylketal,<br>
benzophenone, acetophenone, etc.<br>
In order to improve various properties of the<br>
ultraviolet ray curing adhesive, it is possible to add,<br>
as other additives, a thermal polymerization<br>
hinibitor, an antioxidant represented by hindered<br>
phenol, hindered amine, phosphite, etc., a<br>
plasticizer, a silane coupling agent represented by<br>
epoxysilane, mercaptosilane, (meta) acrylsilane,<br>
etc. , as required. Among them, one that has excellent<br>
solubility to the ultraviolet ray curing compound and<br>
does not hinder the ultraviolet ray transmissiveness<br>
is selected and used,<br>
(e) With Respect To Second Recording Layer 5<br>
The second recording layer 5 generally has<br>
higher sensitivity than a recording layer used for a<br>
single-sided recording medium ("single-sided" means<br>
for example, CD-R, DVD-R, DVD+R and the like). In<br>
this optical recording medium, since the power of an<br>
incident optical beam is decreased by the presence of<br>
the fist recording layer 2 and the first reflective<br>
layer 3 or the like, recording is performed with a half<br>
of the power. Accordingly, the second recording<br>
layer 5 is required to have specifically high<br>
sensitivity.<br>
For the purpose of realization of excellent<br>
recording/reading performance, it is desirable that<br><br>
the dye develops a little heat and has large refractive<br>
index.<br>
Further, it is desirable that a combination<br>
of the second recording layer 5 and the second<br>
reflective layer 6 provides appropriate ranges of<br>
reflection and absorption of the light. Whereby, the<br>
recording sensitivity can be increased and the thermal<br>
interference during recording can be diminished.<br>
The materials and deposition method of the<br>
second recording layer 5 are almost the same as the<br>
first recording layer 2, thus only the differences<br>
between them will be hereinafter described.<br>
The film thickness of the second recording<br>
layer 5 is not specifically limited because the<br>
suitable film thickness differs according to the<br>
recording method, etc. In order to obtain sufficient<br>
modulation amplitude, the film thickness of the second<br>
recording layer 5 is preferably 10 nm or more in<br>
general,- more preferably 30 nm or more, and<br>
particularly preferably 50 nm or more. However, the<br>
film is required not to be excessively thick in order<br>
to obtain appropriate reflectance, the film thickness<br>
is generally 3 n m. or less, preferably 1 IJ. m or less,<br>
and more preferably 200 nm or less.<br>
The materials used for the first recording<br>
layer 2 and the second recording layer 5 may be the<br>
same or may differ from each other.<br><br>
(f) With Respect To Second Reflective Layer 6<br>
The second reflective layer 6 is required to<br>
have high reflectance. It is desirable that the<br>
reflective layer 6 is highly durable.<br>
In order to secure high reflectance, the<br>
thickness of the second reflective layer 6 is<br>
preferably 20 nm or more, in general, more preferably<br>
30 nm or more, and further preferably 50 nm or more.<br>
In order to shorten the tact time of the production<br>
anddecrease the cost, it is preferable that the second<br>
reflective layer 6 is thin to some degree.<br>
Accordingly, the film thickness is generally 400 nm<br>
or less, and more preferably 300 nm or less.<br>
As the material of the second reflective<br>
layer 6, it is possible to use, in pure metal or in<br>
a form of alloy, metals having sufficiently high<br>
reflectance at a wavelength of the reading light such<br>
as Au, Al, Ag, Cu, Ti, Cr, Ni, Pt, Ta and Pd, for example.<br>
Among them, Au, Al and Ag are suitable for the material<br>
of the second reflective layer 6 because they have high<br>
reflectance. Other than these as the main<br>
compositions, the second reflective layer 6 may<br>
contain the followings as other components. As<br>
examples of the other components, there are metals<br>
such as Mg, Se, Hf, V, Nb, Ru, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Co, Rh,<br>
Ir, Cu, Zn, Cd, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Te, Pb, Po, Sn, Bi and<br>
rare earth metals, and semimetals.<br><br>
A film containing Ag as the main component<br>
is particularly preferable because the cost thereof<br>
is low, it provides high reflectance and a beautiful<br>
white ground color when a print accepting layer to be<br>
described later is further provided. Here, "main<br>
component" signifies a component whose rate of content<br>
is not less than 50 percent.<br>
In order to secure high durability (high<br>
corrosion resistivity) of the second reflective layer<br>
6, it is preferable to use Ag in the form of alloy<br>
rather than as pure silver.<br>
Among the alloys, an alloy that contains Ag<br>
as the main component and contains 0.1 to 15 atomic<br>
percent of at least one element selected from the group<br>
consisting of Ti, Zn, Cu, Pd, Au and rare earth metals<br>
is preferable. When the alloy contains two or more<br>
of Ti, Zn, Cu, Pd, Au and rare earth metals, each of<br>
them may be contained 0.1 to 15 atomic percent.<br>
However, it is preferable that the sum of these is 0.1<br>
to 15 atomic percent.<br>
A particularly preferable composition of the<br>
alloy is that Ag is contained as the main component,<br>
0.1 to 15 atomic percent of at least one element<br>
selected from the group consisting of Ti, Zn, Cu, Pd<br>
and Au is contained, and 0.1 to 15 atomic percent of<br>
at least one rear earth element is contained. Among<br>
rare earth elements, neodymium is particularly<br><br>
preferable. More concretely, AgPdCu, AgCuAu,<br>
AgCuAuNd, AgCuNd or the like is preferable.<br>
As the second reflective layer 6, a layer made<br>
from only Au is preferable because its high durability<br>
(high corrosion resistance), but is more expensive<br>
than a layer made from only an Ag alloy.<br>
It is possible to stack a thin film having<br>
low reflective index and a thin film having high<br>
reflective index, both of which are made from<br>
materials other than metals, one on the other to form<br>
a multilayer, and use it as the second reflective layer<br>
6.<br>
As a method for forming the second reflective<br>
layer 6, there are, for example, spattering, ion<br>
plating, chemical vapor deposition, vacuum<br>
evaporation, etc. It is possible to provide a known<br>
inorganic or organic intermediate layer or an adhesive<br>
layer on the upper surface and the lower surface of<br>
the second reflective layer 6 in order to improve the<br>
reflectance, recording performance, adhesive<br>
properties and so forth,<br>
(g) With Respect To Adhesive Layer 7<br>
The adhesive layer 7 is not required to be<br>
transparent. High adhesion and small shrinkage of<br>
the adhesive layer 7 at the time that the layer is<br>
hardened and adhered brings stability of the shape of<br>
the medium, which is preferable.<br><br>
It is preferable that the adhesive layer 7<br>
is made from a material that does not damage the second<br>
reflective layer 6. It is possible to provide a known<br>
inorganic or organic protective layer between the both<br>
layers in order to avoid the damage on the reflective<br>
layer 7 .<br>
In this optical recording medium, the film<br>
thickness of the adhesive layer 7 is preferably 2<br>
jj. m or more, in general. In order to obtain<br>
predetermined adhesion, some degree of film thickness<br>
is required. More preferably, the film thickness of<br>
the adhesive layer 7 is 5 p. m or more. Generally, it<br>
is preferable that the film thickness of the adhesive<br>
layer 7 is 100 \i m or less in order to make the optical<br>
recording medium thin as much as possible. This is<br>
why a thick film requires a longer time to be hardened,<br>
which leads to a decrease in the productivity.<br>
The material of the adhesive layer 7 may be<br>
the same as the material of the intermediate resin<br>
layer 4, or may be a pressure sensitive double-sided<br>
tape or the like. By putting the pressure sensitive<br>
double-sided tape between the second reflective layer<br>
6 and the second substrate 8 and pressing them, the<br>
adhesive layer 7 can be formed,<br>
(h) With Respect To Second Substrate 8<br>
It is preferable that the second substrate<br>
8 has shape stability so that the optical recording<br><br>
medium has some degree of rigidity. Namely, it is<br>
preferable that the second substrate 8 has high<br>
mechanical stability and large rigidity. It is also<br>
preferable that the second substrate 8 has large<br>
adhesion to the adhesive layer 7.<br>
When the first substrate 1 does not have<br>
sufficient shape stability as above, the second<br>
substrate 8 is particularly required to have large<br>
shape stability. In this viewpoint, it is preferable<br>
that the second substrate 8 has low moisture<br>
absorption. The second substrate 8 is not required<br>
to be transparent. The second substrate 8 may be a<br>
mirror substrate, and is not required to have<br>
concavities and convexities thereon. Thus, the<br>
second substrate 8 is not always required to have good<br>
transfer property in injection molding.<br>
As such material, the same material as that,<br>
used for the first substrate 1 can be used. Other than<br>
this, there can be used an Al alloy substrate<br>
containing Al as the main component such as an Al-Mg<br>
alloy or the like, an Mg alloy substrate containing<br>
Mg as the main component such as an Mg-Zn alloy or the<br>
like, a substrate made from any one of silicon,<br>
titanium and ceramics, or a substrate made by<br>
combining them.<br>
In the viewpoint of high productivity such<br>
as molding property and the like, cost, low moisture<br><br>
absorption, shape stability, etc., polycarbonate is<br>
preferable. In the viewpoint of chemical resistance,<br>
low moisture absorption, etc., amorphous polyolefin<br>
is preferable. In the viewpoint of high-speed<br>
responsibility, etc., a glass substrate is<br>
preferable.<br>
In order to give sufficient rigidity to the<br>
optical recording medium, it is preferable that the<br>
second substrate 8 is thick to some degree, having a<br>
thickness of not less than 0.3 mm. However, since a<br>
thinner second substrate 8 is more advantageous to<br>
make the recording/reading apparatus thinner, the<br>
thickness of the second substrate 8 is preferably 3<br>
mm or less, and more preferably 1.5 mm or less.<br>
The second substrate 8 may be a mirror<br>
substrate not having concavities and convexities<br>
thereon. From the standpoint of easy production, it<br>
is preferable that the second substrate 8 is<br>
manufactured in injection molding.<br>
An example of a preferable combination of the<br>
first substrate 1 and the second substrate 8 is that<br>
the first substrate 1 and the second substrate 8 are<br>
made from the same material, and have the same<br>
thickness. By doing so, the rigidity of the first<br>
substrate 1 and the second substrate 8 are equivalent,<br>
which gives good mechanical balance. Whereby, the<br>
medium is prone not deform due to changes in<br><br>
environment, which is preferable. In which case, it<br>
is preferable that deformation of each substrate<br>
occurs in the same direction and in the same degree<br>
in case of the environmental changes.<br>
As another preferable example of the<br>
combination, the first substrate 1 is as thin as about<br>
0.1 mm, whereas the-second substrate 8 is as thick as<br>
about 1.1 mm. By doing so, the objective lens can<br>
easily approach the recording layer, whereby the<br>
recoding density is easily increased. Accordingly,<br>
this is preferable. In this case, the first substrate<br>
1 may be in sheet-like shape,<br>
(i) With Respect To Other Layers<br>
In this layered structure, another layer may<br>
be arbitrarily put in the layers as required.<br>
Alternatively, it is possible to arbitrarily provide<br>
another layer on the outermost surface of the medium.<br>
In concrete, it is possible to provide a buffer layer<br>
as an intermediate layer between the first reflective<br>
layer 3 and the intermediate resin layer 4, the<br>
intermediate resin layer 4 and the second recording<br>
layer 5, or the second reflective layer 6 and the<br>
adhesive layer 7, for example.<br>
The buffer layer is to prevent two layers from<br>
dissolving in each other and prevent the two layers<br>
from blending to each other. The buffer layer may<br>
have another function than the function of preventing<br><br>
the dissolving phenomenon. Further, still another<br>
intermediate layer may be put as required.<br>
The material of the buffer layer is required<br>
to be immiscible with the second recording layer 5 or<br>
the intermediate resin layer 4, and be optically<br>
transmittable to' some degree. The known inorganic or<br>
organic material can be used for the buffer layer. In<br>
the viewpoint of the properties, an organic material<br>
is preferably used. For example, ( i ) metal or<br>
semiconductor, ( ii ) oxide, nitride, sulfide,<br>
trisulfide, fluoride or carbide of metal or<br>
semiconductor, and (iii ) amorphous carbon or the like<br>
are available. Among these, a layer made from an<br>
almost transparent dielectric substance, or a very<br>
thin metal layer (including alloy) is preferable.<br>
In concrete, oxides such as silicon oxide,<br>
particularly, silicon dioxide, zinc oxide, cerium<br>
oxide, yttrium oxide and the like; sulfides such as<br>
zinc sulfide, yttrium sulfide and the like; nitrides<br>
such as silicon nitride and the like; silicon carbide;<br>
a mixture (trisulfide) of an oxide and sulfur; and<br>
alloys to be described later are preferable. A<br>
mixture of silicon oxide and zinc sulfide at a ratio<br>
of approximately 30:70 to 90:10 is preferable. A<br>
■mixture (Y202S-ZnO) of sulfur, yttrium dioxide and<br>
zinc oxide is also preferable.<br>
As the metal or alloy, silver or an alloy that<br><br>
contains silver as the main component and 0.1 to 15<br>
atomic percent of at least one element selected from<br>
the group consisting of titanium, zinc, copper,<br>
palladium and gold is preferable. An alloy that<br>
contains silver as the main component and 0.1 to 15<br>
atomic percent of at least one rare earth element is<br>
preferable, as well. As the rare earth element,<br>
neodymium, praseodymium, cerium or the like is<br>
preferable.<br>
Alternatively, any resin layer can be used<br>
so long as it does not solve the dye in the recording<br>
layer when the buffer layer is made. Particularly,<br>
a polymer film which can be manufactured in vacuum<br>
evaporation or CVD method is useful.<br>
The thickness of the buffer layer is<br>
preferably 2 nm or more, and more preferably 5 nm or<br>
more. When the buffer layer is excessively thin,<br>
prevention of the above mixing phenomenon tends to be<br>
insufficient. The thickness of the buffer layer is<br>
preferably 2000 nm or less, and more preferably 500<br>
nm or less. Excessive thick buffer layer is not only<br>
necessary for prevention of the mixing but also may<br>
cause a decrease in the optical transmission. When<br>
the layer is made from an inorganic substance, the film<br>
deposition of the layer takes a longer time, which<br>
causes a decrease in productivity, or the film stress<br>
is increased. Thus, the film thickness is preferably<br><br>
200 nm or less. Particularly, since a film made from<br>
a metal excessively deteriorates the optical<br>
transmittance, the film thickness is preferably<br>
approximately 20 nm or less.<br>
A protective layer may be provided in order<br>
to protect the recording layer or the reflective layer.<br>
The material of the protective layer is not<br>
specifically limited but any material is available so<br>
long as it protects the recording layer or the<br>
reflective layer from the external force. As an<br>
organic material of the protective layer, there are<br>
a thermal plastic resin, a thermal setting resin, an<br>
electron beam setting resin, a ultraviolet ray curing<br>
resin and the like. As an organic material of the<br>
protective layer, there are silicon oxide, silicon<br>
nitride, MgF2, Sn02 and the like.<br>
The protective layer can be formed by<br>
dissolving a thermal plastic resin, a thermal setting<br>
resin or the like in an appropriate solvent to prepare<br>
a coating solution, and applying and drying the<br>
solution. In the case of a ultraviolet ray curing<br>
resin, the protective layer can be formed by preparing<br>
a coating solution of the ultraviolet ray curing resin<br>
itself or a coating solution obtained by dissolving<br>
the ultraviolet ray curing resin in an appropriate<br>
solvent, applying the coating solution, irradiating<br>
UV light to set the solution. As the ultraviolet ray<br><br>
curing resins, there are acrylate resins such as<br>
urethane acrylate, expoxy acrylate, polyester<br>
acrylate, etc. These materials can be used solely or<br>
can be mixed to be used. Further, use of not only a<br>
single layer but also a multilayer is possible.<br>
As the method of forming the protective-layer,<br>
there are coating methods such as spin coating, cast<br>
and the like, sputtering, chemical evaporation, etc.<br>
Among these, spin coating is preferable.<br>
The film thickness of the protective layer<br>
is generally within a range from 0.1 to 100 fim. In<br>
this optical recording medium, the film thickness of<br>
the protective layer is preferably from 3 to 50 p.<br>
m.<br>
A print accepting layer, on which writing<br>
(printing) is possible with various printers such as<br>
ink-jet printer, thermal printer and the like, or<br>
various writing tools, may be put on a surface that<br>
is not a surface through which the recording/reading<br>
beam comes in, as required.<br>
Alternatively, another recording layer(s)<br>
may be put to form the optical recording medium having<br>
three or more recording layers. It is possible to bond<br>
two optical recording medium having this layer<br>
structure, with the first substrate 1 being on the<br>
outer side, to form a larger-capacity medium having<br>
four recording layers.<br><br>
(B) Type 2<br>
FIG. 2 is a sectional view typically showing<br>
an optical recording medium (of type 2) according to<br>
this embodiment.<br>
The optical recording medium (optical<br>
recording medium of the bonded, single-sided incident<br>
type) of type 2 according to this embodiment has a<br>
first recording layer (first recording layer, first<br>
dye containing recording layer) 22 containing a dye,<br>
a semitransparent first reflective layer<br>
(hereinafter referred to as a semitransparent<br>
reflective layer) 23, a transparent adhesive layer<br>
(intermediate layer) 24, a buffer layer 28, a second<br>
recording layer (second recording layer, second dye<br>
containing recording layer) 25 containing a dye, a<br>
second reflective layer 26, a transparent, disk-like<br>
shaped second substrate (second substrate) 27 in this<br>
order on a disk-like shaped, transparent<br>
(light-transmissible) first substrate (first<br>
substrate, first light-transmissible substrate) 21.<br>
The light beam is irradiated from the side of the first<br>
substrate 21 to perform recording/reading. In this<br>
embodiment, "transparent" signifies "transparent" to<br>
the optical beams used for recording on and reading<br>
from the optical recording medium.<br>
Concavities and convexities are formed on the<br>
first substrate 21 and the second substrate 27 to form<br><br>
respective recording tracks. A recording track 31 on<br>
the first substrate 21 is formed with the convex<br>
portion with respect to the direction of the incident<br>
light beams, whereas a recording track 32 on the second<br>
substrate 27 is formed with the concave portion with<br>
respect to the direction of the incident light beams.<br>
Meanwhile, the recording track 31 may be<br>
formed with the groove of the first substrate 21, that<br>
is, the concave portion with respect to the direction<br>
of incident light beams, whereas the recording track<br>
32 may be formed with the groove of the second<br>
substrate 27, that is, the convex portion with respect<br>
to the direction of incident light beams. Generally,<br>
it is preferable that the recording track 31 is formed<br>
with the convex portion with respect to the direction<br>
of incident light beam, whereas the recording track<br>
32 is formed with the concave portion with respect to<br>
the direction of incident light beams. It is possible<br>
to provide concave or convex pits other than the above<br>
as required. In this embodiment, concavity and<br>
convexity are defined with respect to the direction<br>
of an incident light beam used for recording or reading<br>
unless not specifically mentioned.<br>
Next, each of the layers will be described.<br>
The first substrate 21, the first recording<br>
layer 22, the first reflective layer 23, the second<br>
recording layer 25 and the second reflective layer 26<br><br>
of the optical recording medium of the type 2 according<br>
to this embodiment are almost similar to the first<br>
substrate 1, the first recording layer 2, the first<br>
reflective layer 3, the second recording layer 5 and<br>
the second reflective layer 6 of the optical recording<br>
medium of the type 1.<br>
The transparent adhesive layer 24 as being<br>
the intermediate layer is almost similar to the<br>
intermediate resin layer 4 of the optical recording<br>
medium of the type 1 except that there is no need to<br>
form the grooves and pits with concavities and<br>
convexities. Incidentally, the above grooves and<br>
pits are formed on the second substrate 27 to be<br>
described later in the optical recording medium of the<br>
type 2.<br>
The buffer layer 28 as being the intermediate<br>
layer is almost similar in structure to the buffer<br>
layer described above in the first embodiment. The<br>
buffer layer may be formed only when necessary.<br>
It is preferable that the second substrate<br>
27 is transparent, and has shape stability so that the<br>
optical recording medium has some degree of rigidity.<br>
Namely, it is preferable that the second substrate 27<br>
has high mechanical stability and large rigidity.<br>
As such material, there can be used resins<br>
such as acrylic resins, methacrylic resins,<br>
polycarbonate resin, polyolefin resins (particularly'*■<br><br>
amorphous polyolefin), polyester resins, polystyrene<br>
resin, epoxy resin and so forth, and glass.<br>
On the second substrate 27, concavities and<br>
convexities are spirally or concentrically formed to<br>
form grooves and lands. Generally, such grooves<br>
and/or lands are used as recording tracks to record<br>
or read information on or from the second recording<br>
layer 25. Since the second recording layer 25 is<br>
generally formed in coating, the film thickness<br>
thereof is large at the groove portion so that the<br>
groove portion is suitable for recording and reading.<br>
It is preferable in this optical recording medium to<br>
assign the groove portion, that is, the concave<br>
portion with respect to the direction of the incident<br>
light beam, of the second substrate 27 as the recording<br>
track 32. Here, "concave portion" and "convex<br>
portion" signify "concave portion" and "convex<br>
portion" with respect to the direction of the incident<br>
light beam. Generally, the groove has a width of<br>
about 50 to 500 nm, and has a depth of about 10 to 250<br>
nm. When the recording track is spiral, it is<br>
preferable that the track pitch is approximately 0.1<br>
to 2.0 ix m. The second substrate 27 may have<br>
concave/convex pits such as Land Pre-Pit as required.<br>
From the standpoint of cost, it is preferable<br>
that the second substrate 27 having such concavities,<br>
and convexities is made from a resin and manufactured<br><br>
in injection molding with a stamper having concavities<br>
and convexities. When a resin layer made from a<br>
radiation-setting resin such as a photo-setting resin<br>
or the like is formed on the substrate body made from<br>
glass or the like, concavities and convexities for<br>
recording tracks or the like may be formed on the resin<br>
layer.<br>
As having been discussed a write-once optical<br>
recording medium (DVD-R) having a dye containing<br>
recording layer having the above structure up to this<br>
point, the optical recording medium is not limited to<br>
this example, but this invention can be applied to any<br>
optical recording medium so long as it has a plurality<br>
of recording layers on which information can be<br>
recorded and read by irradiating a laser beam from one<br>
side thereof. For example, this invention can be<br>
applied to a rewritable optical recording medium (for<br>
example, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM or the like) having<br>
a phase-change recording layer as being a recording<br>
layer in which a portion in the crystalline state is<br>
used as the unrecorded state/erased state, whereas a<br>
portion in the amorphous state is used as the recorded<br>
state, or an magneto-optical recording medium having<br>
a magnetic recording layer as the recording layer, for<br>
example.<br>
When the optical recording medium is a DVD-RW,<br>
address information can be beforehand recorded with<br><br>
Land Pre-Pit, like the above DVD-R. When the optical<br>
recording medium is a DVD+RW, address information can<br>
be beforehand superposed on the wobble and recorded<br>
(this is referred to as ADIP: Address in Pre-groove) .<br>
When this invention is applied to a<br>
rewritable optical recording medium containing a<br>
phase-change recording layer, each of the first<br>
recording layer and the second recording layer of the<br>
optical recording medium in the above embodiment is<br>
comprised'of a first protective layer, an information<br>
recording layer and a second protective layer.<br>
As the material of this information recording<br>
layer, it is preferable to use a material whose optical<br>
constant (refractive index n, extinction coefficient<br>
k) is changed by irradiating a laser beam. As such<br>
material, there are, chalcogenides based on Te or Se<br>
such as alloys containing Ge-Sb-Te, Ge-Te,<br>
Pd-Ge-Sb-Te, In-Sb-Te, Sb-Te, Ag-In-Sb-Te,<br>
Ge-Sb-Bi-Te, Ge-Sb-Se-Te, Ge-Sn-Te, Ge-Sn-Te-Au,<br>
Ge-Sb-Te-Cr, In-Se, In-Se-Co or the like as the main<br>
component, and alloys to which nitrogen, oxygen, etc.<br>
are appropriately added to the former alloys, for<br>
example.<br>
As the material of the first protective layer<br>
and the second protective layer, it is preferable to<br>
use a material which is physically and chemically<br>
stable, has higher melting point than that of the<br><br>
information recording layer and high softening<br>
temperature, and is not mutually soluble with the<br>
material of the information recording layer in order<br>
to suppress an increase in noise due to thermal damage<br>
of the protective substrate, the information<br>
recording layer and the like at the time of irradiation<br>
of the laser beam, adjust the reflectance and<br>
absorptivity to the laser beam, the phase of the<br>
reflected light, etc. As such material, there are<br>
oxides of Y, Ce, Ti, Zr, Nb, Ta, Co, Zn, Al, Si, Ge,<br>
Sn, Pb, Sb, Bi, Te or the like, nitrides of Ti, Zr,<br>
Nb, Ta, Or, Mo, W, B, Al, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb or<br>
the like, carbides of Ti, Zr, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Si<br>
or the like, sulfides of Zn, Cd or the like, selenides,<br>
tellurides, fluorides of Mg, Ca or the like, simple<br>
substances of C, Si, Ge and the like, dielectrics made<br>
from mixtures of these, and materials treated in the<br>
same way as the dielectrics, for example. For the<br>
first protective layer and the second protective layer,<br>
different materials may be used as needed, or the same<br>
material may be used.<br>
In a single-sided incident type optical<br>
recording medium (for example, single-sided incident<br>
type DVD-R of the dual-layer type) having a plurality<br>
(here, two) recording layers 2 and 5 (22 and 25), on<br>
which information is recorded in or read from each of<br>
the layers by irradiating a laser beam from one side<br><br>
thereof, (optimum) recording/reading conditions such<br>
as tracking polarity, recording pulse strategy,<br>
recoding power, reading power, etc. largely vary<br>
according to each recording layer.<br>
Particularly, it is essential to optimize the<br>
recording conditions of layers 2 and 5 and of layers<br>
22 and 25. It is rare that reading is impossible even<br>
when the reading conditions deviate a little.<br>
However, when the recording conditions are not optimum,<br>
information may not be practically recorded. Or,<br>
even when information could be recoeded, the signal<br>
quantity sometimes deteriorates when the information<br>
is read.<br>
For this, it is desirable that information<br>
can be recorded and read accurately and surely under<br>
recording/reading conditions (for example, tracking<br>
polarity, recording pulse strategy, recording power,<br>
reading power, etc.) adapted to a recording layer 2<br>
or 5 (22 or 25) on which recording and reading of the<br>
information are to be performed.<br>
Particularly, in the optical recording<br>
medium of the type 1, the groove, that is, a convex<br>
portion with respect to the direction of the incident<br>
light beam, of the first substrate 1 is used as the<br>
recording track 11, whereas the groove, that is, a<br>
convex portion with respect to the direction of the<br>
incident light beam, of the intermediate resin layer<br><br>
4 is used as the recording track 12, whereby the first<br>
recording layer 2 and the second recording layer 5 have<br>
the same tracking polarity. On the other hand, in the<br>
optical recording medium of the type 2, the groove,<br>
that is, a convex portion with respect to the direction<br>
of the incident light beam, of the first substrate 21<br>
is used as the recording track 31, whereas the groove,<br>
that is, a concave portion with respect to the<br>
direction of the incident light beam, of the second<br>
substrate 27 is used as the recording track 32, thus<br>
the first recoding layer 22 and the second recording<br>
layer 25 have opposite tracking polarities.<br>
Even when an optical recording medium whose<br>
first recording layer and second recording layer have<br>
the same tracking polarity and an optical recording<br>
medium whose first recording layer and second<br>
recording layer have opposite tracking polarities are<br>
used together, it is desirable to accurately and<br>
surely record and read information with a tracking<br>
polarity adapted to the structure of an optical<br>
recording medium.<br>
According to this embodiment, at least one<br>
of the recording/reading conditions for each of the<br>
recording layers 2 and 5 (22 and 25) of the optical<br>
recording medium is recorded in the optical recording<br>
medium.<br>
Here, the recording/reading conditions<br><br>
include information about tracking polarity (for<br>
example, the polarity of push-pull signal) or land<br>
recording/groove recording (information<br>
representing whether tracking is performed with land<br>
or groove) (hereinafter, these are collectively<br>
referred to as tracking polarity or tracking<br>
information), recording pulse strategy (recording<br>
strategy, write strategy; laser output control<br>
pattern adapted to each recording layer), recording<br>
power, reading power and so forth. Incidentally, the<br>
recording/reading conditions include recording<br>
conditions such as tracking polarity, recording pulse<br>
strategy (write strategy), recording power, and so<br>
forth, and reading conditions such as tracking<br>
polarity, reading power, and so forth.<br>
Among these recording/reading conditions,<br>
recording/reading conditions such as recording pulse<br>
strategy, recording power and reading power and so<br>
forth other than tracking polarity may be recorded in<br>
each of the recording layers 2 and 5 (22 and 25)<br>
configuring the optical recording medium, or may be<br>
recorded in either the recording layer 2 or 5 (22 or<br>
25) .<br>
There is an idea that, among the above '<br>
recording/reading conditions, the tracking polarity<br>
of a recording layer other than a recording layer to<br>
which the drive first accesses is recorded in the<br><br>
recording layer to which the drive first accesses (for<br>
example, a recording layer closest to the side from<br>
which the laser beam comes in) . In other words, the<br>
tracking polarity may be recorded in only a recording<br>
layer to which the drive first accesses (that is, only<br>
one layer among the plural recording layers).<br>
In case where the tracking polarity is<br>
mismatched to the recording layer, the recorded<br>
information can not be read. For this, it is<br>
necessary to beforehand determine the tracking<br>
polarity (land recording or groove recording) of a<br>
recording layer to which the drive first accesses (for<br>
example, a recording layer closest to the side from<br>
which the laser beam comes in).<br>
In DVD-R having two recording layers, it is<br>
beforehand determined that information is recorded on<br>
the convex portion with respect to the incident light<br>
beam (land recording) on the first recording layer (a<br>
recording layer closest to the side from which the<br>
laser beam comes in) 2 (22), and the drive first<br>
accesses to the first recording layer 2 (22) . By<br>
relating the tracking polarity of the other recording<br>
layer [the second recording layer 5 (25)] to layer<br>
information and recording them in the first recording<br>
layer 2 (22), the drive can recognize the tracking<br>
polarity of the second recording layer 5 (25) by<br>
reading out them.<br><br>
Alternatively, the tracking polarity of the<br>
second recording layer 5 (25) other than the first<br>
recording layer 2 (22) may be beforehand determined<br>
like the first recording layer 2 (22) . In which case,<br>
it is unnecessary to record the tracking polarity of<br>
the second recording layer 5 (25) in the first<br>
recording layer 2 (22).<br>
Even when the tracking polarity of the<br>
recording layer 5 (25) is beforehand determined, the<br>
tracking polarity of the second recording layer 5 (25)<br>
may be recorded in the first recording layer 2 (22"),<br>
and the drive may read out it and change the<br>
predetermined tracking polarity. Whereby, the<br>
tracking polarity of a recording layer other than a<br>
recording layer to which the drive first accesses can<br>
be arbitrarily changed.<br>
Accordingly, it is preferable that the<br>
recording/reading conditions are recorded in only a<br>
layer closest to a side from which the laser beam comes<br>
in between the recording layers 2 and 5 (22 and 25)<br>
because the drive (recording/reading apparatus)<br>
generally first accesses to a layer closest to the side<br>
from which the laser beam comes in. Thus, the drive<br>
in such structure can quickly read the<br>
recording/reading conditions.<br>
In concrete, it is preferable that the<br>
recording/reading conditions are recorded in : a<br><br>
recording management area (RMA; for example, control<br>
track, the innermost peripheral portion) of either the<br>
recording layers 2 or 5 (22 or 25) with pre-pits (Land<br>
Pre-Pit) or wobble.<br>
Recording of .the recording/reading<br>
conditions such as tracking polarity, recording pulse<br>
strategy, recording recommended power, reading<br>
recommended power, and so forth is effective in an<br>
optical recording medium of the type 2 having the<br>
following structure. It is particularly important<br>
that in the optical recording medium of the type 2,<br>
the tracking polarity is included in the<br>
recording/reading conditions.<br>
Namely, the optical recording medium of the<br>
type 2 to which this invention is preferably applied<br>
has a first information recording body formed by<br>
stacking at least a recording layer containing a first<br>
dye and a semi-transparent reflective layer in order<br>
on a first substrate having guide grooves, and a second<br>
information recording body formed by stacking at least<br>
a reflective layer and a recording layer containing<br>
a second dye in order on a second substrate having<br>
guide grooves. The optical recording medium of the<br>
type 2 is formed by bonding the first information<br>
recording body and the second information recording<br>
body to each other with the sides on which the<br>
recording layers are formed being faced to each other<br><br>
through an optically transparent adhesive layer. The<br>
laser beam is irradiated from the first substrate's<br>
side to optically record or read information.<br>
It is desirable,' in the recording/reading<br>
apparatus (drive) which performs recording and<br>
reading of information on each of the recording layers<br>
2 and 5 (22 and 25) of a single-sided incident type<br>
optical recording medium having a plurality of<br>
recording layers, that the recording/reading<br>
conditions such as recording pulse strategy,<br>
recording power, reading power, and so forth can be<br>
switched according to a recording layer 2 or 5 (22 or<br>
25), and recording and reading of information can be<br>
performed accurately and surely. Since it is<br>
particularly important that the recording conditions<br>
are made optimum, it is desirable that the recording<br>
conditions can be switched to the optimum ones<br>
according to a recording layer 2 or 5 (22 or 25) so<br>
that information can be recorded accurately and<br>
surely.<br>
In such case, there is an idea of continuously<br>
attaching address information to a plurality of<br>
recording layers 2 and 5 (22 and 25) , and telling which<br>
layer is which layer on the basis of the read address<br>
information in the recording/reading apparatus.<br>
However, it is still difficult to instantaneously tell<br>
whic'h layer is which layer.<br><br>
According to this embodiment, layer<br>
information (information about the recording layer<br>
number; layer 0, layer 1) is recorded in each of the<br>
recording layers 2 and 5 (22 and 25) of the optical<br>
recording medium so that the recording/reading<br>
conditions such as recording pulse strategy<br>
(recording strategy, write strategy), recording<br>
power, reading power, and so forth can be<br>
instantaneously switched according to a recording<br>
layer 2 or 5 on which recording or reading of<br>
information is to be performed.<br>
As a recording method of the layer<br>
information, the following methods shown in ( i ) and<br>
( ii ) below are conceivable, for example.<br>
( i ) Recording layer information in the<br>
recording management area (RMA; for example, control<br>
track, the innermost portion) of each of the recording<br>
layers 2 and 5 (22 and 25) with, for example, pre-pits<br>
(Land Pre-Pit) or wobble.<br>
( ii ) Recording layer information on almost<br>
the entire surface of the recording area of each of<br>
the recording layers 2 and 5 (22 and 25) with, for<br>
example, pre-pit (Land Pre-Pit) or wobble.<br>
Here, "recording on almost the entire<br>
surface" includes "recording on almost the entire<br>
surface of the recording area including the recording<br>
management area of each of the recording layers 2 and<br><br>
5 (22 and 25) (for example, recording layer<br>
information as a part of address in the recording<br>
management area)," "recording layer information on<br>
the entire surface of the recording area excepting the<br>
recording management area of each of the recording<br>
layers 2 and 5 (22 and 25)," etc. Particularly, when<br>
the layer information cannot be recorded in the<br>
recording management area, it is effective to record<br>
the layer information on the entire surface of the<br>
recording area excepting the recording management<br>
area. This is also effective on the occasion of a<br>
random access for information recording or reading.<br>
For example, the layer information can be<br>
recorded as a part of address information of wobble<br>
or pre-pit (Land Pre-Pit). Whereby, it becomes<br>
possible to record the layer information on each of<br>
the recording layers 2 and 5 (22 and 25) in a simple<br>
manner. Recording the layer information as a part of<br>
address information can provide an advantage that when<br>
a random access is had to record or read information<br>
on the basis of the address information, it is possible<br>
to read out the layer information only by accessing<br>
to a desired address and performing the focusing servo<br>
control thereon. Whereby, it is possible to<br>
instantaneously switch the recording/reading<br>
conditions such as recording pulse strategy,<br>
recording power, reading power, and so forth on the<br><br>
basis of the layer information.<br>
As a method for recording the layer<br>
information as a part of address information, methods<br>
described in ( i ) through ( v ) below are conceivable,<br>
for example.<br>
( i ) As a method of recording the layer<br>
information as a part of address information in wobble<br>
(for example, ADIP; Address in pre-groove), reversing<br>
the sync pattern (synchronization pattern) included<br>
in the address information (for example, ADIP; Address<br>
in pre-groove) in wobble on either one of the two<br>
recording layers 2 and 5 (22 and 25) , for example.<br>
For example, the direction of the sync<br>
pattern (synchronization pattern) included in the<br>
ADIP of the second recording layer 5 (25) is reversed<br>
(is made opposite to) with respect to the direction<br>
of the sync pattern (synchronization pattern)<br>
included in the ADIP of the first recording layer 2<br>
(22) .<br>
( ii ) As a method of recording the layer<br>
information as a part of the address information in<br>
wobble or Land Pre-Pit formed in the recording area<br>
(including the recording management area) of each of<br>
the recording layers 2 and 5 (22 and 25), making the<br>
values of the reserved bit(s) differ from each other<br>
in the recording layers 2 and 5 (22 and 25).<br>
For example, the value of the reserved bit (s)<br><br>
of address information in wobble or LPP formed in the<br>
recording area (including recording management area)<br>
of the first recording layer 2 (22) is made differ from<br>
the value of the reserved bits of address information<br>
in wobble or Land Pre-Pit formed in the recording area<br>
(including recording management area) of the second<br>
recording layer 5 (25).<br>
Here, "reserved bit(s)" means a bit(s)<br>
present in a portion not currently used in an area in<br>
which the address information is recorded. The same<br>
modulation system or recording system as used for the<br>
address information can be applied to recording of<br>
information in the reserved bit(s). When the medium<br>
has a plurality of recording layers, it is necessary<br>
to increase the number of reserved bits to be used<br>
according to the number of layers of the recording<br>
layers. For example, when the medium has two<br>
recording layers, one bit is used as the reserved bit,<br>
and it is possible to discriminate the first layer from<br>
the second layer on the basis of whether the value of<br>
this bit is 0 or 1. When two bits are used as the<br>
reserved bits, it is possible to discriminate four<br>
recording layers from one anther because four values,<br>
that is, 00, 01, 10 and 11, can be expressed with two<br>
bits. Similarly, when three bits are used as the<br>
reserved bits, it is possible to discriminate eight<br>
recording layers from one another because eight values<br><br>
can be expressed. Namely, when n bits are used as the<br>
reserved bits, it is possible to discriminate 2"<br>
recording layers. If this method is combined with<br>
another method such as the above method ( i ) or the<br>
following methods (iii ) through (v), it is possible<br>
to decrease the number of reserved bits to be used.<br>
( iii ) As a method for recording the layer<br>
information as a part of address information in wobble<br>
or Land Pre-Pit formed in a recording area (including<br>
recoding management area) of each of the recording<br>
layers 2 and 5 (22 and 25), there is a method of<br>
inverting bits of the whole address information in<br>
wobble or Land Pre-Pit in either one of the two<br>
recording layers 2 and 5 (22 and 25).<br>
For example,- when addresses 3000-4FFF (Hex)<br>
are put in the first recording layer 2 (22) and<br>
addresses 5000-6FFF (Hex) are put in the second<br>
recording layer 5 (25), only the bits in the second<br>
recording layer 5 (25) are inverted to yield addresses<br>
AFFF-9000 (Hex) .<br>
Here, the description is made, by way of 16<br>
bits (four digits in the case of hexadecimal notation)<br>
for the sake of simplifying the explanation. Since<br>
the address information is practically expressed in<br>
48 bits (12 digits in the hexadecimal notation) in,<br>
for example, DVD-R, adding an allowance, the addresses<br>
in the first 'recording layer 2 (22) are<br><br>
000000003000-000000004FFF (Hex), whereas the<br>
addresses in the second recording layer 5 (25) are<br>
FFFFFFFFAFFF-FFFFFFFF9000 (Hex).<br>
Meanwhile, it is necessary to give the drive<br>
relationship information showing which range of<br>
addresses belongs to which layer, whereby the drive<br>
can discriminate a. layer when reading out an address.<br>
( iv ) As a method for recording the layer<br>
information as a part of address information in.wobble<br>
or pre-pits formed in the recording area (including<br>
recording management area) of each of the recording<br>
layers 2 and 5 (22 and 25), there is a method of<br>
expressing the whole address information in wobble or<br>
Land Pre-Pit on either one of the two recording layers<br>
2 and 5 (22 and 25) by two's complement (inverted whole<br>
bits + 1).<br>
For example, when addresses 3000-4FFF (Hex)<br>
are put in the first recording layer 2 (22) and<br>
addresses 5000-6FFF (Hex) are put in the second<br>
recording layer 5 (25), the second recording layer 5<br>
(25) is expressed by two's complement (inverted whole<br>
bits -i- 1), thus the addresses are BOOO-9001 (Hex).<br>
Here, the description is made by way of only<br>
16 bits (four digits in hexadecimal notation) for the<br>
sake of simplifying the explanation. Since the<br>
address information is practically expressed by 48<br>
bits (12 digits in hexadecimal notation) in, for<br><br>
example, DVD-R, adding an allowance, the addresses of<br>
the first recording layer 2 (22) are<br>
000000003000-000000004FFF (Hex), whereas the<br>
addresses of the second recording layer 5 (25) are<br>
FFFFFFFFB000-FFFFFFFF9001 (Hex).<br>
Meanwhile, it is necessary to give the drive<br>
relationship information showing which range of<br>
addresses belongs to which layer, whereby the drive<br>
can discriminate a layer when reading out an address.<br>
( v ) As a method of recording the layer<br>
information as a part of address information in wobble<br>
or Land Pre-Pit formed in the recording area<br>
(including recording management area) of each of the<br>
recording layers 2 and 5 (22 and 25) , there is a method<br>
of recording the layer information at the most<br>
significant bit of address information in wobble or<br>
Land Pre-Pit on either one of the two recording layers<br>
2 and 5 (22 and 25).<br>
For example, a value obtained by inverting<br>
a value of the most significant bit of address<br>
information in wobble or Land Pre-Pit on either the<br>
first recording layer 2 (22) or the second recording<br>
layer 5 (25) is put in the most significant bit of<br>
address information in wobble or Land Pre-Pit on the<br>
other recording layer.<br>
• Practically,	when	addresses<br>
000000003000-000000004FFF (Hex) are put in the first<br><br>
recording layer 2 (22) and addresses<br>
000000005000-000000006FFF (Hex) are put in the second<br>
recording layer 5 (25), for example, only the most<br>
significant bit in the second recording layer 5 (25)<br>
is inverted.<br>
When a bit is inverted in a binary number,<br>
"0" becomes "1". When this is expressed in a<br>
hexadecimal number (Hex) , "0" becomes "8" in this case.<br>
Accordingly, the addresses in the first recording<br>
layer 2 (22) are 000000003000-000000004FFF (Hex),<br>
whereas the addresses in the second recording layer<br>
5 (25) are 800000005000-800000006FFF (Hex).<br>
Incidentally, the drive is required to recognize the<br>
most significant bit of addresses as the layer<br>
information.<br>
Up to this point, the description has been<br>
made by way of example where this invention is applied<br>
to an optical recording medium having two recording<br>
layers on which information can be recorded or read<br>
by irradiating a laser beam from one side thereof.<br>
However, the present invention is not limited to this<br>
example. For example, the above layer information<br>
recording methods can be applied, solely or in<br>
combination, to an optical recording medium having<br>
three or more recording layers on which recording or<br>
reading of information can be performed by irradiating<br>
a laser beam from one side thereof. In which case,<br><br>
the above layer information recording method can be<br>
applied to neighboring two recording layers among the<br>
plural recording layers.<br>
(2) Optical Recording Medium Recording/Reading<br>
Method<br>
Hereinafter, description will be made of the<br>
outline of the optical recording medium<br>
recording/reading method structured as above.<br>
Recording on this optical recording medium<br>
(of the type 1 or the type 2) obtained as above is<br>
performed by irradiating a laser beam focused to a<br>
diameter of about 0 . 5 to 1 \i m on the recording layer<br>
from the side of the first substrate 1 or 21. In a<br>
portion on which the laser beam is irradiated,<br>
terminal deformation of the recording layer such as<br>
decomposition, exothermic reaction, dissolution, etc.<br>
occurs due to absorption of the energy of the laser<br>
beam, whereby the optical properties thereof are<br>
changed.<br>
Reading of recorded information is performed<br>
by reading, with the laser beam, a difference in<br>
reflectance between a portion in which the optical<br>
properties have changed and a portion in which the<br>
optical properties remain unchanged.<br>
Recording and reading are performed on each<br>
of the two recording layers in the following manner.<br>
Whether the focusing position of the focused laser<br><br>
beam is on the first recording layer 2 or 22, or the<br>
second recording layer 5 or 25 can be discriminated<br>
by using a focus error signal obtained in the knife<br>
edge method, astigmatism method, Foucault method or<br>
the like. Namely, when the objective lens for<br>
focusing the laser beam is shifted in the vertical<br>
direction, a different S-shaped curve is obtained<br>
according to whether the focus position of the laser<br>
beam is on the first recording layer 2 or 22, or on<br>
the second recording layer 5 or 25. It is possible<br>
to select the first recording layer 2 or 22, or the<br>
second recording layer 5 or 25 to be recorded or read<br>
by selecting which S-shaped curve is used.<br>
In the optical recording medium of the type<br>
1, it is preferable that concavities and convexities<br>
are formed on the first substrate 1 and the<br>
intermediate resin layer 4, and the convex portion of<br>
the first substrate 1 and the convex portion of the<br>
intermediate resin layer 4 are used as recording<br>
tracks to perform recording and reading, as shown in<br>
FIG. 1. Since the dye recording layer is generally<br>
formed in coating, the film thereof is thick at the<br>
groove, which is thus suitable for recording and<br>
reading. In the optical recording medium of the type<br>
1, it is preferable that the groove, that is, the<br>
convex portion to the direction of the incident light<br>
beam, of the first substrate 1 is used as a recording<br><br>
track 11, whereas the groove, that is, the convex<br>
portion to the direction of the incident light beam,<br>
of the intermediate resin layer 4 is used as a<br>
recording track 12.<br>
In the optical recording of the type 2, it<br>
is preferable that concavities and convexities are<br>
formed on the first substrate 21 and the second<br>
substrate 27, and the convex portion of the first<br>
substrate 21 and the concave portion of the second<br>
substrate 27 are used as recording tracks to perform<br>
recording and reading, as shown in FIG. 2.<br>
Incidentally, there is a case where the polarity of<br>
the tracking servo control on the first recording<br>
layer 22 is opposite to that of the tracking servo<br>
control on the second recording layer 25. In the<br>
optical recording medium of the type 2, it is<br>
preferable that the groove, that is, the convex<br>
portion to the direction of the incident light beam,<br>
of the first substrate 21 is used as a recording track<br>
31, whereas the groove, that is the concave portion<br>
to the direction of the incident light beam, of the<br>
second substrate 27 is used as a recording track 32.<br>
As the laser beam used for this optical<br>
recording media (of the type 1 and the type 2), N2,<br>
He-Cd, Ar, He-Ne, ruby, semiconductor, dye laser, etc.<br>
are available. Among these, the semiconductor laser<br>
is preferable because of its light weight, compactness,<br><br>
facility, etc.<br>
It is preferable that the wavelength of the<br>
used laser beam is as shorter as possible for the<br>
purpose of high-density recording. Particularly,<br>
the laser beam having a wavelength of 350 to 530 nm<br>
is preferable. As a typical example of such laser<br>
beam, there are laser beams having center wavelengths<br>
of 4 05 nm, 410 nm and 515 nm.<br>
An example of the laser beam having a<br>
wavelength within a range from 350 to 530 nm can be<br>
obtained by using a 405 nm or 410 nm blue high-power<br>
semiconductor laser or a 515 nm bluish green<br>
high-power semiconductor laser. Other than these,<br>
the laser beam can be obtained by<br>
wavelength-modulating, by means of a second harmonic<br>
generating element (SHG), either (a) a semiconductor<br>
laser that can continuously oscillate fundamental<br>
oscillation wavelengths of 740 to 960 nm, or (b) a<br>
solid state laser that is excited by a semiconductor<br>
laser to be able to continuously oscillate fundamental<br>
oscillation wavelengths of 740 to 960 nm.<br>
As the above SHG, any piezo element lacking<br>
inversion symmetry is usable, but KDP, ADP, BNN, KN,<br>
LBO and compound semiconductors are preferable. As<br>
practical examples of the second harmonic wave, there<br>
are 430 nm which is a double of 860 nm in the case of<br>
a semiconductor laser having a fundamental<br><br>
oscillation wavelength of 860 nm, 430 nm which is a<br>
double of 860 nm from Cr-doped LiSrAlF6 crystal<br>
(having a fundamental oscillation wavelength of 860<br>
nm) in the case of a solid laser excited by a<br>
semiconductor laser, etc.<br>

Next, description will be made of processes<br>
(recording/reading method, recording method, reading<br>
method for. optical recording medium) performed by<br>
executing predetermined programs by the control unit<br>
58 of the recording/reading apparatus 60 for the<br>
optical recording medium structured as above, with<br>
reference to FIGS. 4 through 6.<br>
Hereinafter, the description will be made,<br>
taking a case where information is recorded on (or read<br>
from) the optical recording medium 50 having two<br>
recording layers 2 and 5 (22 and 25), on which layer<br>
information is recorded on almost the entire surface<br>
of the recording layers, as an example.<br>
First, a recording/reading method [first<br>
recording/reading method] including a layer<br>
information reading step and a recording/reading<br>
control step will be described with reference to FIG.<br>
4. Next, a recording/reading method [second<br><br>
-^recording/reading method] ■ ■~'~-;yz' including '"	a<br>
recording/reading conditions reading step in<br>
addition to the above steps will be described with<br>
reference to FIGS. 5 and 6.<br>
[First Recording/Reading Method]<br>
(Recording Method for Optical Recording Medium)<br>
In the recording/reading apparatus (drive)<br>
60 for the optical recording medium, when a record<br>
instruction is inputted from a computer such as a<br>
personal computer or the like (or through an input unit<br>
such as a button equipped to the drive itself), the<br>
control unit 58 accesses to a contents information<br>
area included in the recording area of the medium to<br>
determine at which addresses writing is possible, as<br>
shown in FIG. 4. The control unit 58 determines on<br>
which layer the recording is to be performed, on the<br>
basis of addresses determined to be writable thereat<br>
(step S10). In the case where the control unit 58<br>
beforehand accesses to the contents information area<br>
to read out the contents information when the medium<br>
is set in the drive, the control unit 58 may determine<br>
at which addresses information can be written, on the<br>
basis of the contents information beforehand read out.<br>
In the case where the layer information is<br>
included in the address information, it is possible<br>
to determine on which recording layer information can<br>
be written, by detecting the layer information<br><br>
included in the address.information. In the case:<br>
where a table holding the address information and the<br>
layer information related to each other is given to<br>
the drive, it is possible to determine the layer<br>
information from the address information, using the<br>
table.<br>
On the other hand, when a read instruction<br>
is inputted from a computer such as a personal computer<br>
or the like (or through an input unit such as a button<br>
equipped to the drive itself), the control unit 58<br>
determines on which recording layer information is to<br>
be recorded, on the basis of address information<br>
included in the read instruction (step S10).<br>
In this case, when the medium is set in the<br>
drive, the contents information (information showing<br>
which information is recorded at which addresses) may<br>
be read out from the medium, an icon may be displayed<br>
on the screen of the computer, for example, and the<br>
read instruction including the address information<br>
may be inputted to the drive when the user clicks the<br>
icon .<br>
When the record instruction (or the read<br>
instruction) is inputted, the control unit 58<br>
specifies a recording layer on which recording (or<br>
reading) is to be performed. This function of the<br>
control unit 58 is referred to as a recording layer<br>
determining unit (recording layer specifying unit) .<br><br>
When a record instruction	 (or a read<br>
instruction) is inputted, the control unit 58<br>
instructs the focusing servo circuit 55A to perform<br>
the focusing servo control. Responsive to it, the<br>
focusing servo circuit 55A controls the optical pickup<br>
53 through the focus driver 54 and the pickup actuator<br>
to perform the focusing servo control on either the<br>
first recording layer 2 (22) or the second recording<br>
layer 5 (25) (step S20) . This function of the control<br>
unit 58 is referred to as a focusing servo control<br>
unit.<br>
In the case where the layer information is<br>
recorded as a part-of the address information on almost<br>
the entire surface of each of the recording layers 2<br>
and 5 (22 and 25) of the optical recording medium 50,<br>
the focusing servo circuit 55A may perform the<br>
focusing servo control, with the optical pickup 53<br>
accessing to a desired address on the basis of the<br>
address information. In the case where the layer<br>
information is recorded in the recording management<br>
area of the optical recording medium 50, the focusing<br>
servo control circuit 55A may perform the focusing<br>
servo control in this recording management area.<br>
In the case where information is recorded on<br>
(or read from) an optical recording medium having a<br>
plurality of recording layers, the focusing servo<br>
control may be performed on any one of the plural<br><br>
recording layers.<br>
Next, the control unit 58 reads out, through<br>
the preamplifier 56A, the matrix circuit 56B and the<br>
demodulating circuit 56C as being the signal<br>
processing unit 56, layer information recorded on the<br>
recording layer on which the focusing servo control<br>
has been performed (step S30). This function of the<br>
control unit 58 is referred to as a layer information<br>
reading unit.<br>
The control unit 58 judges whether or not a<br>
recording layer specified on the basis of the layer<br>
information read out at step S30 is the recording layer<br>
specified as the recording layer to be recorded<br>
thereon or read therefrom at step S10 (step S40).<br>
This function of the control unit 58 is referred to<br>
as a recording layer judging unit.<br>
When the control unit 58 judges, as a result<br>
of this judgment, that the recording layer specified<br>
on the basis of the layer information read out is the<br>
recording layer (specific recording layer to be<br>
recorded thereon) specified as a recording layer to<br>
be recorded thereon, the control unit 58 gives a record<br>
instruction to the optical pickup 53 through the data<br>
processing unit 57 and the recording laser driver<br>
54Ab. Responsive to it, the laser diode is driven to<br>
record information (data) sent from, for example, a<br>
personal computer or another equipment at addresses<br><br>
specified on the basis of the address information of ;<br>
the recording layer on which the focusing servo<br>
control has been performed under recording conditions<br>
(recording/reading conditions) such as recording<br>
pulse, strategy, recording power and so forth adapted<br>
to the recording layer (recording layer specified on<br>
the basis of the layer information) , while the<br>
tracking control is performed through the tracking<br>
servo circuit 55B and tracking driver 54C (step S50) .<br>
This function of the control unit 58 is referred to<br>
as a recording control unit (recording/reading<br>
control unit).<br>
Meanwhile, the recording/reading conditions<br>
may be determined on the basis of recording/reading<br>
conditions beforehand recorded on the optical<br>
recording medium by reading out these, or may be<br>
determined on the basis of recording/reading<br>
conditions beforehand stored as the layer information<br>
in the recording/reading apparatus. For example, a<br>
recording recommended power or a reading recommended<br>
power may be recorded on the optical recording medium,<br>
the drive may read out it and determine the recording<br>
power or the reading power on the basis of it.<br>
Alternatively, a recording recommended<br>
power or a reading recommended power according to<br>
layer information may be stored in the drive, a<br>
recording recommended power or a reading recommended<br><br>
power adapted to the layer information may be read out<br>
on the basis of it, and a recording power or a reading<br>
power may be determined on the basis of the recommended<br>
recording power or the recommended reading power read<br>
out.<br>
According to circumstances, the OPC (Optimum<br>
Power Control) may be performed after a recording<br>
recommended power is read out, and a recording power<br>
may be determined.<br>
When the control unit 58 judges that a<br>
recording layer specified on the basis of the read out<br>
layer information is the recording layer (specific<br>
recording layer to be read therefrom) specified as a<br>
recording layer to be read therefrom, the control unit<br>
58 gives a read instruction to the optical pickup 53<br>
through the reading laser driver 54Aa to read, through<br>
the signal processing unit 56, information recorded<br>
at addresses specified on the basis of the address<br>
information of the recording layer on which the<br>
focusing servo control has been performed under<br>
reading conditions (recording/reading conditions)<br>
such as reading power and so forth adapted to that<br>
recording layer (recording layer specified on the<br>
basis of the layer information), while performing the<br>
trackir \ control through the tracking servo circuit<br>
55B and the tracking driver 54C (step S50). This<br>
function of the control unit is referred to as a<br><br>
reading control unit (recording/reading control<br>
unit) .<br>
When the control unit 58 judges that the<br>
recording layer specified on the basis of the layer<br>
information read out at step S40 is not the recording<br>
layer to be recorded thereon (or read therefrom) , the<br>
control unit 58 returns to step S20, performs the<br>
focusing servo control on another recording layer, and<br>
repeats the similar process (steps S20 to S40) until<br>
the control unit 58 judges that a recording layer<br>
specified on the basis of the read out layer<br>
information is the recording layer to be recorded<br>
thereon (or read therefrom).<br>
[Second Recording/Reading Method]<br>
(Process at the Time of Medium Loading)<br>
7\ccording to this embodiment, when the<br>
optical recording medium is loaded to the<br>
recording/reading apparatus	(drive),<br>
recording/reading conditions such as recording pulse<br>
strategy, recording recommended power, reading<br>
recommended power, tracking polarity, and so forth<br>
recorded in -relation with layer information on each<br>
of the recording layers 2 and 5 (22 and 25) on the<br>
optical recording medium 50 are read out according to<br>
an instruction from the control unit 58<br>
(recording/reading conditions reading step,<br>
recording/reading conditions reading unit), and<br><br>
these recording/reading conditions are related to<br>
layer information on each of the recording layers 2<br>
and 5 (22 and 25) and stored in the memory 58B.<br>
For example, in the case where<br>
recording/reading conditions are recorded on only one<br>
layer [the first recording layer 2 (22)] closest to<br>
the side from which the laser beam comes in between<br>
the recording layers 2 and 5 (22 and 25) and the drive<br>
first accesses to the first recording layer 2 (22),<br>
the drive accesses to the first recording layer 2 (22)<br>
and reads out the recording/reading conditions when<br>
the medium is loaded. In this case, the tracking<br>
polarity of the first recording layer 2 (22) is<br>
beforehand determined, and the tracking polarity read<br>
out from the first recording layer 2 (22) is a tracking<br>
polarity of the second recording layer 5 (25) other<br>
than the first recording layer 2 (22). The<br>
recording/reading conditions other than the tracking<br>
polarity are recording/reading conditions of each of<br>
the recording layers- 2 and 5 (22 and 25) .<br>
Incidentally, when the tracking polarity of the second<br>
recording layer 5 (25) other than the first recording<br>
layer is beforehand determined, it is unnecessary to<br>
record the conditions on the first recording layer 2<br>
(22) .<br>
According to this embodiment, information on<br>
recording/reading conditions such as recording pulse<br><br>
strategy, recording recommended power, reading<br>
recommended power, tracking polarity, and so forth is<br>
recorded as wobble or Land Pre-Pit, in particular.<br>
For this, this information detected by the optical<br>
pickup 53 is processed in the signal processing unit<br>
56 such as the matrix circuit 56B, the demodulating<br>
circuit 56C, etc. , and stored in the memory 58B of the<br>
control unit 58.<br>
When information on recoding/reading<br>
conditions such as recording pulse strategy,<br>
recording recommended power, reading recommended<br>
power, tracking polarity, and so forth is recorded as<br>
ROM pits or recording pits, this information detected<br>
by the optical pickup 53 is processed in the signal<br>
processing unit such as the matrix circuit, the<br>
binary-coding circuit, the demodulating circuit,<br>
etc. , and stored in the memory 58B of the control unit<br>
58.<br>
(Recording Method for Optical Recording Medium)<br>
In the recording/reading apparatus (drive)<br>
60 for the optical recording medium, when a record<br>
instruction is inputted from a computer such as a<br>
personal computer or the like (through an input unit<br>
such as a button or the like equipped to the drive<br>
itself), the control unit 58 accesses to a contents<br>
information area included in the recording area of the<br>
medium, and determines at which addresses writing is<br><br>
possible, as shown in FIG. 5. The control unit 58<br>
determines on which recording layer the recording is<br>
to be performed, on the basis of the addresses<br>
determined to be writable thereat (step A10) . In the<br>
case where the control unit 58 accesses to the contents<br>
information area when the medium is set on the drive<br>
and beforehand reads the contents information, the<br>
control unit 58 may determine at which addresses<br>
writing is possible, on the basis of the contents<br>
information beforehand read out.<br>
In the case where layer information is<br>
included in address information, the control unit 58<br>
can determine on which recording layer recording is<br>
possible by detecting the layer information included<br>
in the address information. In the case where a table<br>
holding address information and layer information<br>
related to each other is given to the drive, the<br>
control unit 58 can determine the layer information<br>
from the address information, using the table.<br>
When a record instruction is inputted, the<br>
control unit 58 specifies a recording layer to be<br>
recorded thereon, on the basis of the layer<br>
information, as above. This function of the control<br>
unit 58 is referred to as a recording layer determining<br>
unit (recording layer specifying unit).<br>
Next, the control unit 58 reads out the<br>
recording pulse strategy from the memory 58B on the<br><br>
basis of the layer information on the recording layer ....<br>
specified at step A10 (step A20) , and sets a recording<br>
pulse strategy of the recording strategy circuit 57B<br>
(step A30).<br>
The control unit 58 reads out the recording<br>
recommended power from the memory 58B on the basis of<br>
the layer information on the recording layer specified<br>
at step A10 (step A40), and sets an output setting<br>
value of the recording laser driver 54Ab on the basis<br>
of the read recording recommended power (step S50) .<br>
The control unit 58 further reads out the<br>
tracking polarity from the memory 58B on the basis of<br>
the layer information on the recording layer specified<br>
at step A10 (step A60), and sets a tracking polarity<br>
of the tracking servo circuit 55B (step A70).<br>
After the recording conditions<br>
(recording/reading conditions) are set as above, the<br>
control unit 58 gives a focusing servo control<br>
instruction to the focusing servo circuit 55A.<br>
Responsive to it, the focusing servo circuit 55A<br>
controls the optical pickup 53 through the focus<br>
driver 54B and the pickup actuator to perform the<br>
focusing servo control on either the first recording<br>
layer 2 (22) or the second recording layer 5 (25) (step<br>
A80) . This function of the control unit 58 is<br>
referred to as a focusing servo control unit.<br>
According to this embodiment, since the<br><br>
tracking polarity of :the tracking servo circuit 55B<br>
is set to a tracking polarity adapted to a recording<br>
layer specified at step A10, the tracking servo<br>
control is performed with a tracking polarity adapted<br>
to the recording layer specified at step A10.<br>
In the case where the layer information is<br>
recorded as a part of the address information on almost<br>
the entire surface of each of the recording layers 2<br>
and 5 (22 and 25) of the optical recording medium 50,<br>
the focusing servo control may be performed, with the<br>
control unit 58 accessing to a desired address on the<br>
basis of the address information. In the case where<br>
the layer information is recorded in the recording<br>
management area of the optical recording medium 50,<br>
the focusing servo control may be performed in the<br>
recording management area.<br>
In the case where information is recorded on<br>
an optical recording medium having a plurality of<br>
recording layers, the focusing servo control may be<br>
performed on any one of the plural recording layers.<br>
Next, the control unit 58 reads out layer<br>
information recorded on the recording layer on which<br>
the focusing servo control has been performed through<br>
the preamplifier 56A, the matrix circuit 56B and the<br>
demodulating circuit 56C as being the signal<br>
processing unit 56 (step A90) . This function of the<br>
control unit 58 is referred to as a layer information<br><br>
.-reading unit.	_.......:".._. -...,:;j..:.	<br>
The control unit 58 judges whether a<br>
recording layer specified on the basis of the layer<br>
information read out at step A90 is the recording layer<br>
specified at step A10 (step A100). Namely, the<br>
control unit 58 judges whether the layer information<br>
read at step A90 coincides with the layer information<br>
on the recording layer specified at step A10. This<br>
function of the control unit 58 is referred to as a<br>
recording layer judging unit (layer information<br>
j udging unit) .<br>
When the control unit 58 judges as a result<br>
of the judgment that the recording layer specified on<br>
the basis of the read layer information is the<br>
recording layer specified at step A10 (specific<br>
recording layer to be recorded thereon) (that is, the<br>
control unit 58 judges that the two pieces of layer<br>
information coincide with each other), the control<br>
unit 58 performs the optimum power control (OPC) on<br>
the laser beam outputted from the laser diode through<br>
the recording laser driver 54Ab (step A110) . Namely,<br>
the control unit 58 performs trial writing with<br>
various power of the laser beam in a power calibration<br>
area (PCA, trial writing area) set on the inner<br>
peripheral side (or outer peripheral side) of the<br>
recording layer on which the focusing servo control<br>
has been performed, thereby controlling the laser<br><br>
power to the optimum power adapted-to the recording<br>
layer specified at step A10.<br>
According to this embodiment, the output<br>
setting value of the recording laser driver 54Ab is<br>
set to a predetermined recording recommended power<br>
adapted to the recording layer, whereby the optimum<br>
power control can be quickly performed.<br>
On the other hand, when the control unit 58<br>
judges that the recording layer specified on the basis '<br>
of the layer information read out at step A100 is not<br>
the recording layer to be recorded thereon (that is,<br>
the control unit 58 judges that the two pieces of layer<br>
information do not coincide with each other), the<br>
control unit 58 returns to step A80, performs the<br>
focusing service control on another recording layer,<br>
and repeats the similar process until the control unit<br>
58 judges that a recording layer specified on the basis<br>
of the layer information is the recording layer to be<br>
recorded thereon (step A80 to A100).<br>
After performing the optimum power control<br>
as above, the control unit 58 gives a record<br>
instruction to the optical pickup 53 through the data<br>
processing unit 57 and the recording laser driver 54Ab.<br>
Responsive to it, the laser diode is driven to record<br>
information (data) sent from, for example, a personal<br>
computer or another equipment at addresses specified<br>
on the basis of address information of the recording<br><br>
	layer on which the focusing servo control has been':~<br>
performed under recording conditions<br>
(recording/reading conditions) adapted to the<br>
recording layer (step A120). This function of the<br>
control unit 58 is referred to as a recording<br>
controlling unit (recording/reading controlling<br>
unit) .<br>
According to this embodiment, since the<br>
recording pulse strategy (recording pulse modulation<br>
pattern) of the recording strategy circuit 57B is set<br>
to a recording pulse strategy adapted to the recording<br>
layer specified at Step AlO as state above, recording<br>
of information in a recording pulse strategy adapted<br>
to the recording layer to be recorded thereon is<br>
performed.<br>
According to this embodiment, the power<br>
(recording power) of the laser beam outputted from the<br>
recording laser driver 54Ab is controlled to the<br>
optimum power adapted to the recording layer specified<br>
at step AlO as state above, recording of information<br>
with a laser power adapted to the recording layer to<br>
be recorded thereon is performed.<br>
(Reading Method for Optical Recording Medium)<br>
In the recording/reading apparatus (drive)<br>
60 for the optical recording medium, when a read<br>
instruction is inputted from a computer such as a<br>
personal computer or the like (through an input unit<br><br>
such as a button equipped to the--drive-itself) , the<br>
control unit 58 determines which recording layer is<br>
to be read, on the basis address information included<br>
in the read instruction, as shown in FIG. 6 (step BIO) .<br>
In this case, when a medium is set to the drive,<br>
contents information (information showing what<br>
information is recorded at which addresses) may be<br>
read out, an icon may be displayed on the screen of<br>
the computer, for example, and the read instruction<br>
including the address information may be inputted to<br>
the drive when the user clicks the icon.<br>
When the read instruction is inputted as<br>
above, the control unit 58 specifies a recording layer<br>
to be read therefrom. This function of the control<br>
unit 58 is referred to as a recording layer determining<br>
unit (recording layer specifying unit).<br>
Next, the control unit 58 reads out a tracking<br>
polarity from the memory 58B on the basis of layer<br>
information on the recording layer specified at step<br>
BIO (step B20), and sets the tracking polarity of the<br>
tracking servo circuit 55B (step B30).<br>
After the reading conditions<br>
(recording/reading conditions) are set as above, the<br>
control unit 58 gives a focusing servo control<br>
instruction to the focusing servo circuit 55A.<br>
Responsive to it, the focusing servo circuit 55A<br>
controls the optical pickup 53 through the focusing<br><br>
-driver 54B.and the. pickup actuator	to perform the<br>
focusing servo control on either the first recording<br>
layer 2 (22) or the second recording layer 5 .(25) (step<br>
B40) . This function of the control unit 58 is<br>
referred to as a focusing servo control unit.<br>
According to this embodiment, since the<br>
tracking polarity of the tracking servo circuit 55B<br>
is set to a tracking polarity adapted to a recording<br>
layer specified at step BIO as above, tracking control<br>
is performed with a tracking polarity adapted to a<br>
recording layer to be read therefrom.<br>
In the case where layer information is<br>
recorded as a part of address information on almost<br>
the entire surface of each of the recording layers 2<br>
and 5 (22 and 25) of the optical recording medium 50,<br>
the focusing servo control may be performed, with the<br>
control unit 58 accessing to a desired address on the<br>
basis of the address information. In the case where<br>
the layer information is recorded in the recording<br>
management area, of the optical recording medium 50,<br>
the focusing servo control may be performed in this<br>
recording management area.<br>
In the case where reading of information is<br>
performed on an optical recording medium having a<br>
plurality of recording layers, the focusing servo<br>
control may be performed on one of the plural recording<br>
layers.<br><br>
Next, the control" "unit 58~"reads out layer "<br>
information recorded on the recording layer on which<br>
the focusing servo control has been performed through<br>
the preamplifier 56A, the matrix circuit 56B and the<br>
demodulating circuit 56C as being the signal<br>
processing unit 56 (step S50). This function of the<br>
control unit 58 is referred to as a layer information<br>
reading out.<br>
The control unit 58 judges whether a<br>
recording layer specified on the basis of the layer<br>
information read out at step B50 is the recording layer<br>
specified at step BIO (step B60) . Namely, the control<br>
unit 58 judges whether the layer information read out<br>
at step B50 coincides with layer information on the<br>
recording layer specified at step BIO. This function<br>
of the control unit 58 is referred to as a recording<br>
layer judging unit (layer information judging unit) .<br>
When the control unit 58 judges as a result<br>
of this judgment that the recording layer specified<br>
on the basis of the read layer information is the<br>
recording layer (specific recording layer to be read<br>
therefrom) specified at step BIO (that is, the control<br>
unit 58 judges that the two pieces of layer information<br>
coincide with each other), the control unit 58 gives<br>
a read instruction to the optical pickup 53 through<br>
the reading laser driver 54Aa. Responsive to it, the<br>
laser diode is driven to read information recorded at<br><br>
--^a-ddres ses -.—spec-if led _ .on ,. the— basis „=,of— addr-es^,,:<br>
information of the recording layer on which the<br>
focusing servo control has been performed through the<br>
signal processing unit 56 under reading conditions<br>
(recording/reading conditions) adapted to the<br>
recording layer (step B70). This function of the<br>
control unit 58 is referred to as a reading control<br>
unit (recording/reading control unit).<br>
According to this embodiment, since the power<br>
(reading power) of the laser beam outputted from the<br>
reading laser driver 54Aa is controlled to the optimum<br>
power adapted to the recording layer specified at step<br>
BIO, reading of information is performed with a laser<br>
power adapted to the recording layer to be read<br>
therefrom.<br>
When the control unit 58 judges at step B60<br>
that the recording layer specified on the basis of the<br>
read layer information is not the recording layer to<br>
be read therefrom (that is, the control unit 58 judges<br>
that the two pieces of layer information do not<br>
coincide with each other) , the control unit 58 returns<br>
to step B40, performs the focusing servo control on<br>
another recording layer, and repeats the similar<br>
process (steps B40 to B60) until the control unit 58<br>
judges that the recording layer specified on the basis<br>
of the read layer information is the recording layer<br>
to be read therefrom (that is, the two pieces of layer<br><br>
inferrm'atTolT"'coi'ncTHe^With'"~eaciv~otfi"ef")'".' " '~~" !_~" ""'<br>
An advantage of the optical recording medium,<br>
the recording/reading method and recording/reading<br>
apparatus for the optical recording medium according<br>
to this embodiment is that the recording/reading<br>
conditions such as recording pulse strategy,<br>
recording power, reading power, and so forth can be<br>
instantaneously switched according to a recording<br>
layer to be recorded information thereon or to be read<br>
information therefrom because layer information is<br>
recorded on the optical recording medium.<br>
It is also possible to accurately and surely<br>
perform recording or reading of information under<br>
recording/reading conditions (for example, tracking<br>
polarity, recording pulse strategy, recording power,<br>
reading power, and so forth) adapted to a recording<br>
layer on which recording or reading of information is<br>
to be performed.<br>
Note that the present invention is not<br>
limited to the above examples, but may be modified in<br>
various ways without departing from the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
