				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a condensate depression monitor to monitor thermal loss in the condenser associated with thermal power station.<br>
Considerable thermal loss in the condenser due to cooling of condensate below its condensing temperature has been observed during energy audit studies conducted in Thermal power stations.<br>
The steam which enters the condenser is condensed to liquid<br>
form. The condensed liquid which is called feed water  is then<br>
pumped  by  the condensate  extraction pump  into  low pressure<br>
regenerative feed water heaters (LP heaters) where it gets heated<br>
up.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the present system<br>
of  low  pressure  regenerative  feed water  heater  drain.   The<br>
process involves heating of the feedwater in the condenser and<br>
subsequent    heating    in    the    feedwater    heaters.After<br>
condensation, the liquid cools below its saturation point, for<br>
vacuum<br>
e.g. if the steam condenses at a  of 10 kPA the saturation temperature is 46 C. However the condensate leaves the hotwell at 42 to 45 C, hence it is sub cooled by 1 to 4 C. This drop in the temperature of feed water leaving the hotwell below its saturation temperature is called as condensate subcooling or condensate depression and is in direct contrast to the heating requirements of the LP heaters. The margin by which the condensate is sub-cooled in the condenser will have to be compensated by additional loading on the LP heaters there by reducing thermal efficiency.<br><br>
If the margin of condensates depressions is precisely known control action can be taken either by human loop or through electronic controls. The overall saving in energy if the condensate depression is reduced to O C is about 0.1 X improvements in the overall efficiency of the unit.<br>
There is disadvantages associated with the present system of estimating the depression and subsequent control action. In the prevalent method of measuring condensate depression in the operator would read the pressure from the pressure transmitter and run to the steam tables to find the saturated temperature and manually estimate the depression and Mould run back to take some control action. By the time the operator finishes this drill the temperature would have changed and he may have to begin this all over again and this process would go on.<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention is to provide a simple and effective condensate depression monitor.<br>
To circumvent this problem an instrument to display the condensate depression directly is very much essential as the depression is directly read out from the display which will enable corrective action to be taken immediately.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a condensate depression monitor for monitoring thermal loss in a condenser of a thermal power station comprising a condenser with a pressure transducer   and   a   temperature   transducer   for  providing<br><br>
corresponding   pressure  and  temperature  analog   signals,   a<br>
multiplexer for acquiring said analog signals and providing  them<br>
to  an A/D converter for converting  to digital  signals,  a<br>
microcontroller  for obtaining the digital signals pertaining  to<br>
pressure  and  temperature processing said  digital  signals  for<br>
displaying  the condensate depression on a seven segment  LED<br>
display.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages<br>
residing  in  the  same  will  be  apparent  from  the  following<br>
description   made  with  reference  to non-&gt;limiting   exemplary<br>
embodiments  of  the invention represented  in  the  accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
Figure  1 shows the block diagram existing method of control  of<br>
condensate depression;<br>
Figure  2 shows the schematic diagram of  condensate  depression<br>
monitor according to the invention.<br>
Figure  3 shows  a  flow chart  of  the  instrument  to measure<br>
condensate as per invention.<br>
Figure  1 shows the method of condesate control according to  the<br>
prior  art. The condensor (1) is provided with a  pressure  gauge<br>
(12)  and  a thermometer (13) on which  the  operator constantly<br>
monitor by reading the pressure and temperature.<br>
The  operator then refers to steam table (14) and calculates  the<br>
depression  (15).  The operator then rushes to the  control  room<br>
(16) and adjusts inlet and outlet valves (17) as required.<br><br>
The present invention called condensate depression monitor is used to display the condensate sub-cooling in a condenser (1) of a thermal power station. The fundamental prinicpal behind the instrument is to give a temperature output based on a pressure measurement. Thus based on the vapors pressure relation between pressure and temperature the temperature is measured as an output parameter.<br>
The Block diagram of the digital instrument developed is<br>
pressure shown in Fig. 2. The analog signal pertain to <br>
and temperature (3) are acquired  by the multiplexer (4) and<br>
properly amplified (5) to the range suitable to the A/D converter<br>
(7 ).    The acquired signals are converted to digital signal by<br>
the analog to digital converter (7 ),   The micro controller (8/<br>
obtains this digital signal for processing, display and control<br>
action.   The   Microcomputer   (8)   used   is   Intel   8031.<br>
The implementation of this invention is a mixture of hard<br>
ware and software and can be broadly classified as follows:<br>
Figure 3 shows the flow chart of the instrument to measure condensate.<br>
i.    Acquiring and processing the analog signal ( hard ware; ii.   Software control for the above.<br>
The pressure transducer (2)  which is used is an absolute pressure transducer (2),   the transducer gives a 4 to 20 mA signal<br><br>
which is acquired along with the mV signal from the thermocouple of the temperature transducer (3) with the help of a multiplexer (4) circuit. The output of this multiplexer (4) is connected to an amplifier (5) IC to amplify  the signal to a level acceptable to the analog to digital converter (7; IC. A sample and hold  circuit (6^ IC is connected in between the multiplexer (4; and the ADC {1j   to sample the circuit for a brief interval. The analog to digital converter {1j   configured in unalarmed which accepts input analog signal in the range of 0 to 10 V.<br>
The micro controller (8) IC 8031, acquires, the digital signals pertain to the pressure and temperature from the initial storage in the random access memory (RAM; it also fetches the process control program from the EPROM performs the calculation as per the program stored and outputs the digital signal to IC 8279 through Buffers and latches (9)   which effectively controls the display and keyboard (lO)o functins of the micro controller (8). The output of IC 8031 is passed through a prostate buffer and latches (9) to prevent the data bus from interfering with the address bus.<br>
A decoder is used to decode the 3 inputs to 8 outputs to facilitate the display on seven segment LED display (11).<br>
The signal once acquired has to be processed for the desired<br>
results. The digital signal pertaining to the pressure signal<br>
is processed to indicate the saturated temperature (T      by<br>
sat<br>
using the formula shown below:<br><br>
Where    A = +0.426776 E +02 B = +0.389270 E +04 C = -0.948654 E +01 Once Tsat. is computed The acquired physical temperature is subtracted from this to display condensate depression.<br>
In view of the transcendental functions involved in the calculation of the saturation temperature, the programming of the mathematical equations has to be done at High level language like C. Accordingly the program segments covering the A-D conversion and temperature display are written in ALP. However, the entire program is written as a single file in a PC and is compiled to the object code of 8031. This binary file is converted to hex and downloaded into the EPROM chip. The flow chart for the process is shown in Figure 3.<br>
A typical specification of the condensate depression monitor is given below:<br><br><br><br>
