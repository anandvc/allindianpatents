				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
OPTICAL FIBER AND OPTICAL FIBER PREFORM<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an optical fiber and an optical fiber preform.<br>
There was a problem in that when an optical analog signal or an optical baseband signal<br>
is transmitted for a long distance by using an optical fiber, due to an effect of stimulated<br>
Brillouin scattering (hereinafter, referred to as SBS), only a predetermined intensity of<br>
light (SBS threshold power) can be transmitted through the optical fiber although light<br>
with higher power was intended to be transmitted, and the remaining light becomes<br>
backscattered light and returns to the incoming side, so that transmissible power of signal<br>
light is limited. The invention relates to an optical fiber capable of suppressing<br>
occurrences of SBS and transmitting higher power of signal light.<br>
Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-249360, filed on<br>
September 14, 2006, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Recently, fiber to the home (FTTH) services in which homes are connected via<br>
optical fibers to exchange information using the optical fibers have been expanded. In<br>
FTTH services for transmitting various types of information, there is a system for<br>
simultaneously transmitting a broadcasting signal and other communications signals in<br>
their respective modes using a single optical fiber. In general, in this system, in many<br>
cases, the broadcasting signal is an analog signal, a baseband signal, or an optical SCM<br>
 <br>
signal. The characteristics of this system from the point of optical fiber as a<br>
transmission medium are as follows:<br>
(i) FTTH is based on a typical double-star PON (passive optical network), and a<br>
distribution loss increases.<br>
(ii) In order to transmit an analog signal, a baseband signal, or an optical SCM<br>
signal, a receiver needs a high CNR (carrier-to-noise ratio), so that the minimum signal<br>
light power of a light receiving unit needs to be greater than that in digital transmission<br>
used for communications.<br>
[0003]<br>
As described above, when analog transmission using intensity modulation is<br>
performed for video transmission, high power transmission is needed to compensate for a<br>
distribution loss and guarantee a high CNR. However, there was a problem in that only<br>
a predetermined intensity of light (SBS threshold power) can be transmitted through the<br>
optical fiber although higher power is intended to be transmitted, and the remaining light<br>
becomes backscattered light and returns to the incident side, so that transmissible signal<br>
light power was limited.<br>
[0004]<br>
As means for suppressing SBS, there is a technique for changing a dopant<br>
concentration and a residual stress in a longitudinal direction (for example, see Patent<br>
Document 1). In this technique, by changing the dopant concentration or the residual<br>
stress in the longitudinal direction, it is possible to enlarge the Brillouin spectrum and<br>
suppress occurrences of SBS. In addition, techniques for giving such a refractive index<br>
profile for an optical fiber that SBS can be suppressed, are proposed (for example, see<br>
Patent Documents 2 to 5, and 7).<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems that the Invention is to Solve<br>
[0005]<br>
As a technique for suppressing SBS, as described above, the technique for<br>
changing a dopant concentration or a residual stress in a longitudinal direction is reported<br>
(Patent Document 1). However, in this technique, optical characteristics are changed in<br>
the longitudinal, so that this technique is not preferable for practical use.<br>
[0006]<br>
In addition, techniques for suppressing SBS by giving a refractive index profile<br>
for an optical fiber (Patent Documents 2 to 5 and 7) are reported. In theses techniques,<br>
 <br>
a change in optical characteristics in a longitudinal direction does not occur, However,<br>
a structure having a refractive index profile suitable for desired characteristics is needed.<br>
[0007]<br>
In Patent Documents 2, 3, and 5, for an optical fiber described which has a<br>
three-layer structured refractive index profile, the refractive index profile is set to a<br>
suitable condition, thereby suppressing SBS and obtaining the same optical<br>
characteristics as ITU-T Recommendation G.652 (hereinafter, referred to as G652).<br>
However, not all structures described in Patent Documents 2, 3, and 5 satisfy the same<br>
optical characteristics as G652, and when manufacturing is practically performed on the<br>
basis of these conditions, a suitable design value for each condition is needed.<br>
[0008]<br>
In Patent Document 4, a uniform bending loss becomes worse, and in<br>
consideration of handling of the optical fiber, this phenomenon is not preferable.<br>
In Patent Document 6, fluorine needs to be added at an intentional position, so<br>
that manufacturing a preform using a VAD method is difficult.<br>
In Patent Document 7, only the shape of a refractive index profile is described,<br>
and detailed parameters and the like are not mentioned.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
[0009]<br>
The invention is designed to solve the above-mentioned problems. An object<br>
of the invention is to provide an optical fiber and an optical fiber preform which have<br>

manufacturability, and suppressed SBS, by giving a structure design value for a suitable<br>

preform manufactured by a typical VAD method. However, the manufacturing method<br>
of the preform is not limited to the VAD method, and well-known OVD and CVD<br>
methods can be used.<br>

FIG 1 is a graph showing occurrences of SBS in an optical fiber. As shown in<br>
FIG. 1, when the power of light entering the optical fiber is gradually increased, at a<br>
specific value, the power of backscattered light sharply increases, and most of the power<br>
of the incoming light becomes backscattered light and returns to the incoming side.<br>
Therefore, as shown in FIG. 1, incoming light power at the maximum change rate<br>
(second-order differential equation of backscattered light) of a gradient of the<br>
backscattered light with respect to a change in the incoming light power is defined as a<br>
 <br>
threshold (SBS threshold) of an occurrence of SBS.<br>
[0016]<br>
FIG. 2 is a view illustrating a configuration of an SBS threshold measurement<br>
system. In FIG. 2, reference numeral 1 denotes a light source at a wavelength of 1.32 µm, reference numeral 2 denotes a light source at a wavelength of 1.55 µm, reference<br>
numeral 3 denotes an EDFA, reference numeral 4 denotes a power meter for measuring<br>
backscattered light power, reference numeral 5 denotes a 9:1 coupler, reference numeral<br>
6 denotes a power meter for measuring incoming light power, reference numeral 7<br>
denotes a power meter for measuring transmitted light power, and a reference numeral 8<br>
denotes an optical fiber to be measured. In this measurement system, the three power<br>
meters 4, 6, and 7 are connected through the 9:1 coupler 5 to measure the power of<br>
incoming light, backscattered light, and transmitted light of the optical fiber 8 to be<br>
measured. In addition, incoming light power at the maximum second-order differential<br>
equation of the backscattered light with respect to the incoming light becomes an SBS<br>
threshold.<br>
[0017]<br>
In Patent Documents 2 and 3, an SBS threshold is evaluated by using the same<br>
measurement system and definition. Here, the definition of the SBS threshold is<br>
considered as definition 4 in the following document.<br>
Shimizu, "A Study on Definition of the SBS Threshold in a Single-Mode Optical<br>
Fiber", Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers, General<br>
Conference in 2005, B-10-66.<br>
[0018]<br>
The SBS threshold is dependent on a mode field diameter (hereinafter, referred<br>
to as MFD). A plot result obtained by calculating the MFD dependence of the SBS<br>
 <br>
threshold of a single-mode optical fiber (hereinafter, referred to as SMF) which has a<br>
typical refractive index profile of step-index model as shown in FIG. 4 and satisfies the<br>
G652 standard is shown in FIG. 3. As shown in FIG. 3, in the range of 7.9 to 10.2 µm of an MFD at a wavelength of 1.31 µm that is in the G652 standard, the SBS threshold of<br>
the SMF changes in the range of 7.4 to 9.7 dBm. Accordingly, when the SBS threshold<br>
is compared, an optical fiber having the same MFD needs to be compared.<br>
[0019]<br>
The optical fiber of the invention has optical characteristics described in G652 in<br>
»<br>
that a cable cutoff wavelength is less than 1260 nm, an MFD at a wavelength of 1.31 µm<br>
is in the range of 7.9 to 10.2 µm, a zero-dispersion wavelength is in the range of 1300 to<br>
1324 nm, a zero-dispersion slope is equal to or less than 0.093 ps/(nm2km), a uniform<br>
bending loss is equal to or less than 2 dB/m at a bending diameter of 20 mm and a<br>
wavelength of 1.31 µm, and an SBS threshold is equal to or higher than two times (+3<br>
dB) that of an SMF having the same MFD.<br>
[0020]<br>
FIG. 5 is a view illustrating a first example of a refractive index profile of the<br>
optical fiber of the invention. The refractive index profile is constituted by: a<br>
three-layer structured core which includes, in the central portion of the core, a first core<br>
having a substantially uniform positive relative refractive index difference Δ1 in a region<br>
from the center of the core to a radius of Rl µm, a second core which surrounds and<br>
comes in contact with the first core and has a substantially uniform positive relative<br>
refractive index difference Δ2 in a region from the radius of Rl µm to a radius of R2 µm,<br>
and a third core which surrounds and comes in contact with the second core and has a<br>
substantially uniform positive relative refractive index difference Δ3 in a region from the<br>
 <br>
radius of R2 µm to a radius of R3 urn; and a cladding which surrounds and comes in<br>
contact with the three-layer structured core and has a substantially uniform refractive<br>
index, wherein Δ1&gt; Δ2 and Δ3&gt; Δ2.<br>
[0021]<br>
The refractive index profile of the optical fiber of the invention, as illustrated in<br>
FIG. 6, may allow relative refractive index differences not to have uniform values. FIG.<br>
6 is a view illustrating a second example of a refractive index profile of the optical fiber<br>
of the invention. The refractive index profile is constituted by: a three-layer structured<br>
core which includes, in the central portion of the core, a first core having a maximum<br>
relative refractive index difference Δ1 in a region from the center of the core to a radius<br>
of Rl µm, a second core which surrounds and comes in contact with the first core and<br>
has a minimum relative refractive index difference Δ2 in a region from the radius of Rl µm to a radius of R2 (am, and a third core which surrounds and comes in contact with the<br>
second core and has a maximum relative refractive index difference Δ3 in a region from<br>
the radius of R2 urn to a radius of R3 µm; and a cladding which surrounds and comes in<br>
contact with the three-layer structured core and has a substantially uniform refractive<br>
index, wherein Δ1&gt; Δ2 and Δ3&gt; Δ2.<br>
[0022]<br>
For the optical fiber having the refractive index profile constituted by the<br>
three-layer structured core and the one-layer structured cladding for surrounding the core,<br>
in order to obtain an optical fiber which has the above-mentioned optical characteristics,<br>
that is, characteristics compatible with G652 and an SBS threshold equal to or higher<br>
than two times that of (by +3 db) the SMF having the same MFD as the optical fiber of<br>
the invention, detailed examinations were repeated. As a result, it was found that<br>
 <br>
relationships between Δ1, Δ2, A3, Rl, R2, and R3 were limited.<br>
[0023]<br>
FIG. 7 is a view showing a relationship of a SBS suppression effect SBSeff on<br>
an SMF when Δ1 -A2=X and Δ3-Δ2=Y. Here, SBSeff is defined by the following<br>
expression.<br>
SBSeff=SBS threshold of the optical fiber of the invention-SBS threshold of the<br>
SMF having the same MFD as the optical fiber of the invention<br>
[0024]<br>
As can be seen from FIG. 7, by allowing X+Y to be greater than 0.4%, it is<br>
possible to improve SBSeff to be equal to or higher than +3 dB and increase the SBS<br>
threshold. However, by only using the condition, in some cases, an optical fiber having<br>
the optical characteristics compatible with the G652 cannot be obtained.<br>
Specifically, in order to obtain an optical fiber having a zero-dispersion<br>
wavelength in the range of 1300 to 1324 nm, it is preferable that X and Y have<br>
relationships of X
relationships of X and Y satisfying this condition are shown in FIG. 8.<br>
[0025]<br>
In addition, in order to allow the MFD at the wavelength of 1.31 µm to be 7.9<br>
µm, that is, the lower limit of the G652 standard, or greater, while the condition is<br>
satisfied, it is preferable that Δ2 be equal to or less than 0.4%. In addition, in order to<br>
allow the MFD at the wavelength of 1.31 µm to be in the range of 7.9 to 10.2 µm, the<br>
position of the third core in the radial direction represented as R2/R1 needs to be suitably<br>
determined depending on the sum of Δ2 and A3, that is, Δ2+Δ3.<br>
[0026]<br>
 <br>
In order to obtain an optical fiber for enabling the MFD at the wavelength of<br>
1.31 µm to be in the range of 7.9 to 10.2 µm, it is preferable that (Δ2+Δ3) and R2/R1<br>
satisfy relationships of (Δ2+Δ3)+1.0<r2 and the></r2>
relationships between (Δ2+Δ3) and R2/R1 satisfying the condition are shown in FIG. 9.<br>
[0027]<br>
In addition, from the point of manufacturability of an optical fiber, it is<br>
preferable that Δ3&gt; Δ1.<br>
FIG. 10 is a view showing a relationship between A3-A1 and SBSeff. As<br>
shown in FIG. 10, when A3-A1 is negative, SBSeff significantly changes with a slight<br>
change in relative refractive index difference. On the other hand, when A3-A1 is<br>
positive, the change rate of SBSeff with respect to the change in relative refractive index<br>
difference is small. In addition, when SBSeff is approximated to a quadratic equation of<br>
A3-A1, the approximation curve is a parabola which opens down, and the inflection point<br>
is A3- Δ1&gt;0. It can be seen that the effect of SBSeff caused by the change in relative<br>
refractive index difference is small when A3-A1 is positive.<br>
When an optical fiber preform is manufactured, in some cases, due to fluctuation<br>
in dopant concentration, the relative refractive index difference is changed from a target<br>
by about ±0.05%. In this case, there is a possibility that SBSeff is decreased to be lower<br>
than a target. When A3-A1 is positive, the change rate of SBSeff caused by the change<br>
in relative refractive index difference is small. Therefore, SBSeff does not significantly<br>
change with respect to the change in relative refractive index difference caused by the<br>
fluctuation in dopant concentration, and SBS characteristics that are always stable can be<br>
obtained.<br>
In addition, in the refractive index profile of FIG. 10, Δ1 is 0.5%, Δ2 is 0.22%,<br>
 <br>
A3 is in the range of 0.40 to 0.65% at an interval of 0.025%, and R2/R1 is 2.2.<br>
However, as shown in Table 1, in other combinations of Δ1, Δ2, A3, Rl, R2, and R3, the<br>
inflection point is A3- Δ1&gt;0, and it can be seen that SBS characteristics which are always<br>
stable can be obtained when A3-A1 is positive.<br>
It is preferable that Δ1 -A2 be equal to or greater than 0.25%. FIG. 11 is a view<br>
showing a relationship between Al-A2 and SBSeff. As shown in FIG. 11, when Δ1 is<br>
greater than Δ2 by 0.25% or higher, SBSeff can be significantly increased as compared<br>
with the case where the difference between Δ1 and Δ2 is equal to or smaller than 0.25%,<br>
thereby obtaining a higher SBS suppression effect. In addition, when Δ1 -A2 is equal to<br>
or greater than 0.25%, the effect of the change in relative refractive index difference<br>
caused by fluctuation in dopant concentration during manufacturing of the optical fiber<br>
preform is reduced. Therefore, even when Δ1-Δ2 is changed, SBSeff does not change<br>
significantly, and degradation in yield can be prevented.<br>
In the refractive index profile of FIG 11, Δ1 is in the range of 0.44% to 0.56% at<br>
an interval of 0.03%, Δ2 is 0.24%, Δ3 is 0.55%, and R2/R1 is 2.2. However, as shown<br>
in FIG. 12, in a refractive index profile using other combinations of Δ1, Δ2, A3, Rl, R2,<br>
and R3, that is, when Δ1 is in the range of 0.44% to 0.56%, Δ2 is in the range of 0.18%<br>
to 0.26%, Δ3 is in the range of 0.45% to 0.65%, and R2/R1 is in the range of 1.8 to 2.6,<br>
the same tendency can be obtained. Particularly, in a refractive index profile in which<br>
Δ1-Δ2 is equal to or greater than 0.25%, a higher SBS suppression effect can be obtained,<br>
and dependence of SBSeff on a change in Δ1-Δ2 is reduced.<br>

In addition, by disposing the third core as described above, it is possible to<br>
obtain the SBS threshold higher than that of a conventional optical fiber by +3 dB or<br>
higher and obtain characteristics compatible with the G652.<br>

[0038]<br>
Examples 3 and 4<br>
FIG. 17 shows a refractive index profile of an optical fiber of Example 3 related<br>
to the invention. The refractive index profile in Example 3, as shown in FIG. 17, is<br>
constituted by: a three-layer structured core which includes, in the central portion of the<br>
core, a first core in a region from the center of the core to a radius of Rl µm, a second<br>
core which surrounds and comes in contact with the first core in a region from the radius<br>
of Rl µm to a radius of R2 µm, and a third core which surrounds and comes in contact<br>
with the second core in a region from the radius of R2 µm to a radius of R3 µm; and a<br>
cladding which surrounds and comes in contact with the three-layer structured core.<br>
However, unlike in Examples 1 and 2, the refractive index profile of the core smoothly<br>
changes, and the boundary thereof is obscure. Therefore, by using the change rate<br>
(dA/dr) of the relative refractive index difference in the radial direction, the diameter of<br>
each layer was determined. The relative refractive index difference Δ1 of the first core,<br>
as represented by the following equation (1), is defined as A which becomes equivalently<br>
uniform in the region from the center of the core to the radius Rl, the relative refractive<br>
index difference Δ2 of the second core is defined as a relative refractive index difference<br>
that becomes a minimum value in the region between the radii Rl and R2 µm, and the<br>
relative refractive index difference Δ3 of the third core is defined as a relative refractive<br>
index difference that becomes a maximum value in the region between the radii R2 and<br>
R3 µm.<br>

than the SMF having the same MFD by +3.5 to +4.0 dB. In addition, the optical fibers<br>

from the center of the core to a radius of Rl µm, a second core which surrounds and<br>
comes in contact with the first core and has a substantially uniform positive relative<br>
refractive index difference Δ2 in a region from the radius of Rl µm to a radius of R2 µm,<br>
and a third core which surrounds and comes in contact with the second core and has a<br>
substantially uniform positive relative refractive index difference Δ3 in a region from the<br>
radius of R2 µm to a radius of R3µm. Like Examples 1 and 2, the three-layer<br>
structured core is included.<br>

effect higher than the SMF having the same MFD by +3.1 to +4.5 dB, so that the G652<br>

having a maximum relative refractive index difference Δ1 in a region from the center of<br>
the core to a radius of Rl µm, a second core which surrounds and comes in contact with<br>
the first core and has a minimum relative refractive index difference Δ2 in a region from<br>

FIG. 22 shows a refractive index profile of an optical fiber preform of Example 7.<br>
The optical fiber preform in this example, as shown in FIG. 22, is constituted by: a<br>

Industrial Applicability<br>
[0046]<br>
According to the invention, for the optical fiber having a segment-core type<br>
refractive index profile, the relationships between the relative refractive index differences<br>
 Δ1, Δ2, and Δ3 of the layers are suitably designed, and the position of the third core is<br>
suitably determined. Therefore, it is possible to increase an SBS threshold by +3 dB or<br>
higher as compared with the SMF having the same MFD while maintaining the optical<br>
characteristics described in G652.<br>
In addition, by allowing the relative refractive index difference of the third core<br>
to be greater than that of the first core, it is possible to improve manufacturability of the<br>
optical fiber preform.<br>
