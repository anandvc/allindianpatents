Cross Reference to Related Applications<br>
This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Serial Number 60/357,029, filed February 14, 2002, and U.S. Provisional Application Serial Number 60/436,915, filed December 30, 2002, the disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The instant invention relates to substituted pyridinones that are useful for treating diseases and conditions caused or exacerbated by unregulated p3 8 MAP kinase activity. Pharmaceutical compositions containing the pyridinone compounds, methods of preparing the pyridone compounds and methods of treatment using the compcunds are also disclosed.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Numerous cell surface receptors use one or more of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) cascades during signal transduction.  MAP kinases are a family of protein-directed serine/threonine kinases that are activated by dual phosphorylation.  One subgroup of the MAP kinases is p38 MAP kinase, which is activated by a variety of signals including proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), as well as bacterial lipopolysaccharides and environmental stress such as osmotic shock and ultraviolet radiation (One, K. and J. Han, Cell Signal. 12: 1, 2000).  Within the p38 kinase family, there are four distinct isozymes: p38 alpha, p38 beta, p38 gamma, and p38 delta.  The p38 kinase family function downstream of an activating stimulus by phosphorylating and activating transcription factors (e.g. ATF2, CHOP and MEF2C) as well as<br>
ases (e.g. MAPKAP-2 and MAPKAP-3) (Trends ir. Cell<br>
biclogy 7, 353-351, 1997/Mol Cell Biology 19, 21-30, 1399;<br>
EMBO J 20, 466-479, 2001). Upon activation, the p33 kinase<br>
cascade leads to the induction of gene expression of several<br>
factors involved in inflammation and immunity including TNF,<br>
interleukin-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating<br>
factor (GM-CSF), and HIV long terminal repeat (Paul et al.,<br>
Cell Signal. 9: 403-410, 1997). The products of the p38<br>
phosphorylation stimulate the production of inflammatory<br>
cytokines and other proteins, including TNF and IL-1, and<br>
cyclooxygenase-2, and also possibly modulate the effects of<br>
these cytokines on their target cells, and thus stimulate<br>
inflammation processes (Lee, J.C. et al, Nature, 372: 376,<br>
1994).<br>
P38 MAP kinases have also been shown to promote apoptosis<br>
during ischemia in cardiac myocytes, which suggests that p38<br>
MAP kinase inhibitors can be used to treat ischemic heart<br>
disease (J. 3iol. Chem. 274, 6272, 1999). They are also<br>
required for T-cell HIV-1 replication and may be useful<br>
targets for AIDS therapy. P38 pathway inhibitors have been<br>
used to increase cancer cell sensitivity to cancer therapy<br>
also find use in the treatment of asthma (JPET 293, 281,<br>
2000) .<br>
TNF is a cytokine and a potent proinflammatory mediator<br>
implicated in inflammatory conditions such as arthritis,<br>
asthma, septic shock, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus,<br>
multiple sclerosis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.<br>
Thus inhibitors of p38 MAP kinases (required for TNF<br>
production) may be useful for the treatment of inflammatoryconditions<br>
resulting from excessive cytokine production such<br>
as arthritis. (Boehm, J.C. and J.L. Adams, Exp. Opin. Ther.<br>
Patents 10: 25, 2000, and references cited therein). TNF has<br>
also been implicated in viral infections, such as HIV,<br>
influenza virus, and herpes virus including herpes simplex<br>
virus cype-i (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2),<br>
cytomecaiovirus (CMV), varicella-roster virus (VZV), Epstein-<br>
Barr virus, human herpesvirus-6 (HKV-6), human herpesvirus-7<br>
(HHV-7), human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-6), pseudorabies and<br>
rhinctracheitis, among others.<br>
Excessive or unregulated TNF production has also been<br>
shown to produce elevated levels of IL-1. Inhibition of TNF,<br>
therefore, should reduce levels of IL-1 (European Cytokine<br>
Netw 6, 225, 1995) and ameliorate disease states caused by<br>
unregulated IL-1 synthesis. Such disease states include<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis,<br>
gouty arthritis, sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram<br>
negative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, adult respiratory<br>
distress syndrome, cerebral malaria, chronic pulmonary<br>
inflammatory disease, silicosis, pulmonary sarcosis, bone<br>
resorption diseases, reperfusion injury, graft versus host<br>
reaction, alallograft rejections, fever and myalgias due to<br>
infection, cachexia secondary to infection or malignancy,<br>
cachexia secondary to acquired immune deficiency syndrome<br>
(AIDS), AIDS related complex (ARC), keloid formation, scar<br>
tissue formation, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and<br>
pyresis.<br>
IL-1 has also been shown to mediate a. variety of<br>
biological activities such as the activation of T-helper<br>
cells, induction of fever, stimulation of prostaglandin or<br>
collagenase production, neutrophil chemotaxis, and the<br>
suppression of plasma iron levels (Rev. Infect. Disease, 6, 51<br>
(1984)). Elevated levels of IL-1 have also been implicated in<br>
mediating or exacerbating a number of disease states including<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis,<br>
gouty arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, adult respiratory<br>
distress syndrome (ARDS), psoriasis, Crohn's disease,<br>
ulcerative colitis, anaphylaxis, muscle degeneration,<br>
cachexia, Reiter's syndrome, type I and type II diabetes, bone<br>
resorption diseases, ischemia reperfusicn injury,<br>
arteriosclerosis, brain trauma, multiple sclerosis, sepsis,<br>
septic shock, and toxic shock syndrome. Viruses sensitive to<br>
TNF inhibition, such as HIV-1, HIV-2, HIV-3, are also affected<br>
by IL-1 production. In rheumatoid arthritis, both IL-1 and<br>
TNF induce collagenase synthesis and ultimately lead to tissue<br>
destruction within arthritic joints (Lywphokine Cytokine Res.<br>
(11): 253-256, (1992) and Clin. Exp. Imwunol. 989:244-250,<br>
(1992)).<br>
IL-6 is another pro-inflammatory cytokine, which is<br>
associated with many conditions including inflammation.<br>
Consequently, TNF, IL-1 and IL-6 affect a wide variety of<br>
cells and tissues and are important inflammatory mediators of<br>
a wide variety of disease states and conditions. The<br>
inhibition of these cytokines by inhibition or modulation of<br>
p38 kinase is of benefit in controlling, reducing and<br>
alleviating many of these disease states and conditions.<br>
Therefore, the present invention concerns finding small<br>
molecule inhibitors or modulators of p38 kinase and the p38<br>
kinase pathway.<br>

and naphthyl. The most preferred aryl group is phenyl. The<br>
aryl groups herein are unsubstituted or, as specified,<br>
substituted in one or more substitutable positions with<br>
various groups. Thus, such aryl groups can be optionally<br>
substituted with groups such as, for example, Ci-C« alkyl, Ci-C6<br>

The term "heterocycloalkyl," refers to a non-aromatic<br>
ring system containing at least one heteroatom selected from<br>
nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, wherein the non-aromatic<br>
heterocycle is attached to the core. The heterocycloalkyl<br>
ring may be optionally fused to or otherwise attached to other<br>
heterocycloalkyl rings, aromatic heterocycles, aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons and/or non-aromatic hydrocarbon rings. Preferred<br>
heterocycloalkyl groups have from 3 to 7 members. Examples of<br>
heterocycloalkyl groups include, for example, piperazine,<br>
1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, morpholine, piperidine,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, pyrrolidine, and pyrazole. Preferred<br>
heterocycloalkyl groups include piperidinyl, piperazinyl,<br>
morpholinyl, and pyrolidinyl. The heterocycloalkyl groups<br>
herein are unsubstituted or, as specified, substituted in one<br>
or more substitutable positions with various groups. Thus,<br>
such heterocycloalkyl groups can be optionally substituted<br>
with groups such as, for example, Ci-C6 alkyl, Ci-C6 alkoxy,<br>
halogen, hydroxy, cyano, nitro, amino, mono- or di-(Ci-<br>
C6) alkyl amino, C2-C6alkenyl, C2-C6alkynyl, Ci-C6 haloalkyl, Ci-Cg<br>
haloalkoxy, amino (Ci-Cg) alkyl, mono- or di (Ci-Cfi) alkyl amino (Ci-<br>
C6) alkyl.<br>
The term "heteroaryl" refers to an aromatic ring system<br>
containing at least one heteroatom selected from nitrogen,<br>
oxygen, and sulfur. The heteroaryl ring may be fused or<br>
otherwise attached to one or more heteroaryl rings, aromatic<br>
or non-aromatic hydrocarbon rings or heterocycloalkyl. rings.<br>
Examples of heteroaryl groups include, for example, pyridine,<br>
furan, thiophene, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroisoquinoline and<br>
pyrimidine. Preferred examples of heteroaryl groups include<br>
thienyl, benzothienyl, pyridyl, quinolyl, pyrazinyl,<br>
pyrimidyl, imidazolyl, benzimidazolyl, furanyl, benzofuranyl,<br>
thiazolyl, benzothiazolyl, isoxazolyl, oxadiazolyl,<br>
isothiazolyl, benzisothiazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl,<br>
pyrrolyl, indolyl, pyrasolyl, and benzopyrazolyl. Preferred<br>
heteroaryl groups include pyridyl. The heteroaryl groups<br>
herein are unsubstituted or, as specified, substituted in one<br>
or more substitutable positions with various groups. Thus,<br>
such heteroaryl groups can be optionally substituted with<br>
groups such as, for example, Ci-C6 alkyl, d-CB- alkoxy, halogen,<br>
hydroxy, cyano, nitro, amino, mono- or di-(Ci-C6) alkylamino,<br>
C2-C6alkenyl, C2-C6alkynyl, d-C6 haloalkyl, d-C6 haloalkoxy,<br>
amino (d-Cs) alkyl, mono- or di (Ci-C6) alkylamino (d-Cs) alkyl.<br>
The term "heteroarylalkyl" refers to a heteroaryl group,<br>
as defined above, attached to the parent molecular moiety<br>
through an alkyl group, as defined above. Preferred<br>
heteroarylalkyl groups include, pyrazolemethyl, pyrazoleethyl,<br>
pyridylmethyl, pyridylethyl, thiazolemethyl, thiazoleethyl,<br>
imidazolemethyl, imidazoleethyl, thienylmethyl, thienylethyl,<br>
furanylmethyl, furanylethyl, isoxazolemethyl, isoxazoleethyl,<br>
pyrazinemethyl and pyrazineethyl. More preferred<br>
heteroarylalkyl groups include pyridylmethyl and pyridylethyl.<br>
The heteroaryl portions of these groups are unsubstituted or,<br>
as specified, substituted in one or more substitutable<br>
positions with various groups. Thus, such heteroaryl groups<br>
can be optionally substituted with groups such as, for<br>
example, d-Cg alkyl, d-d alkoxy, halogen, hydroxy, cyano,<br>
nitro, amino, mono- or di- (d-Cfi) alkylamino, C2-Csalkenyl, d-<br>
C6alkynyl, d-C6 haloalkyl, d-C6 haloalkoxy, amino (d-C6) alkyl,<br>
mono- or di (d-Cg) alkylamino(d-Cg) alkyl.<br>
If two or more of the same substituents are on a common<br>
atom, e.g., di (d-Cg) alkylamino, it is understood that the<br>
nature of each group is independent of the other.<br>
As used herein, the term "p38 mediated disorder" refers<br>
to any and all disorders and disease states in which p38 plays<br>
a role, either by control of p38 itself, or by p38 causing<br>
another factor to be released, such as but not limited to IL-<br>
1, IL-6 or IL-8. A disease state in which, for instance, IL-1<br>
is a major component, and whose production or action, is<br>
exacerbated or secreted in response to p38, would therefore be<br>
considered a disorder mediated by p38.<br>
As TNF-beta has close structural homology with TNF-alpha<br>
(also known as cachectin), and since each induces similar<br>
biologic responses and binds to the same cellular receptor,<br>
the synthesis of both TNF-alpha and TNF-beta are inhibited by<br>
the compounds of the present invention and thus are herein<br>
referred to collectively as "TNF" unless specifically<br>
delineated otherwise.<br>
Non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but<br>
are not limited to salts of inorganic acids such as<br>
hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, diphosphoric, hydrobromic,<br>
and nitric or salts of organic acids such as formic, citric,<br>
malic, maleic, fumaric, tartaric, succinic, acetic, lactic,<br>
methanesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, 2-hydroxyethylsulfonic,<br>
salicylic and stearic. Similarly, pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
cations include, but are not limited to sodium, potassium,<br>
calcium, aluminum, lithium and ammonium. Those skilled in the<br>
art will recognize a wide variety of non-toxic<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts.<br>
The compounds of this invention may contain one or more<br>
asymmetric carbon atoms, so that the compounds can exist in<br>
different stereoisomeric forms. These compounds can be, for<br>
example, racemates, chiral non-racemic or diastereomers. In<br>
these situations, the single enantiomers, i.e., optically<br>
active forms, can be obtained by asymmetric synthesis or by<br>
resolution of the racemates. Resolution of the racemates can<br>
be accomplished, for example, by conventional methods such as<br>
crystallization in the presence of a resolving agent;<br>
chromatography, using, for example a chiral HPLC column; or<br>
derivatizing the racemic mixture with a resolving reagent to<br>
generate diastereomers, separating the diastereomers via<br>
chromatography or selective crystallization, and removing the<br>
resolving agent to generate the original compound in<br>
er.anticnerically enriched form. Any of the above procedures<br>
can be repeated to increase the enantiomeric purity of a<br>
compound .<br>
The compounds of the invention may exist as atropisomers,<br>
i.e., chiral rotational isomers. The invention encompasses<br>
the racemic and the resolved atropisomers . The following<br>
illustration generically shows a compound (Z) that can exist<br>
as atropisomers as well as its two possible atropisomers (A)<br>
and (B) . This illustration also shows each of atropisomers<br>
(A) and (B) in a Fischer projection. In this illustration, RI,<br>
R2, and R4 carry the same definitions as set forth for Formula<br>
I, RP' is a substituent within the definition of RS, and Rp is a<br>
non-hydrogen substituent within the definition of Rs <br>
When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double<br>
bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless<br>
otherwise specified, it is intended that the compounds include<br>
the cis, trans, Z- and E- configurations. Likewise, all<br>
tautomeric forms are also intended to be included.<br>
The compounds of general Formula I may be administered<br>
orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation or spray or<br>
rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional<br>
non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and<br>
vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes<br>
percutaneous, subcutaneous, intravascular (e.g., intravenous),<br>
intramuscular, or intrathecal injection or infusion techniques<br>
and the like. In addition, there is provided a pharmaceutical<br>
formulation comprising a compound of general Formula I and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. One or more compounds of<br>
general Formula I may be present in association with one or<br>
more non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or<br>
diluents and/or adjuvants, and if desired other active<br>
ingredients. The pharmaceutical compositions containing<br>
compounds of general Formula I may be in a form suitable for<br>
oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous<br>
or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules,<br>
emulsion, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs.<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition<br>
may be in the form of, for example, a tablet, hard or soft<br>
capsule, lozenges, dispensable powders/ suspension, or liquid.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition is preferably made in the form<br>
of a dosage unit containing a particular amount of the active<br>
ingredient. Examples of such dosage units are tablets or<br>
capsules.<br>
Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared<br>
according to any method known to the art for the manufacture<br>
of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may<br>
contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting<br>
of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and<br>
preservative agents in order to provide pharmaceutically<br>
elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the<br>
active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients that are suitable for the manufacture of<br>
tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents,<br>
such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium<br>
phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating<br>
agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding<br>
agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating<br>
agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc.<br>
The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known<br>
techniques. In some cases such coatings may be prepared by<br>
known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the<br>
gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action<br>
over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such<br>
as glyceryl monosterate or glyceryl distearate may be<br>
employed.<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard<br>
gelatin capsules, wherein the active ingredient is mixed with<br>
an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate,<br>
calcium phosphate, or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules<br>
wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil<br>
medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as<br>
lozenges.<br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in<br>
admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of<br>
aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents,<br>
for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose,<br>
hydropropyl-rnethylcellulose, sodium alginate,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia;<br>
dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring<br>
phosphatide, for example, lecithin, or condensation products<br>
of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example<br>
polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene<br>
oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example<br>
heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of<br>
ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids<br>
and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or<br>
condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters<br>
derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example<br>
polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may<br>
also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, orn-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one<br>
or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents,<br>
such as sucrose or saccharin.<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the<br>
active ingredients in a vegetable oil, for example arachis<br>
oil, olive oil, sesame oil, or coconut oil, or in a mineral<br>
oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain<br>
a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin, or<br>
cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents and flavoring agents may be<br>
added to provide palatable oral preparations. These<br>
compositions may be preserved by the addition of an antioxidant<br>
such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation<br>
of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the<br>
active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting<br>
agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives.<br>
Suitable dispersing or wetting agents or suspending agents are<br>
exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional<br>
excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring, and coloring<br>
agents, may also be present.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be<br>
the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be<br>
i vegetable oil or a mineral oil or mixtures of these.<br>
Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums,<br>
for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring<br>
phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters cr<br>
oartial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol,<br>
anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation<br>
products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for<br>
example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions<br>
may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents.<br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening<br>
agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol,<br>
glucose or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a<br>
demulcent, a preservative, and flavoring and coloring agents.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a<br>
sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This<br>
suspension may be formulated according to the known art using<br>
those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending<br>
agents that have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable<br>
preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or<br>
suspension in a non-toxic parentally acceptable diluent or<br>
solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among<br>
the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are<br>
water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride<br>
solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally<br>
employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose<br>
any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic monoor<br>
diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid<br>
find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
The compounds of general Formula I may also be<br>
administered in the form of suppositories, e.g., for rectal<br>
administration of the drug. These compositions can be<br>
prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating<br>
excipient that is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at<br>
the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum<br>
to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter and<br>
polyethylene glycols.<br>
Compounds of general Formula I may be administered<br>
parenterally in a sterile medium. The drug, depending on the<br>
vehicle and concentration used, can either be suspended or<br>
dissolved in the vehicle. Advantageously, adjuvants such as<br>
local anesthetics, preservatives, and buffering agents can be<br>
dissolved in the vehicle.<br>
The active ingredient may also be administered by<br>
injection (IV, IM, subcutaneous or jet) as a composition<br>
wherein, for example, saline, dextrose, or water may be used<br>
as a suitable carrier. The pH of the composition may be<br>
adjusted, if necessary, with suitable acid, base, or buffer.<br>
Suitable bulking, dispersing, wetting or suspending agents,<br>
including mannitol and PEG 400, may also be included in the<br>
composition. A suitable parenteral composition can also<br>
include a compound formulated as a sterile solid substance,<br>
including lyophilized powder, in injection vials. Aqueous<br>
solution can be added to dissolve the compound prior to<br>
injection.<br>
For disorders of the eye or other external tissues, e.g.,<br>
mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a<br>
topical gel, spray, ointment or cream, or as a suppository,<br>
containing the active ingredients in a total amount of, for<br>
example, 0.075 to 30% w/w, preferably 0.2 to 20% w/w and most<br>
preferably 0.4 to 15% w/w. When formulated in an ointment, the<br>
active ingredients may be employed with either paraffinic or a<br>
water-miscible ointment base.<br>
Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated<br>
in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base. If desired, the<br>
aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example at<br>
least 30% w/w of a polyhydric alcohol such as propylene<br>
glycol, butane-l,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glyceroi,<br>
polyethylene glycol and mixtures thereof. The topical<br>
formulation may desirably include a compound, which enhances<br>
absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the<br>
skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal<br>
penetration enhancers include dimethylsulfoxide and related<br>
analogs. The compounds of this invention can also be<br>
administered by a transdermal device. Preferably topical<br>
administration will be accomplished using a patch either of<br>
the reservoir and porous membrane type or of a solid matrix<br>
variety. In either case, the active agent is delivered<br>
continuously from the reservoir or microcapsules through a<br>
membrane into the active agent permeable adhesive, which is in<br>
contact with the skin or mucosa of the recipient. If the<br>
active agent is absorbed through the skin, a controlled and<br>
predetermined flow of the active agent is administered to the<br>
recipient. In the case of microcapsules, the encapsulating<br>
agent may also function as the membrane. The transdermal patch<br>
may include the compound in a suitable solvent system with an<br>
adhesive system, such as an acrylic emulsion, and a polyester<br>
patch. The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may<br>
be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner.<br>
While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier, it may<br>
comprise a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or<br>
oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic<br>
emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier,<br>
which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include<br>
both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or<br>
without stabilizer(s) make-up the so-called emulsifying wax,<br>
and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the socalled<br>
emulsifying ointment base, which forms the oily,<br>
lispersed phase of the cream formulations. Emulsifiers and<br>
5tnulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of<br>
the present invention include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl<br>
alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate, and sodium<br>
lauryl sulfate, among others. The choice of suitable oils or<br>
fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired<br>
cosmetic properties, since the solubility of the active<br>
compound in most oils likely to be used in pharmaceutical<br>
emulsion formulations is very low. Thus, the cream should<br>
preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable product<br>
with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other<br>
containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl<br>
esters such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene<br>
glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate,<br>
decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-<br>
ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters may<br>
be used. These may be used alone or in combination depending<br>
on the properties required. Alternatively, high melting point<br>
lipids such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or<br>
other mineral oils can be used.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration to the<br>
eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredients are<br>
dissolved or suspended in suitable carrier, especially an<br>
aqueous solvent for the active ingredients. The antiinflammatory<br>
active ingredients are preferably present in such<br>
formulations in a concentration of 0.5 to 20%, advantageously<br>
0.5 to 10% and particularly about 1.5% w/w. For therapeutic<br>
purposes, the active compounds of this combination invention<br>
are ordinarily combined with one or more adjuvants appropriate<br>
to the indicated route of administration. If administered per<br>
os, the compounds may be admixed with lactose, sucrose, starch<br>
powder, cellulose esters of alkanoic acids, cellulose alkyl<br>
esters, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, magnesium<br>
oxide, sodium and calcium salts of phosphoric and sulfuric<br>
acids, gelatin, acacia gum, sodium alginate,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, and/or polyvinyl alcohol, and then<br>
tableted or encapsulated for convenient administration. Such<br>
capsules or tablets may contain a controlled-release<br>
formulation as may be provided in a dispersion of active<br>
compound in hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. Formulations for<br>
parenteral administration may be in the form of aqueous or<br>
non-aqueous isotonic sterile injection solutions or<br>
suspensions. These solutions and suspensions may be prepared<br>
from sterile powders or granules having one or more of the<br>
carriers or diluents mentioned for use in the formulations for<br>
oral administration. The compounds may be dissolved in water,<br>
polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethanol, corn oil,<br>
cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, benzyl alcohol, sodium<br>
chloride, and/or various buffers. Other adjuvants and modes of<br>
administration are well and widely known in the pharmaceutical<br>
art.<br>
The amount of therapeutically active compounds that are<br>
administered and the dosage regimen for treating a disease<br>
condition with the compounds and/or compositions of this<br>
invention depends on a variety of factors, including the age,<br>
weight, sex and medical condition of the subject, the severity<br>
of the inflammation or inflammation related disorder, the<br>
route and frequency of administration, and the particular<br>
compound employed, and thus may vary widely. The<br>
pharmaceutical compositions may contain active ingredients in<br>
the range of about 0.1 to 1000 mg, preferably in the range of<br>
about 7.0 to 350 mg. A daily dose of about 0.01 to 100 mg/kg<br>
body weight, preferably between about 0.1 and .about 50 mg/kg<br>
body weight and most preferably between about 0.5 to 30 mg/kg<br>
body weight, may be appropriate. The daily dose can be<br>
administered in one to four doses per day. In the case of skin<br>
conditions, it may be preferable to apply a topical<br>
preparation of compounds of this invention to the affected<br>
area two to four times a day.<br>
It will be understood, however, that the specific dose<br>
level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of<br>
factors including the activity of the specific compound<br>
employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet,<br>
time of administration, route of administration, and rate of<br>
excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular<br>
disease undergoing therapy.<br>
For administration to non-human animals, the composition<br>
may also be added to the animal feed or drinking water. It may<br>
be convenient to formulate the animal feed and drinking water<br>
compositions so that the animal takes in a therapeutically<br>
appropriate quantity of the composition along with its diet.<br>
It may also be convenient to present the composition as a<br>
premix for addition to the feed or drinking water.<br>

General Synthetic Procedures<br>
Representative procedures for the preparation of<br>
compounds of the invention are outlined below in the Schemes<br>
The starting materials can be purchased or prepared using<br>
methods known to those skilled in the art. Similarly, the<br>
preparation of the various intermediates can be achieved using<br>
methods known in the art. The starting materials may be<br>
varied and additional steps employed to produce compounds<br>
encompassed by the invention, as demonstrated by the examples<br>
below. In addition, different solvents and reagents can<br>
typically be used to achieve the above transformations.<br>
Protection of reactive groups may also be necessary to achieve<br>
the above transformations. In general, the need for<br>
protecting groups, as well as the conditions necessary to<br>
attach and remove such groups, will be apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art of organic synthesis. When a protecting<br>
group is employed, deprotection will generally be required.<br>
Suitable protecting groups and methodology for protection and<br>
deprotection such as those described in Protecting Groups in<br>
Organic Synthesis by Greene and Wuts are known and appreciated<br>
in the art.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the instant invention can<br>

The invention is illustrated further by the following<br>
examples, which are not to be construed as limiting the<br>
invention in scope or spirit to the specific procedures<br>
described in them. Those having skill in the art will<br>
recognize that the starting materials may be varied and<br>
additional steps employed to produce compounds encompassed by<br>
the invention, as demonstrated by the following examples.<br>
Those skilled in the art will also recognize that it may be<br>
necessary to utilize different solvents or reagents to achieve<br>
some of the above transformations. In some cases, protection<br>
of reactive functionalities may be necessary to achieve the<br>
above transformations. In general, such need for protecting<br>
groups, as well as the conditions necessary to attach and<br>
remove such groups, will be apparent to those skilled in the<br>
art of organic synthesis. When a protecting group is<br>
employed, adeprotection step may be required. Suitable<br>
protecting groups and methodology for protection and<br>
deprotection such as those described in Protecting Groups in<br>
Organic Synthesis by Greene and Wuts are well known and<br>
appreciated in the art.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, all reagents and solvents are<br>
of standard commercial grade and are used without further<br>
purification. The appropriate atmosphere to run the reaction<br>
under, for example, air, nitrogen, hydrogen, argon and the<br>
like, will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>

BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION<br>
p38 Kinase Assay<br>
Cloning of human p38a:<br>
The coding region of the human p38a cDNA was obtained by<br>
PCR-amplification from RNA isolated from the human monocyte<br>
cell line THP.l. First strand CDNA was synthesized from total<br>
RNA as follows: 2 /xg of RNA was annealed to 100 ng of random<br>
hexamer primers in a 10 /xl reaction by heating to 70° C. for 10<br>
minutes followed by 2 minutes on ice. cDNA was then<br>
synthesized by adding 1 M! of RNAsin (Promega, Madison Wis.),<br>
2 Ml of 50 mM dNTP's, 4 jzl of 5X buffer, 2 /il of 100 mM DTT<br>
and 1 Ml (200 U) of Superscript II™ AMV reverse transcriptase.<br>
Random primer, dNTP's and Superscript II™ reagents were all<br>
purchased from Life-Technologies, Gaithersburg, Mass. The<br>
reaction was incubated at 42° C. for 1 hour. Amplification of<br>
p38 cDNA was performed by aliquoting 5 M! of the reverse<br>
-902-<br>
transcriptase reaction into a 100 M! PCR reaction containing<br>
the following: 80 pi dH.sub.2 0, 2 . 1 50 mM dNTP's, 1 p.1<br>
each of forward and reverse primers (50 pmol//il) , 10 Ml of 10X<br>
buffer and 1 M! Expand™ polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) . The<br>
PCR primers incorporated Bam HI sites onto the 5' and 3' end<br>
of the amplified fragment, and were purchased from Genosys.<br>
The sequences of the forward and reverse primers were 5' <br>
amplification was carried out in a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin<br>
Elmer) by repeating 30 cycles of 94° C. for 1 minute, 60° C.<br>
for 1 minute and 68° C. for 2 minutes. After amplification,<br>
excess primers and unincorporated dNTP's were removed from the<br>
amplified fragment with a Wizard™ PCR prep (Promega) and<br>
digested with Bam HI (New England Biolabs) . The Bam HI<br>
digested fragment was ligated into BamHI digested pGEX 2T<br>
plasmid DNA (PharmaciaBiotech) using T-4 DNA ligase (New<br>
England Biolabs) as described by T. Maniatis, Molecular<br>
Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed. (1989) . The ligation<br>
reaction was transformed into chemically competent E. coli<br>
DH10B cells purchased from Life-Technologies following the<br>
manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA was isolated from the<br>
resulting bacterial colonies using a Promega Wizard™ miniprep<br>
kit. Plasmids containing the appropriate Bam HI fragment were<br>
sequenced in a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin Elmer) with Prism™<br>
(Applied Biosysterns Inc.). cDNA clones were identified that<br>
coded for both human p38a isoforms (Lee et al. Nature <br>
739) . One of the clones that contained the cDNA for p38a-2<br>
(CSB-2) inserted in the cloning site of PGEX 2T, 3' of the GST<br>
coding region was designated pMON 35802. The sequence obtained<br>
for this clone is an exact match of the cDNA clone reported by<br>
Lee et al. This expression plasmid allows for the production<br>
of a GST-p38a fusion protein.<br>
Expression of human p38a<br>
GST/p38a fusion protein was expressed from the plasmid<br>
pMON 35802 in E. coli, stain DH10B (Life Technologies, Gibco-<br>
BRL) . Overnight cultures were  grown in Luria Broth (LB)<br>
containing 100 mg/ral ampicillin. The next day, 500 ml of<br>
fresh LB was inoculated with 10 ml of overnight culture, and<br>
grown in a 2 liter flask at 37° C. with constant shaking until<br>
the culture reached an absorbance of 0.8 at 600 nm. Expression<br>
of the fusion protein was induced by addition of isopropyl b-<br>
D-thiogalactosidase (IPTG) to a final concentration of <br>
mM. The cultures were shaken for three hours at room<br>
temperature, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation.<br>
The cell pellets were stored frozen until protein<br>
purification.<br>
Purification of P38 Kinase-alpha<br>
All chemicals were from Sigma Chemical Co. unless noted.<br>
Twenty grams of E. coli cell pellet collected from five 1 L<br>
shake flask fermentations was resuspended in a volume of <br>
(140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KC1, 10 mM Na.sub.2 HPO.sub.4, 1.8 mM<br>
KH.sub.2 PO.sub.4, pH 7.3) up to 200 ml. The cell suspension<br>
was adjusted to 5 mM DTT with 2 M DTT and then split equally<br>
into five 50 ml Falcon conical tubes. The cells were<br>
sonnicated (Ultrasonics model W375) with a 1 cm probe for<br>
3.times. 1 minutes (pulsed) on ice. Lysed cell material was<br>
removed by centrifugation (12,000 x g, 15 minutes) and the<br>
clarified supernatant applied to glutathione-sepharose resin<br>
(Pharmacia) .<br>
Glutathione-Sepharose Affinity Chromatography<br>
Twelve ml of a 50% glutathione .sepharose-PBS suspension<br>
was added to 200 ml clarified supernatant and incubated<br>
batchwise for 30 minutes at room temperature. The resin was<br>
collected by centrifugation (€00.times.g, 5 min) and washed<br>
with 2.times.150 ml PBS/1% Triton X-100, followed by<br>
4.times.40 ml PBS. To cleave the p38 kinase from the GST-p38<br>
fusion protein, the glutathione-sepharose resin was<br>
resuspended in 6 ml PBS containing 250 units thrombin protease<br>
(Pharmacia, specific activity &gt;7500 units/mg) and mixed gently<br>
for 4 hours at room temperature. The glutathione-sepharose<br>
resin was removed by centrifugation (600 .times .g, 5 min) and<br>
washed 2. times. 6 ml with PBS. The PBS wash fractions and<br>
digest supernatant containing p38 kinase protein were pooled<br>
and adjusted to 0.3 mM PMSF.<br>
Mono Q Anion Exchange Chromatography<br>
The thrombin-cleaved p38 kinase was further purified by<br>
FPLC-anion exchange chromatography. Thrombin-cleaved sample<br>
was diluted 2-fold with Buffer A (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 25 mM<br>
beta-glycerophosphate, 2 mM DTT, 5% glycerol) and injected<br>
onto a Mono Q HR 10/10 (Pharmacia) anion exchange column<br>
equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was eluted with a 160<br>
ml 0.1 M-0.6 M NaCl/Buffer A gradient (2 ml/minute flowrate) .<br>
The p38 kinase peak eluting at 200 mM NaCl was collected and<br>
concentrated to 3-4 ml with a Filtron 10 concentrator (Filtron<br>
Corp.).<br>
Sephacryl S100 Gel Filtration Chromatography<br>
The concentrated Mono Q- p38 kinase purified sample was<br>
purified by gel filtration chromatography (Pharmacia HiPrep<br>
26/60 Sephacryl S100 column equilibrated with Buffer B (50 mM<br>
HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 5% glycerol)). Protein<br>
was eluted from the column with Buffer B at a 0.5 ml/minute<br>
flowrate and protein was detected by absorbance at 280 nm.<br>
Fractions containing p38 kinase (detected by SDSpolyacrylamide<br>
gel electrophoresis) were pooled and frozen at<br>
-80° C. Typical purified protein yields from 5 L E. coli shake<br>
flasks fermentations were 35 mg p38 kinase.<br>
In Vitro Assay<br>
The ability of compounds to inhibit human p38 kinase<br>
alpha was evaluated using two in vitro assay methods. In the<br>
first method, activated human p38 kinase alpha phosphorylates<br>
a biotinylated substrate, PHAS-I (phosphorylated heat and acid<br>
stable protein-insulin inducible), in the presence of gamma<br>
32P-ATP (32P-ATP) . PHAS-I was biotinylated prior to the assay<br>
and provides a means of capturing the substrate, which is<br>
phosphorylated during the assay. p38 Kinase was activated by<br>
MKK6. Compounds were tested in 10 fold serial dilutions over<br>
the range of 100 /xM to 0.001 jxM using 1% DMSO. Each<br>
concentration of inhibitor was tested in triplicate.<br>
All reactions were carried out in 96 well polypropylene<br>
plates. Each reaction well contained 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM<br>
magnesium acetate and 50 /zM unlabeled ATP. Activation of <br>
was required to achieve sufficient signal in the assay.<br>
Biotinylated PHAS-I was used at 1-2 jig per 50 pi reaction<br>
volume, with a final concentration of 1.5 ptM. Activated human<br>
p38 kinase alpha was used at 1 /zg per 50 /zl reaction volume<br>
representing a final concentration of 0.3 /zM. Gamma 32P-ATP was<br>
used to follow the phosphorylation of PHAS-I. 32P-ATP has a<br>
specific activity of 3000 Ci/mmol and was used at 1.2 /zCi per<br>
50 /il reaction volume. The reaction proceeded either for one<br>
hour or overnight at 30° C.<br>
Following incubation, 20 ^1 of reaction mixture was<br>
transferred to a high capacity streptavidin coated filter<br>
plate (SAM-streptavidin-matrix, Promega) prewetted with<br>
phosphate buffered saline. The transferred reaction mix was<br>
allowed to contact the streptavidin membrane of the Promega<br>
plate for 1-2 minutes. Following capture of biotinylated PHASI<br>
with 32P incorporated, each well was washed to remove<br>
unincorporated 32P-ATP three times with 2M NaCl, three washes<br>
of 2M NaCl with 1% phosphoric, three washes of distilled water<br>
and finally a single wash of 95% ethanol. Filter plates were<br>
air-dried and 20 /zl of scintillant was added. The plates were<br>
sealed and counted.<br>
A second assay format was also employed that is based on<br>
p38 kinase alpha induced phosphorylation of EGFRP (epidermal<br>
growth factor receptor peptide, a 21 mer) in the presence 33PATP.<br>
Compounds were tested in 10 fold serial dilutions over<br>
the range of 100 tiM to 0.001 /zM in 1% DMSO. Each concentration<br>
of inhibitor was tested in triplicate. Compounds were<br>
evaluated in 50 iil reaction volumes in the presence of 25 mM<br>
Hepes pH 7.5, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 4% glycerol, 0.4%<br>
bovine serum albumin, 0.4mM DTT, 50 /zM unlabeled ATP, 25 /zg<br>
EGFRP (200 iM) , and 0.05 tiCi 33P-ATP. Reactions were initiated<br>
by addition of 0.09 izg of activated, purified human GST-p38<br>
kinase alpha. Activation was carried out using GST-MKK6<br>
(5:l,p38:MKK6) for one hour at 30° C. in the presence of 50 /zM<br>
ATP. Following incubation for 60 minutes at room temperature,<br>
the reaction was stopped by addition of 150 /zl of AG 1.times.8<br>
resin in 900 mM sodium formate buffer, pH 3.0 (1 volume resin<br>
to 2 volumes buffer) . The mixture was mixed three times with<br>
pipetting and the resin was allowed to settle. A total of 50<br>
/zl of clarified solution head volume was transferred from the<br>
reaction wells to Microlite-2 plates. 150 ill of Microscint 40<br>
was then added to each well of the Microlite plate, and the<br>
plate was sealed, mixed, and counted.<br>

TNF Cell Assays<br>
Method of Isolation of Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear<br>
Cells:<br>
Human whole blood was collected in Vacutainer tubes<br>
containing EDTA as an anticoagulant. A blood sample (7 ml) was<br>
carefully layered over 5 ml PMN Cell Isolation Medium (Robbins<br>
Scientific) in a 15 ml round bottom centrituge<br>
sample was centrifuged at 450-500.times.g for 30-35 minutes in<br>
a swing out rotor at room temperature. After centrifugation,<br>
the top band of cells were removed and washed 3 times with PBS<br>
w/o calcium or magnesium. The cells were centrifuged at 400<br>
times for 10 minutes at room temperature. The cells were<br>
resuspended in Macrophage Serum Free Medium (Gibco BRL) at a<br>
concentration of 2 million cells/mi.<br>
LPS Stimulation of Human PBMs<br>
PBM cells (0.1 ml, 2 million/ ml) were co-incubated with<br>
0.1 ml compound (10-0.41 /iM, final concentration) for 1 hour<br>
in flat bottom 96 well microtiter plates. Compounds were<br>
dissolved in DMSO initially and diluted in TCM for a final<br>
concentration of 0.1% DMSO. LPS (Calbiochem, 20 ng/ml, final<br>
concentration) was then added at a volume of 0.010 ml.<br>
Cultures were incubated overnight at 37° C. Supernatants were<br>
then removed and tested by ELISA for TNF-a and ILl-b.<br>
Viability was analyzed using MTS. After 0.1 ml supernatant was<br>
collected, 0.020 ml MTS was added to remaining 0.1 ml cells.<br>
The cells were incubated at 37° C. for 2-4 hours, then the O.D.<br>
was measured at 490-650 nM.<br>
Maintenance and Differentiation of the U937 Human<br>
Histiocytic Lymphoma Cell Line<br>
U937 cells (ATCC) were propagated in RPMI 1640 containing<br>
10% fetal bovine serum, 100 lU/ml penicillin, 100 /xg/ml<br>
streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine (Gibco). Fifty million cells<br>
in 100 ml media were induced to terminal monocytic<br>
differentiation by 24 hour incubation with 20 ng/ml phorbol<br>
12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma). The cells were washed by<br>
centrifugation (200.times.g for 5 min) and resuspended in 100<br>
ml fresh medium. After 24-48 hours, the cells were harvested,<br>
centrifuged, and resuspended in culture medium at 2 million<br>
cells/ml.<br>
LPS Stimulation of TNF production by U937 Cells<br>
U937 cells (0.1 ml, 2 million/ml) were incubated with 0.1<br>
ml compound (0.004-50 /iM, final concentration) for 1 hour in<br>
96 well microtiter plates. Compounds were prepared as 10 mM<br>
stock solutions in DMSO and diluted in culture medium to yield<br>
a final DMSO concentration of 0.1% in the cell assay. LPS (E<br>
coli, 100 ng/ml final concentration) was then added at a<br>
volume of 0.02 ml. After 4 hour incubation at 37° C., the<br>
amount of TNF-.alpha, released in the culture medium was<br>
guantitated by ELISA. Inhibitory potency is expressed as IC50<br>
(MM) .<br>
Rat Assay<br>
The efficacy of the novel compounds in blocking the<br>
production of TNF also was evaluated using a model based on<br>
rats challenged with LPS. Male Harlen Lewis rats [Sprague<br>
Dawley Co.] were used in this model. Each rat weighed<br>
approximately 300 g and was fasted overnight prior to testing.<br>
Compound administration was typically by oral gavage (although<br>
intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and intravenous administration<br>
were also used in a few instances) 1 to 24 hours prior to the<br>
LPS challenge. Rats were administered 30 ^tg/kg LPS [salmonella<br>
typhosa, Sigma Co.] intravenously via the tail vein. Blood<br>
was collected via heart puncture 1 hour after the LPS<br>
challenge. Serum samples were stored at -20° C. until<br>
quantitative analysis of TNF-.alpha, by Enzyme Linked-Immuno-<br>
Sorbent Assay ("ELISA") [Biosource]. Additional details of the<br>
assay are set forth in Perretti, M., et al., Br. J. Pharmacol.<br>
 (1993), 110, 868-874, which is incorporated by reference in<br>
this application.<br>
Mouse Assay<br>
Mouse Model of LPS-Induced TNF Alpha Production<br>
TNF alpha was induced in 10-12 week old BALB/c female<br>
mice by tail vein injection with 100 ng lipopolysaccharide<br>
(from S. Typhosa) in 0.2 ml saline. One hour later mice were<br>
bled from the retroorbital sinus and TNF concentrations in<br>
serum from clotted blood were quantified by ELISA. Typically,<br>
peak levels of serum TNF ranged from 2-6 ng/ml one hour after<br>
LPS injection.<br>
The compounds tested were administered to fasted mice by<br>
oral gavage as a suspension in 0.2 ml of 0.5% methylcellulose<br>
and 0.025% Tween 20 in water at 1 hour or 6 hours prior to LPS<br>
injection. The 1 hour protocol allowed evaluation of compound<br>
potency at Cmax plasma levels whereas the 6 hour protocol<br>
allowed estimation of compound duration of action. Efficacy<br>
was determined at each time point as percent inhibition of<br>
serum TNF levels relative to LPS injected mice that received<br>
vehicle only.<br>
Induction and Assessment of Collagen-Induced Arthritis in<br>
Mice<br>
Arthritis was induced in mice according to the procedure<br>
set forth in J. M. Stuart, Collagen Autoimmune Arthritis,<br>
Annual Rev. Immunol. 2:199 (1984), which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference. Specifically, arthritis was induced in 8-<br>
12 week old DBA/1 male mice by injection of 50 fj.g of chick<br>
type II collagen (CII) (provided by Dr. Marie Griffiths, Univ.<br>
of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah) in complete Freund's adjuvant<br>
(Sigma) on day 0 at the base of the tail. Injection volume was<br>
100 /il. Animals were boosted on day 21 with 50 /ig of CII in<br>
incomplete Freund's adjuvant (100 /xl volume). Animals were<br>
evaluated several times each week for signs of arthritis. Any<br>
animal with paw redness or swelling was counted as arthritic.<br>
Scoring of arthritic paws was conducted in accordance with the<br>
procedure set forth in Wooley et al., Genetic Control of Type<br>
II Collagen Induced Arthritis in Mice: Factors Influencing<br>
Disease Suspectibility and Evidence for Multiple MHC<br>
Associated Gene Control., Trans. Proc., 15:180 (1983). Scoring<br>
of severity was carried out using a score of 1-3 for each paw<br>
(maximal score of 12/mouse) . Animals displaying any redness<br>
or swelling of digits or the paw were scored as 1. Gross<br>
swelling of the whole paw or deformity was scored as 2.<br>
Ankylosis of joints was scored as 3. Animals were evaluated<br>
for 8 weeks. 8-10 animals per group were used.<br>
