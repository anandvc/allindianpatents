THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
TITLE<br>
Synergistic formulation of an antispasmodic and an analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory agent in tablet form.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a synergistic combination of an antispasmodic and an analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory formulation in a tablet dosage form and to a method of making the same. The synergistic tablet dosage form comprising Camylofin (antispasmodic) and aspirin (analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory) in their pharmaceutically acceptable form<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
CAMYLOFIN<br>
Camylofin dihydrochloride chemically it is isopentyl 2-[2-diethylaminoethylamino]-2-phenyl acetate dihydrochloride of molecular weight 393.4, Molecular Formula C19H32N202 2HCI. Camylofin is a pale yellow oil. Camylofin Dihydrochloride is a white crystalline powder melting point 170 °C and 180 °C, soluble in water.<br>
Brock et al studied the chemical structure and pharmacological properties of camylofin dihydrochloride in detail. Camylofin has a direct papaverine like spasmolytic action on the smooth muscle and a mild atropine like anticholinergic action, making it one of the most potent antispasmodics. It inhibits the enzyme phosphodiesterase, which in turn causes increase in concentration of cyclic AMP and smooth muscle relaxation. Due to its phosphodiesterase enzyme-IV isoenzyme selectivity, this drug does not interfere with uterine contractility. LD 50 in mice 760 mg/kg orally; 1.35 gm/ kg s.c; 49.2 mg/kg i.v.<br>
Camylofin dihydrochloride primarily acts on smooth muscles (intestine, ureter, cervix) whereas its influence on glands, eyes, heart and circulation is slight and of no clinical significance. It has very mild anticholinergic side effects like dryness of mouth, dilatation of pupils, paralysis of accommodation and palpitations. It has a wide margin of safety. The ratio of<br>

the effective therapeutic dose to the toxicity dose in animal studies varies from 1:40 to 1:150.5.<br>

Aspirin or acetylsalicylic acid is a drug in the family of salicylates, often used as an analgesic (against minor pains and aches), antipyretic (against fever), and anti-inflammatory. It has also an anticoagulant (blood thinning) effect and is used in long-term low-doses to prevent heart attacks.<br>
Low-dose long-term aspirin irreversibly blocks formation of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation, and this blood thinning property makes it useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks. Aspirin produced for this purpose often comes in 75 or 81 mg dispersible tablets and is sometimes called "baby aspirin." High doses of aspirin are also given immediately after an acute heart attack. These doses may also inhibit the synthesis of prothrombin and may therefore produce a second and different anticoagulant effect.<br>
Several hundred fatal overdoses of aspirin occur annually, but the vast majority of its uses are beneficial. Its primary undesirable side effects, especially in stronger doses, are gastrointestinal distress (including ulcers and stomach bleeding) and tinnitus. Another side effect, due to its anticoagulant properties, is increased bleeding in menstruating women.<br>
3 <br>
Because there appears to be a connection between aspirin and Reye's syndrome, aspirin is no longer used to control flu-like symptoms in minors.<br>
Aspirin was the first discovered member of the class of drugs known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), not all of which are salicylates, though they all have similar effects and a similar action mechanism.<br>
More recent work has shown that there are at least two different types of cyclooxygenase: COX-1 and COX-2. Aspirin inhibits both of them. Newer NSAID drugs called COX-2 selective inhibitors have been developed that only inhibit COX-2, with the hope that this would reduce the gastrointestinal side effects.<br>
However, several of the new COX-2 selective inhibitors have been recently withdrawn, after evidence emerged that COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack. It is proposed that endothelial cells lining the arteries in the body express COX-2, and by selectively inhibiting COX-2, prostaglandins (specifically PGF2) are downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as COX-1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anti-coagulative effect of PGF2 is decreased, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new COX once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, rendering them "useless": an important difference with reversible inhibitors.<br>
Additionally, aspirin has 2 additional modes of actions, contributing to its strong analgesic, antipyretic and antiinflammitive properties :<br>
•	It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria.<br>
•	It induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body that enable the white bloodcells (leucocyts) to fight infections more effectively. This has been found recently by Dr. Derek W. Gilroy, winning Bayer's International Aspirin Award 2005.<br>
4<br><br>
Also recently aspirin has been proven to prevent carcinoma of the colon, if given in low doses over years.<br>
Aspirin has analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory actions.<br>
Aspirin is indicated for short-term use in the relief of mild to moderate pain (headache, toothache, menstrual cramps, neuralgia, muscular pain, pain associated with colds) and fever.<br>
Aspirin, as with many older drugs, has proven to be useful in many conditions, and despite its well-known toxicity, it is widely used, since physicians are familiar with its properties. Indications for its use include:<br>
•	Fever<br>
•	Pain (especially useful for conditions involving osteoid osteoma,<br>
arthritis and chronic pain)<br>
•	Migraine<br>
•	Myocardial infarction prophylaxis (low dose)<br>
•	Rheumatic fever (drug of choice)<br>
Aspirin is a moisture sensitive drug and can hydrolyze into acetic and salicylic acids. Hydrophilic excipients can have adverse effects on aspirin under accelerated stability conditions.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>

EXAMPLE -1<br>
Each tablet contains:<br>
Camylofin Dihydrochloride	50 mg<br>
Aspirin	325 mg<br>
MANUFACTURING PROCESS (Batch Size: 1 lakh tablets)<br>
Step - 1:      Making the camylofin granules<br>
5.0 Kg of Camylofin dihydrochloride, 8.0 kg of microcrystalline cellulose, 5.0 kg of dibasic calcium phosphate anhydrous and 0.1 kg of colloidal silicon dioxide were passed through a 40-mesh sieve and placed in' a planetary mixer. The ambient temperature was maintained below 25 degrees Celsius and the relative humidity below 60%. The mixer was run for 25 minutes at 30<br>
10<br><br>
r.p.m. so that a homogenous mixture of the particles of Camylofin and the<br>
above said inert excipients resulted.<br>
300 gms of ethyl cellulose was mixed with 5 Kg of isopropyl alcohol in a<br>
stainless steel [s.s.] tank under continuous stirring until the binder was<br>
completely dissolved in the solvent.   The solution was then added to the<br>
planetary mixer containing the homogenous mixture of the particles of<br>
Camylofin with the excipients.<br>
Wet mixing was then commenced for 20 minutes at 15 r.p.m. to obtain a wet<br>
homogenous mixture mass.<br>
The wet homogenous mixture mass was milled, in a multimill fitted with 12<br>
mm perforated sieve to obtain camylofin granules of mesh size 8 to 12 mm.<br>
The wet granules were subjected to drying:<br>
The granules were subjected to heated drying at a temperature of 50 to 60<br>
degrees Celsius in a tray drier for 6 hrs. The drying mass was raked during<br>
the process. The Loss on drying was 1.2%.<br>
The dry granules were sifted in an 18-mesh vibrosifter to obtain uniform<br>
sized camylofin granules.<br>
Step 2: making the aspirin granules<br>
32.5 kg of aspirin, 8.0 kg of microcrystalline cellulose, 3.0 kg of mannitol and<br>
0.2 kg of colloidal silicon dioxide were passed through a 40-mesh sieve and<br>
placed in a planetary mixer. The ambient temperature was maintained below<br>
25 degrees Celsius and the relative humidity below 60%. The mixer was run<br>
for 25 minutes at 30 r.p.m. so that a homogenous mixture of the particles of<br>
actives and the diluents resulted.<br>
300 gms of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose was mixed with 2 Kg of isopropyl<br>
alcohol and 3.0 kg of methylene chloride in a stainless steel [s.s.] tank under<br>
continuous stirring until a clear solution is formed and the binder was<br>
completely dissolved in the solvent.   The solution was then added to the<br>
planetary mixer containing the homogenous mass.<br>
Wet mixing was then commenced for 20 minutes at 15 r.p.m. to obtain a wet<br>
homogenous mixture mass.<br>
The   wet homogenous mixture mass was milled, in a multimill fitted with 12<br>
mm perforated sieve to obtain granules of mesh size 8 to 12 mm.<br>
11<br><br>
The wet granules were subjected to drying:<br>
The granules were subjected to drying at room temperature without heating<br>
in a fluidized bed dryer for 1.5 hrs. The drying mass was raked during the<br>
process. The Loss on drying was 2%.<br>
The dry granules were sifted in an 18-mesh vibrosifter to obtain uniform size.<br>
Step - 3: Lubrication<br>
Through a vibro sifter of mesh size 40 meshes the following materials were passed:<br>
2.0 kg sodium starch glycolate, , 0.8 kg of talcum, and 0.6 kg of magnesium stearate. This sifted mass (except magnesium stearate) along with the dried granules of Camylofin and other actives were transferred to a double cone blender at temperature of 22 degrees Celsius and the mass was blended at speed of 30 r.p.m. for 25 minutes. 0.6 kg of magnesium stearate; was then added to the blender and further blending was done for 5 minutes resulting in the lubricated core mass.<br>
Step - 4: Compression<br>
This core mass was fed to hopper of a single rotary compression machine<br>
and the compression pressure was set at 3 kg/sq cm.<br>
Dimension: capsule shaped, Standard curvature, with following dimension<br>
Length: 19.0 ±0.1 mm<br>
Width: 8.0 ±0.1 mm<br>
Average weight of core 658 mg ± 3 %.<br>
Step - 5: film - coating<br>
The cores were coated with a film coating.<br>
Pre-coating solution:<br>
A pre-coating solution is prepared by dispersing 0.400 kg of ethyl cellulose<br>
and 0.200 kg of hydroxymethyl cellulose in 4.00 kg of isopropyl alcohol<br>
followed by addition of 6.0 kg methylene chloride and 100 ml of propylene<br>
glycol with constant stirring till to obtain a uniform slurry.<br>
Seal-coating solution:<br>
12<br><br>
A seal-coating suspension was prepared by mixing 0.6 kg of ethyl cellulose<br>
and 0.10 kg of hydroxypropyl cellulose and mixed together with 9 kg of<br>
isopropyl alcohol and  15 kg of Methylene chloride; 0.01  kg of diethyl<br>
phthalate, 0.05 kg of titanium dioxide in a s.s. Container, 0.02 kg of iron<br>
oxide yellow, and stirred for five minutes using overhead stirrer until smooth<br>
slurry was obtained.<br>
The freshly prepared coating solution was sieved through 80-mesh sieve<br>
and sprayed one after another by following the usual method.<br>
The de-dusted cores were transferred into a coating pan and the tablet bed<br>
was heated by inching process using hot air blower. The initial temperature<br>
was set at 40°C.   Once the tablet bed attains 45°C it was ready for spray<br>
coating with the coating suspension.    The cores were coated with the<br>
coating suspension. The relative humidity was maintained below 60 %<br>
throughout. The coated tablets were polished with talc.<br>
Final dimensions of the tablets were as follows:<br>
Dimension: capsule shaped, Standard curvature, with following dimension<br>
Length: 19.2 ±0.1 mm<br>
Width: 8.2 ±0.1 mm<br>
Average weight of film coated tablet 574 mg ± 3 %.<br>

RATIONALE / SYNERGY OF THE FORMULATION<br>
Camylofin is a synthetic fast acting anti-spasmodic indicated for the spasmodic conditions of the abdominal hollow organs. Additionally, aspirin has 2 additional modes of actions, contributing to its strong analgesic, antipyretic and antiinflammitive properties. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria. It induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body that enable the white bloodcells (leucocyts) to fight infections more effectively. The combination of aspirin and Camylofin has a classic with dual mechanism of action (viz. myotropic and neurotropic) ensuring fast relief from smooth muscle spasm and pain. The said formulation combination is indicated for intestinal colic, renal colic, biliary colic, spasmodic dysmenorrhoea.<br>
Trials were conducted by administering the tablets of the above examples to patients suffering from spasmodic pain v/ith slight fever and headache. The abstract of the trials is reported below in the section medical trials. Some patients were administered aspirin and camylofin separately and tablets of the above said formulation were given to some patients having the above indications. Significant results were obtained for the formulation of this invention over separate dose of camylofin or aspirin in different patients. Unexpectedly, the relief was obtained significantly earlier [perceived to be at least 10 to 15 minutes earlier] but was more satisfactory [perceived to be at least 16 % better]. In addition the single dosage form of the two active ingredients improved patient compliance as well as the cost of manufacture.<br>
