				<td>A. -CENTRIC  PROVIDING DEVICE AND SERVICE PROVIDING METHOD<br>
The present invention relates to a user-oriented service providing<br>
device and a. service providing method, particularly relates to a service<br>
providing device and a service providing method enabling a user to accept<br>
the services by utilizing the capabilities of a plurality of devices.<br>
Recently, in addition to the conventional computers, there are many<br>
terminals providing capabilities of processing and communications, such as<br>
personal digital assistants (PDA), mobile phones, vehicles equipments,<br>
computer peripheral equipments (e. g. printers, facsimiles, etc.) and so<br>
forth.<br>
The current situation is that all the present service providers<br>
provide services to the users based on the so-called "device-oriented"<br>
service providing form. That, is, the users usually accept certain<br>
services specified for the device by means of the functionalities of some<br>
individual terminals. For example, the users listen to the phone calls by<br>
means of the mobile phones; do text editing by means of PDA and so on.<br>
It can be anticipated that in near future there will be more<br>
terminals having various kinds of functionalities to be selected and used<br>
by the users. Thus the users have much more choices.<br>
But the above-mentioned "device-oriented" service providing form may<br>
have a big problem: on one hand, it is necessary to provide the inter-ware<br>
used to realize the corresponding service functionalities for various<br>
kinds of terminals; on the other hand, the service provider must spend<br>
much effort and cost in providing supporting functionalities for more new<br>
terminals.<br>
In addition, although the users can possess a plurality of terminals,<br>
but due to the limitation of various terminals, the users have to endure<br>
the services of low quality such as small screen size, low speed linking<br>
and bad sound and image quality.<br>
Moreover, even though a user may have a lot of terminals, when a<br>
terminal is being used, the user is prevented from performing more<br>
sophisticated tasks due to the limited capabilities of his terminals, even<br>
at that time the user still has other devices having the capabilities of<br>
performing the functionalities.<br>
Thus, the above problem can be solved if it is possible to combine<br>
the available capabilities of various kinds of devices to build a<br>
"virtual" device for providing the services comprehensively for a user.<br>

Fig. 1 shows a conceptual graph of the service providing system of<br>
the present invention. The service providing system of the present<br>
invention constructs a virtual device for each user based on the physical<br>
object of the real world such as the user and the physical devices; and<br>
the service providing system of the present invention can further collect<br>
the information of the surrounding environment of each user, mainly the<br>
user-related environment information in space. The user accepts the<br>
services of the service providers via the constructed virtual device. The<br>
term *user(s)" used in the present invention includes not only the people<br>
in the real world, but also the entities including the animals. The term<br>
"device(s)" used in the present invention includes all the physical<br>
devices capable of providing communication services for the users.<br>
Below the process in fig. 1 will be explained briefly.<br>
Firstly, the physical objects in the real world 100 such as the users<br>
122,..., 122 and the physical devices 120,...,120 are preliminarily logged<br>
on to the system. Besides, preferably, the information of the environment<br>
124 related to each user is collected too (102).<br>
Thereafter, the system extracts the useful information from the<br>
logged~on information, generates a device object 126 and a user object 128<br>
for each logged-on device and user, and stores the collected environment<br>
information into the environment information database 130. The user<br>
object, the device object and/or the environment information database<br>
construct a virtual world 104.<br>
Then the system associates the user object of the user with one or<br>
more related available device object (106) so as to build a sentient<br>
network (SN) 108 for the user. If needed, the system of the present<br>
invention will build a sentient network for the user object of each<br>
logged-on user. The constructional factors of the sentient network<br>
include a user object and one or more available device objects related to<br>
the user object.<br>
When the user object accepts the services or when the service<br>
providers provide the services, the system builds a virtual device (VD)<br>
for the user, and builds a virtual device (VD) operating environment 112<br>
based on the parameter such as the service features or requirements and/or<br>
the user requirements (110). Thus the user is able to access the service<br>
providers 114, 116 or accept services from them in the virtual device (VD)<br>
operating environment 112 via the virtual device (VD).<br>
Below it will be explained in details how the information providing<br>
system of the present invention Implements the above process.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a. basic structural block diagram of the information<br>
providing system of the present invention. As shown in fig. 2, the<br>
information providing system includes a user management portion 1, a<br>
device management portion 2, a static environment information management<br>
portion 3, a dynamic environment information management portion 4, an<br>
associating portion 5 and a virtual device management portion 6; wherein<br>
the user management portion 1, the device management portion 2 and the<br>
associating portion 5 constitute a sentient network generating device.<br>
Preferably, the static environment information management portion 3 and<br>
the dynamic environment information management portion 4 may also<br>
constitute the sentient network generating device.<br>
Below there will be the descriptions of the construction of the<br>
above-mentioned portions.<br>
In the user management portion 1, a user manager 200 accepts the<br>
registering or the change of the user, builds a user object or updates the<br>
information of the user object for the user in the real world, and stores<br>
the user object in the user object storage 202 or modifies the user object<br>
information stored in the user object storage 202.<br>
In the device management, portion 2, the physical device manager 204<br>
accepts the registering or change of the devices, builds a device object<br>
or updates the information of the device object for the device in the real<br>
world, and stores the device object in the device object storage 206 or<br>
modifies the device object information stored in the device object storage<br>
206.<br>
In the information providing system according to the present<br>
invention, the physical entities in the real world are divided into the<br>
users and the devices, wherein the users are the objects to accept the<br>
services, while the devices are the medium for providing services to the<br>
users. The service providing system of the present invention builds a<br>
user object for each user and builds a device object for each physical<br>
device.<br>
A user object can be, for example, defined to have the following data<br>
items:<br>
A user object<br>
the basic information<br>
the personal device (PD)<br>
the physiological characteristics (PC)<br>
the social connections (SO<br>
the authorization information<br>
----the favorite information<br>
Each user object includes the information related to the user, such<br>
as the basic information, the authorization information and the favorite<br>
information of the user and so on.<br>
The basic information includes : the identification information of<br>
the personal devices (PD) owned by the user; the physiological<br>
characteristics (PC) information of the user; the social connections (SO<br>
information of the user and so on.<br>
The personal device is a term used to describe a certain device such<br>
as a badge, a credit card, a mobile phone, a PDA etc. owned by a user in<br>
the real world. In the personal device data items there are stored the<br>
identification information of the above devices, such as the personnel's<br>
badge number, the credit card number, the mobile phone number, the PDA<br>
net card number etc. The examples are not limited in the above-mentioned,<br>
so long as the identification information can be used to identify uniquely<br>
the personal device.<br>
The physiological characteristics of a user are, for example, the<br>
fingerprint, the sound spectrogram, the iris image, the face features and<br>
so on of the user.<br>
The social connections of a user include the information about the<br>
user himself/herself, the family members, the colleagues, the friend names<br>
of the user etc.<br>
In the authorization information there are stored the user's usage<br>
privilege and usage class of the resources of a certain environment. For<br>
example, in a company the personnel are authorized to access all the<br>
available resources owned by the company, while the visitors are refused<br>
to access the available resources of the company. In the user object, the<br>
authorization information is selectable.<br>
In the favorite information there are stored the user's requirements<br>
to accepting the services or using the device, such as preferring using<br>
what kind of physical devices to accept the audio information; refusing to<br>
use what kind of physical devices to accept the services, the requirements<br>
to a certain service and so on.<br>
In the above information, the basic information is usually static<br>
information while the authorization information and the favorite<br>
information usually are dynamic ones.<br>
A device object is defined to have, for example, the following data<br>
icems:<br>
Device object<br>
the basic configuration<br>
the statue<br>
the access interface<br>
Every device object includes the information related with the device,<br>
such as the basic configuration information, the status information, the<br>
access interface information etc. It should be emphasized that device<br>
objects are also built for those physical devices not owned by a user such<br>
as the video camera, the printer and the facsimile etc. installed in the<br>
local network of a building, because these devices can still be used by<br>
the user as a common device. The present invention will build a device<br>
object for each physical device.<br>
The basic configuration includes the information related to the basic<br>
configuration of the device, such as the identification number, the type,<br>
the model number, the display capability, the processing ability and the<br>
functionalities etc. The basic configuration information generally<br>
relates to static information, i.e., usually they will not change after<br>
being logged on into the system.<br>
The status information includes the usage status of the device, such<br>
as the information about whether the device is on-line, whether the<br>
information is available, the status information are usually dynamic<br>
information and may change with the change of the usage of the device or<br>
the movement of the device. Thus the status information of the device may<br>
be: off-line; on-line;.<br>
Access interface information includes the description about the<br>
access methods such as its communication protocols etc.<br>
Next we will describe the user information management process<br>
according to the present invention with reference to fig. 3.<br>
The users can register in many forms, for example, they may register<br>
manually or automatically or in a combined form by combining these two<br>
forms. When registering manually, the user sends his/her own information<br>
to the user manager 200 via the existing communication network. Moreover,<br>
in order to collect the user information as comprehensively as possible,<br>
the user manager 200 according to the present invention may provide a<br>
registering display to the user to prompt the user to fill in the<br>
necessary information. Of course, in the manual registering form, the<br>
system manager of the user's local network may provide the user<br>
information to the user manager 200.<br>
In the automatic registering form, the user manager 200 may download<br>
the user-related information from one or more network on which the user<br>
works. When a user enters a temporary environment, usually there will be<br>
an automatic registering, where the environment may automatically detects<br>
the existence of the user and obtains the user-related information via the<br>
user's personal device so as to register automatically for the user in<br>
such changing environment. The user-related information may be stored in<br>
user's personal device or a network link. Later an agent device used for<br>
helping the present invention to effect an automatic registering of the<br>
user information will be described.<br>
A user needs to register only once, any changed information will be<br>
again sent to the user manager 200 only when there is any change of the<br>
above-described user object information, or the user manager 200 may<br>
collect actively the new user information from one or more user's network<br>
periodically or randomly.<br>
Based on the accepted registering information of the user, the user<br>
manager 200 extracts the information needed for describing the data items<br>
of the user object and the information related to his/her personal device<br>
(PD), the information related to his/her physiological characteristics<br>
(PC); the information related to his/her social connections (SC); the<br>
authorization information and the favorite information and so on, and<br>
constructs a user object for the user based on these information.<br>
Below the operating process of the user manager 200 will be described<br>
with reference to fig. 3.<br>
In step S300 of fig. 3, the user manager 200 receives the<br>
user-related information.<br>
In step S302 it is judged whether the user sending the information is<br>
a registered user. When it is determined that the user is an unregistered<br>
user, the process proceeds to step S304.<br>
In step S304 the user manager 200 extracts the information needed for<br>
describing the user object from the accepted information.<br>
In step S306 the user manager 200 builds a user object for the user<br>
based on the extracted information.<br>
In step 3308 the user manager 200 stores the built user object in the<br>
user object storage 202.<br>
In step S310 the user manager 200 notifies the associating device 208<br>
of the message that a new user has registered and lets the latter to do<br>
the further processing. The operation of the associating device 208 will<br>
be described later.<br>
When in step S302, it is determined that the user is a registered<br>
user, the process proceeds to step S312, where the user manager 200<br>
updates the corresponding user object data item information stored in the<br>
user object storage 202 based on the accepted information.<br>
In step S314 the user manager 200 notifies the associating device 208<br>
of the message that the user information has been updated and lets the<br>
latter to do the further processing. The operation of the associating<br>
device 208 will be described later.<br>
There may be two situations when the device is registered. For the<br>
static devices such as printers and home telephones whose positions are<br>
rather fixed, when the devices are newly put into use, i.e. when they are<br>
connected to the network, the system manager of the network where the<br>
device is located registers the device information to the physical device<br>
manager 204, or the physical device manager 204 downloads the information<br>
of the device from the network where the device is located. For the<br>
dynamic devices such as the user PDA, the mobile phones, the notebook<br>
computer and so on, when the devices are put into use, e.g. when they are<br>
connected to the network, the server of the network where the device is<br>
located registers the device to the physical device manager 204. Those<br>
skilled in the art can recognize that when the dynamic devices are bought,<br>
the system manager or the server of the network where the device is<br>
located may also register the device information to the physical device<br>
manager 204. Later an agent device used to help the present invention to<br>
do the automatic registering will be described.<br>
The physical device manager 202 extracts the basic device<br>
information, the status information, the access interface information<br>
needed for describing the device object from the accepted registration<br>
information of the device, and constructs a device object for the device<br>
based on the extracted information.<br>
Next the operating process of the physical device manager 204 will be<br>
described with reference to fig. 4.<br>
In step S400 of fig. 4, the physical device manager 204 receives the<br>
device-related information.<br>
In step S402 it is judged whether the device sending the information<br>
is a registered device. When, it is determined that the device is an<br>
unregistered device, the process proceeds to step S404.<br>
In step S404 the physical device manager 204 extracts the information<br>
needed for describing the device object from the accepted information.<br>
In step S406 the physical device manager 204 builds a device object<br>
for the device based on the extracted information.<br>
In step S408 the physical device manager 204 stores the newly built<br>
device object in the device object storage 206.<br>
In step S'410 the physical device manager 204 notifies the associating<br>
device 208 of the message that a new device has been registered and lets<br>
the latter do the further processing. The operation of the associating<br>
device 208 will be described later.<br>
In step S402, when it is determined that the device is a registered<br>
device, the process proceeds to step S412, where the physical device<br>
manager 204 updates the corresponding device object information stored in<br>
the device object storage 206 based on the accepted information.<br>
In step S414 the physical device manager 204 notifies the associating<br>
device 208 of the message that the device information has been updated and<br>
lets the latter do the further processing. The operation of the<br>
associating device 208 will be described later.<br>
As the information used to describe the device object includes the<br>
dynamic information to be updated at any time, such as the status<br>
information, thus even if the device has been registered, once it is<br>
monitored that the above dynamic information of the device has changed,<br>
the physical device manager 204 is notified of the above-mentioned change,<br>
and the physical device manager 204 modifies the object information of the<br>
registered physical object so as to keep abreast of the newest device<br>
status.<br>
For example, a dedicated monitoring device is used to monitor the<br>
status signals of the physical device, and notifies the physical device<br>
manager 204 of the change of the status of the physical device to let it<br>
update the status information when there is a change of the status. The<br>
monitoring device may be for example a server of the network where the<br>
physical device is located.<br>
Next Ban agent device of the present invention will be described. The<br>
agent device may be detachably attached to various physical devices in the<br>
form of accessories, used to broadcast the basic information such as the<br>
functionalities, status and access methods of these physical devices or<br>
receive the information broadcast by other physical devices via the agent<br>
device.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a block diagram of the agent device.<br>
As shown in fig. 5, an agent device includes a processing unit 500,<br>
an interface 502, a transceiving unit 504 and a storage unit 506.<br>
Wherein the processing unit 500 is in charge of the overall control<br>
of the agent device, and, when needed, interacts with the main device 508<br>
via a standard interface 502, obtains the information related to the<br>
device from the main device 508, such as the basic configuration<br>
information, the status information, the access interface information and<br>
so on of the device. Preferably, when the main device 508 is a personal<br>
device of a certain user, it further obtains the information related to<br>
the user from the main device 508.<br>
The basic configuration of the device includes the information<br>
related to the basic configuration of the device, such as the<br>
identification number, the type, the model number, the display capability,<br>
the processing ability and the functionalities etc.<br>
The status information includes the usage status of the main device,<br>
such as the information about whether the device is on-line.<br>
The access interface information includes the description about the<br>
access methods such as its communication protocols etc.<br>
Therefore, the information obtained by the processing unit 500<br>
includes both the static information such as the basic configuration<br>
information and the access interface information of the main device, and<br>
the dynamic information such as the status information of the main device.<br>
The standard interface 502 may adopt any known hardware and/or<br>
software or their combination, which can be used to exchange information<br>
and communicate with the main device. For example, the standard interface<br>
502 may be a RS-232 interface, a parallel interface or a radio interface<br>
such as a radio interface using the bluetooth or infrared technology. But<br>
the standard interface 502 is not compulsory. It is also possible to<br>
input preliminarily the information related to the main device 508 to the<br>
agent device to store it via an input device not shown in the figures.<br>
The processing unit 500 may be a processor having the ability of<br>
arithmetic and logical operations of any known type. The CPUs with low<br>
processing capabilities can be used to decrease the cost.<br>
The storage unit 506 stores either temporarily or permanently the<br>
information of the main device 508 obtained by the processing unit 500.<br>
For example, the storage unit 506 may store permanently the obtained<br>
static information while store temporarily the obtained dynamic<br>
information.<br>
The transceiving unit 504 broadcasts the information of the main<br>
device 508 obtained by the processing unit 500. The transceiving unit may<br>
broadcast the static information only once depending on whether the main<br>
device has registered to the system, while broadcasts the changed dynamic<br>
information any time it is changed. But it should be noted that the<br>
parameters used to identify the main device such as the type and<br>
identification number are the information needed to be broadcast so as to<br>
identify the devices. Of course, the parameters used to identify the main<br>
device are not limited to the above-mentioned, there are also other<br>
parameters used to identify the main device.<br>
Moreover, the transceiving unit 504 further has the receiving<br>
capability used to receive the information of other main devices broadcast<br>
by the other agent devices and to further process the received<br>
information. The processing operation will be described later.<br>
The information broadcast by the transceiving unit 504 is received by<br>
the device information collecting device 510 or other agent device 512<br>
having the same broadcasting functionality. Later these two forms of<br>
device information collecting processes will be described in details.<br>
Preferably, the transceiving unit 504 may be any known radio sensor,<br>
such as the radio sensors using the bluetooth or infrared technology. The<br>
sensors using the same technology can be sentient of one another. For<br>
example, the radio sensors using bluetooth technology can be sentient of<br>
the information broadcast by other radio sensors using bluetooth<br>
technology in a certain distance, and vice versa. The agent devices<br>
having such radio sensor structure are especially useful for broadcasting<br>
the information of the main device or the user in the mobile environment<br>
so as to be captured by the system. In addition, an agent device can be<br>
added to a device with a fixed position to broadcast the information of<br>
the fixed device.<br>
Preferably, the transceiving unit 504 may be a combination of any<br>
known radio sensors, such as a combination of the radio sensors using the<br>
bluetooth and the radio sensors using infrared technology. Thus an agent<br>
device can be used to compatibly collect or broadcast the information<br>
using different technology so as to widen the functionality of an agent<br>
device.<br>
Preferably, the agent device according to the present invention may<br>
also have a power supply system so that when the main device is shut down,<br>
the agent device still can work so as to broadcast the information of the<br>
main device to outside or to be sentient of the other devices on behalf of<br>
the main device connected thereto.<br>
Besides, the agent device of the present invention may exist in the<br>
form of a recording label being sentient of by the other devices, the<br>
agent device may be for example a bar code label that records the<br>
information of a device or a user to which the agent device ie attached.<br>
The information will be collected by other collecting devices.<br>
In the present invention, the agent devices may be attached to any<br>
main device to help the system in collecting the main device information.<br>
The present invention provides the following forms to collect the device<br>
information via the agent devices.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a schematic diagram of how the agent device collects the<br>
device information in the centralized collecting form.<br>
In this form, each of the device 1 to the device N has one agent<br>
device as shown in fig. 5 attached thereto. The device information<br>
collecting device 510 collects the broadcast information broadcast by the<br>
agent devices located in its radio sensing scope. In such a way, the<br>
device information collecting device 510 and device 1 through device N<br>
constitute a sensor network to collect the device information.<br>
Moreover, in the centralized collecting form, the functionality of<br>
the device information collecting device 510 may be included in the<br>
physical device manager 204.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a flow diagram of collecting the device information in<br>
the centralized collecting form.<br>
Below take device 1 as an example for describing the process of<br>
collection of device information.<br>
Firstly, in step S700, when device 1 enters the information<br>
collection scope of the device information collecting device 510, the<br>
device information collecting device 510 collects the information of<br>
device 1 broadcast by device 1 itself through its own agent device 100.<br>
In step S702, the device information collecting device 510 sends the<br>
collected information of the device to the physical device manager 204.<br>
In step S704, the physical device manager 204 builds or modifies the<br>
device object according to the process shown in fig. 4.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a schematic diagram of collecting the device information<br>
by using the agent device in the ad hoc collecting form.<br>
In this form, an agent device of a concrete physical device collects<br>
the information of other physical devices located in its sentient scope<br>
instead of the device information collecting device 510 used to collect<br>
the information of the physical devices. The collection of the device<br>
information is performed by transferring the device information between<br>
the agent devices. This form is especially suitable for information<br>
collection and processing in a relatively enclosed mobile environment,<br>
which is constituted by, for example, the mobile devices carried by the<br>
personnel of a company.<br>
There are one or more agent devices capable of notifying the physical<br>
device manager 204 of its collection of the information in this form. In<br>
the example shown in fig. 8, it is assumed that the agent device of device<br>
1 has the above-mentioned functionality of notification.<br>
Pig. 9 shows a flow diagram of collecting the device information in<br>
the ad hoc collecting form.<br>
Firstly, in step S900, an agent device of a device receives the<br>
information broadcast by other agent devices.<br>
Then in step S902 the agent device judges whether it itself can<br>
communicate with the physical device manager 204. This judgment is done<br>
by sanding a query to the physical device manager 204 and receiving the<br>
response therefrom, or by pre-storing the corresponding related access<br>
parameters of the physical device manager 204 in the storage unit of the<br>
agent device and querying the access parameters.<br>
When it is judged that it is impossible to communicate with the<br>
physical device manager 204, in step S904 the agent device broadcasts the<br>
received broadcast information and/or its own identification information<br>
via the transceiving device so that the neighboring agent devices can<br>
receive the information.<br>
When it is judged that it is possible to communicate with the<br>
physical device manager 204, in step S906 the agent device sends the<br>
received broadcast information and/or its own identification information<br>
to the physical device manager 204 via the transceiving device.<br>
All the other agent devices perform the same operation.<br>
In such a way, the device information of all the devices 1 through N<br>
are sent to the physical device manager 204 via the agent device of device<br>
1. Then the physical device manager 204 performs the processing shown in<br><c></c>
fig. 4. Thus devices 1 through N of fig. 8 constitute a sensor network to<br>
collect the device information.<br>
Those skilled in the art can recognize that the above two forms can<br>
be used separately or cooperatively to send the device information to the<br>
physical device manager 204 of the system. For example, in the<br>
cooperative operation, device 1 sends the device information of all the<br>
devices 1 through N to the device information collecting device 510 that<br>
can cover device 1, and then the device information collecting device 510<br>
sends the device information of devices 1 through N and the received<br>
device information of other devices to the physical device manager 204.<br>
The above-mentioned two forms used by the agent devices of the<br>
physical devices to collect the device information can also be used in<br>
user information collection. When they are used for collecting the user<br>
information, the users may carry the agent device with himself/herself.<br>
In such cases, the basic user information or the changed user information<br>
are pre-stored in the agent device for later use in registering or<br>
modification operation.<br>
Those skilled in the art can recognize that the user information can<br>
be stored in the agent device used as an accessory of the user's personal<br>
device so that the agent device can further broadcast the user information<br>
at the same time when it broadcasts the information of the personal device<br>
of the user. In addition, the user information can also be broadcast by<br>
the agent device attached to the personal device carried by"the user via<br>
the personal device. Any form of using the agent devices of the present<br>
invention to broadcast or collect the user information or the device<br>
information is within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Those skilled in the art can recognize that in addition to the above<br>
user information and device information collected by the user manager 200<br>
and the physical device manager 204, there may be other information, so<br>
long as these information are needed for building the later-mentioned<br>
sentient network and virtual devices.<br>
The process of collection of the user information and device<br>
information has been described in details. Sometimes the environment<br>
information is also very important for a user to search for the available<br>
and effective devices used by the user to accept the services. For<br>
example, when the user is working in a laboratory, it is realistic that<br>
the system knows various device information of the laboratory environment<br>
so as to provide the user more and better services. Another example is<br>
that when the user is in a mobile business environment, it is very useful<br>
to keep abreast of the device resources available to the user in various<br>
mobile environment, which is very helpful in providing the user the<br>
services more suiting this mobile environment.<br>
Therefore, the present invention further provides the static<br>
environment information management portion 3 and the dynamic environment<br>
information management portion 4 for collecting the environment<br>
information, so that the system may collect the available devices for user<br>
based on the environment information.<br>
As shown in fig. 2, the static environment information management<br>
portion 3 includes a static environment information manager 201 and a<br>
static environment information storage 203.<br>
The static environment information manager 201 obtains the position<br>
information and device identification information of various static<br>
devices such ae the printers, the scanners, the computers not easily<br>
movable, the fixed telephones etc. from the existing information network<br>
such as the local network of the company. And these information are<br>
stored in the static environment information storage 203. Of course, the<br>
static environment information manager 201 can also collects static<br>
information in other ways, for example, via the sensor network constituted<br>
by the agent devices attached to the static devices provided by the<br>
present invention.<br>
The structure of the static environment information data items are as<br>
follows:<br>
Space scope<br>
sub-space scope 1<br>
the device A ID; the position of device A<br>
(optional);...<br>
the device B ID; the position of device B<br>
(optional);...<br>
sub-space scope 2<br>
the device C ID; the position of device C<br>
(optional);...<br>
the device D ID; the position of device D<br>
(optional);...<br>
Wherein the space scope is for example a building where the company<br>
is situated; the sub-space is for example the rooms divided inside the<br>
company; device ID is the ID of the devices located in the sub-spaces.<br>
The system can keep abreast of the space position status of the<br>
static devices in the system via the static environment information<br>
manager 201.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a flow diagram of the process of collecting the static<br>
environment information.<br>
Firstly, in step S1000 the static environment information manager 201<br>
receives the environment information related to the static devices from an<br>
external network such as the local network of the company, the telephone<br>
network and so on. Optionally, the agent devices of the present invention<br>
can be attached to these static devices so that the environment<br>
information related to the static devices can be sent to the static<br>
environment information manager 201 via the sensor network constituted by<br>
the agent devices.<br>
In step S1002 it is judged whether the received environment<br>
information related to the static devices have been collected.<br>
When it is determined that the received environment information<br>
related to the static devices have not been collected, in step S1004 some<br>
information are extracted from the received environment information<br>
related to the static devices so as to form the information needed for<br>
forming the static environment information.<br>
In step S1006 the extracted static environment information are<br>
stored.<br>
In step S1008 the message that new static environment information<br>
have been collected is sent to the associating device 208. The<br>
associating device 208 will do further processing.<br>
When in step S1002 it is determined that the static device<br>
information have been collected, in step S1010 the static environment<br>
information are updated based on the received static device information.<br>
In step S1012 the message that static environment information have<br>
been updated is sent to the associating device 208. The associating<br>
device 208 will do further processing.<br>
Those skilled in the art can recognize that the above-mentioned<br>
operation can be started when a static device is newly connected or when<br>
the position of a static device has been changed.<br>
As the mobile devices have become more and more popular, a plenty of<br>
dynamic environment information is included in addition to the above<br>
static environment information, these dynamic environment information<br>
include mobile device information and/or user information. The<br>
environment information usually is also dynamically changeable. When the<br>
devices or networks in the real world observe that the surrounding<br>
environment has changed, they will notify the system of the change so that<br>
the system can update the 'observed* environment information. For<br>
example, a camera has the ability of visually observing the surrounding<br>
environment, thus the environment information captured by the camera will<br>
vary with the elapse of time. Moreover, for example, the fingerprint<br>
reader has the ability of sensing who touches it, thus the environment<br>
information captured by the fingerprint reader will change with the elapse<br>
of time and change of the users. Besides, another example of capturing<br>
the environment information is the known network capable of detecting the<br>
user position, for example, when a personnel enters a room by using<br>
his/her name card, the attendance checking system in the building can keep<br>
abreast of the current position of the personnel by obtaining the name<br>
card information of the personnel.<br>
In the present invention, the devices or networks capable of sensing<br>
the environment changes are called dynamic environment information<br>
capturing network. The environment change generally refers to the changes<br>
sensed by the dynamic environment information capturing network when an<br>
on-line physical devices are moving or a user is entering or leaving a<br>
room. The dynamic environment information capturing network includes but<br>
is not limited to: the wireless network such as GSM, CDMA; the OPS<br>
positioning system; the bluetooth devices; the devices or systems having<br>
the hearing functionality; the devices or systems having the vision<br>
functionality; the devices or systems having the functionality of<br>
capturing the human physiological characteristics data; the sensor<br>
networks constituted by the agent devices and so on.<br>
The present invention provides a dynamic environment information<br>
management portion 4 to effect the management of the dynamic environment<br>
information.<br>
AB shown in fig. 2, the dynamic environment information management<br>
portion 4 includes a dynamic environment information capturing network<br>
manager 205 and a dynamic environment information storage 207.<br>
The dynamic environment information capturing network manager 205<br>
receives the changes of the environment sensed by the above-mentioned<br>
various dynamic environment information capturing network from the<br>
network, and stores these changes in the dynamic environment information<br>
storage 207.<br>
In the present invention, as the dynamic environment information can<br>
be received from many dynamic environment information capturing network,<br>
thus preferably, in the dynamic environment information storage 207 one<br>
storage area is allocated for each dynamic environment information<br>
capturing network to store the dynamic environment information of that<br>
network. For the dynamic environment information capturing network<br>
capable of determining the position of the mobile devices or the users<br>
such as the wireless network, e.g. GSM, CDMA; the GPS positioning system;<br>
the attendance checking system installed inside the company, the structure<br>
of the dynamic environment information data items are for example the<br>
following:<br>
Space scope<br>
• sub-space scope 1<br>
the mobile device A ID; the position of mobile device A<br>
(optional),-. ..<br>
the mobile device B ID; the position of mobile device B<br>
(optional);...<br>
the user A ID; the position of user A (optional);<br>
sub-space scope 2<br>
the mobile device C ID; the position of mobile<br>
device C (optional);...<br>
the mobile device D ID; the position of mobile device D<br>
(optional);...<br>
the mobile user B ID; the position of mobile user B<br>
(optional);...<br>
Wherein the space scope is for example a building where the company<br>
is situated; the sub-space IB for example the rooms divided inside the<br>
company; mobile device ID is the ID of the mobile devices moving in the<br>
sub-spaces.<br>
For the dynamic environment information capturing network incapable<br>
of determining the position of the mobile devices or the users but capable<br>
o£ capturing the space relationship between the mobile devices or the<br>
space relationship between the users or the space relationship between the<br>
users and devices, such as the camera monitoring system installed inside<br>
the company and the sensor network constituted by the agent devices<br>
provided by the present invention, the structure of its dynamic<br>
environment information data items includes for example:<br>
ID of the dynamic environment information capturing network<br>
the captured ID information of the mobile devices or user<br>
or other mapping information and -so on<br>
For example, for the camera monitoring system, its dynamic<br>
information data items may include the camera ID and the user<br>
physiological characteristics data captured thereby.<br>
Next the process of collecting the dynamic environment information by<br>
the sensor network constituted by the agent devices provided by the<br>
present invention will be described in details.<br>
Below a flow diagram of the process of collecting the dynamic<br>
environment information in the centralized form of fig. 6 will be<br>
explained with reference to fig. 11 by taking device 1 as an example.<br>
Firstly, in step SHOO, when device 1 enters the information<br>
collection scope of the device information collecting device 510, the<br>
device information collecting device 510 collects the device information<br>
of device 1 broadcast by itself via its own agent device 100.<br>
In step S1102 the device information collecting device 510 sends the<br>
collected device ID information to the dynamic environment information<br>
capturing network 205.<br>
In step S1104 the dynamic environment information capturing network<br>
manager 205 stores the received device ID information of device 1 into the<br>
storage area in the dynamic environment information storage 207 allocated<br>
for the sensor network constituted by the device information collecting<br>
device 510 and devices 1 - N.<br>
In step S1106 the dynamic environment information capturing network<br>
manager 205 searches for the stored contents in other storage spaces and<br>
deletes the records having the ID of device 1. In such a way, it is<br>
guaranteed that the dynamic environment information management portion 4<br>
can always keep the newest dynamic environment information.<br>
In step S1108 the dynamic environment information capturing network<br>
manager 205 notifies the associating device 5 of the change of the dynamic<br>
environment information. The associating device 5 will do processing<br>
later.<br>
In such a way, the system can keep abreast of the situation of the<br>
mobile devices sensed by the device information collecting device 510 for<br>
later use in the association operations.<br>
Next a flow diagram of the process of collecting the dynamic<br>
environment information in the ad hoc form of fig. 8 will be described<br>
with reference to fig. 12.<br>
Firstly, in step S1200 the agent device of a device receives the<br>
information broadcast by the agent device of another device.<br>
In step S1202 the agent device builds a mapping table by using the<br>
received ID information of another device and the ID of its own main<br>
device,<br>
Then in step S1204 the agent device judges whether it itself can<br>
communicate with the dynamic environment information capturing network<br>
manager 205, i.e. whether it has the functionality of notification. Itoe<br>
judgment ia performed by, for example, sending a query to the dynamic<br>
environment information capturing network manager 205 and receiving a<br>
response therefrom, or by pre-storing the corresponding access parameters<br>
of the dynamic environment information capturing network manager 205 into<br>
the storage unit of the agent device.<br>
When it is judged that the agent device can not communicate with the<br>
dynamic environment information capturing network manager 205, in step<br>
S1206 the agent device broadcasts the built mapping table and the ID of<br>
the main device to which it itself is attached, and the neighboring agent<br>
devices receive the broadcast content. The neighboring agent device also<br>
builds a mapping table which includes the mapping relationship between the<br>
ID of the neighboring agent devices and the ID of the device itself and<br>
the mapping relationship between the ID of the device itself and the ID of<br>
another agent devices. Those skilled in the art can recognize that the<br>
above mapping relationship may include multi-level mapping depending on<br>
the number of transfer of the mapping table.<br>
When it is judged that the agent device can communicate with the<br>
dynamic environment information capturing network manager 205, in step<br>
S1208 the agent device sends the built mapping table information to the<br>
dynamic environment information capturing network manager 205 via the<br>
transceiving unit.<br>
In step S1209 the dynamic environment information capturing network<br>
manager 205 judges whether the held dynamic environment information need<br>
to be updated based on the received mapping table information. When it is<br>
judged that the dynamic environment information needs not to be updated,<br>
the process terminates. Otherwise the process proceeds to step S1210.<br>
In step S1210 the dynamic environment information capturing network<br>
manager 205 updates the mapping relationship in the storage space of the<br>
sensor network constituted by the devices 1 - N based on the received<br>
mapping table information.<br>
In step S1212 the dynamic environment information capturing network<br>
manager 205 searches for the storage contents in other storage spaces and<br>
deletes the records having the ID of the corresponding devices. In such a<br>
way, it is guaranteed that the dynamic environment information management<br>
portion 4 can always keep the newest dynamic environment information.<br>
In step S1214 the dynamic environment information capturing network<br>
manager 205 notifies the associating device 5 of the change of the dynamic<br>
environment information. The associating device 5 will do processing<br>
later.<br>
In such a way, the system can keep abreast of the mutual relationship<br>
between the mobile devices sensed by the device 1 for later use in the<br>
association operations.<br>
Those skilled in the art can recognize that the above two forms can<br>
be used separately or cooperatively to notify the dynamic environment<br>
information capturing network manager 205 in the system of the mutual<br>
relationship information of the devices. For example, in the cooperative<br>
operation, device 1 sends the device relationship of all the devices 1<br>
through N to the device information collecting device 510 that can cover<br>
device 1, and then the device information collecting device 510 sends the<br>
device relationship information of devices 1 through N and other dynamic<br>
environment information to the dynamic environment information capturing<br>
network manager 205.<br>
Those skilled in the art can recognize that the operations of the<br>
above fig. 11 and fig. 12 can also be used to collect the mutual mapping<br>
relationship between the users and further between the mobile users and<br>
the mobile devices under mobile environment.<br>
Those skilled in the art can also recognize that the operations of<br>
the above fig. 11 and fig. 12 can also be used to collect the mutual<br>
mapping relationship between the devices and the users under static<br>
environment so as to collect the relationship between various devices<br>
and/or users under static and dynamic environments. By using the<br>
environment information capturing network constituted by the agent devices<br>
to capture the environment information, a quick and convenient way is<br>
provided for collecting the device information and user information as<br>
much as possible.<br>
The process of sending the dynamic environment information to the<br>
dynamic environment information capturing network manager 205 by other<br>
dynamic environment information capturing networks is similar to the<br>
process described, in the above fig, 11. The difference is that instead of<br>
using the device information collecting device 510, a server of the<br>
dynamic environment information capturing network <in the case of that></in>
network is &amp; separate sensing device, the sensing device itself can be<br>
regarded as a server) sends the captured dynamic environment information<br>
to the dynamic environment information capturing network manager 205. The<br>
dynamic environment information also varies with different dynamic<br>
environment information capturing network, such as the physiological<br>
characteristics of the users. The process is shown in fig. 13.<br>
In step S1300 the dynamic environment information capturing network<br>
manager 205 receives the dynamic environment information captured by a<br>
dynamic environment information capturing network from this network.<br>
In step S1302 the dynamic environment information capturing network<br>
manager 205 judges whether the dynamic environment information stored in<br>
the dynamic environment information storage 207 needs to be updated. When<br>
it is determined that the dynamic environment information does not need<br>
to be updated, the process terminates. Otherwise the process proceeds to<br>
step S1304.<br>
In step S1304 the dynamic environment information capturing network<br>
manager 205 updates the information in the corresponding storage spaces<br>
based on the received dynamic environment information.<br>
In step S1306 the dynamic environment information capturing network<br>
manager 205 searches for the storage content in other storage spaces and<br>
deletes the user object information and the device object information<br>
related to the dynamic environment information. In such a way, it is<br>
guaranteed that the dynamic environment information management portion 4<br>
can always keep the newest dynamic environment information.<br>
In step S1308 the dynamic environment information capturing network<br>
manager 205 notifies the associating device 5 of the change of the dynamic<br>
environment information. The associating device 5 will do processing<br>
later.<br>
From the description below it will be understood that the static<br>
environment information and dynamic environment information collected by<br>
the present invention have a function of bridge for building the mutual<br>
relationship of the users and more available devices in the real world.<br>
The process of collecting and processing the environment information<br>
has been described. Next the operation of associating a user object with<br>
one or more available device objects will be described.<br>
The associating device 208 in fig. 2 associates a user object stored<br>
in the user object storage 202 with one or more device objects scored in<br>
the device object storage 206. If needed, the association operation will<br>
be carried out based on the environment information provided by the static<br>
environment information management portion 3 and the dynamic environment<br>
information management portion 4.<br>
Below three forms of building the association relationship according<br>
to the present invention will be described in details,<br>
The first form is to build up an association relationship between the<br>
user object and the device objects via the personal device (PD).<br>
As mentioned above, the information of the personal devices owned by<br>
a user is stored in the personal device data items of the user objects in<br>
the user object storage 202. And the device object information is stored<br>
in the device object storage 206.<br>
Thus the associating device 208 matches the types and the<br>
identification numbers of the personal devices in the personal device data<br>
items of the user objects with the types and the identification numbers in<br>
the basic information data items of the device objects so as to find the<br>
device objects having the same information as the user object so that an<br>
association relationship is built up between the user object and the<br>
device objects.<br>
For example, a user A in the real world has a personal device: i.e. a<br>
mobile phone X having the bluetooth functionality. As in the virtual<br>
world both the user object Al built for user A and the mobile phone object<br>
XI built for the mobile phone X include the type and the phone number of<br>
the mobile phone X, thus the associating device 208 can associate the user<br>
object Al with the mobile phone object XI by recognizing that the user<br>
object Al and the mobile phone object XI have the same type and phone<br>
number of the mobile phone.<br>
Though the above association operation is performed by utilizing the<br>
type and the identification number of the personal device, but the<br>
association operation can be performed by utilizing other information in<br>
the basic information data items of the personal device which can be used<br>
to identify the personal device, so long as the user and the personal<br>
device can be associated by matching.<br>
In order to reduce the association work load, the associating device<br>
208 may perform the filtering operation prior to the association<br>
operation, some devices are filtered out based on a certain conditions so<br>
that during the association operation it is no longer necessary to<br>
associate these devices. For example, the device objects, which are<br>
"off-line" in the statue information table, can be filtered out, because<br>
these devices do not have the ability to work for time being. Of course,<br>
the filtering step is not compulsory.<br>
According to the above.association form, the associating device 208<br>
of the present invention may associate a user object with the<br>
corresponding device objects by means of personal device identification<br>
information.<br>
In fig. 14, the user object A and the mobile phone device object A'<br>
belonging to the user are associated with each other by the first form.<br>
The second form is to utilize the physiological characteristics data<br>
to build an association relationship between the user object and the<br>
device objects.<br>
As stated previously, when a user is registering, the user manager<br>
200 puts its physiological characteristics information into the<br>
physiological characteristics data item of its user object.<br>
Many dynamic environment information capturing networks can also<br>
capture and sense the physiological characteristics information of the<br>
user. For example, a capturing network constituted by the video cameras<br>
can capture the user face image, a capturing network constituted by the<br>
sound capturing devices can capture the user sound characteristics. And<br>
as stated previously, all the dynamic environment information captured by<br>
the capturing network are stored in the dynamic environment information<br>
storage 207.<br>
Thus the associating device 208 matches the physiological<br>
characteristics data in the physiological characteristics data items of<br>
the user object with the dynamic environment information stored in the<br>
dynamic environment information storage 207 so as to find one or more<br>
device objects (or capturing network) having one or more identical<br>
physiological characteristics data as the user object so that an<br>
association relationship is built up between the user object and the<br>
corresponding device object.<br>
For example, in fig. 15; the user object A and the video camera<br>
device object C' are associated with each other by the second form.<br>
On the basis of the above two association forms, the user object A.<br>
can be associated with more device objects by utilizing the static<br>
environment information or the dynamic environment information.<br>
For example, in fig. 14, after the associating device 208 has built<br>
an association relationship between the user object A and the mobile phone<br>
device object A', the associating device 208 can further build the<br>
association relationship between the user object and more device objects<br>
on the basis of the collected static/dynamic environment information by<br>
using the mobile phone device object A' as a bridge. For example, an<br>
information provided by the GSM network that the mobile phone device<br>
object A1 is located in a meeting room of the company is stored in the<br>
dynamic environment information storage 207; while another information<br>
that in the meeting room there is further a printer resources is stored in<br>
the static environment information storage 203, then the associating<br>
device 208 builds up an association between the user object A and the<br>
printer resource based on these information.<br>
The right side of fig. 14 shows an example of building more<br>
association for the user object by using the environment information. The<br>
associating device 208 builds the association between the user object A<br>
and the device D', the device E' and the device P' captured by the<br>
capturing network in which the agent device of the mobile phone is located<br>
on the basis of the dynamic environment information collected by the<br>
capturing network of the agent devices containing the mobile phone device<br>
object A' by using the mobile phone device object A' of the user as a<br>
bridge.<br>
The right side of fig. 15 shows an example of building more<br>
association for the user object by using the environment information. The<br>
associating device 208 builds the association between the user object A<br>
and the device H', the device I' and the device J' captured by the<br>
capturing network in which the agent device of the video camera device<br>
object C' is located on the basis of the dynamic environment information<br>
collected by the capturing network in which the agent device of the video<br>
camera device object C' is located by using the video camera device object<br>
C' as a bridge.<br>
The third form is to build up an association relationship between the<br>
user object and the device objects via the social connections.<br>
As mentioned above, when a user is registering, if possible, the user<br>
manager 200 puts its social connections information into the social<br>
connections data items of its user object.<br>
Fig. 16 shows a schematic diagram of building an association between<br>
a user object and a device object by means of a social connections data<br>
item.<br>
For example, providing the associating device 208 has built some<br>
association relationship between user B and some device objects such as<br>
device objects K', L' and M'. If user A and user B have some social<br>
connections, then the associating device 208 builds up a relationship<br>
between user A and user B by means of the information in the social<br>
connections data items of user A object, and further builds up an<br>
association relationship with those device objects K', L' and M' that have<br>
already built an association relationship with user B.<br>
When the associating device 208 associates the user objects with the<br>
device objects, the three forms can be used separately or in any arbitrary<br>
combination. The present invention provides a flexible form for building<br>
the association relationship.<br>
By means of the associating device 208, an association relationship<br>
is built up between a user object and one or more available device<br>
objects.<br>
It should be noted that the association relationship built up for the<br>
user object with one or more available device objects by the associating<br>
device 208 may vary as well. For example, when a new device object is<br>
built, the associating device 208 associates the new device object with<br>
the corresponding user object. When the static/dynamic environment<br>
information changes, the associating device 208 will rebuild or modify the<br>
corresponding association relationship of the user object based on the<br>
changed environment information. Any influence that will affect the<br>
association relationship between the use object and the device object may<br>
initiate the rebuilding or modification operation of the association<br>
relationship of the corresponding user object by the associating device<br>
206. Thus, the associating device 208 can always keep the newest<br>
association relationship between the user object and the device object.<br>
The associating device 208 takes each user object and one or more<br>
device objects associated with the user object as a sentient network<br>
entity, and stores them in the sentient network storage 210.<br>
Fig. 17A - 17C show a process of the associating operation of an<br>
associating device.<br>
In step S1700 the associating device 208 monitors to judge whether a<br>
registration or a modification notice has been received from the user<br>
manager 200 or the physical device manager 204 and whether an environment<br>
information modification notice has' been received from the static/dynamic<br>
environment information manager 201 and 205.<br>
When it is determined that no notice has been received, the<br>
associating device 208 continues monitoring.<br>
When it is determined that a notice has been received from the user<br>
manager 200, the process proceeds to step S1702 to judge whether the<br>
notice is a registration notice or a modification notice. When it is<br>
determined that the notice is a registration notice, the process proceeds<br>
to step S1704, where the associating device 208 uses one of the above<br>
three forms or a combination of them to associate the newly registered<br>
user object. It should be noted that during the association operation,<br>
some of the device objects may be given up based on the favorite<br>
information stored in the user object such as the favorite information<br>
that the user refuses using some devices so that the device resources<br>
available to the user can be selected and tailored for the user.<br>
Furthermore, during the association operation, the device objects whose<br>
statuses are 'off-line* may be given up based on the statuses information<br>
of the device objects. Besides, during the association operation, some<br>
device objects may be further given up based on the authorization<br>
information on the device objects such as the privileges for accessing the<br>
36<br>
devices by the user. So the result is that the associated device objects<br>
are actually the device objects available to the user object.<br>
In step S1706, the user object and the device objects associated for<br>
the user object are stored in the sentient network storage 210 as one<br>
sentient network entity.<br>
Optionally, still in step S1708, the message that a new sentient<br>
network has been built is notified to the virtual device management<br>
portion 6 to let it do processing operation later.<br>
When it is determined that the notice is a modification notice in<br>
step S1702, the process proceeds to step S1710, the associating device<br>
notifies the virtual device management portion 6 of the message that the<br>
user object information has changed. Then it is judged based on the<br>
modified content whether the existing association relationship needs to be<br>
updated. The judgment can be performed based oni for example, whether the<br>
favorite information and/or the authorization information have changed.<br>
When it is determined that it is necessary to update, the process proceeds<br>
to step S1712 to do association operation based on the change of the user<br>
object. Otherwise the processing operation terminates.<br>
In step S1714 the corresponding sentient network stored in the<br>
sentient network storage 210 is updated by using the result of<br>
association.<br>
Optionally, in step S1715 the message that the sentient network has<br>
been updated is notified to the virtual device management portion 6 and<br>
let it do the processing later.<br>
When it is determined in step S1700 that a notice has been received<br>
from the physical device manager 204, the process proceeds to step S1716<br>
to judge whether the notice is a registration notice or &amp; notice about the<br>
change of the device information.<br>
When the judgment result is a registration notice, the process<br>
proceeds to step S1718 to perform the association operation for the newly<br>
registered device. The associating device 208 uses one of the above three<br>
forms or a combination of them to associate the newly registered user<br>
object. It is to be noted that during the association operation, some of<br>
the device objects may be given up based on the user favorite information<br>
stored in the associated user object so that the device resources<br>
available to the user can be tailored for the user. Furthermore, during<br>
the association operation, the device objects whose status is "off-line*<br>
may be given up based on the status information of the device objects, so<br>
that the associated device objects are actually the device objects<br>
available to the user object.<br>
After the newly registered device object is associated with the<br>
corresponding user object, in step S1720 the content of the corresponding<br>
sentient network stored in the sentient network storage 210 is updated by<br>
using the result of association.<br>
Optionally, in step S1722 the message that the sentient network has<br>
been updated is notified to the virtual device management portion 6 and<br>
let it do the processing later.<br>
When in Btep S1716 it is determined that the notice is a notice of<br>
the change of the device information, the process proceeds to step S1724<br>
to notify the virtual device management portion 6 of the message that the<br>
sentient network has been updated. It is judged based on the content of<br>
the change whether the existing association relationship needs to be<br>
updated. Preferably, when the status of the device changes, e.g., from an<br>
on-line status to an off-line status, or from an off-line status to an<br>
on-line status, it is determined that it is necessary to update. When it<br>
is determined that it is necessary to update, the process proceeds to<br>
step S1726, and the association operation is performed based on the<br>
changed content of the device object. Otherwise the processing<br>
terminates.<br>
In step S1728 the corresponding sentient network stored in the<br>
sentient network storage 210 is updated by using the result of<br>
association.<br>
Optionally, in step S1730 the message that the sentient network has<br>
been changed is notified to the virtual device management portion 6 and<br>
let it do the processing later.<br>
When in step S1700 it is determined that the notice is from the<br>
static/dynamic environment information manager 205 and 207, the process<br>
proceeds to step S1740, where the associating device 208 performs the<br>
association operation for one or more corresponding user objects based on<br>
the changed environment information.<br>
in step S1742 one or more corresponding sentient networks stored in<br>
the sentient network storage 210 is updated by using the result of<br>
association.<br>
Optionally, in step S1744 the message that one or more sentient<br>
networks have been updated is notified to the virtual device management<br>
portion 6 and let it do the processing later.<br>
Those skilled in the art can recognize that the above operation of<br>
notifying the virtual device management portion 6 is not compulsory.<br>
Searching for the available device object resources for a user object<br>
by means of the association operation and storing them as a sentient<br>
network entity can keep abreast of the information about the devices<br>
available to the user in the real world.<br>
From the above description, by collecting the information of the<br>
devices, the users and the environment in the real world and searching for<br>
the available device resources for the user based on the collected<br>
information, the present invention provides a sentient network generating<br>
method and device, which provide a base for sharing the resources and<br>
making the devices working cooperatively.<br>
When a user in the real world himself/herself requests to access a<br>
service, or when a service provider himself/herself requests to provide a<br>
service to a user, the virtual device management portion of the present<br>
invention builds a virtual device operating environment for the user. A<br>
virtual device serves as a service interface between the user and the<br>
service provider. The virtual device will make full use of the overall<br>
capabilities of all the physical devices currently available to the user<br>
so as to provide services for the user.<br>
Therefore, when the service provider provides service information to<br>
the user, the user only has to interact with the virtual devices. The<br>
information sent to the service provider is transferred by the virtual<br>
device. The virtual device performs a coordinative management of the<br>
devices available to the user so as to provide services to the user<br>
according to the service requirements of the user and/or the device<br>
capabilities.<br>
Previously the process for information collection and association<br>
processing of the present invention have been described, a sentient<br>
network has been, built up for a user object in the virtual world, the<br>
sentient network includes the information of the user object and the<br>
device objects available to the user object. Thus, the sentient network<br>
can be regarded as an available device object material base. Later when<br>
the virtual device will be described, the sentient network will be used as<br>
an available device object material base for the virtual device. However,<br>
the available device objects material base for the virtual device can be<br>
obtained by other ways instead of using the sentient network of the<br>
present invention. For example, the available device object material base<br>
may be obtained by means of other available technology capable of<br>
providing the information of the physical devices currently available to<br>
the user. Thus, the available device object material base used by the<br>
virtual device of the present invention is not limited to the<br>
above-mentioned sentient network, which is only one example of the<br>
available device object material base usable by the virtual device.<br>
Below the processing operation of the virtual device management<br>
portion 6 will be described in details.<br>
The virtual device management portion 6 of the present invention<br>
generates a virtual device for each user object accepting the service. It<br>
provides adequate services for the user object based on the generated<br>
virtual device.<br>
As shown in fig. 18, the virtual device includes a service processing<br>
portion 1800, a negotiating portion 1802, a controlling portion 1804, a<br>
monitoring portion 1806, a service information redistributing portion 1808<br>
and an interface portion 1810.<br>
The controlling portion 1804 is used for coordinating the control<br>
operations of other portions constituting the virtual device and<br>
transferring the information.<br>
The interface portion 1810 is the interface used to interact with the<br>
sentient network generating portion, the information interaction between<br>
other portions of the virtual device and the components of the sentient<br>
network generating portion is carried out by the interface portion 1810.<br>
Besides, the user object interacts with the virtual device via the<br>
interface portion 1810.<br>
The monitoring portion 1806 is in charge of interacting with the<br>
sentient network generating portion, monitoring the sentient network and<br>
keeping in breast of the real construction of the sentient network.<br>
The negotiating portion 1802 is in charge of interacting with the<br>
service provider to select most suitable service type for the user based<br>
on the sentient network.<br>
When the user accepts a concrete service, the service processing<br>
portion 1800 is in charge of the information interaction between the user<br>
and the service providers.<br>
The service information redistributing portion 1808 determines the<br>
device object/combination of the device objects to accept the requirements<br>
for services based on the service types determined by the negotiating<br>
portion 1802, distributes the user object information sent by the service<br>
processing portion 1800 to the corresponding device object and is<br>
responsible for coordinating the operations among the device objects when<br>
a combination of them is used.<br>
Next the operations of the above portions will be described in<br>
details.<br>
At first a description is given with reference to fig. 19, when a<br>
user object sends a service request via the device object in the sentient<br>
network, the virtual device selects the service types and the device<br>
objects/the combination of the device objects for the user object.<br>
Firstly, in step S1900 the interface portion 1810 receives a service<br>
request sent by a user object from a device object in the sentient network<br>
and transfers the service request to the controlling portion 1804, the<br>
controlling portion 1804 transfers the service request to the negotiating<br>
portion 1802 and notifies the monitoring portion 1806 of the service<br>
request event.<br>
In atep S1902, in response to the receipt of the service request<br>
event, the monitoring portion 1806 obtains the available device object<br>
information and/or the user object information from the sentient network<br>
of the user object. Then the obtained device object information is sent<br>
to the negotiating portion 1802 via the controlling portion 1804.<br>
In step S1904, in response to the receipt of the service request, the<br>
negotiating portion 1802 sends the service request to the corresponding<br>
service provider to ask the service provider to provide the service type<br>
information and the device object capabilities requirements information of<br>
the service types that can satisfy the service request. The service types<br>
are for example one or more levels of service categories provided by the<br>
service provider to satisfy the service request, the device object<br>
capabilities requirement information are for example the device object<br>
capabilities of the required service types.<br>
In step S1906, in response to the service type information and the<br>
device object capabilities requirements information received from the<br>
service provider, the negotiating portion 1802 selects a service type<br>
suiting the capabilities of the available device object from the service<br>
types provided by the service provider based on device object information<br>
and/or user object information received from the negotiating portion 1806<br>
and notifies the service provider of the selected service type, and sends<br>
the device object capabilities requirements information corresponding to<br>
the service type to the service information redistributing portion 1808<br>
via the controlling portion 1804.<br>
Optionally, in the above selection process there may be a reference<br>
made to the personal tailoring requirement of the user in determining the<br>
service type.<br>
For example, in step S1906, the currently available device objects<br>
can be further filtered based on the user favorite information of the<br>
device to accept the services obtained from the user object preliminarily<br>
by the monitoring portion 1806 or obtained by querying the user, the<br>
favorite information may be for example what physical devices the user<br>
prefers to use in accepting the video services, what devices to use in<br>
accepting the audio services and so on. Then a service type suiting the<br>
capabilities of the filtered available device object is selected from the<br>
service types provided by the service provider.<br>
Optionally, the negotiating portion 1802 may select preliminarily<br>
some service types suiting the capabilities of the available device object<br>
from the service types provided by the service provider, and then<br>
determines a service type by querying the user object, or further<br>
determines a service type with reference to, for example, the service<br>
requirements of the user in the favorite information of the user object.<br>
Fig. 20 shows the process of a virtual device selecting a service<br>
type and a device object/a combination of the device objects for a user<br>
object when the user object sends a service request via the device object<br>
in the sentient network.<br>
In this form, the operations of steps S2000 and S2002 are the same as<br>
those of steps S1900 and S1902 and thus can be omitted.<br>
In step 82004, in response to the receipt of the service request, the<br>
negotiating portion 1802 sends the service request and the available<br>
device object information and/or the user object information received from<br>
the monitoring portion 1806 to the corresponding service provider to ask<br>
the service provider to provide the service type which can satisfy the<br>
service request baeed on available device object capabilities.<br>
In step S2006, in response to the service type information received<br>
from the service provider, the negotiating portion 1802 selects a service<br>
type for the user and notifies the service provider of the selected<br>
service type, and sends the device object capabilities requirements<br>
information corresponding to the service type to the service information<br>
redistributing portion 1808 via the controlling portion 1804.<br>
Optionally, in the above step S2004, the currently available device<br>
objects can be further filtered based on the user favorite information of<br>
the device to accept the services obtained from the user object<br>
preliminarily by the monitoring portion 1806 or obtained by querying the<br>
user, then the filtered device object information are provided to the<br>
service provider.<br>
Optionally, in step S2006 the negotiating portion 1802 may provide a<br>
plurality of service types provided by the service provider to the user,<br>
and then determines a service type by querying the user object, or further<br>
determines a service type with reference to, for example, the service<br>
requirements of the user in the favorite information of the user object.<br>
By means of the processing of the above negotiating portion 1802, a<br>
service type is determined for the user object to accept the service<br>
information.<br>
Next the process for providing service of the determined service type<br>
for the user will be explained.<br>
The negotiating portion 1802 further notifies the monitoring portion<br>
1806 of the filtered device object identification information or the<br>
device object Identification information that has been given up based on<br>
the user information via the controlling portion 1804.<br>
Fig. 21 shows a process flow diagram for providing a service to a<br>
user object.<br>
Firstly, in step S2100 the service processing portion 1800 receives<br>
the provided service information of the selected service type from the<br>
service provider.<br>
In step S2102 the service processing portion 1800 sends the received<br>
service information to the service information redistributing portion 1808<br>
via the controlling portion 1804.<br>
In step S2104 the service information redistributing portion 1808<br>
obtains the available device object information from the monitoring<br>
portion 1806, and if needed, obtains the device object information given<br>
up during filtering of the device object and/or the favorite information<br>
of the user object referred to, and determines the device<br>
object/combination of the device objects to receive the service<br>
information based on the device object capabilities requirement<br>
information received from the negotiating portion 1802.<br>
In step S2106 the service information redistributing portion 1808<br>
distributes the service information to the determined device<br>
object/combination of the device objects via the controlling portion 1810.<br>
When necessary, a synchronization control operation is performed among the<br>
device objects, e.g. when the service information flow among the device<br>
objects needs to be synchronized.<br>
In the process of the service provider providing services for the<br>
user objects, all the information are interchanged between the user<br>
objects and the service provider via the virtual device. The interaction<br>
information sent by the user object to the service provider is first sent<br>
to the controlling portion 1804 by the interface portion 1810. The<br>
controlling portion 1804 transfers the interaction information to the<br>
service processing portion 1800 for the service processing portion 1800 to<br>
transfer the information to the service provider.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, a virtual device operation<br>
environment is provided for the user objects to accept the services of the<br>
service provider.<br>
Therefore, by interacting with the virtual device to provide the<br>
service information, the service provider does not have to consider the<br>
capabilities of the concrete devices for accepting the services so as to<br>
develop various user-oriented service types, which can satisfy different<br>
requirements of the users.<br>
Furthermore, the virtual device according to the present invention<br>
can select suitable service types for the users based on the service types<br>
provided by the service provider in connection with the available device<br>
object capabilities. Thus the quality of the service accepted by the<br>
users is guaranteed and the device capabilities around the users are fully<br>
utilized.<br>
In addition, the virtual device according to the present invention<br>
can determine the available device dbject to receive the service<br>
information or the available service types based on the personal tailoring<br>
requirements of the users so as to provide a user-centric service.<br>
Moreover, as the virtual device according to the present invention<br>
can keep abreast of the device resources available to the users, thus it<br>
can provide an efficient way for providing in time the information<br>
services for the users.<br>
In the process of providing service by the above-mentioned virtual<br>
device for the user objects, when the device object information or the<br>
user object information changes, e.g., when the number of the device<br>
objects has increased or decreased or when the favorite information of the<br>
user object has changed, the service quality of the service accepted by<br>
the user object may be affected. Thus, the virtual device of the present<br>
invention further has the ability of suitably adjusting the virtual device<br>
operation environment with the change of the sentient network.<br>
Fig. 22 shows the process of the adjustment of the virtual device<br>
operation environment carried out by the virtual device.<br>
Firstly, in step S2200 the monitoring portion 1806 monitors the<br>
information of the sentient network via the interface portion.<br>
In step S2202 the monitoring portion 1806 judges whether the<br>
information sentient network has changed. When it is monitored that the<br>
sentient network information has changed, the process proceeds to step<br>
S2206, otherwise the monitoring operation goes on.<br>
In step S2206 the monitoring portion 1606 determines the type of the<br>
change.<br>
When the type of the change is a decrease of the number of the device<br>
objects, the process proceeds to step S2208 to judge whether the removed<br>
device object has been used to receive the service information. When the<br>
result of judgment is negative, the processing terminates. Otherwise the<br>
process proceeds to step S2210 to notify the service information<br>
redistributing portion 1808 of the decrease of the number of the device<br>
objects, then the service information redistributing portion 1808 judges<br>
whether there is any replacing device object/combination of the device<br>
objects. When there is a replacing device object/combination of the<br>
device objects, the process proceeds to step S2212 to notify the service<br>
information redistributing portion 1808 to use the replacing device<br>
object/combination of the device objects to continue providing information<br>
service. In step S2214, in response to the receipt of the notice, the<br>
service information redistributing portion 1808 continues providing<br>
information service to the replacing device object/combination of the<br>
device objects.<br>
When in step S2210 it is judged that there is no replacing device<br>
object/combination of the device objects, the process proceeds to step<br>
S2216, where the service information redistributing portion 1808 asks the<br>
negotiating portion 1802 to determine again the service type and notify<br>
the controlling portion 1804 to keep the current service progress<br>
information and temporarily stop providing services to the user objects.<br>
In step S2218 the negotiating portion 1802 sends the current service<br>
progress information to the service provider and determines again a new<br>
service type for the user object according to the steps S1904 - S1906 of<br>
fig. 19 or the steps S2004 - S2006 of fig. 20.<br>
In step S2220 the service processing portion 1800 continues receiving<br>
the interrupted service of the new service type from the service provider,<br>
and the service information redistributing portion 1808 determines the new<br>
device objects/combination of the device objects.<br>
Then step 32222 continues providing service information of the new<br>
service type for the user object by using the newly determined device<br>
objects/combination of the device objects.<br>
When in step 32206 it is judged that the number of the device objects<br>
increases, as this will not affect the service information providing<br>
operation, thus the process terminates. But those skilled in the art can<br>
recognize that when the number of the device objects increases, it is<br>
possible that the negotiating portion 1802 determines again a service type<br>
based on the added device object for the user object so as to enhance the<br>
service quality.<br>
When in step S2206 it is judged that the favorite information of the<br>
user object has changed, the process proceeds to step S2224 to judge<br>
whether this change will affect the selection of the current device<br>
objects/combination of the device objects used to accept the service<br>
information. When there is no affection, the processing terminates.<br>
Otherwise the process proceeds to step S2210 to do further processing.<br>
Thus, the virtual device according to the present invention can<br>
adjust the form of providing the services based on the change of the user<br>
sentient network information so as to provide a more flexible information<br>
providing form to dynamically suit the instant user environment or instant<br>
user requirements.<br>
The virtual device according to the present invention can selects a<br>
suitable information presentation form for the service information sent to<br>
the user from the side of the service provider and presents it to the<br>
user.<br>
Fig. 23 shows a processing flow diagram, wherein the service<br>
information is sent to the user from the side of the service provider.<br>
Firstly, in step S2300 the service provider sends a notice to the<br>
negotiating portion 1802 of planning to send the service information to<br>
the user object and sends the service types to be provided and the<br>
corresponding device object capabilities requirements information to the<br>
negotiating portion 1802.<br>
In step S2302, in response to the receipt of the notice, the<br>
negotiating portion 1802 requests the monitoring portion 1806 to send the<br>
sentient network information of the user object via the controlling<br>
portion 1804.<br>
In step S2304, in response to the receipt of the request, the<br>
monitoring portion 1806 obtains the available device object information<br>
and/or the user object information from the sentient network of the user<br>
object via the interface portion 1810. Then the obtained device object<br>
information is sent to the negotiating portion 1802 via the controlling<br>
portion 1804.<br>
In step S2306 the negotiating portion 1802 selects a service type<br>
suiting the capabilities of the available device object from the service<br>
types provided by the service provider based on the device object<br>
information received from the monitoring portion 1806 and notifies the<br>
service provider of the selected service type.<br>
Optionally, in the above selection process it is possible to<br>
determine a service type with reference to the personal tailoring<br>
requirements of the user.<br>
For example, the currently available device objects can be further<br>
filtered based on the user favorite information of the device to accept<br>
the services obtained preliminarily from the user object by the monitoring<br>
portion 1806 or obtained by querying the user, the favorite information<br>
may be for example what physical devices the user prefers to use in<br>
accepting the video services, what devices to use in accepting the audio<br>
services and so on. Then a service type suiting the capabilities of the<br>
filtered available device object is selected from the service types<br>
provided by the service provider.<br>
Optionally, the negotiating portion 1802 may select preliminarily<br>
some service types suiting' the capabilities of the available device object<br>
from the service types provided by the service provider, and then<br>
determines a service type by querying the user object, or further<br>
determines a service type with reference to, for example, the service<br>
requirements of the user in the favorite information of the user object.<br>
Then the service information is sent to the user object according to<br>
the flow diagram shown in fig. 21.<br>
Fig. 24 shows another processing flow diagram, wherein the service<br>
information is sent to the user from the side of the service provider.<br>
Firstly, in step S2400 the service provider sends a notice to the<br>
negotiating portion 1802 of planning to send the service information to<br>
the user object.<br>
In step S2402, in response to the receipt of the notice, the<br>
negotiating portion 1802 requests the monitoring portion 1806 to send the<br>
sentient network information of the user object via the controlling<br>
portion 1804.<br>
In step S2404, in response to the receipt of the request, the<br>
monitoring portion 1806 obtains the available device object information<br>
and/or the user object information from the sentient network of the user<br>
object via the interface portion 1810. Then the obtained device object<br>
information is sent to the negotiating portion 1802 via the controlling<br>
portion 1804.<br>
In step S2406, the negotiating portion 1802 sends the sentient<br>
network information received from the monitoring portion 1806 to the<br>
corresponding service provider to ask the service provider to determine<br>
one or more service types which can satisfy the service information based<br>
on the device information in the sentient network.<br>
In step S2408, in response to the service type information received<br>
from the service provider, the negotiating portion 1802 selects a service<br>
type for the user and notifies the service provider of the selected<br>
service type.<br>
Optionally, in the above step S2406, the currently available device<br>
objects can be further filtered based on the user favorite information of<br>
the device to accept the services obtained from the user object<br>
preliminarily by the monitoring portion 1806 or obtained by querying the<br>
user, then the filtered device object capabilities information are<br>
provided to the service provider.<br>
Optionally, in step S2408 the negotiating portion 1802 may provide a<br>
plurality of service types provided by the service provider to the user,<br>
and then determines a service type by querying the user object, or further<br>
determines a service type with reference to, for example, the service<br>
requirements of the user in the favorite information of the user object.<br>
Then the service information is sent to the user object according to<br>
the flow diagram shown in fig. 21.<br>
Optionally, the virtual device of the present invention specially<br>
sends the various parts of the virtual device and the interactive control<br>
information between the service provider and the users to a physical<br>
device of the user to use the physical device as a 'remote controller* for<br>
the user controlling purpose. Thus, the controlling portion 1804 of the<br>
present invention may include a control information management portion<br>
(not shown) used to send the control information to be sent to the user to<br>
a device designated by the user or to a device selected from the available<br>
devices by the virtual device via a control information interaction<br>
interface (not shown), on which the control information displayed can be<br>
used by the user to operate all the other devices. The control<br>
information sent by the user to the virtual device is also transferred by<br>
the control information management portion, via the control information<br>
interaction interface, to the monitoring portion, the negotiating portion<br>
or the service processing portion.<br>
Furthermore, the virtual device of the present invention can further<br>
select a suitable service type used to provide services for the users<br>
based on the service information provided by the service provider.<br>
It is to be noted that the above described implementations are only<br>
used for illustrating the present invention and should not be used to<br>
limit the present invention.<br>
Moreover, the above-mentioned operating processes may be implemented<br>
in the form of computer executable programs stored in various media.<br>
These media include but are not limited to: various storage and storing<br>
units, the semiconductor devices, the magnetic and magneto-optical disks<br>
and other media suitable for storing information.<br><br><br><br>
