DESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION CONTAINING<br>
PROSTAGLANDIN<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition which is an oil-in-water emulsion comprising a prostaglandin F2a derivative, an oil, a water-soluble polymer and water, as well as a method of suppressing degradation of prostaglandin F2a in the composition.<br>
Background Art<br>
Prostaglandin is a physiologically active substance derived from a polyunsaturated fatty acid, and has various important pharmacological and physiological actions at a very small amount, and therefore, various derivatives thereof have been synthesized and developed for medicine.     For example, derivatives of prostaglandin F2a are useful as a medicament for treating glaucoma or ocular hypertension, and some eye drops have already been developed and marketed.    However, in order to prepare an aqueous preparation of a derivative of prostaglandin, we should overcome some problems that prostaglandin and a derivative thereof are poorly soluble in water and, when dissolved in water, they are easily degraded, and further a content of prostaglandin and its derivative is reduced due to adsorption onto a container.<br>
So far, as an aqueous liquid preparation of prostaglandin or a derivative thereof, for example, a composition obtained by solubilizing and stabilizing prostaglandin by formation of a complex with etherized cyclodextrin (see Patent Document l), a<br>
1<br><br>
fat emulsion of a stable PGE1analogue (see Patent Document 2), a prostaglandin composition containing a polyethoxylated castor oil (see Patent Document 3), a prostaglandin fat emulsion containing an purified olive oil, phospholipid and water, which can be intravenously administered (see Patent Document 4), and an eye drop containing a prostaglandin derivative in which a nonionic surfactant and/or an antioxidant is blended (see Patent Document 5) are disclosed.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
The present invention will be explained in more detail.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is an oil-in-water emulsion containing an oil, a water-soluble polymer and water together with a prostaglandin F2a derivative. By adopting such a dosage form, degradation of a prostaglandin F2a derivative can be remarkably suppressed.<br>
Prostaglandin F2a derivative used in the present invention includes a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and ester thereof. Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt include salts with an organic base e.g. an alkali metal such as sodium and potassium, an alkaline earth metal such as calcium and magnesium, and an ammonium salt, and salts with an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid and phosphoric acid, and an organic acid such as acetic acid, citric acid, and succinic acid.     Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable ester include esters of lower<br>
4<br><br>
alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, pentyl and hexyl.<br>
Examples of the prostaglandin F2a derivative to be blended in the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention include latanoprost, isopropyl unoprostone, travoprost, and bimatoprost, and compounds described in JP-A No.2002-161037 (aforementioned Patent Document 5) and, inter alia, latanoprost is preferable.     The prostaglandin F2a derivative can be blended in the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention at a lower limit of about 0.0001 (W/V)%, preferably about 0.001 (W/V)%, and an upper limit of about 0.4 (W/V)%, preferably about 0.05 (W/V)%.<br>
The oil used in the present invention is not particularly limited, but medium chain fatty acid triglyceride, or an animal oil or vegetable oil containing fatty acid triglyceride as a main component, or both of them may be used.    Among them, medium chain fatty acid triglyceride is more preferable.    Medium chain fatty acid triglyceride refers to saturated fatty acid triglyceride of the carbon number of 4 to 12, or a mixture thereof a majority of which consists of fatty acid triglyceride having such carbon numbers.     Practically, a product containing fatty acid triglyceride of the carbon number of 8 (caprylic acid) or 10 (capric acid) as a main component obtained by hydrolyzing a palm oil, or a palm kernel oil once, purifying, and combining again can be used.     Examples of the products (trade names) include Miglyol (Mitsuba Boeki), Coconade (Kao), ODO (Nisshin Oillio), Panasate (Nippon Oil &amp; Fats Co., Ltd.), TCG-M (Higher Alcohol Industry), and Actor (Riken Vitamin) and, inter alia, Miglyol is preferable.

These oils can be used alone, or in combination with two or more appropriately.<br>
An amount of the oil to be blended in the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be appropriately determined depending on an amount of a prostaglandin F2a derivative as far as an oil-in-water emulsion is formed, and a lower limit is about 0.005W/V%, preferably about 0.1W/V%, and an upper limit is about 20W7V%, preferably about 5W/V%.<br>
In the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, a water-soluble polymer is used as an emulsifier.    In addition to this water-soluble polymer, as an emulsifier, the composition may be appropriately used by combining with phospholipid such as yolk lecithin, or a surfactant.<br>
Water-solubility in the water-soluble polymer means that 1g or more of the polymer compound can be dissolver in 100 g of water at 20°C. Examples of the water-soluble polymer include water-soluble cellulose compounds such as methylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl- cellulose and sodium cellulose, polyvinyl compounds such as polyvinyl alcohol, and polyvinylpyrrolidone, and polysaccharides such as alginic acid, xanthan gum, carrageenan, and chitosan, preferably polyvinyl alcohol and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, most<br>
6<br><br>

A pH of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is adjusted to 3 to 10, preferably 5 to 8.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be systemically administered in an injectable dosage form and also , can be used as an ophthalmological composition such as an eye drop which is locally administered.     Since degradation of a prostaglandin F2a derivative is remarkably suppressed, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is useful, particularly, for an eye drop which is usually continued to be used for a certain period of term after breaking the seal.<br>
The prostaglandin F2a derivative-containing pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be provided by a conventional method for preparing an oil-in-water emulsion.    As a preferable method, the following can be exemplified.     That is, the composition is prepared by adding an emulsifier and, if necessary, the aforementioned additives to water, adding an oil in which a prostaglandin F2a derivative is dissolved to obtain an emulsion, and adjusting a pH to 3 to 10 using a pH adjusting agent.    For performing emulsification uniformly, the publicly known means such as a mixer, a homogenizer, a homomixer, a microfluidizer, and a high-pressure homogenizer can be used.<br>
Examples<br>
The present inventions will be explained more specifically below by way of Test Examples and Preparation Examples, but these are merely exemplary, and the present inventions are not limited by them.<br>
[Test Example l] Stability of latanoprost in oil Test method<br>
As oils, an olive oil, a cottonseed oil, a peanut oil, a rapeseed<br>
9<br><br>
oil, a soybean oil, a tung oil and Miglyol 812 were used.     Five milligram of latanoprost (isopropyl-(Z)-7-[(1R,2R,3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxy-2-[(3R)-3-hydroxy-5-phenylpentyl]cyclopentyl]-5-hepta noate) was weighed, and each 1000 mg of each oil was added to latanoprost.     The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes with a magnetic stirrer so that latanoprost was dissolved to prepare about 1000 mg of a latanoprost oil solution (5 mg/g).    After dissolution was observed with naked eyes, a latanoprost oil solution was sampled, and a latanoprost content was measured by a HPLC method (day 0).     Each 500 µ L of these latanoprost oil solutions was dispensed in a glass sample bottle, and was stored at 60°C or 80°C for 7 days.     On seventh day, sampling was performed, a latanoprost content was measured, and a remaining rate was calculated from a ratio relative to a value measured on 0 day.    Each sampling was performed by weighing a constant amount of a latanoprost oil solution, and diluted with tetrahydrofuran and the following mobile phase A, and was supplied for measurement of HPLC.<br>
HPLC analysis conditions: a Waters Extera RP18, 5µm, Φ4.6x150 mm column was used.    As a mobile phase A, a mixture of acetonitrile- 10 mM sodium 1-octanesulfonate aqueous solution (pH 3.5)=35-65 was used, and as a mobile phase B, a mixture of acetonitrile: 10 mM sodium 1-octanesulfonate aqueous solution (pH 3.5)=10:90 was used.    A volume of injection was 50 µ L and, , a ultraviolet spectrophotometer (measuring wavelength: 210 nm) was used as a detector.    A column temperature was kept at around 25°C.    Analysis was performed by flowing the mobile phase A for 30 minutes and, thereafter, flowing the mobile phase B for 5 minutes for column washing, and the mobile phase A for 7 minutes for equilibration.    A flow rate of the mobile phase was<br>

Apparent from these test results, latanoprost dissolved in the oil was stable at 60°C in most of oils although it was warmed. At 80°C, latanoprost was particularly stable in Miglyol 812.<br>
[Test Example 2] Stability of latanoprost-containing oil-in-water<br>
emulsion<br>
Test method<br>
Into the mixture of 0.01 g of latanoprost, 2.0 g of Miglyol 812, 4.0 g of Gosenol EG05 (Trade name, partially saponified polyvinyl alcohol, The Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), 5.2 g of concentrated glycerin (Glycerin content- 98wt% or more), an appropriate amount of purified water was added to make l00mL in total.<br>
11<br><br>
That is, first, a part of purified water was warmed to about at 70°C, Gosenol and concentrated glycerin were added to dissolve them and obtained an aqueous solution.    Separately, latanoprost was a dissolved in Miglyol 812 to prepare an oily solution.    Then, the oily solution was gradually added to the aqueous solution while being stirred with a homomixer (ROBO MICS, Tokyo Tokushu Kika Kogyo Co., Ltd.), to perform rough emulsification (8000 rpm, 15 min), and sterile purified water was added to the rough emulsion to make a predetermined amount of the emulsion. This rough emulsion was finely-emulsified (1500 kgf/cm2, 10 pass) with a microfluidizer (M-110EH, Microfluidics Corporation) to obtain a 0.01% latanoprost emulsion (a stock liquid).<br>
This 0.01% latanoprost emulsion was diluted about two times with the following buffers having a pH of 5, 6 or 7, respectively. The pHs of the respective emulsions were adjusted to the same pHs as those of the original buffers with NaOH and/or HC1. Thus, six kinds of emulsions of latanoprost having the final concentration of 0.005% (Formulations 1 to 6) were prepared.<br><br>

Each 2 mL of each formulation was filled into a 2 mL brown glass ampoule, and stored at 4°C or 60°C for 4 weeks under light shielding.     The stored sample was sampled every week, and latanoprost content was measured by a HPLC method under the<br>
12<br><br>
same condition as that of Test Example 1.     Each sample was subjected to measurement as it was without dilution.    As a comparison control formation, Xalatan eye drop (trade name, containing 0.005% latanoprost, pH 6.5 to 6.9, manufactured by Pharmacia, Lot No. PT480) was stored under the same storing conditions, and latanoprost content was measured. Test results<br>
Latanoprost remaining rate in each formulation-%=(remaining amount at 60°C/remaining amount at 4°C)xl00 is shown in Table 2.<br>
