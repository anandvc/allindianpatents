				<td>MUSICAL INSTRUMENT HAVING<br>
EXCHANGEABLE COMPONENTS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] Embodiments of the present invention relate to U.S. Provisional<br>
Application Serial No. 60/386,365, filed June 6, 2002, entitled "Stringed Musical<br>
Instrument," which is hereby incorporated by reference herein and is a basis for a claim<br>
of priority.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Field of the Invention<br>
[0003] The present invention relates to the field of musical instruments and, in<br>
particular, to musical instruments having components that can be exchanged for other<br>
components.<br>
[0004] Description of Related Art:<br>
[0005] Innovation in the musical instrument arts is relatively infrequent. The<br>
basic design of many musical instruments has not changed in several hundred years. For<br>
example, the modern violin has essentially the same basic design today as it did in the<br>
16th century. The basic design of a piano as we know it today is relatively unchanged<br>
today from its beginnings in the early 18th century. The same can be said for many<br>
woodwind and brass instruments also.<br>
[0006] One of the last true innovations in the musical instrument arts occurred in<br>
the 1940s and 1950s, when the pioneering work of Les Paul and Leo Fender transformed<br>
the guitar from an acoustic instrument to an electric instrument. In a modern electric<br>
guitar, magnetic "pickups," formed by winding a coil around magnetic pole pieces, sense<br>
vibrations from metal strings on the guitar, portions of which are located within the<br><br>
magnetic field of the pole pieces. The vibration of the metal strings modulates the<br>
magnetic field of the pole pieces, which, in turn, induces a current signal in the windings<br>
of the coil. This signal is sent to an electronic amplifier, which amplifies the signal into<br>
an audible sound.<br>
[0007] Guitar players can change the sound produced by an electric guitar by<br>
changing the guitar's pickups, which are available in a wide variety of styles and with a<br>
wide variety of tonal characteristics. However, the sounds generated by a guitar begin<br>
with a vibrating string. Although a guitar's pickup may affect how the vibrations of the<br>
guitar strings are processed, the structural characteristics of the guitar itself are what<br>
determine the nature of the string's vibration and, consequently, the tonal qualities or<br>
timbre of the guitar. Thus, legendary electric guitars such as the Gibson LES PAUL and<br>
the Fender STRATOCASTER and TELECASTER have unique tonal characteristics not<br>
only because of the particular type of pickups used on those guitars, but also because of<br>
the unique structural design and shape of the guitars themselves.<br>
[0008] One drawback of modern musical instruments is the static nature of the<br>
structure of the instrument. Traditionally, if a musician purchased, for example, a violin<br>
having a particular timbre or tonal quality, the sound, looks and. ergonomics of that violin<br>
could not be changed. The sound of the violin would be dictated primarily by the<br>
structural characteristics of the violin, which would remain static and unchanged. If the<br>
musician ultimately became bored or disenchanted with the sound of that particular<br>
violin, the musician had no alternative but to purchase another violin. The same can be<br>
said for other instruments. This is one reason why so many musicians traditionally have<br>
painstakingly taken a vast amount of time when purchasing a new instrument. A<br>
musician has had to make sure that he or she is completely happy with the sound of that<br>
instrument, be it a violin, piano, guitar, woodwind, horn or other instrument, because<br>
once a purchase has been made, the musician has been "stuck" with the sound, looks and<br>
ergonomics of that instrument.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

[0034] A musical instrument having exchangeable components 10 according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention is shown generally in Figure 1. A perspective<br>
view of the musical instrument having exchangeable components 10 according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention is shown in Figure 2. The musical instrument<br>
having exchangeable components 10 shown in Figure 1 is a guitar and may include, for<br>
example, a core portion 18 and a body portion 11, the body portion 11 having a first body<br>
section 12a and a second body section 12b. The first body section 12a and the second<br>
body section 12b may be removably attached to the core portion 18 using one or more<br>
removable fasteners, such as, for example, screws.<br>
[0035] The body portion 11 may take a variety of shapes and sizes. The body<br>
portion 11 may be formed as a single component or may be formed as two or more<br>
components. According to an embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of body<br>
sections forming a body portion may be removably attached to one or more core portions<br>
to form a musical instrument. In the embodiment of the present invention shown in<br>
Figure 1, the body portion 11 is formed from two separate pieces, first body section 12a<br>
and second body section 12b, which are removably attached to the core portion 18.<br>
[0036] The first body section 12a and the second body section 12b may be<br>
contoured in a variety of ways. The contour of the first body section 12a and the second<br>
body section 12b may be dictated by a timbre or tonal characteristics desired by the user,<br>
or may be dictated by appearances or ergonomics desired by the user. For example, the<br>
contour of the first body section 12a and the second body section 12b may be formed to<br>
enhance or attenuate one or more frequency bands capable of being produced by the<br>
guitar. The contour of the first body section 12a and the second body section 12b may be<br>
formed to attenuate higher frequencies and enhance lower frequencies, for example, or<br>
may be formed to enhance higher frequencies and attenuate lower frequencies.<br>
[0037] The first body section 12a and the second body section 12b may be<br>
designed to achieve a wide variety of voices. For example, according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention, the first body section 12a and the second body section 12b may<br>
be designed to form a hollow sound chamber, similar to those found in acoustic guitars.<br><br>
The hollow sound chamber may be the result of two hollow pieces joined together or, in<br>
an. alternative embodiment, may be formed from a single hollow piece which attaches to<br>
the core portion.<br>
[0038] According to another embodiment of the present invention, the first body<br>
section 12a and the second body section 12b may be designed to form a semi-hollow<br>
sound chamber, similar to those found in electric-acoustic guitars or semi-hollow body<br>
electric guitars. The semi-hollow sound chamber may be the result of two semi-hollow<br>
pieces joined together or, in an alternative embodiment, may be formed from a single<br>
semi-hollow piece which attaches to the core portion.<br>
[0039] According to another embodiment of the present invention, the body<br>
portion 11 may be designed to accommodate electrical or electronic components, such as,<br>
for example, pickups, transducers, switches, controls, lights and the like. The electrical<br>
or electronic components may be stand-alone within the body portion or may be<br>
integrated into the body portion 11 in such a way that they interface with one or more<br>
components located on the core portion 18. For example, additional pickups having<br>
unique tonal characteristics may be integrated into the body portion 11 and may interface<br>
to pickup electronics located on or within the core portion 18.<br>
[0040] In addition, the first body section 12a and the second body section 12b<br>
may be formed simply for aesthetic purposes, for looks or appearances, or for<br>
ergonomics. The first body section 12a and the second body section 12b may be formed<br>
in a more traditional manner or may be formed in a manner highly unusual for the<br>
instrument.<br>
[0041] In the embodiment of the present invention shown in Figure 1, the first<br>
body section 12a may include a first channel 14a and the second body section 12b may<br>
include a second channel 14b. The first and second channels 14a, 14b provide, inter alia,<br>
unique resonant characteristics for the first and second body sections 12a, 12b which, in<br>
turn, provide unique vibrating characteristics to the strings (not shown) of the guitar. The<br>
unique vibrating characteristic of the strings can then be sensed by pickups on the guitar,<br>
which can then send a signal representing the unique vibrating characteristics of the<br>
strings to an amplifier to produce an audible sound having unique tonal qualities. In<br>
addition, the first and second channels 14a, 14b provide, inter alia, an. area in which to<br>
place or insert one or more ribs 16 or other resonance enhancing or resonance altering<br><br>
structures. The ribs 16 may transfer vibration within, the first body section 12a and the<br>
second body section 12b in a unique way, thus resulting in unique tonal characteristics<br>
for the instrument. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the first body<br>
section 12a and the second body section 12b may attach to the core portion 18 using<br>
fasteners that extend through the ribs 16.<br>
[0042] According to embodiments of the present invention, the core portion 18<br>
may be formed in a variety of ways. For example, the core portion 18 may be a single<br>
part or may be formed from a plurality of parts joined together. For example, in the<br>
embodiment shown in Figure 1, the core portion 18 is a guitar neck that may be a single<br>
piece carved from wood, a portion of which is surrounded by the first body section 12a<br>
and the second body section 12b. Alternatively, the core portion 18 may be a guitar neck<br>
formed from two or more separate and distinct pieces. For example, the core portion 18<br>
may be a guitar neck and body piece formed from a neck having frets and fret wires and a<br>
body accommodating pickups and other electronics. The core portion 18 may also<br>
include a head stock 20 and tuning pegs 22 at a first end of the core portion and pickups<br>
24 and a bridge 26 at a second end of the core portion.<br>
[0043] Other items peculiar to a particular instrument may also be included with<br>
the core portion 18. For example, if the core portion 18 is a guitar neck and body piece,<br>
the core portion may include tone controls, volume controls, pickup selector switches, a<br>
cord socket, battery compartments, and the like. Also, if the core portion 18 is a guitar<br>
neck and body piece, the guitar neck may include a fretboard and fret wires., a headstock<br>
with tuning machines, and a section for pickups and other electronics.<br>
[0044] An exploded view of a musical instrument having exchangeable<br>
components 10 according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown in Figure<br>

shown in Figure 10 also includes, but is not limited to, controls 60 for adjusting<br>
parameters, such as, for example, tone and volume, and a selector switch 62 for selecting<br>
a pickup 24. In the embodiment shown in Figure 10, the core portion 18 is a single<br>
component. However, according to other embodiments of the invention, the core portion<br>
18 may be a plurality of sections attached together to form one component.<br>
[0052] The core portion 18 shown in the embodiment in Figure 10 may include a<br>
plurality of pickups or, if, according to an embodiment of the present invention, the core<br>
portion 18 is the neck of an acoustic guitar, it may have no pickups. Moreover, all of the<br>
electronics and mechanical components included with the core portion 18 may be<br>
designed to be removably attached to the core portion 18 in a fashion similar to the<br>
removably attachable body portion. Thus, in addition to modifying the timbre or tonal<br>
characteristics of the instrument by exchanging body portions, a musician may also adjust<br>
the timbre or tonal characteristics of the instrument by exchanging electronic<br>
components. In addition, mechanical components such as, for example, the controls 60<br>
and selector switch 62 may be designed to be exchanged onto different portions of the<br>
core portion 18. Thus, for example, if a musician did not like the position placement of<br>
the controls 60 and selector switch 62 on the core portion 18 as shown in Figure 10, the<br><br>
musician could remove the controls 60 and selector switch 62 on the core; portion 18 as<br>
shown in Figure 10 and exchange them for controls and a selector switch that are<br>
beatable in a different position on the core portion 18. The musician could also remove<br>
the controls 60 and selector switch 62 on the core portion 18 and exchange them for<br>
controls and a selector switch that has a feel or look more to the musician's liking, if so<br>
desired.<br>
[0053] An isolated view of a core portion 70 according to another embodiment of<br>
the present invention is shown in Figure 11. In the embodiment shown in Figure 11, the<br>
core portion 70 is a guitar neck. In addition, the core portion 70 shown in the<br>
embodiment of Figure 11 is formed from a first core section 72a and a second core<br>
section 72b. The first core section 72a is removably attached to the second core section<br>
72b by one or more fasteners 74. The fasteners 74 may be any of a variety of fasteners<br>
common in the industry, such as, for example, screws.<br>
[0054] According to the embodiment of the present invention shown in Figure 11,<br>
a musician who is happy with the timbre or tonal characteristics of a particular body<br>
portion but would like to change the timbre or feel of the core portion 70 could exchange<br>
the first core section 72a with another first core section.<br>
[0055] Figure 12 shows a cross-sectional view through a rib 16 of an embodiment<br>
of the present invention shown in Figure 1. In Figure 12, the first body section 12a and<br>
the second body section 12b attach to the core portion 18 through attachment points 30<br>
using fasteners 31. It can readily be seen in Figure 12 that the first body section 12a and<br>
the second body section 12b are "open ended." In addition, in the embodiment of the<br>
invention shown in Figure 12, the first body section 12a and the second body section 12b<br>
are of a thin wall construction, thus rendering the entire body area substantially hollow<br>
except in the area of the ribs 16.<br>
[0056] Figure 13 shows another cross-sectional view adjacent a rib 16 of an<br>
embodiment of the present invention shown in Figure 1. In Figure 13, a portion of the<br>
core has a hollow area 19 that may be used to house electronics or other items desired by<br>
the musician for use of the instrument.<br>
[0057] Referring back to Figure 1, according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the body portion 11 may be made from a variety of materials. For example,<br>
the body portion 11, may be made from wood, metal, plastic, carbon fiber, a composite<br><br>
material and the like. In addition, the body portion 11 may be made from a combination<br>
of materials. For example, various parts of a body portion 11 formed as a single<br>
component may be made from different materials. According to another embodiment of<br>
the present invention, different sections of a body portion may be made from different<br>
materials. For example, the first body section 12a may be made from one material, such<br>
as carbon fiber, and the second body section 12b may be made from another material,<br>
such as a composite.<br>
[0058] In addition, other components of a musical instrument having<br>
exchangeable components 10 may also be made from a variety of materials. For<br>
example, the core portion 18 and the ribs 16 may be made from wood, metal, plastic,<br>
carbon fiber, a composite material and the like, or a combination of materials. According<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention, if the core portion 18 is a guitar neck, the core<br>
portion 18 may be made from woods such as maple, rosewood, ebony or a combination<br>
of these woods.<br>
[0059] A musical instrument having exchangeable components 80 according to<br>
another embodiment of the present invention having a core portion 82 and a body portion<br>
84 is shown in Figure 14. In the embodiment shown in Figure 14, the musical instrument<br>
is a trumpet. The body portion 84 may be removably attached to the core portion 82,<br>
thereby allowing a musician to change the timbre or tonal characteristics of the<br>
instrument simply by exchanging body portion 84 for another body portion 84. In the<br>
embodiment shown in Figure 14, the body portion 84 includes two separate components;<br>
however, according to embodiments of the present invention, the body portion 84 may<br>
include one component, two components or a plurality of components.<br>
[0060] The advantages of embodiments of the present invention may readily be<br>
seen. By having a variety of body portions available, a musician may be able to alter the<br>
timbre or tonal characteristics of an instrument simply by removing one or more body<br>
portions and exchanging them with others. Thus, rather than having an arsenal of<br>
instruments each having a unique timbre or tonal characteristic, a musician may retain<br>
one core portion and a plurality of body portions.<br>
[0061] Embodiments of the present invention provide numerous advantages over<br>
the prior art. For example, guitar players become particularly attached to the feel and<br>
playability of the necks of their guitars, i.e.., the core portion of their guitar. Guitar<br><br>
players typically have a "favorite guitar" that always "feels" good to them, thus<br>
enhancing their playing and providing for an enhanced musical experience. According to<br>
embodiments of the present invention, a guitar player may find a favorite core portion,<br>
i.e., a favorite neck, one that agrees with the guitar player from a feel and playability<br>
standpoint, and retain that core portion and use it with a plurality of body portions. Thus,<br>
a guitar player may change the timbre or tonal characteristics of the guitar without having<br>
to lose that "favorite" guitar feel, simply by retaining the core portion of the guitar but<br>
exchanging body portions.<br>
[0062] Other musicians will find similar advantages with embodiments of the<br>
present invention. For example, woodwind and horn players may become particularly<br>
fond of a particular embouchure, keys or pads. Using embodiments of the present<br>
invention, a woodwind or horn player may retain a core portion, such as, for example, a<br>
main sound chamber having keys and a mouthpiece, and exchange various body portions<br>
that alter the structural characteristics of the sound chamber to change the timbre of the<br>
instrument. Thus, the woodwind or born player may continue to enjoy the feel of the<br>
embouchure, keys or pads, for example, while greatly expanding the tonal characteristics<br>
of the instrument.<br>
[0063] While particular embodiments of the present invention have been shown<br>
and described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited<br>
to the particular embodiments shown and described and that changes and modifications<br>
may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
