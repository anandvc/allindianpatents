				<td>A METHOD FOR TRANSPORTING AND DISTRIBUTING ITEMS<br>
Related Application<br>
This non-provisional application claims priority to<br>
provisional application no. 60/453,748,."filed March 10, 200'3.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates generally to systems and methods for<br>
the efficient transportation of objects from an origination point<br>
to a destination point including,. more particularly, methods and<br>
systems for transporting and distributing large numbers of items,<br>
including for example mail items, from an origination point to a<br>
destination point.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In fiscal year 2000, the United States Postal Service<br>
delivered approximately 208 billion pieces of mail. The average<br>
daily volume of • mail delivered during fiscal year 2000 was 500<br>
million pieces.<br>
At present, the process of delivering the mail is a<br>
relatively complicated one. That process can be broken down into<br>
two components: (a) transportation and (b) distribution. The term<br>
"transportation" as used herein is intended to refer•to the nodes<br><br>
and routes, which define the-'flow of." mail (or other objects)<br>
between plants/processing' facilities (or other, sorting points).<br>
Transportation includes the inter-plant transportation network and<br>
the -plant to delivery unit networks. (A delivery unit is a post<br>
office, station or branch that has mail- delivery functions to the<br>
point of final delivery, for 'a mail ' item.) . It does not include<br>
activity within the plants themselves'.<br>
The term "distribution" .as used' herein refers to the<br>
combination of equipment, processes and plants that sort mail (or<br>
other objects). Distribution generally takes place between the.<br>
point at which originating mail is picked up from its point of.<br>
origin and the point at which it reaches its point of final<br>
• delivery. The distribution of mail is assisted by the use of five<br>
and preferably nine digit ZIP codes, which refer to defined<br>
. geographic areas.<br>
It must also be noted that mail items come in varying shapes.<br>
Examples of current mail shapes include flat-size, letter-size,<br>
parcels, and outsides. Currently, plants process more or less all<br>
shapes of mail. However, because mail-^processing equipment is<br>
generally shape-specific; i.e., can only process one shape of mail<br>
item,- it is inefficient to locate in each plant every type of<br>
-processing equipment.. Nevertheless, currently, transportation of<br>
mail is -organized according to mail class, rather than according<br><br>
to mail shape.<br>
A need continually exists to improve and further optimize the<br>
transportation and distribution process where a large number of<br>
objects must be processed, including particularly in one example a<br>
large number of mail objects; Such improvement should rely/ among<br>
.other things, on the use of shape-based criteria in organizing the<br>
• transportation of mail items (or the like) between plants and<br>
their distribution within plants.	.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
This' invention is concerned with a, system and method for<br>
the efficient distribution and transportation of objects from an<br>
origination point to a destination point.  Preferably, the<br>
^objects pass through at least one intermediate sorting point,<br>
and are there sorted so. as to aid in the efficient<br>
transportation of the objects through the system.  In one<br>
embodiment, the objects are mail pieces'.  However, other,<br>
non-mail objects, could also be transported from an origination<br>
point to a destination point using the system and method of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The system and method of the present invention is intended<br>
. to accommodate the transportation and, in one embodiment, the<br>
distribution, of extremely large numbers of objects.  In one<br>
preferred embodiment, the system and method may be used in the<br>
efficient transportation and distribution of extremely large<br>
■ numbers of mail items. ■<br>
A number of specialized terms shall be used in the<br><br>
description of the system and method of• the present invention.<br>
First, with respect to mail types, the following definitions<br>
apply:<br>
(a)	"Flat" generally refers to flat-size mail.' It may<br>
include mail that is within the dimensions of 15 inches long, 12<br>
inches high, and 3/4'of an inch thick;<br>
(b)	"Letter" generally refers to letter-size mail. It may<br>
include mail that is within the dimensions of 11 and 1/2 inches<br>
long, 6 and 1/8 inches high, and 1/4 inch thick;<br>
.(c) "Parcel" generally refers to mail items that are .<br>
outside the dimensions of Flats and Letters, yet that still fit<br>
within a mail sack or container; and<br>
(d) "Priority" - generally refers to mail items for which<br>
expedited treatment is required.<br>
It should be noted that, with respect to size, the terms<br>
"flat," "letter," and "parcel" are exemplary only.  In essence,<br>
when dealing with a plurality of different-ly-sized items to be<br>
shipped, a "flat" may represent any established first size for<br>
an item to be shipped, a "letter" may represent any established<br>
second size for an item to be shipped, and a "parcel" represents<br>
any established third size for an item to be shipped.  It should<br>
be noted further that there can be any. desired number of<br>
established sizes of items to be shipped, with each established<br><br>
size being defined based on the particular items to be shipped.<br>
The actual sizes for each class can be varied as desired.<br>
In a similar vein, the term- "priority" represents any<br>
established expediting service for the shipment of items to be<br>
shipped, utilizing the method hereof with respect to particular<br>
items to be shipped.  The actual duration of such expediting<br>
.service can be varied as desired.• •       •<br>
It should be noted that other criteria could be utilized to<br>
allocate distribution among facilities of items that are to be<br>
shipped, including for example package color, health and/or<br>
safety considerations, .etc<br>
Other specialized terms used herein include the following:<br>
(a) Origin Facility/Destination Facility ("ODF") - the<br>
initial recipients of mail collection, and from which mail will<br>
be processed for transport-to delivery unit's.  Initial and final<br>
sorting of mail occurs at an ODF for all turnaround mail<br>
(network bound mail receives its initial sort at the ONCP) .  As<br>
shown in Figure 4, ODFs "(represented by an upright triangle)<br>
receive mail from delivery units within designated geographic<br>
areas (represented by circles).  (For purposes .of the United<br>
States Postal Service, the geographic areas are identified<br>
.according to three digit -ZIP CODE areas,' though other means for<br>
identifying particular geographic areas can be utilized.)<br><br>
Preferably, each-geographic area (e.g., each three digit zip<br>
code area) is assigned to only one ODF.  ODFs will.typically<br>
receive mail from more than one three digit zip code:area, but<br>
in some cases it may.receive' may from, only one three digit zip-<br>
code area.  Zip codes are assigned to NCPs based upon least cost<br>
network design while meeting constraints such as the<br>
geographical distance between zips and ODFs, mail volumes<br>
(workload), and available facility capacity.<br>
(b) Network Control Point or "NCP" - The NCP is the<br>
facility that .performs the initial network' sort for originating<br>
mail items after they have been initially received by the 'ODF<br>
where they were mailed, and before they are finally sorted at<br>
the ODF where it will be delivered.  ODFs are assigned to NCPs<br>
based upon least cost network design while meeting constraints<br>
such as the geographical distance between ODFs and NCPs,- mail<br>
volumes (workload) and available facility capacity.  (The ODFs<br>
assigned to a particular NCP can be located in different states,<br>
•counties, etc.) -Figure 5 illustrates the assignment of a<br>
plurality of ODFs to a single NCP (represented by a larger,<br>
inverted triangle).  As shown in Figure 5, preferably, each ODF<br>
is assigned to a single NCP that is not co-located within the<br>
same facility; On the other hand, generally and as shown in<br>
Figure 6, Each NCP (represented by a large triangle) will<br><br>
receive mail from several ODFs (represented by smaller<br>
' triangles), with each NCP maintaining transport connectivity<br>
throughout the -network with other NCP's - though not -with ODFs'<br>
other than those that have been assigned to them.  In some<br>
cases, it may be necessary to'co-locate an NCP and one of its<br>
-assigned ODFs within the same facility-or campus-of facilities.<br>
(c)	Originating Network Control Point, or "ONCP" and •<br>
Destinating Network Control Point, or "DNCP" - These come into<br>
play where an NCP receives mail from an ODF that is destined for,<br>
a different ODF that may or may not be part of the NCP's'service<br>
. area.  In such instance, the first NCP provides the network<br>
piece-sortation for all destinating ODFs consistent with its<br>
role as an Originating NCP, or ONCP.  Where mail is destined for<br>
an ODF that is not part of the ONCP's service area, the mail is<br>
containerized and transported' from the ONCP to 'the NCP assigned<br>
to" the particular ODF where the mail is destined.  In such<br>
instance, the second NCP is the Destinating NCP, or DNCP.<br>
(d)	Intermediate Network Control Point,' or "INCP" - If<br>
there is no direct transport link between the ONCP and the DNCP,<br>
• the mail will be sent to an intermediate NCP, or INCP.' The INCP•<br>
acts as a-transportation hub between the ONCP and the DNCP.-<br>
Every NCP will function as an ONCP and a DNCP depending upon<br>
whether the mail is originating or destinating at one of its<br><br>
ODFs. Additionally, every NCP has the ability to provide INCP<br>
functionality for the purpose of transportation cost short-<br>
cutting.  Such INCP functionality may include build/bulk,- cross-<br>
dock, and/or break-buik operations.<br>
Furthermore/ it is intended that a particular INCP' network<br>
(subset of all- NCPs) will, be defined for the purpose of<br>
providing a higher-level of dropship entry points.- It is<br>
• expected that this INCP subset will lessen the need for sacks as<br>
• a mail- prep resource within the network and will encourage<br>
further workshare opportunities.<br>
(e)	Origin air mail center, or '"OAMC", and destination air<br>
mail center, or DAMC -Where there is no efficient ground<br>
transportation route between an ONCP and a DNCP, either directly<br>
or through an INCP, mail is shipped by air. ■ In this instance,<br>
mail travels from an ONCP to an origin air mail center, or OAMC.<br>
At the OAMC, the mail is placed on air transportation to the<br>
destination AMC, or DAMC.  From the DAMC, the mail is sent to<br>
the DNCP.  Each NCP is assigned to one and only one AMC.  Every<br>
AMC- is both an OAMC and a DAMC, depending-on whether the mail is<br>
originating or destinating at one of its NCP's.<br>
(f)	"Turnaround" - refers to mail items whose origin and<br>
destination are both within a particular ODF's geographic area<br>
(e.g., three digit ZIP CODE area).<br><br>
(g)  "Plant Load"- and "Drop Shipment" - In some instances,<br>
preliminary sorting is conducted-by a private actor, and'<br>
preliminarily sorted mail items may be delivered in large volume<br>
by the private actor into the system.  Typically, a large volume<br>
shipment that is delivered to an originating ODF or an ONCP is<br>
regarded as a plant load. . A large volume shipment that is-<br>
■ delivered to a destination ODF, an INCP, or a DNCP, is regarded<br>
as a drop shipment'.<br>
It should be noted that the terms ODF, NCP and the like, as<br>
used herein, are exemplary only, and that other terms may be<br>
utilized to describe facilities that perform the functions<br>
described herein.<br>
The ODF and the NCP are primarily distinguished by their<br>
location within the network and the different types of<br>
distribution that occurs therein (i.e., initial and final<br>
sorting at the ODF, and intermediate/initial network sorting at<br>
the NCP) .  The ODFs and the NCPs to which they are assigned have<br>
present therein automated processing equipment of a type<br>
suitable, for the processing of items having an established,<br>
physical shape.  For example, all ODFs specialize in the<br>
distribution of both "letters" and "flats," whereas an NCP<br>
specializes in the distribution of "bundles" and "parcels" while<br>
providing a supporting role in the network distribution of<br><br>
"letters" and "flats." In other words, the assignment of ODFs<br>
to :NCPs takes into consideration product "shape," the<br>
.geographical area in which the ODFs and NCPs are located, and<br>
the proximity of ODFs to their respectively assigned NCPs.<br>
•Typically, the predominant "shape" criteria for ODF role<br>
assignments will be Letters and Flats, which represent the.<br>
largest percentage of mail items within a typical mail system.<br>
The predominant shape criteria for NCP role assignments will be<br>
Bundles and Parcels..  Seen in this light, the system described<br>
herein is "shape-based."<br>
• Referring now to Figure 1, one possible path of mail items<br>
. (in this example Letters and Flats) through ODF and NCP<br>
facilities, consistent with the system and method of the present<br>
invention, is shown.  Initially, items enter a particular ODF<br>
(identified as the "OF" in the drawing figure), according to the<br>
originating geographic area (e.g., three digit ZIP code area)<br>
for the item.  The items are then separated as between<br>
turnaround (also referred to as "local") and non-turnaround,<br>
with turnaround mail being origin and destination processed<br>
within the OF.<br>
For Letters and Flats that are turnaround, the'OF will<br>
■.perform origin processing. This will'include, preferably,<br>
cancellation, outgoing primary, incoming primary, incoming<br><br>
secondary and'DPS.' It will also perform all'image lift<br>
resolution.  Non-turnaround Letters and Flats are then<br>
transported from the OF to-an ONCP for the purpose-of receiving -<br>
network distribution to the DF sort level and subsequent<br>
container and transport consolidation-.  The ONCP may also<br>
directly receive Plant Loads.<br>
Some mail items-may go directly from an ONCP ta a<br>
destination ODF or "DF,-" depending on the destinating geographic<br>
area (e.g., three digit ZIP code) for particular items, while<br>
others will continue to a DNCP, before continuing on to a DF.<br>
(As discussed above, in some instances, it may be necessary for<br>
mail items to be transported from an ONCP to an INCP and then on<br>
to a DNCP.  Air shipment between the ONCP and DNCP, through an<br>
. OAMC and a DAMC, may also be necessary.)   As shown in Figure 1,<br>
the DNCP may also receive Drop Shipments.<br>
From the DNCP, Letters and Flats are transported to a DF<br>
for destination processing, where the DF is selected based on<br>
the destination geographic area (e.g., three digit ZIP code) for<br>
the particular mail items.  The DF, like the DNCP, may also<br>
receive Drop Shipments.  As such, non-turnaround Letters and<br>
Flats.receive piece-sortation at. only ONCPs and DFs.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, it can be seen that.the<br>
processing of turnaround Parcels and Priority is the'same as for<br><br>
■ turnaround Letters and Flats-— i.e.,'all origin and destination<br>
processing occurs'in the OF/DF. ' Non-turnaround Parcel and<br>
Priority items will'follow a- similar transportation path as<br>
Letters and Flats, except that piece processing will occur<br>
strictly within NCP facilities having automated processing<br>
equipment for these physical shapes as discussed above.  In<br>
other words and by way. of example, within a particular •<br>
geographic area, it will be preferred to have an ODF for Letters<br>
and Flats, and a corresponding NCP for Parcels and Priority mail<br>
• that contains automated processing equipment for- the<br>
corresponding physical shape.  Since NCPs may be assigned<br>
multiple ODFs, the geographic service area covered by an NCP is<br>
equal to the sum of the service areas covered by its<br>
respectively assigned ODFs.<br>
• Referring now to Figure 3,.another illustration of mail<br>
flow through an embodiment of the system and method described<br>
herein is presented.  Mail items within particular geographic<br>
areas (identified here as 0ZIP1, 0ZIP2 and 0ZIP3) and having a<br>
particular shape are assigned to a single OF. . Turnaround, or<br>
"local" mail, is origin and destination processed at the' OF,<br>
while non-local mail continues to the assigned ONCP.  The OF and<br>
the ONCP can each receive Plant Loads.<br>
The ONCP conducts intermediate processing, and'then<br><br>
. transports the mail items to-a. DNCP for subsequent<br>
transportation to a DF.  Transportation may also occur directly<br>
from the ONCP ,to the DF, or by way of. an INCKP.  The DNCP and DF .<br>
can each receive Drop Shipments.<br>
While, in a preferred embodiment, the' system and method of<br>
the present invention may be utilized for' the transportation and<br>
distribution of mail items, it should be understood that it<br>
could be. used for the transportation and distribution of<br>
non-mail items as well.  In the event of such application,<br>
certain substitutions to the elements of the method and system<br>
of the-present invention will be made, as necessary, to permit<br>
use with non-mail items.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
A METHOD FOR TRANSPORTING AND DISTRIBUTING ITEMS<br>
A need exists to improve and further optimize the transportation and<br>
distribution process where a large number of objects must be processed,<br>
comprising particularly in one example a large number of mail objects. Items to<br>
be distributed and transported are separated into at least two categories, based<br>
on the shape of the items. Distribution and transportation functions are<br>
performed within a system (1) comprising a plurality of Origin Facility/Destination<br>
Facility (2, 8) and Network Control Points (4, 6), with each ODF being assigned<br>
to a single NCP. Each ODF, in turn, is assigned one or more geographic area.<br>
Items arrive at an ODF (2), are distributed and the transported to the assigned<br>
NCP (4) for further distribution, and then transported to a second ODF (8) for<br>
final distribution.<br>
