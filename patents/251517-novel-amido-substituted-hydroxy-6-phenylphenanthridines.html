3.	PREAH1BLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification pAr1icularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
The invention relates to novel N-sulphonylpyrrole derivatives, which are used in the pharmaceutical industry for the production of pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
 Known technical background<br>
Transcriptional regulation in cells is a complex biological process. One basic principle is regulation by posttranslational<br>
modification of histone proteins, nAh1ely histone proteins H2A/B, H3 and H4 forming the octAh1eric histone core complex.<br>
These complex N-terminal modifications at lysine residues by acetylation or methylation and at serine residues by<br>
phosphorylation constitute pAr1 of the so called "histone code" (Strahl &amp; Ellis, Nature 403,41-45, 2000). In a simple model,<br>
acetylation of positively charged lysine residues decreases affinity to negatively charged DNA, which now becomes<br>
accessible for the entry of transcription factors.Histone acetylation and deacetylation is catalysed by histone<br>
acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs are associated with transcriptional repressor<br>
complexes, switching chromatin to a transcriptionally inactive, silent structure (Marks et al. Nature Cancer Rev 1,194-202,<br>
2001). The opposite holds true for HATs which are associated with transcriptional activator complexes. Three different<br>
classes of HDACs have been described so far, nAh1ely class I (HDAC 1-3, 8) with Mr = 42-55 kDa primarily located in the<br>
nucleus and sensitive towards inhibition by Trichostatin A (TSA), class II (HDAC 4-7,9,10) with Mr = 120-130kDa and TSA<br>
sensitivity and class III (Sir2 homologues) which are quite distinct by their NAD* dependency and TSA insensitivity (Ruijter et<br>
al. Biochem.J. 370,737-749,2003; Khochbin et al. Curr Opin Gen Dev 11,162-166,2001; Verdin et al. Trends Gen 19,286-<br>
293, 2003). HDAC 11 with Mr = 39kDa was cloned recently and displayed homology to class I and II fAh1ily members (Gao<br>
et al. J Biol Chem 277,25748-25755,2002). HATs and HDACs exist in large complexes together with transcription factor and<br>
platform proteins in cells (Fischle et al. Mol Cell 9, 45-47, 2002). Surprisingly, only about 2% of all genes are regulated by<br>
histone acetylation (von Lint et al. Gene Expression 5, 245-253, 1996). New studies with SAHA in multiple myeloma cells<br>
showed that these transcriptional changes can be grouped into distinct functional gene classes important for eg regulation of<br>
apoptosis or proliferation (Mitsiades et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci 101, pp540, 2004).Substrates different to histone proteins<br>
exist. For HDACs these include transcription factors like p53 and TFII E / or chaperones like Hsp90 (Johnstone &amp; Licht,<br>
Cancer Cell 4, 13-18, 2003). Therefore the correct nAh1e for HDACs would be lysine-specific protein deacetylases. As a<br>
consequence of these findings, inhibitors of HDACs effect not only chromatin structure and gene transcription but also<br>
protein function and stability by regulating protein acetylation in general. This function of HDACs in protein acetylation might<br>
also be important for understanding of immediate gene repression by treatment with HDIs (von Lint et al. Gene Expression<br>
5, 245-253, 1996). In this regard, proteins involved in oncogenic transformation and malignant cell growth are of pAr1icular<br>
importance.Different publications highlight the importance of histone acetylation for cancer development (reviewed by<br>
KrAh1er et al. Trends Endocrin Maetabol 12, 294-300, 2001; Marks et al. Nature Cancer Rev 1, 194-202, 2001). These<br>
diseases include<br>
 (i)	mutations of the HAT cAH1P response element binding protein (CBP) associated with Rubinstein-Taybi<br>
syndrome, a cancer predisposition (Murata et al. Hum Mol Genet 10,1071-1076,2001),<br>
(ii)	aberrant recruitment of HDAC1 activity by transcription factors in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) by the<br>
PML-retinoic acid receptor a fusion gene (He et al. Nat genet 18,126-135,1998) <br>
(iii)        	aberrant recruitment of HDAC activity by the overexpressed BCL6 protein in non-Hodagkins lymphoma (Dhoradain<br>
et al. Nuceic Acid Res 26,4645-4651,1998) and finally (iv)        aberrant recruitment of HDAC activity by the AH1L-ETO fusion protein in acute myelogenous leukemia (AH1L M2<br>
subtype; Wang et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 95,10860-10865,1998). In this AH1L subtype, the recruitment of<br>
HDAC1 activity causally leads to gene silencing, a differentiation block and oncogenic transformation,<br>
(v)	HDAC1 gene knock-out in mice showed that HDAC1 has a profound function in embryonal stem cell proliferation<br>
by repressing cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21waf1 and p27kip (Lagger et al. Embo J. 21, 2672-2681,2002).<br>
Since p21"af1 is induced by HDIs in many cancer cell lines, HDAC1 might be a crucial component in cancer cell<br>
proliferation as well. Initial siRNA based gene-knock down experiments in HeLa cells support this hypothesis<br>
(Glaser et al. 310,529-536,2003) <br>
(vi)           HDAC2 is overexpressed in colon carcinoma upon constitutive activation of the wnt /U-catenin/TCF signalling<br>
pathay by loss of functional adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC) protein as reported by Zhu et al. recently (Cancer<br>
Cell 5,455-463, 2004) <br>
On the molecular level, a pleithora of published data with various HDAC inhibitors like Trichostatin A (TSA) showed that many cancer relevant genes are up- or down regulated. These include p21cip1, Cyclin E, transforming growth factor ft (TGFft), p53 or the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor genes, which are upregulated, whereas Bcl-XL, bcl2, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)1cc, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cyclin A/D are down-regulated by HDAC inhibition (reviewed by KrAh1er et al. Trends Endocrin Metabol 12,294-300, 2001). HDAC inhibitors arrest cells at G1 and G2/M within the cell cycle and deplete S-phase cells, as shown for Depsipeptide as an exAh1ple (Sandor et al., British J Cancer 83,817-825, 2000). HDAC inhibitory compounds induce p53 and caspase3/8 independent apoptosis and have broad anti-tumor activity. Anti-angiogenic activity was described also, which might be related to down-regulation of VEGF and HIF1a. In summary, HDAC inhibition effects tumor cells at different molecular levels and multiple cellular proteins are targetedilnterestingly, HDAC inhibitors were found to induce cellular differentiation and this pharmacological activity might<br>
2<br><br>
contribute to their anti-cancer activity as well. For exAh1ple it was shown recently that suberoylanilide hydroxAh1ic acid (SAHA) induces differentiation of breast cancer cell lines, exemplified by resynthesis of milk fat membrane globule protein (MFMG), milk fat globule protein and lipid (Munster et al. Cancer Res. 61, 8492, 2001).There is growing rational for synergism of HDAC inhibitors with chemotherapeutic as well as target specific cancer drugs. For exAh1ple, synergism was shown for SAHA with the kinase / cdk inhibitor flavopiridol (Alemenara et al. Leukemia 16,1331-1343, 2002), for LAQ-824 with the bcr-abl kinase inhibitor Glivec in CML cells (Nimmanapalli et al. Cancer Res. 63, 5126-5135, 2003) and for SAHA and Trichostatin A (TSA) with etoposide (VP16), cisplatin and doxorubicin (Kim et al. Cancer Res. 63,7291-7300,2003) and LBH589 with the hsp90 inhibitor 17-allyl-Ah1ino-demethoxy-geldanAh1ycin (17-AAG; George et al. Blood online, Oct.28, 2004). Also it was shown that HDAC inhibition causes reexpression of estrogen or androgen receptors in breast and prostate cancer cells with the potential to resensitize these tumors to anti-hormone therapy (Yang et al. Cancer Res. 60, 6890-6894, 2000; NakayAh1a et al. Lab Invest 80,1789-1796, 2000).HDAC inhibitors from various chemical classes were described in the literature with four most important classes, nAh1ely (i) hydroxAh1ic acid analogs, (ii) benzAh1ide analogs, (iii) cyclic peptides / peptolides and (iv) fatty acid analogs. A comprehensive summary of known HDAC inhibitors was published recently (Miller et al. J Med Chem 46, 5097-5116, 2003). There is only limited data published regarding specificity of these histone deacetylase inhibitiors. In general most hydroxAh1ate based HDI are not specific regarding class I and II HDAC enzymes. For exAh1ple. TSA inhibits HDACs 1, 3,4, 6 and 10 with IC50 values around 20nM, whereas HDAC8 was inhibited with IC50 = 0.49 u.M (TatAh1iya et al, AACR Annual Meeting 2004, Abstract #2451). But there are exceptions like the experimental HDI Tubacin, selective for the class II enzyme HDAC 6 (HaggAr1y et al. Proc natl Acad Sci USA 100,4389-4394, 2003). In addition, data on class I selectivity of benzAh1id HDIs are emerging. MS-275 inhibited class I HDAC1 and 3 with IC50 = 0.51 nM and 1.7nM, respectively. In contrast class II HDACs 4, 6, 8 and 10 were inhibited with IC50 values of &gt;100u.M, &gt;100nM, 82.5|xM and 94.7uJvl, respectively (TatAh1iya et al, AACR Annual Meeting 2004, Abstract #2451). So far it is not clear if specificity towards HDAC class I or II enzymes or a defined single isoenzyme should be superior regarding therapeutic efficacy and index.Clinical studies in cancer with HDAC inhibitors are on-going, nAh1ely with SAHA (Merck Inc.), Valproic acid, FK228 / Depsipeptide (Gloucester Pharmaceuticals / NCI), MS275 (Berlex-Schering), NVP LBH-589 (NovAr1is), PXD-101 (Topotarget / Curagen), MGCD0103 (methylene Inc.) and Pivaloyloxymethylbutyrate / Pivanex (Titan Pharmaceuticals). These studies showed first evidence of clinical efficacy, highlighted recently by pAr1ial and complete responses with FK228 / Depsipeptide in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (Plekarz et al. Blood, 98, 2865-2868, 2001).Recent publications also showed possible medical use of HDAC inhibitors in disease different to cancer. These diseases include systemic lupus erythematosus (Mishra et a. J Clin Invest 111,539-552,2003; Reilly et al. J. Immunol. 173, 4171-4178,2004), rheumatoid Ar1hritis (Chung et al. Mol Therapy 8,707-717, 2003; Nishida et al. Ar1hritis &amp; Rheumatology 50, 3365-3376, 2004), inflAh1matory diseases (Leoni et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 99, 2995-3000, 2002) and neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's disease (Steffan et al. Nature 413, 739-743, 2001, Hockly et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci: USA 100(4):2041-6, 2003).Cancer chemotherapy was established based on the concept that cancer cells with uncontrolled proliferation and a high proportion of cells in mitosis are killed preferentially. Standard cancer chemotherapeutic drugs finally kill cancer cells upon induction of progrAh1med cell death ("apoptosis") by targeting basic cellular processes and molecules, nAh1ely RNA/DNA (alkylating and carbAh1ylating agents, platin analogs and topoisomerase inhibitors), metabolism (drugs of this class are nAh1ed anti-metabolites) as well as the mitotic spindle apparatus (stabilizing and destabilizing tubulin inhibitors). Inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDIs) constitute a new class of anti cancer drugs with differentiation and apoptosis inducing activity. By targeting histone deacetylases, HDIs effect histone (protein) acetylation and chromatin structure, inducing a complex transcriptional reprogrAh1ming, exemplified by reactivation of tumor suppressor genes and repression of oncogenes. Beside effecting acetylation of N-terminal lysine residues in core histone proteins, nonhistone targets important for cancer cell biology like heat-shock-protein 90 (Hsp90) or the p53 tumor suppressor protein exist. The medical use of HDIs might not be restricted to cancer therapy, since efficacy in models for inflAh1matory diseases, rheumatoid Ar1hritis and neurodegeneration was shown. <br>
Prior Ar1<br>
Benzoyl or acetyl substituted pyrrolyl propenAh1ides are described in the public literature as HDAC-inhibitors, whereas the connectivity of the acyl-group is at position 2 or 3 of the pyrrole scaffold. (Mai et.al., Journal Med.Chem. 2004, Vol. 47, No. 5, 1098-1109). Further pyrrolyl substituted hydroxAh1ic acid derivatives are described in US4960787 as lipoxygenase inhibitors or in US6432999 as cyclooxygenase inhibitors.Various compounds, which are said to be HDAC inhibitors, are reported in WO 01/38322; Journal Med. Chem. 2003, Vol. 46, No. 24, 5097-5116; Journal Med. Chem. 2003, Vol. 46, No. 4, 512-524; Journal Med. Chem. 2003, Vol. 46, No. 5, 820-830; and in Current Opinion Drug Discovery 2002, Vol. 5, 487-499.There remains a need in the Ar1 for new, well tolerated and more efficacious inhibitors of HDACs. <br>

Reaction scheme 4:<br><br><br>
Yet alternatively, as shown in reaction scheme 5, compounds of formula XI can be reacted with aldehydes or ketones in an reductive Ah1ination reaction, such as e.g. compounds of formula XI can be reacted with benzaldehyde, or compounds of formulae 1-3C-alkyl-CHO or Har1-CHO, in which HAr1 has the meanings given above, to give in an Ar1-known reductive Ah1ination reaction corresponding compounds of formula Xlll.Compounds of formula XIII can be deprotected to give corresponding compounds of formula le. <br>

Compounds of formula XVI are reacted with boronic acids of formula R'-B(OH)2, in which R' is the terminal aryl or heteroaryl moiety of the abovementioned Aa1 or Ha1 radicals, or the boronic acid esters (e.g. the pinacol esters) thereof, to give in an Ar1-known Suzuki reaction the corresponding CC-coupled compounds, which are deprotected by removal of PG2 or PG3 to give corresponding compounds of formula If. <br>
Reaction scheme 7:<br><br><br>
The Suzuki reaction can be carried out in a manner habitual per se to the skilled person or as described in the following exAh1ples, or analogously or similarly thereto.Compounds of formula XIV can be obtained according to the synthesis route shown in reaction scheme 1 and described above.The abovementioned compounds of formula R'-B(OH)2 are known or can be obtained according to Ar1-known procedures.The reactions mentioned above can be expediently carried out analogously to the methods known to the person skilled in the Ar1 or as described by way of exAh1ple in the following exAh1ples.lt is moreover known to the person skilled in the Ar1 that if there are a number of reactive centers on a Starting or intermediate compound it may be necessary to block one or more reactive centers temporarily by protective groups in order to allow a reaction to proceed specifically at the desired reaction center. A detailed description for the use of a large number of proven protective groups is found, for exAh1ple, in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" by T. Greene and P. Wuts (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1999, 3rd Ed.) or in "Protecting Groups (Thieme Foundations Organic Chemistry Series N Group" by P. Kocienski (Thieme Medical Publishers, 2000).The isolation and purification of the substances according to the invention is carried out in a manner known per se, e.g. by distilling off the solvent in vacuo and recrystallizing the resulting residue from a<br>
16<br><br>
suitable solvent or subjecting it to one of the customary purification methods, such as, for exAh1ple, column chromatography on suitable support material.Optionally, compounds of formula I can be converted into their salts, or, optionally, salts of the compounds of formula I can be converted into the free compounds.Salts are obtained by dissolving the free compound in a suitable solvent (e.g. a ketone, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or methyl isobutyl ketone, an ether, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, such as methylene chloride or chloroform, or a low molecular weight aliphatic alcohol such as ethanol or isopropanol) which contains the desired acid or base, or to which the desired acid or base is then added. The salts are obtained by filtering, reprecipitating, precipitating with a nonsolvent for the addition salt or by evaporating the solvent. Salts obtained can be converted by alkalization or by acidification into the free compounds, which in turn can be converted into salts. In this way, pharmacologically intolerable salts can be converted into pharmacologically tolerable salts.Suitably, the conversions mentioned in this invention can be carried out analogously or similarly to methods which are fAh1iliar per se to the person skilled in the Ar1. The person skilled in the Ar1 knows on the basis of his/her knowledge and on the basis of those synthesis routes, which are shown and described within the description of this invention, how to find other possible synthesis routes for compounds of the formula I. All these other possible synthesis routes are also pAr1 of this invention.Having described the invention in detail, the scope of the present invention is not limited only to those described characteristics or embodiments. As will be apparent to persons skilled in the Ar1, modifications, analogies, variations, derivations, homologisations and adaptations to the described invention can be made on the base of Ar1-known knowledge and/or, pAr1icularly, on the base of the disclosure (e.g. the explicite, implicite or inherent disclosure) of the present invention without depAr1ing from the spirit and scope of this invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims.The following exAh1ples serve to illustrate the invention further without restricting it. Likewise, further compounds of the formula I, whose preparation is not explicitly described, can be prepared in an analogous manner or in a manner fAh1iliar per se to the person skilled in the Ar1 using customary process techniques.Any or all of the compounds which are mentioned as final products in the following exAh1ples as well as their salts are a preferred subject of the present invention.ln the exAh1ples, MS stands for mass spectrum, M for molecular ion, TSP for Thermospray Ionization, ESI for Electrospray Ionization, El for Electron Ionization, h for hours, min for minutes. Other abbreviations used herein have the meanings customary per se to the person skilled in the Ar1. Examples <br>

Commercial utility<br>
The N-sulphonylpyrrole derivatives of formula I or the salts of these compounds have valuable pharmacological properties<br>
by inhibiting histone deacetylase activity and function.Histone deacetylase (HDAC) means an enzyme with an activity<br>
towards the e-acetyl group of lysine residues within a substrate protein. HDAC substrates are histone H2A, H2B, H3 or H4<br>
25<br><br>
proteins and isoforms but substrate proteins different to histones like, but not limited to, heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), tubulin or the tumor suppressor, protein p53 exist. In pAr1icular histone deacetylases catalyse the hydrolysis the e-acetyl group of lysine residues within these substrate proteins, forming the free Ah1ino group of lysine.lnhibition of histone deacetylase by compounds according to this invention means inhibiting the activity and function of one or more HDAC isoenzymes, in pAr1icular isoenzymes selected from the so far known histone deacetylases, nAh1ely HDAC 1, 2, 3 and 8 (class I) and HDAC 4, 5, 6, 7,10 (class II), HDAC 11 as well as the NAD+ dependent class III (Sir2 homologues). In some preferred embodiment this inhibition is at least about 50%, more preferable at least 75% and still more preferable above 90%. Preferably, this inhibition is specific to a specific histone deacetylase class (eg HDAC class I enzymes), a selection of isoenzymes of highest pathophysiological relevance (eg HDAC1, 2, 3 enzymes) or a single isoenzyme (eg the HDAC 1 enzyme). The term histone deacetylase inhibitor is used to identify a compound capable of interacting with a histone deacetylase and inhibiting its activity, in pAr1icular its enzymatic activity. In this context "head group" defines the residues within an histone deacetylase inhibitor responsible for interacting with the active site of the enzyme, eg the Zn 2* ion.The inhibition of histone deacetylases is determined in biochemical assays of various formats and sources of enzymatic activity. HDAC activity is used either derived from nuclear or cellular extracts or by heterologous expression of a defined HDAC isoenzymes in E.coli, insect cells or mAh1malian cells. Since HDAC are active in multiprotein complexes and form homo- and heterodimeres, nuclear extracts derived from human cancer cells, for exAh1ple the human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa, are preferred. These nuclear extracts contain class I and class II enzymes, but are enriched in class 1 enzymes. For expression of recombinant HDAC isoenzymes, mAh1malian expression systems like HEK293 cells are preferred. The HDAC isoenzyme is expressed as a fusion protein with an affinity tag, like the FLAG epitope. By affinity chromatography, the tagged protein is purified alone or in complex with endogenous proteins (eg other HDAC isoenzmyes and coactivators / platform proteins).The biochemical assays are well described and well known to persons skilled in the Ar1. As substrates, histone proteins, peptides derived from histone proteins or other HDAC substrates as well as acetylated lysine mimetics are used. One preferred promiscous HDAC substrate is the tripeptide Ac-NH-GGK(Ac), coupled with the fluorophore 7-Ah1inomethylcoumarin (AH1C).The invention further relates to the use of the compounds according to this invention for inhibiting histone deacetylase activity in cells and tissues, causing hyperacetylation of substrate proteins and as functional consequence for exAh1ple the induction or repression of gene expression, induction of protein degration, cell cycle arrest, induction of differentiation and/or induction of apoptosis.Cellular activity of a histone deacetylase inhibitor means any cellular effect related to histone deacetylase inhibition, in pAr1icular protein hyperacetylation, transcriptional repression and activation, induction of apoptosis, differentiation and / or cytotoxicity.The term "induction of apoptosis" and analogous terms are used to identify a compound which excecutes progrAh1med cell death in cells contacted with that compound. Apoptosis is defined by complex biochemical events within the contacted cell, such as the activation of cystein specific proteinases ("caspases") and the fragmentation of chromatin. Induction of apoptosis in cells contacted with the compound might not necessarily coupled with inhibition of cell proliferation or cell differentiation. Preferably, the inhibition of proliferation, induction of differentiation and/or induction of apoptosis is specific to cells with aberrant cell growth."Cytotoxicity" in general means arresting proliferation and/or inducing apoptotic cell death in vitro in mAh1malian cells, in pAr1icular human cancer cells/Induction of differentiation" is defined as a process of cellular reprogrAh1ming leading to a reversible or irreversible cell cycle arrest in GO and re-expression of a subset of genes typical for a certain specialized normal cell type or tissue (eg re-expression of milk fat proteins and fat in mAh1mary carcinoma cells).Assays for quantification of cell proliferation, apoptosis or differentiation are well known to experts and state of the Ar1. For exAh1ple, metabolic activity which is linked to cellular proliferation is quantified using the AlAh1ar Blue / Resazurin assay (O'Brian et al. Eur j Biochem 267,5421-5426, 2000) and induction of apoptosis is quantified by measurement of chromatin fragmentation with the cell death detection ELISA commercialized by Roche. ExAh1ples for cellular assays for the determination of hyperacetylation of HDAC substrates are given by measuring core histone acetylation using specific antibodies by Western blotting, reporter gene assays using respective responsive promoters or promoter elements (eg the p21 promoter or the sp1 site as responsive element) or finally by image analysis again using acetylation specific antibodies for core histone. proteins.Compounds according to this invention can be commercially applicable due to their HDAC inhibitory, anti-proliferative and/or apoptosis inducing activity, which may be beneficial in the therapy of diseases responsive thereto, such as e.g. any of those diseases mentioned herein.The invention further relates to a method for inhibiting or treating cellular neoplasia by adminstration of an effective Ah1ount of a compound according to this invention to a mAh1mal, in pAr1icular a human in need of such treatment. A "neoplasia" is defined by cells displaying aberrant cell proliferation and/or survival and/or a block in differentiation. The term neoplasia includes "benign neoplasia" which is described by hyperproliferation of cells, incapable of forming an aggressive, metastasizing tumor in-vivo, and, in contrast, "malignant neoplasia" which is described by cells with multiple cellular and biochemical abnormalities, capable of forming a systemic disease, for exAh1ple forming tumor metastasis in distant organs.The N-sulphonylpyrrole derivatives of the present invention are preferably used for the treatment of malignant neoplasia, also described as cancer, characterized by tumor cells finally metastasizing into distinct organs or tissues. ExAh1ples of malignant neoplasia treated with the N-sulphonylpyrrole derivatives of the present invention include solid and haematological tumors. Solid tumors are exemplified by tumors of the breast, bladder, bone, brain, central and peripheral nervus system, colon, endocrine glands (e.g. thyroid and adrenal cortex), esophagus, endometrium, germ cells, head and<br>
26<br><br>
neck, kidney, liver, lung, larynx and hypopharynx, mesothelioma, ovary, pancreas, prostate, rectum, renal, small intestine, soft tissue, testis, stomach, skin, ureter, vagina and vulva. Malignant neoplasia include inherited cancers exemplified by Retinoblastoma and Wilms tumor. In addition, malignant neoplasia include primary tumors in said organs and corresponding secondary tumors in distant organs ("tumor metastases"). Hematological tumors are exemplified by aggressive and indolent forms of leukemia and lymphoma, nAh1ely non-Hodgkins disease, chronic and acute myeloid leukemia (CML / AH1L), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Hodgkins disease, multiple myeloma and T-cell lymphoma. Also included are myelodysplastic syndrome, plasma cell neoplasia, paraneoplastic syndromes, cancers of unknown primary site as well as AIDS related malignancies.Neoplastic cell proliferation might also effect normal cell behaviour and organ function. For exAh1ple the formation of new blood vessels, a process described as neovascularization, is induced by tumors or tumor metastases. N-sulphonylpyrrole derivatives as described herein can be commercially applicable for treatment of pathophysiological relevant processes caused by benign or neoplastic cell proliferation, such as but not limited to neovascularization by unphysiological proliferation of vascular endothelial cells.Drug resistance is of pAr1icular importance for the frequent failure of standard cancer therapeutics. This drug resistance is caused by various cellular and molecular mechanisms like overexpression of drug efflux pumps, mutation within the cellular target protein or fusion proteins formed by chromosomal translocations. The commercial applicability of N-sulphonylpyrrole derivatives according to the present invention is not limited to 1st line treatment of patients. Patients with resistance to cancer chemotherapeutics or target specific anti-cancer drugs can be also Ah1enable for treatment with these compounds for e.g. 2nd or 3ri line treatment cycles. A prominent exAh1ple is given by acute promyelocytic leukemia patients with the PML-RARcc fusion protein, resistant to standard therapy with retinoids. These patients can be resensitized towards retinoids by treatment with HDAC inhibitory drugs like the N-sulphonylpyrrole derivatives according to the present invention.The invention further provides to a method for treating a mAh1mal, in pAr1icular a human, bearing a disease different to cellular neoplasia, sensitive to histone deacetylase inhibitor therapy comprising administering to said mAh1mal a pharmacologically active and therapeutically effective and tolerable Ah1ount of a compound according to this invention.

Biological Investigations<br>
Isolation of HDAC activity from HeLa cell nuclei:HDAC activity was isolated from nuclear HeLa extracts according to a method original described by DignAh1 et al. (Nucl. Acids Res. 11, pp1475,1983). Briefly, nuclei isolated from HeLa cells (CIL SA, Seneffe, Belgium) were resuspended in buffer C (20mM Hepes pH 7.9, 25% v:v glycerol, 0.42M NaCI, 1.5mM MgCfc, 0.2mM EDTA, 0.5mM PefaBloc and 0.5mM DTT) and stirred for 30min on ice. After centrifugation, the supernatant was dialysed against buffer D (40mM Tris HCI pH 7.4,100mM KCI, 0.2mM EDTA, 0.5mM DTT and 25% v:v glycerol) for 5h at 4°C. After dialysis and centrifugation, the supernatant was stored in aliquots at -80°C and used for Western blot analysis as well as the enzymatic assay as described in the following.<br>
Isolation of rHDACI Human HDAC1 fused with the flag epitope is stably expressed in Hek293 cells. After mass cultivation in DMEM with supplements and 2% fetal calf serum, cells are lysed and flag-HDAC1 purified by M2-agarose affinity chromatography as described (Sigma Ar1. No. A-2220). Fractions from the purification are analysed by Western blot as well as for enzymatic activity as described below.<br>
Fluorimetric HDAC activity assay:The HDAC enzyme activity assay was done as described by Wegener et al. (Chem. &amp; Biol. 10, 61-68, 2003). Briefly 40|jl of a 1:100 dilution ( = 0.4uJ) nuclear HeLa extract (mixture of class I and II HDACs), 29 uJ enzyme buffer (15mM Tris HCI pH 8.1,0.25mM EDTA, 250mM NaCI, 10% v:v glycerol) and 1uJ test compound were added to a well of a 96well microtiter plate and reaction stAr1ed by addition of 30|ul substrate (Ac-NH-GGK(Ac)-AH1C; final concentration 25|Jv1 and final volume 100(oJ). After incubation for 90min at 30°C, reaction was terminated by the addition of 25uJ stop solution (50mM Tris HCI pH 8, 100mM NaCI, 0.5mg/ml trypsine and 2yM TSA). After incubation at room temperature for further 40min, fluorescence was measured using a Wallac Victor 1420 multilabel counter (Ex 355nm, Em 460nm) for quantification of AH1C (7-Ah1ino-4-methylcoumarin) generated by trypsine cleavage of the deacetylated peptide. For the calculation of ICso values the fluorescence in wells without test compound (1% DMSO, negative control was set as 100% enzymatic activity and the fluorescence in wells with 2u.M TSA (positive control) were set at 0% enzymatic activity. The corresponding IC50 values of the compounds for HDAC inhibitory activity were determined from the concentration-effect curves by means of non-linear regression.The HDAC inhibitory activity expressed by ICso values for selected compounds according to the present invention is shown in the following table 1, in which the numbers of the compounds correspond to the numbers of the exAh1ples.<br>

The HDAC1 enzymatic assay is done with slight modifications with recombinant flag-HDAC1 protein isolated from HEK293 cell lysates. About 14ng/well flag-HDAC1 are incubated with 6^M Ac-NH-GGK(Ac)-AH1C substrate for 3h at 30°C. Termination of the reaction and all further steps are done as described for HeLa cell nuclear extracts as a source for HDAC enzymatic activity.Recombinant human HDAC1 expressed in Hek293 cells is inhibited by ExAh1ples 4,5,8 to 11,25 and 28 with an IC50 &gt; 0.95 nM.<br>

Cellular Histone H3 hyperacetylation assay: To assess the cellular efficacy of an histone deacetylase inhibitor in vitro, an assay was set up in black clear-bottom 96-well plates and optimized for use on the Cellomics "ArrayScan II" platform for a quantitative calculation of histone acetylation. The protocol uses a polyclonal rabbit antibody, specifically binding to acetylated lysine 23 of human histone H3 on fixed cells with an Alexa Fluor 488 labeled goat anti rabbit-IgG used for counterstaining (Braunger et al. AACR annual conference 2003, Abstract 4556).5x103 HeLa cervical carcinoma cells/well (ATCC CCL-2) in 200JUI Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum were seeded at day 1 in Packard view plates and incubated for 24h under standard cell culture conditions. On day 2, 2|jl test compound (100x final concentration) was added and incubation continued for further 24h. On day 3, the culture medium was discarded and attached cells fixed for 15min at room temperature by addition of 100uJ fixation buffer (3.7% v:v formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline / PBS). After discarding the fixation buffer and one wash with PBS, cells were permeabilized at room temperature by addition of 100uJ/well permeabilization buffer (30,8 mM NaCI, 0,54 mM Na2HP04,0,31 mM KH2PO4,5% v:v Triton X-100) for 15min at room temperature. After discarding the permeabilization buffer and addition of 100uJ/well blocking solution (PBS with 0.05% v:v Tween 20 and 5% w:v milk powder) for 30min at room temperature, the 1st antibody (anti-K23 histone H3 antibody, Cell Signaling No. 9674) in blocking solution (50uJ/well) was added. After incubation for 1h at 37°C, the wells were washed 5 times for 5min at room temperature with wash buffer (PBS with 0.05% v:v Tween 20) before additon of the 2nd antibody (goat-anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488; MoBiTec No. A-11008) in blocking solution (50^1/ well). After further incubation for 30min at 37°C, wells were washed 5 times for 5min at RT with 100uJ wash buffer at room temperature. Finally, 100uJ/well PBS were added and image analysis performed on the Cellomics "ArrayScan II" platform. For calculation of EC50 values, the nuclear fluorescence in cells treated with and without a reference HDAC inhibitor like SAHA or NVP-LBH-589 were taken as a positive and negative control, respectively. For EC50 determination, the percentage of positive cells was determined and EC50 calculation done from concentration-effect curves by means of non-linear regression.The histone hyperacetylating cellular potency expressed by EC50 values for selected compounds according to the present invention is shown in the following table 2, in which the numbers of the compounds correspond to the numbers of the exAh1ples. <br>

Cellular cytotoxicity assay: The anti-proliferative activity of the histone deacetylase inhibitory compounds as described herein, was evaluated with the HeLa cervical carcinoma cell line (ATCC CCL2) using the AlAh1ar Blue (Resazurin) cell viability assay (O'Brien et al. Eur J Biochem 267, 5421-5426, 2000). Resazurin is reduced to the fluorescent resorufin by cellular dehydrogenase activity, correlating with viable, proliferating cells. Test compounds were dissolved as 10 mM solutions in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and subsequently diluted in semi-logarithmic steps. HeLa cells were seeded into 96 well flat bottom plates at a density of 3000 cells per well in a volume of 200 yl per well. 24 hours after seeding 1 \i\ each of the compound dilutions were added into each well of the 96 Well plate. Each compound dilution was tested as quadruplicates. Wells containing untreated control cells were filled with 200 \J\ DMEM medium containing 0.5% v:v DMSO. The cells were then incubated with the substances for 48 hours at 37°C in a humidified athmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide. To determine the viability of the cells, 20 pi of an Resazurin solution (Sigma; 90mg /1) were added. After 4 hours incubation at 37°C the fluorescence was measured at an extinction of 544 nm and an emission of 590 nm. For the calculation of the cell viability the emission value from untreated cells was set as 100% viability and the emission rates of treated cells were set in relation to the values of untreated cells. Viabilities were expressed as % values. The corresponding ICso values of the compounds for cytotoxic activity are determined from the concentration-effect curves by means of nonlinear regression.The anti-proliferative / cytotoxic potency expressed by IC50 values for selected compounds according to the present invention is shown in the following table 3, in which the numbers of the compounds correspond to the numbers of the exAh1ples.<br>

Apoptosis induction<br>
The induction of apoptosis is measured by using the cell death detection ELISA (Ar1. No. 1774425, Roche Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). A549 NSCLC cells are seeded into 96 well flat bottom plates at a density of 3x10 E3 cells/well in a total volume of 10Opl/well. 24 hours after seeding, 1 pi each of the compound dilutions in DMEM are added in a total volume of 100|jl into each well Final volume 200|jl/well). Each compound dilution is tested at least as triplicates. Wells containing untreated control cells are filled with 200|jl DMEM containing 0.5 vol% DMSO. The cells are incubated with test compound for 48 hours at 37°C in a humidified athmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide. As a positive control for the induction of apoptosis, cells are treated with 50(jM Cispiatin (Gry Pharmaceuticals, KirchzAr1en, Germany). Medium is then removed and the cells lysed in 200 \i\ lysis buffer. After centrifugation as described by the manufacturer, 10 pi of cell lysate is processed as described in the protocol. The degree of apoptosis is calculated as follows: The absorbance at 405 nm obtained with lysates from cells treated with 50|jM cispiatin is set as 100 cpu (cispiatin units), while an absorbance at 405 nm of 0.0 is set as 0.0 cpu. The degree of apoptosis is expressed as cpu in relation to the value of 100 cpu reached with the lysates obtained from cells treated with 50pM cisplatin.The compounds according to this invention tested in the assays above are expected to have an apoptosis inducing effect when tested in this assay.<br>
