				<td>The invention relates to a device for securing an add-on and a support in spaced-apart relation.<br>
Such a device is known from US 6,357,953 Bl. The device of the type in question for securing an add-on and a support in spaced-apart relation is provided with a mounting nut that is fixedly connectable to the support and has an internal thread of a first thread direction, and is configured with a compensating bush having an external thread mating with the internal thread of the mounting nut. The compensating bush is able to be screwed into the mounting nut. Also present is a securing screw that is operative to connect the add-on to the compensating bush and possesses a strew shank made of a hard material, said screw shank being configured with an external thread of a second thread direction opposite to the first thread direction and being insertable in a screw channel made to extend through the mounting nut and into the compensating bush. The compensating bush is made of a soft material compared to the screw shank, and has a channel section that forms part of the screw channel and whose inner diameter is smaller than the outer diameter of the screw shank, such that an internal thread can be formed in the channel section of the compensating bush by means of the external thread of the screw shank of the securing screw.<br>
Known from DE 201 19 112 Ul is a device provided with a mounting nut that is fixedly connectable to a support. The mounting nut is configured, in a first section, with an internal thread of a first thread direction, and, in a second section, with a second internal thread of a second thread direction opposite to the first thread direction. The device of the type in question further comprises a compensating bush, which is provided with the first thread direction by an external thread configured as complementary to the first internal thread of the mounting nut, such that the compensating bush can be screwed into the first internal thread of the mounting nut. The compensating bush is configured with a drive means at its end pointing away from the mounting nut, to cause the compensating bush to protrude past the mounting nut by a set length in the axial direction. Finally, to secure an add-on to the compensating bush, there is a securing screw that can be screwed through a screw channel of the compensating bush engagingly into the second internal thread of the<br><br>
mounting nut by means of a screw shank provided with an external thread of the second thread direction and configured as complementary to the second internal thread of the mounting nut. Although, this device does enable a support and an add-on to be connected to each other with a given mutual spacing, for example one that effects tolerance compensation, its handling and in particular the need to unscrew the compensating bush in a separate step have proven somewhat laborious in certain applications.<br>
The object underlying the invention is to specify a device of the initially cited kind that is distinguished by a bush body stably accommodated in the mounting nut.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention, in a device of the initially cited kind, by means of the compensating bush is made of a plastic, and in that said mounting nut is configured with a collar that projects from its channel section axially into the region of its internal thread and which, in the screwed-together arrangement of said mounting nut and said compensating bush, is in engagement with a collar recess complementarity configured in said compensating bush.<br>
By virtue of the engagement of the collar configured on the mounting nut and the collar recess configured on the compensating bush, an appreciable stabilizing effect is achieved with the inventive device.<br>
The invention relates to a device for securing an add-on and a support in spaced-apart relation.<br>
Such a device is known from DE 201 19 112 Ul. The device of the type in question is provided with a mounting nut that is fixedly connectable to a support. The mounting nut is configured, in a first section, with an internal thread of a first thread direction, and, in a second section, with a second internal thread of a second thread direction opposite to the first  thread  direction.   The   device  of the  type   in  question  further  comprises  a<br><br><br>
compensating bush, which is provided with the first thread direction by an external thread configured as complementary to the first internal thread of the mounting nut, such that the compensating hush can be screwed into the first internal thread of the mounting nut. The compensating bush is configured with a drive means at its end pointing away from the mounting nut, to cause the compensating bush to protrude past the mounting nut by a set length in the axial direction. Finally, to secure an add-on to the compensating bush, there is a securing screw that can be screwed through a screw channel of the compensating bush engagingly into the second internal thread of the mounting nut by means of a screw shank provided with an external thread of the second thread direction and configured as complementary to the second internal thread of the mounting nut.<br>
Although the device of the type in question does enable a support and an add-on to be connected to each other with a given mutual spacing, for example one that effects tolerance compensation, its handling and in particular the need to unscrew the compensating bush in a separate step have proven somewhat laborious in certain applications.<br>
The object underlying the invention is to specify a device of the initially cited kind that is distinguished by particularly simple handling.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention, in a device of the initially cited kind, by means of the compensating bush is made of a plastic, and in that said mounting nut is configured with a collar that projects from its channel section axially into the region of its internal thread and which, in the screwed-together arrangement of said mounting nut and said compensating bush, is in engagement with a collar recess complementarily configured in said compensating bush..<br>
By virtue of the fact that in the inventive device, the mounting nut and the compensating bush are made of plastic and the screw channel is configured with channel sections whose inner diameter is smaller than the outer diameter of the screw shank, when the securing screw is tightened the compensating bush initially rotates automatically out of the<br><br><br>
mounting nut, forming an internal thread in the channel section configured in the compensating bush, until the end of the compensating bush pointing away from the mounting nut butts against the add-on and blocks further axial movement of the compensating bush. As the securing process continues, the screw shank of the securing screw passes out of the first channel section and comes into engagement with the second channel section, configured in the mounting nut, such that the add-on is henceforth disposed at a fixed distance from the support and is fixedly mounted thereon.<br>
Further suitable configurations and advantages will emerge from the following description of an exemplary embodiment of the invention, taken with reference to the figures of the drawing. Therein:<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective representation of a mounting nut and a compensating bush protruding beyond the mounting nut in an exemplary embodiment of a device according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 2 is a longitudinal section of the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 1 in a preassembled position, in which the compensating bush is screwed all the way into the mounting nut and a securing screw is poised in the compensating bush, and<br>
Fig. 3 is a longitudinal section of the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 in a final assembled position, in which the securing screw is screwed into both the compensating bush and the mounting nut.<br>
Figure I is a perspective representation of an exemplary embodiment of a device according to the invention, comprising a mounting nut I with a substantially cylindrical, plastic nut body 2. Configured on the outside of nut body 2 are a number of radially outwardly projecting bearing protrusions 4, which are disposed opposite each other in pairs on both sides of clearances 3.<br>
Further depicted in Fig. 1 is a compensating bush 5, which projects beyond mounting nut 1 and which is configured with an also substantially cylindrical, plastic bush body 6 and a bearing plate 7 formed onto one end of the hush body 6 and projecting radially beyond said bush body 6. Configured on the outside of bush body 6 is an external thread 8 having a first thread direction.<br>
Figure 2 is a longitudinal section of the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. I in a preassembled position, in which the compensating bush 5 is screwed by its external thread 8 all the way into an internal thread 9 of mounting nut 1 that is configured on the inside of nut body 2 with the first thread direction and complementarily to the external thread 8 of bush body 6.<br>
It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the device is configured with a screw channel 10, which extends axiaiSy through the bush body 6 of compensating bush 5, and which, in its region facing bearing plate 7, comprises a lead-in section 11 tapered in a funnel shape and pointing away from bearing plate 2, and, adjacent said lead-in section 11, a cylindrical, smooth-waited, first channel section<br>
12.<br>
It can further be appreciated from Fig. 2 that, in prolongation of first channel section 12, screw channel 10 is extended into mounting nut 3 by a second channel section I 3, which is configured in the nut body 2 and which for ease of production is also cylindrical and smooth-walled in this exemplary embodiment, and is therefore open at both ends in the exemplary embodiment shown.<br>
Finally, it can be appreciated from Fig. 2 that the inventive device comprises a securing screw 14 with a screw shank 15 and a screw head 16, the screw shank 15 being configured with an external thread 17 having a second thread direction opposite to the first thread direction of the thread arrangement configured between mounting nut 1 and compensating bush 5. The securing<br>
screw 14 is made of a harder material than mounting nut 1 and compensating bush 5, for example a metal. The outer diameter of the screw shank 15 of securing screw 14 is larger than the inner diameter of both first channel section 12 and second channel section 13. In the arrangement illustrated in Fig. 2, the screw shank 15 of securing screw 14 is poised to enter first channel section 12.<br>
In the illustrated and described exemplary embodiment of a device according to the invention, configured in the nut body 2 is a collar 18 that extends axially away from second channel section 13 and which in the arrangement of Pig. 2 engages stabilizingly in a complementary collar recess 1 9 configured in bush body 6.<br>
In the preassembied position of the inventive device, as illustrated in Fig. 2, the mounting nut I is inserted by its nut body 2 in a recess of a support 20, the rim of which recess engages in the clearances 3 configured between bearing protrusions 4, The rotationally fixed connection between mounting nut 1 and support 20 is  preferably created by force-locking and/or form-lucking.<br>
In the preassembted position shown in Fig. 2, securing screw 14 is guided through a recess provided in an add-on 21 that is to be spucedly connected to the support 20, screw head 16 being disposed at a distance from add-on 21.<br>
Ai the beginning of the securing proces;;, securing screw 14 is rotated in the second thread direction of external thread 17, thereby forming an internal thread in first channel section 12. As soon as the resistance to ihe formation of the internal thread in first channel section 12 is greater than the frictional resistance between the external thread 8 of compensating bush 5 and the internal thread 9 of mounting nut 1. compensating bush 5 automatically rotates out of mounting nut 1 until bearing plate 7 butts against the side of add-on 21 facing away from support 20 and further axial movement of compensating bush 5 is prevented. The process of forming an internal thread in first channel section 12 then continues.<br>
Figure 3 is a longitudinal section of the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 in a final assembled position, in which securing screw 14 is screwed into both the first channel section 12, configured in compensating bush 5, and the second channel section 13, configured in mounting nut 1, also thereby forming an additional internal thread. In the final assembled position, collar 18 is still stabilizingly engaged with collar recess 19. This secures compensating bush 5 against rotation, and add-on-part 21 is disposed at a fixed distance from the support 20 and is connected thereto.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
