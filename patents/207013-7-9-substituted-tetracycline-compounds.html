7,9-SUBSTITUTED TETRACYCLINE COMPOUNDS<br>
Related Applications<br>
This application claims priority U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/275,620, entitled "7, 9-Substituted Tetracycline Compounds," filed on March 13, 2001.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The development of the tetracycline antibiotics was the direct result of a systematic screening of soil specimens collected from many parts of the world for evidence of microorganisms capable of producing bacteriocidal and/or bacteriostatic compositions. The first of these novel compounds was introduced in 1948 under the name chlortetracycline. Two years later, oxytetracycline became available. The elucidation of the chemical structure of these compounds confirmed their similarity and furnished the analytical basis for the production of a third member of this group in 1952, tetracycline. A new family of tetracycline compounds, without the ring-attached methyl group present in earlier tetracyclines, was prepared in 1957 and became publicly available in 1967; and minocycline was in use by 1972.<br>
Recently, research efforts have focused on developing new tetracycline antibiotic compositions effective under varying therapeutic conditions and routes of administration. New tetracycline analogues have also been investigated which may prove to be equal to or more effective than the originally introduced tetracycline compounds. Examples include U.S. Patent Nos. 2,980,584; 2,990,331; 3,062,717; 3,165,531; 3,454,697; 3,557,280; 3,674,859; 3,957,980; 4,018,889; 4,024,272; and 4,126,680. These patents are representative of the range of pharmaceutical^ active tetracycline and tetracycline analogue compositions.<br>
Historically, soon after their initial development and introduction, the tetracyclines were found to be highly effective pharmacologically against rickettsiae; a number of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria; and the agents responsible for lymphogranuloma venereum, inclusion conjunctivitis, and psittacosis. Hence, tetracyclines became known as "broad spectrum" antibiotics. With the subsequent establishment of their in vitro antimicrobial activity, effectiveness in experimental infections, and pharmacological properties, the tetracyclines as a class rapidly became widely used for therapeutic purposes. However, this widespread use of tetracyclines for both major and minor illnesses and diseases led directly to the emergence of resistance to these antibiotics even among highly susceptible bacterial species both commensal and<br><br>
pathogenic (e.g., pneumococci and Salmonella). The rise of tetracycline-resistant organisms has resulted in a general decline in use of tetracyclines and tetracycline analogue compositions as antibiotics of choice.<br>

Examples of 7,9-substituted tetracycline compounds of the invention include those listed below and in Table 2:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The invention also pertains to each of the 7,9-substituted tetracycline compounds shown in Table 2, as well as their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts.<br>
The 7,9-disubstituted tetracycline compounds of this invention can be synthesized using the methods described in Schemes 1-5.<br>
Certain 7,9-substituted tetracycline compounds can be synthesized by the method shown in Scheme 1. Although in each scheme sancycline is used as the tetracycline compound, one of skill in the art will appreciate that the methodology can also be applied to other tetracycline compounds such as tetracycline and doxycycline. Furthermore, some of the following methods are shown for seven substituted compounds. Similar protocols can be followed to substituted the compounds at the 9 position.<br><br>
.c	ID<br>
SCHEME 1<br>
Generally, 7,9-substituted tetracycline compounds can be synthesized as shown in Scheme 1 for sancycline. Sancycline (1 A) is treated with sulfuric acid and sodium nitrate. The resulting product is 7,9-nitro (IB) sancycline. The nitro sancycline compound is then treated with hydrogen gas and a platinum catalyst to yield the 7,9-amino sancycline compound, 1C. To synthesize derivatives, the 7,9-amino sancycline compound is. treated with HONO, to yield the diazonium salt (ID). The salt can subsequently be treated with numerous compounds possessing an alkene or n bond<br><br>
functional group such as alkenes, aryls, and alkynyls (e.g., RBr) yielding the 7,9-substituted sancycline compound (IE).<br><br>
SCHEME 2<br>
As shown in Scheme 2, tetracycline compounds of the invention wherein R7 is a carbamate or a urea derivative can be synthesized using the following protocol. Sancycline (2A) is treated with NaNC&gt;2 under acidic conditions forming 7-nitro sancycline (2B) in a mixture of 9-positional isomers. 7-nitrosancycline (2B) is then treated with H2 gas and a platinum catalyst to form the 7-amino sancycline derivative (2C). To form the urea derivative (2E), isocyanate (2D) is reacted with the 7-amino sancycline derivative (2C). To form the carbamate (2G), the appropriate acid chloride ester (2F) is reacted with 2C.<br>
R<br>
I R	R<br><br>
7- and 9-alkynyl sancyclines (3A and 3D, respectively) and 7- and 9-alkenyl sancyclines (3B and 3E), can be hydrogenated to form 7- and 9- alkyl substituted sancycline compounds (3C and 3F). Scheme 4 depicts the selective hydrogenation of a 7- and 9- position double and triple bond, in saturated methanol and hydrochloric acid solution. The reaction is catalyzed with a palladium/carbon under pressure, to yield the product. This reaction can also be done simultaneously at both the 7 and 9 positions to yield a dialkyl tetracycline compound.<br>
bita.<br><br>
In Scheme 4, a general synthetic scheme for synthesizing 7-position aryl derivatives is shown. A Suzuki coupling of an aryl boronic acid with an iodosancycline compound is shown. An iodo sancycline compound (4B) can be synthesized from sancycline by treating sancycline (4A) with at least one equivalent N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) under acidic conditions. The reaction is quenched, and the resulting 7-iodo sancycline (4B) can then be purified using standard techniques known in the art. To form the aryl derivative, 7-iodo sancycline (4B) is treated with boronic acid (4C) plus aqueous sodium carbonate, and the reaction is catalyzed with palladium. The product (4D) can be purified by methods known in the art (such as HPLC). Other 7-aryl and alkynyl tetracycline compounds can be synthesized using similar protocols.<br>
The 7,9-substituted tetracycline compounds of the invention can also be synthesized using Stille cross couplings. Stille cross couplings can be performed using an appropriate tin reagent (e.g., R-SnBu3) and a halogenated tetracycline compound, (e.g., 7-iodosancycline). The tin reagent and the iodosancycline compound can be treated with a palladium catalyst (e.g., Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 or Pd(AsPh3)2Cl2) and, optionally,<br><br>
with an additional copper salt, e.g., Cul. The resulting compound can then be purified using techniques known in the art.<br><br>
SCHEME 5<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be synthesized using Heck-type cross coupling reactions.

The resulting 7-substituted alkenyl (5C) or 7-substituted alkynyl (5E) tetracycline compound can then be purified using techniques known in the art.<br>
Other substituted tetracycline compounds of the invention can be synthesized by using one or more of the following synthetic methods at either the 7- or 9- position, followed by the same or different chemistry at the other position. For example, if a group was placed at the 7-position, any of the above reaction methods could be used to further derivatize the 9- position, as shown in Example 1.<br>

The language "tetracycline compound responsive state" includes states which can be treated, prevented, or otherwise ameliorated by the administration of a tetracycline compound of the invention. Tetracycline compound responsive states include bacterial infections (including those which are resistant to other tetracycline compounds), cancer, diabetes, and other states for which tetracycline compounds have been found to be active (see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,789,395; 5,834,450; and 5,532,227).

In addition, methods for treating neoplasms using tetracycline compounds of the invention are also included (van der Bozert et al., Cancer Res., 48:6686-6690 (1988)).<br>
Bacterial infections may be caused by a wide variety of gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The compounds of the invention are useful as antibiotics against organisms which are resistant to other tetracycline compounds. The antibiotic activity of the tetracycline compounds of the invention may be determined using the method discussed in Example 2, or by using the in vitro standard broth dilution method described in Waitz, J.A., National Commission for Clinical Laboratory Standards, Document M7-A2, vol. 10, no. 8, pp. 13-20,2nd edition, Villanova, PA (1990).<br>

compounds may be used to treat infections of, e.g., K. pneumoniae, Salmonella, E. hirae, A. baumanii, B. catarrhalis, H, influenzae, P. aeruginosa, E.faecium, E. coli, S. aureus or E. faecalis. In one embodiment, the tetracycline compound is used to treat a bacterial infection that is resistant to other tetracycline antibiotic compounds. The tetracycline compound of the invention may be administered with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The language "effective amount" of the compound is that amount necessary or sufficient to treat or prevent a tetracycline compound responsive state. The effective amount can vary depending on such factors as the size and weight of the subject, the type of illness, or the particular tetracycline compound. For example, the choice of the tetracycline compound can affect what constitutes an "effective amount". One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to study the aforementioned factors and make the determination regarding the effective amount of the tetracycline compound without undue experimentation.<br>
The invention also pertains to methods of treatment against microorganism infections and associated diseases. The methods include administration of an effective amount of one or more tetracycline compounds to a subject. The subject can be either a plant or, advantageously, an animal, e.g., a mammal, e.g., a human.<br>
In the therapeutic methods of the invention, one or more tetracycline compounds of the invention may be administered alone to a subject, or more typically a compound of the invention will be administered as part of a pharmaceutical composition in mixture with conventional excipient, i.e., pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic carrier substances suitable for parenteral, oral or other desired administration and which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds and are not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
The invention also pertains to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a tetracycline compound (e.g., a compound of Formula 1, Table 2, or other compound described herein) and, optionally, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The language "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes substances capable of being coadministered with the tetracycline compound(s), and which allow both to perform their intended function, e.g., treat or prevent a tetracycline responsive state. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include but are not limited to water, salt solutions, alcohol, vegetable oils, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, perfume oil, fatty acid monoglycerides and diglycerides, petroethral fatty acid esters, hydroxymethyl-cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, etc. The pharmaceutical preparations can be sterilized and if<br><br>
desired mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g., lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, colorings, flavorings and/or aromatic substances and the like which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds of the invention.<br>

The acids that may be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the tetracycline compounds of the invention that are basic in nature are those that form nontoxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts containing pharmaceutically acceptable anions, such<br>
)    as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, acetate, lactate, salicylate, citrate, acid citrate, tartrate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fiimarate, gluconate, glucaronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and palmoate [i.e., 1,1'-<br>
i    methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)] salts. Although such salts must be<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to a subject, e.g., a mammal, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate a tetracycline compound of the invention from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent and subsequently convert the latter free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is readily obtained. The preparation of other tetracycline compounds of the invention not specifically described in the foregoing experimental section can be accomplished using combinations of the reactions described above that will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>

The pharmaceutical^ acceptable base addition salts of tetracycline compounds of the invention that are acidic in nature may be formed with pharmaceutical^ acceptable cations by conventional methods. Thus, these salts may be readily prepared by treating the tetracycline compound of the invention with an aqueous solution of the desired pharmaceutical^ acceptable cation and evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Alternatively, a lower alkyl alcohol solution of the tetracycline compound of the invention may be mixed with an alkoxide of the desired metal and the solution subsequently evaporated to dryness.<br>
The preparation of other tetracycline compounds of the invention not specifically described in the foregoing experimental section can be accomplished using combinations of the reactions described above that will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
The tetracycline compounds of the invention and pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof can be administered via either the oral, parenteral or topical routes. In general, these compounds are most desirably administered in effective dosages, depending upon the weight and condition of the subject being treated and the particular route of administration chosen. Variations may occur depending upon the species of the subject being treated and its individual response to said medicament, as well as on the type of pharmaceutical formulation chosen and the time period and interval at which such administration is carried out.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with other known compositions for treating tetracycline responsive states in a subject, e.g., a mammal. Preferred mammals include pets (e.g., cats, dogs, ferrets, etc.), farm animals (cows, sheep, pigs, horses, goats, etc.), lab animals (rats, mice, monkeys, etc.), and primates (chimpanzees, humans, gorillas).

Any of the therapeutically composition known in the art for treating tetracycline responsive states can be used in the methods of the invention.<br><br>
The tetracycline compounds of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with pharmaceutical^ acceptable carriers or diluents by any of the routes previously mentioned, and the administration may be carried out in single or multiple doses. For example, the novel therapeutic agents of this invention can be administered advantageously in a wide variety of different dosage forms, i.e., they may be combined with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, hard candies, powders, sprays, creams, salves, suppositories, jellies, gels, pastes, lotions, ointments, aqueous suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs, syrups, and the like. Such carriers include solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous media and various non-toxic organic solvents, etc. Moreover, oral pharmaceutical compositions can be suitably sweetened and/or flavored. In general, the therapeutically-effective compounds of this invention are present in such dosage forms at concentration levels ranging from about 5.0% to about 70% by weight.<br>
For oral administration, tablets containing various excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate and glycine may be employed along with various disintegrants such as starch (and preferably corn, potato or tapioca starch), alginic acid and certain complex silicates, together with granulation binders like polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia.

Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin capsules; preferred materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the active ingredient may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes, and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or suspending agents as well, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various like combinations thereof.<br>
For parenteral administration (including intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intradermal or intramuscular injection), solutions of a therapeutic compound of the present invention in either sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol may be employed. The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered (preferably pH greater than 8) if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic. These aqueous solutions are suitable for intravenous injection purposes. The oily solutions are suitable for intraarticular, intramuscular and subcutaneous injection purposes. The preparation of all these solutions under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art. For parenteral application, examples of suitable preparations include solutions,<br><br>
preferably oily or aqueous solutions as well as suspensions, emulsions, or implants, including suppositories. Therapeutic compounds may be formulated in sterile form in multiple or single dose formats such as being dispersed in a fluid carrier such as sterile physiological saline or 5% saline dextrose solutions commonly used with injectables.<br>
Additionally, it is also possible to administer the compounds of the present invention topically when treating inflammatory conditions of the skin. Examples of methods of topical administration include transdermal, buccal or sublingual application.
