The electrode has a mercaptosilane coated surface and redox catalyst which is electrogenerated in-situ on the surface of the electrode.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Detection of chemical agent Sulphur Mustard (known for its ability to alkylate the biological species upon exposure), plays a vital role during a normal time, chemical emergency and also in a war scenario in order to take appropriate counter measures including protection, decontamination and other related measures. A fleet of detection equipment is commercially available for the detection of chemical agents like sulphur mustard based on many techniques known in the art<br>
US4974963: describes method by flame photometric detection system. The method is having disadvantages such as sensing all sulphur containing compounds and also requiring very high temperature for exciting the sulphur atom.<br>
US5345213: describes a metal oxide based detection system, the main disadvantage of the system is that the sensor part is required to be kept at high temperature.<br>
US 7071465 and US20020000811: involves the mobility of ions and the shortcomings of the invention are the usage of membrane, ionization source and requirement of changing the polarity depending on the nature of agents.<br><br>
US5469369: describes a detection system method based on surface acoustic wave. The disadvantages of the system is that it requires different quartz chips coated with different polymers based upon the kind of agent. A reference chip is also used in parallel to the working chip.<br>
US2006191320: describes a method based on array of modified micro cantilevers for the detection of sulphur mustard, and its disadvantage is use of specific coating requirement<br>
US 4797180 and US4707242: describes yet another method is electrochemical based sensors for toxic gases which are not used for sulphur mustard sensing.<br>
EP0297738: describes a method for treatment of halogenated compound and decomposition of organic waste matter, by the use of electrochemically generated silver ions. The problems faced are insolubility and consequent precipitation of resulting silver ions in the solution.<br>
None of the method as described in the prior art is based on simple electrochemical technique for toxic gases like Sulphur mustard sensing due to high penetrative and adsorptive nature of agent towards electrodes and other materials.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to provide a surface modified electrode which is capable of<br>
oxidizing the chemical agents like sulphur mustard.<br>
The surface modified electrode comprises of:<br>
(i)        a substrate;<br>
(ii)      a mercaptosilane coating on the surface of the substrate; and<br>
(iii)     in-situ electro generated metallic nano particle sized redox catalyst on the surface of the<br><br>
coated electrode.<br>
The substrate of the electrode is selected from the group consisting of platinum, gold, graphite and glassy carbon.<br>
The substrate is coated with a layer of mercaptosilane. The hydrophobic nature of the silanes avoids the adsorption of sulphur mustard on the electrode surface and thereby it is easy to clean the electrode surface by a simple wash which overcomes extra decontamination process required for the electrode cleaning. The silane used can have a chain length of 3 to 10 carbon atoms and even more.<br>
The redox catalyst is generated in-situ on the surface coated electrode. The nanometallic catalyst is selected from electroactive metals like palladium, silver, platinum, iridium, ruthenium, bismuth, cadmium, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, antimony, tin and the kind, preferably silver. The particle size of metallic nano particle sized redox catalyst lies in the range of 5 to 80 nm.<br>
The invention also provides a method for preparation of the surface modified electrode capable of oxidizing the chemical agents of the kind sulphur mustard. The process step comprises of:<br>
(i)       immersing the substrate into a solution of mercaptosilane solution of 0.01 to 0.25 M for<br>
60 to 300 minutes; (ii)      removing the mercaptosilane surface coated substrate and dry it for 30 to 120 minutes; (iii)     immersing the dried surface coated substrate from the solution into an electrochemical<br>
cell wherein the said electrochemical cell is having:<br>
a reference electrode; and<br>
a counter electrode;<br>
the reference electrode and die counter electrode being immersed in electrolyte of 0.01<br>
to 0.5 M KN03 having 0.0001 to 0.01 M silver nitrate; (iv)      applying a voltage of 1.0 V and changing the voltage to -1.0 V and repeating the cycle 3<br>
to 20 times; (v)       withdrawing the electrode and drying to obtain the surface modified electrode.<br>
The reference electrode which has a stable and well known electrode potential is used like silver/silver<br>
chloride electrode.<br>
The counter electrode ensure mat current does not run through the reference electrode. The counter<br>
electrode used is made up of platinum or a glassy carbon.<br>
Mercaptosilane used has a molarity of 0.01 to 0.25 M.<br>
The potential of the cell is 3 to 20 times cycled between 1.0 volt to -1.0 volt in order to in-situ<br><br>
electrogenerate the metallic nano particle sized catalyst on the surface of the coated electrode . The electrode is then withdrawn from the electrochemical cell and dried. After this, the electrode is pretreated to get stable current and utilized for the oxidative sensing of chemical agents in micromole concentrations in a 0.1 to 0.5 M KN03 solution by cyclic voltametrically between -1.0 to 1.0 volt. In addition, the modified electrode is also characterized by impedance spectroscopy.<br>
This invention may also be useful for sensing other chemical agents by changing the cycling potential appropriately. The other chemical agents detected by the present invention are nerve agents such as Sarin, Soman, Tabun, VX and blister agents such as Nitrogen mustard. One can change the potential window until getting the electrochemical catalytic activity for the respective agent and utilizes the same potential window for the sensing and degradation of other chemical agents.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 are cyclic voltammogram and electrochemical impedance spectrum for bare gold electrode respectively. In Fig. 1, it is observed that the CV oxidation current with sulphur mustard in KN03 is less (Fig lb) when compared to CV oxidation (Fig. la) oxidation current without sulphur mustard in KN03. This observation is due to the strong adsorption of sulphur mustard on the bare gold electrode and this process is confirmed from the Fig. 2 which is electrochemical impedance spectrum with sulphur mustard (Fig. 2b) and without sulphur mustard in KN03 (Fig. 2a). It is observed from Fig. 2 that impedance with sulphur mustard is more when compared to in absence of sulphur mustard, this result confirms the blocking of electrochemical activity on the gold electrode surface by sulphur mustard adsorption.<br>
Figs. 3 and 4 are cyclic voltammogram (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectrum for silane surface coated electrode, respectively. Fig. 3 is entirely different from Fig.l and this observation is due to the presence of silane coating on the surface of gold electrode electrode. Moreover, Fig. 4 shows a very huge impedance (Fig. 4a) when compared to Fig. 2a due to presence of silane coating on the surface of gold electrode. However, the impedance in Fig. 2 with sulphur mustard is increased (Fig. 2b) when compared to a decrease in impedance with sulphur mustard on silane surface coated gold electrode in Fig. 4b. This observation confirms the non-adsorption of sulphur mustard on silane layer due to the hydrophobic nature of silane.<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 are cyclic voltammogram and electrochemical impedance spectrum for surface modified electrode (silane coated on surface with in-situ generated nanoparticle redox catalyst), respectively. Fig. 5a is entirely different from Fig. la and Fig. 3a and this observation is due to the presence of electrogenerated redox catalyst on the silane coated surface of gold electrode. Moreover, Fig. 4a shows a very huge impedance when compare to Fig. 2a due to the presence of silane on the surface of gold electrode in absence of sulphur mustard, in contrast Fig. 6a   shows very less impedance due to the<br><br>
presence of electrogenerated redox catalyst on the silane coated surface of gold electrode in the absence of sulphur mustard and also in presence of sulphur mustard (Fig. 6b). However, after the addition of sulphur mustard a huge increase of current due to the oxidation of sulphur mustard is observed in Fig. 5b. this confirms the electrocatalysis on the electrode surface as well as oxidation of sulphur mustard. In addition, the impedance in Fig. 6 is almost same with sulphur mustard (Fig. 6b) and without sulphur mustard (Fig. 6 a). Moreover, the impedance in Fig. 6a is very less when compared to in Fig. 2 a and Fig. 4 a and this is due to the presence of the electrogenerated catalyst silver on the silane coated gold electrode. The huge sulphur mustard oxidation current observed in Fig. 5 b confirms the applicability of this electrogenerated catalyst on the silane coated gold electrode modification for the sensing and degradation of sulphur mustard. The main advantage of this modification is avoiding the surface adsorption of sulphur mustard by silane layer based on its hydrophobicity and thereby reusing this electrode for sensing and modifications without decontaminating the electrode surface. The stability of the modification is indicated in Fig. 7 by taking scan rate variation studies which showed good current increase with respect to increase with respect to increase in the scan rate.<br>
EXAMPLE:<br>
A gold disk electrode is immersed into a solution of 3-Mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane and kept for<br>
90 minutes. The electrode is removed and dried for 60 minutes. The surface coated electrode is now<br>
immersed into the electrochemical cell in which 0.002 M of silver nitrate is dissolved in 0.1 M KN03.<br>
The reference electrode used is silver/silver chloride electrode and counter electrodes of the cell is<br>
platinum wire.<br>
The potential of the cell is men cycled 10 times between 0.4 V and -0.8 V in order to in-situ<br>
electrogenerate the redox nanoparticle catalyst on the silane coated surface of the gold electrode. The<br>
electrode is then withdrawn from the electrochemical cell and dried.<br>
The electrode is pre-treated to get stable currents and utilized for the oxidative sensing of sulphur<br>
mustard in micromole concentrations in 0.1 M KNO3 solution by cyclic voltammetrically between -0.2<br>
V and 0.7 V.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
