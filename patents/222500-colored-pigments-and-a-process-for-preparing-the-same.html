The present invention relates to colored pigments, and a process for preparing the same.<br>
The use of colored pigments in the industry has gained wide acceptance in a number of applications. Generally, the particle size of available colored pigments has hindered efforts to improve products containing colored pigments. Currently, the only satisfactory way to make colored pigments having small particle sizes has been with the use of a dispersant, such as surfactants and polymeric resins. However, while the colored pigments having the small particle sizes can be made, these colored particles are only stable with the aid of the dispersant, and if the dispersant is substantially removed, the colored pigments will agglomerate and thus lose their small particle size. The need for the dispersant to be always present has, however, prevented or hindered the use of colored pigments in many applications, since the presence of the dispersant must be taken into account when formulating compositions, such as inks. Other problems associated with the use of dispersant include: dispersants can be incompatible with other ink components, the dispersants must be used in large quantities, and the inks with surfactants generally has low surface tension.<br>
Also, aqueous systems are increasingly being used in many applications such as automotive and industrial coatings, paints, papers, inks, toners, adhesives, latexes, etc. as manufacturers face increased pressure to replace conventional solvent based systems. Such aqueous systems are known and generally contain a colorant, such as a dye, which is soluble in the aqueous vehicle, such as water or a mixture of water and a water-soluble or water-miscible organic solvent.<br>
Although dye-based compositions are readily utilized, dyes have several disadvantages when used in aqueous ink systems. For example, dyes, being water-soluble in a water/organic mixture, may dissolve and run when exposed to moisture or water. Dye images may further smear or rub off on contact with felt pen markers or upon being rubbed or touched by a finger. Dyes also exhibit poor light stability when exposed to visible or ultraviolet light.<br><br>
Pigments are also known as colorants in aqueous compositions but have not received a wide degree of acceptance in aqueous systems, such as ink jet inks, because of problems associated with the performance and reliability of the composition, i.e., print properties, stability, latency, and the like. Examples of such pigments include carbon black, titanium dioxide white, cobalt blue (C0O-AI2O3), phthalocyanine blue, phthalocyanine green, and chrome yellow (PbCr04).<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,045, to Johnson et al. describes novel surface-modified colored pigments and aqueous compositions containing such surface-modified colored pigments. Although such surface-modified colored pigments are a considerable improvement over dye-based or traditional pigment systems (i.e. pigments requiring stabilization with polymer or surfactant compositions), a continuing need exists for improved surface-modified colored pigments and processes for making the same, as well as aqueous or solvent based compositions containing such surface-modified colored pigments, especially for use in ink compositions which require long term colloidal stability and lightfastness. It is also desirable to produce improved aqueous ink compositions which exhibit improved latency and recoverability in their respective printing systems while providing good print properties. A further need exists for improved colored pigments and ink compositions which contain the colored pigments.<br>
In particular, while U.S. Patent No. 5,837,045 discloses colored pigments treated to introduce organic groups and further shows that the preferred average aggregate diameter of the surface-modified colored pigments is preferably from 0.005-0.3 microns, the present claims, as amended, do not include this characteristic. This reference does not disclose surface-modified pigments, or Inkjet ink compositions comprising them, having any of the four characteristics listed. Furthermore, the process of the present invention is also not described.<br>
Regarding WO 00/52102, while this reference discloses a process for preparing surface-modified colored pigments, the process of the present invention is not the same. WO<br><br>
00/52102 relates to a process which includes the steps of preparing a reaction batch comprising a treating agent and a diazotizing agent, adding a colored pigment to the batch, and mixing under high shear conditions. By comparison, the method of the present invention comprises the steps of combining at least one treating and at least one type of colored pigment(s) in a container to form a mixture, subjecting this mixture to high shearing, and then introducing at least one diazotizing agent to the mixture for at least a portion of time while the high shearing is taking place. Therefore, the processes are not the same since the order of addition is different and the timing of the high shearing is different.<br>
Regarding U.S. Patent Nos. 5,571,311 and 5,630,868, neither of these references discloses, teaches, or suggests the use of high shear mixing. Also, neither describes the method of the present invention comprising the steps of combining specific reagents in a particular order under specified conditions.<br>
Regarding DE 198 50 152 (referring to corresponding U.S. Patent No. 6,024,786), while this reference describes Inkjet inks having a particle size below 500 nm, this characteristic is not recited in the present claims, as amended. This reference does not disclose surface-modified pigments, or Inkjet ink compositions comprising them, having any of the four characteristics listed, nor of the present process for preparing them.<br>
Similarly, JP 11246806 describes Inkjet ink compositions having a particle size less than 500 nm. However, this reference teaches the use of carbon black. Also, there is no teaching or suggestion of any of the other four characteristics, nor of the present process for preparing surface-modified colored pigments.<br>
Finally, JP 11080638 does not relate to pigments and JP 11256066 relates only to oxidized carbon blacks.<br>
The present invention relates to colored pigments having one or more desired parameters and/or properties without the addition of dispersants. These parameters and/or properties include: a particle size distribution of from about 10 nm to about 300 nm; an accusizer number of less than lO"* particle/ml of dispersion (at 15% solids) which are greater than 0.5 micron; a fllterability such that when in a liquid medium, 100 ml with 10% solids of the colored pigment filters through a 3 micron nylon absolute filter;<br><br>
a colored pigment puniy of greater than about S0%, based on extractable material; and/or<br>
a stability such that the above-described properties do not change by more than 50 % at 25 degrees C for 1 week.<br>
The above-described colored pigment is preferably in an aquedus or non-aqueous media having no external dispersant present.<br>
The present invention fiirther relates to a colored pigment having attached at least one organic group and having one or more of the above-described charactenstics-<br>
In addition, the present invention relates to a process for preparing surface-modified colored pigments. The process involves combining at least one treating agent and at least one type of colored pigment in a container to form a mixture and subjecting the mixture to high shearing and introducing at least one diazotizing agent to the mixture at least for a portion of time while the high shearing is taking place, and preferably while the entire high shearing is taking place, such that a reaction product is formed and contains surface-modified colored pigment(s). The treating agent has an organic group which comprises at least one diazotizable group. In a preferred embodiment, the diazotizable group comprises a) at least one aromatic group, at least one C,-C-(, alkyl group, or mixtures thereof; and b) at least one ionic group, ionizable group, nonionic group, or mixtures thereof Preferably, in this process, the product yield results in from about 30% to about 100% of the colored pigment having a particle size of from about lOnm to about 300 nm.<br>
The present invention is fiirther directed to a process for preparing ink compositions incorporating the colored pigments described above.<br>
The colored pigments prepared by the process of the present invention may be used in aqueous or solvent based compositions containing conventional pigments. Such compositions include, for example, automotive and industrial coatings, paints, papers, toners, inks (particularly, ink jet ink compositions), adhesives. latexes, textiles and fibers. The colored pigments may be tailored to provide compatibility with the particular aqueous or solvent based system and provide easier, more complete dispersion, improved colloidal stability and greater color intensity and shades.<br><br>

An ionizable group is one capable of fomiing an ionic group in the medium of use. The ionic group may be an anionic group or a cationic group and the ionizable group may form an anion or cation. The nonionic group is a group which does not possess or is not capable of possessing a charge.<br>
Ionizable functional groups forming anions or anionic groups include, for example, acidic groups or salts of acidic groups.

X' may be formed in-siiii as part of the manufacturing process or may be associated with the aromatic or aikyl group through a typical salt swap or ion-exchange process.<br>
Amines represent examples of ionizable functional groups that form cations or cationic groups and may be attached to the same groups as discussed above for the ionizable ijroups which form anions. For example, amines may be protonated to form ammonium groups in acidic media. Preferably, an organic group havmg an amine substituent has a pK^ of less than 5.

by reference herein.	- ■■- -■<br><br>
Further examples of the ionic or ionizable ftinctional groups include amphiphilic counierions which may be cationic or anionic in nature. An amphiphilic counCerion is a molecule or compound typically described as have a hydrophilic polar "head" and a hydrophobic "cail." Representative examples of cationic and anionic amphiphiUc counterions include those set fonh and described in U.S. Patent No. 5,698,016 to Adams et ai., the entire descnption of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
For purposes of further illustraiing the present invention, an amphiphilic counterion can be used. The surface-modified colored pigment, as described herein, has a cationic functionality {i.e. positive charge) or anionic functionality (negative charge). The charge preferably is created by the aromatic group or C,-C,oalkyl group of the diazolizable group attached to the pigment. If the desired surface-modified colored pigment is anionic in nature, then the amphiphilic counterion will be cadonic or posifive charging. Similarly, if the surface-modified colored pigment is cationic in nature, then the amphiphilic countenon will be anionic or negative charging.<br>
Examples of cationic amphiphilic counterions include, but are not limited to, those described ammonium ions that may be formed from adding acids to the following: a fatty amine, an ester of an aminoalcohol, an alkylamine, a polymer containing an amine functionality, a polyethoxyiated amme, a polypropoxylated amine, a polyethoxylated polypropoxylated amine, an aniline and derivatives thereof, a fatty alcohol ester of amino acid, a polyamine N-a!ky!ated with a dialkyi succinate ester, a heterocyclic amine, a guanidine derived from a fatty amine, a guanidine derived fitDm an alkylamine, a guanidine denved from an aryiamine, an amidine derived from a fatty amine, an amidine derived from a fatty acid, an amidine derived from an alkylamine, or an amidine derived from an aryiamine. The pKa of the ammonium ion is prefer^ly greater than the pKa of the protonated form of the aromatic or alkyl group on the pigment.<br>
Specific examples of cationic amphiphilic ions include dioctylammonium, oley [ammonium, stcarylammonium, dodecylammonium, dimethyldodecylammonium, stearylguanidinium, oieylguamdinium, soyalkylammonium, cocoalkylammonium, oleyiammoniumethoxylate, protonated diethanoiaminedimyristate, and N-oleyldimediyiammonium. Generally, to form the ammonium ions described above, the various compounds described above such as fatty amines, esters of amino alcohols, etc., are<br><br>
reacted with an acid such as carboxylic acid, a mineral acid, an alkyl sulfonic acid, or an aryl sulfonic acid.<br>
Quaternary ammonium salts can also be used as the sources of the cationic amphiphilic ion. Examples include, but are not limited to, a fatty alkyl trimethyl ammonium, a di(fatty allcyl)dimethylammoniura, an alkyl lrimeth&gt;J ammonium, or 1-alkyl pyridinium sal:, where the counlerion is a halide, methosulface, sulfonate, a sulfate or the like. Also, phosphonium salts, such as tetraphenylphosphonium chloride can be used as the sources of the amphiphilic ion.<br>

Daniels, Technomic Publishing Co., Lancaster, PA (1989), all incorporated in their entirety herein by reference, can be used as the polymeric groups of the present invention.<br>
The polymeric groups of the present invention can be prepared in a number of ways and such ways are known to those skilled in the art. The above referenced KIRK-OTHMER section.

Besides the organic group compnsing the dye, an organic group having an ionic group and a counterionic group can have a dye serving as the counterionic group. Attaching a dye to the colored pigment can provide the advantage of modifying the coior properties of pigments. Also, the organic group(s) attached to the colored pigment can be one or more types of light stabilizers, e.g., hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS) or antioxidant.<br>
In addition, the present invention relates to a process for preparing surface-modified colored pigments. The process involves combining at least one treating agent and at least one type of colored pigment(3) in a container (e.g., a jacketed container) to form a mixture and subjecting the mixture to high shearing and introducing at least one diazotizing agent to<br><br>
the mixture for at least a portion of lime while the high shearing is taking place, and preferably during the entire time that high shearing is taking place, such that a reaction product is formed and contains surface-modi fed colored ptgment(s). The treating agent has an organic group which compnses at least one diazotizable group. In a preferred embodiment, the diazotizable group comprises a) at least one aromatic group, at least one C,-C,o alkyl group, or mixtures thereof; and b) at least one ionic group, ionizabie group, nonionic group, or mixtures thereof. The organic groups mentioned throughout this disclosure can be a part of the treating agent.<br>
The treating agent for use in the process of the present invention comprises an organic group which comprises at least one diazotizable group. For purposes of the present invention, a "diazotizable group" means a nitrogen containing compound which, in the presence of a diazotizing agent, will react to form a diazonium salt. The "diazotizing agent" means any compound which will donate a nitrogen atom diuing the reaction with the diazotizable group to form the diazonium salt. In a preferred embodiment the diazotiz^le group comprises a) at least one aromatic group, at least one C,-C;o alkyl group, and mixtures thereof; and b) at least one ionic group, ionizabie group, nonionic group, and mixtures thereof<br>
Typically, the diazotizing agent is any metal or organic nitrite including, for example, ammonium nitnte, butyl nitrite, dicyclohexylammonium nitrite, ethylnJtrite. isoamyinitrite, lithmm nitnte, sodium nitrite, potassium nitrite, or zinc nitrite, and may also include nitrous acid, nitrogen oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In more detail, the combinmg of at least one treating agent and at least one type of colored pigment(s) in a container to fomi a mixttire can be accomplished in any fashion, including, but not limited to, pouring each component into a vessel or other container at the weight ratio of the treating agent to the colored pigment as determined by the desired treatment level, reaction efficiency, and pigment surface area. For example, from about 10% to 50% by weight of treating agent can be used.<br>
Typically, a solution is prepared by mixing the desired treatmg agent m a liquid reaction medium. Preferably, the mixing occurs for a sufficient amount of time to substantially dissolve or distribute the treating agent. A preferred Uquid reaction medium includes water, any medium containing water, any medium containing alcohols, and tmxmres thereof A water based reaction medium is most preferred.<br><br>
The treadng agent, alone or dissolved or distributed in a liquid reaction medium, and the colored pigment can be added separately, and the high shearing, which is part of the process, can mix the two components together to form a mixture. As part of the process, the mixture is subjected to high shearing, in a preferred embodiment, the mixing takes place in a suitable vessel under high shear conditions and utilizes equipment capable of providing a grinding or impact action, liquid shear cavitation or other means of particle size reduction. Different siiearing devices can be used in combination or in series such as horizontal media mills, vertical media mills such as atiriiors, ball mill, hammer mills, pin disk mills, fluid energy mills, jet mills, sonicators, and the like.  Preferably, the high sheanng occurs in high pressure fluid impingement reactors. Other examples include, but are not limited to, high pressure homogenizers. rotor slaiors. distributive devices, impact dispersers (media/ball), and the like. Foe purposes of this invention, "high shear" means an energy sufficient to reduce the particle size distribution of the colored pigment to a desired size and continually expose new surfaces of the colored pigment to the reaction solution, thereby improving the distribution and level of the treating agent being attached to the surface of the colored pigment and the overall product yield.  Preferably, die same vessel is used in the high shear mixing step as that used to prepare the reaction solution of treating agent and diazotizing agent.   In addition, the vessel may be preferably equipped with suitable means for adding heat or removing heat, such as a heating mantle, thermocouple and the like.<br>
The operating temperaiure and pressure of the process can be any temperature or pressure as long as the liquids being processed remain a liquid dunng the process. For instance, the temperature can be from about 0 to about 90 degrees C when in an aqueous enviroiunent.<br>
The reaction time depends on the treating agent(s) used, but typically can be from about 30 minutes or less to about 5 hours or more. The residence ume of the reactants in the process can be any time and is typically dependent on the desired particle size and/or the reaction rate. Typically, the residence time is from about 30 minutes to about 7 days or more, and preferably is from about 30 minutes to about 24 hours, and most preferably is from about 30 minutes to about 5 hours. Typically, the high shear mixing will occur at a temperature ranging from about 0°C and 90°C for a time period between 30 minutes and 48 hours. Preferably, the high shear mixing takes place at a temperamre ranging from about 50°C and 75°C for a time period between 1 hour and 24 hours because such a range has been<br><br>
foimd to produce a surface-modified colored pigment with improved dispersibility, stability and color intensity.<br>
In the present process, at least one diazotizmg agent is introduced to the mixture for at least a portion of time while the high shearing is taking place, and preferably while the endre high shearing is taking place, such that a reaction product'is formed and contains surface-modi fed colored pigmem(s). Adding the diazoiizing agent m this manner permits the formation of the diazonium salt in a continuous fashion which permits the attachment of organic groups on the new surfaces of the colored pigment being created as the colored pigment is being reduced in particle size (i.e.. as the surface area of the colored pigments is being increased during shearing operations). The diazotizing agent can be introduced in any manner, such as pumping, nozzles, or by in-hne static mixing.<br>
In the present process, the shearing of the colored pigments can begin before, during, and/or after the introduction of the diazotizing agent. By shearing the colored pigments beforehand, the colored pigments can begin to be broken up before attachment of organic groups begins by the addition of the diazotizing agent. Further, with the present process, any combination of steps can be preformed, such as adding the diazotizing agent and then shearing and then adding more diazotizing agent which can be the same or different from the first diazotizing agent added. Thus, it is within the bounds of the present invention to have any combination and/or sequence of steps with respect to shearing and the addition of the diazoiizing agent and the treating agent. Further, a combination of different diazonium salts can be formed to attach more than one type of organic group on the surface of the colored pigment(s).<br>
Depending on the shearing device, the amount of solids dunng processing can vary and various amounts are preferred. For instance, when a high pressure homogenizer is used, less than 30% solids is preferred, and less than 20% solids is more preferred, and less than about 10% solids is most preferred, wherein the % is based on by weight of the entire materia! being processed. With respect to a rotor staler, less than 30 % solids is preferred, and less than 20 % solids is more preferred, and from about 5 % to about 15 % solids is most preferred. Wiih respect to a distributive device, iess tlian 50 % solids is preferred, from about 5 to about 50 % is more preferred, and from about 20 % to about 40 % solids is most preferred. With respect to an impact disperser, less than 50 % solids is preferred, from about<br><br>
5 % to about 50 % solids is more preferred, and from about 10 % to about 20 % solids is most preferred.<br>
To prepare the above modified pigment products, the diazonium salt need only be sufficiently stable to allow reaction with the pigment. Thus, that reaction can be carried out with some diazonjum salts oihenvise considered to be unstable and subject to decomposition. Some decomposition processes may compete with the reaction between the pigment and the diazonium salt and may reduce the total number of groups attached to the pigment. Further, the reaction may be carried out at elevated temperatures where many diazonium sails may be susceptible to decomposition. Elevated temperatures may also advantageously increase the solubility of the diazonium salt in the reaction medium and improve its handling during the process. The pigment can be reacted with a diazonium sait when present as a dilute, easily stirred, aqueous slurry, or as a more concentrated highly mixed slurry in water or thick paste.<br>
A preferred method of preparing the modified pigment products involves reducing the pigments to be modified to a size desirable for the particular end use application. If, of course, the pigment is already of an appropriate size, then no reduction in size is necessary- Generally, the size of the pigment can be the same size as the pigment sizes used conventionally for the particular end use applications. For instance, the average particle size of the pigment can be about 10 microns or less, and preferably about 5 microns or less. Preferably, for instance, in Inkjet ink applications, the average pigment particle size is preferably less than about I micron and more preferably less than about 0.5 micron (e.g., a preferred range is about 0.01 micron to less than about 1 micron), and is preferably less than about 10 microns for coalings, toner, polymer, and rubber applications, Jf size reduction of the pigment to be modified is preferred, any method of reducing size can be used such as those described in T.C. Palton, "Paint Flow and Pigment Dispersion," 2nd ed., Wiley, NY (1979), incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The level of treatment of the various groups attached on ihe pigment can be any amount and preferably is from about 0.10 to about 50 micromoles/m', and more preferably is from about 0,30 to about 10 micromoles/'m'. When low levels of treating agent are desired, it has been found that the diazotizable/organic group is typically mtrodiiced (i.e. present in the reaction solution) at a ievei from about O.OI to 5.0 micromoies/ra'of the colored pigment used, based upon the nitrogen surface area of the colored pigment.  When<br><br>
traditional levels of treating agent are desired, it has been found that the diazotizable/organic ^roup is typically introduced (i.e. present in the reaction solution) at a level from about 5.0 to 50.0 micromoles/m" of the colored pigment used, based upon the nitrogen surface area of the colored pigment. Lastly, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the pH of the reaction mixture may be varied depending on the particular treating agent and the most efficient reaction conditions and may, for example, be at a pH around neutral if appropriate.<br>
An advantage of the preseiit invention is that the colored pigments having at least one organic group attached preferably have substantially, if not the same, color of the starting colored pigment prior to being modified.<br>
The  pigment  products  may   be purified   by  washing,   such   as   by   filtration, cenlrifugaiion. or a combination of the two methods, to remove utireacted raw materials, byproduct salts, and other reaction impurities. The products may also be isolated, for example, by evaporation or il may be recovered by filtration and drying using known techniques to those skilled in the art. Dispersions of the pigments of the present invention may be further purified or classified to remove impurities and other undesirable free species which can co-exisi in the dispersion as a result of the manufacturing process. In a preferred embodiment, the pigment dispersions are subject to a classification step, such as centrifugation, to substantially remove particles having a size above about 1.0 micron, preferably above about 0.5 micron,   in addition, the dispersion is preferably purified to remove any undesired free species, such as unreacted treating agent. Known techniques of ultrafiltrarion/diafillration using a membrane or ion exchange may be used to purify the dispersion and remove a substantial amount of free ionic and unwanted species.   Also preferred is an optional exchange of counterions whereby the countenons that form apart of the surface-modified pigment are exchanged or substituted with alternative counterions utilizing known ion exchange techmques such as ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, ion exchange columns and the like. Particular examples of counterions that can be exchanged include, but are not limited to, Na*, K', Li', NH/, Ca', Mg", CI'. NO,", NO;', acetate, carboxylale, and Br'.   Such addirional classification and purificauon methods are more fiiUy described in U. S. Patent Application No. 09/240,291, filed January 29, 1999, the disclosure of which is fiilly incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
Uses of the Colored Pigments<br>
The colored pigments of this invention may be used in the same applications as conventional pigments. The groups preferably attached to the pigment, however, can be used to modify and improve the properties of a given pigment for a particular use.<br>
The colored pigments according to the present invention can be used in a number of end use applications. These uses include, for example, plastic compositions, aqueous and non-aqueous inks, aqueous and non-aqueous coalings, rubber compositions, toner compositions, paper products, and textile and fiber compositions. The foliowing paragraphs describe these uses generally and examples of each are shown below.<br>
The colored pigments of the present invention may be used in aqueous or solvent based composjiions containing conventional pigments. The following discussion reJating to ink compositions is similarly apphcable to other Uquid systems including, for example, coatings, papers, inks, toners, adhesives, latexes, textiles and fibers.<br>
The present invention relates to an inkjet ink composition comprising an aqueous or non-aqueous vehicle and a colored pigment of the present invention. In contrast to conventional pigments, the colored pigments for use in the itikjet ink of the present invention are not difficult to disperse in an aqueous or non-aqueous vehicle. The colored pigments do not necessarily require a conventional milling process, nor are additional dispersants necessarily needed to attain a usable ink. Preferably, the modified pigment products only require low shear stirring or mixing to readily disperse the pigment in water or other solvent.<br>
Formation of an inkjet ink containing a vehicle and stably dispersed colored pigment can be preformed with a minimum of components-and processing steps when the above modified pigment products are utihzed. Such an ink may be used in any inkjet printer known in the art. Preferably, in inkjet inks of the present invention, the colored pigments are present in an amoimt of less than or equal to 20% - 25% by wei^t of the inkjet ink. It is also within the bounds of the present invention to use an Inkjet ink formulation containing a mixmre of unmodified pigment with the colored pigments of the present invention. Common additives such as those discussed below may be added to the dispersion to further improve the properties of the inkjet ink.<br>
Suitable additives are also generally incorporated into the ink or ink jet composition to imparl a number of desired properties while maintaining the stabihty of the compositions.<br><br>
For example, a surfactant or suitable polymer may be used to further enhance the colloidal stability of the colored pigment in the ink composition. Other additives are well known in the art and include humectants, biocides, binders, drying accelerators, penetrants and the like. Examples of humectants include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol; glycenne, dipropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, poiypropylefte glycol, alkane diols, amides, ethers, carboxylic acids, esters, alcohols, organosulfldes, organosulfoxides, sulfones, alcohol derivatives, I-pyrrolidone, elher derivatives, amino alcohols, and ketones. The amount of a particular additive will vary depending on a variety of factors but are generally present in an amount ranging between 0% and 40%, preferably between 0.1% and 10%, although the amount may be outside this range.<br>
In particular, a humectant may be added to reduce the rate of evaporation of water in the ink to minimize clogging. If the ink begins to dry out. the humectant concentration increases and evaporation decreases further. Humectants may also affect other properties of the ink and prints made therefrom, such as viscosity, pH, surface tension, optical density, and print quality. Preferred humectants include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycols, glycerine, dipropylene glycols, polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, amides, ethers, carboxylic acids, esters, alcohols, organosulfldes, organosulfoxides. sulfones, alcohol derivatives, carbitol, butyl carbitol. ceilosolve, ether derivatives, amino alcohols, and ketones.<br>
Biocides such as benzoate or sorbate salts are important in preventing bacterial growth. Bacteria are often larger than ink nozzles and can cause clogging and other problems. Binders attach to the substrate to hold the colorant on the paper. Examples include polyester, polyester-meianine, styrene-acrylic acid copolymers, styrene-acrylic acid-alkyl acrylate copolymers, styrene-maleic acid copolymers, styrene-raaleic acid-alkyl acrylate copolymers, styrene-methacryiic acid copolymers, styrene-methacrylic acid-aikyl acrylate copolymers, styrene-maieic half ester copolymers, vinyl naphthalene-acrylic acid copolymers, vmyl naphthalene-maleic acid copolymers, and salts thereof Drying accelerating agents promote evaporation of the ink once the ink is placed in the paper. These include sodium lauryl sulfate, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, cyclohexylpyirolidinone, and butyi carbitol. Penetrants such as alcohols, sodium lauryl sulfate, esters, and ketones allow the ink to penetrate the surface of the paper. Alcohols may also be used to increase<br><br>
the rate of drying of the liquid ink, and surfactants like detergents and soap reduce the surface tension to allow the ink to spread on the substrate.<br>
Additionally, the modified pigment products-based Inkjet inks may incorporate some dye to modify color balance and adjust optical density. Such dyes include food dyes, FD &amp;.

Polymers or oligomers may be added to inkjet inks based on the modified pigment products. The images created from such an ink may be water-insoluble upon polymenzation or cross-linking of the added polymers or oligomers.<br>
Additionally, in preparing inkjet inks utilizing the modified pigment products of the present invention, sequential filtration of the inks through filters of descending size or centrifugation or both may be used to obtain a more desirable final product. For instance, filtering first with a 3.0 micron filter and then filtenng with a 1.0 micron filter, and so on, as desired. In addition, the size of the modified pigment products in the inkjet inks is preferably no larger than about 2 microns. More preferably, the size of the modified pigment product is one micron or less.<br>
Advantageously, the inkjet inks of the invention have excellent stability over time and a wide range of temperatures, have desirable viscosities and surface tensions, and when printed, have good optical density, print clarity, rub resistance, and waterfastness.<br>
Ink compositions containing the colored pigments of the present invention have been found suitable for use in imaging applications, particularly for use in inkjet inks. Such ink and inkjet compositions exhibit improved formulation properties and storage stability. In addition, images generated from such ink and ink jet compositions exhibit good waterfastness and color intensity.<br>
The colored pigments of the present invention are present in the aqueous or solvent based ink or ink Jet composition in an amount effective to provide the desired image quality, e.g., optical density, without deoimentaUy affecting the performance of the ink. Typically, the colored pigments will be present in an amount ranging from about 1% to about 20%, preferably from about 2% to about 10%, based on the weight of the ink composition. In addifion. the colored pigment is typically as small as possible to enable a stable colloidal suspension of the pigment in the liquid vehicle and to prevent clogging of the ink channels<br><br>
and nozzles when used in the desired printing application. For example, a preferred average particle size of the surface-modified colored pigment for use m a thermal ink jet printer are generally below 1.0 micron, preferably in a range from about 0.005 micron Co about 0.3 micron.<br>
The ink compositions of the present invemion may be prepared utilizing conventional techniques known to those skilled m the art. such as combining or mixing the desired componeni in a suitable aqueous or solvent based medium. When the ink and ink jet compositions are aqueous based systems, a significant amount of water, preferably deionized or distilled water, is typically used. For example, the amount of water or similar medium is generally present in an amount ranging from about 50% to about 95%, preferably from about 60% to 80%, based on the weight of the ink or ink jet composition.<br>
The ink and ink jet compositions of the present mvention may be buffered to the desired pH by the addition of a suitable base, such as sodium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, triethylamine, dimethylethanolamine and the like, or a suitable acid, such as mineral acids, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and the like. In addition, a polymer which is ' soluble in the ink composition may be added to improve the waterfastness of the images generated from the ink compositions. By "soluble" is meant that the polymer will dissolve in the ink vehicle to form a one phase system. These polymers include, for example, polyvinyl alcoho). polyesier. polyesrermelamine, styrene-acrylic acid copolymers, slyrene-maleic acid copolymers, styrene-maleic acid-alkyl acrylate copolymers, styrene-methacryiic acid copolymers, styrene-methacryiic acid-aikyi acrylate copolymers, styrene-maleic haif ester copolymers, vinyl naplhalene-acrylic acid copolymers, vinyl napthalene-maleic acid copolymers and salts thereof. Additional polymers include poiyvinylimidazoie, derivatives of poiyvinylimidazoie, polyvinylpyrolidone and copolymers thereof, copolymers of vinylimidazole, copolymers of vinylimidazole derivatives, polyvinyipyridine, derivatives of poiyvinylpyridine, copolymers of vinylpyridine, copolymers of vinylpyridine derivatives, poJyethylenetmine, derivatives of poiyethyleneimine, and mixtures thereof, as described in PCT Publication No. WO 96/18688, the disclosure of which is fuliy incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Printed images may be generated from the ink or ink jet compositions of the present invention by incoiporaling such compositions into a suitable printing apparatus, and generating an image onto a substrate. Suitable ink jet printers include, for example, thennal<br><br>
printers, piezoeleccnc printers, continuous printers, valve printers and the like. Similarly, any suitable substrate can be employed including piain papers, bonded papers, coated papers, transparency materials, textile materials, plastics, polymeric films, inorganic substrates and the like.<br>
As noted above, the colored pigments of the present invention may be useful in a wide variety of aqueous or solvent based applications and, in particular, ink compositions to provide the desired color and intensity. Unlike conventional pigments, the colored pigments of the present invention are readily dispersed in the desired liquid vehicle. In addition, the colored pigment are coUoidally stable in the liquid vehicle and does not require conventional milling, nor the aid of a dispersant. The colored pigments preferably require only low shear mixing or stirring into the hquid vehicle.<br>

The colored pigments of the present invention can also be used to impart conductivity to a plastic material The colored pigments of the present invention may give an increased rate of dispersion or improved quality of dispersion over the corresponding untreated or conventional pigment. These improvements offer an economic advantage in plastic manufacture and in value of the finished product, respectively. Using the colored pigment of the present invention may improve impact strength of the plastic. Thus, the invention relates to an improved plastic composition comprising a plastic and the colored pigments of the present invention.<br>
As with conventional pigments, the colored pigments of the present invention can be used with a variety of plastics, including but not limited to plastics made from thermoplastic resins, thermosetting resins, or engineered materials, for example, composites.

Generally, the colored pigment is added like any other pigment to the plastic used lo form a plastic premix. This can be done, for example, in a dry mix or a melt stage. The modified pigment product may also be incorporated on or in a plastic by adding it to a solvent, where the plastic is soluble or partially-soluble, followed by removal of the solvent (e.g., by evaporation). The colored pigments of the present invention may be used in combination with other conventional additives in plastic compositions. According to the invention, the term plastic composition includes, but is not hmited to, any plastic material, article, goods, surface, fabric, sheet, film, and the like. For example, plastic materials include automotive parts, siding for homes, liners for swimming pools, roofing materials, packaging materials, synthetic fibers, food, and storage containers, hght absorbing applications (e.g., bar codes), and any variety of other household or industrial items.<br>
The colored pigments of the present invention are also useful in aqueous and non¬aqueous ink formulations. Thus, the invention provides an ink composition comprising an ink vehicle and a modified pigment product. Other known ink additives niay be incorporated into the ink formulation. Typical inks include, but are not limited to: lithographic, letterpress, flexographic, gravure, screening, phase change ink jet inks, and iakjet applications.<br>
In general, an ink consists of four basic components: (1) a colorant, (2) a vehicle or vamish which functions as a carrier during printing, (3) additives to improve printability, drying, and the like, and (4) solvents to adjust viscosity, drying and the compatibility of the other ink components. For a general discussion of the properties, preparation and uses of inks, see The Printing Manual, 5th Ed., Leach et ai, Eds. (Chapman and Hall, 1993) incorporated herein by reference. Various ink compositions are also disclosed, for example, in United States Patent Nos. 2,833,736; 3,607,813, 4,104,833; 4,770,706; and 5,026,755, incorporated in their entirety herein by reference.<br>
The colored pigments of the present invention, either as predispersion or as a sohd, can be incorporated into an ink formulation using standard techniques. Use of a water dispersible or solvent-dispersible modified pigment product of the present invention can<br><br>
provide a significant advantage and cost savings by reducing or eliminating the milling steps generally used with other conventional pigments.<br>
Flexographic inks represent a group of ink compositions. Fiexographic inks generally include a colorant, a binder, and a solvent. The modified pigment products of the invention are useful as flexographic ink colorants.<br>
The colored pigments of the present invention can be used in news inks. For example, a news ink composition may comprise an ink vehicle (e.g., water), the colored pigments of the present invention, a resin, and optional conventional additives such as antifoam additives or a surfactant.<br>
The colored pigments of the present invention may also be used in phase change (hot meit) inks. Phase change inks generally include at least one coloram and at least one phase change or wax carrier (e.g., a fatty amide-containing material like a mixture of a tetra amide compound and a mono*amide compound, or an alkanolamides and polyethylene glycol mixture). The phase change ink is in a solid phase at ambient temperature and in a liquid phase at an elevated operating temperature of the printer. When the ink is heated it melts to form a low viscosity fluid that can be ejected as droplets. Upon jetting, heated droplets impact on a substrate, and cool to ambient temperature forming films of uniform thickness. Subsequent impaction of ihe droplets on the substrate may also occur, depending upon the type of printer used. Use of the colored pigments of the present invention can provide a significant advantage in dispersion stability and earner compatibility over conventional pigments and in light-fastness over dyes.<br>
The colored pigments of the present invention can also be used in lithographic or flexographic printing. For example, the ink or fountain solution used in the printing process can contain the colored pigments of the present invention.<br>
The colored pigments of the present invention can also be used in the manufacture of lithographic prmting plates, such as infrared or near-infrared iaser-imageable priming plates. Typically, imaging occurs when the plate is exposed to radiation having wavelengths of between 800 and 1100 nm. Generally, an infrared or near-infrared Iaser-imageable lithographic printing plate includes at least the following layers: a grained-metal or polyester plate or sheet-like substrate and a radiation-absorptive layer coated thereon.   Protective layers for the substrate or the surface of the coated plate may also be<br><br>
tised in the present invention- When coated onto the substrate, the protective layer can also serve as an adhesion-promoting primer. Other layers may be used, for example, to improve adhesion between layers and durabiUty of the printing plate. The radiation-absorptive layer contains the colored pigment of the present invention along v^fith other conventional ingredients, such as resins and binders. In th'e imaging process, a lithographic printing plate is selectively exposed to a laser output or other source capable of removing or chemically modifying the radiation-absorbent layer or layers adjacent Ihereio. The laser output will define a pattern on the printing plate and remove or modify only those portions of the radiation-absorptive layer which define the pattern. Afterwards, the printing plate can be further developed by subjecting it to a solvent capable of removing the imaged layeris). if any remains, which defines the same pattern. The details of the various conventional components and techniques for such pnnting plates are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,493,971; EP 0 803 771 Al; EP 0 770 494 A2, EP 0 770495 Al; as well as PCT Publication WO-98/31550 and the patents and publications referenced therein, all of which are incorporated in their entirety by reference herein.<br>
The colored pigments of the invention may also be used in coating compositions such as paints or finishes, or the like. Thus, an embodiment of the invention is a coating composition comprising an aqueous or non-aqueous vehicle, resin or binder, and a modified pigment product. Other known coating additives may be incorporated in the coating compositions. See, for examples, McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Technology, 5th Ed. (McGraw-Hill, 1982), incorporated herein by reference. See also United States Patents Nos, 5,051,464; 5,319,044; 5,204,404; 5,051,464; 4,692,481; 5,356,973; 5,314,945; 5,266,406; and 5,266,361, incorporated in their entirety by reference herein.<br>
The colored pigments of the present invention, either as a predispersion or as a solid, can be incorporated into a coating composition using standard techniques.

The present invention will be further clarified by the following examples, which are intended to be purely exemplary of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Ink-Jet ink formulation: Colored pigments in the examples below were formulated into ink-jet printer inks with the following ingredients and percentage amount by weight: organic color pigment 3%, ethylene giycol 7.5%, glycerol 7.5%, iso-propanol 4%. and balanced amount of deionized-water. The resulted inks were well mixed to ensure uniformity.<br>
Printing Test: Test prints were printed out on 6 different types of commercially available papers from the above ink jet inks with a Canon BJC 4400 printer and BCI-21 cartridge.<br>
Some or all of the following properties were determined and expressed as an<br>
average on the six types of papers from the test prints: CIELab color space, optical<br>
density (OD), light fastness (LF), waterfnstness (WF), and particle size distributions.<br>
Tristimulus color values, L*, a*, and b*, were determined using a Hunter Lab Scan II<br>
instrument (available from Hunter Associates Laboratory. Inc. Resion, VA). OD was<br>
determined by Macbeth Densitometer RD 915S (available from GrelagMacbeth LLC,<br>
New Windsor. NY). LF was determined by changes of trisimulus color and OD after<br>
exposing prints in a Q-UV weather-o-meter (available from Q-Panel, Cleveland, OH)<br>
for 3 weeks. The color difference A*ab between the initial color of the prints and the<br>
color of the prints after the exposing were determined from L*a*b* values by the<br>
following equation.<br>
A*ab = [(AL*)- + (Aa*)- + (Ab*)']""<br><br>
Waierfastness (WF) test was done by printmg a series of 0.32 cm solid bars with 0.96 cm spacing on six type of papers. The print samples were held at an approximaieiy 45 deg angle, then squirting 0.25 mL of water at the appropriate time point (1 minute after printing, 5 minutes after printing, etc.). If the runoff of the water squin was clear, then the print was considered to be waterfast at that time point.<br>
Mean volume particle size distribution of ink jet inks or pigment dispersions was determined by dynamic light scattering method using MICROTRAC Ultrafine Particle Analyzer (available from Honeywell, Minneapolis, MN).<br>
Two colloidal stability tests were described below to represent the types of lest performed to evaluate the stability (changing of particle size distribution) of pigment dispersions, or pigment dispersions with organic solvent.<br>
Accelerating aging test: in this test 10% pigment dispersions or 5% pigment dispersion with 10% 2-pyrrolidone were placed into an oven at 70 °C for 3 weeks. The change of mean particle size was used as criteria to judge the stability.<br>
Freeze and thaw test: In this test 10% pigment dispersions or 5% pigment dispersion with 10% 2-pyrro!idone were first frozen at -20" C for one day and then thawed at 70" C for another day. This was defined as one cycle. After each cycle the change of mean particle size was used as criteria to judge their stability. If after three cycles the mean particle size did not change significantly, those dispersions were considered stable.<br>
Their good filterability and low accusizer number also characterized the qualities of surface modified organic pigment dispersions in this invention.<br>
Filterability Test: Take 100 ml pigment dispersion at 5 % pigment loading and pass through a 3 micron nylon absolute filter (available from Pall Filtron, Northborough, MA) under 300 mmHg vacuum. The time for this material to pass through the filter was measured.<br>
Accusizer Test: AccuSizer Model 780 (available from PSS NICOMP, Santa Barbara, CA). Settings<br><br>

Sample preparation: 0.3 ml of pigment dispersion was diluted in 100 ml D! water. Then 0.2 m! of the diluted sample was injected into accusizer vessel. The total number of panicles per mL greater than 0.5 micron and 1 microns were recorded and adjusted to reflect the concentration of particles per m! of the initial dispersion corrected to the appropnate solid level.<br>
Elemental Analysis: Elemental analysis of sulfur, sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium in the surface modified organic pigments were obtained from a commercial analytical laboratory (Schwarzkopf Micro-analytical Lab. Woodside, NY) using well known methods.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of a surface modified organic pigment product in a high' pressure fluid impingement reactor<br>
Sulfanilic acid {102 g, available from Aldrich Chemical, Milwaukee, Wl) and<br>
PR122 {500 g, pigment red 122, available from Sun Chemical, Cincinnati, OH) were<br>
added to 9100 g of DI water and mixed in a jacketed tank equipped with an overhead<br>
stirrer until the material was wetted. The amount of suifanilic acid added corresponds<br>
to a treatment level of 1.2 mol of sulfanilic acid per kg of pigment. The material was<br>
then pumped via a diaphragm pump into a high pressure reactor (Microfluidizer<br>
Model 210 B, Microfluidics [ntemational Corporation, Newton MA) equipped with<br>
an interaction chamber, type L30Z, at a pressure of 15 000 psi.   The material exiting<br>
the reactor was recirculated to the feed tank.  The temperature of the material in the<br>
feed tank was maintained in the 55-75° C by controUing the jacket temperature.   As<br>
soon as the material was at 60° C, a 20 % sodium nitrite solution (204 g, available<br>
from Aldrich Chemical, Milwaukee, WI) was added uniformiy over a 1 hr period,<br>
initialing the surface modification reaction.   After all the sodium nitrite solution had<br>
been added, the reaction continued for another hr. while maintaining the temperature<br><br>
in the desired range. After completion, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool, the pH was adjusted to 7 using sodium hydroxide and the materia! was concentrated to 10 % and purified using ultrafiltration (Microza Hollow Fiber Membranes SLP1053, Pall Filtron, Northborough, MA). Further processing may include centrifugation or filtration for the removal of large particles and ion exchange tg replace the coimter-ion of the attached surface functionality.<br>
Example 2: Preparation of a surface modified organic pigment in a high shear rotor stator mixer<br>
To a rotor staior {Silverson Model L4RT-A, Silverson, East Longmeadow, MA) equipped with a jacketed 4 liter stainless steel vessel 1500 grams Dl-waier, which had been pre-heated to 60" C. were added.  Then 44.98 grams of sulfanilic acid were added to the vessel and the mixture was allowed to mix at 8000 rpm for 10 minutes. Then, 17.94 grams of sodium nitrite dissolved in 150 grams of Dl-water was added to the reaction mixture to pre-form the reactive species.   Immediately after all the sodium nitrite had been added, 200 g of copper phthalocyanine blue (pigment blue, Sunfast 15:4, available from Sun Chemical, Cincinnati, OH) was added to the rotor stator.   The reaction mixture was allowed to mix at 850O rpm for I hr, before 44,98 grams of additional sulfanilic acid was added and followed by 17.94 grams of sodium nitrite (which were dissolved in 150 grams of Dl-water).    The resulting mixture was allowed to react at 8500 rpra for additional 3 hrs at 65° C, The treatment level was equivalent to 2,6 mol of sulfanilic acid per kg of blue pigment.   Reaction mixture was then filtered through a 20 mm screen and purified using ultrafiltration until the permeate was colorless.   The resulting water dispersible blue pigment was then   centrifuged  at   10,000   rpm   for  30   minutes  using   a   type-19   rotor (L-80 Ultracentrifuge made by Beckman) to remove any unwanted large particles to give a stable aqueous dispersion of surface modified phthalocyanine blue pigment for further analysis and treatment.<br>
Example 3: Surface modified organic pigments and iok-jet inks with different particle size distribution<br><br>
Pigment 3,1 and Pigment 3,2 were prepared in an analogous way as in Example 2, with the exception that the pigment type used was PR122 and the treatment level was 1.2 moi/kg. In addition, pigment 3.2 was centrifuged for an additional 1.5 hrs to reduce the particle size, Pigment 3.3 was produced as described in example 1. These pigments were formulated into a ink-jet ink as previously described and the following test data were obtained. As can be seen, the present invention can be used to obtain pigments with desired particle size. The highest overall yield was achieved when utilizing the high-pressure fluid impingement reactor.<br>

Example 6: Surface modified organic pigments and ink-jet ioks with different treatment levels<br>
In this example ail three pigments were prepared according to the procedures described in Example 2, with the exceptions that three different treatment levels were used. All three dispersions showed good to fair stability over the accelerating aging test. The data clearly demonstrated that the present invention was able to control the number of functional groups attached to the colored pigment's surface, by varying the amount of treating agents used. Also, as can be seen from Table 5. as treatment level decreased, both yield and sodium level decreased.<br><br>

Example 7: Surface modified organic pigments and ink-jet inks with different counter ions<br>
[n this example, three different organic color pigments (PB 15:4, PR 122, and PY 74) were surface modified according to the procedures described in Example 2. Sodium ions in those dispersions were exchanged as pigment dispersions passing through a column packed with potassium or ammonia activated ion exchange resin (Dowex available from Aldrich Chemical, Milwaukee, WI.)   Table 6 demonstrated [hat ion exchange process effectively exchanged all the sodium ions to potassium ions.  Since all three type of pigments were treated with the same treatment level, the sulfur number indicated the attachment level varied with pigment. This difference in attachment efficiency is attributed to the inherently different molecular structure of the pigments and the available surface area that were accessible for treatment.   Table 7 shows that ion exchange process can be used to exchange one type of ion to other ions in order to enhance certain properties, eg., waterfastness and optical density.<br>

Example S: Surface modined color pigments with dual treating agents<br>
The diazonium salt of 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)aniline (BTFMA) {available from Aldrich Chemical, Milwaukee, WI) was prepared by adding 2,18 g of BTFMA to 13.0 g of concentrated sulfuric acid (available from Aidrich Chemical, Milwaukee, Wl ) containing 0,655 g sodium nitrite over a 30 minute period at 40° C, The preformed diazonium mixture was added over a 15 minute period to 500 g of 9,4% pigment dispersion (PB]5;4) prepared in Example 2. The reaction mixture was maintained at 60° C for 3 hrs. The product was then filtered, pH adjusted, ultrafiltered, polished filtered and dried down. The dried pigment was then Soxhlet extracted with THF for two days and subsequently analyzed for % F. The % F of the final product was l.l %. Table 8 shows the physical properties of the aqueous dispersion made in this example.<br>

Example 9: Organic pigment and ink-jel ink modified with dye molecules<br>
In this example direct blue 71 (a blue dye available from Aldrich Chemical, Milwaukee. WI) was used lo modified pigment blue 15:4 in accordance with the procedures described in Example 2. The dispersion was then formulated into Inkjet ink and the printing properties were obtained. It was obvious from Table 9 that attaching dye molecules can vary the color space of pigments. Obviously, one can achieved similar results by mixing pigments with dyes. However, the present invention can provide improved properties, e.g. formulation flexibility to the end users.<br>

In this example, a surface modified organic pigment was prepared according to the procedures in Example 2. Two samples were obtained during the ultra-filtration step, one was after ten volumes and the other was after 20 volumes of filtration. The impurity level did impact the printing properties of those pigment dispersions. For example, OD, WF, and coior were al! improved when impurities were removed.<br><br>

Example 11: Compatibility of surface modifled colored pigments with an organic solvent<br>
The pigments described in example 5 were used to prepare solutions that contained 5 % pigment, 10 % 2-pyTTolidone and 85 % DI water. These samples were then subjected to elevated temperature of 70° C over a period of two weeks as shown in Table 11. In addition these samples were also subjected to a freeze/thaw cycles as shown in Table 12. The particle sizes of the colored pigment were substantially unchanged following these tests, (Particle sizes were expressed in micron-meter.)<br><br>

Example 12: Surface modified organic pigment dispersions and ink-jet inks with the mixture of two surface modified pigments<br>
Pigment 12.1 was prepared in an analogous way to Pigment 5.1. Pigment 12.2 was prepared according to the procedure described in Example 1. Generic inks were made from Pigments 12.1 and 12.2.   Print propenies of the inks were compiled in<br><br>
Table 13. Pigment 12.3 was a 1:1 mixture of the inks of Pigment 12.1 and Pigment 12.2. Color space of the mixed pigment (Pigment 12.3) was a combination of the individual pigment color properties (Pigment 12.1 and 12.2).<br><br>

Example 13; Ion Exchange process can effectively remove soluble di-valeat ioos.<br>
The presence of di-valant ions, e.g. calcium, iron, magnesium, in the pigment dispersion was not favorable for some applications. Some of those ions came with pigment and some of them may have been introduced by the present invention. Since the present invention made pigment dispersible in water, soluble portions all those ions (some might be embedded in the crystal structure) can be removed effectively by ion-exchange process. In this example, a surface modified pigment prepared according to the procedures in Example 2 was ion exchanged according to example 7.<br>
The ion percentage before and after ion exchange was illustrated in Table 14.   The<br>
following table clearly illustrated the above points.<br>

Example 14: LF properties of surface modified organic pigments<br>
One of the more important properties of organic pigments is lightfasmess. This example shows that the present invention did not alter that property. In this example, pigment 14.1 (PB 15:4) was prepared according to the method in Example 2, and pigment 14.2 (PR 122) was prepared in Example 1. These pigment dispersions were then formulated into ink-jet inks. Prints from those inks were then exposed to UV hght for tiiree weeks. The color difference between prints prior and after the exposure was compared and tabulated in Table 15. As can be seen the lightfasmess properties of the original pigments have not been changed.<br>

Example 15: No dyelike molecules in pigment dispersion products<br>
When enough soluble groups, for example, benzenesulfonic acid groups, attach to a surface pigment molecule, the molecule can be converted into a soluble substance that will dissolved into media as a dye-iike molecule. Media soluble small molecules or aggregates were not observed during ultra-filtration or dialysis. When the surface modified pigments in Example 5 were dialyzed using 50,000 molecular weight cut-off membranes (Spectra/Por, available from VWR, Wiilard, OH), no colored substance leaked out. It was concluded that the color properties of those dispersions came only from surface modified pigment particles and that there are no dye-like molecules present in the products.<br>
Example 16: Other Modified Colored Pigments<br>
Table 16 shows physical property data of aqueous dispersion of sulfanilic acid surface modified colored pigments of PV19 (available from Sun Chemical, Cincinnati. OH) , PR254 (available from Ciba Chemical, Newport, DE) and PY151<br><br>
(available from Clariam, Coventry, Rl), These treatments were treated in a similar manner to that described in Example 1. All those pigment dispersions showed good stability characteristic over two weeks of accelerating aging test. Clearly, the present invention is broadly applicable and covers a wide range of pigment classes.<br>
