NOVEL ARYL SULFONAMIDE AMINE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE AS 5-HT6 LIGANDS Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel aryl sulfonamide amine compounds of the formula (I), their tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates described herein and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions containing them. <br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of above said novel compounds, their tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates described herein and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions containing them.<br>
These compounds are useful in the treatment or prevention of various disorders that are related to 5-HT6 receptor functions. Background of the Invention<br>
Various central nervous system disorders such as anxiety, depression, motor disorders etc., are believed to involve a disturbance of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or serotonin. Serotonin is localized in the central and peripheral nervous systems and is known to affect many types of conditions including psychiatric disorders, motor activity, feeding behavior, sexual activity and neuroendocrine regulation among others. 5-HT receptor subtypes regulate the various effects of serotonin. Known 5-HT receptor family includes the 5-HT, family (e.g. 5-HT,A), the 5-HT2 family (e.g. 5- HT2A &amp; 5-HT2C), 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HTs, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 subtypes.<br>
The 5-HT6 receptor subtype was first cloned from rat tissue in 1993 (Monsma, F. J.; Shen, Y.; Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W., Sibley, D.R., Molecular Pharmacology, 1993, 43, 320-327) and subsequently from human tissue (Kohen, R.; Metcalf, M. A.; Khan, N.; Druck, T.; Huebner, K.; Sibley, D. R., Journal of Neurochemistry, 1996, 66, 47-56). The receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) positively coupled to adenylate cyclase (Ruat, M.; Traiffort, E.; Arrang, J-M.; Tardivel-Lacombe, L.; Diaz, L.; Leurs, R.; Schwartz, J-C, Biochemical Biophysical Research Communications, 1993, 193, 268-276). The receptor is found almost exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS) areas both in rats as well as in humans.<br>
 <br>
In situ hybridization studies of 5-HT6 receptor in rat brain using mRNA indicate principal localization in the areas of 5-HT projection including striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and hippocampal formation (Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W.; Lachowicz, J. E.; Hoffman, B. J.; Sibley, D. R,; Dorsa, D. M., Neuroscience, 1995, 64, 1105-1111).   Highest levels of 5-HT6 receptor mRNA has been<br>
observed in the olfactory tubercle, the striatum, nucleus accumbens, and dentate gyrus as well as CAi, CA2<br>
and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. Lower levels of 5-HT6 receptor mRNA were seen in the granular layer<br>
of the cerebellum, several diencephalic nuclei, amygdala and in the cortex. Northern blots have revealed that 5-HT6 receptor mRNA appears to be exclusively present in the brain, with little evidence for its presence in peripheral tissues.<br>
The high affinity of number of antipsychotic agents towards 5-HT6 receptor, the localization of its mRNA in striatum, olfactory tubercle and nucleus accumbens suggests that some of the clinical actions of these compounds may be mediated through this receptor. Its ability to bind a wide range of therapeutic compounds used in psychiatry, coupled with its intriguing distribution in the brain has stimulated significant interest in new compounds which are capable of interacting with the said receptor (Sleight, AJ. et al. 5-HT4 and 5-HT7 receptors: molecular biology, functional correlates and possible therapeutic indications, Drug News Perspective. 1997, 10, 214 -224). Significant efforts are being made to understand the possible role of the 5-HT6 receptor in psychiatry, cognitive dysfunction, motor function and control, memory, mood and the like. The compounds which demonstrate a binding affinity for the 5-HT6 receptor are earnestly sought both as an aid in the study of the 5-HT6 receptor and as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of central nervous system disorders, for example see Reavill C. and Rogers D. C, Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs, 2001, 2(1): 104-109, Pharma Press Ltd.<br>
Monsma F.J. et al. (1993) and Kohen, R. et al. (2001) have shown that several tricyclic antidepressant compounds, such as amitriptyline and atypical antidepressant compounds, such as mianserin have high affinity for the 5-HT6 receptor. These findings have led to the hypothesis that the 5-HT6 receptor is involved in the pathogenesis and/or treatment of affective disorders. Rodent models of anxiety-related behaviour yield conflicting results about the role of the 5-HT6 receptor in anxiety. Treatment with 5-HT6 receptor antagonists increases seizure threshold in a rat maximal electroconvulsive-shock test [Stean, T. et al. Anticonvulsant properties of the selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist SB-271046 in the rat maximal electroshock seizure threshold test. British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 127, Proc.SuppIement-131P; Routledge, C. et al. Characterization of SB-271046: a potent, selective and orally active 5-HT6 receptor antagonist. British Journal of Pharmacology, 2000, 130, 1606-1612]. Although this indicates that 5-HT6 receptors might regulate seizure threshold, the effect is not as pronounced as that of known anticonvulsant drugs.<br>
Our understanding of the roles of 5-HT6 receptor ligands is most advanced in two therapeutic indications in which this receptor is likely to have a major role: learning and memory deficits and abnormal feeding behaviour. The exact role of the 5-HT6 receptor is yet to be established in other CNS indications<br>
 <br>
such as anxiety, although one 5-HT6 agonist has reached Phase I clinical trials recently. There are many potential therapeutic uses for 5-HT6 receptor ligands in humans based on direct effects and on indications from available scientific studies. These studies include the localization of the receptor, the affinity of ligands with known in-vivo activity and various animal studies conducted so far. Preferably, antagonist compounds of 5-HT6 receptors are sought after as therapeutic agents.<br>
One potential therapeutic use of modulators of 5-HT6 receptor functions is in the enhancement of cognition and memory in human diseases such as Alzheimer's. The high levels of receptor found in structures such as the forebrain, including the caudate/putamen, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and cortex suggests a role for the receptor in memory and cognition since these areas are known to play a vital role in memory (Gerard, C; Martres, M.P.; Lefevre, K.; Miquel, M. C; Verge, D.; Lanfumey, R.; Doucet, E.; Hamon, M.; EI Mestikawy, S., Brain Research, 1997, 746, 207-219). The ability of known 5-HT6 receptor ligands to enhance cholinergic transmission also supports the potential cognition use (Bentley, J. C; Boursson, A.; Boess, F. G.; Kone, F. C; Marsden, C. A.; Petit, N.; Sleight, A. J., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 126 (7), 1537-1542).<br>
Studies have found that a known 5-HT6 selective antagonist significantly increased glutamate and aspartate levels in the frontal cortex without elevating levels of noradrenaline, dopamine or 5-HT. This selective elevation of certain neurochemicals is noted during memory and cognition, strongly suggests a role for 5-HT6 ligands in cognition (Dawson, L. A.; Nguyen, H. Q.; Li, P. British Journal of Pharmacology, 2000, 130 (1), 23-26). Animal studies of memory and learning with a known selective 5-HT6 antagonist have some positive effects (Rogers, D. C; Hatcher, P. D.; Hagan, J. J. Society of Neuroscience, Abstracts, 2000, 26, 680).<br>
A related potential therapeutic use for 5-HT6 ligands is in the treatment of attention deficit disorders (ADD, also known as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD) in children as well as adults. As 5-HT6 antagonists appear to enhance the activity of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway and ADHD has been linked to abnormalities in the caudate (Ernst, M; Zametkin, A. J.; Matochik, J. H.; Jons, P. A.; Cohen, R. M, Journal of Neuroscience, 1998, 18(15), 5901-5907), 5-HT6 antagonists may attenuate attention deficit<br>
disorders.<br>
At present, a few fully selective agonists are available. The Wyeth agonist WAY-181187 is currently in Phase I trials to target anxiety [Cole, D.C. et al. (2005) Discovery of a potent, selective and orally active 5-HT6 receptor agonist, WAY-181187. 230th ACS Natl. Meet. (Aug 28-Sept 1, Washington DC), Abstract MEDI 17.]<br>
International Patent Publication WO 03/066056 Al reports that antagonism of 5-HT6 receptor could promote neuronal growth within the central nervous system of a mammal. Another International Patent Publication WO 03/065046 A2 discloses new variant of human 5-HT6 receptor and proposes that 5-HT6 receptor is associated with numerous other disorders.<br>
 <br>
Early studies examining the affinity of various CNS ligands with known therapeutic utility or a strong structural resemblance to known drugs suggests a role for 5-HT6 ligands in the treatment of schizophrenia and depression. For example, clozapine (an effective clinical antipsychotic) has high affinity for the 5-HT6 receptor subtype. Also, several clinical antidepressants have high affinity for the receptor as well and act as antagonists at this site (Branchek, T. A.; Blackburn, T. P., Annual Reviews in Pharmacology and Toxicology, 2000,40, 319-334).<br>
Further, recent in-vivo studies in rats indicate that 5-HT6 modulators may be useful in the treatment of movement disorders including epilepsy (Stean, T.; Routledge, C; Upton, N., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 127 Proc. Supplement-13 IP; and Routledge, C; Bromidge, S. M.; Moss, S. F.; Price, G. W.; Hirst, W.; Newman, H.; Riley, G.; Gager, T.; Stean, T.; Upton, N.; Clarke, S. E.; Brown, A. M,; British Journal of Pharmacology, 2000, 3 0 (7), 1606-1612).<br>
Taken together, the above studies strongly suggest that compounds which are 5-HT6 receptor modulators, i.e. ligands, may be useful for therapeutic indications including, the treatment of diseases associated with a deficit in memory, cognition and learning such as Alzheimer's and attention deficit disorder; the treatment of personality disorders such as schizophrenia; the treatment of behavioral disorders, e.g. anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorders; the treatment of motion or motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy; the treatment of diseases associated with neurodegeneration such as stroke or head trauma; or withdrawal from drug addiction including addiction to nicotine, alcohol and other substances of abuse.<br>
Such compounds are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as functional bowel disorder. See for example, Roth, B. L.; et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 1994, 268, 1403-1412; Sibley, D. R.; et al., Molecular Pharmacology, 1993, 43, 320-327, Sleight, A. J.; et al., Neurotransmission, 1995, 11, 1-5; and Sleight, A. J.; et al., Serotonin ID Research Alert, 1997, 2(3), 115-118.<br>
Furthermore, the effect of 5-HT6 antagonist and 5-HT6 antisense oligonucleotides to reduce food intake in rats has been reported, thus potentially in treatment of obesity. See for example, Bentley, J. C; Boursson, A.; Boess, F. G.; Kone, F. C; Marsden, C. A.; Petit, N.; Sleight, A. J., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 126 (7), 1537-1542); Wooley et al., Neuropharmacology, 2001, 41: 210-129 and WO 02/098878.<br>
A recent review by Holenz, Jo"rg etal., Drug Discovery Today, 11, 7/8, April 2006, Medicinal chemistry strategies to 5-HT6 receptor ligands as potential cognitive enhancers and antiobesity agents, gives elaborate discussion on evolution of 5-HT6 ligands. It had summarized pharmacological tools and preclinical candidates used in evaluation of 5-HT6 receptor in illnesses such as schizophrenia, other dopamine-related disorders and depression and to profile the neurochemical and electrophysiological effects of either blockade or activation of 5-HT6 receptors. Recently, a review by Heal D. J. et. al. Pharmacology and therapeutics, 2008, 117, 207-231, Selective 5-HT6 receptor ligands: Progress in the development of a novel pharmacological approach to the tratment of the obesity and related metabolic disorders, described<br>
 <br>
the major developments in the fields of medicinal chemistry and pharmacology of 5-HT6 ligands, with particular emphasis on their potential application as novel anti-obesity drugs. Furthermore, they have been used to characterize the 5-HT6 receptor and to investigate its distribution.<br>
Phase II antagonist candidate from GlaxoSmithKline, SB-742457 for the therapeutic indication of cognitive dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease [Ahmed, M. et al. (2003) Novel compounds. WO patent 2003080580] and the Lilly compound LY-483518 [Filla, S.A. et al. (2002) Preparation of benzenesulfonic acid indol-5-yl esters as antagonists of the 5-HT6 receptor, WO 2002060871] has been reported. SB-271046, the first 5-HT6 receptor antagonist to enter Phase I clinical development, has been discontinued (probably because of low penetration of the blood-brain barrier). In addition, the selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist SB-271046 is inactive in animal tests related to either positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia [Pouzet, B. et al. Effects of the 5-HT6 receptor antagonist, SB-271046, in animal models for schizophrenia. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 2002, 71, 635-643].<br>
International Patent Publications WO 2007/046112, WO 2007/020653, WO2007/138611, WO 2005/066157, WO 2004/108671, WO 2004/048331, WO 2004/048330 and WO 2004/048328 (ail assigned to Suven Life Sciences Limited) describe the related prior art. Further WO 98/27081, WO 99/02502, WO 99/37623, WO 99/42465 and WO 01/32646 (all assigned to Glaxo SmithKline Beecham PLC) disclose a series of aryl sulfonamide and sulfoxide compounds as 5-HT6 receptor antagonists and are claimed to be useful in the treatment of various CNS disorders. While some 5-HT6 modulators have been disclosed, there continues to be a need for compounds that are useful for modulating 5-HT6.

 <br>
The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" indicates that the substance or composition must be compatible chemically and/or toxicologically, with the other ingredients comprising a formulation, the mammal being treated therewith.<br>
"Therapeutically effective amount" is defined as 'an amount of a compound of the present invention that (i) treats or prevents the particular disease, condition or disorder (ii) attenuates, ameliorates or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition or disorder (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition or disorder described herein'.<br>
The terms "treating", "treat" or "treatment" embrace all the meanings such as preventative, prophylactic and palliative.<br>
The term "stereoisomers" is a general term for all isomers of the individual molecules that differ only in the orientation of their atoms in space. It includes mirror image isomers (enantiomers), geometric (cis-trans) isomers and isomers of compounds with more than one chiral centre that are not mirror images of one another (diastereomers).<br>
The term "ADHD" means Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.<br>
Certain compounds of formula (I) are capable of existing in stereoisomeric forms (e. g. diastereomers and enantiomers) and the invention extends to each of these stereoisomeric forms and to mixtures thereof including racemates. The different stereoisomeric forms may be separated from one another by the usual methods or any given isomer may be obtained by stereospecific or asymmetric synthesis. The invention also extends to tautomeric forms and mixtures thereof.<br>
The stereoisomers as a rule are generally obtained as racemates that can be separated into the optically active isomers in a manner known per se. In the case of the compounds of general formula (I) having an asymmetric carbon atom the present invention relates to the D-form, the L-form and D,L -mixtures and in the case of a number of asymmetric carbon atoms, the diastereomeric forms and the invention extends to each of these stereo isomeric forms and to mixtures thereof including racemates. Those compounds of general formula (I) which have an asymmetric carbon and as a rule are obtained as racemates can be separated one from the other by the usual methods, or any given isomer may be obtained by stereo specific or asymmetric synthesis. However, it is also possible to employ an optically active compound from the start, a correspondingly optically active enantiomeric or diastereomeric compound then being obtained as the final compound.<br>
The stereoisomers of compounds of general formula (I) may be prepared by one or more ways presented below:<br>
i)	One or more of the reagents may be used in their optically active form,<br>
ii)        Optically pure catalyst or chiral ligands along with metal catalyst may be employed in the reduction<br>
process. The metal catalyst may be Rhodium, Ruthenium, Indium and the like. The chiral ligands<br>
may preferably be chiral phosphines (Principles of Asymmetric synthesis, J. E. Baldwin Ed.,<br>
Tetrahedron series, 14, 311-316).<br>
 <br>
iii)        The mixture of stereoisomers may be resolved by conventional  methods  such   as forming diastereomeric salts with chiral acids or chiral amines or chiral amino alcohols, chiral amino acids. The resulting mixture of diastereomers may then be separated by methods such as fractional crystallization, chromatography and the like, which is followed by an additional step of isolating the optically active product by hydrolyzing the derivative (Jacques et. al., "Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolution", Wiley Interscience, 1981). iv)        The mixture of stereoisomers may be resolved by conventional methods such as microbial resolution, resolving the diastereomeric salts formed with chiral acids or chiral bases. Chiral acids that can be employed may be tartaric acid, mandelic acid, lactic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, amino acids and the like. Chiral bases that can be employed may be cinchona alkaloids, brucine or a basic amino acid such as lysine, arginine and the like. In the case of the compounds of general formula (I) containing geometric isomerism the present invention relates to all of these geometric isomers.<br>

The antagonist property of the compounds at the human 5-HT6 receptors was determined by testing their effect on cAMP accumulation in stably transfected HEK293 cells. Binding of an agonist to the human 5-HT6 receptor will lead to an increase in adenyl cyclase activity. A compound that is an agonist will show an increase in cAMP production and a compound that is an antagonist will block the agonist effect.<br>
Human 5-HT6 receptors were cloned and stably expressed in HEK293 cells. These cells were plated in 6 well plates in DMEM/F12 media with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 500 jxg/mL G418 and incubated at 37 °C in a C02 incubator. The cells were allowed to grow to about 70 % confluence before initiation of the experiment. On the day of the experiment, the culture media was removed and the cells were washed once with serum free medium (SFM). Two mL of SFM+IBMX media was added and incubated at 37 °C for 10 minutes. The media were removed and fresh SFM+IBMX media containing various compounds and 1 u.M serotonin (as antagonist) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes. Following incubation, the media were removed and the cells were washed once with 1 mL of PBS (phosphate buffered saline). Each well was treated with 1 mL cold 95% ethanol and 5 uM EDTA (2:1) at 4 °C for 1 hour. The cells were then scraped and transferred into Eppendorf tubes. The tubes were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4 °C and the supernatants were stored at 4 °C until assayed.<br>
cAMP content was determined by EIA (enzyme-immunoassay) using the Amersham Biotrak cAMP EIA kit (Amersham RPN 225). The procedure used is as described for the kit. Briefly, cAMP is determined by the competition between unlabeled cAMP and a fixed quantity of peroxidase-labelled cAMP for the binding sites on anti-cAMP antibody. The antibody is immobilized onto polystyrene microtitre wells precoated with a second antibody. The reaction is started by adding 50 u.L, peroxidase-labeled cAMP to the sample (100 uJL) pre-incubated with the antiserum (100 mL) for 2 hours at 4 °C. Following 1 hour incubation at 4 °C, the unbound ligand is separated by a simple washing procedure. Then an enzyme substrate, trimethylbenzidine (1), is added and incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes. The reaction<br>
 <br>
is stopped by the addition of 100 mL 1.0 M sulphuric acid and the resultant color read by a microtitre plate spectrophotometer at 450 nm within 30 minutes.<br>
In the functional adenylyl cyclase assay, some of the compound of this invention was found to be a competitive antagonist with good selectivity over a number of other receptors including other serotonin receptors such as 5-HTiA and 5-HT7. Example 56: Rodent Pharmacokinetic Study<br>

A day prior to study animals were transferred to home cages for acclimatization and implanted probe was perfused overnight with a modified Ringer's solution comprised of: 1.3 U.M CaC12 (Sigramsa), 1.0 uM MgCl2 (Sigramsa), 3.0 uM KC1 (Sigramsa), 147,0 uM NaCI (Sigramsa), 1.0 uM Na2HP04.7H20 and 0.2 uM NaH2P04.2 H20 and and 0.3 uM neostigramsine bromide (Sigramsa) (pH to 7.2) at a rate of 0.2 uL/minutes set by a microinfusion pump (PicoPlus, Harward). On the day of experiment perfusion rate was changed to 1.2 uL/minutes and allowed for 3 hours stabilization. After stabilization period, four basals were collected at 20 minutes intervals before dosing. Dialysate samples were collected in glass vials using CMA/170 refrigerated fraction collector.<br>
Vehicle or NCE (3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) was administered by gavages after four fractions had been collected. The perfusate was collected until 6 hours after administration.<br>
Acetylcholine concentrations in dialysate samples were measured by LC-MS/MS (API 4000, MDS SCIEX) method. Acetylcholine is quantified in the calibration range of 0.250 to 8.004 ng/mL in dialysates.<br>
On completion of the microdialysis experiments, the animals were sacrificed and their brains were removed and stored in a 10% formalin solution. Each brain was sliced at 50 u on a cryostat (Leica) stained and examined microscopically to confirm probe placement. Data from animals with incorrect probe placement were discarded.<br>
Microdialysis data were expressed as percent changes (Mean ± S.E.M.) of baseline that was defined as the average absolute value (in fM/10 u,L) of the four samples before drug administration.<br>
Effects of NCE (3 &amp; 10 mg/kg) and Vehicle treatments were statistically evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison tests. In all statistical measures, a p 
Male Wister rats (120-140 gm) obtained from N. I. N. (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) was used. The chronic effect of the compounds of general formula (I) on food intake in well-fed rats was then determined as follows.<br>
The rats were housed in single home cages for 28 days. During this period, the rats were either dosed orally or ip, with a composition comprising a compound of formula (1) or a corresponding composition (vehicle) without the said compound (control group), once a day, and the rat is provided with ad libitum food and water.<br>
On 0, 1st, 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th day the rats were left with the pre-weighed amounts of food. Food intake and weight gain were measured on a routine basis. Also a food ingestion method is disclosed in the literature (Kask et al., European Journal of Pharmacology, 414,2001,215-224 and Turnball et. al., Diabetes,<br>
 <br>
2002, 51, 2441-2449, and some in-house modifications.). The respective parts of the descriptions are herein incorporated as a reference and they form part of the disclosure.<br>
Some representative compounds have shown the statistically significant decrease in food intake, when conducted in the above manner at the doses of either 10 mg/Kg or 30 mg/Kg or both Example 60: Object Recognition Task Model<br>
The cognition-enhancing properties of compounds of this invention were estimated using a model of animal cognition: the object recognition task model.<br>
Male Wister rats (230 - 280 grams) obtained from N. I. N. (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) was used as experimental animals. Four animals were housed in each cage. Animals were kept on 20 % food deprivation before one day and given water ad libitum throughout the experiment and maintained on a 12 hours light/dark cycle. Also the rats were habituated to individual arenas for I hour in the absence of any objects.<br>
One group of 12 rats received vehicle (1 mL/Kg) orally and another set of animals received compound of the formula (I) either orally or i.p., before one hour of the familiar (Tl) and choice trial (T2).<br>
The experiment was carried out in a 50 x 50 x 50 cm open field made up of acrylic. In the familiarization phase, (Tl), the rats were placed individually in the open field for 3 minutes, in which two identical objects (plastic bottles, 12.5 cm height x 5.5 cm diameter) covered in yellow masking tape alone (al and a2) were positioned in two adjacent corners, 10 cm. from the walls. After 24 hours of the (Tl) trial for long-term memory test, the same rats were placed in the same arena as they were placed in Tl trial. Choice phase (T2) rats were allowed to explore the open field for 3 minutes in presence of one familiar object (a3) and one novel object (b) (Amber color glass bottle, 12 cm high and 5 cm in diameter). Familiar objects presented similar textures, colors and sizes. During the Tl and T2 trial, explorations of each object (defined as sniffing, licking, chewing or having moving vibrissae whilst directing the nose towards the object at a distance of less than 1 cm) were recorded separately by stopwatch. Sitting on an object was not regarded as exploratory activity, however, it was rarely observed.<br>
Tl is the total time spent exploring the familiar objects (al + a2).<br>
T2 is the total time spent exploring the familiar object and novel object (a3 +b).<br>
The object recognition test was performed as described by Ennaceur, A., Delacour, J., A new one-trial test for neurobiological studies of memory in rats - Behavioural data, Behav. Brain Res., 1988, 31, 47-59.<br>
Some representative compounds have shown positive effects indicating the increased novel object recognition viz; increased exploration time with novel object and higher discrimination index.<br>
 <br>

Example 61: Water Maze<br>
The water maze apparatus consisted of a circular pool (1.8 m diameter, 0.6 m high) constructed in black Perspex (TSE systems, Germany) filled with water (24 ± 2°C) and positioned underneath a wide-angled video camera to track animal. The 10 cm2 perspex platform, lying 1 cm below the water surface, was placed in the centre of one of the four imaginary quadrants, which remained constant for all rats. The black Perspex used in the construction of the maze and platform offered no intramaze cues to guide escape behavior. By contrast, the training room offered several strong extramaze visual cues to aid the formation of the spatial map necessary for escape learning. An automated tracking system, [Videomot 2 (5.51), TSE systems, Germany] was employed. This program analyzes video images acquired via a digital camera and an image acquisition boards that determined path length, swim speed and the number of entries and duration of swim time spent in each quadrant of the water maze.<br>
 <br>
Example 62: Chewing/Yawning/Stretching induction by 5-HT6 antagonists<br>
Male Wister rats weighing 200-250 grams were used. Rats were given vehicle injections and placed in individual, transparent chambers for 1 hour each day for 2 days before the test day, to habituate them to the observation chambers and testing procedure. On the test day, rats were placed in the observation chambers immediately after drug administration and observed continuously for yawning, stretching, and chewing behaviors from 60 to 90 minutes after drug or vehicle injections. 60 minutes prior to the drug administration Physostigramsine, 0.1 mg/kg i.p, was administered to all the animals. Average number of yawns, stretches and vacuous chewing movements during the 30 minutes observation period were recorded.<br>

Animals were trained in a single-trial, step through, and light-dark passive avoidance paradigrams. The training apparatus consisted of a chamber 300 mm in length, 260 mm wide, and 270 mm in height, constructed to established designs. The front and top were transparent, allowing the experimenter to observe the behaviour of the animal inside the apparatus. The chamber was divided into two compartments, separated by a central shutter that contained a small opening 50 mm wide and 75 mm high set close to the<br>
 <br>
front of the chamber. The smaller of the compartments measured 9 mm in width and contained a low-power (6V) illumination source. The larger compartment measured 210 mm in width and was not illuminated. The floor of this dark compartment consisted of a grid of 16 horizontal stainless-steel bars that were 5 mm in diameter and spaced 12.5 mm apart. A current generator supplied 0.75 mA to the grid floor, which was scrambled once every 0.5 seconds across the 16 bars. A resistance range of 40-60 micro ohms was calculated for a control group of rats and the apparatus was calibrated accordingly. An electronic circuit detecting the resistance of the animal ensured an accurate current delivery by automatic variation of the voltage with change in resistance. Experimental procedure:<br>
This was carried out as described previously. Adult male Wister rats weighing 200-230 grams were used. Animals were brought to the laboratory 1 hour before the experiment. On the day of training, animals were placed facing the rear of the light compartment of the apparatus. The timer was started once the animal has completely turned to face the front of the chamber. Latency to enter the dark chamber was recorded (usually
