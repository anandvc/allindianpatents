				<td>[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
This invention relates to a muffler structure for-in- a motorcycle and the like. <br>
[Prior Art]<br>
In general, although a muffler is installed at either an end part of or a rear end part of an exhaust pipe of a motorcycle and there is provided a mechanism for reducingengine noise or exhaust gas noise, as the rear structure of the muffler, there is provided one shown in Fig. 6 or the other shown in "Muffler of Internal Combustion Engine" described in the gazette of Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. Hei 1-Supply Indianequivalent<br>
Fig. 6 is a side elevational view of a prior art muffler. A muffler 100 is comprised of a main body 101 of the muffler communicated with an exhaust muffler and a tail pipe 102 communicated with the main body 101 of the muffler and extended in a rearward direction at its rear end (an extending part 102a). Since both exhaust gas and mixture gas^discharged from an exhaust port of a 2-cycle engine are released into said exhaust pipe, the tail pipe 102 releases both exhaust gas and mixture gas from an exhaust port of the extending part 102a. [0004 ] Supply Indianequivalent<br>
In turn, in the "Muffler of the Internal Combustion Engine" described in the gazette of Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. Hei 1-134722 is disclosed a technology in which a tail pipe 6 is projected from a rear end of a muffler cylinder<br>
S-.	'^<br>
1 (its reference number is cited from that described in this gazette, hereinafter similarly applied) and the projected tail pipe 6 is covered by a tail pipe 7. This tail pipe 7 has its length approximately the same as that of the projected tail pipe 6.<br>
 [Problem to be Solved by the Invention] The muffler shown in Fig. 6 has the following problem. That is, oil 103 of the mixture gas is adhered to a location near an exhaust port of an extending part 102a of the tail pipe 102, the adhered oil 103 runs around an outer circumference of the extending part 102a from the exhaust port of the extending part 102a and so either an outer circumference of the extending part 102a or the surface of the main body 101 of the muffler is stained with oil. <br>
In addition, the gazette of the Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. Hei l-134722shows the following problems. That<br>
is, when either the exhaust gas or mixture gas is released from the tail pipe 6, oil of the mixture gas dripped from the opening of the rear end of the tail pipe 6 runs around the outer circumference from the rear end opening of the tail pipe. With such an arrangement as above, the outer circumference of the tail pipe 7 or the surface of the muffler cylinder 1 is stained with oil. <br>
In view of this fact, it is an object of the present invention to provide a technology for preventing the muffler from being stained with oil.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
In order to resolve the aforesaid object, Claim 1 of<br>
The present invention relates to a muffler structure for a motorcycle comprising a cylindrical main body having a cylinder, a separator and a rear cap, and a tail pipe being fixed to the rear cap to discharge exhaust gas therefrom, characterized in that<br>
an outer cylinder is provided to cover said, tail pipe to make a double-pipe structure, the outer cylinder extends beyond an outer end of the tail pipe to receive oil dripped from the tail pipe, and the exhaust gas discharged from the tail pipe is blown against a predetermined location of the outer cylinder where the oil is received.<br>
The outer cylinder covering the tail pipe receives oil<br>
dripped from the tail pipe at an inner circumference of the outer cylinder. Then, exhaust gas released from the tail pipe is blown against a predetermined location of the outer cylinder receiving this oil. Accordingly/ the oil dripped at the predetermined location of the outer cylinder is blown off with the exhaust gas to enable the oil to be prevented from being run around the outer circumference of the outer cylinder.<br>
Claim 2 is characterized in that an axis of said outer cylinder and an axis of the tail pipe are crossed to each other.<br>
Since the axis of the outer cylinder and the axis of the tail pipe are crossed to each other, exhaust gas released from the tail pipe can be blown against the oil dripping position of the outer cylinder. Accordingly, oil dripped onto the outer cylinder can be blown off with the exhaust gas.<br>
Claim 3 is characterized in that said outer cylinder<br>
is opened with a hole for preventing resonance.<br>
Opening of the hole in the outer cylinder causes the exhaust sound generated within the outer cylinder to be released to the outside part of the outer cylinder through the hole, so that it is possible to prevent the exhaust sound from being resonated within the outer cylinder..<br>

[Fig. 6]<br>
This is a side elevational view for showing a prior art muffler.[Preferred Embodiment of the Invention]<br>
Referring now to the accompanying drawings, one preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described as follows. The drawings should be seen in the orientation of the reference numerals.<br>
Fig. 1 is a side elevational view of a scooter type motorcycle having a muffler structure of the present invention. The scooter type auto-bicycle 1 is comprised of a frame 2, a body cover 10 covering the body frame 2, a front wheel 25, a rear wheel 27, a power unit 30 for supporting the rear wheel 27 and a muffler structure 35 fixed to the power unit 30. The muffler structure 35 will be described in detail in reference to Figs. 2 to 5.<br>
Reference numeral 9a denotes a seat. <br>
The body frame 2 is comprised of a head pipe 3, a front fork 4 supported at the head pipe 3 in such a way that it may be steered, a handle 5 connected to the front fork 4, a down tube 6 extending downwardly from the head pipe 3, and a rear<br>
frame 7 cooperatively arranged at a rear part from the lower end of the down tube 6 .<br>
In this case, the front wheel 25 is mounted at the lower end of the front fork 4 .<br>
The rear frame 7 has a substantial ellipse shape as seen from its top plan view and is comprised of a pair of right and left front frames 7a (only one of them is shown) extending from the rear end of the down tube 6 in a rearward direction, a pair of right and left intermediate frames 7b (only one of them is shown) extending from the rear part of these front frames 7a in a rearward and upward direction and a rear frame 7c connecting the rear ends of these intermediate frames 7b. <br>
The body cover 10 is comprised of a front cover 11 for covering a front part of the head pipe 3, a leg shield 12 for covering a leg front part of a driver, a floor panel 13 for supporting feet parts of the driver and a rear fender 16 installed at a rear upper part of the body frame 2 . Reference numeral 17 denotes a front fender installed at the upper part of the front wheel 25. <br>
The power unit 30 is comprised of a 2-cycle forced air-cooled engine 31 and a continuously variable transmission (only a transmission case 32 is shown) for transmitting an output of the 2-cycle forced air-cooled engine 31 to the rear<br>
wheel 27.<br>
Reference numeral 33 denotes a rear suspension and reference numeral 34 denotes a fuel tank.<br>
Fig. 2 is a side elevational view for showing a muffler structure of the present invention.<br>
To the exhaust port of the 2-cycle forced air-cooled engine 31 is connected a muffler structure 35 through an exhaust pipe 36. This muffler structure 35 is comprised of a cylindrical muffler main body 37, a tail pipe 43 and an outer cylinder 45. <br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view for showing a rear part of the muffler structure of the present invention.<br>
The tail pipe 43 is extended at its rear end (extending part) 43a from the rear end of the muffler main body 37 in a rearward direction.<br>
The outer cylinder 45 is applied to cover the extended part 43a extended from the muffler main body 37 and is comprised of an oil receptacle 45a extending from the extended part 43a in a further rearward direction and a resonant preventing hole 45c opened at a base end 45b. In addition, it is preferable that the resonant prevention hole 45c is opened in a slant upward direction from the vehicle body along an orientation line 1 shown in the right end in the figure. With such an arrangement as above, the resonant prevention hole 45c is<br>
hardly seen from the outside part and this is preferable in its aesthetic point of view.<br>
Fig. 4 is a sectional view for showing a rear part of the muffler structure of the present invention.<br>
The muffler main body 37 is comprised of a cylinder 38, a separator 39 and a rear cap 40, wherein a tail cap 43 is fixed to the separator 39 and the rear cap 40 in such a way that it shows a predetermined slant angle. In addition, when an axis of the tail pipe 43 is defined as Ll and an axis of the outer cylinder 45 is defined as L2, the outer cylinder 45 is lifted up in such a way that Ll and L2 are crossed at an angle 9 . With such an arrangement as above, it becomes possible to blow off the exhaust gas 51 (see Fig. 6(b)) released from the extending part 43a of the tail pipe 43 against the oil receptacle 45a.<br>
Reference numeral 47 denotes an inner pipe. <br>
Action of the muffler structure of the present invention described above will be described as follows.<br>
Figs. 5(a) and (b) are illustrations for showing an action of the muffler structure of the present invention.<br>
(a) shows an idling state of the 2-cycle engine. A back pressure at the 2-cycle engine is decreased and a blowing-off power of exhaust gas 51 released from the extending part 43a of the tail pipe 43 is reduced. 2-cycle engine discharges<br>
the mixture gas together with the exhaust gas 51, so that the oil 50 in the mixture gas drips from the extending part 43a and then the oil is accumulated in the oil receptacle 45a of the outer cylinder 45.<br>
In turn, the exhaust noise generated in the outer cylinder 45 is released from the resonance prevention hole 45c to an external area to prevent resonance of the exhaust sound. <br>
(b) shows a running state, wherein a back-pressure of the 2-cycle engine is increased and a blowing-of force of the exhaust gas 51 discharged from the extending part 43a of the tail pipe 43 is increased. At this time, since the exhaust gas 51 is blown against the oil receptacle 45a, the oil 50 accumulated at the oil receptacle 45a is blown off by the exhaust gas 51 to an outside part of the outer cylinder 45. With such an arrangement as above, the outer circumference of the outer cylinder 45 or the muffler main body 37 is prevented from being stained with the oil 50 accumulated at the oil receptacle 45a.<br>
In addition, similar to (a) above, exhaust sound generated in the outer cylinder 45 is released from the resonant prevention hole 45c to an outer area to prevent a resonant of the exhaust sound. <br>
In addition, in the aforesaid preferred embodiment, the muffler structure fixed to the 2-cycle engine has been<br>
described, although the muffler structure of the present invention can be widely employed in an internal combustion engine of a vehicle.<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
The present invention has been constructed as described above and has the following effects.<br>
In claim 1, the outer cylinder covering the tail pipe receives the oil dripped from the tail pipe at an inner circumference of the outer cylinder. Then, the exhaust gas released from the tail pipe is blown against a predetermined location of the outer cylinder receiving the oil . Accordingly, the oil dripped at the predetermined location at the outer cylinder is blown off with the exhaust gas and then the oil dripped at the inner circumference of the outer cylinder can be prevented from running around the outer circumference of the outer cylinder. With such an arrangement as above, it is possible to prevent the outer circumference of the outer cylinder or the muffler main body from being stained with oil. <br>
In claim 2, the axis of the outer cylinder and the axis of the tail pipe are crossed to each other, so that it is possible to blow off the exhaust gas released from the tail pipe against the oil dripping position of the outer cylinder. Accordingly, it is possible to blow off the oil dripped at the outer cylinder with the exhaust gas. With such an arrangement as above, it<br>
is possible to prevent the outer circumference of the outer cylinder or the muffler main body from being stained with oil.<br>
In claim 3, the outer cylinder is formed with a hole to cause the exhaust sound generated in the outer cylinder to release outside the outer cylinder, so that it is possible to prevent exhaust gas from producing resonant in the outer cylinder.<br>
