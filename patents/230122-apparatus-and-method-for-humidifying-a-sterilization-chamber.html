				<td>AN OZONE STERILIZATION METHOD, INVOLVING HUMIDIFYING AN<br>
ATMOSPHERE IN A STERILIZATION CHAMBER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for humidifying an atmosphere in a<br>
sterilization chamber in a sterilization process and in particular to such method and apparatus using<br>
humidified ozone as the sterilant or sterilizing agent.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Sterilization is the destruction of any virus, bacteria, fungus or other micro-organism, whether<br>
in a vegetative or in a dormant spore state. Conventional sterilization processes for medical<br>
instruments have involved high temperatures (such as steam and dry heat units) or toxic chemicals<br>
(such as ethylene oxide gas, EtO). Steam sterilization with an autoclave has been the time-honoured<br>
method of sterilization. It is fast and cost effective. However, the autoclave destroys heat-sensitive<br>
instruments. Thus, since more and more heat-sensitive instruments such as arthroscopes and<br>
endoscope are used in medical treatment, other types of sterilization are needed, especially cold<br>
sterilization.<br>
Ethylene oxide may be used to cold sterilize heat-sensitive instruments. However, it has now<br>
been deemed by national health and safety organizations to be carcinogenic and neurotoxic. It also<br>
poses flammability problems and is thus usually used in combination with chlorofluorocarbons<br>
(CFC's) which themselves are now undesirable. Further, sterilization with ethylene oxide takes 14<br>
to 36 hours.<br>
A more efficient, safer, and less expensive sterilization agent is ozone (O3). Ozone, especially<br>
humidified ozone, is a sterilizing gas. Ozone can be easily generated from oxygen, especially<br>
hospital grade oxygen. Oxygen is readily available in the hospital environment, usually<br>
from a wall or ceiling oxygen source, or, if mobility is required, from a portable "J" cylinder<br>
of oxygen. Ozone is widely used in industry as an oxidising agent to bleach paper pulp,<br>
treat drinking water, and sterilize sewage water and food products. The amounts (concentrations)<br>
of ozone required in the sterilization gas for water purification are low, generally less than<br>
40 mg/1 (milligram per litre). However, higher concentrations, combined<br><br>
with critical humidity levels, are required to make ozone an effective sterilant of micro-<br>
organisms. Those high concentrations of ozone gas have to be combined with critical levels<br>
of humidity. The sterilization efficiency of ozone increases rapidly with increased relative<br>
humidity. A high relative humidity is required for ozone to penetrate the protective shells of<br>
micro-organisms. The presence of water vapour will also accelerate ozone reactions with<br>
organic substances. Sufficient relative humidity further helps the penetration of sterilization<br>
packaging by ozone.<br>
Sterilization with ozone is more efficient and quicker than with EtO and requires few<br>
changes in user habits. Moreover, ozone-based processes are compatible for use with current<br>
packaging, such as sterile pouches and rigid containers.<br>
Ozone sterilization requires substantially no aeration or cooling down of sterilized<br>
instruments which can be used immediately following sterilization. This allows hospitals to<br>
reduce the cost of maintaining expensive medical device inventories. Ozone sterilization<br>
offers several other advantages. It produces no toxic waste, does not require the handling of<br>
dangerous gas cylinders, and poses no threat to the environment or the user's health. Stainless-<br>
steel instruments and heat-sensitive instruments can be treated simultaneously, which for<br>
some users will obviate the need for two separate sterilizers.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,719,017 discloses the use of a mixture of ozone gas with a very fine<br>
water mist in a sealed plastic bag container which contains an article to be sterilized. The<br>
method involves repeated evacuation and refilling of the plastic bag with a mixture of ozone<br>
gas and a very fine water mist. The air in the bag is exhausted and replaced with a pressurised<br>
mixture of ozone and water mist. Upon encountering the much lower pressure within the bag,<br>
the water particles from the pressurised mixture explode, forming a water mist. However, this<br>
system cannot generate a sufficiently high water vapour concentration to provide the high<br>
relative humidity required for thorough sterilization (at least 85% relative humidity).<br>
U.S. PatentNo. 5,069,880 describes a device capable of generating a relative humidity<br>
of 85%. In the apparatus the ozone is bubbled through a water bath to increase the water<br>
content of the gas. Although ozone at 85% humidity can kill most micro-organisms, it does<br>
not meet the "worst case scenario" stipulated in North American standards. Moreover, the<br><br>
device is unable to generate humidity levels higher than 85%. In addition, injecting ozone<br>
while humidifying the chamber increases the contact time of the ozone with the instruments<br>
to be sterilized, which may result in oxidation damage to the instruments.<br>
A minimum relative humidity level of 90% (95% + 5%) is required to meet North<br>
American standards set by agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and Health<br>
Canada.<br>
Water evaporates at 100°C at atmospheric pressure (1013 mbar or 760 Torr). Thus,<br>
various priorpatents (see Faddis et al., U.S. Patents No. 5,266,275; 5,334,355; and 5,334,622)<br>
teach sterilization systems wherein water is heated to above the boiling point to evaporate the<br>
water for injection into the ozone-containing gas produced by an ozone generator. The steam<br>
is heated to 120°C. Thus, the vapour upon injection into the ozone-containing gas will have<br>
a temperature close to 100°C. However, since the decomposition of ozone increases<br>
exponentially with temperature in the range of 20 to 300°C, injecting the water vapour at a<br>
temperature of about 120°C leads to premature ozone decomposition. As a result, the<br>
effective ozone concentration in the gas produced by the ozone generator is reduced, thereby<br>
requiring significantly increased treatment times and the generation of larger amounts of<br>
ozone gas for each sterilization cycle. Thus, a more efficient and effective sterilization<br>
apparatus is desired for the sterilization of ozone at arelative humidity of above at least 90%.<br>
U.S. Patent Application Serial No.10/005,786 (filed on November 8, 2001 which is<br>
a continuation-in-part application of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/310,695 which was<br>
filed on May 12, 1999 and is now abandoned), which is hereby incorporated by reference,<br>
addresses these problems by applying a vacuum pressure to lower the boiling point of water<br>
below the temperature inside the sterilization chamber. Thus the teachings of this application<br>
provide an effective sterilization process.<br>
As taught in this prior application, it is preferred to repeat the sterilization cycle at<br>
least once to give greater assurance of effective sterilization. Thus, after loading the<br>
sterilization chamber with the articles to be sterilized (such as medical instruments), a<br>
sterilization cycle includes exposing the articles to the humidified ozone sterilant and then<br>
removing the sterilant. Repeating this cycle thus includes exposing the articles again to<br><br>
humidified ozone sterilant and removing the sterilant.<br>
However, as mentioned above, in order to be sure of sterilization using ozone, the<br>
humidity should be at least 90% (95% ± 5%). Consistently achieving such high humidity<br>
levels has proved difficult. The sterilization chamber is in communication with a source of<br>
water vapour, for example, a water reservoir. As taught in US Patent Application Serial No.<br>
10/005,786 mentioned above, a reduction in pressure will cause water in the reservoir to<br>
evaporate. However, this evaporation leads to cooling of the reservoir. Also, condensation of<br>
water vapour in the chamber tends to heat the chamber.<br>
Any increase in the chamber temperature increases the quantity of water vapour<br>
required to reach the target humidity. Attempts to speed the process involve large thermal<br>
energy inputs, for example excessive heating of the water reservoir. This thermal energy<br>
eventually reaches the chamber and results in a temperature increase in the chamber which<br>
increases the quantity of water vapour needed for a given relative humidity. Thus achieving<br>
a high relative humidity with the consistency and accuracy needed to ensure complete<br>
sterilization is challenging.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been found that effecting the humidification in a plurality of graduated<br>
steps or stages can provide a consistent and accurate way to reach a particular value of relative<br>
humidity, especially high relative humidity values such as those required for ozone<br>
sterilization.<br>

and disconnecting said fluid communication after said preselected exposure time; and repeating at<br>
least steps b) and c) a plurality of times, wherein at least one of the amount of water and the exposure<br>
time are controlled such that the relative humidity in the chamber progressively increases with each<br>

atmosphere Tc; (b) reducing a pressure in the chamber to a value below the boiling point of water<br>
at the reservoir temperature Ts; (c) bringing the reservoir into fluid communication with the<br>

exposure time ;and repeating at least steps (b) and (c) a plurality of times, wherein at least one of the<br>
amount of water and the exposure time are controlled such that the relative humidity in the chamber<br>
progressively increases with each repetition until the target humidity is reached, and after reaching<br>
the target relative humidity, injecting ozone, as a sterilizing agent, into the chamber.<br>

method for humidifying a sterilization chamber to a target relative humidity prior to injecting ozone<br>
as a sterilizing agent, the method comprising a plurality of humidification stages Sx	Sn wherein x<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Preferably the source of water vapour is a reservoir of water in a humidifier chamber or<br>
humidifier unit. The temperature of the water vapour source or the water in the reservoir may be<br>
represented as Ts. The temperature of the space to be humidified or the sterilization<br><br>
chamber may be represented by Tc. Preferably there is at least one heating means for each of<br>
the sterilization chamber and the reservoir. Such heating means may be referred to as a first<br>
and second heating means. Preferably the reservoir water is at the same temperature as or a<br>
higher temperature than the temperature of the sterilization chamber, that is, Ts ≥ Tc. The<br>
difference in temperatures may be expressed as ∆T (deltaT) so that Ts - Tc = ∆T and thus ∆T<br>
≥ 0. Preferably the temperature difference AT is from 0 to 10°C, more preferably from 0 to<br>
7 °C and particularly from 0 to 3 °C. Maintaining the reservoir water at a higher temperature<br>
encourages evaporation of water vapour and encourages the vapour to flow to the sterilization<br>
chamber and discourages loss of humidity from the sterilization chamber by recondensation<br>
in the reservoir.<br>
The number of stages to be used to complete the humidification, or to achieve the<br>
target relative humidity, is widely variable. A large number of stages could be used. Selection<br>
of the number of stages will depend on the accuracy of the equipment used and a preference<br>
to complete the humidification as quickly as possible without adversely affecting the ability<br>
to accurately obtain the desired relative humidity. Thus, out of convenience, humidification<br>
would preferably be achieved in less than 50 stages, more preferably from 3 to 30, or from 5<br>
to 27.<br>
In a presently preferred embodiment, a processor is programmed with information<br>
corresponding to 27 stages (shown hereafter in Table 1) although the last 10 to 15 stages are<br>
included in case the sterilization chamber temperature Tc increases beyond the preferred<br>
temperature (thus requiring a higher water vapour pressure to achieve the same value of<br>
relative humidity) but they are not always required. Similarly, depending on the<br>
circumstances, it is sometimes possible to achieve up to 60%, or even up to 80% of the target<br>
Relative Humidity in a first stage, so that in the 27 stages (shown hereafter in Table 1), the<br>
first few stages, preferably up to 5 stages (which in a preferred embodiment would correspond<br>
toa water vapour pressure of 112 x 1/4 Torr) may be combined into a first single stage. It is<br>
preferred to reach a water vapour pressure of about 80 x 1/4 Torr in a first stage.<br>
If it is attempted to proceed too quickly or in too few stages, condensation will tend<br>
to occur in the sterilization chamber which will increase the chamber temperature which will<br><br>
in turn impose a need for a greater amount of water vapour to reach the target relative<br>
humidity. Such an unfavourable sequence can become out of control so that the target relative<br>
humidity cannot be reached. Thus it is preferred to take at least 5 to 10 stages, preferably 10<br>
or more, to reach the target relative humidity.<br>
Even more care should be taken in the later stages to allow the system to stabilize.<br>
Thus it is preferred that at least the last 10 stages, preferably the last 5 stages, particularly the<br>
last 3 stages should be effected in such a way that the increase in water vapour pressure<br>
achieved in the sterilization chamber is in a small increment for each stage, for example from<br>
0.1 to 5 Torr, preferably 0.1 to 3 Torr and particularly from 0.25 to 1 Torr. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the last 10 or more stages are pressure increments of about 0.5 to 1 Torr.<br>
The humidification thus should proceed in graduated stages, preferably in fairly<br>
discrete stages. Thus in a.given stage, after reducing the pressure in the water reservoir (for<br>
example, by evacuating the sterilization chamber and opening a valve to put the reservoir and<br>
sterilization chamber in fluid communication) the boiling point of the water in the reservoir<br>
will be reduced below the actual temperature of the water, thus the water will boil, water<br>
vapour will be formed and can thus travel or flow to the sterilization chamber. The<br>
evaporation will cause the temperature of the water reservoir to drop. It is thus necessary to<br>
heat the reservoir to return the temperature Ts back to or above the chamber temperature Tc.<br>
During this re-heating, it is preferred to close the valve in the conduit joining the chamber to<br>
the reservoir. Thus the reheating becomes a preparation for the next stage. Thus the valve is<br>
closed, disconnecting the reservoir or water vapour source from the chamber for a time<br>
sufficient to adjust either the chamber temperature, or preferably the reservoir temperature,<br>
to return Ts to the preferred value of Tc or above.<br>
In order to better control the stages, it is preferred that there is a temperature sensing<br>
means to monitor the temperature of the water in the reservoir. A temperature sensing means<br>
is also preferred to monitor the chamber temperature.Thus if the chamber temperature sensing<br>
means is referred to as a first temperature sensing means, then the reservoir temperature<br>
sensing means may be referred to as a second temperature sensing means or temperature<br>
sensing device. A suitable device is a Resistance Temperature Dependent sensor (RTD) such<br><br>
as a class B type sensor commercially available from Omega Temperature. This type of<br>
device has a resolution of 100 degrees, a standard deviation of 0.003 85 and a tolerance of 0.3<br>
degrees which means mat it can measure a temperature to an accuracy of within about ±015<br>
degrees. The temperature sensing means are preferably connected to a processor, computer<br>
or programmable logic controller so that the temperature data can be fed to the processor. The<br>
RTD provides temperature measurements to a processor which can adjust the heating<br>
accordingly, by means of a Proportional Integral Differential (PID) function of the<br>
Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). The heating means are connected so as to be under<br>
control of the processor. Thus by also providing pressure sensing means to monitor the<br>
pressure in the chamber, and connecting this also to the processor, the humidification stages<br>
can be automated. The processor may be programmed with a table of target values of<br>
temperatures, pressures and times, and instructed to proceed with the humidification<br>
according to a pre-programmed sequence in accordance with the table.<br>
As mentioned above, condensation in the chamber will tend to increase the chamber<br>
temperature and will run the risk of losing control of the humidification. Therefore, the<br>
number of stages and the corresponding water vapour pressure values are selected to reduce<br>
the risk of condensation of water vapour in the sterilization chamber, preferably to avoid<br>
substantially any condensation in the chamber.<br>
In the preferred use of the stage-wise humidification in a humidified ozone<br>
sterilization process, the process would normally additionally include other steps such as<br>
placing a load of instruments to be sterilized into a sterilization chamber and injecting ozone<br>
into the chamber.<br>
As can be seen from Figures 1 and 2, the process can be regarded as including six or<br>
seven basic steps, some of which may be repeated in a second sterilization cycle.<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a sterilization process according to the<br>
invention, showing the steps of the process in sequence. Figure 2 is another representation of<br>
a process according to the invention. Figure 2 illustrates the process by showing the various<br>
steps as a function of the pressure. Thus the vertical axis shows the pressure, with atmospheric<br>
pressure represented at the top end of the vertical axis and zero pressure (or complete vacuum)<br><br>
at the bottom end of the vertical axis. The horizontal axis represents the sequence of steps in<br>
the process from left to right and thus corresponds to elapsed time, although not necessarily<br>
to any scale, but only for the purpose of illustration.<br>
Since the present invention is mainly concerned with the humidification step, it will<br>
be understood that details of other process steps are in the nature of preferred features which<br>
are not essential to the broadest aspects of the invention.<br>
As shown in Figures 1 and 2, preferably the sterilization is preceded by a conditioning<br>
step, indicated as step 100A. This step may also be referred to as a pre-conditioning step. In<br>
this step, after inserting the articles to be sterilized in a sterilization chamber, the chamber is<br>
sealed.<br>
Generally, it is preferred to effect the sterilization at a target temperature in the range<br>
of from about 25 to 40°C, more preferably from about 30 to 36°C and especially at around<br>
30°C, for example at 30.8°C. The walls of the chamber are preferably maintained at around<br>
this sterilization temperature. Since this is above usual room temperature, it is preferred to<br>
successively fill and empty the chamber, with ambient air, in a succession of pulses. This<br>
pulsing helps stabilize the conditions in the chamber and helps bring any load (instruments<br>
to be sterilized) to the preferred chamber temperature. This is represented by the peaks and<br>
troughs shown in Figure 2 in the left-hand portion of the graph indicated as 100A, which<br>
represents the pre-conditioning step. The peaks represent a pressure of around atmospheric<br>
pressure and thus represent at least partially filling the chamber with ambient air. The troughs<br>
represent reduced pressure or evacuations of the chamber. Room temperature is usually<br>
around 18 to 22° C so to reach a target temperature of, for example, 30 °C, the air must be<br>
heated. The walls of the sterilization chamber are preferably heated. Thus by pulsing a<br>
quantity of air into and out of the chamber, the temperature of the air and the temperature of<br>
the load (any instruments in the chamber for sterilization), approaches the target chamber<br>
temperature of around 30°C. Generally it is preferred that a reduced pressure in the range of<br>
from about 350 to about 450 Torr, more preferably about 250 Torr, is used to evacuate the<br>
chamber in each of the evacuation pulses in this pre-conditioning step. It is preferred that the<br>
ambient air load is pulsed from 7 to 16 times, more preferably ten times. However, the<br><br>
number of such pulses may be increased or decreased to bring the load of ambient air to a<br>
satisfactory temperature.<br>
Any inert gas may be used as the gas in the pre-conditioning step. The choice of gas<br>
will be governed by costs or by consideration of whether it will interfere with the sterilant in<br>
the subsequent sterilization steps. In later steps, it is preferred to avoid using air since the<br>
nitrogen which it contains may form harmful substances, such as nitrogen oxides as a result<br>
of the powerful oxidizing capacity of ozone. Such nitrogen oxides may then form traces of<br>
nitric acids with any water vapour and may thus damage parts, such as metal parts, of articles<br>
to be sterilized. However, in this pre-conditioning step, air can be used, although oxygen<br>
would be preferred.<br>
The next step is the vacuum step and is indicated as 101 in Figures 1 and 2. In this<br>
step, gaseous contents of the sterilization chamber are evacuated. It is preferred to use a deep<br>
vacuum, generally in the range of from about 5 to 0.5 Torr, more preferably about 2.5 to 0.5<br>
Torr, more particularly, less than 1.25 Torr to remove as much of the gaseous contents as<br>
possible. It is preferred to apply this pressure for a time in the range of from about 30 seconds<br>
to 5 minutes, more preferably about a minute to allow the pressure to stabilize within the<br>
chamber, especially considering that the articles to be sterilized may well include containers<br>
and pouches.<br>
The next step is the humidification step and is indicated as 102 in Figures 1 and 2.<br>
This step is to provide the sterilization chamber with the humidity required for sterilization.<br>
Water from a water reservoir is evaporated and introduced into the chamber as water vapour<br>
until the relative humidity is equal to or above the target value. It is preferred that the relative<br>
humidity during sterilization is at least above 90%, preferably 95% or higher. It is preferred<br>
that after the target humidity is reached, conditions are maintained to stabilize and equilibrate<br>
the conditions throughout the chamber and the articles in the chamber. Preferably conditions<br>
are maintained for a time in the range of from about 10 to 50 minutes, more preferably for at<br>
least 30 minutes.<br>
Relative humidity is a percentage and represents the water vapour present as a<br>
percentage of the theoretical maximum water vapour possible at a given temperature. Thus<br>
a relative humidity of 100% represents the theoretical maximum water vapour pressure at a<br><br>
given temperature. Since warm air holds more water than cool air, an increase in temperature<br>
requires an increase in water vapour to maintain 100% relative humidification.<br>
The humidification step or humidification phase is a complex process achieved by<br>
graduated steps or increments.<br>
The means of humidification, or humidifier, includes a source of water, preferably<br>
contained as a reservoir, to provide the water vapour for humidification. In one embodiment<br>
the source of water is provided by a cylinder in which there is a known volume of water (in<br>
a process using a 125 liter sterilization chamber, a volume of 500 mls or less is preferred, in<br>
particular, a volume of about 300 mls ± 10 mls) which is sufficient to provide the required<br>
relative humidity under the process conditions.<br>
The water in the water reservoir is preferably heated to a temperature which is equal<br>
to or above the temperature of the sterilization chamber. If the temperature of the water<br>
reservoir is less than the chamber, then as the humidification progresses, a point will be<br>
reached where no more water will evaporate from the reservoir even though the target relative<br>
humidity has not been reached. A lower temperature in the reservoir will thus function as a<br>
"cold spot" which encourages condensation rather than evaporation.<br>
The water reservoir or source, is in fluid communication with the sterilizing chamber<br>
by means of a conduit which may be referred to as a water vapour diffuser. The conduit<br>
preferably includes a valve by which fluid communication between the chamber and the<br>
source can be disconnected in an "off position or re-connected in an "on" position.<br>
Preferably, this conduit, or water vapour diffuser, is also kept at a temperature above the<br>
temperature of the chamber. The temperature of the water vapour diffuser is also preferably<br>
monitored, by a sensor such as an RTD sensor described above, and the measured temperature<br>
information sent to a processor so that appropriate heating adjustments may be made to<br>
maintain a desired temperature. Preferably, the water vapour diffuser is maintained at about<br>
3°C (± 0.5°C) above the temperature of the water source.<br>
Since the water source is also usually kept above the temperature of the chamber<br>
during the humidification step, this means that the water vapour diffuser may often be some<br>
7 or 8°C higher that the chamber.<br><br>
Before starting the humidification stage, the water source is heated to a temperature<br>
corresponding to the average temperature of the sterilization chamber. As mentioned above,<br>
a preferred sterilization chamber temperature is around 30.8°C.<br>
Just before the HS (humidification step) a vacuum is applied to the sterilization<br>
chamber to reduce the pressure in the chamber, preferably to about 5/4 Torr. At this pressure,<br>
the boiling point of water is -15°C. Thus, if the water source or reservoir is at or above the<br>
preferred chamber temperature of 30.8°C, when the valve in the water vapour diffuser is<br>
opened, the water source will be in fluid communication with the sterilization chamber and<br>
water will evaporate from the reservoir and enter the sterilization chamber.<br>
As mentioned above, in order to consistently and precisely obtain a particular relative<br>
humidification valve, especially the high values of 90% or higher, which are preferred (and<br>
sometimes required) for efficient ozone sterilization, there are many difficulties to overcome.<br>
When the water reservoir, which is at a temperature of , for example, 30.8°C is<br>
exposed to the low pressure of the chamber at for example, 5/4 Torr, by means of opening the<br>
valve, water will immediately evaporate and the resulting water vapour will enter the<br>
sterilization chamber. However, the evaporation has a cooling effect which will also lower the<br>
temperature of the water source.<br>
In practice, at the start of the humidification step, when the valve is opened, although<br>
water vapour enters the sterilization chamber, the quantity of water vapour which enters the<br>
chamber is insufficient to produce a high relative humidity especially the relative humidity<br>
values at or above 90% which are required for ozone sterilization. Further, in practice, the<br>
Sterilization chamber has "cold spots". These are locations within the chamber which are at<br>
a lower temperature than the average chamber temperature or lower that the target<br>
temperature. Such "cold spots" may be provided by components of the load (the medical<br>
instruments to be sterilized) within the Sterilization chamber which may not have reached the<br>
target temperature, or they may be provided by structural limitations of the chamber itself<br>
(such as supporting members to support the configuration of the chamber which members<br>
cannot be directly heated, but only heated indirectly from the other chamber components).<br>
Such "cold spots" may induce some condensation. Any condensation in the chamber will tend<br><br>
to increase the temperature of the chamber (because of the thermal energy emitted by the<br>
condensation process). Any increase in chamber temperature will increase the water vapour<br>
needed to reach the desired relative humidification. Further, in some systems, the chamber<br>
may not be provided with any cooling means and thus quickly reducing the temperature to the<br>
preferred target temperature value, may not be possible. Further, simply continuing to heat<br>
the water source to obtain the desired water vapour content will tend to exacerbate any<br>
problems such as those caused by condensation on "cold spots".<br>
According to the invention the humidification preferably proceeds in a number of<br>
graduated steps which may be indicated as a series S1, S2, S3 ... Sn in which n indicates the<br>
number of steps. Thus an intermediate step in this series may be represented as Sx in which<br>
x is the number of the step between 1 and n. For each of the steps there is a corresponding<br>
water vapour pressure h, h2 ...hn, which represents a target water vapour pressure value for the<br>
corresponding stage. Thus an intermediate step Sx would have a corresponding water vapour<br>
pressure value hx.<br>
If both the temperature of the chamber and the water vapour pressure in the chamber<br>
are known, then the relative humidity may be calculated. At a temperature of 30.8°C, for<br>
100% relative humidity, the water vapour pressure is 34 Torr.<br>
As mentioned above, it is preferred that the temperature of the water source is kept<br>
above the chamber temperature. This temperature differential (being the difference in<br>
temperature between the water source and the Sterilization chamber) may be represented as<br>
∆T (delta T). Further, it is preferred that the temperature differential is selected according to<br>
each individual humidification stage. Thus, for example, the temperature differential may be<br>
chosen to be higher in the earlier stages and less in the later stages or vice versa. In practice,<br>
a series of suitable temperature differentials dt1, dt2, ...dtn each corresponding to the<br>
humidification stage of the same number, is selected for optimum control of the<br>
humidification. An intermediate stage Sx will thus have an associated ∆T value of ∆TK<br>
Towards the latter stages of the humidification, the temperature difference will preferably<br>
level out to avoid overheating the water and causing the chamber temperature to increase<br>
undesirably.<br><br>
A preferred humidification step may have many individual stages. The following Table<br>
1 shows 27 possible stages with corresponding pressure and temperature differential values.<br><br><br>
In Table 1 above, the left hand column gives the number of the individual<br>
humidification stage, the middle column gives the associated water vapour pressure for that<br>
stage (in the table, the pressure is given in units of ¼ Torr) and the right hand column<br>
indicates the preferred temperature differential for that particular humidification stage, that<br>
is, the difference in temperature between the chamber and the water source (the temperatures<br>
in table 1 are given in units of hundredths of a degree centigrade).<br>
This table of values is programmed into a processor (such as a computer, for example<br>
the PLC), so that the parameters can be controlled automatically in response to the particular<br>
conditions, such as chamber temperature and pressure, as measured by the system<br>
components.<br>
Looking at Table 1 in more detail, at the start of the humidification step the water<br>
source is at approximately the same temperature as the chamber and the chamber has just<br>
been evacuated (at least preferably to a pressure of 5/4 Torr). This represents stage 1 with<br>
corresponding water vapour pressure of 0 and temperature differential (Delta T) of 0. The<br>
valve is then opened and water evaporates from the source to enter the sterilization chamber<br>
as water vapour. The valve is shut and the water source is heated to 75/100 °C above the<br>
chamber temperature. The valve is now opened again. This is now stage 2 of the<br>
humidi fication, and when the pressure in the chamber reaches 80 x ¼ Torr (as shown in Table<br>
1 as the pressure corresponding to stage 2) the valve is closed and the water source is heated<br>
to 125/100 degrees above the chamber temperature and the valve is opened for stage 3 until<br>
the corresponding pressure of 100 x ¼ Torr is reached.<br>
The process is repeated through all the stages until the relative humidity in the<br>
chamber is calculated to be equal or above the target relative humidification.<br>
As mentioned above, for a chamber temperature of 30.8 °C, a relative humidity of<br>
100% is represented by a water vapour pressure of 34 Torr. However, during the process, the<br>
chamber temperature may exceed the preferred temperature, and thus a higher water vapour<br>
pressure will be needed to give the same relative humidity value. The chamber temperature<br>
is regularly monitored and the value is provided to the processor. The processor keeps<br>
repeating the humidification stages from S1 to S2 to S3 etc. until the water vapour pressure<br><br>
inside the chamber (for the actual chamber temperature) corresponds to the target relative<br>
humidity.<br>
Table 1, which is programmed into the processor, thus has a sufficient number of<br>
humidification steps, with corresponding pressure and temperature information, to ensure that<br>
even when the chamber temperature increases beyond the preferred temperature, the processor<br>
has sufficient information to ensure reaching the target relative humidification.<br>
It is also preferred to run the humidification step for a minimum time to further assist<br>
in ensuring proper humidification.<br>
It is preferred that the target humidity is reached within 10 to 31 minutes. Thus, when<br>
the water vapour pressure set point is reached (which is 34 Torr ± 0.25 Torr for a chamber<br>
temperature of 30.8 °C) a "humidification plateau" is allowed for from 10 minutes to 1 hour,<br>
preferably for at least about 31 minutes. During the humidification plateau, the water vapour<br>
diffuser is kept at 37 °C to avoid any condensation in the diffuser and the valve is kept open<br>
to allow any additional water vapour which may be needed to maintain the target relative<br>
humidification (since, in practice, the chamber temperature may increase during the<br>
humidification plateau).<br>
The minimum humidification time is preferably 50 minutes. If the minimum water<br>
vapour pressure is reached in less than 19 minutes, the "humidification plateau" is extended<br>
beyond the preferred 31 minutes to ensure a total humidification time of at least 50 minutes.<br>
Otherwise, if the minimum water vapour pressure takes longer that 19 minutes to reach, the<br>
"humidification plateau" is still kept for 31 minutes, so the total humidification step will last<br>
longer than the minimum 50 minutes.<br>
The temperature of the sterilization chamber is monitored regularly. The temperature<br>
may be measured by using a device such as the RTD sensor discussed above. It is preferred<br>
to measure the chamber temperature indirectly. Since the mass of the gas in the chamber is<br>
so small, direct measurement would be inaccurate. The chamber temperature is therefore<br>
obtained by averaging measurements of the chamber back wall, top wall and bottom wall. <br><br>
Where TAV = Average chamber temperature<br>
TR = Temperature of rear wall<br>
TT = Temperature of top wall<br>
and TB = Temperature of bottom wall<br>
The temperature controls are summarized as follows.<br>
While the sterilizer is not in the Humidification phase: the water vapor diffuser<br>
temperature set point is 37°C ±0,5°C; the Humidifier heater set point is: [Average Chamber<br>
Temperature]; and the chamber door heater setpoint is [Average Chamber Temperature].<br>
Duringthe Humidification phase: the Humidifier heater set pointis [Average Chamber<br>
Temperature] + [Delta T]curve; the water vapor diffuser temperature set point is: [TRTDHumidifier]<br>
+ [3°C ±0,5°C]; and the chamber door heater setpoint is [Average Chamber Temperature].<br>
The values for [Delta T] curve. are values obtained from Table 1.<br>
Thus there is what may be referred to as a thermal inertia. That is, thermal energy<br>
added to the system, for example the heat which is applied to the water source, takes time<br>
before it is distributed throughout the whole system, even to the perimeters of the system.<br>
Figure 4 shows the progress of a humidification using graduated steps. The vertical<br>
axis shows the pressure in the Sterilization chamber in units of ¼ Torr. The horizontal axis<br>
shows the time. The targetwatervapourpressure at the preferred chamber temperature of 30.8<br>
°C is about 136 x ¼ Torr (which is 34 Torr). After this pressure has been reached, the valve<br>
is kept open so that the water source and the chamber are in fluid communication during the<br>
"humidification plateau". The target water vapour pressure of 136 x ¼ Torr is shown on the<br>
figure as the water vapour setpoint. After reaching the setpoint, the "humidification plateau"<br>
is maintained for 31 minutes as shown in the figure. It can also be seen from the figure that<br>
in the last 5 to 10 minutes of the humidification plateau, there are virtually no further<br>
increases in pressure, which shows that the conditions in the chamber have stabilized.<br><br>
After the humidification step, the next step is an ozone injection step which is<br>
represented as step 103 in Figures 1 and 2. Ozone is generated by an ozone generator. It is<br>
preferred to monitor the ozone produced by the generator to ensure that a sufficient quantity<br>
of ozone will be introduced to the sterilization chamber. Thus preferably the ozone generator<br>
is activated before the end of the humidification step so that sufficient ozone is being<br>
generated by the time it is required at the end of the humidification step. For a sterilization<br>
chamber of about 125 Litres, an ozone generation of between 160 and 200 mg/L at normal<br>
temperature and pressure (NTP) from the generator is preferred. Preferably, used ozone and<br>
unrequired ozone is catalytically destroyed (by conversion to oxygen) before expelling it to<br>
the atmosphere to avoid pollution.<br>
A suitable ozone generator produces ozone from oxygen (preferably extra-dry medical<br>
grade oxygen) which is submitted to an electrical field produced inside the generator, suitably<br>
at a high frequency voltage of about 10,000 volts peak to peak. The high voltage permits a<br>
corona discharge in the generator cells to convert the oxygen to ozone. Ozone is heat<br>
sensitive, so it is preferred to keep the ozone generator operation at around 2 to 4°C to<br>
optimise ozone production. When ready, the ozone is introduced into the humidified chamber<br>
until the ozone in the chamber preferably reaches a concentration in the range of about 45 to<br>
100 mg/L NTP, more preferably about 85 mg/L NTP. Coupled with the high humidity, this<br>
concentration is considered to be sufficient to achieve sterilization.<br>
The next step is the humidified ozone exposure step which is indicated as step 104 in<br>
Figures 1 and 2. This step involves maintaining the level of ozone and humidity achieved<br>
from the previous steps for a time sufficient to achieve a satisfactory level of sterilization. A<br>
time period of from 5 minutes to 1 hour may be needed, although 15 minutes is preferred.<br>
This step completes the first sterilization cycle. In the interest of maximising the assurance<br>
of sterilization, it is preferred to repeat the sterilization with at least a second sterilization<br>
cycle, preferably including repeating at least steps 101, 102, 103 and 104.<br>
The next step, is a re-conditioning step which is indicated as step 105 in Figures 1 and<br>
2. The purpose of this step is to remove any condensed water. Preferably all, or substantially<br>
all of the condensed water is removed and preferably all, or substantially all of the water<br><br>
vapour is removed in this step. It is preferred that the amount of water removed is from about<br>
75% to 100% by weight of all the water in the chamber, more preferably from about 80% to<br>
100%. Thus this step may be regarded as a flushing or purging step to remove condensed<br>
water. It is also preferred that the temperature of the chamber is restabilized to the target<br>
temperature, for example, the preferred temperature of 30.8 °C. The gaseous vehicle used for<br>
this purging or flushing step is preferably a gas which is inert in the context of the sterilization<br>
process. For example, some gases such as nitrogen and other gases, may form undesirable<br>
oxygenated products by contact with ozone and thus are preferably avoided. In this step, since<br>
it follows a previous sterilization cycle which has used ozone, it is preferred to avoid the use<br>
of air because of the high nitrogen content of air. The preferred gas for this step is oxygen,<br>
especially medical grade dry oxygen, which would usually be readily available in an<br>
environment in which the sterilization process of the invention would normally be used, such<br>
as a hospital. The reconditioning step preferably includes, or is preceded by, a vacuum step<br>
to remove humidity and ozone from the chamber. Preferably a vacuum in the range of about<br>
20 down to 5 Ton, more preferably less than 10 Torr, is applied. Gaseous contents removed<br>
from the chamber are passed to a catalyst to convert any ozone to oxygen, for environmental<br>
reasons. It is preferred to maintain the low pressure such as the preferred pressure of 10 Torr<br>
for a period of time, preferably 2 to 3 minutes, to allow gaseous contents within articles in the<br>
chamber (especially articles having pouches and containers) to equilibrate with the rest of the<br>
chamber, to optimise removal. Medical grade oxygen is then introduced to the chamber. It is<br>
preferred that this re-conditioning step include at lease one repetition of the vacuum and<br>
oxygen injection steps to optimise the removal of all condensation.<br>
The removal of condensed water may be referred to as a post-exposure step since it<br>
follows at least a first sterilization cycle and thus an exposure to the humidified ozone<br>
sterilant. However, it may be more appropriate to refer to it as a conditioning or re-<br>
conditioning step (since in preferred processes it may not be the first conditioning step and<br>
is intended to return the conditions within the chamber to conditions at least approximating<br>
those at the start of the sterilization).<br><br>
When all the sterilization cycles have been completed, a ventilation step is effected,<br>
which is indicated as 107 in Figures 1 and 2. The purpose of this step is to remove ozone and<br>
water vapour before the sterilization chamber is opened and the sterilized articles are<br>
removed.<br>
It will be readily understood by a person skilled in the art that the sequence of some<br>
of the steps may be varied without compromising sterilization. Some steps might be effected<br>
simultaneously although the successive sequence described above is preferred.<br>
An ozone sterilizer apparatus, suitable for use with the method of the invention is<br>
illustrated schematically in FIG. 3. Medical quality oxygen is subjected in an ozone-<br>
generating unit including an ozone generator 22 to an electrical field, which partially converts<br>
the oxygen into ozone. The ozone is then fed into a humidified sterilization chamber 10 where<br>
it sterilises medical devices. The ozone is subsequently reconverted into oxygen using an<br>
ozone converting unit 52. The only residues left at the end of the sterilization cycle are oxygen<br>
and clean water vapour.<br>
The apparatus includes a heated sterilization chamber 10 which can be sealed to<br>
contain a vacuum. This is achieved with an access door 12, which can be selectively opened<br>
for access into the chamber and which seals the chamber in the closed condition. The<br>
apparatus farther includes an ozone generator 22 for supplying ozone-containing gas to the<br>
sterilization chamber, a humidifier arrangement 30 for supplying water vapour to the<br>
sterilization chamber, and a vacuum pump 40 (a suitable pump is a dry scroll vacuum pump<br>
manufactured by Anestiwata). The vacuum pump 40 is used for the application of a sufficient<br>
vacuum to the sterilization chamber 10 to increase the penetration of the sterilizing gas and<br>
to be able to boil water at a temperature below the temperature inside the sterilization<br>
chamber. The vacuum pump 40 in the preferred embodiment is capable of producing a<br>
sufficient vacuum in the sterilization chamber to lower the boiling point of water in the<br>
chamber below the temperature in the chamber. In the preferred apparatus, the vacuum pump<br>
is capable of producing a vacuum of 0.1 mbar. Ozone produced in the ozone-generating unit<br>
22 is destroyed in an ozone converting unit 52 to which ozone-containing gas is fed either<br>
after passage through the sterilization chamber 10 or directly from the ozone-generating unit<br><br>
22 through valve 29b. The ozone piping circuit includes an ozone converting catalyst (such<br>
as DEST 25, manufacturer TS03). The ozone converting unit 52 is connected in series before<br>
or after the vacuum pump 40 to prevent ozone gas escaping to ambient air. The ozone<br>
decomposing material in the preferred catalyst is carulite. For economic and practical reasons,<br>
it is preferred to use a catalyst to decompose the ozone exhausted from the sterilization<br>
chamber 10. The catalyst destroys ozone on contact and converts it into oxygen with a certain<br>
amount of heat being produced. Catalysts of this type and their manufacture are well known<br>
to the person skilled in the art of ozone generators and need not be described in detail herein.<br>
Furthermore, other means for destroying the ozone contained in the sterilization gas will be<br>
readily apparent to a person skilled in the art. For example, the gas can be heated for a<br>
preselected time to a temperature at which the ozone decomposition is accelerated, for<br>
example, to 300° C.<br>
The humidifier arrangement 30 includes a humidifier chamber 32 (such as HUM 0.5,<br>
manufacturer TS03) sealed from ambient air and connected to the sterilization chamber 10<br>
through a conduit and a vapour intake valve 34. The humidifier chamber 32 is equipped with<br>
a level control to ensure a sufficiently high water level (not shown). Water is directly supplied<br>
to the humidifier chamber 32 from a drinking or purified water supply connection. Water is<br>
supplied to the humidifier chamber 32 by way of a filter 33, a pressure regulator 35, and input<br>
valve 36. The water vapour produced in the humidifier chamber 32 enters the sterilization<br>
chamber 10 by way of a vapour intake valve 34.<br>
The ozone-generating unit includes an ozone generator 22 (such as OZ, model 14a,<br>
manufacturer TSO3) of the corona discharge type, which is cooled to decrease the ozone<br>
decomposition rate, as is well known in the art. To achieve a good lethality rate in an ozone<br>
sterilization process, the ozone supplied in the sterilization chamber should be sufficient to<br>
obtain a concentration of 48 to 96 milligrams per litre, preferably 50 to 90 milligrams per litre.<br>
At these concentrations, the ozone generation is associated with a relatively high energy loss<br>
in the form of heat. Generally, about 95% of the supplied electrical energy is converted into<br>
heat and only 5% is used to produce ozone. Since heat accelerates the inverse transformation<br>
of ozone into oxygen, it must be removed as quickly as possible by cooling the ozone<br><br>
generator 22. The ozone generator in the apparatus is kept at the relatively low temperature<br>
of 3 to 6°C by either an indirect cooling system with cooling water recirculation, or a direct<br>
cooling system with a refrigeration unit for cooling. The cooling system 60 is preferably kept<br>
at the temperature of 3 to 6°C. In the preferred embodiment, the cooling system is kept at<br>
4°C so that the ozone-containing gas generated by unit 22 is at the ambient temperature of<br>
around 20 to 35°C, preferably 30°C. Thus, the ozone-containing gas entering into the<br>
sterilization chamber for humidification and sterilization is kept at ambient<br>
temperatures of from 20 to 35 °C. This means that ozone decomposition is kept to aminimum<br>
and that the sterilization process is more efficient.<br>
The ozone-generating unit is preferably supplied with medical quality or medical<br>
grade oxygen. The apparatus can be connected to a wall oxygen outlet common in hospitals<br>
or to an oxygen cylinder or to any other source capable of supplying the required quality and<br>
flow. The supply of oxygen to the generator 22 takes place across a filter 23, a pressure<br>
regulator 24, a flow metre 25 and an oxygen shut-off valve 26. The generator is protected<br>
against oxygen over-pressure by a safety pressure switch 27. The ozone-oxygen mixture<br>
generated by the generator 22 is directed to the sterilization chamber 10 by a needle valve 28<br>
and a mixture supply solenoid valve 29a The mixture can also be directly supplied to the<br>
ozone converting unit 52 by way of a bypass solenoid valve 29b. In a preferred embodiment<br>
which includes a sterilization chamber of 125 liters volume, the pressure regulator 24<br>
preferably controls the oxygen input at a flow rate of about 1.5 litres per minute. However,<br>
it will be readily apparent to the skilled person mat other flow rates may be used depending<br>
on the make and model of the ozone generator 22 and the size of the sterilization chamber.<br>
The apparatus in accordance with the invention preferably includes a closed circuit<br>
cooling system using no fresh water.<br>
The vacuum in the sterilization chamber 10 is produced by the vacuum pump 40 and<br>
across the ozone converting unit 52 and the sterilization chamber drainage valve 44.<br><br>
OPERATION<br>
As mentioned above, the preferred sterilization method includes the following general<br>
steps as illustrated by the flow chart of FIG. 1. The medical instruments to be sterilized are<br>
sealed in sterile packaging containers or pouches such as generally used in the hospital<br>
environment and then placed into the sterilization chamber. The door of the sterilization<br>
chamber is closed and locked and the preconditioning phase is started by applying a vacuum<br>
to the sterilization chamber. Water vapour is admitted into the sterilization chamber to<br>
humidify the chamber contents. A mixture of ozone and oxygen is supplied to the chamber<br>
and the chamber maintained sealed for a preselected treatment period. Before repeating the<br>
sterilization cycle, a re-conditioning step is effected to remove any condensed water. Then the<br>
vacuum application and ozone supply steps are repeated at least once. To remove all<br>
remaining ozone in the sterilization chamber 10 when the sterilization cycle is completed a<br>
ventilation phase begins. After the ventilation phase is complete the door is unlocked and the<br>
sterilized material can be removed from the chamber.<br>
Before the sterilization cycle begins, the humidifier chamber 32 is filled with water<br>
to an adequate level, which is sufficient to satisfy the requirements for the whole sterilization<br>
cycle. This is done by temporarily opening the water-input valve 36. Valve 36 remains closed<br>
for the whole remainder of the sterilization cycle. In the first phase of the sterilization cycle,<br>
intake valve 18, oxygen shut-off valve 26, mixture supply valve 29a, and mixture bypass<br>
valve 29b (optional) are closed and vapour intake valve 34, and chamber drainage valve 44<br>
are opened. The sterilization chamber 10 is evacuated to a vacuum pressure of about 0.1 mbar.<br>
Water vapour inlet valve 34 closes when the absolute pressure in the sterilization chamber<br>
falls below 60 mbar. Once a pressure of about 1,0 mbar is achieved, the chamber drainage<br>
valve 44 closes and the vapour intake valve 34 opens to lower the pressure in the humidifier<br>
chamber 32 to the vacuum pressure in the sterilization chamber. That forces the water in the<br>
humidifier chamber to boil and evaporate and to enter the sterilization chamber 10 as water<br>
vapour. Shortly before the end of the humidification period (usually about 2 to 6 min. before<br>
the end of the humidification period), the ozone generator is activated. The flow of the<br>
oxygen/ozone mixture exiting the ozone generator is controlled by ozone mixture supply<br><br>
valve 29. The apparatus preferably further includes a needle valve 28 capable of resisting the<br>
vacuum and of adjusting the flow to between 1 and 12 litres per minute. As an optional<br>
feature, the generator can be started at the same time as the humidification period begins. This<br>
is then achieved with shut-off valve 26 and mixture bypass valve 29b. Shut-off valve 26 opens<br>
to let oxygen enter the generator. The ozone-oxygen mixture produced by the generator is<br>
then guided directly into the ozone converting unit 52 through mixture bypass valve 29b and<br>
vacuum pump 40. After a humidification period the oxygen-ozone mixture is guided into the<br>
sterilization chamber by opening the mixture supply valve 29a and closing the mixture bypass<br>
valve 29b. The oxygen-ozone mixture enters the chamber 10 until an ozone concentration of<br>
85 milligrams per litre in the chamber is achieved. The time required for this step is dependent<br>
on the flow rate and concentration of the ozone gas in the mixture (preferably 10% to 12 %<br>
by weight). At this point in time, the mixture supply valve 29a is closed to seal off the<br>
sterilization chamber and to maintain the humidified ozone/oxygen gas mixture in the<br>
chamber under vacuum.<br>
Once the sterilization chamber is filled with the humidified sterilization gas (mixture<br>
of oxygen and ozone gas), the generator 22 is stopped, the oxygen shut-off valve 26 is closed,<br>
and the ozone is maintained in contact with the articles to be sterilized for about 15 minutes,<br>
for a sterilization chamber of a volume of 125 liters (4 cubic feet). At this stage, the<br>
sterilization chamber is still under the effect of a partial vacuum of about 670 mbar. In an<br>
optional second step, the pressure level is raised to about 900 mbar using oxygen as a filling<br>
gas. This pressure level is maintained for about 20 min. After the sterilization period, the<br>
vacuum is reapplied, preferably at a pressure of about 1 0 mbar again. Once the vacuum<br>
reaches 0.1 mbar, the humidification phase is recommenced, followed by the renewed<br>
injection of an oxygen/ozone sterilization gas mixture, followed by the sterilization period.<br>
The cycle of applying a vacuum of about 1.0 mbar, injecting sterilization gas, humidifying<br>
and sterilizing period, can be repeated, and the number of repeat sterilization cycles (mini<br>
cycles) selected to achieve complete sterilization of the instruments. Preferably, between any<br>
two successive sterilization cycles, a re-conditioning step is effected, as described above, to<br>
remove any condensed water from the sterilization chamber. The number of repeat cycles<br><br>
used in an experimental set-up including a 125 liters (4 cubic foot) chamber was 2 repeat<br>
cycles. This set-up conformed to the Security Assurance Level standards of the FDA (SAL<br>
10 -6).<br>
To remove all remaining ozone and humidity in the sterilization chamber 10 after<br>
complete sterilization (after all successive sterilization cycles) a ventilation phase is engaged.<br>
The ventilation phase begins after the last sterilization cycle. The chamber drainage valve 44<br>
opens and the vacuum is applied down to approximately 13 mbar. Vapour intake valve 34<br>
closes when the pressure reaches 60 mbar to evacuate the remaining ozone in the humidifier.<br>
Once the vacuum pressure of 13 mbar is obtained, drainage valve 44 closes and the intake<br>
valve 21 opens, admitting oxygen into the sterilization chamber 10. Once atmospheric<br>
pressure is reached, intake valve 21 is closed, the sterilization chamber drainage valve 44<br>
opened, and vacuum reapplied until a pressure of 13 mbar is reached. The ventilation cycle<br>
is then repeated twice. Once the atmospheric pressure is reached after the last cycle, the door<br>
mechanism of the sterilization chamber is activated to permit access to the contents of the<br>
sterilization chamber. The ventilation phase has two functions. First, to remove all ozone<br>
residues in the sterilization chamber before opening the access door and, second, to ensure<br>
that the sterilized material is dry, which is achieved by evaporation when the vacuum pressure<br>
is applied.<br>
The ozone-containing gas evacuated from the sterilization chamber 10 is passed over<br>
the ozone decomposing catalyst 52 of the ozone converting unit 50 prior to exhausting the gas<br>
to the atmosphere to ensure a complete decomposition of the ozone in the sterilization gas.<br>
The ozone generator 22 is used during only two portions of the sterilization cycle, the<br>
activation of the generator 22 (with optional valves 29a and 29b) and the evacuation of the<br>
sterilization chamber 10. During the start up phase of the generator 22, the mixture bypass<br>
valve 29b is opened and the ozone is guided across the catalyst. Once the start-up phase of the<br>
generator 22 is complete, the bypass valve 29b closes. During evacuation of the sterilization<br>
chamber 10, the sterilization chamber drainage valve 44 is opened and the ozone containing<br>
sterilization waste gas guided to the catalyst. Once the evacuation of the sterilization chamber<br>
10 is completed, the drainage valve 44 is closed. The circulation of ozone is ensured by the<br><br>
vacuum pump 40, which operates Airing the whole sterilization cycle including all repeat<br>
cycles. If the ozone decomposing catalyst is located upstream of the vacuum pump this also<br>
ensures that the carulite is kept as dry as possible in order to avoid fouling of the catalytic<br>
material. Since the vacuum pump 40 is running during the whole sterilization process, the<br>
carulite is exposed to reduced pressures, even if it is not used for the decomposition of ozone.<br>
This forces evaporation of water contained in the catalyst, which may have been absorbed<br>
by the carulite during the evacuation of the sterilization chamber. If located downstream of<br>
the vacuum pump, the catalyst is preferably heated to keep the carulite sufficiently dry.<br>
A system, such as the one described above, suitable for use with the method of the<br>
invention is capable of maintaining a relative humidity level of 90%, preferably 95 % +5%<br>
or higher, throughout the sterilization cycle.<br>
The energy needed to evaporate the water during the humidification phase is taken<br>
from many sources. It is taken from the structure of the humidifier unit and the sterilization<br>
chamber and from the material to be sterilized. This contributes to a further cooling of the<br>
chamber, and its contents. In effect, at 20°C, water boils up to an absolute pressure of 23.3<br>
mbar and at 35°C, water boils up to an absolute pressure of 56.3 mbar. The vacuum in the<br>
sterilization chamber is preferably adjusted to a pressure where the boiling temperature of<br>
water is lowered below the temperature in the sterilization chamber. That boiling temperature<br>
may be so low that, depending on the energy available from the surrounding structure and<br>
gases, the water in the humidifier chamber will freeze before it gets vaporized. The humidifier<br>
may also be cooled by the evaporation process to a point where condensation freezes to the<br>
external surface of the humidifier. This can be avoided by heating the external surface of the<br>
humidifier sufficiently to keep the exterior of the humidifier unit and the water inside the<br>
humidifier chamber at room temperature, preferably at or above the temperature of the<br>
sterilization chamber. This is achieved with aheating arrangement (not illustrated) which will<br>
be readily apparent to the person of skill in the art.<br>
The water vapour generated in the humidifier unit increases the relative humidity in<br>
the sterilization chamber. The humidification phase is continued until the relative humidity<br>
of the gas surrounding the medical instruments contained in the packaging pouches and<br><br>
containers reaches a minimum of 95% ± 5%, preferably 100%. For a sterilization chamber<br>
of an approximate volume of 125 liters, the water vapour admission increases the pressure to<br>
about 53 mbar in the sterilization chamber.<br>
Oxygen/ozone-containing sterilization gas is injected into the humidified sterilization<br>
chamber at ambient temperature. For optimum operation of a sterilizer having a 125 liters<br>
chamber, a system is preferably used which is capable of generating an ozone flow in the<br>
range of about 1 to about 6 litres per minute, more preferably about 1.5 to 2 litres per minute,<br>
containing from about 160 to 200 mg/1 of ozone to obtain at least a total of around 10,000 mg<br>
of ozone for each of the fillings of the sterilization chamber.<br>
Changes and modifications in the specifically described embodiments can be carried<br>
out without departing from the scope of the invention which is intended to be limited only by<br>
