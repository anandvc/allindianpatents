				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to isoquinolinone derivatives,<br>
and their use as Pharmaceuticals.  In particular, the<br>
present invention relates to the use of these compounds to<br>
inhibit the activity of the enzyme poly (ADP-<br>
ribose)polymerase, also known as poly(ADP-ribose)synthase<br>
and poly ADP-ribosyltransferase, and commonly referred to as<br>
PARP.<br>
The mammalian enzyme PARP (a 113-kDa multidomain protein) has been implicated in the signalling of DNA damage through its ability to recognize and rapidly bind to DNA single or double strand breaks (D"Amours et al, 1999, Biochem. J. 342: 249-268) .<br>
Several observations have led to the conclusion that PARP participates in a variety of DNA-related functions including gene amplification, cell division, differentiation, apoptosis, DNA base excision repair and also effects on telomere length and chromosome stability (d"Adda di Fagagna et al, 1999, Nature Gen., 23(1 ): 76-80).<br>
Studies on the mechanism by which PARP modulates DNA repair and other processes has identified its importance in the formation of poly (ADP-ribose) chains within the cellular nucleus (Althaus, F.R. and Richter, C., 1987, ADP-Ribosylation of Proteins: Enzymology and Biological Significance, Springer-Verlag, Berlin).  The DNA-bound, activated PARP utilizes NAD to"synthesize poly (ADP-ribose) on a variety of nuclear target proteins, including topoisomerase, histones and PARP itself (Rhun et al, 1998, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 245: 1-10)<br>
Poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation has also been associated with malignant transformation.  For example, PARP activity is higher in the isolated nuclei of SV40-transformed fibroblasts, while both leukemic cells and colon cancer cells show higher enzyme activity than the equivalent normal leukocytes and colon mucosa (Miwa et al, 1977, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 181: 313-321; Burzio et al, 1975, Proc. Soc. Exp. Bioi. Med. 149: 933-938; and Hirai et al, 1983, Cancer Res. 43: 3441-3446).<br>
A number of low-molecular-weight inhibitors of PARP have been used to elucidate the functional role of poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation in DMA repair.  In cells treated with alkylating agents, the inhibition of PARP leads to a marked increase in DNA-strand breakage and cell killing (Durkacz et al, 1980, Nature 283: 593-596; Berger, N.A., 1985, Radiation Research, 101: 4-14).<br>
Subsequently, such inhibitors have been shown to enhance the effects of radiation response by suppressing the repair of potentially lethal damage (Ben-Hur et al, 1984, British Journal of Cancer, 49 (Suppl. VI): 34-42; Schlicker et al, 1999, Int. J. Radiat. Bioi., 75: 91-100). PARP inhibitors have been reported to be effective in radio sensitising hypoxic tumour cells (US 5,032,617; US 5,215,738 and US 5,041, 653) .<br>
Furthermore, PARP knockout (PARP -/-) animals exhibit genomic instability in response to alkylating agents and y~ irradiation (Wang et al, 1995, Genes Dev., 9: 509-520; Menissier de Murcia et al, 1997, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 94: 73C3-7307).<br>
A role for PARP has also been demonstrated in certain vascular diseases, septic shock, ischaemic injury and neurotoxicity (Cantoni et al, 3989, Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1014: 1-7; Szabo, et al, 1997, J. Clin.Invest., 100: 723-735).  Oxygen radical DNA damage that leads to strand breaks in DNA, which are subsequently recognised by PARP, is a major contributing factor to such disease states as shown by PARP inhibitor studies (Cosi et al, 1994, J. Neurosci. Res., 39: 38-46; Said et al, 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,<br>
93: 4688-4692). More recently, PARP has been demonstrated to play a role in the pathogenesis of haemorrhagic shock<br>
(Liaudet et al, 2000, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 97(3):<br>
10203-10208) .<br>
It has also been demonstrated that efficient retroviral infection of mammalian cells is blocked by the inhibition of PARP activity.  Such inhibition of recombinant retroviral vector infections was shown to occur in various different cell types (Gaken et al, 1996, J. Virology, 70(6): 3992-4000). Inhibitors of PARP have thus been developed for the use in anti-viral therapies and in cancer treatment (W091/18591) .<br>
Moreover, PARP inhibition has been speculated to delay the onset of aging characteristics in human fibroblasts (Rattan and Clark, 1994, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 201 (2): 665-672).  This may be related to the role that PARP plays in controlling telomere function (d"Adda di Fagagna et al, 1999, Nature Gen., 23(1 ): 76-80).<br>

Definitions<br>
The term "aromatic ring" is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a cyclic aromatic structure, that is, a cyclic structure having delocalised n-electron orbitals.<br>
The aromatic ring fused to the main core,	i.e. that formed<br>
by -A-B-, may bear further fused aromatic	rings (resulting<br>
in, e.g. naphthyl or anthracenyl groups).  The aromatic<br>
ring(s) may comprise solely carbon atoms,	or may comprise<br>
carbon atoms and one or more heteroatoms,	including but not<br>
limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms.  The aromatic ring(s) preferably have five or six ring atoms.<br>
The aromatic ring(s) may optionally be substituted.  If a substituent itself comprises an aryl group, this aryl group is not considered to be a part of the aryl group to which it is attached.  For example, the group biphenyl is considered herein to be a phenyl group (an aryl group comprising a single aromatic ring) substituted with a phenyl group. Similarly, the group benzylphenyl is considered to be a phenyl group (an aryl group comprising a single aromatic ring) substituted with a benzyl group.<br>
In one group of preferred embodiments, the aromatic group comprises a single aromatic ring, which has five or six ring atoms, which ring atoms are selected from carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, and which ring is optionally substituted. Examples of these groups include benzene, pyrazine, pyrrole, thiazole, isoxazole, and oxazole. 2-Pyrone can also be considered to be an aromatic ring, but is less preferred.<br>
If the aromatic ring has six atoms, then preferably at least four, or even five or all, of the ring atoms are carbon. The other ring atoms are selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur, with nitrogen and oxygen being preferred.  Suitable groups include a ring with: no hetero atoms (benzene); one nitrogen ring atom (pyridine); two nitrogen ring atoms (pyrazine, pyrimidine and pyridazine); one oxygen ring atom (pyrone); and one oxygen and one nitrogen ring atom (oxazine).<br>
If the aromatic ring has five ring atoms, then preferably at least three of the ring atoms are carbon.  The remaining<br>
ring atoms are selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur. Suitable rings include a ring with: one nitrogen ring atom (pyrrole); two nitrogen ring atoms (imidazole, pyrazole); one oxygen ring atom (furan); one sulphur ring atom (thiophene); one nitrogen and one sulphur ring atom (isothiazole or thiazole); and one nitrogen and one oxygen ring atom (isoxazole or oxazole).<br>
The aromatic ring may bear one or more substituent groups at any available ring position.  These substituents are selected from halo, nitro, hydroxy, ether, thiol, thioether, amino, C1-7 alkyl, 03-20 heterocyclyl and 05-20 aryl.  The aromatic ring may also bear one or more substituent groups which together form a ring.  In particular these may be of formula -(CHa)™- or -O-(CH2) P-O-, where m is 2, 3, 4 or 5 and p is 1, 2 or 3.<br>

Includes Other Forms<br>
Included in the above are the well known ionic, salt, solvate, and protected forms of these substituents.  For example, a reference to carboxylic acid (-COOH) also includes the anionic (carboxylate) form (-COCT), a salt or solvate thereof, as well as conventional protected forms. Similarly, a reference to an amino group includes the protonated form {-N+HR1R2) , a salt or solvate of the amino group, for example, a hydrochloride salt, as well as conventional protected forms of an amino group.  Similarly, a reference to a hydroxyl group also includes the anionic<br>
form (~O~) , a salt or solvate thereof, as well as conventional protected forms of a hydroxyl group.<br>
Isomers, Salts, Solvates, Protected Forms, and Prodrugs Certain compounds may exist in one or more particular geometric, optical, enantiomeric, diasteriorneric, epimeric, stereoisomeric, tautomeric, conformational, or anomeric forms, including but not limited to, cis- and trans-forms; E- and Z-forms; c-, t-, and r- forms; endo- and exo-forms; R-r S-, and meso-foiiiis; D- and L-foims; d- and J-forms; (+) and (-) forms; keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms; syn- and anti-forms; synclinal- and anticlinal-forms; a- and fi-foijits; axial and equatorial forms; boat-, chair-, twist-, envelope-, and halfchair-forms; and combinations thereof, hereinafter collectively referred to as "isomers" (or "isomeric forms").<br>
If the compound is in crystalline form, it may exist in a number of different polymorphic forms.<br>
Note that, except as discussed below for tautomeric forms, specifically excluded from the term "isomers," as used herein, are structural (or constitutional) isomers (i.e. isomers which differ in the connections between atoms rather than merely by the position of atoms in space).  For example, a reference to a methoxy group, -OCH3, is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, a hydroxymethyl group, -CH2OH.  Similarly, a reference to ortho-chlorophenyl is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, meta-chlorophenyl.  However, a reference to a class of structures may well include structurally isomeric forms falling within that class (e.g.<br>
C1-7alkyl includes n-propyl and iso-propyl; butyl includes n-, iso-, sec-, and tert-butyl; methoxyphenyl includes ortho-, meta-, and para-methoxyphenyl).<br>
The above exclusion does riot pertain to tautomeric forms, for example, keto-, enol-, and enolate-farms, as in, for example, the following tautomeric pairs: keto/enol, imine/enamine, amide/imino alcohol, amidine/amidine, nitroso/oxime, thioketone/enethiol, N-nitroso/hyroxyazo, and nitro/aci-nitro.<br>
Particularly relevant to the present invention is the tautomeric pair that exists when RN is H, illustrated below:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Note that specifically included in the term "isomer" are compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions.  For example, H may be in any isotopic form, including 1H, 2H (D), and 3H (T); C may be in any isotopic form, including 12C, 13C, and 14C; 0 may be in any isotopic form, including 16O and 18O; and the like.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound includes all such isomeric forms, including (wholly or partially) racemic and other mixtures thereof.  Methods for the preparation (e.g. asymmetric synthesis) and separation (e.g. fractional crystallisation and chromatographic means) of such isomeric forms are either known in the art or are readily obtained by adapting the methods taught herein, or known methods, in a known manner.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound also includes ionic, salt, solvate, and protected forms of thereof, for example, as discussed below.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a corresponding salt of the act.ive compound, for example, a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt.  Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge et al., 1977, "Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salts," J. Pharm. Sci., Vol. 66, pp. 1-19.<br>
For example, if the compound is anionic, or has a functional group which may be anionic (e.g. -COOH may be -COO-) , then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation.  Examples of suitable inorganic cations include/ but are not limited to, alkali metal ions such as Na-f and K+, alkaline earth cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2"1", and other cations such as Al"1"3. Examples of suitable organic cations include, but are not limited to, ammonium ion (i.e., NH4+) and substituted ammonium ions (e.g. NH3R+, NH2R2\ NHRa+, NR4+) .  Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from: ethylamine, diethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, triethylamine, butylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglumine, and tromethamine, as well as amino acids, such as lysine and arginine.  An example of a common quaternary ammonium ion is N(CH3)4+.<br>
If the compound is cationic, or has a functional group which may be cationic (e.g. -NH2 may be -NHa+) , then a salt may be formed with a suitable anion.  Examples of suitable inorganic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following inorganic acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric, sulfurous, nitric, nitrous, phosphoric, and phosphorous.  Examples of suitable organic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following organic acids: acetic, propionic, succinic, gycolic, stearic, palmitic, lactic, malic, pamoic,<br>
tartaric, citric, gluconic, ascorbic, maloic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, aspartic, ben/;oic, cinnamic, pyruvic, salicyclic, sulfanilic, 2-acetyoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isethionic, valeric, and gluconic. Examples of suitable polymeric anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following polymeric acids: tannic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a corresponding solvate of the active compound.  The tei.ni "solvate" is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a complex of solute (e.g. active compound, salt of active compound) and solvent.  If the solvent is water, the solvate may be conveniently referred to as a hydrate, for example, a mono-hydrate, a di-hydrate, a tri-hydrate, etc.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle the active compound in a chemically protected form. The term "chemically protected form," as used herein, pertains to a compound in which one or more reactive functional groups are protected from undesirable chemical reactions, that is, are in the form of a protected or protecting group (also known as a masked or masking group or a blocked or blocking group).  By protecting a reactive functional group, reactions involving other unprotected reactive functional groups can be performed, without affecting the protected group; the protecting group may be removed, usually in a subsequent step, without substantially affecting the remainder of the molecule.  See, for example, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (T. Green and P. Wuts, Wiley, 1991).<br>
For example, a hydroxy group may be protected as an ether (-OR) or an ester (-OC(=0)R), for example, as: a t-butyl ether; a benzyl, benzhydryl (diphenylmethyl), or trityl (triphenylmethyl) ether; a trimethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl ether; or an acetyl ester (-OC(=0)CH3/ -OAc).<br>
For example, an aldehyde or ketone group may be protected as an acetal or ketal, respectively, in which the carbonyl group (&gt;C=0) is converted to a diether (&gt;C(OR)2&gt;/ by reaction with, for example, a primary alcohol.  The aldehyde or ketone group is readily regenerated by hydrolysis using a large excess of water in the presence of acid.<br>
For example, an amine group may be protected, for example, as an amide or a urethane, for example, as: a methyl amide<br>
(-NHCO-CH3) ; a benzyloxy amide (-NHCO-OCH2C6H5/ -NH-Cbz) ; as a t-butoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3) 3, -NH-Boc); a 2-biphenyl-2-propoxy amide (-NHCO-OC (CH3) 2C6H4C6H5, -NH-Bpoc) , as a 9-fluorenylmethoxy amide (-NH-Fmoc), as a 6-nitroveratryloxy amide (-NH-Nvoc), as a 2-trimethylsilylethyloxy amide (-NH-Teoc), as a 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxy amide (-NH-Troc) , as an allyloxy amide (-NH-Alloc), as a 2(-phenylsulphonyl) ethyloxy amide (-NH-Psec); or, in suitable cases, as an N-oxide<br>
(&gt;NO) .<br>
For example, a carboxylic acid group may be protected as an ester for example, as: an C1-7 alkyl ester (e.g. a methyl ester; a t-butyl ester) ; a C1-7 haloalkyl ester (e.g. a C1-7 trihaloalkyl ester) ; a triC1-7alkylsilyl-C1-7alkyl ester; or a C5-20 aryl-C1-7 alkyl ester (e.g. a benzyl ester; a nitrobenzyl ester); or as an amide, for example, as a methyl amide.<br>
For example, a thiol group may be protected as a thioether (-SR), for example, as: a benzyl thioether; an acetamidomethyl ether (-S-CH2NHC (=-0) Clh) .<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle the active compound in the form of a prodrug.  The term "prodrug", as used herein, pertains to a compound which, when metabolised {e.g. in vivo), yields the desired active compound.  Typically, the prodrug is inactive, or less active than the active compound, but may provide advantageous handling, administration, or metabolic properties.<br>
For example, some prodrugs are esters of the active compound (e.g. a physiologically acceptable metabolically labile ester).  During metabolism, the ester group (-C(=O)OR) is cleaved to yield the active drug.  Such esters may be formed by esterification, for example, of any of the carboxylic acid groups (-C(=0)OH) in the parent compound, with, where appropriate, prior protection of any other reactive groups present in the parent compound, followed by deprotection if required.  Examples of such metabolically labile esters include those wherein R is C1-7alkyl (e.g. -Me, -Et) ; C1-7aminoalkyl (e.g. aminoethyl; 2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl; 2- (4-morpholino) ethyl) ; and acyloxy-C1-7alkyl (e.g. acyloxymethyl; acyloxyethyl; e.g. pivaloyloxymethyl; acetoxymethyl; 1-acetoxyethyl; I- (1-methoxy-1-methyl)ethyl-carbonxyloxyethyl; 1-(benzoyloxy)ethyl; isopropoxy-carbonyloxymethyl; 1-isopropoxy-carbonyloxyethyl; cyclohexyl-carbonyloxymethyl; 1-cyclohexyl-carbonyloxyethyl; cyclohexyloxy-carbonyloxymethyl; 1-cyclohexyloxy-carbonyloxyethyl; (4-tetrahydropyranyloxy) carbonyloxymethyl; 1-(4-tetrahydropyranyloxy) carbonyloxyethyl; (4-tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxymethyl;<br>
and 1-(4-tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxyethyl).  Further suitable prodrug forms include phosphonate and glycolate salts.<br>
Also, some prodrugs are activated enzymatically to yield the active compound, or a compound which, upon further chemical reaction, yields the active compound.  For example, the prodrug may be a sugar derivative or other glycoside conjugate, or may be an amino acid ester derivative.<br>

Use<br>
The present invention provides active compounds,<br>
specifically, active in inhibiting the activity of PARP.<br>
The term "active", as used herein, pertains to compounds which are capable of inhibiting PARP activity, and specifically includes both compounds with intrinsic activity (drugs) as well as prodrugs of such compounds, which prodrugs may themselves exhibit little or no intrinsic activity.<br>
One assay which may conveniently be used in order to assess the PARP inhibition offered by a particular compound is described in the examples below.<br>
The present invention further provides a method of inhibiting the activity of PARP in a cell, comprising contacting said cell with an effective amount of an active compound, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable composition.  Such a method may be practised in vitro or in vivo.<br>
For example, a sample of cells may be grown in vitro and an active compound brought into contact with said cells, and the effect of the compound on those cells observed.  As examples of "effect" the amount of DNA repair effected in a certain time may be determined.  Where the active compound is found to exert an influence on the cells, this may be<br>
used as a prognostic or diagnostic marker of the efficacy of the compound in methods of treating a patient carrying cells of the same cellular type.<br>
The term "treatment" as used herein in the context of treating a condition pertains generally to treatment and therapy, whether of a human or an animal (e.g. in veterinary applications), in which some desired therapeutic effect is achieved, for example, the inhibition of the progress of the condition, and includes a reduction in the rate of progress, a halt in the rate of progress, amelioration of the condition, and cure of the condition.  Treatment as a prophylactic measure {i.e. prophylaxis) is also included.<br>
The term "adjunct" as used herein relates to the use of active compounds in conjunction with known therapeutic means.  Such means include cytotoxic regimes of drugs and/or ionising radiation as used in the treatment of different cancer types.<br>
The term "therapeutically-effective amount", as used herein, pertains to that amount of an active compound, or a material, composition or dosage from comprising an active compound, which is effective for producing some desired therapeutic effect, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.<br>
Active compounds may	also be used as cell culture additives<br>
to inhibit PARP, for	example, in order to radio-sensitize<br>
cells to known chemo	or ionising radiation treatments in<br>
vitro.<br>
Active compounds may also be used as part of an in vitro assay, for example, in order to determine whether a<br><br>
candidate host is likely to benefit from treatment with the compound in question.<br>
Administration<br>
The active compound or pharmaceutical composition comprising the active compound may be administered to a subject by any convenient route of administration, whether systemically/ peripherally or at the site of desired action, including but not limited to, oral (e.g. by ingestion); topical (including e.g. transdermal, intranasal, ocular, buccal, and sublingual); pulmonary (e.g. by inhalation or insufflation therapy using, e.g. an aerosol, e.g. through mouth or nose); rectal; vaginal; parenteral, for example, by injection, including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intracardiac, intrathecal, intraspinal, intracapsular, subcapsular, intraorbital, intraperitoneal, intratracheal, subcuticular, intraarticular, subarachnoid, and intrasternal; by implant of a depot, for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly.<br>
The subject may be a eukaryote, an animal, a vertebrate animal, a mammal, a rodent (e.g. a guinea pig, a hamster, a rat, a mouse), murine (e.g. a mouse), canine (e.g. a dog), feline (e.g. a cat), equine (e.g. a horse), a primate, simian (e.g. a monkey or ape), a monkey (e.g. marmoset, baboon), an ape (e.g. gorilla, chimpanzee, orangutang, gibbon), or a human.<br>
Formulations<br>
While it is possible for the active compound to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical composition (e.g. formulation) comprising at least one active compound, as defined above, together with<br>
one 02- more pharmaceutical ly acceptable carriers, adjuvants, excipients, diluents, tillers, buffexs, stabilisers, preservatives, lubricants, or other materials well known to those skilled in the art and optionally other therapeutic or prophylactic agents.<br>
Thus, the present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions, as defined above, and methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one active compound, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, buffers, adjuvants, stabilisers, or other materials, as described herein.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" as used herein pertains to compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of a subject (e.g. human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.  Each carrier, excipient, etc. must also be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation.<br>
Suitable carriers, excipients, etc. can be found in standard pharmaceutical texts, for example, Remington"s Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1990.<br>
The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy.  Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active compoiind with the<br>
carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active compound with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product.<br>
Formulations may be in the form of liquids, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, syrups, tablets, losenges, granules, powders, capsules, cachets, pills, ampoules, suppositories, pessaries, ointments, gels, pastes, creams, sprays, mists, foams, lotions, oils, boluses, electuaries, or aerosols.<br>
Formulations suitable for oral administration (e.g. by ingestion) may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active compound; as a powder or granules; as a solution or suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion; as a bolus; as an electuary; or as a paste -<br>
A tablet may be made by conventional means, e.g. compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients.  Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active compound in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with one or more binders (e.g. povidone, gelatin, acacia, sorbitol, tragacanth, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose); fillers or diluents (e.g. lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, calcium hydrogen phosphate) ; lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc, silica); disintegrants (e.g. sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked povidone, cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose) ;<br>
surface-active or dispersing or wetting agents (e.g. .sodium lauryl sulfate); and preservatives (e.g. methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, sorbic acid). Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.  The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active compound therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile.  Tablets may optionally be provided with an enteric coating, to provide release in parts of the gut other than the stomach.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration (e.g. transdermal, intranasal, ocular, buccal, and sublingual) may be formulated as an ointment, cream, suspension, lotion, powder, solution, past, gel, spray, aerosol, or oil. Alternatively, a formulation may comprise a patch or a dressing such as a bandage or adhesive plaster impregnated with active compounds and optionally one or more excipients or diluents.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include losenges comprising the active compound in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active compound in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active compound in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active compound is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active compound.<br>
Formulations suitable for nasal administration, wherein the carrier is a solid, include a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, in the range of about 20 to about 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e., by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose.  Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid for administration as, for example, nasal spray, nasal drops, or by aerosol administration by nebuliser, include aqueous or oily solutions of the active compound.<br>
Formulations suitable for administration by inhalation include those presented as an aerosol spray from a pressurised pack, with the use of a suitable propellant, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichoro-tetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gases.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration via the skin include ointments, creams, and emulsions.  When f oijuulated in an ointment, the active compound may optionally be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base.  Alternatively, the active compounds may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base.  If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example, at least about 30% w/w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e. an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane-1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol and mixtures thereof.  The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active compound through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include<br>
dimethylsulfoxide and related analogues.<br>
When formulated as a topical emulsion, the oily phase may optionally comprise merely an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent)/ or it may comprises a mixture of at least one eitvulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil.  Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabiliser.  It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat.  Together, the emulsifier (s) with or without stabiliser(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and/or fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations.<br>
Suitable emulgents and emulsion stabilisers include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate and sodium lauryl sulphate.  The choice of suitable oils or fats for the fcumulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties, since the solubility of the active compound in most oils likely to be used in pharmaceutical emulsion formulations may be very low.  Thus the cream should preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers.  Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used, the last three being preferred esters.  These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required.  Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils can be used.<br>
Formulations suitable for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising, for example, cocoa butter or a salicylate.<br>
Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active compound, such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration (e.g. by injection, including cutaneous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal), include aqueous and non-aqueous isotonic, pyrogen-free, sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, preservatives, stabilisers, bacteriostats, and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents, and liposomes or other microparticulate systems which are designed to target the compound to blood components or one or more organs.  Examples of suitable isotonic vehicles for use in such formulations include Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer"s Solution, or Lactated Ringer"s Injection. Typically, the concentration of the active compound in the<br>
solution is from about 1 ng/ml to about 10 µg/ml, for example from about 10 ng/ml to about 1 µg/ml.  The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example, ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be<br>
prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets. Formulations may be in the form of liposomes or other microparticulate systems which are designed to target the active compound to blood components or one or more organs.<br>
Dosage<br>
It will be appreciated that appropriate dosages of the active compounds, and compositions comprising the active compounds, can vary from patient to patient.  Determining the optimal dosage will generally involve the balancing of the level of therapeutic benefit against any risk or deleterious side effects of the treatments of the present invention.  The selected dosage level will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the activity of the particular compound,, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds, and/or materials used in combination, and the age, sex, weight, condition, general health, and prior medical history of the patient.  The amount of compound and route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician, although generally the dosage will be to achieve local concentrations at the site of action which achieve the desired effect without causing substantial harmful or deleterious side-effects .<br>
Administration in vivo can be effected in one dose, continuously or intermittently (e.g. in divided doses at appropriate intervals) throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those of skill in the art and will vary with the formulation used for therapy, the purpose of the therapy, the target cell being treated, and<br>
the subject being treated.  Single or multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the treating physician.<br>
In general, a suitable dose of the active compound is in the range of about 100 µg to about 250 mg per kilogram body weight of the subject per day.  Where the active compound is a salt, an ester, prodrug, or the like, the amount administered is calculated on the basis of the parent compound and so the actual weight to be used is increased proportionately.<br>

Biological Testing<br>
In order to assess the inhibitory action of the compounds, the following assay was used to determine IC50 values.<br>
Mammalian PARP, isolated from Hela cell nuclear extract, was incubated with Z-buffer (25mM Hepes (Sigma); 12.5 mM MgCl2 (Sigma); 50mM KC1 (Sigma); 1 mM DTT (Sigma); 10% Glycerol (Sigma) 0.001% NP-40 (Siyma); pH 7.4) in 96 well FlashPlates (TRADE MARK) (NEW, UK) and varying concentrations of said inhibitors added. All compounds were diluted in DMSO and<br>
gave final assay concentrations of between 10 and 0.01 jaM, with the DMSO being at a final concentration of 1% per well. The total assay volume per well was 40 nl.<br>
After 10 minutes incubation at 30°C the reactions were initiated by the addition of a 10 µl reaction mixture, containing NAD (5µM), 3H-NAD and 30mer double stranded DNA-oligos. Designated positive and negative reaction wells were done in combination with compound wells (unknowns) in order to calculate % enzyme activities.  The plates were then shaken for 2 minutes and incubated at 30°C for 45 minutes.<br>
Following the incubation, the reactions were quenched by the addition of 50 µl 30% acetic acid to each well.  The plates were then shaken for 1 hour at room temperature.<br>
The plates were transferred to a TopCount NXT (TRADE MARK) (Packard, UK) for scintillation counting.  Values recorded<br>
are counts per minute (cpm) following a 30 second counting of each well.<br>
The % enzyme activity for each compound is then calculated using the following equation:<br>
  (cpm of unknowns -mean negative cpm) % Inhibition =100 - lOOx   <br>
   (mean positive cpm-mean neagative cpm)<br>
The results are detailed below as IC50 values (the concentration at which 50% of the enzyme activity is inhibited), which are determined over a range of different concentrations, normally from 10 µM down to 0.01 µM. Such IC50 values are used as comparative values to identify increased compound potencies.<br>
The Dose Enhancing Factor (DEF) is a ratio of the enhancement of cell growth inhibition elicited by the test compound in the presence of bleomycin compared to bleomycin alone.  The test compounds were used at a fixed concentration of 25 µM.  Bleomycin was used at a concentration of 0.5 µg/ml.   The DEF was calculated from the formula:<br>
Growthrc    Growthbieo x<br>
GrOWthcontrol      Gr OWth (bleo + TC)<br>
where GrowthTc is cell growth in presence of the test<br>
compound;<br>
GrowthControi is cell growth of control cells;<br>
Growthbieo is cell growth in presence of bleomycin; and<br>
Growth(bieo+TO is cell growth in presence of bleomycin and the<br>
test compound.<br>
Cell growth was assessed using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay  (Skehan, P., et al. , 1990, J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 82, 1107-1112).  2,000 HeLa cells were seeded into each well of a flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plate in a volume of 100 µl and incubated for 6 hours at 37 °C.  Cells were either replaced with media alone or with media containing the test compound at a final concentration of 25 µM.  Cells were allowed to grow for a further 1 hour before the addition of bleomycin to either untreated cells or test compound treated cells.  Cells untreated with either bleomycin or test compound were used as a control.  Cells treated with test compound alone were used to assess the growth inhibition by the test compound.<br>
Cells were left for a further 16 hours before replacing the media and allowing the cells to grow for a further 72 hours at 37°C. The media was then removed and the cells fixed<br>
with lOOµl of ice cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid.  The plates were incubated at 4°C for 20 minutes and then washed four times with water.  Each well of cells was then stained with lOOµl of 0.4% (w/v) SRB in 1% acetic acid for 20 minutes before washing four times with 1% acetic acid. Plates were then dried for 2 hours at room temperature.  The dye from the stained cells was solubilized by the addition of 100µl of lOmM Tris Base into each well.  Plates were gently shaken and left at room temperature for 30 minutes before measuring the optical density at 564nM on a Microquant microtiter plate reader.<br>
