METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR OXYGEN TRANSPORT COMPRISING A fflGH OXYGEN AFFINITY MODIFIED HEMOGLOBIN<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to U.S. Serial No. 60/347,741, filed January 11,2002.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to blood products, and more particularly to compositions comprising a modified hemoglobin having a high affinity for oxygen and methods for making such compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Circulatory System and the Nature of Hemoglobin<br>
[0003] The blood is the means for delivering nutrients to the tissues and removing waste products from the tissues for excretion. The blood is composed of plasma in which red blood cells (RBCs or erythrocytes), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets are suspended. Red blood cells comprise approximately 99% of the cells in blood, and their principal ftinction is the transport of oxygen to the tissues and the removal of carbon dioxide therefrom. [0004] The left ventricle of the heart pumps the blood through the arteries and the smaller arterioles of the circulatory system. The blood then enters the capillaries, where the majority of the exchange of nutrients and cellular waste products occurs. (See, e.g., A. C. Guyton, "Human Physiology And Mechanisms Of Disease" (3rd. ed.; W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, Pa.), pp. 228-229 (1982)). Thereafter, the blood travels through the venules and veins in its return to the right atrium of the heart. Though the blood that returns to the heart is oxygen-poor compared to that which is pumped from the heart, when at rest, the returning blood still contains about 75% of the original oxygen content.<br>
2^<br><br>
[0005] The reversible oxygenation function (i.e., the delivery of oxygen) of RBCs is carried out by the protein hemoglobin. In mammals, hemoglobin has a molecular weight of approximately 64,000 daltons and is composed of about 6% heme and 94% globin. In its native form, it contains two pairs of subunits (i.e., it is a tetramer), each containing a heme group and a globin polypeptide chain. In aqueous solution, hemoglobin is present in equilibrium between the tetrameric (MW 64,000) and dimeric forms (MW 32,000); outside of the RBC, the dimers are prematurely excreted by the kidney (plasma half-life of approximately 2-4 hours). Along with hemoglobin, RBCs contain stroma (the RBC membrane), which comprises proteins, cholesterol, and phospholipids.<br>
Exogenous Blood Products<br>
[0006] Due to the demand for blood products in hospitals and other settings, extensive research has been directed at the development of blood substitutes and plasma expanders. A blood substitute is a blood product that is capable of carrying and supplying oxygen to the tissues. Blood substitutes have a number of uses, including replacing blood lost during surgical procedures and following acute hemorrhage, and for resuscitation procedures following traumatic injury. Plasma expanders are blood substitutes that are administered into the vascular system but are typically not capable of carrying oxygen. Plasma expanders can be used, for example, for replacing plasma lost from bums, to treat volume deficiency shock, and to effect hemodilution (e.g., for the maintenance of normovolemia and to lower blood viscosity). Essentially, blood substitutes can be used for these purposes or any pvupose in which banked blood is currently administered to patients. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,001,401 to Bonson et al., and 4,061,736 to Morris et al)<br>
[0007] The current human blood supply is associated with several limitations that can be alleviated through the use of an exogenous blood substitute. To illustrate, the widespread availability of safe and effective blood substitutes would reduce the need for banked (allogeneic) blood. Moreover, such blood substitutes would allow the immediate infusion of a resuscitation solution following traumatic injury without regard to cross-matching (as is required for blood), thereby saving valuable time in resupplying oxygen to ischemic tissue. Likewise, blood substitutes can be administered to patients prior to surgery, allowing removal of autologous blood from the patients which could be returned later in the procedure, if needed, or after surgery. Thus, the use of exogenous blood products not only protects patients from exposure to<br>
/.<br>
3<br><br>
non-autologous (allogeneic) blood, it conserves either autologous or allogeneic (banked, crossmatched) blood for its optimal use.<br>
Limitations of Current Blood Substitutes<br>
[0008] Attempts to produce blood substitutes (sometimes referred to as "oxygen-carrying plasma expanders") have thus far produced products with marginal efficacy or whose manufacture is tedious, expensive, or both. Frequently, the cost of manufacturing such products is so high that it effectively precludes the widespread use of the products, particularly m those markets where the greatest need exists (e.g., emerging third-world economies). [0009] Blood substitutes can be grouped into the following three categories: i) perfluorocarbon-based emulsions, ii) liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin, and iii) modified cell-free hemoglobin. As discussed below, none has been entirely successfiil, though products comprising modified cell-free hemoglobin are thought to be the most promising. Perfluorochemical-based compositions dissolve oxygen as opposed to bindmg it as a Ugand. In order to be used in biological systems, the perfluorochemical must be emulsified wdth a lipid, typically egg-yolk phospholipid. Though the perfluorocarbon emulsions are inexpensive to manufacture, they do not carry sufficient oxygen at clinically tolerated doses to be effective. Conversely, while liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin has been shown to be effective, it is far too costly for widespread use. (See generally, Winslow, Robert M., "Hemoglobin-based Red Cell Substitutes," Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore (1992)). [0010] Most of the blood substitute products in clinical trials today are based on modified hemoglobin. These products, frequently referred to as hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs), generally comprise a homogeneous aqueous solution of a chemically-modified hemoglobin, essentially free from other red cell residue (stroma). Although stroma-free hemoglobin (SFH) from humans is the most common raw material for preparmg a HBOC, other sources of hemoglobin have also been used. For example, hemoglobin can be obtained or derived from animal blood (e.g., bovine or porcine hemoglobin) or from bacteria or yeast or transgenic animals or plants molecularly altered to produce a desired hemoglobin product. [0011] The chemical modification is generally one of intramolecular cross-linking, oligomerization and/or polymer conjugation to modify the hemoglobin such that its persistence in the ckculation is prolonged relative to that of unmodified hemoglobin, and its oxygen binding properties are similar to those of blood. Intramolecular cross-hnking chemically binds together subunits of the tetrameric hemoglobin unit to prevent the formation of diniers which, as<br>
f-1<br><br>
previously indicated, are prematurely excreted. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,296,465 to Rausch et al.)<br>
[0012] The high costs of manu&amp;cturing HBOC products have greatly limited their commercial viability. In addition, the present inventors have found that known HBOCs have a tendency to release excessive amounts of oxygen to the tissues at the arteriole walls rather than the capillaries. This can result in insufficient oxygen available for delivery by the HBOC to the tissues surrounding the capillaries. This is despite the fact that the initial loading of the HBOC with oxygen may be relatively high, compared with that normally achieved with natural red blood cells, except in the case of very low affinity mutants.<br>
[0013] In most instances, HBOCs have been designed to have oxygen affinities that are the same as or lower than that of native hemoglobin. However, as discussed above, this may result in insufficient delivery of oxygen to the tissues. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a blood substitute that comprises an HBOC with high oxygen afBnities in an aqueous diluent.<br>
WO 03/059286 describes the use of surface-modified haemoglobin in plasma as blood substitutes (see paragraph [0013] therein). The surface-modified haemoglobin may be haemoglobin to which polyalkylene oxide has been attached (see paragraph [0018] therein). In one embodiment, the surface modification is covalent attachment to the exposed amino acid side chains on the haemoglobin molecule (see paragraph [0040] therein).<br>
Nowhere in this document there any teaching or suggestion that the haemoglobin be derivatised while in the oxygenated state, as recited in the amended claims.<br>
Nowhere in D4 is there any teaching or suggestion that the polyalkylene oxide be covalently attached via a surface thiol group of an exposed amino acid side chain on the haemoglobin molecule, as recited in the present invention.<br>
WO 03/059287 describes the use of modified haemoglobin and a crystalloid in an aqueous solution as a blood substitute (see paragraph [0013] therein). The modified haemoglobin may be haemoglobin to which polyalkylene oxide (e.g., PEG) has been attached (see paragraphs [0021] and [0022] therein). In one embodiment, the surface modification is covalent attachment to the exposed amino acid side chains on the haemoglobin molecule (see paragraph [0044] therein). Example 1 therein describes a PEG-modified haemoglobin that was prepared by first thiolating haemoglobin and then reacting with eimide-activated PEG 5000 (see paragraph [0051] therein). Example 1 also appears in this document's own priority application.<br>
[0051] PEG modified hemoglobin was prepared from human hemoglobin isolated from outdated blood. The hemoglobin was first thiolated and then reacted with maleimideactivated PEG, 5000 Daltons. Sprague-Dawloy rats (n=2) were shock-induced for thirty<br>
Nowhere in this document is there any teaching or suggestion that the haemoglobin be derivatised while in the oxygenated state, as recited in the present invention.<br><br>
wo 2004/058291 describes modified haemoglobin having a number of PEG chains attached via thiol groups (both native and chemically-introduced) by reaction with PEG that has been functionalized with a maleimide moiety (see paragraphs [0009] and [0010] therein).<br>
[[0009] More particularly, the present invention provides a hemoglobin molecule (Hb) having six ± one PEG chains, wherein two of said PEG chains are bound to Gys-93 (s) of Hb, and the remaining PEG chains are bound to thiol groups introduced on ^-NH^ of Hb.<br>
[0010] The present invention also provides a process for preparing a modified hemoglobin molecule (Hb), comprising the steps of: (a) reacting Hb with 8-15 fold excess of iminothiolane to form thiolated Hb; and (b) reacting the thiolated Hb with 16-30 fold excess of PEG functionalized with a maleimide moiety, to form the modified Nb.<br>
Nowhere in this document is there any teaching or suggestion that the haemoglobin be derivatised while in the oxygenated state, as recited in the present invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014] The methods and compositions of the present invention are useful in a variety of settings including emergency rooms, operating rooms, military conflicts, cancer hospitals, and veterinary clinics. The low toxicity and high stability of the present invention permits storage at room temperature without compromising the efficacy of the described blood substitute. The present invention also circumvents the requirement for blood-tj^e cross-matching and the associated laboratory testing, allowing for earlier and safer intervention in patient treatment. The combination of low toxicity, long-term stability, and universal applicability of the present invention therefore presents a particularly useful substitute for blood. [0015] In one aspect, the present invention provides a blood substitute product comprising surface-modified oxygenated hemoglobin, wherein the sur&amp;ce-modified oxygenated hemoglobin has a PSO less than native stroma-fi«e hemoglobin fix&gt;m the same animal source (i.e. fi'om the same species of animal) when measured under the same conditions. Suitable animal sources include, e.g., humans, cows, pigs, horses.<br>
[0016] In a preferred embodiment, the blood substitute product takes the form of a composition comprising the surface-modified oxygenated hemoglobin and an aqueous diluent. [0017] In a specific embodiment, the surface-modified oxygenated hemoglobin has a PSO less than 10 ton, preferably less than 7 torr.<br><br>
[0018] In another aspect, the present invention provides a blood substitute product produced by covalently attaching one or more polyalkylene oxides to the oxygenated hemoglobin. [0019] In a specific embodiment, the blood substitute product is produced by covalently attaching a polymer of a polyalkylene oxide such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) having the formula H(OCH2CH2)nOH, where n is greater than or equal to 4. Preferably, the product has a methemoglobin/total hemoglobin ratio less than 0.10.<br>
[0020] In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a blood substitute product stable to autooxidation at 24°C, comprismg a PEG-hemoglobin conjugate, wherein the methemoglobin/total hemoglobin ratio is less than 0.10 and the PEG-hemoglobin conjugate has a P50 less than 10 torr.<br>
[0021]   In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of making a blood substitute composition comprising the steps of: a) preparing hemoglobin having a methemoglobin/total hemoglobin ratio less than 0.10; b) covalently attaching polyalkylene oxide to the hemoglobin to form surface-modified oxygenated hemoglobin having a P50 less than 10 torr; and c) suspending the surface-modified oxygenated hemoglobin in a suitable diluent. Preferably preparing hemoglobin further comprises isolating hemoglobin from red blood cells. [0022] In addition, the step of preparing the hemoglobin can further comprise isolating hemoglobin fi:om red blood cells, wherein the hemoglobin has a methemoglobin/total hemoglobin ratio of 0.10 or greater, and exposing the hemoglobin to aerobic conditions (i.e. to the atmosphere) for a time sufficient to lower the methemoglobin/total hemoglobin ratio to less than 0.10. This step may be carried out in the absence of a thiol-containing reducing agent. [0023] In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a method of using a blood substitute product to deliver oxygen to a tissue, comprising administering the product in an aqueous diluent to a mammal in need thereof. [0024] Other aspects of the present invention are described throughout the specification.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0035] The present invention is directed to blood substitutes comprising HBOCs having high oxygen affinity. For certain applications, these compositions are capable of delivering oxygen to tissues more efficiently than blood substitutes with oxygen affinities that approximate native hemoglobin.<br>
Definitions<br>
[0036] To facilitate understanding of the invention set forth in the disclosure that follows, a number of terms are defined below.<br>
ISK<br><br>
[0037] The term "hemoglobin" refers generally to the protem contained within red blood cells<br>
that transports oxygen. Each molecule of hemoglobin has 4 subunits, 2 a chains and 2 (3 chains,<br>
which are arranged in a tetrameric structure. Each subunit also contains one heme group, which<br>
is the iron-containing center that binds oxygen. Thus, each hemoglobin molecule can bind 4<br>
oxygen molecules.<br>
[0038] The term "modified hemoglobin" includes, but is not limited to, hemoglobin altered by a<br>
chemical reaction such as intra- and inter-molecular cross-linking, genetic manipulation,<br>
polymerization, and/or conjugation to other chemical groups (e.g., polyalkylene oxides, for<br>
example polyethylene glycol, or other adducts such as proteins, peptides, carbohydrates,<br>
synthetic polymers and the like). In essence, hemoglobin is "modified" if any of its structural or<br>
functional properties have been altered fi-om its native state. As used herein, the term<br>
"hemoglobin" by itself refers both to native, unmodified, hemoglobin, as well as modified<br>
hemoglobin.<br>
[0039] The term "surface-modified hemoglobin" is used to refer to hemoglobin described above<br>
to which chemical groups such as dextran or polyalkylene oxide have been attached, most<br>
usually covalently. The term "surface modified oxygenated hemoglobin" refers to hemoglobin<br>
that is in the "R" state when it is surface modified.<br>
[0040] The term "stroma-fi-ee hemoglobin" refers to hemoglobin fi-om which all red blood cell<br>
membranes have been removed.<br>
[0041] The term "methemoglobin" refers to an oxidized form of hemoglobin that contains iron<br>
in the ferric state and cannot fiinction as an oxygen carrier.<br>
[0042] The term "MalPEG-Hb" refers to hemoglobin to which malemidyl-activated PEG has<br>
been conjugated. Such MalPEG may be fiuther referred to by the following formula:<br>
[0043] Hb-(S-Y-R-CH2-CH2-[0-CH2-CH2]n-0-CH3)m	Formula I<br>
[0044] where Hb refers to tetrameric hemoglobin, S is a surface thiol group, Y is the<br>
succinimido covalent link between Hb and Mal-PEG, R is an aUcyl, amide, carbamate or phenyl<br>
group (depending on the source of raw material and the method of chemical synthesis), [O-CH2-<br>
CH2]n are the oxyethylene units making up the backbone of the PEG polymer, where n defines<br>
the length of the polymer (e.g., MW = 5000), and O-CH3 is the terminal methoxy group. PHP<br>
and POE are two different PEG-modified hemoglobin.<br>
[0045] The term "perfluorocarbons" refers to synthetic, inert, molecules that contain fluorine<br>
atoms, and that consist entirely of halogen (Br, F, CI) and carbon atoms. In the form of<br>
J<br><br>
emulsions, they are under development as blood substances, because they have the ability to dissolve many times more oxygen than equivalent amounts of plasma or water. [0046] The term "plasma expander" refers to any solution that may be given to a subject to treat blood loss.<br>
[0047] The term "oxygen carryuig capacity," or simply "oxygen capacity" refers to the capacity of a blood substitute to carry oxygen, but does not necessarily correlate with the efficiency in which it delivers oxygen. Oxygen carrying capacity is generally calculated firom hemoglobin concentration, since it is known that each gram of hemoglobin binds 1.34 ml of oxygen. Thus, the hemoglobin concentration in g/dl multiplied by the factor 1.34 yields the oxygen capacity in ml/dl. Hemoglobin concentration can be measured by any known method, such as by using the P-Hemoglobin Photometer (HemoCue, Inc., Angelholm, Sweden). Similarly, oxygen capacity can be measured by the amount of oxygen released from a sample of hemoglobin or blood by using, for example, a fuel cell instrument {e.g., Lex-02-Con; Lexington Instruments). [0048] The term "oxygen affinity" refers to the avidity with which an oxygen carrier such as hemoglobin binds molecular oxygen. This characteristic is defined by the oxygen equilibrium curve which relates the degree of saturation of hemoglobin molecules with oxygen (Y axis) with the partial pressure of oxygen (X axis). The position of this curve is denoted by the value, P50, the partial pressure of oxygen at which the oxygen carrier is half-saturated witii oxygen, and is inversely related to oxygen affinity. Hence the lower the P50, the higher the oxygen affinity. The oxygen affinity of whole blood (and components of whole blood such as red blood cells and hemoglobin) can be measured by a variety of methods known in the art. (See, e.g., Winslow et ah, J. Biol. Chem. 252(7):2331-37 (1977)). Oxygen affinity may also be determined using a commercially available HEMOX^^ TM Analyzer (TCS Scientific Corporation, New Hope, Permsylvania). (See, e.g., Vandegriff and Shrager in "Methods in Enzymology" (Everse et ah, eds.) 232:460 (1994)).<br>
[0049] The terms "hypertonic" means a colloidal solution with a colloidal osmotic pressure i (oncotic) than blood (&gt;approximately 25-27 mm Hg). Colloid osmotic pressure may be measured by any suitable technique, such as in a Wescor instrument.<br>
[0050] The term "oxygen-carrying component" refers broadly to a substance capable of carrying oxygen in the body's circulatory system and delivering at least a portion of that oxygen to the tissues. In preferred embodiments, the oxygen-carrying component is native or modified hemoglobin, and is also referred to herein as a "hemoglobin based oxygen carrier," or "HBOC".<br>
to<br><br>
[0051] The term "hemodynamic parameters" refers broadly to measurements indicative of blood<br>
pressure, flow and volume status, including measurements such as blood pressure, cardiac<br>
output, right atrial pressure, and left ventricular end diastolic pressure.<br>
[0052] The term "crystalloid" refers to small molecules (usually less than 10 A) such as salts,<br>
sugars, and buffers. Unlike colloids, crystalloids do not contain any oncotically active<br>
components and equilibrate in between the circulation and interstitial spaces very quickly.<br>
[0053] The term "colloid," in contrast to "crystalloid" refers to larger molecules (usually greater<br>
than 10 A) that equilabrate across biological membranes depending on their size and charge and<br>
includes proteins such as albumin and gelatin, as well as starches such as pentastarch and<br>
hetastarch.<br>
[0054] The term "colloid osmotic pressure" refers to the pressure exerted by a colloid to<br>
equilibrate fluid balance across a membrane.<br>
[0055] The term "stable to autooxidation" refers to the ability of a HBOC to maintain a low rate<br>
of autoxidation. HBOC is considered stable at 24°C if the methemoglobin/total hemoglobin<br>
ratio does not increase more than 2% after 10 hours at 24°C. For example, if the rate of<br>
autoxidation is 0.2hr'^, then if the initial percentage of methemoglobin is 5%, HBOC would be<br>
considered stable at room temperature for 10 hours if this percentage did not increase above 7%.<br>
[0056] The term "methemoglobin/total hemoglobin ratio" refers to the ratio of deoxygenated<br>
hemoglobin to total hemoglobin.<br>
[0057] The term "mixture" refers to a mingling together of two or more substances without the<br>
occurrence of a reaction by which they would lose their individual properties; the term<br>
"solution" refers to a liquid mixture; the term "aqueous solution" refers to a solution that<br>
contains some water and may also contain one or more other liquid substances with water to<br>
form a multi-component solution; the term "approximately" refers to the actual value being<br>

The Nature of Oxygen Delivery and Consumption<br>
[0060] Although the successful use of the compositions and methods of the present invention do not require comprehension of the underlying mechanisms of oxygen delivery and consumption, basic knowledge regarding some of these putative mechanisms may assist in understanding the discussion that follows. It has generally been assumed that the capillaries are the primary conveyors of oxygen to the tissue. However, regarding tissue at rest, current findings indicate that there is approximately an equipartition between arteriolar and capillary oxygen release. That is, hemoglobin in the arterial system is believed to deliver approximately one third of its oxygen content in the arteriolar network and one-third in the capillaries, while the remainder exits the microcirculation via the venous system.<br>
[0061] The arteries themselves are sites of oxygen utilization. For example, the artery wall requires energy to effect regulation of blood flow through contraction against vascular resistance. Thus, the arterial wall is normally a significant site for the difElision of oxygen out of the blood. However, current oxygen-delivering compositions {e.g., HBOCs) may release too much of their oxygen content in the arterial system, and thereby induce an autoregulatory reduction in capillary perfusion. Accordingly, the efficiency of oxygen delivery of a blood substitute may actually be hampered by having too much oxygen or too low an oxygen affinity. [0062] The rate of oxygen consumption by the vascular wall, i.e., the combination of oxygen required for mechanical work and oxygen required for biochemical synthesis, can be determined by measuring the gradient at the vessel wall. See, e.g., Winslow, et al, in "Advances in Blood Substitutes" (1997), Birkhauser, ed., Boston, MA, pages 167-188. Present technology allows accurate oxygen partial pressure measurements in a variety of vessels. The measured gradient is directly proportional to the rate of oxygen utilization by the tissue in the region of the measurement. Such measiurements show that the vessel wall has a baseline oxygen utilization which increases with increases in inflammation and constriction, and is lowered by relaxation. [0063] The vessel wall gradient is inversely proportional to tissue oxygenation. Vasoconstriction increases the oxygen gradient (tissue metabolism), while vasodilation lowers the gradient. Higher gradients are indicative of the fact that more oxygen is used by the vessel wall, while less oxygen is available for the tissue. The same phenomenon is believed to be present throughout the microcirculation.<br><br><br>
The Relationship Between Vasoconstriction and Oxygen Affinity<br>
[0064] The rationale for developing an HBOC with high oxygen affinity is based, in part, on<br>
past studies using cell-free hemoglobins as altematives to red blood cell fransfusions. Some of<br>
the physiological effects of these solutions remain incompletely understood. Of these, perhaps<br>
the most controversial is the propensity to cause vasoconstriction, which may be manifest as<br>
hypertension in animals and man (Amberson, W., "Clinical experience with hemoglobin-saline<br>
solutions,". Science 106:117-117 (1947)) (Keipert, P., A. Gonzales, C. Gomez, V. Macdonald,<br>
J. Hess, and R. Winslow, "Acute changes ia systemic blood pressure and urine output of<br>
conscious rats following exchange transfusion with diaspirin-crosslinked hemoglobin solution,"<br>
Transfusion 33: 701-708, (1993)). Human hemoglobin crosslinked between a chains with bis-<br>
dibromosalicyl-fiimarate (aaHb) was developed by the U.S. Army as a model red cell	;<br>
substitute, but was abandoned by the Army after demonstration of severe increases in pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance (Hess, J., V. Macdonald, A. Murray, V. Coppes, and C. Gomez, "Pulmonary and systemic hypertension after hemoglobin administration," Blood 78: 356A (1991)). A commercial version of this product was also abandoned after a disappointing Phase III clinical trial (Winslow, R. M. "aa-Crosslinked hemoglobin: Was failure predicted by preclinical testmg?" Vox sang 19: 1-20(2000).<br>
[0065] The most commonly advanced explanation for the vasoconstriction produced by cell-free hemoglobin is that it readily binds the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, nitric oxide (NO). In fact, recombinant hemoglobins with reduced affinity for NO have been produced which appear to be less hypertensive in top-load rat experiments (Doherty, D. H., M. P. Doyle, S. R. Curry, R. J. Vali, T. J. Fattor, J. S. Olson, and D. D. Lemon, "Rate of reaction with nitric oxide determines the hypertensive effect of cell-free hemoglobin," Nature Biotechnology 16: 672-676 (1998)) (Lemon, D. D., D. H. Doherty, S. R. Curry, A. J. Mathews, M. P. Doyle, T. J. Fattor, and J. S. Olson, "Control of the nitric oxide-scavenging activity of hemoglobin," Art Cells, Blood Subs., andlmmob. Biotech 24: 378 (1996)). However, studies suggest that NO binding may not be the only explanation for the vasoactivity of hemoglobin. It has been found that certain large hemoglobin molecules, such as those modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG), were virtually free of the hypertensive effect, even though their NO binding rates were identical to those of the severely hypertensive aaHb (Rohlfs, R. J., E. Brunei, A. Chiu, A. Gonzales, M. L. Gonzales, D. Magde, M. D. Magde, K. D. Vandegriff, and R. M. Winslow, "Arterial blood pressure responses to cell-free hemoglobin solutions and the reaction with nitric oxide," J Biol<br><br><br>
Chem 273: 12128-12134 (1998)). Furthermore, it was found that PEG-hemoglobin was extraordinarily effective in preventing the consequences of hemorrhage when given as an exchange transfusion prior to hemorrhage (Winslow, R. M., A. Gonzales, M. Gonzales, M. Magde, M. McCarthy, R. J. Rohlfs, and K. D. Vandegriff, "Vascular resistance and the efficacy of red cell substitutes," JAppl Physiol 85: 993-1003 (1998)). [0066] This protective effect correlated with the lack of hypertension, suggesting that vasoconstriction is responsible for the disappointing performance of many of the hemoglobin-based products studied to date. Based on these observations, a hypothesis was developed to explain vasoconstriction, as an alternative, or possibly m addition to, the effect of NO binding. Although not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that a substantial component of hemoglobin's vasoactive effect is a reflexive response to the diffusion of hemoglobin in the cell-free space. This hypothesis was tested in an in vitro capillary system, and it was demonstrated that PEG-hemoglobin, which has a reduced diffiision constant, transferred O2 in a manner very similar to that of native red blood cells (McCarthy, M. R., K. D. Vandegriff, and R. M. Winslow, "The role of facilitated dijGfusion in oxygen transport by cell-free hemoglobin: Implications for the design of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers," Biophysical Chemistry 92: 103-117 (2001)). Oxygen affmity would be expected to play a role in its facilitated diffusion by hemoglobin in the plasma space, since the change in saturation from the hemoglobin to the vessel wall is a determinant of the dififiision gradient of the hemoglobin itself.<br>
[0067] Oxygen affinity of cell-free hemoglobin may play an additional role in the regulation of vascular tone, since the release of O2 to vessel walls in the arterioles will trigger vasoconstriction (Lindbom, L., R. Tiima, and K. Arfors, "Influence of oxygen on perfusion capillary density and capillary red cell velocity in rabbit skeletal muscle," Microvasc Res 19: 197-208 (1980)). In the hamster skinfold, the PO2 in such vessels is in the range of 20-40 Torr, where the normal red cell oxygen equilibrium curve is steepest (Intaglietta, M., P. Johnson, and R. Winslow, "Microvascular and tissue oxygen distribution," Cardiovasc Res 32: 632-643 (1996)). Thus from a theoretical point of view, it may be important for the P50 of cell-free hemoglobin to be lower than that of red cells (i.e., higher O2 affmity), in order to prevent release of O2 in arteriolar regulatory vessels.<br>

Oxygen-Carrying Component<br>
[0068] In preferred embodiments, the oxygen carrier (f.e., the oxygen-carrying component) is a hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier, or HBOC. The hemoglobin may be either native (unmodified); subsequently modified by a chemical reaction such as intra- or inter-molecular cross-linking, polymerization, or the addition of chemical groups (e.g., poly alkylene oxides, or other adducts); or it may be recombinantly engineered. Human alpha- and beta-globin genes have both been cloned and sequenced. Liebhaber, et al, P.N.A.S. 77: 7054-7058 (1980); Marotta,e?
[0070] In addition to the aforementioned sources of hemoglobin, it has recently been found that horse hemoglobin has certain advantages as the oxygen carrying component in the compositions of the present invention. One advantage is that commercial quantities of horse blood are readily available from which horse hemoglobin can be purified. Another unexpected advantage is that horse hemoglobin exhibits chemical properties that may enhance its usefiilness in the blood substitutes of the present invention.<br>
[0071] Previous reports have indicated that horse hemoglobin auto-oxidizes to methemoglobin faster than human hemoglobin, which would make it less desirable as a blood substitute<br><br><br>
component. See, e.g., J.G. McLean and LM. Lewis, Research in Vet. Sci., 19:259-262 (1975). In order to minimize auto-oxidation, McLean and Lewis used a reducing agent, glutathione, after red blood cell lysis. However, the hemoglobin that is used to prepare the compositions of the present invention, regardless of whether the source of hemoglobin is human or horse, do not require the use of reducing agents to prevent auto-oxidation after red blood cell lysis. [0072] More recently, it has been reported that horse hemoglobin has an oxygen affinity that is different from that of human hemoglobin. See, e.g., M. Mellegrini, et al, Eur. J. Biochem., 268: 3313-3320 (2001). Such a difference would discourage the selection of horse hemoglobin to prepare blood substitutes that mimic human hemoglobin. However, when incorporated into the compositions of the present invention, no significant difference (less than 10%) in oxygen affinity between human and horse hemoglobin-containing conjugates is observed. [0073] Accordingly, contrary to these seemingly undesirable properties, in the compositions of the present invention, horse hemoglobin is equivalent if not superior to human hemoglobin. [0074] For use in the present invention, the HBOC has an oxygen affinity that is greater than whole blood, and preferably twice that of whole blood, or alternatively, greater than that of stroma-free hemoglobin (SFH), when measured under the same conditions. In most instances, this means that the HBOC in the blood substitute will have a P50 less than 10, and more preferably less than 7. In the free state, SFH has a P50 of approximately 15 torr, whereas the P50 for whole blood is approximately 28 torr. It has previously been suggested that increasing oxygen affinity, and thereby lowering the P50, may enhance delivery of oxygen to tissues, although it was implied that a P50 lower than that of SFH would not be acceptable. See Winslow, et al, in "Advances in Blood Substitutes" (1997), Birkhauser, ed., Boston, MA, at page 167, and U.S. Patent No. 6,054,427. This suggestion contradicts the widely held belief that modified hemoglobins for use as blood substitutes should have lower oxygen affinities, and should have P50s that approximate that of whole blood. Hence, many researchers have used pyridoxyl phosphate to raise the P50 of SFH from 10 to approximately 20-22, since pyridoxylated hemoglobin more readily releases oxygen when compared to SFH. [0075] There are many different scientific approaches to manufacturing HBOCs with high oxygen affinity (i.e. those with P50s less than SFH). For example, studies have identified the amino acid residues that play a role in oxygen affinity, such as B-93 Cysteine, and thus site-directed mutagenesis can now be easily carried out to manipulate oxygen affinity to the desired level. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,661,124. Many other approaches are discussed in U.S. Patent No. 6,054,427.<br><br><br>
Hemoglobin-Associated Toxicity<br>
[0076] Hemoglobin is known to exhibit autooxidation when it reversibly changes from the ferrous (Fe^"^ to the ferrie (Fe^*) or methemoglobin form. When this happens, molecular oxygen dissociates from the oxyhemoglobin in the form of a superoxide anion (O2-). This also results in destabilization of the heme-globin complex and eventual denaturation of the globin chains. Both oxygen radical formation and protein denaturation are believed to play a role in vivo toxicity of HBOCs (Vandegriff, K. D., Blood Substitutes, Physiological Basis of Efficacy, pages 105-130, Winslow et al., ed., Birkhauser, Boston, MA (1995).) [0077] With most HBOCs, there is a negative correlation between oxygen affinity and hemoglobin oxidation, i.e., the higher the oxygen affinity, the lower the rate of autooxidation. However, the effects of different hemoglobin modifications on oxygen affiiiity and the rate of autooxidation are not always predictable. In addition, the optimal balance between oxygen affinity and autooxidation rate is not well understood.<br>
[0078] The present invention relates, in part, to the unexpected finding that the PEG-Hb conjugates described herein exhibit very low rates of autooxidation. When measured as a rate of oxidation, this value should be as low as possible (i.e.,0.2% per hour of total hemoglobin, more preferably 0.1% per hour of total hemoglobin, at room temperature for at least 3 hours, and more preferably at least 10 hours. Thus, the HBOCs of the present invention remain stable during administration and/or storage at room temperature.<br>
Modifications of the Oxveen-Carrying Component<br>
[0079] In a preferred embodiment, the oxygen-carrying component is modified hemoglbbin. A preferred modification to hemoglobin is "surface-modification," i.e. covalent attachment of chemical groups to the exposed amino acid side chains on the hemoglobin molecule. [0080] Modification is carried out principally to increase the molecular size of the hemoglobin, most often by covalent attachment of polymeric moieities such as synthetic polymers, carbohydrates, proteins and the like. Generally, sj^thetic polymers are preferred. [0081] Suitable synthetic hydrophilic polymers include, inter alia, polyalkylene oxide, such as polyethylene oxide ((CH2CH20)n), polypropylene oxide ((CH(CH3)CH20)n) or a polyethylene/polypropylene oxide copolymer ((CH2CH20)n-(CH(CH3)CH20)n). Other straight.<br><br><br>
branched chain and optionally substituted synthetic polymers that wovld be suitable in the practice of the present invention are well known in the medical field.<br>
[0082] Most commonly, the chemical group attached to the hemoglobin is polyethylene glycol (PEG), because of its pharmaceutical acceptability and commercial availability. PEGs are polymers of the general chemical formula H(OCH2CH2)nOH, where n is generally greater than or equal to 4. PEG formulations are usually followed by a number that corresponds to their average molecular weight. For example, PEG-200 has an average molecular weight of 200 and may have a molecular weight range of 190-210. PEGs are commercially available in a number of different forms, and in many instances come preactivated and ready to conjugate to proteins. [0083] An important aspect of preferred embodiments of the present invention is that surface modification takes place when the hemoglobin is in the oxygenated or "R" state. This is easily accomplished by allowing the hemoglobin to equilibrate with the atmosphere (or, alternatively, active oxygenation can be carried out) prior to conjugation. By performing the conjugation to oxygenated hemoglobin, the oxygen affinity of the resultant hemoglobin is enhanced. Such a step is generally regarded as being contraindicated, since many researchers describe deoxygenation prior to conjugation to diminish oxygen affinity. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,234.903.<br>
[0084] Although in many respects the performance of surface modified hemoglobins is independent of the linkage between the hemoglobin and the modifier (e.g. PEG), it is believed that more rigid linkers such as unsaturated aliphatic or aromatic Ci to Cg linker substituents may enhance the manufacturing and/or characteristics of the conjugates when compared to those that have more flexible and thus deformable modes of attachment.<br>
[0085] The number of PEGs to be added to the hemoglobin molecule may vary, depending on the size of the PEG. However, the molecular size of the resultant modified hemoglobin should be sufficiently large to avoid being cleared by the kidneys to achieve the desired half-life. Blumenstein, et al, determined that this size is achieved above 84,000 molecular weight. (Blumenstein, et al., in "Blood Substitutes and Plasma Expanders," Alan R. Liss, editors. New York, New York, pages 205-212 (1978).) Therein, the authors conjugated hemoglobin to dextran of varying molecular weight. They reported that a conjugate of hemoglobin (with a molecular weight of 64,000) and dextran (having a molecular weight of 20,000) "was cleared slowly from the circulation and negligibly through the kidneys," but increasing the molecular weight above 84,000 did not alter the clearance curves. Accordingly, as determined by Blumenstein, et al., it is preferable that the HBOC have a molecular weight of at least 84,000.<br>
(s<br><br>
[0086] In one embodiment of the present invention, the HBOC is a "MalPEG," which stands for hemoglobin to which malemidyl-activated PEG has been conjugated. Such MalPEG may be further referred to by the following formula:<br>
[0087] Hb-(S-Y-R-CH2-CH2-[0-CH2-CH2]„-0-CH3)m	Formula I<br>
[0088] where Hb refers to tetrameric hemoglobin, S is a surface thiol group, Y is the succinimido covalent link between Hb and Mal-PEG, R is an alkyl, amide, carbamate or phenyl group (depending on the source of raw material and the method of chemical synthesis), [O-CH2-CH2]n are the oxyethylene units making up the backbone of the PEG polymer, where n defines the length of the polymer (e.g., MW = 5000), and O-CH3 is the terminal methoxy group.<br>
Crystalloid Component<br>
[0089] In one embodiment of the present invention, the blood substitute may also comprise a crystalloid. The crystalloid component can be any crystalloid which, in the form of the blood substitute composition, is preferably capable of achieving an osmolarity greater than 800 mOsm/1, i.e. it makes the blood substitute "hypertonic". Examples of suitable crystalloids and their concentrations in the blood substitute include, e.g., 3% NaCl, 7% NaCl, 7.5% NaCl, and 7.5% NaCl in 6% dextran. More preferably, the blood substitute has an osmolarity of between 800 and 2400 mOsm/1. The use of recombinantly produced hemoglobins in solutions with an osmolality between 300 - 800 mOsm/1 that further comprise a colloid (i.e. a molecule less diffusible than dextrose) have been previously reported. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,661,124. However, this patent teaches away from producing blood substitutes with osmolalities above 800, and suggests that the hemoglobin concentration should be between 6-12 g/dl. In contrast, the oxygen carrying efficiency of compositions of the present invention permit lower concentrations of hemoglobin to be used, such as greater than 6 g/dl or even greater than 4 g/dl. When the blood substitute further comprises a crystalloid and is hypertonic, the compositions of present invention may provide improved functionality for rapid recovery of hemodynamic parameters over other blood substitute compositions, which include a colloid component. Small volume highly hypertonic crystalloid infusion (e.g., 1-10 ml/kg) provides significant benefits in the rapid and sustained recovery of acceptable hemodynamic parameters in controlled hemorrhage. (See, e.g., Przybelski, R. J., E. K. Daily, and M. L. Bimbaum, "The pressor effect<br>
^1<br><br>
of hemoglobin — good or bad?" In Winslow, R. M., K. D. Vandegriff, and M. Intaglietta, eds. Advances in Blood Substitutes. Industrial Opportunities and Medical Challenges. Boston, BirkhSuser (1997), 71-85). Hypertonic crystalloid solutions alone, however, do not adequately restore cerebral oxygen transport. See D. Prough, et al, "Effects of hypertonic saline versus Ringer's solution on cerebral oxygen transport during resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock," J. Neurosurg. 64:627-32 (1986).<br>
Formulation<br>
[0090] The blood substitutes of the present invention are formulated by mixing the oxygen carrier and other optional excipients with a suitable diluent. Although the concentration of the oxygen carrier in the diluent may vary according to the application, and in particular based on the expected post-administration dilution, in preferred embodiments, because of the other features of the compositions of the present invention that provide for enhanced oxygen delivery and therapeutic effects, it is usually unnecessary for the concentration to be above 6 g/dl, and is more preferably between 0.1 to 4 g/dl.<br>
[0091] Suitable diluents (i.e., one which is pharmaceutically acceptable for intravenous injection) include, intra alia, proteins, glycoproteins, polysaccharides, and other colloids. It is not intended that these embodiments be limited to any particular diluent. Thus, it is intended that the diluent encompass aqueous cell-free solutions of albumin, other colloids, or other non-oxygen carrying components, and the aqueous solution has a viscosity of at least 2.5 cP. In some preferred embodiments, the viscosity of the aqueous solution is between 2.5 and 4 cP. It is contemplated that the present invention also encompasses solutions with a viscosity of 6 cP or greater.<br>
Applications<br>
[0092] A.       Clinical Applications<br>
[0093] It is contemplated that the present invention and its embodiments will be useful in applications where a rapid restoration of O2 levels or an increased O2 level or a replacement of O2 levels is clinically indicated. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,054,427. The numerous settings in which the methods and compositions of the present invention find use include the following:<br>
1^<br><br>
[0094] Trauma. An acute loss of whole blood can result in a fluid shift from the interstitial and<br>
intracellular spaces to replace the lost volume of blood while shunting of blood away from the<br>
low priority organs including the skin and gut. Shunting of blood away from organs reduces and<br>
sometimes eliminates O2 levels in these organs and results in progressive tissue death. Rapid<br>
restoration of O2 levels is contemplated as perhaps resulting in a significantly better salvage of<br>
tissues in patients suffering such acute blood loss.<br>
[0095] Ischemia. In ischemia, a particular organ (or organs) are "starved" for oxygen. Small<br>
sections of the organ, knovm as infarcts, begin to die as a result of the lack of O2. Rapid<br>
restoration of O2 levels is critical is stemming infarct formation in critical tissues. Conditions<br>
resulting in ischemia include heart attack, stroke, or cerbrovascular trauma.<br>
[0096] Hemodilution: In this clinical application, a blood substitute is required to replace blood<br>
that is removed pre-operatively. It is contemplated that the patient blood removal occurs to<br>
prevent a requirement for allogeneic transfusions post-operatively. In this application, the blood<br>
substitute is administered to replace (or substitute for) the O2 levels of the removed autologous<br>
blood. This permits the use of the removed autologous blood for necessary transfusions during<br>
and after surgery. One such surgery requiring pre-operative blood removal would be a<br>
cardiopuhnonary bypass procedure.<br>
[0097] Septic Shock. In overwhelming sepsis, some patients may become hypertensive in spite<br>
of massive fluid therapy and treatment with vasocontrictor agents. In this instance, the<br>
overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) results in the lowered blood pressure. Therefore<br>
hemoglobin is close to an ideal agent for treatment of these patients because hemoglobin binds<br>
NO with an avidity that parallels O2.<br>
[0098] Cancer. Delivery of O2 to the hypoxic inner core of a tumor mass increases its<br>
sensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Because the microvasculature of a tumor is<br>
unlike that of other tissues, sensitization through increasing O2 levels requires O2 be unloaded<br>
within the hypoxic core. In other words, the P50 should be very low to prevent early unloading<br>
of the O2, increasing the O2 levels, to insure optimal sensitization of the tumor to subsequent<br>
radiation and chemotherapy treatments.<br>
[0099] Chronic anemia. In these patients, replacement of lost or metabolized hemoglobin is<br>
compromised or completely absent. It is contemplated that the blood substitute must effectively<br>
replace or increase the reduced O2 levels in the patient.<br>
[00100]	Sickle cell anemia. In sickle cell anemia, the patient is debilitated by a loss of O2<br>
levels that occurs during the sickling process as well as a very high red blood cell turnover rate.<br><br><br>
The sickling process is a function of PO2 where the lower the PO2, the greater the sickling rate.<br>
It is contemplated that the ideal blood substitute would restore patient O2 levels to within a<br>
normal range during a sickling crisis.<br>
[OOIOIJ	Cardioplegia. In certain cardiac surgical procedures, the heart iis stopped by<br>
appropriate electrocyte solutions and reducing patient temperature. Reduction of the<br>
temperature will significantly reduce the P50, possibly preventing unloading of O2 imder any<br>
ordinary physiological conditions. Replacement of O2 levels is contemplated as potentially<br>
reducing tissue damage and death during such procedures.<br>
[00102]	Hypoxia. Soldiers, altitude dwellers, and world-class athletes under extreme<br>
conditions may suffer reduced O2 levels because extraction of O2 from air in the lung is limited.<br>
The limited O2 extraction further limits O2 transport. It is contemplated that a blood substitute<br>
could replace or increase the O2 levels in such individuals.<br>
[00103]	Organ Perfusion. During the time an organ is maintained ex vivo, maintaining O2<br>
content is essential to preserving structural and cellular intergrity and minimizing infarct<br>
formation. It is contemplated that a blood substitute would sustain the O2 requirements for such<br>
an organ.<br>
[00104]	Cell Culture. This requirement is virtually identical to that of organ perfusion,<br>
except that the rate of O2 consumption may be higher.<br>
[00105]	Hematopoiesis. It is contemplated that the blood substitute serves as a source for<br>
heme and iron for use in the sjmthesis of new hemoglobin during hematopoiesis.<br>
[00106]	B.        Veterinary Applications<br>
[00107]	The present invention can also be used in non-humans. The methods and<br>
compositions of the present invention may be used with domestic animals such as livestock and<br>
companion animals (e.g, dogs, cats, horses, birds, reptiles), as well as other animals in aquaria,<br>
zoos, oceanaria, and other facilities that house animals. It is contemplated that the present<br>
invention finds utility in the emergency treatment of domestic and wild animals suffering a loss<br>
of blood due to injury, hemolytic anemias, etc. For example, it is contemplated that<br>
embodiments of the present invention are useful in conditions such as equine infectious anemia,<br>
fehne infectious anemia, hemolytic anemia due to chemicals and other physical agents, bacterial<br>
infection. Factor IV fragmentation, hypersplenation and splenomegaly, hemorrhagic syndrome<br>
in poultry, hypoplastic anemia, aplastic anemia, idiopathic immune hemolytic conditions, iron<br>
deficiency, isoimmune hemolytic anemia, microangiopathic hemolytic, parasitism, etc. In<br>
-2tTr 1^<br><br>
particular, the present invention finds use in areas where blood donors for suiimals of rare and/or exotic species are difficult to find.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Production of Stroma-Free Hemoglobin<br>
Step-1 - Procurement of outdated red blood cells<br>
[00108]	Outdated packed red blood cells are procured from a commercial source, such as<br>
the San Diego Blood Bank or the American Red Cross. Preferably, outdated material is received not more than 45 days from the tune of collection. Packed RBCs (pRBCs) are stored at 4 ± 2°C until further processed (1-7 days). All units are screened for viral infection and subjected to nucleic acid testing prior to use.<br>
Step-2 - Pooling of outdated blood<br>
[00109]	Packed red blood cells are pooled into a sterile vessel in a clean facility. Packed<br>
red blood cell volume is noted, and hemoglobin concentration is determined using a commercially available co-oximeter or other art-recognized method.<br>
Step-3 - Leukodepletion<br>
[00110]	Leukodepletion (i. e. removal of white blood cells) is carried out using membrane<br>
filtration. Initial and final leukocyte counts are made to monitor the efficiency of this process.<br>
Step-4 - Cell separation and cell wash<br>
[00111]	Red blood cells are washed with six volumes of 0.9% sodium chloride. The<br>
process is carried out at 4 db 2 °C. The cell wash is analyzed to verify removal of plasma components by a spectrophotometric assay for albumin.<br><br><br>
Step-5 - Red blood cell lysis and removal of cell debris<br>
[00112]	Washed red blood cells are lysed at least 4 hours or overnight at 4 ± 2 °C with<br>
stirring using 6 volumes of water. Lysate is processed in the cold to purify hemoglobin. This is achieved by processing the lysate through a 0.16-jLim membrane. Purified hemoglobin is collected in a sterile depyrogenated vessel. All steps in this process are carried out at 4 ± 2°C.<br>
Step-6 - Viral removal<br>
[00113]	Viral removal is performed by ultrafiltration at 4 ± 2°C.<br>
Step-7 - Concentration and solvent exchange<br>
[00114]	Hemoglobin purified from lysate and ultrafiltration is exchanged into Ringer's<br>
lactate (RL) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) using a 10-kD membrane. The hemoglobin is then concentrated using the same membrane to a final concentration of 1.1 -1.5 mM (in tetramer). Ten to 12 volumes of RL or PBS are used for solvent exchange. This process is carried out at 4 ± 2°C. The pH of the solution prepared in RL is adjusted to 7.0-7.6.<br>
Step-8 - Sterile filtration<br>
[00115]	Hemoglobin in PBS or Ringer's lactate(RL) is sterile-filtered through a 0.45- or<br>
0.2-nm disposable filter capsule and stored at 4 ± 2°C before the chemical modification reaction is performed.<br>
[00116]	Other methods for purifying hemoglobin are well known in the art. In addition,<br>
the use of a reducing agent (e.g., glutathione or another thiol-containing reducing agent) to prevent auto-oxidation after cell lysis is usually unnecessary.<br><br><br>
Example 2 Modification of Stroma Free Hemoglobin<br>
Step-1 - Thiolation<br>
[00117]	Thiolation is carried out using 10-fold molar excess iminothiolane over<br>
hemoglobin for 4 hours at 4 ± 2°C with continuous stirring.<br>
[00118]	Reaction conditions:<br>
•	1 mM hemoglobin (tetramer) in RL (pH 7.0 - 7.5) or PBS (pH 7.4)<br>
•	10 mM iminothiolane in RL (pH 7.0 - 7.5) or PBS (pH 7.4)<br>
[00119]	The ratio of 1:10 SFH:iminothiolane and reaction timing were optimized to<br>
maximize the number of PEGylated thiol groups and to minimize product heterogeneity.<br>
Step 2 - PEGylation of thiolated hemoglobin<br>
[00120]	Thiolated hemoglobm is PEGylated using a 20-fold molar excess of Mal-PEG<br>
(with an alkyl or phenyl linker) based on starting tetrameric hemoglobin concentration. The hemoglobin is first allowed to equilibrate with the atmosphere to oxygenate the hemoglobin. The reaction takes place for 2 hours at 4 ± 2 °C with continuous stirring.<br>
[00121]	Reaction conditions:<br>
•	1 mM thiolated hemoglobin in RL or PBS (pH 7.4)<br>
20 mM Mal-PEG in RL or PBS (pH 7.4)<br>
Step 3 - Removal of unreacted reagents<br>
[00122]	PEGylated-Hb is processed through a 70-kD membrane to remove excess<br>
unreacted reagents or hemoglobin. A 20-volume filtration is carried out to ensure removal of" unreacted reagents, which is monitored by size-exclusion chromatography at 540 nm and 280 nm. The protein concentration is diluted to 4 g/dl. The pH is adjusted to 7.3 ± 0.3 using 1N NaOH.<br>
-23^<br>
27<br><br>
SteD-3 - Sterile filtration<br>
[00123]	The final MalPEG-Hb product is sterile-filtered using a 0.2-pm sterile disposable<br>
capsule and collected into a sterile depyrogenated vessel at 4 ± 2°C.<br>
Step-4 - Formulation of MalPEG-Hb<br>
[00124]	PEGylated Hb is diluted to 4 g/dl RL, pH adjusted to 7.4 ± 0.2<br>
Step-5 - Sterile fill<br>
[00125]	The final blood substitute composition is sterile-filtered (0.2 nm) and aliquoted<br>
by weight into sterile glass vials and closed with sterile rubber stoppers with crunped seals in a laminar flow hood and stored at -80°C until use.<br>
Example 3 Physiochemical Analysis of MalPEG-Hb<br>
Methodology for physicochemical analysis<br>
[00126]	Homogeneity and molecular size of the MalPEG-Hb blood substitute are<br>
characterized by Liquid Chromatography (LC). Analytical LC is used to evaluate homogeneity of the PEGylated hemoglobm and extent of removal of unreacted Mal-PEG. Absorbance at 540 nm is used to evaluate hemoglobin and resolves PEGylated hemoglobin fi-om unreacted hemoglobin by peak position. Absorbance at 280 nm is used to resolve PEGylated hemoglobin from free Mal-PEG, which absorbs in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum due to the ring structures in MalPEG.<br>
[00127]	Optical spectra are collected using a rapid scanning diode array<br>
spectrophotometer (Milton Roy 2000 or Hewlett Packard Model 8453) in the Soret and visible regions for analysis of hemoglobin concentration and percent methemoglobin by multicomponent analysis (Vandegriff, K.D., and R.E., Shrager. Evaluation of oxygen equilibrium binding to hemoglobin by rapid-scanning spectrophotometry and singular value decomposition. Meth. Enzymol. 232: 460-485 (1994).<br>

again after Hb PEGylation. Human hemoglobin contains 2 intrinsic reactive thiol groups at the P93Cys residues, which is confirmed by the dithiopyridme reaction. After thiolatioii of SFH at a ratio of 1:10 SFH: iminothiolane, the number of reactive thiol groups increases from 2 to 6 thiols based on the dithiopyridine reaction. After the PEGylation reaction, the number of reactive thiol groups is decreased to 1.3. This indicates that there are 4-5 PEGylated sites on MalPEG-Hb.<br>
Size-excluson chromatography analysis of MalPEG-Hb versus SFH<br>
[00132]	FPLC is performed for analysis of the final MalPEG-Hb product. Typical<br>
chromatograms are displayed in Figure 1 for MalPEG-Hb compared to unmodified SFH. The retention time for SFH is approximately 57 min. The retention time for MalPEG-Hb is approximately 44 min.<br>
Physical and chemical characteristics of MalPEG-Hb<br>
[00133]	The physical properties of MalPEG-Hb compared to blood and unmodified<br>
human hemoglobin (SFH) are shown below in Table 2.<br><br><br>
Oxygen affinity<br>
[00134]	Hemoglobin-oxygen equilibrium binding curves were measured as described<br>
previously (Vandegriff, K. D., R. K. Rohlfs, M.D. Magde, and R M. Winslow. Hemoglobinoxygen equilibrium cures measured during enzymatic oxygen consumption. Anal Biochem. 256: 107-116,1998). MalPEG-Hb exhibits a high oxygen affinity (P50 = 5 mm Hg) and low cooperativity (n50 = 1.0 -1.4). Figure 2 shows representative curves comparing stroma-free hemoglobin (SFH) and MalPEG-Hb solutions.<br>
Viscosity<br>
[00135]	This solution property of MalPEG-Hb is due to the strong interaction between<br>
polyethylene glycol chains and solvent water molecules. This is believed to be an important attribute for a blood substitute for two reasons: 1) higher viscosity decreases the diffiision constant of both the PEG-Efc molecule and gaseous ligand molecules diffusing through the solvent, and 2) higher viscosity increases the shear stress of the solution flowing against the endothehal wall, eliciting the release of vasodilators to counteract vasoconstriction. As shown in Table 2, the viscosity of the MalPEG-Hb solution is 2.5 cPs.<br>
Colloidal Osmotic Pressure rCOP')<br>
[00136]	The COP of hemoglobin solutions containing unmodified, intra- and<br>
intermolecularly cross-linked, or PEG-surface-conjugated hemoglobin have been measured to determine their macromolecular solution properties (Vandegriff, K.D., R. J. Rohlfs, and R. M. Wislow. Colloid osmotic effects of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers. In Winslow, R.M., K.D. Vandegriff and M. Intaglia, eds. Advances in Blood Substitutes Industrial Opportunities and Medical Challenges. Boston, Birkhauser, pp. 207-232 (1997). Tetrameric hemoglobins show nearly ideal solution behavior; whereas hemoglobins conjugated to PEG have significantly higher colloid osmotic activity and exhibit solution non-ideality (Vandegriff, K.D., M. Mcarthy, R.J. Rohls and R.M. Winslow. Colloid osmotic properties of modified hemoglobins: chemically cross-linked versus polyethylene glycol surface-conjugated. Biophys. Chem. 69: 23-30 (1997). As shown in Table 2, the COP of the MalPEG-Hb solution is 50.<br>
■p^-<br>
^<br><br>
Stability<br>
The stability of hemoglobin solutions containing PEG-surface-conjugated hemoglobin have been determined by examining the rate of autoxidation. At room temperature, the autoxidation of MalPEG-Hb increased fiom approximately 5% MetHb to 5.5 % MetHb in 10 hours as shown in Figure 5. The autoxidation rate for MalPEG-Hb was 0.05 % per hour.<br>
Example 4 Comparison of Modified Hemoglobins with Different P50s<br>
[00137]	The role of oxygen affinity in the efficacy of cell-firee hemoglobin using<br>
hemoglobin modified by conjugation to polyoxyethylene (POE) is of particular interest in studying the efficacy of such materials as blood substitutes. This modification, first described by Iwashita and coworkers (Ajisaka, K. and Y. Iwashita, "Modification of human hemoglobin with polyethylene glycol: A new candidate for blood substitute. BBRC 97: 1076-1081 (1980)) (Iwasaki, K., K. Ajisaka, and Y. Iwashita, "Modification of human hemoglobin with polyoxyethylene glycol: A new candidate for blood substitutes," Biochem Biophys Res Comm 97:1076-1981 (1980)), retains a hypertensive effect, and has been found to be useful in the treatment of septic shock. As part of the preparation of this product, hemoglobin was reacted with pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) to raise its P50, close to the value for human blood. Thus it was possible to prepare two solutions of POE-modified hemoglobin, one with and one without prior modification with PLP. These solutions are identical in every way except for their P50, and were tested for their ability to support physiological function in rats during a severe (60% of blood volume) hemorrhage.<br>
3^<br><br>
[00138]	Materials and Methods:<br>
Blood Substitutes<br>
[00139]	The modified hemoglobin solutions, with or without PLP modification to form<br>
"PHP" were prepared as described above in Example 1.<br>
Animals<br>
[00140]	Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used for this study. Systolic and diastolic<br>
pressures were monitored during the study; the maxunum and minimum pressures, respectively, and the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was diastolic + 1/3 (systolic-diastolic) pressure. The dP/dt was calculated from the maximum positive slope for each pressure cycle. Mean values of heart rate, systolic, diastolic, mean arterial pressures, pulse pressure and dP/dt were averaged for each minute of data.<br>
Blood gases, hematologic, and lactate measurements<br>
[00141]	Arterial pH, PCO2, and PO2 were measured in a blood gas analyzer using 100 \iheparinized samples of blood. Lactic acid was measured in artery blood using a Lactate Analyzer. Total CO2, standard bicarbonate (HCO3"), and base excess (BE) were calculated from PCO2, pH and hemoglobin concentration using algorithms described previously (Winslow, R., "A model for red cell O2 uptake,"- IntJClin Monit Comput 2: 81-93 (1985)). Total hemoglobin and plasma hemoglobin were each measured using commercially available equipment. Hematocrit was measured using approximately 50 |j,l samples of arterial blood by microcentrifligation.<br>
Exchange transfusion<br>
[00142]	Exchange-transfusion was carried out at a rate of approximately 0.5 ml/min to a<br>
total volume of solution that equaled 50% of estimated blood volume. Blood volume was assumed to be 65 ml/kg. The peristaltic pump was operated so that blood was removed at exactly the same rate as test material was infrised. Test solutions were warmed to 37°C in a water bath prior to infusion and kept warm during infusion.<br>
yf<br><br>
Hemorrhage<br>
[00143]	The hemorrhage protocol we used is based on the model of Hannon and Wade<br>
(Harmon, J., C. Wade, C. Bossone, M. Hvint, R. Coppes, and J. Loveday, "Blood gas and acid-base status of conscious pigs subjected to fixed-volume hemorrhage and resuscitated with hypertonic sali dextran," Circ Shock 32; 19-29 (1990)). Hemorrhage was begun approximately 3 minutes after completion of the exchange transfusion by pumping out arterial blood firom the femoral artery at a rate of 0.5 ml/min to remove 60% of the blood volume by the end of 60 minutes. Blood samples (0.3 ml) were taken every 10 minutes for hematologic and blood gas analysis.<br>
Statistical and survival analysis<br>
[00144]	For the survival analyses, animals were observed for a minimum of 120 minutes<br>
after the start of the hemorrhage. The data were grouped into 10-minute intervals, and for each interval the cumiilative proportion alive and its standard error were calculated.<br>
Results:<br>
Solution Properties<br>
[00145]	The solutions used are described below in Table 3. The total hemoglobin<br>
concentration, viscosity and colloid osmotic pressure (COP) are well-matched. The P50 of the PHP (19,7 Torr) was higher than that of the POE (12.2 Torr). The degree of cooperativity (Hill's parameter, n) were equivalent for the two solutions.<br>
The FPLC patterns for the two solutions are given in Figure 3. While there is a small peak m each that corresponds to unmodified hemoglobin, the bulk of the hemoglobin appears in a heterogeneous set of peaks that elute significantly earlier than the unmodified hemoglobin (SFH). The patterns for the two PEG-modified hemoglobins are qualitatively similar.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Mean arterial pressure diiring exchange transfusion<br>
[00150]	The mean arterial pressure during exchange transfusion is shown in Figure 6.<br>
Basehne mean arterial pressures are indistinguishable for the two groups. However, the blood pressure response to infusion of the PEG-hemoglobins is significantly dififerent between the two groups. The initial rise in MAP is greater in the PHP compared to the FOE animals, and it is sustained for the duration of the infusion period. In contrast, the MAP in the POE animals returns to baseline by the end of the infusion.<br>
[00151]	At the start of hemorrhage, the fall in MAP is immediate in the PHP animals and<br>
delayed in the POE group. Furthermore, the MAP is sustained at or near baseline values for the enthe hemorrhage and beyond for the POE animals, while the MAP never returns to baseline values in the PHP animals. Especially in the PHP animals, the scatter in the data, as indicated by increasing standard errors, increases with time as animals drop out of the PHP group.<br>
Discussion:<br>
[00152]	In this study, we studied 2 closely matched modified hemoglobin solutions<br>
("blood substitutes") with respect to their ability to protect rats from a severe (60% of blood volume) hemorrhage. In order to test this ability, animals first received a 50% (of blood volume) exchange transfusion with one of the two test solutions. The solutions themselves differed only in their oxygen affinity, and were matched very closely in FPLC pattern, oncotic pressure, viscosity and concentration. Other studies attempting to show the effects of specific variables on physiological outcomes have not been able to compare solutions as well matched. See e.g., Sakai, H., Hara, H., Tsai, A. G., Tsuchida, E., Johnson, P. C, and Intaglietta, M., "Changes in resistance vessels during hemonhagic shock and resuscitation in conscious hamster model," Am<br><br>
J.Physiol 276(45), H563-H571. (1999), Sakai, H., H. Kara, M. Yuasa, A. Tsai, S. Takeoka, E. Tsuchida, and M. Intaglietta, "Molecular dimensions of Hb-based O2 carriers determine constriction of resistance arteries and hypertension," .4m J Physiol 279: H908-H915, (2000). These experiments represent the first instance in which such closely matched solutions could be compared with only one variable, P50, being significantly different.<br>
[0CU53i._. The group ofanimals that caceiyed-Pi^^ had slightljUbiitjsignificantly, higher. -hematocrits, total hemoglobins and plasma hemoglobin levels. However, it is very unlikely that these differences can explain the outcome or interpretation of the experiments. Clearly, the two solutions affect blood pressure in different ways, as shown in Figure 4. At the tune of infusion, the effect on blood pressure must be a function of the properties of the infused solution, not the recipient animals. The blood pressure response is greater and sustained in the PHP compared to POE animals.<br>
[00154]	Survival of the animals is clearly not linked to the pressor effect of the<br>
hemoglobin solutions, as has been suggested by some investigators in the past, because survival (and a suggestion of less base deficit) is better in the POE compared to PHP animals, in which the blood pressure effect is less and only transient. See Przybelski, R. J., E. K. Daily, and M. L. Bimbaum, "The pressor effect of hemoglobin -- good or bad?" In Winslow, R. M., K. D. Vandegriff, and M. Intaglietta, eds. Advances in Blood Substitutes. Industrial Opportvmities and Medical Challenges. Boston, Bhkhauser (1997), 71-85.<br>
[00155]	Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that a lower P50 is beneficial<br>
for the use of cell-free hemoglobin as an oxygen carrier. The hypothesis is based on 2 concepts. First, that the diffusion gradient for cell-free hemoglobin is a function of the oxyhemoglobin gradient between the source of oxygen, the red cell, and the vessel wall. This gradient, in tum is dependent on the shape and position of the oxygen equilibrium curve (McCarthy, M. R., K. D. Vandegriff, and R. M. Winslow, "The role of facilitated diffusion in oxygen transport by cell-free hemoglobin: Implications for the design of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers," Biophysical Chemistry 92:103-117 (2001)). Second, this consideration leads to the second conceptual basis of our hypothesis, that high oxygen affinity (low P50) effectively "hides" O2 from the circulation until the carrier hemoglobin molecule arrives at regions of the circulation in which the PO2 is very low, such as in ischemic or hypoxic tissue.<br>
^4<br><br>
Example 5 Stability of MalPEG-Hb<br>
The purpose of this study was to determine the stability of MalPEG-Hb during a simulation of the storage and handling conditions of the samples for Phase I clinical trials. The stability during three stages of handling were assessed. Stage I represented the transfer fi-om frozen storage at the production facility to temperature conditions during shipping to the clinical site (frozen storage study). Stage II represented the thawing of the MalPEG-Hb for 24 hours to +4°C and subsequent storage at +4°C for five days (refiigerated study). Stage HI represented the thawing of the MalPEG-Hb for 24 hours to +4°C and subsequent storage of MalPEG-Hb at room temperature for several days prior to patient administration (room temperature study).<br>
Experimental Methods<br>
Stability was defined by the rate of oxidation of the MalPEG-Hb test material. The percentage of methemoglobin in the sample was measured using co-oximetty (IL Co-oximetry 682). Measurements were made in duplicate at each time point according to the protocol.<br>
Temperatures were monitored by thermometer or temperature chart recorders. The frozen storage study was conducted over a temperature range of-21.0 ± 3.0°C. The refrigerated study was conducted over a temperature range of+4.0 ± 0.2'C. The room temperature study was conducted over a temperature range of+21.0 ± 1.0°C.<br>
Temperature, total hemoglobin, and percent methemoglobin were recorded at each of the indicated time points. In the frozen and refrigerated studies, measurements were taken at time zero (completely thawed), one hour later, and then every 24 hours for five days. In the room temperature study, measurements were taken at time zero (completely thawed) and subsequently every one hour for ten hours.<br>
Results<br>
MalPEG-Hb showed no change in percent methemoglobin during 6 day storage at -20°C as shown in Figure 8. Similarly, MalPEG-Hb showed no change in percent methemoglobin during five day storage at +4°C as shown in Figure 9. During storage at room temperature, MalPEG-Hb showed less than 1 percent increase in methemoglobin over a ten hour period as shown in Figure 10.<br>
