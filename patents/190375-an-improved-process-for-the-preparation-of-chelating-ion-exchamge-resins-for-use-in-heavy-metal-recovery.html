				<td>This is an invention, which relates to an improved process for the preparation of chelating ion exchange resin for use in heavy metal recovery.<br>
This invention more particularly relates to an improved process for the preparation of copolymer resin having appropriate pendant group that can be adapted to introduce chelating functional groups which can be used for the recovery of metals. The invention also relates to a process for the production of chelating ion-exchange resins which involved preparing suitable copolymer with desired pendant group as a base resin adapted for the introduction of chelating functional groups and thereafter treating the resin so as to produce chelating ion exchange resins. These resins are needed for the commercial application in the efficient recovery of heavy metals from lean solutions particularly in alkaline medium.<br>
The performance and durability of the so needed chelating ion exchange resin in the above mentioned application is governed by the following characteristics:<br>
i.        The resin must be stable in strong alkaline solution<br>
ii.       The resin must withstand acid treatment for long duration<br>
iii. The resin must withstand particular range of temperatures namely 30°C -100°C which is normally realized from the heat generated from the reaction when highly alkaline and acid solutions are repeatedly used for adsorption and elution process respectively during heavy metal recovery.<br>
Hitherto, chelating ion exchange resins in which the ligands capable of forming complexes with heavy metal ions are produced commercially. They are chelate resins having iminodiacetic acid group, such as for example, Dowex A-1 (product of Dow chemical Co.) and Uniselec UR-10-50 (product of Unichika Co. Ltd) (imino diacetic acid derivative) and the chelate resin with amidoxime group such as Doolite ES-346 (Rohm and Haas, Canada, Inc.) (amidoxime derivative). These resins suffer from the following disadvantages:<br>
i.	poor efficiency in selective capturing of the adsorbed heavy metal ions, and<br>
in particular under strongly basic solution and<br>
ii.	poor reusability in acidic media.<br>
To overcome these difficulties, chelating ion-exchange resins particularly with hydroxamic acid functional group is reported to be prepared in non-aqueous medium employing carcinogenic and highly inflammable solvents which are difficult to be implemented in an environment - conscious industrial condition [ref: J. Polym. Sci. Chem.<br>
Ed. 14, 2155-2165, (1976) and Macromolecules 11, 597-603 (1978)]. Hence, the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of chelating ion exchange resins in aqueous medium based among the drawbacks highlighted above. The process proposed accordingly in the present invention is also simple and safe to produce chelating ion exchange on a commercial scale.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of chelating ion exchange resin for use in heavy metal recovery which comprises I) preparing the. copolymer resin with desired pendant group by suspension polymerization of the appropriate monomer such as herein described in the concentration ranges from 60 -90 wt%, along with a stabilizer and an initiator such as herein described at a temperature in the range of 60 - 85°C under stirring for a period upto 7 hrs, ii) treating the resulting copolymer resin with an aquous solution containing sodium acetate and hydroxylamine hydrochloride then isolating the resin beads formed by filtration and washing followed by drying at a temperature of 100-110°C for a period of 12-16 hours, after which the resin beads are soaked in benzene for 10-12 hours, iii) separated and refluxing the said resin beads in aqueous solution containing sodium acetate and hydroxylamine chloride in the ratio of Resin: Sodium acetate: Hydroxylamine hydrochloride as 1-3: 1-4: 1-5 wherein after treatment of copolymer resin is refluxed in a temperature range of 70-80°C for a period of 24-30 hrs, dried in an air oven at a temperature of 100-110°C for a period 10-20 hours to get the chelated ion exchange resin.<br>
According to a feature of the invention, a copolymer capable of forming a macromolecular network with the desired pendant group is prepared using suspension polymerization mode and the required chelating functional group, namely, hydroxamic acid is introduced into the resulting resin through after treatment of the copolymer resin.<br>
The formation of such a copolymer resin with the desired pendant group forms the first stage and the incorporation of chelating functional group into the preformed copolymer resin constitutes the second stage. Consequently, the basic copolymer resin can be made for introducing required chelating functional group according to the choice of heavy metal ions as per this invention and is presently illustrated for hydroxamic acid functional group as a chelating point in the ion exchange resin so produced in this invention.<br>
One characteristic feature of the present invention is the choice of monomer and co-monomer capable of forming copolymer resin with the required pendant group adaptable for<br>
the introduction of chelating functional group. The predominant monomer unit that constitutes the copolymer chain comprises form any of the monomers having pendant groups like acrylate, methacrylate, nitrite, carboxylic acid chloride, carboxylic amides, carboxylic anhydrides and the like monomers possessing any one of the above said groups. The co-monomer unit that constitutes the rest of the copolymer chain comprises form any one of the monomers like divinyl benzene, ethyl vinyl benzene and the like. The quantity of the monomer that constitutes the predominant part of the copolymer chain in the feed for copolymerisation should preferably be in the range 60-90 weight per cent and the quantity of co-monomer unit constituting the rest of the copolymer chain should preferably be in the range of 40-10 wt % thus making the total monomers feed composition in the co polymerization scheme as 100%.<br>
A further characteristic of the present invention is the use of aqueous medium in which the suspension polymerization is adopted using any one of the stabilizers among the water soluble polymers such as starch, polyvinyl-alcohol and the like. The use of such stabilizer helps in suspending the monomers in water in the form of fine droplets which are thus stabilized and prevented from coalescing. The preferred concentration of the stabilizer for this purpose should preferably be in the range of 1-10 wt % with respect to total weights of the monomers employed in the feed for copolymerization.<br>
Another characteristic of the present invention is the use of initiators which can be selected from any one of the free radical catalysts like benzoylperoxide, azo-bis iso butyronitrile, tert butyl peroxide and the like. The preferred concentration of such free radical initiators should be in the range of 0.2-0.8 wt % with respect to the total weight of the monomer mixture employed in the feed of copolymerization.<br>
Further characteristic of the present invention is the "after treatment" of the copolymer with reagent capable of introducing hydroxamic acid group under reflux condition in aqueous medium. The reagents that can be used for this purpose are sodium acetate and hydroxylamine hydrochloride and their preferred concentration should be in the ratio 1-3:1-4:1-5 with respect to the weight of preferred resin.<br>
An embodiment of the invention is now illustrated.<br>
Typically, the said chelating ion exchange resin is prepared* in two stages. The first stage consists of suspension polymerization of monomer having the desired pendant group<br>
suitable for the introduction of chelating groups along with the copolymerizable monomers such as divinyl benzene. Any one of the monomers hailing from the acrylic or vinyl family is mixed with an appropriate quantity of divinyl benzene along with the free radical initiator in the said ranges at room temperature and thus the feed for the suspension polymerization is made ready. This mixture is slowly added to the preformed solution comprising of the stabilizer like starch or polyvinyl alcohol or the like in the said composition kept in a reaction flask which is thermostated at 60-70°C, over a period of time ranging form 15 to 30 minutes. The reaction flask is necessarily provided with a reflux condenser and a mechanical stirrer capable of stirring at various speed. The speed of the stirrer during the addition of monomer mixture is maintained in the range of 1500-2000 rpm. After the addition of monomer mixtures is complete, he reaction temperature is slowly raised to 70-85°C over 15 minutes during which time the preset stiffing speed of 1500-2000 rpm is reduced to 800 rpm and the co-polymerization is allowed to proceed for 5-7 hours. The resultant polymer beads that are formed in the reaction flask are cooled, filtered and washed with hot water and then dried for 12-16 hours in a temperature range of 100-110°C.<br>
The copolymer beads of uniform particle size are soaked in benzene for 10-12 hours for "after treatment of resin", separated and added to the reaction vessel in which an aqueous solution containing sodium acetate and hydroxylamine hydrochloride constituted in the said concentration ranges. This "after treatment" is allowed to proceed under reflux in the temperature range of 70-80°C for a period of time ranging from 24-30 hours. After completion of the reaction, the polymer bead product formed is filtered, repeatedly washed with water and dried for a period of 10-20 hours in an air oven at a temperature range of 100-110°C. The chelating ion exchange resin thus obtained is further subjected to alkali and acid treatments.<br>
