BACKGROUND OF INVENTION WITH REGARD TO . DRAWBACKS IN PRIOR ART<br>
We know AYURVEDA as a very old stream of medical science. For treatment of various diseases various procedures cited above are described in Ayurveda. The Ayurveda describes the instrument for the procedure, which they were able to manufacture from the material available and the tools they had with them.<br>
Herebefore the Equipment are available in the form of :-A) TABLE<br>
A table made up of wood / plywood. The table has a border on all sides so that liquid poured on body does not spill out. It has a slope towards leg end in order to collect the liquid through a hole at that end. It has a headrest in which a container is carved out for collection of liquid., The patient is kept supine on the table. Processes like Snehan, Abhyanga in which liquid is applied to body by hand and processes like Netratarpan, Jaloukavacharan, in which no liquid is applied, are easily carried out. However during other processes following problems were faced :-<br>
1)	During Nasya Patient sleeping on table is asked to tilt his head by keeping pillow below the neck. Alternatively when a chair is used the position is achieved by the tilting back of the chair. The head has a little support &amp; legs of patient are kept hanging causing uncomfortable position.<br>
2)	During Niruh basti the bottle containing fluids is held by hand upwards to get the full drain.<br>
3)	In shirodhara the pot containing fluid is hanged from separate stand causing instability during oscillations of the pot. The liquid collected manually and heated in separate pot and again poured in pot. The liquid temperature is judged by inserting a finger in liquid. The flow control is done by wick in the hole of pot. The oscillations are given by hand which are not precise and liquid may fall by the side the head. To give contineous oscillations is painful to attending person<br>
4)	In Takradhara the liquid is electrically heated in a pot and is circulated on patient's<br>
body by a water pump. At the end of the process the pot is taken out for cleaning and<br>
all connections are removed and reconnected at the time of use. This results in to<br>
. inconvenience, spillage of liquid, Risk of electrical shock.<br>
5)	In sarwangdhara the liquid is collected manually through drain at leg end and heated in separate pot and again poured in pot from where it is poured on patient's body by hand. The temperature is judged by hand.<br>
6)	Ksharsutra is performed on table which is designed for delivery<br>
7)	After Uttarbasti the table becomes dirty due to out coming liquid.<br>
8)	In Shirobasti the patient is asked to sit on the chair / table and weight of oil on head . was transferred to neck &amp; backbone causing pain.<br>
9)	In Nadisweda patient is given steam from a pipe attached to pressure cooker kept on gas. The steam condenses in pipe forming water droplets in pipe. These drops block the pipe and pressure of steam increases. After some time when pressure increases further hot water drops comes out of pipe with pressurized steam and falls on patient's body. To avoid this a cloth is wound on tip of pipe, which enable to trap a few drops as most of them due to steam pressure, pass through the passage kept in cloth. Moreover some amount of steam is also absorbed by cloth.<br><br>
B)BOX A Swedan box made up of wood / plywood with doors for entry, &amp; Heaters.<br>
1)	During SarwangBashpaSweda patient is kept supine on perforated platform at the center of the box. Pots with water &amp; medicine are kept below the platform and are heated electrically. The steam generated is used to spread in the box on its own. There is concentration of hot steam just above the pot giving uneven heating. The patient has to ask the attendant to put off the heater when he feels hot and again to put on when required.<br>
2)	During Kutisweda the patient sits on a bench in vertical box. Room heaters are used to give dry heat. The temperature around the coils is very high &amp; patient receives temperature in gradient to various parts of the body depending upon their distance from the heater. The patient's head contineous to be in the hot chamber which is not recommended and is required to be covered by cloth<br>
C) CHAIR<br>
A chair with Toilet seat fitted in and having a stool collection Glass bottle below it, is used for virechan. The waste material collected in the bottle continues to be there during process causing odour. The waste material each time gets mixed with earlier and it is not possible to detect the difference and measure quantity each time. The bottle requires to be carried and cleaned manually causing in-convinece to staff. It is difficult for attendant / doctor to carry out the procedure for patient of opposite sex.<br><br>
DRAWBACKS IN PRIOR ART<br>
The above equipment have following disadvantages / problems<br>
1)	All the processes of heating of liquid are done manually without any control on its temperature &amp; flow rate. Once liquids are delivered on patients body, they are collected manually, heated in pots, transferred to table, if temperature is found beyond patients bearing capacity, it is allowed to cool thus wasting time,<br>
2)	The steam is delivered to patient in an uncontrolled manner<br>
3)	Separate table and stand used for the process, which reduce the stability.<br>
4)	Man hour requirements is high<br>
5)	Processes dependent on personal skill<br>
6)	Different tables / units used for processes increasing no of units and in turn their cost &amp; space required.<br>
7)	The units do not have procedural adjustments &amp; automation.<br>
8)	It is difficult to handle Patient's oily body from table to table.<br>
9)	The medicinal liquids are absorbed in the wood resulting in wastage &amp; increase in process cost.	<br>
10)	The absorption of liquids in wood smoothens the surface and wet body of patient slides on it with the strokes of liquid application making procedure lobourious for doctors and uncomfortable for patient.<br>
11)	The frequent handling of hot pots is risky and accident-prone.<br>
12)	Some procedures are performed in an uncomfortable and awkward situation<br>
These tools and equipment are obsolete and there is a need for integration of various equipment into a single integrated device to perform multiple operations. This will benefit in the following ways 1)  save space, time, manpower, cost, materials,  2) accuracy of controls on temperature, flow, speed etc<br>
3)	Quick availability of Steam / Hot air / hot liquids etc.<br>
4)	Reduce handling &amp; accidents<br>
5)	Offer comfort to patient, Doctors &amp; attendants<br>
6)	Reduce shifting of patient<br><br>

equipment to another by providing attachments to carry out various procedures, which<br>
when attached to any equipment shall convert that equipment to an equipment suitable to<br>
perform that procedure.	<br><br>
SUMMERY OF INVENTION<br>
The inventor has identified that the available equipment is inadequate for the treatment of patients &amp; have problems as cited above in prior art. The inventor has invented a novel apparatus having characteristic described in following specifications<br>
The present invention attains the stated objective by providing a multipurpose apparatus comprising of<br>
A) A supporting means to provide support to the body in a position as required in various procedures of Ayurvedic system of treatment of Human being. The means may have a fixed height base or height adjustable base. The top is either a tray with headrest for supporting the body in sleeping condition or a toilet seat with backrest for supporting the body in sitting condition.<br>
The equipment basically comprises of a tray, a headrest, base frame, and stool assembly.<br>
The tray has borders on all sides so that liquids poured on body do not spill out. The bottom of tray is raised at centerline along the length, which has resulted in a slope. This slope is effective for faster flow of fluids laterally away from patient's body. At the one end of tray a low level channel is created along the width of tray, which works as storage as well as passage for liquid. This channel has a slope towards center or a corner to speed up the flow of liquids. The lowermost point in channel is provided with a hole for draining liquid. The hole is provided with a threading around it to fix a pipe. The tray is provided with arrangement to attach following attachments<br>
1)  Ksharsutra / Uttarbasti Yantra,   2) Swedan Dome with control device<br>
3) Basti Yantra	'       4) Oil pump Unit for Shirodhara/ Pizchinchil<br>
5) Dhara Yantra	6) SarwangaDhara Yantra<br>
The Swedan Dome with control device is provided with arrangement to attach following attachments<br>
1)	Steam Generator for SarwangBashpaSweda / Nadisweda<br>
2)	Kutisweda Yantra<br>
At the other end of tray a contoured headrest is provided. The headrest is fixed to tray by a hinge mechanism in order to facilitate tilting of headrest. A mechanism is provided to adjust the degree of tilt. The numbers of positions of tilt are limited when ratchet mechanism is used and can be unlimited when rack pinion / Bush &amp; Rod / Hydraulic or Pneumatic cylinder is used. The headrest has borders on all sides so that liquids poured on headrest do not spill out. The bottom of headrest is given slope towards the fag end. The lowermost point in headrest is provided with a hole for draining liquid. The hole is provided with a threading around it to fix a pipe.<br>
The headrest is provided with arrangement to attach following attachments<br>
1)  Shirodhara Yantra	2) Automatic Shirodhara Yantra<br>
3) Oil pump Unit for Shirodhara /Pizchinchil	4) Dhara Yantra<br>
The tray top and headrest is coated with insulating material like fiberglass / PVC /Rubber in order to avoid thermal shocks to body during different seasons and absorption of liquids in the tray material. The surface of coating is slightly rough in order to resist slippage of patient's wet body during the procedure, with minimum restriction to the flow of liquid.<br>
The base frame is a stand with legs. The stand is preferably of knockdown type in order to facilitate transport and installation. The stand is provided with slope toward the end, which is away from headrest. This slope is useful to achieve fast drain of fluid towards drain hole.<br>
A stool assembly is provided at the bottom of table. It can be fixed on the long horizontal members of frame at bottom by locking knobs. This allows fixing stool assembly at any desired position along length and on either side of table. The stool assembly is characterized by a double step stool, which is fixed on sliding mechanism, which facilitates movement of stool in and out. The stool automatically gets locked at position outside table when it is moved out. This position is used to help patient to climb on the table. It is slided below the table when not in use after releasing the lock.<br><br>
This unit is called as Fixed Height Droni<br>
B) As an alternative a height adjustable base is provided to the tray with headrest.<br>
The tray is provided with four legs for keeping it on the ground. These legs act as locators while keeping on base. The tray is further provided with hooks to lock the tray on base<br>
As the tray and base are separable, it facilitates to move the base and tray separately, which can be moved through narrow passage and assembled at the site.<br>
The base Is a height adjustable and longitudinally tillable. The base is provided with a bottom frame with swiveling castor wheels. The castors are having braking arrangement to lock the wheel as well as swivel movement. The brakes when applied stops moving of the base. Two separate mechanisms are embedded on the bottom frame, which are used for height adjustment and longitudinal tilt of top frame with respect to bottom frame. These mechanisms are driven by hand operated screw / electrical motor / hydraulic cylinder / pneumatic cylinder. The longitudinal motion generated by these drives is transferred to a bottom-rotating pipe through links. The bottom rotating pipe intern actuates top rotating pipe through links. When height adjustment drive is operated the bottom rotating pipe at far end is rotated through link. This bottom rotating pipe intern actuates top rotating pipe above it through links and other bottom rotating pipe at drive end through links and tilt adjustment drive which act as a link. The rotating pipe at drive end also actuates top rotating pipe above it through links. This simultaneous actuation results in to change in height of top frame with respect to bottom frame. When tilt adjustment drive is operated it changes distance between two links attached to bottom rotating pipes and result in rotation of bottom rotating pipe at drive end. The rotating pipe at drive end actuates top rotating pipe above it through links. Since the other top rotating pipe is fixed, this up / down movement of top rotating pipe at drive end causes longitudinal tilt of top frame with respect to bottom frame.<br>
Another aspect of this mechanism is that the base is provided with a bottom frame with swiveling castor wheels. The castors are having braking arrangement to lock the wheel as well as swivel movement. The brakes when applied stops moving of the base. Two separate mechanisms are embedded on the bottom frame, which are used for height adjustment and longitudinal tilt of top frame with respect to bottom frame. These mechanisms are driven by hand operated screw / electrical motor /, hydraulic cylinder / pneumatic cylinder. When height adjustment drive is operated it moves the top frame up down with respect to bottom frame. When tilt adjustment drive is operated it changes distance between vertical pillars of height adjustment to drive end attached to top frame. The top frame rotates on a pivot just above vertical pillar. This results in longitudinal tilt of top frame with respect to bottom frame.<br>
Yet another aspect of this mechanism is that the base is provided with a bottom frame with swiveling castor wheels. The castors are having braking arrangement to lock the wheel as well as swivel movement. The brakes when applied stops moving of the base. Multiple vertical cylinders / screws are embedded on the bottom frame, which are used for height adjustment and longitudinal tilt of top frame with respect to bottom frame. These mechanisms are driven by hand operated screw / electrical motor / hydraulic cylinder / pneumatic cylinder. When height adjustment drive is operated all the vertical cylinders / screws / racks moves, moving the top frame up down with respect to bottom frame. When tilt adjustment drive is operated some of vertical cylinders / screws / racks moves, while others do not. Due to this the top frame rotates on a pivot just above vertical pillar. This results in longitudinal tilt of top frame with respect to bottom frame.<br>
The height adjustment is useful for loading the patient at low height and continue the procedure at a height convenient to the practitioners. The tilt is useful for achieving fast drain of fluids in various procedures. The height adjustment eliminates the need of stool assembly.<br>
The tray with headrest is fixed on the top frame by help of locking mechanism. The tray is kept on the top frame so that the legs are kept in the top frame of base. The lever that can be operated from both sides which when moved moves locking bar which in turn enter inside the<br><br>
locking hook of tray. This facilitates to move the base and tray separately, which can be moved through narrow passage and assembled at the site. Tray can be directly kept on floor on its: legs and used. This unit is called as Height Adjustable Droni.<br>
C) As a further alternative a Box type base is provided to the tray with headrest.<br>
The Box type base comprises of a box as base frame, Control panel and a stool assembly. The base for tray is a box type structure on which the tray with headrest is fixed by hinges along a length. The box is provided with slope toward the end, which is away from headrest. This slope is useful to achieve fast drain of fluid towards drain hole. Handles are fixed on other length for lifting. Below the hinge a support is provided to rest the tray in open position. The side below the handles is horizontally divided in two parts. The top part is fixed to lower one by hinges and held in vertical position by locks. Rotating through 180 degree on the lower one can open the top part. The lower part is having stool assembly, characterized by a double step stool, which is fixed on sliding mechanism, which facilitate movement of stool in and out. The stool can be locked at position outside table when it is moved out. This position is used to assist patient to climb upon the table. It is slided below the table when not in use. Near the level of the hinge of top part a middle frame having multiple holes is provided. An aperture for head is provided at one end of box near the level of middle frame. A headrest is provided near the level of middle frame, at the aperture, on exterior side of the box. This headrest is foldable when not in use. The chamber below middle frame has distribution pipe having holes of different size at different locations for effective and uniform distribution of steam in the Box. The hot air is sent inside the dome through holes and is distributed by air tunnels evenly within the box with the help of adjustable deflectors provided at various points. The temperature control device is useful for controlling inside temperature in SarwangBashpaSweda. The timer allows setting time of procedure. An ELCB is provided for safety in event of leakage of current This unit is called as Droni with Swedan Box<br>
D) As an alternative top is provided with toilet seat and a backrest for supporting the body in sitting position. It comprises of chair type construction having toilet seat, a view chamber, a flush valve, a cistern -and a seat cover<br>
The chair has cushioned back which has anatomically suitable adjustable angle for back of<br>
the patient during the process. A Seat with in built Commode module with smooth surface is<br>
provided. A Transparent cylinder having measuring marks is fitted below said commode module<br>
in such a way that waste material is collected in the cylinder. Waste material can be easily<br>
disposed off in the drainage by opening a valve below said cylinder by rotating the handle of<br>
