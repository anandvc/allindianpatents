CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application claims the priority of U.S.<br>
Provisional Patent Application Serial No. SO/429,276, filed<br>
November 25, 2002.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OP THE INVENTION<br>
(0002] The present invention relates in general to rotary<br>
power devices, and specifically to rotary actuators for use in<br>
automated machinery.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0003] Most automated mechanical systems developed today<br>
are built as unique custom one-off systems employing little or<br>
no standardized architecture. This one-off design methodology<br>
tends to result in systems exhibiting relatively high cost and<br>
a low rate of change and diffusion of new technology.<br>
[0004] Another undesirable effect of custom mechanical<br>
design methodology is rapid obsolescence. In general,<br>
operator interfaces are cumbersome, maintenance training is<br>
complex, and the logistics trail for maintenance is a<br>
permanent and expensive user obligation.<br>
[0005] Often, the designer of an automated mechanical<br>
system .is first faced with the design of a machine joint,<br>
which, owing to the relative absence of standardised machine<br>
joint solutions, must be performed beginning from basic<br>
structural components, such as plates, beams, and bearings.<br>
[0006] Given a machine joint of sufficient rigidity, the<br>
machine designer then moves to specification and selection of<br>
a prime mover, a power source for the prime mover, positional<br>
and velocity feedback sensors for the joint, a control system<br>
for the prime mover, all necessary wiring, and any necessary<br>
intermediate geartrain and power transmission elements.<br>
Generally, these components will be discrete components.<br>
Although certain components may be designed to interface with<br>
the related components, a relatively high degree of<br>
engineering effort must still be exerted to ensure that the<br>
various components will work together properly under a variety<br>
of operating conditions.<br>
[0007] One area in which integration has been effectuated<br>
with some degree of success is integration of the prime mover<br>
and the gear train. Modules incorporating both a prims mover<br>
and a gear train are known as "gearmotors" or "gearhead<br>
motors." Although somewhat successful, this integration has<br>
suffared from the use of inadequate gear train designs,<br>
thereby limiting the overall effectiveness of such modules.<br>
[O0O8] Development work in gear trains has been largely<br>
stagnant for many years, with the conventional wisdom being<br>
that all the science available has borne all the results that<br>
are feasible. Generally, system designers would prefer to<br>
eliminate the gear train entirely, along with its weight,<br>
backlash, noise, cost, and presumed complexity.<br>
[0009] Hypocyclic gear trains were first developed and<br>
patented in the late nineteenth century. A further surge in<br>
patenting occurred in the mid-1930s. Several industrial<br>
manufacturers presently produce gear transmissions using<br>
hypocyclic gear trains, but their designs mimic older designs,<br>
which contain many parts and bearings, a circuitous force<br>
path, and two opposing wobble plate gears, for balancing<br>
purposes. The balancing issue has limited, to a certain<br>
extent, the use of wobble gear designs/ but so long as the<br>
driving eccentric for these gears is relatively small, on the<br>
order Of 3% or lass, they can be well-balanced using modern<br>
methods of precision balancing.<br>
[0010] In some hypocyclic gear trains produced presently,<br>
only one wobble plate gear mesh is used. These designs use<br>
pins through the plates to transmit torque to the output<br>
plate, adding a further level of complexity and a number of<br>
dimensions having critical tolerances.<br>
[0011] For perhaps thirty years., a low level of interest<br>
has been shown in the design of hypocyclic motors with the<br>
claim that they produce high torque at low speeds. They do,<br>
but no one has heretofore found a satisfactory means to get<br>
that high torque to a concentric rotating output shaft.<br>
[0012] At least three principal variations of cycloidal<br>
drive gear trains currently exist. These include the designs<br>
produced by SUMITOMOâ„¢ (Japan), TEIJIN 3B1KI" (Japan) and<br>
ANDANTEXTM (France) . These designs all depend on dual wobble<br>
plate differencing gears, set 180 degrees out of phase for<br>
balancing, driven either by a precision cycloidal surface or a<br>
dual set of eccentrics. The force path for these devices<br>
between input and output is long and circuitous, requiring a<br>
large, and very heavy, hoop structure to keep all the forces<br>
contained.<br>
[0013] These devices use rollers on curved surfaces and<br>
cantilevered pins to provide the final drive to their output<br>
plates. Also, this type of drive is connected to a small<br>
output shaft supported by additional bearings. All of this<br>
adds considerably to the compliance and lack of rigidity of<br>
the gear train. Because of their unique geometry, complexity,<br>
volume and weight, these gear trains are very difficult to<br>
integrate into self-contained actuator modules.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014] As discussed above, automated mechanical systems are<br>
generally custom, one-off systems designed essentially from<br>
the ground up. The inventor of the standardized rotary<br>
actuator module described herein believes that the level of<br>
custom engineering required for the implementation of a motion<br>
contol system can be drastically reduced though the<br>
development and use of standardized modules of the type<br>
described herein.<br>
[0015] As a solution to the "custom design" dilemma for<br>
automated machines, the inventor suggests the implementation<br>
of an open architecture, using standardized building blocks<br>
including standardized actuators, links, end-effector tools,<br>
controllers, and related components, which can be assembled on<br>
demand and operated by standardised operating system software.<br>
[0016] To this end, the present invention is an integrated<br>
standardized rotary actuator incorporating a prime mover, a<br>
gear train, and a rotary machine joint in a single package.<br>
These elements are integrated into a single self-contained<br>
module that is easily scalaable to meet a wide variety__of<br>
application demands. The rotary actuator may incorporate as<br>
few as five principal parts fitted with a minimum of critical<br>
tolerances, resulting in a system that is substantially<br>
insensitive to tolerance and temperature variations.<br>
[0017] In certain embodiments, the rotary actuator modules<br>
of the present invention may be produced in standardized<br>
geometries and sizes. An appropriate set of standardized<br>
sizes facilitates the standardization of machine architecture<br>
accordingly. This standardization enables the machine<br>
designer to assemble or reconfigure machines on demand, in a<br>
similar manner to that employed presently for the<br>
configuration of personal_ computers. The use of standards<br>
enables the diffusion of new technology, tending to increase<br>
performance while decreasing costs.<br>
[0018] One object of the present invention is to create a<br>
standardized rotary actuator which can be mass produced at low<br>
cost, low weight and low volume, and still maintain a high<br>
level of performance- Various levels of ruggednessâ€” for<br>
example, light, medium, and heavyâ€”may be developed for<br>
various applications.<br>
[0019] The present invention is a new high-performance<br>
rotary actuator in a variety of embodiments sharing certain<br>
characteristic features. Xn general, a high level of<br>
performance can be preserved even for low cost versions of the<br>
present invention. Depending on the application, each of the<br>
embodiments incorporates features generating one or more of<br>
certain advantages.<br>
[0020] The novel design of certain embodiments of the<br>
present invention provide simplicity of design using a minimal<br>
number of parts and a minimized list of parameters, thereby<br>
allowing for a relatively small form . factor exhibiting<br>
exceptional compactness, stiffness and load capacity, along<br>
with quiet and efficient operation. They can be designed for<br>
easy assembly, ideal for mass production at various quality<br>
levels.<br>
[0021] Certain embodiments of the present invention may be<br>
especially useful in low speed and high torque applications of<br>
the type found in dextrous machines having complex duty<br>
cycles. Examples of these types of applications include those<br>
found in robots, manufacturing cells and aircraft actuators.<br>
[0022] The rotary actuators described herein have the<br>
potential to be more compact, simpler, more easily assembled<br>
and less expensive than any rotary actuator developed before.<br>
These devices may also be configured to exhibit lower inertia<br>
and provide higher stiffness than any rotary actuator<br>
developed before.<br>
[0023] Xn a first embodiment, the present invention is a<br>
rotary actuator incorporating an actuator shell having a<br>
planetary cage disposed therein. A prime mover having a first<br>
prime mover portion rigidly fixed to the actuator shell and a<br>
second prime mover portion, adjacent to, and movable with<br>
respect to, the first prime mover portion, is rigidly fixed to<br>
the planetary gear cage. A cross-roller bearing locates an<br>
output attachment plate within the shell. A shell gear is<br>
rigidly fixed to the actuator shell and an output gear is<br>
rigidly fixed to the output attachment plate. One or more<br>
planetary gears, disposed in the planetary cage, each have a<br>
first gear portion meshed to the shell gear and a second gear<br>
portion, adjacent to the first gear portion, meshed to the<br>
output gear.<br>
[0024] In a second embodiment, the present invention is a<br>
rotary actuator incorporating an actuator shell with an<br>
eccentric cage and. prime mover disposed therein. One portion<br>
of the prime mover is rigidly fixed to the shell, while a<br>
cross-roller bearing secures an output attachment plate within<br>
the shell. A shell gear is rigidly fixed to the actuator<br>
shell, and an output gear is rigidly fixed to the output<br>
attachment plate. An eccentric, disposed about the eccentric<br>
cage, has a first gear portion meshed to the shell gear and a<br>
second gear portion, adjacent to the first gear portion,<br>
meshed to the output gear.<br>
[0025] In a third embodiment, the present invention is a<br>
rotary actuator incorporating an actuator shell having a prime<br>
mover and a two stage planetary gearset disposed therein. The<br>
prime mover is connected to rotate the planet gear cage of the<br>
first stage of the gearset with respect to the actuator shell.<br>
A shaft, having a shaft gear rigidly fixed thereto, ia<br>
disposed within the actuator shell.<br>
[0026] Also in this third embodiment, a second planetary<br>
gear cage, rotatable with respect to the first planetary gear<br>
cage and the shaft, has a cage gear rigidly fixed thereto.<br>
One or more first stage planetary gears disposed in the first<br>
planetary gear cage, each have a first gear portion meshed to<br>
the shaft gear and a second gear portion, adjacent to the<br>
first gear portion, meshed to the cage gear. A cross-roller<br>
bearing secures an output attachment plate within the shell.<br>
[0027] In order to facilitate the communication of<br>
mechanical power out of the actuator, a shell gear is rigidly<br>
fixed to the actuator shell and an output gear is rigidly<br>
fixed to the output attachment plate. Finally, one or more<br>
second stage planetary gears are disposed in the second<br>
planetary gear cage, each having a first gear portion meshed<br>
to the shell gear and a second gear portion, adjacent to the<br>
first gear portion, meshed to the output gear.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0023] While the making and using of various embodiments of<br>
the present invention are discussed in detail below, it should<br>
be appreciated that the present invention provides many<br>
applicable inventive concepts, which can be embodied in a wide<br>
variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments<br>
discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific ways to<br>
make and use the invention and do not delimit the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
[0030] Certain embodiments of the present invention are<br>
standardized rotary actuators which can be mass produced at<br>
low cost and still maintain a high level of performance.<br>
Various levels of ruggednessâ€”for example, light, medium, and<br>
heavy-may be employed for various applications. In fact,<br>
certain of the actuator concepts described herein will be<br>
found sufficiently rugged in their basic design that parts<br>
made of plastic or formed metal can be used to reduce cost<br>
"while still providing a highly-versatile actuator useful in a<br>
variety of applications. These applications may include, but<br>
are not limited to, portable tools, educational robots, toys,<br>
and automobiles.<br>
[0031] The present invention is a new high-performance<br>
rotary actuator in a variety of embodiments sharing certain<br>
characteristic features. Depending on the application, each<br>
of the embodiments incorporates features generating one or<br>
more of certain advantages.<br>
[0032] The novel design of certain embodiments of the<br>
present invention provide simplicity of design using a<br>
relatively small number of parts and a minimized list of<br>
parameters/ thereby allowing for a relatively small form<br>
factor exhibiting exceptional compactness/ stiffness and load<br>
capacity/ along with quiet and efficient operation. They are<br>
designed for easy assembly, ideal for mass production at<br>
various quality levels.<br>
[0033] In general, these actuators are of exceptionally<br>
rugged design exhibiting relative inaensitivity to<br>
temperature and tolerance effects. The actuators of the<br>
present invention incorporate a relatively short force path<br>
across a high-Stiffness cross roller bearing, thereby<br>
maximizing stiffness and strength. In certain embodiments,<br>
the actuators of the present invention incorporate<br>
standardized attachment architetures.<br>
[0034] In order to promote standardization/ the rotary<br>
actuator of the present invention can be configured to serve<br>
as a standardized building block within a ystem. such a<br>
building block may, for example, be intelligent and adaptable,<br>
provide for a maximum performance envelope, be compact and<br>
rugged, be optimized in its structural design, provide<br>
standardized interfaces for quick replacement by technicians<br>
anywhere in the world, and be produced in large enough<br>
quantities to take advantage of economies of scale in<br>
manufacturing.<br>
[0035] Prime mover requirements may be met either by D.C.<br>
brushlesa motors or switched reluctance motors, either in<br>
cylindrical or pancake format. The gear trains may be made<br>
unique, compact, rugged and cost effective under production in<br>
large quantities.<br>
[0036] In certain embodiments, cross-roller bearings are<br>
used to form the joint bearings themselves. Cross-roller<br>
bearings are selected not only for their stiffness but also<br>
owing to their proper geometric configuration. In certain<br>
embodiments/ the cross-roller bearing acts as the principal<br>
gear train bearing at the same time. Precision large and<br>
small-scale actuators can be used separately or combined to<br>
satisfy demanding positional accuracy requirements.<br>
[0037] In manufacturing cells, the rotary actuator modules<br>
of the present invention may be used directly as simple<br>
transfer devices, drivers of conveyers, or joint actuators in<br>
2 degree-of-freedom manipulators. At the other end of the<br>
complexity continuum, highly dextrous manipulators having 10<br>
degrees of freedom and above can be assembled on demand. Each<br>
of the above systems could be assembled as needed, all with<br>
the same interfaces, and all with the same maintenance<br>
requirements, perhaps from only 5 basic sizes in each cell<br>
application, and all driven by one universal software package <br>
to reduce cost increase performance, and to open up the<br>
architecture of such system.<br>
Figure 1<br>
[0038] Figure 1 depicts an isometric cutaway view of a<br>
rotary actuator 100 in accordance with one embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Rotary actuator 100 shown in Figure 1 may<br>
be configured to be vary rugged, having high levels of both<br>
stiffness and shock resistance.<br>
[0039] A rotary actuator such as rotary actuator 100 can<br>
have a number of geometrical configurations. In one such<br>
configuration, a rotary actuator has a "pancake" geometry,<br>
being relatively narrow in thickness along its centerline and<br>
relatively large in diameter. Rotary actuator 100 shown in<br>
Figure 1 has such a geometry. In alternate embodiments, a<br>
rotary actuator may have a "coffee can" geometry, being<br>
relatively wide along the centerline and relatively small in<br>
diameter. Rotary actuator 200 shown in Figure 2 has this type<br>
of geometry.<br>
[0040] Generally, the pancake version is driven by a<br>
switched reluctance motor (SRM) and optimized to produce<br>
higher torques at lower speeds. The "coffee can" version is<br>
generally optimized for use in slim/dexterous machines such as<br>
serial robot manipulators. This version is usually driven by<br>
a brushless D.C. motor of somewhat lower torque and higher<br>
speed ranges as compared to the SRM.<br>
[0041] In general, it is desirable to satisfy as many<br>
design objectives as possible while at the same time<br>
minimizing complexity. This combination of design criteria<br>
argue in favor of combining functions when possible- In<br>
certain embodiments, the rotary actuator of the present<br>
invention is constructed so as to not merely provide rotary<br>
power to a joint, but to function as the joint itself,<br>
incorporating sufficient structural rigidity as to make<br>
additional rotary bearing structure extraneous.<br>
[0042] In certain embodiments, the incorporation of quick-<br>
change interfaces into the input/output attachment structures<br>
of the rotary actuators provides the designer with the ability<br>
to assemble machines on demand. The geometry of one<br>
embodiment of such a quick-change interface is described in<br>
detail in connection with Figure 8, below. In certain<br>
embodiments, the self-contained actuator may incorporate 80%<br>
or more of the machine"s complexity, including electronics,<br>
brakes, buses, sensors, bearings, motor, gear train, and all<br>
necessary attachments and interfaces.<br>
[0043] Rotary actuator 100 makes use of internal bull gear<br>
104 and sun gear 106 as part of the attachment components of<br>
the rotary actuator 100, separated by a principal cross roller<br>
bearing 108. The bull gear 104 and sun gear 106 are driven by<br>
planet gears 110 and 112 supported by bearings 114 on press<br>
fit shafts 116 passing through the sides of the planet cage<br>
118.<br>
[0044] Because the bull gear 104 and sun gear 106 are part<br>
of the structure of the rotary actuator 100, the required<br>
weight goes down while the stiffness goes up. Also, because<br>
this design employs a large diameter cross-roller bearing 108,<br>
the structural stiffness of the rotary actuator 100 is also<br>
greatly improved. In certain embodiments, the bearing races<br>
can be machined directly into the bull gear 104 and / or sun<br>
gear 106 so as to improve the structural integrity of the<br>
design. A ball bearing may be used in place of cross-roller<br>
bearing 108 in less-demanding applications. Accordingly, the<br>
structure of the rotary actuator 100 can be made much smaller,<br>
lighter in weight, and more cost effective, through a<br>
reduction in the number of parts and simplified assembly. The<br>
planets 110 and 112 may be used in a Ferguson paraox gear<br>
train mechanism to further improve manufacturing simplicity.<br>
[0045] Magnet disk 120 of the prime mover 122 is rigidly<br>
attached to the planet cage 118 to form the simplest possible<br>
configuration between the prime mover 122 and the gear train<br>
124. Planet cage 118. and magnet disk 120 are supported by<br>
bearing 12 â‚¬ in the bull gear 104 and needle bearings 128 on<br>
stationary shaft 130. This design provides a very rugged<br>
support for the moving structure of rotary actuator 100 so as<br>
to best resist shock.<br>
[0046] Planet cage 118 can be made lighter in order to<br>
reduce inertia in cases where additional responsiveness is<br>
desirable. The number of planets 110 and 112 may be as small<br>
as 2 or as large as 9 depending on the relative dimensions,<br>
speed, desired stiffness, inertia requirement, tooth sizing<br>
required for loading, and other factors.<br>
[0047] Bearing 132 on shaft 130 is used to provide<br>
additional support to the output attachment plate 134 of<br>
rotary actuator 100. Where stiffness is an important<br>
consideration, the attachments to the neighboring structures<br>
on shell 102 and plate 134 may be placed in close proximity to<br>
bearing 108 in order to maximize the resulting structural<br>
stiffness of the system. In rotary actuator 100/ field 136 is<br>
larger than magnet disk 120. This additional size<br>
accommodates end turns in the field 136.<br>
Figure 2<br>
[0048] The switched reluctance motor (SRM) geometry shown<br>
in Figure 1 is designed to maximize torque, and this design<br>
may be optimized for applications wherein high rotational<br>
speed is not a principal concern. A wide variety of aspect<br>
ratio considerations may be met employing both the SRM and DC<br>
prime movers. Given a cylindrical primÂ© mover such as a D.C.<br>
brushless motor of higher relative speed and lower relative<br>
torque as compared to the switched reluctance motor, the<br>
geometry of actuator 100 can be modified into a coffee can<br>
geometry having all the other attributes of the pancake-shaped<br>
rotary actuator 100. Such an actuator is shown in Figure 2<br>
and generally designated 200.<br>
[0049] In one embodiment/ rotary actuator 200 may operate<br>
at speeds as much as ten times higher, but produce ten times<br>
less torque, than rotary actuator 100 of Figure 1. In rotary<br>
actuator 200, there is a much higher concern for inertia in<br>
the moving structure and less concern for stress in the gear<br>
[0050] figure 2 depicts rotary actuator 200 in an isometric<br>
cutaway view. Rotary actuator 200 is typically longer than<br>
rotary actuator 100, and there is more concern for the<br>
stiffness of the planet cage 218. Accordingly, additional<br>
support is provided by bearing 226, embedded in the stiff<br>
attachment shell 202 of actuator 200. In order to simplify<br>
the design of rotary actuator 200, the planets 210 and 212 are<br>
supported by bearings 214 which ride on shafts 216, which are<br>
press fit into the planet cage 218 to further increase the<br>
stiffness of planet cage 218.<br>
[00S1] The output attachment plate 234 and central<br>
stationary shaft 230 are mutually supported by bearing 232.<br>
Generally, because of higher velocities in the D.C. motor, the<br>
structure of the planet cage 218 will be lightened to reduce<br>
inertia and the bearings 208, 214, and 226 will be chosen for<br>
this higher velocity regime.<br>
[0052] As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art,<br>
additional planets tend to increase stiffness, reduce<br>
backlash, and improve positional accuracy at the expense of<br>
complexity and increased inertia. Large gear train ratios<br>
require the use of multiple stages or Fergeson Paradox type<br>
epicyolic gear trains. Generally, the planet gear cage will<br>
represent the most complex part of the rotary actuator, adding<br>
to cost, complexity, and assembly issues.<br>
[0053] In alternate embodiments, compound gears can ba used<br>
in certain cases. Such gear trains incorporate, however,<br>
inherent limitations. These types of gear trains can give a<br>
realistic reuction of no greater than 10 to 1 further<br>
these gear trains tend to exhibit considerable backlash and<br>
have high rotary inertia. Finally, they are insufficiently<br>
rigid in rotary compliance, are heavy and are not space<br>
efficient.<br>
[0054] Accordingly, epicyclic gear trains are better for<br>
rotary actuators because of their compatible geometry to the<br>
rotary prime mover. Unfortunately, these gear trains exhibit<br>
limitations as well. The maximum realistic gear reduction of<br>
such a mechanism is on the order of 160:1. Compound epicycle<br>
gear trains can, of course, provide reductions higher than<br>
100:1 through the use of multiple stages. Compound gear<br>
trains, however, incorporate the limitations described above.<br>
In general, epicyclic gear trains exhibit a significant degree<br>
of backlash, require high tolerances, and are temperature<br>
sensitive. In fact, backlash generally must be designed in to<br>
account for tamperaturs-related dimensional changes. Finally,<br>
the involute gear teeth used in epicyclic gear trains are<br>
often designed to be relatively tall, in order to maintain<br>
between one to two teeth in mesh. This geometry increases the<br>
loading at the root as well as sliding velocity, reducing both<br>
the strength and the efficiency of the mechanism.<br>
[0055] In order to overcome the above limitations of<br>
epicyclic gear trains, elements are described below employing<br>
a single planet driven by an eccentric to make a "wobble"<br>
plate design while satisfying all the kinematic requirements<br>
normally associated with epicyclio gear trains.<br>
Figure 3<br>
[0056] One object of the present invention is to make the<br>
standardized electro-mechanical actuator a simple continuum of<br>
deaign choices among switched reluctance or brushleas D.C.<br>
motors and multi-planet or eccentric single planet hypocyclic<br>
gear trains. Ideally, each choice can be considered as a<br>
plug-in substitute for the other with no other primary design<br>
changes.<br>
[0057] Accordingly, certain embodiments of the present<br>
invention may incorporate a single eccentric planet gear train<br>
in place of the multi-planet gear train used in Figures 1 and<br>
2. The eccentric hypocyclic gear train incorporates a number<br>
of advantages, as described below.<br>
[0058] In many embodiments, the actuators of the present<br>
invention incorporate a hypocyclic gear train, which may have<br>
a gear reduction ratio as high as 5000:1. These hypocyclic<br>
gear train assemblies may incorporate relatively short<br>
circular arc gear teeth, with up to 15 or more teeth in<br>
contact at a time.<br>
[0059] The unique design characteristics of the hypocyclic<br>
gear- trains provide reduced contact stresses, reduced bending<br>
stresses, lower sliding velocity, reduced energy loss, and the<br>
potential for preloading the mesh as the tooth comes into its<br>
central position.<br>
[0060] Bach gear tooth can be profiled to be slightly<br>
preloaded as it cornea into its central position, in order to<br>
reduce the generation of lower-order harmonics and control<br>
backlash and lost motion. This preloading can be accomplished<br>
through the introduction of a slight interference between that<br>
tooth and the mating teeth as that tooth conies into its<br>
central position. In certain embodiments, a cavity may be "<br>
introduced within each tooth in order to tailor the stiffness<br>
of the teeth and reduce closing noise.<br>
[0061] Circular tooth profile gear trains exhibit a reduced<br>
degree of wear and noise, smooth and gradual load transfer<br>
among the teeth, and a reduced or eliminated necessity for<br>
critical tolerances, as circular are teeth do not require the<br>
critical tolerances generally associated with involute teeth.<br>
A circular tooth profile can also exhibit increased strength,<br>
as clearances for external involute teeth are not required.<br>
Finally, in certain embodiments, a reduction in the sliding<br>
velocity between the mating gear teeth reduces the frictional<br>
losses within the mechanism.<br>
[0062] Figure 3 depicts a cutaway isometric of a rotary<br>
actuator 300 incorporating an eccentric hypocyclic gear train.<br>
Rotary actuator 300 incorporates a central stationary shaft<br>
330 holding support bearings 328 that support the rotating<br>
motor armature 320 that drives the eccentric 218. Support<br>
bearings 314 on the eccentric 218 drive the wobble cylinder,<br>
which contains the planetary gears 310 and 312 that mesh with<br>
the bull gear 304 and sun gear 306 separated by the principal<br>
cross roller bearing 308.<br>
[0063] Bull gear 304 is attached directly to the shell 302<br>
of rotary actuator 300 while sun gear 306 is attached directly<br>
to the output attachment plate 334. The motor armature 336 is<br>
also held stationary by the actuator shell 302. End plate<br>
screws (not shown) assist in making the assembly rather<br>
direct, holding the stationary shaft 330 for support bearings<br>
328.<br>
[0064] Bearing 332 in the output attachment plate 334<br>
supports the end of the stationary shaft 330. Seal 338<br>
separates the output attachment plate 334 from the shell 302<br>
and protects the cross roller bearing 308 from the elements.<br>
This design incorporates an additional bearing 326 to support<br>
the motion and force variation on the eccentric 318.<br>
[0065] Rotary actuator 300 is notable for its inherent<br>
simplicity. The motor field 336 and armature 320, eccentric<br>
318, planetary gears 310 and 312, bull and sun gears 304 and<br>
306 and the principal roller bearing 308 are the primary<br>
components of rotary actuator 300. Secondary components<br>
include bearings 328, 332 and 326. The remainder are<br>
stationary, machined components.<br>
[0066] Even though rotary actuator 300 is able to provide<br>
very high power density in a very small package, it can be<br>
adapted to a wide range of application requirements by means<br>
of minor design changes, such as numbers of gear teeth, motor<br>
winding characteristics and current and voltage levels, as<br>
examples. The inherent simplicity and versatility of rotary<br>
actuator 300 enables mass production of most of the<br>
subcomponents, thereby providing economies of scale and<br>
attendant cost reductions. The characteristics of a<br>
particular embodiment of rotary actuator 300 may be scaled to<br>
one of a number of pre_selected standardized sizes, in order<br>
to provide an "off-the-shelf" solution to the system designer.<br>
In one example of a standardized set of such actuators,<br>
sixteen separate standardized scaled actuators can be provided<br>
to meet a wide range of design applications. A set of<br>
actuators of the type shown in Figure 3 may be constructed<br>
according to standard sizes. As one example, a set of sixteen<br>
actuator sizes spanning from 0.25" diameter up to 45" in<br>
diameter could support the construction of a large population<br>
of machines, rapidly assembled and made operational as needed.<br>
[0067] Simplicity not only brings with it lower cost, it<br>
also results in components that are forgiving in their design,<br>
manufacture and operation. In particular, rotary actuator 300<br>
should be relatively insensitive to rather large variations In<br>
temperature.<br>
[0068] The use of a hypocyclic gear train wherein up to<br>
fifteen gear teeth or more ,can be in contact at a given time <br>
brings with it the ability to carry very heavy loads<br>
eliminate backlash, minimise lost motion, and resist high<br>
levels of shock with relatively modest levels of gear tooth<br>
stress, thereby providing both high endurance and reduced<br>
wear.<br>
[0069] The number of design parameters is rather low. They<br>
are, to a great extent, independent choices, and each has<br>
clear and explicit meaning to the designer. Hence, not only<br>
is rotary actuator 300 exceptional in performance in terms of<br>
weight, volume, endurance, output inertia, and power density,<br>
it is easily understood by most designers, helping to assure<br>
its acceptance in the design community.<br>
[0070] As described above, the eccentric offset e within<br>
the hypocyclic gear train is driven by an electric prime mover<br>
and supported by a bearing on a stationary shaft. Given N1, N2<br>
to be the gear tooth numbers for the bull and sun gears,<br>
respectively, and Ni1, N21 those associated meshing gears on the<br>
wobble planet, then the total gear train ratio is given simply<br>
by r = (N11N2) / (N11N2-N1N21) .<br>
[0071] The ratio can range from 10-to-l up to 5000-to-l,<br>
the higher ratios depending on the choice of gear tooth<br>
geometry that can be designed for high load capacity, low<br>
noise, high precision, or low cost depending on the<br>
application. In certain embodiments, the appropriate ratio<br>
can be attained using meshing gears wherein the number of<br>
teeth between the two varies by a single tooth.<br>
[0072] in connection with the hypocyclic gear train shown<br>
in Figure 3, the wobble gears 310 and 312 are disposed side-<br>
by-side. This construction has a tendency to improve<br>
rigidity. For lower gear train ratios, tha diameter of gear<br>
310 may differ by as much as 30% or more from the diameter of<br>
gear 312. In such a case, gears 310 and 312 may be disposed<br>
with one inside the other, so that all gear meshes occur in a<br>
single plane.<br>
[0073] Not only can the hypocyclic gear train be directly<br>
plugged into any of the epicyclic designs, its key design<br>
parameters are always visible to the designer/ thereby<br>
removing the aura of black magic in this area of design.<br>
Since the planet gear wobbles, it must be balanced by a<br>
counterweight. In many embodiments, the mass of the<br>
counterweight required is small relative to the mass of the<br>
planet gear itself. In one embodiment, the planet gear is<br>
balanced by drilling a small hole in the body of the planet<br>
gear.<br>
Figure 4<br>
[0074] Rotary actuator 400, shown in Figure 4, incorporates<br>
a central stationary shaft 430 holding support bearings 428<br>
that support the rotating motor armature 420 that drives the<br>
eccantric 418. Support bearings 414 on the eccentric 418<br>
drive the wobble cylinder, which contains the planetary gears<br>
410 and 412 that mesh with the bull gear 404 and sun gear 406<br>
separated by the principal cros3 roller bearing 403.<br>
[0075] Rotary actuator 400 employs a pancake configuration<br>
that incorporates an SRM prime mover 422 to produce a high<br>
torque/low speed rotary actuator 400.<br>
[007 6] Bearing 432 in the output attachment plate 434<br>
supports the end of the stationary shaft 430. Seal 438<br>
separates the output attachment plate 434 from the shell 402<br>
and protects the cross roller bearing 403 from the elements.<br>
Figure 5<br>
[0077] Figure 5 depicts a fifth embodiment of a rotary<br>
actuator 500 in accordance with certain embodiments of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0078] This geometrically different format for a hypocyclic<br>
actuator concept is shown in Figure 5 and generally designated<br>
500. As seen in Figure 5, the bull gear 504 and stator 536 of<br>
actuator 500 are rigidly connected to the outer shell 502 and,<br>
closed at the end by end plate 514.<br>
[0079] Armature 520 contains wobble plate gears 510 and<br>
512, which mesh with bull gear 504 and sun gear 506. Sun gear<br>
506 is separated from bull gear 504 by the principal cross-<br>
roller bearing 508, which also may function as the principal<br>
bearing for the joint of the machine into which rotary<br>
actuator 500 is incorporated.<br>
[0080] As seen in Figure 5, the bull gear 504 and stator<br>
536 of actuator 500 are rigidly connected to the outer shell<br>
502 and closed at the end by end plate 514.<br>
[0081] Rotary actuator 500 further incorporates bearings<br>
542 and 544 to preload the mesh of the wobble plata gears 510<br>
and 512, so as to ensure that they do not separate and to<br>
reduce vibration and the effect of wear.<br>
[0082] Bearings 542 and 544 are centered on a second<br>
eccentric offset of a, 180Â° out of phase with the wobble<br>
armature eccentric 518. Bearings 542 and 544 roll on<br>
cylindrical surfaces machined into the end plate 514 and<br>
output plate 534, both of which are concentric with the<br>
canterline of the rotary actuator 500.<br>
[0083] The high torque, low output velocity rotary actuator<br>
500 shown in Figure 5 is a combination of a hypocyclic<br>
switched reluctance motor, which may generate up to five times<br>
higher torque than a standard switched reluctance motor, and a<br>
hypocyclic gear train, which may have up to five times higher<br>
load capacity than a similar epicyclic gear train.<br>
Accordingly, rotary actuator 500 can be said to have, in<br>
certain embodiments, an enhanced performance envelope up to 25<br>
times higher than prior deigns.<br>
[0084] This overall performance enhancement factor of 25 is<br>
achieved in rotary actuator 500 with five basic parts, the<br>
removal of five additional ancillary bearings and few, if any,<br>
components incorporating dimensions having any critical<br>
tolerances.<br>
[0085] In rotary actuator 500, the wobble motor armature<br>
520 is incorporated into the same part as the wobbla plate<br>
gear pair. Rotary actuator 500 incorporates a number of<br>
distinct advantages over prior designs, including: the need<br>
for only one principal cross-roller bearing 508 and two<br>
ancillary bearings 542 and 544,- and simplified controller<br>
technology owing to the fact that each stator pole is switched<br>
on and off only once in a wave as the armature 520 walks<br>
through an angle of 360 degrees x e (where e is the<br>
eccentricity of the wobble configuration) during each<br>
electrical cycle.<br>
[0086] | The result of the above is a form of magnetic<br>
gearing where the electric cycle occurs at an angular velocity<br>
rate of 1/e relative to the rotational velocity of the<br>
armature 520]. Given an angular velocity of the electrical<br>
field and the wobble speed wf = we = 6667 with e=0.015, for<br>
example; the output attachment plate 534 would rotate at 100<br>
RPM and the output velocity, w0, would equal 1 RPM given a gear<br>
reduction ratio of 100. Because of this electrical wave/<br>
torque ripple 13 virtually non-existent. Also, given a value<br>
of e-0.015/ a balancing mass at r=30e means that only 1/900,<br>
or 0.111%, of the mass of armature 520. needs to be removed to<br>
perfectly balance armature 520. The attributes of actuator<br>
500 are such that certain variations of this design may be<br>
employed effectively as a backdriveable generator to produce<br>
energy from a mechanical power source, such as a wind turbine.<br>
[0087] For at least the embodiments shown in figures 3-5,<br>
each gear tooth can be profiled to be slightly preloaded as it<br>
comes into its central position, in order to reduce the<br>
generation of lower-order harmonics and control backlash and<br>
lost motion. This preloading can be accomplished through the<br>
introduction of a slight interference between that tooth and<br>
the mating teeth as that tooth comes into its central<br>
position. In certain embodiments, a cavity may be introduced<br>
within each wobble gear tooth in order to tailor the stiffness<br>
of the teeth and reduce closing noise.<br>
[0088] Figure 9 shows the sequence of motion, within a<br>
sun/bull gear mechanism 900, of a sun gear tooth as it enters<br>
and exits its central position within the body of the<br>
stationary bull gear 902.<br>
[0089] Tha initial position of the sun gear tooth at time<br>
TO, prior to engagement with the bull gear 902 is designated<br>
904. The central position of the sun gear tooth at time Tl,<br>
some period of time after time TO, is designated 904".<br>
[0090] In certain embodiments/ the geometry of mechanism<br>
900 may be such that a slight interference is encountered as<br>
the sun gear tooth moves into the central position 904". In<br>
such embodiments, the gear tooth stiffness and tha level of<br>
interference in the central position 904" will determine the<br>
forces generated by tha elastic deformation of the bull gear<br>
S02 and the top of the sun gear tooth. This interference will<br>
tend to reduce or eliminate any free motion in any of the<br>
bearings supporting the sun gear, it can be seen in Figure 9<br>
that the sun gear tooth shown incorporates a cavity in order<br>
to reduce its stiffness, as will be described in more detail<br>
below in connection with Figures 10-12,<br>
[0091] After time Tl, at which point maximum interference<br>
and deformation, if any, occur, the sun gear tooth will move<br>
out of engagement with the bull gear 902. The position of the<br>
sun gear tooth at a point in time T2 after time Tl is<br>
designated 904" .<br>
[0092] Examples of gear tooth geometry useful in connection<br>
with gear mechanism 900 and similar gear mechanism are shown<br>
in Figures 10-12. Figure 10 depicts a side view of a circular<br>
arc gear tooth 1000 having a body 1002, and first flank 1004,<br>
a second flank 1006, and a circular cavity 1008 disposed at<br>
the top of the body 1002. The position and diameter of cavity<br>
1008 will be determined by the requirements of a particular<br>
application. In general, the stiffness at the peak of gear<br>
tooth 1000 will be reduced as the diameter of the cavity 1008<br>
is increased or its central axis is moved closer to the peak<br>
of gear tooth 1000. Reducing the diameter of the cavity 1008<br>
or moving it further down into the body 1002 will have the <br>
opposite effect tending to stiffen the peak of gear tooth<br>
1002.<br>
[0093] Figure 11 depicts a side view of a circular arc gear<br>
tooth 1100 having a body 1102, and first flank 1104, a second<br>
flank 1106, and a circular cavity 1108 disposed at the top of<br>
the body 1102. Gear tooth 1100 further incorporates a slot<br>
1110 at the top of circular cavity 1108/ so as to reduce the<br>
rigidity of the top of the body 1102 of gear tooth 1100.<br>
[0094] Figure 12 depicts a side view of a circular arc gear<br>
tooth 1200 having a body 1202, and first flank 1204r a second<br>
flank 1206, and a cavity 1208 disposed at the top of the body<br>
1202, Cavity 1208 is composed of two circular cavities 1110<br>
and 1112, which overlap in the center of gear tooth 1200.<br>
This design preserves the local stiffness at the top of the<br>
gear tooth 1200.<br>
[0095] In the embodiments described above, the tooth ends<br>
may need more ductility than the remainder of the tooth<br>
surface, which should generally be hardened. In certain<br>
embodiments, the cavity or cavities may be drilled and/or<br>
slotted before hardening. The tooth surface may then be<br>
hardened. The tooth tips may be annealed locally to improve<br>
the fatigue resistance at the deforming part of the tooth.<br>
This annealing may, in certain embodiments be performed by a<br>
laser.<br>
[0096] For at least the embodiments shown in Figures 3-5,<br>
the following additional specific comments apply: (a) In<br>
certain embodiments, the gear teeth are circular gear teeth in<br>
order to enhance smoothness, reduce noise from gear tooth<br>
impact and reduce the contact Hertzian stress. In other<br>
embodiments, triangular gear teeth may better satisfy the<br>
application requirements. In other embodiments, specialized<br>
gear tooth geometry may be included where unique application<br>
requirements must be met; (b) Wiring may be disposed entirely<br>
in the stationary stator as part of the outer shell and bull<br>
gear; (c) The force path through the actuator is short; (d)<br>
Armatures may be solid or laminated metal; (e) Few, if any,<br>
critical dimensions are required, thereby reducing the<br>
influence of manufacturing tolerances and temperature<br>
variations on performance, {Â£) The use of short gear teeth<br>
reduces bending stresses and reduce friction losses; and (g)<br>
The meshing of up to thirty teeth picks up and releases the<br>
load slowly to reduce noise.<br>
Figure 6<br>
[0097] Certain applications may require a rugged rotary<br>
actuator with a stiff output gear train of high reduction<br>
ratio in a compact configuration. Depending on the specifics,<br>
such an actuator may be driven either by a pancake switched<br>
reluctance motor (SRM) prime mover or a cylindrical brushless<br>
D.C. Motor (DCM). Figures 6 and 7 are cutaway isometric views<br>
of these alternate embodiments.<br>
[0098] Rotary actuator 600 of Figure 6 has a "coffee can"<br>
profile, while rotary actuator 700 of Figure 7 has the shape<br>
of a circular pancake disk. Rotary actuator 600 is designed<br>
for use in robotics, while rotary actuator 700 is useful in<br>
confined spaces between two walls. Both rotary actuators 600<br>
and 700 are capable of producing relatively high torque at<br>
relatively low speeds. All other things being equal/ rotary<br>
actuator 600 will generally have a higher maximum speed than<br>
rotary actuator 700 and a somewhat lower maximum torque.<br>
[0099) Figure 6 is a cutaway isometric view of a rotary<br>
actuator 600 with the first stage of the epicyclic gear train<br>
650 inside the magnet cylinder 620 of the relatively high<br>
speed D.C. motor field 636. ThÂ« planets 652 and 654 ride on<br>
bearings 656 in a planet cage 658 attached to the magnet<br>
cylinder 620, which, in turn, rides on bearings 660. This<br>
embodiment is ideal for use in dextrous machines.<br>
[00100] Planets 652 and 654 may form a Fergeson paradox<br>
configuration driving moving external sun gear 664 and<br>
stationary external bull gear 662 attached to the central<br>
shaft 630 of rotary actuator 600. Central shaft 630 is<br>
attached to the outer shell 602 using machine bolts.<br>
[0100J In certain embodiments, the first stage may be<br>
designed to reduce its inertia, as it experiences higher<br>
speeds and lower torque. Planetary gears 652 and 654 may be<br>
made relatively narrow and still carry the necessary load.<br>
The specific design parameters of these planetary gears 652<br>
and 654 are dictated by the application.<br>
[0101] There will be a trade off between the size of the<br>
motor components 620 and 636 and the outer diameter of the<br>
first stage gear train 650. The smaller the internal diameter<br>
of magnetic cylinder 620 and field 636, the larger the torque<br>
produced. The stationary shaft 630 is long in this design and<br>
subject to flexure, it is, therefore, supported by bearing<br>
640.<br>
[0102] Sun gear 664 is rigidly connected to the driving<br>
cage 618 of the second stage epicyclic gear train 666 riding<br>
on large needle bearings 628 carrying planet gears 610 and 612<br>
riding in bearings 614. These planet gears 610 and 612 mesh<br>
with stationary internal bull gear 604, which is attached to<br>
the outer shell 602, and internal sun gear 606 attached<br>
directly to the output attachment plate 634.<br>
[0103] Seal 668 separates the attachment shell 602 from the<br>
plate 634. Sun gear 664 and its planet cage 658 support a<br>
bearing 670, which is held in place by the outer shell 602.<br>
The shape of outer shell 602 supporting bearing 670 not only<br>
strengthens the outer shell 602 but also improves the rigidity<br>
of the central stationary shaft 630.<br>
[0104] Internal sun gear 606 is rigidly attached to the<br>
output attachment plate 634, which contains bearing 632, to<br>
further strengthen the output structure of rotary actuator<br>
600.<br>
[0105] The second stage 666 of the epicyclic gear train<br>
uses an internal bull gear 604 and sun gear 606. This<br>
arrangement conforms to the basic configuration of the<br>
structure, minimizing weight while at the same time making<br>
rotary actuator 600 particularly rugged and stiff.<br>
[0106] In the second stage 666, the velocities are lower so<br>
the concern for inertia goes down accordingly, but the regard<br>
for stiffness and load capacity go up. Hence, the size of the<br>
gear teeth in the second stage 666 must meet the requirement<br>
for load as a first priority, with stiffness as a second<br>
priority. This may require, in certain applications, the use<br>
of as many planets 610 and 612 as the geometry will allow.<br>
[0107] The principal bearing in this configuration is the<br>
cross roller bearing 608. it separates bull gear 604 and<br>
shell 602 from sun gear 606 and output attachment plate 634,<br>
Bearing 608 also performs the load bearing tasks for the<br>
machine using this actuator. Because of the position of<br>
bearing 608, bull gear 604 can be made very stiff, as can sun<br>
gear 606. For maximum stiffness and minimum deflection under<br>
load, the attachments to the neighboring links should be made<br>
close to bearing 608.<br>
[0108] Figure 7 depicts, in a cutaway isometric view, an<br>
embodiment of a rotary actuator 700 the present invention<br>
configured for a relatively low speed pancake SRM, which<br>
produces relatively high torque. The bull gear 704 is made<br>
especially strong and is rigidly attached to the attachment<br>
shell 702 and supporting bearing 732 to the primary stationary<br>
shaft 730, so as to further strengthen the output attachment<br>
plate 734 for this design.<br>
[0109] Magnet disk 720, in concert with field 736, directly<br>
drives the first stage planet cage 718 for planet gears 710<br>
and 712, which are supported in bearings 714. Planet cage 718<br>
must be carefully designed to accommodate the planet gears 710<br>
and 712 while maintaining sufficient structural integrity.<br>
[0110] The second stage planet cage 740 is driven by, and<br>
rigidly attached to, sun gear 7 64, which is supported by three<br>
bearings 742, 744 and 746 in order to maximize its support.<br>
This support is incorporated to resist twisting moments<br>
generated by the second stage planets 748 and 750 supported in<br>
bearings 752- The first stage sun gear 7 64 and bull gear 7 62<br>
are external gears. Bearing 732 supports the first planet<br>
gear cage 718 in the moving sun gear 764, which drives the<br>
second planet gear cage 740.<br>
[0111] The second stage sun gear 706 and bull gear 704 are<br>
internal gears. This arrangement serves to match the<br>
structural geometry of the rotary actuator 700 so as to<br>
stiffen the structure. Sun gear 706 and bull gear 704 are<br>
separated by the principal cross-roller bearing 708 which acts<br>
as the principal bearing in the gear train while also serving<br>
as the principal bearing of the joint into which tha rotary<br>
actuator 700 is incorporated. In order to maximize rigidity,<br>
the attachments to the outer attachment shell 702 and to the<br>
output attachment plate 734 should be placed close to cross-<br>
roller bearing 708.<br>
[0112] Since the bull gear 704 and sun gear 706 in the<br>
second stage are relatively large in diameter, they are able<br>
to accommodate more planets 748 and 750 and larger gear teeth.<br>
Accordingly, planet gears 748 and 750 are shown to ba<br>
relatively large as compared to planet gears 710 and 712 in<br>
Figure 7.<br>
[0113] Because of the lower speeds encountered in the<br>
second stage gear train, concern for Inertia is superseded by<br>
a concern for the. load capacity of the gear teeth. This is<br>
also true, to a lesser extent, in the first stage of the gear<br>
train. The outer envelope of the first stage is smaller in<br>
diameter than the outer envelope of the second stage, which is<br>
appropriate since it carries less load but operates with<br>
larger angular velocities.<br>
Figure 8<br>
[0114] Figure 8 depicts a rotary actuator 800 incorporating<br>
a quick-change attachment architecture in accordance with<br>
certain embodiments of the present invention. Rotary actuator<br>
800 incorporates an actuator shell 802 containing a bull gear<br>
804, and sun gear 806, separated by a cross-roller bearing<br>
808. Planet gears 810 and 812 mesh with bull gear 804 and sun<br>
gear 806, respectfully.<br>
[0115) As seen in Figure 8, actuator 800 rigidly connects a<br>
first mechanical link 820 to a second mechanical link 822.<br>
First mechanical link 820 is rigidly connected to actuator<br>
shell 802 by a first wedge clamp 824, whils second mechanical<br>
link 822 is rigidly connected to output attachment plate 834<br>
by second wedge clamp 826. In one embodiment, each of wedge<br>
clamps 824 and 826 takes the form of a pair of semi-circular<br>
wedge clamp halves tightened against actuator 800 by an<br>
external band clamp. Other equivalent structures may, of<br>
course, be employed without departing from the spirit and<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
[0116] In the embodiment shown in Figure 8, wsdge clamps<br>
824 and 826 are tightened by a pair of tensioning mechanisms<br>
828 and 830. Depending on the particular application,<br>
tensioning mechanisms 828 and 830 may be integral to the wedge<br>
clamps 824 and 826, or they may be integral to separate band<br>
clamps disposed around wedge clamps 824 and 826.<br>
[0117] Each of wedge clamps 824 and 826 incorporates a pair<br>
of generally-conic internal surfaces, together forming a<br>
groove about the internal surface of the wedge clamp 824 and<br>
826. The internal profile of each of these internal surfaces<br>
conforms to a mating external surface on either the actuator<br>
800 or one of the mechanical links 320 and 822. As the<br>
tensioning mechanisms 823 and 830 are tightened, the normal<br>
force between the generally-conic internal surfaces and the<br>
mating external surfaces will draw the mating components<br>
together into a tight and rigid mechanical connection. In<br>
certain embodiments, the design of wedge clamps 824 and 826<br>
will conform to one of a standard set of sizes. Within each<br>
standard size, there may be two or more strength classes,<br>
similar to the types of classification employed for<br>
standardized threaded fasteners.<br>
[0118] Mechanical links 820 and 822 are disposed closely<br>
adjacent to one another and to principal cross-roller bearing<br>
808. With the attachment of mechanical links 820 and 822 in<br>
this manner, closely adjacent one another and to principal<br>
cross-roller bearing 808, it can be seen that the joint<br>
rigidly resists motion about five of the six degrees of<br>
freedom, with the remaining degree of freedom controlled by<br>
the prime mover and gear train combination.<br>
[0119] It can be seen that the "force path" through the<br>
rotary actuator 800 is extremely short,and passes through a<br>
combination of highly rigid mechanical structures and<br>
connections and associated rigid structures. This short force<br>
path and associated rigid structures enable the rotary_<br>
actuator 800 to serve as the rotary joint for the machine<br>
itself/ rather than serving merely as a torque input device,<br>
as in prior designs.<br>
[0120] It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art<br>
that, although the quick-change attachment structures of<br>
rotary actuator 800 are shown in connection with a particular<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the attachment structures<br>
shown in Figure 8 can be employed in connection with any of<br>
tha embodiments described herein without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the present invention. where simplicity<br>
is desired, simple bolt circles may prove adequate where<br>
accuracy and repeatability of the interface are not high<br>
priorities, or where a quick change of the actuator out of the<br>
system is not considered important to the application.<br>
[0121] The structures shown and described in connection<br>
with Figure 8 applies to all rotary actuators described<br>
herein. The geometry of a machine built from the actuators<br>
described herein will be primarily dependent on the members<br>
attached to the actuators rather than on the actuators<br>
themselves. Depending on the application, the links may be<br>
parallel to ona another, perpendicular to one another, or<br>
disposed at any general spatial orientation to one another.<br>
The link geometry provides a machine designer with a great<br>
deal of freedom to design the system without the necessity for<br>
customized component*. The use of standardized componentry<br>
can, in many instances, reduce cost, owing to the availability<br>
of mass production, of both the actuators and the links<br>
connecting them. At the same time, a high degree of<br>
generality and flexibility can be preserved for the designer,<br>
even when using standardized,components.<br>
[0122] Although preferred Embodiments of the invention have<br>
been described in detail, it will be understood by those<br>
skilled in the art that various modifications can be made<br>
therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention as set forth in the appended claims.<br>
