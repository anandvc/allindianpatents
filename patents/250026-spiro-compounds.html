PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the inventior and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br><br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application 60/759,601 filed on January 17, 2006 and US nonprovisiontal application 11/647,823 filed on December 30,2006.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to spiro compounds, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them as active ingredient, methods for the treatment of disease states such as cancers associated with protein tyrosine kinases, especially epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), to their method of use as medicaments and to their method of use in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the production of inhibition of tyrosine kinase reducing effects in warm-blooded animals such as humans.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Protein tyrosine kinases have been identified as key players in cellular regulation. They are involved in immune, endocrine, and nervous system physiology and pathology and thought to be important in the development of many cancers. Protein tyrosine kinases represent a diverse and rapidly expanding superfamily of protein, including both transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases and soluble cytoplasmic enzymes also known as nonreceptor tyrosine kinases.<br>
Receptor tyrosine kinases are large enzymes which span the cell membrane and possess an extracellular binding domain for growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and an intracellular portion which functions as a kinase to phosphorylate tyrosine amino acids in proteins and hence to influence cell proliferation. It has also been shown that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) which possesses tyrosine kinase activity is mutated and/or over expressed in many human cancers such as brain, lung, squamous cell, bladder, gastric, breast, head and neck, oesophageal, gynecological and thyroid tumors. EGFR is the archetypal member of receptor tyrosine kinase family comprised of four closely related receptors called EGFR, HER2 (human EGF-related receptor), HER3 and HER4 (Pinkas-Rramarski R, Eilam R, Alroy I, Levkowitz G, Lonai P, Yarden Y. Differential expression of NDF/neuregulin receptors ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 and involvement in inhibition of neuronal differentiation. Oncogene 1997; 15:2803-2815). All of these transmembrane receptors contain an intrinsic kinase activity that modifies tyrosine residues on the receptor itself as well as on downstream signaling molecules. This kinase activity is stimulated when members of the EGF family of growth factors bind to the receptor. Ligand- induced EGFR activation initiates a signaling cascade that activates gene expression and induces cellular responses such as cell cycle progression or differentiation. Aberrant activation of this highly regulated signaling pathway is believed to contribute to many tumorigenic processes, including enhanced cellular proliferation, protection from apoptosis, tumor cell invasion and metastasis (Huang SM, Harari PM. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition in cancer therapy: biology, rational and preliminary clinical results. Invest New Drugs 1999; 17:259-269).<br>
Each receptor is composed of three domains-an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The active receptor is a dimmer, which can be formed by combinations of identical receptor pairs (homodimerization) or different receptor pairs (heterodimerization). EGFR has two main ligands, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF). Following binding of a ligand, the receptor dimerizes, which results in activation of the intracellular<br>
2<br><br>
tyrosine kinase. This begins a number of phosphorylation events that, in turn, initiate a cascade of intracellular signaling process.<br>
Accordingly, it has been recognized that inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases are useful as a selective inhibitors of the growth of mammalian cancer cells.<br>
Normal angiogenesis plays an important role in a variety of processes including embryonic development, wound healing and several components of female reproductive function. Undesirable or pathological angiogenesis has been associated with disease states including diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, atheroma. Tumor angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels and their permeability is primarily regulated by (tumor-derived) vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which acts via at least two different receptors: VEGF-R1 (fms-like tyrosine kinase, FIt-I); and VEGF-R2 (kinase domain region, KDR/fetal liver kinase- 1, FIk-1). The VEGF KDR receptor is highly specific for vascular endothelial cells (for review, see: Farrara et al. Endocr. Rev. 1992, 13, 18; Neufield et al. FASEBJ.1999,13,9).<br>
VEGF is another kind of receptor protein tyrosine kinases. A large number of human tumors, especially gliomas and carcinomas, express high levels of VEGF and its receptors. This has led to the hypothesis that the VEGF released by tumor cells stimulates the growth of blood capillaries and the proliferation of tumor endothelium in a paracrine manner and through the improved blood supply, accelerate tumor growth.<br>
It has now been found that spiro compounds of formula I, described below, are a new class of compounds that have advantageous pharmacological properties and inhibit the activity of tyrosine kinases, for example, the activity of the EGFR and VEGFR tyrosine kinases, the activity of other receptor tyrosine kinases, such as c-kit, PDGF, FGF, SRC etc. They may also be irreversible inhibitors of tyrosine kinase.<br>

Animal antitumor activity testing can be conducted as follows:<br>
The. compounds were mixed with Tween 80 and 0.5% CMC as suspensions. Kunming male mice (19-21 g) were used. Ascitic fluid of mice HAC liver cancer was diluted with 0.9% NaCl solution (1:4), and injected 0.2 ml to each mouse subcutaneously. The whole animals (n = 20) were separated evenly as test and control group randomly. The test group was administered drugs orally at 5-500 mg/Kg dosage once a day from second day after injection of tumor for seven days. The body weight of each animal was monitored everyday. The animals were sacrificed after ten days and each tumor was extracted and weighted for both groups and calculated the difference in percentage for antitumor activity.<br>

Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydropropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example, lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredients in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide palatable oral preparations. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol, anhydrides, for example sorbitan monoleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monoleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents.<br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents.<br>
The compounds may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal or vaginal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the<br>
10<br><br>
rectal or vaginal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum or vagina to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parentally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
Compounds of the invention may also be administered transdermally using methods know to those skilled in the art (see, for example: Chien; "transdermal Controlled Systemic Medications"; Marcel Dekker, Inc.; 1987. Upp et al. WO 94/04157 3Mar94).<br>
Compounds of general Formula I may be administered parenterally in a sterile medium. The drug, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. Advantageously, adjuvants such as local anesthetics, preservatives and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle.<br>
For administration to non-human animals, the composition may also be added to the animal feed or drinking water. It will be convenient to formulate these animal feed and drinking water compositions so that the animal takes in an appropriate quantity of the composition along with its diet. It will also be convenient to present the composition as a premix for addition to the feed or drinking water.<br>
For all regimens of use disclosed herein for compounds of formula I, the daily oral dosage regimen will preferably be from 0.01 to 200 mg/Kg of total body weight.
