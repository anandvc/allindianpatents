GENES ENCODING MAJOR CAPSID PROTEIN L1 OF HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS AND USE OF THE SAME;<br>
SHANGHAI ZERUN BIOTECHNOLOGY CO., LTD., A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF CHINA, WHOSE ADDRESS IS 1399 ZHANGHENG ROAD, ZHANGJIANG, PUDONG, SHANGHAI 201203, CHINA.<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
 <br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of biotechnology, particularly to the major capsid protein of human papilloma virus, gene coding the same, and preparation method and use of the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a non-enveloped small double-stranded circular DNA virus belonging to polyomavirus subfamily of papova virus family. HPV can be spread through intimate contact among human beings, leading to such lesions in the infected persons as verruca vulgaris on the skin and condylomata acuminata around the anus and genitalia, which are ranked as sexually transmitted diseases. The results of investigation published by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 1995 showed that HPV is closely responsible for cervical cancer. It is thus clear that HPV has become a pathogen that is severely harmful to human health. Therefore, it is much significant to develop highly efficient and inexpensive HPV vaccines for the prevention of cervical cancer in women and the sexually transmitted diseases caused by HPV infection.<br>
More than 100 subtypes of HPV have been identified curently. Nearly 100% of the cervical cancer patients can be detected positive for the presence of high-risk HPV DNA in the pathologic tissues by using sensitive detection methods. In terms of the relationship between HPV subtypes and malignancies in genital tract of female patient, HPV can be classified into low-risk type and high-risk type. HPV6, 11, 34, 40 and 42 and the like are low-risk HPV subtypes, typically found in benign cervical lesions such as cervical condylomas and mild atypical hyperplasia of cervical epithelium; while HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45 are high-risk HPV subtypes, mostly found in severe atypical hyperplasia of cervical epithelium as well as cervical cancer. A series of studies on different human populations have substantiated that HPV 16 and 18 infections in genital tract are more highly associated with the occurrence of cervical cancer than other risk factors. Among cervical cancer patients, about 50 to 60% of the cases are caused by HPV 16 infection, about 14% by HPV 18, about 8% by HPV 45, and about 5% by HPV 31, with the remaining 23% of the cases caused by other HPV subtypes.<br>
HPV is non-enveloped and globular in shape with a diameter of about 45 to 55 nm, having an icosahedrally symmetric deflective capsid consisting of 72 capsid particles. The virion capsid is essentially comprised of major capsid proteins (LI) and minor capsid proteins (L2). After being expressed in cells, major capsid proteins LI can be self-assembled into capsid particles called virus-like particles (VLPs).<br>
A normal woman has a life-time accumulative probability of about 40% for cervical infection by at least one subtype of HPV during her whole life. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop suitably-priced and advantageously protective vaccines against cervical cancer, especially vaccines against HPV 16 and HPV 18, for lowering the morbidity and mortality of cervical cancer in women.<br>
 <br>
Although some vaccines have been developed against HPV in the prior art , these vaccines generally have the problems of low expression efficiency of HPV protein, low activity of the expressed protein, inability of the protein to assemble into virus-like particles or undesirability of the immunological effect of the assembled particles. Consequently, there exists a need in the art for improved HPV vaccine products.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Through intensive research, the present inventors have for the first time disclosed a codon-optimized gene encoding the major capsid protein LI of human papilloma virus, which is capable, when introduced into a yeast cell of efficiently expressing the major capsid protein LI of human papilloma virus which then self-assembles into virus-like particles, in an expression amount that meets the requirements of industrial production. The present invention also for the first time discloses an immunogenic macromolecule which is essentially produced by expression of said codon-optimized gene encoding the major capsid protein LI of human papilloma virus in a yeast cell.<br>
As used herein, said major capsid protein LI of human papilloma virus is referred to, for short, as HPV LI protein; said major capsid protein LI of human papilloma virus subtype 18 is referred to, for short, as HPV18 LI protein; and said major capsid protein LI of human papilloma virus subtype 16 is referred to, for short, as HPV 16 LI protein. HPV LI protein includes HPV 18 LI protein and HPV 16 LI protein, or truncated forms thereof.<br>
As used herein, the term "immunogenic macromolecule" refers to a polymer macromolecule comprising a number of monomeric major capsid proteins LI of human papilloma virus, preferably polymerized or assembled from a number of major capsid proteins LI of human papilloma virus; said major capsid proteins LI of human papilloma virus are encoded by a codon-optimized gene encoding the major capsid protein LI of human papilloma virus and are expressed in yeast cell (preferably Pichia yeast cell). Said immunogenic macromolecule is granular in shape.<br>
As used herein, "operably linked together" or "operably linked to" refers to a status in which certain portions of a linear DNA sequence can influence the activities of other portions of the same linear DNA sequence. For example, if a promoter controls the transcription of an encoding sequence, then it is operably linked to the encoding sequence.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "comprising", "having" or "including" (or grammatical variants thereof) encompasses "containing", "substantially consisting of...", "essentially consisting of..." and "consisting of...". Concepts "substantially consisting of.,.", "essentially consisting of..." and<br>
 <br>
"consisting of..." are subordinate concepts of "comprising", "having' or "including".<br>
Gene encoding the major capsitl protein LI of human papilloma virus<br>
Based on the object of expressing HPV LI protein using yeast cell, the present inventors have, after repeated investigation, found an optimized gene encoding HPV LI protein which is suitable to be efficiently expressed in yeast cell, particularly in Pichia yeast cell. Said optimized gene encodes a full-length or truncated HPV 18 LI protein. Alternatively, said optimized gene encodes a full-length HPV 16 LI protein.<br>
It is well known to those skilled in the art that, although there exist 64 genetic codons, most organisms tend to utilize some of these codons. For example, the genes of yeast cell have a different preference for codons than do human genes. Due to degeneracy of genetic codons, each amino acid may be encoded by more than one codon, with the codons for the same amino acid having different frequencies of usage in wild-type genes. Yeast cell's preference for codons may result in low translation efficiency and expression levels of recombinant proteins.<br>
Codon optimization according to the present invention is essentially achieved as follows. Firstly, modifications are made on the naturally-occurring gene encoding HPV LI by optimizing the codons for all the corresponding amino acids of the gene and repeatedly conducting gene expression experiments on the optimized gene sequences so as to find a novel set of HPV DNA sequences suitable for expression in yeast cell. The gene encoding full-length HPV 18 LI is set forth in Genbank accession no. AAP20601; the gene encoding truncated HPV 18 LI is set forth in Genbank accession no. AAQ92369; and the gene encoding full-length HPV 16 LI is set forth in Genbank accession no. AAC09292.<br>
Furthermore, in order to avoid the presence of a high GC ratio in the transcribed mRNAs, the influence of mRNA secondary structure on the efficiency of translation, and the occurrence of common restriction sites, the present inventors have made alterations to some of the preferable codons, such as, the codon for asparagine (Asn) being altered from AAC to AAT; the codon for lysine (Lys) being altered from AAG to AAA; the codon for aspartic acid (Asp) being altered from GAT to GAC, the codon for phenylalanine (Phe) being altered from TTT to TTC; the codon for tyrosine (Tyr) being altered from TAC to TAT; and the codon for glycine (Gly) being altered from GGT to GGA, thus obtaining a altered, novel HPV DNA sequences.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, said gene encodes the major capsid proteins LI of human papilloma virus having an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 10 or in positions 62 to 568 of SEQ ID NO: 10 (i.e., HPV18 LI). More preferably, said gene has a nucleotide sequence selected from those set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 3; or has a nucleotide sequence selected from those set forth in SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5 and SEQ ID NO: 6. Even more preferably, said gene has a nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 4. Most preferably, said gene has the nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1, which is a gene for truncated HPV 18 LI corresponding to a truncated HPV 18 LI protein with deletions of 61 amino acids at the N-terminus. Such a truncated gene is more favorably expressed in a recombinant vector without changing the activity of the protein.<br>
 <br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, said gene encodes the major capsid proteins LI of human papilloma virus having an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 11 (i.e.. HPV 16 LI). More preferably, said gene has a nucleotide sequence selected from those set forth in SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8 and SEQ ID NO: 9. Most preferably, said gene has the nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 7.<br>
The codon-optimized gene provided by the present invention has the following advantages: 1) this optimized gene is more suitable for efficiently expressing target protein in yeast host and meets the requirements of industrial production; and 2) low cost, high yield and more uniform and stable quality of products can be achieved with the use of Pichia yeast expression system.<br>
The present invention also provides a vector comprising said gene encoding HPV LI. Said vector may further comprise regulatory sequence(s) for expression which are operably linked to the sequence of said coding gene so as to facilitate the expression of said HPV L 1 protein. Any suitable vector can be used, especially those used for cloning and expression in yeast cell. More preferably, said expression vector is selected from currently commonly used yeast expression vectors, such as pPICZ*  pPIC6s  pGAPZ and pA08l5. Such expression vectors are commercially<br>
available.<br>
Moreover, recombinant cell comprising said gene encoding HPV LI is also included in the present invention. Said recombinant cell is a yeast cell, particularly a Pichia yeast cell. More preferably, said Pichia yeast cell is selected from Pichia yeast X-33, GS115, KM71 and SMD1168 strains. These yeast cell strains are commercially available. Methods for introducing an exogenous gene into yeast cell are known in the art, for example, electrotransforrnation or protoplast transformation.<br>
Method for producing HPV LI is also included in the present invention. Said method comprises culturing said recombinant cell comprising said coding gene. Said method may include allowing the cells to express the encoded HPV LI protein, and may further include separating and/or purifying the expressed protein. The HPV LI protein obtained as above can be purified into essential homogeneity, for example, exhibiting a single band on SDS-PAGE electrophoresis.<br>
The HPV LI protein expressed in yeast cell according to the present invention can be used for preparing immunogenic macromoiecule which can induce immune responses in vivo, particularly humoral immune responses.<br>
As an embodiment of the present invention, the present inventors have designed, through optimization, several gene sequences suitable for expressing HPV LI protein in Pichia yeast, which were then used for the total synthesis of full-length HPV LI gene or its truncated form. The gene or its truncated form was cloned into existing Pichia yeast expression vector which was then used to construct recombinant Pichia yeast expression strain through homologous recombination and screening with high concentration antibiotics. The recombinant Pichia yeast was fermentatively cultured and then induced with methanol to highly express HPV LI protein intracellutarly, which is capable of concurrently self-assembling into virus-like particles (VLPs) intracellularly. The virus-like particles purified by chromatography of the supernatant obtained<br>
 <br>
from disrupted cells had a purity of greater than 90% and were highly immunogenic when adsorbed to an aluminium adjuvant, permitting them to be used as a human vaccine against cervical cancer.<br>
Protein expression and purification<br>
HPV LI protein can be efficiently expressed by culturing said recombinant cell comprising said gene encoding HPV LI, the expressed proteins being concurrently allowed to be self-assembled into immunogenic macromolecules. A method of expression and purification includes: (3) culturing said recombinant cell to allow said major capsid protein LI of human papilloma virus to be expressed and to be concurrently self-assembled into immunogenic molecules in the recombinant cells; (2) disrupting the cells obtained from step (1) to obtain supernatant containing the immunogenic molecules; and (3) successively purifying the supernatant obtained from step (2) using POROS 50 HS column chromatography and CHT column chromatography to obtain said immunogenic macromolecules.<br>
Preferably, cell culturing and protein expression are conducted as follows. The genetically engineered yeast according to the present invention is inoculated into activation media (YPD or LB or SOC) and cultured at 25 to 37°C overnight. Then the activated fluid is inoculated into seed culture media (YPD or LB or SOC) and cultured at 25 to 37°C overnight. Fermentation is conducted using basal salt medium (BSM1 or BSM2 or BSM3) added with trace amounts of salts (PTM1, PTM2, PTM3) at a temperature of 20 to 37°C and an initial pH of 3 to 8. After the initial proliferation stage for about 15 to 30 hours, the dissolved oxygen value is maintained at 20 to 80% by adjusting the speed of stirring, air flow, and tank pressure. When the carbon source is completely consumed, the wet weight of yeast would reach about 50 to 150g/L. At this time, glycerol or glucose solution is supplemented and the dissolved oxygen value is maintained at 20 to 80%. After a period of time of supplementation, the wet wejgbt of yeast would reach about 50 to 500g/L, at which time supplementation is stopped and methanol is added for induction while the pH value is maintained at pH 3 to 8. The dissolved oxygen value is maintained at higher than 20 to 80%, the temperature is maintained at 20 to 37°C, and the pH value is maintained at pH 3 to 8. Samples are taken at an interval of 2 to 10 hours and subjected to Western blot detection. Fermentation is stopped 5 to 90 hours after induction, and the fermentation broth is discharged. The fermentation broth is centrifuged using a refrigerated centrifuge, and then the cells are collected and stored at -20°C. The inducibly expressed HPV LI protein can be self-assembled into virus-like particles (HPV LI VLPs) inside Pichia yeast cell.<br>
As said HPV LI protein is expressed inside Pichia yeast cell, purer proteins can be obtained by performing cell disruption and protein purification and then allowed to be self-assembled into virus-like particles. Purification is generally performed as follows. The cells are washed to remove the attached medium components (salts, pigments, etc) in order to reduce their influence on subsequent purification. The washed cells are mixed into a suitable cell disruption buffer containing salt and surfactant components at certain concentrations. The salt components that can be used are for example NaCl and KCI at a concentration in the range of about 0.4 to 0.8mol/I. The<br>
 <br>
surfactant components that can be used are for example Tween-80, Tween-20 and Triton-X 100 at a concentration in the range of about 0.005 to 0.05% (w/v). The buffer systems that can be used are for example phosphate buffer, Tris buffer, MOPS buffer, and HEPES buffer at a concentration in the range of about 0.02 to 0.2mol/l. The mixed cells can be disrupted using for example a high pressure homogenizer operating in a pressure range of about 800 to 2000 bars, achieving a disruption rate of greater than 90% in 2 to 4 disruption cycles, or a bead mill homogenizer using beads having diameters in the range of 0.2 to 0.4 mm which are loaded in an amount of about 70 to 90%, achieving a disruption rate of greater than 80% in I to 2 disruption cycles. The solution containing disrupted cells is subjected to high speed centrifugation at 6,000 to L0,000 rpm (SORVALL, HITACHI, etc.) for 20 to 60 minutes, or to tangential flow microfiltration using 0.45 to 0.65 urn membrane module (Millipore, PALL, etc.), in order to separate the supernatant and the precipitate, obtaining supernatant for further purification. The supernatant obtained can be subjected to anion exchange chromatography using such as Q Sepharose Flast Flow (GE) or DEAE SephroseFast Flow (GE) to remove some of the impurities in the supernatant, such as DNA, RNA and impurity proteins prior to conducting further purification. Alternatively, the supernatant obtained can be directly used to conduct further purification.. For the further purification, the supernatant samples are loaded onto HPV LI VLPs-adsorbable chromatographic media, such as SP<br>
Sepharose  FF,  Heparin  SepharoseCL-6B  (GE),  Poros  50HS  (Merck)  and  Fractoget@EMD<br>
TMAE-650 (Merck) to allow HPV LI VLPs protein to efficiently bind to the chromatographic media. Then the media is washed using a salt concentration gradient (such as 0.5 to 1.0 M NaCl or KC1 buffer solution) to separate impurities from HPV LI VLPs protein. Subsequently, high concentration salt-containing buffer solution (such as 1.0 to 2.0 M NaCl or KCI buffer solution) is used to elute the bound HPV LI VLPs protein, and the eluted preliminarily-purified HPV LI VLPs protein is collected. Thus obtained preliminarily-purified HPV LI VLPs protein is loaded onto chromatographic media for fine purification, such as CHT (BIO-RAD Type II), to which HPV LI VLPs protein can efficiently bind under the conditions of a certain range of salt concentration (such as 0.3 to 1.5 M NaCl or KCI buffer solution). Then the media is eluted using a phosphate concentration gradient (such as a phosphate concentration in the range of 20 to 400 mM) to separate impurities from HPV LI VLPs. Alternatively, the preliminarily-purified HPV LI VLPs protein can also be loaded onto such chromatographic media for fine purification as Sephacryl S-1000 (GE) and HW-75 (TSK) to achieve the separation of impurities from HPV LI VLPs protein through gel chromatography. The eluted HPV LI VLPs protein after fine purification is collected as the final purified sample.<br>
The purification method according to the present invention can remove most of the contaminating biomolecules (including DNAs, lipids and proteins). Detection using reduced SDS-PAGE electrophoresis or capillary electrophoresis (Beckman Coulter) revealed that the' sample obtained by purification using POROS 50HS chromatography media had a purity of 75% to 80%, and the final HPV LI VLPs protein sample purified using hydroxyapatite media had a purity of 90% to 95%. Western blot (Bio-RAD) detection showed specific staining reaction<br>
 <br>
between target protein band and monoclonal or polyclonal antibody to HPV LI VLPs. Dynamic light scattering detection (Malvern Instruments Zetasizer Nano ZS) showed that the purified sample had particles in a size range of about 50 to 80 nm: and transmission electron microscopy observation (Philips) revealed virus-like particles (VLPs) in the sample, with the particle size in the range of about 50 to 80 nm. In the present experiment, the hydroxyapatite media used is most preferably ceramic hydroxyapatite media filler with a particle size in the range of about 20 to 50 nm and a pore size of about 800A. The buffers used in chromatography have a pH in the range of 6 to 9, the preferable buffering system being 50 mM MOPS.<br>
In comparison with the prior art, the present invention optimally designed a gene for HPV 18 LI (full-length gene, or preferably truncated gene corresponding to HPV 18 LI protein with deletions of 61 amino acids at the N-terminus) and cloned it into Pichia yeast such that a markedly increased expression of HPV 18 LI protein was achieved compared with other expression systems (such as mammal cell, baculovirus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Following the expression, the virus-like particles obtained through purification were observed by electron microscopy to be 50 -80 nm in size, similar to wild-type HPV particles. The virus-like particles assembled from recombinant HPV 18 LI protein were adsorbed to an aluminium adjuvant and used to immune mice, generating high titers of anti-HPV 18 LI antibodies. Neutralization experiment using pseudotype virus showed that the antibodies had very good neutralizing activity (that is, capable of inhibiting entry of pseudotype virus into cells). In addition, the optimally designed gene for HPV 16 LI according to the present invention, after being cloned into Pichia yeast, resulted in a very high level of expression of HPV 16 LI protein.<br>

Example 1: Design and synthesis of codon-optimized gene for HPV 18 LI<br>
1.1. Design of codon-optimized gene for HPV 18 LI<br>
The present invention relates to DNA molecules encoding the major capsid protein LI of human papilloma virus subtype 18 (HPV 18), which have been codon-optimized with codons preferred by Pichia yeast. Three DNA sequences, which are as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 4, 5 and 6, respectively, were obtained through optimization of codons and alteration of optimized codons, as detailed below.<br>
Firstly, through repeated experiments, modifications were made on the naturally-occurring gene encoding HPV I8L1 by optimizing the codons for all the corresponding amino acids of the gene to design a novel HPV DNA sequence, that is, SEQ ID NO:4.<br>
Then, in order to avoid the presence of a high GC ratio in the transcribed mRNAs, the influence of mRNA secondary structure on the efficiency of translation, and the occurrence of common restriction sites, alterations were made to the optimized codons, such as, the codon for asparagine (Asn) being altered from AAC to AAT, the codon for lysine (Lys) being altered from AAG to AAA, the codon for aspartic acid (Asp) being altered from GAT to GAC, the codon for<br>
 <br>
phenylalanine (Phe) being altered from ITT to TTC. the codon for tyrosine (Tyr) being altered from TAC to TAT, and the codon for glycine (Gly) being altered from GGT to GGA, thus obtaining two altered, novel HPV DNA sequences: SEQ ID NO: 5, which was altered from SEQ ID NO: 4 through alterations to the codons for asparagine (Asn), lysine (Lys) and aspartic acid (Asp); and SEQ ID NO: 6, which was altered from SEQ ID NO: 4 through alterations to the codons for phenylalanine (Phe), tyrosine (Tyr) and glycine (Gly). 1.2. Synthesis of codon-optimized gene for HPV 18 LI<br>
The codon-optimized gene for HPV 18 LI as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 4 was synthesized and used as template to perform PCR amplification using primers al and a2 which have the following sequences:<br>
al: 5'-ATAGAATTCAAGATGTGTTTGTACACTAGAGTTT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 12);<br>
a2: 5'-AATGGTACCCTATTACTTTCTAGCTCTAACT-3! (SEQ ID NO: 13).<br>
The PCR products obtained were subjected to separation by agarose gel electrophoresis and the target sequence was recovered from the gel, obtaining a fragment about 1.7 kb in size. This fragment was sequenced, with the result of sequencing as shown in SEQ ID NO: 4, and was demonstrated from the result to be the full-length codon-optimized gene for HPV 18L1. Thus obtained gene for HPV I8L1, by virtue of the EcoRI and Kpnl restriction sites on its ends, was ligated into pUC18 plasmid (available from Generay Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China)). The resulting construct was verified by sequencing to be correct, and was named as pUC-I8LJ.<br>
Codon-optimized genes for HPV 18L1 as shown in SEQ ID NO: 5 and 6 were obtained in a similar procedure as above mentioned.<br>
In order to verify the feasibility of the optimized sequences, one of the codon-optimized genes for HPV 16L1 obtained in this Example I (SEQ ID NO: 4) was exemplarily used to construct an expression plasmid to assess for its expression, as detailed in Example 2.<br>
Example 2: Construction of expression vector of HPV 18L1 gene<br>
The optimized sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4 was cloned into Pichia yeast expression vector, as depicted in Fig. 1 and as detailed in the following steps.<br>
2.1.	The forward and reverse primers having the following sequences, which were required for<br>
amplifying HPV 18L1 gene, were synthesized:<br>
forward primer: 5'-TCCCAATCTTCGAAACGATGTGTTTGTACACTAGAGTTT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 14);<br>
reverse primer: 5'-AATG^TAC£CTATTACTTTCTAGCTCTAACT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 13);<br>
Wherein the forward primer comprises a BstBI restriction site, and the reverse primer comprises a Kpnl restriction site flanking the termination codon, said restriction sites respectively as shown in the underlined portions of the primer sequences above.<br>
2.2.	PCR amplification was performed using the above primers and using the pUC-18Ll obtained<br>
 <br>
in Example 1 as template. The amplified product was detected by electrophoresis, with the result being shown in Fig. 2, demonstrating that a full-length codon-optimized gene for HPV I8LI was obtained. The PCR amplified fragment was digested with BstBI and Kpnl (restriction endonucleases) and then ligated with pPlCZaB (Invitrogen Corp.) which was also digested with BstBI and Kpnl. Then, the ligated construct was used to transform competent cells of E. coli ToplO strain (available from Generay Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China)), and the transformed cells were plated onto LB agar containing 25 ug/ml of zeocin.<br>
The transformed cells were able to grow on LB media containing zeocin as the pPlCZaB vector carried zeocin-resistance gene. Single colonies of the transformed cells were separated to prepare plasmid DNA. HPV 18L1 gene and vector sequence were detected through restriction mapping (see Fig. 3) and nucleotide sequence analysis to identify the correct construct comprising HPV 18L1 gene, which was named pPFCZ-18Ll. As secretion signal (a-factor signal) has been cleaved from the constructed plasmid, HPV 18L1 protein should be intracellular^ expressed protein.<br>
Example 3: Construction and expression of HPV 18L1 gene-exnressing strain<br>
3.1.	Construction of HPV 18L1 gene-expressing strain<br>
pPlCZ-18Ll plasmid was linearized with a restriction endonuclease enzyme Sad, and empty plasmid pPlCZaB was likewise digested with SacI to serve as negative control. The enzyme digestion solution was added with absolute ethanol to obtain DNA precipitate. The linearized pPICZ-18Ll fragment was dissolved with a small amount of double-distilled water and used to transform Pichia yeast strain X-33 (Invitrogen Corp.) by electroporation under the following conditions: DNA fragment, 5 ug; voltage. 1,500 volts; resistance, 25 omhs; electroporation time, 5 milliseconds. The electroporated cells were plated onto YPDS agar containing 200 ug/ml zeocin. As the pPlCZaB vector carried zeocin-resistance gene, the transformed cells were able to grow on YPDS media containing zeocin. Single colonies of transformed cells were isolated, thus obtaining HPV 18L1 gene-expressing Pichia yeast strain.<br>
3.2.	Expression of HPV 18L1 gene-expressing Pichia yeast strain<br>
The obtained HPV 18L1 gene-expressing Pichia yeast strain was plated onto resistance plates containing 1,000 ug/ml or 1,500 ug/ml zeocin. Clones obtained from plates having high concentration of resistance were separately cultured in 4 mL of YPD liquid culture media for 24 hours followed by induction of gene expression in BMMY culture media for 48 hours. Then cells were harvested by centrifugation and some of the cells were disrupted to obtain supernatant for performing Western blotting identification. The result of identification is shown in Fig. 4, which indicated the presence of HPV 18L1 protein in the supernatant.<br>
Although SEQ ID NO: 4 sequence was used for cloning and expression in Examples 2 and 3 of the present invention, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that similar results can be obtained when SEQ ID NO: 5 and 6 sequences are used for cloning and expression, and therefore<br>
 <br>
these two sequences are also within the scope of the present invention. Moreover, those skilled in the art will, in light of the spirit of the present invention, readily construct similar sequences and clone and express the constructed sequences in Pichia yeast to obtain similar or better results, and therefore these sequences are also deemed to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 4: Purification of HPV 18L1 protein<br>
The cells prepared in Example 3 were disrupted and centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was subjected to purification by chromatography to obtain HPV 18L1 protein which has self-assembled into virus-like particles, as detailed below.<br>
HPV 18L1 gene-expressing Pichia yeast cells were mixed with washing buffer in a ratio of 1:3 and shaken well, and the mixture was centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 5 minutes to collect the cells. The above procedure was repeated twice.<br>
The washed cells were mixed with cell disruption buffer in a ratio of 1:5 and shaken well, and the cells in the resulting suspension were disrupted under high pressure. The above procedure was repeated so that 90% of the cells were disrupted. The resulting disrupted cell solution was centrifuged at 9,000 rpm at 10°C for 30 minutes and the supernatant was collected.<br>
The supernatant obtained was preliminarily purified on POROS 50HS (Applied Biosystems Co., Ltd) chromatography column by eluting with a linear gradient of 100% buffer E to 100% buffer F and collecting the elution fractions. Sample was taken from the purified elution fractions and reduced to form monomeric proteins for detection by SDS-PAGE and Western bloting.<br>
The elution fractions containing HPV 18L1 protein were combined and subjected to fine purification on CHT (BJO-RAD Type U) chromatography column eluted with a linear gradient of 100% buffer G to 100% buffer H. The elution fractions were collected, from which sample was taken and reduced to form monomeric proteins for detection by SDS-PAGE and Western bloting. The elution fractions containing HPV 18L1 protein were combined, thereby obtaining the final purified sample with a purity of greater than 90%.<br>
Example 5: Preparation of HPV 18L1 vaccine<br>
The purified HPV I8L1 protein obtained in Example 4 above was adsorbed to an aluminium adjuvant to prepare an immunogenic HPV 18L1 vaccine according to the method described in Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2005 edition).<br>
Example 6. Determination of immunogenicity of the expression product of HPV 18L1 gene<br>
Twenty-four 6 to 8 weeks old SPF BALB/c mice were divided into 4 groups, with 6 mice in each group. Mice in the first group (as the negative control group) were immunized by cutaneous injection of 0.1 mL of aluminium adjuvant-containing buffer (0.32 M sodium chloride, 0.35 mM sodium borate, 0.01% Tween-80, 0.01 M histidine, pH 6.5) for three times on days 0, 7 and 21 respectively, and mice in the other three groups (as the test groups) were similarly immunized with 0.1 mL of aluminium adjuvant-adsorbed VLPs at a concentration of 5 fig/mL, 0.5 µg/mL and 0.05 µg/mL respectively. Blood samples were collected two weeks after the third immunization. The<br>
 <br>
blood samples collected were stood at 37°C for 2 hours and then centrifuged at 4,000 g for 10 minutes. The supernatant, which was obtained as mouse polyclonal antiserum, was aspirated and stored at -20°C. Additionally, the supernatant was assayed for seroconversion rate and titer, as detailed below,<br>
6.1. Detection of seroconversion rate<br>
The purified .HPV 18L1 protein expressed by Pichia yeast was diluted with coating solution to 1 µg/mL. An aliquot of 0.1 mL of the dilution was added into each well of an EL1SA plate, and the plate was incubated at 4°C overnight. The coating solution was removed from each well, which was then washed with 0.3 mL of PBST. Then, each well was blocked by incubating with 0.3 mL of blocking solution (5% skimmed milk powder + PBST) at 37°C for 2 hours. Each well was added with 0.1 mL of test sera (serum obtained from mice immunized with aluminium adjuvant-adsorbed HPV 18L1 protein and serum obtained from mice immunized with aluminium adjuvant alone) solution obtained by diluting the sera with dilution buffer (2% skimmed milk powder + PBST) in a ratio of 1:400, and then incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Then the test sera solution was removed and each well was washed with 0.3 mL of washing buffer. Subsequently, each well was added with 0.1 mL of HRP labeled goat anti-mouse IgG obtained by diluting the IgG with dilution buffer in a ratio of 1:5,000 and incubated at 37°C for 0.5 hour. Then the EL1SA solution was removed and each well was washed with 0.3 mL of washing buffer. Then, each well was added with 0.1 mL DAB color development solution, and interaction was allowed to occur in dark at room temperature for 20 minutes. Afterwards, 0.05 mL of 2 M H2SO4 stop solution was added to each well to stop the reaction, and OD450 value was determined using an ELISA reader, with the readings shown in Table 2 below.<br>

An aliquot of 0.1 mL of the dilution was added into each well of an ELISA plate, and the plate was incubated at 4°C overnight. The coating solution was removed from each well, which was then washed with 0.3 mL of PBST. Then, each well was blocked by incubating with 0.3 mL of blocking solution (5% skimmed milk powder + PBST) at 37°C for 2 hours. The test sera (sera obtained from mice immunized with HPV 18L1 protein) was serially double diluted with dilution buffer (2% skimmed milk powder + PBST) from 1:500 dilution to 1:32,000 dilution, while the negative control serum (serum obtained from mice immunized with aluminium adjuvant) was diluted in a ratio of 1:10,000. Each well was added with an aliquot of 0.1 mL of diluted serum (test serum or negative control serum) and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Then the test serum solution was removed and each well was washed with 0.3 mL of washing buffer. Subsequently, each well was added with 0.1 mL of HRP labeled sheep anti-mouse JgG obtained by diluting the IgG with dilution buffer in a ratio of 1:5,000, and incubated at 37°C for 0.5 hour. Then the ELISA solution was removed and each well was washed with 0.3 mL of washing buffer. Then, each well was added with 0.1 mL DAB color development solution, and interaction was allowed to occur at room temperature for 20 minutes. Afterwards, 0.05 mL of 2 M H2SO4 stop solution was added to each well to stop the reaction, and OD450 value was determined using an ELISA reader.<br>

In summary, as shown in Examples 1-6, the gene for major capsid protein LI of human papilloma virus subtype 18, as provided by the present invention, is an optimized HPV 18L1 gene, which has the advantages of being more suitable for efficiently expressing target protein in yeast host and meeting the requirements of industrial production. Moreover, the HPV 18L1 vaccine as provided by the present invention, which was prepared from adjuvant-adsorbed purified VLPs (virus-like particles self-assembled from HPV 18L1 protein), was demonstrated to be strongly immunogenic in mice as determined by seroconversion rate and serum titer. Further, said method has the advantages of low cost, high yield and more uniform and stable quality of products due to<br>

the use of Pichia yeast expression system.<br>
Example 7: Design and synthesis of codon-optimized gene for truncated HPV 18 LI<br>
7.1.	Design of codon-optimized gene for truncated HPV 18 LI<br>
The present invention relates to DNA molecules encoding the truncated major capsid protein LI of human papilloma virus subtype 18 (HPV18), which have been codon-optimized with codons preferred by Pichia yeast. Three DNA sequences, which are as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1, 2 and 3, respectively, were obtained through optimization of codons, alteration of optimized codons and truncation of 61 amino acids from the N terminus, as detailed below.<br>
Firstly, modifications were made on the naturally-occurring gene encoding HPV 18L1 in a similar manner as in Example 1 above to design a novel HPV DNA sequence.<br>
Then, in order to avoid the presence of a high GC ratio in the transcribed mRNAs, the influence of mRNA secondary structure on the efficiency of translation, and the occurrence of common restriction sites, alterations were made to the optimized codons, such as. the codon for asparagine (Asn) being altered from AAC to AAT, the codon for lysine (Lys) being altered from AAG to AAA. the codon for aspartic acid (Asp) being altered from GAT to GAC, the codon for phenylalanine (Phe) being altered from TTT to TTC, the codon for tyrosine (Tyr) being altered from TAC to TAT, and also 61 amino acids were truncated from the N terminus, thus obtaining three novel truncated HPV DNA sequences, wherein:<br>
SEQ ID NO: 1 is the DNA sequence without codon alteration;<br>
SEQ ID NO: 2 is the DNA sequence obtained from SEQ ID NO:  1 by altering the codons for asparagine (Asn), lysine (Lys) and aspartic acid (Asp);<br>
SEQ ID NO: 3 is the DNA sequence obtained from SEQ ID NO: 1 by altering the codons for phenylalanine (Phe). tyrosine (Tyr) and glycine (Gly).<br>
7.2.	Synthesis of codon-optimized gene for truncated HPV 18 LI<br>
The full-length codon-optimized gene for truncated HPV 18 LI, as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 was obtained using essentially the same method as described in Example 1 above mentioned. Thus obtained gene for truncated HPV 18L1, by virtue of the EcoRI and Kpnl restriction sites on its ends, was ligated into pUCI8 plasmid (available from Generay Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China)). The resulting construct was verified by sequencing to be correct, and was named as pUC-18LlThe codon-optimized genes for truncated HPV 18 LI, as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2 and 3, were obtained in a similar method.<br>
In order to verify the feasibility of the optimized sequences, one of the codon-optimized genes for truncated HPV 18L1 obtained in this Example 7 (SEQ ID NO: 1) was exemplarily used to construct an expression plasmid to assess for its expression, as detailed in Example 8.<br>
Example 8: Construction of expression vector of truncated HPV 18L1 gene<br>
 <br>
The optimized sequence of SEQ ID NO: I was cloned into Pichia yeast expression vector, as detailed in the following steps.<br>
8.1.	The forward and reverse primers having the following sequences, which were required for<br>
amplifying HPV 18L1 gene, were synthesized:<br>
forward primer: 5'-TCCCAATCTTCGAAACGATGGCTTTGTGGA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 15);<br>
reverse primer: 5!-AATGGTACCCTATTACTTTCTAGCTCTAACT-37 (SEQ ID NO: 13).<br>
Wherein the forward primer comprises a BstBI restriction site, and the reverse primer comprises a Kpnl restriction site flanking the termination codon, said restriction sites respectively as shown in the underlined portions of the primer sequences above.<br>
8.2.	PCR amplification was performed using the above primers and using the pUC-18L1' obtained<br>
in Example 7 as template. The amplified product was detected by electrophoresis, with the result<br>
being shown in Fig. 5, demonstrating that a full-length codon-optimized gene for truncated HPV<br>
18LI was obtained. The PCR amplified fragment was digested with BstBI and Kpnl (restriction<br>
endonucleases) and then ligated with pPlCZaB (Invitrogen Corp.) which was also digested with<br>
BstBI and Kpnl. Then, the ligated construct was used to transform competent cells of E. coli Top 10<br>
strain (available from Generay Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China)), and the<br>
transformed cells were plated onto LB agar containing 25 jig/ml of zeocin.<br>
The transformed cells were able to grow on LB media containing zeocin as the pPICZaB vector carried zeocin-resistance gene. Single colonies of the transformed cells were separated to prepare plasmid DNA. HPV 18L1 gene and vector sequence were detected through restriction mapping (see Fig. 6) and nucleotide sequence analysis to identify the correct construct comprising truncated HPV 18L1 gene, which was named pPICZ-18Ll'. As secretion signal (a-factor signal) has been cleaved from the constructed plasmid, therefore the HPV 18L1 protein expressed should be intracellularly expressed protein.<br>
Example 9; Construction and expression of truncated HPV 18L1 gene-expressing strain<br>
9.1. Construction of truncated HPV 18L1 gene-expressing strain<br>
pPICZ-18Ll' plasmid was linearized with a restriction endonuclease enzyme Sad, and empty plasmid pPICZaB was likewise digested with Sad to serve as negative control. The enzyme digestion solution was added with absolute ethanol to obtain DNA precipitate. The linearized pPICZ-18Ll' fragment was dissolved with a small amount of double-distilled water and used to transform Pichia yeast strain X-33 (Invitrogen Corp.) by electroporation under the following conditions: DNA fragment, 5 ug; voltage, 1,500 volts; resistance, 25 omhs; electroporation time, 5 milliseconds. The electroporated cells were plated onto YPDS agar containing 200 u.g/ml zeocin (from Zeocin Co.). As the pPICZaB vector carried zeocin-resistance gene, the transformed cells were able to grow on YPDS media containing zeocin. Single colonies of transformed cells were isolated, thus obtaining truncated HPV 18L1 gene-expressing Pichia yeast strain.<br>
 <br>
9.2. Expression of truncated HPV 18L1 gene-expressing Pichia yeast strain<br>
The obtained truncated HPV 18L1 gene-expressing Pichia yeast strain was plated onto resistance plates containing 1,000 ug/ml or 1.500 ug/ml zeocin. Clones obtained from plates having high concentration of resistance were separately cultured in 4 mL of YPD liquid culture media for 24 hours followed by induction of gene expression in BMMY culture media for 48 hours. Then cells were harvested by centrifugation and some of the cells were disrupted to obtain supernatant for performing Western blotting identification. The result of identification is shown in Fig. 7, which indicated the presence of truncated HPV I8L1 protein in the supernatant.<br>
Although SEQ ID NO: 1 sequence was used for cloning and expression in Examples 8 and 9 of the present invention, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that similar results can be obtained when SEQ ID NO: 2 and 3 sequences are used for cloning and expression, and therefore these two sequences are also within the scope of the present invention. Moreover, those skilled in the art will, in light of the spirit of the present invention, readily construct similar sequences and clone and express the constructed sequences in Pichia yeast to obtain similar or better results, and therefore these sequences are also deemed to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 10. Large-scale expression and detection of truncated HPV 18L1 protein<br>
1. Large-scale expression of recombinant truncated HPV 18L1 protein<br>
Preparation of inoculum solution: One glycerol freezing tube of recombinant yeast stock was taken from working cell bank. After thawing, 100 µL of the stock was inoculated into 5 mL of YPD media and cultured at 280 rpm at 30°C for 20 hours, at which time OD600 was detected to be 1 to 2 and no contamination from other microorganisms was microscopically observed. 1 mL of the activation fluid (which has been tested to be satisfactory) was inoculated into 500 mL of YPD media and cultured at 280 rpm at 30°C for 20 hours., at which time OD60o was detected to be 2 to 6 and no contamination from other microorganisms was microscopically observed.<br>
Process of fermentation: Basal salt medium for fermentation was prepared using deionized water: BSM, (K2S04 273 g, MgS04 109 g, CaS042H20 17.6 g, H3PO4 400.5 mL, KOH 62 g, glycerol 600 g, PTMi 60 mL, defoamer 1 mL; add deionized water to a volume of 15 L). The prepared medium, which contained no antibiotics, was transferred into a 30 L fermentation tank (Bioengineering Co., Ltd) and sterilized in the tank at 121°C for 30 minutes, followed by cooling to 30°C. The inoculum solution previously prepared was used to inoculate the sterilized medium in a ratio of 1:15. Fermentation was started at a temperature of 30.0±0.5°C, an initial pH of 5.00±0.05, an initial stirring speed of 300 rpm, an aeration volume of 0.5 vvm and a dissolved oxygen (DO) of 100%, with addition of trace salts PTM, (CuS045H20 6.0 g, Nal 0.008 g, MnSO43.0 g, NaMo04 0.2 g, H3BO30.02 g, 2nSO420.0 g, CoCl20.5 g, FeSO4.7H2O 65.0 g, biotin 0.2 g, and H2SO45.0 mL; add deionized water to a volume of 1 L). The initial proliferation stage lasted for about 20 hours, during which time the dissolved oxygen was maintained at no lower than 30%. When the carbon source was completely consumed, the dissolved oxygen increased rapidly, at which time<br>
 <br>
the wet cell weight was up to about 100 g/L. In the initial two hours, the fermentation was supplemented with 50% (v/v) glycerol solution (added with 12 mL of PTM[ per liter) at a rate of 200 mL/h. Then the supplementation was continued at a rate of 300 mL/h for about 8 hours, during which time the dissolved oxygen was maintained at higher than 20% by adjusting the stirring speed, air flow and tank pressure (
Harvest of cells: The fermentation broth was centrifuged using a cryo-centrifuge to collect the cells, which were then weighed. The batch number, date and weight for the recovered cells were recorded, and the cells were sent for purification or stored at -20°C.<br>
2. Detection<br>
The purified (according to the method described in Example II below) truncated HPV 18L1 protein was used to prepare a protein concentration standard curve. With cells before induction as negative control, the expression amount of HPV 18L1 gene in Pichia yeast during fermentation was detected using sandwich ELISA method, as detailed below.<br>
Rabbit polyclonal antibody to HPV 18L1 protein was diluted 2,000 fold with coating solution. An aliquot of 0.1 mL of the diluted rabbit polyclonal antibody was added to each well of an ELISA plate, and the plate was incubated at 4°C overnight. Then the coating solution was removed from each well, which was then washed with 0.3 mL of PBST. Then, each well was blocked by incubating with 0.3 mL of blocking solution at 37°C for 2 hours.<br>
The purified HPV 18L1 protein was gradienrly diluted with dilution buffer from a concentration of 2 µg/mL to 0.0625 µg/mL. Meanwhile, the supernatant obtained from disrupted fermentation broth was diluted 200 fold. Then, for each of the HPV 18 LI protein solutions of different concentrations obtained by the serial dilution and for the diluted supernatant, an aliquot of 0.1 mL was taken and added to a separate well of the above-treated ELISA plate, and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. After incubation, the aliquot of antigen solution was removed from each well, which was then washed with 0.3 mL of washing buffer. Then, MAB885 mouse monoclonal antibody (purchased from CHEMICON Co., Ltd) was diluted 1,000 fold with dilution buffer, and an aliquot of 0.1 mL of the dilution was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Following incubation, the monoclonal antibody solution was removed from each well, which was then washed with 0.3 mL of washing buffer. Subsequently, each well was added with 0.1 mL of HRP labeled goat anti-mouse IgG obtained by diluting the IgG 5,000-fold with dilution buffer, and incubated at 37°C for 0.5 hour. Then the ELISA solution was removed and each well was washed with 0.3 mL of washing buffer. Then, each well was added with 0.1 mL DAB color<br>
 <br>
development solution, and interaction was allowed to occur at room temperature for 20 minutes. Afterwards. 0.05 mL of 2 M H2SO4 stop solution was added to each well to stop the reaction, and OD450 value was determined using an ELISA reader.<br>
The OD4S0 values for the gradiently diluted solutions of HPV 18L1 protein were used to prepare a protein concentration standard curve. Using this standard curve, the expression amount of truncated HPV 18L1 protein during fermentation was obtained, as shown in Table 5 below.<br>
Particularly speaking, the purified target protein stock solution with known concentrations was serially diluted into solutions of a range of concentrations, such as 2 µg/mL, I µg/mL, 0.5 µg/mL, 0.25 µg/mL and 0.125 µg/mL, which were used as standard concentrations. ELISA detection was conducted on these solutions to obtain the corresponding OD450 values. Then a standard linear regression equation was generated, with the ordinate representing the concentration and the abscissa representing the OD450 value.<br>
The supernatant obtained from the disrupted fermentation broth was serially diluted, such as being diluted 50 fold, 100 fold. 200 fold and 400 fold. OD45o values were detected for these serial dilutions, and the corresponding concentrations (u.g/mL) were found from the standard linear regression equation. The concentration of the target protein in the supernatant (ug/mL) was then calculated by multiplying the found concentration with the corresponding dilution factor. As the disrupted broth was prepared from wet cell weight : cell disruption buffer = 1:5, therefore the expression amout of the target protein in the wet cells (u.g/g wet cells) was 5 * the concentration of the target protein in the supernatant (ug/mL). And the concentration of expression of the target protein in the fermentation broth (ug/L fermentation broth) was obtained by multiplying the above-obtained expression amount of the target protein in the wet cells with the density of cells in the fermentation broth {g wet cells/L fermentation broth).<br>
Concentration of the target protein in the supernatant obtained from the disrupted fermentation broth (ug/mL) = Dilution factor x Concentration of standard target protein concentration (ug/mL) x OD450 (supernatant obtained from the disrupted fermentation broth) / OD450 (standard target protein concentration);<br>
Concentration of the expressed target protein in the fermentation broth (ug/L fermentation broth) = 5 x Concentration of the target protein in the supernatant obtained from the disrupted fermentation broth (u.g/mL) x Density of cells in the fermentation broth (g wet cells/L fermentation broth).<br>

It can be seen from the results shown in Table 5 that, the optimized sequence of the gene for HPV 18L1 protein according to the present invention not only can be expressed into HPV 18L1 protein in Pichia yeast, but also has a high expression amount, meeting the requirements of industrial production.<br>
Example 11: Purification of truncated HPV 18L1 protein<br>
Cleaning: The above-obtained Pichia yeast cells expressing truncated HPV 18 LI protein, which had been stored at -20°C, was thawed at room temperature. Then the thawed cells were mixed with washing bufer (100 mM PB, pH 7.0, 0.15 M NaCl) or water for purification in a ratio of 1:3 (g/mL), and completely homogenized with the buffer or water in a homogenizer (FLUKO). Subsequently, the homogenate was subjected to high speed centrifugation (SORVALLRC6PLUS) at 8000 rpm for 5 minutes to separate the cells, the supernatant being decanted. The above procedure was repeated twice, thereby achieving the cleaning of the cells.<br>
Disruption: The cleaned cells were added and mixed into cell disruption buffer (100 mM MOPS, 0.75M NaCl, 0.05% Tween-80, pH 7.0) in a ratio of 1:5 (g/mL), and completely homogenized with the buffer in a homogenizer (FLUKO). The cells suspended in the homogenate were subjected to disruption using a high-pressure homogenizer (ATSAH110B) operating at a pressure in the range of 1200 to 1300 bars. This disruption was repeated four times, and then the disrupted cell solution was discharged at 4 to 8°C, with 90% of the cells being disrupted.<br>
Clarification: The disrupted cell solution obtained by high-pressure disruption as above was poured into a centrifugation cup and centrifuged at high speed to remove cell debris, obtaining supernatant for subsequent column chromatography separation. The centrifuge used is SORVALLRC6PLUS, rotor model: F1BERL1TEF10-6x5OOy, centrifugation setting: 9,000 rpm, 30 min, 10°C.<br>
Preliminary purification: Chromatography media POROS 50HS (Applied Biosystems) was loaded into a chromatography column (diameter 26 mm, height 10, volume 50 mL). Preliminary purification was conducted in the following steps: (1) washing and disinfection: the column was washed with two column volumes of 0.5 M NaOH; (2) regeneration and equilibration: the column was washed with two column volumes of Buffer F and then equilibrated with Buffer E; (3) loading sample: the supernatant obtained by centrifuging the disrupted cell solution as above was loaded<br>
 <br>
onto the column; (4) rinsing: the column was rinsed with five column volumes of Buffer E until the baseline stabilized; (5) elution: the column was eluted with a linear gradient of 100% Buffer E to 100% Buffer F in a total elution volume of six column volumes; and (6) collection: the chromatographic peaks having a conductivity in the range of 70 to 100 ms/cm were collected and stored at 4°C.<br>
Fine purification: Chromatography media CHT (BIO-RAD, Type II, 40 u.m) was loaded into a chromatography column (diameter 26 mm, height 10 cm, volume 50 mL). Fine purification was conducted in the following steps: (1) washing and disinfection: the column was washed with two column volumes of 0.5 M NaOH; (2) regeneration and equilibration: the column was washed with two column volumes of Buffer H and then equilibrated with Buffer G; (3) loading sample: the sample collected after preliminary purification was added with PB to a final concentration of 30 mM and then loaded onto the column; and (4) rinsing: the column was rinsed with five column volumes of Buffer G until the baseline stabilized: (5) elution: the column was eluted with a linear gradient of 100% Buffer G to 100% Buffer H: and (6) collection: the elution fractions were collected and the fractions containing truncated HPV 18LI protein were combined to obtain the final purified sample. The purified sample was reduced to monomeric proteins which were then subjected to reduced SDS-PAGE (Bio-RAD), demonstrating a purity of greater than 90% (see Fig.<br>
8).<br>
Western blot (Bio-RAD) detection showed specific staining reaction between target electrophoresis band and monoclonal or polyclonal antibody to HPV 18 LI protein (see Fig. 9). Dynamic light scattering detection (Malvern Instruments Zetasizer Nano ZS) showed that the purified sample had particles in a size range of about 50 to 80 nm, and electron microscopy observation (Philips Tecnai-12Biotwin transmission electron microscope, Electron Microscope Laboratory, Science and Technology Center, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, China) revealed virus-like particles (VLPs) in the purified sample, with the particle size in the range of about 50 to 80 nm (see Fig. 10). The full-length HPV 18L1 protein expressed as described hereinabove, when purified in the same manner, also afforded purified VLPs which were revealed by dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy detection to have the same particle size as truncated HPV 18L1 protein particles, ranging from 50 to 80 nm.<br>
Example 12: Preparation of truncated HPV 18L1 vaccine<br>
The purified HPV 18L1 protein obtained in Example 11 above was adsorbed to an aluminium adjuvant to prepare an immunogenic HPV 18L1 vaccine according to the method described in Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2005 edition).<br>
Example 13. Determination of immunogenicitv of the expression product of truncated HPV 18L1 gene<br>
Twenty-four 6 to 8 weeks old SPF BALB/c mice were divided into 4 groups, with 6 mice in each group. Mice in the first group (as the negative control group) were immunized by hypodermic injection of 0.1 mL of aluminium adjuvant-containing buffer (0.32 M sodium chloride, 0.35 mM<br>
 <br>
sodium borate, 0.01% Tweeri-80, 0.01 M histidine, pH 6.5) for three times on days 0, 7 and 21 respectively, and mice in the other three groups (as the test groups) were similarly immunized with 0.1 mL of aluminium adjuvant-adsorbed VLPs at a concentration of 5 µg/mL. 0.5 ng/mL and 0.05 ug/mL respectively. Blood samples were collected two weeks after the third immunization. The blood samples collected were stood at 37°C for 2 hours and then centrifuged at 4,000 g for 10 minutes. The supernatant, which was obtained as mouse polyclonal antiserum, was aspirated and stored at -20°C. Additionally, the supernatant was assayed for seroconversion rate and titer, as detailed below.<br>

An aliquot of 0.1 mL of the dilution was added into each well of an ELISA plate, and the plate was incubated at 4°C overnight. The coating solution was removed from each well, which was then washed with 0.3 mL of PBST. Then, each we/f was blocked by incubating with 0.3 mL of blocking solution (5% skimmed milk powder + PBST) at 37°C for 2 hours. Each well was added with 0.1 mL of test serum (sera obtained from mice immunized with aluminium adjuvant-adsorbed HPV I8L1 protein and serum obtained from mice immunized with aluminium adjuvant alone) solution obtained by diluting the serum with dilution buffer (2% skimmed milk powder + PBST) in a ratio of 1:400, and then incubated at 37°C for 1 hour.

An aliquot of 0.1 mL of the dilution was added into each well of an ELISA plate, and the plate was incubated at 4°C overnight. The coating solution was removed from each well, which was then washed with 0.3 mL of PBST. Then, each well was blocked by incubating with 0.3 mL of blocking solution (5% skimmed milk powder + PBST) at 37°C for 2 hours. The test sera (sera obtained from mice immunized with HPV 18LI protein) was serially double diluted with dilution buffer (2% skimmed milk powder + PBST) from 1:500 dilution to 1:32,000 dilution, while the negative control serum (serum obtained from mice immunized with aluminium adjuvant) was diluted in a ratio of 1:10,000. Each well was added with an aliquot of 0.1 mL of diluted serum (test serum or negative control serum) and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Then the test serum solution was removed and each well was washed with 0.3 mL of washing buffer. Subsequently, each well was added with 0.1 mL of HRP labeled goat anti-mouse IgG obtained by diluting the IgG with dilution buffer in a ratio of 1:5,000, and incubated at 37°C for 0.5 hour.

In summary, as shown in Examples 1-13, the gene for major capsid protein LI of human papilloma virus subtype 18 or the gene for truncated major capsid protein LI of human papilloma virus subtype 18, as provided by the present invention, is an optimized LI gene, which has the advantages of being more suitable for efficiently expressing target protein in yeast host and meeting the requirements of industrial production. Moreover, the HPV 18L1 vaccine as provided<br>
 <br>
by the present invention can be self-assembled into the structure of VLPs. The vaccine was demonstrated to be strongly immunogenic in mice as determined by seroconversion rate and serum titer with the adjuvant-adsorbed purified VLPs. Further, the method has the advantages of low cost high yield, and more uniform and stable quality of products due to the use of Pichia yeast expression system.<br>
Example 14. Neutralization activity of truncated HPV 18 LI VLPs<br>
Mice were immunized with the same procedure as described above and blood was collected two weeks after immunization. The collected blood was stood at 37°C for 2 hours, then centrifuged at 4.000 g for 10 minutes. The supernatant, which was obtained as mouse polyclonal antiserum, was aspirated and stored at -20°C.<br>
293FTcells (Invitrogen) were initially plated onto 15 cm ceil culture dish (l.Ixl07 cells/dish). Twenty-four hours later, the cells were cotransfected with plasmids pl8Llh, pl8L2h (Buck CB, Pastrana DV. Lowy DR et al. Efficient Intracellular Assembly of Papillomaviral Vectors. J Virol, 2004, 78(2):751-757) and green fluorescent gene-carrying pIRES2-EGFP (purchased from BD Biosciences Clontech) respectively in an amount of 20 ug, 10 ug and 10 ug using calcium phosphate transfection method. Forty-eight hours later, cells were observed, collected and lysed. Cell lysis supernatant was immediately subjected to purification or stored at -80°C.<br>
Purification was performed by centrifuging the ceil lysis supernatant in a 5 mL centrifugation tube (Beckman) using 30% OptiPrep density gradient centrifugation at 100,000 g at 16°C for 4 hours (MLS-50 centrifuge rotor, Beckman ultra-speed centrifuge). The centrifugation fractions were collected, each fraction being about 500 uL. and assayed for the content of HPV 18 Li protein using Western blotting. The fractions having highest concentration of LI protein were combined as pseudotype virus solution, which was then aliquoted and stored at -80°C.<br>
293FT cells were plated onto 24-well cell culture plate (1.5xI05 cells/well). Twenty-four hours later, neutralization experiment was done as follows. Different serum samples were serially diluted 100-fold with DMEM medium. An aliquot of 50 uL of each dilution was mixed with 50 uL of the pseudotype virus solution diluted in DMEM medium, and each mixture was incubated at 4°C for 1 hour. Then each incubated mixture was added into the 24-weil cell culture plate pre-plated with 293FT cells and incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. After incubation, the cells were observed for expression of green fluorescent protein under an OLUMPUSCKX41F32FL inverted fluorescence microscope, and fluorescence images were collected, as shown in Figs. I la and lib. Fluorescence was seen in Fig. 11a, which indicates that the HPV 18 pseudotype virus had infected the 293FT cells. Little fluorescence remained in Fig. lib, which indicates that mouse serum had neutralized the HPV 18 pseudotype virus, thereby reducing the viral infection of the 293FT cells. It is therefore clear that mice immunized with recombinant HPV 18L1 VLPs vaccine could generate neutralizing antibody which would inhibit entry of the pseudotype virus into cells,<br>
In the present invention, nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO: 2 or 3 and nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO: 5 or 6 can respectively be substituted for SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 4 in the above examples to prepare HPV 18 LI protein and truncated form thereof of the present invention<br>
 <br>
using the methods as described in the above examples. In addition, the above-said genes can also be cloned, in appropriate cloning manner, into other existing Pichr'a yeast expression vector, such as pPIC6, pGAPZ or pA0815. Then the recombinant expression vectors obtained can be used to transform other Pichia yeast strains, such as Pichiapaslohs GS115, KM71 or SMD1168 strains, so as to construct genetically engineered strains. Using conventional methods of culturing and fermentation, and separation and purification {which are not detailed herein), HPV 18 LI protein (HPV 18 LI VLPs) or truncated form thereof of the present invention can be obtained from the genetically engineered strains. Thus prepared HPV 18 LI protein or truncated form thereof will have similar immunogenicity to that of the HPV 18 LI protein or truncated form thereof prepared in the above examples.<br>
Example 15: Design and synthesis of codon-optimized gene for HPV 16 LI<br>
15.1.	Design of codon-optimized gene for HPV 16 LI<br>
The present invention relates to DNA molecules encoding the major capsid protein L! of human papilloma virus subtype 16 (HPV 16), which have been codon-optimized with codons preferred by Pichia yeast. Three DNA sequences, which are as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 7, 8 and 9, respectively, were obtained through optimization of codons and alteration of optimized codons, as detailed below.<br>
Firstly, through repeated experiments, modifications were made on the naturally-occurring gene encoding HPV 16L1 by optimizing the codons for all the corresponding amino acids of the gene to design a novel HPV DNA sequence, that is, SEQ ID NO:7.<br>
Then, in order to avoid the presence of a high GC ratio in the transcribed mRNAs, the influence of mRNA secondary structure on the efficiency of translation, and the occurrence of common restriction sites, alterations were made to the optimized codons, such as, the codon for asparagine (Asn) being altered from AAC to AAT, the codon for lysine (Lys) being altered from AAG to AAA, the codon for aspartic acid (Asp) being altered from GAT to GAC, the codon for phenylalanine (Phe) being altered from TTT to TTC, the codon for tyrosine (Tyr) being altered from TAC to TAT, and the codon for glycine (Gly) being altered from GGT to GGA, thus obtaining two novel HPV DNA sequences, wherein:<br>
SEQ ID NO: 8 is the DNA sequence obtained from SEQ ID NO: 7 by altering the codons for asparagine (Asn), lysine (Lys) and aspartic acid (Asp); SEQ ID NO: 9 is the DNA sequence obtained from SEQ ID NO: 7 by altering the codons for phenylalanine (Phe), tyrosine (Tyr) and glycine (Gly).<br>
15.2.	Synthesis of codon-optimized gene for HPV 16 LI<br>
The codon-optimized gene for HPV 16 LI as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 7 was synthesized and used as template to perform PCR amplification using primers al and a2 which have the following sequences:<br>
al: 5'-ATAGAATTCATGTCTTTGTGGTTGCCATC-3'(SEQIDNO: 16);<br>
 <br>
a2: 5'-ATAGGTACCCTAlTACAACTTTCTCTTCTTT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 17).<br>
The PCR products obtained were subjected to separation by agarose gel electrophoresis and the target sequence was recovered from the gel, obtaining a fragment about 1.5 kb in size. This fragment was sequenced, with the result of sequencing as shown in SEQ ID NO: 7, and was demonstrated from the result to be the full-length codon-optimized gene for HPV 16L1. Thus obtained gene for HPV I6LL by virtue of the EcoRI and Kpnl restriction sites on its ends, was ligated into pUCIS piasmid (available from Generay Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China)). The resulting construct was verified by sequencing to be correct, and was named as pUC-16Ll.<br>
Codon-optimized genes for HPV 16L1 as shown in SEQ ID NO: 8 and 9 were obtained in a similar procedure as above.<br>
In order to verify the feasibility of the optimized sequences, one of the codon-optimized genes for HPV 16L1 obtained in this Example 15 (SEQ ID NO: 7) was exemplarily used to construct an expression piasmid to assess for its expression as follows.<br>
Example 16: Construction of expression vector of HPV 16L1 gene<br>
The optimized sequence of SEQ ID "NO: 7 was cloned into Pichia yeast expression vector as shown in Fig. 12 and as detailed in the following steps.<br>
16.1.	The forward and reverse primers having the following sequences, which were required for<br>
amplifying HPV 16L1 gene, were synthesized:<br>
forward primer: 5'-ACTAATTATTCGAAACGATGTCTTTGTGG-3; (SEQ JD NO: 18);<br>
reverse primer: 5'-AGCGGTACCCTATTACAACTTTCTCTTCTTTC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 19).<br>
Wherein the forward primer comprises a BstBI restriction site, and the reverse primer comprises a Kpnl restriction site flanking the termination codon, said restriction sites respectively as shown in the underlined portions of the primer sequences above.<br>
16.2.	PCR amplification was performed using the above primers and using the pUC-16Ll obtained<br>
in Example 15 as template. The amplified product was detected by electrophoresis, with the result<br>
being shown in Fig. 13, demonstrating that a full-length codon-optimized gene for HPV 16L1 was<br>
obtained. The PCR amplified fragment was digested with BstBI and Kpnl (restriction<br>
endonucleases) and then ligated with pPICZaB (Invitrogen Corp.) which was also digested with<br>
BstBI and Kpnl. Then, the ligated construct was used to transform competent cells of E. coli ToplO<br>
strain (available from Generay Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China)), and the<br>
transformed cells were plated onto LB agar containing 25 u.g/ml of zeocin.<br>
The transformed cells were able to grow on LB media containing zeocin as the pPICZaB vector carried zeocin-resistance gene. Single colonies of the transformed cells were separated to prepare piasmid DNA. HPV 16LI gene and vector sequence were detected through restriction mapping (see Fig. 14) and nucleotide sequence analysis to identify the correct construct comprising HPV 16L1 gene, which was named pPICZ-16Ll. As secretion signal (a-factor signal)<br>
 <br>
has been cleaved from the constructed plasm id, therefore the HPV 16LI protein expressed should be intracellular!)' expressed protein.<br>
Example 17: Construction and expression of HPV 16L1 gene-expressing Pichia yeast strain<br>
17.1.	Construction of HPV 16LI gene-expressing Pichia yeast strain<br>
pPlCZ-16Ll plasmid was linearized with a restriction endonuclease enzyme Sad, and empty plasmid pPlCZaB was likewise digested with Sacl to serve as negative control. The enzyme digestion solution was added with absolute ethanol to obtain DNA precipitate. The linearized pPICZ-16Ll fragment was dissolved with a small amount of double-distilled water and used to transform Pichia yeast strain X-33 (Invitrogen Corp.) by electroporation under the following conditions: DNA fragment, 5 µg; voltage, 1,500 volts; resistance, 25 omhs; electroporation time, 5 milliseconds. The electroporated celts were plated onto YPDS agar containing 200 u.g/ml zeocin (from Zeocin). As the pPICZaB vector carried zeocin-resistance gene, the transformed cells were able to grow on YPDS media containing zeocin. Single colonies of transformed cells were isolated, thus obtaining HPV 16L1 gene-expressing Pichia yeast strain.<br>
17.2.	Expression of HPV 16L1 gene-expressing Pichia yeast strain<br>
The obtained HPV 16L1 gene-expressing Pichia yeast strain was plated onto resistance plates containing 1,000 µg/ml or 1,500 µg/ml zeocin. Clones obtained from plates having high concentration of resistance were separately cultured in 4 mL of YPD liquid culture media for 24 hours followed by induction of gene expression in BMMY culture media for 48 hours. Then cells were harvested by centrifugation and some of the cells were disrupted to obtain supernatant for performing Western blotting identification. The result of identification is shown in Fig. 15, which indicated the presence of HPV 16L1 protein in the supernatant.<br>
Although SEQ ID NO: 7 sequence was used for cloning and expression in Examples 16 and 17 of the present invention, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that similar results can be obtained when SEQ ID NO: 8 and 9 sequences are used for cloning and expression, and therefore these two sequences are also within the scope of the present invention. Moreover, those skilled in the art will, in light of the spirit of the present invention, readily construct similar sequences and clone and express the constructed sequences in Pichia yeast to obtain similar or better results, and therefore these sequences are also deemed to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 18. Large-scale expression and detection of HPV 16L1 protein<br>
1. Large-scale expression of recombinant HPV 16L1 protein<br>
Preparation of inoculum solution: One glycerol freezing tube of recombinant yeast stock was taken from working cell bank. After thawing, 100 µL of the stock was inoculated into 5 mL of YPD media and cultured at 280 rpm at 30°C for 20 hours, at which time OD60owas detected to be 1 to 2 and no contamination from other microorganisms was microscopically observed. 1 mL of<br>
 <br>
the activation fluid (which has been inspected to be satisfactory) was inoculated into 500 mL of YPD media and cultured at 280 rpm at 30°C for 20 hours, at which time OD600Was detected to be 2 to 6 and no contamination from other microorganisms was microscopically observed.<br>
Process of fermentation: Basal salt medium for fermentation was prepared using deionized water: BSM, (K2SO
Harvest of cells: The fermentation broth was centrifuged using a refrigerated centrifuge to collect the cells, which were then weighed. The batch number, date and weight for the recovered cells were recorded, and the cells were sent for purification or stored at -20°C.<br>
2. Detection<br>
The purified (according to the method described in Example 19 below) HPV 16L1 protein was used to prepare a protein concentration standard curve. With cells before induction as negative control, the expression amount of HPV 16L1 gene in Pichia yeast during fermentation was detected using sandwich ELISA method, as detailed below.<br>
Rabbit polyclonal antibody to HPV16L1 protein was diluted 2,000 fold with coating solution. An aliquot of 0.1 mL of the diluted rabbit polyclonal antibody was added to each well of an ELISA plate, and the plate was incubated at 4°C overnight. The coating solution was removed from each<br>
 <br>
well, which was then washed with 0.3 mL of PBST. Then, each well was blocked by incubating with 0.3 mL of blocking solution at 37°C for 2 hours.<br>
The purified HPV 16L1 protein was gradiently diluted with dilution buffer from a concentration of 2 ug/mL to 0.0625 u.g/mL. Meanwhile, the supernatant obtained from disrupted fermentation broth was diluted 200 fold. Then, for each of the HPV 16 LI protein solutions of different concentrations obtained by the serial dilution and for the diluted supernatant, an aliquot of 0.1 mL was taken and added to a separate well of the ELISA plate, and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. After incubation, the aliquot of antigen solution was removed from each well, which was then washed with 0.3 mL of washing buffer. Then. MAB885 mouse monoclonal antibody (purchased from CHEMICON Co., Ltd) was diluted 1,000 fold with dilution buffer, and an aliquot of 0.1 mL of the dilution was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for I hour. Following incubation, the monoclonal antibody solution was removed from each well, which was then washed with 0.3 mL of washing buffer. Subsequently, each well was added with 0.1 mL of HRP labeled goat anti-mouse IgG obtained by diluting the IgG 5.000-fold with dilution buffer, and incubated at 37°C for 0.5 hour. Then the ELISA solution was removed and each well was washed with 0.3 mL of washing buffer. Then, each well was added with 0.1 mL DAB color development solution, and interaction was allowed to occur at room temperature for 20 minutes. Afterwardes, 0.05 mL of 2 M H2SO4 stop solution was added to each well to stop the reaction, and OD450 value was determined using an ELISA reader.<br>
The OD450 values for the gradiently diluted solutions of HPV 16L1 protein were used to prepare a protein concentration standard curve. Using this standard curve, the expression amount of HPV 16L1 protein during fermentation was obtained, as shown in Table 9 below. Particularly speaking, the purified target protein stock solution with known concentration was serially diluted into solutions of a range of concentrations, such as 2 µg/mL, 1 µg/mL, 0.5 ug/mL, 0.25 µg/mL and 0.125 ug/mL, which were used as standard concentrations. ELISA detection was conducted on these solutions to obtain the corresponding OD450 values. Then a standard linear regression equation was generated, with the ordinate representing the concentration and the abscissa representing the OD450 value.<br>
The supernatant obtained from the disrupted fermentation broth was serially diluted, such as being diluted 50 fold, 100 fold, 200 fold and 400 fold. OD450 values were detected for these serial dilutions, and the corresponding concentrations (ug/mL) were found from the standard linear regression equation. The concentration of the target protein in the supernatant (µg/mL) was then calculated by multiplying the found concentration with the corresponding dilution factor. As the disrupted broth was prepared from wet cell weight : cell disruption buffer = 1:5, therefore the expression amout of the target protein in the wet cells (µg/g wet cells) was 5 x the concentration of the target protein in the supernatant (µg/mL). And the concentration of expression of the target protein in the fermentation broth (µg/L fermentation broth) was obtained by multiplying the above-obtained expression amount of the target protein in the wet cells with the density of cells in the fermentation broth (g wet cells/L fermentation broth).<br>
Concentration of the target protein in the supernatant obtained from the disrupted fermentation<br>
 <br>
broth (ug/mL) = Dilution factor x Concentration of standard target protein (µg/mL) x OD450 (supernatant obtained from the disrupted fermentation broth) / OD450 (standard target protein concentration);<br>
Concentration of expression of the target protein in the fermentation broth (µg/L fermentation broth) = 5 x Concentration of the target protein in the supernatant obtained from the disrupted fermentation broth (ug/mL) * Density of cells in the fermentation broth (g wet cells/L fermentation broth).<br>

It can be seen from the results shown in Table 9 that, the optimized sequence of the gene for HPV 16L1 protein according to the present invention not only can be expressed into HPV 16L1 protein in Pichia yeast, but also has a high expression amount, meeting the requirements of industrial production.<br>
Example 19: Purification of HPV 16L1 protein<br>
Cleaning: The above-obtained Pichia yeast cells expressing HPV 16 LI protein, which had been stored at -20°C, was thawed at room temperature. Then the thawed cells were mixed with washing buffer (100 mM PB, pH 7.0, 0.15 M NaCl) or water for purification in a ratio of 1:3 (g/mL), and completely homogenized with the buffer or water in a homogenizer (FLUKO). Subsequently, the homogenate was subjected to high speed centrifugation (SORVALLRC6PLUS) at 8000 rpm for 5 minutes to separate the cells, the supernatant being decanted. The above procedure was repeated twice, thereby achieving the cleaning of the cells,<br>

Twenty-four 6 to 8 weeks old SPF BALB/c mice were divided into 4 groups, with 6 mice in each group. Mice in the first group (as the negative control group) were immunized by hypodermic injection of 0.1 mL of aluminium adjuvant-containing buffer (0.32 M sodium chloride. 0.35 mM sodium borate. 0.01% Tween-80, 0.01 M histidine, pH 6.5) for three times on days 0, 7 and 21 respectively, and mice in the other three groups (as the test groups) were similarly immunized with 0.1 mL of aluminium adjuvant-adsorbed VLPs at a concentration of 5 u.g/mL, 0.5 ug/mL and 0.05 ug/mL respectively.

J Virol, 2004, 78(2):751-757) and green fluorescent gene-carrying p1RES2-EGFP (purchased from BD Biosciences Clontech) respectively in an amount of 20 µg, 10 µg and 10 µg using calcium phosphate transfection method. Forty-eight hours later, cells were observed, collected and lysed. Cell lysis supernatant was immediately subjected to purification or stored at -80°C.<br>
Purification was performed by centrifuging the cell lysis supernatant in a 5 mL centrifugation tube (Beckman) using 30% OptiPrep density gradient centrifugation at 100,000 g at 16°C for 4 hours (MLS-50 centrifuge head, Beckman ultra-speed centrifuge). The centrifugation fractions were collected, each fraction being about 500 µL, and assayed for the content of HPV 16 LI protein using Western blotting. The fractions having highest concentration of LI protein were combined as pseudotype virus solution, which was then aliquoted and stored at -80°C.<br>
293FT cells were plated onto24-weII cell culture plate (1.5x105 cells/well). Twenty-four hours<br>
 <br>
later, neutralization experiment was done as follows. Different serum samples were serially diluted 100-fold with DMEM medium. An aliquot of 50 uL of each dilution was mixed with 50 uL of the pseudotype virus solution diluted in DMEM medium, and each mixture was incubated at 4°C for I hour. Then each incubated mixture was added into the 24-well cell culture plate pre-plated with 293FT cells and incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. After incubation, the cells were observed for expression of green fluorescent protein under an OLUMPUSCKX4JF32FL inverted fluorescence microscope, and fluorescence images were collected, as shown in Figs. 19. Fluorescence was seen in Fig. 19A, which indicates that the HPV 16 pseudotype virus had infected the 293FT cells. Little fluorescence remained in Fig. I9B, which indicates that mouse serum had neutralized the HPV 16 pseudotype virus, thereby reducing the viral infection of the 293FT cells. It is therefore clear that mice immunized with recombinant HPV 16L1 VLPs vaccine could generate neutralizing antibody which would inhibit entry of the pseudotype virus into cells.<br>
In the present invention, nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO: 8 or SEQ ID NO: 9 can be substituted for SEQ ID NO: 7 in the above examples to prepare HPV 16 LI protein of the present invention using the methods as described in the above examples. In addition, the above-said genes can also be cloned, in appropriate manner, into other existing Pichia yeast expression vector, such as pPIC6, pGAPZ or pA08l5. Then the recombinant expression vectors obtained can be used to transform other Pichia yeast strains, such as Pichia pastor is GS115, K.M71 or SMD1168 strains, so as to construct genetically engineered strains. Using conventional methods of culturing and fermentation, and separation and purification (which are not detailed herein), HPV 16 LI protein (HPV 16 LI VLPs) of the present invention can be obtained from the genetically engineered strains. The thus prepared HPV 16 LI protein will have similar immunogenicity to that of the HPV 16 LI protein prepared in the above examples.<br>
