Method for Adjusting the Transmission of Printing Ink<br>
The invention pertains to a method for adjusting the transmission of printing ink<br>
according to the introductory part of claim 1.<br>
The document DE 694 02 737 T2 presents a temperature regulated system for printing<br>
machines, whereby a compression machine selectively offers tempering agents for<br>
tempering of inking rollers of several printing mechanisms for cooling as well as heating<br>
purposes. This takes place by means of selective feeding a heat exchanger with<br>
compressed tempering agent subsequently cooled in a condenser and finally de-stressed,<br>
and hence hot tempering agent. Either cooling or heating of a secondary tempering agent<br>
circulation now takes place in the heat exchanger. Temperature regulation takes place by<br>
means of dosage with this tempering agent on the basis of a temperature sensor and a<br>
regulating valve for each individual roller.<br>
The document DE 296 08 045 Ul shows a system for tempering, whereby for cooling the<br>
damping agent a first cooling unit with a first cooling process and a first fluid circulation<br>
is foreseen, which on the one hand is thermally coupled with the damping agent supply<br>
circulation of the damping agent through a heat exchanger, and on the other hand,<br>
thermally coupled with a second fluid circulation through a second heat exchanger, which<br>
on its part is thermally coupled with a cooling process designed as cooling tower.<br>
The document DE 44 26 083 Al presents a tempering device, where a tempering fluid<br>
can be guided for tempering a roller in its circulation, either through a heat exchanger in<br>
thermal contact with a cooling fluid circulation or even a heating heat exchanger.<br>
From the documents WO 03/045694 Al and WO 03/045695 Al we know about methods<br>
in which through tempering of a rotating component of a printing mechanism working<br>
together with the printing ink, an easy flow of the ink on the rotating component can be<br><br>
2<br>
kept largely constant in a temperature range of 22°C to 50°C, whereby the easy flow of<br>
ink depends on the temperature on the jacket surface of the rotating component and its<br>
production speed. This application is particularly found in waterless printing<br>
mechanisms, preferably in the printing mechanism for newspaper printing.<br>
The document EP 0 652 104 A1 reveals a printing mechanism for waterless offset<br>
printing with a regulating unit with several regulators, which for avoiding build-up of ink<br>
on a transmission cylinder of a printing mechanism regulate, depending on the fluctuation<br>
of a form cylinder of a printing mechanism allocated to the transmission cylinder or with<br>
a thermo-sensor on the transmission cylinder or an ink rolling cylinder of a inking<br>
mechanism allocated to the form cylinder, the determined temperature from a rated value<br>
with the help of a regulating valve for regulating a cooling agent fed to the respective<br>
cylinder, e.g. water. While printing, with the help of the regulated cooling agent quantity<br>
it should be possible to maintain a constant temperature of the print form arranged on the<br>
form cylinder, e.g. in a temperature range of 28°C to 30°C. The temperature of the<br>
transmission cylinder should be maintained at approx. 34°C to 35°C and the temperature<br>
of the inking mechanism between 25°C and 27°C. By feeding the cooling agent quantity<br>
there is also the possibility of pre-heating of the printing mechanism, so that cracking of<br>
the printing ink at the beginning of printing can be avoided on account of accumulation<br>
of paper particles in the printing mechanism, whereby a temperature flow of the cooling<br>
agent for pre-heating can be regulated according to a temperature-time-graph fed to the<br>
storage unit accommodated in the regulating unit.<br>
From the document DE 197 36 339 A1/B4 we know of a tempering device in a printing<br>
mechanism, whereby through tempering the rheological properties of the printing ink can<br>
be influenced, e.g. its viscosity or easy flow. The allied printing machine with a form<br>
cylinder has a short inking mechanism with an ink well, a screen roller and an inking<br>
roller. At least one of the inking mechanism rollers or the form cylinders can be<br>
tempered by the tempering unit. The tempering takes place by cooling or heating either<br>
from the jacket surface of the inking mechanism rollers or the form cylinder or in the<br>
interior of the inking mechanism rollers or the form cylinder. Additionally, also the ink<br><br>
3<br>
well can be tempered and particularly also the wipers for wiping excess ink from the<br>
screen rollers. The quantity of ink transmitted to the form cylinder can be regulated by<br>
means of a regulating cycle, whereby the optical density measured on the printing<br>
substance serves as signal parameter, on the basis of which the regulators allocated to the<br>
tempering unit regulate their temperature.<br>
The document DE-OS 19 53 590 presents a printing mechanism with an inking<br>
mechanism and a damping device that can be tempered with the help of a tempering unit.<br>
A rated value for the temperature can be determined in relationship to influence<br>
parameters, e.g. the printing speed, before starting of the printing process with the help of<br>
trial print, or can be set with the help of a table. An advantageous upper limit of the<br>
temperature of the printing ink is given with room temperature.<br>
From the document DE 39 04 854 Cl it is known that the rotation speed of the cylinder<br>
of the printing mechanism, the inking mechanism and the damping device have an<br>
influence on the inking mechanism temperature.<br>
In the document DE 44 31 188 Al a print form of a printing mechanism for waterless<br>
offset printing is cooled with the help of a cooling device to approx. 28 to 30°C.<br>
From the document DE 102 45 702 Al we know of a method for controlling the ink<br>
guiding in a machine processing print substances with at least one printing ink, where at<br>
least the physical properties of printing ink and/or print substances are known as data to a<br>
computer, whereby the stored data is read in a ink control model stored in the computer<br>
and on the basis of this ink control model the optimum settings with respect to ink<br>
guiding before commencement of printing or during the printing sequence can be taken<br>
up.<br>
It is the task of this invention to create a method for adjusting the transmission of printing<br>
ink.<br><br>
4<br>
This task is fulfilled according to the invention by means of the features given in claim 1.<br>
The advantages achieved through the invention are, on the one hand, that an adjustment<br>
and/or adaptation of the respective rated temperature on the jacket surface of the form<br>
cylinder or on the jacket surface of the first roller for different printing inks or ink types<br>
is possible for the operating personnel of a printing machine in a comfortable manner in a<br>
display and/or input mask on a monitor of an input and output unit of an adjusting device,<br>
because corresponding ink specific graphs or support points defining a correlation<br>
between a production speed of the printing machine and the respective rated temperature<br>
on the jacket surface of the form cylinder or the jacket surface of the first roller are stored<br>
in a storage unit of the adjusting device and can be displayed in the display mask and/or<br>
input mask, can be selected and altered.<br>
Besides it is advantageous that a conveying rate of a roller sourcing printing ink from a<br>
reservoir and transmitting it to an adjacent rotation body, for example a screen roller, is<br>
kept almost constant, so that on increasing the production speed of the printing machine<br>
in spite of a decrease in the capacity of the screen roller for transmitting printing ink as a<br>
result of an increasing incomplete emptying of its cups an almost uniform ink quantity is<br>
conveyed to the printing substance; and on the other hand, by adjusting the temperature<br>
on the jacket surface of particularly the formed cylinder in relation to the production<br>
speed of the printing machine, easy flow of the ink transported from the form cylinder<br>
can be maintained in a suitable range value-wise for the printing process, so that<br>
especially cracking of the ink on the surface of the printing substance can be avoided.<br>
The ink is adapted to the actual printing process in relationship to the production speed of<br>
the printing machine with respect to its fission capacity and adhesion capacity by<br>
appropriate adjustment of its temperature, whereby adjustment of its temperature<br>
indirectly takes place by adjusting the temperature on the jacket surface of a rotation<br>
body guiding this printing ink. In order to avoid wastage as a result of unsuitable<br>
temperature-dependent properties of the printed ink, in case of an intended alteration in<br>
production speed of the printing machine, the different time parameters for conducting<br>
the adaptation of temperature of the ink and for conducting the adaptation of the<br><br>
5<br>
production speed of the printing machine should be taken into account. There is also the<br>
possibility of manually altering a machine setting within certain limits and thus carrying<br>
out fine-tuning and of producing a good quality for the print product. All these measures<br>
contribute towards maintaining a high quality level of a print product produced with the<br>
printing machine in spite of alteration of the production speed of the printing machine.<br>
Design examples of the invention are shown in the drawing and are described in more<br>
details below.<br>

6<br>
Fig. 1 shows in a highly simplified depiction four printing mechanisms 01; 02; 03; 04 of<br>
an offset rotor printing machine arranged in series, respectively with a form cylinder 06;<br>
07; 08; 09, a transmission cylinder 11; 12; 13; 14 and a counter pressure 16; 17; 18; 19,<br>
whereby for producing print product printed on both sides each counter pressure cylinder<br>
16; 17; 18; 19 is preferably similarly designed as a transmission cylinder 16; 17; 18; 19,<br>
which again works together with a form cylinder allocated to it (not shown). A print<br>
carrier 21, e.g. a printed sheet 21 or a material web 21, preferably a paper web 21, is<br>
guided through during a production of the printing machine respectively between the<br>
transmission cylinder 11; 12; 13; 14 and the counter pressure cylinder 16; 17; 18; 19 and<br>
printed at least one printed image on it. It is insignificant for the invention whether the<br>
printing mechanisms 01; 02; 03; 04 are arranged in such a way that the print carrier 21 is<br>
guided horizontally or vertically through the printing machine.<br>
On the printing machine, preferably at the exit of the last printing mechanism 04 of the<br>
printing machine in transportation direction of the print carrier 21 an image sensor 22,<br>
e.g. a colour camera 22, preferably a digital semiconductor camera 22 with at least one<br>
CCD-chip, can be arranged with its image scanning region directly pointed on to the print<br>
carrier 21, whereby the image scanning region of the image sensor 22 captures the entire<br>
width of the print carrier 21, whereby the width of the print carrier 21 stretches transverse<br>
to its transportation direction through the printing machine. The image sensor 22 thus<br>
records an electronically usable image of the entire width of the printed paper web 21,<br>
whereby along the width of the paper web 21 at least one printed image is imposed on the<br>
print carrier 21. The image sensor 22 is designed for example as a flat camera 22.<br>
The image sensor 22 transmits the data correlated to the scanned image to a suitable<br>
evaluation unit 23, especially a programme-controlled electronic computing unit 23 that<br>
is arranged in a conducting stand belonging to the printing machine. Parameters relevant<br>
for the printing process can be controlled by analysing and evaluating the scanned image<br>
in the evaluation unit 23 and, if required, automatically corrected in a programme-<br>
controlled manner by programmes running in the evaluation unit 23. The evaluation and<br>
correction of all parameters of a printing process takes place practically simultaneously<br><br>
7<br>
with the help of the same evaluation unit 23. Particularly the image scanned by the<br>
image sensor 22 during a running production of a printing machine and passed on to the<br>
evaluation unit 23 in the form of data is evaluated to see whether the printed image<br>
scanned by the image and evaluated shows any change in tonality, especially an increase<br>
in tonality, with respect to the previously scanned and evaluated printed image, i.e. an<br>
actually scanned image is checked in the running printing process in comparison to a<br>
reference image. If the result of the text shows an alteration of tonality, i.e. generally a<br>
print-technically unavoidable increase in tonality, then the dosage and/or the feeding of<br>
ink in the printing machine is altered by a first setting command coming from the<br>
evaluation unit 23 and guided through a data line 24 to at least one of the printing<br>
mechanisms 01; 02; 03; 04, so that the tonality variation for a subsequent application of<br>
ink is minimum. After regulation of the ink density carried out by altering the dosage<br>
and/or the feed of printing ink, an image following the actually checked image conforms<br>
to a previously checked image of a printed image, i.e. to a reference image. Control and<br>
regulation of the tonality variation is important in order to maintain colour balance or<br>
grey balance in the printing process and to keep the colour impression of the produced<br>
print product as constant as possible - if required within permissible tolerance limits -,<br>
which constitute an important quality feature for print products.<br>
Similarly the data generated from the scanning of the printed image and transmitted to the<br>
evaluation unit 23 is taken for checking a registration consistency of the printed image<br>
impression on the print carrier 21, especially for checking and if required correcting a<br>
colour registration of a printed image printed in multiple colours. At least one motor-<br>
adjustable register is foreseen in the printing machine, e.g. a circumference register or a<br>
page register, if required even a diagonal adjustment for at least one of the form cylinders<br>
06; 07; 08; 09 with respect to the transmission cylinder 11; 12; 13; 14 allocated to it,<br>
whereby the register is regulated by at least one second setting command coming from<br>
the evaluation unit 23 and forwarded through a data line 26 to at least one of the printing<br>
mechanism 01; 02; 03; 04, so that a printed image following the evaluated image gives<br>
the highest possible registration precision. An adjustment or shifting of the register is<br>
thus calculated by the evaluation unit 23 from the image data provided by the image<br><br>
8<br>
sensor 22 to the evaluation unit 23. By adjusting or shifting the page register even cross-<br>
expansion caused by fan-out can be countered, whereby this cross-expansion occurs<br>
especially in printing machine that have a so-called eight-tower structure for its printing<br>
mechanism.<br>
The printing machine is designed shaft-less. In such a printing machine the form<br>
cylinders 06; 07; 08; 09 have individual drives that are mechanically de-coupled from the<br>
drive of the counter pressure cylinders 16; 17; 18; 19, so that the phase position or the<br>
angle position of the form cylinders 06; 07; 08; 09 can be altered with respect to the<br>
counter pressure cylinders 16; 17; 18; 19 by a corresponding control or regulation of the<br>
drive of the form cylinders 06; 07; 08; 09, whenever an evaluation of the image scanned<br>
from the print carrier 21 by the image sensor 22 considers this to be necessary. The<br>
entire image content and not only individually locally limited image elements of the print<br>
carrier 21, e.g. reference mark or similar things, thus influences the control or regulation<br>
of the printing mechanism, especially the drive of a form cylinder 06; 07; 08; 09.<br>
A setting command generated by the evaluation unit 23 from the image content of the<br>
image scanned from the printed image acts on a control unit or regulating unit of a<br>
provision-regulated electrical motor for rotary drive during printing of at least one of the<br>
form cylinders 06; 07; 08; 09, the transmission cylinders 11; 12; 13; 14 allocated to it or<br>
counter pressure cylinders 16; 17; 18; 19. Thus at least one of the printing mechanisms<br>
01; 02; 03; 04 of the printing machine the drive of the form cylinders 06; 07; 08; 09 or<br>
the transmission cylinders 11; 12; 13; 14 allocated to these form cylinders 06; 07; 08; 09<br>
can be controlled or regulated by an electrical signal independent of the drive of the form<br>
cylinder 06; 07; 08; 09 or the transmission cylinder 11; 12; 13; 14 allocated to this form<br>
cylinder 06; 07; 08; 09 in anther printing mechanism 01; 02; 03; 04 of the printing<br>
machine; especially the mutual angle position or phase position of the form cylinders 06;<br>
07; 08; 09 or their allocated transmission cylinders 11; 12; 13; 14 arranged in different<br>
printing mechanisms 01; 02; 03; 04 of the printing machine and involved in the printing<br>
of the print product, i.e. the printed image, can be adjusted to a registration suitable for<br>
production of a print product by the allied control unit or regulating unit, e.g. evaluation<br><br>
9<br>
unit 23. The electrical motor of a form cylinder 06; 07; 08; 09 is arranged co-axial to the<br>
axis of the form cylinder 06; 07; 08; 09, whereby the rotor of the motor is stiffly<br>
connected to its stud of the axis of the form cylinder 06; 07; 08; 09 in a manner as<br>
described for example in the document DE 43 22 744 Al. The counter pressure cylinder<br>
16; 17; 18; 19 arranged in a different printing mechanism 01; 02; 03; 04 of the printing<br>
machine can, as described in EP 0 812 683 A1, mechanically be connected to one another<br>
by a train of gears and for example have a common drive, whereby however the form<br>
cylinder 06; 07; 08; 09 or the allocated transmitted cylinder 11; 12; 13; 14 remain de-<br>
coupled with respect to their drive from the counter pressure cylinders 16; 17; 18; 19<br>
allocated to them. Between the form cylinder 06; 07; 08; 09 and the transmission<br>
cylinder 11; 12; 13; 14 allocated to it there can be a coupling by means of meshed gears,<br>
so that the form cylinder 06; 07; 08; 09 and the transmission cylinder 11; 12; 13; 14<br>
allocated to it can be driven by the same drive. The control unit or the regulation unit of<br>
the drive of at least the form cylinders 06; 07; 08; 09 is for example integrated in the<br>
evaluation unit 23.<br>
Control or regulation of the phase position or the angle position of the form cylinder 06;<br>
07; 08; 09 with respect to the counter pressure cylinders 16; 17; 18; 19 takes place with<br>
reference to a fixed reference setting, so that the form cylinder 06; 07; 08; 09 can have a<br>
leading or lagging rotation with respect to the counter pressure cylinder 16; 17; 18; 19<br>
allocated to it, whereby the relation of the rotation of the form cylinder 06; 07; 08; 09 and<br>
the counter pressure cylinder 16; 17; 18; 19 allocated to it is adjusted in relation to the<br>
image content of the image scanned by the image sensor 22 and also followed up by the<br>
control unit or the regulating unit of their drives. Also the phase position or the angle<br>
position of successive form cylinders 06; 07; 08; 09 in the printing process can be<br>
controlled or regulated in the same manner with reference to a fixed reference setting,<br>
which is particularly important in multi-coloured printing of a print product printed<br>
colour-wise in successively arranged printing mechanisms 01; 02; 03; 04 of the printing<br>
machine. If from the image scanned from the printed image having several colours it is<br>
seen that a correction is required for an ink printed in one of the printing mechanisms 01;<br><br>
10<br>
02; 03; 04, then the evaluating unit 23 passes on the setting command to counter the<br>
determined disturbing influence on to the concerned printing mechanism 01; 02; 03; 04.<br>
If the adjusting drives to be regulated by the evaluation unit 23 by adjusting commands,<br>
e.g. the adjusting drive for regulating the feeding of printing ink as well as the drive for<br>
regulating the circumference register or the page register are connected in the printing<br>
machine to a data network connected to the evaluation unit 23, then the data line 24; 26<br>
foreseen for transmitting the first and the second adjusting command is realised by the<br>
data network.<br>
Checking for tonality variation setting in the printing process and checking for<br>
registration consistency are carried out in the evaluation unit 23 simultaneously in data<br>
processing running in parallel branches simultaneously. Both the branches checks/tests<br>
are continuously conducted in the running process and that too at the end of the printing<br>
process and for each individual produced print sample.<br>
Checking for registration consistency initially referred to conformity in the position of a<br>
printed image or setting level between perfect printing and back printing or even between<br>
top side and bottom side in the production of both-sided print products. The check<br>
however also includes for example checking of the compass, i.e. checking the foreseen<br>
precision, individual path-colours in case of overprinting for multi-coloured printing.<br>
Registration precision and compass precision play a very important role in multi-coloured<br>
printing.<br>
A lighting device 27, e.g. a flash bulb 27, is allocated to the image sensor 22, whereby the<br>
short flash from the flash bulb 27 makes the fast running movement sequences in the<br>
printing process appear to be stand-still through a stroboscopic process and thus make<br>
them observable for the human eye. Especially in a sheet printing machine, scanning of<br>
the printed image executed by the image sensor 22 can also takes place in an extension 28<br>
of the printing machine, that is shown in fig. 1 by a dashed depiction of the image sensor<br>
22 and the allied lighting device 27 as a possible option for scanning the printed image<br><br>
11<br>
behind the last printing mechanism 04 of the concerned print page or is shown at the end<br>
of the printing machine. By capable choice of the image sensor 22 and if required the<br>
allied lighting device 23, scanning of the image can be extended or shifted to a visually<br>
not visible spectral range, e.g. the infrared or ultraviolet range. As an alternative to the<br>
preferred flat camera 22 with a flash bulb 27, it is also possible to use a cell camera with<br>
a permanent lighting.<br>
As each print sample is subjected to a test, in the running printing process a trend for<br>
tonality alteration or registration consistency of successively produced print samples can<br>
be identified. The print samples can be classified according to the value determined in<br>
the running printing process with respect to its tonality and/or its registration into groups<br>
of different quality stages and then marked as rejected sample if they cross a permissible<br>
tolerance limit. Rejected samples can be ejected in a controlled manner by the evaluation<br>
unit 23 and in the case of a sheet printing machine can be deposited in the extension 28 at<br>
least on a separate stack 29. For this purpose, from the evaluation unit 23 evaluating the<br>
image there is at least a third adjustment command guided through a data line 31, e.g. a<br>
wastage signal to at least one adjusting drive acting on at least one unit for transportation<br>
of the print carrier 21 for sorting the sample flow.<br>
For synchronizing the frequency with which detection of the images of the print carrier<br>
21 takes place, with the transportation speed of the print carrier 21, i.e. the speed for<br>
example of the paper web 21, at least one of the print mechanisms 01; 02; 03; 04,<br>
preferably in the printing mechanism 01; 02; 03; 04 in which detection of the images by<br>
the image sensor 22 takes place, a rotation generator 32 is installed, whereby the running<br>
rotation generator 32 is at a fixed ratio to a rotation speed of the transmission cylinder 11;<br>
12; 13; 14 on which the image sensor 22 scans the images. The rotation generator 32<br>
gives its output signal to the evaluation unit 23 and/or also to the image sensor 22. The<br>
output signal of the rotation generator 32 is, among other things, used as releaser for the<br>
flash bulb 27.<br><br>
12<br>
The image scanned by the image sensor 22 and forwarded to the evaluation unit 23 in the<br>
form of a data set is displayed on a monitor of an input and output unit 33 connected to<br>
the evaluation unit 23 and having bi-directional data exchange. The input and output unit<br>
33 similarly offers correction possibility for at least one of the mentioned regulations, in<br>
that it allows manual input and/or release of at least one adjusting command.<br>
The evaluation unit 23 has a memory 34 for storing scanned image sequences as well as<br>
storing data that are useful for protocol and thus for documenting the quality of the print<br>
product as well as for statistical analysis of the printing process. It would be<br>
advantageous if the evaluation unit 23 can make the data evaluated and/or stored image to<br>
a company network through a corresponding connection 36.<br>
For comparison of data carried out by the evaluation unit 23, which correlate the actually<br>
scanned image during a running production of a printing machine, with data of a<br>
previously generated image, it can be foreseen that the data of the previously generated<br>
image correlate with the image generated in a previous printing sequence of the printing<br>
machine, whereby a data processing unit of the printing pre-stage (not shown) is<br>
connected to the evaluation unit 23 and the data of the previously generated image is<br>
forwarded to the evaluation unit 23. In this way, data of the previously generated image<br>
are correlated alternatively or additionally to a data of the image scanned by the image<br>
sensor 22 and placed at the disposal of the evaluation unit 23 for evaluation. The data<br>
correlated to the printed image from the previous printing stage form low profile<br>
reference data for controlling and regulating the colour resistance with respect to data<br>
obtained from previously printed images in the running production.<br>
In the printing machine shown, a registration regulation and colour regulation is possible<br>
on the basis of analysis of the same image scanned in the printed image by the image<br>
sensor 23, in that the image of the printed image is evaluated with respect to various<br>
parameters relevant for the printing process in a single evaluation unit 23, as well as<br>
simultaneous inspection of the printed image for processing the quality of the print<br>
product.<br><br>
13<br>
The registration regulation is based on a registration measurement in the printed image.<br>
After all the colours required in the printed image have printed, the entire printed image<br>
is scanned by the camera at the end of the printing machine. In the evaluation unit 23 the<br>
scanned printed image is split up into the usual colour separations CMYK as used in<br>
printing technology, as well as an analysis of a suitable printed image segment and a<br>
relative position determination of a colour separation with respect to a colour separation<br>
by means of correlation method, with a previously scanned or obtained reference image.<br>
The reference image or reference value for image segment or a printed image mark<br>
(desired density) is drawn either from the previous printing step, which has the advantage<br>
that the reference image is available already in the individual colour segment, or a<br>
reference image, e.g. a reference sheet having the printed image, is taken for evaluation<br>
from an impression of the printed image, whereby this reference image has to<br>
additionally be split into the colour separations. This reference sheet is identified after<br>
the printed image is manually set in such a way, that all printed colours are positioned<br>
correctly with respect to one another and hence a proper colour registration is set. This<br>
thus obtained reference printed image is to be stored for later repetition jobs, so that for a<br>
repetition job one can fall back on this earlier scanned reference image. By accessing the<br>
stored reference printed image, the colour registration can be automatically adjusted by<br>
the evaluation unit 23 without manual intervention, which in case of a repetition job leads<br>
to further reduction in wastage.<br>
From the reference printed image, characteristics and suitable segments are selected, on<br>
the basis of which the positions of individual colour segments are determined as<br>
reference colour segments. This is the so-called desired position for later registration<br>
comparison. This reference image inclusive of colour segments and the desired position<br>
is stored for example in the storage 34. Selection of the suitable printed image segment<br>
can be done manually by the operator or automatically by the evaluation unit 23, e.g. for<br>
a pre-setting of the desired position. Suitable printed image segments with respect to<br>
registration measurements are regions, in which the printed ink to be measured dominates<br>
or appears exclusively.<br><br>
14<br>
In the continuous printing process, each printed image is scanned with the help of the<br>
camera system and split into the colour segments CMYK. Within the already fixed<br>
suitable printed image segment, the position of individual colour segment is now<br>
determined. This takes place by comparison with the colour segment from the reference<br>
printing image by means of a correlation method, particularly a cross-correlation method.<br>
With the help of the correlation method, the position of the colour segment can be<br>
determined up to approx. 0.1 pixel of the camera resolution. If for each printed sheet a<br>
stationary registration stage is determined repeatedly, then a higher precision of the<br>
measured value is ensured by suppressing stochastic dispersion.<br>
Determination of the position of the individual colour segments takes place in web run<br>
direction corresponding to the longitudinal registration and in cross direction to the web<br>
run direction corresponding to the page registration. The thus obtained position<br>
differences are converted by the evaluation unit 23 to setting command and sent as<br>
correction signal to the adjusting system, i.e. to the drives.<br>
In offset printing, special colours are not mixed with the standard colours, i.e. the scale<br>
colours CMYK, but are printed separately. Special colours are therefore not measured<br>
separately. Such the region in which the special colours are printed should be fixed. For<br>
each of the special colours, own suitable regions are fixed in which the position of the<br>
colour segment is determined in the same way as for the scale colours CMYK, i.e. the<br>
standard colours. The further procedure for registration regulation for special colour is<br>
identical to the procedure described already for standard colours.<br>
An advantageous design is described below, in which on the basis of the scanned data for<br>
colour density and/or spectral analysis, the regulation of the ink feeding is taken up by<br>
means of a temperature as guiding parameter that can be set on the jacket surface of the<br>
rotation body involved in the printing process. Determination of the data can thereby<br>
takes place through the entire web width or printing width, merely through one or more<br>
printed image segments or through special marks on the printing substance. The ink<br>
density corresponds to a layer thickness of the ink applied on the printing substance and<br><br>
15<br>
can be determined densito-metrically, and that too inline, i.e. in the running printing<br>
process, as well as offline, i.e. by means of a measurement on rejected print samples from<br>
the running printing process.<br>
As shown in fig. 2, an adjusting device 37 is foreseen, which is fed with a signal with<br>
data from the evaluation unit 23. For example, depending on the determined variation of<br>
an actually scanned ink density Dl from a pre-given desired value of the ink density D2<br>
by the adjusting device 37, a variation of the temperature set on the jacket surface and<br>
determined by the adjusting device 37 with the help of one tempering unit 57; 58 of at<br>
least one of the rotation bodies 43; 47; 53; 54, e.g. cylinder 43; 47 or rollers 53; 54,<br>
involved in the printing process and transporting the ink, is taken up. With a view to<br>
quick, systematic and hence reproduce-able variation, in the storage 34 arranged in the<br>
adjusting device 37 or in the evaluation unit 23 a functional relation between a variation<br>
in ink density Dl and D2 and the temperature to be adjusted can be pre-retained, whereby<br>
this functional relation is graphically or electronically fixed in at least a graph, table or in<br>
any other suitable form representing the correlation.<br>
The adjusting unit 37 shown in Fig. 2 along with the arrows here represent the effective<br>
path of the control or regulation unit. Here no distinction has been made between signal<br>
paths and supply paths. The adjusting unit 37 can have a control or regulating unit 72,<br>
e.g. a control electronic mechanism 72, and/or a supply unit 71 (not shown here) for<br>
dosing and feeding tempering agent (for this see Figs. 8-11). The control electronic<br>
mechanism 72 then works for example according to pre-given data determined by means<br>
of a stored logic unit on setting members (e.g. valves) of the supply unit 71.<br>
The printing machine shown as example in fig. 2 is particularly designed as a rotor<br>
printing machine and has a printing mechanism 41 that has at least a inking device 42, a<br>
cylinder 43, e.g. a printing mechanism cylinder 43 designed as form cylinder 43,<br>
carrying a print form 44, as well as a counter pressure cylinder 46. The solution for<br>
printing machines described below for operational modes for a web velocity of more than<br>
10 m/sec, especially greater than or equal to 12 m/sec. is particularly advantageous. The<br><br>
16<br>
print form 44 is preferably designed as print form 44 for flat printing (flat print form 44),<br>
particularly for waterless flat printing (waterless flat print form 44). The printing<br>
mechanism 41 is designed as printing mechanism 41 for offset printing and has between<br>
the form cylinder 43 and the counter pressure cylinder 46, another cylinder 47, e.g. a<br>
printing mechanism cylinder 47 designed as transmission cylinder 47 with a packing on<br>
its jacket surface. The transmission cylinder 47 forms along with the counter pressure<br>
cylinder 46 in a print-on-position over a printing substance 49, e.g. a printing substance<br>
web 49, a printing position 51. The counter pressure cylinder 46 can be another<br>
transmission cylinder 46 of another not denoted printing mechanism, or can also be a<br>
counter pressure cylinder 46 not carrying any ink, e.g. a steel cylinder or a satellite<br>
cylinder.<br>
The print form 44 can be designed as sleeve-shaped or even as one (or more) print plates<br>
44, that is fastened or suspended with its end in at least one narrow channel not exceeding<br>
a width in circumference direction of 3 mm (indicated in fig. 2). Similarly, the packing<br>
48 on the transmission cylinder 47 can be designed sleeve-shaped or even as (at least<br>
one) rubber blanket 48 that is similarly fastened and/or clamped in at least one channel.<br>
If the rubber blanket 48 is designed as multilayered metal print blanket, then the channel<br>
is also designed with the above mentioned maximum width.<br>
The inking mechanism 42 has an ink supply unit 52, e.g. an ink tub with a dip roller or a<br>
lifter, or a chamber wiper with ink feed, as well as at least a roller 53 that can be set<br>
against the form cylinder 43 in a print-on-position, e.g. an inking roller 53. In the shown<br>
example, the printing ink is transported by the ink supplying unit 52 over a roller 54<br>
designed as screen roller 54, the roller 53, the form cylinder 43 and the transmission<br>
cylinder 47 on to the printing substance 49 (e.g. in web form or as sheet). There can also<br>
be at least one more, e.g. a second inking roller 53 depicted by dashed line, working<br>
together with the screen roller 54 and the form cylinder 43. The roller 54, i.e. here the<br>
screen roller 54, has recesses or cups on its jacket surface in order to take ink from a<br>
reservoir 61 for the printing ink, e.g. from an ink cartridge 61 containing printing ink, and<br>
transported on to an adjacent rotation body 53, e.g. the inking roller 53.<br><br>
17<br>
The printing mechanism 41 is designed as so-called "printing mechanism for waterless<br>
flat printing", particularly "waterless offset print" (dry offset), i.e. in addition to feeding<br>
of printing ink no further feeding of a damping agent for forming "non-printing" regions<br>
is required. In this method one can do away with application of a moist film on the print<br>
form 44, which otherwise in the so-called "wet offset" prevents the non-printing part on<br>
the print form 44 from taking up ink. In waterless offset printing this is achieved by<br>
using special printing ink and through special design of the surface of the print form 44.<br>
Thus for example, a silicon layer in the waterless offset printing can take over the role of<br>
the hydrophilic region of the wet offset to be coated with the damping agent and prevent<br>
the print form 44 from taking up any ink.<br>
Generally, the non-print areas and the print areas of the print form 44 are achieved by<br>
designing regions with different surface tension with alternate working of the printing<br>
ink.<br>
In order to print tone-free, i.e. without the non-print areas also taking up ink, one required<br>
a printing ink that is set in its easy flow (measured as tack value), that on the basis of the<br>
surface difference between printing and non-printing part on the print form 44, a smooth<br>
separation can take place. As the non-printing points are preferably designed as silicon<br>
layer, for this purpose a printing ink having the higher easy flow as compared to the wet<br>
offset is required.<br>
The easy flow according to the "roller offset print", Walenski 1995, raises a resistance,<br>
with which the printing ink of the film division in a roller crevice or while transmitting<br>
the ink in the print zone between cylinder and printing substance, counter-act.<br>
As the easy flow of the printing ink varies with temperature, in practical operation of the<br>
printing machine, the cylinders 43; 47 or the inking device 42 are tempered, especially<br>
cooled, and held at a constant temperature in order to avoid tinting for the changing<br>
operation conditions during printing.<br><br>
18<br>
The temperature dependence of rheological properties, e.g. the viscosity and/or the easy<br>
flow, is now brought into consideration for influencing and particularly regulating the<br>
printing ink to be transported from the reservoir to the printing substance 49. Instead of<br>
(or in addition) mechanical setting members, e.g. opening or shutting of wipers or<br>
alteration in speed of lifters or film rollers, by altering the temperature on the jacket<br>
surface of at least one of the rotation bodies 43; 47; 53; 54 involved in the printing<br>
process, the result of the comparison of the desired ink density D2 with the determined<br>
actual ink density Dl can be influenced.<br>
Apart from separating printing and non-printing regions, the easy flow of the printing ink<br>
however also influences the intensity of cracking during co-acting of an ink-carrying<br>
cylinder 43; 47 and the printing substance 49. Especially when the printing substance 49<br>
is designed as uncoated and less dense newspaper material with very good soaking<br>
properties, i.e. with open pores and very little repelling time, there is increased danger of<br>
release of fibre or dust caused by cracking. The danger however is also there for lightly<br>
coated or light-weight coated paper types used in roller offset printing with a coating<br>
weight of say 5-20 gm/m2, especially 5-10 gm/m2 or even lesser. Tempering is overall<br>
suited for uncoated or coated papers with a coating weight of lesser than 20 gm/m2. For<br>
coated papers, tempering of the ink-carrying cylinder 43; 47 is advantageous when it is<br>
determined that the coating is "offset" by increasing of easy flow of the paper (at least<br>
partly).<br>
In order to keep cracking on the printed substance 49 or build-up of the printing ink on<br>
the packing 48 of the transmission cylinder 47 and/or the print form 44 of the form<br>
cylinder 43 as low as possible, the printing ink for the application purpose and the<br>
expected operating conditions is produced and used in such a way that it is at the lower<br>
limit of the easy flow as far as possible.<br>
In an extension, one or more of the ink-carrying components, like e.g. in an advantageous<br>
design of the printing mechanism cylinder 43 designed as form cylinder 43 as ink-<br>
carrying component 43, or/and the printing ink itself, can simultaneously be tempered in<br><br>
19<br>
relation to the production speed V of the printing machine, for which a correlating signal<br>
with the production speed V of the printing machine is tapped on the ink-carrying<br>
transmission cylinder 47 with the help of a sensor, e.g. with a rotation generator (not<br>
shown) and set to the adjusting device 37 (shown dashed in fig. 2) and/or to the<br>
evaluation unit 23. The temperature on the jacket surface of at least one of the rotation<br>
bodies 43; 47; 53; 54 involved in the printing process, preferably in the form cylinder 43,<br>
is not kept constant here, as is otherwise usual in waterless offset printing, for all<br>
production speeds V in a certain temperature range, but reveals for different production<br>
speeds V different rated temperature T i;rated. The rated temperature T i,rated is adjusted<br>
with the help of the adjusting device 37 in relation to the production speed V in such a<br>
way, that the easy flow of the printing ink for any desired production speed V lies within<br>
a pre-given window of tolerable tack values. For a higher production speed V, an<br>
increased value is selected for the rated temperature T i,rated of the corresponding<br>
component 43 or the printing ink.<br>
One regulation is based on the principle that for the desired, directly next or the actually<br>
adjusted production speed V as guiding parameter on account of a systematic allocation<br>
of a certain rated value or maximum value for the rated temperature T i,rated of the<br>
component 43 or the printing ink as initial parameter is foreseen. The rated value or<br>
maximum value in both cases represents a default temperature that corresponds in the<br>
first case to a temperature to be maintained, and in the second case to an upper limit of a<br>
permissible temperature. On the basis of an inline conducted scanning of the ink density<br>
Dl actually applied on the print substance 49 by the printing process, with a photo-<br>
electric sensor 56, preferably an image sensor 56, especially a CCD-cameral 56, and<br>
comparison of the different scanned values with the rated value foreseen in this printing<br>
ink density D2, the temperature is however varied and fine-tuned till an adequate<br>
conformity between the actual ink density Dl and the desired ink density D2 is achieved.<br>
If there are other conditions, e.g. a printing ink with mainly other properties, especially<br>
with respect to its consistency, or a printing substance 49 that has a surface structure<br>
different from that of uncoated new paper material and/or has a completely different<br><br>
20<br>
cracking behaviour, then the valued of the relationship between the mentioned values can<br>
vary significantly. Common is however the solution nevertheless of adjusting the<br>
temperature of the form cylinder 43 in relationship of production speed V, and in such a<br>
way that in the range of higher production speed V it has a higher rated value or<br>
maximum value and for a region of a lower production speed V. In this way cracking<br>
between the ink-carrying cylinder 43; 47 and the printing substance 49 is reduced and in<br>
the ideal case almost prevented.<br>
The above mentioned relationship between a determined ink density variations and a<br>
temperature alteration and/or between temperature on the jacket surface at least one of<br>
the rotation body 43; 47; 53; 54 involved in the printing process and the production speed<br>
V	of the printing machine, can be stored for different printing ink and/or printing<br>
substance type. Even the printing operation then the specific relationship for the<br>
respective printing ink and/or the concerned printing substance 49 is used. For this, see<br>
also the descriptive part of the design example shown figs. 6 and 7.<br>
In an advantageous design at least the screen roller 54 and the formed cylinder 43 has a<br>
tempering device 57; 58 acted upon by a fluid tempering agent, e.g. water, acting from its<br>
interior to its respective jacket surface, whereby the temperature on the jacket surface of<br>
the screen roller 54 with respect to the ink quantity to be transmitted from it and the<br>
temperature on the jacket surface of the formed cylinder 43 under consideration of the<br>
production speed V of the printing machine for avoiding crack and/or toning is adjusted,<br>
preferably controlled or regulated. The adjusting device 37 is designed according to the<br>
case in question, whether the process is controlled or regulated, as a control unit 37 or as<br>
a regulating unit 37. In the case of design as a control unit 37 there is no feedback<br>
through photo-electric sensor 56 or the signal of data supplied by it.<br>
For controlling the temperature of the jacket surface of the screen roller 54, in the fore-<br>
field of production for the interested pairs printing ink/paper of various production speed<br>
V	that temperature (empirical) is determined, at which the desired ink density can be<br>
determined on the product. During regulation of the temperature on the jacket surface of<br><br>
21<br>
the screen roller 54 the actually adjusted temperature can be determined with the help of<br>
at least one of the thermo-sensor 59 arranged on or at least near to the jacket surface to<br>
the screen roller 54, whose output signal is fed to the adjusting device 37 or the<br>
evaluating unit 23 and then adjusted afresh if required in relationship to a comparison<br>
with temperature with rated temperature conducted in the adjusting unit 37 or the<br>
evaluation unit 23 and continued with it in order to convey the ink quantity required for<br>
the printed image.<br>
Parallel to the control/ regulation of the temperature on the jacket surface of the screen<br>
roller 54 the temperature of the jacket surface of the form cylinder 43 is controlled or<br>
regulated in relationship of the production speed V (sometimes additionally dependence<br>
on the printing substance and/or the printing ink), whereby regulation of the temperature<br>
on the jacket surface of the form cylinder 43 under application of a further (not shown)<br>
thermo-feeler is similar to that of regulation of the temperature on the jacket surface of<br>
the screen roller 54. This is however not additionally varied through the result of the<br>
output unit 23, but it correlates with the production speed V of the printing machine.<br>
It is of advantage that a temperature to be adjusted for a value of the production speed V<br>
of the printing machine on the jacket surface of the roller, especially the screen roller 54<br>
and/or the cylinder, particularly the form cylinder 43, is adjusted or at least<br>
adjustment/setting of this required temperature is started before the printing machine sets<br>
the new value of the production speed V, so that the temperature adjustment with respect<br>
to a desired alteration in the production speed V takes place in an advanced manner. By<br>
means of this pre-control an otherwise systematically occurring error can be avoided, as<br>
due to a time-advanced adaptation of the temperature adjustment the quantity of produced<br>
wastage as a result of unsuitable temperature adjustment can be significantly reduced.<br>
Because the adaptation of the temperature adjustment reacts at least more slowly, i.e.<br>
with a longer reaction time till reaching a stable operating condition, than the alteration in<br>
production speed V that is carried out with the help of electronically controlled or<br>
regulated drives. In this way a desired alteration is production speed V that is for example<br>
displayed through a corresponding manual input on the input and output unit 33<br><br>
22<br>
belonging to the evaluation unit 23, e.g. can be programme-technically delayed by the<br>
evaluation unit 23 in its execution till the tempering unit 57; 58 has reached the<br>
temperature required for the new production speed V and to be set o the jacket surface of<br>
the screen roller 54 and/or the form cylinder 43 completely or at least to a significant<br>
extent of clearly about 50%, preferably above 80%, ideally above 90%.<br>
The above described measures are suitable with respect to the screen roller 54 alone or<br>
for the printing machine as a whole and also foreseen for the reason that the temperature<br>
to be set on the jacket roller of the screen roller 54 can be adjusted in relation to the<br>
production speed V of the printing machine in such a way, that with increasing<br>
production speed V of the printing machine a reducing capacity of the recesses designed<br>
on the jacket surface of the screen roller 54 for transmission of ink on to the rotation body<br>
53 adjacent to the screen roller 54 is compensated by a reduction in viscosity of the ink<br>
caused by the set temperature. Because, with increasing production speed V of the<br>
printing machine the recesses or cups on the jacket surface of the screen roller 54 filled<br>
with printing ink get increasingly incompletely emptied, so that the worsening<br>
transmission behaviour of the screen roller 54 can be compensated by an adapted<br>
thinning of the printing ink to be transmitted, whereby the reduction in viscosity of the<br>
printing ink takes place with the help of the temperature to be set on the jacket surface of<br>
the screen roller 54.<br>
In another advantageous design the tempering unit 57; 58 is designed in such a way that<br>
the temperature set with the adjusting device 37 allocated to this tempering unit 57; 58,<br>
on account of a pre-given functional allocation for a value of the production speed V of<br>
the printing machine on the jacket surface of the roller 54, and/or the cylinder 43,<br>
particularly the form cylinder 43 can be altered within fixed limits by manual adjustment.<br>
In this way one has an intervention possibility into pre-machine-given settings, whereby<br>
within a maximum permissible tolerance range defined by bound values of e.g. +/- 5% or<br>
10% with respect to the default value can be manually fine-tuned as required. The bound<br>
values can be symmetrically or unsymmetrical distanced from the default value and for<br>
example define even a tolerance range between -5% and +10%.<br><br>
23<br>
Fig 3 shows an example of a functional relation, (e.g. equation B in Fig. 6) as to how the<br>
rated temperature T i,rated on the jacket surface of at least one of the rotation bodies 43; 47;<br>
53; 54 involved in the printing process can be dependent on the production speed V of the<br>
printing machine. The functional relation can be linear or non-linear. In any case, on the<br>
basis of the functional relation for a printing process fixed on account of the used printing<br>
ink and the used print substance 49 in relation to production speed V of the printing<br>
machine, a suitable value for the rated temperature T i,rated to be set on the jacket surface<br>
of at least one of the rotation bodies 43; 47; 53; 54 involved in the printing process can be<br>
determined. The mechanically determined value for the rated temperature T i;rated to be set<br>
on the jacket surface of at least one of the rotation bodies 43; 47; 53; 54 involved in the<br>
printing process can be manually altered within pre-given limits in the sense of a fine<br>
tuning, which is indicated in Fig. 3 by a vertical double arrow enclosed by boundary<br>
lines.<br>
Fig. 4 similarly shows as an example a functional relation of an ink quantity conveyed by<br>
the screen roller 54 in relationship to the production speed V of the printing machine. By<br>
adapting the temperature T on the jacket surface of the screen roller 54, especially the<br>
viscosity of the printing ink to be conveyed can be altered in such a way that the<br>
conveying rate on altering the production speed V of the printing machine remains at<br>
least almost constant. This can be done by means of a pre-retained equation (e.g.<br>
Equation A in Fig. 6) between production speed V and a rated temperature T i;rated.<br>
Especially the conveying rate of the screen roller 54 can however be made alternatively<br>
or in addition to its dependence on the production speed V of the printing machine be<br>
made dependent on a determined variation in the actually determined ink density Dl and<br>
on the ink density D2 pre-given as rated value.<br>
The index "i" or "j" in the rated temperature T i,rated or T i,rated is supposed to indicate that<br>
this could have to do with several stored relationships A; B for different components 43;<br>
54 and/or ink types F and/or paper sorts. Thus in the storage unit 34 of the adjusting unit<br>
37 respectively a quantity of different relations A; B at least for the respective rated<br>
temperature T i,rated; T j,rated of the screen roller 54 and the form cylinder 43 are stored, to<br><br>
24<br>
which one can have access through the input and output unit 33 of say the adjusting unit<br>
37.<br>
Fig. 6 and 7 show in a display mask and/or input mask a design example for a tempering,<br>
where the prescribed rated temperature T i,rated; T j,rated of the component 43; 54 to be<br>
tempered - here the screen roller 54 and the form cylinder 43 - is given in the<br>
relationship A for the form cylinder 43 and B for the screen roller 54 to the production<br>
speed V. For this, in a storage unit 34, e.g. in a data bank of the control post computer, of<br>
the adjusting unit 37 or the evaluation unit 23, for different printing inks or ink types<br>
colour-specific curves/graphs (analytical) or support points (tabular) are stored for the<br>
relationship between rated temperature T i,rated; T j,rated of the concern component 43; 54<br>
and the production speed V. As one can see in fig.6 there are own relationships A; B<br>
(curves or tables) for tempering of screen roller 54 and form cylinder 43. The curves<br>
shown in fig.6 are based on pre-retained support points particularly in a data bank of the<br>
storage unit 34 for a particular selected ink type F (here for example "HUBER<br>
MAGENTA"). Selection of the ink type F and hence the relationship can take place for<br>
the screen roller 54 and/or the form cylinder 43 from a list, e.g. through a mask or a menu<br>
corresponding to fig.7. While selecting a printing ink or ink type F the stored<br>
relationship A; B (a curve and/or the stored support points) is loaded and drawn as basis<br>
for adjusting the tempering of this component 43; 54. The curves or support points can<br>
be stored in the storage unit 34 in an alterable and subsequently altered manner by the<br>
operating personnel for carrying out an adaptation.<br>
On the basis of this pre-retained relationship A; B or connections a required target<br>
temperature or rated temperature T i,rated; T j,rated of the component 43; 54 to be tempered<br>
is defined for the existing production speed V, given out as prescribed value for the rated<br>
temperature T i,rated; T j,rated and converted for example through a supply unit 71 with<br>
control electronic mechanism 72 as described in details below.<br>
Advantageous is a design, according to which a pre-retained relationship A; B (as curve<br>
and/or as series of support points) can be corrected upwards or downwards by the<br><br>
25<br>
operating personnel altogether absolutely or relatively. This is expressed in fig.6<br>
(respectively for the form cylinder 43 and the screen roller 54) by the input field "Temp.-<br>
Offset [%]" and the input field "curve alteration". In this way the relationship A; B for<br>
the selected ink type F can basically be retained; an adaptation to particular ink density<br>
requirements and/or an adaptation to the requirements of different print substances can<br>
however be taken up manually through an input on the display mask and/or input mask<br>
(fig. 6 and 7) displayed on the monitor of the input and output unit 33. In the variant<br>
"Temp.-Offset [%]" however, the stored and displayed relationship itself is not changed<br>
but nearly the desired value obtained for the subsequent regulating cycle is subjected to<br>
the alteration. Thus the pre-retained relationship A; B or curve is basically retained; the<br>
alteration has an effect merely on the selected printing mechanism. In the second variant<br>
"curve alteration" the relationship (curve or series of support points can actually be<br>
altered. It can be foreseen that this takes place by adding a constant (total raising or<br>
lowering) and/or in a percentage manner (spreading or crushing).<br>
In this example, for the form cylinder 43 the target or rated temperatures T i,rated for<br>
production speeds V of 5000 cylinder rotations per hour lie preferably between 20 and<br>
24°C and for 35000 cylinder rotations per hour between 24 and 28°C. For the<br>
screen roller 54 the target or rated temperatures T i,rated for production speeds V of<br>
5000 cylinder rotations per hour lie between 22 and 27°C and for 35000 cylinder<br>
rotations per hour between 31 and 36°C.<br>
From fig. 5 we can see that several cycles for tempering separated from one<br>
another can be foreseen in the printing machine, namely particularly a supply<br>
cycle K2, e.g. cycle K2 for at least one of the printing mechanism cylinders 43; 47<br>
and/or the screen roller 54, as well as another supply cycle K3, e.g. cycle K3 for<br>
the drives M of the printing mechanism cylinders 43; 47 and/or the screen roller<br>
54 and/or if required for the regulator allocated to these drives M as components<br>
M to be tempered.<br><br>
26<br>
The tempering agent consisting mainly of water (with or without additives) for<br>
tempering the printing mechanism cylinders 43; 47 and/or the screen roller 54 is<br>
made available through a cooling unit 77, e.g. a cold central unit 77, in a<br>
temperature range between 10°C and 25°C, whereas the tempering agent for<br>
tempering the drives M of the printing mechanism cylinders 43; 47 and/or the<br>
screen roller 54 is readied in a temperature range between 24°C and 30°C. As<br>
described in more details below, this whole central unit 77 can have an air-cooled<br>
condenser and/or a free cooling unit and/or a booster cooling for a peak capacity at<br>
higher surrounding temperatures, e.g. in summer, and/or a heat exchanger for heat<br>
recovery and/or a compressor-cold machine. As explained below it should<br>
preferably have at least two of these cooling units 77.<br>
Through heat recovery, e.g. a unit/device for heat recovery 66 as described for<br>
example in fig. 12 and 13, 5 - 10% of the cooling capacity of the cooling<br>
processes 87 (see below) can be recovered. This recovered energy can be drawn<br>
for an internal utilisation 64, like for example a building tempering, hot water<br>
preparation, a building air moistening or for fresh air pre-heating and/or even as<br>
(part) energy source for a hot water storage 76 (see fig. 5 and 8). As schematically<br>
shown in fig. 5 the heat recovery 66 can be from different sources, e.g. indicated<br>
by the heat flow 68 and 69 from the reflux of the supply cycle K3 and/or K2<br>
and/or even as indicated by the heat flow 63 from the surrounding air heated in the<br>
region of the printing units or from the heated product flow. Especially tempering<br>
of the 43; 54 through tempering agents and heat recovery leads to the fact that the<br>
printing machine releases heat only to relatively less extent to the surrounding air<br>
and/or to a sample flow of print products produced by it, so that the energy fed by<br>
energy sources 67 into the printing machine, particularly electrical energy of say<br>
several KVA is utilised with a high degree of effectiveness.<br><br>
27<br>
The hot water storage 76 has for example a holding capacity of approx. 1 m3 for<br>
each printing tower 73 (see below) and feeds to the tempering unit 57; 58 of the<br>
printing mechanism cylinders 43; 47 and/or the screen roller 54 the stored<br>
tempering agent at a temperature Tl of say between 50°C and 70°C for a<br>
relatively short time period of say 3 to 4 minutes during run-up of the printing<br>
machine, in order to set the temperature on the jacket surface of the printing<br>
mechanism cylinders 43; 47 and/or the screen roller 54 to at least 50°C, e.g. 55°C,<br>
at least for the period of run-up of the printing machine. Due to the increased<br>
temperature Tl of the tempering agent from the hot water storage 76 the printing<br>
machine is brought to its working temperature within a short time, which has a<br>
favourable effect on the quality of print products produced during start-up of the<br>
printing machine. Ejection of start-up wastage is thereby reduced.<br>
The following designs for control of tempering and supply with tempering agent<br>
are particularly advantageous in conjunction with one or more of the already<br>
mentioned design features, e.g. with the regulating cycle for ink density in<br>
connection with the evaluation unit 23 and/or with tempering of the screen roller<br>
54 in relation to the speed and/or with tempering of the form cylinder 43 in<br>
relation to the speed. For details on this refer to explanations above.<br>
Supply of tempering agent to the components 43; 54 takes place as shown in fig. 8<br>
through decentralised supply units 71, which along with a control electronic<br>
mechanism 72 (on location) form for example a decentralised adjusting unit 37 for<br>
one or more printing mechanisms 41. The adjusting unit 37 or the supply unit 71<br>
is preferably allocated to a group of printing mechanisms 41, which together form<br>
at least one printing unit 73. For example, the printing unit 73 represents the<br>
group of all printing mechanisms 41 allocated to a web to be printed on and/or it<br>
forms a printing tower 73. Fig. 8 shows on the right side a first section with a<br>
printing tower 73 and a folding apparatus 74 and on the left side a second section<br><br>
28<br>
with two printing towers 73 and an allocated folding apparatus 74. The supply<br>
unit 71 can be allocated to one or more adjacent printing towers 73 of a section. In<br>
this supply unit 71 there are supply lines and regulating valves (described further<br>
below) for the desired supply of required tempering agent at a suitable temperature<br>
to the components 43; 54 to be tempered.<br>
The supply unit 71 or the allocated control electronic mechanism 72 receives from<br>
a super-ordinate control unit 75, e.g. a logic system implemented in the machine<br>
control or a control room computer, either directly the above mentioned desired or<br>
rated temperatures T i,rated after these have been determined as described above on the<br>
basis of stored equations A; B, or the control electronic mechanism 72 receives at least<br>
data regarding ink type F and/or production speed V, which enables a logic system<br>
implemented in the control electronic mechanism to determine the desired or rated<br>
temperature Ti,rated on the basis of equations A; B stored there.<br>
The supply units 71 arranged decentralised in the printing machine plant close to the<br>
printing tower are now connected to a first supply cycle Kl, which supplies tempering<br>
agent at a first temperature range Tl above the surrounding temperature to the supply<br>
units 71 purely for heating purposes. This tempering agent can either be heated as<br>
required, as for example in a run-through heater. Ideally however, a suitably tempered<br>
stock is already retained in a storage 76, e.g. a tempering agent storage 76 or a heating<br>
fluid storage 76, particularly a hot water storage 76. Energy supply to these or the<br>
heating is not discussed here in details. This can takes place with usual heating<br>
appliances, with or without released heat utilisation, on the printing machine. In an<br>
advantageous design with released heat utilisation at least a portion of the heating energy<br>
can be used for the storage 76, e.g. through heat recovery 66, especially heat recovery 66<br>
according to or similar to fig. 13 with heating pump 121. A pump 70 (see fig. 11)<br>
transporting the tempering agent in the cycle K3 can ideally be foreseen in a line branch<br>
of cycle K3 or even in the region of the hot water storage 76.<br><br>
29<br>
The supply unit 71 is further connected at least to a second cycle K2 which supplies<br>
tempering agent at a second temperature range T2 to the supply unit 71 for tempering<br>
purposes, which depending on the actual requirement could basically be in a range of say<br>
between 5°C and 30°C, preferably 8 to 25°C, ideally 10 to 15°C. Depending on the<br>
requirement of the desired component temperature, more or less of the tempering<br>
agent from this supply cycle K2 is mixed with a tempering cycle KFZ; KRW (see<br>
below) tempering the component 43; 54. For readying the tempering agent a<br>
cooling unit 77, e.g. a cold central unit 77, has at least a corresponding cooling<br>
process (also tempering agent source), preferably however two different cooling<br>
processes (tempering agent sources) with respect to energy. The tempering agent<br>
of this level can come in direct or indirect relationship to the level of outside<br>
temperature and the temperature level T2 required by the printing machine, as<br>
desired from the different cooling processes or tempering agent sources of the cold<br>
unit 77 or generally as is specific mix of tempering agent from both cooling<br>
processes that are energy-wise different (see below). Details about the nature and<br>
manner of how this can be readied by a cooling unit 77 are further described<br>
below in fig. 11. A pump 80 transporting the tempering agent in the cycle K2 can<br>
ideally be foreseen in a line branch of the supply cycle K2 in the supply unit 71, or<br>
even in the cold unit 77.<br>
In a design shown as dashed line in the right hand part of fig. 8, a third cycle K3 is<br>
foreseen that is similarly supplied by the cold unit 77. The cold unit 77 (see<br>
below) provides tempering agent to this supply cycle K3 at an 'average'<br>
temperature level T3 that lies at a higher temperature range as compared to the<br>
cycle K2, e.g. 20 to 35°C, particularly 24 to 30°C. The requirement or definition<br>
of the desired temperature level T3 to the cold unit 77 takes place through a<br>
computing and/or control unit 100 of the printing machine on a logic unit 92, e.g.<br>
control 92 of the cold unit 77 (see fig. 11). The computing and/or control unit 100<br><br>
30<br>
and the control unit 75 can be designed as a single control unit or as components<br>
of the same control unit.<br>
In an alternative shown by dashed line in fig. 8 and 9, the cycle K3 is connected to<br>
the decentralised supply unit 71 and the tempering agent is fed to the receivers<br>
(see below: drives M and/or drive regulators) of the printing towers 73 not directly<br>
as described above but through the supply unit 71.<br>
Fig. 9 shows an advantageous extension of the decentralised supply unit 71 that<br>
contains at least both the supply cycles Kl and K2 as well as in a possible design<br>
version (dashed line) the supply cycle K3. The supply unit 71 is allocated to a<br>
group of n printing mechanism 41, which here form the printing mechanism 41 of<br>
a printing tower 73 (e.g. fig. 8, right). For reason of better overview only two<br>
cylinders 43 to be tempered, e.g. form cylinders 43, and two rollers 54, e.g. screen<br>
rollers 54, are shown, which ultimately corresponds to two print points, e.g. a<br>
double print point for simultaneous both-sided printing of two transmission<br>
cylinders 47 placed against one another in rubber-against-rubber operation.<br>
In the shown design form preparation of the tempering agent takes place in the<br>
tempering cycle KFZ, short cycle KFZ of the form cylinders 43 pair-wise, i.e.<br>
always two form cylinders 43, particularly those of a common double print point<br>
are supplied parallel with the prepared tempering agent. Basically, depending on<br>
the requirement, it is also possible to allocate a tempering cycle KFZ to each<br>
individual form cylinder 43 or even larger groups (e.g. four, six or eight) of form<br>
cylinders 43.<br>
The tempering takes place in such a way that in the tempering cycle KFZ the<br>
tempering agent, driven by a pump 81, circulates and thereby flows through the<br>
allocated component(s) 43; 54 to be tempered, especially their tempering unit 57;<br><br>
31<br>
58. At the crossing point 82 tempering agent from one of the supply cycles Kl<br>
(for heating purposes) or K2 (for cooling purposes) can be fed and an adequate<br>
quantity can be discharged at the crossing point 83. Selection of the dosage of<br>
tempering agent takes place through the position (opened or closed) of valves 78.<br>
Remote-controlled switching valves 78 in corresponding line branches and<br>
connected to the supply cycles Kl; K2. After connecting the line branches dosage<br>
of the selected tempering agent takes place in the tempering cycle KFZ through a<br>
remote-controlled dosage valve 79. At the crossing point 82 the dosed quantity<br>
gets mixed with the tempering agent circulating in the tempering cycle KFZ,<br>
whereby quick mixing can be further accelerated by a (not shown) turbulence<br>
chamber between crossing point 82 and pump 81.<br>
A desired/rated value for a temperature of the component 43; 54 (explained here on the<br>
basis of a form cylinder pair representative of individual or groups of form cylinders 54<br>
or screen rollers 54) can be generated on principle in different ways and should now be<br>
converted in the supply unit 71 for this component 43; 54. The value for the desired or<br>
rated temperature T i,rated of the component 43; 54 to be tempered can be given as<br>
described above for fig. 6 and 7 in relationship to the production speed V, whereby<br>
additionally also the ink type F and/or paper type to be used can be considered. In the<br>
simplest version of the regulating cycle the conversion can take place in a manner that at<br>
least a measured value m2 for the temperature of the tempering agent is determined<br>
shortly before entry into the component 43; 54 and/or a measured value m3 for the<br>
surface temperature of the component 43; 54 excel, e.g. as measured value m3 of an<br>
intra-red sensor directed on to the roller surface, is determined and compared with the<br>
relevant desired/rated value in the control electronic mechanism 72. Depending on the<br>
variation, tempering agent from one of the supply cycles Kl or K2 is fed into the cycle<br>
KFZ (or KRW, see below) through the dosage valve 79. Selection of the required cycle<br>
K2; K3 (temperature level Tl or T2) takes place through a corresponding setting<br>
command SI; S2 from the control electronic mechanism 72 to the switching valves 78<br>
(e.g. one closed and the other open); dosage of the required injection quantity takes place<br><br>
32<br>
through a setting command S from the control electronic mechanism 72 through the<br>
dosage valve 79.<br>
An advantageous extension of the described regulating cycle reacts significantly faster<br>
with a measured value ml for the temperature shortly after mixing at the crossing point<br>
82,	particularly after a turbulence chamber and still before the pump 81, a measured value<br>
m2 of the temperature of the tempering agent shortly before entry into the component 43;<br>
54 (already in the region of the corresponding printing mechanism 41) and/or a measured<br>
value m3 (of an intra-red sensor) for the surface temperature of the component 43; 54 or<br>
of the ink present on it itself, and a measured value m5 for the temperature of the<br>
tempering agent in reflux (already again in the supply unit 71) before the crossing point<br>
83.	In an extension also additionally a measured value m4 can be taken up shortly after<br>
exit from the component 43; 54 (still in the region of the corresponding printing<br>
mechanism 41). These measured values ml to m3 and m5 as well as, if required, m4 are<br>
now jointly processed in a multiple-cascading regulating cycle under consideration of<br>
running time corrections and pre-controlled members, as described in details in the<br>
document WO 2004/054805 Al, the content of which is specifically referred to in this<br>
context. Especially by using the measured value ml shortly behind the dosage point, if<br>
required after a turbulence stretch but before the pump 81, it is possible to significantly<br>
reduce the reaction time under consideration of regulating stretch information, as<br>
compared to a regulation where only measured values m3, m4 or m5 are taken into<br>
account. The result of an intervention in the last mentioned case is noticed and taken into<br>
account only much later.<br>
Also measured values m6 and m7 are taken for recording the temperatures in the feed-<br>
flow lines of the supply cycles Kl and K2 and fed to the control electronic mechanism 72<br>
for consideration.<br>
The structure and effectiveness of a tempering cycle KFZ; KRW was described in fig. 9<br>
merely on the example of the form cylinder 43. However this has to be similarly applied<br><br>
33<br>
to the other tempering cycles KFZ of other form cylinders 43 allocated to the supply unit<br>
71, as well as to tempering of the screen rollers 54.<br>
In the example the screen rollers 54 are tempered individually to a number of 1<br>
independently controllable tempering cycles KRW short cycle KRW, which are<br>
connected to both the cycles Kl and K2. This has the background that in this way for<br>
each individual screen roller 54 the ink quantity to be transported can be set. For the sake<br>
of safety the tempering cycles KRW of two screen rollers 54 of a double print point are<br>
connected to one another through bypass lines that can be closed. For this, corresponding<br>
valves 84 are foreseen. If for example, in one of both cycles KRW, a pump 81 or dosage<br>
valve 79 fails, then temporarily tempering of the endangered component 43; 54 can be<br>
taken over by the corresponding cycle KRW after opening and closing corresponding<br>
valves 84. The same is indicated by dashed line for the cycle KFZ of the form cylinders<br>
43, whereby tempering of two form cylinders 43 affected by the breakdown can be taken<br>
over by an adjacent cycle KFZ of two other form cylinders 43.<br>
If also the cycle K3 is coupled to the supply unit 71, then the principle of mixing of<br>
tempering agent from the cycle K3 into a tempering cycle KAN short cycle KAN, by<br>
which one or more groups of drives M of the printing unit 73 can be tempered, can be<br>
applied (see dashed line depiction of K3 in fig. 9). In this case the preparation of this<br>
cycle KAN is controlled by the allocated dosage valve 79 in relationship to the measured<br>
value ml directly after feeding and/or in relation to the measured value m5 in the reflux.<br>
As no heating up is required here, the tempering cycle KAN is connected only with one<br>
supply cycle K3. As the drive tempering is less critical than that of the form cylinders 43<br>
or rollers 54, here a larger number of n drives M can be tempered by a common cycle<br>
KAN. It could be advantageous if a number of m = 2 cycles KAN is foreseen to<br>
respectively supply to one half (left or right side of a printing unit 73 or printing tower<br>
73) (see fig. 10).<br>
In both cycles K2 and K3 the inlet and outlet line in the region of their end away from the<br>
cold unit 77 are preferably connected to one another through at least one bypass line that<br><br>
34<br>
can be opened or closed by means of switch-able valves 85. If the cycles KFZ and KRW<br>
take up very little tempering agent then this valve 85 can be opened in order to maintain<br>
an adequate fluid flow and thus retain a correctly tempered tempering agent in the feed<br>
line for the cycles KFZ and KRW. Here two or more bypass lines can be used for each<br>
cycle Kl; K2 with valves 85 of different flow cross-sections, or even one valve 85 per<br>
cycle, whose flow quantity can be controlled.  Thus the circulation quantity can be<br>
set/adjusted staggered according to requirement.<br>
In the cycle K2 always at least a small quantity of tempering agent circulates, so that if<br>
tempering agent of suitable temperature is required the reaction time is as short as<br>
possible.<br>
Fig. 10 shows an advantageous extension of a printing tower 73 with a number of i = 8<br>
printing mechanism 41 which here form a number of h = i/2 = 4 double print points or<br>
double printing mechanisms 62 for simultaneous both-sided printing with two<br>
transmission cylinders 47 placed against one another in rubber-against-rubber-operation.<br>
The supply unit 71 with control and regulating unit 72 is allocated to the printing drum<br>
73. As shown explicitly only for the bottom-most of the four double printing<br>
mechanisms 62, each screen roller 54 of the printing tower 73 has its own cycle KRW.<br>
The form cylinders 43 belonging to the same double print mechanism 62 pair-wise have a<br>
common cycle KFZ. All rotary drives M, the screen roller 54 and form and transmission<br>
cylinders 43; 47 of the same side of the print material web 49 are connected to a common<br>
cycle K3. Thus for this printing tower 73 one obtains k = 4 cycles KFZ, 1 = 8 cycles<br>
KRW and m = 2 cycles KAN according to fig. 9. All form and transmission cylinders<br>
43; 47 as well as screen rollers 54 have as drives M individual drives mechanically<br>
independent of one another, so that for each cycle KAN a number of n = 12 drives M can<br>
be tempered.<br>
For supplying the printing machine or the supply units 71 with tempering agent of the<br>
second cycle K2 and also the third cycle K3 the cold central unit 77is foreseen. In a<br>
particularly advantageous design form the cold central unit 77, as shown in fig. 11, is<br><br>
35<br>
designed as combination plant that has two cooling processes 86; 87 coupled with one<br>
another, namely a first process 87 with a unit 89, 90, 91, e.g. cold machine 89, 90, 91 for<br>
generating compression cold, and a second process 86 with a unit 88 for cooling with the<br>
help of surrounding or atmospheric air. The first process 87 is designed for cooling a<br>
tempering agent to a temperature level Tk below the surrounding or atmospheric<br>
temperature. However, it is important that the processes 86; 87 are coupled with one<br>
another in such a way that both above mentioned cycles K2; K3 can be supplied with<br>
cold by both processes 86; 87. Depending on the requirement of temperature level T2;<br>
T3 of the concerned cycle K2; K3, this supply can take place through one or the other<br>
process 86; 87 as desired, or by a combination of both processes 86; 87. For this, an<br>
intelligent control 92 is foreseen for readying the tempering agent for the cycles K2; K3<br>
by optimum utilisation of the unit 88 for cooling with the help of surrounding or<br>
atmospheric air.<br>
The second process 86 has in a first cooling agent or fluid cycle 93 the unit 88 for cooling<br>
with the help of surrounding or atmospheric air, in short free cooling unit 88, which for<br>
example can be designed as convection cooler with or without evaporator. The energy<br>
exchange takes place through thermal contact between the fluid of the fluid cycle 93 and<br>
the atmospheric air and in case of additional spraying with water also makes use of the<br>
evaporation cold. The free cooling unit 88 is thermally coupled through the fluid exit-<br>
side to the cycles K2; K3 - e.g. respectively through a heat exchanger 94; 96. It is<br>
especially coupled on to the refluxes of both cycles K2; K3, from which part-flows 106;<br>
107 can be taken away after flowing to the heat exchangers 94; 96 through regulate-able<br>
valves 103; 104 for feeding again into both the cycles K2 and K3. The more or less big<br>
de-coupled part-flow 108; 109 is brought into thermal contact with the first process 87<br>
before the required quantity of fluid cooled in this process 87 is fed into the cycles K2;<br>
K3 through the valves 103; 104. For regulating the flow volume passing through the heat<br>
exchangers 94; 96 on the side of the fluid cycles 93, a regulate-able valve 97; 98 is<br>
respectively foreseen, which divides the fluid flow into a flow through the heat exchanger<br>
94; 96 and a flow flowing into the reflux to the unit 88. Conveying of the fluid takes<br>
place for each heat exchanger branch by means of a pump 99.<br><br>
36<br>
The first process 87 is foreseen in order to reduce the fluid of the de-coupled part-flows<br>
108; 109 to a temperature level Tk under atmospheric temperature and for readying it for<br>
re-coupling into the cycles K2; K3. For cold generation the first process 87 has cold<br>
agents in a fluid cycle 101, the unit 89, 90, 91 for generating compression cold that has a<br>
compressor 89, a cooler 91, e.g. as free cooling unit 91 and a relaxing valve 90. The unit<br>
89, 90, 91 or the first process 87 is thermally coupled with the cycles K2 and K3 behind<br>
the relaxing valve on the exit side. The process 87 is coupled through the heat exchanger<br>
to part-flows 111; 112 for return-feeding of previously de-coupled and subsequently<br>
cooled fluid into both the cycles K2 and K3. Between heat exchanger 102 and the valves<br>
103; 104 a storage 113 can be arranged, from which the part-flows 111; 112 can be<br>
served and in which the de-coupled part-flows 108; 109 are guided. Thus through a<br>
pump 114 fluid from the storage 113 can be continuously conveyed in a circle through<br>
the heat exchanger 102 and, on the other side, cooled fluid can be taken as required for<br>
re-feeding into the cycles K2 and K3.<br>
Both the refluxes from K2 and K3 are thus first brought into thermal contact with the<br>
second process 86 before they can be respectively divided as required by the respective<br>
rated temperatures T2rated; T3rated into two part-flows, where one part-flow is straight<br>
away fed into the supply flow of the concerned cycle K2; K3, whereas the other part-flow<br>
is brought in thermal contact with the first process 81, before fluid cooled in this process<br>
87 is similarly fed back into the supply flow of the concerned cycles K2; K3. The<br>
respective ratio/relationship between the flows 106 to 111 or 107 to 112 is set by the<br>
control and can basically lie from 0% to 100% to 100% to 0% of the respective set feed<br>
flow 116; 117, i.e. the feed flow 116; 117 can be prepared from a mixture of both part-<br>
flows 106 and 111 or 107 and 112 or even only from one of the part-flows 106 or 111, or<br>
107 or 112.<br>
If this is not prepared and conveyed in the supply unit 71, as described above and<br>
indicated by continuous lines in fig. 8 and 9 for the cycle K3, a pump 95 can be foreseen<br>
in the feed flow 116 of the cycle K3. In the case shown by dashed line in fig. 9 the<br>
corresponding pump 95 can be foreseen in the supply unit 71.<br><br>
37<br>
The control 92 receives from a computing and/or control unit 100 of the printing machine<br>
rated temperatures T2rated; T3rated for the temperature levels T2; T3 in the initial run of the<br>
cycles K2; K3 and from a thermometer the outside temperature TA. The computing<br>
and/or control unit 100 can be part or process of a machine control, a control computer or<br>
even a process in another control unit allocated to the printing machine. Depending on<br>
the rated temperatures T2rated; T3rated and the outside temperature TA the cooling strategy<br>
is laid down by the control 92 and through only indicated signal contacts the resulting<br>
settings of the concern valve 103; 104 are done, e.g. regulating valves 103; 104 (and if<br>
required 97; 98) as setting members 103; 104 (97; 98).<br>
Possible operating situations are described as example below for a certain given value of<br>
rated temperature T2rated; T3rated, e.g. T2rated having a value between 10°C and 25°C and<br>
T3rated having a value between 24°C and 30°C. If the outside temperature TA of air is say<br>
TA 
77, i.e. the rollers 54 and cylinders 43 takes place to a maximum of approx. 50% through<br>
the process 86, e.g. the free cooling unit 88 and the remaining requirement through the<br>
cold machine 89, 90, 91. The cooling or supply of the connected cycles K3, i.e. the<br>
drives, takes place up to 100% to the free cooling unit 88. The feed flow 116 is fed up to<br>
100% from the part-flow 106.<br>
With increasing outside temperature TA to say approx.20°C the cooling or supply to the<br>
cycles K2 connected to the cold unit 77 takes place to an increasing extent to a cold<br>
machine 89, 90, 91 and lesser and lesser to the free cooling unit 88. The cooling or<br>
supply of the connected cycles K3 can still take place up to 100% through the free<br>
cooling unit 88, if for example a rated temperature T3rated of say 24 to 30°C is pre-given.<br>
If the outside temperature TA lies at approx. 20 - 24°C then cooling or supply of the<br>
cycles K2 connected to the cold unit 77 takes place exclusively through the cold machine<br>
89, 90, 91; the feed flow 117 into the cycle K2 takes place up to 100% from the part-flow<br><br>
38<br>
112. Cooling or supply through the connected cycles K3 now takes place only partially<br>
through the free cooling unit 88 and the remaining part to the cold machine 89, 90, 91.<br>
If the outside temperature is say approx. 24°C or more, the cooling or supply of the<br>
cycles K2 and K3 connected to the cold unit 77 takes place only through the cold<br>
machine 89, 90, 91.<br>
In addition to the described outside temperature influence the pre-given data for the rated<br>
temperatures T2rated; T3rated, particularly the rated value temperature T2rated, could vary<br>
with the machine status of the printing machine, especially with the production speed V.<br>
Important for generating the rated value T2rated is however the lowest required/rated value<br>
temperature of all printing mechanisms 41 or their form cylinders 43 and screen rollers<br>
54 to be supplied by the cold unit 77. Adherence to this lowest rated temperature must be<br>
ensured by the pre-given value of the rated value temperature T2rated. If this lowest rated<br>
temperature for the component 43; 54 to be tempered gets altered with run-up of the<br>
machine to higher production speeds V, then the rated value temperature T2rated can also<br>
be increased by the computing and/or control unit 100. By raising the rated value<br>
temperature T2rated the above mentioned threshold temperatures for the different cooling<br>
combinations can however also go up.<br>
Fig. 12 and 13 show two advantageous extensions in which a portion of heat energy is<br>
recovered. These extensions can be integrated individually or together into the above<br>
mentioned tempering.<br>
In the first version (fig. 12) a direct utilisation of the hot reflux takes place, e.g. with<br>
maximum temperature of 35 to 40°C, preferably approx. 38°C, from the cycle K3 to<br>
tempering of the drives M, for example by a fluid-gas-heat exchanger 119, e.g. a heat<br>
exchanger-heat register, for direct air heating during winter operation.<br>
In the second version (fig. 13) utilisation of the tempering agent reflux from the cycle K2<br>
takes place as heat source for a heating pump 121. Through the heating pump 121a<br><br>
39<br>
higher temperature level, e.g. up to 55°C, can be attained in a storage 122 than in the<br>
version shown in fig. 12; however, additional structural complication and energy<br>
consumption is required.<br>
Both recovery concepts shown in fig. 12 and 13 can however also fall back on the other<br>
source (K2 or K3) - e.g. in fig. 12 on the reflux of K2 and in fig. 13 on the reflux of K3.<br>
The systems can also fall back on to the heat flow 63 (see fig. 5) as source.<br><br>

(43; 47) works together with the material to be printed on (49).<br><br>
The invention relates to a method for adjusting the transfer of printing ink, wherein a first roller (54), which is<br>
arranged in an inker unit (42) of a printing machine, transfers printing ink to a form cylinder (43). A temperature control unit (57)<br>
enables the outer surface of the first roller (54) to reach the required temperature and/or a temperature control unit (58) enables<br>
the outer surface of the form cylinder (43) to reach the required temperature. Said temperature control unit (57) of the first roller<br>
(54) and/or the temperature control unit (58) of the form cylinder (43) can be, respectively, controlled or regulated by an adjusting<br>
device (37). specific curves or reference points for an interrelation between the production speed (V) of a printing machine and the<br>
respective required temperature on the outer surface of the form cylinder (43) or on the outer surface of the first roller (54) are stored<br>
 in a storage unit (34) of the adjusting device (37) for various printing inks and/or ink types.</td>
