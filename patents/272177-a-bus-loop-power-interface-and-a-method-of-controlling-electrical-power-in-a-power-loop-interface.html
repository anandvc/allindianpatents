riowmeters are used to measure the mass flow rate, density, and other characteristics of flowing materials. The flowing materials can comprise liquids, gases, combined liquids and gases, solids suspended in liquids, and liquids including gases and suspended solids. For example, flowmeters are widely used in the well production and refining of petroleum and petroleum products. A flowmeter can be used to determine well production by measuring a flow rate [i.e., by measuring a mass flow through the flowmeter), and can even be used to determine the relative proportions of the gas and liquid components of a flow.<br>
In many process control or industrial automation settings, a bus loop {or instrumentation bus) is used to connect to various devices, such as sensor devices and other instrument devices. The bus loop is commonly used to deliver electrical power to the various attached instrument or sensor devices. In addition, the bus loop is also commonly used to ciommunicaie data both to and from the sensor or instrument device. Therefore, the bus loop is connected tc a mester device that can provide regulated electrical power over the bus and that can perfomn<br>
)     communications over the bus. The master device can send commands and/or programming, data, calibrations and other settings, etc., to the sensor and instrument devices. The master device can also receive data from the sensor and instrument devices, including identification data, calibration data, measurement data, operational data, etc.<br>
)	FIG, 1 shows a two-wire bus loop 1 according to the prior art. The bus loop<br>
1 can include a master device 2 that operates the bus loop 1, multiple sensor or<br>
instrument devices 3-5, and terminators 6, The master device 2 can pass digital<br>
communication signals to external devices, such as to monitoring and control<br>
stations, for example. The master device 2 is connected to an electrical power<br>
1<br><br><br>
However, this prior art power regulation has drawbacks. The maximum electrical power (P) provided in this prior art arrangement comprises the output voltage of the series regulator (V) multiplied by the loop current (1), Aloop interface that uses this kind of linear regulation has poor power transfer because the voltage parameter V in the available power equation (P = V X 1) is essentially fixed. In addition, the bus voltage dips wher. the loop current increases, due to the relatively high loop impedance.<br>
One possible solution could be the use of a switch mode power supply (SMPS). A SMPS is also referred to as a switched mode power supply or a switching power supply. A SMPS generates a time vary'ing signal from the DC bus voltage, performs a voltage step-up conversion, and converts the resulting time- ■ varying signal back to a DC voltagelhat can have a higher voltage level thar^ the 
However, the drawback of a SMPS device is that a SMPS device typically has a low input impedance characteristic. This is not compatible with a device powered from the bus loop 1, where the loop impedance is kept high in order to )     enable communication signals to pass over the bus bop 1.<br>

Detailed Description of the invention<br>
FIGS. 3-4 and the following description depict specific examples to teach<br>
those skilled in the art how to make and use the best mode of the invention. For<br>
5<br><br><br>
The bus device in one embodiment comprises a flow meter, suct^ as a Coriolis flow meter or a vibrating densitometer, for example. However, otiier bus dsvices are contemplated and are within tlie scope of the description and claims.<br>
The bus loop power interi'ace 100 includes a voltage control module 110, an impedance contro: module 120, and a fsedbacf'. 115 coupled betvi'een the voltage control module 110 and the impsdance control module 120. The bus loop power interface IOC includes a pair of input terminals 101 configured to be coupled to an bus loop 1 and a pair of output terminals 102 configured to be coupled to a sensor or instrument device (also not shown). The impedance control module 120 receives the loop current ILOOP from the input terminals 101 and the voltage control module 110 Is connected to the pairof output terminals 102, The bus loop power interface 100 receives a loop vottaga VLOO? from; the bus and provides a predetermined supply voltage VSJPPLY at the output terminals 102. In addition, the bus loop power interface 100 receives a loop current ILOOP "from the bus and provides a predetermined supply current (SUPPLV at the output terminals 102.<br>
The voltage control module 110 provides the predetermined supply voltage VsuppLY from the loop voltage V:,oop. The voltage control module HOincludesa switch mode power supply (SMPS) in some embodiments. The supply voltage VsuppLY of the voltage control module 110 (and of the bus loop power interface 100) can comphse a direct current (DC) voltage in some embodiments. Alternatively, the supply voltage VSUPPLY can comprise a DC voltage including a superimposed digital communication signal.<br>
7<br><br><br>
In some embodiments, the predetermined supply ourrsnt ISUPPLY produced by ttie impedance control module 120 is substantially fixed. Alternatively, in other embodiments the predetermined supply current ISUPPLY 'S varying, such as in embodiments whsre a varying current is used to generate a communication signal.<br>
In some embodiments, the impedance control module 120 includes an impedance control line 106, The impedance control line 106 is configured to control ths predetermined supply current !SU^?-Y and control the electrical impedance of the impedance control module 120.<br>
The impedance control line 106 can be used in some embodiments to vary the supply current ISUPPLY- such as in embodiments that employ electrical current to generate a communication signal. Afternatively, in other embodiments the impedance control line 106 can comprise a fixed value that generates a substantially fixed impedance vaiue (and therefore a substantially fixed supply<br>
current ISUPPLY)-<br>
The feedback 115 generates feedback from the impedance control module 120 to the voltage control module 11D. The feedback 115 provides a feedback signal to the voltage control module 110 that enables the voltage control module 110 to substantially maintain the predetermined supply voltage VSUPPLY- The feedback 115 can include a voltage level feedback, for example, v/herein the voltage control module 110 uses the voltage level feedback in order to maintain the supply voltage VSUPPLY- in addition or alternatively, the feedback 115 can transfer an error current to the voltage control module 110, wherein the error current generates a feedback voltage that is used by the voltage control module 110 to maintain the supply voltage VSUPPLY (see FIG. 4 and the accompanying text).<br>
S ■<br><br><br>
The bus loop pow&amp;r intsTface 100 can be used with any instrument bus, such as a FIELDBUS, a PROFIBUS, or a HART biss, for example.  In these applications, a digital communication signal can be superimposed on the supplied electrical power. Alternaiwsly, the bus loop povjer intenace 100 can be ussd, for a 4-20 miliiamp (mA) bus loop, for example, wherein the electrical current output is modulated in order to generate a superimposed communication signal.<br>
In some embodiments, the bus loop power interfa-s 100 can be used in intrinsically safe fIS) environments. An IS environment can include vapors, gases, liquids, dust, etc.. that presents a fire or explosion hazard. Therefore, an tS compliant bus is limited in available current and/or voltage that it can supply.<br>
Advantageously, the bus loop power interface 100 can maximize delivered electrical power by maximizing both the available voltage and the available current. This is achieved while maintaining a high input impedance. Tne bus loop power interface 100 will substantially maintain the supply voltage VSUPPLY over various current levels. The bus loop power interface 100 therefore facilitates communication while delivering maximum electrical pov^'er.<br>
The bus loop power interface 100 implements a method of controlling electrical power according to an embodiment of the invention. The bus loop power interface 100 receives electrical power from an instrumentation bus at a bop voltage VLQOP and at a loop cuaent ILDDP, generates a predetermined supply voltage VSUPPLY from the loop voltage VLOQP, and generates a predetermined supply current ISUPPLY. The predetermined supply current ISUPPLY is related to a predetermined impedance characteristic of the bus loop power interface.<br>
9<br><br><br>
FIG. 4 shows the bus loop power interface 100 according to an embodiment of the invention. The bus loop power interface 100 in this embodiment includes the voltage control module 110, the impedance control module 120, and the feedback I'^S, as previously discussed.<br>
The voltage control moduie 110 in this embodiment includes a switch mode power supply ('SMPS).U2, an inductor L-,, capacitors C-i and C2. a diode Di; and a Zener diode Zi. As previously discussed, the predetermined supply voltage VSUPPLV can comprise a DC voltage that is greater than, equal to, or less than the loop DC voltage VLOOP. The capacitor, inductor, and diode components can be chosen to achieve the predetermined supply voltage VSUPPLY.<br>
The impedance control module 120 in this embodiment includes an op-amp Ui, B vesistor Ri, a voltage input VJsev, and a transistor Q-,. The op-amp Ui includes input temiinals across the resistor Ri. The transistor Q-, is biased by the op-amp Ui. The resistor Ri receives the loop current ILOO? and the transistor Qi receives the loop current LOOF and generates a predetermined supply current IsuppLY. The op-amp Ui is configured to measure the voltage across the resistor Ri, wherein the voltage is generated by an electrical cun-ent (i.e., ILOOP) flowing through the resistor R,. The.measured current is used to control the gate (G) voltage of the transistor Qi. Changing the voltage bias of the gate of the transistor Qi changes the SDurce-to-drain impedance of the transistor Qi-<br>
10<br><br><br>
feedback resistor R2. The transistor Q2 is biased by the ioop voltage VLOD?. The feedback resistor R2 is connected between the transistor Qi and ground. The feedback resistor R^ receives s feedback current IF fron-^ ttie transistor Q^. A feedback voltage VFE across the feedback resistor R2 is received by a feedback input FB of the SMPS U2. When the actual supply voltage VSUPPLV increases to above s target supply voltage, the bias voltage at the base of the transistor Q2 will increase. If the voltage across the base-collector junction of the transistor Q2 {i.e., VBC of Q2) becomes greater than 0.7 volts, then a positive feedback current IFS will flow through the feadback resistor R2 to ground. This in turn causes the voltage across the feedback resistor R2 to increase and consequently places a higher feedback voltage on the feedback (FB) pin of the SMPS U2. As a result, the supply voltage VSUPPLY will be reduced by the SMPS U2. Conversely, if the actual supply voltage VSUPPLY drops below the predetermined supply voltage, the feedback voltage at the F3 pin will decrease and the SMPS U2 will bring the actual supply voltage VSUPPLY up to substantially the same isvel as the predetermined target supply voltage VSUPPLY. The transistor Q2 and the feedback resistor R2 enable the SMPS U2 to substantially maintain the predetermined supply voltage VSUPPLY.<br>
The invention can advantageously maximize available power at the pair of output terminals 102. The power can be represented as:<br>
P = JV1.00P - (VBE of Q2)] * ILDOP * (E of U2)	(1)<br>
I     where (VBE of Q2) is the voltage across the base-emitter junction of transistor Q2 and where (E of U2) is the switching efficiency of the SMPS Uo. The term [VLOOF -(VBE of Q2)] comprises the voltage Vci across the capacitor Ci, and is equivalent to the supply voltage VSUPPLY.<br>
