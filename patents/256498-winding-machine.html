3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: -<br><br>
Winding machine<br>
The invention relates to a winding machine with a large number of winding heads, which can be operated independently of one another and with which a winding head computer is associated in each case, which is arranged inside a housing-like covering, which covers drive elements.<br>
Winding machines have the object of winding cross-wound bobbins, which are used in further processing on mechanical weaving looms or knitting machines or hosiery machines or the like. The cross-wound bobbins are wound from yarn, which was produced on a spinning machine, in particular a ring spinning machine and wound onto relatively small yarn bodies, for example spinning cops. The yarn from a large number of yarn bodies of this type, which are supplied successively to a winding head, is drawn off these yarn bodies and wound onto the cross-wound bobbin. During this rewinding, the yarn is checked for yarn faults, which are cleared from the yarn. For this purpose, the winding process is interrupted, the site with the yarn fault is cut out, whereupon the yarn ends produced are connected to one another again, in particular by a splice connection, whereupon the winding process is continued.<br>
The winding heads of winding machines of this type operate completely automatically, with one winding head computer controlling the individual working steps, such as, the changing of the feed bobbins, the drawing off of the thread by means of a winding roller and winding onto a take-up bobbin, the tensioning of the thread, the cutting of the thread to cut out yarn faults, the reconnection of the thread and the changing of the cross-wound bobbin on reaching a predetermined degree of filling.<br>
It occurs again and again that one of the working steps controlled by the winding head computer is not carried out successfully even after several repeated attempts. This winding head is then shut down by the winding head computer.  In order to<br>
-2-<br><br>
continue the winding process at this winding head again, an operator has to intervene.<br>
The invention is based on the object of making it easier for an operator to recognise and eliminate a fault at a winding head.<br>
This object is achieved in that a display device is arranged at each winding head, which contains a plurality of transparent single images of possible faults and/or fault sites, with which a light source is associated in each case, which can be controlled individually by the winding head computer.<br>
Because of this display device, it is made substantially easier for an operator to recognise the type of fault and the site of the fault and to take the necessary counter measures. For this purpose, the single images are implemented as a selection of symbols, which indicate the site of the fault and/or the type of fault. The symbols indicate, for example, disruptions in the drive area of the winding head, in the area of the cop changing mechanism or the cop transporting system, in the area of the thread run between the cop and winding mechanism, in the area of the winding mechanism and the transporting mechanism following it for transporting away completely wound cross-wound bobbins, the energy supply or the like. This places an operator in a position to orientate himself in order to limit the fault source with the aid of the transparent single images without having to interpret a fault code, for example, which in turn assumes knowledge of the fault code or requires access to a corresponding handbook. Instead, the visual display allows immediate detection of the site at which the fault has occurred to place an operator in the position of qualifying the fault with regard to whether he can eliminate the fault himself or a further person should be informed.<br>
In a further configuration of the invention it is provided that push buttons arranged in a vertical row are then present after the lower end of the edge web enclosing the base face and are surrounded by an edge web, which repeats the form of the edge<br>
-3-<br><br>
web of the display device. With the aid of these push buttons, certain work sequences of the relevant winding head can be started and stopped again.<br>
It is advantageous for each winding head, in particular in the region of the base face of the display device, to be provided with a lamp, which is switched on by the winding head computer when the winding head is ready for operation and/or in operation. For this purpose, the status of the components connected to the winding head computer via a data bus and controlled thereby is transmitted cyclically. The transmission may take place by means of a query from the winding head computer or by independent transmission of the components. For the period when all the components of the winding head are ready for operation, the winding head computer controls the lamp accordingly, so this lamp visually displays the readiness for operation. An operator patrolling along a plurality of winding machines can therefore immediately recognise even from a relatively large distance whether a winding head is in operation or ready for operation. A lamp of this type at each winding station is also advantageous if no display device is provided.<br>
In a further configuration of the invention it is provided that the display device and the push buttons are arranged on a carrier plate which is fitted under the covering and is provided with an interface for a connection of an external apparatus arranged behind a removable lid part of the covering. The operator may, for example attach a diagnostic apparatus here if a fault cannot easily be seen or cannot easily be eliminated.<br>
Further features and advantages of the invention emerge from the following description of the embodiment shown in the drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a partial view of a winding head of a winding machine, which is equipped with a large number of similar winding heads, and<br>
-4-<br><br>
Fig. 2 shows a front view of a carrier plate, on which a display device is arranged, to a larger scale.<br>
The winding head shown only partially in Fig. 1 of a winding machine equipped with a large number of winding heads of this type winds a thread drawn off a cop, not shown, onto a cross-wound bobbin 10. The cross-wound bobbin 10, which is held by means of a bobbin arm 11, rests on a winding roller 12 configured as a fluted roller and is driven thereby. The thread, not shown, runs on its way from the cop to the cross-wound bobbin 10 through a thread tensioner 13, a thread clearer 14 and via a waxing device 15. If the clearer 14 detects a yarn fault, a cutting device is actuated, which severs the running thread and causes the winding roller 12 to be shut down. This produces a thread end, which is connected to the cop, and a thread end, which is connected to the cross-wound bobbin 10. The thread end, which comes from the cop, is gripped by means of a suction gripper 16, which swings upwardly and places the thread in a splicing mechanism 17. A suction gripper 18 is pivoted upwardly and fed to the cross-wound bobbin 10. This suction gripper 18 takes the thread coming from the cross-wound bobbin and - after the portion containing the fault has been separated - also places it in the splicing mechanism 17. The two thread ends are connected again in the slicing device 17, so the winding process is continued by starting up the winding roller 12 again.<br>
The operation of the thread tensioner 13 and the winding roller 12 and the function of the clearer 14, the cutting of the running thread and the working steps required to reconnect the thread ends are controlled by a winding station computer, which is arranged behind a housing-like covering 19, which covers the drive elements for the winding roller 12, the two suction grippers 16,18 for the splicing mechanism 17 and further devices, at least partially.<br>
From time to time a fault occurs, which the winding head cannot automatically eliminate itself, for example no thread coming from the cop, the so-called lower thread, is found, or no thread coming from the bobbin 10, the so-called upper thread,<br>
-5-<br><br>
is found, or no splicing connection is produced. After these or other faults, which despite many attempts, are not eliminated, the winding head computer shuts down the winding head, in other words the drive of the winding roller 12 is shut down and the winding arm 11 with the cross-wound bobbin 10 is optionally raised. In this case, the operator has to intervene and eliminate the fault, so the winding process can then be continued again.<br>
It is not always possible to immediately see, at the winding head which has been shut down, where the fault lies and where to start to eliminate the fault. In order to make this work easier for the operator, each winding head is equipped with a display device 20, which displays at least the site of the fault. This display device 20, which is produced to an enlarged scale in Fig. 2, contains a large number of single images 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 26, which display the site and/or the type of fault. These single images 21 to 26, which are configured as elements used in the display device 20, are at least partially transparent. In each case, a light source is arranged behind them, which can be activated by the winding head computer, in other words can be switched on.<br>
The single image 21 indicates that the fault is in the area of the bobbin. The single image 22 shows that the fault is in the area of the thread run between the cop and cross-wound bobbin 10. The single image 23 indicates that the fault lies in the area of the cop. The single image 24 illuminates when a fault is present in the yarn number. The single image 25 illuminates when a malfunction occurs in the region of the splicing mechanism 17. The single image 26 indicates that a fault is present in the electromechanical area. The winding head computer has this information, for example that a predetermined number of faulty attempts to carry out the relevant working step has been carried out. With the shut down of the winding head, a signal is then emitted, which allows the light source pertaining to the relevant single image 21 to 26 to illuminate. The light sources may also be activated such that to visually display the site and/ or type of fault, a combination of a plurality of single images 21 to 26 are illuminated.<br>
-6-<br><br>
The button-like or lens-like elements, which represent the single images 21 to 26, are located in a base plate, which is surrounded by a parabola-shaped edge web 27 located with the tip downward. This edge web is continued by a crystal clear covering, which curves over the display device 20. A tumbler switch 28, with which the winding head can be switched off and on manually, is located above this covering inside the edge web 27.<br>
A lamp 29 is provided in the base plate 12, preferably a green lamp, in the region of the lower parabola tip. This lamp 29 is switched on when the winding head is in operation or is ready for operation.<br>
Located below the parabola-shaped edge web 27 are three push buttons 30, 31, 32, which are kept in different colours and are illuminated from the inside, for example, by means of lighting elements. The colours are, for example, red, black and yellow. The push buttons 30, 31, 32 are surrounded by an edge web 33, which at least approximately repeats the shape of the edge web 27.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 1, the display device 20 and the push buttons 30, 31, 32 are accessible through an opening of the front of the covering 19. The carrier plate 34, on which these parts are arranged, is located with its remaining area behind the covering 19. The carrier plate 34 is provided with an interface 35, which leads to a winding head computer. An external apparatus, for example a diagnostic apparatus, can be connected to this interface 35. The interface 35 is located behind the covering 19. However, in the area of the interface 35, this covering is provided with a removable lid 36 (Fig. 1), so the interface 35, if necessary, can be made accessible by the operator.<br>
The display device 20 is also provided, inside the edge web 27 in the base plate, with a two-digit display 37, which indicates a number code or a letter code, which provides further information about the winding head and/or about faults which have occurred.   Instead of the two-digit display 37, an LCD display may also be<br>
-7-<br><br>
provided. Two further lamps 38, 39, which display the functions or faults of the winding head, are located next to this display 37 in the base plate of the display device 20.<br>
The front of the covering 19 is provided with an opening, through which the push buttons 30,31, 32 and the tumbler switch 28 are visible and accessible.<br>
According to the invention, via a data bus, which connects the winding head computer to the components of the winding head, the components connected thereto, such as, for example, the splicing mechanism 17 or the suction gripper 18, of the winding head, are queried with regard to their current status, or the components independently send their status to the winding head computer. The status provides information about the readiness for operation or a malfunction which has occurred or disruption of the components. The status query or transmission takes place at cyclic intervals in order to be able to visually display a change in the status as close to the time as possible so the production stoppage times of the relevant winding head can be kept short. The information available to the winding head computer is converted thereby into a control signal, which is used to control the single images 21 to 26, the lamp 29 and the two-digit display 37. The preferably green lamp 29 outwardly signals the readiness for operation without disruption, or the active operation without disruption, of all the components of the winding head. The fact that the winding head is actively carrying out a winding process, is, however, not an absolute prerequisite for the activation of the lamp 29.<br>
