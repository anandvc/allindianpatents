The following specification describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
Technical field:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for introduction of Fluorine in vinylic monomers, polyesters and acrylic copolymers by using tetra fluoro propanoic acid, a commercial chemical. Particularly, the present invention relates to fluorinated acrylic copolymers as surfactant additives which are used in anti-corrosive highly durable coatings.<br>
•Background and Prior art:<br>
Fluoropolymers are used in functional coating applications due to their unique properties like low coefficient of friction, low surface tension, oil and water repellency, nonadhesive nature and antifouling properties along with the added advantages like their outstanding thermal and chemical stability in extreme conditions. Because of their small size, fluorine atoms can shield a fluorinated carbon atom without any steric stress. As fluorine is difficult to polarize, it results in low intermolecular force and hence fluoropolymers have low surface tension. This is especially advantageous for their applications in surface coatings for imparting corrosion protection properties. Oxygen and water are two essential ingredients for initiating corrosion and water acts as an electrolyte in atmospheric corrosion. Liquid water especially is the most efficient corrosion medium due to its electrical conductive nature, ability to dissolve other corrosive components in the atmosphere like O2, SO2, etc and ionic species. Polymers act as barriers in the protective coatings. However polar groups like hydroxyl, ester, amide etc., in conventional polymers result in molecular interaction with moisture leading to increased surface condensed water. By minimizing such interactions, wetting of the surface can be reduced and protective life of the coatings can be extended. Most of the polymers have critical surface tension less than that of water (72X105 N/cm) and hence are poorly wetted by water. Fluoropolymers are known to have very low critical surface tension due to the small bond polarization of C-F bond. Hence fluoropolymers hinder water reaching the metallic surface in two ways: fluorinated polymers are not wetted by water and secondly the molecular absorption of water into these polymers is relatively small, about<br>
2<br><br>
15% of the conventional films. Introduction of fluorine in a polymeric molecule, thus leads to all round improvements in the polymer properties.<br>
Both surface fluorination and bulk fluorination are used for imparting hydrophobicity. The former approach involves addition of fluoro-component to the composition which is allowed to migrate to the surface and then crosslinked thus anchoring in the matrix. Their ability to migrate to the air interface during drying gives a low surface energy which results in dramatic change in the properties. There are varieties of effects that can be achieved by such surface migration like leveling, easy-clean non stick surface, moisture resistance, biological resistance, etc. Fluorocarbons are the most highly surface-active group of coating additives. Fluorosurfactants aid in wetting and flow because they decrease surface and interfacial tension. Fluorosurfactants are leveling aids because they minimize surface tension gradients between the resin and solvent that resists leveling. Fluorochemical agents function quite effectively and unlike silicones do not usually affect other properties such as water sensitivity. They are generally used at very low levels (0.05-0.10%).<br>
To improve the interaction between the solid substrate and the liquid film, it is of prime importance to ensure good wetting of the surface. Flow and leveling agents are chemical compounds that increase a coating's mobility after application, thus enabling the process of leveling. They reduce the surface tension of the wet coating and, more importantly, maintain a uniform surface tension over the entire surface area. Leveling agents influence the surface forces thereby limiting or preventing flow defects such as pinholes, fisheyes, crawling, edge crawling, sagging etc. The wetting of the substrate and leveling of the liquid film depends on the surface tension of the coating.<br>
Dupont has developed a series of fluorosurfactants and fluoro-intermediates under the trade name of Zonyl®. Zonyl® (FSP and FSO) surfactants are recommended in coatings for improvement of flow and wetting. They also reduce surface defects such as craters, pinholes, orange peels, fish eyes and edge crawling.<br>

The products were analyzed for their hydroxyl value, molecular weight and molecular weight distribution by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The products were characterized by IR.<br>
Fluoride content of the resins was found by the following method;<br>
Known weight of the resin was mixed with the excess anhydrous sodium carbonate and heated at 800°C for 8hrs in the furnace. On cooling the incinerated product was dissolved in water and liquor ammonia was added to make the solution more basic and to avoid formation of gel-like solution. The content was then heated to boiling for 15 minutes. The content was cooled and calcium chloride (about 10% of the weight of the monomers) was added to convert sodium fluoride to calcium fluoride. The solution was filtered to separate the solid calcium fluoride. The product was incinerated at 750 C in the furnace for 4 hrs and weighed after cooling. From the amount of calcium fluoride formed fluorine<br>
12<br><br>
content was calculated after correcting for the solubility of calcium fluoride in aqueous solution (Solubility of CaF2 in water is 16mg / lit corresponding to lOmg / lit as fluoride). The theoretical fluorine content was calculated from the composition of the copolymer.<br>
The contact angle is the angle formed between the plane tangent to the surfaces of the solid and the liquid at the wetting perimeter. The advancing contact angle was measured using a Kruss G-10 contact angle measuring system under ambient conditions. For comparison contact angles of commercial surfactants Span-20, Span-80 and Brij-30 were measured under similar conditions.<br>
Testing of resins<br>
The resins were tested for their mechanical, optical properties as per ASTM standards . For testing the properties of coatings like corrosion protection, scratch hardness and falling weight impact resistance, mild steel panels of 15cm X 7.5cm were used. The panels were abraded with emery paper followed by cleaning with the solvent. The resins were cured with stoichiometric quantity of butylated melamine formaldehyde resin at 135°C for 15minutes. Since nonfluorinated resins showed nonwetting behaviour, 0.1% (w/w) of commercial urethane-based wetting agent WD 1070 (K-Tech India (P) Ltd., Thane) dissolved in methyl ethyl ketone was mixed with the resin solution for all the composition before applying on the panels by leveling technique. The solid content of the resin solution was maintained at 30% by diluting with cyclohexanone. Other properties like gloss, flexibility, Crosshatch adhesion; pencil harness and solvent resistance were tested on aluminium panels.

The properties of all the clear coatings are given above, it can be seen that properties like adhesion, gloss were more or less the same. MEK and xylene rub tests showed loss of gloss for both types of resins. The coatings showed good gloss. However the most<br>
15<br><br>
noticeable difference was observed in case of their corrosion protective ability. Fluorinated films showed better corrosion protection against corrosion than their nonfluorinated analogs. Addition of fluorine in a range 4 to 10% showed improvement of the protective properties significantly. Air-drying alkyd coatings cured on these fluorinated coatings could be peeled off from the surface thus making them suitable in anti-graffiti paints.<br>
Fluorinated polymers with lower molecular weight and lower fluorine content were prepared for use a surfactants by increasing the quantity of the initiator and reducing the quantity of TFPA for esterification of the hydroxyl groups. The prepolymers used here were also having a lower hydroxyl value.<br>
Fluoropolymer was prepared by adding 50 % solution of monomer in cyclohexanone in a three necked round bottom flask fitted with a water condenser and a teflon stirrer; adding 3% initiator Azoisobutyronitrile (AIBN) and 7 % 2-dodecyl mercaptan chain transfer agent to the above solution; carrying out the reaction at 75°C using water condenser; adding 100% moles of tetrafluoro propionic acid on hydroxy ethyl acrylate along with 1 % , p-toluene sulphonic acid (PTS A) catalyst concentration based on weight of acid and hydroxy component, carrying out esterification reaction at 120°C using cyclohexanone as an azeotropic solvent and achieving the fluorine content of the resins obtained was 5.1%.<br>
To improve some of the flow properties other monomers such as ethyl acrylate is also<br>
used.<br>

25<br><br>
•	An easy non hazardous and low cost procedure of introducing fluorine atoms in polymers. An easily available chemical, sodium tetrafluoro propionate was acidified with a mineral acid or ion exchanged to get an intermediate, tetrafluoro propanoic acid by extraction.<br>
