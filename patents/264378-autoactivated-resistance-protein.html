				<td>AUTOACTIVATED RESISTANCE PROTEIN<br>
The present invention concerns a nucleic acid which codes for an autoactivated resistance protein<br>
for generating a resistance to pathogens in plants, the use of the nucleic acid for producing a<br>
transgenic plant as well as transgenic plants.<br>
Plant diseases caused by fungi, virus, nematodes and bacteria cause large losses to harvest<br>
worldwide, compromise the quality of the harvested products and necessitate the costly and<br>
laborious application of chemical pesticides, since the natural defense mechanism of plants to<br>
fend against or delay and curb the spread the majority of potential pathogens frequently do not<br>
suffice. These defense mechanisms include hypersensitive reactions, the controlled cellular death<br>
of the host tissue at the infection site, the strengthening of the plant cell wall by lignification and<br>
callus formation, the formation of phytoalexins and the production of PR-(pathogenesis-related)<br>
proteins. The plant resistance genes (R-genes) are key molecules for the activation of the induced<br>
defense mechanisms. According to Flohr's gene-for-gene postulate the protein of an R-gene<br>
interacts with a corresponding protein of a microbial avirulence gene (Avr-gene) and thereby<br>
triggers the induced defensive reaction.<br>
The majority of the R-genes can be categorized into five classes corresponding to the structure of<br>
the R-proteins for which they code (Martin et al, 2003). Class 1 includes only the Pto-gene of the<br>
tomato, which codes for a serin/threonine-kinase. The majority of the plant R-genes however<br>
belong to the superfamily NBS-LRR-genes, which code for a "nucleotide biding site" (NBS) and<br>
a "leucine rich repeat" (LRR). NBS-LRR-genes which exhibit on their N-terminus a "coiled-<br>
coil"-structure (CC) such as, for example, a "leucine zipper", are categorized as CC-NBS-LRR-<br>
genes of Class 2. R-genes of CC-NBS-LRR-type are found in all angiosperms. Class 3 includes<br>
the R-genes of TIR-NBS-LRR-type, which carry on the N-terminus in place of a C-domain a<br>
sequence with homolgy to the animal TIR-region ("toll-interleukin-1-receptor"). Although the<br>
TIR-NBS-LRR-genes comprise approximately 75% of the R-genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, they<br>
are however not found in grasses nor in sugar beets (Tian et al., 2004).<br><br>
{WP439492;1}<br><br>
1<br><br>
The fourth class of the R-genes is formed by the Cf-gene of the tomato. CF-proteins have no<br>
NBS-domain, however a transmembrane domain (TM) and an extracellular LRR. The fifth class<br>
includes the Xa21 -protein from rice, which is constructed from an extracellular LRR-domain, a<br>
tansmembrane-domain and an intracellular kinase-domain.<br>
While R-genes are only weakly expressed by the R-gene promoters, a strong, consitutive<br>
expression of R-genes of Classes 1,2 and 3 results in an activation of the plant pathogen defense<br>
mechanism even in the absence of a corresponding avirulence gene product and therewith in<br>
autoactivation of the R-protein (Tang et al., 1999; Oldroyd and Staskawicz, 1998; Bendahmane<br>
et al., 2002).<br>
Generally however the constitutive overexpression of R-genes in transgenic plants is associated<br>
with agronomically undesired characteristics, such as micronecrosis (Tang et al., 1999) or<br>
dwarfism of the plants (Frost et al., 2004).<br>
A further possibility of the autoactivation of R-proteins of Classes 2 and 3 is the mutagenesis of<br>
special, conserved amino acid motifs in the complete CC-NBS-LRR or, as the case may be, TIR-<br>
NBS-LRR proetiens. The mutagenesis of sequences in the NBS- or, as the case may be, LRR<br>
domains of the Rx-gene of the potato (Bendahmane et al., 2002) and the NBS-domains of the<br>
L6-gene of flax (Howies et al., 2005) results in mutants, which, in the absence of the<br>
corresponding avirulence gene, after transient expression, initiate cell death.<br>
Deletion experiments with the Rx-gene show that deletion products comprised of the CC-<br>
domains and parts of the NBS-domain likewise can trigger a cell death after their transient<br>
overexpression, which occurs more rapidly than in the case of use of the full-length R-gene.<br>
These deletion products require, besides the CC-domains, also the P-loop, the kinase-2 and the<br>
complete kinase-3a of the NBS-domains. In contrast, a further shortening of the NBS-domain<br>
leads to a slower HR-triggering or initiation in comparison to the compete R-gene (Bendahmane<br>
et al. 2002).<br>
{WP439492;1}	2<br><br>
An autoactivation of the Ll0-gene of flax, a R-gene of Class 3, could be achieved by formation<br>
of a shortened TIR-NBS-LRR-protein, which was comprised of TIR-domains and 34 amino<br>
acids of the restricted NBS-domain inclusive of the P-loop (Frost et al., 2004).<br>
Although multiple methods of autoactivation of R-genes are known, until now no transgenic<br>
plants have been described in which the autoactivation of R-proteins leads to an elevated fungal<br>
resistance without simultaneously detracting from the agronomic characteristics. Attempts to<br>
stably transform two autoactivated full-length variants of the L6-gene respectively under the<br>
control of the native L6-resistance gene promoter or a fungus induced promoter in flax resulted<br>
either in normal growth fungal susceptible or to dwarf fungal resistant plants (Howels et al.,<br>
2005).<br>
It is thus the task of the present invention to so modify the defensive capability of a plant against<br>
pathogens, so that the defense reaction of the plant can be reliably activated following pathogen<br>
attack, without however negatively influencing the agronomic characteristics of the plants.<br>
In accordance with the invention the set task is solved by a nucleic acid, which includes a limited<br>
part of aNBS-LRR-resistance gene, which extends from the 5' end of the coded area of the NBS-<br>
LRR-resistance gene downstream to the beginning of the NBS-domain of the NBS-LRR-<br>
resistance gene, wherein the NBS-LRR-resistance gene is not a TIR-NBS-LRR resistance gene.<br>
Such nucleic acids can be isolated from plants or be produced synthetically.<br>
The limited part of the NBS-LRR-resistance gene begins at the start codon for translation (ATG-<br>
codon) and extends to the NBS-domains, which are basically characterized by the P-loop<br>
(kinase-la motif). For the function of the inventive part of the NBS-LRR-resistance gene, the P-<br>
loop shall not be included. Similarly, other sections of the NBS-LRR-domains of the NBS-LRR-<br>
resistance gene should also no longer be present. However, individual nucleotides of the NBS-<br>
domains inclusive of the P-loop may remain, as long as they do not interfere with the triggering<br>
of the HR.<br>
{WP439492;1}	3<br><br>
The term "autoactivated resistance protein" is understood to mean such a protein, which in the<br>
absence of a corresponding avirulence gene product leads to an activation to the plant pathogen<br>
defense mechanism. In relationship thereto the invention has the advantage that for formation of<br>
a resistance to pathogens no interaction between a resistance protein and an avirulence protein is<br>
necessary, whereby the defense reaction of the plant can proceeds substantially more directly and<br>
ultimately more reliably.<br>
An autoactivation can occur for example by a transient overexpression of the resistance gene.<br>
Overexpression means that the expression strength of the natural R-gene promoter is exceeded to<br>
the extent that the signal transduction cascade regulated by the R-protein is activated in the<br>
absence of the corresponding microbial avirulence gene product. Thereby, a pathogen defense<br>
mechanism is activated, which is manifested by a partial or complete disease resistance.<br>
An autoactivation of the resistance protein can however also be accomplished by shortening the<br>
full-length R-gene BvKWS3_165, BvKWS3_135, Bvl3033 and Bvl2069 of the sugar beat as<br>
well as the StR3a gene of the potato to the 5'- area which codes only for the NBS and LRR<br>
domain free N-terminus of the protein inclusive of a possible CC-domain. NBS-domain free N-<br>
terminus means in this case that the 5'-end of the coded area of the NBS-LRR-resistance gene<br>
extends only so far towards the 3'-end, that the P-loop of the NBS-LRR-resitance gene is not<br>
included in its effective or operative structure. In the simplest case the P-loop is completely<br>
deleted. However individual nucleotides of the P-loop can remain in the shortened resistance<br>
gene, to the extent that they do not slow or hinder the triggering of the HR. With the shortening<br>
of the NBS-LRR-resitance gene to the N-terminus, also the kinase 2-, kinase 3-, GLPC- and<br>
MHD-motif inlclusive of the flanking amino acids according to the information of the databank<br>
Prosite (Bairoch et al., 1996) and Pfam (Sonnhammer et al., 1997), as well as those motif<br>
definitions provided in Bendahmane at al. (2002), are eliminated or removed.<br>
The use of the shortened R-gene 165_#176, 135_#147, 13033_#159 and Bvl2069 and StR3a-#l-<br>
155 results, in comparison to the full-length R-gene, in a more rapid triggering of cell death in<br>
the plant tissue. In combination with a pathogen inducible promoter, an improved induced<br>
pathogen defense mechanism can therewith be induced. This applies also for those R-proteins,<br>
{WP439492;1}	4<br><br>
which cannot be autoactivated by known mutations in the MHD or, as the case may be, VHD<br>
domains, which show an expression of the gene 135_# 147 and BvKWS3_135-D480V.<br>
Since the shortened R-gene, in comparison to the full-length R-gene, is able to earlier trigger cell<br>
death, a smaller expression suffices for the shortened R-gene in order to achieve a critical protein<br>
concentration for the pathogen defense mechanism than has been shown for the R-gene<br>
135_#147.<br>
The P-loop or the kinase-1a motif is, together with the kinase-2 and kinase-3 motif, characteristic<br>
for ATP or GPT hydrolyzing proteins (Traut, 1994) and is located in the NBS-domains of NBS-<br>
LRR-genes. The P-loop characterizes the N-terminal area of the NBS-domain (Bendahmane et<br>
al., 2002). The consensus sequence of the P-loop for the R-gene Prf, Rx, Rpm1, BvKWS3_135,<br>
BvKWS3_133 and BvKWS3_165 is: (I/V)VG(M/I)GG(L/I/S)GKTT(L/V).<br>
In surprising manner it has been found, that a particularly good autoactivation is possible with<br>
nucleic acids which code for an amino acid sequence with a sequence motif DAE. In particular,<br>
the nucleic acids code for the sequence motif AVLXDAE. The sequence motif DAE and<br>
AVLXDAE are located for example in the SEQ ID NOS: 13 and 15.<br>
Preferred nucleic acid sequences are those from the following groups:<br>
a)	nucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO: 1 or a nucleotide sequence complimentary to<br>
the nucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO: 1 or a nucleotide sequence, which hybridizes<br>
with the  nucleotide  sequence  according to  SEC  ID NO:   1   or a nucleotide  sequence<br>
complimentary to the nucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO: 1;<br>
b)	nucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO: 2 or a nucleotide sequence complimentary to<br>
the nucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO: 2 or a nucleotide sequence, which hybridizes<br>
with the  nucleotide  sequence  according to  SEC  ID  NO:  2  or a nucleotide  sequence<br>
complimentary to the nucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO: 2;<br>
{WP439492;1}	5<br><br>
c)	nucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO: 3 or a nucleotide sequence complimentary to<br>
the nucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO: 3 or a nucleotide sequence, which hybridizes<br>
with the  nucleotide  sequence  according to  SEC  ID NO:  3  or  a nucleotide  sequence<br>
complimentary to the nucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO: 3;<br>
d)	nucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO: 4 or a nucleotide sequence complimentary to<br>
the nucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO: 4 or a nucleotide sequence, which hybridizes<br>
with the  nucleotide  sequence  according to  SEC  ID NO:  4  or a nucleotide  sequence<br>
complimentary to the nucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO: 4; and<br>
e)	nucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO: 16 or a nucleotide sequence complimentary to<br>
the nucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO: 16 or a nucleotide sequence, which hybridizes<br>
with the  nucleotide sequence  according to  SEC ID NO:   16 or a nucleotide  sequence<br>
complimentary to the nucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO: 16.<br>
The limited part of the NBS-LRR-resistance gene extends, in the preferred nucleotide gene<br>
sequences, as follows:<br>
SEQ ID NO: 1 from Pos. 124-654<br>
SEQ ID NO: 2 from Pos. 155-598<br>
SEQ ID NO: 3 from Pos. 94-573<br>
SEQ ID NO: 4 from Pos. 194-694<br>
The term "hybridized" as used herein means hybridizing under conventional conditions, as<br>
described in Sambrook et al. (1989) preferably under stringent conditions. Stringent<br>
hybridization conditions are for example: hybridizing in 4 x SSC at 65° C and subsequent<br>
multiple washing in 0.1 x SSC at 65° C for a total of approximately 1 hour. Less stringent<br>
hybridization conditions are for example: hybridizing in 4 x SSC at 37°C and subsequent<br>
multiple washing in 1 x SSC at room temperature. "Stringent hybridization conditions" can also<br>
mean: hybridizing at 68° C in 0.25 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 7 % SDS, 1 mM EDTA and 1<br>
% BSA for 16 hours and subsequently washing twice with 2 x SSC and 0.1 % SDS at 68° C.<br>
{WP439492;1}	6<br><br>
Preferably the resistance gene coding for an autoactivated resistance protein originated from<br>
sugar beat or potato.<br>
In a further preferred manner the inventive nucleic acid codes for an amino acid sequence with<br>
one of the consensus sequences according to SEQ ID NOS: 13 through 15. Within the consensus<br>
sequences functionally equivalent amino acids can be exchanged relative to each other, for<br>
example, Asp can be exchanged with Glu, Leu with Ile, Ala or Val, Arg with Lys, Phe with Trp.<br>
The two consensus sequences according to SEQ ID NOS: 13 and 14 represent two functional<br>
blocks, of which the separation is not a fixed distance. A preferred separation between both<br>
blocks can be seen in the consensus sequence according to SEQ ID NO: 15 as well as in the<br>
consensus sequence according to Fig. 10.<br>
The inventive nucleic acid is preferably combined with a pathogen inducible promoter. A<br>
pathogen inducible promoter is activated in reaction to the infection of the host tissue by a<br>
pathogen, for example a harmful fungi, a bacteria, a virus or a nematode. The pathogen inducible<br>
promoter is more active during the attempted or the successful infection of the plant tissue than<br>
in the non-infected plant tissue.<br>
Pathogen inducible promoters are well known to the person of ordinary skill in this art. Examples<br>
of pathogen inducible promoters include a chitinase promoter (Samac and Shah 1991), a<br>
glucanase promoter (Henning et al., 1993) and the prp-1 promoter (Martini et al., 1993).<br>
By the pathogen inducible overexpression of the R-gene, negative consequences of a constitutive<br>
expression, such as, for example, dwarfism or disfigurement of the plants, can be avoided.<br>
Synthetic promoters have demonstrated themselves to be particularly suitable promoters. These<br>
include promoters produced by molecular biological techniques, which are not found in nature in<br>
this design. One such synthetic promoter is a minimalistic promoter, which besides a minimal<br>
promoter contains only one or more selected, defined cis-elements. These cis-elements are<br>
{WP439492;1}	7<br><br>
bonding sites for DNA-bonding proteins such as transcription factors and are isolated from<br>
natural promoters, derived from already isolated cis-elements or produced technically by chance<br>
oriented recombination techniques and are selected using suitable or appropriate processes. In<br>
comparison to a natural promoter, a synthetic promoter is only activated by few exogenous and<br>
endogenous factors due to its less complex construction and is thus regulated with more<br>
specificity.<br>
The minimal promoter or "core" promoter is a nucleic acid sequence, which contains bonding<br>
sites for the basal transcription factor complex and enables the accurate initiation of transcription<br>
by the RNA-polymerase II. Characteristic sequence motifs of the minimal promoter are the<br>
TATA-box, the initiator element (Inr), the "TFBII recognition element" (BRE) and the<br>
"downstream core promoter element" (DPE). These elements can occur individually or in<br>
combinations in minimal promoters. The minimal promoter or its sequence motifs are obtainable<br>
from a generic plant or viral gene.<br>
In the framework of the present invention new synthetic promoters have been developed, which<br>
even in connection known resistance genes, which are not essential for coding for an<br>
autoactivated resistance protein, are usable for producing a pathogen resistant plant. These are<br>
promoters of type nxS-mxD-minimal promoters, nxW2-mxD-minimal promoters and nxGstl-<br>
mxD-minimal promoter, so that the synthetic promoter includes one or more of the following<br>
cis-element combinations:<br>
a)	a nxS-mxD-Box<br>
b)	a nxW2-mxD-Box<br>
c)	a nxGst1-mxD-Box<br>
(wherein n and m mean a natural number of 1... 10)<br>
The S-box (CAGCCACCAAAGAGGACCCAGAAT) with a nucleic acid sequnece of SEQ ID<br>
NO: 6, the W2-box (TTATTCAGCCATCAAAAGTTGACCAATAAT) with nucleotide<br>
sequence SEQ ID NO: 7, the D-box (TACAATTCAAACATTGTTCAAACAAGGAACC) with<br>
nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO: 8 and the Gst-box (TTCTAGCCACCAGATTTGACCAAAC)<br>
{WP439492;1}	8<br><br>
with the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO: 9 are described in Rushton et al., 2002 inclusive of<br>
the core sequences necessary for their functioning.<br>
The promoters differentiate themselves in their base activity, pathogen inducibility, activation<br>
kinetics, and promoter strength respectively depending upon element selection (nxS-mxD,<br>
nxW2-mxD or nxGst1-mxD), as shown for example for promoters with the cis-element<br>
combinations<br>
2xS-2xD with nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO: 10,<br>
2xW2-2xD with nucleotide sequence r SEQ ID NO: 11, and<br>
2xGstl-2xD with nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO: 12.<br>
The characteristics of a synthetic promoter can be modified by changing the number of cis-<br>
elements (n, m = 1...10) according to the requirements of the gene expression. The comparison of<br>
the promoter 2xS-2xD with the variants 2xS-4xD, 4xS-2xD and 4xS-4xD shows that the average<br>
promoter strength is increased by the use of tetramers in comparison to promoters constructed<br>
from dimers. Further, the pathogen inducibility increases from dimer-dimer promoter (2xS-2xD),<br>
beyond the tetramer-dimer and dimer-tetramer promoter (4xS-2xD, 4xS-2xD), to tetramer-<br>
tetramer promoter (4xS-4xD) at all measurement intervals. In parallel with the increase in<br>
promoter strength and pathogen inducibility, there results in the case of the described example<br>
also in an increase in the base activity of the tetramer containing promoters. This example shows<br>
that important promoter characteristics are also regulated by the number of the cis-elements and<br>
that for the respective technical translation or conversion optimal promoter variants can be<br>
produced and identified.<br>
Suitable results can however also be obtained with cis-element combinations, which represent<br>
derivatives of the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 11 or SEQ ID NO: 12 and<br>
posses characteristics comparable to the cis-element combination of SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID<br>
NO: 11 or SEQ ID NO: 12.<br>
{WP439492;1}	9<br><br>
The promoters 2xS-2xD-minimal promoter and 2xW2-2xD-minimal promoter were combined,<br>
by way of exemplification, with the four full-length R-genes BvKWS3_133, BvKWS3_123,<br>
BvKWS3_135 and BvKWS3_165, and transformed in sugar beets. A fungal resistance test of the<br>
transgenic plants with the most important injurious fungus to the sugar beet, Cercospora<br>
beticola, the cause of leaf spot disease, resulted in each construct in an improved fungal<br>
resistance, while the transgenic plants did not differ in their growth or other agronomic<br>
characteristics from the non-transgenic plants. These results show that it is basically possible,<br>
with use of a pathogen inducible promoter, to achieve an overexpression of cell death triggering<br>
R-gene and therewith an improved disease resistance, without causing a negative influence on<br>
plant development. By use of optimized promoter following selection of the most suitable<br>
number of cis-element repetitions the disease resistance can be even further improved.<br>
The present invention further concerns transgenic plants, which were transformed with the new<br>
nucleic acid construct, in particular sugar beet plants, part as well as seeds or genetic material of<br>
such plants, as well as use of the new nucleic acid construct for producing a transgenic plant.<br>
The invention will be described in greater detail in the following with reference to the figures<br>
and examples.<br>
The invention, described using sugar beets by way of example, can be easily translated to other<br>
agricultural plants from which resistance genes can be isolated.<br>
Figures<br>
Fig. 1 shows the map of the binary vector pER-35Sluci, which was used for the Agrobacterium<br>
tumefaciens induced transient expression of R-genes in sugar beet leaves. The vector carries a<br>
luciferase gene from Photinus pyralis interrupted by an intron, which cannot be expressed in A.<br>
tumefaciens.<br>
{WP439492;1}	10<br><br>
Fig. 2 shows the triggering of cell death in sugar beet leaves following transient expression of the<br>
R-gene BvKWS3_133 by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. While the transient expression of the<br>
construct pER-35Sluci leads to a strong reporter gene activity in beet leaves, the expression of<br>

measured.<br>

BvKWS3_123, BvKWS3_133 and BvKWS3_165 are under the control of the doubled 35S-<br>
promoter (d35S) and were cotransformed with the reporter gene construct p70S-luc. The reporter<br>
gene activity was measured 20 hours following transformation. By triggering a hypersensitive<br>
reaction the reported gene activity is reduced in comparison to the control (Empty vector<br>
pCaMV-2 and p70S-luc). Shown is the average value of three independent test repetitions with<br>

Examples<br>
Verification of initiation of rapid resistance reaction in sugar beet leaves by overexpression of<br>
the gene BvKWS3 133.<br>
The transient overexpression of the full-length cDNA clone of the gene BvKWS3_133 in sugar<br>
beet leaves by Agrobacterium tumefaciens triggers a rapid cell death without visible necrosis<br>
formation. The cDNA-clone BvkWS3_133was combined with the d35S promoter and inserted<br>
in the binary vector pER-34Sluci (Fig. 1). The resulting vector was given the designation<br>
pER133-34Sluci. The vector pER-34Sluci and pER133-34Sluci were transformed in the<br>
Agrobacterium strain C58C1 (An 1987). Positive agrobacteria were cultured for the transient<br>
expression in 50 ml LB-medium with 100 mg/ml spectinomycin and 20 µM acetosyringon for 4-<br>
5 hours. Subsequently, the bacteria were centrifuged and the precipitate was taken up in a<br>
solution of l0mM MgCl2, 10 mM MES, 100 µM acetosyringon and adjusted to a bacteria density<br>
of OD600-0.1. The bacteria suspension was allowed to rest for 2-3 hours and then injected into<br>
the leaves of old sugar beets with the aid of a 2.5 ml hypodermic needle via the underside of the<br>
leaf of 10 week old sugar beets. After incubation at 25°C in an incubator, the Photinus pyralis<br>
{WP439492;1}	13<br><br>
luciferase reporter gene activity was measured in the transformed leaves in the 1,2 and 3 days<br>
following inoculation. In addition, the luciferase activity was determined with the Luciferase<br>
Assay System (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) in a Sirius Luminometer (Berthold Detection<br>
System GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's specifications. For<br>
obtaining an enzyme suitable for the measurements, two leaf disks were stamped for each<br>
measurement interval. For each construct 8 measurement points were collected per measurement<br>
day. The leaf samples were homogenized in a mortise with addition of sea sand with the 10-fold<br>
volume (v/w) of Passive Lysis Buffer (PBL). The liquid supernatant was extracted and<br>
respectively 10 µl raw extract was employed for the Photinus-luciferase activity measurement.<br>
Sugar beet leaves which were transformed with the control construct pER-35Sluci, showed on<br>
day 1 a small and on 2 and 3 a luciferase activity of 124,000 or as the case may be 116,000<br>
RLU/mg of leave tissue. Beet leaves, which were transformed with the construct pER-34Sluci,<br>
showed an activity at all three measurement points which was greater than the MgCl2 inoculated<br>
leaves (Fig. 2). Thus, the transient expression of the cDNA clone BvKWS3_133 initiates a very<br>
rapid cell death in the inoculated beet leaves.<br>
The constitutive expression of the R-gene BvKW3_123, BvKWS3 133 and BvKWS3 165<br>
initiates a cell death in sugar beet leaves.<br>
The R-gene BvKWS3_133 as well as the R-gene BvKWS3_165 with the nucleotide sequence<br>
according to SEQ ID No. 5 and the R-gene BvKWS3_123 were combined with the doubled 35S<br>
promoter of the vecotr pCaMV-2 (Fig. 3). The resulting vectors carry the designation p70S-<br>
BvkWS3_133, p70S-bvKWS3_165 and p70S-BvKWS3-123. In order to verify the functionality<br>
of the R-genes, the constructs p70S-BvkWS3_133, p70S-bvKWS3_165 and p70S-BvKWS3-123<br>
were transiently expressed with the reporter gene vector p70S-luc in sugar beet leaves by<br>
biolistic transformation according to Schmidt et al. (2004). As a positive control, the empty<br>
vector pCaMV-2 was used in combination with the reporter gene vector P70S-luc. In contrast to<br>
Schmidt, et al. (2004), the use of a normalizing vector was dispensed with. The luciferase<br>
activity was determined with the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) 20<br>
hours after the transformation. The transformation experiments were repeated three times,<br>
wherein each experiment included nine test repetitions per construct.  The development of the<br>
{WP439492;1}	14<br><br>
average value from the three experiments showed that in comparison to the luciferase activity of<br>
the positive control (empty vector) set at 100%, the reporter gene activity for p70S-BvKWS3-<br>
133 only 37.7%, for p70S-BvKWS3_165 only 66% and for p70S-BvKWS3-123 only 68.7%<br>
(Fig. 4). The strong expression of the R-gene BVKWS3_133, BVKWS3_165 and<br>
BVKWS3_123 by the d35S promoter thus initiated cell death or as the case may be a<br>
hypersensitive reaction in one part of the transformed cells which prevented the co-expression of<br>
the simultaneously transformed reporter gene vector. Therewith it was shown that the strong<br>
expression of the three R-genes led to a cell death or, as the case a HR, in the absence of a<br>
corresponding avirulence gene product.<br>
The 5' area of the gene BVKWS3_165 triggers a more rapid cell death than the full-length cDNA<br>
clone BvKWS3 _165<br>
Beginning with full-length cDNA clone BvKWS3_165 with the nucleotide sequence according<br>
to SEQ ID No. 5 in the construct p70S-BvKWS3_165, the 51 area of the gene was amplified with<br>
the aid of the Pfu-Polymerase (Stratagene) with use of the primer S316<br>
(CTCGAGAATTCGAGCTCCACCGCGG)	and	S318<br>
(CTGGATCCTCACCTCCGTTCTTCATGTTGCTCTACC) and simultaneously a stop codon<br>
was introduced in the coded area. The amplified area corresponded to the nucleotide sequence<br>
according to SEQ ID No. 1 and encoded for the amino acid sequence 1-175 of BvKWS3_165<br>
(Fig. 10). The amino acid sequence included only the N-terminal area of BvKWS3_165 and<br>
contained no NBS and no LRR domains (Fig. 10). The PCR product was cleaved with the<br>
restriction enzymes SacII and BamHI and cloned in the voctor pCaMV-2. The resulting vector<br>
was given designation p70S-BvKWS3_#175. The ability of the construct P70S-BvKWS3_165<br>
and p70S-165_#175 to trigger a cell death in sugar beet leaves was tested quantitatively by<br>
transient biolistic transformation. For this, each vector was co-transformed with the reporter<br>
gene vector p70S-luc. As positive control the empty vector pCaMV-2 was used in combination<br>
with the reporter gene vector p-70S-luc. In comparison to transformation of the empty vector<br>
(pcAMV-2) the transformation of p70S-BvKWS3_165 resulted in 65% measurable reporter gene<br>
activity and the transformation of p70S-165-#175 resulted in only 38% measurable reporter gene<br>
activity (Fig. 5). This result showed that the exclusive expression of the 175 amino acid sized N-<br>
{WP439492;1}	15<br><br>
terminus of 165_#175 led to an intensive triggered of cell death in the transformed sugar beet<br>
leaves than the use of the 1066 amino acid sized full-length protein BvKWS3_165. By<br>
expression of 165_#175 more of the transformed leaf cells die off than in the case of the<br>
expression of BvKWS3_165. The cause for this difference is a new, more intensive form of the<br>
autoactivation of the R-protein by the shortening (contraction) at the N-terminus.<br>
The 5'-area of the gene BvKWS3_135 triggers a more rapid cell death than the full-length cDNA<br>
clone BvKWS3 135<br>
Beginning with full-length cDNA clone BvKWS3_135 in the construct p70S-BvKWS3_135 the<br>
5'-area of the gene was amplified with the aid of the Pfu-polymerase (Stratgene) with use of the<br>
primer	S316	(CTCGAGAATTCGAGCTCCACCGCGG)	and	S330<br>
(CTGGATCCTCACCTCCGTTCTTCATGTTGCTCTACC) and simultaneously a stop codon<br>
was introduced in the coded area. The amplified area corresponds to the nucleotide sequence<br>
according to SEQ ID NO. 2 and codes for the amino acid sequence 1-147 of BvKWS3_135 (Fig.<br>
10). The amino acid sequence includes only the N-terminal area of BvKWS3_135 and contains<br>
no NBS and no LRR domains or, as the case may be, motifs from these domains. The PCR<br>
product was cleaved with the restriction enzymes SacII and BamHI and cloned in the vector<br>
pCaMV-2. The resulting vector was given the designation p70S-135_#147. The ability of the<br>
construct p70S-BvKWS3_135 and p70S-135_#147 to trigger a cell death in sugar beet leaves<br>
was tested quantitatively by transient biolistic transformations. For this, each vector was co-<br>
transformed with the reporter gene vector p70S-luc. As positive control the empty vector<br>
pCaMV-2 was used in combination with the reporter gene vector p70S-luc. In comparison to<br>
transformation of the empty vector (pCaMV-2), the transformation of p70S-BvKWs3_135 led to<br>
74.5% measurable reporter gene activity and the transformation of p70S-135_#147 led to only<br>
58% measurable reporter gene activity (Fig. 6). The result showed that the expression of the<br>
full-length clone BvKWS3_135 led to triggering of cell death in the transformed tissue.<br>
However, the exclusive expression of the 147 amino acid sized N-terminus of 135_#147 brought<br>
about a more intensive cell death in the transformed sugar beet leaves than the use of the 844<br>
amino acid sized protein BvKWS3_135. By expression of 135_#147 more transformed leaf cells<br>
died than in the case of the expression of BvKWS3_135. The cause of this difference is a new,<br>
{WP439492;1}	16<br><br>
more intensive form of the autoactivation of the R-protein by the contraction or shortening at the<br>
N-terminus.<br>
The 5'-area of the gene Bvl30033 triggers a more rapid cell death than the full-length cDNA clone<br>
Bvl3033<br>
Beginning with full-length cDNA clone Bvl3033 in the construct p70S-Bvl3033 the 5'-area of<br>
the gene was amplified with the aid of the Pfu-polymerase (Stratagene) with use of the primer<br>
S316	(CTCGAGAATTCGAGCTCCACCGCGG)	and	S333<br>
(CTGGATCCTCACCTCCGTTCTTCATGTTGCTCTACC) and simultaneously a stop codon<br>
was introduced in the coded area. The amplified area corresponds to the nucleotide sequence<br>
according to SEQ ID No: 3 and codes for the amino acid sequence 1-159 of Bvl3033 (Fig. 10).<br>
The amino acid sequence includes only the N-terminus area of Bvl3033 and contains no NBS<br>
and no LRR domains or motifs from these domains. The PCR product was cleaved with the<br>
restriction enzymes SacII and BamHI and cloned in the vector pCaMV-2. The resulting vector<br>
was given the designation p70S-13033_#159. The ability of the construct p70S-13033 and<br>
p70S-13033_#159 to trigger a cell death in sugar beet leaves was tested quantitatively by<br>
transient biolistic transformations. For this, each vector was co-transformed with the reporter<br>
gene vector p70S-luc. As positive control the empty vector pCaMV-2 was used. In comparison<br>
to transformation of the empty vector (pCaMV-2), the transformation of p70S-13033 led to 95%<br>
measurable reporter gene activity and the transformation of p70S-165_#175 led to only 68%<br>
measurable reporter gene activity (Fig. 7). The results showed that the expression of the full-<br>
length clone Bvl3033 led to the triggering of only a weak cell death in the transformed tissue.<br>
The exclusive expression of the 159 amino acid sized N-terminus of 13033_#159 brought about<br>
on the other hand an intensive cell death in the transformed sugar beet leaves. The cause of this<br>
difference is a new, more intensive form of the auto-activation of the R-protein by the shortening<br>
at the N-terminus.<br>
Triggering of cell death in sugar beet leaves by the 5'-area of the gene Bvl2069<br>
{WP439492;1}	17<br><br>
The R-gene Bvl2069 with the nucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID No. 4 codes for the 166<br>
amino acid sized N-terminus of R-protein. The protein Bvl2069 contains no NBS and no LRR<br>
domains, however, evidences a distinct homology to the 175, 147 and 159 amino acid sized N-<br>
termini of the autoactivated R-proteins 165_#175, 135_#147, 13033_#159 (Fig. 10). The cDNA<br>
clone was combined with doubled 35S promoter of vector pCaMV-2 (Fig. 3) to form the vector<br>
p70S-12069. In order to check the functionality of the gene Bvl2069, the construct p70S-12069<br>
was expressed in combination with the reporter gene vector p70S-luc in sugar beet leaves<br>
transiently by biolistic transformation. The reporter gene activity in the leaves transformed with<br>
p70S-12069 and p70S-luc amounted in three independent tests to 51% of the activity which<br>
could be measured in the positive control (empty vector pCaMV-2 and p70S-luc) (Fig. 8). The<br>
expression of the 166 amino acid sized protein Bv 12069 therewith triggered a cell death in sugar<br>
beet cells.<br>
The shortening of the gene BvKWS3_135 results in an autoactivated R-protein, however not the<br>
mutagenesis of the MHD domains<br>
The inventive mechanism of the autoactivation by condensation of a R-protein of the NBS-LRR<br>
type to the NBS- and LRR free N-terminus was compared with the method of autoactivation by<br>
mutagenesis of the MHD motif. The mutagenesis of the MHD motif of the Rx-gene of the<br>
potato and the L5 gene of flax led to an autoactivation of the indicated gene (Bendahamane et al.,<br>
2002; Howes et al., 2005). The cDNA clone BvKWS3_135 does for the MHD motif equivalent<br>
to the VHD motif, a motif that besides the MHD motif is likewise frequently found is R-gene<br>
(Howies et al., 2005). The corresponding mutation was, as described in Bendahmane et al.<br>
(2002), introduced in the full-length clone BvKWS3_135. For this, the amino acid aspartate in<br>
the VHD motif of the gene BvKWS33_135 was exchanged with the amino acid valine. The<br>
resulting gene was given designation BVKW3_135_D480V. The effectiveness of the gene<br>
135_#147, BvKWS3_135_D408V and the non-modified gene BvKWS3_135 were tested by<br>
Agrobacterium tumefaciens initiated transient overexpression in sugar beet leaves. For this the<br>
cDNA clone BvKWS3_135 was combined with the d35S promoter and inserted in the binary<br>
vector pER-34Sluci. The resulting vector was given the designation pER135-34Sluci. Similarly<br>
there were processed the shortened cDNA clone 135_#147 with a nucleotide sequence according<br>
{WP439492;1}	18<br><br>
to SEQ ID No. 2 as well as with the mutantgenized cDNA clone BvKWS3_135_D408V. The<br>
resulting vectors were given designation pER135_#147-35Sluci and pER135_D480V-35Sluci.<br>
The vectors were transformed in Agrobacterium of strain or line C58C1 as described and<br>
injected in sugar beet leaves simultaneously with the control pER-35Sluci. The Photinuspyralis<br>
luciferase-reporter gene activity was measured 1, 2 and 3 days post inoculation in the<br>
transformed leaves. Sugar beet leaves, which were transformed with the control construct pER-<br>
35Sluci showed on day 1 a small and the 2nd and 3rd day a luciferase activity of 299,000 and<br>
433,000 RLU/mg leaf tissue. Beet leaves which were transformed with the construct pER135-<br>
35Sluci showed on day 2 and day 3 a luciferase activity of 190,000 and 245,000 RLU/mg leaf<br>
tissue and therewith, in comparison to the positive control pER-35Sluci, a measurable cell death.<br>
The reported gene activity of the construct pER_135_D480V-35Sluci amounted on day 2 and<br>
day 3 to 188,000 and 206,000 RLU/mg (Fig. 9). Accordingly the introduction of the MHD<br>
mutation in the gene BvKWS3_135 resulted in no, or a barely measurable, autoactivation. The<br>
R-gene 13 5_# 147 shortened in accordance with this process showed on day 2 and 3 a reporter<br>
gene activity of 90,000 and 63,000 RLU/mg (Fig. 9) and therewith a significantly stronger cell<br>
death initiation and autoactivation than the construct pER135-35Sluci and pER_135_D480V-<br>
35Sluci.<br>
Identification of common amino acid motifs in the N-termini of the R-protein of BvKWS3_165,<br>
BvKWS3_135, Bvl3033 and Bvl2069 und StR3a<br>
A homology comparison between the 175, 147, 159 und 166 amino acid sized N-termini of the<br>
R-proteins BvKWS3_165, BvKWS3_135, Bvl3033 and Bvl2069 and the 155 amino acid sized<br>
N-terminus of the R3a gene of the potato (Huang et el., 2005) was carried out in order to identify<br>
common sequence motifs. The comparison lead to the identification of multiple consensus<br>
sequences in the N-termini of the autoactivated R-protein. The common sequence motifs are<br>
highlighted as consensus sequences in Fig. 10a).<br>
{WP439492;1}	19<br><br>
One consensus sequence corresponds to the amino acid sequence according to SEQ ID NO: 13:<br>
AVLXDAEXKQXX XXXLXXWLXD LKDXVYDXDD ILDE. Another consensus sequence<br>
corresponds to the amino acid sequence according to SEQ ID NO: 14: IXEIXXKLDD L<br>
The letter X refers herein to any amino acid.<br>
Both consensus sequences in the described form are contained only in such N-termini of CC-NBS-LRR<br>
R-proteins in which the expression leads to an autoactivation. Thus, the 160 amino acid sized CC-domain<br>
of the RX-gene is not capable of initiating cell death or, as the case may be, a hypersensitive reaction<br>
(Bendahmane et al., 2002). The transient expression of the 177 amino acid sized N-terminus of the R-<br>
gene BvKWS3_133_e08 of sugar beet and the 540 amino acid sized N-terminus of the Rl gene of the<br>
potato (Ballvora et al., 2002) initiated in comparison to the full-length R-gene BvKWS3_133_e08 no<br>
amplified or, in the case of the Rl gene, no cell death (data not shown). The amino acid comparison of the<br>
N-termini of the autoactivated proteins BvKWS3_165_#176, BvKWS3J35_#147, Bvl3033_#159,<br>
Bvl2069 und StR3a-#l-155 with the amino acid sequences of the CC-domain of the Rx-, StRl- und<br>
BvKWS3_133_#177-protein show the absence of the above described consensus sequences in the not<br>
autoactivated N-termini (Fig. 10b). In particular the sequence motif DAE is an important aid of<br>
identification of R-proteins, of which the N-terminus is autoactive. With the aid of the sequence motif<br>
DAE in the consensus sequence sutiable R.-genes for an autoactivation can be found in numerous plant<br>
species, as shown in Fig. 10c for examples of Arabidopsis thaliana (AtAB028617), bean (PvulgarisJ71),<br>
rice (osativaAp003073), soy bean (GmaxKR4) und tomato (Tomato-I2).<br>
The amino acid sequence of 147-175 is important for the autoactivation of the R-protein 165 #175<br>
In order to identify the amino acid section in the protein 165_#175 which is important for the<br>
autoactivation of the N-terminus of NBS-LRR proteins, the encoding region of the cDNA clone<br>
165_#175 was shortened. The cDNA clones 165_#93 and 165_#146 coded for the amino acid 1-<br>
93 or as the case may be 1-146 of the protein 165_#175. The transient biolistic test of the<br>
constructs p70S_165_#93, p70S_165_#146 and p70S_165_#175 showed that only the protein<br>
165_#175, however not 165_#93 and 165_#146, triggered a strong cell death (Fig. 11).<br>
Accordingly the sequence region of 146-175 is essential for the autoactivation of NBS-LRR<br>
proteins. In this region there lies a sequence motif conserved in all examined proteins (Fig. 10a).<br>

Rapid activation of the synthetic pathogen inducible promoters 2xS-2xD and 2xW2-2xD by<br>
fungal infestation<br>
For the pathogen induced overexpression of complete or partial resistance genes, particularly<br>
suited are synthetic promoters of type nxS-mxD, nxW2-mxD and nxGstl-mxD, wherein n = 1,2,<br>
3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and m = 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8,9,10. For example, promoters of type 2xS-2xD<br>
according to SEQ ID NO. 10, 2xW2-2xD according to SEQ ID NO. 11 as well as 2xGstl-2xD<br>
according to SEQ ID NO. 12 were combined with the luciferase gene from Photinus pyralis,<br>
transformed in sugar beets and analyzed in reaction to fungal infestation.<br>
For the plant transformation the binary vectors 2xS-2xD-luc-kan, 2xW2-2xD-luc-kan, and<br>
2xGstl-2xD-luc-kan were found to be useful. The binary vectors were transformed in the<br>
Agrobacterium tumefaciens type C58C1 with the resident plasmid pGV2260 by a direct DNA-<br>
transformation process (An, 1987). The selection of recombinant A tumefaciens clones occurred<br>
using the antibiotic kanamycin (50mg/l).<br>
The transformation of the sugar beets occurred according io Lindsey et al. (1991) using the<br>
antibiotic kanamycin. The transgenecity of the plants was tested by PCR. The use of the primer<br>
GTGGAGAGGCTATTCGGTA and CCACCATGATATTCGGCAAG lead to the amplification<br>
of the 553 base pair sized DNA-fragment from the nprtl-gene. The PCR was carried out using 10<br>
ng genomic DNA, a primer concentration of 0.2 uM at an annealing temperature of 55° C in a<br>
Mutli-Cycler PTC-200 (MJ Reasearch, Watertown, USA).<br>
In order to analyze the pathogen inducibilty of the promoter, the transgenic sugar beets were<br>
infected under in-vitro conditions with a leaf spot inducer of sugar beets, Cercospora beticola.<br>
Respectively 4 plants of a transgenic line dipped in a suspension of C. beticola mycelium<br>
fragments (400,000 fragment/ml) and 4 plants were dipped for control purposes in dilute<br>
vegetable juice. Infected plants and control plants were subsequently incubated at 25° C and 16h<br>
illumination in a culture cabinet. Infected and non-infected leaf material was removed 1, 2, 3, 4<br>
and 6-7 days subsequent to the inocculation and the luciferase reporter gene activity was<br>
determined with the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) as described.<br>
{WP439492;1}	21<br><br>
Both the 2xS-2xD as well as the 2xW2-2xD promoter showed a rapid and strong pathogen<br>
inducibility in the early phase of the infection, differed however in base activity and promoter<br>
strength (Fig. 12-13). The 2xS-2xD-promotor was rapidly induced in the case of the transgenic<br>
lines PR39/11, PR39/48 and PR39/49, already 11-59 fold on the first day after inoculation and<br>
21-384 fold on the second day in comparison to the non-infected plants (Fig. 12). While day 1 is<br>
still characterized by a growth of the fungal hyphae on the epidermis, on day 2 there is a<br>
penetration of the leaves through the stomata and therewith a penetration into the leaf tissue. In<br>
the late phase of the infection at day 7, a 113-792 fold induction of the promoter was measured<br>
with a visible development of the necrosis. The base activity of the 2xS-2xD promoter measured<br>
as reported gene activity of the non-infected plats is very small and amounted to only the 1-10<br>
fold of the luciferase activity measurable in the non-transgenic plants.<br>
The activation of the 2xW2-2xD promoter progressed somewhat slower than that of the 2xS-2xD<br>
promoter. On the first infection day the 2xW2-2xD promoter exhibited only a 2-11 fold, and on<br>
the second infection day a 5-56 fold, pathogen induction. With the occurrence of the necrosis on<br>
day 7, a maximal 318-672 fold pathogen induction was achieved (Fig. 13). The base activity of<br>
the 2xW2-2-D promoter, having a 10-50 fold of reporter gene activity measurable in comparison<br>
to the non-transgenic plants, is higher than in the case of the 2xS-2xD promoter. Significantly the<br>
2xW2-2xD promoter exceeds the 2xS-2xD promoter by its approximately 10-fold higher<br>
promoter strength.<br>
Optimization of the promoter characteristics by changing the cis-element-number.<br>
The characteristic of a synthetic promoter of type nxS-mxD, nxW2-mxD and nxGstl-mxD with<br>
n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and m = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 can be modulated and optimized<br>
by variation of the number of the cis-elements according to the requirements of the gene<br>
expression. This is shown for illustrative purposes for the promoter type nxS-mxD. Besides the<br>
binary vector 2xS-2xD-luc-kan the binary vectors 4xS-2xD-luc-kan, 2xS-4xD-luc-kan and 4xS-<br>
{WP439492;1}	22<br><br>
4xD-luc-kan were constructed and transformed in sugar beets. The transgenic plants were<br>
infected with C. beticola as described and reporter gene activity was measured daily subsequent<br>
to fungal inoculation. The test results from 13 independent 2xS-2xD-luc lines, 14 independant<br>
4xS-2xD-luc lines, 15 independant 2xS-4xD-luc lines as well as 15 independent 4xS-4xD-luc<br>
lines were determined and the measurement values were compared in their promoter strength,<br>
pathogen induction and base activity.<br>
The comparison of the 2xS-2xD promoter characteristics with the variants 2xS-4xD, 4xS-2xD<br>
and 4xS-4xD showed that the average promoter strength was increased by the use of tetramers in<br>
comparison to the promoters constructed of dimers (Fig. 14). In addition, the pathogen<br>
inducibility of dimer-dimer promoter (2xS-2xD) climbed above the tetramer-dimer and dimer-<br>
tetramer promoters (4xS-2xD, 4xS-2xD) to the tetramer-tetramer promoter (4xS-4xD) at all<br>
measurement intervals (Table 1).<br><br>

controls. The base activity provides the behavior or relationship of the reporter gene activity of<br>
the transgenic plants in comparison to the non-specific background activity of non transgenic<br>

This example shows that the promoter characteristics important to the concept, such as promoter<br>
strength, pathogen inducibility and base activity, can be regulated by the number of the cis-<br>
elements and that optimal promoter variants can be created for the respective technical<br>
conversion. The optimal number of cis-elements of pathogen inducible promoters is, in the<br>
experimental example, with regard to the pathogen inducibility, greater than the dimer solution<br>
described by Rushton et al., 2002.<br>
Producing fungus resistant by transformation of the pathogen inducible resistance gene.<br>
{WP439492;1}	24<br><br>
For increasing the fungal resistance of sugar beets the promoters 2xS-2xD or, as the case may be,<br>
2xW2-2xD were respectively combined with the four R-genes BvKWS3_123, BvKWS3_133,<br>
BvKWS3_135 and BvKWS3_165 and transformed in sugar beets. Then the 13,959 or, as the<br>
case may be, 13,969 kb sized binary vectors 2xS-2xD-luc-kan and 2xW2-2xD-luc-kan were<br>
cleaved with Sacl and the cleaved locations were filled by T4-DNA polymerase treatment.<br>
Subsequently the vectors were re-sectioned with Xhol, electrophoretically separated and the<br>
12,284 or, as the case may be, 12,294 kb size vectors were separated from the 1,675 kb size<br>
luciferase gene and isolated.<br>
The isolation of the ZR resistance gene occurred from the vectors p70S-BvKWS3_123, p70S-<br>
BvKWS3_133, p70S-BvKWS3_135 and p70S-BvKWS3_165. For this, the vectors were first<br>
linearized with Notl and the cleavage points were filled by Klenow treatment. The vectors were<br>
then cut with Xhol and the R-gene isolated. The resulting vectors were given the designations<br>
2xS-2xD-BvKWS3_123, 2xS-2xD-BvKWS3_133, 2xS-2xD-BvKWS3_135 und 2xS-2xD-<br>
BvKWS3_165 or, as the case may be, 2xW2-2xD-BvKWS3_123, 2xW2-2xD-BvKWS3_133,<br>
2xW2-2xD-BvKWS3_135 and 2xW2-2xD-BvKWS3_165 (Fig. 15-18). The binary vectors were<br>
used as described for the production of transgenic sugar beets.<br>
Identification of fungal resistant sugar beets by resistance testing with plant pathogenic fungi<br>
Cercospora beticola.<br>
The elevated fungal resistance of the plants was observed in a fungal resistance test which is<br>
described in the following for exemplary purposes for the resistance testing for the sugar beet<br>
with respect to Cercospora beticola.<br>
For the infection of sugar beets with the leaf spot inducer C. beticola, use was made of, besides<br>
the transgenic plants, sugar beets of the genotype 3DC4156 used for the transformation, in a<br>
greenhouse. Two weeks prior to the plant inoculation vegetable juice plates (40% Albani-<br>
vegetable juice) were spiked with the aggressive C. beticola isolate Ahlburg and incubated at<br>
25°C. Directly prior to inoculation the agar with growing fungi is scratched off with the aid of an<br>
{WP439492;1}	25<br><br>
object carrier and some water. The concentration of mycellular fragments and fungal spores is<br>
determined using a counting cell chamber. The inoculum density is adjusted by dilution with<br>
water to a concentration of 20,000 fragments/ml. For infection the 10-12 week old plants were<br>
dipped inverted in a 5L glass beaker filled with the inoculum. Per line to be examined, 30 plants<br>
were inoculated and the plants were set up randomized in the greenhouse.<br>
The plants were incubated following inoculation for 4 days at 28°C and 95% humidity in a<br>
greenhouse. After the fourth day the humidity was reduced to 60-70%. Two, three and four<br>
weeks following inoculation the leaf drop is optically evaluated using the Kleinwanzlebener<br>
Saatzucht (KWS) rating scheme (1970) (l=healthy leaves, 9=100% destroyed leaves).<br>
Transgenic lines, which were transformed with the constructs 2xS-2xD-BvKWS3_123, 2xS-<br>
2xD-BvKWS3_133, 2xS-2xD-BvKWS3_165, 2xW2-2xD-BvKWS3_123, 2xW2-2xD-<br>
BvKWS3_133, 2xW2-2xD-BvKWS3_135 or 2xW2-2xD-BvKWS3_165, showed, in comparison<br>
the control, an elevated fungal resistance (Table 3).<br><br>

1	Third and last rating value of the resistance test (1= healthy, 9 = 100% damaged leaf surface).<br>
2	AUDPC (area under disease progress curve) value determined over 3 rating periods (T1-T3).<br>
The AUDPC encompasses the progression of the strength of infestation of multiple rating time<br>
points into a single value.<br>
The analysis of the time progression of the infestation development in the transformants PR68-6<br>
and PR70-32 over the three rating periods shows that with advance of experiment duration the<br>
difference in the infestation development between control and transgenic lines increases (Fig. 19<br>
and 20). These results show that the induced expression of different R-genes of the sugar beet<br>
leads, with the aid of the pathogen specific promoter, to an elevated fungal resistance.<br>
Producing fungal resistant plants by transformation of the N-terminal area of the R-gene under<br>
the control of pathogen responsive promoters.<br>
In order to produce fungal resistant plants with use of the N-terminal section of the R-gene, the<br>
condensed or shortened R-genes 13033_#159, 135_#147, 165_#175 and Bvl2069 were<br>
combined with the promoters 2xS-2xD and 2xW2-2xD and transformed in sugar beets.<br>
{WP439492;1}	27<br><br>
For this, the 13,959 or, as the case may be, 13,969 kb sized binary vectors 2xS-2xD-luc-kan and<br>
2xW2-2xD-luc-kan were cleaved with Sad and the cleavage points were filled by treatment with<br>
T4-DNA polymerase. Subsequently, the vectors were further cut with Xhol, gel-<br>
electrophoretically separated, and the 12,284 or, as the case may be, 12,294 kb size vectors were<br>
separated from the 1,675 size luciferase gene and isolated.<br>
The isolation of the shortened R-gene occurred from the vectors p70S-12069, p70S-13033_#159,<br>
p70S-135_#147 and p70S-165_#175. The vectors were first linearized with Xbal, the DNA ends<br>
were filled by Klenow treatment, and the vectors were further cut with Xhol. The isolated R-<br>
gene fragments were then cloned in the prepared binary vectors. The resulting vectors were<br>
given the designations 2xS-2xD-12069, 2xS-2xD-13033_#159, 2xS-2xD-135_#147, 2xS-2xD-<br>
165_#175 or, as the case may be, 2xW2-2xD-12069, 2xW2-2xD-13033_#159, 2xW2-2xD-<br>
135_#147, 2xW2-2xD-165_#175 (Fig. 21-22). The binary vectors were transformed as described<br>
in sugar beets and the fungal resistant plants were identified by a Cercospora beticola resistance<br>
test.<br><br>
