Conveyor belt control with force sensor<br>
The invention concerns a conveyor arrangement for shock-sensitive products, in particular for eggs, comprising: a conveyor apparatus for conveying the products, an intermediate storage region which is adapted to receive products which are to be put temporarily into intermediate storage by virtue of discontinuous feed or discharge, a control device for increasing the discharge and/or for reducing the feed of products into the intermediate storage region of the conveyor apparatus when a predetermined critical number of products is exceeded in the intermediate storage region.<br>
Such conveyor arrangements are used for example for transporting eggs away from a laying area and feeding them to a packaging station. That purpose is served by using in particular conveyor arrangements which include a transverse conveyor belt which conveys products to a processing station and a plurality of longitudinal conveyor belts which are so arranged that they convey products from various, mutually spaced locations onto the transverse conveyor belt. In that case the longitudinal conveyor belts extend along a row of henhouses or aviaries and are generally provided individually for each level or tier. The transverse conveyor belts are typically mounted at a right angle to the longitudinal conveyor belts which are disposed in parallel relationship, and receive the eggs which are transported by the longitudinal conveyor belts out of the laying areas.<br>
A first problem arising with such conveyor arrangements is that conveyance of the eggs on the longitudinal conveyor belts, which extends over a period of time, means that the feed of the eggs by way of the transverse conveyor belt to the processing station takes place discontinuously and in particular in an amount which is insufficient to make full use of the processing capacity of the processing station. To avoid that, it is known for a plurality of longitudinal conveyor belts to be simultaneously activated to supply the transverse conveyor belt with an adequate amount of eggs. A problem with that procedure however is that the spaced points of entry of the longitudinal conveyor belts means that the transverse   conveyor  belt  cannot   be   uniformly  fully   occupied   and   the<br><br>
transverse conveyor belt capacities are locally exceeded, which usually leads to damage to the eggs.<br>
A further problem with conveyor arrangements of that kind is that only low egg conveyor rates are achieved at the beginning of the conveyor operation and at the end thereof as an excessively low level of supply to the transverse conveyor belt occurs by virtue of starting up the first longitudinal conveyor belt and allowing the last longitudinal conveyor belt to run down. That prolongs the processing time at the processing station, which is disadvantageous for cost reasons.<br>
Particularly in relatively large henhouse installations it is often desirable for the eggs to be collected group-wise from given locations, for example because certain henhouses involve the administration of a different feed from other henhouses and the eggs produced in that way are to be supplied as an interrelated assembly to the processing station in order to be jointly processed, for example packaged. It is in precisely such situations where the egg collecting operation with for example up to 15 different groups takes place in succession however that it is not possible to achieve full utilisation at every time of the processing capacity of the processing station with the previously known measures of simultaneously switching on different longitudinal conveyor belts so that, in such situations of use, considerably longer operating times in the processing station and consequently longer collecting times and higher operating costs have to be tolerated.<br>
A further problem with such conveyor arrangements involves in particular keeping laying hens in an aviary in animal-friendly conditions. In such a situation the animals are provided with a nest in which the animals preferably lay their eggs. The eggs roll onto the longitudinal conveyor belt from the nest. However, the locally concentrated accumulation of the laid eggs results in overfilling of the longitudinal conveyor belt in the nest region, and that can lead to damage to the eggs. Whereas keeping the hens in cages leads to the laid eggs being distributed over the entire cage width and consequently one-off activation of the longitudinal conveyor belts per day would be sufficient to collect the laid eggs, it is necessary when<br><br>
keeping the birds in animal-friendly aviaries for the collecting operation to be carried out a number of times daily by virtue of local overfilling of the longitudinal conveyor belts.<br>
Yet a further problem with such conveyor arrangements is that a build-up can occur due to congestion or processing problems upstream of or in the processing station and as a result high forces can act on the eggs. To avoid that problem it is known to provide a limit switch which is actuated by the egg collection and which switches off the transverse conveyor belt when an inadmissibly high force occurs. However, in particular from the point of view that utilising the full capacity of the processing station is desirable and consequently a certain build-up upstream of the processing station is desired as a buffer, switching off the transverse conveyor belt in that way results in the transverse conveyor belt being very frequently switched on and off, and that can cause increased wear and premature failure.<br>
Finally a further problem with known conveyor apparatuses is that, when supplying products from a plurality of conveyor belts to a common collecting conveyor belt, damage to the products often occurs if the additionally supplied products firstly have to displace the products which are already on the collecting conveyor belt, and in that case unacceptably high forces are operative between the products. To avoid such damage it is known to provide product guide devices which are stationary fixed in position, relative to the movement of the collecting conveyor belt, and which guide the products already on the collecting conveyor belt upstream of the entry regions of further products in such a way that they are guided away from the entry region and space is thus made available for the products which are additionally arriving. Those product guide devices have to be regularly differently positioned and set in particular under changing delivery conditions, either due to delivery from different delivery conveyor belts or due to varying delivery conveyor quotas, and that makes handling thereof more difficult.<br><br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a conveyor arrangement which avoids one and preferably a plurality of the aforementioned problems.<br>
In accordance with the invention, in a first aspect, that is achieved in that there is provided a force measuring device which is adapted and arranged to detect a force which is exerted by the products disposed in the intermediate storage region and which represents a measurement of the number of products in the intermediate storage region, and the control device is adapted to process the force detected by the force measuring device as an input parameter and to increase or reduce the discharge and/or feed of the products from/to the intermediate storage region in dependence on the force value.<br>
The invention makes it possible for the first time to achieve differentiated actuation of the discharging and feeding conveyor apparatuses, in dependence on the force responsible for damage to the products. In that way filling of the intermediate storage region, that is sought to be achieved, for example to supply a processing station or to receive products from a product region, can be effected in a very much more specific and targeted fashion and it is thus possible to achieve an intermediate storage region filling effect without the frequent starting and stopping of the conveyor apparatus as is required in the state of the art.<br>
In that respect it is particularly preferred if the control device is adapted to actuate the conveyor apparatus at a first and a second conveyor speed, wherein the second speed is higher than the first speed. In that way it is possible to select a suitable speed in dependence on the force measurement value in order to increase or reduce the number of products in the intermediate storage region. Thus, upon a reduction in the detected force, the second speed can be selected while upon an increase in the detected force the first speed can be selected. Furthermore the first and second speeds can be set when the force values fall below or exceed predetermined force limit values.<br>
It is further preferred if the control device is adapted to adjust the conveyor  apparatus   preferably   steplessly   in   dependence   on  the  force<br><br>
detected by the force measuring device. Stepless control of the conveyor apparatus allows highly precise regulation of the number of products in the intermediate storage region or the force occurring there between the products.<br>
It is further preferred if the control device is adapted to reduce the feed of products to the. intermediate storage region and/or to increase the discharge from the intermediate storage region when a predetermined force value is exceeded. That provides for simple and reliable control or regulation of product conveyance.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the conveyor arrangement according to the invention the force measuring device is arranged beneath the products in the intermediate storage region in order to measure in a vertical direction and to detect the summed force due to weight of the products in the intermediate storage region. That development is suitable in particular for being used in the region of a nest when animals are being kept in an aviary situation. In that respect the force measuring device can be so arranged that it measures the force due to weight of the eggs on the longitudinal belt in the region of the nest and it causes a conveying movement on the part of the longitudinal conveyor belt when a predetermined force due to weight is exceeded in order to prevent a build¬up of the eggs.<br>
In that respect it is particularly preferred if the force measuring device is coupled to a horizontally arranged weighing plate arranged beneath a conveyor belt on which the products are arranged in the intermediate storage region. Weighing of all the products in the intermediate storage region is thus achieved in a reliable and structurally robust fashion.<br>
In particular it is preferable if the control device is adapted to actuate the conveyor apparatus from a stopped condition when a predetermined summed force due to weight of the products in the intermediate storage region is exceeded so that the products are further conveyed to such an extent that all products are conveyed out of the intermediate storage region.   In that way a conveying action, partial or complete, is implemented<br><br>
in dependence on the products in the intermediate storage region, and it is possible to avoid a build-up.<br>
It is particularly preferred if the conveyor apparatus includes a conveyor belt on which the intermediate storage region extends by a given length and the control device is so adapted that the conveyor belt is further conveyed by precisely the length of the intermediate storage region when a predetermined summed force due to the weight of the products in the intermediate storage region is exceeded. That development provides that the conveyor belt is advanced, upon complete filling of the intermediate storage region, only to such an extent that the subsequent filling of the conveyor belt occurs in a region directly adjoining the previously filled region and in that way complete filling of the longitudinal conveyor belt is progressively achieved over a large region.<br>
Thus in particular a development of the conveyor arrangement can provide that a plurality of mutually spaced intermediate storage regions are arranged along the conveyor belt and the control device is so adapted that when a predetermined summed force due to the weight of the products is first exceeded in an intermediate storage region the conveyor belt is further conveyed by the length of the intermediate storage means, when a predetermined summed force due to the weight of the products is subsequently exceeded in the intermediate storage region the conveyor belt is conveyed further once again by the length of the intermediate storage means, that procedure is optionally repeated up to a predetermined number of repetitions at which a portion of the conveyor belt occupied with products would be conveyed into an adjacent intermediate storage region and at which instead the conveyor belt is driven until the products are conveyed from the conveyor belt onto a second conveyor apparatus or into a storage space.<br>
In this embodiment when using the conveyor arrangement as a longitudinal conveyor belt, a multiple advance movement of the longitudinal conveyor belt is effected over a discrete advance distance which corresponds to the length of the intermediate storage region. In that way   adjacent  regions   on   the   longitudinal   conveyor   belt   are   filled   in<br><br>
succession in respect of time. As usually a plurality of nest regions are arranged along the longitudinal conveyor belt, then after a given number of such discrete advance movements, a longitudinal conveyor belt portion which is filled up by an adjacent nest region would be conveyed into the nest region of a juxtaposed aviary and in that case there would be the danger of a build-up of eggs occurring, as there is no longer any free longitudinal conveyor belt region available. Therefore at such a moment in time at which the longitudinal conveyor belt is typically completely filled, permanent activation of the longitudinal conveyor belt is implemented in order to convey the eggs into a storage space, for example onto a transverse conveyor belt.<br>
A further development of the conveyor arrangement can provide that a plurality of conveyor belts each having at least one respective intermediate storage region are arranged, that at least one intermediate storage region includes a force sensor for measuring the force due to the weight of the products in the intermediate storage region and the control device is so adapted that all conveyor belts are further conveyed by the length of the intermediate storage means when a predetermined summed force due to the weight of the products in that intermediate storage region is exceeded. That arrangement is suitable in particular for a plurality of henhouses and is based on the realisation that typically each aviary has a similar laying capacity so that it is sufficient if the laid eggs are weighed only in the region of the nest of an aviary and then all conveyor belts are advanced when a given value in that region is exceeded.<br>
A further development of that arrangement can provide that a plurality of conveyor belts each having at least one respective intermediate storage region are arranged, that at least a plurality of intermediate storage regions include a force sensor for measuring the force due to the weight of the products in the intermediate storage region and the control device is so adapted that all conveyor belts are further conveyed by the length of the intermediate storage means when the force due to the weight of the products in an intermediate storage region with force sensor or the mean   value   of  the   force   due  to   the   weight  of the   products   in   all<br><br>
intermediate storage regions with force sensor exceeds a predetermined force due to the weight of the products. With this embodiment a greater degree of security in relation to irregularities in the laying capacity is achieved insofar as the laid eggs of a plurality of aviaries are measured and then all longitudinal conveyor belts are advanced in dependence on those measurement values.<br>
In a second particularly preferred configuration of the conveyor arrangement according to the invention the force measuring device is coupled to a movable wall portion to detect the horizontal surface pressure exerted by the products on the movable wall portion as a pressing force on the movable portion. This development is suitable in particular for monitoring the eggs conveyed by the transverse conveyor belt in the region upstream of a packaging station and for avoiding damage to those eggs if build-ups occur in the packaging station. Detection of a differentiated pressing force allows precise control of the supply of eggs and avoids damage or frequently recurring stopping and starting of the transverse conveyor belt.<br>
In that respect it is particularly preferred if the force measuring device is coupled to a movable wall portion to detect the horizontal surface pressure exerted by the products on the movable wall portion as a pressing force on the movable portion. That development provides for precise measurement of the pressing force and thus generates an input parameter which is reliable for the control or regulating action. In that respect it is alternatively possible to provide a plurality of force measuring devices each having a respective movable wall portion which for example can lie laterally and in opposite relationship to the products which are being conveyed therethrough or which can also be arranged in the form of a measuring island in the flow of products.<br>
A further development in the embodiments with a horizontally measuring force sensor can provide that the movable wall portion has a first wall surface region which faces in opposite relationship to the feed conveyor device into the intermediate storage region and has a second wall surface region which faces parallel to the feed conveyor device.    It has<br><br>
been found that the provision of two such wall surface regions provides for detection, which is desirable in terms of ascertaining the actual product loading, of the conveyor force in the conveyor direction and the force produced thereby transversely with respect to the conveyor direction, which represents an input parameter directly related to the risk of product damage, for the regulating or control action.<br>
In that respect in particular the movable wall portion can be of a half-round shape. Thus a preferred structure is a half-round wall portion which is mounted pivotably at one end and spaced from that mounting is coupled to the force sensor and transmits a force to the sensor.<br>
In accordance with a second aspect of the invention, to avoid the above-discussed disadvantages of known conveyor arrangements, there is proposed a conveyor arrangement comprising: a conveyor apparatus for conveying the products, an intermediate storage region which is adapted to receive products which are to be put temporarily into intermediate storage by virtue of discontinuous feed or discharge, a control device for increasing the discharge and/or for reducing the feed of products into the intermediate storage region of the conveyor apparatus when a predetermined critical number of products is exceeded in the intermediate storage region, wherein the conveyor arrangement is distinguished in that arranged in the intermediate storage region is a measuring device which is adapted and arranged to detect the number of products standing up in the intermediate storage region and which represents a measurement of the horizontal force between the products in the intermediate storage region, and the control device is adapted to process the number detected by the measuring device as an input parameter and to increase or reduce the discharge and/or feed of the products from/to the intermediate storage region in dependence thereon.<br>
This variant of the invention represents an alternative for direct measurement of the force in the intermediate storage region and is based on the realisation that the products accumulated in the intermediate storage region, when a given horizontal pressing force among each other is exceeded,   have  a  tendency  to  stand   up  or  be  arranged   in   mutually<br><br>
superposed relationship in the intermediate storage region. The number of the products which project in that way beyond the products which are lying flat on the base surface of the intermediate storage region, whether that occurs by virtue of the products standing up or by virtue of their being supported on a subjacent product, is a measurement of the magnitude of the horizontal forces between the products in the intermediate storage region and can therefore be used an input parameter for the control device. That conveyor arrangement is suitable in particular for conveying eggs which typically, when an increased conveyor pressure is involved, tend to stand up and accordingly afford a reliable indication in the form of a plurality of eggs standing on their rounded ends, when a predetermined critical horizontal force has been exceeded.<br>
In that way the conveyor arrangement can be used in the same fashion as previously for effecting stepless transverse belt regulation which can be regulated in dependence on the number of products which are standing up in the intermediate storage region, in a closed regulating circuit.<br>
The measuring device can be for example in the form of a plurality of light barrier arrangements which measure horizontally over the products which are lying flat in the intermediate storage region, wherein preferably mutually crossing light paths are used in order to ensure coverage and detection over the area involved.<br>
It is further preferred if the intermediate storage region is arranged in the transfer region between a first feeding conveyor apparatus and a second discharging conveyor apparatus and the control device is so adapted that when a predetermined pressing force between the products or the number of products standing up in the intermediate storage region is exceeded the conveyor rate of the feeding conveyor apparatus is reduced and/or the conveyor rate of the discharging conveyor apparatus is increased.<br>
In that respect the predetermined pressing force or the number of products which are standing up is selected for example in dependence on the pressure sensitivity of the products being conveyed and can be stored<br><br>
in table form for typical conveyed products in a memory of the control device or can be inputted by the user of the conveyor arrangement by way of an operating unit.<br>
It is further preferred if the conveyor rate of the conveyor apparatus or apparatuses can be altered by a preferably stepless alteration in the conveyor speed. A stepless change in the conveyor speed, for example by means of frequency converters and electric drive motors for conveyor belts or bar belt conveyors makes it possible to achieve particularly precise regulation of the conveyor apparatuses in a closed regulating circuit and on the one hand that reliably avoids damage to the products while on the other hand ensuring that the products are permanently held in readiness in the intermediate storage region.<br>
In accordance with the invention, to avoid the above-mentioned disadvantages there is further proposed a conveyor arrangement comprising: a transverse conveyor belt which conveys products to a processing station, and a plurality of longitudinal conveyor belts which are so arranged that they convey products onto the transverse conveyor belt at various, mutually spaced locations, wherein a development of the conveyor arrangement provides a device for detecting the conveyor advance of the transverse conveyor belt and a regulating device which is coupled to said device and which is adapted at the beginning of a conveyor operation of the conveyor arrangement to set the longitudinal conveyor belts in operation in time-displaced relationship in dependence on the spacing between the entry point thereof onto the transverse conveyor belt and the processing station and in dependence on the conveyor advance of the transverse conveyor belt.<br>
Such conveyor arrangements are used for example to collect the products from production units which are distributed over a large area and convey them to a common processing station. For that purpose there are typically provided a plurality of longitudinal conveyor belts which are arranged parallel and in displaced relationship with each other and which meet the common transverse conveyor belt at mutually spaced points and convey the products onto the transverse conveyor belt.    A problem with<br><br>
such conveyor arrangements is in particular that, in discontinuous operation of the longitudinal conveyor belts, a discontinuous feed of the products to the processing station is also achieved and moreover, due to the spatial arrangement involved, full utilisation of the capacity of the processing station and the conveyor capacity of the transverse conveyor belt, which is typically matched to that capacity of the processing station, is not possible. The aforementioned aspect of the invention remedies that disadvantage insofar as the conveyor advance of the transverse conveyor belt is detected, for example by means of a synchronising timing means, and a regulating device is used, which regulates the discontinuous activation of the longitudinal conveyor belts on the basis of the conveyor advance and the arrangement of the points of entry of the longitudinal conveyor belts onto the transverse conveyor belt. That regulation can involve on the one hand activation of the longitudinal conveyor belts (binary regulation) or regulation of the conveyor speed of the longitudinal conveyor belts. It is typically possible in that way to implement time-displaced actuation of the longitudinal conveyor belts in such a fashion that the products are conveyed in a closed front and making full use of the capacity of the transverse conveyor belt and consequently the capacity of the processing station is also fully utilised and in addition, in a situation involving diminishing conveyance of products from an individual longitudinal conveyor belt, another longitudinal conveyor belt or the other longitudinal conveyor belts can be increased in their conveying action in order to compensate for that and to initiate compensation in positionally resolved relationship to the transverse conveyor belt at the location at which the deficit has occurred. The regulation of the conveyor arrangement which is proposed in that way makes it possible for the first time to fully utilise the capacity of the processing station in any operating state and in that respect to be able to incorporate interruptions in the transverse conveyor belt and fluctuations in the conveyor efficiency of the longitudinal conveyor belts into the regulating and control procedures.<br>
In   particular that  conveyor arrangement  can   be  combined  with counting devices for the products, which are arranged at the points of entry<br><br>
of the longitudinal conveyor belts onto the transverse conveyor belt and which detect and count the products which are delivered from each individual longitudinal conveyor belt. The degree of precision of regulation can be further increased by exploiting the numerical data ascertained in that way.<br>
It is particularly preferred for a development of the above-described conveyor arrangement to provide that the regulating device is adapted to first set in operation a first longitudinal conveyor belt which is most remote from the processing station and to set in operation a second conveyor belt arranged closer to the processing station at a time at which the transverse conveyor belt has advanced to such an extent that the products delivered by the first longitudinal conveyor belt have reached the entry region of the second longitudinal conveyor belt. That development provides that, after a stoppage of the installation, in particular after the conveyor arrangement has become completely empty, the transverse conveyor belt is loaded from the plurality of longitudinal conveyor belts in such a way as to avoid only isolated products being arranged over a longer transverse conveyor belt portion, but instead providing that a front of loaded-on products involving the full capacity of the processing station is formed on the transverse conveyor belt, whereby full utilisation of the processing station can be implemented at a predeterminable moment in time. That is for example highly advantageous when using egg collection from a plurality of locations in order to feed the egg production locations which are spaced from each other in respect of location to a packaging station in such a way that the packaging station can be operated in the fully utilised condition when the operating personnel start work.<br>
Furthermore, in the aforementioned conveyor arrangements, it is advantageous if at least two groups of longitudinal conveyor belts are defined and the regulating device is adapted to arrange the products of the longitudinal conveyor belts of a first group on the transverse conveyor belt before the products of the longitudinal conveyor belts of a second group. It is often desirable for conveyor arrangements to be operated in such a way that the products are jointly collected in from given regions, in particular a<br><br>
plurality of mutually spaced regions, and it is only after that collecting operation that the products are collected in from other, again a plurality of, mutually spaced regions. In that way two or more groups of production regions can be defined, from which products are collected in succession in respect of time. Ensuring permanent utilisation of the capacity of the processing station cannot be achieved precisely with such collection strategies when using conveyor arrangements in accordance with the state of the art. The conveyor arrangement according to the invention now makes it possible for the first time also to implement such group-wise collection and in that situation to achieve permanent full utilisation of the capacity of the processing station, by virtue of regulation of the longitudinal conveyor belts in dependence on their point of entry and in dependence on the transverse belt advance. In that case, operation is based on the principle, just as in the case of joint collection and processing of all production regions, of feeding the production regions of a group to the transverse conveyor belt by way of the corresponding longitudinal conveyor belts in such a way that a closed front is formed using the full processing capacity and after complete collection of the group the next closed front of the next group is formed immediately behind the end of the preceding group, and so forth.<br>
In that respect it is particularly preferred if the regulating device is adapted to actuate in each group firstly the longitudinal conveyor belt most remote from the processing station. That again provides that the groups achieve full levels of utilisation of the capacity of the processing station, in themselves, and longer lagging of the transverse conveyor belt, at a low level of utilisation of the capacity involved, is avoided.<br>
It is further preferred if the regulating device is adapted to actuate the longitudinal conveyor belts of the group with the longitudinal conveyor belt most remote from the processing station, as the last group. That has turned out to be advantageous as otherwise there would be a major gap on the transverse conveyor belt, which would interfere with full utilisation of the processing station, if for example one of the front longitudinal conveyor belts in a front group is collected and following that the last longitudinal<br><br>
conveyor belt is actuated, whereby the transverse conveyor belt remains product-free over a length corresponding to the distance between the front and last longitudinal conveyor belts. As an alternative thereto the longitudinal conveyor belt most remote from the processing station in the last group could be activated and that activation could occur a predetermined period of time prior to termination of the activation of the last longitudinal conveyor belt of the previous group. In that case the conveyor end of the previous group is predicted and the most remote longitudinal conveyor belt started in such a way as to avoid a gap between the two groups.<br>
Group-wise collection can be further optimised if the regulating device is adapted to determine the moment of stopping the last longitudinal conveyor belt of a group and activating the first longitudinal conveyor belt of a subsequent group in dependence on the spacing between the point of entry of the last longitudinal conveyor belt and the first longitudinal conveyor belt on the transverse conveyor belt, and the transverse conveyor belt advance. With that development it is possible for the regulating device to leave between two groups a defined - positive or negative - spacing, by stopping and starting of the corresponding longitudinal conveyor belts being controlled in such a way that the groups specifically overlap or do not overlap or are at a given spacing from each other.<br>
It is in that case particularly preferred if the regulating device is adapted to stop the longitudinal conveyor belts and the transverse conveyor belt when the last product of a group has been conveyed into the processing apparatus. In that way, the regulating device affords the possibility of implementing conversion at the processing station, in order to process products of different groups in different ways. In that respect the last product of a group or the first product of a following group can be referred to as a criterion for initiating stopping of the transverse conveyor belt.<br>
It is further preferred if the regulating device is adapted to determine the times such that the last products of the last longitudinal conveyor belt of the first group and the first products of the first longitudinal conveyor<br><br>
belt of the second group are deposited on the transverse conveyor belt in a joint mixed region. That produces a mixed region which for example contains products of different quality levels and in the processing of which therefore it is necessary to accept that products of a higher quality level are sorted into a packaging which is classified with a lower quality level. With this development however it is possible to achieve the advantage that the capacity of the processing station is fully utilised without interruption and a fluent change takes place between the products in the first and second groups. In that case the mixed region is treated in the processing station like the group with the products of the lower quality and accordingly prior to or after the beginning of the mixed region conversion of the processing mode involved is effected at the processing station, depending on whether the products are worse or better from one group to another in terms of their quality.<br>
Finally it is also preferred if, in group-wise collection of the products, the regulating device is adapted to determine the times of starting and stopping the longitudinal conveyor belts of the successive groups in such a way that an intermediate space is produced on the transverse conveyor belt between the products of the first group and the second group. In that way a period of time for conversion of the processing station can be afforded without interrupting the conveyor procedure.<br>
The conveyor arrangement according to the invention can be in particular so designed that the regulating device is adapted to activate so many longitudinal conveyor belts and/or to regulate the conveyor speed of the activated longitudinal conveyor belts in such a way that so many products are fed to each region of the transverse conveyor belt that a predetermined capacity of the processing station is achieved. In that way full utilisation of the capacity of the processing station is achieved by activation and/or speed regulation of the longitudinal conveyor belts, at any moment in time.<br>
It is further preferred if the regulating device is adapted to allocate a fraction of the transverse conveyor belt width to each activated longitudinal conveyor belt and to regulate the conveyor speed of each longitudinal<br><br>
conveyor belt in such a way that the respectively allocated width of the transverse conveyor belt is filled up with products by the respective longitudinal conveyor belt. That allocation means that each individual longitudinal conveyor belt can be regulated in respect of the conveyor capacity in such a way that the fraction of the transverse conveyor belt width, that is allocated thereto, is fully utilised. That makes it possible for longitudinal conveyor belts which are to be emptied in a particularly rapid manner to be provided with a large fraction of the transverse conveyor belt width and therefore to preferably collect products therefrom and longitudinal conveyor belts which are to be collected in over a longer period of time to be provided with only a small fraction of the transverse conveyor belt width in order to implement correspondingly slow collection.<br>
In particular in that respect it is preferable if each longitudinal conveyor belt pre-stores a given number of products and the regulating device is coupled to sensors for detecting the products still stored on each longitudinal conveyor belt and is adapted to allocate to a longitudinal conveyor belt with few products a smaller fraction of the transverse conveyor belt width than is allocated to a longitudinal conveyor belt with more products in order to provide that emptying of all longitudinal conveyor belts is terminated at the same time or in time-displaced relationship by a given amount. This development of the invention provides that, besides full utilisation of the capacity of the processing station from the beginning of the conveyor operation, which is possible with the conveyor arrangement according to the invention, the arrangement also provides for full utilisation of the processing station up to the end of the conveyor operation. The sensors for detecting the products still stored on each longitudinal conveyor belt can in that case in a simple version comprise travel sensors which detect the conveyor belt advance of the longitudinal conveyor belt. An improved version is achieved by additionally ascertaining the product density on the longitudinal conveyor belt, for example by counting the products at the discharge. Particularly if sensors for detecting the force due to the weight of the products of the above-described kind are installed,<br><br>
it is possible to infer the total eggs disposed on the longitudinal conveyor belt, from the measured weights.<br>
A typical problem with conveyor arrangements in the state of the art is that the longitudinal conveyor belts have different amounts of products in readiness and as a result longitudinal conveyor belts which have more products in readiness than others must still lag behind after termination of the conveyor operation of all other longitudinal conveyor belts, and as a result an only small amount of products is delivered onto the transverse conveyor belt from the individual longitudinal conveyor belt which is still continuing to convey products, and by virtue of that small amount the processing station cannot be utilised to its full capacity over a prolonged period of time. That causes time-intensive rectification at the processing station. With the development according to the invention it is possible for a large fraction of the transverse conveyor belt width to be allocated to such longitudinal conveyor belts whereby the longitudinal conveyor belts with a larger number of products can be emptied as quickly as the other longitudinal conveyor belts. In that respect the regulating device according to the invention permits dynamic regulation of the respectively allocated transverse conveyor belt widths, that is to say as soon as a greater transverse conveyor belt width is allocated to a longitudinal conveyor belt which is entirely filled the transverse conveyor belt width of the other longitudinal conveyor belts is dynamically reduced to such a degree that in total the proportion attributed to the one longitudinal conveyor belt is attained. The aim of modified regulation of that kind is to operate the processing station at full capacity up to the end of the processing operation and to avoid the processing station lagging behind for isolated subsequently delivered products, at a low level of utilisation of its capacity. For that purpose it will typically be necessary to stop the longitudinal conveyor belts in time-displaced relationship as the longitudinal conveyor belts which are closest to the processing station have to be stopped last and the most remote longitudinal conveyor belt has to be stopped first in order to achieve the desired abrupt termination of product accumulation on the transverse conveyor belt.<br><br>
It is particularly preferred if the regulating device is coupled to a force sensor arranged at the exit region of the transverse force conveyor belt or a counting sensor of the above-described kind and is adapted to regulate the conveyor speed of the transverse conveyor belt in dependence on the sensor signal.<br>
Implementation of such a force sensor, in particular in conjunction with the conveyor arrangement according to the invention with a regulating device, permits reliable, comfortable and convenient regulation as the variation in the conveyor speed of the transverse conveyor belt, that is caused by virtue of the force sensor, is incorporated into the regulation action in the form of the transverse conveyor belt advance and can thus be taken into consideration. In other words, for the first time it is possible with the conveyor arrangement according to the invention to achieve full utilisation of the processing station at any time in the conveyor operation and in that case to avoid repeated starting and stopping of the transverse conveyor belt, insofar as stepless regulation of the transverse conveyor belt is effected and at the same time the width of the transverse conveyor belt is filled up with products from the longitudinal conveyor belts completely at any time and at any location on the transverse conveyor belt.<br>
Finally a further development of the conveyor arrangement according to the invention can provide a display device which is coupled to the regulating device to obtain from the regulating device signals for positionally resolved representation of the number of products on the transverse conveyor belt. The display device which is provided in that fashion makes it possible for a user of the conveyor arrangement to recognise full utilisation of the individual conveyor belt lines and the processing station at a glance and - if necessary - to modify and optimise the regulating procedures by means of parameter selection.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the invention there is proposed a conveyor arrangement comprising a transverse conveyor belt and a plurality of longitudinal conveyor belts leading onto the transverse conveyor belt, with at least one movable product guide device which is arranged above the transverse conveyor belt and which is coupled to an<br><br>
actuator, wherein the actuator can move the product guide device into at least two positions into the support region of the transverse conveyor belt and the product guide device is laterally placed on the transverse conveyor belt in such a way that it guides the products on the transverse conveyor belt away from the entry region of at least one longitudinal conveyor belt. With that conveyor arrangement it is possible to avoid damage because of a collision between products which are already on the transverse conveyor belt with products which are arriving from the longitudinal conveyor belt. The actuator can be actuated electrically, pneumatically, hydraulically or in another fashion. The product guide device can be a pivotably mounted plate.<br>
In that respect it is particularly preferred if there are provided a plurality of movable product guide devices which are respectively arranged upstream of the entry regions of a plurality of longitudinal conveyor belts in the conveyor direction of the transverse conveyor belt. That development permits variable product guidance in dependence on the conveyor state and the activated longitudinal conveyor belts.<br>
It is further preferred if the actuator of each product guide device is coupled to a central control device and is actuated in dependence on the degree of filling of the transverse conveyor belt that is calculated by the control device from supplied products and transverse belt advance upstream of the respective product guide device in order to guide the products away from the entry region of the longitudinal conveyor belts to the degree permitted by the degree of filling. It is possible in that way to prevent the products being damaged or laterally pushed away by the transverse conveyor belt. The product guide device can be so set that the maximum possible deflection is achieved or only a fraction thereof, for example a deflection which is precisely sufficiently to provide space on the transverse conveyor belt for the products which are still to be added thereto.<br>
In addition, in the situation involving group-wise collection, it is preferable if the actuator of each product guide device is actuated in dependence on the collected group.    Pre-programmed actuator actuation<br><br>
can be effected in that way and can be set in group-dependent relationship when the respective group is collected in.<br>
The above-described conveyor arrangement according to the invention is preferably used for conveying eggs on a longitudinal conveyor belt on which a plurality of mutually spaced, stationary intermediate storage regions is provided, which are so arranged that they receive the eggs laid in nest regions in cages arranged in a row along the longitudinal belt.<br>
The above-described conveyor arrangement according to the invention can further be used for conveying eggs on a transverse conveyor belt in order to convey eggs into an intermediate storage region which is arranged in the conveyor direction upstream of an installation for further processing, in particular a packaging installation.<br>
The conveyor arrangement according to the invention is preferably operated with a method of conveying eggs in the region of a henhouse comprising a plurality of cage units, comprising the steps:<br>
a.	intermediate storage of the eggs laid in a first nest region of a<br>
cage or in a first cage on a first intermediate storage region of a stationary<br>
conveyor belt,<br>
b.	measuring the summed force due to weight of the eggs in the first<br>
intermediate storage region,<br>
c.	further conveyance of the longitudinal conveyor belt by a<br>
predetermined distance which is such that a conveyor belt portion which is<br>
not occupied with eggs is provided as a first intermediate storage region,<br>
d.	repetition of steps a to c up to a time at which further conveyance<br>
of the longitudinal conveyor belt by the predetermined distance would<br>
provide a conveyor belt portion already occupied with eggs due to an<br>
adjacent second intermediate storage region of a nest region of an adjacent<br>
second cage or a second cage, as the first intermediate storage region, and<br>
e.	further conveyance of the conveyor belt until the eggs deposited<br>
thereon have been transferred completely onto a second conveyor belt or<br>
into a storage means.<br><br>
In addition it is preferred if the above-described conveyor arrangement is operated with a method of conveying eggs comprising the steps:<br>
a. conveying the eggs on a first conveyor apparatus into an intermediate storage region,<br>
bl. measuring the summed pressing force exerted by the eggs on a lateral boundary wall portion of the intermediate storage region, or<br>
b2. measuring the eggs standing up in the intermediate storage region,<br>
c.	further conveying the eggs out of the intermediate storage region<br>
by means of a second conveyor apparatus, and<br>
d.	regulating the conveyor speed of the first or second conveyor<br>
apparatus in dependence on the measured pressing force or the measured<br>
number of eggs standing up.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect the conveyor arrangement according to the invention can be operated with a method comprising the steps: conveying products on a transverse conveyor belt to a processing station, and delivering products by means of a plurality of longitudinal conveyor belts onto the transverse conveyor belt at various, mutually spaced locations, wherein the conveyor advance of the transverse conveyor belt is detected and at the beginning of the conveyor operation the longitudinal conveyor belts are set in operation in time-displaced relationship in dependence on the spacing between their point of entry onto the transverse conveyor belt and the processing station and in dependence on the conveyor advance of the transverse conveyor belt.<br>
It is preferred if the first longitudinal conveyor belt most remote from the processing station is set in operation first and a second conveyor belt arranged closer to the processing station is set in operation at a time at which the transverse conveyor belt has advanced to such an extent that the products conveyed by the first longitudinal conveyor belt have reached the entry region of the second longitudinal conveyor belt.<br>
It is preferred if before the beginning of the conveyor operation at least  two   groups  of  longitudinal   conveyor  belts   are   defined   and   the<br><br>
longitudinal conveyor belts of a first group are activated first and the longitudinal conveyor belts of a second group are activated subsequently.<br>
It is preferred if in each group the longitudinal conveyor belt furthest away from the processing station is activated first.<br>
It is preferred if the longitudinal conveyor belts of the group with the longitudinal conveyor belt furthest away from the processing station are activated as the last group.<br>
It is preferred if the time of stopping the last longitudinal conveyor belt of a group and activating the first longitudinal conveyor belt of a subsequent group is determined in dependence on the spacing between the point of entry of the last longitudinal conveyor belt and the first longitudinal conveyor belt to the transverse conveyor belt, and the transverse conveyor belt advance.<br>
It is preferred if the longitudinal conveyor belts and the transverse conveyor belt are stopped when the last product of a group has been conveyed into the processing apparatus.<br>
It is preferred if the last product of the last longitudinal conveyor belt of the first group and the first products of the first longitudinal conveyor belt of the second group are deposited in a common mixed region on the transverse conveyor belt.<br>
It is preferred if an intermediate space is provided on the transverse conveyor belt between the products of the first group of longitudinal conveyor belts and the products of the second group of longitudinal conveyor belts.<br>
It is preferred if so many longitudinal conveyor belts are activated and/or the conveyor speed of the activated longitudinal conveyor belts is regulated such that so many products are fed to each region of the transverse conveyor belt that a predetermined capacity of the processing station is attained.<br>
It is preferred if a fraction of the transverse conveyor belt width is allocated to each activated longitudinal conveyor belt and the conveyor speed   of   each   longitudinal   conveyor   belt   is   so   regulated   that   the<br><br>
respectively allocated width of the transverse conveyor belt is filled with products by the respective longitudinal conveyor belt.<br>
It is preferred if each longitudinal conveyor belt pre-stores a given number of products and the products still stored on each longitudinal conveyor belt are detected by means of sensors and a smaller fraction of the transverse conveyor belt width is allocated to a longitudinal conveyor belt with few products than to a longitudinal conveyor belt with more products in order to achieve termination of emptying of all longitudinal conveyor belts at the same time or in time-displaced relationship by a given amount.<br>
It is preferred if a force sensor arranged at the discharge region of the transverse conveyor belt measures the pressing force prevailing horizontally between the products in the discharge region and the conveyor speed of the transverse conveyor belt is regulated in dependence on the force sensor signal.<br>
It is preferred if the conveyor speed of the transverse conveyor belt is reduced if the measured pressing force exceeds a predetermined value.<br>
It is preferred if the conveyor speed of the transverse conveyor belt is increased if the measured pressing force falls below a predetermined value.<br>
It is preferred if the conveyor speed of the longitudinal conveyor belts and/or the transverse conveyor belt is steplessly altered.<br>
It is preferred if a processing starting time is inputted and activation and conveyor speed of the longitudinal conveyor belts and the transverse conveyor belt are started at a time ascertained in dependence on the spacing between the longitudinal conveyor belt entry onto the transverse conveyor belt and the transverse conveyor belt advance in order to feed products to the processing station in a predetermined capacity at the start time of the processing station.<br>
The invention can further be implemented in a computer program product for execution on a computer, which is so programmed that it performs the steps required for regulation of the conveyor arrangement according to the invention when it is executed on a computer.<br><br>

Figure 10 shows a diagrammatic view of the visualisation of the conveyor belt advance of the arrangement shown in Figure 9, and<br>
Figure 11 shows a diagrammatic plan view of a portion of a transverse conveyor belt with five longitudinal conveyor belts entering same and four controllable product guide devices.<br><br>
Figure 1 shows an egg farm with six henhouse buildings 1 - 6, in each of which are arranged four double rows la - d with a plurality of tiers of aviaries arranged in rows one behind the other.<br>
The henhouse buildings 1-6 are arranged in mutually juxtaposed relationship in such a way that a transverse conveyor belt 10 can pass in a straight line at the end of the henhouse buildings. The transverse conveyor belt 10 is oriented at a right angle to the rows of aviaries la - d in the region of the henhouse buildings.<br>
As can be clearly seen in particular from Figure la longitudinal conveyor belts 11a - d and 12a - d which are arranged in mutually parallel relationship are respectively disposed at each side of the rows of aviaries la - d. Each tier of the rows of aviaries has its own longitudinal conveyor belts so that, for the five tiers of the rows of aviaries as shown in Figures 1 and la, there are total of 10 longitudinal conveyor belts for each row of aviaries and 40 longitudinal conveyor belts for each henhouse building. The longitudinal conveyor belts of the individual rows of aviaries communicate alternatively with an elevator at the end of each row of aviaries, which lifts the eggs out of the 10 longitudinal conveyor belts of a row of aviaries onto the transverse conveyor belt or the transverse conveyor belt 10 is displaced in height and the five tiers of the rows of aviaries are collected in succession in respect of time.<br>
The conveyor belt 10 conveys from right to left in Figures 1 and la and opens into a packaging station 20 in which the eggs are packaged.<br>
A central control and regulating unit 30 is connected to peripheral control and regulating units in each henhouse building and carries out the control and regulating procedures according to the invention for the longitudinal conveyor belts and the transverse conveyor belt 10.<br>
A central farm control system 40 permits a selection of parameters, visualisation of the egg collection procedure and the degree of utilisation of the individual conveyor belts.<br>
Figure 2 shows a plan view of a portion of a double row of aviaries with four aviaries and in adjoining relationship to the left and the right respectively, two further partially illustrated aviaries.   An individual aviary<br><br>
extends over a length LI of the longitudinal conveyor belts 11a, 12a. A fraction L2 of the length LI is occupied by a nest region in the aviary. In the region of the length L2, over 90% of the eggs are laid by the hens in the aviary so that the conveyor belt is filled in the region L2 in the stopped condition in a short time during the laying period.<br>
Two nest regions of adjacent aviaries are in directly adjoining relationship, as can be seen from Figure 2. Therefore, when the longitudinal conveyor belt in the region of the nest is filled with eggs, the longitudinal conveyor belts 11a, 12a must be advanced at least by double the length L2 in order to move a conveyor belt portion which is standing empty into the nest region. As the length L2 in the present example is a quarter of LI, that advance movement on the part of the longitudinal conveyor belt 11a, 12a can be effected three times. On the fourth occasion, the filled region of the longitudinal conveyor belt 11a, 12a would be conveyed out of the nest region 13 into the nest region 14. As in that situation the longitudinal conveyor belt is therefore full, the longitudinal conveyor belt must be continuously operated after it has advanced three times by the length 2 x L2 until all eggs are conveyed from the longitudinal conveyor belt 11a, 12a onto the transverse conveyor belt 10.<br>
Figure 3 shows an arrangement of the force sensor according to the invention, which is adapted to control the advance of the longitudinal conveyor belts in dependence on the eggs which have rolled in the nest region onto the longitudinal conveyor belt. The eggs roll on an inclined plane 15 out of the nest region to the longitudinal conveyor belt 11a. The upper run of the longitudinal conveyor belt 11a runs above a weighing pan 16 which is coupled to a force sensor by means of two L-shaped members 17a, 17b. The force sensor 18 is fixedly connected to the frame of the aviaries by means of a U-shaped member 19. The force sensor 18 ascertains the weight of the eggs arranged in the intermediate storage region 16' on the conveyor belt 11a above the weighing pan 16.<br>
The force sensor 18 can be in the form of a pressure sensor, but preferably it is in the form of a flexural beam sensor acting at one side, which represents a robust structure which at the same time is also reliable.<br><br>
The procedure involved in the conveyor method of the arrangement shown in Figure 3 is as follows. The eggs roll on the inclined plane 15 to a stop wire outside the aviary frame (not shown). The stop wire slows down the eggs and thus prevents those eggs from colliding with eggs which are already lying on the conveyor belt, and it is cyclically lifted to allow the eggs to pass through onto the conveyor belt at a low speed. The greater the number of eggs on the conveyor belt in the region above the weighing pan 16, the correspondingly greater weight is detected by the force sensor 18. Upon the attainment of a given limit value which, on the basis of an average egg weight, indicates complete filling of the longitudinal conveyor belt in the region of the nest, the longitudinal conveyor belt is advanced by double the magnitude of the nest length in order thereby to move an empty region of the longitudinal conveyor belt into the nest region. That is repeated three times and on the fourth occasion complete collection of the eggs from the longitudinal conveyor belt is implemented by the longitudinal conveyor belt being operated until it has covered at least a total lengthwise extent of the conveyor belt (that is to say half the length of the conveyor belt) and all eggs have been conveyed onto the transverse conveyor belt 10.<br>
Figure 4a shows another embodiment of the force sensor according to the invention in the entry region to a packaging station. The eggs are passed to the packaging station by one or more transverse conveyor belts by way of a funnel table 10' and are brought together to the width of the packaging station 20 on the table by means of wall guide elements 21. That provides for compacting the distribution of the eggs in an intermediate storage region 21' between the two wall guide elements 21. In the entry region to the packaging station the eggs must be introduced into guide passages 22a, b,.... In those regions, a build-up and congestion of eggs may occur by virtue of transversely disposed eggs, which can lead to further compacting of the egg distribution. That compacting effect can mean that the horizontal pressure between the eggs in the entry region upstream of the packaging station can become so great that hair cracks are produced in the eggshells or eggs are completely destroyed.<br><br>
In order to already detect such a situation before damage occurs, arranged laterally in the entry region are two pressure sensors 23a, b coupled to two half-round pressure pickup plates 24a, b. The pressure pickup plates 24, b project into the flow of eggs and detect a superposed, horizontally acting force component in transverse relationship with the conveyor direction and in opposite relationship to the conveyor direction. In dependence on the level of the force detected by the force sensors 23a, b, the conveyor speed of the transverse conveyor belt 10 is regulated. If the measured force rises the transverse conveyor belt speed is reduced while if the force falls the transverse conveyor belt speed is increased.<br>
Figure 4b shows an alternative to the arrangement of Figure 4a. In the Figure 4b arrangement, the force sensors 23a, b are dispensed with and instead the arrangement uses light barrier devices 25a, b which pass transversely over the entry region of the packaging station 20. The light barrier devices are so oriented that they measure over the eggs which are lying flat on the bottom surface of the packaging station, as can be seen from Figure 5. As soon as an egg stands up or eggs come to lie one upon the other they break the light beam of the light barrier device 25a, b. The number of such detected eggs is a measurement in respect of the horizontal pressure between the eggs in the entry region and can once again serve to regulate the transverse belt conveyor speed, as described hereinbefore.<br>
Figure 4c shows a further variant of the embodiment with light barrier devices as shown in Figure 4b. In Figure 4c there are a total of four light barrier elements 26a - d which monitor the entry region of the packaging station 20 over the area thereof and thus ensure more precise detection of eggs which are standing up or which are arranged one upon the other.<br>
Figure 6 shows a variant of the embodiment of Figure 4a with force sensors. The transverse conveyor belt 110 conveys the eggs by way of a funnel table 110' into a reaction region 122 in front of a packaging station 120. Side wall elements 121a, b guide the eggs together and compress the distribution thereof.   Arranged at each of the side wall elements 121a, b is<br><br>
a respective pressure pickup 123a, b coupled to a half-round deflection and pressure pickup plate 124a, b. The pressure pickup plate 124a, b is respectively pivotably mounted in a hinge mounting 125a, b arranged on the side facing towards the conveyor direction and as a result can freely movably transmit a pressing force exerted by the eggs to the pressure pickup 123a, b.<br>
Place centrally in the reaction region 122 in the form of an island arrangement are two further pressure sensors 123c, d which are again supported by means of two half-round pressure pickup plates 124c, d mounted pivotably in a common pivot mounting 125c in order to detect the horizontal egg pressure in the central region. The use of four pressure pickups at mutually spaced locations with a differing measurement direction ensures that even local compression phenomena in respect of egg distribution with unacceptably high horizontal forces are detected and the transverse belt conveyor speed can be appropriately regulated.<br>
The pressure pickups 123a - d are connected to a central transverse conveyor belt control 126 coupled in turn to a frequency converter 127 for actuating the drive motor 128 for transverse belt conveyance.<br>
A timing device 129 is also connected to the central control unit 126 and indicates the advance of the transverse conveyor belt.<br>
Figure 7 shows an example of visualisation of the full utilisation of and the advance of the transverse conveyor belt. The transverse conveyor belt 210 is divided into a plurality of transverse strips, each respective one of each represents a transverse conveyor belt length of 1m.<br>
Along the transverse conveyor belt, six longitudinal conveyor belts 211a - f communicate at spaced locations with the transverse conveyor belt 210. The longitudinal conveyor belts are illustrated by box symbols 211a - f in which are shown parameters relating to the conveyor properties of the longitudinal conveyor belt.<br>
At the left-hand end the transverse conveyor belt 210 leads into a packaging station 220.<br>
Figure 7 shows a conveyor arrangement state in which the collection operation from the longitudinal conveyor belt 211 was begun a short time<br><br>
ago. That is represented by black bars in the transverse conveyor belt regions downstream in the conveyor direction of the point of entry of the longitudinal conveyor belt 211f. The black bar region 212 symbolically represents the eggs deposited on the transverse conveyor belt. In addition a hatched rectangular region in the region of the entry of the longitudinal conveyor belt 21 If symbolically represents the transverse conveyor belt width allocated to the longitudinal conveyor belt 211f.<br>
Figure 8 shows the arrangement of Figure 7 at a later time in conveyor operation. In a region 213 filled to a reference value, the transverse conveyor belt picks up eggs to a transverse conveyor belt capacity of 80%, which includes a safety margin in relation to utilisation at full capacity. In a region 214, it is possible to see the discharge of the collection of the first group of eggs, which can be seen by virtue of the fact that the width of the transverse conveyor belt is utilised in a diagonally decreasing fashion. The first group, in the conveyor direction, is followed by a second group of eggs which is put onto the transverse conveyor belt by activation of the longitudinal conveyor belt 211e. A gap 216 is left between the group 213, 214 and the group 215, the gap allowing a short period of time for conversion of the packaging station 220.<br>
Figure 9 shows a diagrammatic plan view of a conveyor arrangement having two transverse conveyor belts 310, 312 and Figure 10 shows a diagrammatic view of the visualisation of that conveyor arrangement. As can be seen, arranged at each transverse conveyor belt 310, 312 are a plurality of longitudinal conveyor belts 311a - e, 313a - e, which lead onto the transverse conveyor belt 310 and 312 respectively at spaced locations. Each longitudinal conveyor belt 311a - e, 313a - e has its own decentral control which actuates the longitudinal conveyor belt in dependence on a weighing sensor as shown in Figure 3 and at the command of a higher-order central control system 330 causes total emptying of the longitudinal conveyor belt onto the corresponding transverse conveyor belt.<br>
Both transverse conveyor belts 310, 312 open into a packaging station 320.<br><br>
As can be seen from Figure 10 the eggs collected on the transverse conveyor belt are placed thereon in locally displaced relationship from four activated longitudinal conveyors 311c - f and are fed in the form of an interconnected block corresponding to the capacity of the packaging station 320, to the packaging station 320. On the transverse conveyor belt 312, only the longitudinal conveyor belts 313d - f are active and it is only after a further advance of the transverse conveyor belt 312 that the further longitudinal conveyor belts 313a - c are switched on.<br>
Figure 11 shows a portion of a transverse conveyor belt 410 with a plurality of longitudinal conveyor belts 411a - e which connect thereto and the locations of entry of which are spaced from each other in the conveyor direction of the transverse conveyor belt 410. A multiplicity of eggs which are symbolically represented by circles on the conveyor belt are conveyed on the transverse conveyor belt in the conveyor direction F.<br>
As will be seen the products pass into the illustrated portion of the transverse conveyor belt at the right-hand edge as viewed in the direction of the transverse conveyor belt and would therefore impede the feed of further eggs from the longitudinal conveyor belts 411a - e as they would firstly have to press the eggs which are already on the transverse conveyor belt, in the direction of the left-hand edge as seen in the direction of conveying movement of the transverse conveyor belt, with a considerable horizontal pressure.   In that situation the eggs can suffer damage.<br>
Arranged upstream of the longitudinal conveyor belt 41 le which is foremost in the conveyor direction of the transverse conveyor belt is an egg guide device 420a including an egg guide plate 421a mounted pivotably in a laterally and stationarily supported pivot mounting 422a. The egg guide plate 421a can be pivoted into or out of the region above the transverse conveyor belt by means of an actuator which in this case is an electrical linear drive 423a with position feedback signalling.<br>
Arranged in a similar fashion and of a similar structure, between the longitudinal conveyor belts 411d and e, between the longitudinal conveyor belts 411c and d and between the longitudinal conveyor belts 411b and c,<br><br>
are respective egg guide devices 420b and d which are of the same structure as the egg guide device 420a.<br>
In the illustrated conveyor condition, still further eggs are conveyed from the longitudinal conveyor belts 411a, b and d, e to the eggs which are already on the transverse conveyor belt. In order to avoid damage to the additional eggs which are being supplied thereto or the eggs which are already on the transverse conveyor belt, in that conveyor condition, the egg guide device 420a is pivoted into the region above the transverse conveyor belt to such an extent that the eggs are deflected from the right-hand side to the left-hand side so that space is provided for the eggs additionally arriving from the longitudinal conveyor belts 411a, b, d, e. The egg guide devices 420b and c are not pivoted out.<br>
The egg guide device 420d is pivoted out by a lesser amount than the egg guide device 420a in order to guide the eggs which are additionally arriving from the longitudinal conveyor belts 411d, e away from the right-hand edge of the transverse conveyor belt and thus to provide space for the eggs which are being added from the longitudinal conveyor belts 411a, b, without in that case guiding the entire flow of eggs on the transverse conveyor belt excessively far in the direction of the left-hand edge of the transverse conveyor belt so that damage would be caused to the eggs which are already on the transverse conveyor belt.<br>
The electrical linear drives 423a - d and the position feedback signalling units of those drives of the egg guide devices 420a - d are coupled to the central control system and are actuated in dependence on the number of eggs already on the transverse conveyor belt and the arrangement and possibly the conveyor rate of the longitudinal conveyor belts which are additionally feeding eggs, and are extended to such an extent that neither damage to the deflected eggs nor damage to the eggs which are being added can occur.<br>
The conveyor method according to the invention operates as follows:<br>
At a time about three hours after the beginning of laying, the longitudinal conveyor belt 31 If which is most remote from the packaging station is activated and conveys the eggs onto the transverse conveyor belt<br><br>
310. The transverse conveyor belt 310 is also activated and conveys the eggs in the direction of the packaging station. As soon as the eggs moved onto the transverse conveyor belt by the longitudinal conveyor belt 311f reach the point of entry of the longitudinal conveyor belt 31 le, the longitudinal conveyor belt 311e is also activated and conveys eggs onto the transverse conveyor belt 310. In that way the eggs on the two longitudinal conveyor belts 31 le, f are added to give a totalled transverse conveyor belt width. As soon as that region reaches the point of entry of the longitudinal conveyor belt 311d, that longitudinal conveyor belt is also activated, and so forth, until activation of the longitudinal conveyor belt 311a occurs. In that way, full utilisation of capacity, is achieved over the full width of the transverse conveyor belt and at the beginning of the work done by the packers at the packaging station 320 the transverse conveyor belt is completely filled and is just upstream of the packaging station 320.<br>
The eggs supplied by each longitudinal conveyor belt are counted in the region of the mouth opening of the respective longitudinal conveyor belts to provide a check about the laying output of the respective henhouse or the respective rows of aviaries. Furthermore that egg counting operation makes it possible to precisely determine the eggs disposed on the transverse conveyor belt. As soon as it is recognised that a longitudinal conveyor belt contains a very high number of eggs, for example by a high number of eggs already being counted with a short advance movement of the longitudinal conveyor belt, a greater transverse conveyor belt width is allocated to that longitudinal conveyor belt and a correspondingly reduced width is allocated to the other longitudinal conveyor belts. That ensures that even the longitudinal conveyor belt which is filled to an above-average extent is emptied within a period of time in which the other longitudinal conveyor belts are also emptied. That dynamic regulation can possibly be further adapted if other longitudinal conveyor belts emerge as being emptied belatedly or prematurely.<br>
The method according to the invention is the first to make it possible to provide for automatic regulation and full utilisation of the capacity of the packaging station in dependence on the eggs supplied by the individual<br><br>
longitudinal conveyor belts and the individual spacing thereof from the packaging station, as well as the respective currently prevailing transverse conveyor belt advance.<br><br><br>
