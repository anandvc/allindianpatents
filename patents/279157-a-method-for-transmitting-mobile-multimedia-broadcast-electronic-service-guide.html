The Preferred Embodiments of the Present Invention<br>
The present invention will be described in detail with combination of the accompanying figures and embodiments.<br>
As shown in FIG.1, the logical entities of this method comprise the multiplexer, broadcast station and mobile user equipments.<br>
The multiplexer obtains ESG and other audio/video data multiplexes the related ESG data into the logical channel and sends them to the broadcast station for modulation and transmission.<br>
The broadcast station modulates and transmits the multiplexed data<br>
The mobile user equipment (UE), including mobile communication equipments such as the cell phone, receives, buffers, updates, searches and displays the data, such as ESG message, transmitted through the broadcast network channel.<br>
The method for transmitting the mobile multimedia broadcast ESG comprises the following steps:<br>
(1)	The multiplexer receives the ESG message;<br>
(2)	The multiplexer multiplexes the ESG message into the designated multiplexing frame, wherein the multiplexing frame can be the multiplexing frame carrying the control information or that carrying the service information;<br>
(3)	The multiplexer sends the multiplexing frame to the broadcast station;<br>
(4)	The broadcast station modulates and sends the multiplexing frame to the mobile<br>
UE.<br>
 mobile UE receives the data sent by the broadcast station and demodulates the data, thus the subscribers can use the UE to obtain and display ESG message, thus find and use the service.<br>
The above multiplexed ESG message comprises the ESG data and ESG basic description table, and the ESG data in the specification comprise the ESG data in XML format. The data examples described by these data elements comprise: the service table, service extension information table, content table, service parameter table and arrangement table. However, the present invention is not limited to this format.<br>
The multiplexing system in the present invention applies the time division multiplexing based on the frequency.<br>
As shown in FIG2, several multiplexing frames consist in a broadcast channel frame, and each multiplexing frame includes the header, payload and filling part.<br>
For example, presume one second is the multiplexing period which is divided into 40 time segments (time slot), thus the multiplexing unit is 25ms. The logical multiplexing frames and time slot mapping are decided by the system configuration.<br>
One multiplexing frame corresponds to a control or service logic channel, and each multiplexing frame is assigned with a multiplexing frame identity MF_ID whose range is 0 to 39 with 39 as the maximum MFID, wherein the multiplexing frames whose MF_ID==0 are mapped to the control logical channel.<br>
There are two kinds of multiplexing frames: (1) multiplexing fames whose MF_ID=0 are used to transmit the system control information; (2) multiplexing fames whose MF_ID!=0 are used td transmit the service information. In the following, the structure of these two kinds of frames will be described in detail.<br>
The multiplexing payload of the multiplexing frames whose MF_ID!=0 generally consists o:'the multiplexing sub-frames of several kinds of data, and the multiplexing sub-frames have different functions, such as transmitting different TV channels, configuration control information or ESG message. The number of multiplexing sub-frames is 1 to 15. This kind of multiplexing sub-frames comprises the header, video segment, audio segment and data segment, or one or two of them, and the header of the<br>
multiplexing sub-frame is used to indicate whether there is audio segment, video  or data segment in the multiplexing sub-fames in the service channel or not.<br>
For the methods for multiplexing the ESG message, when multiplexing it into the multiplexing frame carrying the service information, an individual multiplexing sub-frame can be used to transmit the ESG data alone, that is, there is no audio and video segments in the multiplexing sub-frame and the data segment only transmits the ESG data Alternatively, the related ESG message is transmitted along with the audio/video data in the multiplexing sub-frame, that is, concomitant channel transmission; or both methods are applied in different multiplexing sub-frames simultaneously.<br>
As shown in FIG 3, the data segment might include several kinds of content, and it has a header and several data units, and the header defines the number of data units, the data unit parameters and CRC code, wherein the data unit parameters include descriptions of the type and length of each data unit. The data unit parameters can be divided into segments which are put into the front of corresponding data units separately rather than put together, here, a particular data type value is defined to identify that it is ESG data in the data unit, and this kind of data units is also referred to as the ESG data unit in the following description.<br>
Since the length of the ESG data payload of one ESG data unit is finite, the system generally sets the length to be the maximum value, such as 64Kbytes. When the size of one ESG data unit is not big enough to transmit the ESG data, the data should be segmented, that is, the well-prodessed ESG data block is divided into different data segments to be as the ESG data payload of a certain ESG data unit and different segments which are transmitted by different ESG data units. For the formatted data, if they are segmented during the transmission, the UE won't analyze the data unless all segments are received. Moreover, in order to improve the transmission efficiency, the ESG data should be compressed to be sent.<br>
The ESG data units are encapsulated into the data segments, and in this embodiment, the structure of the ESG data unit is shown as FIG4, which comprises header, payload and CRC code.<br>
The header of data comprises the following segments: data block ID, ESG data type  type, segment serial number and the tota,l number of segments. Wherein:<br>
The data block ID is used to represent the data blcjck to which the ESG data payload belongs. When there are several ESG data blocks in the system (for instance, ESG in today is an ESG data block, and ESG in other time of one week is another ESG data block) to be played one by one, they should be distinguish by using the data block ID in the ESG table header. Each data block can be obtained through combining different types of ESG data, for example, all kinds of ESG data which should be broadcasted during the day are combined to be a data block.<br>
The ESG data type ID indicates the type of the ESG data carried in the data payload, and the ESG data type in this embodiment me^ns the ESG data table to which the data in the ESG data payload belongs. Define a table ID constant list and use the table ID in the list as the ESG data type ID here. The table ID and data block ID uniquely determine a data block to which a data segment belongs.<br>
The encoding type means the compressed encoding type used by the ESG data payload, Which can be defined by a field of three bits, refer to table 1.<br>
Tablel Encoding type<br>
<br>
Value (b2blb0)	Type<br>
000	No compression<br>
001	GZIP compression<br>
010-111	Reserved<br>
Wherein, the GZIP compressed encoding is compressed with the GZIP compression algorithm, refer to IETF RFC 1952.<br>
The segment serial number is used to indicate the serial number of the segment carrying the to-be-transmitted data. That is, it indicates which data segment of its ESG data block is transmitted by the ESG data payload. The segment serial number is a number for these data segments, whose minimal value is 1 and the maximal one is the total numbler of data segments in the ESG table header.<br>
The total number of segments indicates the total number of segments for carrying the to-be-transmitted data. That is, it indicates how many data segments are divided to<br>
be multiplexed and sent when the ESG is transmitted in the ESG data unit. It also means  many ESG data payloads the ESG data are divided into, and they need how many  units to transmit.<br>
The length of ESG data payload can be derived by using the length of the ESG data unit and that of the ESG table header, that is: the length of data unit - (the length of ESG header + the length of CRC code). Wherein, the length of the ESG header and that of CRC code are fixed values.<br>
The mjultiplexing frames whose IP is MF_ID==0 in the header of multiplexing frames are used to carry the control information, as shown in FIG5, the multiplexing frame payload in this multiplexing frame comprises several control information tables, and each multiplexing sub-frame composes of one control information table. During the transmission, due to the difference of each ESG table data in applications, the real-time requirement and the amount of data, the requirements for the transmission repetitive rate (frequency) of each table data by the broadcasting system are different. Therefore, the system generally creates the ESG data into different tables and schedules and transmits the data respectively. Therefore, the data in several ESG tables are transmitted by using different ESG data units, and the ESG information transmitted at one time is the total or part of the data record in the total or part of tables. The data in the same ESG table are generally sent in one data unit, except that it is too big and needs to be segmented.<br>
The present embodiment multiplexes the above ESG data into the multiplexing frames in the service logical channel to transmit. In other embodiments of the present invention, the ESG data is multiplexed along with the ESG basic description table into the multiplexing frame carrying the control information. That is, the ESG information, including the ESG data and ESG basic description table, uses the multiplexing frame in the control logical channel to transmit. The ESG basic description table is one kind of control information table, and the data in the table describes the configuration of multiplexing sub-frames transmitting the ESG data, including the ESG service logical channel description, the number of ESG data types, the ESG data type parameters and the ESG table parameters. FIG.6 shows the deployable structure of the ESG basic description table, different from the structure of the above-mentioned ESG data unit or<br>
