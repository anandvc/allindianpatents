PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION<br>
[See section 10]<br>
A DEWATERING DEVICE;<br>
HITESH PANCHAL, AN INDIAN NATIONAL OF GEELI MACHINARY WORKS, PLOT NO. - 3A, MONA ESTATE, ANIL STARCH MILLS, ANIL ROAD, AHMEDABAD - 380 025, GUJARAT, INDIA;<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION.<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The invention relates to dewatering of material in form of sludge, sediment, suspensions and the like such as paper pulp, peat etc. Particularly it relates to dewatering device for dewatering by squeezing the material.<br>
BACKGROUND ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
A typical dewatering screw press comprises a rotating screw fitting closely inside a horizontal slotted or perforated screen. The screen and screw order to increase the pressure on the material being dewatered. The discharge end was partially closed by a cone. Rotation of the screw conveyed the material toward the discharge end, and as the pressure increased, the liquid associated with the material was forced out through the slots or perforations in the trough. However, it has been found that the dewatering press of the prior art does not perform satisfactorily as the cone is generally at fixed position while performing dewatering operation resulting in differential moisture content output. Further, the concentration of the solids in the sludge differs which may result in jamming of the rotation screw as the output rate is constant.<br>
The said problem is solved by Japanese application number of Publication No. JP2002172488. The said patent application provides a squeeze machine for the water-containing cake provided with a squeeze screen 10 provided with a water-containing cake input port 11 and dewatering cake discharge port 12, a jacket 2 formed with a moisture discharge port 3, a rotary screw 20 equipped with a squeeze vane 22 on its periphery and a pressure adjusting body 30 for adjusting<br><br><br>
the inner pressure of the squeeze screen by closing the dewatering cake discharge port with an appropriate pressure, a valve box 40 for surrounding the dewatering cake discharge port and the pressure adjusting body, and a pneumatic conveyance means 71 for pneumatically conveying the water-containing cake are provided. However, said pressure adjusting body is complicated and require more floor space.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a screw press device which solves above discus problem.<br>
Figure 1 shows a dewatering device (100) according to the present invention. The dewatering device (100) of the present invention comprises a feeder (10) for feeding material to be crushed or dewatered, a screw conveyor (20) mounted over a shaft (30), a screen (40) surrounding the screw conveyor (20), against which said screw conveyor (20) press the material to be squeezed, an outlet (50) beyond which the shaft (30) is extended, a conical valve (60) to regulate output of the squeezed material, and a pneumatic system (70) adapted at the outlet (50), said pneumatic system (60) adapts the conical valve (60) non-rotationally over the rotating shaft (30) by maintaining a clearance (not shown) between the shaft (30) and the conical valve (60) to allow rotation of the shaft, wherein said pneumatic system (70) moves the conical valve to and fro over the shaft to regulate the output of the squeezed material at constant pressure.<br><br><br>
According to the present invention, the conical valve (60) comprises a conical part (not shown) and a cylindrical part (not shown) with a bore (not shown) having diameter substantially greater than the diameter of the shaft (30). The pneumatic system (70) according to the present invention comprises at least two supporting member (72) like wings connected to a cylindrical part (not shown) which is removably fixedly connect to the cylindrical part of the conical valve (60), and a pneumatically operable means (76) connected to each supporting members (72) to move the conical valve (60) to and fro and to maintain constant pressure over the conical valve (60). The connection is preferably done by screw. Alternatively, the connection can be done by welding supporting plates directly to the conical part of the conical valve. According to present invention, a guiding rail (78) is provided to one of the support member preferably to a top supporting member as shown in Fig 1. According to the present invention, the screen (40) has conical shape comprising mesh screen covered by a plate having eye slots. The screen is covered by a trough (80) with an outlet (82) to collect squeezed liquid or water. In operation, when material to be dewatered or squeezed is introduced in the dewatering device of the present invention, the material gets squeezed between the screen and conveyor screw while traveling from inlet to outlet as the distance between the screw and the screen decreases longitudinally and due to the conical valve. The pneumatic system moves the conical valve towards the outlet and regulates the output of the material. At the outlet, as the pneumatic system applies constant pressure on the valve, the valve moves forward and backward<br><br><br>
depending upon the pressure on the squeezed material. This results in obtaining substantially constant moisture in the squeezed material and also reduces possibility of the jamming of the shaft due to differential concentration of the slurry or rate of the feeding of the material.<br>
The pneumatic system of the present invention is simple and can be fitted to conventional screw press. The scope of the present invention is not limited pneumatic but also described system can be operated by hydraulic.<br><br></td>
