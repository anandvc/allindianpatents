FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates, in general, to Blue tooth technology and in particular to a method for adding Blue tooth device address to the contact list and then sending message to the corresponding person, if his/her hand held device is out of range or inactive. More particularly, this invention relates to a method for adding Bluetooth device address to contact.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Blue tooth is a new evolving technology which was developed as a short-range wireless cable replacement for inter-linking portable consumer electronic products, such as cell phones, headsets, PDAs, laptops etc. It can also be adapted for fax machines, printers, toys, digital cameras, household appliances and virtually any other digital consumer product or application. In short Bluetooth is an ad-hoc network technology. The technology essentially provides a mechanism for forming small wireless networks between Bluetooth-equipped devices on an ad hoc basis. It can also serve as a wireless communication bridge to existing data networks. Bluetooth technology actually eliminates messy and confusing cables. Since it is inexpensive, vendors can incorporate it into their products to enable the consumers upgrade older equipments cheaply. The radio waves used in this technology passes through the walls and no line of sight is required. As the power consumption is low, it does not drain the battery. Another advantage is that the blue tooth devices find one another and connect themselves without any user input at all.<br>
Each Bluetooth enabled device is having a unique device address by which it is identified. Therefore to send data to a Bluetooth device its address should be known in prior. Generally blue tooth device name is used for user's convenience. The device address of the remote device can be found out either by initiating device discovery procedure or from the paired device list, if it is already paired. Pairing is the process of linking two Bluetooth devices, so that they can communicate. Paired<br><br>
device list shows device name instead of address. Usually each device maintains a list of paired devices in its contact list memory and the list includes the name or address of the device and not the name of the person as such. Bluetooth data transfer can also be done without pairing.<br>
Once the Bluetooth address is determined, the data transfer procedure can be initiated by user action. This data can be a simple text message (vMessage). However this message transfer will fail if the remote device is not Bluetooth activated then. Unlike SMS, there is no way to send messages offline in Bluetooth technology. Under such circumstances if user needs to send that message offline he/she should use SMS for the purpose and which calls for the device's phone number. But this alternate method becomes difficult, as there is no link currently available in Bluetooth device address and the phone number.<br>
Similarly, in the paired device database the stored device's name may be different from friends' name. It may also happen that similar names appeared in the paired device database. Hence it is a drudgery to correct identity of the device and the device address. Even worse would be the situation if the device were not listed under paired device list, where the discovery procedure has to be started to get the device address. Again if the particular device' visibility is set to off then its device address cant be found.<br>
It is generally observed that Discovery Procedure is bad, time and power consuming. Also if the remote device is not Bluetooth activated or it is beyond range then sending vMessage will fail as already mentioned above. Currently there is no way to send this message as offline message<br>
In the light of the foregoing, present invention proposes a method for storing the device address in contact/phonebook. The procedure overcomes the limitations in the prior art and is very effective.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is to provide the user with the options of adding the newly found Bluetooth address to the contact list, thus combining the user name and his Bluetooth address or letting the user to ignore the same.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a method to display the user name stored in contact list when an already paired device is found thereby avoiding the device name/identity confusion.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention also describes the method of sending offline messages to the device if it is not near by or it is not.<br>
It is again an object of the invention to display the name of the Bluetooth device during any Bluetooth operation so as to avoid any kind of confusion that may lead to security threat.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to retrieve the device phone number from the contact and thus resending it via SMS if the remote device is not Bluetooth activated or it is beyond range where sending vMessage fails.<br>
Accordingly the invention provides a method for adding bluetooth device address to the contact list of blue tooth enabled device when a new Bluetooth device's address is found, method comprising the steps of,<br>
a)	obtaining the address of the blue tooth device by device recovery process;<br>
b)	ignoring the address if it is not a mobile address;<br>
c)	searching the contact list to find out whether this address is already saved in the list and displaying the user name if it is present; and<br>
d)	prompting the user to save to the contact list or ignore the address when it is identified as a new one.<br><br>
The invention further provides a method for sending message from a blue tooth enabled device to another blue tooth enabled one, method comprising,<br>
a)	selecting the address from the address list of the Bluetooth addresses<br>
and sending the message through Bluetooth technology;<br>
b)	providing the user with the option to retry the process or to send<br>
message to the person through any other means in the event that<br>
"vMessage" fails owing to the scenario that the remote device is not<br>
Bluetooth activated or it is beyond range; and<br>
c)	retrieving the remote device's phone number or mail id from the contact<br>
list storing the Bluetooth address and resending the message if the user<br>
opts for sending message through any means like SMS, MMS or email.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings and the claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows the flowchart of adding the Bluetooth address in the contact list.<br>
Figure 2 shows the flowchart of sending the message.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the<br><br>
invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
It is already discussed in the prior art that each Bluetooth enabled device has a unique device address by which it is identified. Usually each device maintains a list of paired devices in its paired device list memory and the list includes the name or address of device and not the name of the person as such. The present invention proposes a method to display the user name stored in contact list/phonebook (if the device address was stored previously in the contact/phonebook list), when the device is discovered again. The invention also provides the user with the options of adding the newly found Bluetooth's address to the contact list, thus combining the user name and his Bluetooth address or allowing the user to ignore the same. The invention also describes the method of sending offline messages to the device if it is not near by or it is not Bluetooth activated using contact.<br>
Whenever a new Bluetooth device is found during device discovery and device's class equal to mobile device, its address is searched in the contact. If the address is not found then the user will be given an option to save it in contact or not. User will decide whether to save the address or not. The invention also provides the user with the options of adding the newly found Blue tooth's address to the contact list or ignoring the same.<br>
When the user selects to save the searched device's address and if the device's/remote user's identity is known then correct contact can be selected to save the Bluetooth address otherwise a new contact can be added storing that device's address and some unique name. And the Bluetooth device name is renamed by the name stored in contact. Whenever the same device is found again, the name in contact will be displayed instead of displaying the mobile model name (Bluetooth device name)<br>
It is an advantage that if the address is stored in contact, it makes easy for further transmission. For Example, User can go to contact and select the address and send<br><br>
some file, vCard, vMessage etc.<br>
The various steps involved in performing the invention are summarized below.<br>
?	New Bluetooth device's address is found.<br>
?	If the device class is not equal to mobile then ignore it.<br>
?	Search the contact to find out whether this address is saved in contact or not.<br>
?	If the address is saved in contact display the user name from contact. Option will be provided to save in contact.<br>
?	If the user wants to save the new address, save it in contact.<br>
?	If the remote device is not Bluetooth activated or it is beyond range then sending vMessage will fail. So in this case the remote device's phone number is retrieved from the contact (same contact storing the Bluetooth address of remote device) and the message can be resend via SMS.<br>
The invention is further elaborated herein with reference to Fig 1 and Fig 2. Figure 1 shows the various steps involved in the method of adding the Bluetooth address in the contact list.<br>
ii) In order to initiate communication with a Bluetooth device, its address should be known. This can be obtained by the device discovery procedure. Therefore the first and foremost step is the initiation of the discovery process (step 1).<br>
iii) If the remote device is Bluetooth activated, it will be discovered or otherwise the discovery procedure fails (step 2). Next the processing unit will check whether the discovered device is a mobile device or not (step 3). If it is not a mobile device it will ignore the session (step 4).<br>
iv) If it is a mobile device, the processing unit checks whether the discovered address is already in the contact list (step 5). If it is there the address will be displayed using contact name (step 6). Otherwise the user will be<br><br>
given an option to save the address in contact list or not (step 7). v)       If the user wants to add the address to the existing list he can select that option (step 8). Otherwise the address will be ignored without saving (step 9).<br>
Figure 2 shows how the message is sent to the Bluetooth device.<br>
i) The first step is selecting the address from the address list of the Bluetooth addresses (step 1). Next step is to send the message through Bluetooth technology (step 2).<br>
ii)	If the remote device is not Bluetooth activated or it is beyond range then<br>
sending vMessage will fail (step 3). Then the user is given an option to retry the process or send message to the person through any other means (step 4).<br>
iii)	If the user opts for sending message through any means like SMS, MMS,<br>
email etc., the remote device's phone number or mail id is retrieved from the contact (from the same contact list storing the Bluetooth address) and the message can be resend (step 5). Other wise the user can retry the Bluetooth process (step 6).<br>
One major attraction of the invention is that it provides the establishment of the link between the Bluetooth device address and its phone number and proposes the method of storing the device address in contact/phonebook.<br>
The foregoing description of the preferred embodiment is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the present invention. The various modifications to these embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments without the use of the inventive faculty.<br><br>
Thus the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown herein but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features disclosed herein. Various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit/scope of the invention. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from<br><br><br>
