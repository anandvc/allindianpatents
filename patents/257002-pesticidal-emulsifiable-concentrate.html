				<td>PESTICIDAL EMULSIFIABLE CONCENTRATE<br>
FIEDL OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a pesticidal emulsifiable concentrate. More specifically, it relates to a pesticidal emulsifiable concentrate comprising pyridalyl as an effective ingredient.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pyridalyl,	i.e.,	2,6-dichloro-4-(3,3-<br>
dichloroallyloxy)phenyl	3-[5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-<br>
pyridyloxy]propyl ether, represented by the formula (1):<br><br>
has been known in W096/11909 as an effective ingredient of a pesticide.	Further, a pesticidal emulsifiable<br>
concentrate comprising pyridalyl as an effective ingredient has also been disclosed in W096/11909.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
However, the pesticidal emulsifiable concentrate comprising pyridalyl as the effective ingredient disclosed in Preparation Example 1 of W096/11909 has not always<br>
sufficient emulsion stability depending upon conditions, when it is diluted with water. Then, it is desired to develop a pesticidal emulsifiable concentrate which comprises pyridalyl as an effective ingredient, and is excellent in emulsion stability.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a pesticidal emulsifiable concentrate which comprises pyridalyl as an effective ingredient, and is excellent in emulsion stability upon dilution with water.<br>
This object as well as other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors have studied intensively to obtain a pesticidal emulsifiable concentrate which comprises pyridalyl as an effective ingredient, and is excellent in emulsion stability upon dilution with water. As a result, they have found that a pesticidal emulsifiable concentrate containing an aromatic hydrocarbon as a solvent, and a polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene polyarylphenol and an alkylarylsulfonate as surfactants can attain the desired object. Thus, the present invention has been completed.<br>
That is, the pesticidal emulsifiable concentrate of the present invention comprises pyridalyl, a<br>
polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene polyarylphenol, an alkylarylsulfonate and an aromatic hydrocarbon.<br>
The proportion of the respective ingredients in the pesticidal emulsifiable concentrate of the present invention is usually 5 to 60% by weight of pyridalyl, 2 to 15% by weight of the polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene polyarylphenol, 2 to 15% by weight of the alkylarylsulfonate and 10 to 90% by weight of the aromatic hydrocarbon.<br>
The pesticidal emulsifiable concentrate of the present invention may essentially consist of pyridalyl, a polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene polyarylphenol, an alkylarylsulfonate and an aromatic hydrocarbon. Alternatively, it may further contain other auxiliaries such as other solvents, antioxidants, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like.<br>
Examples of the other solvent include esters such as methyl oleate and dibutyl adipate; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as octane and decane; ketones such as cyclohexanone; and amides such as N, N-dimethylformamide and N- methylpyrrolidone.<br>

The following Test Example illustrates emulsion stability of the pesticidal emulsifiable concentrate of the present invention.<br>
Test Example<br>
In water, 3.04 g of potassium chloride and 1.39 g of magnesium chloride 6 hydrate were dissolved, and the solution was made up to 100 ml with water to prepare a hard water stock. One ml of the hard water stock was diluted and made up to 1, 000 ml with water to prepare a test hard water having the water hardness of 34.2 ppm. Likewise, 14.6 ml of the hard water stock was diluted and made up to 1,000 ml with water to prepare a test hard water having the water hardness of 500 ppm.<br>
Ninety five ml of the above test hard water having the water hardness of 34.2 ppm was placed in a 100 ml-measuring cylinder with a stopper and the measuring cylinder was allowed to stand in a constant temperature water bath at 20°C for a while to adjust the water temperature to 20°C. Then, 5 ml of the present invention emulsifiable concentrate obtained in the above Production Example was added to the measuring cylinder, and the measuring cylinder was repeatedly turned upside down 30 times at a rate of once per 2 seconds. After that, the measuring cylinder was allowed to stand again in a constant temperature water bath at 20°C for 1 hour. When the state of the emulsion in the measuring cylinder was observed after standing, both of the present invention emulsifiable concentrates 1 and 2 maintained uniform emulsion states. When the same test was conducted by using the pesticidal emulsifiable concentrate obtained in the above Comparative Production Example, a small amount of creamy separation was observed in case of using the comparative emulsifiable concentrate 1, and a trace amount of creamy separation was observed in case of using the comparative emulsifiable concentrate 2.<br>
When the same test was conducted by using the above test hard water having the water hardness of 50 0 ppm to observe the state of the emulsion, both of the present invention emulsifiable concentrates 1 and 2 maintained uniform emulsion states. However, 0.5 cc of creamy separation was observed in case of using the comparative emulsifiable concentrate 1, and a small amount of creamy separation was observed in case of using the comparative emulsifiable concentrate 2.<br>
As described hereinabove, the pesticidal emulsifiable concentrate of the present invention is excellent in emulsion stability upon water dilution, and is useful as a pesticide.<br><br><br><br><br>
