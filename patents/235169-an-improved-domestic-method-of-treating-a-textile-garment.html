LAUNDRY TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to laundry treatment 5  compositions that comprise a dye.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Garments comprising polyester fibres are ubiquitous. Many garments are white but over the lifetime of these garments <br>
10 	 the whiteness is dulled reducing the aesthetic value of the garment. There is a need to maintain the white appearance of such garments such that the aesthetic value is retained as long as possible.<br>
15  Bleach, fluorescers and shading agents are used in modern wash processes to maintain whiteness. The fluorescers and shading; agents that are currently available, do not deposit on polyester fibres of garments to a significant degree. All fibres may be subjected to a bleaching process but over time<br>
20  such treatment can lead to the garment taking a yellow hue.<br>
There is a need to provide technology that maintains and enhances the white appearance of polyester comprising garments.<br>
25<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Dyes disclosed herein are known to be used to dye textiles in industrial processes conducted at high temperatures together with high concentrations of dyes and dispersion<br>
30  agents.  Surprisingly the dyes can be used to shade at low levels of dye and surfactant and at routine laundry<br><br>

temperatures. We have found that hydrophobic dyes are substantive to polyester fibres under normal domestic wash conditions. At low levels of dye a shading whiteness benefit is provided. <br>
5<br>
In one aspect the present invention provides a laundry treatment composition comprising between 0.0001 to 0.1 wt % of a hydrophobic dye selected from benzodifuranes, methine, triphenylmethanes, napthalimides, pyrazole, napthoquinone <br>
10	  and mono-azo or di-azo dyes, and between 2 to 60 wt % of a surfactant. It is preferred that the dye is a mono-azo dye.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a method of treating a textile, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
15  (i) treating a textile with an aqueous solution of the<br>
hydrophobic dye, the aqueous solution comprising from 1 ppb to 6 ppm of the hydrophobic dye and from 0.2 g/L to 3 g/L of a surfactant; and, {ii)  rinsing and drying the textile.  It is preferred that the aqueous solution has an ionic strength<br>
20  from 0.001 to 0.5. It is preferred that the hydrophobic dye is present in the range 10 ppb to 200 ppb. In another aspect it is preferred that the aqueous solution also comprises from'1-ppb to 5 ppm one or more other dyes selected from cotton substantive shading dyes of group consisting of:<br>
25  hydrolysed reactive dye; acid dye; and direct dye.<br>
A "unit dose" as used herein is a particular amount of the laundry treatment composition used for a type of wash, conditioning or requisite treatment step.  The unit dose may <br>
30 	 be in the form of a defined volume of powder, granules or tablet or unit dose detergent liquid.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
.Typical dye suppliers may be found,in the colour index, and include Clarianf, Dystar, Ciba &amp; BASF.<br>
5  Hydrophobic dyes are defined as organic compounds with a<br>
maximum extinction coefficient greater than 1000 L/mol/cm in the wavelength range of 400- to 750 nm and that are uncharged in aqueous solution at a pH in the range from 7 to 11. The hydrophobic dyes are devoid of polar solubilizing groups. In<br>
10  particular the hydrophobic dye does not contain any<br>
sulphonic acid, carboxylic acid, or quaternary ammonium groups. The dye chromophore is preferably selected from the group comprising: azo; methine,' pyrazole napthoquinone, phthalocyanine; and, triphenylmethane chrpmophores.  Most<br>
15  preferred are azo dye chromophores.<br>
Many examples of hydrophobic dyes are found in the classes of solvent and disperse dyes.<br>
20  Shading of white garments may be done with any colour "depending on consumer preference. Blue and Violet are particularly preferred shades and consequently preferred dyes or mixtures of dyes are ones that give a blue or violet shade on white polyester.<br>
25<br>
It is preferred that the dye(s) have a peak absorption wavelength of from 550nm to 650nm, preferably from 570nm to 630nm. A combination of dyes may be used which together have the visual effect on the human eye as a single dye having a<br>
30  peak absorption wavelength on polyester of from 550nm to<br>
650nm, preferably from 570nm to 630nm.  This may be provide<br><br>

for example by mixing a red and green-blue dye to yield a blue or violet shade.<br>
A wide.range of suitable solvent and disperse dyes are <br>
5 	 available. However detailed toxicological studies have shown that a number of such dyes are possible carcinogens, such dyes are not prererred.<br>
Preferred mono-azo dyes are of the torm:<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
10<br>
Example 1<br>
Approximately 1000 ppm solutions of the dyes listed in the<br>
table below, were made in ethanol.<br>
15  A stock solution of 1.8g/L of a base washing powder in water was. created.  The washing powder contained 18% NaLAS, 73% salts (silicate, sodium tri-poly-phosphate, sulphate, carbonate), 3% minors including perborate, fluorescer and enzymes, remainder impurities and water.  The solution was<br>
20  divided into 100ml aliquots and the solvent dyes added from the ethanol solutions to give 5.8 ppm solutions. 1 g of pure woven polyester fabric was added to each of the wash solutions and the solution then shaken for 30 minutes, rinsed and dried. From the colour of the fabric it was clear<br>

Example  2<br>
50 ppm solutions of the dyes listed in the table below, were made in ethanol. Concentration refers to. dyes as received-<br>
5 	 from the supplier. In general solvent dyes are pure (&gt;90%) and,disperse dyes have purities in the range 20-50%.<br>
A stock solution of 1.8g/L of a base washing powder in water was created.  The washing powder contained 18% NaLAS, 73%<br>
10  salts (silicate, sodium tri-poly-phosphate, sulphate,<br>
.carbonate), 3% minors including perborate, fluorescer and enzymes, remainder impurities and water.  The solution was divided into 100ml aliquots and the dyes added from the ethanol solutions with rapid stirring.to give 200ppb<br>
15  solutions. 1 g of pure knitted polyester fabric was added to each of the wash solutions and the solution then shaken for 30 minutes, rinsed and dried. From the colour of, the fabric it was clear that dye had deposited to the fabric. To quantify this the colour was measured using a reflectance<br>
20  spectrometer and expresses as the delta E value compared to a polyester washed analogously but without dye present. Following the washes the Ganz whiteness of the cloth was also measured (see "assessment of Whiteness and Tint of  Fluorescent Substrates with Good Instrument Correlation"<br>
25 Colour Research and Application  19, 1994)..<br>
The experiments were repeated using knitted nylon as a fabric type.<br><br>

The optical density, OD, is that of a 200ppb solution in water at 10cm. The value was obtained by extrapolated from<br><br>
WO 2006/045375<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/009846<br><br>

from measurement in ethanol solutions at higher levels for accuracy.<br>
CT is a measure of the Colour Transferred from the wash 5  solution to the polyester and is defined as:<br>
CT - deltaE/OD<br>
From the deltaE results in the table all the dyes coloured 0  the polyester.<br>
From the Ganz results, dyes which are blue or violet<br>
increase the whiteness. The Black and red dyes decrease the<br>
whiteness.<br>
The lumogen dyes add fluorescence to the polyester, as <br>

Example 3<br>
The experiment of example 2 was repeated, but using 40 ppb of the dyes listed below. The L:C was changed to 30:1 and <br>
0	  consisted by weight of 43% woven polyester and 57% non-mercerised cotton sheeting. The Ganz whiteness of the polyester was 89 for disperse blue 79:1. Whiteness benefits were also observed on the cotton. Repetition of the experiment using nylon, also gave benefits.<br><br>
