				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to liquid, aqueous pharmaceutical compositions containing Factor VII polypeptides, and methods for preparing and using such compositions, as well as containers containing such compositions, and the use of such compositions in the treatment of a Factor VII-responsive syndrome. More particularly, the invention relates to liquid compositions stabilised against chemical and/or physical degradation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A variety of Factors involved in the blood clotting process have been identified, including Factor VII (FVII), a plasma glycoprotein. Coagulation is Initiated by the formation of a complex between Tissue Factor (TF) being exposed to the circulating blood following an injury to the vessel wall, and FVIIa which is present in the circulation in an amount corresponding to about 1% of the total FVII protein mass. FVII exists in plasma mainly as a single-chain zymogen which is cleaved by FXa into its two-chain, activated form, FVIIa. Recombinant activated Factor VIla (rFVIIa) has been developed as a pro-haemostatic agent. The administration of rFVIIa offers a rapid and highly effective pro-haemostatic response in haemophilic subjects with bleedings, who cannot be treated with other coagulation Factor products due to antibody formation. Also bleeding in subjects with Factor VII deficiency or subjects having a normal coagulation system but experiencing excessive bleeding can be treated successfully with FVIIa.<br>
It is desirable to have administration forms of Factor VIla suitable for both storage and for delivery. Ideally, the drug product is stored and administered as a liquid. Alternatively, the drug product is lyophilized, i.e. freeze-dried, and then reconstituted by adding a suitable diluent prior to patient use. Ideally, the drug product has sufficient stability to be kept in long-term storage, i.e. more than six months.<br>
The decision to either maintain the finished drug product as a liquid or to freeze-dry it is usually based on the stability of the protein drug in those forms. Protein stability can be affected inter alia by such factors as ionic strength, pH, temperature, repeated cycles of freeze/thaw, and exposures to shear forces. Active protein may be lost as a result of physical instabilities, including denaturation and aggregation (both soluble and insoluble aggregate formation), as well as chemical instabilities, including, for example, hydrolysis, deamidatlon, and oxidation, to name just a few. For a general review of the stability of protein pharmaceuticals, see, for example, Manning, et al., Pharmaceutical Research 6:903-918 (1989).<br>
While the possible occurrence of protein instabilities Is widely appreciated, it is impossible to predict particular instability problems of a particular protein. Any of these Instabilities can result in the formation of a protein by-product, or derivative, having lowered activity, increased toxicity, and/or increased immunogenicity. Indeed, protein precipitation may lead to thrombosis, non-homogeneity of dosage form and amount, as well as clogged syringes. Furthermore, post-translational modifications such as, for example, gamma carboxylation of certain glutamic acid residues in the N-terminus and addition of carbohydrate side chains provide potential sites that may be susceptible to modification upon storage. Also, specific to Factor VIla, being a serine protease, fragmentation due to autocatalysis may occur (enzymatic degradation). Thus, the safety and efficacy of any composition of a protein is directly related to its stability. Maintaining stability in a liquid form is generally different from maintaining stability In a lyophllized form because of highly increased potential for molecular motion and thereby increased probability of molecular interactions. Maintaining stability in a concentrated form is also different from the above, because of the propensity for aggregate formation at increased protein concentrations.<br>
When developing a liquid composition, many factors are taken Into consideration. Short-term, i.e. less than six months, liquid stability generally depends on avoiding gross structural changes, such as denaturation and aggregation. These processes are described in the literature for a number of proteins, and many examples of stabilizing agents exist. It is well-known that an agent effective in stabilizing one protein actually acts to destabilize another. Once the protein has been stabilized against gross structural changes, developing a liquid composition for long-term stability (e.g., greater than six months) depends on further stabilizing the protein from types of degradation specific to that protein. More specific types of degradation may include, for example, disulfide bond scrambling, oxidation of certain residues, deamidation, cyclization. Although it is not always possible to pinpoint the individual degradation species, assays are developed to monitor subtle changes so as to monitor the ability of specific exciplents to uniquely stabilize the protein of interest.<br>
It is desirable that the pH of the composition is in a physiologically suitable range upon injection/infusion, otherwise pain and discomfort for the patient may result.<br>
For a general review of protein compositions, see, for example, Cleland et al.: The development of stable protein compositions: A closer look at protein aggregation, deamidation and oxidation, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems 1993, 10(4): 307-377; and Wang et al., Parenteral compositions of proteins and peptides: Stability and stabilizers, Journal of Parenteral Science and Technology 1988 (Supplement), 42 (2S).<br>
Factor VIla undergoes several degradative pathways, especially aggregation (dimerisation), oxidation, and autolytic cleavage (clipping of the peptide backbone or "heavy chain degradation"). Furthermore, precipitation may occur. Many of these reactions can be slowed<br>
significantly by removal of water from the protein. However, the development of an aqueous composition for Factor VIla has the advantages of eliminating reconstitution errors, thereby increasing dosing accuracy, as well as simplifying the use of the product clinically, thereby increasing patient compliance. Ideally, compositions of Factor VIla should be stable for more than 6 months over a wide range of protein concentrations. This allows for flexibility in methods of administration. Generally, more highly concentrated forms allow for the administration of lower volumes, which is highly desirable from the patients' point of view. Liquid compositions can have many advantages over freeze-dried products with regard to ease of administration and use.<br>
Today, the only commercially available, recombinantly-made FVII polypeptide composition is a freeze-dried Factor FVIIa product which is reconstituted before use; it contains a relatively low Factor VIla concentration, e.g., about 0.6 mg/mL. A vial (1.2 mg) of NovoSeven® (Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark) contains 1.2 mg recombinant human Factor VIla, 5.84 mg NaCI, 2.94 mg CaCI2, 2 H2O, 2.64 mg glycylglycine (GlyGly), 0.14 mg polysorbate 80, and 60.0 mg mannitol; it is reconstituted to pH 5.5 by 2.0 mL water for injection (WFI). When reconstituted, the protein solution Is stable for use for 24 hours. Thus, no liquid ready-for-use- or concentrated Factor VII products are currently commercially available.<br>
Accordingly, it is an objective of this invention to provide a liquid, aqueous Factor VII polypeptide pharmaceutical composition which provides acceptable control of chemical and/or physical degradation products such as enzymatic degradation or autocatalysis products.<br>

Examples of guanidine compounds are those selected from the group consisting of arginine, arginine derivatives and peptides of 2-5 amino acid residues comprising at least one arginine residue. Arginine constitutes a particular embodiment (see the Experimental section).<br>
The term "arginine derivatives" is intended to encompass arginine homologues, N-terminal functionalised arginines (e.g. N-methylated and N-acylated (e.g. acetylated) derivatives), C-terminal functionalised arginines (e.g. C-amidated, C-alkylamidated, and C-alkylated derivatives), and combinations thereof.<br>
As mentioned above, the one crucial motif of the stabilising agents Is -C(=N-Z1-R1)-NH-Z2-R2. Other parts of the stabilising agent may also be important, in particular with respect to optimisation of the stabilising effect and the tolerance by the patient. Typically, the stabilising agent has the formula Y-C(=N-Z1-R1)-NH-Z2-R2, wherein Y is an organic radical. The radical Y is typically selected in order to improve the efficiency of the stabilising effect. Also, the radical Y may comprise one or more further motifs of the formula -C(=N-Z1-R1)-NH-Z2-R2.<br>

In various embodiments, the molar ratio between the stabilising agent (iii) and FVII polypeptide (agent (iii):FVII) is: above 0.1, above 0.5, above 1, above 2, above 5, above 10, above 25, above 100, above 250, above 1000, above 2500, or above 5000, such as, e.g., in the range of 0.1-10000, 0.1-5000, 0.1-2500, 0.1-1000, 0.1-250, 0.1-100, 0.1-25, 0.1-10, 0.5-10000, 0.5-5000, 0.5-2500, 0.5-1000, 0.5-250, 0.5-100, 0.5-25, 0.5-10, 1-10000, 1-5000, 1-2500, 1-1000, 1-250, 1-100; 1-25; 1-10, 10-10000, 10-5000, 10-250, 1000-10000, or 1000-5000.<br>
The desirable concentration typically depends on the selected stabilising agent (or agents), more specifically on the binding affinity of the selected agent to the Factor VII polypeptide.<br>
The biological effect of the pharmaceutical composition Is mainly ascribed to the presence of the Factor VII polypeptide, although other active Ingredients may be Induded In combination with the Factor VII polypeptide.<br>
As used herein, the term "Factor VII polypeptide" encompasses wild-type Factor VII (i.e. a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence disclosed In U.S. Patent No. 4,784,950), as well as variants of Factor VII exhibiting substantially the same or improved biological activity relative to wild-type Factor VII. The term "Factor VII" is intended to encompass Factor VII polypeptides in their uncleaved (zymogen) form, as well as those that have been proteolytically processed to yield their respective bioactive forms, which may be designated Factor VIla. Typically, Factor VII is cleaved between residues 152 and 153 to yield Factor VIla. The term "Factor VII polypeptide" also encompasses polypeptides, including variants, in which the Factor VIla biological activity has been substantially modified or somewhat reduced relative to the activity of wild-type Factor VIla. These polypeptides include, without limitation, Factor VII or Factor VIla into which specific amino acid sequence alterations have been introduced that modify or disrupt the bioactivity of the polypeptide.<br>
The biological activity of Factor VIla in blood clotting derives from its ability to (i) bind to Tissue Factor (TF) and (ii) catalyze the proteolytic cleavage of Factor IX or Factor X to produce activated Factor IX or X (Factor IXa or Xa, respectively).<br>
For the purposes of the invention, biological activity of Factor VII polypeptides ("Factor VII biological activity") may be quantified by measuring the ability of a preparation to promote blood clotting, cf. Assay 4 described herein. In this assay, biological activity is expressed as the reduction in clotting time relative to a control sample and is converted to "Factor VII units" by comparison with a pooled human serum standard containing 1 unit/mL Factor VII activity. Alternatively, Factor VIla biological activity may be quantified by (i) measuring the ability of Factor VIla or a Factor VII-related polypeptide to produce activated Factor X (Factor Xa) in a system comprising TF embedded in a lipid membrane and Factor X. (Persson et a!., J. Biol. Chem. 272:19919-19924, 1997); (ii) measuring Factor X hydrolysis in an aqueous system ("In Vitro Proteolysis Assay", see Assay 2 below); (Hi) measuring the physical binding of Factor VIla or a Factor Vll-related polypeptide to TF using an instrument based on surface plasmon resonance (Persson, FEBS Letts. 413:359-363, 1997); (iv) measuring hydrolysis of a synthetic substrate by Factor VIla and/or a Factor Vll-related polypeptide ("In Vitro Hydrolysis Assay", see Assay 1 below); or (v) measuring generation of thrombin in a TF-independent in vitro system (see Assay 3 below).<br>
Factor VII variants having substantially the same or improved biological activity relative to wild-type Factor VIla encompass those that exhibit at least about 25%, such as, e.g., at least about 50%, at least about 75% or at least about 90% of the specific activity of Factor VIla that has been produced in the same cell type, when tested in one or more of a clotting assay<br>
(Assay 4), proteolysis assay (Assay 2), or TF binding assay as described above. Factor VII variants having substantially reduced biological activity relative to wild-type Factor VIIa are those that exhibit less than about 25%, such as, e.g., less than about 10%, or less than about 5% of the specific activity of wild-type Factor VIla that has been produced in the same cell type when tested in one or more of a clotting assay (Assay 4), proteolysis assay (Assay 2), or TF binding assay as described above. Factor VII variants having a substantially modified biological activity relative to wild-type Factor VII Include, without limitation, Factor VII variants that exhibit TF-independent Factor X proteolytic activity and those that bind TF but do not cleave Factor X.<br>
Variants of Factor VII, whether exhibiting substantially the same or better bioactivity than wild-type Factor VII, or, alternatively, exhibiting substantially modified or reduced bioactivity relative tc wild-type Factor VII, include, without limitation, polypeptides having an amino acid sequence that differs from the sequence of wild-type Factor VII by insertion, deletion, or substitution of one or more amino acids.<br>
Non-limiting examples of Factor VII variants having substantially the same biological activity as wild-type Factor VII include S52A-FVIIa, S60A-FVIIa (Lino et al.. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 352: 182-192, 1998); FVIIa variants exhibiting Increased proteolytic stability as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,580,560; Factor VIIa that has been proteolytically cleaved between residues 290 and 291 or between residues 315 and 316 (Mollerup et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 48:501-505, 1995); oxidized forms of Factor VIIa (Kornfelt et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 363:43-54, 1999); FVII variants as disclosed in PCT/DK02/00189; and FVII variants exhibiting increased proteolytic stability as disclosed in WO 02/38162 (Scripps Research Institute); FVII.variants having a modified Gla-domain and exhibiting an enhanced membrane binding as disclosed in WO 99/20767 (University of Minnesota); and FVII variants as disclosed in WO 01/58935 (Maxygen ApS).                                     l<br>
Non-limiting examples of Factor VII variants having increased biological activity compared to wild-type FVIIa include FVII variants as disclosed in WO 01/83725, WO 02/22776, WO 02/077218, WO 03/27147, WO 03/37932; WO 02/38162 (Scripps Research Institute); and FVIIa variants with enhanced activity as disclosed in IP 2001061479 (Chemo-Sero-Therapeutic Res Inst.).<br>

In some embodiments, the Factor VII polypeptides are Factor VII-related polypeptides, in particular variants, wherein the ratio between the activity of said Factor VII polypeptide and the activity of native human Factor VIIa (wild-type FVIIa) is at least about 1.25 when tested in the "In Vitro Hydrolysis Assay" (see Assay 1 below); in other embodiments, the ratio is at least about 2.0; in further embodiments, the ratio is at least about 4.0.<br>
In a pharmaceutical composition, it is often desirable that the concentration of the active ingredient is such that the application of a unit dose does not cause unnecessary discomfort to the patient. Thus, a unit dose of more than about 2-10 mL Is often undesirable. For the purpose of the present Invention, the concentration of the Factor VII polypeptide is therefore at least 0.01 mg/mL In different embodiments, the Factor VII polypeptide is present in a<br>
concentration of 0.01-20 mg/mL; 0.1-20 mg/mL; 0.1-15 mg/mL; 0.1-10 mg/mL; 0.5-5.0 mg/mL; 0.6-4.0 mg/mL; 1.0-4.0 mg/mL; 0.1-5 mg/mL; 0.1-4.0 mg/mL; 0.1-2 mg/mL; or 0.1-1.5 mg/mL.<br>
Factor VIIa concentration is conveniently expressed as mg/mL or as IU/mL, with 1 mg usually representing 43,000 - 56,000 IU or more.<br>
In order to render the liquid, aqueous pharmaceutical composition useful for direct parenteral administration to a mammal such as a human, it is normally required that the pH value of the composition Is held within certain limits, such as from about 4.0 to about 9.0. To ensure a suitable pH value under the conditions given, the pharmaceutical composition also comprises a buffering agent (ii) suitable for keeping pH in the range of from about 4.0 to about 9.0.<br>
The term "buffering agent" includes those agents or combinations of agents that maintain the solution pH in an acceptable range from about 4.0 to about 9.0.<br>

It should be understood that the buffering agent may comprise a mixture of two or more components, wherein the mixture is able to provide a pH value in the specified range. As examples can be mentioned acetic acid and sodium acetate, etc.<br>
The concentration of the buffering agent is chosen so as to maintain the preferred pH of the solution. In various embodiments, the concentration of the buffering agent is 1-100 mM; 1-50 mM; 1-25 mM; or 2-20 mM.<br>
In one embodiment, the pH of the composition is kept from about 4.0 to about 9.0; from 5.0 to about 9.0; from about 5.0 to about 8.0; such as from about 5.0 to about 7.5; from about 5,0 and about 7.0; from about 5.0 to about 6.5; from about 5.0 to about 6.0; from about 5.5 to about 7.0; from about 5.5 to about 6.5; from about 6.0 to about 7.0; from about 6.0 to about 6.5; from about 6.3 to about 6.7, or from about 5.2 to about 5.7.<br>
In addition to the three mandatory components, the liquid, aqueous pharmaceutical composition may comprise additional components beneficial for the preparation, formulation, stability, or administration of the composition.<br>
.  Hence, the pharmaceutical composition may also include a non-ionic surfactant. Surfactants (also known as detergents) generally include those agents which protect the protein from<br>
air/solution interface induced stresses and solution/surface induced stresses (e.g. resulting in protein aggregation).<br>
Typical types of non-ionic surfactants are polysorbates, poloxamers, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyethylene/polypropylene block co-poiymers, polyethyleneglycol (PEG), polyxyethylene stearates, and polyoxyethylene castor oils.<br>

In a more specific embodiment, a calcium salt and/or a magnesium salt is/are used In combination with sodium chloride.<br>
In one embodiment, the composition comprises one or more ionic strength modifying agents selected from the group consisting of calcium (Ca2+) salts and magnesium (Mg2+) salts, e.g. one or more salts selected from the group consisting of calcium chloride, calcium acetate, calcium gluconate, calcium laevulate, magnesium chloride, magnesium acetate, magnesium sulphate, magnesium gluconate, magnesium laevulate, magnesium salts of strong acids.<br>
In one embodiment, the Calcium (Ca2+) and/or Magnesium (Mg2+) is present in a concentration of at least about 0.1 µM, such as, e.g., at least about 0.5 µM, at least about 1 µM, at least about 5µM, at least about 10 µM, at least about 50 µM; at least about 100 µM, at least about 1 mM, at least about 2 mM, at least about 5 mM, or at least about 10mM. In a particular embodiment the composition comprises at least 2 mM Ca2+.<br>
In various embodiments, the molar ratio between calcium (Ca2+) and/or magnesium ions (Mg2+) and FVII polypeptide is: 0.001-750; 0.001-250; 0.001-100; 0.001-10; 0.001-1.0; 0.001-0.5; 0.5-750; 0.5-250; 0.5-100; 0.5-10; 0.5-1.0; 0.001-0.4999; 0.005-0.050.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the molar ratio of non-complexed calcium (Ca2+) and/or magnesium (Mg2+) to the Factor VII polypeptide is lower than 0.5, e.g. in the range of 0.001-0.499, such as 0.005-0.050, or in the range of 0.000-0.499, such as in the<br>
range of 0.000-0.050, or about 0.000. In one embodiment of the present invention, the molar ratio of non-complexed calcium (Ca2+) to the Factor VII polypeptide is lower than 0.5, e.g. in the range of 0.001-0.499, such as 0.005-0.050, or in the range of 0.000-0.499, such as in the range of 0.000-0.050, or about 0.000.<br>
When used herein, the term "the concentration of non-complexed calcium and/or magnesium ions" is intended to mean the difference between the total concentration of calcium and/or magnesium ions and the concentration of calcium and/or magnesium bound to calcium/magnesium chelators. In this regard, the Factor VII polypeptide is not regarded as a "calcium/magnesium chelator" although calcium and/or magnesium is expected to bind to, or become associated with, the Factor VII polypeptide under certain conditions.<br>
In another embodiment, the molar ratio of non-complexed calcium and/or magnesium ions to the Factor VII polypeptide is above 0.5. In another embodiment, the molar ratio of non-complexed calcium Ions to the Factor VII polypeptide is above 0.5.<br>
In order to obtain the low relative ratio between calcium and/or magnesium ions (Ca2+) and the Factor VII polypeptide, it may be necessary or desirable to remove excess calcium and/or magnesium ions, e.g., by contacting the composition with an Ion-exchange material under conditions suitable for removing Ca2+ and/or Mg2+, or to add a calcium/ magnesium chelator In order to bind (complex) excess calcium and/or magnesium ions. This Is particularly relevant where the ratio between calcium and/or magnesium ions and the Factor VII polypeptide in a solution from a process step preceding the formulation step exceeds the limit stated above. Examples of "calcium/magnesium chelators" Include EDTA, citric acid, NTA, DTPA, tartaric acid, lactic acid, malic acid, succinic acid, HIMDA, ADA and similar compounds.<br>

In particular embodiments, the composition does not include an antioxidant; Instead the susceptibility of the Factor VII polypeptide to oxidation is controlled by exclusion of atmospheric air. The use of an antioxidant may of course also be combined with the exclusion ' of atmospheric air.<br>
Thus, the present invention also provides an air-tight container (e.g. a vial or a cartridge (such as a cartridge for a pen applicator)) containing a liquid, aqueous pharmaceutical composition as defined herein, and optionally an inert gas.<br>
The inert gas may be selected from the groups consisting of nitrogen, argon, etc. The container (e.g. vial or cartridge) is typically made of glass or plastic, in particular glass, optionally closed by a rubber septum or other closure means allowing for penetration with preservation of the integrity of the pharmaceutical composition. In a particular embodiment hereof, the composition does not comprise a preservative (vii). In a further embodiment, the container is a vial or cartridge enclosed in a sealed bag, e.g. a sealed plastic bag, such as a laminated (e.g. metal (such as aluminium) laminated plastic bag).<br>
In addition to the mandatory components, the non-ionic surfactant (iv), the tonicity modifying agent (v) and the optional antioxidant (vi), the pharmaceutical composition may further comprise a preservative (vii).<br>

Examples of preservatives include phenol, benzyl alcohol, orto-cresol, meta-cresol, para-cresol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, benzalkonium chloride, and benzethonium chloride. The preservative is normally included at a concentration of 0.1-20 mg/mL depending on the pH range and type of preservative.<br>

Column temperature: 70°C. A-buffer: 0.1% v/v triflucracetic acid. B-buffer: 0.09% v/v trifluoracetic acid, 80% v/v acetonitrile. The column was eluted with a linear gradient from X to (X+13)% B in 30 minutes. X was adjusted so that FVIIa elutes with a retention time of approximately 26 minutes. Flow rate: 1.0 mL/min. Detection: 214 nm. Load: 25 µg FVIIa.<br>
The term "physical stability" of Factor VII polypeptides relates to the formation of insoluble and/or soluble aggregates in the form of dimeric, oligomeric and polymeric forms of Factor VII polypeptides as well as any structural deformation and denaturation of the molecule. Physically stable composition encompasses compositions which remains visually clear. Physical stability of the compositions is often evaluated by means of visual inspection and turbidity after storage of the composition at different temperatures for various time periods. Visual inspection of the compositions Is performed In a sharp focused light with a dark background. A composition Is classified as physically unstable, when it shows visual turbidity.<br>
The term "chemical stability" is intended to relate to the formation of any chemical change in the Factor VII polypeptides upon storage in solution at accelerated conditions. Examples are hydrolysis, deamidation and oxidation as well as enzymatic degradation resulting in formation of fragments of Factor VII polypeptides. In particular, the sulphur-containing amino acids are prone to oxidation with the formation of the corresponding sulphoxides.<br>
The term "chemically stable" is intended to designate a composition which retains at least 50% of its initial biological activity after storage for 6 months at 2 to 8CC, as measured by a one-stage clot assay (Assay 4).<br>

General methods<br>
Assays suitable for determining biological activity of Factor VII polypeptides<br>
Factor VII polypeptides useful in accordance with the present invention may be selected by suitable assays that can be performed as simple preliminary in vitro tests. Thus, the present specification discloses a simple test (entitled "In Vitro Hydrolysis Assay") for the activity of Factor VII polypeptides.<br>
In Vitro Hydrolysis Assay (Assay 1)<br>
Native (wild-type) Factor VIIa and Factor VII polypeptide (both hereinafter referred to as "Factor VIIa") may be assayed for specific activities. They may also be assayed in parallel to directly compare their specific activities. The assay is carried out in a microtiter plate (MaxiSorp, Nunc, Denmark). The chromogenic substrate D-Ile-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2288, Chromogenix, Sweden), final concentration 1 mM, is added to Factor VIIa (final concentration 100 nM) in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 M NaCI, 5 mM CaCI2 and 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin. The absorbance at 405 nm is measured continuously in a SpectraMax™ 340 plate reader (Molecular Devices, USA). The absorbance developed during a 20-minute incubation, after subtraction of the absorbance in a blank well containing no enzyme, is used for calculating the ratio between the activities of Factor VII polypeptide and wild-type Factor VIIa:<br>
Ratio = (A405 nm Factor VII polypeptide)/(A405 nm Factor VIIa wild-type).<br>
Based thereon, Factor VII polypeptides with an activity lower than, comparable to, or higher than native Factor VIIa may be identified, such as, for example, Factor VII polypeptides where the ratio between the activity of the Factor VII polypeptide and the activity of native Factor VII (wild-type FVII) is about 1.0 versus above 1.0.<br>
The activity of the Factor VII polypeptides may also be measured using a physiological substrate such as Factor X ("In Vitro Proteolysis Assay"), suitably at a concentration of 100-1000 nM, where the Factor Xa generated is measured after the addition of a suitable<br>
chromogenic substrate (eg. S-2765). In addition, the activity assay may be run at physiological temperature.<br>
In Vitro Proteolysis Assay (Assay 2)<br>
Native (wild-type) Factor VIIa and Factor VII polypeptide (both hereinafter referred to as 'Factor VIIa") are assayed in parallel to directly compare their specific activities. The assay is carried out in a microtiter plate (MaxISorp, Nunc, Denmark). Factor VIIa (10 nM) and Factor X (0.8 microM) in 100 µL 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 M NaCI, 5 mM CaCI2 and 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, are incubated for 15 min. Factor X cleavage is then stopped by the addition of 50 µL 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 M NaCI, 20 mM EDTA and 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin. The amount of Factor Xa generated is measured by the addition of the chromogenic substrate Z-D-Arg-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2765, Chromogenix, Sweden), final concentration 0.5 mM. The absorbance at 405 nm is measured continuously in a SpectraMax™ 340 plate reader (Molecular Devices, USA). The absorbance developed during 10 minutes, after subtraction of the absorbance in a blank well containing no FVIIa, is used for calculating the ratio between the proteolytic activities of Factor VII polypeptide and wild-type Factor VIIa:<br>
Ratio = (A405 nm Factor VII polypeptide)/(A405 nm Factor VIIa wild-type).<br>
Based thereon, Factor VII polypeptide with an activity lower than, comparable to, or higher than native Factor VIIa may be identified, such as, for example, Factor VII polypeptides where the ratio between the.activity of the Factor VII polypeptide and the activity of native Factor VII (wild-type FVII) is about 1.0 versus above 1.0.<br>
Thrombin generation Assay (Assay 3)<br>
The ability of Factor VIIa or Factor VII polypeptides to generate thrombin can also be measured in an assay (Assay 3) comprising all relevant coagulation Factors and inhibitors at physiological concentrations (minus Factor VIII when mimicking hemophilia A conditions) and activated platelets (as described on p. 543 in Monroe et al. (1997) Brit. J. Haematol. 99, 542-547, which is hereby incorporated herein as reference).<br>
One-stage Coagulation Assay (Clot Assay) (Assay 4)<br>
Factor VII polypeptides may also be assayed for specific activities ("clot activity") by using a a one-stage coagulation assay (Assay 4). For this purpose, the sample to be tested is diluted in 50 mM PIPES-buffer (pH 7.5), 0.1% BSA and 40 µl is incubated with 40 µl of Factor VII deficient plasma and 80 µl of human recombinant tissue factor containing 10 mM Ca2+ and synthetic phospholipids. Coagulation times (clotting times) are measured and compared to a standard curve using a reference standard in a parallel line assay.<br>
Preparation and purification of Factor VII polypeptides<br>
Human purified Factor VIIa suitable for use in the present Invention is preferably made by DNA recombinant technology, e.g. as described by Hagen et al., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci. USA 83: 2412-2416, 1986, or as described in European Patent No. 0 200 421 (ZymoGenetics, Inc.).<br>
Factor VII may also be produced by the methods described by Broze and Majerus, J.Biol.Chem. 255 (4): 1242-1247, 1980 and Hedner and Kisiel, J.CIin.Invest. 71: 1836-1841, 1983. These methods yield Factor VII without detectable amounts of other blood coagulation Factors. An even further purified Factor VII preparation may be obtained by including an additional gel filtration as the final purification step. Factor VII is then converted into activated Factor VIIa by known means, e.g. by several different plasma proteins, such as Factor Xlla, IX a or Xa. Alternatively, as described by Bjoern et al. (Research Disclosure, 269 September 1986, pp. 564-565), Factor VII may be activated by passing it through an ion-exchange chromatography column, such as Mono QΘ (Pharmacia fine Chemicals) or the like, or by autoactivation in solution.<br>
Factor VII-related polypeptides may be produced by modification of wild-type Factor VII or by recombinant technology. Factor VII-related polypeptides with altered amino acid sequence when compared to wild-type Factor VII may be produced by modifying the nucleic acid sequence encoding wild-type Factor VII either by altering the amino acid codons or by removal of some of the amino acid codons in the nucleic acid encoding the natural Factor VII by known means, e.g. by site-specific mutagenesis.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that substitutions can be made outside the regions critical to the function of the Factor VIIa molecule and still result In an active polypeptide. Amino acid residues essential to the activity of the Factor VII polypeptide, and therefore preferably not subject to substitution, may be identified according to procedures known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (see, e.g., Cunningham and Wells, 1989, Science 244: 1081-1085). In the latter technique, mutations are Introduced at every positively charged residue in the molecule, and the resultant mutant molecules are tested for coagulant, respectively cross-linking activity to identify amino acid residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule. Sites of substrate-enzyme interaction can also be determined by analysis of the three-dimensional structure as determined by such techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, crystallography or photoaffinity labelling (see, e.g., de Vos et al., 1992, Science 255: 306-312; Smith et al., 1992, Journal of Molecular Biology 224: 899-904; Wlodaver et al., 1992, FEBS Letters 309: 59-64).<br>
The introduction of a mutation into the nucleic acid sequence to exchange one nucleotide for another nucleotide may be accomplished by site-directed mutagenesis using any of the<br>
methods known in the art. Particularly useful is the procedure that utilizes a super-coiled, double-stranded DNA vector with an insert of Interest and two synthetic primers containing the desired mutation. The oligonucleotide primers, each complementary to opposite strands of the vector, extend during temperature cycling by means of Pfu DNA polymerase. On incorporation of the primers, a mutated plasmld containing staggered nicks is generated. Following temperature cycling, the product is treated with Dpnl which is specific for methylated and hemi-methylated DNA to digest the parental DNA template and to select for mutation-containing synthesized DNA. Other procedures known in the art for creating, identifying and isolating variants may also be used, such as, for example, gene shuffling or phage display techniques.<br>
Separation of polypeptides from their cell of origin may be achieved by any method known in the art, including, without limitation, removal of cell culture medium containing the desired product from an adherent cell culture; centrifugation or filtration to remove non-adherent cells; and the like.<br>
Optionally, Factor VII polypeptides may be further purified. Purification may be achieved using any method known in the art, including, without limitation, affinity chromatography, such as, e.g., on an anti-Factor VII antibody column (see, e.g., Wakabayasili et al., J. Biol. Chem. 261:11097, 1986; and Thim et al., Biochem. 27:7785, 1988); hydrophobic interaction chromatography; ion-exchange chromatography; size exclusion chromatography; electrophoretic procedures (e.g., preparative Isoelectric focusing (IEF), differential solubility (e.g., ammonium sulfate precipitation), or extraction and the like. See, generally, Scopes, Protein Purification, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1982; and Protein Purification, J.C. Janson and Lars Ryden, editors, VCH Publishers, New York, 1989. Following purification, the preparation preferably contains less than 10% by weight, more preferably less than 5% and most preferably less than 1%, of non-Factor VII polypeptides derived from the host cell.<br>
Factor VII polypeptides may be activated by proteolytic cleavage, using Factor Xlla or other proteases having trypsin-like specificity, such as, e.g., Factor IXa, kallikrein, Factor Xa, and thrombin. See, e.g., Osterud et al., Biochem. 11:2853 (1972); Thomas, U.S. Patent No. 4,456,591; and Hedner et al., J. Clin. Invest. 71:1836 (1983). Alternatively, Factor VII polypeptides may be activated by passing it through an ion-exchange chromatography column, such as Mono Q® (Pharmacia) or the like, or by autoactivation in solution. The resulting activated Factor VII polypeptide may then be formulated and administered as described in the present application.<br>
