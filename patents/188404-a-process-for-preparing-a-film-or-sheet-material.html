				<td>This invention relates to thermoplastic films, sheets and laminates and coextruded materials formed therefrom, and films and sheets formed from blends of an olefin polymer composition with other olefin polymer materials.<br>
In many film applications, such as packaging of foodstuffs, chemical and hazardous materials and in medical applications, the industry requires films having certain properties.  In the packaging of foodstuffs, for example, the films must have high puncture resistance, high clarity and gloss, and reduced permeability to gases and/or vapors.  The films used to manufacture containers for chemicals and hazardous waste materials must have a high puncture resistance, high elongation strength, high tear resistance and chemical resistance.  Films used in medical applications, such as blood bags, must have a high puncture resistance, low modulus, high tear resistance and auto-clavability.<br>
Films made from ethylene polymers, e.g., HOPE and LLDPE, and propylene polymers, such as crystalline homopolymers of propylene and random copolymers of propylene and ethylene, do not provide such a combination of desirable properties.<br>
Attempts have been made to overcome the shortcomings of these polymers by preparing heterophasic mixtures of crystalline propylene polymers and 8 to 25% of an elastomeric propylene-ethylene copolymer by sequential polymerization in the presence of a stereospecific Ziegler-Natta type catalyst.  However, films of such heterophasic compositions are subject to the formation of fisheyes, inadequate tear strength or the formation of rough surfaces.<br><br>
Hence/ there is a need for a polymer material which has a lower flezural modulus, high clarity-/ good tear strength/ as well as all of the other desirable properties. All parts and percentages used in this application are by weight unless otherwise specified.  Ambient or room temperature is approximately 25C.<br>
This invention provides a thermoplastic film having the desired properties comprising a heterophasic olefin polymer composition which is comprised of<br>
(a) from about 10 to 50 parts of a propylene homopolymer having an isotactic index greater than 80/ or a copolymer selected from the group consisting of (i) propylene and ethylene, (ii) propylene, ethylene and a CH2-CHR alpha-olefin, where R is a C2-8<br><br>
Straight or branched alkyl, and (iii) propylene and an alpha-olefin as defined in (a) (ii)/ said copolymer containing over 80% propylene and having an isotactic index greater than 80;<br><b from about to parts of a semi-crystalline essentially linear copolymer fraction having crystallinity wherein the is selected group consisting ethylene and propylene containing over an alpha-olefin as defined in both said which insoluble xylene at room or ambient temperature></b>
(c) from about 40 to 80 parts of a copolymer fraction is selected from the group consisting of a copolymer of (i) ethylene and propylene wherein the copolymer contains from 20% to less than 40% ethylene<br><br>
and, (ii) ethylene, propylene, and an alpha-olefin as defined in (a) (ii) wherein the alpha-olefin is present in an amount of 1 to 10% and the amount of ethylene and alpha-olefin present is from 20% to less than 40%, and (iii) ethylene and an alpha-olefin as defined in (a) (ii) containing from 20% to less than 40% of the alpha-olefin, and optionally with 0.5 to 10% of a diene, said copolymer fraction being soluble in xylene at ambient temperature, and having an intrinsic viscosity of from 1.5 to 4.0 dl/g; with the total of the (b) and (c) fractions, based on the total olefin polymer composition, being from about 50% to 90%, and the weight ratio of (b)/(c) being less than 0.4. In another embodiment this invention provides films comprising a layer of the heterophasic olefin polymer composition applied to at least one surface of a thermo¬plastic film material or a metallic substrate.<br>
In yet another embodiment films from blends of the olefin polymer composition and a thermoplastic material are provided.<br>
Component (a) is preferably present in an amount from 10 to 40 parts, most preferably from 20 to 35 parts. When (a) is a propylene homopolymer, the isotactic index is preferably from about 85 to 98. When (a) is a copolymer, the amount of propylene in the copolymer is preferably from about 90 to 99%.<br>
Component (b) is preferably present in an amount from 7 to 15 parts.  Typically the crystallinity is about 20 to 60% by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).  Generally, the ethylene or said alpha-olefin content or the combina¬tion of ethylene and said alpha-olefin when both are used is over 55% up to 98%, preferably from 80 to 95%.<br>
Component (c) is preferably present in an amount from 50 to 70 parts. The ethylene or said alpha-olefin content or ethylene and said alpha-olefin content of component (c)<br><br>
is preferably from 20 to 38%, most preferably from 25 to 38%.  When component (c) is a terpolymer, the said alpha-olefin is typically present in an amount from 1 to 10%, preferably 1 to 5%.  The preferred intrinsic viscosity of is from 1.7 to 3 dl/g.<br>
The total amount of (b) and (c),  based on the total olefin polymer composition is preferably from 65 to 80% and the weight ratio of (b)/(c) is preferably from 0.1 to about 0.3.<br>
The total amount of ethylene units or said alpha-olefin unitS/ or of ethylene and said alpha-olefin units when both are present, in the olefin polymer composition is from about 15% to about 35%.<br>
The compositions have at least one melt peak, deter¬mined by DSC, present at temperatures higher than 120°C, and at least one peak, relative to the vitreous transition, present at temperatures from -lO'C and -SS'C.<br>
In addition, these compositions have a flexural modulus of less than 150 MPa, generally from 20 and 100 MPa; a tensile strength at yield of from 10 to 20 MPa, elongation at break over 400%; a tension set, at 75% strain, from 20% to 50%; a Shore D hardness from 20 and 35; and do not break (no brittle impact failure) when an IZOD impact test is conducted at -50**C.<br>
Preferably the haze values are less than 40%, most preferably less than 35%.<br>
Copolymer and terpolymers of propylene and ethylene or an alpha-olefin or of propylene, ethylene and an alpha-olefin are preferred as component (a), and copolymers of propylene with ethylene or an alpha-olefin are most preferred as component (a) since they provide the compositions with higher clarity.<br>
Suitable alpha-olefins of the formula CH2-CHR include butene-1, pentene-1, 4-methylpentene-l, hexene-1, and octene-1.  When used to prepare component (a) they are<br><br>
Present in such quantities that the isotactic index of the resulting polymer is not less than 80%.<br>
When a diene is present during the preparation o£ components (b) and (c), it is typically a butadiene/ 1,4-hexadiene/ 1,5-hexadiene, ethylidene norbornene diene monomer and is typically present in amount from 0.5 to 10%, preferably 1 to 5%.<br>
The compositions can be prepared with a polymerization process comprising at least two stages, where in the first stage the propylene or propylene and ethylene or said alpha-olefin or propylene, ethylene or said alpha-olefin are polymerized to form component (a), and in the following stages the mixtures ethylene and propylene or said alpha-olefin or ethylene, propylene and said alpha-olefin, and optionally a diene, are polymerized to form components <b and></b>
The polymerization can be conducted in liquid phase, gas phase, or liquid-gas phase using separate reactors, all of which can be done either by batch or continuously.  For example, it is possible to carry out the polymerization of component (a) using liquid propylene as diluent, and the polymerization of components <b and in gas phase without intermediate stages except for the partial degas of propylene. this is preferred method.></b>
The polymerization reactions are carried out in an inert atmosphere in the presence of an inert hydrocarbon solvent or of a liquid or gaseous monomer.<br>
Suitable inert hydrocarbon solvents include saturated hydrocarbons, such as propane, butane, hexane and heptane.<br>
Hydrogen can be added as needed as a chain transfer agent for control of the molecular weight.<br>
The reaction temperature in the polymerization of component (a) and for the polymerization of components (b) and (c), can be the same or different, and is generally<br><br>
firora 40°C to 90°C, preferably 50 to 80'C for the polymer¬ization of component (a), and 40 to 35C for the polymeri¬zation of components (b) and (c).<br>
The pressure of the polymerization of component (a), if carried out in liquid monomer, is the one which competes with the vapor pressure of the liquid propylene at the operating temperature used, eventually modified by the vapor pressure of the small quantity of inert diluent used to feed the catalyst mixture, and the overpressure of optional monomers and the hydrogen used as molecular weight regulator.<br>
The pressure of the polymerization of components (b) and (c), if done in gas phase, can be from 5 to 30 atm. The residence times relative to the two stages depend on the desired ratio between fraction (a) and (b) + (c), and are usually from 15 min. to 8 hours.<br>
The catalyst used in the polymerization comprises the reaction product of 1) a solid component containing a halogen-containing titanium compound and an electron-donor compound (internal donor) supported on an activated magnesium chloride, 2) a non-halogen containing Al-trialkyl compound and 3) an electron-donor compound (external donor).<br>
Suitable titanium compounds include those with at least one Ti-halogen bond, such as halides and alkoxy halides of titanium.<br>
In order to obtain these olefin polymer compositions<br>
in the form of flowable spherical particles having a high<br>
bulk density, the solid catalyst component must have a) a<br>
2 surface area smaller than 100 m /g, preferably between 50<br>
2 and 80 m /g, b) a porosity from 0.25 to 0.4 cc/g. and c)<br>
an X-ray spectrum, where the magnesium chloride reflections<br>
appear, showing the presence of a halo between the angles<br>
2   of 33.5° and 35° and by the absence of the reflection<br>
at 2   of 14.95".  The symbol   - Bragg angle.<br><br>
The solid catalyst component is prepared by forming an adduct of magnesium dichloride and an alcohol, such as ethanol, propanoic butanol and 2-ethylhexanol, containing generally 3 moles of alcohol per mole of MgCl2/ emulsifying the adduct/ cooling the emulsion quickly to cause the adduct to solidify into spherical particles, and partially dealcoholating the particulate adduct by gradually increasing the temperature from 50C to 130°C for a period of time sufficient to reduce the alcohol content from 3 moles to 1-1.5 moles per mole of MgCl2-  The partially dealcoholated adduct is then suspended in TiCl4 at 0°C, such that the concentration of adduct to TiCl4 is 40-50 g/1 TiCl4.  The mixture is then heated to a temperature of 80°C to 135C for a period of about 1-2 hr. When the temperature reaches 40°C, sufficient electron donor is added so that the desired molar ratio of Mg to electron donor is obtained.<br>
An electron-donor compound selected preferably among<br>
the alkyl, cycloalkyl, and aryl phthalates, such as for<br>
example diisobutyl, di-n-butyl, and di-n-octyl phthalate,<br>
is added to the TiCl..<br>
4<br>
When the heat treatment period has ended, the excess hot TiCl. is separated by filtration or sedimentation, and the treatment with TiCl. is repeated one or more times.  The solid is then washed with a suitable inert hydrocarbon compound, such as hexane or heptane, and dried.<br>
The solid catalyst component typically has the following characteristics:<br>
2<br>
Surface area:	less than 100 m /g,<br>
preferably between 50 and<br>
80 m2/g<br>
Porosity:	0.25 - 0.4 cc/g<br><br>
Pdte  volume distribution:   50% of the pores have a radius<br>
greater than 100 angstroms.<br>
X-ray spectrum:	where the Mg chloride<br>
reflections appear, showing a halo with maximum intensity between angles of 2   of 33.5° and 35°/ and where the reflection at 2   of 14.95° is absent.<br>
The catalyst is obtained by mixing the solid catalyst component with a trialkyl aluminum compound, preferably triethyl aluminum and triisobutyl aluminum, and an electron-donor compound.<br>
Various electron donor compounds are known in the art.  The preferred electron donor compounds are those silane compounds having the formula R'R"Si(0R)2 where R' and R" may be the same or different and are C1-18 normal or branched alkyl, C5-18 cycloalkyl, or C6-18 aryl radicals, and R is a C1-4 alkyl radical.<br>
Typical silane compounds which may be used include diphenyldimethoxysilane, dicyelohexyldimethoxysilane, methyl-t-butyldimethoxysilane, diisopropyldimethoxysilane, dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane, cyclohexylmethyldimethoxy-silane and phenyltrimethoxysilane.<br>
The Al/Ti ratio is typically between 10 and 200 and the Al/silane molar ratio between 1/1 and 1/100.<br>
The catalysts may be precontacted with small quantities of olefin monomer (prepolymerization), main¬taining the catalyst in suspension in a hydrocarbon solvent and polymerizing at a temperature from room temperature to 60°C for a time sufficient to produce a quantity of polymer from 0.5 to 3 times the weight of the catalyst.<br><br>
f<br>
This prepolymerization also can be done in liquid or gaseous monomer to produce, in this case, a quantity of polymer up to 1000 times the catalyst weight.<br>
The content and amount of catalyst residue in the thermoplastic olefin polymers of this invention is sufficiently small so as to make the removal of catalyst residue, typically referred to as deashing, unnecessary.<br>
The thermoplastic olefin polymers prepared with the aforementioned catalyst are in spheroidal particle form, and the particles have a diameter from 0.5 to 7 mm.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, the following analytical methods are used to characterize the supported catalyst component, the heterophasic olefin polymer compositions, films prepared therefrom and comparative film materials.<br><br><br><br>
Unless otherwise specified, the samples of the olefin polymer composition to be subjected to the various physical-mechanical analyses are molded by use of a Negri &amp; Bossi 90 injection press, after stabilizing the material with 0.1% Irganox 1010 tetrakis[methylene 3,5-di-tert-butyl--4-hy-droxyhydrocinnamate)] methane and 0.1% BHT (2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol), and pelletizing it with a single screw Bandera extruder (cylinder diameter 30 mm) at 210C. The analytical conditions are as follows:<br>
temperature of the melt 250C<br>
temperature of the mold 60°C<br>
injection time 20 sec<br>
cooling time 25 sec. The samples to be subjected to the Haze analysis are molded into 75x75x1 mm plaques using a GBF F 235/90 injection press under the following conditions:<br><br>
temperature of the melt 260C<br>
temperature of the mold 40C<br>
injection time 20 sec<br>
cooling time 10 sec. The samples of the film materials were 1 mil in thickness and ware cut from the film sheet in the size provided in the particular ASTM test method being used.<br>
The weight percentage of the sum of the (b) and (c) fractions, indicated by % (b) + (c), is calculated by-determining the weight of the mixture fed during the second stage, and comparing it with the weight of the final product.<br><br><br><br>
The weight percent of olefin polymer composition soluble in xylene at room temperature is determined by dissolving 2.5 g of the polymer in 250 ml of xylene in a vessel equipped with a stirrer which is heated at 135C with agitation for 20 minutes. The solution is cooled to 25C while continuing the agitation, and then left to stand without agitation for 30 minutes so that the solids can settle.  The solids are filtered with filter paper, the remaining solution is evaporated by treating it with a nitrogen stream, and the solid residue is vacuum dried at 80C until a constant weight is reached. The percent by weight of polymer insoluble in xylene at room temperature is the isotactic index of the polymer.  The value obtained in this manner corresponds substantially to the isotactic index determined via extraction with boiling n-heptane, which by definition constitutes the isotactic index of the polymer.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for preparing a film or sheet material comprising the extrusion of a blend prepared by mixing<br>
(l)from 5 to 45% an olefin polymer composition which is comprised of<br>
(d)from 10 to 50 parts of a propylene homopolymer having an isotactic index greater than 80, or a copolymer selected from the group consisting of (i) propylene and ethylene, (ii) propylene, ethylene and a CH2=CHR alpha-olefin, where R is a C2-8 straight or branched alkyl, and (iii) propylene and an alpha-olefin as defined in (ii), said copolymer containing over 80% propylene and having an isotactic index greater than 80;<br>
(e)	from 5 to 20 parts of a semicrystalline, essentially linear<br>

both ethylene and alpha-olefin, and (iii) ethylene and an alpha-<br>
olefin as defined in (aXii) containing over 55% of said alpha-<br>
olefin, which copolymer is insoluble in xylene at room or<br>
ambient temperature; and<br>
(f)	from 40 to 80 parts of a copolymer fraction wherein the<br>
copolymer is selected from the group consisting of (i)<br>
ethylene and propylene containing from 20% t less than 40%<br>
ethylene, (ii) ethylene, propylene, and an alpha-olefin as<br><br>
defined in (a) (ii) wherein the alpha-olefin is present in an amount of 1 to 10% and the amount of ethylene and alpha-olefin present is from 20% to less than 40%, and (iii) ethylene and an alpha-olefin as defined in (a) (ii) containing from 20% to less than 40% of said alpha-olefin, and optionally with 0.5 to 10% of a diene, said copolymer fraction being soluble in xylene  at  ambient temperature,   and  having  an  intrinsic viscosity of from 1.5 to 4.0 dl/g; with the total of the (b) and (c) fractions, based on the total olefin polymer composition, being from 50% to 90%, and the weight ratio of (b)/(c) being less than 0.4; with (2)from 95 to 55% of a crystalline homopolymer of a C2-10 alpha-olefin monomer or of a copolymer selected from the group consisting of (i) propylene with ethylene, (ii) propylene with ethylene and a C4-10 alpha-olefin monomer and (iii) propylene with a C4-10 alpha-olefin monomer, provided that, when the comonomer is ethylene, the maximum polymerized ethylene content is about 10%, when the comoner is a C4-10 alpha-olefin monomer, the maximum polymerized content is about 20% and when the comonomers are ethylene and a C4-10 alpha-olefin monomer, the maximum polymerized content of both is about 30%.<br>
Example illustrative of the heterophasic olefin polymer composition, physical properties thereof, a process for preparing same, a film based on said olefin polymer composition and a method of preparing said film are set forth below.<br><br>
Solid Catalyst Component<br>
A)  Preparation of MgCl2/Alcohol Adduct<br>
Under an inert atmosphere, 28.4 g anhydrous MgCl2 49.5 g of an anhydrous ethanol, 100 ml of ROL OB/30 vaseline oil and 100 ml of silicone oil having a viscosity of 350 cs are introduced into a reaction vessel equipped with a stirrer and heated at 120°C with an oil bath and stirred until the MgCl- is dissolved. The hot reaction mixture is then transferred under inert atmosphere to a 1500 ml vessel equipped with an Ultra Turrax T-45 N stirrer and a heating jacket and containing 150 ml of vaseline oil and 150 ml of silicone oil.  The temperature is maintained at 120»C with stirring for 3 minutes at 3,000 rpm.  The mixture is then discharged into a 2 liter vessel equipped with a stirrer containing 1,000 ml of anhydrous n-heptane cooled at O'C with a dry ice/isopar bath and stirred at a tip speed of 6 m/sec for about 20 minutes while maintaining the temperature at 0°C. The adduct particles thus formed are recovered by filtering, are washed 3 times at room temperature with 500 ml aliquots of anhydrous hexane and gradually heated by increasing the temperature from 50°C to lOO'C under nitrogen for a period of time sufficient to reduce the alcohol content from 3 moles to 1.5 moles per<br>
mole of MgCl,. The adduct has a surface area of 9.1<br>
2 m /g and a bulk density of 0.564 g/cc.<br>
B)  Solid Catalyst Component Preparation<br>
The adduct 
 <br>
molar ratio of Mg to diisobutylphthalate is 8. The<br>
contents of the vessel are heated at lOOC for 2 hours with<br>
agitation, the agitation is stopped and the solids are<br>
allowed to settle.  The hot liquid is removed by siphon.<br>
550 ml of TiCl4 is added to the solids in the vessel and<br>
the mixture heated at 120C for 1 hr. with agitation. The<br>
agitation is stopped and the solids are allowed to settle.<br>
The hot liquid is then removed by siphon.  The solids are<br>
washed 6 times at 60°C with 200 ml aliquots of anhydrous<br>
hexane, and then 3 times at room temperature.  The solids,<br>
after being vacuum dried, have a porosity of 0.261 cc/g, a<br>
2 surface area of 66.5 m /g and a bulk density of 0.44 g/cc.<br>
Examples 1-3<br>
These examples illustrate the heterophasic olefin<br>
polymer composition and a method for preparing the polymers.<br>
General Operating Conditions The polymerization runs are conducted under nitrogen in a 22 liter stainless steel autoclave equipped with a helicoid magnetic stirrer and operated at about 90 rpm. All temperatures, pressures and concentrations of olefin monomers and hydrogen, when present, are constant unless otherwise indicated.  The concentration of hydrogen and of the relative monomers is analyzed continuously in gas phase with a process gas chromatograph and fed in order to maintain constant the desired concentration of same.<br>
The polymerization is a batch process conducted in two stages. The first stage comprising the polymerization of the relevant monomer or monomers in liquid propylene and the second stage the copolymerization of ethylene and propylene in gas phase.<br>
In the first stage, the following ingredients in the order in which they are listed are fed into the autoclave at 20°C over a period of about 10 minutes:  16 1 of liquid<br><br>
propylene, appropriate quantities of ethylene and hydrogen, and the catalyst system consisting of 1) the solid catalyst component (about O.15g) prepared as described above, and 2) a mixture of 75 ml of triethyl aluminum (TEAL) at a 10% concentration in hezane and an appropriate quantity of eyelohexylmethyldimethoxysilane (CMMS) electron donor such that the Al/CMMS molar ratio is 7.5.  The catalyst system is pressure fed into the autoclave with propylene.<br>
The temperature is brought to the desired level in I about 10 minutes and maintained constant throughout the entire polymerization reaction period. After the established reaction time has passed, essentially all of the unreacted monomer(s) is/are eliminated by degassing at 60C at essentially atmospheric pressure.<br>
In the second stage, the polymer product (a) of the first stage, afttsr taking a sample for the various analyses, is brought to the established temperature for the second stage.  Propylene and ethylene are then fed into the autoclave at the ratio and in the quantities established in order to achieve the pressure and the gas phase composition desired.  During the polymerization the pressure and gas phase composition are maintained by feeding the propylene and ethylene mixture established by way of instruments which regulate or measure or both regulate and measure the flow rate.  The length of the feed varied according to the catalyst system employed and the amount of components b) and c) desired in the particular heterophasic olefin polymer product.<br>
At the end of the second stage polymerization reaction the powder is discharged, stabilized and then oven dried under a nitrogen stream at 60°C.<br>
The ingredients and relative operating conditions are set forth in Table lA and the tests results are set forth in Table IB.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Examples 4<br>
These examples illustrate a film material of the heterophasic olefin polymer composition and a method for preparing the same.<br>
An air quenched blown film of the heterophasic olefin polymer composition of Example 2 stabilized with 0.25 parts per hundred parts of the olefin polymer composition (pph) octadecyl-3/5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxybenzene propanoate, 0.05 pph tetrakis[methylene(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate)] methane, 0.06 pph Sandostab P-EPQ composition, the main component of which is tetrakis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)-4-4'-biphenylene diphosphonite and 0.05 calcium stearate is prepared by charging the composition into a single screw extruder, extruding it through a circular die and blowing it into a film form with a sufficient amount of air to provide a film of 1 mil thickness using the following equipment and processing conditions:<br><br><br><br><br>
From the above Table one can see that the olefin polymer composition of this invention provides an air quenched blown film with improved elongation at break and Elemendorf tear properties and a better balance of properties.  Further, polymer materials, the major portion of which comprise propylene units, generally do not run well, if at all, on air quenched blown film equipment.<br>

This example illustrates an cast film material of the heterophasic olefin polymer composition, of a coextruded film of the heterophasic olefin polymer composition and a random copolymer of propylene and ethylene and a method for preparing same.<br>
A cast film of the heterophasic olefin polymer composition of Example 2 stabilized as set forth in Example 4 is prepared by charging the composition into an extruder, extruding it through a flat film die and quenching onto a chill roll to produce a film of 1 mil thickness using the following equipment and processing conditions;<br>
Screw design:  Compression ratio:  4:1 to 3:1<br>
Feed zone depth:  0.435 to 0.490" (3.5" extruder with 3.5:1 compression ratio) Metering zone depth:  0.125 to 0.140" for 3.5" extruder<br>
Die:  Convention center-fed coathanger manifold.<br>
Extruder operating conditions:<br>
Melt temperature:  430-500°F<br>
Extruder Barrel:  350-420°F going from zone 1 to zone 6.<br>
Adapter and die temperatures:  420'F<br>
A coextruded film 1.25 mils thick comprising a film layer of the heterophasic olefin polymer composition of Example 2 stabilized as set forth in Example 4 as the center layer, and two film layers of Pro-fax SA 861 propylene-ethylene random copolymer with an ethylene<br><br>
content of 3.0%/ one layer of said copolymer on each surface of the center layer is prepared by the cast film technique.<br>
The properties of the resulting film are set forth in Table 3 below.<br><br>
From the above Table one can see that the olefin polymer composition of this invention provides an cast film and a coextruded cast filrae with improved elongation at yield and Elemendorf tear properties.<br><br>
Various types of film materials of conventional thickness and thin films less than 20 mils thick to as thin as about 0.5 mils can be prepared using the heterophasic olefin polymer composition described herein as well as heavy film materials, typically referred to as sheets, from 20 to 100 mils thick.  For example, it can be used to prepare cast films, uniaxially and biaxially oriented films and extruded or calendared sheets.  In addition, a layer comprising the heterophasic olefin polymer composition can be applied to, e.g. by lamination or coextrusion techniques, at least one surface of a thermoplastic film material or a metallic sheet or foil substrate.  Typical thermoplastic materials include crystalline homopolymers of a C2-10 alpha-olefin monomer, such as propylene or ethylene, or copolymers of propylene with ethylene or with a C4-10 alpha-olefin monomers or of propylene with both ethylene and a C4-10 alpha-olefin monomers, provided that, when the comonomer is ethylene, the maximum polymerized ethylene content is about 10%, preferably about 4%, and when the comonomer is a C4-10 olefin, the maximum polymerized content thereof is about 20%, preferably about 16%, and when both ethylene and an alpha-olefin are used the maximum polymerized content of both is 30%, preferably 20%, as well as polyesters, polyamides, ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymers and ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers. Aluminum is a suitable metallic substrate.<br>
In addition, film materials can be prepared from blends of from about 5 to 45% of the heterophasic olefin polymer composition described herein with from about 95 to 55% of a crystalline homopolymer of a C2-10 alpha-olefin nonomer or copolymer of propylene with ethylene or with a C4-10 alpha-olefin monomer or of propylene, ethylene and   C4-10 alpha-olefin monomer, said copolymer having the naximum polymerized content of ethylene or alpha-olefin or both as described in the preceding paragraph.  Preferably<br><br>
the amount of the heterophasic olefin polymer composition present in such blends is from 10 to 30%.<br>
The olefin polymer composition of this invention is such that one can achieve the proper balance of properties in the resulting product when a film layer of same is the material applied to at least one surface of another thermoplastic material or to a metallic substrate and when it is blended with another thermoplastic material and the blend is used to make film materials.<br>
Other features, advantages and embodiments of the invention disclosed herein will be readily apparent to those exercising ordinary skill after reading the foregoing disclosures. In this regard, while specific embodiments of the invention have been described in considerable detail, variations and modifications of these embodiments can be effected without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as described and claimed.<br>
