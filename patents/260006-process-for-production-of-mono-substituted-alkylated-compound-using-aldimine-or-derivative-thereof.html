				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Process for production of mono-substituted alkylated compound using<br>
aldimine or derivative thereof<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to methods for producing<br>
mono-substituted alkylated compounds of a-amino acids using aldimine<br>
or a derivative thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
α-Amino acids have significant biochemical importance, and are<br>
frequently used as a raw material for drugs such as antibiotics,<br>
antineoplastic agents, and enzyme inhibitors. There are natural and<br>
non-naturally occurring a-amino acids, and many useful a-amino acids of<br>
both types have been found. In recent years, there have been a series of<br>
discoveries of non-naturally occurring, beneficial physiologically active<br>
amino acids such as L-dopa and Lrazatyrosine, and there is a need for<br>
research into the practical asymmetrical synthesis of such<br>
optically-active a-amino acids.<br>
One option for the practical asymmetrical synthesis of<br>
optically-active a-amino acids is asymmetrical mono-substitution<br>
alkylation. In conventional practice, it has been common to use a<br>
ketimine-type Schiff base for asymmetrical mono-substitution alkylation<br>
(O'Donnell, M. J. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1989, vol. Ill, p.2353).<br>
Ketimine-type Schiff bases are complex to manufacture and thus<br>
generally  are  expensive.     This  has  caused  a-amino   acids  that  are<br>
1<br><br>
produced by asymmetrical mono-substitution alkylation to be expensive<br>
as well.<br>
The reason why ketimine-type Schiff bases are used shall be<br>
explained based on the characteristics of ketimine-type Schiff bases that<br>
contribute to the reaction. Schiff bases include ketimine-type Schiff<br>
bases and aldimine-type Schiff bases, for example. In general, it is<br>
strongly believed that aldimine-type Schiff bases result in a racemization<br>
of the product because there is almost no pKa difference between the<br>
secondary hydrogen and the tertiary hydrogen, whereas ketimine-type<br>
Schiff bases inhibit racemization of the product obtained because this<br>
difference is large (O'Donnell, M. J., Aldrichim. Ada., 2001, vol. 34, p.3,<br>
and Maruoka, K. and Ooi, T., Chemical Reviews, 2003, vol. 103, p.3013).<br>
Thus, in this technical field, based on the presumption that<br>
ketimine-type Schiff bases will be used in consideration of the overall<br>
production efficiency, even though production costs are somewhat higher,<br>
attention has been focused on optimizing the methods for asymmetrical<br>
synthesis of optically active a-amino acids using ketimine-type Schiff<br>
bases.<br><br>
On the other hand, recently, there was a report of an example of<br>
2<br><br>
asymmetrical synthesis using macromolecular aldimine (Park, H. "G. et<br>
al., J. Org. Chem., 2005, vol. 70, p.1904). However, this report pertains<br>
to asymmetrical synthesis using a compound obtained by binding<br>
aldimine to a macromolecule, and is quite different from the Schiff bases<br>
of the technical field.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for<br>
producing mono-substituted alkylated compounds that are useful for<br>

It should be noted that in the present invention, if a quaternary<br>
ammonium, salt having a biphenyl backbone and/or binaphthyl backbone<br>
represented by the following formula:<br><br>
of the quaternary ammonium salts having a biphenyl backbone and/or<br>
binaphthyl backbone of the present invention, is used, then R23 and R24<br>
are each independently a monovalent organic group, and preferably are a<br>
C1 to C12 alkyl group that may be branched or form a cyclic group and<br>
that may be substituted with a halogen atom, or a C13 to C30 alkyl group<br>
that may be branched or form a cyclic group and that may be substituted<br>
with a halogen atom.<br>
In the present invention, the method for producing a quaternary<br>
ammonium phase-transfer catalyst that is represented by the following<br>
formula:<br><br>
69<br><br><br>
(where R21, R22, and X are the same as defined above) of the quaternary<br>
ammonium salts having a biphenyl backbone and/or binaphthyl<br>
backbone is well known (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.<br>
2001-48866 and Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.<br>
2002-326992).<br>
Alternatively, a quaternary ammonium phase-transfer catalyst<br>
that has a binaphthyl backbone that is represented by the following<br>
formula: <br>
(where R21, R22, R23, R24, and X are the same as defined above) can be<br>
produced by, for example, reacting a binaphthyl compound represented<br>
by the following formula:<br><br>
(where R21 and R22 are the same as defined above, and Z is a halogen<br>
atom) with a secondary amine represented by the following formula:<br><br>
70<br><br>
(where R23 and R24 are the same as defined above) in an organic solvent<br>
in the presence of an acid-scavenging agent.<br>
The above binaphthyl compound can be easily prepared from, for<br>
example, easily available l,l'-binaphthyl-2,2'"dicarboxylic acid (see Seki,<br>
M. et al., Synthesis, 2000, p.1677) in a known process as described in the<br>
Scheme 1 below (see Ooi, T. et al., J. Org. Chem., 2003, vol. 68, p.4577).<br>
The l,l'-binaphthyl-2,2'-dicarboxylic acid may be either the (S)-form or<br>
the (R)-form.<br>
The following is a more specific explanation based on Scheme 1<br>
above. First, the dicarboxylic acid (a) is converted to a corresponding<br>
diisopropyl ester (b) using isopropyl bromide, a catalyst Bu4N*HSO4, and<br>
KF*2H2O. The obtained compound (b) is treated with magnesium<br>
bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperamide) (hereinafter, referred to as<br>
Mg(TMP)2), and then Br2 is added to obtain 3,3'-dibromo-l,l'-dinaphthyl-<br>
2,2'-dicarboxylic acid ester (c). Then, the obtained compound (c) and<br>
3,4,5-trifluorophenylboronic acid are subjected to a Suzuki-Miyaura<br>
cross-coupling    reaction    in    the    presence    of   palladium    acetate,<br>
71<br><br>
triphenylphosphine, and potassium carbonate to give 3,3'-bis(3,4,5-<br>
trifluorophenyl)-l,l'-binaphthyl-2,2'-dicarboxylic acid ester (d).<br>
Furthermore, this compound (d) is reduced with LiAlEU to obtain alcohol<br>
(e) and the obtained alcohol (e) is treated with PBr3, so that it is possible<br>
to obtain the dibromide (f) that corresponds to the above binaphthyl<br>
compound.<br>
On the other hand, a large number of the secondary amines<br>
described above are commercially available and therefore can be<br>
obtained easily, so that it is possible to suitably select the secondary<br>
amine.<br>
Examples of the organic solvent used include nitrile solvents (e.g.,<br>
acetonitrile, propionitrile), ether solvents (e.g., dioxane, tetrahydrofuran,<br>
isopropyl ether, diethyl ether, dimethoxyethane, 2-methoxyethyl ether,<br>
cyclopentylmetyl ether), and alcohol solvents (e.g., methanol, ethanol,<br>
n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, tert-butanol), and acetonitrile is<br>
particularly preferable. Examples of acid-scavenging agents include<br>
inorganic bases such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate,<br>
potassium hydrogencarbonate, and sodium hydrogencarbonate.<br>
In the reaction, the secondary amine is preferably used in 0.5 to 4<br>
equivalents, and more preferably 0.8 to 2 equivalents, with respect to the<br>
binaphthyl compound. The acid-scavenging agent is preferably used in<br>
1 to 4 equivalents, and more preferably approximately 1 to 2 equivalents,<br>
with respect to the binaphthyl compound. The binaphthyl compound<br>
and the secondary amine are reacted in the presence of the<br>
acid-scavenging agent in an appropriate organic solvent with stirring.<br>
The reaction temperature is preferably between room temperature and<br>
the boiling point of the organic solvent, and more preferably the reaction<br>
72<br><br>
is performed while heating under reflux. The reaction time is<br>
preferably 30 minutes to 24 hours, and more preferably 6 to 12 hours.<br>
In this case, the organic solvent is used in amounts at a ratio of volume<br>
(mL)/mass (g) of the binaphthyl compound the ratio is preferably 5 to 50<br>
times, and more preferably 5 to 30 times. After the reaction is finished,<br>
the reaction mixture is extracted with dichloromethane, dichloroethane,<br>
or chloroform, for example, and isolated and purified by silica gel column<br>
chromatography, so that a binaphthyl-type quaternary ammonium salt<br>
can be obtained. Alternatively, the reaction mixture may be used as is<br>
as a phase-transfer catalyst in the method for producing a<br>
mono-substituted alkylated compound described in detail later.<br>
Alternatively, a quaternary ammonium phase-transfer catalyst<br>
that has a biphenyl backbone, represented by the following formula^<br><br>
(where R21, R22, R23, R24, R25, R25&gt;, R26, R26', R27, R27', and X are the same<br>
as defined above) can be produced by, for example, reacting a biphenyl<br>
compound represented by the following formula:<br><br>
73<br><br>
(where R21, R22, R25, R25', R26, R26', R27, R27', and Z are the same as<br>
defined above) with a secondary amine represented by the following<br>
formula"- <br>
(where R23 and R24 are the same as defined above) in an organic solvent<br>
in the presence of an acid-scavenging agent.<br>
The above biphenyl compound can be synthesized using the first<br>
method or the second method outlined below, for example.<br>
The first method is shown in Scheme 2.<br><br>
Reffering to the above Scheme 2, first, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic<br>
acid (for example, commercially available from Aldrich) is dissolved in an<br>
organic solvent (such as chloroform) and then N-bromosuccinimide (NBS)<br>
is added thereto and heated under reflux. Thus, the compound is<br>
bromated at position 2. Next, the brominated compound is converted to<br>
an acid chloride by (i) reacting it with SOCl2 and then (ii) reacting with<br>
(S)- or (R)-l,l'-bi-2-naphthol in a solvent, such as THF, to give a<br>
dibenzoyloxybinaphthyl compound.     It  should be  noted that in this<br>
74<br><br>
reaction, by using either (S)-l,l'-bi-2-naphthol or (R)-l,1-bi-2-naphthol it<br>
is possible to easily select for the absolute configuration (S-form or<br>
R-form)   of the   above  biphenyl  compound,   through  the  procedure<br>
discussed later.   Then, the dibenzoyloxybinaphthyl compound obtained<br>
above is reacted with active copper powder suspended in an organic<br>
solvent (such as DMF) while heating under reflux to effect intramolecule<br>
coupling.     The  coupled compound is   added to  a  THF  suspension<br>
containing lithium aluminum hydride and the mixture was stirred for a<br>
predetermined time, so that it is possible to obtain a biphenyldimethanol<br>
compound.      The   biphenyldimethanol   compound  is   reacted   with   a<br>
halogenating agent, such as phosphorus tribromide (PBr3), to obtain the<br>
above biphenyl compound,  in which R21 and R22 both are hydrogen<br>
atoms.<br>
In the present invention, in order to obtain an above biphenyl<br>
compound in which R21 and R22 are groups other than a hydrogen atom,<br>
it is possible to produce the biphenyl compound through the procedure<br>
detailed in Scheme 3 below. It should be noted that for the sake of<br>
simplicity, a case in which R21 and R22 are identical is described.<br><br>
75<br><br>
Reffering to the above Scheme 3, the obtained biphenyl compound<br>
is dehalogenated using means ordinarily used in the art. Then, the<br>
dehalogenated compound is dissolved in an organic solvent such as<br>
pyridine, and bromide is added thereto, so that it can be converted to a<br>
compound brominated at positions 5 and 5'. This compound is then<br>
subjected to the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction with at least one type<br>
of boronic acid derivative represented by R21-B(OH)2 or R22-B(OH)2<br>
(where R21 and R22 are each independently the same as the groups<br>
defined above) in an organic solvent such as THF and in the presence of<br>
a palladium catalyst. A specific example of the boronic acid derivative<br>
is 3,4,5-trifluorophenylboronic acid. The compound in which the<br>
bromine atoms at positions 5 and 5' have been substituted with an R21<br>
group or an R22 group is produced. The obtained compound is finally<br>
halogenated by means ordinarily used in the art, so that it is possible to<br>
produce a biphenyl compound in which R21 (and/or R22) is a group other<br>
than a hydrogen atom.<br>
Next, a second method for synthesizing the biphenyl compound is<br>
described.<br>
The second method uses a commercially available ellagic acid as a<br>
starting material. In other words, it is possible to obtain an optically<br>
active form of the dicarboxylic acid compound represented by the<br>
following formula^ <br>
using the method of 0. T. Schmidt et al. (O. T. Schmidt, K. Demmler, and<br>
76<br><br>
Justus Liebigs, Ann. Chem., 1952, vol. 576, p.85) using this starting<br>
material. According to this method, it is possible to selectively produce<br>
either the S-form or the R-form of the dicarboxylic acid compound. The<br>
above biphenyl compound is then produced through the procedure<br>
detailed in Scheme 4 below. It should be noted that for the sake of<br>
simplicity, a case in which R21 and R22 are identical is described.<br><br>
Reffering to the above Scheme 4, the dicarboxylic acid moiety of<br>
the obtained dicarboxylic acid compound is converted to dimethanol in<br>
an organic solvent, such as THF, using BH3*Me2S. Next, this<br>
dimethanol compound is reacted with bromine in an organic solvent,<br>
such as pyridine, to produce a compound that is brominated at positions<br>
5 and 5'. This compound is subjected to the SuzukrMiyaura coupling<br>
reaction with at least one type of boronic acid derivative represented by<br>
R21-B(OH)2 or R22-B(OH)2 (where R21 and R22 are each independently the<br>
same as the groups defined above) in an organic solvent, such as THF,<br>
and in the presence of a palladium catalyst.   A specific example of the<br>
77<br><br>
boronic acid derivative is 3,4,5-trifluorophenylboronic acid. Thus, the<br>
dimethanol compound in which bromine atoms at positions 5 and 5' are<br>
substituted with an R21 group or an R22 group is produced. The<br>
obtained compound is finally reacted with a halogenating agent, such as<br>
phosphorus tribromide (PBr3), so that it is possible to convert this to the<br>
above biphenyl compound, in which R21 (and/or R22) is a group other than<br>
a hydrogen atom.<br>
The secondary amine used in the process for producing a<br>
quaternary ammonium phase-transfer catalyst having a biphenyl<br>
backbone is the same as that used in the process for producing a<br>
quaternary ammonium phase-transfer catalyst having a binaphthyl<br>
backbone discussed above.<br>
The organic solvents used in the process for producing a<br>
quaternary ammonium phase-transfer catalyst having a biphenyl<br>
backbone by using the above biphenyl compound and the secondary<br>
amine are the same as in the case of the quaternary ammonium<br>
phase-transfer catalyst having a binaphthyl backbone, and include<br>
nitrile solvents (e.g., acetonitrile, propionitrile), ether solvents (e.g.,<br>
dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, isopropyl ether, diethyl ether,<br>
dimethoxyethane, 2-methoxyethyl ether, and cyclopentylmetyl ether),<br>
and alcohol solvents (e.g., methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol,<br>
n-butanol, and tert-butanol), and in particular, acetonitrile is preferable.<br>
Examples of acid-scavenging agents include inorganic bases such as<br>
potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium hydrogencarbonate,<br>
and sodium hydrogencarbonate.<br>
In the reaction, the secondary amine is preferably used in 0.5 to 4<br>
equivalents, and more preferably 0.8 to 2 equivalents, with respect to the<br>
78<br><br>
biphenyl compound. The acid-scavenging agent is preferably used at 1<br>
to 4 equivalents, and more preferably approximately 1 to 2 equivalents,<br>
with respect to the biphenyl compound. The biphenyl compound and<br>
the secondary amine are reacted in the presence of the acid-scavenging<br>
agent in an appropriate organic solvent with stirring. The reaction<br>
temperature is preferably between room temperature and the boiling<br>
point of the organic solvent, and more preferably the reaction is<br>
performed while heating under reflux. The reaction time is preferably<br>
30 minutes to 24 hours, and more preferably 6 to 12 hours. In this case,<br>
the organic solvent is used in amounts at a ratio of volume (mL)/weight<br>
(g) of the biphenyl compound, the ratio is preferably 5 to 50 times, and<br>
more preferably 5 to 30 times. After the reaction is finished, the<br>
reaction mixture is extracted with dichloromethane, dichloroethane, or<br>
chloroform, for example, and isolated and purified by silica gel column<br>
chromatography, so that a quaternary ammonium salt having a biphenyl<br>
backbone can be obtained. Alternatively, the reaction mixture may be<br>
used as is as a phase-transfer catalyst in the method for producing a<br>
mono-substituted alkylated compound described in detail later.<br>
Examples of the medium used in the alkylation process include<br>
benzene, toluene, xylene, ethyl ether, isopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dioxane, methyl tert-butyl ether, and cyclopentyl methyl ether.<br>
Alternatively, the medium may also be a biphasic one containing water<br>
and a medium immiscible with water. The medium can be used in<br>
amounts at a ratio of volume (mL)/weight (g) of the compound of the<br>
formula (II), the ratio is preferably 0.5 to 50 times, and more preferably<br>
1 to 30 times.<br>
Examples of the inorganic base used in the alkylation process<br>
79<br><br>
include lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide,<br>
calcium hydroxide, rubidium hydroxide, and cesium hydroxide. The<br>
inorganic base can be used at preferably 0.5 to 20 equivalents, and more<br>
preferably 1 to 10 equivalents, with respect to the compound of the<br>
formula (II).<br>
In the alkylation process, an inorganic base may be used in the<br>
form of an aqueous inorganic-base solution. In a case where an<br>
inorganic base is used in the form of an aqueous inorganic-base solution,<br>
the upper limit of the inorganic base that can be contained in the<br>
aqueous inorganic-base solution is preferably 100 equivalents or less,<br>
more preferably 60 equivalents or less, and even more preferably 30<br>
equivalents or less, with respect to the compound of the formula (II).<br>
The lower limit of the inorganic base that can be contained in the<br>
aqueous inorganic-base solution is preferably 0.5 equivalents or more,<br>
and more preferably 0.8 equivalents or more, with respect to the<br>
compound of the formula (II). The aqueous inorganic-base solution can<br>
be used at preferably 20 w/w% to 70 w/w%, and more preferably 30 w/w%<br>
to 60 w/w%.<br>
The volume ratio between the medium and the aqueous<br>
inorganic-base solution is a medium volume (mL)/inorganic base aqueous<br>
volume (mL) ratio of preferably 7/1 to 1/5, more preferably 5/1 to 1/3, and<br>
even more preferably 4/1 to 1/1.<br>
In the alkylation process, the compound of the formula (III) is<br>
used at preferably 0.5 to 10 equivalents, and more preferably 0.8 to 5<br>
equivalents, with respect to the compound of the formula (II). The<br>
optically-active phase-transfer catalyst is used as a catalyst preferably in<br>
amounts at a lower limit not less than 0.001 mol% and more preferably<br>
80<br><br>
not less than 0.005 mol%, and at an upper limit of preferably not more<br>
than 5 mol%, and more preferably not more than 2 mol%, per mole of the<br>
compound of the formula (II).<br>
In the alkylation process, in addition to the optically active<br>
phase-transfer catalyst, an achiral quaternary ammonium salt, such as<br>
tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (TBAB), can be also used simultaneously.<br>
For example, TBAB functions as a cocatalyst in the alkylation process<br>
and improves the yield of an a-amino acid and its derivative obtained,<br>
and it also allows the amount of the optically active phase-transfer<br>
catalyst that is used in the process to be reduced further.<br>
Further, in the alkylation process, it is also possible to use an<br>
optically active phase-transfer catalyst and crown ether compound, such<br>
as 18-crown-6 simultaneously. For example, 18-crown-6 functions as a<br>
cocatalyst in the alkylation process and improves the yield of an a-amino<br>
acid and its derivative obtained, and it also allows the amount of the<br>
optically active phase-transfer catalyst that is used in the process to be<br>
reduced further.<br>
The alkylation process is performed at a suitable temperature<br>
between -70°C and room temperature, preferably -20°C to 20°C, more<br>
preferably -10°C to 5°C, in air, under a nitrogen atmosphere or under an<br>
argon atmosphere, and preferably under an argon atmosphere. The<br>
process can be performed with stirring.<br>
When the aqueous inorganic-base solution is used in the<br>
alkylation process, it is for example preferable to perform the procedure<br>
as described below. That is, first, the compound of the formula (II), the<br>
optically active phase-transfer catalyst, and the compound of the formula<br>
(III) are each added to the medium to prepare a mixture.    At this time,<br>
81<br><br>
it is preferable to sufficiently stir the mixture with cooling on ice or<br>
ice-salt, for example. This mixture is then cooled and the aqueous<br>
inorganic-base solution is added thereto, so that alkylation of the<br>
compound of the formula (II) is initiated. The temperatures set to cool<br>
the mixture are preferably between -20°C and 20°C, more preferably<br>
between -15°C and 10°C, and even more preferably between -10°C and<br>
5°C.<br>
Thus, in the alkylation process initiated as described above, the<br>
reaction is then quenched at a time earlier than the time for completion<br>
of the stoichiometric reaction of the compound of the formula (II) with<br>
the compound of the formula (III), so that it becomes possible to<br>
stereoselectively produce the asymmetrical mono-substituted alkylated<br>
compound of the formula (I).<br>
Here, the "time for completion of the stoichiometric reaction" of<br>
the compound of the formula (II) with the compound of the formula (III)<br>
is the time from the initiateion of the chemical reaction to the completion<br>
of the chemical reaction without artificial interruption of the reaction, in<br>
other words, it refers to the time until either one of the two compounds<br>
disappears. The "time of disappearance" refers to the time until either<br>
one of the compound of the formula (II) or the compound of the formula<br>
(III) falls preferably 1%, more preferably 0.1%, and even more preferably<br>
0.01%, in mole number below the mole number of the compound at the<br>
initiation of the reaction. This time can be easily measured by persons<br>
skilled in the art by, for example, measuring the starting amount of the<br>
reaction mixture over time directly or after hydrolysis of an aliquot of<br>
the reaction mixture, by analytical means well-known in the art, such as<br>
gas chromatography (GC) or high-performance liquid chromatography<br>
82<br><br>
(HPLC). When the alkylation reaction is initiated in the alkylation<br>
process, the mono-substituted alkylated compound represented by the<br>
formula (I) is produced and its yield rises over time. At the early period<br>
of the reaction, a small amount of the mono-substituted alkylated<br>
compound has been produced, and its optical purity is extremely high.<br>
However, as the reaction progresses, the amount of mono-substituted<br>
alkylated compound produced increases, but the optical purity drops due<br>
to the progression of racemization. Accordingly, by quenching the<br>
reaction at a time earlier than the time for completion of the<br>
stoichiometric reaction, that is, before the progression of racemization, it<br>
is possible to obtain a mono-substituted alkylated compound with high<br>
optical purity in a certain degree of yield. In the present invention, at<br>
the time earlier than the time for completion of the stoichiometric<br>
reaction, it is preferable that the optical purity of the compound of the<br>
formula (I) is at least 70% ee.<br>
Alternatively, in the present invention, the optically active<br>
reaction product of interest may be obtained by quenching the reaction<br>
at an appropriate time that may even fall after the time for completion of<br>
the stoichiometric reaction, as long as it is before the start of gradual<br>
racemization of the reaction product. An appropriate time after the<br>
time for completion of the stoichiometric reaction refers to a time before<br>
the reaction product is influenced by racemization thereof. Such a time<br>
is preferably a time up until the optical purity of the compound of the<br>
formula (I) is found to have fallen below 70% ee, and more preferably a<br>
time up until it falls below 80% ee, when the optical purity of the<br>
reaction product in the reaction system is measured by analytical means<br>
well-known in the art, such as high-performance liquid chromatography<br>
83<br><br>
(HPLC), after the stoichiometric reaction completion time has passed.<br>
In this quenching process, the quenching is performed by adding<br>
water to the reaction mixture obtained by the alkylation process. The<br>
amount of water to be added is usually 0.1 to 10 times, and more<br>
preferably 0.5 to 3 times, the medium used in the alkylation process.<br>
Alternatively, the alkylation initiated as described above may be<br>
quenched at a time t that satisfies the following inequality:<br><br>
(where At is the optical purity (% ee) of the compound represented by the<br>
formula (I) that is obtained by quenching the reaction at a time t from<br>
the initiation of the reaction! and YLDt is the yield (%) of the compound<br>
represented by the formula (I) that is obtained by quenching the reaction<br>
at a time t from the initiation of the reaction). By quenching the<br>
reaction at this time t, it is possible to stereoselectively produce a<br>
mono-substituted alkylated compound.<br>
According to the method of the present invention, it is possible to<br>
obtain an optically active mono-substituted alkylated compound<br>
represented by the formula (I) at a high optical purity, even if an<br>
aldimine-type Schiff base is used. Here, high optical purity refers to<br>
preferably 70% ee or more, more preferably 80% ee or more, even more<br>
preferably 90% ee or more, and yet even more preferably 95% ee or more.<br>
The optical purity of the mono-substituted alkylated compound<br>
represented by the formula (I) can be measured by, for example,<br>
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) directly or after<br>
hydrolysis.<br>
The specific examples of the compound of the formula (I) that can<br>
84<br><br>
be produced through the method of the present invention include:<br><br>
but the present invention is not particularly limited to these compounds.<br>
85<br><br>
In the present invention, it is possible to use the optically active<br>
mono-substituted alkylated compound (optically active -amino acid<br>
derivative) represented by the formula (I) obtained through the above<br>
method to produce the optically active a-amino acid represented by the<br>
following formula (IV): <br>
for example,through any one of the following procedures.<br>
First, the aldimino group (R15CH=N-) moiety of the<br>
optically active mono-substituted alkylated compound (optically active<br>
a-amino acid derivative) represented by the formula (I) obtained through<br>
the above-described method is hydrolyzed under acidic conditions<br>
(aldimine acidic-hydrolysis process). Examples of the acid used in the<br>
aldimine acidic-hydrolysis process include inorganic acids (such as<br>
hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid) and organic acids<br>
(such as acetic acid, citric acid, and p-toluenesulfonic acid). Specifically,<br>
this aldimine acidic-hydrolysis process proceeds by treating the<br>
mono-substituted alkylated compound at a suitable temperature (e.g.,<br>
room temperature) with an aqueous solution of the acid, in a suitable<br>
medium (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, toluene, or ethanol). As a result, it is<br>
possible to obtain an ester derivative or an amide derivative of the amino<br>
acid, in which the terminal amino group has been freed, as an<br>
acidic-hydrolysis product.<br>
Next, if necessary, the ester derivative or the amide derivative of<br>
the amino acid obtained as above (acidic-hydrolysis product) is subjected<br>
to hydrolysis under stronger acidic conditions than those under which<br>
the aldimine was hydrolyzed, or under basic conditions.    Thus, it is<br>
86<br><br>
possible to obtain a desired amino acid represented by the formula (IV)<br>
in which the terminal of the acidic-hydrolysis product (that is, the ester<br>
group or the amide group (-COR20) of the acidic-hydrolysis product) has<br>
become a carboxylic acid.<br>
Examples<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention is described in specific detail<br>
by way of examples, but is not limited thereto.<br>
In the following examples, unless described otherwise, the<br>
measurements were carried out under the following conditions: The 1H<br>
NMR spectrum was measured on the AVANCE-400 (400 MHz) by Bruker<br>
BIOSPIN. The optical purity of a reaction product was measured<br>
through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a Waters<br>
2690 using a 4.6 mm x 25 cm Daicel Chiralcel OD, OD-H, AD or AD-H.<br>
Progression of the reaction was monitored with thin layer<br>

Next, the extracted compound 5 was combined with the collected<br>

Disclosed is a process for producing an asymmetric mono-substituted alkylated compound of an α -amino acid<br>
which is represented by a specific formula by using an aldimine-type Schiff base. In the process, the alkylation of an aldimine-type<br>
Schiff base in a medium in the presence of an optically active quaternary ammonium salt phase transfer catalyst and an inorganic base<br>
is started, and subsequently the reaction is quenched at any time preceding the completion of the stoichimetrical reaction, thereby<br>
yielding a mono-substituted alkylated product having a high optical purity.<br></example></example></example></example></example></example></example></example></example></example></example></example></example></example></example></example></comparative></example></example></td>
