CHEMOKINE-BINDING HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUND SALTS,<br>
AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]       This application is related to U.S. provisional patent application serial number<br>
60/614,790, filed September 29, 2004.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]       The present invention relates to chemokine-binding heterocyclic compound<br>
salts, methods of use thereof, and methods for preparing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]       The chemotactic cytokines, or chemokines, are a family of proteins,<br>
approximately 8-10 kDa in size that function, at least in part by modulating a complex and<br>
overlapping set of biological activities important for the movement of lymphoid cells and<br>
extravasation and tissue infiltration of leukocytes in response to inciting agents (see, for<br>
example: P. Ponath, Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs, 7:1-18, 1998).   The cellular receptors for these<br>
proteins are classified based on the chemokine natural ligand. Receptors of the β-chemokines<br>
are designated with the prefix "CCR" whereas the receptors of the cc-chemokine are designated<br>
with the prefix "CXCR". The natural chemokine ligand for the CXCR4 receptor is stromal<br>
cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1).<br>
[0004]       The inhibition of the binding of SDF-1 to CXCR4 by specific small-molecule<br>
inhibitors has been shown, in a model, to reduce the severity of the pathogenesis of collagen II-<br>
induced arthritis (P. Matthys, S. Hatse, K. Vermiere, A. Wuyts, G. Bridger, G.W. Henson, E.<br>
De Clercq, A. Billiau and D. Schols, J. Immunol. 107: 4686-4692, 2001). This model, which is<br>
used as a study model for the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis in humans, shows that SDF-<br>
1 plays a central role in the pathogenesis of murine collagen induced arthritis. Similarly, the<br>
use of small-molecule CXCR4 inhibitors has been shown, in a murine model, to reduce a<br>
number of pathological parameters related to asthmatic-type inflammation in an allergin-<br>
induced inflammation (N. W. Lukacs, A. Berlin, D. Schols, R.T. Skerlj, G. J. Bridger, Am. J.<br>
Pathology, 160 (4): 1353-1360, 2002).<br>
[0005]       Two specific chemokine receptors, CXCR4 and CCR5, have been implicated in<br>
the etiology of infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The T cell-line tropic (T-<br>
tropic) viral phenotype of HIV requires, for infection, an association with the CXCR4 receptor,<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/039250	PCT/US2005/034491<br>
which is expressed in the surface of certain cells of the immune system (Carroll et al., Science,<br>
276: 274-276,1997). Specifically, an interaction between HIV and the CXCR4 receptor is<br>
required for membrane fusion, a necessary step in the infection of the host immune cell.<br>
[0006]       The heterocyclic compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,-583,131, U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,698,546 and U.S. Pat No. 5,817,807 selectively bind to the CXCR4 receptor, inhibiting the<br>
binding of the natural SDF-1 ligand. Such binding may show anti-inflammatory effects. The<br>
binding also competitively prevents the binding of the T-tropic HIV with the receptor, and thus<br>
imparts a preventative effect against HIV infection.<br>
[0007]       The compound of Formula I, (S)-(N'-(lH-benzimidazol-2-ylmethyl)-N'-<br>
5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinolin-8-yl-l,4-butanediamine, is disclosed and claimed along with salts,<br>
pro-drug forms, and stereoisomeric forms thereof in WO 03055876, the entire disclosure of<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference. Preferably among the pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts described in WO 03055876 and the only salt form prepared therein is the hydrobromide<br>
salt. The compound of the Formula I is intended to be used as an orally dosed pharmaceutical<br>
agent in the treatment of HIV infections, and the present salts of Formula I suffer from<br>
problems associated with hygroscopity.<br><br>

foregoing is pertinent prior art. All statements as to the date or representation as to the<br>
contents of these documents is based on the information available to the applicants and does<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
[0009]       The present invention provides new pharmaceutically acceptable salts of<br>
Formula I, and methods for preparing the same. The present invention also provides methods<br>
for using the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/039250	PCT/US2005/034491<br>
[0010]       In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for preparing a<br>
crystalline salt of the Formula I, using an organic acid as a counter ion. In a particular<br>
example, the present invention provides a method for preparing a salt of Formula I, comprising<br>
contacting a compound of Formula I with an acid in a solvent to obtain a salt of a compound of<br>
Formula I, wherein said salt is citrate, edetate, lactate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate,<br>
terephthalate, substituted or unsubstituted benzoate, orotate, substituted benzenesulfonate,<br>
naphthoate, napsylate, or tosylate.<br>
[0011] In a particular example, the acid is a benzoic acid, optionally substituted with an<br>
organic or inorganic substituent known in the art. For example, the acid may be a benzoic acid<br>
substituted with hydroxy or amino.<br>
[0012]       In the above method, the ratio of the organic acid to the compound of Formula I<br>
may be about 1:1. Alternatively, the ratio of the organic acid to the compound of Formula I<br>
may be about 2:1 or 3:1.<br>
[0013]       In the above method, the solvent may comprise an alcohol, and may further<br>
comprise an aqueous medium. In one embodiment, a solution of the compound of Formula I<br>
and the acid is concentrated until the resulting solution becomes cloudy compared to the<br>
solution prior to concentration. Furthermore, a solution of the compound of Formula I and the<br>
acid may be seeded with a salt. In particular examples, the acid is 4-hydroxybenzoic acid in a<br>
solvent comprising alcohol and water. The alcohol may be heated prior to adding water, and<br>
water may be added until the resulting solution is cloudy compared to the solution prior to the<br>
addition of water. Examples of alcohol that may be used in the methods of the invention<br>
include but are not limited to methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, or a mixture<br>
thereof. In particular examples, the alcohol is methanol.<br>
[0014]       In particular examples, a compound of Formula I may be contacted with 4-<br>
hydroxybenzoic acid to provide a methanol solution having a molarity of about 0.5 M. The<br>
methanol solution may be heated to a temperature between 30 and 80 degrees Celsius,<br>
preferably to a temperature between 45 and 60 degrees Celsius, or more preferably, to about 50<br>
degrees Celsius. In particular examples, approximately three volumes of water are added to<br>
the methanol solution, and the resulting solution is heated to about 50 degrees Celsius. The<br>
methanol solution may be seeded with a small amount of the crystalline 4-hydroxybenzoate<br>
salt of the compound of the Formula I. The methanol solution may also be cooled to<br>
precipitate a compound of Formula I as a crystalline 4-hydroxybenzoate salt.<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/039250	PCT/US2005/034491<br>
[0015]       The present invention provides methods for producing salts of Formula I that<br>
are more stable when stored in bulk prior to manufacturing, particularly prior to tableting.<br>
Furthermore, the current process avoids problems associated with hygroscopicity where<br>
absorption of moisture occurs upon storage. Because the drug may be effective in small<br>
dosages, dose accuracy is particularly important. The lessened tendency toward<br>
hygroscopicity is important because the accuracy of weighing out bulk compound for<br>
manufacturing and analytical purposes, particularly for tableting purposes, would be affected if<br>
the compound's weight is partially attributable to water of hydration. Thus, constant assaying<br>
would be required to ensure that the proper amount of active drug is provided.<br>
[0016]       The present invention also provides pharmaceutical salts that exhibit improved<br>
chemical and thermal stability than other salts. In particular examples, the present invention<br>
provides a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of the Formula I, wherein the salt is<br>
citrate, edetate, lactate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate, terephthalate, substituted or<br>
unsubstituted benzoate, orotate, substituted benzenesulfonate, naphthoate, napsylate, or<br>
tosylate. In particular examples, the salt is 4-hydroxybenzoate, 4—aminobenzoate, 4—<br>
hydroxybenzenesulfonate, 4—aminobenzenesulfonate, benzoate or orotate. In more particular<br>
examples, the salt is 4-hydroxybenzoate, 4-aminobenzoate, 4-hydroxybenzenesulfonate or4-<br>
aminobenzenesulfonate. In yet more particular examples, the salt is 4-hydroxybenzoate. The<br>
present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a salt of a compound<br>
of Formula I, and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent.<br>
[0017]       Furthermore, the present invention provides a benzoate salt of a compound of<br>
Formula I, having less hydroscopicity than the hydrobromide or hydrochloric salt of said<br>
compound of Formula 1. The benzoate salt is more stable in storage than the hydrobromide or<br>
hydrochloride salt of said compound of Formula I. The benzoate salt also has an improved<br>
stability as compared to the free base, when measured at about 30 degrees Celsius and above,<br>
or at about 40 degrees Celsius and above. In a particular example, the benzoate salt may be 4-<br>
hydroxybenzoate.<br>
[0018]       Further, the present invention provides methods for modulating a CXCR4<br>
receptor, a CCR5 receptor, or both, comprising contacting a cell having the receptor with an<br>
effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a salt of a compound of Formula<br>
I as previously described, and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent. In particular examples,<br>
the present invention provides a method for treating a condition mediated by a CXCR4<br>
receptor, a CCR5 receptor, or both, comprising administering to a subject in need of such<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/039250	PCT/US2005/034491<br>
treatment an effective amount of the pharmaceutical salts and compositions of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0019]       Examples of CXCR4 or CCR5 receptor mediated condition include but are not<br>
limited to angiogenesis, atherosclerosis or acute thrombosis, retroviral infections like HIV,<br>
arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis, allergy, inflammatory disease such as neutrophil<br>
mediated acute respiratory distress syndrome and ischemia/reperfusion injury to chronic<br>
diseases such as asthma, or a rumor (solid or metastatic) including, but not limited to,<br>
glioblastoma, blood related cancer malignancies such as lymphoma (Hodgkin's and Non-<br>
Hodgkin's lymphoma), myeloma, fibroma, astrocytoma, acute and chronic leukemia and<br>
tumors of the Central Nervous System (CNS), i.e. epenymoglioma, medulloblastoma,<br>
oligodendoglioma and spongioblastoma. The tumor may be of brain, ovarian, breast, prostate,<br>
lung or haematopoetic tissue. Other examples of CXCR4 or CCR5 receptor mediated<br>
condition include allergic rhinitis, hypersensitivity lung diseases, hypersensitivity pneumonitis,<br>
eosinophilic pneumonias, delayed-type hypersensitivity, interstitial lung disease., systemic<br>
anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity responses, drug allergies, insect sting allergies, autoimmune<br>
diseases, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, myastenia gravis, juvenile onset<br>
diabetes, glomerulonephritis, autoimmune throiditis, graft rejection such as allograft rejection<br>
or graft versus host disease; inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis,<br>
spondyloarthropathies, scleroderma, psoriasis, dermatitis, eczema, atopic dermatitis, allergic<br>
contact dermatitis, urticaria, vasculitis, eosinphilic myotis, eosiniphilic fasciitis, or a condition<br>
. associated with immunosuppression.<br>
[0020]       In the above treatment methods, the subject may be human or animal. In<br>
particular examples, the subject may be undergoing chemotherapy, radiation therapy, wound<br>
healing, burn treatment, or therapy for autoimmune disease.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0021]       The invention discloses methods of making novel salts of the compound of the<br>
Formula I. In general, the procedures involve the mixing of the basic compound of the<br>
Formula I with an acidic counter ion, followed by the isolation of the salt.<br>
[0022]       In one embodiment, the invention offers a simple process for the formation of a<br>
salt between the compound of the Formula I and a series of inorganic acids. The<br>
stoichiometric ratio of acid to Formula I can be varied. The following non-limiting list of<br>
suitable inorganic ions representing suitable acids for use in the formation of a salt with the<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/039250	PCT/US2005/034491<br>
compound of the Formula I includes, for example chloride, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate,<br>
bromide, fluoride, iodide.<br>
[0023]       In another embodiment, the present invention discloses a process for the<br>
formation of a salt between an organic acid and the compound of the Formula I. The following<br>
non-limiting list of organic ions representing suitable acids which may be used to form salts<br>
according to the procedures disclosed in the present invention includes, for example, acetate,<br>
aspartate, benzenesulfonate, citrate, edetate, lactate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate, D-tartrate,<br>
L-tartrate, terephthalate, 4-hydroxybenzoate, 4-aminobenzoate, orotate, 4-<br>
hydroxybenzenesulfonate, 4-aminobenzenesulfonate, benzoate, napthoate, napsylate, tosylate.<br>
[0024]       In another embodiment, the present invention discloses a novel process for the<br>
formation of a crystalline salt between an organic acid and the compound of the Formula I.<br>
Suitable organic auions include, for example, but are not limited to 4-hydroxybenzoate, 4-<br>
aminobenzoate, 4-aminobenzenesulfonate, 4-hydroxybenzenesulfonate, benzoate,<br>
benzenesulfonate, orotate.<br>
[0025]       The process is illustrated by the formation of a 4-hydroxybenzoate salt of the<br>
compound of the Formula 1.   In one exmaple, a compound having Formula I is dissolved in a<br>
suitable solvent. A suitable solvent is typically an alcohol, which includes, but is not limited to<br>
methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol or mixtures thereof. Non-limiting examples of other<br>
suitable solvents include dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidine, ethylene glycol. Preferred<br>
solvents are methanol or ethanol or isopropanol. 4-hydroxybenzoic acid is then added as a<br>
solid or as a solution in the same solvent. The acid is typically used in a 1.0:1 to 1.2:1 molar<br>
ratio to the compound of the Formula I. The concentration of the compound of the Formula I<br>
in the chosen solvent is typically about 0.5 moles/L, or approximately 4.5 weight equivalents<br>
of solvent.   The mixture is then stirred and heated to achieve solvation, which generally occurs<br>
at 30-80°C, and preferably at about 45-60°C. A second solvent is then added, which is<br>
typically water. Generally, about 8-10 weight equivalents are added, to achieve a slight<br>
cloudiness. The pH of the solution may optionally be adjusted at this point to a range between<br>
7-8 with aqueous sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid. The mixture is then cooled, with<br>
stirring, to cause precipitation of the salt, usually as crystals. Seeding of the mixture during<br>
cooling may be performed. The salt is isolated by filtration.<br>
[0026]       The salts prepared by the described procedures exhibit desirable characteristics,<br>
when compared to the crystalline freebase, such as enhanced chemical and thermal stability.<br>

WO 2006/039250	PCT/US2005/034491<br>
Utility and Administration<br>
[0027] The invention is directed to pharmaceutically acceptable salts and compositions<br>
of a compound of Formula I that modulate chemokine receptor activity. Chemokine receptors<br>
include but are not limited to CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR3, and CXCR4.<br>
[0028]       In one embodiment, the invention provides pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
and compositions of compounds of Formula I that demonstrate protective effects on target cells<br>
from HIV infection by binding specifically to the chemokine receptor, thus affecting the<br>
binding of a natural ligand to the CCR5 and/or CXCR4 of a target cell.<br>
[0029]       In another embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and compositions<br>
of the invention are useful as agents which affect chemokine receptors, such as CCR1, CCR2,<br>
CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR3, CXCR4 where such chemokine receptors have been correlated<br>
as being important mediators of many inflammatory as well as immunoregulatory diseases.<br>
[0030]       Other diseases that are also implicated with chemokines as mediators include<br>
angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis such as brain, and breast tumors. Thus, a compound that<br>
modulates the activity of such chemokine receptors is useful for the treatment or prevention of<br>
such diseases.<br>
[0031]       The term "modulators" as used herein is intended to encompass antagonist,<br>
agonist, partial antagonist, and or partial agonist, i.e., inhibitors, and activators. In one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and compositions<br>
of compounds of Formula I demonstrate a protective effect against HIV infection by inhibiting<br>
the binding of HIV to a chemokine receptor such as CCR5 and/or CXCR4, of a target cell.<br>
Such modulation is obtained by a method which comprises contacting a target cell with an<br>
amount of the compound which is effective to inhibit the binding of the virus to the chemokine<br>
receptor.<br>
[0032]       The pharmaceutically acceptable salts and compositions of the invention that<br>
inhibit chemokine receptor activity and function may be used for the treatment of diseases that<br>
are associated with inflammation, including but are not limited to, inflammatory or allergic<br>
diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, hypersensitivity lung diseases, hypersensitivity<br>
pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonias, delayed-type hypersensitivity, interstitial lung disease<br>
(ILD) (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or ILD associated with rheumatoid arthritis,<br>
systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome,<br>
polymyositis or dermatomyositis); systemic anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity responses, drug<br>
allergies, insect sting allergies; autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/039250	PCT/US2005/034491<br>
arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, myastenia gravis, juvenile onset diabetes;<br>
glomerulonephritis, autoimmune throiditis, graft rejection, including allograft rejection or<br>
graft-versus-host disease; inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative<br>
colitis; spondyloarthropathies; scleroderma; psoriasis (including T-cell mediated psoriasis) and<br>
inflammatory dermatoses such as dermatitis, eczema, atopic dermatitis, allergic contact<br>
dermatitis, urticaria; vasculitis (e.g., necrotizing, cutaneous, and hypersensitivity vasculitis);<br>
eosinphilic myotis, eosiniphilic fasciitis; and cancers.<br>
[0033]       In addition, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and compositions of the<br>
invention that activate or promote chemokine receptor function are used for the treatment of<br>
diseases that are associated with immunosuppression such as individuals undergoing<br>
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, enhanced wound healing and bum treatment, therapy for<br>
autoimmune disease or other drug therapy (e.g., corticosteroid therapy) or combination of<br>
conventional drugs used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and graft/transplantation<br>
rejection, which causes immunosuppression; immunosuppression due to congenital deficiency<br>
in receptor function or other causes; and infectious diseases, such as parasitic diseases,<br>
including but not limited to helminth infections, such as nematodes (round worms);<br>
Trichuriasis, Enterobiasis, Ascariasis, Hookworm, Strongyloidiasis, Trichinosis, filariasis;<br>
trematodes; visceral worms, visceral larva migtrans (e.g., Toxocara), eosinophilic<br>
gastroenteritis (e.g., Anisaki spp., Phocanema ssp.), cutaneous larva migrans (Ancylostona<br>
braziliense, Ancylostoma caninum); the malaria-causing protozoan Plasmodium vivax,<br>
Human cytomegalovirus, Herpesvirus saimiri, and Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus, also known<br>
as human herpesvirus 8, and poxvirus Moluscum contagiosum.<br>
[0034]       The pharmaceutically acceptable salts and compositions of the invention may be<br>
used in combination with any other active agents or pharmaceutical compositions where such<br>
combined therapy is useful to modulate chemokine receptor activity and thereby prevent and<br>
treat inflammatory and immunoregulatory diseases.<br>
[0035]       The pharmaceutically acceptable salts and compositions of the invention may<br>
further be used in combination with one or more agents useful in the prevention or treatment of<br>

1.	Hydrochloride Salt of the Compound of the Formula I:<br>
[0044]       It should be noted that all of the hydrochloride salts were synthesized using the<br>
same general procedure with varying equivalents of hydrochloric acid.<br>
[0045]       In a 50 ml round-bottom flask, the compound of the Formula I (0.258 g, 0.738<br>
mmol) was dissolved in reagent grade methanol (5 mL) to generate a colorless solution. The<br>
solution was diluted with water (15 mL) and then aqueous hydrochloric acid (0.0978 N, 7.56<br>
mL, 1 equiv.) was added in one portion. The resulting mixture was stirred at 70°C for one<br>
hour. The solvents were removed in vacuo and the resulting clear glass residue was dissolved<br>
in water (5 mL) and transferred to a 30 mL plastic bottle. The solution was frozen with liquid<br>
nitrogen and then lyophilized over two days to yield a fluffy white solid which was<br>
subsequently ground to a fine white powder of the hydrochloride salt of the compound of the<br>
Formula I (0.280 g, 98 %). HPLC: 98 % (&gt;99 % ee). GC: CH2C12 (5 ppm), EtOAc (4 ppm),<br>

Aqueous sulfuric acid (2 N, 0.735 mL, 1 equiv.) was added in one portion and the; reaction<br>
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 50 minutes. The solvents were removed in vacuo<br>
and the resulting clear glass residue was dissolved in methanol (3 mL) and added dropwise<br>
(over 15 minutes) to diethyl ether (150 mL) at room temperature. The resulting white slurry<br>
was stirred for 20 minutes and the white solid was isolated via suction filtration (under a steady<br>
flow of nitrogen). Nitrogen was forced through the filter cake for 10 minutes and then the solid<br>
was broken up with a spatula and transferred to the hot nitrogen apparatus. Hot nitrogen (~ 75<br>

solution was diluted with water (2 mL) and then aqueous phosphoric acid (14.7 N, 77 µL, 1<br>
equiv.) was added in one portion followed by the addition of water (15 mL). The resulting<br>
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1.5 hours. The solvents were removed in vacuo<br>
and the resulting clear glass residue was re-dissolved in water (5 mL) and then the solvents<br>
removed again in vacuo (repeat two more times). The final colorless glass residue was ground<br>
to a fine powder and dried in vacuo at 40°C overnight to yield the phosphate salt of the<br>
compound of the Formula I (0.441 g, 87 %). HPLC: 99 % (&gt;99 % ee). GC: CH2C12 (3 ppm),<br>

9b.      4-Hydroxybenzoate Salt of the Compound of the Formula I (Procedure B):<br>
[0055]       The compound of the Formula I (37.2 g, 130 mmol) was dissolved in MeOH<br>
(260 mL) at room temperature. 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid (17.94 g, 0.9 eq. based on theoretical<br>
yield) was added and the ratio was checked by NMR. Additional 4-hydroxybenzoic acid was<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/039250	PCT/US2005/034491<br>
added to ensure 5 ~ 10 % excess of the acid. The pH of the mixture was checked by moistened<br>
pH paper, and more acid or NaOH was added if necessary to bring the pH to 7 ~ 8. The<br>
mixture was heated to 50 °C and water (720 mL) was added. The mixture was slowly cooled<br>
and was seeded at -40 °C. Crystals began to form. After stirring at room temperature<br>
overnight, the mixture was filtered and the filter cake was washed with ice-cold aqueous<br>
MeOH (3:1 water-MeOH, 500 mL in two washings). The solid was dried under a stream of N2<br>
and further dried under high vacuum overnight to give the final product as slightly off-white<br>
powder: 43.3 g (71 %). Purity: 99.9 % by HPLC; chiral Purity (HPLC): 97.1 % e.e. mp 151°C<br>
(DSC). The spectral data is consistent with that listed in procedure 9a.<br>
9c.       4-Hydroxybenzoate Salt of the Compound of the Formula 1 (Procedure C):<br>
[0056]       A solution of the compound of the Formula 1 (560 g, 1.6 mol) in water at pH 9-<br>
10 (2.3 L) was extracted with two portions of n-butanol (2.3 L each). The combined n-butanol<br>
fractions containing the compound of the Formula I were then concentrated under reduced<br>
pressure at a temperature of approximately 35 °C to a volume of approximately 1.5 L.<br>
Isopropanol (3.5 L) was then added and the solution was concentrated to a final volume of 1.5<br>
L under reduced pressure at approximately 35 °C. Analysis for water content was then<br>
conducted (pass of 0.1% or less: if water content is above 0.1% w/w, another fraction of<br>
isopropanol is added and the distillation is repeated). A further 3.5 L of isopropanol was added<br>
to the solution.<br>
[0057]       In a separate vessel, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (1 l0g, 0.8 mol, 0.5 eq.) was<br>
dissolved in isopropanol (3.5 L), and the acid solution was added to the isopropanol solution of<br>
the compound of the Formula I. The relative ratios of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid to the compound<br>
of the Formula I were checked by 1H NMR, and further portions (0.1 eq.) are added until a<br>
target of 100-110 mol % 4-hydroxybenzoic acid to compound of the Formula 1 was reached.<br>
The solution was then concentrated under reduced pressure at 30-50 °C to a final volume of<br>
approximately 1.5 L, and the solvent ratio of n-Butanol to isopropanol was checked by 1H<br>
NMR (expecting approximately 25% n-Butanol relative to isopropanol). The solution was then<br>
filtered, and isopropanol (0.75 L) is then added. The solution was warmed to 50-55 °C, and<br>
water (9 L) was then added slowly, maintaining the temperature between 50-55 °C. The pH of<br>
the solution was then adjusted to 7.5-8 with 10% w/w sodium hydroxide. The solution was<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/039250	PCT/US 2005/034491<br>
cooled to 38-40 °C, and seed crystals (3.8 g) were then added to initiate crystallization. After<br>
stirring at 38-40 °C for approximately 45 minutes, the mixture was cooled over 2-3 hours to 0-<br>
5 °C. The slurry was then stirred at 0-5 °C for 1 hour. The product 4-hydroxybenzoic acid salt<br>
of the compound of the Formula I was isolated by filtration, and the filter cake was dried at 40-<br>
50 °C in a vacuum oven until the water content was 
hydroxybenzoic acid salt of the compound of the Formula I was isolated as a fluffy off-white<br>
crystalline solid: Purity 96.8% (w/w assay on an anhydrous basis by HPLC: Total impurities<br>
0.14% w/w); Chiral Purity &gt;99% e.e. The Spectral data is consistent with that listed in<br>
Procedure 9a.<br>
10.	Orotate Salt of the Compound of the Formula I:<br>
[0058]       In a 50 mL round-bottom flask, the compound of the Formula I (2.00 g, 5.73<br>
mmol) was dissolved in reagent grade methanol (20 mL) to generate a colorless solution. The<br>
solution was diluted with water (5 mL) and then orotic acid monohydrate (1.00 g, 5.73 mmol)<br>
was added and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for one hour. The solvents<br>
were removed in vacuo and the resulting pale yellow glass residue was suspended in ethyl<br>
acetate (30 mL). The pale yellow slurry was heated to 80°C and methanol was added slowly<br>
until the solid completely dissolved (18 mL MeOH in total). Five drops of water was then<br>
added to aid in crystallization and the pale yellow solution was cooled slowly to room<br>
temperature resulting in the formation of a white crystalline solid. After 18 hours at room<br>
temperature the solid was broken up with a spatula and the white macrocrystalline solid was<br>
isolated via suction filtration and then dried in vacuo at 50°C for 16 hours (2.75 g, 95 %).<br>
HPLC: 99.7 % (&gt;99 % ee). GC: EtOAc (45 ppm), MeOH (11 ppm).<br>
