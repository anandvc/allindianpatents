 CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION <br>
This application claims the priority of German Application No.101 22 459.1 filed May 9, 2001, which Is Incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF TOE INVENTION	<br>
This Invention relates to an apparatus integrated in a fiber processing machine, such as a card, a cleaner, an opener or the like for fiber material such as cotton and chemical fibers. The fiber processing machine has roll cover elements associated with a rapidly rotating roll. Between the cover elements a plurality of openings are provided. A first opening serves for the discharge of foreign bodies, such as trash, seed fragments, leaf fragments and the like whereas a second opening which is arranged downstream of the first opening as viewed In the rotary direction of the roll, serves for discharging fiber material by an air stream.<br>
German patent document No.1 114 127 doscribes an apparatus in which the fiber tuns, freed from a preponderant part of foreign bodies, are brought on a doffer in the effective zone of an air stream which carries the fiber tufts to a screening drum separator or a pneumatic transport device. The doffor has a sawtooth-like clothing whose teeth are included in the direction of roll rotation so that the fiber web attached to the teeth is readily removed by the suction air stream. The air stream is drawn from the outside through a gap. It is a disadvantage of such a prior art construction that it is not possible to vary the air stream. An outlet opening for the foreign bodies In the cover for the doffer Is not present because the fiber material on the doffer has already been substantial cleaned.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus of the above-outlined type from which the discussed disadvantages are eliminated and which, in particular, makes possible a variation of the fiber-doffing air stream and also provides for an improved waste quality at an outlet opening.<br><br>
3<br>
This object and others to become apparent as the specification progresses, are accomplished by the Invention, according to which, briefly stated, the fiber processing machine Includes a clothed roll entraining fiber material thereon; a roll cover circumferentially partially surrounding the rod and defining on annular clearance therewith; a transfer opening provided in the roll cover for admitting fiber material to the roll; a waste discharge opening provided in the roll cover for removing waste from the clearance; a fiber removal opening provided in the roll cover downstream of the waste discharge opening as viewed In the direction of roll rotation; an arrangement for generating an air stream for doffing fiber material from the roll and for discharging doffed fiber motorial through the fiber removal opening; an arrangement for varying a strength of the air stream at the fibor removal opening; and an arrangement for varying the extent of waste removal through the waste discharge opening.<br>
By setting the strength of, the air stream for removing the fiber material at the fiber removal opening, it Is feasible to Improve the waste quality at a separating location situated upstream of the fiber removing location, it is a particular advantage of the invention that an adjustment of the air stream also affects the vacuum between the cover and the rol, and thus the intensity of the removal of foreign bodies at the waste discharge opening is improved. In this manner the ratio between the desired separation of foreign bodies and an undesired separation of good fibers is optimized. It is in particular feasible to ensure, to the extent possible, a minimum loss on good fibers in the foreign body separating process.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Fig.1 illustrates a four-roll cleaner 1 which may be a CVT 4 model manufactured by Trutzschler GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Monchengladbach, Germany. The fiber material is Introduced into the nip of cooperating feed rollers 1a, 1b which clamp the material and advance it to a pin roll 2, having a circumferential velocity of approximately 10-21 m/sec. From the pin roll 2 the material Is transferred to a sawtooth roll 3, having a circumferential velocity of approximately 15-25 m/sec. The sawtooth roll 3 Is followed by additional sawtooth rolls 4 and 5. The rolls 2-5 have a diameter of-approximately 150-300 mm and are enclosed in a cleaner housing 7. The roll 5 Is associated with a stationary carding element 8, an adjustable guide element 9, an air and waste discharge opening 10, a separating knife 11 and a pressure sensor 12. The separating knife 11 is adjoined by a suction hood 13. The pressure sensor 12 and the adjustable guide -element 9 may be connected to an electronic control and regulating device, such as a microcomputer, as illustrated in Fig.3. The roll 5 is surrounded by a cover which is composed of a plurality of arcuate cover elements 14a, 14b, 14c and 14d. Between the cover elements 14d and 14c the waste discharge opening 10 Is provided through which foreign bodies and other Impurities are separated from the fiber material. Between the cover elements 14c and 14b a fiber removal opening 15 is provided, through which the fiber material Is taken off the rod 5 by an air stream B1, B2. Between the cover elements 14a and 14d a transfer opening is provided to allow transfer of the fiber material from the roll 4 to the roll<br><br>
5<br>
6. The roll 5 is associated with a pnoumatic fiber removal device which comprises a duct 16 merging into the opening 15 bordered by a circumferential portion of the roll 5. The duct 16 has an air supply duct portion 16a through which an air stream 81 is drawn for contacting the circumferential portion of the roll 5 exposed in the opening 15. The air supply duct portion 16a is adjoined by an air removal duct portion 16b through which a fiber/air mixture B2 Is drawn away from the roll 5. The duct portion 16b is coupled to a non-illustrated vacuum source. As shown in Fig.1, the air stream B1, B2 flows substantially downward from above. At the upstream end of the opening 15 an air flow rate setting element (guide vane) 17 is disposed which is pivotally supported for swinging motions in the direction of arrows C and D. By means of the air flow rate setting element 17 the strength of the fiber doffing air stream B1, B2 is adjustable and thus the degree of separation of foreign bodies through the waste discharge opening 10 may be controlled. The strength of the air stream B1, B2 depends from the flow rate and/or the air speed and/or the air pressure.<br>
Fig. 2 partially shows a three-roll cleaner which may be a CXL 3 model manufactured by Trutzschler GmbH &amp; Co. KG. The air stream B1, B2 serving for removing the fiber material from the roll 4 flows essentially from below upwardly through the duct 16. By means of the air flow rate setting element 17 the strength of the air stream is affected by virtue of a throttle effect. While in the Illustrated construction the flow rate of the air stream B1 in the duct portion 16a is set, the air stream B2 and the vacuum stream G (FIG.3a) between the cover portion 14f and the surface of the roll 4 are also changed. The waste discharge opening 10 is In communication with a suction hood 24 and Is bordered by a separating knife 23. By virtue of this arrangement the air supply In the region of the fiber removal opening 15 may be adjusted. At the same time an adjustable vacuum is provided immediately downstream of the waste discharge opening 10.<br>
Turning to Fig. 3, a pressure sensor 18 is arranged upstream of the air-doffer (fiber removal) opening 15 and the air flow rate sotting element 17, as viewed In<br><br>
6<br>
the direction of rotation 4b of the roll 4. Tho pressure sensor 18 dotects the static pressure prevailing in the annular clearance a between the cover element 14f and the roll clothing 4a. The sensor 18 communicates with the annular clearance a via a through bore 18' provided in tho cover element 14f. The measured pressure values are utilized for setting the distance b of the setting element 17 from the points of the roll clothing 4a. Such a setting may be affected manually or automatically as a function of tho measured values supplied by the pressure sensor 18. For such an automatic regulation the pressure sensor 18 applios its signals to a transducer 19 which converts the pressure values into electric signals. The transducer 19, in turn, applios its signals to a regulator 20 which Is provided with a nominal value setter 21, for example, a microcomputer. The regulator 20 is connected with the adjustable guide element 17 by means of a setting member such as a stepping motor 22. In the regulator 20 the actual pressure values are compared with tho nominal pressure values and, in case of a deviation, setting signals are applied to the element 17 by the stepping motor 22. The air flow rate setting element 17 Journals in a support 17a and is thus rotatable in the direction of the arrows C, D. In addition to adjusting the clearance b as noted earlier, the guide element 17 also varies the clearance c between the guide element 17 and the facing portion of the Inner wall of the duct 16.<br>
By setting the strength of the air stroam B1, B2 for doffing the fiber material through the fiber removal opening 15, it is feasible to improve, apart from the change of degree in the fiber doffing, the waste quality at the waste discharge opening 10 situated upstream of the fiber removal opening 15. It Is a particular advantage of this arrangement that by virtue of adjusting the air stream, the vacuum between the cover (designated at 14c In Fig.1 and at 14f in Fig.2) and the respectively last roll 5 or 4 thus has an effect on the intensity of the separation of foreign bodies through tho opening 10. In this manner, the ratio between the desired separation of foreign bodies and the undeslred separation of good fibers is optimized. It is in particular possible to keep the loss of good fibers at a minimum during tho foreign body separation.<br><br>
7<br>
The pressure of vacuum downstream of the respective separating knife 11 and 23 is advantageous to ensure that a separation of good fibers through the waste removal opening 10 is kept at a minimum. Such a vacuum Is generated by the air stream passing through the fiber removal opening 15 with the air-doffed fiber material. By throttling the air admission of the air stream which carries the fiber material through the opening 15, the vacuum may be varied behind the separating knife and thus the waste quality of the last separating location (waste discharge opening 10) may be affected. The vacuum is generated by the air stream 0 shown in Fig. 3a.<br>
Each waste separating location which is not followed by a suction location for the fiber material may be complemented by a suction hood In which a vacuum stream Is generated by a vacuum source attached to the suction hood. The strength of the generated vacuum may be adjusted by an appropriate setting element or may be regulated. Such an arrangement is shown in Fig.4 end may be Incorporated in the Fig.1 cleaner, at the roll 3 which Is associated with a waste separating opening 10, a separating knife 25 and a suction hood 26. As seen in Fig. 4 and viewed in the direction of rotation of the roll 3, downstream of the waste discharge opening 10 an air passage opening 27 is arranged which is adjoined by a suction hood 28. A throttle slide 29 arranged at an end of the suction hood 28 is movable in the direction E, F to vary the flow passage cross section for the drawn air. The suction hoods 26 and 28 are coupled to non-illustrated suction sources. Through the suction hood 28 solely air (that is, no fiber-material) is withdrawn.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a fiber processing machine similar to that illustrated in Fig.2 except it is not provided with a separating location for foreign bodies. Such a fiber processing machine may be a chemical fiber opener. By virtue of the adjustable air flow rate setting element 17 the strength of the fiber doffing air stream B1 and 82 may be vaired.<br><br>
8<br>
The features according to the invention described in connection with roll 5 of the four-roll cleaner of Fig. 1 and the three-rod cleaner of Fig.2 may find application at a licker-in and/or a main carding cylinder of a carding machine.<br>
It will be understood that the above description of the present Invention is susceptible to various modifications, changes and adaptations, and the same are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the appended claims.<br><br>
