Novel thiazolidin-4-one derivatives<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel thiazolidin-4-one derivatives of the General Formula (I) and their use as active ingredients in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions. The invention also concerns related aspects including processes for the preparation of the compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more compounds of the General Formula (I), and their use as immunosuppressant agents, either alone or in combination with other immunosuppressant therapies.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The immune system attempts to fight a transplanted organ in the same way it fights an infection or a cancer. Without immunosuppressive medication to inhibit the immune system's action, a transplanted organ is quickly rejected and stops functioning. Organ transplant recipients can experience some organ rejection even when they are taking immunosuppressive drugs. Rejection occurs most frequently in the first few weeks after transplantation, but rejection episodes can also happen months or even years after transplantation. Combinations of up to three or four medications are commonly used to give maximum protection against rejection while minimizing side effects. Current standard drugs used to treat the rejection of transplanted organs interfere with discrete intracellular pathways in the activation of T-type or B-type white blood cells. Examples of such drugs are cyclosporin, daclizumab, basiliximab, everolimus, or FK506, which interfere with cytokine release or signaling; azathiopirene or leflunomide, which inhibit nucleotide synthesis; or 15-deoxyspergualin, an inhibitor of leukocyte differentiation. The beneficial effects of these therapies relate to their broad immunosuppressive<br><br>
effects; however, the generalized immunosuppression which these drugs produce also diminishes the immune system's defence against infection and malignancies. Furthermore, standard immunosuppressive drugs are often used at high dosages and can themselves cause or accelerate organ damage in either the transplanted organ itself, or in other target organs of the transplant recipient.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The present invention provides compounds having a powerful and long-lasting immunosuppressive effect which is achieved by reducing the number of circulating and infiltrating T- and B-lymphocytes, without affecting their maturation, memory, or expansion. In consequence, the compounds of the present invention can be utilized alone or in combination with standard T-cell activation inhibiting drugs, to provide a new immunosuppressive therapy with a reduced propensity for infections or malignancies when compared to standard immunosuppressive therapy. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with reduced dosages of traditional immunosuppressant therapies, to provide on the one hand effective immunosuppressive activity, while on the other hand reducing end organ damage associated with higher doses of standard immunosuppressive drugs.<br>
Biological Assay<br>
The immunosuppressive activity of the compounds of the invention can be demonstrated by measuring the number of circulating lymphocytes in whole blood of rats as follows.<br>
Normotensive male Wistar rats are housed in climate-controlled conditions with a 12-hour light/dark cycle, and have free access to normal rat chow and drinking water. Blood (0.5 ml_) is collected by retro-orbital sampling before drug administration, and 3 and 6 h thereafter. Blood cell count is measured in whole blood using a Beckman-Coulter Synchron CX5 Pro cytometer. Statistical analysis of lymphocyte counts are performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using<br><br>
Statistica (StatSoft) and the Student-Newman-Keuls procedure for multiple comparisons.<br>
Thus, compounds of the invention decrease the number of circulating lymphocytes in whole blood when compared to pre-drug values.<br>
Table 1 shows the effect on lymphocyte counts 6 h after oral administration of 10 mg/kg of a compound of the present invention to normotensive male Wistar rats as compared to a group of animals treated with vehicle only.<br><br><br>
The following paragraphs provide definitions of the various chemical moieties that make up the compounds according to the invention and are intended to apply uniformly throughout the specification and claims unless an otherwise expressly set out definition provides a broader definition.<br>
The term lower alkyl, alone or in combination with other groups, means saturated, straight or branched chain groups with one to seven carbon atoms, preferably one to four carbon atoms.

acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, benzoic acid, methanesulfonic acid, and the like that are non-toxic to living organisms. In case the compound of General Formula (I) or General Formula (II) is acidic in nature the expression encompasses salts with an inorganic base like an alkali or earth alkali base, e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, or with an organic base such as benzathine, choline, meglumine, and the like which are also non-toxic to living organisms (S.M. Berge, L. D. Bighley and D. C. Monkhouse, Pharmaceutical salts, J. Pharm. Sci., 66 (1977), 1-19; P. L Gould, Salt selection of basic drugs, Int J. Pharmaceutics 33 (1986), 201-217).<br>
The compounds of the General Formula (I) and General Formula (II) can contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and may be prepared in form of optically pure enantiomers, mixtures of enantiomers such as racemates, diastereomers, mixtures of diastereomers/ diastereomeric racemates, mixtures of diastereomeric racemates, and meso-forms. The present invention encompasses all these forms.<br>
A first aspect of the invention consists of a novel pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one thiazolidin-4-one derivative of the General Formula (I):<br>
wherein: <br>
R1 represents lower alkyl, lower alkenyl; cycloalkyl; 5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphth-1-yl; 5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphth-2-yl; a phenyl group; a phenyl group independently mono-, di- or trisubstituted with lower alkyl, halogen, lower alkoxy, or -CF3;<br><br>

n represents the integer 0 or 1;<br>
and configurational isomers, optically pure enantiomers, mixtures of enantiomers such as racemates, diastereomers, mixtures of diastereomers, diastereomeric racemates, mixtures of diastereomeric racemates and the meso-form, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvent complexes, and morphological forms, and inert carrier material.<br>
The compounds of General Formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral, parental or topical administration. They can be administered, for example, perorally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and<br><br>
soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, cream or oils.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art (see for example Mark Gibson, Editor, Pharmaceutical Preformulation and Formulation, IHS Health Group, Englewood, CO, USA, 2001; Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Edition, Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science) by bringing the described compounds of General Formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, optionally in combination with other therapeutically valuable substances, into a galenical administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable inert carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but a'so organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers are, however, required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure,<br><br>
buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of General Formula (I) can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 0.5 mg to about 1000 mg, especially about 1 mg to about 500 mg, coines into consideration for the treatment of disorders associated with an activated immune system for adult patients. Depending on the dosage it may be convenient to administer the daily dosage in several dosage units.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 0.5 to 500 mg, preferably 1 to 250 mg, of a compound of General Formula (I).<br>
In a preferred embodiment according to the invention, the above-mentioned pharmaceutical composition comprises the (Z, Z)-isomers of the thiazolidin-4-one derivatives of the General Formula (I).<br>

Compounds of General Formula (I) and General Formula (II) are suitable for the use as medicament.<br>
Still a further object of the present invention is a process to prepare a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the General Formula (I) or a compound of the General Formula (II) by mixing one or more active ingredients with inert excipients in a manner known perse.<br><br>
The compounds of General Formulae (1) and (II) can be manufactured by the methods given below, by the methods given in the Examples or by analogous methods. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvents used, but such conditions can be determined by a person skilled in the art by routine optimisation procedures.<br>
Compounds of the General Formula (I) and General Formula (II) of the present invention can be prepared according to the general sequence of reactions outlined below. Only a few of the synthetic possibilities leading to compounds of General Formula (I) and General Formula (II) are described as summarized in Scheme 1.<br><br><br>
According to Scheme 1, compounds of the General Formula (I) can be prepared by reacting a compound of Structure I with a compound of Structure II, for instance, in acetic acid at elevated temperatures and in the presence of a base such as sodium acetate. The reaction can also be carried out in a non-polar solvent such as toluene or benzene in the presence of an amine such as pyrrolidine or piperidine.<br>
Likewise, compounds of the General Formula (II) can be prepared by reacting a compound of Structure III with a compound of Structure IV (Scheme 2).<br><br>
Depending on the nature of R23, it may be beneficial to prepare the compounds of General Formula (II) by first reacting a compound of Structure III with the compound of Structure V to form a compound of Structure VI (Scheme 3). The compound of Structure VI is then treated with a compound of Structure VII wherein X represents a leaving group such a chlorine, a bromine or an iodine atom, or a<br><br>
sulfonic acid ester group in the presence of a base such as K2CO3, NaH, or triethylamine in a solvent such as THF, DMF, acetone, or DMSO.<br><br>
As outlined in Scheme 1, the compounds of Structure I can be prepared by reacting a compound of Structure VIII with a compound of Structure IX to form the intermediate of Structure X which is then cyclised to the compound of Structure I with a bromo- or chloroacetic acid ester of Structure XI. This reaction is ideally performed in a two step-one pot procedure at room temperature using an alcohol<br><br>
such as methanol or ethanol as solvent. The second step can be catalysed by the addition of pyridine.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of Structure I can also be prepared by reacting a compound of Structure XII with a compound of Structure XIII in the presence of a base such as NaH in a solvent such as THF or DMF. Compounds of the Structure XII are prepared by treating a compound of Structure XIV with chloroacetic acid chloride or bromoacetic acid bromide in a solvent such as THF, DMF or DCM in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, ethyldiisopropylamine at temperatures between -60 and +50°C (Scheme 4).<br><br>
The preparation of compounds of Structure III is in analogy to the preparation of compounds of Structure I.<br><br>
