PHARMACIA &amp; UPJOHN COMPANY,  a US company, of 301  Henrietta Street, Kalamazoo, Michigan 49001, United States of America,<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>

/	BACKGROUND OF TIIEiNVENTIOft     ,<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is a process, including intermediates, to produce<br>
atanoprost, a pharmaceutical agent useful in treating ophthalmic conditions.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
US Patent 5,422,368 discloses latanoprost (Example 2) and its usefulness as an<br>
ophthalmic agent. The patent discloses a process (Example 2) to prepare latanoprost<br><br>
and two closely related compounds.<br>
There are very limited numbers of examples of reductions of Ap-unsaturated<br>
enones with chlorodiisopinocampheylborane. J. Am. Chem. Soc, 110(5), 1539-46<br>
(1988) describes a single example of reduction of an acyclic aryl enone, 4-phenyl-3-<br>
buten-2-one, with chlorodiisopinocampheylborane giving an 81% eantiomeric<br>
selectivity, and no examples of simple acyclic non-aryl conjugated enones.<br>
Bull. Korean Chem. Soc, 15(12), 1033-4 (1994) addresses the issue of 1,2<br>
versus 1,4 reduction with chlorodiisopinocampheylborane but did not discuss the<br>
enantioselectivity or diastereoselectivity of the reductions.<br>
Tetrahedron Letters 1067-1070 (1976) discloses a cyclopentane diol-acid<br>
where the side-chain did not contain any aromatic functionality.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>

the enone (III). Suitable solvents include THF, methylene chloride and DME and mixtures thereof.  MTBE and toluene alone are not operable. The use of a cosolver.;, such as hexane, heptane, isooctane or similar hydrocarbons is not necessary but is preferred.  This is important since (-)-chlorodiisopinPcampheylborane is available 5      commercially as a solution in these solvents. MTBE and toluene can be used as the cosolveni. The narure of the solvent has virtually no effect with regard to the 15(Sl/15(R) ratio in the product It is preferred that from about 3 to about 4 equivalents of (-)-chlorodjisopinocampheylborane be used; it is more preferred tha: ai least 3.5 equivalents of (-)-chlorodiisopinoc3rnphcyIrporane be used.  With fewer 10      equivalents the reaction is incomplete; there is no improvement in rate or selectivity with more equivalents. When the (-)-chlarodiisopinoPamphcy]borane is contacted with the cc.p-unsaturated enone (111), the temperature should be maintained less than 0°.
