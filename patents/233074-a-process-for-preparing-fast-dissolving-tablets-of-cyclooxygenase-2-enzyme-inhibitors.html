				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing fast dissolving tablets comprising a therapeutically effective amount of drug (s) that acts selectively as a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme inhibitor, which disintegrate quickly in mouth. The tablets are particularly suitable for patients who have difficulty in swallowing.<br>
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exert anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects through the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by blocking cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme activity. COX enzyme has two isoforms: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-2 enzyme is inducible by inflammation, whereas COX-1 is present in most tissues as the housekeeper enzyme. The inhibition of COX-1 is therefore undesirable whereas on the other hand inhibition of COX-2 enzyme accounts for the therapeutic benefits.<br>
COX-2 inhibitors are the latest addition to the growing armamentarium of anti-inflammatory drugs. Much of the recent research has focussed upon efficacious methods for development of drug delivery of COX-2 enzyme inhibitors to treat inflammation-associated maladies.<br>
The ability of COX-2 inhibitors to selectively block formation of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins while sparing those that guard the gastrointestinal tract makes them an attractive choice for long term use, such as in rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.<br>
Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are old age diseases associated with joint pain, stiffness, inflammation or swelling. Many elderly persons have difficulty in taking conventional oral dosage forms like solutions, suspensions, tablets and capsules, because of hand tremors and dysphagia. Moreover increase intake of water for swallowing conventional dosage forms results in frequent urination and nocturia.<br>
Swallowing problems are also common in mentally ill, the developmentally disabled, and patients who are uncooperative, on reduced liquid-intake plans, or are nauseated. In cases such as motion sickness, sudden episodes of allergic attack or coughing, and an unavailability of water, swallowing the conventional tablets becomes difficult. Consequently, there is a need to provide a fast dissolving dosage form of COX-2 inhibitors for oral administration, which disintegrates and dissolves rapidly in saliva without the need for drinking water.<br><br>
Host of patents have been granted pertaining to oral dosage forms. By way of the example, WO patent application No. 01/85134 discloses pharmaceutical compositions containing Non-steroid Anti Inflammatory Drugs and a process of spray drying for manufacturing rapid disintegrating tablets characterized by high disintegrating property in the buccal cavity.<br>
EP patent application No. 0945134 discloses directly compressed tablets of meloxicam prepared using a meloxicam salt of an inorganic or organic base, from which the active substance is rapidly released and absorbed. The increased solubility obtained by using a meloxicam salt makes it possible for large amounts of the active substance to be dissolved immediately after administration and thus become available for absorption by the body.<br>
EP patent application No. 0748628 discloses organoleptically acceptable formulations containing S(+) 1,8-diethyl-1,3,4,9-tetrahydropyrano (3,4-b)indole-1-acetic acid, preferably with an acid component also known as S(+)etodolic acid or S(+)etodolac. The use of etodolac eutomer provides the required organoleptic properties.<br>
US patent 6,586,458 discloses methods and compositions for treating migraine headache, which comprises a combination of a 5-HT agonist and a long acting NSAID. The patent describes that co-administration of a 5-HT agonist together with a long acting, NSAID represents an improved treatment for a wide variety of headaches, produces long lasting efficacy and a substantial reduction in the frequency relapse of headaches.<br>
US patent 6,599,529 discloses oral pharmaceutical modified release multiple-units composition for the administration of a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug substance to obtain both a relatively fast onset of the therapeutic effect and the maintenance of a therapeutically active plasma concentration for a relatively long period of time.<br>
US patent 6,713,089 discloses oral modified release pharmaceutical compositions containing a drug substance, which has a very low solubility under acidic conditions. The invention has been designed so that the composition releases the drug under acidic conditions and is available for absorption in the stomach.<br><br>
Thus in patent and other literature from this field there can be found numerous publications describing the composition and the preparation of various formulations with COX-2 inhibitors, but no literature source has been found that would describe such a simple process for the preparation of fast dissolving tablet to be dissolved in the mouth.<br>
The fast dissolving tablets of the present invention can either be produced by conventional methods like wet granulation, dry granulation and direct compression or by specialized techniques like tablet molding and freeze drying.<br>
Since the pharmaceutical industry is constantly making efforts to increase the efficiency of tabletting operations and reduce costs by utilizing the smallest amount of floor space and labor as possible for a given operation, increasing attention is being given to direct compression for tablet preparation.<br>
Direct compression is regarded as a relatively quick process where the powdered materials  are  compressed  directly  without  changing  the  physical  and  chemical properties of the drug. The advantages of direct compression include (i)       few manufacturing steps, as granulation step is eliminated (ii)      elimination of heat and moisture and therefore better<br>
a.	physical stability such as no change in crystallinity and polymorphic form of<br>
the drug, and<br>
b.	chemical stability<br>
(iii)     use of conventional equipment and commonly available excipients; and (iv)     low cost and less manpower.<br>
The present invention provides a simple, less time consuming and economical process of making fast dissolving tablets comprising a therapeutically effective amount of drug (s) that acts as a cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme (COX-2) inhibitor for oral administration which disintegrate quickly in mouth. The tablets prepared by the present invention disintegrate and dissolve in the oral cavity in less than about 30 seconds without the need of water. The fast dissolving tablet of COX-2 inhibitor made by the present process has pleasant mouth feel and there is no after taste or grittiness.<br>
Direct compression is the preferred method because of the above advantages. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of fast<br><br>
dissolving tablets comprising a therapeutically effective amount of drug(s) that acts as a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor for oral administration.<br>
Accordingly, the process for preparing fast dissolving tablet to be dissolved in the mouth, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of drug(s) that acts as a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor for oral administration wherein the said process characterizes in:<br>
a.	blending 25-100 mg of COX-2 inhibitor, from 1% to 10% of croscarmellose<br>
sodium, from  10% to about 95% of a filler and  other pharmaceutical<br>
excipients selected from amongst binders,  lubricants, glidants, colouring<br>
agents, flavouring agents and sweeteners; and<br>
b.	directly compressing the homogeneous mixture of step (a) to obtain the fast<br>
dissolving tablet.<br>
wherein the tablet dissolves in the mouth in less than 30 seconds.<br>
The present invention involves blending of COX-2 inhibitors with the filler and other excipients and then the blend is directly compressed to make the tablets.<br>
"COX-2 inhibitor" as used herein to embrace compounds that specifically/selectively, or preferentially inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 over cyclooxygenase-1. Illustrative examples of COX-2 enzyme inhibitors that are advantageously administered by the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention include "specific inhibitors" such as celecoxib, rofecoxib, parecoxib, valdecoxib, and the like or "preferential inhibitors" such as meloxicam, nimesulide, etodolac, nabumetone, and the like.<br>
"Therapeutically effective amount" means that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, a system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician.<br>
Fillers of the present invention can be selected from any such pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, which gives bulk to the COX-2 inhibitor composition and which is physically and chemically compatible with COX-2 inhibitor; preferably those fillers may be selected from alkali earth metal salts such as directly compressible dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, tricalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate, calcium<br><br>
