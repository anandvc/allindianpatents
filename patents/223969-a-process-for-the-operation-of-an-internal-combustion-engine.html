Procedure. Computer Program and Control Unit for the Operation of an Internal Combustion Engine<br>
Prior Art<br>
The invention is with reference to a procedure for the operation of an internal combustion engine of a certain type in accordance with a finite state automaton. The invention also concerns a computer program and a control unit for the execution of this procedure.<br>
Finite state automatons as a basic principle are established in prior art and particularly in software development. Generally speaking, they visually map different conditions of a system. The individual conditions of a system are thereby represented by variables and values allocated to these variables that can be queried by the software modules. Those kinds of finite state automatons for internal combustion engines, as illustrated in Figure 4, are also basically established; in this case the finite state automaton provides different possible operating conditions, illustrated in Figure 4 by black dots, for the operation of the internal combustion engine of a certain type and permits a crossover between these operating conditions. The operating conditions in the finite state automatons could be grouped in multiple levels (1..,n, n+1, ...N). The levels are structured hierarchically in this manner so that at least one level n is subordinate to at least one other level n+1, which comprises of at least one sub operating condition for one operating condition allocated to level n.<br><br>
In the course of time, established finite state automatons for internal combustion engines have grown gradually; they have been upgraded time and again in a demand-oriented manner for specific single applications. This is thus the reason why existing finite state automatons for internal combustion engines today are very complex and unwieldy. If established finite state automatons for single applications are to be used in connection with internal combustion engines of a specific type, it is today inevitable that the implementation of established finite state automatons must be accompanied by the installation of a multiplicity of components or sub systems that are not necessarily required for the specific single application.<br>
Starting from prior art, it is thus the task of the invention to further develop the described, established procedure, computer program and control unit in such a manner that a simple and lean customisation to variously used internal combustion engines of different types is possible.<br>
This task is solved by the procedure used in Patent Claim 1. Accordingly, the solution to this task is provided in accordance with the invention in that level n and all its preliminary levels in the hierarchical structure of the finite state automaton represent operating conditions respectively that the internal combustion engine of the specific type has in common with internal combustion engines of another type and that the other levels as well as all subsequent levels added on to it in the hierarchical structure of the finite state automaton represent operating conditions respectively that are specific to the internal combustion engine of the specific type.<br>
Advantages<br>
Internal combustion engines of various types are particularly diesel engines or petrol engines.<br><br>
Through the division of the levels of the finite state automaton in accordance with the invention, a changeover in the type of internal combustion engine used is only required when those levels in the finite state automaton that are specific to a particular internal combustion engine, are to be exchanged or customised,. All other levels of the finite state automaton remain unaffected by the changeover. These other levels/parts of the software and of the control of the internal combustion engine respectively that are only dependent on the general (reusable) levels of the finite state automaton, can be used without customisation in various types of internal combustion engines.<br>
Expressed otherwise, when changing the type of internal combustion engine being used, it is now no longer necessary to transfer the entire finite state automaton that basically comprises of the operating conditions of a multiplicity of internal combustion engines of various types. It is, in fact, possible to first only use those levels of the finite state automaton that represent operating conditions that span all internal combustion engines when using a new internal combustion engine, i.e., to be independent of the type. With regard to the other levels of the finite state automaton, only those levels need then be transferred that are meant for specific-use internal combustion engines. Even within a selected, other level, individual operating condition modules that are not required can be eliminated or exchanged. Other levels that are basically available in the finite state machine can be omitted. This is the manner in which a lean adaptation of the finite state automaton to any application case is basically possible.<br>
In accordance with the first exemplary embodiment of the invention, the finite state automaton exhibits four levels for the internal combustion engine. The first level thereby represents the first level of an operating condition called "Motor Activation". Operating conditions "Start", "Normal Operation" and "Coasting" are defined as sub operating conditions to operating condition "Motor Activation" in the second level.    The third level again defines sub operating conditions of<br><br>
operating conditions pertaining to level 3 which comprises of "Standby", "Ready", "Start Phase", "Idling Speed", "Accelerate", "Taper-off" and "End" conditions. The fourth level, in conclusion, comprises of "Pre-heat" or "Do Not Pre-heat" as sub operating conditions to the operating condition of "Ready" in the third level. Of importance in this exemplary embodiment is that the first to third levels represent operating conditions that are not specific to internal combustion engines of certain types while the fourth level defines operating conditions that are specific to internal combustion engines of a certain type.<br>
Other beneficial embodiments of the procedure whereby the finite state automaton is designed in such a manner that a crossover between individual operating conditions that are represented by it is possible only under special conditions, is the subject matter of the sub claims. Furthermore, it is also of advantage to design the procedure in such a manner that the finite state automaton represents not just the operating condition of the internal combustion engine but also different operating conditions of a control unit of the internal combustion engine.<br>
The task of the invention is further solved by a computer program for the control unit of the internal combustion engine as well as by the control unit itself. The advantages of this solution to the task correspond to the advantages described above with reference to the procedure in accordance with the invention.<br>

Description of the Exemplary Embodiment<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an example for the basic structure of a finite state automaton 12, used to control an internal combustion engine of a certain type in accordance with the required procedure.<br>
Figure 3 displays an internal combustion engine of a certain type 20 that drives a control unit 10 in accordance with the finite state automaton 12 stored therein. A starter 15 that is controlled by the control unit 10 serves to start the internal combustion engine 20.<br>
The basic structure 12 shown in Figure 1 has a total of five levels n = 0 ... 4. The topmost level N = 0 represents operating condition "Motor Activation". This, thereby, concerns a superordinated term and condition respectively of all possible operating conditions of the internal combustion engine and of the control unit. Subsequently, only the different operating conditions of the internal combustion engine are discussed first. A discussion of the different operating conditions of the control unit takes place further below.<br>
The topmost operating condition in level n = 1 is called "Motor Activation" 1-6. Different operating conditions of the internal combustion engine are centralised in<br><br>
the level n = 2, lying below the first one, that specify the superordinated operating condition "Motor Activation"; it thus deals with operating conditions "Standby" 2 -7 (optional), "Start" 2-8, "Normal Operation" 2 - 9 and "Coasting" 2-10. All sub operating conditions of the internal combustion engine are centralised under the label "Start", and serve to prepare the internal combustion engine for the start as well as to carry the start into execution. These sub operating conditions deal with conditions "Ready" 3-1 and "Start Phase" 3-2 that are specified in level n = 3. Likewise, sub operating conditions "Idling Speed" 3-3 and 'Accelerate" 3 -4 in the third level n = 3 are described as sub operating conditions for the superordinated condition "Normal Operation" 2 - 9 in the second level n = 2. A third level n = 3 comprises of conditions "Taper-off" 3-5 and "End" 3 - 6 as sub operating conditions to the superordinated operating condition "Coasting" 2 - 9 of the internal combustion engine, as it is called in the second level. Lastly, the finite state automaton illustrated in Figure 1 displays a fourth level n = 4 in which, for example, the condition "Ready" from the third level n = 3, is specified in greater detail. In the case of diesel engines for example, it can be verified whether a "Pre-heaf 4-1 condition or a "Do not pre-heat" condition 4-2 has been reached when in this "Ready" condition.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the first to third levels n = 1 - 3, as far as it concerns the internal combustion engine and not the control unit, only represent operating conditions that the internal combustion engine of a particular type, for example a spark-ignition engine, has in common with the internal combustion engine of another type, a diesel engine for example. In contrast to this, the fourth level predominantly represents operating conditions that are specific to internal combustion engines of a particular type, diesel engines or spark-ignition engines.<br>
The individual operating conditions mentioned so far and the possible crossover between  these   operating   conditions  during  the  operation   of  an   internal<br><br>
combustion engine are described below in greater detail with reference to Figure 2.<br>
Within the scope of condition "Motor Activation" 1 - 6, as can be seen in Figure 2, the entire possible operation of the internal combustion engine of a particular type is illustrated in a recapitulating manner. It subdivides particularly into "Standby" 2-7, "Start" 2-8, "Normal Operation" 2 - 9 and "Coasting" 2-10 conditions. The "Standby" condition 2-7 has been planned as an energy-saving mode in which certain electrically operated accessories of the internal combustion engine can be disconnected. In the conceptual design as an energy-saving mode, communication is possible in the "Standby" condition with other control units through a network. Apart from this, a monitoring of the operating temperature of the internal combustion engine, advance run the fuel supply of the internal combustion engine, monitoring of the choke valve spring or testing of the emergency cut-out can take place for example during this condition.<br>
If the ignition of the vehicle and of the internal combustion engine respectively is turned on when in the "Standby" condition 2 - 7f or other equivalent information is provided to the control unit, the "Standby" condition is abandoned and the control mode of the internal combustion engine changes to a "Ready" condition 3-1; starting of the internal combustion engine 20 can then follow instantaneously. Yet another monitoring can be conducted by the service consumer in the "Ready" condition for example; implementation of the preheating process could take place in the "Ready" condition in accordance with a subordinate level n - 4 in the case of diesel engines. However, as soon as the starter 15 for the internal combustion engine is activated and the revolutions per minute of the internal combustion engine is determined to be more than the predetermined threshold value ThrO, the "Ready" condition 3 - 1 is abandoned and the internal combustion engine moves to the "Start Phase" condition 3-2. As an alternative to this, a crossover to the "Start Phase" condition does not take place<br><br>
if the ignition is switched off when in the "Ready1 condition 3-1, instead the crossover takes place to the "Taper-off" 3-5 condition.<br>
The "Start Phase" 3-2 serves to bring the internal combustion engine to run through self-propulsion. If this does not happen i.e., if the internal combustion engine "stalls" which means that the revolutions per minute of the internal combustion engine for a certain minimum time remains below the pre-determinable threshold value Thr1, then a return to the "Ready" condition 3-1 takes place. If, in contrast, the Start Phase is concluded successfully i.e., if the revolutions per minute of the internal combustion engine increases beyond the pre-determinable second threshold value Thr2, then a crossover takes place within the second level n = 2 of the finite state automaton 12 from operating condition "Start" 2 - 8 to operating condition "Normal Operation" 2-9.<br>
Expressed more precisely, a crossover of the internal combustion engine to the "Idling Speed" condition 3 - 3 in the third level n = 3 of the finite state automaton takes place first after the start phase, as has been illustrated in Figure 2. Depending on the requirement of the driver of the vehicle, into which the internal combustion engine has been incorporated, and depending on the driving situation respectively, the operating condition of the internal combustion engine switches during the "Normal Operation" 2-9 condition between the sub operating conditions "Idling Speed" 3-3 and "Accelerate" 3-4. If the internal combustion engine 20 'stalls" when it is in "Normal Operation", then a crossover takes place within level n = 2 to the "Start" 2- 8 operating condition and, more precisely, a crossover to "Ready" 3-1 condition within the n = 3 level. If, in contrast, the "Normal Operation" 2-9 condition is methodically concluded by turning off the ignition, the internal combustion engine will then switch over to "Coasting" 2-10 condition in level n = 2. Within operating condition "Coasting" 2-10, the engine moves to condition "Taper-off1 3 - 5 in level n = 3 after the ignition is switched off.  This condition is characterised in that the ignition is, of<br><br>
course, switched off but the internal combustion engine continues to coast i.e., its revolutions per minute are still not equal to null. Only when even the revolutions per minute of the internal combustion engine fall below a pre-determined threshold value Thr3, does the internal combustion engine 20 leave this "Taper-off" 3 - 5 condition and move within the third level n = 3 to the "End" 3-6 condition. This condition signifies the final shutting-off of the internal combustion engine whereby the ignition has, of course, already been switched off and the revolutions per minute are 0 but a certain accessory such as, for example, a blower could still be coasting down in order, for example, to cool the internal combustion engine.<br>
As soon as the "Coasting" condition comes to an end, the engine switches over within the second level to the "Standby" 2-7 condition. This behaviour applies if the ignition is not switched on again during the "Coasting" 2-10 condition.<br>
Three alternative courses of action for control of the internal combustion engine are possible if the ignition is, however, switched on again during this "Coasting" 2 - 10 condition in the second level n = 2. The first alternative is that the internal combustion engine moves within the second level from the "Coasting" 2-10 condition to the "Start" 2-8 condition. With reference to the third level n = 3, it is immaterial whether the internal combustion engine 20 is in the "Taper-off' 3-5 condition at the time of switching the ignition on again or in the "End" 3-6 condition for effecting a change; in both cases the internal combustion engine moves over, when the ignition is switched on, to the "Ready" 3-1 condition. An alternative to this is the possibility of leaving "Motor Activation" 1-6 condition and crossing over to a "Re-set" condition 1 - 2 of the control unit 10 for the internal combustion engine 20. A third alternative consists of the possibility of switching over to a "Switched Off* 1 -1 condition of the control unit 10.<br><br>
Apart from the "Motor Activation" 1 - 6 operating condition which, as described, includes all essential operating conditions of the internal combustion engine, the finite state automaton 12 can also include various operating conditions of the control unit 10 for the internal combustion engine. This, as is illustrated in Figure 2, thereby deals with conditions "Switched Off" 1 - 1, "Re-set" 1 - 2, "Boot" 1 - 3, "Initialisation" 1-4 and "Shut Down" 1-5. As can already be seen from the structure of the reference signs, these conditions are allocated equal ranking with the "Motor Activation" 1 - 6 condition of the first level n = 1 of the finite state automaton 12.<br>
The crossovers between these individual conditions of the control unit 10 of the internal combustion engine as well as the crossovers between these conditions of the internal combustion engine and those described above are briefly described below.<br>
The starting point for the consideration of the finite state automaton 12 described is preferably a situation in which a computer and a microcontroller in the control unit 10 respectively on which a computer program runs for the execution of the procedure described and used, is switched off. Provided that the control unit 10 is incorporated in a vehicle together with the internal combustion engine 20, the computer is then, for example, switched off as long as the doors of the vehicle, particularly the DC door, are still closed or an otherwise defined alerting event has not yet occurred. This kind of a "Switched Off" condition is designated with reference sign 1-1. As soon as, however, the DC door in particular in opened, a switch gets activated which prompts the control unit 10 to leave this 1 - 1 condition and crossover to a "Re-set" 1 - 2 condition. In this 1-2 condition, the control unit 10 gets relocated to a pre-defined starting condition. The control unit 10 then automatically crosses over from the "Re-set" 1 - 2 condition to the "Boot" 1-3 condition in which the control unit is booted up. Within the "Boot" condition, the control unit 10 runs sequentially through the "Pre-initialisation", "Speed<br><br>
Initialisation" 2-2 and "Post Initialisation" 2-3 conditions. After concluding the "Boot" 1 - 1 'condition, the control unit 10 crosses over automatically again to "Initialisation" 1 - 4 condition, whereby different customisations and, in particular, pre-setting of certain variables takes place. This occurs while the "Standard Boot" 2-4, "Client Boot" 2 - 5 and "Operating System Preparation" 2- 6 are run sequentially. The control unit 10 crosses over automatically to the "Motor Activation" 1 - 6 condition in the first level n = 1 at the end of the "Initialisation" process. To be more precise, the control unit then crosses over to the "Standby" 2-7 condition in the n = 2 level.<br>
After switching on the ignition, the internal combustion engine is normally started from the "Standby" 2- 7 condition, as has been described above in detail. Over and above this, however, different conditions are also pre-programmed as a rule and as a result of their occurrence, the internal combustion engine does not cross over from the "Standby" 2-7 condition to the "Ready" 3-1 condition but instead crosses over to the "Shut Down" 1 - 5 condition of the control unit 10. This is particularly the case when the "Standby" 2-7 condition has been adopted after the "Coasting" 2-9 condition has been abandoned. In the "Shut Down" condition, the control unit is prepared for shut down. If the "Shut Down" condition has already been ended, then the control unit crosses over again automatically to the "Switched Off1 1 - 1 condition. If, however, the ignition is switched on again when in the "Shut Down" condition or another equivalent event should occur, then the control unit 10 will cross over to the "Re-set" 1 - 2 condition in order to move automatically from there, as described above, to the "Boot" condition.<br><br><br><br><br>

Procedure according to Claim 11, characterised in that the internal combustion engine crosses over from the "Normal Operation" (2 - 9) in the second level (n = 2) to the 'Ready" (3-1) condition within the third level (n = 3) when the revolutions per minute of the internal combustion engine fall below the first threshold value (Thr1).<br>
13.	Procedure according to Claim 2, characterised in that, that within the second level (n = 2), the internal combustion engine goes back directly to the "Start" (2 - 8) condition from the "Coasting" (2-10) condition when the ignition is switched on again.<br>
14.	Procedure according to Claim 13, characterised in that the internal combustion engine crosses over either from the "Taper-off" (3 - 5) or from the "End" (3 - 6) condition to the "Ready" (3 - 1) condition when the ignition is switched on again within the third level (n = 3); or that the internal combustion engine crosses over either from the "Taper-off" (3 - 5) condition or from the 'End" (3 - 6) condition to the "Standby" (2 - 7) condition within the third level (n = 3) when coasting comes to an end.<br><br>
15.	Procedure according to one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that, apart from the operating conditions of the internal combustion engine, the finite state automaton (12) also represents various operating conditions of the control unit of the internal combustion engine.<br>
16.	Procedure according to Claim 15, characterised in that the first level (n =<br>
1)	of the finite state automaton (12) also comprises of "Switched Off' (1 -<br>
1), "Re-set" (1 - 2), "Boot" (1 - 3), "Initialisation" (1 - 4) and "Shut Down"<br>
(1 - 5) for the control unit (10) of the internal combustion engine (20) apart<br>
from the "Motor Activation" (1 - 6) condition for the internal combustion<br>
engine.<br>
17.	Procedure according to Claim 16, characterised in that the control unit (10) for the internal combustion engine (20) crosses over from the "Switched Off1 (1 - 1) condition to the "Re-set" (1 - 2) condition when the control unit (10) is switched on, particularly by activating a switch in the driver's door where the control unit is incorporated.<br>
18.	Procedure according to Claims 16 or 17, characterised in that a crossover from the "Initialisation" (1 - 4) condition to the "Motor Activation" (1 - 6) condition within the first level (n = 1) takes place when the initialisation has been concluded.<br>
19.	Procedure according to Claim 18, characterised in that the crossover from the "Initialisation" (1 - 4) condition takes place optionally either to the "Standby" (2 - 7) or the "Start" (2 - 8) conditions in the second level (n =<br>
2)	provided that the initialisation has been concluded and that in the case<br>
of a transfer to the "Start" (2 - 8) condition, a transfer is made directly to<br>
the "Ready" (3-1) condition in the third level (n = 3).<br><br>
20.	Procedure according to Claim 16, characterised in that a crossover from the "Standby" (2 - 8) condition for the internal combustion engine (20) to the "Taper-off1 (1-5) condition for its control unit takes place according to a pre-determined condition.<br>
21.	Procedure according to Claim 16, characterised in that the internal combustion engine crosses over from the "Coasting" (2-10) condition in which the ignition is switched off, optionally to one of either "Re-set" (1 -2), "Boot" (1 - 3) or "Initialisation" (1 - 4) conditions when the ignition is switched on again.<br>
22.	Procedure according to one of Claims 16-21, characterised in that the "Boot" (1 - 3) condition comprises of the sub conditions "Standard Boot" (2 - 1), "Client Boot" (2 - 2) and "Operating System Preparation" (2 - 3), which are executed during the boot procedure in the aforementioned sequence.<br>
23.	Procedure according to one of Claims 16 - 22, characterised in that the "Initialisation" (1-4) condition comprises of sub conditions "Pre-Initialisation" (2 - 4), "Speed Initialisation" (2 - 5) and "Post Initialisation" (2 - 6), which are sequentially executed during the initialisation procedure in the aforementioned order.<br>
24.	Computer program for a control unit (10) of an internal combustion engine (20), particularly of a vehicle with a program code that is meant to execute the procedure in accordance with one of Claims 1-23 when the same is conducted on a computer, preferably a processor within the control unit (10).<br><br>
25.	Computer program according to Claim 24, whereby the program code is<br>
saved on a computer-readable data carrier.<br>
26.	Control unit (10) for an internal combustion engine (20) which is designed<br>
to control the internal combustion engine as per the procedure according<br>
to one of Claims 1 - 23.<br><br></td>
