				<td>Process for preparing sulfuric diamides<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing sulfuric diamides of the<br>
general formula I<br>
<br>
in which R^ and R^ are each independently a primary alkyl radical having from 1 to 8<br>
carbon atoms, a secondary alkyl radical having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms or a<br>
cycloalkyi radical having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, or, together with the nitrogen atom,<br>
form a 5- to 8-membered, saturated nitrogen heterocycle which, as well as the nitrogen<br>
atom, may have a further heteroatom selected from O and S as a ring member, where<br>
the nitrogen heterocycle is unsubstituted or may have 1, 2, 3 or 4 alkyl groups having in<br>
each case from 1 to 4 carbon atoms as substituents.<br>
Sulfuric diamides of the formula I are interesting intermediates for the preparation of<br>
active ingredients, for example for the preparation of the active herbicidal ingredients<br>
described in WO01/83459.<br>
Processes for preparing sulfuric diamides of the formula I have been known in principle<br>
for some time. For instance, R. Behrend, J. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1884, 222, p. 116-136<br>
describes the preparation of dimethylaminosulfonamide and diethylaminosulfonamide<br>
by successive reaction of sulfuryl chloride (SO2CI2) with diethylammonium chloride or<br>
diethylammonium chloride and subsequent reaction of the resulting dimethylamido-<br>
sulfuryl chloride or diethylamidosulfuryl chloride with gaseous ammonia. However, the<br>
reaction proceeds only incompletely. Also disadvantageous is the hydrogen chloride<br>
released in the first step.<br>
K. W. Wheeler et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1944, 66, p. 1242, describe the preparation of<br>
tri- and tetrasubstituted sulfo diamides, in which, in a first step, two equivalents of a<br>
secondary amine are first reacted with sulfuryl chloride in substance and the resulting<br>
sulfamyl chloride is reacted with two equivalents of a further amine. The yields of this<br>
process are unsatisfactory.<br>
WO01/83459 describes the preparation of sulfuric diamides of the general formula I by<br>
reaction of chlorosulfonamide with a primary or secondary amine. The<br>
chlorosulfonamide is prepared by hydrolysis of chlorosulfonyl isocyanate.<br>
Chlorosulfonyi isocyanate is, however, comparatively costly.<br>
WO03/097589, in turn, describes the preparation of sulfuric diamides of the general<br>
M/48074<br>
<br>
formula I, in which, in a first step, the chiorosulfonamide of a primary or secondary<br>
amine is prepared by successive reaction of the primary or secondary amine with sulfur<br>
trioxide in the presence of a tertiary amine, followed by the reaction of the resulting<br>
ammonium salt of the corresponding amidosulfonic acid with phosphorus halide.<br>
Subsequently, the resulting chiorosulfonamide, also referred to hereinafter as sulfamoyi<br>
chloride, is reacted with ammonia. The process is notable for better yields, but is<br>
comparatively complicated owing to the multitude of steps.<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to provide an easily performable process for<br>
preparing sulfuric diamides of the general formula I designated above, which provides<br>
these compounds in good yields and which can be carried out with inexpensive starting<br>
materials. This object is surprisingly achieved by the process defined hereinafter.<br>
The present invention provides a process for preparing sulfuric diamides of the general<br>
formula I designated above, comprising the following steps:<br>
1) the reaction of a secondary amine of the formula II<br>
R1R2NH (II)<br>
in which R^ and R^ are each as defined above with sulfuryi chloride in an inert<br>
solvent, especially an aromatic solvent, in the presence of a tertiary amine to give<br>
a sulfamoyi chloride of the formula III<br>
R1R2N-S(0)2-CI (III)<br>
in which Ri and R^ are each as defined above, and<br>
ii) reaction of the sulfamoyi chloride of the formula III obtained in step i) with<br>
ammonia,<br>
the sulfamoyi chloride of the formula III being used in step ii) in the form of the solution<br>
obtained in step i) in the inert solvent, especially the aromatic solvent.<br>
The process according to the invention is associated with a series of advantages.<br>
Firstly, the process according to the invention is comparatively easy to perform. In<br>
addition, it affords the desired sulfuric diamides I in good yields, both based on the<br>
secondary amine used and on the sulfuryi chloride used. The release of hydrogen<br>
chloride is substantially or even completely avoided. The use of expensive starting<br>
materials such as chlorosulfonyl isocyanate is not required. The reaction can<br>
additionally be handled efficiently on the industrial scale. Moreover, the sulfuric<br>
diamides I are obtained in a purity sufficient for further use, and so it requires no<br>
M/48074<br>
complicated purification processes.<br>
In step i) of the process according to the invention, a secondary amine of the formula II,<br>
as defined above, is reacted with sulfuryl chloride in an inert solvent, especially an<br>
aromatic solvent, in the presence of a tertiary amine. This affords a solution of a<br>
sulfamoyi chloride of the formula III, also referred to hereinafter as chlorosulfonamide<br>
III.<br>
The tertiary amine serves as an auxiliary base to bind the hydrogen chloride released<br>
in the reaction and is used typically in an amount of at least 0.9 equivalent, preferably<br>
in an amount of at least 1.0 equivalent, for example in an amount of from 1.0 to 2<br>
equivalents, and especially in an amount of from 1.05 to 1.5 equivalents, based on the<br>
secondary amine. The term "equivalents" is equivalent to the term "mole per mole" or<br>
"molar equivalents".<br>
The type of tertiary amine is of minor importance for the reaction. Suitable tertiary<br>
amines comprise triaikylamines, especially those having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms in<br>
the alkyl radicals, N-cycloalkyl-N,N-dialkylamines, especially N-cyclohexyl-N,N-<br>
dialkylamines having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alky! radicals, N,N-dialkylanilines<br>
having preferably from 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl radicals, and also pyridine and<br>
quinoline bases.<br>
Examples of suitable tertiary amines are:<br>
from the group of the triaikylamines: trimethylamine, triethylamine, tri-n-<br>
propylamine, tri-n-butyiamine, dimethylethylamine, dimethyl-n-propylamine,<br>
dimethyl-n-butylamine, dimethylisopropylamine, dimethyl-2-butylamine,<br>
diethyl-n-propylamine, diethylisopropylamine, diethyl-n-butylamine, tri-n-<br>
hexylamine and the like;<br>
from the group of the N-cycloa!kyl-N,N-dialkylamines:<br>
dimethylcyclohexylamine and diethylcyclohexylamine;<br>
from the group of the N,N-dialkylanilines: dimethylaniline and diethylaniline;<br>
from the group of the pyridine and quinoline bases: pyridine, a-,p- and y-<br>
picoline, quinoline and isoquinoline.<br>
Preferred tertiary amines are triaikylamines and N-cycloalkyl-N,N-dialkylamines,<br>
especially tri-Ci-Ce-alkylamines and N-cyclohexyl-N,N-di-Ci-C6-alkylamines. In a<br>
particularly preferred embodiment, the tertiary amine used is a tri-Ci-Ce-alkylamine and<br>
especially trimethylamine or triethylamine.<br>
The process according to the invention is suitable in principle for preparing sulfuric<br>
diamides of any secondary aliphatic or cyclic amines. Suitable secondary amines can<br>
be described by the general formula II. Preference is given to using those secondary<br>
M/48074<br>
<br>
4<br>
amines of the formula II in which the R^ and R^ radicals are bonded to the nitrogen<br>
atom via a primary carbon atom (CH2 group) or via a secondary carbon atom (CHR, R<br>
= alkyl radical). R' and R^ may be primary or secondary alkyl radicals having preferably<br>
from 1 to 6 or from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, or a cycloalkyi radical having preferably 5 or 6<br>
carbon atoms. R^ and R^ may be the same or different. R^ and R^ may, hov/ever,<br>
together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded, also form a 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-<br>
membered, saturated nitrogen heterocycle which, as well as the nitrogen atom, may<br>
have a further heteroatom selected from O and S as a ring member and which may<br>
optionally be substituted, but the a-carbon atoms (the carbon atoms bonded to the<br>
nitrogen) are preferably unsubstituted or have one substituent.<br>
The expression "primary alkyl radical having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms" represents a<br>
saturated linear or branched hydrocarbon radical which has from 1 to 8 and especially<br>
from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and is bonded to the nitrogen atom via a CH2 group.<br>
Examples of primary alkyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, n-propyi, n-butyl, 2-methylpropyl<br>
(isobutyl), n-pentyl, 2-methylbutyl, 3-methylbutyl, n-hexyl, 2-methylpentyl, 3-<br>
methylpentyl, 4-methylpentyl, 2-ethylbutyl, etc.<br>
The expression "secondary alkyl radical having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms" represents a<br>
saturated acyclic hydrocarbon radical which has from 3 to 8 carbon atoms and is<br>
bonded via a secondary carbon atom and as nitrogen atom. Examples of secondary<br>
alkyl radicals are 2-propyl (1-methylethyl), 2-butyl, 2-pentyl, 3-pentyl, 2-hexyl, 3-hexyl,<br>
3-methyl-2-butyl, 3-methyl-2-pentyl, 4-methyl-2-pentyl etc.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a secondary amine II in which the two R^<br>
and R2 radicals are different alkyl radicals is used. The same applies to the formulae I<br>
and III. More particularly, the R' radical in the formulae I, II and III is a primary alkyl<br>
radical having from 1 to 8, in particular having from 1 to 6 and especially having 1 or 2<br>
carbon atoms, or is a secondary alkyl radical having from 3 to 8, in particular from 3 to<br>
6 and especially having 3 or 4 carbon atoms. The R^ radical is especially a secondary<br>
alkyl radical having from 3 to 8, in particular from 3 to 6 and especially 3 or 4 carbon<br>
atoms. More particularly, R^ is a primary alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms<br>
and especially methyl or ethyl, and R^ is a secondary alkyl radical having from 3 to 8, in<br>
particular from 3 to 6 and especially 3 or 4 carbon atoms, and is especially isopropyl or<br>
2-butyi. In a very particularly preferred embodiment, a secondary amine of the formula<br>
II in which R^ is methyl and in which R^ is a secondary alkyl radical having from 3 to 8,<br>
in particular from 3 to 6 and especially 3 or 4 carbon atoms. More particularly, the<br>
secondary amine used is N-(1-methylethyl)-N-methylamine (R^ = methyl, R2 =<br>
methylethyl = isopropyl).<br>
The secondary amine of the formula II and the sulfuryl chloride are preferably used in a<br>
molar ratio suitable for the stoichiometry of the reaction, which is preferably in the<br>
M/48074<br>
<br>
<br>
range from 1:1.1 to 1.1:1, in particular in the range from 1:1.05 to 1.05:1 and especially<br>
in the range from 1:1.02 to 1.02:1.<br>
According to the invention, step i) proceeds in an inert solvent, especially an aromatic<br>
solvent.<br>
An inert solvent is understood to mean organic solvents which do not enter into any<br>
chemical reactions with the reagents, especially with sulfury! chloride, under the<br>
reaction conditions. These include especially aromatic, aliphatic, araliphatic and<br>
cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, and also chlorinated and fluorinated hydrocarbons.<br>
Nitrogen-containing and/or oxygen-containing solvents are generally not inert,<br>
especially when they have OH or NH groups (so-called protic solvents). The proportion<br>
of non-inert solvents in the inert solvent is generally not more than 10% by volume,<br>
based on the total amount of the solvent. The inert solvent preferably does not<br>
comprise any oxygen-containing and/or nitrogen-containing, aprotic solvents (
volume).<br>
An "aromatic solvent" is understood to mean those solvents whose main constituents<br>
are aromatic compounds which are derived from benzene and are liquid at room<br>
temperature. Such compounds include, for example, as well as benzene,<br>
alkylbenzenes such as toluene, xylenes, trimethylbenzene and ethylbenzene, and also<br>
chlorinated and/or fluorinated benzenes such as chlorobenzene, fluorobenzene and<br>
dichlorobenzenes.<br>
In addition to these aromatic compounds, the aromatic solvent may also comprise up to<br>
50% by volume, in particular not more than 30% by volume and especially not more<br>
than 10% by volume of different inert solvents, for example aliphatic halohydrocarbons,<br>
e.g. dichloromethane, trichloromethane and/or dichloroethane, aliphatic or<br>
cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons such as n-hexane, n-heptane, octane, cyclohexane,<br>
cycloheptane, cyclooctane and mixtures thereof. In addition, the aromatic solvent may<br>
also comprise small amounts of non-inert, aprotic oxygen-containing and/or nitrogen-<br>
containing solvents, in which case their proportion makes up preferably not more than<br>
10% by volume, based on the total amount of the solvent. The aromatic solvent<br>
preferably comprises no oxygen-containing and/or nitrogen-containing, aprotic solvents<br>
(
Typically, the secondary amine II is reacted with suifuryl chloride in the substantial or<br>
complete absence of protic solvents such as water or alcohols. The proportion of water<br>
and protic organic solvents will generally not be more than 0.1% (1000 ppm) and in<br>
particular not more than 500 ppm, especially not more than 300 ppm, based on the<br>
total amount of solvent used.<br>
<br>
<br>
Preferred aromatic compounds which are useful as aromatic solvents are, as well as<br>
benzene, alkylbenzenes such as toluene, xylenes, trimethylbenzene and ethylbenzene,<br>
and also chlorinated and/or fluorinated benzenes such as chlorobenzene,<br>
fluorobenzene and dichiorobenzenes. In a preferred embodiment, the aromatic solvent<br>
comprises chlorobenzene. In particular chlorobenzene forms the main constituent, in<br>
particular at least 80%, more preferably at least 90 or at least 95% by volume of the<br>
aromatic constituents of the aromatic solvent. In particular, chlorobenzene is the sole<br>
constituent and makes up at least 95 and especially at least 98% by volume, based on<br>
the total amount of solvent.<br>
The reaction of the secondary amine of the formula II with sulfuryl chloride is effected<br>
preferably under temperature control and preferably at temperatures of not more than<br>
50°C, in particular not more than 30°C and especially not more than 20°C. The lower<br>
limit is generally determined by the melting point of the reaction mixture and the<br>
miscibility of the reaction mixture. Frequently, the lower limit in the reaction temperature<br>
will not go below -10°C. Frequently, the reaction of the secondary amine II with sulfuryl<br>
chloride is carried out at temperatures in the range from -10 to 50°C, in particular in the<br>
range from -10 to 30°C and especially in the range from -5 to 20°C.<br>
For the reaction of the secondary amine of the formula II with sulfuryl chloride, the<br>
procedure will preferably be to initially charge a portion or the total amount of the<br>
solvent and sulfuryl chloride in the reaction vessel, to bring the initial charge to the<br>
desired reaction temperature and to add the secondary amine II and the tertiary amine<br>
thereto. If appropriate, the secondary amine and the tertiary amine can be diluted with<br>
the solvent used for the reaction. The secondary amine II and the tertiary amine are<br>
preferably added simultaneously, especially as a mixture, such that the prefen-ed molar<br>
ratios of secondary amine II and tertiary amine in the reaction mixture are maintained.<br>
Since the reaction of sulfuryl chloride with the tertiary amine is exothermic, secondary<br>
amine and tertiary amine are preferably added under thermal control over a prolonged<br>
period, which is typically at least 20 minutes, in particular at least 30 minutes and<br>
especially at least 60 minutes. The maximum addition time is guided by economic<br>
considerations and will generally not exceed 15 hours and in particular 8 hours.<br>
Frequently, secondary amine II and tertiary amine are added within a period of from<br>
one hour to 10 hours and especially over a period of from 2 hours to 8 hours. If<br>
appropriate, the reaction can be completed by subjecting the reaction mixture, after the<br>
addition of secondary amine II and tertiary amine has ended, to a postreaction, which is<br>
typically in the range from 10 minutes to 8 hours and in particular in the range from 30<br>
minutes to 6 hours. The total duration of addition and postreaction phase preferably will<br>
not exceed a duration of 15 hours and in particular 10 hours.<br>
The concentration of the reactants, i.e. the total amount of sulfuryl chloride, secondary<br>
amine II and tertiary amine, is preferably from 10 to 50% by weight and in particular<br>
M/48074<br>
<br>
<br>
from 20 to 40% by weight, based on the total weight of the reaction mixture.<br>
In this way, a reaction mixture which comprises the sulfamoyi chloride III dissolved in<br>
the solvent is obtained. In addition, the reaction mixture also comprises the salts<br>
formed in the reaction, i.e. the hydrogen chloride addition salts of the tertiary amine.<br>
The reaction mixture thus obtained can be reacted directly with ammonia in step 11) of<br>
the process according to the invention. Preference is given, however, to removing the<br>
salts fonned in the reaction by extraction, before the reaction with ammonia in step ii) is<br>
performed. The extraction is effected typically under aqueous acidic conditions, i.e. at<br>
pH 
extraction, a dilute acid, especially dilute hydrochloric acid. In particular, dilute<br>
hydrochloric acid having a hydrogen chloride content in the range from 2 to 20% by<br>
weight and especially in the range from 5 to 15% by weight is used. The extraction can<br>
be effected by single or multiple treatment with the dilute aqueous acid. Preference is<br>
given to effecting the extraction at temperatures below 30°C and especially below<br>
20°C, for example in the range from 0 to 30°C and especially in the range from 0 to<br>
20°C. The aqueous phase comprising the hydrochloride of the tertiary amine is<br>
removed. Any water fractions can be removed by distillation. The distillative removal<br>
can be effected at standard pressure and is preferably carried out under reduced<br>
pressure. If appropriate, aromatic solvent which has been distilled off will be replaced.<br>
The solution of the sulfamoyi chloride of the formula III in the inert solvent thus<br>
obtained is reacted with ammonia in step ii). If appropriate, the concentration of<br>
sulfamoyi chloride is adjusted by adding further inert, especially aromatic solvents. The<br>
concentration of sulfamoyi chloride in the inert solvent in step ii) will preferably be in the<br>
range from 5 to 50% by weight, in particular from 10 to 40% by weight and especially<br>
from 20 to 30% by weight.<br>
The ammonia required for the reaction can be supplied in gaseous form or in the form<br>
of a solution, generally a nonaqueous solution. When the ammonia is supplied in the<br>
fonn of a solution, the solvent comprises generally less than 1% protic constituents<br>
such as water.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the ammonia is supplied in gaseous form.<br>
Preference is then given to performing the reaction in an ammonia atmosphere. The<br>
partial pressure of the ammonia in this ammonia atmosphere is typically in the range<br>
from 0.5 to 50 bar, in particular in the range from 1 to 30 bar and especially in the<br>
range from 2 to 20 bar. If appropriate, the gaseous ammonia can be diluted with a<br>
gaseous inert, for example air, nitrogen or argon or a mixture of these gases. The ratio<br>
of the partial ammonia pressure to the total partial pressure of all inerts is, however,<br>
preferably at least 1:1, in particular at least 5:1 and especially at least 10:1. The total<br>
M/48074<br>
<br>
<br>
pressure of all gaseous constituents will generally not exceed 50 bar, in particular<br>
30 bar and especially 20 bar. In the course of the reaction of the sulfamoyi chloride with<br>
ammonia, the partial pressure of the ammonia in the reaction vessel will be kept within<br>
the abovementioned ranges.<br>
The reaction of the sulfamoyi chloride III with the ammonia is effected typically at<br>
temperatures in the range from 10 to lOCC, especially in the range from 30 to 8D°C.<br>
The reaction time required for the reaction is generally from 2 to 24 h, especially from 4<br>
to16h.<br>
The reaction in step ii) affords a reaction mixture which comprises the sulfuric diamide<br>
of the general formula I together with the ammonium chloride formed as a by-product in<br>
the reaction in the inert solvent, especially the aromatic solvent. Before a further<br>
reaction, the ammonium chloride is generally removed. Since the ammonium chloride<br>
is present as a suspended solid in the inert solvent, it can in principle be removed by<br>
filtration. Preference is given to removing the ammonium chloride by means of an<br>
aqueous extraction. Preference is given to effecting the aqueous extraction at a pH of<br>

for the extraction, in particular dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid and especially aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid having a hydrogen chloride content of from 2 to 20% by weight and<br>
especially from 5 to 15% by weight. The aqueous extraction of the reaction mixture can<br>
be carried out once or more than once.<br>
Preference is given to reextracting the combined aqueous extracts once or more than<br>
once with a suitable organic solvent in which the sulfuric diamide I is soluble, in<br>
particular an aromatic solvent and especially with the inert solvent used for the<br>
reaction, especially the aromatic solvent used for the reaction, in order to prevent yield<br>
losses. The extracted reaction mixture, if appropriate after combination with the<br>
reextracts, comprises the sulfuric diamide I in dissolved form with a purity sufficient for<br>
further reactions. The solution can therefore be sent to further reactions as such or<br>
after isolation of the sulfuric diamide I. If appropriate, the solution of the sulfuric diamide<br>
I will be concentrated by distillation, which likewise removes any water and/or acid<br>
present in the solvent. It is also possible to isolate the sulfuric diamide from the solution<br>
thus obtained in a customary manner, for example by concentrating to dryness or by<br>
crystallization, if appropriate with addition of organic solvents in which the sulfuric<br>
diamide I is not soluble.<br>
The sulfuric diamides of the general formula I thus obtained can be used especially to<br>
prepare active herbicidal ingredients of the general formula IV.<br>
In formula, R^ and R2 are each as defined above. R^ is hydrogen or C1-C4-alkyl, R' is<br>
hydrogen, C1-C4-alkyl or C1-C4-haloalkyl, X and Y are each hydrogen or halogen,<br>
where one of the X or Y radicals may also be CN.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further relates to the use of the process according to<br>
the invention for preparing sulfuric diamides of the formula I for the preparation of<br>
active herbicidal ingredients of the general fonnula IV.<br>

Preparation of N-methyl-N-(1-methylethyl)aminosulfonamide (compound I where<br>
Ri=methyl, R2=1-methylethyl)<br>
A reaction vessel was initially charged under inert gas atmosphere with 137.7 g<br>
(1.0 mol) of sulfuryl chloride in 800 g of chlorobenzene and cooled to internal<br>
temperature -5°C. To this were added, over a period of 300 minutes, a mixture of<br>
73.1 g (I.Omol) of isopropylmethylamine and 116.3 g (1.15 mol) of triethylamine, in the<br>
course of which the temperature was kept within the range from 0 to 5°C by cooling.<br>
After the addition had ended, the resulting suspension was stirred at 10°C for a further<br>
120 minutes. The suspension was then added to 250 g of 10% hydrochloric acid at<br>
10°C. The phases were separated at 10°C and the organic phase was washed again<br>
<br>
<br>
with 250 g of 10% aqueous hydrochloric acid at 10°C. The organic phase was removed<br>
and concentrated under reduced pressure (30 mbar, 22 to 4rC), in order to remove<br>
water. In this way, 570 g of a solution of N-isopropyl-N-methylsulfamoyI chloride in<br>
chlorobenzene (about 25% by weight) were obtained. This corresponds to a yield of<br>
84%.<br>
343.4 g of the solution of N-isopropyl-N-methylsulfamoyI chloride in chlorobenzene<br>
(25% strength by weight) obtained in step 1) were introduced into a pressure vessel<br>
which was flushed with nitrogen and ammonia. Subsequently, the partial pressure of<br>
the ammonia was increased to 5 bar. The reactor contents were then heated to 50°C,<br>
and this temperature was maintained for 8 hours, in the course of which an ammonia<br>
pressure of 6 bar was maintained. The suspension obtained here was added to 210 g<br>
of aqueous hydrochloric acid (8% strength), which dissolved the solids present in the<br>
reaction mixture. The pH of the aqueous phase was about 2. The phases were<br>
separated at 40°C and the aqueous phase was extracted twice with 372 g of<br>
chlorobenzene each time. In this way, 1065 g of a 6.3% by weight solution of the title<br>
compound in chlorobenzene was obtained, which corresponds to a yield of 88%. The<br>
solution can be used directly in the subsequent reaction.<br>
