Portable unit for the input of data in a digital device.<br>
The present invention concerns a portable unit	for the<br>
input of data,,  i.e. alphanumerical data and/or	function<br>
commands* in a digital device with which it	can be<br>
connected.<br>
In particular, this invention concerns a unit for the input of data and commands in portable digital devices having small dimensions, such as for example handheld computers and PDA's, as well as digital devices for mobile communication sjuch as WAP or GSM and mobile GPS systems.<br>
It is known that these devices in most cases make use of a keyboard f.or the input of data. Due to the restricted dimensions and also due to the further miniaturization of such devices, the keys and their mutual distances are becoming smaller and smaller, as a result of which it is becoming more and more difficult to press a single selected key with the fingers without simultaneously activating neighboring keys.<br>
Moreover, among others due to the restricted dimensions of the devices, the number of keys is restricted, so that in most cases, a single key has to be used foT" s'everal alpha-numerical symbols and/or function commands.<br><br>
WO O2/OX225M	PCT/BKO2/(HHM6<br>
2<br>
The required symbol is selected from the number of selected symbols by pressing the key concerned one or several times at short intervals.<br>
By pausing in between two key strokes, the last selected symbol is confirmed and inputted in the connected digital device, and thus said device is instructed that a following symbol or command will be given.<br>
Not only is this method rather time-consuming and not very suitable for fast data input, also an important number of keys is still required to cover all alphanumerical symbols and possibly extra function keys in a user-friendly and practical way.<br>
The present invention aims to provide a solution therefor.<br>
To this end, the invention consists of a portable unit for the input of alphanumerical data and/or function commands in a digital device, which unit comprises a control panel and attached thereto a base plate with pressure contacts which are connected to an electronic processing unit,<br>
whereby a table is provided on the control panel with a number of rows and columns consisting of fields and with a group of symbols in a number of fields symbolizing the alphanumerical data or the function commands,<br>
and the pressure contacts on the base plate are positioned in two rows which extend parallel to the rows and columns<br><br>
WO U2/OW2250	PC I7BEO2/OIMM6<br>
3<br>
of the table, and whereby each of these pressure contacts is situated in the extension of a row or of a column,<br>
whereby this an it further comprises two selection elements which can be moved in relation to the pressure contacts and the table, parallel to the rows and the columns respectively, into positions in which they are situated opposite to a pressure contact in the extension of a selected row, a selected column respectively,<br>
and comprises a pressure mechanism which can toe manually operated to change the position of the pressure contacts situated opposite to the selection elements by means of the latter,<br>
and a number of additional pressure contacts which can be manually operated, whose number is equal to the maximum number of symbols of a field, and which each correspond to one particular symbol of a selected field.<br>
The input of alphanumerical data and/or function commands can be carried out very fast and in a simple manner. It is sufficient to place the two selection elements opposite to the required field and to manually operate the pressure mechanism and one of the additional pressure contacts.<br>
The additional pressure contacts which can be manually operated are preferably provided on the base plate.<br><br>
WO H2/OX225O	l"<:i7be02></:i7be02>
4<br>
Each essure contact co be manually operated preferably also contains a push button, apart from a switch mechanism, and this push button is part of the pressure mechanism.<br>
Thus, by pressing a single push button, it is possible to operate the pressure mechanism as well as the switch mechanism of a pressure contact to be manually operated in order to select a symbol -<br>

WOII2/IIM2250	PC."l/l*Ki"2/*iiHi4f.<br>
7<br>
extension of Che rows of row and column pressure contacts 4 and b.<br>
Apart from the three pressure contacts 6, the pressure mechanism 7 comprises a linkage construction ?1 working in conjunction with the latter, composed of two bars 22 and 23 which are perpendicular to one another and fixed to one another, situated between the pressure contacts 4 and 5 and the control panel 1, and which together cross all the pressure contacts 4, b and 6.<br>
The far end 24 of the bar 23 is spring-mounted on the side of the pressure contacts 6 by means of a spring 25 fixed on the base plate 3. The other far end 26 of the bar 23 and the free end 27 of the bar 22 are hinge-mounted to the base plate 3.<br>
Around every bar 2? and 23 is provided a slidxng eye 28, 29 respectively, upon which is provided a locking pin 30 or 31 which is directed towards the pressure contacts 4 and 5.<br>
Said sliding eye 28 or 29 is U-shaped and is suspended to the middle of a little wheel 32 or 33 which rolls over the linkage construction 21 and is partly situated in a guiding groove 34 and 35 in the bottom side of the control panel 1.<br>
Moreover, each sliding eye 28 or 29 is fixed x.o a far end of the guide wire 19 or 20 of the slide button 18 whose sliding direction is parallel to that of the slid ing eye 28 or 29 concerned, and thus is part of the selection element<br>

The three pressure contacts 6 each contain, apart from a switch mechanism 36, a push button 3? protruding through a guide opening 38 in the control panel 1, an
The push button 37 is pressed into its position of rest by means of a spring 40. In this position, its collar 41 will touch the control panel 1 and it will not exert any pressure on the linkage construction 21.<br>
The pressure contacts 4, 5 and 6 are electrically connected to an electronic processing unit 43 by means of conductors 42, which is to be connected in turn to a digital device 46 via a conductor 44 and a connection element 45.<br>
The 'processing unit 43-, as is represented in figure 5, ' consis~rsr erf"a microprocessor 47 whose entries are connected to the pressure contacts 4, 5 and 6 and whose port leads to the connection element 45 via a buffer 48 and an interface 49.<br>
The working of the above-described unit is quite simple and as follows:<br>
The guide wires 19 and 20 are placed opposite to a row 14, column 15 respectively by means of the slide buttons 18 in order to select a field 13 situated above Che crossing of both guide wires 19 and 20, as represented in figure 1.<br><br>
WO H2/IW225O	KT/BKO2/lMliur&gt;<br>
																																																																													9<br>
The sliding eyes 28, 29 respectively, with the locking pins 30, 31 respectively attached to it, are in this manner placed above a corresponding row pressure contact 4, column pressure contact 5 respectively, situated in the extension of the selected row 14, column 15 respectively, by means of the guide wires 19, 20 respectively.<br>
Thanks to the presence of the little wheels 32 and 33, this sliding movement does not experience much resistance, and the guide wires 19 and 20 always remain parallel to the rows 14 and the columns 15.<br>
In a following step, one symbol 16 is selected from the selected field 13 by pressing the push button 37 of one corresponding pressure contact 6, for example but not necessarily so with the other hand than the one with which the slide buttons 18 have been moved, as represented in figure 1.<br>
Thanks to this operation, the position of the switch mechanism 36 of the above-mentioned pressure contact 6 is altered by the far end 39.<br>
Simultaneously, the linkage construction 21 is pushed by the button 37, against the spring 40, towards the base panel 3.<br>
The bars 22 and 23 hereby pivot at their far ends 26 and 27, and these bars are pushed towards the base plate 3, against the action of the spring 25.<br><br><br>
10<br>
The bars 22 and 23 push the sliding eyes 28 and 29 towards the base panel 3, as a result of which the locking pins 30 and 31 change the position of the selected row or co ¦ i(nn pressure contact 4 or 5 situated underneath it.<br>
By pressing a single push button 3?, the positions o: a single row pressure contact 4, a single column pressure contact 5 and a single pressure contact 6 are simultaneously changed in a combination which univocally characterizes a single selected symbol 16.<br>
The ensuing electric signals are translated by the electronic processing unit 4 3 into a digital signal which is recognizable to the digital device 4 6 with which the unit is connected as represented in figures 6 and 1.<br>
The digital device 46 can be a PDA, as represented in figure 6. The unit is provided with one end in a groove in the PDA. In this groove are provided the necessary contacts for transmitting the signal of the unit to the device 46.<br>
The alphanumencal data or function commands then become visible on the screen 50 of the PDA.<br>
Naturally, the device itself may also be provided with a screen 50. This screen can be provided next to the window 12.<br><br>
WO 02/082250	<br>
According to an embodiment which is not represented in the figures, it is also possible to replace the window 12 by an electronic screen upon which the fields 13 with the symbols 16 are represented and upon which are also represented a vertical and a horizontal line respectively, also in a sliding manner in relation to the selection elements 8-9.<br>
Figure 7 represents the unit coupled to a mobile phone.<br>
In all cases, one particular symbol is selected and confirmed by means of a restricted number of manual operations, in particular by moving two selection elements 8 and 9 and by pressing one of the pressure contacts 6 to be manually operated, and a corresponding signal is sent to the device 46.<br>
The pressure contacts 6 must not necessarily be part of the pressure mechanism 7.<br>
The slide buttons 18 and the pressure contacts 6 must not necessarily be situated in the positions represented in the drawings. In a left-handed embodiment, they can be placed mirrorwise in relation to an axial line of the table 2 which is parallel to the columns 15.<br>
Figures 8 and 9 represent a variant of an embodiment of the unit represented in figure 1, whereby this variant of an embodiment mainly differs from that in figure 1 in that:<br>
-  the pressure contacts 4-5 are in this ca.se situated on the opposite side of the unit,  whereby these pressure<br><br><br>
12<br>
contacts 4-5 are situated more in particular under the grooves 17 of the corresponding slide buttons 18 of the selection elements 8-9, and whereby the corresponding locking pins 30-31 of these selection elements 8-9 are in this case suspended to the lower side of the slide buttons 18 by means of little springs 51;<br>
the linkage construction 21 of the pressure mechanism 7 is in this case made in the shape of a rectangular frame which works in conjunction with the above-mentioned locking pins 30-31, whereby this linkage construction 21 extends parallel to the base 3 and is formed of bars which are mutually fixed to one another, namely the above-mentioned bars 22 and 23 and two extra bars, 52 and 53 respectively, which extend under the grooves 17 between the slide buttons 18 and the corresponding locking pins 30-31;<br>
the linkage construction 21 is in this case fixed in a sliding manner on the base 3 by means of two guides 54 which are provided at right angles on the base 3 for example on the far ends 24 and 26 of the bar 23, whereby each of these guides 54 consists for example of a small case 55 which is attached on the base and in which a pin 56 connected to the bar 23 is provided in a si iding manner;<br>
the linkage construction 21 is spring-mounted on the base 3 by means of little springs 57 which are provided between said linkage construction 21 and the base 3, for example each around one of the aforesaid guides 54;<br><br>
WO02/0K2250	PCT/BE02/1MMUA<br>
13<br>
the three additional pressure contacts 6 are in this case situated at equal distances next to the rod 23, whereby the corresponding push buttons 37 of these pressure contacts 6 are part of the pressure mechanism 7, as, when they are pushed in, they press onto part 58 which radially protrudes from the middle of the bar 23, as a result of which the linkage construction 21 is pushed towards the base 3.<br>
The use and operation of the unit from figures 8 and 9 is as follows-<br>
By means of the slide buttons 18 and the guide wires 19 and 20 respectively attached thereto, a field of symbols 13 is first of all selected above the crossing of the guide wires 19-20.<br>
By shifting the slide buttons 18, the locking pins 30 and 31 suspended onto them are also provided above the pressure contacts 4 and 5 respectively which are situated in the extension of the row 14 and the column 15 respectively, corresponding to the selected field of symbols 13.<br>
Next, one of the three push buttons 37 of the pressure contacts 6 is pressed so as to select one of the three symbols 16 in the selected field of symbols 13.<br>
By pressing the push button 37, the switch mechanism 36 of the pressure contact 6 situated underneath it is switched, and the linkage construction 21  is simultaneously moved<br><br><br>
14<br>
parallel to itself towards the base plate 3, so chat the respective bars 52 and 53 of the linkage construction 21 push the corresponding locking pins 30 and 31 down, against the action of the springs 51, so that the pressure contacts 4 and 5 situated underneath it are also switched.<br>
By pressing a single push button 37, the positions of a single row pressure contact 4, a single column pressure contact 5 and a single pressure contact 6 are simultaneously changed in a combination which univocally characterizes a single selected symbol 16.<br>
Further, the working of this unit is entirely analogous to that of the unit from figure 1.<br>
The invention is by no means limited to the above-described embodiments represented in the accompanying drawings; on the contrary, such a unit for the Input of data can be made in all sorts of variants while still remaining within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
