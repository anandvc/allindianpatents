FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of estimation of torque from direct<br>
online starting at free running condition of an induction motor. More particularly<br>
the subject invention is related to measurement of electro magnetic torque<br>
produced by an induction motor at any speed in the range from standstill to its<br>
full speed.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A motor which is an electromagnetic device that converts electrical energy to<br>
mechanical energy. The electrical energy conversion device related to an<br>
induction motor works on the principle of electromagnetic energy conversion and<br>
while accepting electrical energy it converts it into a mechanical rotational energy<br>
and involves the principle of electromagnetic induction. The equipment in<br>
question is a large size induction motor which has a three phase winding on the<br>
stationary part and a short circuited cage winding in the rotating part. The<br>
stationary part is known commonly as stator and the rotating part as rotor. Since<br>
there are various sizes of induction motors used for industrial and domestic<br>
purposes it is helpful to<br>
categories it into range of capacity as small, medium and large. While a small<br>
capacity motor may only deliver a few watts to a few kilowatt of power, a<br>
medium capacity motor delivers a few hundred kilowatts of power to about<br>
thousand kilowatts and the large capacity motors would deliver the range from a<br>
thousand kilowatt and above. This invention is concerned with medium and large<br>
size induction motors.<br><br><br>
The stator comprises of an iron part which consists of magnetic steel stamping sheets and<br>
windings. The stampings are punched to form a toothed surface on the inner side for the<br>
purpose of locating the windings. The function of the magnetic sheets is to carry the<br>
magnetic flux while the windings carry the electrical currents. When the windings are<br>
connected to an electrical power source the currents flow through these and a magnetic<br>
flux is created which permeates everywhere. The shape of the stator is cylindrical with a<br>
hollow bore. The rotor is also solid cylindrical in construction and resides within the stator<br>
and thus the magnetic flux created by the stator also engulfs the rotor. Similar to the<br>
stator the rotor is also made of magnetic steel stampings and windings. A small gap<br>
separates the stator from rotor which is commonly known as air-gap, and it facilitates the<br>
smooth rotation of the machine.<br>
The configuration of the structure of motor described in this invention is a commonly<br>
adopted one for large induction motors in industry. There are other configurations also<br>
such as axial motor or spherical motors which are mostly for special purpose and are of<br>
smaller capacity.<br>
When the stator windings are connected to an electrical power source, while the motor is<br>
in a stationary condition, heavy currents flow through the winding which brings the rotor<br>
into a rotational state. Within a few seconds the motor attains a high speed, which is very<br>
close to its synchronous speed, and is a function of the winding design. The time taken to<br>
start a motor is short and during this short interval the motor accelerates to attain a<br>
higher speed. The electromagnetic torque produced in the motor helps the motor to<br>
accelerate and the amount of torque produced is a function of the speed. The torque<br>
produced at any speed is an important feature of the machine. It is the endeavour of the<br>
machine manufacturers and the user to measure the torque characteristics.<br><br><br>
The torque versus speed characteristics of an induction motor is also estimated from the<br>
measured rotor speed, knowing the inertia of the rotating mass. Since this method is not<br>
so accurate the torque speed characteristics is directly measured using a dynamometer,<br>
which is a loading device, and amounts to loading of the motor to its rated operating<br>
power or more. Since the later method of loading requires expensive tests facility and<br>
consumes large power, it is limited to only small capacity motors.<br>
The proposed invention addressed to this difficulty of measurement of torque-speed<br>
characteristics of an induction motor with the direct-online starting of a motor in free<br>
running condition in order to control generation of torque to secure accurate torque speed<br>
characteristics according to specification. The direct-online starting method of any motor<br>
is a severe condition as heavy currents are drawn from the power source. However,<br>
during this starting duration the motor traces the complete characteristic as it starts from<br>
standstill condition and attains the full speed. In the free-running condition the full speed<br>
is very close to its synchronous speed.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
In a number of patents methods have been proposed which are basically for obtaining the<br>
diagnostics of an induction motor while the motor is under operation. The U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,262,550 by Kliman, et.al. relates to electrical motor monitoring system and method. In<br>
this patent a sensorless torque monitoring system is described. In this method of torque<br>
calculation phasors representing the current and voltage of the motor output are utilized.<br>
The voltages and currents are acquired from the sampled data stored in the database.<br>
The best approximation to a fundamental phasor is extracted by discrete Fourier transform<br>
(DFT) or similar means very quickly for each voltage and current. Using the current and<br><br><br>
voltage phasors, the torque calculation is done algebraically in terms of the phasors. Since<br>
the voltage excitation is nearly a pure sine wave, nearly all of the information needed for<br>
torque calculations is carried by the current data. Little information is lost (but much<br>
efficiency is gained) by extracting the best fit of the voltage fundamental phasor<br>
calculation, which may then be analytically integrated to produce the flux linkage phasor.<br>
The flux linkage phasor is used to produce a time function that is combined with the<br>
current waveform to yield the time varying torque. Moreover, this calculation is done<br>
without numerical integration and, thus, is accomplished without the substantial<br>
processing resources used with prior torque calculations. In particular, instantaneous<br>
torque is computed by multiplying several factors times the "cross" product of flux and<br>
current. The method relies on measurement of voltage and current phasors, whereas in<br>
the proposed invention only currents are measured and the torque speed characteristics is<br>
estimated from the parameters of the induction motor. The parameters of the motor are<br>
in turn measured from standard routine test methods detailed in standards IS-325, IEC-<br>
60034 Part 12, 2002 and IEEE Standard 112, 1996. The proposed invention relies on the<br>
measurement of the currents in the three phase windings at a fast sampling rate and<br>
accurate measurement system. The recording process is on-line, but the torque<br>
calculation is an off-line process which is described in the body of the specification of this<br>
invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
One object of the invention is measurement of the electromagnetic torque produced by an<br>
induction motor at any speed in the range from standstill to its full speed.<br>
Another object of the invention is determination of torque of an induction motor from<br>
measurement yielding the torque versus speed characteristics of the motor which is vital<br>
for its operation in industry and field.<br><br><br>
A yet another object of the invention is to make it possible to carry out the measurement<br>
process in a fairly inexpensive manner by test setup which is proposed to utilize only the<br>
normally used test facilitates, and the complete test procedure is conducted in a short<br>
time, within a few minutes.<br>
A further objective of the invention is to measure torque speed characteristics under the<br>
transient condition by simple means, adopting known testing procedure.<br>
A still another objective of the invention is to compute torque of an induction motor by<br>
using four variables the three currents flowing in the stator windings, the speed of the<br>
rotor and using measured parameters namely the winding resistance, winding leakage<br>
resistance, magnetizing reactance and inertia of rotor, obtaining change of variables of dq<br>
model machine by transforming them dq-axis reference frame, reducing the relationship to<br>
four equations based on voltages and currents flowing in the coil circuits, further reducing<br>
to two sets of unknown rotor currents in dqr-reference frame, further simplifying flux<br>
linkages in terms of the currents, finally representing the induction motor by two coupled<br>
differential equations, solving the equations with measured currents and speed of the<br>
motor resulting flux linkages and estimating torque on calculating product of these two<br>
flux linkages form the reduced simplified two differential equation.<br>
The present invention relates to the estimation of torque speed characteristics of an<br>
induction motor from the measured transient currents and speed of the motor during free<br>
running and direct online starting of the motor. The following parameters are measured<br>
on a transient recorder with a sampling time of 0.0002 second, an accuracy of +/-0.5% on<br>
full scale, with 12 bit resolution and frequency response of DC to 3 MHz (-3 dB point):<br><br>
1.	R-phase current<br>
2.	Y-phase current<br>
3.	B-phase current<br>
4.	Speed of motor<br>
The currents and speed are recorded for a duration which allows the induction motor to start<br>
from a standstill condition and reach its final steady operating speed. Later the data recorded<br>
on the transient recorder is transferred to a computer and the data is processed using a<br>
computer program offline to get an estimate of the electromagnetic torque produced by the<br>
motor during the no-load direct-on-line starting. This computer program accepts the data<br>
recorded during the transient starting condition and the motor parameters measured from the<br>
no-load and block rotor test conducted on the motor as a routine test which are given below:<br>
1.	rs - stator winding resistance<br>
2.	xs - stator winding leakage reactance<br>
3.	rr - rotor winding resistance referred to stator winding<br>
4.	xr - rotor winding leakage reactance referred to stator winding<br>
5.	xm - magnetizing reactance<br>
6.	J - polar moment of inertia of rotor.<br>
The parameters K1 and J1 for the deep-bar effect are also required by the computer program<br>
(refer to Alger's book for deep bar effect and parameters K1 and J1).<br>
The computation of torque is carried out from the measurement data based on the dq-model<br>
of induction motor. The voltage-current relationships of the windings in the motor are<br>
functions of machine inductances which change with the rotor position, consequently the<br>
coefficients of the differential equations describing the voltage-current relationships vary with<br>
rotor position and time. In the proposed invention change of variables is used to reduce the<br><br><br>
complexity in the relationship. The change in variable is obtained by transforming them to a<br>
reference frame with two perpendicular axes which are called direct and quadrature axis and<br>
are commonly known as dq-axis. The machine model based on dq-axis is called dq-model.<br>
In this method all variables such as voltages, currents, flux etc. and all parameters such as<br>
inductances are transformed to the dq-frame. The subsequent relationships become simpler<br>
and are easier for implementation in computer.<br>
The voltages applied to the stator winding and the resulting currents flowing in the winding of<br>
the motor are transformed to the dq-reference frame. In the three-phase squirrel-cage<br>
inducting motor there are three set of windings made form interconnection of several coils.<br>
Because of the symmetry of these windings and the balanced nature of the voltages and<br>
currents flowing in these circuits and by adopting the transformation to the dq-frame it is<br>
possible to reduce the relationships to four numbers. Among these four relationships two are<br>
for the stator windings and two for rotor windings. Further since the squirrel-cage winding of<br>
the rotor is shorted, hence the voltage across these are zero. In addition it should be noted<br>
that the stator winding voltages are known and the stator winding currents are measured<br>
during the test. Consequently, there are only two set of unknowns which are the rotor<br>
currents in the dq-reference frame. A further simplification is carried out by representing the<br>
flux-linkage in terms of the currents. This helps in finally representing the induction motor by<br>
two coupled differential equations. Solution of these equations with the measured currents<br>
and speed of the motor will result in flux linkages and a product of these flux linkages results<br>
in the torque.<br>
In this procedure for estimation of the torque, four variables are used namely the three phase<br>
currents flowing in the stator windings, the speed of the rotor. The parameters used are the<br>
winding resistances, winding leakage reactances, the magnetizing reactance, and the inertia<br>
of the rotor. These parameters are calculated from standard test procedures which are<br>
covered in the standard IS-325, IEC-60034 Part 12, 2002 and IEEE Standard 112,1996.<br><br><br>
Therefore, the value of torque from these measurements results in a close estimation to the<br>
real value of torque. Further since the value of currents and speed change every instant the<br>
estimated torque also changes from instant to instant. For the currents which are alternating<br>
at a frequency of 50 cycles per second the time duration of one cycle is 0.02 second,<br>
therefore, the current samples are collected after a time duration of 0.0002 seconds which<br>
gives 100 samples during every cycle. In order to record the samples of the currents and<br>
speed at a fast rate a high resolution transient recorder is used. The accuracy of transient<br>
recorder used is 0.05% of the full scale, and the resolution is 12-bit. In other words while a<br>
current of 100 amperes can be measured with an accuracy ranging from 99.95 to 100.05<br>
amperes the resolution will be 1 in 4096 levels. Such transient recorders are available in the<br>
market.<br>
The Induction motor is started by direct application of the voltages to the motor windings<br>
when it is in standstill condition. The motor starts rotating and eventually reaches its full<br>
speed which is close to its full speed which is close to its synchronous speed. The time taken<br>
for the motor to reach its full speed from standstill is the starting time of the motor. The<br>
starting time of induction motors generally ranges from 1 to 20 seconds in case of motors in<br>
the range of 100 to 10,000 kW, and 1000 to 3000 rpm motors. This is only to indicate the<br>
order of starting time for a motor and the amount of data which is measured and has to be<br>
stored on the recorder. The data is of the order of 5 mega bytes from a test record.<br>
A computer is used for the estimation of torque from the measured data. Since the recording<br>
is carried out online and has to be done at a fast speed the computer connected to the<br>
recorder waits till the test is completed. Thereafter the data which is recorded in the memory<br>
of the transient recorder is transferred to the computer and the torque is estimated by the<br>
computer in an off-line manner. However, the complete procedure of data transfer and<br>
computation of torque is finished within a minute.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EACH ITEM IS GIVEN BELOW:<br>
1. Induction motor: The induction motor is the test motor for which the measurement is<br>
being carried out. In the figure it is shown in an uncoupled condition, which signifies its<br>
free running state. It is a three phase induction motor and has a provision for connection<br>
of the speed sensor, which is a tachogenerator, on the non-drive end of the shaft. The<br>
induction motor on which the test was carried out was of capacity 1100 kW, 6.6 kV, 3000<br>
rpm, flame proof squirrel cage induction motor with sleeve bearings.<br><br>
2.	Speed sensor / tachogenerator and transducer: In measurement of any quantity<br>
two aspects are involved, one is the conversion of the physical quantity into a measurable<br>
electrical signal and the second aspect is converting this electrical signal into a voltage /<br>
current signal which may be transmitted over cables to a recorder which is located at a<br>
distance from the test setup. The device which converts the signal from the sensor into a<br>
signal for transmission is called a transducer. Usually the sensor and the transducer are<br>
two separate devices. However, in this test setup a DC tachogenerator is used which is<br>
commonly available in a testing laboratory. The DC tachogenerator performs both the<br>
functions of sensor and transducer and produces a voltage signal which is powerful enough<br>
to be transmitted over cables. The DC tachogenerator used for the testing described here<br>
was of capacity 4000 rpm 200 V DC.<br>
3.	Current sensor and transducer: A hall current sensor is used for converting the current<br>
signal into a measurable electrical voltage signal and a transducer is also built into the<br>
same device which derives its power from the alternating magnetic flux emanating from the<br>
current carrying high voltage cable. The device is a clamp type equipment and produces at<br>
its terminals a milli-volts signal which can be communicated over shielded cable to the<br>
transient recorder. The current sensor capacity is 400 A rms, frequency 20 Hz to 20 kHz<br>
and the transducer output is 10 mili-volt per ampere. The accuracy of the transducer is +/-<br>
0.5 %.<br>
4. Transient recorder: The transient recorder is a recording instrument of the following<br>
specification. The device performs the function of digitising the analogue signals, namely<br>
the speed and currents, at a fast sampling rate of 0.0002 seconds and store it in its<br>
memory. The recorder also displays the recorder speed and currents on its screen. Since<br>
the recording time is short and the signals have to be recorded at a fast rate the recording<br>
function is done online along with the test when the motor is started by application of the<br><br>
direct-online voltages. Subsequently the recorded signals are transmitted to a micro-<br>
computer over a serial communication link on an off-line condition. It is important to note<br>
here that the transient recorder has an inbuilt timer with is accurate and provides the sample<br>
time. This time-record is used in the computation of torque.<br>

5. Contactor for application of power to motor winding: The contactor is a<br>
switch which performs both functions of application of power to the motor windings and<br>
also isolating it from the power source. Since the contactor is also used in conjunction<br>
with a protection device it should be capable if disconnecting the motor even while it is<br>
carrying large amount of fault currents. The contactor is a heavy duty and high voltage<br>

the event of any fault. The analogue relays for earth fault and over-current protection are<br>
commonly used in industry, but these days the analogue relays are replaced by<br>
microprocessor based multi-function numeric relay. In the present test setup a numeric<br>
relay was adopted with the following specifications. The relay provides a signal to the<br>
contactor to open. The switching ON of the motor is done.<br>

7.	Current and Voltage transformers:	Since the currents and voltages which are<br>
to be monitored are large the current and voltage transformers are used. These are<br>
commonly known as CTs and PTs and are used in all motor testbed setups. The purpose<br>
of using these devices is not only to reduce the measured quantities to safe limits but also<br>
to isolate the high voltage signals for safety purpose. Care should be taken to use<br>
calibrated and accurate CTs of 0.5 class.<br>
8.	Control desk for switching ON and monitoring functions: The control cubicle is<br>
located at a distance from the motor and the place from where the complete testing is<br>
controlled and monitored. The signals from CTs and PTs are brought to the cubicle and is<br>
monitored. Since the CTs are sensitive and accurate enough to measure the transient<br>
current, the current transducer can also be connected to the CT secondaries. The control<br>
desk is also equipped with measuring meters. The voltage and frequency meters are also<br>
present on the control desk and the voltage and frequency prior to the testing is noted.<br>
The ON button to signal the contactor to close is located on the control desk. The<br>
transient recorder is also placed near to the control desk. On pushing the ON button the<br>
contactor closes and the motor receives the power, and the test begins. After the motor<br>
attains the full speed the OFF button is pushed and the motor is isolated and the test<br>
culminates.<br>
9.	High voltage cables inter-connecting the motor to the power source: The<br>
high voltage cables interconnect the motor to the power source. These are copper cables<br>
with insulation covering suitable for 11 kV and an armour for protection. It is however not<br>
advisable to go near the cables or the motor while it is being tested. The complete<br>
operation is conducted remotely.<br>
10.	Shielded cable connecting the transducer to the transient recorder: The<br>
cables connecting the transducer to the recorder are shielded so that they do not<br>
introduce noise into the measurement.<br><br>
11.	Shielded cable connecting the transient recorder to micro computer (14):<br>
The transient recorder is connected to the micro-computer (14) through high speed USB<br>
port and the cable to connect the two devices is also special nature supplied by the<br>
manufacturer of transient recorder.<br>
12.	Printer: A printer is connected to the port of the micro-computer and it is meant for<br>
taking hard copies of the torque speed characteristics.<br>
13.	Tachogenerator coupling: The tachogenerator coupling is a flexible coupling to<br>
allow about 10 mm of axial movement of the rotor of main machine.<br>
14.	Computer<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF METHODOLOGY<br>
The objective of the invention is to measure the electromagnetic torque from the<br>
measured currents and for this purpose a simulation model of the induction motor is<br>
adopted. The simulation model is the commonly used dq-model of induction motor and it<br>
can be found in the reference book, P.C. Krause, 0. Wasynczuk, S.D. Sudhoff, "Analysis of<br>
Electrical Machinery and Drive Systems" publisher IEEE press, Wiley Interscience, year<br>
2004. For the simulation purpose the currents are transformed using the transformation<br>
method detailed in the said reference guidance. The transformed currents are given as<br>
follows:<br><br><br>
Where and are the transformed currents and are the three phase<br>
currents. The angle θ is the angular displacement of the reference frame with respect to<br>
the three phase current variables. Here it should be noted that the variables and<br>
  and θ are all functions of time, in other words they change from instant to<br>
instant. The angle θ is given by the following expression:<br><br>
Where ω(ξ) is the angular speed of the rotor which is measured using the speed sensor<br>
and ξ is the dummy variable of integration. The angle θ(0) is the value of angle between<br>
the two frames at the instant zero, which can be fixed arbitrarily.<br>
The induction machine model, based on dq-transformation, given by the said reference<br>
book is given as follows in equation (2).<br><br>
This expression is a set of six differential equations which relates the transformed voltages<br>
with the transformed flux-linkages. Further, the flux-linkages are related to the<br>
transformed currents. Since the three stator currents are being measured, and considering<br>
the fact that it is a balanced three-phase winding with balanced currents, four of the<br>
equations above equations are eliminated by manipulations and simplifications. Finally we<br>
arrive at the following two set of differential equations which represent the induction<br>
motor case in question.<br><br><br>
Knowing the rotor flux linkages  the stator flux linkages  can be<br>
calculated from the stator currents  and the rotor flux linkages. But these<br>
equations are of algebraic nature which is given below:<br><br>
In the same way the rotor currents can be calculated from the stator currents and the<br>
rotor flux linkages. And these equations are also of algebraic nature which is given below:<br><br>
With the flux linkages for stator and rotor circuits calculated the electromagnetic torque<br>
can be calculated from the expression given below:<br><br>
The electromagnetic torque and the speed are related by:<br><br><br>
The electromagnetic torque Te which is computed in the above expression is the output of<br>
all these computations. The above expressions are implemented in the software and with<br>
that the torque versus speed characteristics is computed.<br><br>
Embodiments of the proposed invention will be best understood from the following<br>
illustrative examples.<br>
The parameters pertaining to the induction motor equivalent circuit are generally found<br>
from some tests which are mentioned below:<br><br>
1.	Winding resistance: The resistances of the three phases windings are measured using a<br>
resistance bridge and the ambient temperature is also noted.<br>
2.	No load test: In this test the motor is supplied the nominal voltage while the motor is in<br>
free running condition. The voltages, currents, frequency, speed and the power are<br>
measured using standard meters. This test reveals the magnetizing reactance of the motor<br>
and also the no load losses.<br>
3.	Blocked rotor test: This test is conducted with the rotor in blocked condition and a<br>
reduced voltage applied to the stator. The voltages, currents, frequency and the power<br>
are measured using standard meters. This test reveals the stator and rotor resistances<br>
and the leakage reactances of the windings.<br>
4.	Retardation test: This test is conducted with the motor running at full speed and<br>
subsequently the supply being disconnected. The speed of the rotation is recorded with<br>
respect to time. This test reveals the moment of inertia of the rotating mass.<br>
Typical values of parameters of induction motors of different sizes are given below as an<br>
example in Table-1.<br><br><br><br>
From the parameters described in the table the torque speed characteristics of an<br>
induction motor can be estimated and a sample characteristics is given in Figure 3.<br>
The graph shown in Figure 3 is given for steady state condition. A steady state condition<br>
signifies a state when all quantities are steady, such as the voltage, current and speed.<br>
However, when an induction motor is started with direct-online application of voltage to<br>
the motor at its standstill condition the characteristics is different, as this is a transient<br>
condition. In a transient condition the current and speed are allowed to vary while the<br>
motor accelerates from its standstill condition and attains its full speed. The torque speed<br>
characteristics under the transient condition may be computed using the dq-model of the<br>
induction motor. A sample of the torque speed characteristics is given in Figure 4 .<br>
The torque produced by the induction motor is oscillatory in nature during the initial period<br>
and as the motor accelerates the torque attains a uni-directional value. If the torque<br>
produced by the motor is greater than the load torque the motor accelerates steadily and<br>
attains its rated condition.<br>
The measured values are fed to the computer program and the program estimates the<br>
torque speed characteristics from the measured values of the three-phase currents as<br>
estimated according to equation (6) and (7). A test carried out on an 1100 kW, 2 Pole,<br>
induction motor during the direct online starting transient is given in Figure 5.<br>
The invention as herein narrated with an embodiment through exemplary illustration<br>
should not be read and construed in a restrictive manner as many embodiments can be<br>
formed with various modifications of computer programme, alterations of the variables<br>
and parameters and adaptations for wide range of motor rating within the scope and<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
A METHOD OF ESTIMATION OF TORQUE FROM DIRECT ONLINE<br>
STARTING AT FREE RUNNING CONDITION OF AN INDUCTION MOTOR<br>
This invention related to a simplified measurement of the electromagnetic torque<br>
produced by an induction motor from measurements carried out while motor is<br>
started with the application of direct-online voltage to the motor terminals. The<br>
motor is supposed to be in standstill condition when the voltage is applied to the<br>
motor terminals and the three phase currents and speed are measured using a<br>
high speed recording equipment. The motor attains its rated speed in a few<br>
seconds while the recording is continuously made during the starting period.<br>
Later the data recorded on the transient recorder is transferred to a computer<br>
and the data is processed using a computer program offline to get an estimate of<br>
the electromagnetic torque produced by the motor during the no-load direct online<br>
starting. This computer program accepts the data recorded during the<br>
transient starting condition and the motor parameters measured from the no-<br>
load and block rotor test conducted on the motor as a routine test. The<br>
computation of torque is carried out from the measurement data based on the<br>
dq-model of induction motor.<br>
This invention proposes a simple method for measuring torque speed<br>
characteristics of large or medium size induction motors in a short time without<br>
incurring expensive equipment or consuming large amount of power. The test<br>
procedure is completed in a few minutes and the accuracy of measurement is<br>
within acceptable limits.</td>
