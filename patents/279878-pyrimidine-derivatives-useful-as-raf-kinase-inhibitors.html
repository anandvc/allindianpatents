				<td>COMPOUNDS USEFUL AS RAF KINASE INHIBITORS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001]       The present invention claims priority to United States provisional patent application serial number 60/947,291, filed June 29, 2007, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002]       The present invention relates to compounds useful as inhibitors of protein kinases. The invention also provides pharmaceutically acceptable compositions comprising compounds of the present invention and methods of using said compositions in the treatment of various disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Cancer results from the deregulation of the normal processes that control cell division, differentiation and apoptotic cell death. Protein kinases play a critical role in this regulatory process. A partial non-limiting list of such kinases includes abl, ATK, bcr-abl, Blk, Brk, Btk, c-kit, c-met, c-src, CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, cRafl, CSF1R, CSK, EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, ERK, Fak, fes, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, FGFR5, Fgr, FLK4, flt-1, Fps, Frk, Fyn, Hck, IGF-1R, INS-R, Jak, KDR, Lck, Lyn, MEK, p38, PDGFR, PIK, PKC, PYK2, ros, tie1, tie2, TRK, Yes and Zap70. In mammalian biology, such protein kinases comprise mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathways. MAPK signalling pathways are inappropriately activated by a variety of common disease-associated mechanisms such as mutation of ras genes and deregulation of growth factor receptors (Magnuson et al, Seminars in Cancer Biology; 1994 (5), 247-252).<br>
[0004] Additionally, protein kinases have been implicated as targets in central nervous system disorders (such as Alzheimer's), inflammatory disorders (such as psoriasis, arthritis), bone diseases (such as osteoporosis), atherosclerosis, restenosis, thrombosis, metabolic disorders (such as diabetes) and infectious diseases (such as viral and fungal infections).<br>
[0005] One of the most commonly studied pathways involving kinase regulation is intracellular signalling from cell suface receptors to the nucleus. One example of this pathway includes a cascade of kinases in which members of the Growth Factor receptor Tyrosine Kinases (such as EGF-R, PDGF-R, VEGF-R, IGF1-R, the Insulin receptor) deliver signals through phosphorylation to other kinases such as Src Tyrosine kinase, and the Raf, Mek and Erk serine/threonine kinase families. Each of these kinases is represented by several family members, which play related, but functionally distinct roles. The loss of regulation of the growth factor signalling pathway is a frequent occurrence in cancer as well as other disease states. [0006] The signals mediated by kinases have also been shown to control growth, death and differentiation in the cell by regulating the processes of the cell cycle. Progression through the eukaryotic cell cycle is controlled by a family of kinases called cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). The regulation of CDK activation is complex, but requires the association of the CDK with a member of the cyclin family of regulatory subunits. A further level of regulation occurs through both activating and inactivating phosphorylations of the CDK subunit. The coordinate activation and inactivation of different cyclin/CDK complexes is necessary for normal progression through the cell cycle. Both the critical Gl-S and G2-M transitions are controlled by the activation of different cyclin/CDK activities. In Gl, both cyclin D/CDK4 and cyclin E/CDK2 are thought to mediate the onset of S-phase. Progression through S-phase requires the activity of cyclin A/CDK2 whereas the activation of cyclin A/cdc2 (CDK1) and cyclin B/cdc2 are required for the onset of metaphase. It is not surprising, therefore, that the loss of control of CDK regulation is a frequent event in hyperproliferative diseases and cancer. [0007] Raf protein kinases are key components of signal transduction pathways by which specific extracellular stimuli elicit precise cellular responses in mammalian cells. Activated cell surface receptors activate ras/rap proteins at the inner aspect of the plasma membrane which in turn recruit and activate Raf proteins. Activated Raf proteins phosphorylate and activate the intracellular protein kinases MEK1 and MEK2. In turn, activated MEKs catalyze phosphorylation and activation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Various cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates of activated MAPK are known which directly or indirectly contribute to the cellular response to environmental change. Three distinct genes have been identified in mammals that encode Raf proteins; A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf (also known as Raf-1) and isoformic variants that result from differential splicing of mRNA are known.<br>
[0008] Inhibitors of Raf kinases have been suggested for use in disruption of tumor cell growth and hence in the treatment of cancers, e.g., histiocytic lymphoma, lung adenocarcinoma, small cell lung cancer, and pancreatic and breast carcinoma; and also in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disorders associated with neuronal degeneration resulting from ischemic events, including cerebral ischemia after cardiac arrest, stroke and multi-infarct dementia and also after cerebral ischemic events such as those resulting from head injury, surgery, and/or during childbirth.<br>
[0009] Accordingly, there is a great need to develop compounds useful as inhibitors of protein kinases. In particular, it would be desirable to develop compounds that are useful as Raf inhibitors.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0010]       It has now been found that compounds of this invention, and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof, are effective as inhibitors of one or more protein kinases. Such compounds are of formula I:<br>

In certain other embodiments, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the invention and optionally further<br>
comprising an additional therapeutic agent. In yet other embodiments, the additional therapeutic agent is an agent for the treatment of cancer.<br>

Suitable substituents include those described below for a substituted aliphatic group. [0035] As defined herein, an alkylene chain also can be optionally replaced by a functional group. An alkylene chain is "replaced" by a functional group when an internal methylene unit is<br>
replaced with the functional group. Examples of suitable "interrupting functional groups" are described in the specification and claims herein.<br>
[0036] As described herein, compounds of the invention may contain "optionally substituted" moieties. In general, the term "substituted", whether preceded by the term "optionally" or not, means that one or more hydrogens of the designated moiety are replaced with a suitable substituent. Unless otherwise indicated, an "optionally substituted" group may have a suitable substituent at each substitutable position of the group, and when more than one position in any given structure may be substituted with more than one substituent selected from a specified group, the substituent may be either the same or different at every position. Combinations of substituents envisioned under this invention are preferably those that result in the formation of stable or chemically feasible compounds. The term "stable", as used herein, refers to compounds that are not substantially altered when subjected to conditions to allow for their production, detection, and, in certain embodiments, their recovery, purification, and use for one or more of the purposes disclosed herein.<br>

[0100] At step S-l, above, a compound of formula II-i is coupled to a compound of formula II-ii. Such coupling of a carboxylic acid group with an amine can be performed using methods well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. In certain embodiments, the carboxylic acid moiety of formula II-i is activated prior to coupling. In some embodiments, the carboxylic acid moiety is converted to an acyl halide group prior to coupling. In another embodiment, the carboxylic acid moiety is treated with a suitable reagent to form the acyl chloride thereof which is then coupled to the amine moiety of compound II-ii to form a compound of formula II-iii. Such reagents for forming acyl halides are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art and include oxalyl chloride and thionyl chloride, to name a few. In certain embodiments, the acyl halide of formular II-iii can be used directly in step S-2 without isolation or purification. [00104] At step S-2, the ketone moiety of formula II-iii is converted to the oxime moiety of formula II-iv. In some embodiments, the compound of formula II-iii is treated with hydroxylamine to form a compound of formula II-iv. In certain embodiments, the compound of formula II-iv is about 1:1 E:Z configuration with respect to the -C=N- bond. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a compound of formula II-iv that is at least about<br>
50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% in the E configuration with respect to the -C=N- bond. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a compound of formula II-iv that is at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% in the Z configuration with respect to the -C=N- bond.<br>
[00105] At step S-3, the oxime moiety of formula II-iv is converted to the amine group of formula II-v. In certain embodiments, the compound of formula II-iv is treated with zinc dust and acetic acid in an alcohol to form a compound of formula II-v. In certain embodiments, the alcohol is a C4-6 alkanol. In some embodiments, the alcohol is 1-butanol or pentanol. [00106] At step S-4 (a), the racemic compound II-v is treated with a chiral agent to form a diastereomeric salt of formula Il-vi-a. In certain embodiments, the chiral acid has two carboxylate moieties as with, for example, tartaric acid or a derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the chiral acid is ditoluoyl tartaric acid. The term "chiral agent" means an enantiomerically enriched group which may be ionically or covalently bonded to the nitrogen of a compound of formula II-v to form Il-vi-a. As used herein, the term "enantiomerically enriched", as used herein means that one enantiomer makes up at least 85% of the preparation. In certain embodiments, the term enantiomerically enriched means that at least 90% of the preparation is one of the enantiomers. In other embodiments, the term means that at least 95% of the preparation is one of the enantiomers.<br>
[00107] Chiral agents that are ionically bonded to said nitrogen include, for example, chiral acids. When the chiral agent is a chiral acid, the acid forms a diastereomeric salt with the nitrogen. The resulting diastereomers are then separated by suitable physical means. Examples of chiral acids include, but are not limited to, tartaric acid and tartaric acid derivatives, mandelic acid, malic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, and Mosher's acid, among others. In certain embodiments, the chiral acid is ditoluoyl-D-tartaric acid. In other embodiments, the chiral acid is ditoluoyl-L-tartaric acid. Other chiral agents that may be covalently bonded to the nitrogen are known in the art. Exemplary chiral acids include camphorsulfonic acid (-); tartaric acid (+); malic acid (-); N-acetyl-L-leucine (-); di-toluloyl-L-tartaric acid (-); deoxycholic acid (+); quinic acid (-); camphoric acid (+); N-BOC-alanine (-); tartaric acid (-); di-toluloyl-D-tartaric acid (+); camphorsulfonic acid (+); dibenzoyl-D-tartaric acid (+); L(+)citramalic; S-acetyl mandelic acid (+); and BOC-isoleucine(+).<br>
[00108] At step S-4 (b), a diastereomeric salt of formula H-vi-b is obtained via suitable physical means, In some embodiments, "suitable physical means" refers to preferential crystallization, trituration, or slurry of a diastereomeric salt formed at step S-4 (a) above. In certain embodiments, a diastereomeric salt of formula U-vi-b is obtained via slurry. In other embodiments, the crystallization is achieved from a protic solvent. In still other embodiments, the protic solvent is an alcohol. It will be appreciated that the crystallization may be achieved using a single protic solvent or a combination of one or more protic solvents. Such solvents and solvent mixtures are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art and include, for example, one or more straight or branched alkyl alcohols. In certain embodiments, the crystallization is achieved from isopropyl alcohol and water.<br>
[00109] At step S-4(a), a chiral acid is added to a compound of formula II-v to form a compound of formula II-vi-a. In certain embodiments, an equimolar amount of chiral acid is added. In other embodiments, a substoichiometric amount of chiral acid is added. In some embodiments, about 0.5 to about 0.75 molar equivalents of chiral acid are added. As used herein, the term "substoichiometric amount" denotes that the chiral acid is used in less than 1 mole equivalent relative to the compound of formula II-v.<br>
[00110] In certain embodiments, the diastereomeric salt of formula II-vi comprises an equimolar amount of chiral acid and amine. In other embodiments, the diastereomeric salt of formula II-vi comprises a substoichiometric amount of chiral acid. In some embodiments, the diastereomeric salt of formula II-vi is a dihydrate.<br>
[00111] It should be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that enantiomeric enrichment of one enantiomer in compound II-vi-b (ie resulting from preferential crystallization, trituration, or reslurry) causes an enantiomeric enrichment in the mother liquor of the other enantiomeric form. Therefore, according to another embodiment, the invention relates to a method of enhancing the percent enantiomeric excess ("%ee") of a racemic compound of formula II-vi-a or enantiomerically enriched compound of formula II-vi-b.<br>
[00112] At step S-5, the diastereomeric salt of formula VI-vi-b is treated with a suitable base obtain a compound of formula II-vii. Free bases according to the invention are also prepared, for example, by contacting a compound of formula VI-vi-b with a suitable base in the presence of a solvent suitable for free base formation. In certain embodiments, the suitable solvent is one or more polar aprotic solvent optionally mixed with a protic solvent.   In some embodiments, the<br>
suitable solvent is an ether mixed with an alcohol. In other embodiments, the suitable solvent is tert-butylmethyl ether and methanol or tert-butylmethyl ether and acetone. Such suitable bases include strong inorganic bases, i.e., those that completely dissociate in water under formation of hydroxide anion. Exemplary suitable bases include metal hydroxides, including sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. In some embodiments, the base is a carbonate base, e.g. sodium bicarbonate.<br>
[00113] At step S-6, a compound of formula II-vii is coupled with a compound of formula II-viii to form a compound of formula II-a. Such coupling reactions are well known in the art. In certain embodiments, the coupling is achieved with a suitable coupling reagent. Such reagents are well known in the art and include, for example, DCC, HATU, and EDC, among others. In other embodiments, the carboxylic acid moiety is activated for use in the coupling reaction. Such activation includes formation of an acyl halide, use of a Mukaiyama reagent, and the like. These methods, and others, are known to one of ordinary skill in the art, e.g., see, "Advanced Organic Chemistry," Jerry March, 5th Ed., pp. 351-357, John Wiley and Sons, N.Y.

4. Uses, Formulation and Administration<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions [0101] As discussed above, the present invention provides compounds that are inhibitors of protein kinases (e.g., Raf kinase), and thus the present compounds are useful for the treatment of diseases, disorders, and conditions mediated by Raf kinase. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a method for treating a Raf-mediated disorder. As used herein, the term "Raf-mediated disorder" includes diseases, disorders, and conditions mediated by Raf kinase. Such Raf-mediated disorders include melanoma, leukemia, or cancers such as colon, breast, gastric, ovarian, lung, brain, larynx, cervical, renal, lymphatic system, genitourinary tract (including bladder and prostate), stomach, bone, lymphoma, melanoma, glioma, papillary thyroid, neuroblastoma, and pancreatic cancer.<br>
[0102] Raf-mediated disorders further include diseases afflicting mammals which are characterized by cellular proliferation. Such diseases include, for example, blood vessel proliferative disorders, fibrotic disorders, mesangial cell proliferative disorders, and metabolic diseases. Blood vessel proliferative disorders include, for example, arthritis and restenosis. Fibrotic disorders include, for example, hepatic cirrhosis and atherosclerosis. Mesangial cell proliferative disorders include, for example, glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombotic microangiopathy syndromes, organ transplant rejection, and glomerulopathies.

In certain embodiments, these compositions optionally further comprise one or more additional therapeutic agents.<br>
[0104] It will also be appreciated that certain of the compounds of present invention can exist in free form for treatment, or where appropriate, as a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof. According to the present invention, pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, salts of such esters, or any other adducts or derivatives that, upon administration to a patient in need, are capable of providing,<br>
directly or indirectly, a compound as otherwise described herein, or a metabolite or residue thereof.<br>
[0105] As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to those salts that are, within the scope of sound medical judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans or animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or the like, and are offer with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. A "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" means any at least substantially non-toxic salt or salt of an ester of a compound of this invention that, upon administration to a recipient, is capable of providing, either directly or indirectly, a compound of this invention or an inhibitorily active metabolite or residue thereof. As used herein, the term "inhibitory metabolite or residue thereof means that a metabolite or residue thereof is also an inhibitor of a Raf kinase.<br>
[0106] Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example, S. M. Berge et al. describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J. Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1977, 66, 1-19, incorporated herein by reference. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include those derived from suitable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate, borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate, gluconate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate, lactobionate, lactate, laurate, lauryl sulfate, malate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like. Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium and N+(C1-4alkyl)4 salts. This invention also envisions the quatemization of any basic nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds disclosed herein. Water or oil-soluble or dispersable products may be obtained by  such quatemization.<br>
Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when appropriate, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using counterions such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, loweralkyl sulfonate and aryl sulfonate.<br>
[0107] As described above, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of the present invention additionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle, which, as used herein, includes any and all solvents, diluents, or other liquid vehicle, dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the like, as suited to the particular dosage form desired. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sixteenth Edition, E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1980) discloses various carriers used in formulating pharmaceutically acceptable compositions and known techniques for the preparation thereof. Except insofar as any conventional carrier medium is incompatible with the compounds of the invention, such as by producing any undesirable biological effect or otherwise interacting in a deleterious manner with any other component(s) of the pharmaceutically acceptable composition, its use is contemplated to be within the scope of this invention. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, or potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, wool fat, sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil; safflower oil; sesame oil; olive oil; corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer<br>
solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.<br>
Uses of Compounds and Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions<br>
[0108]       According to the present invention, provided compounds may be assayed in any of<br>
the available assays known in the art for identifying compounds having kinase inhibitory<br>
activity.  For example, the assay may be cellular or non-cellular, in vivo or in vitro, high- or<br>
low-throughput format, etc.<br>
[0109]       In certain exemplary embodiments, compounds of this invention were assayed for<br>
their ability to inhibit protein kinases, more specifically Raf.<br>
[0110]       Thus, in one aspect, compounds of this invention which are of particular interest<br>
include those which:<br>
.    are inhibitors of protein kinases;<br>
.    exhibit the ability to inhibit Raf kinase;<br>
.    are useful for treating mammals (e.g., humans) or animals suffering from an Raf-mediated<br>
disease or condition, and for helping to prevent or delay the onset of such a disease or condition;<br>
•    exhibit a favorable therapeutic profile (e.g., safety, efficacy, and stability).<br>
[0111]       In certain embodiments, compounds of the invention are Raf kinase inhibitors.   In<br>
certain exemplary embodiments, compounds of the invention are Raf inhibitors. In certain<br>
exemplary embodiments, compounds of the invention have   CellIC50 values

[0113]       The pharmaceuticaHy acceptable compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally,<br>
intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be administered orally or parenterally at dosage levels of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg and preferably from about 1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
[0114] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. [0115] Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables. [0116] The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.<br>
[0117] In order to prolong the effect of a compound of the present invention, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection.<br>
 <br>
This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.<br>
[0118] Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.<br>
[0119] Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar—agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.<br>
[0120] Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular<br>
weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polethylene glycols and the like.<br>
[0121] The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. [0122] Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the<br>
skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.<br>
[0123] As described generally above, the compounds of the invention are useful as inhibitors of protein kinases. In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention are Raf kinase inhibitors, and thus, without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the compounds and compositions are particularly useful for treating or lessening the severity of a disease, condition, or disorder where activation of Raf kinase is implicated in the disease, condition, or disorder. When activation of Raf kinase is implicated in a particular disease, condition, or disorder, the disease, condition, or disorder may also be referred to as a "Raf-mediated disease". Accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention provides a method for treating or lessening the severity of a disease, condition, or disorder where activation of Raf kinase is implicated in the disease state.<br>
[0124] The activity of a compound utilized in this invention as an Raf kinase inhibitor, may be assayed in vitro, in vivo, ex vivo, or in a cell line. In vitro assays include assays that determine inhibition of either the phosphorylation activity or ATPase activity of activated Raf. Alternate in vitro assays quantitate the ability of the inhibitor to bind to Raf. Inhibitor binding may be measured by radiolabelling the inhibitor (e.g., synthesizing the inhibitor to include a radioisotope) prior to binding, isolating the inhibitor/Raf, complex and determining the amount of radiolabel bound. Alternatively, inhibitor binding may be determined by running a competition experiment where new inhibitors are incubated with Raf bound to known radioligands.<br>
[0125] The term "measurably inhibit", as used herein means a measurable change in Raf activity between a sample comprising said composition and a Raf kinase and an equivalent sample comprising Raf kinase in the absence of said composition.<br>
[0126] It will also be appreciated that the compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of the present invention can be employed in combination therapies, that is, the compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions can be administered concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or medical procedures. The particular combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and/or procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved.   It will also be appreciated that the therapies<br>
 <br>
employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, compound of the invention may be administered concurrently with another agent used to treat the same disorder), or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects). As used herein, additional therapeutic agents that are normally administered to treat or prevent a particular disease, or condition, are known as "appropriate for the disease, or condition, being treated". [0127] For example, other therapies, chemotherapeutic agents, or other anti-proliferative agents may be combined with the compounds of this invention to treat proliferative diseases and cancer. Examples of therapies or anticancer agents that may be used in combination with the inventive anticancer agents of the present invention include surgery, radiotherapy (e.g., gamma-radiation, neutron beam radiotherapy, electron beam radiotherapy, proton therapy, brachytherapy, and systemic radioactive isotopes), endocrine therapy, biologic response modifiers (e.g., interferons, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)), hyperthermia and cryotherapy, agents to attenuate any adverse effects (e.g., antiemetics), and other approved chemotherapeutic drugs.<br>
Examples of chemotherapeutic anticancer agents that may be used as second active agents in combination with compounds of the invention include,but are not limited to, alkylating agents (e.g. mechlorethamine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, ifosfamide), antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate), purine antagonists and pyrimidine antagonists (e.g. 6-mercaptopurine, 5-fluorouracil, cytarabine, gemcitabine), spindle poisons (e.g., vinblastine, vincristine, vinorelbine, paclitaxel), podophyllotoxins (e.g., etoposide, irinotecan, topotecan), antibiotics (e.g., doxorubicin, daunorubicin, bleomycin, mitomycin), nitrosoureas (e.g., carmustine, lomustine), inorganic ions (e.g., platinum complexes such as cisplatin, carboplatin), enzymes (e.g., asparaginase), hormones (e.g., tamoxifen, leuprolide, flutamide, and megestrol), topoisomerase II inhibitors or poisons, EGFR (Herl, ErbB-1) inhibitors (e.g., gefitinib), antibodies (e.g., rituximab), IMIDs (e.g., thalidomide, lenalidomide), various targeted agents (e.g., HDAC inhibitors such as vorinostat , Bcl-2 inhibitors, VEGF inhibitors); proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, and dexamethasone. [0128] For a more comprehensive discussion of updated cancer therapies see. The Merck Manual, Seventeenth Ed. 1999, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. See also the National Cancer Institute (CNI) website (www.nci.nih.gov) and the Food<br>
and Drug Administration (FDA) website for a list of the FDA approved oncology drugs (www.fda.gov/cder/cancer/druglistframe - See Appendix).<br>
[0129] Other examples of agents the inhibitors of this invention may also be combined with include, without limitation: treatments for Alzheimer's Disease such as Aricept® and Excelon®; treatments for Parkinson's Disease such as L-DOPA/carbidopa, entacapone, ropinrole, pramipexole, bromocriptine, pergolide, trihexephendyl, and amantadine; agents for treating Multiple Sclerosis (MS) such as beta interferon (e.g., Avonex® and Rebif®), Copaxone®, and mitoxantrone; treatments for asthma such as albuterol and Singulair®; agents for treating schizophrenia such as zyprexa, risperdal, seroquel, and haloperidol; anti-inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids, TNF blockers, IL-1 RA, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and sulfasalazine; immunomodulatory agents, including immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus, rapamycin, mycophenolate mofetil, interferons, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, and sulfasalazine; neurotrophic factors such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, MAO inhibitors, interferons, anti-convulsants, ion channel blockers, riluzole, and anti-Parkinson's agents; agents for treating cardiovascular disease such as beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and statins; agents for treating liver disease such as corticosteroids, cholestyramine, interferons, and anti-viral agents; agents for treating blood disorders such as corticosteroids, anti-leukemic agents, and growth factors; and agents for treating immunodeficiency disorders such as gamma globulin. [0130] Those additional agents may be administered separately from composition containing a compound of the invention, as part of a multiple dosage regimen. Alternatively, those agents may be part of a single dosage form, mixed together with a compound of this invention in a single composition. If administered as part of a multiple dosage regime, the two active agents may be submitted simultaneously, sequentially or within a period of time from one another normally within five hours from one another.<br>
[0131] The amount of additional therapeutic agent present in the compositions of this invention will be no more than the amount that would normally be administered in a composition comprising that therapeutic agent as the only active agent. Preferably the amount of additional therapeutic agent in the presently disclosed compositions will range from about 50% to 100% of the amount normally present in a composition comprising that agent as the only therapeutically active agent.<br>
[0132] The compounds of this invention or pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof may also be incorporated into compositions for coating implantable medical devices, such as prostheses, artificial valves, vascular grafts, stents and catheters. Accordingly, the present invention, in another aspect, includes a composition for coating an implantable device comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally above, and in classes and subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable device. In still another aspect, the present invention includes an implantable device coated with a composition comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally above, and in classes and subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable device. [0133] Vascular stents, for example, have been used to overcome restenosis (re-narrowing of the vessel wall after injury). However, patients using stents or other implantable devices risk clot formation or platelet activation. These unwanted effects may be prevented or mitigated by pre-coating the device with a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a kinase inhibitor. Suitable coatings and the general preparation of coated implantable devices are described in US Patents 6,099,562; 5,886,026; and 5,304,121. The coatings are typically biocompatible polymeric materials such as a hydrogel polymer, polymethyldisiloxane, polycaprolactone, polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, ethylene vinyl acetate, and mixtures thereof. The coatings may optionally be further covered by a suitable topcoat of fluorosilicone, polysaccarides, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids or combinations thereof to impart controlled release characteristics in the composition.<br>
[0134] Another aspect of the invention relates to inhibiting Raf activity in a biological sample or a patient, which method comprises administering to the patient, or contacting said biological sample with a compound of the present invention or a composition comprising said compound. The term "biological sample", as used herein, includes, without limitation, cell cultures or extracts thereof; biopsied material obtained from a mammal or extracts thereof; and blood, saliva, urine, feces, semen, tears, or other body fluids or extracts thereof. [0135] Inhibition of Raf kinase activity in a biological sample is useful for a variety of purposes that are known to one of skill in the art. Examples of such purposes include, but are not limited to, blood transfusion, organ-transplantation, biological specimen storage, and biological assays.<br>
TREATMENT KIT [0136] In other embodiments, the present invention relates to a kit for conveniently and effectively carrying out the methods in accordance with the present invention. In general, the pharmaceutical pack or kit comprises one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Such kits are especially suited for the delivery of solid oral forms such as tablets or capsules. Such a kit preferably includes a number of unit dosages, and may also include a card having the dosages oriented in the order of their intended use. If desired, a memory aid can be provided, for example in the form of numbers, letters, or other markings or with a calendar insert, designating the days in the treatment schedule in which the dosages can be administered. Alternatively, placebo dosages, or calcium dietary supplements, either in a form similar to or distinct from the dosages of the pharmaceutical compositions, can be included to provide a kit in which a dosage is taken every day. Optionally associated with such containers) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceutical products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.<br>
