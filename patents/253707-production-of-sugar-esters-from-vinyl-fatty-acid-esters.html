[0001] This application is a non-provisional filing based on and claiming the benefit<br>
and priority of Provisional Application No. 60/757097 filed on 06 January 2006.<br>
U.S. Government Support<br>
[0002] NA<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Area of the Art<br>
[0003] This invention relates to a process for producing sugar esters with high<br>
efficiency and high purity.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0004] Starting around the end of the Second World War "natural" surfactants such as<br>
soaps (alkali metal salts of fatty acids) were increasingly replaced with petroleum-<br>
derived "detergents." However, most of these materials were not suitable for use in<br>
food and drug products. In the search for surfactants suitable for food and drug use the<br>
sugar detergents or surfactants namely fatty acid esters of sugars and sugar<br>
derivatives were discovered. Because of the relatively large number of natural sugars<br>
and the variety of possible fatty acids, a very large number of different sugar<br>
detergents are possible.<br>
[0005] Sugar esters can be classified both by the type of sugar and also by the chain<br>
length of the fatty acid esterIfied to the sugar. Sucrose, glucose, maltose and other<br>
sugars have been reacted with a variety of fatty acids including stearic acid (18<br>
carbons), oleic acid (18 carbons), palmitic acid (16 carbons), myristic acid (14 carbons)<br>
and lauric acid (12 carbons). Sucrose esters are surfactants or emulsifiers that have<br>
several desirable properties for use In the food industry. These include the ability to<br>
produce excellent emulsification of oils and water, anti-bacterial properties, freezing<br>
damage protection of dough and baked breads, complex formation with starch, and<br>
even preservation of fresh fruit. One of the advantages of sugar esters for these tasks<br>
is that both the hydrophilic portion of the molecule (the sugar) and the lipophilic portion<br>
of the molecule (the fatty acid) can be readily varied thus providing a wide variety of<br>
different compounds each having slightly different properties.<br><br>
[0006] Probably the most common sugar detergents are those based on sucrose<br>
(table sugar) which is actually a disaccharide consisting of one molecule of the six<br>
carbon aldo-sugar glucose linked to a molecule of the five carbon keto-sugar fructose.<br>
When sucrose and fatty acid are reacted to form an ester there are eight positions<br>
(four on each of the constituent sugars) on the sucrose molecule where the fatty acid<br>
can be esterified. Typically, monoesters, diesters and triesters are formed with only a<br>
small quantity of higher esters probably because of steric hindrance. When the<br>
reaction is with a single fatty acid, such as lauric acid, analysis shows that there are<br>
many different esters that form, typically 2-4 different monoesters and up to 6-8<br>
different diesters. If fatty acid mixtures are used as starting materials, the products are<br>
even more complex. It will readily be appreciated that the chain length (as well as<br>
degree of saturation) of the fatty acid can have significant effects on the properties of<br>
the resulting sugar ester. Longer chain fatty acids produce esters that are solid or<br>
semi-solid at room temperature. Longer chain esters are also less readily soluble in<br>
water. The hydrophilic properties of the amphiphilic surfactant molecules are largely<br>
contributed by the sugar moiety while the hydrophobic properties are contributed by<br>
the fatty acid moiety with longer chain length acids being increasingly hydrophobic.<br>
[0007] The United States Food and Drug Agency (FDA) has set standards for sugar<br>
detergents in foods, drugs and cosmetics. The food additive standards are found at 21<br>
CFR 172.859, pages 95-96. The standards set requirements for the composition of the<br>
sucrose esters which must be 80% or more by weight of mono, di and tri esters<br>
produced from edible fatty acids (animal fats and vegetable oils) with less than 5% by<br>
weight free sucrose. In addition only "safe" organic solvents may be used in the<br>
synthesis of the esters and the residue levels of these solvents are controlled by the<br>
standards.<br>
[0008] Perhaps as a result of these standards, there are only a few commercial<br>
sources of these materials that meet the Food and Drug Administration requirements.<br>
The sugar esters have been produced in Japan for over 50 years so that several<br>
Japanese companies, one being Ryoto Sugar Esters made by the Mitsubishl-Kasal<br>
Food Company, make products meeting the FDA criteria.<br>
[0009] The classic method for the production of the sucrose esters is best illustrated<br>
by the production of sucrose stearate. In the early processes dimethyl formamide<br>
(DMF) was used as the solvent. The methyl ester of the fatty acid was made and this<br>
methyl ester was reacted with sucrose in the DMF in the presence of a catalyst such<br>
as potassium carbonate for 4-6 hours at 83-95.°C. Typical recipes (all are parts by<br><br>
weight) used 30 to 127 parts sucrose to 30 parts methyl stearate, 2 parts potassium<br>
carbonate and 300 parts solvent. These methods achieved high yields of 60-75% by<br>
weight. The basic problem has been in purifying the reaction mixture to yield a material<br>
that meets FDA standards especially since DMF is toxic. In addition, the reaction<br>
products are highly viscous containing partially decomposed sugars and solvents.<br>
[0010] These problems led to a series of attempted improvements. Due to concerns<br>
about the use of DMF, Foster D. Snell developed a new method using dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide (DMSO) instead of DMF as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,480,616. Another<br>
example is found in U.S. Pat. No. 3,644,333 to Osipow et al which tried to eliminate the<br>
use of an organic solvent by using an emulsion. In this process, sucrose was mixed<br>
with methyl stearate and sodium stearate and a significant amount of previously<br>
prepared sucrose ester. Potassium carbonate was used as the catalyst, and water<br>
was used as the solvent. However, the yields are low, on the order of 30-35% by<br>
weight. Further, there are considerable waste and degraded products so that the<br>
desired product was much more difficult to remove from the reaction mixture.<br>
[0011] Alternative methods have been described by Feuge. For example, in U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 3,714,144, he uses the sodium, potassium or lithium soap of the fatty acid in a<br>
molten sugar solution. The reaction proceeds for 2-20 minutes under vacuum at 170-<br>
190°C. Again, the product is made in very low yield and the destroyed sugar and alkali<br>
metals are very difficult to remove. To help with the production of the esters, several<br>
schemes have been devised to purify the reaction mixtures. For example, Kea et al in<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,710,567 teach the use of the addition of an aqueous salt solution to<br>
help purify the ester followed by a three phase separation.<br>
[0012] A number of patents assigned to Dai-lchi Kogyo Seiyaku Co. Ltd. (Kyoto,<br>
Japan) covering sucrose ester synthesis were granted between 1990 and 1991. In<br>
particular, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,898,935, 4,996,309, 4,995,911, 5,011,922, and 5,017,697<br>
all disclose methods for reacting, extracting and purifying sucrose fatty acid esters as<br>
produced using chemical catalysis.<br>
[0013] Summary of the Invention<br>
[0014] The present invention is a process for synthesizing sugar esters of fatty acids<br>
using vinyl esters of fatty acids. By sugar we mean any of the naturally occurring<br>
sugars found primarily in plant sources. These include, for example, sucrose, ribose,<br>
mannose, glucose, fructose, xylose, arabinose, lactose, melibiose, galactose,<br>
mannose, raffinose and cellobiose. Appropriate fatty acids are those found in edible<br><br>
fats, waxes and oils—again primarily of vegetable origin. The useful fatty acids include,<br>
for example, hexanoic, octanoic, decanoic, lauric, myristic, myristoletic, palmitic,<br>
stearic, oleic, ricinoleic, linoleic, linolenic, arachidic, eicosenoic, behenic, and erucic<br>
acids. The inventive process combines a solution of an appropriate sugar in an<br>
appropriate organic solvent with a metal carbonate catalyst and a vinyl ester of a fatty<br>
acid as an acyl source for esterification. Suitable organic solvents are those solvents<br>
that show at least slight solubility of the sugar in question. In addition, because these<br>
sugar esters may be destined for food use, only FDA approved solvents can be used.<br>
Such solvents include dimethyl sulfoxide, methyl ethyl ketone, ethyl acetate, and<br>
isobutanol (2-methyl-1-propanol). The vinyl ester sugar mixture is reacted at a<br>
temperature between about 30°C and about 90°C for a time between about five<br>
minutes and twenty four hours. During the reaction the fatty acid groups esterify the<br>
sugar and acetaldehyde is released as a byproduct. Because acetaldehyde is<br>
reasonably volatile, the reaction can advantageously be conducted under reduced<br>
atmospheric pressure so that the acetaldehyde is removed from the reaction mixture,<br>
thereby "pulling" the reaction forward. At the end of the reaction time the product is<br>
primarily sugar monoester with a relatively low level of unconsumed vinyl ester if the<br>
starting ratio of sugar to vinyl ester is between about 2:1 and about 8:1.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention.<br>
[0015] The following description is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to<br>
make and use the invention and sets forth the best modes contemplated by the<br>
inventor of carrying out his invention. Various modifications, however, will remain<br>
readily apparent to those skilled in the art, since the general principles of the present<br>
invention have been defined herein specifically to provide a method of producing<br>
sucrose esters wherein the fatty acids are provided in the form of vinyl esters.<br>
[0016] Production of sucrose monostearate using vinyl esters of fatty acids<br>
[0017] Because sucrose monoesters are considered to be more valuable than the<br>
other esters, the inventive reaction shown here has been optimized to produce the<br>
highest monoester content instead of the highest reaction yield.<br>
[0018] Sucrose is first dissolved in DMSO at 60°C to a concentration of about 400<br>
mM. To limit coloration of the reaction mixture, potassium carbonate is added to this<br>
sucrose solution at an amount of 1.5g/L and stirred for about 30 min to activate the<br>
sucrose molecules. After about 30 min, the undissolved potassium carbonate is<br>
removed by either decanting or filtration and vinyl stearate is added such that its final<br><br>
concentration is about 100 mM. With the addition of the vinyl fatty acid ester the<br>
reaction begins and is allowed to proceed for about 15 min. The reaction can be<br>
monitored by measuring the amount of remaining vinyl fatty acid ester. When this level<br>
falls to no more than about 10% by weight of the starting amount, the reaction can be<br>
considered to be complete. Using the above reaction conditions the monoester<br>
content, measured as a percentage of total ester content, post reaction is about 90%,<br>
and the calculated reaction yield based on vinyl stearate is about 90%. The acid value<br>
post reaction is less than 1.<br>
[0019] Purification of sucrose monostearate<br>
[0020] The DMSO can be recovered from the reaction mixture by vacuum distillation.<br>
Brine (sodium chloride) is added to the post distillation mixture to effect emulsification<br>
of the sucrose stearate and vinyl stearate. The unreacted sucrose and potassium<br>
carbonate dissolve in the brine solution. To recover the sucrose stearate, especially<br>
sucrose monostearate, the emulsion is then broken by adding an organic solvent, for<br>
example, isobutanol. The organic solvent separates from the aqueous brine to form<br>
two separate liquid phases. One phase comprises organic solvent (isobutanol),<br>
sucrose ester (stearate) and unreacted vinyl ester. The other phase comprises of<br>
water, unreacted sucrose and potassium carbonate. After separation is complete, the<br>
isobutanol phase is decanted from the aqueous layer and subjected to vacuum<br>
distillation to recover the isobutanol. After the isobutanol is removed, the crude product<br>
comprises of sucrose stearate, vinyl stearate and traces of sucrose. Spray drying of<br>
the isobutanol product concentrate into supercritical carbon dioxide gave sucrose<br>
stearate powder with around 500ppm DMSO. This powder can be dissolved in ethanol<br>
again and subjected to two further sprays to reduce the DMSO content in the product<br>
to less than 0.5ppm. In this way, the FDA purity criteria are met by the final sucrose<br>
stearate product.<br>
[0021] Reaction variables<br>
[0022] Sucrose to vinyl ester ratio: Theoretically, higher sucrose to vinyl ester ratio<br>
should yield higher monoester content. However, an exceedingly high ratio would<br>
create downstream purification problems. Therefore, the optimal sucrose to vinyl ester<br>
molar ratio is between about 2:1 to about 8:1.<br>
[0023] Catalyst: This reaction is catalyzed by bases. Suitable bases include metal<br>
oxides, metal hydroxides and metal carbonates, in particularly alkali metal hydroxides<br>
and carbonates. The higher the alkalinity of the metal hydroxides and carbonates, the<br><br>
faster the reaction. Possible catalyst candidates include potassium hydroxide, sodium<br>
hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate and lithium carbonate. Other<br>
anions of weak acids that provide sufficient alkalinity are also useable.<br>
[0024] Catalyst concentration: It was found that excessive concentration of catalyst<br>
leads to discoloration of the reaction mixture—probably due to side reactions.<br>
Therefore, the optimum catalyst concentration lies between about 1.5 and about 6g/L<br>
of total reaction volume with a potassium carbonate catalyst. When other alkali metals<br>
and/or alternate metal salts are used, the catalyst concentration should be adjusted to<br>
provide similar provide similar alkalinity.<br>
[0025] Reaction temperature: The byproduct of using a vinyl ester as the acyl donor<br>
is acetaldehyde. Because acetaldehyde has a low boiling point, high reaction<br>
temperature is not necessary to drive the reaction as is the case with conventional<br>
methyl or ethyl esters. The minimum temperature for reasonable reaction rate is about<br>
30°C. Although the reaction rate increases with increasing reaction temperature, high<br>
reaction temperatures are not favored because they result in discoloration of the<br>
reaction mixture, even at low catalyst concentration. A trade off between rate and<br>
discoloration (side reactions) is reached at the moderate reaction temperatures of<br>
between about 40°C and 60°C.<br>
[0026] The following claims are thus to be understood to include what is specifically<br>
illustrated and described above, what is conceptually equivalent, what can be<br>
obviously substituted and also what essentially incorporates the essential idea of the<br>
invention. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that various adaptations and modifica-<br>
tions of the just-described preferred embodiment can be configured without departing<br>
from the scope of the invention. The illustrated embodiment has been set forth only for<br>
the purposes of example and that should not be taken as limiting the invention.<br>
Therefore, it is to be understood that, within the scope of the appended claims, the<br>
invention may be practiced other than as specifically described herein.<br><br>
