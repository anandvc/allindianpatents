				<td>Polyol refining<br>
The subject of the present invention is a method of polyol refining, preferably for glycerol, by means of monodispersed ion exchanger in a purification unit consisting of an ion exclusion process and a mixed bed and an apparatus for the manufacture of biodiesel containing such a purification unit.<br>
Due to the increased synthesis of biodiesel from renewable raw materials in recent time, considerable quantities of glycerol are accruing, which is loaded with a considerable percentage of ions, especially sodium and chloride, and may have a deep brown discoloration. And both of these factors are undesirable for the further processing of glycerol, for example, into cosmetics, in the food industry, or into pharmaceutical products.<br>
Purifying glycerol by means of ion exchangers is known in the prior art. US 7, 126,032 Bl describes the purification of glycerol from biodiesel fabrication, including with ion exchangers. Likewise, numerous product brochures of renowned makers of ion exchangers recommend the use of ion exchangers for the desalting of glycerol, such as the Dow Chemical Company Dowex HCR-W2, a strong-acid, gel-like cation exchanger (16-40 mesh), or Lanxess Deutschland GmbH under the brand name Lewatit the ion exchangers S1428, S1468, S2528, S2568, S3428, S4228, S4268, S4328, S6328, S6368 or MDS1368Natrium.<br>
Not always does the use of the mentioned ion exchangers achieve the purities of the polyol, especially glycerol, required for particular branches of industry. Therefore, there is a desire to obtain polyols from fatty acid alkyl ester processes, preferably glycerin, in such a purity that it/they fulfil the high demands of the cosmetics industry, the food industry, or the pharmaceutical industry for their raw material.<br>
The solution of the problem and thus the object of the present invention is a method for refining of polyols, characterized in that one uses a purification unit made up of an ion exclusion process and a mixed bed. In a preferred embodiment, at least one monodispersed ion exchanger is used in this purification unit.<br>
The ion exclusion process, hereinafter IEC (ion exclusion chromatography), is a known prior art. It is used, for example, for the fractionation of silage juice into an amino acid and a lactic acid fraction.<br>
The term used in the older German literature for ion exclusion chromatography is electrolyte first run process. This describes the primary separation mechanism quite well. Electrolytes (inorganic ions, organic ions) are excluded from the ion exchange matrix and the entire electrolyte fraction<br><br>
passes through the chromatography column as if it were filled with glass beads. For example, IEC is also used to separate sugars (WO 2003056038 Al) or to get ethanol (WO 1995017517 Al).<br>
Many ion exchangers are available for use in IEC, including monodispersed ion exchangers. Thus we find under http://www.dow.com/liquidseps/prod/chromato.htm the monodispersed Dowex Monosphere 99K 320 for use in amino acid production or the production of organic acids, as well as for production of sugar from sugar beets or sugar cane. In the present invention, IEC is used as a method for desalting of polyol, preferably glycerol.<br>
A mixed bed, or mixed bed resins, are a mixture of at least one strongly acidic cation exchanger and a strongly basic anion exchanger, optimally attuned to each other. These resins also easily remove "difficult" contents of water, such as silicic acid and carbonic acid. They are preferably used for total desalination of water. For example, mixed beds are described in US 20050103622 Al and especially in US - A 5,858,191, and the latter in particular is subsumed in its entirety by the present patent in this respect.<br>
Unlike heterodispersed ion exchangers with heterodispersed particle size distribution, which one obtains by traditional methods, the present application uses the term monodispersed to mean ion exchangers in which at least 90 vol. or wt. % of the particles have a diameter which lies in the interval around the most frequent diameter with width of+10% of the most frequent diameter.<br>
For example, for an ion exchanger with most frequent bead diameter of 0.5 mm, at least 90 vol. or wt. % lie in a size interval between 0.45 mm and 0.55 mm; for a substance with most frequent diameter of 0.7 mm, at least 90 vol. or wt. % lie in a size interval between 0.77 mm and 0.63 mm.<br>
A monodispersed bead polymerizate required for the production of monodispersed ion exchangers can be produced according to the methods known from the literature. For example, such methods and the monodispersed ion exchangers made from them are described in US-A 4 444 961, EP-A 0 046 535, US 4 419 245 or WO 93/12167, whose contents are fully subsumed by the present application. According to the invention, monodispersed bead polymerizates and the monodispersed ion exchangers prepared from them are obtained by jetting or seed/feed processes. Preferably, according to the invention, at least one monodispersed ion exchanger from a jetting or a seed/feed process is contained in the IEC or in the mixed bed. In an especially preferred embodiment, one monodispersed ion exchanger is contained in each of the IEC and the mixed bed. Very preferred according to the invention, only monodispersed ion exchangers are contained in the IEC as well as the mixed bed.<br>
Preferably according to the invention, strong-acid cation exchangers are used in the IEC, especially preferably strong-acid, gel-like cation exchangers. Especially preferably according to the invention, monodispersed, strong-acid, gel-like cation exchangers are used, such as Lewatit GF 303.<br><br><br>
The polyol which is largely salt-free obtained after the treatment in the IEC, especially glycerol, is subjected to a fine cleaning in a mixed bed in the second stage according to the invention, aiming for a salt content of less than 1 ppm. In addition, one achieves a so-called polishing of the polyol in the mixed bed, whereby a very low color value of almost entirely clear is achieved. For this, preferably an anion exchanger and a cation exchanger are used alongside each other. Especially preferably, one of the resins used in the mixed bed is monodispersed, especially preferably, both ion exchangers in the mixed bed are monodispersed.<br>
The terms microporous, macroporous or gel-like have already been described fully in the technical literature. Preferred anion exchangers or cation exchangers in the mixed bed have a macroporous structure.<br>
The formation of macroporous bead polymerizates for the production of macroporous ion exchangers can take place, for example, by adding inert materials (pore-forming agents) to the monomer mixture during the polymerization. Suitable as such are first and foremost organic substances that dissolve in the monomer, but dissolve or swell the polymerizate slightly (precipitating agents for polymers), such as aliphatic hydrocarbons (Farbenfabriken Bayer DBP 1045102, 1957; DBP 1113570, 1957).<br>
The pore-forming agents used in US-A 4,382,124 are alcohols with 4 to 10 carbon atoms for preparation of monodispersed, macroporous bead polymerizates on a styrene/divinyl benzene basis. Moreover, a survey is given as to the methods of production of macroporous bead polymerizates. Preferable as pore-forming agents according to the invention are organic solvents which poorly dissolve or swell the resulting polymerizate. Preferred pore-forming agents are hexane, octane, isooctane, isododecane, methylethylketone, butanol or octanol or their isomers.<br>
Therefore, the combination of a monodispersed macroporous cation exchanger with a monodispersed, macroporous anion exchanger is preferred in the mixed bed according to the invention, and a monodispersed, macroporous, strong-acid cation exchanger with a monodispersed, macroporous, medium-basic anion exchanger is especially preferred. As an example of a mixed bed, one can mention here Lewatit GF 404 in combination with Lewatit GF 505.<br>
Surprisingly, by the method of the invention, namely, by means of a purification unit of IEC and a mixed bed, one achieves polyols in such high purity and such outstanding color values that they can be used with no further processing in the cosmetic industry, the food industry, or the pharmaceutical industry. In the case of glycerol, salt contents of less than 1 ppm and color values of less than 1 IU (International Unit; Sugar Analysis, Icumsa Methods, F. Schneider, 1979, Paragraph 7, Physical Characteristics of Colour of Sugar and Solutions) are achieved.<br><br>
But the present invention also concerns the use of at least one, preferably two, most preferably at least three monodispersed ion exchangers inside a purification unit consisting of IEC and mixed bed for the refining of polyols, especially glycerol.<br>
Moreover, the present invention concerns the use of a purification unit consisting of IEC and mixed bed in the production of biodiesel for the processing of the polyol accruing during the production, preferably glycerol. An object of the present invention is therefore even an apparatus for the manufacture of biodiesel containing a purification unit of at least one IEC and at least one mixed bed for polyol refining, preferably for glycerol refining. The invention moreover concerns a method for production of biodesel, characterized in that the polyol feedstock is subjected to a purification unit consisting of IEC and a mixed bed. In a preferred embodiment, the method is characterized by<br>
a)	the transesterification of free fatty acids into fatty acid esters by means of macroporous cation exchanger,<br>
b)	the separation of the biodiesel from the polyol and<br>
cl) the processing of the polyol by means of a purification unit made up of IEC and mixed bed, and<br>
c2) the processing of the biodiesel to remove the polyol and/or soaps by a strong-acid, monodispersed, macroporous cation exchanger.<br>
In an especially preferred embodiment, a heretodispersed, macroporous, highly sulfonated cation exchanger is used in step a) and a strong-acid, monodispersed, gel-like cation exchanger in step c2).<br>
The apparatus for the manufacture of biodiesel containing a purification unit containing of at least one IEC and at least one mixed bed may additionally be equipped with additional monodisperse ion exchangers for the purification of the biodiesel itself. In a preferred embodiment an apparatus for the manufacture of biodiesel is characterized by its individual devices wherein the individual process steps are performed such as:<br>
a)	the transesterification of free fatty acids into fatty acid esters by means of macroporous cation exchanger,<br>
b)	the separation of the biodiesel from the polyol and<br>
cl) the processing of the polyol by means of a purification unit made up of IEC and mixed bed,and<br><br>
c2)       the processing of the biodiesel to remove the polyol and/or soaps by a strong-acid, monodispersed, macroporous cation exchanger.<br>
For example the following ion exchangers can be used:<br>
for step a) for example Lewatit® GF 101 or AMBERLYST®BD 20<br>
for step cl) for example Lewatit® GF 303 or AMBERSEP® BD 50<br>
for  step  c2)     Lewatit® K2567  or Lewatit®  GF  202  from  Lanxess  Deutschalnd  GmbH  or alternatively AMBERLITE® BD 10 DRY®<br>
Examples:<br>
Figure 1 shows schematically a production plant for biodiesel with subsequent cleaning of the biodiesel as well as the accruing polyol, in this case, glycerol. Figure 2 likewise shows schematically a production plant for biodiesel with the difference that, contrary to a connection of a mixed bed, as in Fig. 1, a single apparatus contains the mixed bed here.<br>
Position 1 in Fig. 1 stands for an apparatus that is filled with an esterification catalyst in order to separate fatty acids from the triglycerides. Of course, natural oils, such as rapeseed oil, consist of a mixture of triglycerides (&gt;95%), fatty acids (0.1 to 5%), and micelles, phospholipids, proteins and mineral salts (
Preferably, an esterification catalyst of type Lewatit GF 101 or Lewatit K 2620 or Lewatit K 2621 is used in 1, or in the case of an enzymatic esterification Lewatit GF 808 or Lewatit OC 1600.<br>
The transesterification process takes place in 2, being followed by the separation of the two phases, the biodiesel phase 3 from the glycerol phase 4.<br>
The biodiesel phase goes through an apparatus 5 filled, for example, with a monodispersed strong-acid macroporous cation exchanger of type Lewatit K 2567 or Lewatit GF 202 or Lewatit SP112 for the removal of residual glycerol, soaps, waxes, salts, water or methanol.<br>
The glycerol phase goes through a purification unit according to the invention, made up of apparatuses 6 as well as 7 and 8, or alternatively 9 (Fig. 2), in which 6 stands for the IEC and 7 and 8 for a connection of apparatuses of a mixed bed and 9 (Fig. 2) stands for an individual apparatus as mixed bed. In 6, according to the invention, a mondispersed gel-like strong-acid cation exchanger is used to separate salts or ash from the glycerol, such as Lewatit GF 303.<br>
In 7, for example, a monodispersed, macroporous, strong-acid cation exchanger is used as polisher, and also to remove cations, such as Lewatit GF 404. In 8, preferably, a monodispersed, macroporous, medium-basic anion exchanger is used as polisher and also to separate anions, but also to decolorize the glycerol, such as Lewatit GF 505.<br>
In 9 (Fig. 2), for example, a monodispersed, macroporous, strong-acid cation exchanger is used as polisher, and also to separate cations, such as Lewatit GF 404, and a monodispersed, macroporous, medium-basic anion exchanger, such as Lewatit GF 505 or a monodispersed, strong-basic anion exchanger of type I or type II, for example, Lewatit S 6368 A or Lewatit S 7468 is used to separate anions, but also to decolorize the glycerol in a mixture in a volumetric ratio of cation exchanger 1 : anion exchanger 0.8 to 2. The difference between anion exchangers of type I and type II is<br>
described, for example, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Technical Chemistry, Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, New York, 4th ed., Vol. 13, p. 302.<br>
The cation exchanger in apparatus 7, after the existing exchanger capacity is used up, is regenerated by means of diluted mineral acids, preferably 4-10 wt. % hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or nitric acid. The regenerating solution can be filtered either from the top or from the bottom through the ion exchanger. After this, the regenerating solution is expelled with deionized water while maintaining the direction of filtration. After this comes a washing with deionized water in the outflow until the pH value at the exit from the apparatus is 5-6.<br>
The anion exchanger in apparatus 8, after the existing exchanger capacity is used up, is regenerated by means of diluted lye, preferably 3-8 wt. % sodium hydroxide. The regenerating solution can be filtered either from the top or from the bottom through the ion exchanger. After this, the regenerating solution is expelled with deionized water while maintaining the direction of filtration. After this comes a washing with deionized water in the outflow until the pH value at the exit from the apparatus is 7-8.<br>
The components of the resin mixture (cation exchanger and anion exchanger) in apparatus 9, after the exchanger capacity is used up, are first separated by back-flushing with deionized water and then the individual resins are individually regenerated. The anion exchanger is regenerated with NaOH (3-6 wt. %) from the top and the cation exchanger with an aqueous solution of HC1, preferably up to 5-8 wt. %, from the bottom simultaneously. The regeneration solutions are taken off by a drainage situated at the height of the resin separation zone. After this, the regeneration solutions are expelled and rinsing is done with deionized water in the direction of the respective chemical solutions.<br>

Deionized water in the sense of the present invention is characterized in that it has a conductivity of 0.1 to 10 uS, and the content of dissolved or undissolved metal ions is not greater than 1 ppm, preferably not greater than 0.5 ppm for Fe, Co, Ni, Mo, Cr, Cu as individual components and not greater than 10 ppm, preferably not greater than 1 ppm, for the total of said metals.<br>

The information about the glycerol was measured with a UWVIS spectral photometer of type CADAS 30 S from the Dr. Lange firm, Berlin. The information on the color values of the glycerol in the context of the present invention is therefore referred to measurements with such an instrument, while:<br>
IU = 1000 X Ext(420mm) X 1 00 / b X C X D<br>
Where Ext = -log transmission, b ~ dry substance in °bx, c = cell length in cm and D = density.<br>
