				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an ink fountain apparatus for<br>
a rotary printing press, which stores ink to be supplied to a plate<br>
surface and, more particularly, to an ink fountain apparatus for a<br>
rotary printing press, which has intermediate ink dams arranged<br>
between a pair of opposing ink dams.<br>
When printing is to be performed with a rotary printing press,<br>
the plate sometimes has a pattern at only its portion in the entire<br>
width depending on the specifications of the printing products. In<br>
this case, if ink is stored in the entire ink fountain and printing<br>
is performed, the ink may be wasted. For this reason, intermediate<br>
ink dams are formed on two sides of a portion corresponding to the<br>
pattern, and the ink is stored in only inside the intermediate ink<br>
dams. In rainbow printing wherein inks of different colors are<br>
supplied to appropriate portions in the entire length of the plate<br>
cylinder and several colors are printed at once, intermediate ink<br>
dams are provided so that adjacent inks do not mix with each other.<br>
As disclosed in US Patent Application No. 2003 / 0164104,<br>
a conventional intermediate ink dam<br><br>
includes a press plate made of an elastic material which<br>
has a fountain press portion for pressing the outer<br>
surface of a fountain roller, and a blade press portion<br>
for pressing a fountain blade. A press means presses<br>
this press plate toward the fountain roller and the<br>
fountain blade, simultaneously.<br>
In the above conventional ink fountain<br>
apparatus for the rotary printing press, when the<br>
plurality of intermediate ink dams are arranged, the<br>
press forces of the press means must be large in order<br>
to suppress variations between the press forces of the<br>
press plates of the respective intermediate ink dams.<br>
For this reason, since the fountain roller is flexed by<br>
an overload applied from the press plates to the outer<br>
surface of the fountain roller, an ink film with an<br>
appropriate film thickness cannot be formed on the outer<br>
surface of the fountain roller, thus posing a problem.<br>
Also, the overload is applied to the fountain roller<br>
because a contact resistance between the press plates<br>
and the fountain roller is made large by the overload,<br>
and a rotational driving system of the fountain roller<br>
is braked, thus posing a problem.<br>
Also, in the conventional ink fountain<br>
apparatus for the rotary printing press, if the width of<br>
the fountain press portion of the press plate is made<br>
small, inks mix with each other when attaching the<br>
intermediate ink dam for the fountain roller not<br><br>
perpendicularly but slantly. Therefore, the width of the fountain<br>
press portion must be large to some degree. Alternatively, if the<br>
width of the fountain press portion is made large, a press surface<br>
with the large width stops supplying the ink downstream of the<br>
fountain roller. For this reason, the press force of the press<br>
means must be made large, thus posing the same problem as described<br>
above.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an ink<br>
fountain apparatus for a rotary printing press which can form an<br>
ink film with an appropriate film thickness on the outer surface of<br>
a fountain roller.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an<br>
ink fountain apparatus for a rotary printing press which prevents<br>
an overload applied to a rotational driving system for driving the<br>
fountain roller.<br>
In order to achieve the above objects of the present<br>
invention, there is provided an ink fountain apparatus for a rotary<br>
printing press, which has an ink fountain having a rotatably<br>
supported ink fountain roller, a bottom plate which has a distal<br>
end close to an outer surface of said ink fountain roller and<br>
extends in an axial direction of said fountain roller, and a pair<br>
of ink dams substantially standing upright from said bottom plate<br>
and arranged to oppose in the axial direction of said ink fountain<br>
roller through a predetermined distance, an intermediate ink dam<br><br>
substantially standing upright from said bottom plate between said<br>
pair of ink dams, said intermediate ink dam having a first surface<br>
in contact opposite to the outer surface of said fountain roller, a<br>
second surface in contact opposite to an upper surface of said<br>
bottom plate, and a boundary portion allowing said first surface<br>
and said second surface to communicate with each other, and press<br>
means for simultaneously pressing said intermediate ink dam toward<br>
the outer surface of said fountain roller, and the upper surface of<br>
said bottom plate, wherein a width of said first surface close to<br>
said boundary portion in the axial direction of said fountain<br>
roller is set to be smaller than a width of said first surface on<br>
an upstream side of said fountain roller in a rotational direction<br>
from said boundary portion in the axial direction of said fountain<br>
roller.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
The present invention will be described in<br>
detail with reference to Figs. 1 to 6.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an ink fountain apparatus for a<br>
rotary printing press according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Referring to Fig. 2, an ink fountain<br>
roller 1 rotatable in the direction of an arrow A<br>
axially extends between a pair of frames (not shown)<br>
arranged to oppose each other through a predetermined<br>
distance, and a blade base 2 is provided beside the ink<br>
fountain roller 1 such that its two ends are supported<br>
by the pair of frames. A large number of ink fountain<br>
keys 3 divided in the axial direction of the ink<br>
fountain roller 1 are placed on a slant surface at the<br>
upper end of the blade base 2. When a motor (not shown)<br>
is driven, the aperture ratios of the distal ends of the<br>
ink fountain keys 3 are adjusted in directions to become<br><br>
close to and away from the outer surface of the ink<br>
fountain roller 1.<br>
One ink fountain blade 4 formed of a thin<br>
steel plate to serve as a bottom plate is magnetically<br>
attracted so it comes into tight contact with the ink<br>
fountain key 3 to cover the large number of ink fountain<br>
keys 3. In this case, the distal end of the fountain<br>
key 3 opposing the outer surface of the ink fountain<br>
roller 1 is exposed from the fountain blade 4.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a pair of opposing ink dams 5<br>
arranged to correspond to the two ends of the ink<br>
fountain roller 1 are fixed to a member (not shown)<br>
swingably supported between the frames, such that the<br>
inner surfaces of their distal ends are pressed by the<br>
two end faces of the ink fountain roller 1. The pair of<br>
ink dams 5 standing upright from the ink fountain blade<br>
4, the outer surface of the ink fountain roller 1, and<br>
the ink fountain blade 4 make up a tub-like ink fountain<br>
6. A bar 8 extending in the axial direction of the ink<br>
fountain roller 1 behind the ink fountain 6 has two ends<br>
fixed to the member (not shown) swingably supported<br>
between the frames.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, a thin-plate-like<br>
rectangular parallelepiped holder 10 has a fitting<br>
groove 11 with a U-shaped section to communicate with<br>
its upper end and its side surface on the ink fountain<br>
roller 1 side, and a notch 12, extending in the axial<br><br>
direction of the ink fountain roller 1, in its lower end.<br>
The notch 12 is slightly larger than the sectional area<br>
of the bar 8. As shown in Fig. 2, a blind hole-like<br>
spring accommodating hole 13 is formed in the upper<br>
portion of the holder 10. A threaded portion 13a is<br>
formed at the inlet port of the spring accommodating<br>
hole 13, and a small-diameter insertion hole 13b is<br>
formed in the spring accommodating hole 13 to reach its<br>
bottom. A screw hole 14 with a screw portion extending<br>
to reach a recess 8a of the bar 8 is formed in the lower<br>
portion of the holder 10.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, an operation rod 15<br>
serving as a thin, elongated press member has a spring<br>
accepting portion 15a, with a diameter slightly smaller<br>
than the diameter of the spring accommodating hole 13,<br>
at its distal end. A press shaft portion 15b with a<br>
diameter slightly smaller than the diameter of the<br>
insertion hole 13b projects from one end of the spring<br>
accepting portion 15a toward the ink fountain roller 1.<br>
A handle member 16 is fixed to the proximal end (counter<br>
distal end) of the operation rod 15. A screw 17 has a<br>
screw portion 17a threadably engageable with the<br>
threaded portion 13a of the spring accommodating hole 13,<br>
and an insertion hole 17b with a diameter slightly<br>
larger than the diameter of the operation rod 15 is<br>
formed at the center of the screw 17.<br>
A compression coil spring 18 serving as a<br><br>
biasing means is elastically mounted between the spring<br>
accepting portion 15a of the operation rod 15 inserted<br>
in the spring accommodating hole 13 and the screw 17<br>
with the screw portion 17a threadably engaging with the<br>
threaded portion 13a. The press shaft portion 15b of<br>
the operation rod 15 in the insertion hole 13b is then<br>
biased from the holder 10 in a direction to become close<br>
to the ink fountain roller 1. A set screw 19 threadably<br>
engages with the screw hole 14 of the holder 10 and<br>
serves to fix the holder 10 to the bar 8. A nut 20<br>
threadably engages with the set screw 19 and serves to<br>
regulate forward/backward movement of the set screw 19.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a pair of opposing<br>
intermediate ink dams 25 are arranged between the ink<br>
dams 5. As shown in Fig. 3, each intermediate ink dam<br>
25 is comprised of an operation plate (third member) 26,<br>
a pair of sandwiching plates 27 and 28 for sandwiching<br>
the operation plate 26 from two sides, an adjustment<br>
plate (second member) 29 in contact opposite to the<br>
lower surface of the operation plate 26, and a press<br>
plate (first member) 30 having an upper end face in<br>
contact opposite to the lower surface of the adjustment<br>
plate 29. The press plate 30 is arranged in the same<br>
planar direction as those of the operation plate 26 and<br>
sandwiching plates 27 and 28.<br>
The operation plate 26 is formed of a<br>
horizontal portion 26a extending in a direction<br><br>
perpendicular to the axial direction of the ink fountain<br>
roller 1 and an upright portion 26b extending obliquely<br>
upward from the distal end of the horizontal portion 26a,<br>
to have a substantial L shape. A substantially L-shaped<br>
support 31 is integrally formed at the front end of the<br>
horizontal portion 26a to be thicker than the horizontal<br>
portion 26a because of steps 31a. The horizontal<br>
portion of the support 31 is fitted in the fitting<br>
groove 11 of the holder 10, and part of the vertical<br>
portion of the support 31 forms an engaging surface 31b<br>
formed of a slant surface. As shown in Fig. 2, the<br>
slanting direction of the engaging surface 31b is set<br>
such that an angle α formed by the upper surface of the<br>
ink fountain blade 4 and the extension of the slant<br>
surface of the engaging surface 31b is an acute angle.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the operation plate 26 has,<br>
in its the horizontal portion 26a and upright portion<br>
26b, a total of five insertion holes 32 and a total of<br>
five screw holes 33. Three adjustment bolts 34a, 34b,<br>
and 34c threadably engage with screw holes formed at the<br>
upper and lower portions of the upright portion 26b and<br>
the substantial center of the horizontal portion 26a of<br>
the operation plate 26. The adjustment bolt 34b<br>
attached to the lower portion of the upright portion 26b<br>
moves forward/backward (in the direction indicated by an<br>
arrow D) toward a point B where the outer surface of the<br>
ink fountain roller 1 and the ink fountain key 3 oppose<br><br>
each other. The sandwiching plate 27 has five screw<br>
holes 36 corresponding to the insertion holes 32 of the<br>
operation plate 26. The sandwiching plate 28 has five<br>
insertion holes 37 with spot-faced upper surfaces to<br>
correspond to the insertion holes 32 of the operation<br>
plate 26, and five insertion holes 38 corresponding to<br>
the screw holes 33.<br>
The adjustment plate 29 is formed by bending a<br>
thin steel plate with spring properties into a<br>
substantial L shape. The adjustment plate 29 is<br>
comprised of a horizontal portion 29a in contact<br>
opposite to the lower surface of the horizontal portion<br>
26a of the operation plate 26, and an upright portion<br>
29b in contact opposite to the rear end face of the<br>
upright portion 26b. The press plate 30 standing<br>
upright in contact with the lower surface of the<br>
adjustment plate 29 is made of polyvinyl chloride as an<br>
elastic material with an overall wear resistance into a<br>
substantial L shape. The press plate 30 is comprised of<br>
a horizontal portion 39 with an upper end face in<br>
contact opposite to the horizontal portion 29a of the<br>
adjustment plate 29, and an upright portion 40 with a<br>
front end face in contact opposite to the upright<br>
portion 29b of the adjustment plate 29.<br>
The lower end face of the horizontal portion<br>
39 of the press plate 30 serves as a linear blade press<br>
portion 39a for pressing the blade 4, and the rear end<br><br>
face of the upright portion 40 serves as an arcuate ink<br>
fountain press portion 40a for pressing the outer<br>
surface of the ink fountain roller 1. The width of the<br>
adjustment plate 29 and the plate thickness of the press<br>
plate 30 are almost the same, and are slightly smaller<br>
than the thicknesses of the horizontal portion 26a and<br>
upright portion 26b of the operation plate 26.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5B, at the upper end portion<br>
of the fountain press portion 40a, i.e., on the upstream<br>
side in the rotational direction of the fountain roller<br>
1, an ink distribution portion 41 is formed, which has a<br>
pair of slant surfaces 41a slanting from the two side<br>
surfaces of the press plate 30 toward the upper end of<br>
the fountain press portion 40a. The planar shape of the<br>
upper end portion of the ink distribution portion 41 in<br>
the fountain press portion 40a is almost triangular, and<br>
the width of its distal end is set to be smaller than a<br>
width t (to be described below) of the fountain press<br>
portion 40a close to a boundary portion 42. At the<br>
boundary portion 42 between the fountain press portion<br>
40a and the blade press portion 39a, a projection 39b is<br>
formed, which projects from the blade press portion 39a<br>
downstream in the rotational direction along the outer<br>
surface of the fountain roller 1. The projection 39b<br>
presses the upper surface of the distal end of the ink<br>
fountain key 3 which is exposed from the fountain blade<br>
4. The boundary portion 42 allows the fountain press<br><br>
portion 40a to communicate with the blade press portion<br>
39a. In the plan view, as shown in Fig. 5C, the part of<br>
the fountain press portion 40a close to the boundary<br>
portion 42 is gradually tapered toward the distal end<br>
(toward the fountain roller 1). That is, the part of<br>
the fountain press portion 40a close to the boundary<br>
portion 42 has a pair of slant surfaces 42a which slant<br>
such that the part is gradually tapered from the two<br>
side surfaces toward the boundary portion 42.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the width t at the distal<br>
end of the boundary portion 42 is set to be smaller than<br>
the width T in the axial direction of the fountain<br>
roller 1, which is set more upstream of the fountain<br>
press portion 40a in the rotational direction (in the<br>
direction of the arrow A) of the fountain roller 1 than<br>
the boundary portion 42. Also, the width of the<br>
adjustment plate 29 and the thickness of the press plate<br>
30 in the axial direction of the fountain roller 1 are<br>
set to be substantially same. These widths are slightly<br>
smaller than the thicknesses of the horizontal portion<br>
26a and upright portion 26b of the operation plate 26.<br>
How to build the intermediate ink dam 25 in<br>
the ink fountain 6 will be described.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, flat head screws (not<br>
shown) inserted from the insertion holes 37 of the<br>
sandwiching plate 28 extend through the insertion holes<br>
32 of the operation plate 26, to threadably engage with<br><br>
the screw holes 36 of the sandwiching plate 27. This<br>
fixes the sandwiching plate 28 to the sandwiching plate<br>
27 to sandwich the operation plate 26. Then, set screws<br>
(not shown) are inserted from the insertion holes 38 of<br>
the sandwiching plate 28 to threadably engage with the<br>
screw holes 33 of the operation plate 26. This fixes<br>
the operation plate 26 to the sandwiching plate 28, so<br>
the operation plate 26 is sandwiched between the<br>
sandwiching plates 27 and 28.<br>
When the operation plate 26 is sandwiched by<br>
the sandwiching plates 27 and 28, a space between the<br>
sandwiching plates 27 and 28 is formed under the<br>
operation plate 26. The adjustment plate 29 and press<br>
plate 30 are sequentially engaged in this space, so the<br>
adjustment plate 29 is in contact opposite to the lower<br>
surface of the operation plate 26 and the press plate 30<br>
is in contact opposite to the lower surface of the<br>
adjustment plate 29. When the support 31 of the<br>
intermediate ink dam 25 built in this manner is fitted<br>
in the fitting groove 11 of the holder 10, as shown in<br>
Fig. 2, the intermediate ink dam 25 is supported in the<br>
fitting groove 11 to be slidable in a direction<br>
indicated by arrows E - F perpendicular to the axial<br>
direction of the ink fountain roller 1.<br>
At this time, the blade press portion 39a and<br>
ink fountain press portion 40a of the press plate 30<br>
project from the lower and rear ends, respectively, of<br><br>
each of the sandwiching plates 27 and 28. The elastic<br>
force of the compression coil spring 18 biases the<br>
operation rod 15 in a direction indicated by the arrow E<br>
to become close to the ink fountain roller 1, and the<br>
distal end of the press shaft portion 15b projecting<br>
from the insertion hole 13b abuts against the engaging<br>
surface 31b of the support 31. Since the engaging<br>
surface 31b is formed in such a direction that the angle<br>
α formed by the ink fountain blade 4 and the extension<br>
of the slant surface 31b is an acute angle, the press<br>
direction with respect to the press plate 30 changes as<br>
indicated by an arrow C. More specifically, the press<br>
plate 30 is pressed almost toward the point B where the<br>
outer surface of the ink fountain roller 1 and the ink<br>
fountain key 3 oppose each other. Therefore, the blade<br>
press portion 39a and ink fountain press portion 40a of<br>
the press plate 30 respectively press the ink fountain<br>
blade 4 and the outer surface of the ink fountain roller<br>
1, and accordingly the blade press portion 39a and ink<br>
fountain press portion 40a come into tight contact with<br>
the ink fountain blade 4 and the outer surface of the<br>
ink fountain roller 1, respectively.<br>
In this embodiment, since the operation plate<br>
26 presses the press plate 30 through the thin<br>
plate-like adjustment plate 29, the press plate 30 is<br>
pressed uniformly and will not be locally fractured.<br>
Since the adjustment plate 29 is made of an elastic<br><br>
material, local elastic deformation of the press plate<br>
30 can be prevented, so the tight contact force becomes<br>
uniform throughout the press plate 30.<br>
How to adjust the tight contact state of the<br>
press plate 30 with respect to the ink fountain blade 4<br>
and the outer surface of the ink fountain roller 1 will<br>
be described.<br>
When the tight contact state of the whole<br>
press plate 30 is to be adjusted, the screw 17 is<br>
pivoted to change the forward/backward moving amount of<br>
the screw 17 with respect to the spring accommodating<br>
hole 13, thereby changing the elastic force of the<br>
compression coil spring 18. Thus, the press force of<br>
the compression coil spring 18 to press the press shaft<br>
portion 15b toward the engaging surface 31b changes, so<br>
the whole tight contact can be adjusted. This adjusting<br>
operation can be performed by only pivoting the screw 17.<br>
Therefore, tight contact adjustment can be performed<br>
easily.<br>
If tight contact between the blade press<br>
portion 39a and ink fountain blade 4 and that between<br>
the ink fountain press portion 40a and the outer surface<br>
of the ink fountain roller 1 are partly insufficient,<br>
the threadable engagement amounts of the adjustment<br>
bolts 34a, 34b, and 34c are adjusted separately, to<br>
adjust the tight contact partly. In this case, when the<br>
threadable engagement amount of the adjustment bolt 34b,<br><br>
which moves forward/backward with respect to the point B<br>
where the outer surface of the ink fountain roller 1 and<br>
the ink fountain keys 3 oppose each other, is adjusted,<br>
the tight contact between the blade press portion 39a<br>
and ink fountain blade 4 and that between the ink<br>
fountain press portion 40a and the outer surface of the<br>
ink fountain roller 1 can be adjusted simultaneously.<br>
According to this embodiment, the tight<br>
contact state of the press plate 30 can be partly<br>
adjusted, so partial outflow of the ink can be prevented.<br>
As a result, the amount of ink consumed can be reduced,<br>
and the printing quality of rainbow printing can be<br>
improved. As the press plate 30 is made of the elastic<br>
material, when the press state is to be partly adjusted,<br>
partial deformation of the press plate 30 due to the<br>
adjustment bolts 34a to 34c can be prevented.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, a projection 39b for<br>
pressing the upper surface of the distal end of the<br>
corresponding ink fountain key 3 exposed from the<br>
fountain blade 4 is formed at the distal end of the<br>
blade press portion 39a of the press plate 30. Since<br>
the projection 39b locally presses the upper surface of<br>
the distal end of the ink fountain key 3, and the blade<br>
press portion 39a except for the projection 39b presses<br>
the upper surface of the fountain blade 4, the tight<br>
contact of the press plate 30 to the fountain key 3 and<br>
the fountain blade 4 is further improved. Therefore,<br><br>
the ink from the ink fountain roller 1 does not enter a<br>
portion between the blade press portion 39a and ink<br>
fountain blade 4, through the blade press portion 39a<br>
and the ink fountain key 3. As a result, ink to be used<br>
for subsequent printing is prevented from mixing with<br>
printing ink used previously. Also, the ink fountain<br>
key 3 is prevented from causing an operation error<br>
because the entering ink solidifies.<br>
Since the press plate 30 is made of the<br>
wear-resistant elastic material, wear of the press plate<br>
30 at its portion in contact opposite to the ink<br>
fountain roller 1 and that in contact opposite to the<br>
ink fountain blade 4 are reduced. Also, the tight<br>
contact of the press plate 30 at its portion in contact<br>
opposite to the ink fountain roller 1 and that in<br>
contact opposite to the ink fountain blade 4 are<br>
improved.<br>
To remove the intermediate ink dam 25, as<br>
shown in Fig. 2, the operator holds the holding member<br>
16, and moves the operation rod 15 against the elastic<br>
force of the compression coil spring 18 in a direction<br>
to separate it away from the ink fountain roller 1.<br>
Then, the operator releases the engaging surface 31b<br>
which has been pressed by the press shaft portion 15b,<br>
and removes the operation rod 15 from the holder 10. In<br>
this manner, the intermediate ink dam 25 can be mounted<br>
and detached by merely moving the operation rod 15<br><br>
against the elastic force of the compression coil spring<br>
18 without requiring a tool. Thus, the intermediate ink<br>
dams 25 can be mounted and detached easily.<br>
When the intermediate ink dam 25 is to be<br>
positionally adjusted in the axial direction of the ink<br>
fountain roller 1, in Fig. 2, the operator loosens the<br>
fastened nut 20 and rotates the set screw 19 to move it<br>
backward. Then, as shown in Fig. 4, the operator<br>
releases the holder 10 which has been fixed to the bar<br>
8, and moves the holder 10 in the axial direction of the<br>
ink fountain roller 1 indicated by arrows G - H. In<br>
this manner, position adjustment of the intermediate ink<br>
dam 25 can be performed by merely loosening the fastened<br>
nut 20 and thereafter rotating the set screw 19. As a<br>
result, operation becomes easy.<br>
Next, the flow of the ink on the outer surface<br>
of the ink fountain roller 1 will be described with<br>
reference to Fig. 6. Standing ink is prevented by the<br>
ink distribution portion 41 of the fountain press<br>
portion 40a, which is arranged upstream in the<br>
rotational direction of the fountain roller 1.<br>
Therefore, the ink on the outer surface of the ink<br>
fountain roller 1 is distributed to the right and left<br>
of the fountain press portion 40a, so adjacent inks do<br>
not mix with each other. Since the width T of the<br>
fountain press portion 40a on the upstream side of the<br>
fountain roller 1 is larger than the width t of the<br><br>
fountain press portion 40a close to the boundary portion<br>
42, the intermediate ink dam 25 does not slantly<br>
attached for the fountain roller 1. For this reason,<br>
adjacent inks are prevented from mixing.<br>
Alternatively, since the width t of the<br>
fountain press portion 40a close to the boundary portion<br>
42 is smaller than the width T of the fountain press<br>
portion 40a on the upstream side of the fountain roller<br>
1, the boundary portion 42 can stop supplying the ink<br>
without making the press force applied to the fountain<br>
roller 1 large. That is, the boundary portion 42 having<br>
a pair of slant surfaces 42a positions downstream of the<br>
fountain press portion 40a in the rotational direction<br>
of the fountain roller 1. For this reason, the boundary<br>
portion 42 forms a band portion 45 (width t) with no ink<br>
downstream in the rotational direction of the fountain<br>
roller 1. This band portion 45 certainly partitions the<br>
adjacent inks on the outer surface of the fountain<br>
roller 1 so that the inks are prevented from mixing.<br>
In this embodiment, since the press force<br>
applied from the press plate 30 to press the fountain<br>
roller 1 need not be large, the flexure amount of the<br>
fountain roller 1 can decrease to form an ink film 43<br>
with the appropriate film thickness on the outer surface<br>
of the fountain roller 1. Also, since the width t of<br>
the boundary portion 42 for stopping supplying the ink<br>
is small, the boundary portion 42 slightly deforms with<br><br>
respect to the outer surface of the fountain roller 1<br>
and the bottom plate when rotating the fountain roller<br>
1. For this reason, the tight contact of the boundary<br>
portion 42 to the ink fountain roller 1 is improved.<br>
Also, since the press force applied from the<br>
press plate 30 to the fountain roller 1 can decrease,<br>
the overload is not applied from the press plate 30 to<br>
the fountain roller 1. For this reason, the overload<br>
applied to the rotational driving system of the fountain<br>
roller 1 can be prevented. Also, since the press force<br>
applied from the press plate 30 to the fountain roller 1<br>
can decrease, the thin ink film is formed between two<br>
sides 44 of the fountain press portion 40a and the<br>
fountain roller 1 to serve as a lubricant. Therefore,<br>
the contact resistance between the outer surface of the<br>
fountain roller 1 and the fountain press portion 40a can<br>
decrease, and a driving source for driving the fountain<br>
roller 1 can be small.<br>
Also, since the press force applied from the<br>
press plate 30 to the fountain roller 1 can decrease,<br>
the biasing force of the compression coil spring 18 can<br>
decrease. For this reason, when building the parts, the<br>
influence such as local contact between parts can be<br>
suppressed, and the operation of adjusting the<br>
variations of the contact states of the intermediate ink<br>
dams 25 with the fountain roller 1 can be facilitated.<br>
Also, since the width of the partition of the ink<br><br>
becomes small depending on the width t of the boundary<br>
portion 42, the swing amount of the oscillation roller<br>
of the ink apparatus decreases, thereby preventing the<br>
inks from mixing.<br>
Note that the shape of the distal end is set<br>
to be trapezoidal by forming the pair of the slant<br>
surfaces 42a in order to decrease the width t of the<br>
boundary portion 42. However, the present invention is<br>
not limited to this. For example, the shape of the<br>
distal end of the boundary portion 42 may be a convex.<br>
In short, the present invention can be implemented as<br>
long as the width t of the boundary portion 42 is<br>
smaller than the width T of the fountain press portion<br>
40a.<br>
As described above, in the present invention,<br>
the intermediate ink dams are not slantly attached for<br>
the fountain roller so that the inks are prevented from<br>
mixing. Also, since the press force applied to the<br>
fountain roller decreases, the ink film with the<br>
appropriate film thickness can be formed on the outer<br>
surface of the fountain roller, thereby preventing from<br>
applying the overload to the rotational system of the<br>
fountain roller.<br><br>
