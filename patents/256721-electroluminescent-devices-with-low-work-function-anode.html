Related Application<br>
This application claims foreign priority based on Korean Patent Application "No. 2002-78809, filed December 11,2002, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Background of the Invention Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to display technology. More particularly, the present invention relates to organic electroluminescent devices.<br>
Description of the Related Ait<br>
Organic luminescence or organic electroluminescence is an instance in which electric cun'ent is converted into visible light by internal processes of organic compounds. Organic compounds having either fluorescent or phosphorescent characteristics generate light emission upon the application of electric current. Both organic fluorescent and phosphorescent molecules are referred to as organic light-emitting compounds.<br>
An organic luminescent or electroluminescent device is generally composed of two opposing electrodes and at least one layer interposed between the two electrodes. The at least one layer between the electrodes contains at least one organic light-emitting compound. Electrons and holes, collectively referred to as carriers, are injected into the layer from the two electrodes, which are a cathode and an anode. Upon application of appropriate electric power, the cathode is to inject electrons toward the interposed layer, while anode is to inject holes toward the same layer.<br>
Performance of organic electroluminescent devices depends on. among many factors, the quantity of the carriers injected from the electrodes. The more the carriers are injected, the more likely to have high luminescence or brightness. To inject a large number qf_carriers__trom the electrodes at a low driving voltage, materials for the electrodes<br>
are chosen such that the carriers are easily injected therefrom. The anode is generally made from materials having a high work function. The cathode is generally made from materials having a low work function. In a single electroluminescent device, the work function of the anode material is higher than that of the cathode material.<br><br>
Further, to inject a larger number of carriers from the electrodes at a low driving voltage, carrier-injecting layers may be introduced. The carrier-injecting layers are to facilitate injection of carriers from the electrodes. A hole-injecting layer may be formed<br>
on the side of the anode, facing the cathode. An electron-injecting layer may be formed on_ the side of the cathode, facing the anode. Materials for the carrier-injecting layers are also chosen such that the carrier-injecting layers easily receive carriers from the electrodes. The hole-injecting layer is generally made from materials having a low oxidation potential, which are easily oxidized at a low electric potential applied. The electron-injecting layer is generally made from materials having a low reduction potential, which are easily reduced at a low electric potential applied.<br>

Constructions of Organic EL Devices<br>
^Organic EL devices in accordance with  various embodiments of the present \ invention can be constructed in various ways.   General construction of the organic EL   \ devices includes two opposing electrodes and one or more functional layers interposed between the electrodes. The term "layer" refers to a deposit, coat or film of one material or a mixture of two or more materials.    Figures  1-6 illustrate exemplary cross-sectional constructions of the organic EL devices that can embody various aspects of the present invention.   In these drawings, the same reference numbers are used to indicate like layers or components among the constructions.   It should be noted that these constructions are not exhaustive variants of the organic EL devices in accordance of the present invention.<br>
The illustrated organic EL devices 10 has a subsiraie I. an anode 3. a cathode 15 and one or more functional layers located between the anode 3 and the cathode 15. The one or more intervening functional layers include a hole-injecting layer 5. a hole-transporting layer 7, a light-emitting layer 9, an electron-transporting layer U, an electron-injecting layer 13 and multi-functional layers having functions of two or more of the foregoing layers. A non-exhaustive list of the multi-functional layers includes a layer with hole-injecting and hole-transporting functions, a layer with hole-injecting and light-emitting functions, a layer with hole-injecting, hole-transporting and light emitting<br><br>
functions, a layer with electron-injecting and electron-transporting functions, a layer with electron-transporting and light-emitting functions, a layer with electron-injecting, electron-transporting and light-emitting functions, and so forth.<br>
The substrate 1 (Figures 1-6) supports the laminated structure of the organic EL device 10.  Although the drawings show that the substrate 1 is located on the side of the anode 3, the substrate 1 may be located on the side of the cathode 15.   In either case, the substrate 1 provides a support on which the laminated construction of the organic EL device can be built during the manufacturing.  The anode 3 (Figures 1-6) and cathode 15 (Figures 1-6) are electrically connected to an electric power source 17 (Figures 1-6) via a switch 19 (Figures 1-6). which is controlled by a controller (not shown).   Although not illustrated, either or both of the electrodes 3 and 15 may be formed in multiple layers, which may or may not include a non-conductive layer, which is often called "a buffer layer".  The hole-injecting layer 5 (Figures 1-3) is to facilitate the injection of holes from the anode 3 into the hole-transporting layer 7 (Figures  1-5).    Similarly, the electron-injecting layer 13 (Figures  1  and 4) is to facilitate the injection of electrons from the cathode 15 into the electron-transporting layer 13.    The hole-transporting layer 7 is to accelerate movement of holes away from the anode 3 and/or the hole-injecting layer 5 toward the light-emitting layer 9 (Figures 1-6). The electron-transporting layer 1 I (Figures I. 2. 4 and 5) is to accelerate movement of electrons away from the cathode 15 and/or the electron-injecting layer 13 toward the light-emitting layer 9 (Figures 1-6).   With regard to the  functional   layers and  other  features of organic   EL devices,   refer to   U.S.  Patent<br>
Application Publication No.	of U.S. Patent Application No.  10/099.78!. filed<br>
March   14, 2002 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 	 of U.S. Patent<br>
Application No.  10/431.349. filed May 6. 2003, the publications of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety<br>
When applying an appropriate electric voltage between the electrodes 3 and 15, electrons and holes are injected from the cathode 15 and anode 3. respectively, into intervening layer(s). The holes and electrons travel to and recombine at light-emitting molecules located in the intervening layer. Recombined pairs of electrons and holes, namely excitons, transfer the energy of the recombination to the light-emitting molecules where they recombined. Alternatively, excitons move around for a short period of time and transfer the recombination energy to other light-emitting molecules, particularly to<br><br>
those having a smaller band gap than the light-emitting molecules where they recombined. The transferred energy is used to excite valence electrons of the light-emitting molecules, which generates photons when the electrons return to their ground state.<br>

In an embodiment of the present invention, the organic EL device 10 includes at<br><br>
least one of the compounds of Formulas la-lf. Optionally, at least one of the compound of Formulas la-lf is contained in any of the layers singly or in combination with one or more compounds of Formula I or others. Still optionally, the compound of Formula la is contained in at least one of the layers of the organic EL device 10 singly or in combination with one or more other compounds, which may or may not be compounds represented by Formula 1.<br>
Generally, compounds of Formula I may be used in any of the functional or multifunctional layers of the organic EL device 10. Optionally, the compounds are those of Formula la-lf. Optionally, one or more compounds represented by Formula 1 are contained in any of the layers contacting the anode 3. In one embodiment, the organic EL device includes a hole-injecting layer 5 as illustrated in Figures 1-3, and at least one of the compounds represented by Formula I is contained in that hole-injecting layer 5. Optionally, the hole-injecting layer is formed with at least one compound represented by Formula I substantially free of other materials. Alternatively, the hole-injecting layer is formed with at least one of the compounds represented by Formula 1 in combination with one or more other materials.<br>
In another embodiment, the organic EL device includes a hole-transporting layer 7 as illustrated in Figures 1-5, and at least one of the compounds represented by Formula 1 is contained in the hole-transporting layer 7. Optionally, the compounds are those of Formula la-lf. Optionally, the hole-transporting layer is formed with at least one compound of Formula I either substantially free of oilier materials or in combination with one or more other materials. In another embodiment, the organic EL device includes a layer for the functions including hole-injection and hole-transportation, and this multifunctional layer contains at least one compound represented by Formula I. This multi-functional layer is formed with at least one compound of Formula 1 either substantially free of other materials or in combination with one or more other materials.<br>
Virtual Electrode<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to formation of a virtual electrode in the operation of electronic devices including organic EL devices. The term "virtual electrode" is to refer to charge carrier accumulation in an internal area of an electronic device when it is vie\\ed like an electrode from the perspective of a real electrode. The<br><br>
virtual electrode enhances or facilitates injection of the carriers from the real electrode.<br>
Now the formation of a virtual electrode is discussed with reference to an exemplary organic EL device 16 construction of Figure 7. Although the discussion is in the context of EL devices, the virtual electrode is not a phenomenon unique only in organic EL devices, but can occur in any other electronic devices. The organic EL device 16 includes an anode 3 and a cathode 15 that are opposingly located. Each electrode 3 and 15 is connected to the power source 17 with a control switch 19. A first layer 21 and a second layer 23 are interposed between the opposing electrodes 3 and 1 5. At least one of the first and second layers 21 and 23 contain a light emitting material.<br>
Without wishing to be bound for any theory of why the invention works, in one embodiment, the First layer 21 is made of a material that is more slable in its reduced state than its neutral state. Here, a material is more stable in its reduced slate than its neutral slate if the material spontaneously turns to its reduced state from its neutral state. Further suppose, for example, that electrons have very low mobility in the material of the first layer 21 while holes are high mobility therein. When the contact between the anode 3 and the first layer 21 is formed, free electrons of the anode 3 are transferred to the first layer 21<br>
f<br>
and for reduction of the material of the first layer 21. Because of poor electron mobility in the material, the transferred electrons hardly travel within the first layer 21 after crossing over the border 27 between the anode 3 and the first layer 21. Rather, the transferred electrons stay near the border 27 on the side of the first laver 21. Accordingly the<br>
•^	-"	w    *<br>
electrons transferred from the anode 3 to the first la\ cr 11 accumulate along the border 27 as illustrated with referenced with number 25.<br>
From the perspective of the anode 3. the accumulated electrons or negative charges 25 along the border 27 are viewed as if the source of electrons, that is. the cathode of the device, is located very close to the border 27 because of the abundance of ne»ati\ e charges. In that sense, the area of the accumulated electrons 25 is called a virtual cathode. When applying a forward bias between the electrodes 3 aiv! 15 by the operation of the switch 19. the anode 3 injects holes toward the virtual cathode 25 and therefore toward the first layer 21. The closeness of the negative charges of the virtual cathode from the anode 3 facilitates the injection of holes from the anode 3. The holes injected into the first layer 21 moves forward in the direction toward the real cathode 1 5 or the second layer 23 with the momentum of the injection from the anode 3 and with the forward bias between the two<br><br>
electrodes 3 and 15. The high hole mobility of the material for the first layer 21 helps the transportation of the holes in the direction toward the real cathode 15 or the second layer<br>
23.<br>
A similar phenomenon may occur in the second layer 23 to form a virtual anode by accumulation of holes along the border 29 between the cathode 15 and the second layer 23. The material for the second layer 23 are selected from those which are more stable in its oxidized state than its neutral state, and have low hole mobility and high electron mobility therein. Holes are transferred from the cathode 15 to the second layer 23 and accumulate near the border between the cathode 15 and the second layer 23. The accumulated holes are viewed as a virtual anode from the perspective of cathode 15. Upon application of an appropriate electric power in a forward bias, the cathode 15 will inject electrons into the second layer 23.<br>
In accordance with various embodiments of the present invention, charge carriers accumulate in an internal area of the device to form a virtual electrode.   In the organic EL device 16 (Figure 7). for example, the first layer 21 may constitute a hole-injecting layer, a hole-transporting layer, a light-emitting layer or a multi-functional layer with the functions of the foregoing layers.   Alternatively, the first layer 21 may not exist, and the anode 3 contacts the second layer 23.   The second layer 23 may constitute, for example, a hole-transporting  layer,  a  light-emitting  layer, an electron-transporting  layer, an  electron-injecting layer or a multi-functional layer with one or more functions of the foregoing layers.   Alternatively, the second layer 23 may not exist, and the cathode 15 contacts the first layer 21.   Although the phenomenon is discussed in terms of the organic EL device having one or two of the layers 21 and 23, the same applies in any other constructions of organic EL devices, for example, having more than two layers interposed between the anode 3 and cathode 15.<br>
In the embodiment of the organic EL device forming a virtual electrode, the first layer 21 contains a chemical compound which is more stable in its reduced state than its neutral state. Optionally, such a chemical compound is selected from the compounds represented by Formula I. Preferably, the first layer contains the compound of Formula la. In another embodiment, a chemical compound for the first layer 21 has a reduction potential from about -0.6 Volts (V) to about 0 V. preferably, from about -0.2 V to about 0 V. Alternatively, the reduction potential of the compound for the first layer 21 is from<br><br>
about -0.3 V to about 0 V, optionally from about -O.I to about 0 V.   The first layer 21 contains a chemical compound, in which electrons have low mobility while holes have high mobility. The compound for the first layer 21 has electron mobility equal to or lower than about IO"5 cm/V.s. preferably from about 10"'° cm/V.s to about 10"   cm/V.s.   The<br>
-4<br>
compound for the first layer 21 has hole mobility equal to or higher than about 10   cm/V.s, preferably from about 10"  cm/V.s to about 1 cm/V.s.<br>
In an embodiment of the organic EL device forming a virtual electrode, the second<br>
layer 23 contains a chemical compound, which is more stable in its oxidized state than its neutral state.   In another embodiment, the second layer 23 contains a chemical compound for the second layer 23 has an oxidation potential equal to or lower than about 0.5 V. Alternative!}., the oxidation potential of the compound is from about 0 to about 0.4 V. preferably, from about 0 to about 0.3  V.    The second  layer 23 contains a chemical compound, in which holes have low mobility while electrons have high mobility.   The compound for the second layer 23 has hole mobility equal to or lower than about 10 cm/V.s, preferably from about 10"    cm/V.s to about 10"" cm/V.s.  The compound for the second layer 23 has electron mobility equal to or higher than about 10"  cm/V.s. preferably from about 10° cm/V.s to about I cm/V.s.<br>
Work-Function of Electrode Materials<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to use of a material having a low work function in the anode 3.    It has been general knowledge in the relevant art that materials for an anode are selected from those having a relatively high work function; on the other hand, materials for a cathode are selected from those having a relatively low work function.   In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. ho\\e\er. an organic EL device has an anode, the material of which has a relatively low work function. For example, the work function of the anode material is below about 4.5 eV. preferably below about 4.3 eV.  Alternatively, the work function of the anode material is from about 3.5 eV to about 4.5 eV. preferably from about 3.8 eV to about 4.3 eV.  The materials for use in an anode includes, for example, aluminum (Ai, 4.28 eV). silver (Ag. 4.26 eV), zinc (Zn. 4.33 eV), niobium (Nb, 4.3 eV). zirconium (Zr, 4.05 eV), tin (Sn, 4.42 eV). tantalum (Ta; 4.25 eV). vanadium (V. 4.3 eV), mercury (Hg, 4.49 eV), gallium (Ga. 4.2 eV). indium<br><br>
(In, 4.12 eV), cadmium (Cd, 4.22 eV), boron (B, 4.4 eV), hafnium, (Hf, 3.9 eV), lanthanum (La, 3.5 eV), niobium (Nb, 4.3 eV), titanium (Ti, 4.3 eV) or alloys of one of above metals with neodymium (Nd) or palladium (Pd).<br>
One possible, but non-limiting explanation for the use of a relatively low work-function material in an anode is that the low work-function anode material helps formation of the above-described virtual cathode. Referring back to Figure 7, the low work-function material of the anode 3 easily transfers electrons to the first layer 21 upon formation of the contact between the anode 3 and the first layer 21. The electron transfer from the anode 3 to the first layer 21 is enhanced upon application of an appropriate voltage. The electrons transferred into the first layer 21 form the virtual cathode 25, which enhances the hole injection from the anode 3 into the first layer 2 I and in the direction toward the real cathode 15 as described above.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the work function of the cathode material is below about 4.5eV. The materials for use in the cathode 15 include, for example, magnesium, calcium, sodium, potassium, titanium, indium, yttrium, lithium, gadolinium, aluminum, silver, tin. lead, similar metals, CsF. alloys containing one or more of the foregoing metals, or multiple layers containing one or more of the foregoing metals including LiF/Al and LUO/Al. Either transparent or non-transparent materials may be used for the cathode 15. depending upon the construction of the light passage in the organic EL device as discussed above. Those of ordinary skill in the ait would appreciate any other materials that can be used in the cathode 15 and also the selection of appropriate cathode materials.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the anode 3 has a single layered construction formed of a single material, which can be a substantially pure elemental material or a homogeneous or non-homogeneous alloy. In another embodiment, the anode 3 may include multiple sublayers, which may or may not include a non-conductive sublayer. Optionally, the discussion above of (he work function of anode materials apply only to conductive part of the anode 3. not to a non-conductive sublayer or part thereof. Optionally, the anode 3 may have one or more conductive material sublayers. In the case of the anode construction including multiple conductive material sublayers, the discussion above of the work function of anode materials applies to at least one of the conductive materials.<br><br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to use of a material having a high work function in the cathode 15. Just like the low work-function anode, the high work-function cathode material helps formation of the above-described virtual anode. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, an organic EL device 10 has a cathode 15, the material of which has a high work function. For example, the work function of the cathode material is above about 3.5 eV, preferably above about 4 eV. Alternatively, the work function of the cathode material is from about 4.1 eV to about 5.0 eV, preferably from about 4.1 eV to about 4.8 eV.<br>
Reflective Materials for Anode<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to the use of reflective material in the anode 3 of an organic EL device. In an embodiment of the organic EL device according to the present invention, the anode is formed with one or more materials having high reflectivity. For example, the reflectivity as a ratio of a reflected light intensity to an inputted light intensity is above about 0.2. for example from about 0.4 to about I. Reflective materials for use in the anode 3 include, for example, aluminum, silver, gold.<br>
/*<br>
nickel, chromium, molybdenum, tantalum, titanium, and zinc. Optionally, the materials have the reflectivity to substantially all of the wavelength components of visible light. Optionally, the materials have substantially even reflectivity to substantially all of the wavelength components of visible light. Preferably, the reflective anode materials are. for example, aluminum, silver, platinum, chromium and nickel.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the anode 3 may include a plurality of sublayers. Optionally, the anode 3 may be formed of at least one transparent sublayer and a reflective sublayer. The at least one transparent sublayer may be formed with transparent materials, for example, including ITO (indium tin oxide). IZO (indium zinc oxide), and fluorinated tin oxide. The reflective sublayer is formed with one or more reflective materials as described above. As an alternative embodiment, the anode 3 is a single layer made of a reflective material. The single layer construction of the anode is advantageous over the multi-sublayer construction in terms of the simplicity in the manufacturing process.<br><br>
Top Emission<br>
In the constructions of Figures 1-6 where the anode 3, not the cathode 15, contacts the substrate 1, the use of reflective material in the anode 3 allows the generated light to emit through the cathode 15 or in a direction other than through the anode 3. In the same constructions of Figures 1-6, the emission through the cathode 15 is referred to as top emission; on the other hand, the emission through the anode 3 and substrate 1 is referred to as bottom emission. Optionally, the organic EL device 10 may be constructed in the top emission design. For top emission, the cathode 15 is substantially transparent.<br>
In one embodiment, the substantially transparent cathode 15 is formed in a single layer of one or more transparent conductive materials.    Examples of the transparent conductive materials  include  1TO (indium tin oxide).   IZO (indium  zinc oxide) and fluorinated tin oxide.   Alternatively, the substantially transparent cathode 15 is formed in multiple  layers  (not  shown).     For  example,  the  cathode   15   in  the   multiple  layer construction may include a thin layer made of a normally non-transparent material and a transparent material layer.    The thin layer of the normally non-transparent material is formed in a thickness through which the visible light emitted from an organic EL material can pass.  Optionally, the thickness, of the thin layer is from about 10 A to about 500 A, preferably from about 10 A to about 200 A.   The normally non-transparent materials for use in the thin layer include, for example, magnesium (Mg). calcium (Ca). lithium (Li), aluminum (Al).   indium (In), potassium (K), yttrium (Y). strontium (St), europium (Eu). sodium (Ma), gallium (Ga), samarium (Sm) or an alloy or mixture of two or more of the foregoing elements.    The transparent material layer is made of one or more materials, which are, for example, indium tin oxide (1TO). indium zinc oxide (IZO) and fluorinated tin oxide.   The thickness of the transparent material layer is from about 100 A to about 5000 A.   The cathode 15 in the multiple layer construction may further include one or more additional layers.<br>
Location and Kind of Control Circuits<br>
The top emission design of organic EL devices is generally more compatible with active matrix driving of the devices than the bottom emission design. The active matrix driving requires a layer 31 for a transistor or an integrated circuit between the substrate 1 and the anode 3 as illustrated in Figure 8. In organic EL devices with the bottom emission<br><br>
design, the integrated circuit layer 31 will block at least some of the light emitted from the light-emitting compound. However, the top emission design would not be affected by the existence of the integrated circuit layer 31 below the anode 3. Nor would the top emission design be affected by the technology of forming the integrated circuit layer 31. for example use of amorphous silicon or polysilicon, which affects the aperture ratio of the layer 31.<br>
In the embodiment of top emission design, the organic EL devices utilize either passive matrix or active matrix circuit design. Optionally, the top emission design utilizes active matrix circuit design. Still optionally, the integrated circuit for the active matrix driving is formed between the substrate I and the anode 3. Still optionally, the integrated circuit is formed with the amorphous silicon technology.<br>
Sealing laver<br>
In certain embodiments of organic EL devices, it is advantageous to have a sealing layer between the substrate 1 and the anode 3 to prevent moisture or other contaminating substances from permeating into the intricate area of laminated structure.   Such a sealing layer  is  more  important  particularly  when  the  material  for the  substrate   1   is  more permeable.  The sealing layer is often made with one or more substantially non-permeable or semi-permeable materials. Such materials are. for example, aluminum, aluminum oxide, strontium oxide, barium oxide, silicon oxide, silicon nitride.   The sealing layer may be constructed in multiple layers including ai least one organic sub-layer and at least one inorganic   sub-layer.       An   organic   sub-layer   may   be   formed   with,   for   example, polyphenylethylene.   polymerized   epoxy   compounds   and/or   polycyclicalkane.      An inorganic sub-layer may be formed with, for example, silicon nitride, silicon oxide and/or barium oxide.      To the extent that the substantially non-permeable or semi-permeable material can a!so be used as an anode material, the anode 3 itself forms the sealing layer. Thus, no separate sealing layer need to be formed.    In an embodiment of the present invention, the anode 3 is made of aluminum, aluminum-neodymium alloy or aluminum-palladium alloy, which functions as sealing layer as well.  The anode 3 that also functions as a sealing layer is used together with any appropriate substrate materials with or without intervening integrated circuit layer 31 between the substrate 1 and the anode 3.<br><br>
Non-Conductive Sublayer of Anode<br>
In any organic EL device embodiments of present invention, either or both of the anode 3 and cathode 15 may be formed in multiple sublayers. Referring to Figure 9, for example, the anode 3 of the illustrated organic EL device includes a conductive sublayer 33 and a non-conductive sublayer 35. Although shown in two sublayers, the anode 3 may have more than two sublayers. As illustrated, the non-conductive sublayer 35 is located between the conductive sublayer 33 and the hole-injecting layer 5. which contacts the anode 3 on its side toward the cathode 15. The hole-injecting layer 5 in this laminated anode construction can be substituted for a hole-transporting layer 7 (Figures 4 and 5), a light-emitting layer 9 (Figure 6) or a multi-functional layer (not shown). In the alternative, the non-conductive sublayer 35 may be considered as a separate layer inserted between ihe anode 3 and the layer 5, 7 or 9 contacting the anode 3.<br>
Considered as a separate layer, the non-conductive sublayer 35 may be referred to as a buffer layer. Regardless of its name, the non-conductive sublayer or buffer layer 35 is formed to improve interfacial strength between the conductive sublayer 33 (or anode 3) and the layer 5. 7 or 9 contacting the anode 3. The non-conductive sublayer or buffer layer<br>
?<br>
35 also help lowering the energy barrier for the injection of holes from the conductive sublayer 33 into the layer 5.7, or 9 contacting the non-conductive sublayer 35.    In an embodiment, the non-conductive sublayer or buffer layer 35 is formed with one or more inorganic materials.   Optionally, the materials for the buffer layer include, for example, aluminum   oxides,   titanium   oxides,   zinc   oxides,   ruthenium   oxides,   nickel   oxides, zirconium oxides, tantalum oxides, magnesium oxides, calcium oxides, strontium oxides, vanadium oxides, yttrium oxides, lithium oxides, cesium oxides, chromium oxides, silicon oxides, barium oxides, manganese oxides, cobalt oxides, copper oxides, praseodymium oxides,   tungsten   oxides,   germanium   oxides,   potassium   oxides,   lithium   fluoride, magnesium   fluoride,  cesium   fluoride,  calcium   fluoride,  sodium  chloride,  potassium chloride, lithium  inelaborate (BiBO:). potassium silicate (K^SiO.O- silicon-germanium oxides, barium litanate. lithium tantalate (LiTaO;,)- silicon nitride (SisN.)), boron nitride (BN). nitrides of elements in Family III or IV of the Periodic Table of the Elements, zinc sulfide (ZnS), cadmium sulfide (CdS). cadmium selenide (CdSe). gallium phosphide (GaP), gallium nitride (GaN) and combinations of two or more of the foregoing materials.<br><br>
Manufacturing the device<br>
Various layers of the organic EL devices of the present invention can be produced by utilizing any film forming techniques,  including sputtering, electron  beam vapor deposition., other types of physical vapor depositions (PVD). chemical vapor deposition (CVD), spin coating, dip coating, doctor blading, inkjet printing, screen-printing, roll-coating and thermal transfer.   These techniques are generally described in the following publications, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference: Applied Physics Letters, 73, 18. 1998, 2561-2563; Applied Physics Letters. 78. 24. 2001. 3905-3907.
