After adding toluene (180 mLN6V), cone, hydrochloric acid (0.7lw, 21.3 g) is added dropwise at 30°C or below and bubbled with nitrogen at 25°C for one hour. Toluene is evaporated until the concentration of hydrogen cyanide becomes 50 ppm or less(20 mmHg). After adding water (5.4V, 163 mL), 37% formalin (17 mL, 2 equiv.) is added at room temperature. The mixture is stirred overnight, and the amount of hydrogen cyanide in the gas phase is confirmed to be 5 ppm on a detection tube. After adding 37% formalin (17 mL, 2 equiv.), the mixture is stirred at 35°C for one hour, and the amount of hydrogen cyanide in the gas phase is confirmed to be 1 ppm or below on a detection tube. The mixture is ice-cooled (4°C) for one hour. The crystals are collected by filtration, washed with water (6V, 180 mL), aqueous 5% sodium bicarbonate (IV, 30 ml), and then water (2v, 60ml) (pH=7). The wet materials are suspended into acetone (1.5 V, 45 mL), stirred for 0.5 hours under reflux, cooled gradually, stirred at 5°C for one hour under ice-cooling, and filtered. The resulting crystals are washed with 0.5V of acetone (15 mL), and dried with a conical dryer to give 3-cyano-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-morpholinyl)amide (20.06 g, yield: 82.4%, content: 98.1%).
