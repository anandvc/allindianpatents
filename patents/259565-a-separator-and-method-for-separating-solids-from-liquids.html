				<td>The present invention relates a separator and method for separating solids from liquids.<br>
Background<br>
This invention relates generally to a screen separator, and in particular to a vibrating screen separator.<br>
A typical screen separator consists of an elongated, box-like, rigid bed, and a screen attached to, and extending across, the bed. The bed is vibrated as the material to'be separated is introduced to the screen which moves the relatively large size material along the screen and off the end of the bed and passes the liquid and/or relatively small sized material into a pan. The bed can be vibrated by pneumatic, hydraulic, or rotary vibrators, in a conventional manner.<br>
Conventional screen separators are not capable of providing both balanced elliptical and linear motion.<br>
The present invention is directed to overcoming one or more of the limitations of existing screen separators.<br>
Summary<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, a separator for separating solids from liquids is provided that includes a frame, a screen coupled to the frame, means for moving the frame along a reciprocating linear path of travel, and means for moving the frame along an elliptical path of travel.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, a method of operating a separator including a screen coupled to a frame is provided that includes injecting a fluidic material including solids and liquids onto the screen, moving the frame along a reciprocating linear path of travel in a first mode of operation, and moving the frame along an elliptical path in a second mode of operation.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, a separator is provided that includes a frame, a screen coupled to the frame, an actuator for imparting reciprocating motion to the frame coupled to the frame, an actuator for imparting elliptical motion to the frame coupled to the frame, and a controller operably coupled to the actuator for imparting reciprocating motion to the frame and the actuator for imparting elliptical motion to the frame for controlling the operation of the actuator for imparting reciprocating motion to the frame and the actuator for imparting elliptical motion to the frame. The controller is programmed to operate in a first mode of operation in which the actuator for imparting reciprocating motion is operated and in a second mode of operation in which the actuator for imparting elliptical motion is operated.<br>
The present embodiments of the invention provide a number of advantages. For-example, the ability to operate in a linear or an elliptical mode of operation without physical restructuring or mechanical reconfiguration of the assembly provides an efficient, reliable, and cost-effective system for providing both modes of operation.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring to Figs. 1a and 1b, the reference numeral 10 refers, in general, to a vibrating screen separator assembly that includes a frame, or bed, 12 that includes a bottom wall 14 having an opening 16, a pair of side walls, 18 and 20, an end wall 22, and a cross support member 24 coupled between the side walls. An actuator 26 for imparting motion to the frame 12 is coupled to the support member 24 that includes a housing 28 that is coupled to the support member that supports and is coupled to a rotary motor 30 having a rotary shaft 32 having opposite ends that extend out of the housing. A pair of substantially identical unbalanced weights, 34 and 36, are coupled to the opposite ends of the rotary shaft 30.<br>
Actuators, 38 and 40, respectively, for imparting motion to the frame 12 are also coupled to the support member 24 that include housings, 42 and 44, respectively, that are coupled to the support member that support and are coupled to rotary motors, 46 and 48, respectively, having rotary shafts, 50 and 52, respectively, having opposite ends that extend out of the housings. Pairs of substantially identical unbalanced weights, 54 and 56 and 58 and 60, respectively, are coupled to the opposite ends of the rotary shafts, 50 and 52, respectively. In an exemplary embodiment, the rotary shafts, 50 and 52, are substantially parallel and perpendicular to a common plane, and the size, shape and mass of the unbalanced weights, 54, 56, 58, and 60 are substantially identical.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the rotary shaft 32 is perpendicular to a different plane than the rotary shafts, 50 and 52.<br>
The rotary motors, 30, 46 and 48, are operably coupled to a controller 62 that provides motive power and controls the operation of the rotary motors. A screen 64 is received within the frame 12 and is adapted to be rigidly coupled to the bottom wall 14 using conventional mechanical fasteners.<br>
During operation of the assembly 10, as illustrated in Fig. 2, the controller 62 may implement a motion control program 100 in which a user may initiate operation of the assembly in step 102. The user may then select linear or elliptical movement to be imparted to the frame 12 of the assembly 10 in step 104.<br>
If the user selects linear motion in step 104, then the controller may operate the actuators, 38 and 40, for imparting motion to the frame 12 in step 106. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, during operation of the actuators, 38 and 40, for imparting motion to the frame 12, theaunbalanced weights, 54 and 58, are rotated by the motors, 46 and 48, respectively, about axes of rotation, 108a and 108b, respectively, in opposite directions, 108c and 108d, respectively, at substantially the same rotational speed with the rotational positions of the centers of mass, 108e and 108f, substantially mirror images of one another. The rotation of the unbalanced weights, 54 and 58, about the axes of rotation, 108a and 108b, produces centrifugal forces, 108g and 108h, respectively, that are directed from the centers of mass, 108e and 108f, respectively, of the unbalanced weights, 54 and 58, respectively, in the directions normal to the vectors from the centers of rotation to the corresponding centers of mass.<br>
The resulting centrifugal forces, 108g and 108h, created during the rotation of the rotation of the unbalanced weights, 54 and 58, about the axes of rotation, 108a and 108b, impart a reciprocal linear motion to the frame 12 of the assembly 10. In particular, as illustrated in Fig. 3b, the centrifugal forces, 108g and 108h, include horizontal components, 108gx and 108hx, respectively, and vertical components, 108gy and 108hy, respectively. Because, the direction and speed of rotation of the unbalanced weights, 54 and 58, are opposite and equal, the horizontal components, 108gx and 108hx, cancel each other out. As a result, the only forces acting on the<br>
frame 12 of the assembly due to the rotation of the unbalanced weights, 54 and 58, about the axes of rotation, 108a and 108b, are the sum of the vertical forces, 108gy and 108hy. Since the vertical forces, 108gy and 108hy, vary from a positive maximum vertical force to a negative maximum vertical force during the rotation of the unbalanced weights, 54 and 58, about the axes of rotation, 108a and 108b, the resulting linear motion imparted to the frame 12 of the assembly is a reciprocating linear motion. Thus, the combination of the actuators, 38 and 40, provides an actuator for imparting linear motion to the frame 12 of the assembly. In an exemplary embodiment, during operation, the rotational positions and centrifugal forces created during the rotation of the unbalanced weights, 54 and 56 and 58 and 60, about the axes of rotation, 108a and 108b, respectively, are substantially identical.<br>
If the user selects elliptical motion in step 104, then the controller may simultaneously operate the actuator 26 for imparting motion to the frame 12 and the actuators, 38 and 40, for imparting motion to the frame in step 108.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 4, during operation of the actuator 26 for imparting motion to the frame 12, the unbalanced weight is rotated by the motor 30 about an axis of rotation 106a. The rotation of the unbalanced weight 34 about the axis of rotation 106a produces a centrifugal force 106b that is directed from the center of mass 106c of the unbalanced weight 34 in the direction normal to the vector from the center of rotation to the center of mass. In an exemplary embodiment, during step 108, the rotational positions, speeds, and centrifugal forces created during the rotation of the unbalanced weights, 34 and 36, about the axis of rotation 106c are substantially identical. The resulting centrifugal forces created during the rotation of the rotation of the unbalanced weights, 34 and 36, about the axis of rotation 106c would impart a circular motion to the frame 12 of the assembly 10 if the actuator 26 were operated alone.<br>
Because the rotary shaft 32 of the actuator 26 is perpendicular to a different plane than the rotary shafts, 50 and 52, of the actuators, 38 and 40, the simultaneous operation of the actuators, and the forces that are generated, as described above,<br>
results in elliptical motion being imparted to the frame 12 of the assembly 10. Thus, the combination of the actuators, 26, 38 and 40, provides an actuator for imparting elliptical motion to the frame 12.<br>
If the user elects to discontinue the operation of the program 100 in step 110, then the operation of the program ends in step 112.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, during the operation of the assembly 10 using the motion control program 100, fluidic material including solid particles is injected onto the screen 64. In an exemplary embodiment, the injection of the fluidic material onto the screen 64 is provided substantially as described in U.S. patent application serial<br>
number	, attorney docket number 20773.35, filed on Apr., I 18.2001 the<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In this manner, the separation of solid particles from the liquids within the fluidic material is enhanced by the motion imparted to the frame 12 and screen 64. In an exemplary embodiment, movement of the frame 12 and screen 64 along an elliptical path maintains solid particles on the screen for a longer period of time thereby permitting more liquids to be extracted from the fluidic material thereby providing a drier solid particle discard.<br>
The present embodiments of the invention provide a number of advantages. For example, the ability to operate in a linear or an elliptical mode of operation without physical restructuring or mechanical reconfiguration of the assembly provides an efficient, reliable, and cost-effective system for providing both modes of operation.<br>
It is understood that variations may be made in the foregoing without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the actuators, 26, 38 and 40, for imparting motion to the frame 12 of the assembly 10 may include one or more unbalanced weights.<br>
Although illustrative embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, a wide range of modification, changes and substitution is contemplated in the foregoing disclosure. In some instances, some features of the present invention may be employed without a corresponding use of the other features. Accordingly, it is<br>
appropriate that the appended claims be construed broadly and in a manner consistent with the scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
