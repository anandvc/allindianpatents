JAMMER DETECTION AND SUPPRESSION FOR WIRELESS COMMUNICATION<br>
[0001] The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application No. 60/870,236 entitled "JAMMER FOR BROADCAST OFDM" filed December 15, 2006, this application also claims priority to Provisional Application No. 60/885,370, entitled "JAMMER DETECTION AND REMOVAL TECI-TNIQUES" filed January 17, 2007 and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates generally to communication, and more specifically to techniques for detecting and suppressing jammers.<br>
Background<br>
[0003J Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various communication services such as broadcast, voice, video, packet data, messaging, etc. These wireless systems include broadcast systems, cellular systems, etc. A wireless system may operate in an environment where jammers may be present. Jammers are large amplitude undesired signals within the same frequency channel as a desired signal. The jammers may correspond to strong naircwband frequency components (e.g., for color carrier, sound carrier, etc.) from an interfering source or intermodulation distortion generated by a receiver. The jammers may cause various deleterious effects such as failure to detect and acquire a signal from a desired system, degradation in decoding performance, etc.<br>
[0004] There is therefore a need in the art for techniques to detect and mitigate jammers.<br>
 <br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] Techniques for detecting and suppressing jammers are described herein. A receiver may detect for jammers by transforming a time-domain input signal to the frequency domain with a fast Fourier transform (FFT) and detecting for jammers based on the frequency-domain signal. Detection for jammers in the frequency domain is referred to as post-FFT jammer detection. The receiver may suppress detected jammers by (i) filtering the input signal, which is referred to as pre-FFT jammer suppression, and/or (ii) modifying the frequency-domain signal, which is referred to as post-FFT jammer suppression.<br>
[0006] In one aspect, the receiver may perform post-FFT jammer detection and pre-FFT jammer suppression. The receiver may transform the input signal (e.g., with FFT) to obtain the frequency-domain signal and may detect for jammers in the input signal based on the frequency-domain signal. The receiver may determine powers of a plurality of carriers based on the frequency-domain signal and may detect for jammers based on peaks in the powers of these carriers. The receiver may filter the input signal (e.g., vAxh a notch filter) to suppress the detected jammers. The receiver may perfonn jammer detection prior to each time-sliced data burst to be demodulated and may perform jammer suppression during the data burst.<br>
[0007] In another aspect, the receiver may perform post-FFT jammer detection and post-FFT jammer suppression. The receiver may delennine data power and channel power for each of the plurality of carriers and may declare jammer on each carrier in which the data power is sufficiently larger than the channel power. TThe receiver may modify (e.g., zero out or reduce) the frequency-domain signal on carriers with detected jammers.<br>
[0008] Various aspects and features of the disclosure are described in further detail below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0019] The techniques described herein may be used for various wireless communication systems and networks such as broadcast systems, cellular systems, wireless wide area networks fWWANs), wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs), wireless local area networks (WLANs), etc. The terms "system" and "network"" are olten used interchangeably. These systems and networks may utilize orthogonal frequency division multip!e.xing (OFDM), single-carrier frequency division muhiplexing (SC-FDM), or some other multiplexing schemes. OFDM and SC-FDM partition the system bandwidth into multiple orthogonal carriers, which may also be referred to as subcarriers, tones, bins, etc. Each carrier may be modulated with data. In general, modulation symbols are sent in the frequency domain with OFDM and in the time domain with SC-FDM.<br>
(0020] The techniques may be used for systems that implement radio technologies such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) defined by an organization named "3rd Generation Partnership Project" {3GPP), Flash-OFDM® from Flarion Technologies, Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB) from Qualcomm Incorporated, IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.16 and IEEE 802.20 from The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), etc. IEEE 802.11 is commonly referred to as Wi-Fi, and IEEE 802.16 is commonly referred to as WiMAX. The techniques may also be used for broadcast systems that implement Digital Video Broadcasting for Handhelds (DVB-H), Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting for Terrestrial Television Broadcasting (ISDB-T), MediaFLO, etc. DVB-H, ISDB-T, and MediaFLO support digital transmission of multimedia over a terrestrial communication network.   DVB-H is described in ETSI EN 300 304, entitled "Digital<br>
 <br>
Video Broadcasting (DVB); Transmission System for Handheld Terminals (DVB-H),"<br>
and ETSI EN 300 744, entitled "Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Framing structure, channel coding and modulation for digital terrestrial television," both dated November 2004. ISDB-T is described in ARIB STD-B3I, entitled "Transmission System for Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting," July 2003. These documents are publicly available. For clarity, certain aspects of the techniques are described below for broadcast systems.<br>
[0021] FIG. 1 shows a wireless device 150 capable of receiving a signal from a digital broadcast system 100. Wireless device 150 may be a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a terminal, a wireless modem, a handheld device, a laptop computer, etc. Broadcast system 100 may implement DVB-H, ISDB-T, MediaFLO, etc. System 100 may include any number of broadcast stations. For simplicity, only one broadcast station 102 is shown in FIG. 1.<br>
[00221 An analog broadcast system 110 and/or a wireless system 120 may also be deployed near the same geographic area as digital broadcast system 100. Broadcast system 110 may be an analog television (TV) broadcast system, a radio broadcast system, or some other analog terrestrial broadcast system. Wireless system 120 may be an analog cellular system or some other system. Systems 110 and/or 120 may transmit signals within or near a frequency channel used by broadcast system 100. The signals froin systems 110 and/or 120 may have frequency components that may be much larger in amplitude than the signal from system 100 and may thus act as jammers to the signal from system 100.<br>
[0023] FIG. 2A shows an example power spectral density (PSD) or spectrum of an analog TV signal that may be transmitted by analog broadcast system 110 in FIG. 1. The analog TV signal may be generated based on Phase Alternating Line (PAL), National Television System Committee (NTSC), or Sequential Color with Memory (SECAM). PAL, NTSC, and SECAM are analog video standards commonly used throughout the world. The PSD of the analog TV signal may have strong narrowband frequency components. In the example shown in FIG. 2A, the PSD is for a PAL TV signal and includes a strong peak near -2.8 MHz for a color/vision carrier, a strong peak near 1.7 MHz for a sound carrier, and a strong peak near 3.2 MHz for Near Instantaneous Companded Audio Multiplex (NICAM) digital audio.  The power of the<br>
 <br>
PAL TV signal may be concentrated in the color carrier, which may be 30 decibels (dB) or higher than much of the PSD for the PAL TV signal.<br>
[0024] FIG. 2B shows an example PSD of a digital broadcast signal from digital broadcast system 100 with an interfering PAL TV signal from analog broadcast system 110. The digital broadcast signal may have a relatively flat spectrum due to the manner in which the signal is generated. The narrowband peaks in the PAL TV signal may be much larger in amplitude and may act as jammers to the digital broadcast signal. FIG. 2B shows jammers from a single PAL TV signal. In general, jammers may come from any number of interfering sources/signals and may be located at any frequencies. [0025J Jammers may degrade performance in several manners when receiving the digital broadcast signal from system 100. First, the jammers act as noise that may degrade decoding performance. This may result in higher bit error rate (BER), packet error rate (PER), frame error rate (FER), etc. Second, the jammers may hamper detection and acquisition of the digital broadcast signal and adversely impact synchronization performance. DVB-H, ISDB-T, and MediaFLO utilize OFDM. Each OFDM symbol includes a useful portion and a guard interva), which is a copy of a fraction of the useful portion. Many detection and acquisition schemes perform correlation between the guard interval and the corresponding useful portion in order to detect and acquire the digital broadcast signal. Guard-based correlation schemes are also commonly used for coarse time acquisition, coarse frequency acquisition, fine frequency tracking, etc. An analog TV signal typically contains a continuous wave (CWJ for a color carrier that may be transmitted at up to 73% of the total signal power. The analog TV signal has a strong effect on the guard-based correlation schemes because the CW signal is highly correlated vviih a delayed version of itself. The analog TV signal may thus degrade the performance of the guard-based correlation schemes, possibly to the point of failure.<br>
[0026] Jammers may be detected and suppressed based on the techniques described herein. In one aspect, jammers may be detected after performing an FFT or a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) on an input signal (or post-FFT), and the detected jammers may be suppressed by filtering the input signal prior to the FFT (or pre-FFT). In another aspect, jammers may be detected post-FFT, and the detected jammers may be<br>
 <br>
suppressed post-FFT.   For clarity, the techniques are described below for a broadcast system that implements DVB-H.<br>
[0027] FIG. 3A shows a time slice structure 300 supported by DVB-H. One or more (Q) programs may be sent in a DVB-H signal. Each program may be sent as data bursts in short time intervals. Each data burst may contain up to two megabits of data and parity and may also carry a delta time to the start of the next data burst for the same program. A DVB-H receiver may (um on for short periods of time to receive the data bursts for each program of interest and may turn off during the remaining time to reduce power consumption. For example, if ten programs are sent in equal time intervals, then the DVB-H receiver may receive one program in 10% of the time and may turn off and achieve power saving for up to 90% of the time. In general, the Q programs may be sent in any order within the: DVB-H signal, each program may be sent at any rate, and each data burst may have any duration.<br>
[0028] DVB-H supports three modes of operation for FFT sizes of 2K, 4K and 8K. Table 1 lists some parameters for DVB-H and provides their values for the three operating modes. In Table 1. parameters N, K, D and P are given for one OFDM symbol and are dependent on the operating mode. The carrier spacing in Tabic I is for 8 MHz channel. DVB-H may be configured for 5, 6, 7, or 8 MHz channel, each of which is associated with different carrier spacing.<br>

10029]        FIG. 3B shows a carrier structure 310 for DVB-H.    The overall system bandwidth of BW MHz is partitioned into multiple (K) carriers that are given indices of<br>
 <br>
0 through K-1, where K is dependent on the operating mode and given in Table 1. The spacing between carriers is BW/K MHz.<br>
[0030] FIG. 3B also shows a pilot structure for DVB-H. A continual pilot is sent in each OFDM symbol period on C carriers that are distributed across the K total carriers, where C is dependent on the operating mode. These C carriers include carriers 0, 48, 54, etc., which are given in ETSI EN 300 744. A scattered pilot is sent on one of four interlaces in each OFDM symbol period. Each interlace contains approximately K/12 carriers that are uniformly spaced apart by 12 carriers. Interlace m, for ;« e {0,1,2,3}, contains carriers 3m, 3;w +12, 3m + 24, etc.<br>
[0031] The transmission timeline for DVB-H is partitioned into frames, with each frame including 68 OFDM symbols thai are given indices of 0 through 67. The scattered pilot is sent on interlace m = {n mod 4) in OFDM symbol period n, for 0 = 0,...,67, where "mod" denotes a modulo operation. The scattered pilot cycles through the four interlaces in each 4-symbol interval.<br>
[0032] FIG. 4 shows a block diagram of a transmitter 410 and a receiver 450 in a DVB-H broadcast system. Transmitter 410 may be part of broadcast station 102 in FIG. 1, and receiver 450 may be part of wireless device 150 in FIG. 1.<br>
[0033] At transmitter 410, a transmit (TX) data processor 420 processes (e.g., formats, encodes, interleaves, and symbol maps) data and generates data symbols. As used herein, a data symbol is a symbol for data, a pilot symbol is a symbol for pilot, a zero symbol is a signal value of zero, and a symbol is typically a complex value. The data symbols and pilot symbols may be modulation symbols from a modulation scheme such as PSK or QAM. Pilot is data that is known a priori by both the transmitter and the receiver.<br>
[0034] An OFDM modulator 430 receives the data and pilot symbols, maps the data symbols to data cells and maps the pilot symbols to pilot cells. A data cell is a cell used to send data, a pilot cell is a cell used to send pilot, and a cell is one carrier in one symbol period and may be used to send one modulation symbol. A given carrier may serve as a data cell in one OFDM symbol period and as a pilot cell in another OFDM symbol period. An OFDM symbol period is the duration of one OFDM symbol and is also referred to as a symbol period. OFDM modulator 430 obtains K output symbols for the K total carriers in each symbol period.   Each output symbol may be a data<br>
 <br>
symbo!, a pilot symbol, or a zero symbol. OFDM modulator 430 transforms the K output symbols for each symbol period with an inverse FFT (IFFT) or an inverse DFT (IDFT) to obtain a useful portion containing K time-domain chips. OFDM modulator 430 then copies the last G chips of the useful portion and appends these G chips to the front of the useful portion to form an OFDM symbol containing K + G chips. The repeated portion is referred to as a guard interval or a cyclic prefix and is used to combat intersymbol interference (ISI) caused by frequency selective fading. OFDM modulator 430 provides an OFDM symbol in each symbol period. A transmitter unit (TMTR) 432 receives and processes (e.g., converts to analog, amplifies, filters, and ■ frequency upconverts) the OFDM symbols and generates a modulated signal, which is transmitted via an antenna 434.<br>
. [0035] At receiver 450, an antenna 452 receives the modulated signal from transmitter 410 and provides a received signal. A receiver unit (RCVR) 454 conditions (e.g., filters, amplifies, frequency downconverts, and digitizes) the received signal and provides input samples. An OFDM demodulator (Demod) 460 processes the input samples as described below to obtain K received symbols for the K total carriers in each symbol period. OFDM demodulator 460 derives channel gain estimates based on received pilot symbols, performs data demodulation on received data symbols whh the channel gain estimates, and provides data symbo! estimates. A receive (RX) data processor 470 then processes (e.g., deinterleaves and decodes) the data symbol estimates and provides decoded data. In general, the processing by OFDM demodulator 460 and RX data processor 470 is complementary to the processing by OFDM modulator 430 and TX data processor 420, respectively, at transmitter 410. [0036] Controllers/processors 440 and 480 control the operation of various processing units at transmitter 410 and receiver 450, respectively. Memories 442 and 482 store data and program codes for transmitter 410 and receiver 450, respectively. [0037] In one aspect, receiver 450 may perform post-FFT jammer detection and pre-FFT jammer suppression. Receiver 450 may perform post-FFT jammer detection before each data burst to be demodulated, without having to achieve time synchronization. This is possible because the color and audio carriers in an analog TV signal are continuous and appear as peaks in the FFT output even without time synchronization.<br>
 <br>
[00381 P"or to each data burst to be demodulated, receiver 450 may perform warm up and allow circuit blocks such as a low noise amplifier (LNA), analog and digital variable gain amplifiers (VGAs), a direct current (DC) loop, and an automatic gain control (AGC) loop to settle. Receiver 450 may then perform jammer detection before starting time synchronization.<br>
|0039] For jammer detection, receiver 450 may capture M received OFDM symbols in M symbol periods, where in general M &gt; 1. Receiver 450 may transform each received OFDM symbol with an FFT to obtain K received symbols for K total carriers, where K is dependent on the operating mode. The FFTs for the M received OFDM symbols may be performed based on an extended FFT mode having higher dynamic range for the received symbols than a normal FFT mode used during data demodulation. The extended FFT mode may use higher rounding between FFT stages, which may result in more truncation of the observed signal and hence shift the dynamic range of the frequency-domain symbols up, thereby leaving only few least significant bits (LSBs) occupied by the desired signal in case no jammers are present.<br>
[0040] Receiver 450 may compute the power of each received symbol and average the power across the M symbol periods for each carrier, as follows:<br>
Pn(k,n)^a,-\R{k,f,)\'+{\-a,)-P,ik,n-\) ,	Eq(l)<br>
where   R(k, n) is a complex received symbol on carrier k in symbol period n,<br>
\R(k,n)\' is the power of the received symbol on carrier A in symbol period n, Pif(k,n) is an average power for carrier k in symbol period n, and ar„ is a coefficient that detennines the amount of averaging.<br>
[0041] Equation (1) shows filtering based on an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter. Coefficient «;j may range from 0.0 to 1.0, with a small value of a^ corresponding to more averaging and a large value of cf„ corresponding to less averaging. The filtering may also be performed based on a finite impulse response (FIR) filter or some other type of filter.<br>
[0042] After filtering the power of the received symbols for all M symbol periods, receiver 450 may search for peaks among the K filtered values for the K total carriers.<br>
 <br>
Receiver 450 may compare the filtered value for each peak against a detection threshold and may declare the presence of a jammer at that peak location if (he filtered value exceeds the detection threshold, as follows:<br>
If Ppik,n) &gt; Fjjj then declare jammer on carrier k,	Eq (2)<br>
Else declare no jammer on carrier jfc,<br>
where PTH is the detection threshold. PTH may be an absolute value, a predetermined offset above an average power for all K. total carriers, etc.<br>
[0043] In one design, the frequency of each detected jammer is determined by the carrier index k for the corresponding peak. In this design, the resolution of the detected jammer fiequency is determined by the FFT bin or carrier spacing, which is dependent on the operating mode. In another design, one or more (e.g., two) shoulder values arc identified for each peak detected above the detection threshold. The peak and shoulder values as well as their carrier indices may be interpolated to obtain a detected jammer frequency with resolution better than the FFT bin spacing.<br>
[0044] The interpolation may be based on various schemes. In one scheme, lineai-interpolation may be performed on a peak value and two shoulder values for two FFT bins adjacent to the peak. If the jammer frequency is at the center of the FFT bin of the peak, then the two shoulder values will be equal. However, if the jammer frequency is between the peak FFT bin and either the left or right shoulder FFT bin, then tlie left shoulder value will not be equal to the right shoulder value. A theoretical ratio of the two shoulder values may be detemiined for different frequency offsets from the peak FFT bin center and should resemble a sync function. An actual ratio of the left to right shoulder values may be determined and used to estimate the jammer frequency offset from the peak FFT bin center. In another scheme, Lagrange interpolation is used to determine the jammer frequency.<br>
[0045] For any inteipolation scheme, the frequency of each detected jammer may be determined by the whole carrier index k for the corresponding peak and a fi-actional value from the interpolation. Jammer frequency with resolution better than FFT bin spacing may be obtained with interpolation.    For both designs noted above, the<br>
 <br>
frequency of each detected jammer may be represented by an exponential value determined by the whole carrier index k and possibly Ihe fractional value. [0046] Receiver 450 may perform pre-FFT jammer suppression for all detected jammers using various types of filter commonly available in a receiver. In one design, receiver 450 performs jammer suppression using a narrowband notch filter that is commonly employed in a DC loop. The DC loop typically performs DC offset correction using the notch filter, which is tuned to zero frequency. This notch filter or a copy of this notch filter may be used to suppress the detected jammers. To suppress one detected jammer, receiver 450 may downconvert (i.e., frequency translate or rotate) the input samples by the detected jammer frequency, filter the downconverted samples with the notch filter, and upconvert the filtered samples by the detected jammer frequency. The downconversion may be achieved with simple rotation of the input samples before the notch filter, and the upconversion may be achieved with rotation back by the same amount after ihe notch filter. To suppress multiple detected jammers, receiver 450 may rotate the input samples by a first detected jammer frequency, then filler the samples with the notch filter, then rotate the samples to a second detected jaminer frequency, then filter the samples with the notch filter, and so on, and finally rotate the samples back to the origina/ frequency.<br>
[0047] In another design, receiver 450 performs jammer suppression using a narrowband notch filter that is tuned to each detected jammer frequency. For this design, a rotator/multiplier may be used to tune the notch filter to any desired frequency. To suppress one detected jammer, the notch filter may be tuned to the detected jammer frequency and used to filter the input samples. To suppress multiple detected jammers, the notch filter may be tuned to a first detected jammer frequency, then used to fiher the input samples, then tuned to a second detected jammer frequency, then used to filter the samples, etc. In this design, the input samples are not rotated.<br>
[0048] In general, any number of notch fihers may be used for jammer suppression, and each notch filter may be used to suppress any number of detected jammers. The input samples may be passed through all of the notch filters, which may be coupled in cascade or some other configuration.<br>
[0049] Receiver 450 may perform Jammer detection prior to each data burst and may enable or disable the notch filter(s) for jammer suppression depending on whether<br>
 <br>
on not jammers are detected. In one design, a decision to enable or disable jammer suppression may be made independently for each data burst based on jammer detection results for that data burst. In another design, the decision to enable or disable jammer suppression may be made based on the jammer detection results for the current data burst and information for prior data bursts. For example, the notch filter(s) may be enabled for several data bursts after jammers are detected. This may allows for better probability of detection of jammer detection since the presence of jammers may be a relatively static condition in a broadcast environment. Variations of a wireless channel due to movements and multipath (of both the DVB-H signal and jammers) may affect jammer detection performance, but may be more dynamic and change in time faster around an average jammer power within the frequency charmel.<br>
(0050] Jammer detection may be performed prior to synchronization to detect for jammers and determine the frequency and possibly the level of each detected jammer. One or more notch filters may then be used to suppress all detected jammers. Synchronization tasks may be performed while the notch fiher{s) are active, and any bias resulting from the presence of jammers may be removed. The suppression of jammers prior to performing synchronization may improve detection and acquishion performance as well as demodulation performance. Performing jammer detection prior to synchronization may also alleviate hardware requirements. Much of the hardware processing capability may be available for jamm.er detection prior to synchronization and may be used for data demodulation after synchronization.<br>
[OOSl] In another aspect, receiver 450 may perform post-FFT jammer detection and post-FFT jammer suppression. Receiver 450 may perform post-FFT jammer detection before and/or during reception of data bursts to determine carriers with jammers. These jammers may be due to analog TV signals and may fall inband, as described above. Receiver 450 may then zero out or reduce the carriers with jammers to suppress these inband jammers. Any number of carriers and any set of carriers with jammers may be easily zeroed out or reduced.<br>
[0052| For jammer detection, receiver 450 may transform each received OFDM symbol with an FFT to obtain K received symbols for the K total carriers. The FFT may be performed based on the normal FFT mode used during data demodulation. In one design, jammer detection may be performed for each carrier based on data power<br>
 <br>
and charmel power for that carrier.   For this design, receiver 450 may derive channel<br>
gain estimates for the K total carriers based on received pilot symbols from the pilot<br>
cells.<br>
(0053]       Receiver 450 may compute the data power for each carrier k, as follows:<br>
i^<br>
Po{k,n) = a^-\D{Kn)\^+{\-aa)-P^{k,n-\),	Eq (3)<br>
where   D{k,n) is a complex received data symbol on carrier k in symbol period n, Pu{k,n) is the data power for carrier k in symbol period n, and a I-, is a coefficient that determines the amount of averaging for the data power.<br>
[0054]        Receiver 450 may compute the channel power for each carrier k, as follows:<br>
PAk,n) = a^-\H(k,n)\^+0-a,)-P„(k,n-\) ,	Eq (4)<br>
where   H(k. n) is a complex channel gain estimate for earner k m symbol pmod «, P,; (k, n) is the channel power for carrier k in symbol period n, and Off is a coefficient that determines the amount of averaging for the channel power.<br>
[0055] The channel gain estimates H{k,n) may be derived based on the received pilot symbols from the pilot cells. In each symbol period, initial channel gain estimates may be derived based on the received pilot symbols from the pilot cells in that symbol period. The initial channel gain estimates for pilot cells in one or more symbol periods may be processed (e.g., interpolated) to obtain the channel gain estimates for the K total carriers in each symbol period.<br>
[0056] The IIR fi!ters!in equations (3) and (4) time average the data power and charmel power, respectively. The filtering improves jammer'defection performance since a carrier with jammer may have lovi/ power some of the time and higher power some other time, depending on whether the signal and jammer combine constructively or destructively. However, over time, a carrier with jammer will have higher than average power. Coefficients a„ and a„ may range from 0.0 to 1.0 ^nd may be selected to achieve the desired amount of averaging. Coefficient or,, may or may not be equal to coefficient a^ .<br>
 <br>
060769<br>
10057] For each carrier k, the data power may be compared to the channel power. A jammer may be declared on carrier k if the data power is sufficiently higher than the channel power, as follows:<br>
If P^{k,n)&gt; (3^ ■P^{k,n) then declare jammer on carrier ^,	Eq (5)<br>
Else declare no jammer on carrier k,<br>
where fi„ is a threshold multiplier for the channel power.   /9^ may be selected based on computer simulation, empirical measurements, field testing, etc.   For example, /9„ may be set to 5/3 (which is approximately 4.5 dB) or some other value. [0058]       Jn another design, jammer detection may be performed for each -carrier based on data power and noise power for that carrier.    For this design, receiver 450 may estimate the noise for each carrier k, as follows:<br>
N(k,n) = I D(k,n) - D{kji)\- ,	Eq (6)<br>
where   D(k,n) is a hard decision for carrier k in symbol period n, and N{k,ri) is the noise for carrier A: in symbol period rt.        &gt;<br>
The noise N{k,n) may also be estimated in other manners.<br>
|0059]        Receiver -450 may filter the noise for each carrier k, as follows:<br>
P^(k,n) = a,.-Nik,n)-i-(]-a^)-P^{k,n-\) ,	Eq (7)<br>
where  P^j (k, n) is the noise power for carrier k in symbol period n, and<br>
a^j is a coefficient that determines the amount of averaging for the noise power.<br>
[0060] For each carrier t, the data power may be compared to the noise power. A jammer may be declared on carrier k if the data power is sufficiently higher than the noise power, as follows:<br>
If P^{k,n)&gt; I3_^ ■ Pfj(k,n) then declare jammer on carrier A,	Eq (8)<br>
Else declare no jammer on carrier k.<br>
 <br>
where P^ is a threshold multiplier for the noise power,   fi^ may be selected based on<br>
computer simulation, empirical measurements, field testing, etc.<br>
(0061] In other designs, the data power for each carrier may be compared to a scaled average power for the K total carriers, a predetermined value, or some other value. In general, a threshold value may be determined for each carrier (e.g., /?„ ■Pij{k,n) or Pfj ■ P^.(k,n)), for each set of carriers, or for all K total carriers.<br>
[0062] For jammer suppression, each earner with detected jammer may be modified in various manners. In one design, each carrier with jammer may be zeroed out by replacing the received data symbol for that can-ier with a zero symbol (or simply, zero). Data demodulation may then be performed on the received data symbols for carriers without jammers and zero symbols for carriers with jammers. For example, log likelihood ratios (LLRs) may be computed for the code bits of each syinbol. The LLR for each code bit indicates the likelihood of that code bit being T or "0". The LLRs for the code bits for carriers with jammers may be set to zero to indicate equal likelihood of (hese code bits being T or '0'. The code bits with LLRs of zero may be given no weight in the decoding process, which may prevent jammers from degrading decoding performance. In another design, the LLRs for each carrier with jammer may be reduced (instead of setJo zero) to indicate less certainty in the '0' or '1' values conveyed by these LLRs.<br>
|0063] In one design, jammer detection and suppression may be performed for each of the D data carriers in each symbol period. The data caiTiers may change from symbol period to s&gt;TnboI period, as shown in FIG. 3B. In each symbol period, the data power and channel power may be updated for each of the K total earners, as described above. However, jammer detection and suppression may be perfomied for the D data can'iers and omitted for the P pilot carriers.<br>
[0064] In another design, jammer detection and suppression may be performed for up to L carriers, where L may be a fixed value and may be equal to 512, 1024, 2048, or some other value. For example, if L = 2048, then jammer detection and suppression may be performed for all carriers in DVB mode 1 and ISDB-T modes 1, 2, and 3 since all of these modes have less than 2048 carriers. In DVB modes 2 and 3, jammer detection and suppression may be performed for a subset of the K. total carriers if<br>
 <br>
060769<br>
L=2048.   The L carriers may be distributed across the K total carriers or may be concentrated in regions where jammers are more likely to be present.  This design may ■ be used to reduce memory and power requirements.<br>
[0065] In yet another design, jammer detection and suppression may be selectively performed for different frequency regions. The K total carriers may be partitioned into multiple (e.g., 16) regions. Each region may correspond to a set of contiguous carriers. Jammer detection and suppression may be enabled or disabled for each region. For ' example, jammer detection and suppression may be enabled for regions in which jammers are more likely to be present (e.g., regions covering color and audio carriers) and may be disabled for regions in which jammers are less likely or unlikely to be present.<br>
[0066] Setting a carrier to zero effectively removes jammer as well as desired signal on tha: carrier. The effect of zeroing out carriers with jammers may be dependent on a code rale used by transmitter 410 for the data bursts received by receiver 450. A higher code raie generates less redundancy in the transmitted data, and zeroing out carriers ■ with jammers may have more impact on decoding performance. The converse may be true for a lower code rate.<br>
[0067] In general, jammer detection and suppression may be perfonned in various manners and based on various factors. ]n one design, jammer detection and suppression may be enabled and performed whenever receiving data, regardless of the code rate. In another design, jammer detection and suppression may be enabled foi- a predetermined code rate or lower, or when immners are detected prior to synchronization, or based on some other condition or criteria, and may be disabled otherwise. In yet another design, jammer detection may be dependent on code rate and/or other factors. For example, a larger threshold multiplier /?^ or /?^ may be used for a higher code rate so that only jammers with larger amplitude are zeroed out, which may reduce impact due to zeroing out of the desired signal.<br>
[0068] Receiver 450 may perform post-FFT jammer detection and pre-FFT jammer suppression, which is referred to as a first jammer detection and suppression scheme. Alternatively or additionally, receiver 450 may perform post-FFT jammer detection and post-FFT jammer suppression, which is referred to as a second jammer detection and suppression scheme.   The first scheme may improve signal detection and acquisition<br>
 <br>
perfonnance as well as demodulation performance. The second scheme may be able to detect and suppress jammers at any number of carriers and any of the carriers and may improve demodulation performance. The first and second schemes may be performed independently of one another, so that either scheme or both schemes may be performed. [0069] FIG. 5 shows a block diagram of a design of OFDM demodulator 460 at receiver 450 in FIG. 4. Within OFDM demodulator 460, a. unit 5X0 may perform DC offset removal and pre-FFT jammer suppression on the input samples, as described below. A pre-processor 512 processes the samples from unit 510 and provides received samples. Pre-processor 512 may perform AGC, timing acquisition, filtering, sample rate conversion, frequency error estimation and removal, and/or other fiinctions. A synchronization (Sync) unit 514 performs time synchronization and generates an FFT window that indicates which samples to process for each received OFDM symbol. [00701 ^ 'Ji'^ 516 removes the guard ;nter\'al in each received OFDM symbol based on the FFT window from unit 514 and provides K received samples for that OFDM symbol. A serial-io-parallel convf.rte;- (S/P) 518 provides the K recei\*ed samples for each received OFDM s3'mbo] in paraWel. A unit 520 perfojTris an FFT/DFT on the K received samples to obtain K frequency-domain received symbols for the K total carriers. Unit 520 provides received pilot symbols from the P pilot carriers to a channel estimator 522, received data symbols from, the D data carriers to a zero replacement unit 526, and received symbols from the K total can-iers to a jammer detector 524. Channel estimator 522 derives channel gain estimates for the K total earners based on the received pilot symbols.<br>
[00711 For the first jammer detection and suppression scheme, jammer detector 524 may perform post-FFT jammer detection by (i) filtering the power of the received symbols for each carrier, e.g., as shown in equation (1), and (ii) comparing the power for each carrier against a deleclion Ihreshold, e.g., as shown in equation (2). Jammer detector 524 may also determine the frequency of each detected jammer, which may be used for pre-FFT filtering to suppress the detected jammer.<br>
[0072| For the second jammer detection and suppression scheme, jammer detector 524 may perform post-FFT jammer detection by (i) detemiining the data power and chamiel power for each carrier, e.g., as shown in equations (3) and (4), and (ii) comparing the data power to a scaled channel power, e.g., as shown in equation (5).<br>
 <br>
Jammer detector 524 may also perform jammer detection in other manners, e.g., based on the data power and noise power. Jammer detector 524 may provide the carriers with detected jammers. Zero replacement unit 526 may zero out each carrier with jammer and pass each carrier without jammer.<br>
(0073] A parallel-to-serial converter (P/S) 528 serializes the K symbols in each symbol period from unit 526. A data demodulator 530 performs data demodulation/ detection on the received data symbols with the channel gain estimates and provides data symbol estimates, which may be given as LLRs or some other fonnat. Data demodulator 530 may also reduce the LLRs for carriers with jammers. [0074] FIG. 6 shows a design of DC loop/jammer filter unit 510 in FIG. 5. Within unit 510, a multiplier/rotator 610 multiplies the input samples with a complex sinusoidal at a detected jammer frequency to center the detected jammer at zero frequency. A muhiplexer (Mux) 612 selects the samples from multiplier 610 or 616 and provides the selected samples. A notch filter 614 filters the samples from multiplexer 612 to suppress the detected jammer. Multiplier 616 multiplies the filtered samples from notch fiher 524 with a complex sinusoidal at a proper frequency and provides samples with jammers suppressed. To suppress a single detected jammer, multiplier 610 may translate the detected jammer to zero frequency, and multiplier 616 may translate the filtered samples back to the original frequency, as shown in FIG. 6. To suppress multiple detected jammers, multiplier 610 may translate the first detected jammer to zero frequency, and multiplier 616 may translate the filtered samples to the next detected jammer frequency or the original frequency (not shown in FIG. 6). Pre-FFT jammer suppression may also be performed by tuning notch filler 614 to each detected jammer frequency and omitting muhipliers 610 and 616 from unit 510. [0075] FIG. 7 shows a design of a process 700 for performing jammer detection and suppression. An input signal may be transfonned (e.g., with FFT or DFT) to obtain a frequency-domain signal (block 712). The input signal may correspond to the input samples provided to unit 510 in FIG. 5. The frequency-domain signal may correspond to the received symbols from FFT/DFT unit 520 in FIG. 5. The input signal may be transformed based on a first transform mode for jammer detection and based on a second transform mode for data demodulation.   The first transform mode may have<br>
 <br>
higher dynamic range than the second transform mode and may be better able to capture jammers.<br>
[0076] Jammers in the input signal may be detected based on the irequency-domain signal (block 714), The powers of a plurality of carriers may be determined based on the frequency-domain signal. Jammers may then be detected based on peaks in the powers of the plurality of earners. For example, a jammer may be declared if a peak exceeds a threshold. The threshold may be a fixed value or a configurable value, e.g., detennined based on an average power for the plurality of carriers. The frequencies of the detected jammers may be determined based on the carriers of the peaks. Interpolation may also be performed on the peaks and their shoulders to determine the frequencies of the detected jammers. The input signal may comprise time-sliced data bursts, e.g., as shown in FIG. 3A, and jammers may be detected prior to each data burst to be demodulated.<br>
10077] The inpu: signal may be filtered to suppress the detected jammers (block 716). For one detected jammer, the input signal may be downconverted by the detected jamm.er frequency, then filtered to suppress the detected jammer, and then upconverted by the detected jammer frequency. For multiple detected jammers, the input signal may be frequency translated to center a first jammer at a designated frequency (e.g., zero frequency), then filtered to suppress the first jammer, then frequency translated to center a second jammer at the designated frequency, then filtered to suppress the second jammer, etc. Alternatively, the input signal may be filtered based on a notch filter tuned to each detected jammer frequency. Filtering of the input signal may be enabled when jammers are detected and disabled when jammers are not detected. [0078] F3G. 8 shows a design of a process 800 for performingjammer detection and suppression. An input signaJ may be transformed (e.g., with FFT or DFT) to obtain a frequency-domain signal (block 812). Jammers in the input signal may be detected based on the frequency-domain signal (block 814). In one design, data power and channel power for each of a plurality of carriers may be determined, e.g., as shown in equafions (3) and (4). Whether jammer is present on each carrier may be determined based on the data power and channel power for that carrier. For example, jammer may be declared if the data power exceeds the channel power by a predetermined amount, e.g., as shown in equation (5). In another design, data power and noise power for each<br>
 <br>
of the plurality of carriers may be determined, e.g., as shown in equations (3), (6) and (7). Whether jammer is present on each carrier may be determined based on the data power and noise power for that carrier, e.g., as shown in equation (8). Jammer detection may also be performed in other manners, e.g., by comparing the data power for each carrier against a fixed value or a configurable value, which may be a scaled average power for aJJ carriers. The frequency-domain signa] may be modified (e.g., zeroed out or reduced) on carriers with detected j ammers (block 8! 6).<br>
[0079] The techniques described herein may be implemented by various means. For example, these techniques may be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or a combination thereof For a hardware implementation, the processing units used to perform jammer detection and suppression may be implemented within one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), digital signal processors (DSPs), digital signal processing devices (DSPDs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FFGAs). processors, controllers, micro-controllers, microprocessors, electronic devices, other electronic units designed to perfomi the flmctions described herein, a comriuter, or a combination thereof [DOSO] For a firmware and/or software implementation, the techniques may be implemented with modules (e.g., procedures, functions, etc.) that perfonn the functions described herein.
