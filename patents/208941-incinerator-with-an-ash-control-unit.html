INCINERATOR WITH AN ASH CONTROL UNIT<br>
This invention rotates to an Incinerator, more particularly to an Incinerator with an ash control unit that uniformly and effectively distributes and coots ash in an ash receiving chamber of the incinerator.<br>
Conventional incinerators for combustion of hull or shell waste of agricultural crops normally include a furnace with a perforated supporting plate that defines a combustion chamber thereabove and an ash receiving chamber therebelow in the furnace. High temperature ash and unbumed particles of hull and shell waste are deposited on the supporting plate, and are stirred via a rake disposed above the supporting plate for moving the high temperature ash into the ash receiving chamber via through-holes In the supporting plate. The conventional incinerator is Disadvantageous In that the ash deposited in the ash receiving chamber is difficult to collect due to a relatively high temperature thereof and is not uniformly distributed due to blockage of some of the through-notes by the deposited ash and unbumed hull and shell waste.<br>
US Patent 5515793, discloses an incineration furnace for disposal of waste. A stirring member Is rotated and driven through the Inside of a housing by a motor. Waste is agitated and mixed between movable tubes provided on the stirring member, and by first and second fixed blades disposed in the Incinerator housing, thereby facilitating burning end incineration of the waste material.<br>
Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide an incinerator with an ash control unit that is capable of overcoming the aforesaid drawbacks associated with the prior art.<br><br>
2<br>
According to the present invention, an incinerator comprises: a furnace with a supporting plate that defines a combustion chamber thereabove and an ash receiving chamber therebelow in the furnace, the supporting plate being formed with a plurality of through-holes for passage of high temperature ash therethrough; and an ash control unit including a partitioning member that divides the ash receiving chamber into upper and lower ash chambers and that defines a vertically extending ash channel communicated with the upper and lower ash chambers, a rake that is disposed over the partitioning member within the upper ash chamber for stirring and permitting uniform distribution of the high temperature ash on the partitioning member and for moving the high temperature ash into the ash channel, and a rotary member that is disposed rotatably in and that is transverse to the ash channel and that is formed with a plurality of angularly spaced apart fins which carry the high temperature ash falling from the upper ash chamber to the lower ash chamber, thereby retarding discharge of the high temperature ash, which, in turn, cools the high temperature ash as the ash is carried from the upper ash chamber to the lower ash chamber.<br>
In drawings which illustrate an embodiment of<br>
the invention,<br><br>

Fig- 1 is a schematic side view of an incinerator embodying this invention;<br>
Fig- 2 is a partly sectional schematic side view showing an ash control unit of the incinerator of Fig. 1 ; and<br>
Fig. 3 is a fragmentary sectional schematic top view to illustrate how a rake is operated to move ash into a channel in an ash receiving chamber in the incinerator of Fig. l.<br>
Figs. 1 to 3 illustrate a preferred embodiment of an incinerator of this invention for burning raw material, such as hull and shell waste of agriculture crops.<br>
The incinerator includes: a furnace 20 with a supporting plate 26 that defines a combustion chamber 2 5 thereabove and an ash receiving chamber 21 therebelow in the furnace 20, the supporting plate 26 being formed with a plurality of through-holes 261 for passage of high temperature ash therethrough; and an ash control unit including a partitioning member 22 that divides the ash receiving chamber 21 into upper and lower ash chambers 211, 212 and that defines a vertically extending ash channel 213 communicated with the upper and lower ash chambers 211, 212, a first rake 73 that is disposed over the partitioning member 22 within the upper ash chamber 211 for stirring and permitting  uniform  distribution  of   the  high<br><br>
4<br>
temperature ash on the partitioning member 22 and for moving the high temperature ash into the ash channel 213, and a rotary member 40 that is disposed rotatably in and that is transverse to the ash channel 213 and that is formed with a plurality of angularly spaced apart fins 41 which carry the high temperature ash falling from the upper ash chamber 211 to the lower ash chamber 212, thereby retarding discharge of the high temperature ash, which, in turn, cools the high temperature ash as the ash is carried from the upper ash chamber 211 to the lower ash chamber 212. A second rake 72 is disposed rotatably over the supporting plate 26 for stirring the high temperature ash and unburned material on the supporting plate 26 and for moving  the  high  temperature  ash  through  the through-holes 261 and into the ash receiving chamber 21. A motor 43 is provided to rotate the rotary member 40. The first and second rakes 73, 72 are driven by a motor 70 via a shaft 71.<br>
A cyclone separator 30 is in fluid communication with the lower ash chamber 212 for collecting the ash therefrom. An air blower 50 is communicated with the lower ash chamber 212 for pneumatically carrying the cooled ash in the lower ash chamber 212 into the cyclone separator 30.<br>
A feeding device 10 includes a feed container and an air blower for pneumatically transporting the<br><br>
5<br>
raw material into the combustion chamber 25.<br>
With the inclusion of the ash control unit in the incinerator of this invention, the aforesaid drawbacks associated with the prior art can be eliminated.<br><br>
