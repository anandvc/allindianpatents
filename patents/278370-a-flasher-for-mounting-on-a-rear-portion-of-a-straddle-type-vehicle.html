The flasher according to the present invention is a flasher to be installed at the rear portion of a straddle type vehicle. The flasher includes a lens and a cover to be mated with the lens. The cover is mounted on the vehicle body with a leg therebetween, the leg extending along the breadthwise direction of the straddle type vehicle. The surface on which the cover is mated with the lens is slanted relative to the direction in which the leg extends so as to allow the lens to be oriented toward the rear. The lens has a smaller dimension along the breadthwise direction than that along the lengthwise direction of the vehicle.<br>
The flasher is mounted on the vehicle body with a leg therebetween, which extends along the breadthwise direction of the straddle type vehicle. The surface on which the cover is mated with the lens is slanted relative to the direction in which the leg extends so as to allow the lens to be oriented toward the rear. In addition, the lens has a smaller dimension along the breadthwise direction than that along the lengthwise direction of the vehicle. This results in improved<br>
 <br>
conspicuity of the flasher as well as the flasher being resistant to breakage in the event of the vehicle falling down.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS An embodiment according to the present invention relating to the straddle type vehicle will be described<br>
 <br>
below with reference to the drawings. In the drawings, the same numerals are used to designate a component or portion which performs the same functions. The present invention is not limited to the embodiment below. The terms "front", "rear", "left", "right", "upper", or "lower" are those as viewed from a driver when the driver is behind the wheel in the normal driving position. If necessary, the vehicle front and rear are indicated by Fr and Rr, respectively. The drawings are drawn so as to be viewed in such a manner that the numerals are oriented in the proper direction.<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 1, a straddle type vehicle 1000 is a scooter type motorcycle having a resin vehicle body cover 400 installed on the body frame (not shown) thereof. As shown in Fig. 2, the straddle type vehicle 1000 includes a tail lamp 103 and flasher 101 installed at the rear portion thereof, the rail lamp 103 mainly functioning as a brake lamp and the flasher 101 mainly functioning as a direction indicator lamp. Fig. 2 is a drawing of the straddle type vehicle 1000 as viewed from the rear thereof, where part of the vehicle is simplified for the sake of convenience, and, in particular, parts inside the vehicle body cover 400 are omitted. The external components on the vehicle body cover 400, the tail lamp 103, and the flasher 101 are<br>
 <br>
substantially mounted on the body frame (not shown) with brackets inbetween, respectively. This prevents these external components from rattling due to air flow or vibration resulting from vehicle operations, thereby ensuring required mounting strength.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the tail lamp 103 is installed on the vehicle body cover 400 at the rear portion of the vehicle. The flasher 101, provided separately from the flasher 103, is disposed on either side of the rear portion of the vehicle along the breadthwise direction. In this embodiment, a mudguard component (rear fender) 502 is disposed behind a rear wheel 501. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the flasher 101 has a leg 180 and is mounted on a base end 503 of the mudguard component 502 with the legs 180 therebetween.<br>
As shown in Figs. 4 ard 5, the flasher 101 includes a lens 120, a housing 140, a cover 160, and a leg 180.<br>
The lens 120 is molded with a transparent resin (methacryl (PMMA) for this embodiment) and has a transparent lens surface 121. The lens 120 is provided at the peripheral edge thereof with a mounting portion 124 for mounting a cover 160 and a mounting portion 123 for mounting a housing 140. The mounting portion 123 for mounting the housing 140 is provided inside of the mounting portion 124 for mounting the cover 160. The<br>
 <br>
lens 120 includes an opaque area formed between the mounting portion 124 for mounting the cover 160 and the mounting portion 123 for mounting the housing 140.<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 6, the lens 120 includes an outer wall 124 (mounting portion 124) formed at the peripheral edge thereof and an inner wall 123 (mounting portion 123) formed inside the outer wall 124. An area a, as the opaque area above, at the external portion of the outer wall 124 is coated with an opaque paint. In this embodiment, the external portion of the outer wall 124 is coated along the entirety of the peripheral edge of the lens 120 with a black paint.<br>
The housing 140 includes a bulb 250 (see Fig. 6) provided therein as a light source. In this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 4, the housing 140 is a housing (casing) where the bulb 250 is disposed, and has a substantial recess formed on the side facing the lens. The housing 140 is molded with a resin (polycarbonate for this embodiment), and has a mirror finished surface 142 formed therein and facing the lens 120, the surface 142 constituting a reflector. The housing 140 doubles as a reflector. The mirror finish may be made by, for example, metal deposition or the like. The housing 140 includes a bulb placement portion 143 in which a bulb 250 is disposed. In this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 6, the<br>
 <br>
bulb 250 is so disposed that its light emitting portion 252 is oriented toward "he lens surface 121, while a socket 251 is secured to the bulb placement portion 143. In this embodiment, the outer edge 141 of the housing 140 is placed on the mounting portion 123 (inner wall 123) formed inside the peripheral edge of the lens 120. More specifically, in this embodiment, the inner wall 123 in the lens 120 and the outer edge 141 of the housing 140 are placed in such a manner that their edges are in contact with each other. Besides, the outer edge 141 of the housing 140 is secured to the mounting portion 123 in the lens 120 by adhesion in a watertight manner.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the cover 160 is a component for covering the outside of the housing 140, and is placed on the outer wall 124 in the lens 120. As shown in Fig. 6, the outer edge 161 of the cover 160 is placed on the mounting portion 124 (outer wall 124) formed at the periphery of the lens 12C. More specifically, in this embodiment, the outer wall 124 of the lens 120 and the outer edge 161 of the cover 160 are in contact with each other. Furthermore, in this embodiment, a contact portion q where the inner wall 123 in the lens 120 is in contact with the outer edge 141 of the housing 140 and a contact portion r where the outer wall 124 in the lens 120 is in contact with the outer edge 161 of the cover<br>
 <br>
160 are offset in relation to the direction in which they are in contact with each other.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, in this embodiment, the cover 160 is molded with a resin (polypropylene (PP) for this embodiment), and includes an opening 164 formed therein, through which an electrical wire 253 (see Fig. 6) from the bulb 250 is passed. The cover 160 is provided at the outside surface thereof with a mounting portion 166 around the opening 164, the mounting portion 166 being for mounting the leg 180. Furthermore, in this embodiment, the mounting portion 166 includes a turn stopper 168 formed therearound. In this embodiment, the turn stopper 168 includes a mating portion formed along a sharp curve in an ellipse with which the long axis intersects.<br>
As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the leg 180 is a component in a cylindrical form, and is secured at one end 181 thereof to the vehicle body cover 400 (see Fig. 2) and at the other end thereof to the mounting portion 166 in the cover 160 of the flasher 101. In this embodiment, the mounting portion 166 includes the turn stopper 168 formed therein. The cover 160 of the flasher 101 is placed on the other end 182 of the leg 180 so as to be engaged with the turn stopper 168. This allows the cover 160 to be mated with the leg 180. In this case, the leg 180 may be<br>
 <br>
molded with an elastic material, for example, a rubber.<br>
In this embodiment, the electrical wire 253 connected to the bulb in the flasher 101, whose illustration is omitted, is electrically connected with a battery (not shown) in the straddle type vehicle 1000 through the cover 160, the leg 180, and the vehicle body cover 400 from the bulb placement portion 143 in the housing 140.<br>
The flasher 101 allows direct light emitted by the bulb and reflected light from the inside of the housing 140 to illuminate the outside of the lens 120 through the transparent lens surface 121 in the lens 120. The direction in which the light from the flasher 101 is emitted is adjusted by the housing or the like so as to be visible from a predetermined region outside the flasher 101.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the flasher 101 includes the cover 160 placed on the peripheral edge of the lens 120, and the housing 140 placed on the peripheral edge of the lens 120 so as to be located at the inner side of the cover 160. The lens 120 includes an opaque area formed between the cover 160 and the housing 140. For this, even in the event of water entering the inside of the cover 160 around the peripheral edge of the lens 120, the water is not visible from the outside.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the flasher 101 includes the<br>
 <br>
surface on which the cover 160 is mated with the lens 120 slanted in relation to the direction s in which the leg 180 extends, while the lens 120 has a smaller dimension along the breadthwise direction than that along the lengthwise direction of the straddle type vehicle 1000. This provides the flasher 101 with good conspicuity (in particular, a left-hand rear flasher providing conspicuity as viewed from the rear at the left side of the vehicle and a right-hand rear flasher providing conspicuity as viewed from the rear at the right side) . In the event of the vehicle falling down, since the lens 120 has a smaller dimension along the breadthwise direction than that along the lengthwise direction of the vehicle, an impact resulting from the vehicle falling down can be sustained along the length of the vehicle which is longer, thereby protecting the lens 120 or the cover 160 against breakage due to the impact. In this embodiment, the leg 180 acts as a cushion in the event of the vehicle falling down, protecting other components of the flasher 101 from breakage resulting from the vehicle falling down. In particular, in this embodiment, the leg 180 is in a cylindrical form, and is molded with a rubber which is more elastic and flexible than other components of the flasher 101. This ensures that other components are protected from breakage due to impact in the event of<br>
 <br>
vehicle falling down. The flasher 101 acting as a cushion protects the vehicle body cover 400 from breakage or damage. Furthermore, in this embodiment, the lens 120, having a smaller dimension along the breadthwise direction than that along the lengthwise direction, provides conspicuity as viewed from the side and the rear, while it limits the projection of the flasher 101 from the vehicle body to a small degree. The installation of the flasher 101 on the vehicle body with the leg 180 therebetween results in a more slender vehicle body cover design at the rear of the straddle type vehicle 1000. The flasher 101 ensures conspicuity as viewed from the side as well as the rear while it does not greatly project in the breadthwise direction, enhancing the flexibility in designing the vehicle including the flasher 101.<br>
The phrase "the direction s in which the leg 180 extends" refers to the direction in which the leg 180 extends from the vehicle body. Like this embodiment, if the leg 180 is made up of a hollow, cylindrical component, such a direction can be thought to be the axial direction of the hollow. Such a direction can be replaced by the breadthwise direction of the vehicle (horizontal direction of the vehicle).<br>
In this embodiment, the vehicle body surface (the<br>
 <br>
surface of the base end 503 on the mudguard component 502 for this embodiment) on which the leg 180 of the flasher 101 is mounted is oriented toward the rear of the vehicle, as shown in Fig. 2. For this, the lens 120 of the flasher 101 can easily be directed toward the rear of the vehicle, thereby ensuring conspicuity of the flasher 101 as viewed from the rear of the vehicle.<br>
In this embodiment, the flasher 101 is tapered toward its front end t and rear end u along the lengthwise direction, as shown in Fig. 3. The lens 120 has a large dimension along the lengthwise direction of the vehicle, resulting in the lens surface 121 having a larger dimension along the lengthwise direction. This provides a greater lens surface area visible from the side or the rear, leading to enhanced conspicuity of the flasher 101. Furthermore, although illustrations are omitted here, if the taper toward the from end t and the rear end u is not made along the lengthwise direction, a substantially quadrangular flasher, for example, has its front end t and rear end u largely projecting in the breadthwise and vertical directions when viewed from the side of the flasher. In this embodiment, the flasher 101 is tapered toward its front end t and the rear end u along the lengthwise direction, as shown in Fig. 1. The front end t and the rear end u of the flasher 101 are prevented<br>
 <br>
from largely projecting in the breadthwise and vertical directions, while ensuring the conspicuity of the flasher 101. This allows the flasher 101 to be resistant to contact with the ground in the event of the falling down of the vehicle, thereby protecting the flasher 101 from breakage.<br>
Furthermore, in this embodiment, the rear end u of the flasher 101 is more acute-angled than the front end t of the flasher 101. This allows the flasher 101 to be formed so as to extend a large distance rearward and also allows the lens surface 121 to be formed so as to extend a large distance rearward, resulting in increased lens surface area visible from the side and the rear, thereby enhancing the conspicuity of the flasher 101.<br>
In this embodiment, the straddle type vehicle 1000 has a tail lamp 103 provided at the rear thereof. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the tail lamp 103 has a body portion 103a disposed at the rear of the vehicle, and side portions 103b and 103c extending forward from the body portion 103a along both sides in the breadthwise direction. In this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 3, the lens 120 of the flasher 1.01 is disposed along the side portions 103b and 103c of the tail lamp 103. This allows the flasher 101 and the tail lamp 103 at the rear of the straddle type vehicle 100 D to be disposed in a compact<br>
 <br>
manner. Also, this makes it appear that the tail lamp 103 and the flasher 101 are an integrated component.<br>
In particular, in this embodiment, a ridge line w, connecting between the flasher front end t and rear end u along the lengthwise direction of the lens 120 of the flasher 101, extends along the side surface of the side portions 103b and 103c of the tail lamp 103, as shown in Figs. 1 and 3. This allows the flasher 101 and the tail lamp 103 at the rear of the straddle type vehicle 1000 to be disposed in a compact manner, as well as makes it appear the tail lamp 103 and the flasher 101 are an integrated component. When the vehicle is viewed from the top, the outline of the lens 120 of the flasher 101 along the breadthwise direction of the vehicle may be formed along the side surface of the side portions 103b and 103c of the tail lamp 103. This arrangement also allows the flasher 101 and the tail lamp 103 at the rear of the straddle type vehicle 1000 to be disposed in a compact manner, as well as provides an integrated image of the tail lamp 103 and the flasher 101.<br>
In this embodiment, the surface Fl on which the edge 161 of the cover 160 is nated with the edge 124 of the lens 120 extends along the side of the vehicle body cover 400, as shown in Fig. 3. As mentioned above, the surface Fl on which the edge 161 of the cover 160 is mated with<br>
 <br>
the edge 124 of the lers 120 extends at one or more portions thereof along the: side of the vehicle body cover 4 00, producing an integrated image of the flasher 101 and the vehicle body cover 400 as well as an aesthetically pleasing vehicle design.<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 3, the surface on which the edge 161 of the cover 160 is mated with the edge 124 of the lens 120 is made up of two surfaces Fl and F2, one at the rear of the flasher 101 and the other at the front, while the surface Fl at the front is more oriented toward the rear of the vehicle than the surface F2 at the rear. Therefore, in particular, the flasher 101 can readily be seen from the side and the rear, thereby ensuring conspicuity as viewed from a prescribed range at the side and rear of the vehicle as well as implementing a relatively compact lens 120. In this case, as shown in Fig. 3, the surface on which the edge 161 of the cover 160 is mated with the edge 124 of the lens 120 may be substantially divided into two surfaces Fl and F2, one at the rear and the other at the front of the flasher 101. The boundary may be smoothly continuous. The two surfaces Fl and F2 at the rear and the front of the flasher 101 need not be completely planar.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, in this embodiment, the surface on which the edge 161 of the cover 160 is mated with the<br>
 <br>
edge 124 of the lens 120 is slanted in relation to the direction s in which the leg 180 extends from the vehicle body cover 400, and a more frontal portion of the straddle type vehicle 1000 includes the lens 120 located further outwardly in the breadthwise direction, resulting in enhanced conspicuity as viewed from the rear and the side.<br>
In this embodiment, the straddle type vehicle 1000 is provided with a tandem footrest 411 and a grab bar 412, as shown in Fig. 2. When viewed from the rear of the vehicle, the flasher 101 is disposed inward of lines Ll and L2, each of which connects between the ends of the tandem footrest 411 and the grab bar 412, the ends being the outermost ends along the breadthwise direction of the vehicle. Therefore, in the event of vehicle falling down, the tandem footrest 411 and the grab bar 412 are more prone to contact with the ground than the flasher 101, thereby preventing the flasher 101 from contacting the ground. This arrangement protects the flasher from breakage due to impact associated with the vehicle falling down. The tandem footrest 411 is a component on which tandem riders rest their feet, and is disposed at either side of the straddle type vehicle 1000, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The grab bar 412, disposed at the rear of the vehicle, is a component that tandem riders grasp<br>
 <br>
during vehicle operation.<br>
In this embodiment, the straddle type vehicle 1000 includes side covers 421 disposed under a seat 420, and the flasher 101 is disposed inward of the outermost position 421a on the side cover 421 along the breadthwise direction of the vehicles, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Therefore, in the event of the vehicle falling down, the side cover 421 is more prone to contact with the ground than the flasher 101, thereby preventing the flasher 101 from contacting the ground. This arrangement protects the flasher from breakage due to impact associated with the falling down.<br>
In this embodiment, the straddle type vehicle 1000 includes a muffler 430 disposed along the side of the vehicle body cover 400, as shown in Fig. 2. The flasher 101 is disposed inward of the outermost end of the muffler 430 along the breadthwise direction of the vehicle. Therefore, in the event of the vehicle falling down, the muffler 430 is more prone to contact with the ground than the flasher 101, thereby preventing the flasher 101 from contacting the ground. This arrangement protects the flasher from breakage due to impact associated with the vehicle falling down.<br>
In this embodiment, the straddle type vehicle 1000 is provided at the rear portion of the vehicle with the tail<br>
 <br>
lamp 103, as shown in Fig. 1. The lens 120 of the flasher 101 is disposed outward of the outermost end of the tail lamp 103 along the breadthwise direction, as shown in Fig. 2. The straddle type vehicle 1000 allows the lens 120 of the flasher 101 to be disposed outward of the outermost end of the tail lamp 103 along the breadthwise direction, thereby preventing light from the tail lamp 103 from interrupting light from the flasher 101 and securing the conspicuity of the flasher 101.<br>
The flasher and the straddle type vehicle according to one embodiment of the present invention are described above. However, the flasher and the straddle type vehicle according to the present invention are not limited to the embodiment mentioned above. Various modifications are viable.<br>
For example, the structure of the flasher is not limited to the structure described as an example in the above embodiment. For example, although a bulb is described as a light source, the light source is not limited to the bulb, but a component performing a light emitting function can be applied as well. For example, a light emitting element such as an LED can be used. Also, the specific structure of a lens, housing, cover, and leg is not limited to the embodiment mentioned above.
