				<td>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application is based upon U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.60/506,737, filed<br>
September 30, 2003, entitled "INSTRUMENT LOCK ASSEMBLY FOR TROCAR", which is<br>
currently pending.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to trocar assemblies. More particularly, the invention relates to<br>
structures for locking an instrument in position relative to a trocat sleeve and/or trocar obturator.<br>
2. Description of the Prior Art<br>
A trocar assembly is a surgical instrument used to gain access to a body cavity. A trocar<br>
assembly generally comprises two major components, a trocar sleeve, composed of a trocar housing<br>
and a trocar cannula, and a trocar obturator. The trocar cannula with the trocar obturator inserted<br>
therethrough is directed through the skin to access a body cavity through the tube in which<br>
laparoscopic or arthroscopic surgery and endoscopic procedures are to be performed. In order to<br>
penetrate the skin, the distal end of the trocar cannula is placed against the skin previously cut with a<br>
scalpel. The trocar obturator has a rounded point or cutting edge at its distal end. By applying<br>
pressure against the proximal end of the trocar obturator, the point is forced through the skin until it<br>
enters the body cavity. The trocar cannula is inserted through the perforation made by the<br>
obturator and the obturator is withdrawn, leaving the trocar cannula as an access way to the body<br>
cavity.<br><br>
As the trocar assembly is being inserted within the patient, it is often desirable to utili2e an<br>
endoscope or other instrument in conjunction with the trocar assembly. However, it is often<br>
difficult to maintain the endoscope or other instrument in a desired positioned relative to the trocar<br>
assembly.<br>
As such, a need exists for a convenient locking mechanism facilitating positioning of<br>
endoscopes and other instruments relative to a trocar assembly. The present invention provides<br>
such a locking mechanism.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a lock assembly for use in<br>
conjunction with a trocar sleeve. The lock assembly includes a lock assembly housing having an<br>
aperture extending therethrough. The lock assembly also includes a cam lever and an elastomeric<br>
block positioned within the lock assembly housing. The cam lever includes a first end pivotally<br>
secured to the lock assembly housing and a free second end that is adapted for user actuation,<br>
wherein rotation of the cam lever brings the elastomeric block into engagement with an instrument<br>
passing through the lock assembly housing for locking an instrument relative thereto.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide an obturator for use with a trocar<br>
sleeve. The obturator includes a shaft having a distal end and a proximal end, and having a<br>
passageway extending therethrough. The obturator also includes an instrument lock at the proximal<br>
end of said shaft. The instrument lock comprises a compressible material for abutting against an<br>
instrument when the instrument is inserted and locked within the passageway.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an instrument lock for use with a<br>
trocar. The instrument lock includes a housing having a passageway extending therethrough, and a<br>
compressible material positioned within the housing for selectively abutting against an instrument<br>
when an instrument is inserted and locked within said passageway.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the<br>
following detailed description when viewed in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which<br>
set forth certain embodiments of the invention.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein. It should be<br>
understood, however, that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which<br>
may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, the details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted<br>
as limiting, but merely as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art<br>
how to make and/or use the invention.<br>
An endoscope lock assembly for a trocar assembly is disclosed. The lock assembly provides<br>
for the controlled positioning of an endoscope relative to a trocar assembly. While the lock<br>
assembly is disclosed as being adapted for locking an endoscope in position, the lock assembly may<br>
be used for locking other instruments without departing from the spirit of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Figures 1 to 5, the trocar assembly 10 generally includes a trocar cannula 12, a<br>
trocar obturator 14, and a trocar housing (or handle) 16. The trocar cannula 12 defines an interior<br>
lumen 18 having an open distal end portion 20 and an open proximal end portion 22. The proximal<br>
end portion 22 extends into and is mounted in the distal end portion 24 of trocar housing 16. The<br>
trocar housing 16 has an open proximal end portion 26 that defines an opening 28. The opening 28<br>
is provided with a proximal seal assembly 30 constructed in accordance with the present invention<br>
and described in detail hereinbelow. The opening 28 is further provided with a duckbill seal<br>
assembly 32 positioned beneath the proximal seal assembly 28. While the present seal assembly is<br>
disclosed as a proximal seal assembly forming part of a dual sealing system, the present seal assembly<br>
may be utilized in a single seal system without departing from the spirit of the present invention.<br>
In general, the trocar sleeve 44 is composed of a trocar cannula 12 and a trocar housing 16.<br>
The trocar housing 16 includes a first housing member 36 and a second housing member 38. The<br><br>
second housing member 38 is ultimately composed of a second housing member cover 38a and a<br>
second housing member base 38b. Although, the housing 16 is disclosed as two components it is<br>
contemplated that a single component could be used without departing from the spirit of the<br>
present invention. The two component housing shown, aids in removal of specimens.<br>
The trocar obturator 14 is slidable in and removable from within the trocar cannula 12 and is<br>
inserted into the trocar housing 16 and the trocar cannula 12 through the proximal seal assembly 30,<br>
the duckbill seal assembly 32 and the opening 28 of the trocar housing 16. An obturator handle 34<br>
is provided at the proximal end of the trocar obturator 14 and a point or blade (not shown) is<br>
formed at the distal end thereof. As is well known in the art, the proximal seal assembly 30<br>
cooperates with the exterior of the instruments (for example, trocar obturators and other tools<br>
adapted for use in conjunction with trocar based procedures) extending through the trocar sleeve 44<br>
to sealingly engage the exterior surface thereof and thereby preclude the passage of fluids through<br>
the trocar housing 16.<br>
ROTATIONAL LATCHING SYSTEM<br>
With regard to the trocar housing 16 and with reference to Figures 1 to 5, the trocar housing<br>
16 is constructed of a first housing member 36 and a second housing member 38 which are<br>
selectively coupled for reasons that will be discussed below in greater detail. The first and second<br>
housing members 36, 38 include aligned apertures 40, 42 shaped and dimensioned for the receipt of<br>
instruments that are selectively passed through the trocar housing 16.<br><br>
As those skilled in the art will certainly appreciate, it is important that the first and second<br>
housing members 36, 38 remain securely attached during the insertion of the trocar sleeve 44 into<br>
the abdominal wall, as well as during the normal course of a procedure. However, it is also desirable<br>
to remove the first housing member 36 during the removal of a specimen, for example, from the<br>
abdominal cavity. The removal of the first housing member 36 allows the specimen to pass through<br>
only the duckbill seal assembly 32, instead of passing through both the duckbill seal assembly 32 and<br>
the proximal seal assembly 30. This provides for easier specimen removal and less trauma to the<br>
specimen during the removal process.<br>
The first housing member 36 supports the proximal sealing assembly 30 and sits atop the<br>
second housing member 38 in which the duckbill seal assembly 32 is mounted. The first housing<br>
member 36 includes an aperture 40 extending therethrough. The proximal seal assembly 30 is<br>
positioned within the aperture 40 of the first housing member 36.<br>
As to the second housing member 38, the second housing member 38 includes an aperture<br>
42 extending therethrough. The duckbill seal assembly 32 is positioned within the aperture 42 of the<br>
second housing member 38 adjacent the top surface 50 of the second housing member 38. In fact,<br>
and for reasons which will be discussed below in greater detail, the peripheral rim 52 of the duckbill<br>
seal assembly 32 is positioned directly adjacent the top surface 50 of the second housing member 38<br>
for engagement with the lower surface 54 of the first housing member 36.<br>
Connection of the first housing member 36 to the second housing member 38 is facilitated<br>
by a rotary latch mechanism 56. In particular, the first housing member 36 includes first and second<br>
downwardly extending arms 58. Each of the downwardly extending arms 58 includes a downwardly<br>
facing camming surface 60 and an outwardly facing latching surface 62.<br><br>
The second housing member 38 similarly includes a latching ring 64 with first and second<br>
latch members 66 for respectively engaging the respective latching surfaces 62 of the first and<br>
second downwardly extending arms 58 of the first housing member 36. The latching ring 64 is<br>
axially aligned with the central axis of the trocar sleeve 44 and lies in an annular groove 68 around<br>
the perimeter of the duckbill seal assembly 32. Although the latching ring 64 in accordance with a<br>
preferred embodiment rotates about a central axis of the trocar housing 16, the latching ring 64 may<br>
rotate about other axes without departing from the spirit of the present invention. The latching ring<br>
64 is capable of rotating about the central axis of the trocar sleeve 44, but is attached to the trocar<br>
housing 16 by a spring 70. The spring 70 holds the latching ring 64 in a locked position with a small<br>
amount of preloaded bias. However, the spring 70 allows rotation of the latching ring 64 during the<br>
attachment of the first housing member 36. The first and second latch members 66 respectively<br>
include upwardly facing camming surfaces 72 that interface with downwardly facing camming<br>
surfaces 60 of the first and second downwardly extending arms 58 of the first housing member 36.<br>
The first and second latch members 66 each include an upwardly facing camming surface 72<br>
shaped and dimensioned to respectively engage the camming surfaces 60 of the downwardly<br>
extending arms 58. Similarly, the first and second latch members 66 include inwardly facing latching<br>
surfaces 74 shaped and dimensioned for engaging the outwardly facing latching surfaces 62 of the<br>
first and second downwardly extending arms 58.<br>
In practice, latching of the first and second housing members 36, 38 is achieved by passing<br>
the first and second downwardly extending arms 58 through holes 76 formed in the top surface 50<br>
of the second housing member 38. As the first and second downwardly extending arms 58 extend<br>
through the respective holes 76 adjacent the first and second latch members 66 of the latching ring<br><br><br>
64, the camming surfaces 60 of the respective first and second downwardly extending arms 58<br>
engage the camming surfaces 72 of the first and second latch members 66. The engagement causes<br>
the latch ring 64 to rotate in a manner permitting the first and second downwardly extending arms<br>
58 to extend past the first and second latch members 66. This rotation is against the bias provided<br>
by the spring 70.<br>
Once the first and second downwardly extending arms 58 move past the first and second<br>
latch members 66, the spring 70 biasing the latching ring 64 causes the latching ring 64 to return to<br>
its original position and the outwardly facing latching surfaces 62 of the first housing member 36<br>
engage the inwardly facing latching surfaces 74 of the second housing member 38 to securely couple<br>
the first housing member 36 to the second housing member 38. The first and second housing<br>
members 36, 38 are selectively disengaged through the actuation of a lever 78 attached to the<br>
latching ring 64. Rotation of the lever 78 causes the latching ring 64 to rotate, moving the first and<br>
second latching members 66 out of engagement with the downwardly extending arms 58.<br>
The top surface 50 of the second housing member 38 includes holes 76 allowing the<br>
downwardly extending arms 58 of the first housing member 36 to pass through with only a small<br>
amount of clearance. This limited clearance allows for very little movement of the downwardly<br>
extending arms 58 either in the plane of the holes 76 or in bending. Therefore, when the first<br>
housing member 36 is latched to the second housing member 38, the only means of forceful<br>
disassembly of the first and second housing members 36, 38 is by shearing the first and second<br>
downwardly extending arms 58 themselves or by pure tension on the legs themselves. The first and<br>
second arms 58 cannot bend out of the way or slip due to the size of the holes 76. This creates a<br>
very secure attachment. The trocar housing 16 is disassembled by pushing the lever 78 in a<br><br><br>
horizontal rotation, causing rotation of the latching ring 64 about the central axis of the trocar sleeve<br>
44 in a manner overcoming the spring force. The lever 78 is accessible to the surgeon through a slot<br>
in the side of the trocar housing 16. When the lever 78 is pressed, the first and second latching<br>
members 66 of the latching ring 64 rotate past the first and second downwardly extending arms 58,<br>
and the first housing member 36 is released from the second housing member 38.<br>
The first housing member 36 is attached to the second housing member 38 by a rotary latch<br>
mechanism 56 and a seal between the first and second housing members 36, 38 is required to<br>
maintain insufflation. This seal is accomplished by using a downwardly extending flange 80 on the<br>
lower surface 54 of the first housing member 36 to compress a portion of the duckbill seal assembly<br>
32 adjacent the top surface 50 of the second housing member 38. The flange 80 and the duckbill<br>
seal assembly 32 include opposed angled surfaces. This provides an angular interface between the<br>
flange 80 on the first housing member 36 and the duckbill seal assembly 32 interface of the second<br>
housing member 38. This provides easier attachment of the first housing member 36 and permits<br>
vertical travel beyond the distance required to seal with no effect on the duckbill seal assembly's<br>
performance capabilities. In fact, this over travel is required to provide functional reliability in the<br>
rotary latch mechanism.<br>
The downwardly extending flange 80 of the first housing member 36 includes an angular<br>
interface that exerts a radial force component on the duckbill seal assembly 32. The angular<br>
interface also creates a vertical force component that translates into assembly force. The radial force<br>
dilates the interfacing feature, that is, the peripheral rim 52 of the duckbill seal assembly 32. Since<br>
the vertical force is only a portion of the total normal force, the assembly force is reduced as a<br>
function of the angle of the interface.<br><br><br>
In addition to the radial and vertical forces, the seal between the first and second housing<br>
members 36, 38 generates a camming action due to the interaction between the downwardly<br>
extending flange 80 and the peripheral rim 52 of the duckbill seal assembly 32. The radial<br>
movement of the peripheral rim 52 of the duckbill seal assembly 32 allows a small amount of over<br>
travel for the flange 80 with no negative impact to the duckbill seal assembly's ability to seal as<br>
intended for normal operation.<br>
In addition to providing for over travel, the compression of the peripheral rim 52 of the<br>
duckbill seal assembly 32 stores energy assisting in the disengagement of the first housing member<br>
36 from the second housing member 38. The stored energy causes the first housing member 36 to<br>
readily move from the second housing member 38 upon actuation of the lever 78.<br>
More particularly, coupling of the first and second housing members 36, 38 is enhanced by<br>
the provision of a downwardly extending flange 80 along the lower surface 54 of the first housing<br>
member 36 that is shaped and dimensioned for engaging the peripheral rim 52 of the duckbill seal<br>
assembly 32. With this in mind, the downwardly extending flange 80 is provided with an inwardly<br>
facing taper and the peripheral rim 52 is provided with an outwardly facing taper. The inwardly and<br>
outwardly facing tapers interact to permit play between the first and second housing members 36, 38<br>
in a manner facilitating secure attachment By providing opposed tapered surfaces, and in particular<br>
by providing an inwardly tapered surface on the peripheral rim 52 with a slight amount of give under<br>
pressure, the dimensional tolerances necessary for ensuring coupling of the latch mechanisms are<br>
enhanced.<br>
Proper alignment between the first and second housing members 36, 38 is achieved by the<br>
provision of an alignment pin 82 extending downwardly from the lower surface 54 of the first<br><br><br>
housing member 36 and a mating hole 84 shaped and dimensioned for receiving the alignment pin<br>
82 formed along the top surface 50 of the second housing member 38. The provision of the<br>
alignment pin 82 and the mating hole 84 ensures that the first and second housing members 36, 38<br>
may only be assembled in the desired configuration. Optionally, a second pin may be provided to<br>
prevent the opposite latch from engaging. This is an integral part of the design as it is intended for<br>
safety. The trocar obturator 14 can only be attached to the first housing member 36 in one<br>
configuration and the first housing member 36 can only be attached to the second housing member<br>
38 in one configuration.<br>
As discussed above, the rotary latch mechanism 56 utilized in connecting the first housing<br>
member 36 to the second housing member 38 offers a wide variety of advantages. In particular, the<br>
rotary latch design allows the first housing member 36 to be rigidly attached to the second housing<br>
member 38 with no chance of the latches "slipping off, while allowing very easy detachment of the<br>
first housing member 36. In fact, the holes 76 through which the first and second downwardly<br>
extending arms 58 of the first housing member 36 pass through disallows any chance of the arms 58<br>
bending out of the way. In addition, since the force vector of the latch return spring 70 is<br>
perpendicular to any disengaging force exerted during use, the force required to attach the first<br>
housing member 36 can be addressed independently of any specified disengaging force. This is<br>
contrary to typical latch designs where the arms of the latches are elastically bent to attach and<br>
detach the outer seal housing. In these types of designs the force of assembly and the force of<br>
disassembly arc directly linked to one another via the bending characteristics of the latching arms.<br>
Finally, the latch mechanism is easily manipulated with one hand.<br><br><br>
With regard to the angular contact between the downwardly extending flange 80 of the first<br>
housing member 36 and the peripheral rim 52 of the duckbill seal assembly 32, this provides for<br>
reduced assembly force required in attaching the first housing member 36 to the second housing<br>
member 38. One may compress the first housing member 36 a greater distance than with a flat seal<br>
and still get the same force of assembly. This allows tolerances of design parts to be greater for<br>
given compression distance requirements. In addition, the raised nature of the peripheral rim 52 on<br>
the duckbill seal assembly 32 allows for radial deflection as well, thereby, additionally reducing<br>
assembly forces.<br>
REINFORCED SEAL ASSEMBLY<br>
Referring to Figures 6 to 10, the proximal seal assembly 30 is disclosed. The seal assembly<br>
generally includes a cap 86, a crown 88, bellows 90 used for radial seal movement, a female retaining<br>
ring 92, a protector 94, a plurality of reinforced seal segments 96 making up a seal body 98, a male<br>
retaining ring 100 and a bottom body 102. The reinforced seal segments 96 are positioned as<br>
described below in greater detail and mounted between the retaining rings 92, 100 for creating a seal<br>
assembly 30 in accordance with the present invention.<br>
More particularly, and with reference to Figures 7 to 10, a reinforced seal segment 96 is<br>
shown. As is described in greater detail below, the proximal seal assembly 30 employs a plurality of<br>
reinforced seal segments 96 in creating a complete seal body 98. Each of the reinforced seal<br>
segments 96 is in the form of a partial cone, in particular, a cone extending about approximately 225<br>
degrees. While the partial cone shape in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present<br><br><br>
invention employs partial cones extending about approximately 225 degrees, partial cones of other<br>
shapes may be employed without departing from the sprit of the present invention. Although cone<br>
shaped seal segments are disclosed in accordance with a preferred embodiment, flat seal segments<br>
could be employed without departing from the spirit of the present invention.<br>
Each reinforced seal segment 96 is preferably manufactured from an elastomer of a cross<br>
linked polymer, such as, but not restricted to, polyisoprene or silicone. However, those skilled in the<br>
art will appreciate that other materials may be employed without departing from the spirit of the<br>
present invention.<br>
In practice, a series of reinforced seal segments 96 are utilized in the creation of a seal body<br>
98 through which an instrument may be inserted. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention, four reinforced seal segments 96 are aligned and successively shifted 90<br>
degrees relative to each other. The seal segments 96 are arranged in a "woven" manner. That is,<br>
each seal segment 96 includes a first side 104 and second side 106, and the first side 104 of each seal<br>
segment 96 is placed atop the second side 106 of the adjacent seal segment 96 to create a "woven"<br>
assembly of seal segments 96.<br>
The reinforced seal segments 96 are then bound together along their peripheral edges 108 to<br>
the male and female retaining rings 94, 100 to create a complete seal body 98. As a result of the<br>
partial cone shape of the reinforced seal segments 96 and the relative rotation thereof, the bound<br>
seal segments 96 create a seal body 98 wherein the individual seal segments 96 are pushed outwardly<br>
upon the insertion of an instrument to create an opening for the passage of instruments and resilient<br>
move inwardly to close the opening upon the removal of instruments. The typical deformation of<br>
the reinforced seal segment 96 is shown with reference to Figure 3. The deformation is shown with<br><br><br>
the insertion of an instrument therethrough.<br>
As mentioned above, each of the reinforced seal segments 96 is generally in the form of a<br>
cone with a portion of the cone cut away. The reinforced seal segment 96 includes a peripheral edge<br>
108 secured to a central seal member 110. The peripheral edge 108 is substantially flat, lying in the<br>
same plane, while the central seal member 110 is formed in the shape of a section of a cone.<br>
The central seal member 110 is enhanced through the inclusion of a reinforcement pad 112<br>
at a central position on the reinforced seal segment 96. That is, the reinforcement pad 112 is<br>
positioned between the peripheral edge and the free edge of the central seal member 110. More<br>
particularly, the reinforcement pad 112 is positioned at the rip of the cone defined by the central seal<br>
member 110 with edges of the reinforcement pad 112 being aligned with the free edge of the central<br>
seal member 110 at the tip of the cone.<br>
The reinforcement pad 112 is integrally formed with the remainder of the central seal<br>
member 110, but has a thickness that is approximately 2.5 times that of the nominal thickness of the<br>
central seal member 110. In particular, the reinforcement pad 112 of the central seal member 110 is<br>
formed with a thickness of approximately 0.017 inches, while the remainder of the central seal<br>
member 110 is formed with a thickness of approximately .007 inches. While thicknesses are<br>
disclosed above in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, different<br>
diickness may be employed without departing from the spirit of the present invention. The<br>
transition between the reinforcement pad 112 and the remainder of the central seal member 110 is<br>
achieved by tapering the central seal member 110 between the thickness of the reinforcement pad<br>
112 and the remainder of the central seal member 110. It is further contemplated, that the transition<br>
could be done without transition regions; that is with a sharp transition. However, the preferred<br><br><br>
embodiment has no stress risers and allows the seal to seal better. It is also contemplated that the<br>
seal segments could have been made with the pad flat with no transition.<br>
As shown in Figure 7, and in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the reinforcement pad 112 is general formed in a triangular configuration along the center<br>
of the arc defined by the reinforced seal segment 96. In particular, the reinforcement pad 112<br>
occupies an are of approximately 90 degrees along the central seal member 110. As those skilled in<br>
the art will certainly appreciate, the shape and size of the reinforcement pad 112 may be varied to<br>
suit specific needs without departing from the spirit of the present invention. However, the<br>
reinforcement pad 112 should be shaped and dimensioned to cover an area that is intended for<br>
contact with instruments being passed through the trocar assembly 10.<br>
The reinforcement pad 112 is located on a portion of the central seal member 110 that is<br>
most likely to have direct contact with surgical instruments as they are inserted within the trocar<br>
cannula 12. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the reinforcement<br>
pad 112 is centrally located, as most surgical instruments will be inserted through the center of the<br>
trocar housing 16 and the trocar cannula 12.<br>
It should be noted that in other embodiments the angled surface that slopes from the<br>
reinforcement pad 112 to the nominal thickness of the central seal member 110 could be omitted<br>
and the reinforcement pad 112 could be smoothly blended into the nominal thickness of the central<br>
seal member 110 via continuous curvature.<br>
Low drag forces between the proximal seal assembly 30 and an insertion instrument are<br>
desirable. The present proximal seal assembly 30 permits the production of low drag forces without<br>
reducing seal durability. This is accomplished by reducing the seal thickness in conjunction with<br><br><br>
application of a reinforcement pad 112 as described above. As such, the reduction in thickness (in<br>
the area that is not contacting the instrument) is not accompanied with a reduction in seal durability<br>
as is common with prior art seal assemblies.<br>
Seal assemblies incorporating reinforcement pads 112 in accordance with the present<br>
invention greatly reduce snagging and tearing the seal through either the insertion or withdrawal of<br>
an instrument without requiring additional thickness throughout the seal segments 96. The greater<br>
thickness in the region of the reinforcement pad 112 resists tenting at the reinforcement pad 112<br>
where the instrument is contacting the seal assembly 98. However, the thin sections of the central<br>
seal member 110 surrounding the central reinforcement pad 112 allow for easy stretching of the<br>
remainder of the central seal member 110, thereby keeping drag forces on moving instruments to a<br>
minimum. Since the greatest strain occurs along the opening of the central seal member 110 when<br>
an instrument is present, and in accordance with a preferred embodiment, the reinforced seal<br>
segments 96 should be kept thin in any areas not contacting an instrument. This minimizes drag<br>
forces.<br>
The effective protection imparted by the present reinforcement pad 112 manifests itself in<br>
the proximal seal assembly 30 as follows. For a given deflection of the proximal seal assembly 30<br>
due to initial contact with the tip of an instrument, the region defined by the reinforcement pad 112<br>
of the proximal seal assembly 30 will have a relatively low strain when compared to the thinner<br>
portion of the central seal member 110 surrounding the reinforcement pad 112 due to the difference<br>
in thicknesses between the reinforcement pad 112 and the central seal member 110. This<br>
differential in strain is largest at the opening of the proximal seal assembly 30, where overall strains<br>
are highest. When force is applied to the reinforcement pad 112 due to contact with an instrument,<br><br><br>
the increased thickness of the reinforcement pad 112 will resist tenting, while the thin cross section<br>
of the remainder of the central seal member 110 not covered by the reinforcement pad 112 will<br>
allow the reinforcement pad 112 to easily deflect distally permitting the tip of the instrument to roll<br>
into the center of the proximal seal assembly 30. Resistance to tearing for the reinforced seal<br>
segment 96 is greatly increased as compared to prior art seal segments.<br>
The reinforcement pads 112 allow the reinforced seal segments 96 to protect themselves<br>
against sharp instruments independently of other peripheral protection devices. This protection is<br>
integral to the reinforced seal segments 96 themselves. Also the addition of reinforcement pads 112<br>
at strategic locations (away from areas of high strain directly located at the point of likely sharp<br>
instrument contact) allows the reinforcement pads 112 to protect against puncture with little or no<br>
impact to seal performance. It does not increase peak instrument insertion forces or instrument<br>
drag forces. It is contemplated that the use of reinforcement pads 112 might be expanded beyond<br>
positioning at a central location, thereby offering some impact to peak instrument insertion forces<br>
and instrument drag forces. However, due to the nature of the seal segments 96 and their greatly<br>
reduced strain relative to standard lip seals, this impact would likely yield a design that would easily<br>
outperform standard seal assemblies.<br>
WOVEN SEAL PROTECTOR<br>
Although the seal body 98 is formed with reinforcement pads 112 as described above it is<br>
still desirable to provide the proximal seal assembly 30 with a protector 92, as best shown in Figure<br>
13. The protector 92 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention is<br><br><br>
positioned directly above the seal body 98. With reference to Figures 6 and 11-13, the protector 92<br>
is composed of multiple overlapping protector segments 114 assembled in a woven arrangement to<br>
provide a complete protector 92. By forming the protector 92 in a woven arrangement, additional<br>
protector material is added (as a result of the overlapping arrangement) such that additional surface<br>
area of the seal body 98 may be protected as the protector segments 114 separate as an instrument is<br>
inserted into the seal.<br>
As the present proximal seal assembly 30 has a small central opening which expands in a<br>
reliable and convenient manner, the protector 92 must be formulated to close gaps between<br>
protector segments 114 as an instrument is passed through the protector 92 and the seal body 98.<br>
This requires the addition of material along the opening of the protector 92.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, additional material is added to the protector 92 by<br>
weaving a plurality of protector segments 114. By weaving the protector segments 114, extra<br>
material is added to the protector 92 so as to widen each protector component while still allowing<br>
the protectors to fit within the coned seal profile. The extra material is wrapped behind the<br>
protector segment 114 to one side of each protector segment 114. This extra material is not visible<br>
when the protector segments 114 are viewed from above without an instrument inserted.<br>
The protector segments 114 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention are manufactured from molded elastomer, for example, pellethane. However, it is not<br>
intended that the protector segments 114 be limited to merely elastomers, but the protector<br>
segments 114 may be made from any type of material that contains the required properties and<br>
characteristics for the function described herein.<br><br><br>
In particular, four protector segments 114 are arranged to create the protector 92. While<br>
four protector segments 114 are utilized in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the protector 92 may ultimately be formed with different: numbers of protector segments<br>
114 without departing from the spirit of the present invention.<br>
Each protector segment 114 is semicircular when viewed from above and is generally in the<br>
form of a partial cone. Each of these protector segments 114 include a substantially round<br>
peripheral edge 116, a support wall 118 extending from the peripheral edge 116 and a cone shaped<br>
protector member 120. The cone shaped protector member 120 opposite the support wall 118 and<br>
the peripheral edge 116 defines straight shaped edge 121.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the cone shaped<br>
protector member 120 spans an arc of approximately 180 degrees, while the support wall 118 and<br>
the peripheral edge 116 span an arc of approximately 120 degrees along the center of the cone<br>
shaped protector member 120. As will be discussed below in greater detail, the limited arc spanned<br>
by the peripheral edge 116 and the support wall 118 reduces undesirable forces as instruments are<br>
moved past the proximal seal assembly 30.<br>
The outer peripheral edge 116 is adapted for positioning within the first housing member 36.<br>
The outer peripheral edge 116 further includes a series of apertures 122 that function as a means of<br>
attachment for the protector segments 114. As will be apparent based upon the following<br>
disclosure, the use of multiple protector segments 114 defining an arc of approximately 180 degrees<br>
results in a reduction in hoop stresses by providing a protector 92 composed of a series of protector<br>
segments 114 which readily bend in and out radially as instruments are inserted therethrough.<br><br><br>
Each protector segment 114 includes a first section 124 and a second section 126 defining<br>
opposite sides of the protector segment 114. The four individual protector segments 114 are<br>
combined in a woven arrangement to create a complete protector ')2 that fully protects the<br>
underlying seal body 98. That is, the protector 92 is assembled by placing the first section 124 of a<br>
first protector segment 114 upon the second section 126 of a second protector segment 114. The<br>
first section 124 of the second protector segment 114 is subsequently placed upon the second<br>
section 126 of a third protector segment 114, the first section 124 of the third protector segment<br>
114 is placed upon the second section 126 of a fourth protector segment 114 and the first section<br>
124 of the fourth protector segment 114 is placed upon the second section 126 of the first protector<br>
segment 114 like one folds the final flap of a box lid.<br>
The protector segments 114 are ultimately held together through the application of the<br>
crown 88 and female retaining ring 94. Retaining members are well known to those skilled in the<br>
art and a variety of retaining members may be employed within the: spirit of the present invention.<br>
As those skilled in the art will readily appreciate, movement of the cone shaped protector<br>
members 120 relative to the peripheral edge 116 and the support wall 118 is subject to resistance<br>
based upon the various orientations of the connected components As such, the cone shaped<br>
protector members 120 might be susceptible to buckling as instruments are moved through the<br>
proximal seal assembly 30.<br>
This resistance to movement is minimised due to the limited arc of the peripheral edge 116<br>
and the support wall 118 as discussed above. In addition, the resistance is further minimized by<br>
forming a central slot 128 with the peripheral edge 116 and/or the support wall 118. This slot 128<br>
functions to reduce buckling as the protector members 120 may move the same distance with less<br><br><br>
resistance.<br>
By weaving the protector 92 additional material may be added to each protector segment<br>
114 while still allowing the distal end of the protector 92 to fit into the apex of the cone shaped seal<br>
body 98. This is accomplished by having the extra material added to the protector segments 114<br>
wrap behind the protector segment 114 adjacent thereto. This extra material allows for improved<br>
coverage of the seal body 98, especially when instruments are insetted at an angle relative to the<br>
proximal seal assembly 30. Finally, weaving of the protector 92 has minimal, if any effects on the<br>
instrument drag force as it is moved in and out of the proximal seal assembly 30. This is a result of<br>
the fact that the protector segments 114 move easily relative to each other.<br>
In practice, and due to the extra material added to each protector segment 114, as an<br>
instrument is inserted into the protector 92, the protector segments 114 spread, exposing the<br>
additional protector material positioned behind adjacent protector segments 114. This additional<br>
material continues to cover the seal body 98 as the protector segments 114 bend relative to one<br>
another. The less seal body 98 material exposed to the inserted instrument, the better the protection<br>
offered by the present protector 92. While the present protector 92 offers good seal protection,<br>
additional protector segments 114 can be added although they might cause an increase in the<br>
instrument drag forces. This may be balanced, however, by thinning the protector segments 114 to<br>
make them more flexible or by adding lubricant to the protector segments 114 and/or the seal body<br>
98.<br><br><br>
DUCKBILL SEAL ASSEMBLY<br>
As mentioned above, a duckbill seal assembly 32 is housed within the second housing<br>
member 38. With reference to Figures 14 tot 6, the duckbill seal assembly 32 in accordance with a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention is disclosed. The duckbill seal assembly 32 includes<br>
first and second seal bodies 130, 132 extending from a circumferential flange member 134 shaped<br>
and dimensioned for mounting within the second housing member 38.<br>
Each of the first and second seal bodies 130, 132 includes an upper surface 136, 138 and a<br>
lower surface 140, 142. The upper surface 136, 138 and the lower surface 140, 142 are generally<br>
mirror images as the first and second seal bodies 130, 132 maintain a substantially consistent<br>
thickness along its entire length with the exception of the reinforcing rib along the upper surface<br>
136, 138.<br>
The first and second seal bodies 130, 132 are mounted within the trocar housing 16 for<br>
movement as an instrument is passed therethrough. With this in mind, the proximal end of each of<br>
the first and second seal bodies 130, 132 is coupled to the trocar housing 16 via the circumferential<br>
flange 134, while the distal ends of the first and second seal bodies 130, 132 intersect to define an<br>
abutment face 144. The abutment face 144 is generally positioned within the center of the trocar<br>
housing 16 to permit the passage of an instrument therethrough, while in the absence of such an<br>
instrument the abutment face 144 is closed via the resilience of the first and second bodies 130, 132<br>
as they are biased under the pressure generated from the body cavity in which the trocar assembly<br>
10 is positioned. For example, biased under the pressure from the abdominal insufflation gas<br>
pressure. This pressure causes the duckbill seal assembly 32 to move to a closed position with the<br><br><br>
distal ends of the first and second seal bodies 130, 132 in contact.<br>
As those skilled in the art will certainly appreciate, the seal bodies 130, 132 may be formed<br>
with ribs (not shown) on the upper surface 136, 138 so as to enhance the stability of the seal bodies<br>
130, 132 when contacted with an instrument. The ribs also provide a path for instruments to ride<br>
upon as they pass through the duckbill seal assembly 32. The ribs also lower friction as the<br>
instruments pass through the duckbill seal assembly 32 because it provides less surface area on<br>
which an instrument may ride, and thus greater contact pressure between the seal and the<br>
instrument may be applied.<br>
The first and second seal bodies 130, 132 will now be described with reference to the first<br>
seal body 130. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the first and second seal bodies 130, 132<br>
are identical and the following descriptions equally relates to the second seal body 132. The seal<br>
body 130 is formed with a first section 148 and a second section 150 angularly oriented relative to<br>
each other and a transverse plane 146 extending through the circumferential flange 134. In<br>
particular, the transverse plane 146 is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis extending<br>
through the duckbill seal assembly 32. The first and second sections 148, 150 extend from a<br>
proximal end of the seal body 130 respectively toward a distal end of the seal body 130. As such,<br>
the first section 148 is positioned adjacent the proximal end of the seal body 130 adjacent the wall of<br>
the circumferential flange 134 and the trocar housing 16. The first section 148 moves only slightly<br>
as an instrument is inserted therethrough. The second section 150 is positioned adjacent the distal<br>
end of the seal body 130 and adjacent the abutment face 144. The second section 150 freely moves<br>
as an instrument is inserted therethrough.<br><br><br>
In general, the first and second sections lie at angles between 0 degrees and 90 degrees<br>
relative to the transverse plane. Assuming the transverse plane 146 lies in a horizontal plane, and in<br>
accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the first section 148, which<br>
begins at the proximal end of the seal body 130, is oriented at approximately a 30 degree angle<br>
relative to the horizontal plane in which the transverse plane 146 lies. The second section 150,<br>
which extends to the distal end of the seal body 130, is thereafter oriented at a 45 degree angle<br>
relative to the horizontal plane. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the angles disclosed<br>
above in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention may be varied without<br>
departing from the spirit of the present invention. The chosen angles are based upon the trade off<br>
between the durability of the seal bodies (improves at greater angles as likelihood of an instrument<br>
pointedly engaging the seal, i.e. tenting is less likely at greater angles) and the height of the seal<br>
(greater angles dictate greater height). For example, it is contemplate the second section 150 may be<br>
formed at an angle of approximately 40 degrees to approximately 50 degrees while providing for the<br>
many advantages contemplated in accordance with the present duckbill seal assembly 32. The<br>
height or profile of the duckbill seal assembly 32 is important as reductions in size allow for<br>
improved instrument access because the length of the trocar housing 16 may be consequently made<br>
smaller. Smaller housings provide surgeons with greater access within the body cavity and thus arc<br>
very desirable.<br>
While a preferred embodiment as described above employs first and second sections 148,<br>
150 in implementing the present invention, additional sections may be employed without departing<br>
from the spirit of the present invention. Similarly, the present duckbill seal bodies 130, 132 may be<br>
constructed with an infinite number of angles, that is, with a continuous curving surface, without<br><br><br>
departing from the spirit of the present invention.<br>
Regardless of the exact wall construction employed, the wall angle should be maintained low<br>
(for example, 30 degrees) where instruments do not ordinarily contact the seal bodies 130, 132 of<br>
the duckbill seal assembly 32 and increase to a high value (for example, 45 degrees) where<br>
instruments customarily contact the wall surface of the seal bodies 130, 132.<br>
By orienting first and second sections 148, 150 in this manner, that is, by varying the wall<br>
angles along the extent of the seal bodies 130, 132, tear resistance is improved without adjusting the<br>
overall height of the duckbill seal assembly 32. By providing a low wall angle at the position where<br>
instruments do not customarily contact the seal bodies 130, 132 the overall height of the duckbill<br>
seal assembly 32, and ultimately the trocar assembly 10, may be minimized, while accommodating<br>
proper seal function. The application of a high wall angle at the location where instruments<br>
customarily contact the seal bodies 130, 132 minimizes normal forces contacting the duckbill seal<br>
assembly 32 and consequently minimizes the potential for tearing of the duckbill seal assembly 32.<br>
As discussed above, the height of the trocar sleeve 44 is a critical issue due to its impact on<br>
ergonomics. At the same time, the duckbill drag, durability, and sealing functions must all be<br>
balanced with the need for minimized trocar sleeve 44 height.<br>
In order to provide a superior design in accordance with the present duckbill seal assembly<br>
32, the height of the duckbill seal assembly 32 is minimized by using two wall angles. The wall angle<br>
along the first section 148 is shallow to minimize the height. At a given critical diameter, the wall<br>
angle becomes steeper at the second section 150. This steeper wall provides a lower attack angle<br>
with respect to an inserted instrument to maximize durability. At the same time, the sealing function<br>
is improved due to the greater closure forces from the abdominal gas pressures acting on the second<br><br><br>
section with the lower attack angle due to the steeper wall, as compared with the angle of the first<br>
section 148.<br>
Despite the advantages offered by the multi-angle design, (forces between the duckbill seal<br>
assembly 32 and the instrument must still be further minimized. This is accommodated through<br>
wall thickness, rib geometry and surface coating adjustment. The lower drag forces are desirable to<br>
reduce the effort required by a surgeon when inserting or withdrawing instruments from a trocar<br>
sleeve 44. Reducing the effort required is desirable for permitting one-handed insertion or<br>
withdrawal of an instrument This also reduces the possibility of a trocar sleeve 44 being pulled out<br>
of a patient into which the trocar assembly 10 was inserted.<br>
As discussed, and while angles of 30 and 45 degrees are utilized in accordance with a<br>
preferred embodiment, as larger diameter instruments are required, larger diameter duckbill seal<br>
assemblies 32 will also be required. As space is usually at a premium in valve applications, especially<br>
for duckbill seal assemblies 32 when used in trocar assemblies, minimal height is very desirable. Seal<br>
durability is paramount so an angle of forty-five degrees is used to minimize tearing of the seal<br>
bodies 130, 132 while inserting or withdrawing instruments.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the duckbill seal assembly 32 is an elastomer or<br>
a cross linked polymer such as, but not restricted to, polyisoprene or silicone.<br>
ENDOSCOPE LOCK ASSEMBLY<br>
As discussed above in the Background of the Invention, it is often desirable to lock an<br>
endoscope in position relative to a trocar assembly 10, in particular, an obturator 14. As such an<br><br><br>
endoscope lock assembly 152 is provide in accordance with the present invention and is shown in<br>
Figures 3, 4 and 25. The endoscope lock assembly 152 generally includes a cam mechanism that<br>
retains an endoscope within a trocar sleeve 44 and/or obturator 14 during insertion of trocar<br>
assembly 10. The mechanism uses a cam to compress an elastomeric block 154 against the<br>
endoscope. The elastomeric block 154 then grips the endoscope tighdy to prevent undesired<br>
motion of the endoscope as the surgeon is visualizing the tissue layers during the trocar assembly<br>
insertion. The cam mechanism provides for the ability to retain the endoscope while resisting both<br>
torque and axial loads, provides for acceptable endoscope retention after repeated throws of the<br>
cam lever 156, provides low ergonomic forces to actuate the cam lever 156, provides for<br>
compatibility with a wide range of endoscope sizes, facilitates intuitive use and has a long term shelf<br>
life stability.<br>
The cam mechanism that retains the endoscope within a trocar assembly 10 uses a cam<br>
surface 158 to compress the elastomeric block 154 against the endoscope. The elastomeric block<br>
154 then grips the endoscope tighdy to prevent undesired motion of the endoscope as the surgeon<br>
is visualizing the tissue layers during the trocar assembly insertion.<br>
The lock assembly 152 includes a housing 160 having a tube 162 extending therefrom. The<br>
tube 162 is aligned with an aperture extending therethrough. The tube is formed with a sharp tip<br>
and may be utilized as an obturator in accordance with the present invention. The tube 162 and the<br>
aperture are shaped and dimensioned for the extension of an endoscope therethrough. In addition,<br>
the tube 162 is shaped and dimensioned to extend through the trocar cannula 12 such that the lock<br>
assembly 152, including the tube 162, may be selectively secured to the trocar sleeve 44 for the use<br>
of an endoscope.<br><br><br>
Attachment of the lock assembly 152 to the trocar first housing member 36 is achieved via<br>
mating latches 164, 166 formed on both the underside of the lock assembly housing 160 and the<br>
upper surface 168 of the first housing member 36. The latches 164, 166 permit selective attachment<br>
and release of the lock assembly 152 to the trocar housing 16. While a specific latching structure is<br>
disclosed in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, other latching<br>
structures may be utilized without departing from the spirit of the present invention.<br>
The lock assembly housing 160 includes a camming based locking mechanism. The locking<br>
mechanism is composed of a cam lever 156 and an elastometric block 154. The cam lever 156<br>
includes a first end 170 that is pivotally secured to the housing 160 and a free second end 172 that is<br>
adapted for user actuation. In practice, the cam lever 156 may be freely moved between a locking<br>
position in which the cam lever 156 is rotated inwardly and a release position in which the cam lever<br>
156 is rotated outwardly.<br>
Camming action in accordance with the present invention is provided by a camming surface<br>
158 adjacent the first end 170 of the cam lever 156. The camming surface 158 is shaped and<br>
dimensioned to engage the elastomenc block 154 for selectively locking an endoscope within the<br>
lock assembly 152. With regard to the elastomenc block 154, it is housed within the body of the<br>
lock assembly housing 160 and includes a forward concave wall 174 shaped and dimensioned for<br>
engaging an endoscope passing through the housing aperture. The elastomenc block 154 further<br>
includes first and second side walls 176, 178, wherein each side wall 176, 178 includes a notch 180<br>
for engagement with a channel 182 formed within the body of the housing 160. The channel 182<br>
and notch 180 interact to allow lateral movement of the elastomeric block 154 in a manner that is<br>
described below in greater detail. The housing 160 further includes upper and lower retaining<br><br><br>
members 184, 186 for securely preventing upward or downward motion of the elastomeric block<br>
154 within the housing 160. Finally, the elastomeric block 154 includes a rear wall 188 opposite the<br>
forward concave wall 174. The rear wall 188 is shaped and dimensioned for engagement with the<br>
camming surface 158 of the cam lever 156.<br>
The elastomeric block 154 and the camming surface 158 are shaped to eliminate forceful<br>
contact, and in particular eliminate any contact, between the elastomeric block 154 and the camming<br>
surface 158 until such a time that an endoscope is positioned with the aperture of the lock assembly<br>
housing 160. As will be described below in greater detail, when an endoscope if placed within the<br>
aperture of the lock assembly housing 160, the elastomeric block 154 is moved toward the cam lever<br>
156 to such a degree that the elastomeric block 154 comes into proximity of the camming surface<br>
158 for locking of the endoscope within the aperture once the cam lever is actuated.<br>
In practice, the lock assembly 152 is used in the following manner. The elastomeric block<br>
154 sits within the lock assembly housing 160 underneath the cam lever 156, which may be either<br>
open or closed during long-term storage. The elastomeric block is purposefully not in contact with<br>
the cam lever 156 at this point to avoid any loads on the elastomeric block 154 that could affect the<br>
lock assembly's 152 performance after long-term storage. The surgeon then opens the cam lever<br>
156 if it was originally closed. An endoscope is inserted into the lock assembly 154. The endoscope<br>
hits a chamfered surface 190 on the concave wall 174 of the elastomeric block 154. This lifts the<br>
elastomeric block 154 upward into the proximity of the cam lever 156. The elastomeric block 154<br>
then rests on top of the endoscope for the rest of its use. The cam lever 156 is then actuated, which<br>
compresses the compressible scope lock onto the endoscope. The compliance of the elastomeric<br>
block 154, along with its high coefficient of friction, allows the lock assembly 152 to be compatible<br><br><br>
with a wide range of endoscope sizes while minimizing ergonomic force requirements. The<br>
elastomeric block 154 is then constrained from excessive sideways or axial motion by surrounding<br>
components 182, 184, 186 that limit its motion as axial and torsional loads ate applied to the<br>
endoscope. This constraint, along with an over-center cam design, prevents the cam lever from<br>
accidentally unlocking by itself by accident. After the trocar assembly 10 has been inserted into the<br>
patient, the cam lever 156 is then opened and the endoscope is removed. The elastomeric block 154<br>
then returns to its original position in the lock assembly 152 if the surgeon wishes to reinsert the<br>
endoscope at a later time. The compliant elastomeric block 154 has sufficient rigidity to return to its<br>
original shape after the load from the cam lever 156 has been removed, thus providing acceptable<br>
endoscope retention force over the course of multiple lever actuations.<br>
TROCAR SLEEVE AND STOP-COCK VALVE CONSTRUCTION<br>
As mentioned above, the trocar sleeve 44 is composed of a trocar housing 16 and a trocar<br>
cannula 12 extending from the trocar housing 16. The trocar assembly 10 also includes a stop-cock<br>
valve 192 for allowing and preventing the passage of an insufflation fluid, e.g. carbon dioxide,<br>
through flexible tubing into a portion of the trocar housing 16 and the trocar cannula 12.<br>
With reference to the figures, the trocar cannula 12 and the trocar housing 16 are<br>
mechanically interfitted to form the trocar sleeve 44. At least a portion of the trocar cannula 12 sits<br>
within a second housing member base 38b of the second housing member 38 with a second housing<br>
member cover 38a sitting over the trocar cannula 12 for securing the at least a portion of the trocar<br>
cannula 12 within the second housing member base 38b.<br><br><br>
The trocar cannula 12 is sized so that when the trocar obturator 14 extends completely<br>
through it and beyond, insufflation fluid, which passes through the stop-cock valve 192 and the<br>
trocar housing 16, can pass through an annular opening created between the trocar cannula 12 and<br>
the trocar obturator 14 by the slightly greater size of the internal diameter of the trocar cannula 12 in<br>
relation to the outer diameter of the hollow shaft of the trocar obturator 14.<br>
The present invention provides a mechanism for mechanically assembling the trocar cannula<br>
12, trocar housing 16 and stop-cock valve 192 without the need for adhesive and/or curing<br>
techniques. In particular, the second housing member 38 of the trocar housing 16, trocar cannula<br>
12 and stop-cock valve 192 are formed as separate components that may be assembled in a<br>
convenient and reliable manner.<br>
More particularly, and with reference to Figures 17, 18, 19 and 20, a preferred embodiment<br>
of the mechanically assembled trocar sleeve 44 is disclosed. The trocar sleeve 44, when, fully<br>
assembled, comprises a stop-cock valve 192, a second housing member 38 composed of a second<br>
housing member cover 38a and a second housing member base 38b, and a trocar cannula 12. The<br>
various components of the trocar sleeve 44 are mechanically assembled by interfitting the<br>
components in a manner that is described below in greater detail. Briefly, the trocar cannula 12 fits<br>
within the second housing member base 38b with the stop-cock valve 192 positioned therebetween.<br>
The second housing member cover 38a fits over the stop-cock valve 192, second housing member<br>
base 38b and trocar cannula 12 to retain the various components together and provided a surface<br>
upon which the first housing member 36 may be selectively mounted.<br>
With regard to the specific components making up the trocar sleeve 44, and in accordance<br>
with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the stop-cock valve 192 includes alignment<br><br><br>
wings 194, a flow opening 196, and a valve lever 198. The valve lever 198 includes a stop latch 200.<br>
The second housing member cover 38a includes a hexagonal bore 202, a cover rim 204, and a<br>
second housing member cover seal 206. The second housing member base 38b includes friction<br>
posts 208, vanes 210, a housing rim 212, a clearance 214 for the stop-cock valve 192 and alignment<br>
wings 194. The second housing member base 38b further includes alignment ribs 216 and a latching<br>
face 218. The trocar cannula 12 includes an inlet nipple 220, alignment tabs 222, and a housing seal<br>
224.<br>
In practice, the stop-cock valve 192 is inserted into the clearance 214 of the second housing<br>
member base 38b. The trocar cannula 12 inserts through the opening of the second housing<br>
member base 38b. The alignment tabs 222 abut the vanes 210 securing the trocar cannula 12 in a<br>
desired orientation with respect to the second housing member base 38b once the trocar cannula 12<br>
is inserted into the second housing member base 38b.<br>
The cover rim 204 mates with the housing rim 212. The cover rim 204 also serves to hold<br>
the valve lever 198 on the stop-cock valve 192 as well as hold the stop-cock valve 192 with the valve<br>
lever 198 in position.<br>
The valve lever 198, in a maximum flow allowance position, i.e., fully open, has the stop<br>
latch 200 abut onto the latching face 218 of the second housing member base 38b. This means an<br>
operator of the valve lever 198 can sense when the valve lever 198 is in a fully open position by<br>
abutting latch face 218 and the valve lever 198 stays in the fully open position. The operator does<br>
not have to guess that the valve lever 198 is in the fully open position, and the valve lever 198 stays<br>
in the fully open position.<br><br><br>
The construction of the trocar assembly 44 eliminates the need for adhesives to join the<br>
stop-cock valve 192 and the second housing member cover 38a, and the second housing member<br>
base 38b and the trocar cannula 12. This is an advantage over prior art.<br>
Referring to Figures 21 and 22, an alternate trocar sleeve 44' is disclosed. In accordance<br>
with this alternate embodiment, the trocar sleeve 44' includes a stop-cock valve 192', a second<br>
housing member cover 38a', and a second housing member base 38b'. The trocar sleeve 44' also<br>
includes a trocar cannula 12' which is substantially similar to the trocar cannula 12 disclosed in<br>
accordance with the prior embodiment.<br>
The stop-cock valve 192' comprises a valve tube taper lock extension 226', a friction post<br>
228' and a valve lever 198'. The second housing member base 38b' comprises an extension<br>
clearance 230', and a faction post hexagonal bore 232'.<br>
The valve tube taper lock extension 226' of the stop-cock valve 192' locks into the extension<br>
clearance 230' of the second housing member base 38b'. The friction post 228' of the stop-cock<br>
valve 192' fits into the friction post hexagonal bore 230' of the second housing member base 38b',<br>
securing the vertical alignment of the stop-cock valve 192' with respect to the second housing<br>
member base 38b'.<br>
Referring to Figures 23 and 24, a further embodiment is disclosed. In accordance with this<br>
further embodiment, the trocar sleeve 44" comprises a second housing member cover 38a", a<br>
second housing member base 38b", and a stop-cock valve 192". The trocar sleeve 44" also includes<br>
a trocar cannula 12" which is substantially similar to the trocar cannula 12 disclosed in accordance<br>
with the prior embodiment.<br><br><br>
The stop-cock valve 192" comprises a locking groove boss 234", a valve tube extension<br>
236", and a locking groove 238". In addition, the second housing member cover 38a" includes a<br>
locking tongue 240". The second housing member base 38b" also comprises a valve tube extension<br>
aperture 242" and a boss clearance 244". The valve tube extension 236" of the stop-cock valve<br>
192" inserts and locks, by faction fit or taper-lock, into the valve rube extension aperture 242" of<br>
the second housing member base 38b". The locking groove boss. 234" of the stop-cock valve 192"<br>
locks into the boss clearance 244". This serves to assist in securing the stop-cock valve 192" in the<br>
second housing member base 38b".<br>
As mentioned above, the stop-cock valve 192 is mechanically coupled to the trocar sleeve 44<br>
via tapered surfaces shaped and dimensioned for factional engagement. As such, the outlet tube<br>
250 of the stop-cock valve 192 is formed with a tapered lock surface along the exterior of its distal<br>
end. Similarly, the trocar cannula 12 is formed with an inlet nipple 220, adapted for secure coupling<br>
with the tapered lock surface of the outlet tube 250 of the stop-cock valve 192. The tapered lock<br>
mechanical feature includes a self holding 2.0 degrees +/- 1.0 degrees angle, which is firmly seated<br>
into the trocar housing inlet nipple 220. The result of this mechanical connection is considerable<br>
frictional resistance to rotational and linear pull out forces.<br>
The mechanical lock discussed above may be enhanced by the provision of a dual<br>
redundancy feature. For example, the taper lock feature may be provided with a post and hex<br>
socket interlock, tongue and groove interlock and/or a snap fit interlock.<br>
In addition, and in accordance with the embodiment described above with reference to<br>
Figure 18, rotation of the stop-cock valve 192 is minimized by the inclusion of a retaining pin 204<br>
located on the second housing member cover 38a that extends downwardly into the aperture 256<br><br><br>
formed in the top of the valve lever 198. The retaining pin 204 stabilizes the stop-cock valve 192<br>
and prevents rotation as the valve lever 198 of the stop-cock valve 192 is actuated.<br>
As mentioned above, the trocar sleeve includes a stop-cock valve 192. The stop-cock valve<br>
192 is mounted within a recess formed in the trocar sleeve 44. As such, the stop-cock valve 192<br>
recessed within the outer surface of the second housing member base 38b, and ultimately the trocar<br>
housing 16. The valve lever 198 is further positioned above the body of the stop-cock valve 192;<br>
that is, the valve lever 198 used in actuating the stop-cock valve 192 is positioned on the top surface<br>
of the stop-cock valve 192 instead of underneath as with trocar assemblies currently in the<br>
marketplace. By positioning the valve lever 198 above the recessed stop-cock valve 192, the present<br>
trocar assembly 10 provides for the removal of the stop-cock valve 192 from a potentially<br>
obstructing view while simultaneously placing the valve lever 198 in a highly accessible position.<br>
Several advantages are achieved by recessing the stop-cock valve 192 within the body of the<br>
trocar sleeve 44. First, this orientation minimizes the obstructions, caused by users gripping the<br>
stop-cock valve 192 of the trocar assembly 10 for insertion. A more comfortable grip is, therefore,<br>
provided, as the stop-cock valve 192 no longer protrudes from the surface of the trocar housing 16.<br>
The present low profile stop-cock valve 192 structure further helps to prevent compromising<br>
desired hand positions. The present stop-cock valve 192 orientation also helps to prevent accidental<br>
manipulation during procedures. Accidental manipulation by movement of the trocar sleeve 44 into<br>
contact with a patient is a common occurrence that results in desufflation of the body cavity and can<br>
lead to frustrating and even dangerous situations when the medical professional's field of view is<br>
compromised.<br><br><br>
The advantages are further enhanced by forming the valve lever 198 with a curved surface<br>
substantially conforming to that of the trocar housing 16. In addition, the longitudinal axis along<br>
the handle portion of the valve lever 198 is offset from the pivot point about which the valve lever<br>
198 rotates so as to enhance recessing of the stop-cock valve 192. Controlled rotation of the valve<br>
lever 198 of the stop-cock valve 192 is achieved through the positioning of the stop-cock valve 192<br>
within a recess formed in the trocar sleeve 44, more specifically, the trocar housing 16. Specifically,<br>
and with reference to Figures 17, 18, 19 and 20, the valve lever 198 of the stop-cock valve 192<br>
includes a stop latch 200 located on the valve 198 which provides tactile feedback as to when the<br>
valve lever 198 is in the open position, i.e., the through holes located on the valve lever 198 and<br>
valve body 199 are aligned. The design feature resembles a cantilever beam located on the end of<br>
the valve lever 198 opposite the user end.<br>
As the valve lever 198 is rotated from the closed position to the open position within the<br>
trocar assembly 10, the cantilever rotational stop latch 200 contacts the trocar housing 16 providing<br>
tactile feedback that the valve lever 198 is in the fully opened position. In the fully opened position,<br>
the valve lever 198 and valve body 199 through holes are aligned allowing for optimal CO2 flow.<br>
The cantilever rotational stop latch 200 feature provides the surgeon with tactile feedback to<br>
ensure that the stop-cock valve 192 is in the open position. This will provide the optimal flow of<br>
CO2 flow throughout the surgical case.<br>
As those skilled in the art will appreciate, control of the valve lever 198 via the cantilever<br>
rotational stop latch 200 helps in alignment of the stop-cock valve 192 through hole 196.<br>
Misalignment of through holes 196 is commonly caused by lack of tactile feedback to the surgeon<br>
that the valve lever 198 is in the fully opened position.<br><br><br>
In addition, a strengthening gusset 264 is located on the backside of the cantilever rotational<br>
stop latch 260 to prevent over-rotation of the valve lever 198 by bending the valve lever 198. This<br>
can be seen in Figure 17 and 18. Over-rotation would create misalignment of the through holes.<br>
As those skilled in the art will certainly appreciate, the design described above offers many<br>
advantages over prior art assemblies. The separate trocar cannula 12 design described above<br>
provides for interchangeable outer housing capabilities. As such, the industrial design outside shape<br>
can be readily changed and updated without changing the internal structure of the trocar sleeve. In<br>
addition, assembly of the trocar cannula 12 to the trocar housing 16 joint system eliminates the need<br>
for ultrasonic welding. The present assembly method makes the device stronger by molding the<br>
trocar cannula 12 in one part. As those skilled in the art will certainly appreciate, prior designs<br>
utilized ultrasonic weld joints to assemble the trocar cannula 12 to the trocar housing 16. The<br>
present assembly structure eliminates the use of such joints and, therefore, provides no opportunity<br>
for failure of the ultrasonic weld joints.<br>
In addition, the trocar housing 16 is provided with crush ribs 266 along its internal surface.<br>
These crush ribs 266 center the trocar cannula 12 within the trocar housing 16. They also take up<br>
small variations in tolerances making the size of the trocar cannula 12 during manufacture less<br>
important and allowing for inherent variations during the molding process.<br>
The crush ribs 266 further prevent rotation of the trocar cannula 12 within the trocar<br>
housing 16. This is achieved as the crush ribs 266 extend into the sides of the trocar cannula 12<br>
thereby preventing relative rotation between the trocar cannula 12 and the trocar housing 16.<br>
Since the trocar housing 16 and trocar cannula 12 are rather simple in construction, the<br>
molding process is simplified by eliminating excessive core details on the injection mold tool. In<br><br><br>
addition, assembly of the system is easy as compared to prior designs as all of the components<br>
making up the sleeve assembly can be assembled in a top down manner.<br>
As to the stop-cock valve 192, the taper lock with dual redundant locking features helps to<br>
prevent the stop-cock valve 192 from falling off the trocar sleeve 44. In addition, the taper lock<br>
provides an airtight assembly without the use of adhesive or welding. In addition, the stop-cock<br>
valve 192 is provided with various lock surfaces preventing rotation of the stop-cock valve 192, for<br>
example, post and socket, tongue and groove, wings on ribs, etc. In addition to the taper lock<br>
features, the wings are trapped behind the trocar housing 16, eliminating the possibility for removal<br>
of the stop-cock valve 192 from the trocar sleeve 44. In addition, crush ribs 266 are utilized in<br>
holding the wings tight onto the trocar cannula 12. Finally, the low profile stop-cock valve 192<br>
structure with a valve lever 198 positioned above the stop-cock valve 192 allows for alignment of<br>
the stop-cock valve 192 to provide optimal air flow and offers usets a tactile feedback for optimizing<br>
alignment.<br>
While the preferred embodiments have been shown and described, it will be understood that<br>
there is no intent to limit the invention by such disclosure, but rather, is intended to cover all<br>
