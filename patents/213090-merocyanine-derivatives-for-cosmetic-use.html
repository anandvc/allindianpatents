The merocyanine compounds of formula (1) or (2) used in accordance with the invention are, in some cases, known compounds but also include novel compounds.<br><br><br>
The UV absorbers according to the present invention can be used either in the dissolved state (soluble organic filters, solubilised organic filters) or in the micronised state (nanoscalar organic filters, particulate organic filters, UV-absorber pigments).<br>
Any known process suitable for the preparation of microparticles can be used for the<br>
preparation of the micronised UV absorbers, for example:<br>
wet-milling (low-viscosity micronisation process for pumpable dispersions), with a hard grinding medium, for example zirconium silicate balls in a ball mill, and a protective surfactant or a protective polymer in water or in a suitable organic solvent; wet-kneading (high-viscosity micronisation process for non-pumpable pastes) using a continuous or discontinuous (batch) kneader. For a wet-kneading process, a solvent (water or cosmetically acceptable oils), a grinding aid (surfactant, emulsifier) and a polymeric grinding aid may be used.<br>
Both processes may be used preferably.<br>
spray-drying from a suitable solvent, for example aqueous suspensions or suspensions containing organic solvents, or true solutions in water, ethanol, dichloroethane, toluene or N-methylpyrrolidone etc..<br>
by expansion according to the RESS process (Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions) of supercritical fluids (e.g. CO2) in which the UV filter or filters is/are dissolved, or the expansion of liquid carbon dioxide together with a solution of one or moR6 UV filters in a suitable organic solvent;<br>
by reprecipitation from suitable solvents, including supercritical fluids (GASR process = Gas Anti-Solvent Recrystallisation / PCA process = Precipitation with Compressed Anti-solvents).<br><br><br><br>
The UV absorbers according to the present invention can also be used dry in powder form. For that purpose, the UV absorbers are subjected to known grinding methods, such as vacuum atomisation, countercurrent spray-drying etc.. Such powders have a particle size of from 0.1 micrometres to 2 micrometres. To avoid the occurrence of agglomeration, the UV absorbers can be coated with a surface-active compound prior to the pulverisation process, for example with an anionic, non-ionic or amphoteric surfactant, e.g. a phospholipid or a known polymer, such as PVP. an acrylate etc..<br>
The UV absorbers according to the present invention can also be used in specific carriers for cosmetics, for example in solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) or in inert sol-gel microcapsules wherein the UV absorbers are encapsulated.<br>
The cosmetic formulations or pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention can also comprise one or moR6 than one further UV filter as described in Tables 1-3.<br>
The cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations can be prepared by physically mixing the UV absorber(s) with the adjuvant using customary methods, for example by simply stirring together the individual components, especially by making use of the dissolution properties of already known cosmetic UV absorbers, for example octyl methoxycinnamate, salicylic acid isooctyl ester etc.. The UV absorber can be used, for example, without further treatment, or in the micronised state, or in the form of a powder.<br>
Cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations contain from 0.05 % to 40 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of one UV absorber or a mixtuR6 of UV absorbers.<br>
Preference is given to the use of mixing ratios of the UV absorber of formula (1) according to the present invention and optional further light-protective agents (as described in Tables 1-3) of from 1:99 to 99:1, especially from 1:95 to 95:1 and preferably from 10:90 to 90:10. based on weight. Of special interest are mixing ratios of from 20:80 to 80:20, especially from 40:60 to 60:40 and preferably approximately 50:50. Such mixtures can be used, inter alia, to improve solubility or increase UV absorption.<br><br>
The UV absorbers of formula (1) according to the present invention or combinations of UV . filters are useful for protecting skin, hair and/or natural or artificial hair colour.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Suitable UV filter substances which can additionally be used with the UV absorbers according to the present invention are any UV-A and UV-B filter substances.<br>
The cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations may be, for example, creams, gels, lotions, al¬coholic and aqueous/alcoholic solutions, emulsions, wax/fat compositions, stick preparations, powders or ointments. In addition to the above-mentioned UV filters, the cosmetic or pharma¬ceutical preparations may contain further adjuvants as described below.<br>
As water- and oil-containing emulsions (e.g. W/0, 0/W, OA/V/0 and W/O/W emulsions or mi-croemulsions) the preparations contain, for example, from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 15 % by weight and especially from 0.5 to 10 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of one or moR6 UV absorbers, from 1 to 60 % by weight, espec¬ially from 5 to 50 % by weight and preferably from 10 to 35 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one oil component, from 0 to 30 % by weight, especially from 1 to 30 % by weight und preferably from 4 to 20 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one emulsifier, from 10 to 90 % by weight, especially from 30 to 90 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of water, and from 0 to 88.9 % by weight, especially from 1 to 50 % by weight, of further cosmetically acceptable adju¬vants.<br>
The cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions/preparations according to the invention may also comprise one or one moR6 additional compounds as described below.<br>
Fattv alcohols<br>
Guerbet alcohols based on fatty alcohols having from 6 to 18, preferably from 8 to 10, carbon atoms, including cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, oleyl alcohol, octyldodecanol, benzoates of Cia-Cis alcohols, acetylated lanolin alcohol etc..<br>

Perfume oils<br>
TheR6 may be mentioned as perfume oils mixtures of natural and/or synthetic aromatic substances. Natural aromatic substances are. for example, extracts from blossom (lilies, lavender, roses, jasmine, neroli, ylang-ylang). from stems and leaves (geranium, patchouli, petitgrain), from fruit (aniseed, coriander, carraway, juniper), from fruit peel (bergamot, lemons, oranges), from roots (mace, angelica, celery, cardamom, costus, iris, calmus), from .wood (pinewood. sandalwood, guaiacum wood, cedarwood, rosewood), from herbs and grasses (tarragon, lemon grass, sage, thyme), from needles and twigs (spruce, pine. Scots pine, mountain pine), from resins and balsams (galbanum, elemi. benzoin, myrrh, olibanum, opoponax). Animal raw materials also come into consideration, for example civet and castoreum.

Preference is given to the use of bergamot oil, dihydromyrcenol, lilial, lyral, citronellol, phenyl ethyl alcohol, hexyl cinnamaldehyde, geraniol, benzyl acetone, cyclamen aldehyde, linalool, boisambrene forte, ambroxan, indole, hedione, sandelice, lemon oil, tangerine oil, orange oil, allyl amy! glycolate, cyclovertal, lavandin oil, muscatel sage oil, damascene, bourbon geranium oil, cyclohexyl salicylate, vertofix coeur, iso-E-Super, Fixolide NP, evernyl, iraldein gamma, phenylacetic acid, geranyl acetate, benzyl acetate, rose oxide, romillat, irotyl and floramat alone or in admixtuR6 with one another.<br>
Colorants<br>
TheR6 may be used as colorants the substances that are suitable and permitted for cosmetic purposes, as compiled, for example, in the publication "Kosmetische Farbemittel" of the Farbstoffkommission der Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft, Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, 1984, pages 81 to 106. The colorants are usually used in concentrations of from 0.001 to 0.1 % by weight, based on the total mixture.<br>
Other adjuvants<br>
It is furthermoR6 possible for the cosmetic preparations to comprise, as adjuvants, anti-foams, such as silicones, structurants, such as maleic acid, solubilisers, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol or diethylene glycol, opacifiers, such as latex, styrene/PVP or styrene/acrylamide copolymers, complexing agents, such as EDTA, NTA, alaninediacetic acid or phosphonic acids, propellants. such as propane/butane mixtures, N2O, dimethyl ether, CO2, N2 or air, so-called coupler and developer components as oxidation dye precursors, reducing agents, such as thioglycolic acid and derivatives thereof, thiolactic acid, cysteamine, thiomalic acid or mercaptoethanesulfonic acid, or oxidising agents, such as hydrogen peroxide, potassium bromate or sodium bromate.<br><br>
Suitable insect repellents are, for example, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, 1,2-pentanediol or insect repellent 3535; suitable self-tanning agents are, for example, dihydroxyacetone and/or erythrulose or dihydroxy acetone and/or dihydroxy acetone precursors as described in WO 01/85124 and/or erythrulose.<br>
Polymeric beads or hollow spheres as SPF enhancers<br>
The combination of the UV-absorbers and UV-absorber combinations, listed above, with SPF enhancers, such as non-active ingredients like styrene/acrylate copolymers, silica beads, spheroidal magnesium silicate, crosslinked polymethylmethacrylates (PMMA; Micopearl M305 Seppic), can maximize the UV protection of the sun products. Hollow-spheR6 additives (Sunspheres® ISP, Silica Shells Kobo.) deflect radiation and the effective path length of the photon is therefoR6 increased (EP 0 893 119). Some beads, as mentioned previously, provide a soft feel during spreading. Moreover, the optical activity of such beads, e.g. Micropearl M305, can modulate skin-shine by eliminating reflection phenomena and may indirectly scatter the UV light.<br>
