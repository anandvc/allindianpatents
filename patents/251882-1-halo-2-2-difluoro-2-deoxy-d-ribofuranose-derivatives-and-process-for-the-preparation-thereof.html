				<td>L-α-HALO-2,2-DH^LUORO-2-DEOXY-D-RIBOFURANOSE DERIVATIVES AND PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel l-a-halo-2,2-difluoro-2-deoxy-D-ribofuranose derivative, and a process for the preparation thereof which is useful as an intermediate in the production of gemcitabine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Gemcitabine of formula (A), a medicament for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is a synthetic nucleoside analogue having a cytosine nucleobase stereochemically oriented upward to the p-direction at C-l of the ribofuranose backbone.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Gemcitabine may be conventionally prepared from a lactol compound as shown in Reaction Scheme 1 via an activated ribofuranose intermediate having a reactive leaving group:<br><br>
Reaction Scheme 1<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein, P1 is a hydroxy protecting group, and L is a leaving group.<br>
Specifically, gemcitabine may be prepared by la) introducing a reactive leaving group (L) into C-l of the ribofuranose ring of a lactol compound (B) to obtain an activated ribofuranose intermediate (C), and Ib) glycosylating the compound of formula (C) with cytosine to form an N-glycosidic bond.<br>
In Reaction Scheme 1, glycosylarion step Ib) undergoes via a bimolecular (S&gt;i2) mechanism of nucleophilic substitution, and thus, it is important in the preparation of gemcitabine to obtain a high purity a-anomer of the compound (C) having the leaving group (L) oriented down. Accordingly. many attempts have been made to develop a process for stereoselectively introducing a leaving group (L) into C-l of the ribofuranose ring of the lactol compound (B).<br>
For example, U.S. patent Nos. 4,526,988 and 5,453,499 disclose an activated ribofuranose intermediate such as 1-a-halo-ribofuranose having a halo leaving group introduced at C-l of the ribofuranose ring. Specifically. U.S. patent No. 4,526,988 describes a method for preparing a 1-a-halo-ribofuranose derivative of formula (F) by 2a) reacting the 1 -hydroxy group of a lactol compound of formula (D) with an acetyl source such as acetic anhydride to obtain a 1 -acetate derivative of formula (E), and 2b) reacting the 1 -acetate derivative of formula (E) with gaseous HBr or HC1 to obtain a 1-halo<br>
ribofuranose, as shown in Reaction Scheme 2:<br>
Reaction Scheme 2<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein, R' is a hydroxy protecting group, Ac is acetyl, and X is Br or Cl.<br>
However, this process gives a low yield of the desired a-halo anomer due to its low stereoselectivity.<br>
US Patent No. 5.453,499 discloses a process for preparing an a-enriched 1-halo ribofuranose of formula (H) having an a:^ ratio of 9:1 to 10:1 by reacting a (3-sulfonate compound of formula (G) with a halide source in an inert solvent, as shown in Reaction Scheme 3:<br>
Reaction Scheme 3<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
wherein, P" is a hydroxy protecting group such as benzoyl, R" is sulfonate, and Y is halogen.<br>
However, the 1-sulfonate compound of formula (G) used as a starting material in this process, prepared via a lactol compound by the method<br>
described in US Patent No. 5,401,861, has an <b ratio of about and therefore the overall stereoselectiviry for anomer is only></b>
Further, the prior 1-a-halo-furanoses having the 3- and 5-hydroxy groups protected, e.g., by benzoyl groups, exist in an oily state which is more difficult to handle and store than a solid form, besides the fact that an uneconomical column chromatography process is required for its isolation from a mixture of a- and B-anomers. Therefore, there has been a need to develop an improved process for preparing gemcitabine using an a-halo-furanose as an intermediate.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a novel 1-a-halo-D-ribofuranose derivative in a solid form, which can be purified using a simple purification procedure such as recrystallization suitable for mass-production.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a highly stereoselective method for preparing said compound in a high purity and yield.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a compound which can be used as an intermediate in said method.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a l-a-halo-2,2-difluoro-2-deoxy-D-ribofuranose derivative of formula (I) in a solid form:<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
wherein,<br><br>
R is benzoyl or<br>
R2 is hydrogen, cyano, halogen, carboalkoxy, nitro, Q.2 alkoxy. C\.2 alkyl or dialkylamino; and<br>
X is Cl, Br or I.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for preparing the l-a-halo-2,2-difluoro-2-deoxy-D-ribofuranose derivative of formula (I), comprising the steps of<br>
(i) reducing a 1-oxoribose compound of formula (II) to obtain a lactol compound of formula (ni);<br>
(ii) reacting the compound of formula (III) with a halophosphate compound of formula (IV) in the presence of a base to obtain a 1-phosphate furanose derivative of formula (V); and<br>

(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein, R1, R2 and X have the same meanings as defined above; and R3 is methyl, ethyl or phenyl, preferably phenyl.<br>
In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention, there is jrovided a novel 1-phosphate furanose derivative of formula (V) which can be idvantageously used as an intermediate in the preparation of the 1 -a-halo-D-ibofuranose derivative of formula (I):<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 (V) wherein, R1, R2 and R3 have the same meanings as defined above.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The term "anomer-enriched" used herein means an anomer mixture having a specific anomer content of greater than 50 %, preferably a substantially pure anomer.<br>
Among the compounds of formula (I) of the present invention, preferred are those wherein R2 is hydrogen.<br>
The inventive ribofuranose derivative of formula (I) is characterized by having a 3-hydroxy group protected with a biphenylcarbonyl group. Also, the inventive derivative may have a biphenylcarbonyl group as the 5-hydroxy protecting group.<br>
Thus, the inventive 1-a-halo ribofuranose derivative can be obtained as a solid and, accordingly, it can be easily purified in a high purity of 99.5 % or more by a simple purification procedure such as recrystallization.<br>
Also, the inventive 1-a-halo-ribofuranose derivative of formula (I) may<br><br>
be coupled with cytosine by a conventional glycosylation reaction to prepare gemcitabine having the cytosine moiety at C-l of the ribofuranose ring oriented up (^-configuration).<br>
In the preparation of gemcitabine via glycosylation step using a 1-halo ribofuranose derivative, the purity of the a-halo anomer is very important. If the content of the p-halo anomer increases, the stereoselectivity of the glycosylation reaction markedly decreases, leading to a low yield of the desired p-nucleoside, gemcitabine.<br>
Accordingly, gemcitabine may be prepared effectively by performing glycosylation using the inventive a-halo compound having a high pVa-anomer ratio of 4 to 14, which is markedly higher relatively to the conventional methods (the f3-/a-anomer ratio is 2 to 3).<br>
The inventive method for preparing the 1-a-halo furanose derivative of fonnula (I) is described in Reaction Scheme 4.<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein, R , R , RJ and X have the same meanings as defined above.<br>
In Reaction Scheme 4, the l-halo-2,2-difluoro-2-deoxy-D-ribofuranose derivatrive of fonnula (I) may be prepared in a form having an high a-anomer content of 99.5 % or more by (i) reducing the 1-oxoribose compound of<br>
-   9   -<br>
formula (II) according to a conventional method to obtain the lactol compound of formula (HI), a mixture of a- and (3-anomers; (ii) reacting the compound of formula (HI) with a halo phosphate compound of formula (TV) in the presence of a base to obtain the p1-enriched 1-phosphate furanose of formula (V) having a pYa ratio of 10 or more; and (iii) reacting the compound of formula (V) with a halide source to obtain the compound of formula (I).<br>
The use of the novel furanose intermediates of formula (V) having a phosphate leaving group is the unique feature of the inventive method for preparing the 1-halo ribofaranose of formula (I) having a high a-anomer content.<br>
Thus, in step (ii) for preparing the phosphate furanose of formula (V) from the lactol compound of formula (III), the f3-phosphate anomer can be obtained with a high (3/a ratio of greater than 10. Also, the subsequent step (iii) can be performed continuously without isolating the intermediate to obtain the a-halo furanose of formula (I) with a high a/(3 ratio of at least 10.<br>
Further, in accordance with the present invention, the a-halo-furanose is obtained as a solid when a biphenylcarbonyl group is adopted as the 3- and'or 5-hydroxy protecting groups of the ribofuranose ring, and the solid form can be easily purified to an enantiomer purity of 99.5 % or more using a simple purification process, which makes it possible to prepare the desired (3-nucleoside having a high (3/a ratio of 4 to 14. Such a high (Vet ratio is markedly higher than the (3/a ratio of 2 to 3 achievable in the conventional methods.<br>
Specifically, in step (i) of the Reaction Scheme 4, the lactol compound of formula (IE) may be prepared by reducing the compound of formula (II) with a reducing agent, as described in US patent Nos. 4,526,988 and 5,464,826. The 1-oxoribose compound of formula (II) used as the starting material in step (i) may be prepared by a method comprising the steps of protecting the 3-<br><br>
hydroxy group of a compound of formula (VI) with a biphenylcarbonyl protecting group, followed by hydrolyzing the resulting product in the presence of abase to obtain a 3R-carboxylate enantiomer of formula (VII):<br><br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein, R2 has the same meaning as defined above, R4 is methyl or ethyl, R3 is C\.$ alkyl, and M is NH4. sodium or potassium.<br>
The solvent suitable for use in step (i) is tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether or dioxane; and the reducing agent may be lithium aluminum hydride, diisobutyl aluminum hydride or lithium tri-ie7^-butoxyaluminohydride, preferably lithium tri-fert-butoxyalurninohydride; and the reduction may be conducted at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours after the addition of the reducing agent at -50 to"
hi this reduction step (i), the lactol compound of formula (III) is obtained as a 1:1 to 2:1 mixture of a- and |3-anomers; and the next step (ii) may be conducted after isolating each anomer obtained hi step (i), or conducted as is without such an isolating process.<br>
In step (ii), the 1-phosphate furanose of formula (V) may be prepared by reacting the compound of formula (HI) with the halophosphate compound of formula (IV) in the presence of a base to obtain the (3-enriched compound of formula (V) having a P/a ratio of 10 or more. In this step, the phosphate<br><br>
leaving group used may be dimethylphosphate, diethylphosphate, or diphenylphosphate, preferably diphenylphosphate.<br>
ill<br>
Step (iii) may be conducted after isolating the desired f3-anomer obtained in step (ii) by recrystallization using a solvent such as water, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, ethyl acetate and a mixture thereof, preferably isopropanol or a water-isopropanol mixture. This step may also be conducted with the crude product of step (ii) without such an isolating process.<br>
The halophosphate compound of formula (IV) may be used in an amount ranging from 1.1 to 1.5 molar equivalents based on the lactol compound of formula (IH). The compound of formula (IV) is commercially available or may be easily prepared in accordance with the conventional procedures<br>
-.t<br>
disclosed in Biochem. Preps., 1, 50 (1951) or J. Chem. Soc., 2921 (1949). Step (ii) can be facilitated by the addition of a catalyst such as 4-dimethylaminopyridine or 4-pyrrolidinopyridine.<br>
Also, the base used for neutralizing the acid produced in step (ii) may be selected from the group consisting of pyridine, triethylamine, tributylamine, diisopropylethylamine and methylpiperidine, preferably triethylamine, which may be used in an amount ranging from 1.2 to 2.0 molar equivalents based on the lactol compound of formula (HI). The solvent used in step (ii) may be benzene, toluene, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, methylene chloride or chloroform, preferably toluene, and which is carried out at -25 to 50 °C for 2 to 10 hours.<br>
Further, in step (iii), the highly pure a-anomer of formula (I) of 99.5 % or more (i.e., the (3-anomer content of less than 0.5 %) may be obtained by reacting the 1-phosphate furanose of formula (V) with a halide source, followed by recrystallizing the resulting product.<br>
The halide source which can be used in step (iii) includes HCl/acetic acid, HBr/acetic acid, HBr/propionic acid, a trialkylsilyl halide, a lithium<br>
halide, a sodium halide, a cesium halide, a potassium halide, tetraalkylammonium halide and a mixture thereof; among which 30% HBr/acetic acid, 30% HBr/propionic acid, tetrabutylammonium iodide, tetrabutylammonium bromide, trimethylsilyl iodide, trimethylsilyl bromide, trimethylsilyl chloride and a trimethylsilyl chloride-lithium bromide mixture are preferred. Such a halide source is employed in an amount ranging from 5 to 30 molar equivalents, preferably from 10 to 20 molar equivalents, based on the compound of formula (V).<br>
In case of using 1.0 M HCl/acetic acid, 30% HBr/acetic acid or 30% HBr/propionic acid as the halide source, it is used as a neat state, while the other halide sources may be used in a form diluted with a solvent such as methylene chloride, dibromoethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, THF, 1,4-dioxane, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide or N,N-dimethylacetamide.<br>
Step (iii) may be conducted in a solvent such as methylene chloride, dibromoethane, dichloroethane or chloroform at a temperature in the range of 0 to 50 °C, preferably 10 to 30 °C for 30 minutes to 24 hours.<br>
The resulting 1-halo ribofuranose is a mixture of a- and p-anomers having an o/p ratio of at least 10 and the desired a-halo anomer may be isolated form the mixture by recrystallization using a solvent such as methalol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetonitrile, water or a mixture thereof, preferably isopropanol or a isopropanol-water mixture, to obtain the 1-a-halo ribofuranose in a high purity of 99.5 % or more.<br>
The inventive method for preparing the 1-a-halo furanose of formula (I) using the 1-phosphate furanose of formula (V) as an intermediate gives a total yield of 65 to 75 %, which is markedly higher than that achievable by the conventional method (total yield of about 45 %).<br>
