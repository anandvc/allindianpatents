	The present application claims priority from provisional application serial no.<br>
60/759,700, entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR UPLINK RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN A FREQUENCY DIVISION MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM," filed January 18, 2006, which is commonly owned and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to Single Carrier and Multi-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) communication systems, and, in particular, to uplink power control and bandwidth allocation in Single Carrier and Multi-Carrier FDMA communication systems.<br>
	Background of the Invention<br>
Single Carrier and Multi-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) communication systems, such as IFDMA, DFT-SOFDMA, and OFDMA communication systems, have been proposed for use in 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) and 3GPP2 Evolution communication systems for transmission of<br>
 data over an air interface. In Single Carrier and Multi-Carrier FDMA communication systems, a frequency bandwidth is split into multiple contiguous frequency sub-bands, or sub-carriers, that are transmitted simultaneously. A user may then be assigned one or more of the frequency sub-bands for an exchange of user information, thereby permitting multiple users to transmit simultaneously on the different sub-carriers.<br>
 These sub-carriers are orthogonal to each other, and thus intra-cell interference is reduced.<br>
To maximize the spectral efficiency, a frequency reuse factor of one has been<br>
proposed for both a downlink and an uplink in Single Carrier and Multi-Carrier<br>
FDMA communication systems. With a frequency reuse factor of one, data and<br>
control channels in one sector/cell will likely experience interference from other<br><br>
	2A<br>
sectors/cells. This is especially true for user equipment (UEs) at the edge of a cell or at bad coverage locations. Therefore, letting each UE in a sector or cell transmit at full power on the uplink results in very poor edge performance. On the other hand, implementation of a traditional power control scheme, wherein each UE in a sector or cell or cell transmits at an uplink power that results in a same received power at a radio access network for each such UE, suffers from a low overall spectral efficiency due to a lack of UEs that can transmit at high data rates.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for resource allocation scheme that results in a better tradeoff between the cell-edge performance and the overall spectral efficiency.<br>

	The present invention may be more fully described with reference to FIGs. 1-<br>
6. FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a wireless communication system 100 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Communication system 100 includes multiple user equipment (UEs) 102, 104 (two shown), such as but not limited to a cellular telephone, a radio telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA) with radio<br>
frequency (RF) capabilities, or a wireless modem that provides RF access to digital terminal equipment (DTE) such as a laptop computer. Communication system 100 further includes a radio access network (RAN) 120 that provides communication services to each UE, such as UEs 102 and 104, residing in a coverage area 118, such as a cell or a sector, of the RAN via an air interface 110. RAN 120 includes a<br>
transceiver 122, such as a Node B or a Base Transceiver Station (BTS), in wireless communication with each of the multiple UEs 102, 104 and further includes a<br>
network controller 128, such as a Radio Network Controller (RNC) or a Base Station Controller (BSC), coupled to the transceiver. Air interface 110 comprises a downlink 112 and an uplink 114. Each of downlink 112 and uplink 114 comprises multiple physical communication channels, including at least one signaling channel and at least one traffic channel.<br>
Transceiver 122 and controller 128 each includes a respective processor 124, 130, such as one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors (DSPs), combinations thereof or such other devices known to those having ordinary skill in the art. The particular operations/functions of processors 124 and 130, and<br>
respectively thus of transceiver 122 and controller 128, are determined by an execution of software instructions and routines that are stored in a respective at least one memory device 126, 132 associated with the processor, such as random access memory (RAM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and/or read only memory (ROM) or equivalents thereof, that store data and programs that may be executed by<br>
the corresponding processor.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a user equipment (UE) 200, such as UEs 102 and 104, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. UE 200 includes a processor 202, such as one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors (DSPs), combinations thereof or such other devices known to those having<br>
ordinary skill in the art. The particular operations/functions of processor 202, and respectively thus of UE 200, is determined by an execution of software instructions and routines that are stored in a respective at least one memory device 204 associated with the processor, such as random access memory (RAM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and/or read only memory (ROM) or equivalents thereof, that store<br>
data and programs that may be executed by the corresponding processor.<br>
The embodiments of the present invention preferably are implemented within UEs 102 and 104 and RAN 120. More particularly, the functionality described herein as being performed by UEs 102 and 104 are implemented with or in software programs and instructions stored in the respective at least one memory device 204 of 30the UE and executed by an associated processors 202 of the UE. In addition, the functionality described herein as being performed by RAN 120 may be implemented<br>

However, one of ordinary skill in the art realizes that the embodiments of the present invention alternatively may be implemented in hardware, for example, integrated circuits (ICs), application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and the like, such as ASICs implemented in one or more of UEs 102 and 104, transceiver 122, and controller 128. Based on the present disclosure, one skilled in the art will be readily capable of producing and implementing such software and/or hardware without undo experimentation.<br>
Communication system 100 comprises a wideband packet data communication system that employs a Single Carrier or a Multi-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) air interface technology, wherein a frequency bandwidth is split into<br>
multiple frequency sub-bands, or subcarriers, that comprise the physical layer channels over which traffic and signaling channels are transmitted simultaneously. A user may then be assigned one or more of the frequency sub-bands for an exchange of user information, thereby permitting multiple users to transmit simultaneously on the different sub-carriers. Further, communication system 100 preferably operates in<br>
accordance with the 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) E-UTRA (Evolutionary UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access) standards, which standards specify wireless telecommunications system operating protocols, including radio system parameters and call processing procedures. However, those who are of ordinary skill in the art realize that communication system 100 may operate in accordance with any<br>
 wireless telecommunication system employing a frequency division multiplexing scheme or a time and frequency division multiplexing scheme, wherein a sub-band comprises a frequency sub-band or a time and frequency sub-band, such as a 3GPP2 (Third Generation Partnership Project 2) Evolution communication system, for example, a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) 2000 1XEV-DV communication<br>
 system, a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) communication system as described by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 8O2.xx standards, for<br><br>
8 <br>
example, the 802.1 la/HiperLAN2, 802.1 lg, 802.16, or 802.21 standards, or any of multiple proposed ultrawideband (UWB) communication systems.<br>
In order to optimize system performance at the edges of a coverage area, communication system 100 provides uplink fractional power control and minimum bandwidth allocation. That is, at any given time and for a given coverage area associated with a RAN, such as coverage area 118 and RAN 120, communication system 100 allocates an uplink transmit power to each UE, such as UEs 102 and 104, engaged in a communication session in the coverage area that is designed to provide acceptable received power at the RAN while minimizing interference among all such UEs and UEs in adjacent coverage areas (not shown). In addition, for any given Transmission Time Interval (TTI), the RAN, that is, RAN 120, determines and allocates a minimum amount of bandwidth to each UE 102, 104 engaged in a communication session that is sufficient to provide acceptable service to the UE based on measured channel conditions.<br>
	Referring now to FIG. 3, a logic flow diagram 300 is provided that depicts a<br>
method of uplink resource allocation, and in particular uplink power control, executed by communication system 100 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Logic flow diagram 300 begins (302) when RAN 120 determines (304) a channel condition in association with each UE 102, 104 serviced by the RAN and<br>
 active in the coverage area of the RAN. In one embodiment of the present invention, each UE 102, 104 may measure a downlink channel condition, preferably measuring Channel Quality Information (CQI) as is known in the art, associated with each sub-band of a bandwidth employed by communication system 100 to produce a plurality of downlink channel measurements. One of ordinary skill in the art realizes that many<br>
 parameters may be measured in determining channel quality and that any such parameter may be used herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. As is known in the art, each UE 102, 104 measures channel conditions for each and every sub-band during a measuring period, such as a Transmission Time Interval (TTI) (also known as a sub-frame) or a radio frame<br>
 transmission period. Each UE of the multiple UEs 102, 104 then reports the measured channel conditions for all of the sub-bands to serving RAN 120, and in particular to a<br><br>
 transceiver of the RAN, that is, transceiver 122, preferably in a Channel Quality<br>
Information (CQI) message. Each UE of the multiple UEs 102, 104 may further store the UE's downlink channel condition measurements.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, RAN 120 may measure an<br>
uplink channel condition for each UE 102, 104 serviced by the RAN based on uplink<br>
transmissions received from the UE, such as an uplink pilot signal, an uplink control<br>
signal, or an uplink traffic signal. One of ordinary skill in the art realizes that there<br>
are many ways for a RAN to determine channel conditions associated with a UE<br>
serviced by the RAN, and any such method may be used herein without departing<br>
from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
Based on the channel condition measurements associated with each UE 102, 104, communication system 100 determines (306) a fractional path loss for each UE 102, 104. That is, RAN 120 determines a path loss (L) for each of UEs 102, 104 and ranks the UEs based on their determined path losses. Typically, path loss L is<br>
 determined as a ratio of transmit power to received power. For example, RAN may determine a path loss for a UE by averaging path losses associated with each of the sub-bands measured and reported by the UE. However, other algorithms will occur to one of ordinary skill in the art for determining a path loss to be used in ranking a UE, such as using a best path loss or a worst path loss reported by the UE, which<br>
 algorithms may be used herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Based on the rankings, RAN 120 then determines a path loss of a UE that is ranked at a predetermined percentile in the rankings to produce a path loss threshold, that is, a path loss of a UE whose path loss is at the xth-percentile level (Lx. ,ie). RAN 120 then compares the actual path loss of the UE (Z) to the path loss<br>
 threshold to determine a fractional path loss for the UE, for example, LX-t/e/L.<br>
For each UE of the multiple reporting UEs 102, 104, communication system 100, preferably RAN 120, determines (308) an uplink transmit power level for the UE based on the fractional path loss determined with respect to the UE. RAN 120 may then assign the determined uplink transmit power level to each such UE and inform the UE of the assigned uplink transmit power level. Each UE of the multiple UEs 102, 104 then transmits (310) data to RAN 120, and RAN 120 receives the data from<br><br>
10<br>
the UE, via uplink 114 of air interface 110 and at the uplink power level determined for the UE until a next uplink power level update period (when logic flow diagram 300 returns to step 304). Logic flow 300 then ends (312). However, in another embodiment of the present invention, RAN 120 may determine a path loss threshold, 5that is, a path loss of a UE whose path loss is at the xth-percentage level (Lx-t/e), and inform each UE 102, 104 serviced by the RAN of the path loss threshold by broadcasting the path loss threshold in coverage area 118. In response to receiving Lx-i/e, each UE 102, 104 may store the parameter in the at least one memory device 204 of the UE and then self-determine, at steps 306 and 308, the fractional path loss and the uplink transmit power based on the downlink channel conditions measured by the UE and the stored path loss threshold Lx-i/e.<br>
At step 308, and for each UE 102, 104, RAN 120 determines, or the UE self-determines, an uplink transmit power level, Pt, for the UE based on the UE's maximum transmit power level for transmissions on uplink 114, Pmax, and a fractional<br>
power control parameter, FPC, associated with the UE. The fractional power control parameter, Fpc, corresponds to a fraction, or portion, of the UE's maximum transmit power level that the UE is assigned for transmissions on uplink 114 and is based on the fractional path loss associated with the UE. More particularly, RAN 120 determines a uplink transmit power level, Ph for each UE 102, 104, or each UE 102,<br>
 104 self-determines an uplink transmit power level Pt, based on the following formulas, which formulas are maintained in the at least one memory device 204 of UE 102 and/or in the at least one memory device 126, 132 of transceiver 122 and/or controller 128,<br>
Pt = Pmax x Fpc , where Fpc = min{1, max[Rmm, (LX-i/e/L)" ]} .<br>
	Rmm is a minimum power reduction ratio, that is, a ratio of a minimum uplink<br>
transmit power level of a UE in communication system 100 to Pmax. A value corresponding to Rmm is up to a designer of communication system 100 and is designed to prevent UEs experiencing good path loss, that is, a minimal path loss, from being required to transmit at too low a power level. For example, if it is desired<br>
 that the minimum uplink transmit power of a UE not be less than one-tenth (1/10) of Pmax, then Rmm = .1. Again, the ratio LX-i/e/L corresponds to a fractional path loss<br>
11<br>
experienced by a UE, that is, the ratio LX-i/e/L is a comparison of the actual path loss experienced by the UE (L) to a path loss threshold, preferably the path loss of a UE at the Xth percentile (Lx-i/e) of all UEs serviced by RAN 120, or an 'x-percentile path loss.' 'Z' is determined based on a downlink channel quality measured by the UE and/or an 5uplink channel quality measured by RAN 120. Preferably, L includes path loss resulting from shadowing and slow fading but does not include path loss resulting from fast fading. Lx-ie is a path loss of a UE at the Xth percentile of all UEs serviced by RAN 120. For example, if "x-i/e = 5, that is, the 5th percentile (5 %-ile), then when all UEs serviced by RAN 120 are ranked based on path loss, Lx-ie is a path loss of a 10UE at the 5th percentile (from the bottom) of all of the ranked UEs. A result is that all UEs whose path loss L is greater than Lx-i/e (the bottom 5% when 'x-ile' = 5) may transmit at Pmax, while UEs whose path loss L is less than Lx-i/e may each transmit at a power level that is based on the comparison of their path loss L to the path loss threshold, that is, Lx-i/e.<br>
	The parameter 'a ' corresponds to how much of a UE's path loss, for the<br>
bottom V percent of UEs, communication system 100 wants to compensate for by upward adjusting the uplink transmit power of the UE. Preferably, 'a ' is determined by an operator of communication system 100 and is maintained in the respective at least one memory device 126, 132 of transceiver 122 and/or controller 128. RAN 120<br>
 may then use 'a ' to determine P, or may broadcast 'a ' to the UEs 102, 104 serviced by the RAN so that the UEs may determine P,. In another embodiment of the present invention, the operator of communication system 100 may pre-program 'a ' into the at least one memory device 204 of each of UEs 102 and 104. Typically, 1 &gt; a &gt; 0. When a = 0, then all UEs serviced by RAN 120 may transmit at full power (Pt = Pmax)<br>
 and UEs in the coverage area of RAN 120 are likely to experience high interference levels from the other UEs in the coverage area and poor edge performance, for example, due to the high uplink transmit power levels of UEs closer to RAN 120. When a = 1, then all UEs serviced by RAN 120 may transmit at an uplink power level that results in the same received power at RAN 120, resulting in poor spectral<br>
 efficiency. Experiments have shown that setting a = 1/2 results in good edge coverage and high spectral efficiency. By setting a = 1/2, UEs experiencing good path loss<br><br>
	12<br>
generally end up transmitting at relatively low power levels to reduce interference levels and, at the same time, these UEs are received by a serving RAN at relatively high power levels to achieve high spectral efficiency.<br>
Since users at the edge of a coverage area, such as users at the edge of<br>
coverage area 118, are likely to be transmit power limited, communication system 100<br>
further implements a minimized transmission bandwidth resource allocation scheme<br>
to work with the fractional power control scheme to achieve a level of performance<br>
desired for uplink transmissions in 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) and<br>
3GPP2 Evolution communication systems. By reducing a UE's bandwidth, the power<br>
per sub-band for the UE may be effectively boosted, thereby providing edge users<br>
with improved performance and a better chance to transmit while enhancing overall<br>
spectral efficiency.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4, a logic flow diagram 400 is depicted of a method of uplink resource allocation, and in particular bandwidth resource allocation, executed<br>
 by communication system 100 in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Logic flow diagram 400 begins (402) when RAN 120 determines (404) a channel condition in association with each UE 102, 104 serviced by the RAN and active in the coverage area of the RAN. In one embodiment of the present invention, each UE 102, 104 may measure a downlink channel condition, preferably measuring<br>
 Channel Quality Information (CQI) as is known in the art, associated with each sub-band of a bandwidth employed by communication system 100 and report the measured channel conditions for all of the sub-bands to serving RAN 120, and in particular to a transceiver of the RAN, that is, transceiver 122, preferably in a Channel Quality Information (CQI) message. In another embodiment of the present invention,<br>
 RAN 120 may measure an uplink channel condition for each UE 102, 104 serviced by the RAN based on uplink transmissions received from the UE, such as an uplink pilot signal, an uplink control signal, or an uplink traffic signal. One of ordinary skill in the art realizes that there are many ways for a RAN to determine channel conditions associated with a UE serviced by the RAN, and any such method may be used herein<br>
 without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Based on the channel condition measurements, RAN 120, and in particular transceiver 122,<br><br>
13<br>
determines (406) a path loss for each UE 102, 104, such as UE 102. While references below may be to UE 102, one of ordinary skill in the art realizes that RAN 120 makes similar determinations with respect to UE 104 and UE 104 performs similar functions to the functions described below with respect to UE 102.<br>
	Based on the path loss determined for UE 102, RAN 120 determines (408) a<br>
fraction, or portion, of the maximum uplink transmit power, Pmax, that UE 102 can transmit at (Fpc) and further determines (410) an uplink transmit power level per sub-band for the UE (Pt_per_sub_band)- Preferably, RAN 120 determines Fpc and Pt_per_sub_band based on the following formulas which are maintained in the at least one memory device 126, 132 of one or more of transceiver 122 and controller 128,<br>
Fpc = min{ 1, max[Rmin, (Lx/i/e/L)" ] ,<br>
Pt_per_sub_band = Pmax x min(1/NSUB,, FPC), and<br>
Where Fpc is a fractional power control parameter as described above in greater detail, Rmin, Lx-i/e L, a , and Pmax are determined as described above with respect to logic flow diagram 300, NTOT is the total number of sub-bands in a given bandwidth, and NSUB is the number of sub-bands in the given bandwidth available for assignment.<br>
Based on the determined uplink transmit power level per sub-band (Pt_per_sub_ band), RAN 120 then determines (412) a supportable data rate, R, for UE 102, assuming that the UE is allocated all available sub-bands. Based on the determined supportable 20data rate, R, RAN 120 then determines (414), for UE 102, a minimum bandwidth for allocation to the UE that will support the determined supportable data rate,i?, with an acceptable level of performance, that is, of signal degradation. That is, RAN 120 determines, for UE 102,<br>
NASSIGN = arg min{NSUB ³ n³ 1½½ | can support R with less than d dB<br>
degradation}where NASSIGN corresponds to a minimum bandwidth for allocation to the UE that will<br>
support data rate R with less than a d dB degradation in performance. The acceptable<br>
degradation in performance, that is, d dB, is up to the designer of system 100. As<br>
one ordinary skill in the realizes, the fewer the number of sub-bands allocated to a UE<br><br>
14<br>
while maintaining a data rate R, the greater the degradation in performance and the<br>
lower the quality of service. The supportable data rate, R, and the minimum bandwidth that may be allocated to a UE that will support the determined supportable data rate, R, may be determined based tables containing the results of system throughput simulations or based on curves or equations that are, in turn, based on simulated or empirical evidence, which tables, curves, or equations are maintained in the respective at least one memory device 126, 132 of transceiver 122 and/or controller 128.<br>
Based on the determined minimum bandwidth for allocation to UE 102 that will support data rate R with less than a ' d' dB degradation in performance, RAN 120 then re-determines, that is, re-calculates, (416) the uplink transmit power level per sub-band for UE 102, that is, recalculates Pt_per_sub_band, to produce a recalculated power level per sub-band, PASSIGN- Preferable, PASSIGN is determined based on the following formula,<br>
	PASSIGN = Pmax x min {1 /N ASSIGN , FPC} .<br>
RAN 120 then conveys (418) NASSIGN and PASSIGN to UE 102. UE 102 stores (420) NASSIGN and PASSIGN in the at least one memory device 204 of the UE and then transmits (422) data to RAN 120, and RAN 120 receives the data from UE 102, via uplink 114 of air interface 110 and based on NASSIGN and PASSIGN, that is, using NASSIGN sub-bands 20and at a power level PASSION in each sub-band. Logic flow 400 then ends (424).<br>
By providing for fractional power control of a UE's uplink transmit power, wherein the fractional power control is based on a fractional path loss associated with the UE, and further providing for an allocation of a minimum amount of uplink bandwidth to a UE that will achieve a level of performance desired for uplink<br>
 transmissions, communication system 100 provides edge users in a Single Carrier or a Multi-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) communication system, such as 3GPP or a 3GPP2 Evolution communication systems such as an E-UTRA communication system, with improved performance and a better chance to transmit while enhancing overall spectral efficiency. However, as a frequency reuse factor of<br>
 one has been proposed for such communication systems, interference levels may be<br><br>
15<br>
even further improved by an improved sub-band allocation scheme in each coverage area of multiple, adjacent coverage areas.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, a block diagram is provided of a communication system 500 in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Communication system 500 is divided into multiple coverage areas 502, 504, such as cells or sectors of a cell, that are each provided wireless communication services by a respective RAN 512, 514. However, in another embodiment of the present invention, each coverage area of the multiple coverage areas 502, 504, such as sectors of a cell, may be provided wireless communication services by a same RAN. Similar to RAN<br>
120, each RAN 512, 514 includes a transceiver, such as a Node B or a Base Transceiver Station (BTS), coupled to a network controller, such as a Radio Network Controller (RNC) or a Base Station Controller (BSC), and the functionality described herein as being performed by RAN 512 or 514 may be implemented in the transceiver or controller of the RAN or may be distributed among the transceiver and controller,<br>
 and more particularly may be implemented with or in software programs and instructions stored in a respective at least one memory device of the transceiver or controller and executed by a respective processor of the transceiver or controller.<br>
Communication system 500 further includes multiple UEs 520-525 (six shown), wherein a first group of multiple UEs 520-522 reside in a first coverage area<br>
 502 of the multiple coverage areas 502, 504 and are serviced by a first RAN 512 of the multiple RANs 512, 514, and a second group of multiple UEs 523-525 reside in a second coverage area 504 of the multiple coverage areas 502, 504 and are serviced by a second RAN 514 of the multiple RANs 512, 514. The RAN serving each coverage area 502, 504 provides wireless communication services to the coverage area via a<br>
 respective air interface 506, 508, wherein each air interface 506, 508 comprises an uplink (not shown) and a downlink (not shown).<br>
Similar to communication system 100, communication system 500 comprises<br>
a wideband packet data communication system that employs a Single Carrier or a<br>
Multi-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) air interface technology,<br>
wherein a frequency bandwidth is split into multiple frequency sub-bands, or<br>
subcarriers, that comprise the physical layer channels over which traffic and signaling<br><br>
16<br>
channels are transmitted simultaneously. A user may then be assigned one or more of the frequency sub-bands for an exchange of user information, thereby permitting multiple users to transmit simultaneously on the different sub-carriers. Further, communication system 100 preferably operates in accordance with the 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) E-UTRA (Evolutionary UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access) standards, which standards specify wireless telecommunications system operating protocols, including radio system parameters and call processing procedures. However, those who are of ordinary skill in the art realize that communication system 500 may operate in accordance with any wireless<br>
 telecommunication system employing a frequency division multiplexing scheme or a time and frequency division multiplexing scheme, wherein a sub-band comprises a frequency sub-band or a time and frequency sub-band, such as a 3GPP2 (Third Generation Partnership Project 2) Evolution communication system, for example, a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) 2000 1XEV-DV communication system, a<br>
 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) communication system as described by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 802 .xx standards, for example, the 802.11 a/HiperLAN2, 802.1 lg, 802.16, or 802.21 standards, or any of multiple proposed ultrawideband (UWB) communication systems. Communication system 500 further implements a frequency reuse factor of one, wherein each coverage<br>
 area of the multiple coverage areas 502, 504 utilizes a same frequency bandwidth.<br>
Communication system 500 provides interference management by allocating a same resource block in each of coverage areas 502, 504 to UEs with a similar path loss and/or transmit power. By allocating a same resource block in each of coverage areas 502, 504 to UEs with a similar path loss and/or transmit power, communication system 500 reduces a likelihood that a UE using a resource block in one coverage area of the multiple coverage areas, such as coverage area 502, will interfere with the utilization of the same resource block by a UE residing in a different coverage area, such as coverage area 504, of the multiple coverage areas.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 6, a block diagram 600 is depicted of a method of<br>
uplink resource allocation executed by communication system 500 in accordance with<br>
the another embodiment of the present invention. Logic flow diagram 600 begins<br><br>
	17<br>
(602) when each RAN 512, 514 determines (604) a channel condition in association with each UE serviced by the RAN and active in the coverage area of the RAN, that is, UEs 520-522 with respect to RAN 512 and UEs 523-525 with respct to RAN 514. In one embodiment of the present invention, each UE of the multiple UEs 520-525 may measure a downlink channel condition, preferably measuring Channel Quality Information (CQI) as is known in the art, associated with each sub-band of the multiple sub-bands in a bandwidth employed in the coverage area wherein the UE resides. Each UE of the multiple UEs 520-525 may then report the measured downlink channel conditions for all of the sub-bands to a RAN serving the UE, and in<br>
particular to a transceiver of the RAN, preferably in a Channel Quality Information (CQI) message. For example, each of the first group of UEs 520-522 may report their measured downlink channel conditions to first RAN 512 and each of the second group of UEs 523-525 may report their measured downlink channel conditions to second RAN 514. In another embodiment of the present invention, each RAN 512, 514 may<br>
 measure an uplink channel condition for each UE serviced by the RAN based on uplink transmissions received from the UE, such as an uplink pilot signal, an uplink control signal, or an uplink traffic signal. Again, one of ordinary skill in the art realizes that there are many ways for a RAN to determine channel conditions associated with a UE serviced by the RAN, and any such method may be used herein<br>
 without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
Based on the channel condition measurements, each of RANs 512 and 514 determines (606) a path loss for each UE serviced by the RAN. For example, RAN 512 may determine a path loss for each of UEs 520-522 and RAN 514 may determine a path loss for each of UEs 523-525. Each RAN 512, 514 then ranks (608) the<br>
 multiple UEs served by the RAN, such as UEs 520-522 with respect to RAN 512 and UEs 523-525 with respect to RAN 514, based on the path losses determined for the UEs. Each RAN 512, 514 then assigns (610) a different block of uplink resources, such as a set of one or more sub-bands or an uplink transmit power level, to each UE of the multiple UEs reporting to the RAN based on the UE's ranking. When a block<br>
 of uplink resources comprises a set of one or more sub-bands, the sub-bands included in the block of uplink resources need not be contiguous in frequency or time. In<br><br>
18<br>
assigning the block of uplink resources, each RAN 512, 514, assigns a same block of uplink resources to a UE serviced by the RAN, such as UE 522 with respect to RAN 512 and UE 523 with respect to RAN 514, when the UEs, that is, UEs 522 and 523, are associated with similar channel conditions, indicating that the two UEs are experiencing a similar path loss. Logic flow 600 then ends (612).<br>
For example, and merely for the purpose of illustrating the principles of the present invention and not intended to limit the invention in any way, suppose a first UE 522 serviced by RAN 512 experiences a first path loss PL|, a second UE 521 serviced by RAN 512 experiences a second path loss PL2, and a third UE 520 serviced<br>
 by RAN 512 experiences a third path loss PL3, where PL1 &gt; PL2 &gt; PL3. RAN 512 ranks UEs 520-522 based on these path losses and accordingly allocates a first block of uplink resources comprising a first set of sub-bands to UE 522, a second block of uplink resources comprising a second set of sub-bands to UE 521, and a third block of uplink resources comprising a third set of sub-bands to UE 520, wherein the first<br>
 block of uplink resources comprises more sub-bands than the second block of uplink resources and the second block of uplink resources comprises more sub-bands than the third block of uplink resources.<br>
Further, suppose a fourth UE 523 serviced by RAN 514 experiences a fourth path loss PL4, a fifth UE 524 serviced by RAN 514 experiences a fifth path loss PLs,<br>
 and a sixth UE 525 serviced by RAN 514 experiences a sixth path loss PLs, where PL4 &gt; PL5 &gt; PL6. RAN 514 ranks UEs 523-525 based on these path losses and allocates a fourth block of uplink resources to UE 523, wherein the fourth block of uplink resources comprises the same set of sub-bands as the first block of uplink resources. RAN 514 further allocates a fifth block of uplink resources comprising a fifth set of<br>
 sub-bands to UE 524, wherein the fifth block of uplink resources comprises the same set of sub-bands as the second block of uplink resources, and RAN 514 allocates a sixth block of uplink resources comprising a sixth set of sub-bands to UE 525, wherein the wherein the sixth block of uplink resources comprises the same set of sub-bands as the third block of uplink resources. Thus a same set of sub-bands is<br>
 allocated to UE 522 in coverage area 502 and to UE 523 in coverage area 504, a same set of sub-bands is allocated to UE 521 in coverage area 502 and to UE 524 in<br><br>
19<br>
coverage area 504, and a same set of sub-bands is allocated to UE 520 in coverage<br>
area 502 and to UE 525 in coverage area 504. By assigning a same block of uplink resources to UEs in each coverage area experiencing similar channel conditions, communication system 500 reduces the likelihood that a UE utilizing a block of uplink resources in one coverage area will interfere with a UE utilizing the same block of uplink resources in another coverage area.<br>

To address the need for a resource allocation scheme that results in a better tradeoff between cell-edge performance and overall spectral efficiency, a communication system (100) is provided that allocates uplink transmit power to user equipment (UEs) (102, 104) based on a fractional power control scheme (300). In<br>
