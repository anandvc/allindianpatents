				<td>This invention relates to novel compounds and in particular to novel adjuvants and to their use in agrochemical formulations.<br>
A wide variety of adjuvants are available to those skilled in the art for the improvement of the bioperformance of active ingredients such as .agiochemicals. In addition to the effect on bioperformance, the physical properties of an adjuvant are of key importance and must be selected with a view to compatibility with the formulation concerned. Thus by way of a single example, it is generally simplei to incorporate a solid adjuvant into a solid formulation such as a water-soluble or water-dispersible granule.  In general adjuvants rely on surfactant properties for bioperformance enhancement and one typical class of adjuvants involves an alky) or aryl group to provide a lipophilic moiety and a (poly) ethoxy chain to provide a hydrophilic moiety.  Much has been published on the selection of adjuvants for various purposes and in Hess, F.E). and Foy, C.L., Weed technology, 2000, 14, 807-813   for example it is disclosed that adjuvants for use with lipophilic agrochemical active ingredients are generally of relatively low molecular weight with a degree of ethoxylation which leads to a hydrophile hpophiJe balance (HLB) ol 8 or less.   This corresponds to a surfactant with 12 carbon atoms in the lipophilic chain and between 2 and 5 moles of ethoxylate in the hydrophilic portion of the adjuvant   Similaily a surfactant with a longer carbon chain, such as 18 atoms, would have four or less moles of ethoxylate.<br>
Propoxylate groups are considered to be lipophilic A molecule with a hydrocarbon chain and propoxylate groups would not be considered to have an HLB value and would normally not be considered as a surfactant<br>
Particular care is required when selecting bioper formance enhancing adjuvants lor incorporation in a microencapsulated presentation of an active ingredient, since many conventional ethoxylated adjuvants interfeie with the microcapsule wall-forming reaction at the oil/water interface.  Use of such adjuvants results m weak or ruptured microcapsules and their presence is therefore undesirable<br>
In GB 2024626 there is disclosed a iange of polypropylene glycol derivatives suitable for destroying mites or ectoparasites and their eggs   in Table 3 there is disclosed propoxylated (10) oleyl alcohol.<br>
We have now found that certain novel alkoxylated long chain alcohols and acids and end-capped variants thereof, despite having little or no surfactant properties, are<br>
unexpectedly effective bioperformance enhancing adjuvants and furthermore have physical properties and attributes that render then particularly effective in certain formulation vehicles.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided an adjuvant having the formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
wherein R1 is a C16 to C20 straight or branched chain alkyl or alkenyl group, R2 is ethyl or isopropyl, n is from 8 to 30 and m is 0 or 1 and when R? is ethyl, R3 is a C1 to C7 alky! group and when R2 is isopropyl, R3 is hydrogen or a Cx to C7 alkyl group, provided that when R1 is oleyl, R2 is isopropyl and R3 is hydrogen, 11 is not 10.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided an agrochemical composition comprising a herbicide or fungicide and an adjuvant having the formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
wherein R1 is a C16 to C20 straight or branched chain alkyl or alkenyl group, R2 is ethyl or isopropyl, n is from 8 to 30 and m is 0 or 1 and when R2 is ethyl, R3 is a R1 to C7 alkyl group and when R2 is isopropyl, R3 is hydrogen or a R1 to C7 alkyl group.<br>
The agrochemical is preferably a lipophilic herbicide or fungicide.. When R1 is an alkenyl group it may have one or more double bonds which may be in either cis or trans configuration(s). Preferably R1 has from 1 to 3 double bonds.  It is generally preferred that the double bond(s) are in the cis configuration.  It is especially preferred that R1 is a R18 branched chain alkyl or R18 alkenyl group for example oleyl or isostearyl (derived from the alcohol, 2-he\yl-dodecan- l-ol).<br>
The value of n is preferably from 10 to 30 and especially from 10 to 20. The value of n may be an integer when a specific and uniform number of groups R2O are introduced or may be an average value when a range ot numbers of such groups are introduced. The value of m is preferably 0<br>
When R3 is not hydrogen it is preferably a R1 to C4 alkyl group and in particular methyl or butyl. Butyl is especially preferred. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that an alkyl group R3 represents an "end cap" to the terminal hydroxyl of the group<br>
-0-l-R20-]n   H. Since "end capping" a terminal ethylene oxide group (R2 is ethyl) removes certain undesirable properties (such as the interference with the microencapsulation process) as<br>
discussed herein, it is desirable in order to achieve the objects of the invention to "end cap" substantially all of the terminal hydroxyl groups when K2 is ethyl. Thus R3 is not hydrogen when R2 is ethyl. When R2 is isopropyl on the other hand, R3 may be hydrogen or aikyl since both moieties achieve the objects of the invention. It is thus possible to "end cap" only a proportion of the terminal hydroxyl groups such that R3 is a mixture of hydrogen and aikyl groups.<br>
We have found that both propoxylated oleyl and isostearyl alcohols (when the value of m is 0) and acids (when the value of m is 1) and (heir end-capped equivalents show no significant surfactant properties. These materials do not contain a hydrophilic moiety and would not be considered to have an HLB classification. Attempts to use these materials to emulsify a simple oil such as decane into water showed that separation into two phases occurred even after vigorous shaking. Where some small amount of emulsification was observed this was found to be short lived. . Surprisingly the bioperfonnance enhancement, in particular for lipophilic agrochemicals, is excellent despite the lack of surfactant properties. Moreover, the absence of surfactant properties may bring a number of advantages such as reduced spray drift, a reduction in adverse interaction with surfactants added for formulation purposes (such as suspension of a dispersed solid) and reduced gelling of the formulation. Moreover the adjuvants are generally liquids (oils) which are substantially insoluble in water and are readily compatible for example with emulsion concentrates in which they dissolve in the oil phase. They are also more readily used as stand-alone tank mix adjuvants since they are oil-soluble.  Incieasing the molecular weight, for example using butyl end-capping and a value oi' n towards the upper end of the range, may produce a solid adjuvant which is for example well adapted lor incorporation in solid formulations such as water-soluble or water-disperbible granules.  In general the propoxylated adjuvants of the present invention are liquid whereas the ethoxylates are either solid or semi-solid.  An exception is oleyl 10 KG with a butyl end cap which is a liquid.<br>
We have found similarly that ethoxylated oleyl and lsobteaiyl end-capped methyl and butyl ethers show no significant surfactant properties.   They generally have different physical properties from the uncapped equivalents which can be used to advantage. For example oleyl 10 EO end-capped butyl ether is an oily liquid which emulsifies readily in water whilst the uncapped oleyl 10 EO equivalent forms viscous liquid crystals on contact with water. Increasing the molecular weight, for example using butyl end-capping and a value of n towards the upper end of the range, may produce a solid adjuvant which is for<br>
example well adapted for incorporation in solid formulations such as water-soluble or water-dispersible granules. Typical of such a solid adjuvant according to the present invention is oleyl 20 EO end-capped with butyl (i.e the compound in which R1 is oleyl, R2 is ethyl, n is 20 and R3 is butyl).<br>
As specific examples of the adjuvants of the present invention or which may be used in agrochemcial compositions of the present invention there may be mentioned oleyl 10 propylene oxide (i.e. a compound of Formula (1) wherein Rl is oleyl, m is 0, R2 is isopropylene , n is 10 and R3 is hydrogen), oleyl 10 propylene oxide end-capped butyl ether (i.e. a compound of Formula (1) wherein Rl is oleyl, m is 0, R2 is isopropylene , n is 10 and R3 is butyl), oleyl 20 propylene oxide, oleyl 20 propylene oxide end-capped butyl ether, isostearyl 10 propylene oxide, isoslearyl 20 propylene oxide, oleyl 10 ethylene oxide end-capped butyl ether, oleyl 20 ethylene oxide end-capped butyl ether, oleic acid 10 ethylene oxide end-capped methyl ether (1 e. a compound of Formula (1) wherein Rl is oleyl, m is 1, R2 is ethylene , n is 10 and R3 is methyl), oleic acid 20 ethylene oxide end-capped methyl ether.<br>
Adjuvants of the present invention are generally compatible with microencapsulation processes and can be incorporated as biopertormance enhancing adjuvant in a microencapsulated agrochemical formulation without detriment to the microcapsule properties. In contrast conventional ethoxylated alcohol surfactants tend to interfere with lnterfaciaJ polymerisation wall-forming processes which are key to most conventional microencapsulation processes.<br>
Adjuvants of the present invention have a vanety of uses but are particularly suitable lor enhancing the bioperformance of lipophilic agrochemicals, including herbicides, fungicides and insecticides.

Adjuvants of the present invention may be prepared by conventional techniques. Thus for example the ethoxylated or propopoxylated alcohol or acid may be manufactured by base catalysed condensation of the relevant alcohol or acid (for example oleyl or isostearyl alcohol or acid) with ethylene oxide (or propylene oxide as the case may be). End-capped derivatives may be obtained by reacting the ethoxylated or piopoxylated alcohol or acid with the appropriate alkyl halide (for example butyl chloride) in the presence of a base.<br>
The proportion of adjuvant relative to active ingredient can readily be selected by one skilled in the art to meet the intended utility    Typically the ratio of adjuvant to active ingredient will range from 1:50 and 200:1 and preferably from 1:5 to 20:1<br>

EXAMPLES 1 1 to 14<br>
An agrochemical composition was prepared containing 0.2 % v/v of an adjuvani in a track sprayer containing fluazifop P butyl emulsified at one of tour different concentrations. Weeds which had been grown to the 2.3 leaf stage were sprayed using volumes of 200 1/ha. Each sample was replicated three times. The following weed species weie tested:-AVEFA Avena falua (wild oats) LOLRI Lolium rigidum (rye grass) TRZAW Triticum aestivum (wheat) SETV1 Setaria viridis (green foxtails)<br>
Activity was measured 21 days after treatment and was compared with a standard composition containing only fluazifop-p-butyl   The concentration required to provide 90% weed kill was calculated and is given in TABLE 1 below together with the mean ED90 across the species.<br>

(Table Removed)  <br>
EXAMPLES 15 to 25 Further adjuvants of the present invention were tested for activity in combination with fluzifop-p-butyl. Activity (% weed kill) was measured 21 days after treatment and is given as a mean of 3 replicates and 4 rates of fluazifop-p-butyl. All adjuvants were applied at 0.2% v/v. The results are given in Table 2 in comparison with a corresponding composition containing no adjuvant.<br>
TABLE 2 Mean Activity (%)(Table Removed)  <br><br>
EXAMPLES 26 and 27 The indicated adjuvants were evaluated in combination with a thin leaved grass herbicide 2,2,-dimethyl-propionic acid-8-(2,6-diethyl-4-methyl-phenyl)-9-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-9H-pyrazo!o[l,2-d][l,4,5joxadiazepine-7-yl ester   The weeds were sprayed at the<br>
growth stages shown in the table with pesticide emulsions using a track sprayer and volumes of 200 1/ha. The adjuvants were added at 5% v/v as tank mix additives.  Each result is the average of two replicates.<br>

APESV (Apera Spica-Venti) PHAPA (Phalans paradoxa)<br>
HXAMPLE 28 This example demonstrates the improvement in the biological activity of the fungicide axoxystiobin when applied with one of the novel adjuvanis in glasshouse tests. The results quoted are the mean percentage disease control from tour replicates on barley inoculated with Fuccima recondita. Azoxystiobin was applied from the commercial formulation Quadns 25 SC which was diluted to the strengths shown in the table. The adjuvant was added as a 0.5 % v/v tank mix<br>
