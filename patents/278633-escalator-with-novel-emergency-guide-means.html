				<td>Escalator with Novel Emergency Guide Means<br>
The invention relates to an escalator with an endless formation of successive steps according to Claim 1.<br>
Escalators, sometimes also referred to as moving stairways, have an endless chain of successive steps that can transport people or items of luggage upwards and/or downwards. Present on the steps are rollers that are aligned with the sides and run on rails. By means of guiderails, the steps are brought into the desired position. Furthermore, the rollers and guiderails together serve to absorb vertically directed forces as, for example, when a step is stood on.<br>
To prevent an individual step from tipping when it is, for example, eccentrically loaded, escalators typically have emergency guide systems. The emergency guide systems require various parts that must be manufactured and fastened. Furthermore, the manufacture of the emergency guide requires relatively high outlay.<br>
The objective of the invention is to be seen in the proposal of a novel escalator that avoids the disadvantages of the state of the art and dispenses with the emergency guide systems that were formerly required: Above all, it should reduce the outlay for installation and assembly.<br>
The objective is fulfilled according to the invention by the characteristics of the characterizing part of Claim 1.<br>
 <br>
According to the invention, an emergency guide hook is attached in the area of the front surface or step-riser in such manner that the emergency guide hook of a higher lying step supports itself against a part of a cheek of the next lowering step, should the step be eccentrically loaded in the area of the step-tread. In other words, each step is provided with an emergency guide hook that is arranged in such manner that the steps mutually support each other should an eccentric load occur.<br>
An advantage of this invention is that installation is much easier since the emergency guide hooks can already be pre-installed on the step. Thus, no elaborate installation and assembly of the individual elements of the emergency guide system is required as was the case in escalators hitherto. Alternatively, the emergency guide hooks can also be cast with the steps.<br>
Furthermore, the emergency guide hook itself is inexpensive to manufacture, especially when produced as a stamping out of sheet metal.<br>
In a currently preferred embodiment of the invention, the emergency guide hook sits directly on the axle of one of the rollers that is present on the step. This simplifies assembly.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the new device are defined by the dependent claims.<br>
 <br>
Further details and advantages of the invention are explained below in relation to exemplary embodiments and by reference to the drawings. Shown are in<br>
Fig. 1       from the side, partly cut away, an escalator<br>

Fig. 1 shows a conventional escalator 1 that connects a lower level El with an upper level E2. The escalator has an endless formation of successive steps 3 that are, however, only partly shown in Fig. 1. As lateral boundaries in the lower part, the escalator 1 has, as usual, skirt-panels 2.1 (see Fig. 3) and in the upper part a location ally fixed balustrade 2, arranged at the top of which is generally a<br>
 <br>
handrail 2.2 that is movable with the endless formation of steps 3. Typically provided on escalators 1 of this type are transporting guides 5 and return guides 6.<br>
Each step 3 has a step-tread 3.1, a front surface or step-riser 3.3, and on each side a sideways directed cheek 3.4. Shown in Fig. 2 is a step 3 according to the invention. In this figure, one of the side cheeks lies quasi in the plane of the drawing. The second side cheek 3.4 is only visible from the inside of the step. Provided in the area of each cheek are two rollers 7 and 8 that project transporting sideways, that are guided and supported along the laterally mounted, diagonally roller-rails 5, 6 of the escalator 1.<br>
To prevent an individual step 3 from tipping when it is, for example, eccentrically loaded by a load on the step-tread 3.1, conventional escalators 1 typically have two emergency guide rails 9. Installation of the emergency guide is relatively elaborate, and the emergency guide requires numerous different parts 9, 10, 11, 12 that must be manufactured and delivered.<br>
Shown in Fig. 3 is a cross section through a conventional escalator 1 perpendicular to the direction of travel. By reference to this figure it will be briefly explained how the emergency guide that is usual today is constructed. In addition, other elements of the escalator 1 are described that are also present in an escalator 1 according to the invention.<br>
The escalator 1 is borne in a truss whose various elements are indicated in Fig. 3 with reference number 4. Fastened<br>
 <br>
on this truss 4 are the transporting rails 5 and return rails 6 that were mentioned at the outset. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that the transporting guides 5 have an L-shaped cross section and thereby define two different running planes. On the upper running level run the outer rollers 7, i.e. the rollers 7 with large wheel separation, and on the lower running level run the inner rollers 8, i.e. the rollers 8 with small wheel separation. The rollers 7 and 8 are shown black in Fig. 3, to highlight them better. The transporting rails 5 serve as vertical supports for the steps 3 and absorb vertically directed forces as well as guiding the steps 3 upwards or downwards on the truss 4 (depending on the direction of movement). In the diagonal area of the escalator 1, the vertical distance between the upper running level and lower running level of the escalator 1 is chosen relatively small so that the steps 3 are turned or swiveled into the normal position and guided stably. In the normal position, the vertical axis distance VA1 between the outer rollers 7 and the inner rollers 8 is small, as outlined on the left side of Fig. 3.<br>
The respective rollers 7, 8 on each side of a step 3 are arranged mutually offset so as to be able to guide the steps 3 stably along the diagonally running roller-rails 5, 6.<br>
The return rails 6 have an upper running level 6.1 and a lower running level 6.2. The distance between these running levels 6.1 and 6.2 is very much greater and the steps 3 are transported back in the so-called return area (see Fig. 1) hanging, i.e. with the step-tread 3.1 facing down. In the return area of the return side, the vertical axle distance VA2 between the outer rollers 7 and the inner rollers 8 is<br>
 <br>
very much greater than the vertical axle distance VA1 on the transporting side as outlined on the right-hand side of Fig. 3.<br>
The elements described hitherto in association with Fig. 3 are also present in a currently preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
The elements of the emergency guide that is usual today will now be briefly described. Two emergency guide rails 9 are present that are mounted on the truss 4 with fastening brackets 11 and associated fastening bolts 12, fastening nuts and screw-locking devices. Fastened on the step body 3 or step web 3.2 in the area of the rollers 8 is a hook 10. Viewed from the side cheek of the step 3, this hook 10 faces inward. In the installed state, the hooks 10 engage under tne emergency guide rails 9 and normally run there touchlessly. Should an eccentric loading of a step 3 occur, this step tilts slightly about a horizontal axis or step axis respectively and on one or other side of the emergency guide rails 9, the hooks touch the emergency guide rails 9. Vertically upwards directed tipping movements are thereby stopped. Troublesome rubbing or resting or supporting occurs in this area since the hook 10 slides along the emergency guide rail 9. This causes rubbing, and under certain circumstances sounds, that are undesirable.<br>
The essential elements of the invention are now explained by reference to Fig. 2, inasmuch as they were not already described.<br>
 <br>
Each step 3 has a step body or step corpus that is designed to lend stability to the step 3 and carries various elements or connects them together. Connected to the step body are the step surface 3.1 and the front surface or step-riser 3.3. In the embodiment of the invention that is shown, the step body contains two side cheeks 3.4 that are formed by a sort of open frame. In the lower area, the open frame has an elongated step-web 3.2. As shown in the drawing, front struts 3.4 and back struts 3.5 start from the step-web 3.2 and run upwards. These struts 3.4, 3.5 are in turn connected with webs 3.6 on which the step surface 3.1 rests. In the back area of the step body, the two cheeks are connected by the wheel axle or by a step axle 7.1. In the front area of the step body, the front surface or step-riser 3.3 runs between the cheeks 3.4. The step-web extends essentially parallel to a direction that is given by the diagonally running roller-rails (5) when the respective step (3) is in a transporting-side area of the escalator (1). The deviation can be ± 10 degrees.<br>
According to the invention, fastened at least in the area of one of the cheeks is an emergency guide hook 13 which in the example shown projects inward essentially perpendicular to the plane defined by the cheek. If the step 3 is now loaded eccentrically (as outlined by the arrow F), this results in a tipping movement of the step 3 that is represented by the curved arrow D. In this case, the emergency guide hook 13 moves slightly upward and forwards, as shown diagrammatically by the arrow A.<br>
If the endless formation of successive steps 3 is now considered, it will be seen that in case of "emergency", the emergency guide hook 13 touches the back end of the<br>
 <br>
step-web 3.2 of the next step 3 that is positioned somewhat below the eccentrically loaded first step 3. In Fig. 2, the area 14 on step 3 is indicated by a circle within which contact would occur if the emergency guide hook 13 of an upper first step 3 that is not shown were deployed.<br>
Shown in a diagrammatic side view in Fig. 4 are details of a further embodiment according to the invention. Shown in this Figure 4 is the diagonally running transporting-side rails 5, and two successive steps 3 can be seen. The rollers_ 7 run on upper running levels in the roller-rail 5 as described. The same reference numbers are used as in the previous figures. An explanation of the elements that have already been described is therefore unnecessary.<br>
Shown in Fig. 4 is a special embodiment of the emergency guide hook 13. The emergency guide hook 13 sits in the extension of the axle of the roller 8 and is arranged inside and directed transporting (as viewed from the cheek). By means of a nut 15 and an optional screw-locking device, the emergency guide hook 13 is fastened on the middle axle of the roller 8 on the inside of the cheek or of the step web 3.2 respectively. Details thereof are to be seen in Fig. 5. This figure contains an enlarged plan view of the area between two subsequent steps 3. Fig. 5 shows that the emergency guide hook 13 can be, for example, a part that is stamped out of sheet metal and bent and that rests with a vertical surface against the step-web 3.2. This vertical surface has a hole or a slit to make it possible to bolt or fasten the emergency guide hook 13 to the axle of the roller 8. The emergency guide hook 13 also has a contact area that is designed to enter into interplay with the step body or step-web 3.2 of the next step 3<br>
 <br>
should eccentric loading occur. As shown in Fig, 5, this contact area can have a surface area (horizontal surface) that lies perpendicular to the vertical surface. The contact area can, however, also have a differently aligned surface. In case of emergency, the described interplay or resting against and supporting between two adjacent steps 3 occurs in the area 14 that is indicated by a circle. This interplay causes the eccentrically loaded front first step 3 to support itself by its emergency guide hook 13 against the step body or step-web 3.2 of the adjacent back step 3 and thereby stop or prevent tipping of the front first step 3.<br>
Further details are to be seen in the enlarged cross section contained in Fig. 6. Visible in Fig.' 6 is the opposite cheek seen from within. Different than Fig. 4, the figure is not shown diagonally. In other words, the figure is turned so that the transporting-side rail 5 runs horizontally. The rollers 7 and 8 are only shown in outline. By means of the nut 15 and an optional screw- ■ locking device 16, the emergency guide hook 13 is fastened on the axle of the roller 8 on the visible inside of the cheek or of the step-web 3.2. The vertical area 13.1 of the emergency guide hook 13 now lies in the plane of the drawing. In the exemplary embodiment shown, the contact area or surface area 13.2 is positioned diagonally and projects vertically from the plane of the drawing, i.e. the contact area 13.2 faces from this cheek toward the inside. In case of emergency, mechanical interplay with the next step 3 occurs in the area 14 that is indicated by a circle.<br>
Shown in Fig. 7 is a further special embodiment of an emergency guide hook 13 according to the invention. The<br>
 <br>
emergency guide hook 13 sits in the extension of the axle or middle axle 8.1 of the roller 8 (the roller 8 is not shown) and is aligned transporting (as viewed from the step web 3.2). By means of a nut 15 and an optional screw-locking device 16, the emergency guide hook 13 is fastened on the axle or middle axle respectively of the roller 8 on the inside of the cheek or of the step-web 3.2. In other words, the vertical area 13.1 of the emergency guide hook 13 rests flat against the step-web 3.2. In the example shown, the contact area 13.2 is executed differently. Sitting in this area 13.2 is a buffer element 13.3 (of, for example, rubber, nylon or plastic, PA, PU, POM). This element can be bolted to the emergency guide hook 13 by means of, for example, a hexagonal bolt and nut 13.4.<br>
This type of the embodiment has the advantage that the interplay is damped. A suitable choice or hardness of the buffer element 13.3 allows the damping to be set.<br>
Instead of working with a buffer element 13.3, a spring element' can be correspondingly used.<br>
The embodiments with buffer or spring element 13.3 have the advantage that in normal operation they prevent the steps 3 or step band from swinging upwards or oscillating.<br>
It is also possible to attach a buffer or spring element to the respective adjacent step 3 so that the emergency guide hook 13 does not strike a metal surface and, for example, cause noises .<br>
 <br>
It is regarded as an important advantage of the emergency-guide-rail-free embodiment that no noises occur. Installation is also much easier and less expensive.<br>
