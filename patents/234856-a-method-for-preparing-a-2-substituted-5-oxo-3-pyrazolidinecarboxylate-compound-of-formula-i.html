DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the recitations herein, the term "carbon moiety" refers to a radical comprising a carbon atom linking the radical to the remainder of the molecule. As the substituents R1, R2a, R2b, R3, R4 and R5 are separated from the reaction center, they can encompass a great variety of carbon-based groups preparable by modem methods of synthetic organic chemistry. Also the substituent L can encompass in addition to hydrogen a wide range of radicals selected from optionally substituted aryl, optionally substituted tertiary alkyl, -C(O)R3, -S(O)2R3 or -P(O)(R3)2, which stereoelectronically align with the cyclization regiochemistry of the method of the present invention. The method of this invention is thus generally applicable to a wide range of starting compounds of Formula II and product compounds of Formula I.<br>
"Carbon moiety" thus includes alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl, which can be straight-chain or branched. "Carbon moiety" also includes carbocyclic and heterocyclic rings, which can be saturated, partially saturated, or completely unsaturated. Furthermore, unsaturated rings<br>
can be aromatic if Hückel's rule is satisfied.   The carbocyclic and heterocyclic rings of a carbon moiety can form polycyclic ring systems comprising multiple rings connected together.   The term "carbocyclic ring" denotes a ring wherein the atoms forming the ring backbone are selected only from carbon.   The term "heterocyclic ring" denotes a ring wherein at least one of the ring backbone atoms is other than carbon.    "Saturated carbocyclic" refers to a ring having a backbone consisting of carbon atoms linked to one another by single bonds; unless otherwise specified, the remaining carbon valences are occupied by hydrogen atoms.   The term "aromatic ring system" denotes fully unsaturated carbocycles and heterocycles in which at least one ring in a polycyclic ring system is aromatic. Aromatic indicates that each of ring atoms is essentially in the same plane and has a p-orbital perpendicular to the ring plane, and in which (4n + 2) n electrons, when n is 0 or a positive integer, are associated with the ring to comply with Hückel's rule.    The term "aromatic carbocyclic ring system" includes fully aromatic carbocycles and carbocycles in which at least one ring of a polycyclic ring system is aromatic.   The term "honaromatic carbocyclic ring system" denotes fully saturated carbocycles as well as partially or fully unsaturated carbocycles wherein none of the rings in the ring system are aromatic.   The terms "aromatic heterocyclic ring system" and "heteroaromatic ring" include fully aromatic heterocycles and heterocycles in which at least one ring of a polycyclic ring system is aromatic.     The term "nonaromatic  heterocyclic ring system"  denotes fully saturated heterocycles as well as partially or fully unsaturated heterocycles wherein none of the rings in the ring system are aromatic. The term "aryl" denotes a carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring or ring system in which at least one ring is aromatic, and the aromatic ring provides the connection to the remainder of the molecule.<br>
The carbon moieties specified for R1, R2a, R2b.R3, R4 and R5 and the aryl and tertiary alkyl radicals specified for L are optionally substituted. The term "optionally substituted" in connection with these carbon moieties refers to carbon moieties that are unsubstituted or have at least one non-hydrogen substituent. Similarly, the term "optionally substituted" in connection with aryl and tertiary aryl refers to aryl and tertiary alkyl radicals that are unsubstituted or have a least on non-hydrogen substituent. Illustrative optional substituents include alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl, hydroxycarbonyl, formyl, alkylcarbonyl, alkenylcarbonyl, alkynylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, alkenyloxy, alkynyloxy, cycloalkoxy, aryloxy, alkylthio, alkenylthio, alkynylthio, cycloalkylthio, arylthio, alkylsulfinyl, alkenylsulfinyl, alkynylsulfinyl, cycloalkylsulfinyl, arylsulfinyl, alkylsulfonyl, alkenylsulfonyl, alkynylsulfonyl, cycloalkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl, amino, alkylamino, alkenylamino, alkynylamino, arylamino, aminocarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl, alkenylaminocarbonyl, alkynylaminocarbonyl, arylaminocarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl, alkenylaminocarbonyl, alkynylaminocarbonyl, arylaminocarbonyloxy, alkoxycarbonylamino, alkenyloxycarbonylamino, alkynyloxycarbonylamino and aryloxy-<br>
carbonylamino, each further optionally substituted; and halogen, cyano -and nitro.    The optional further  substituents are independently selected from groups like those illustrated above for the substituents themselves to give additional substituent radicals for L, R1, R2a, R2b, R3, R4 and R5 such as haloalkyl, haloalkenyl and haloalkoxy.  As a further example, alkylamino can be further substituted with alkyl, giving dialkylamino. The substituents can also be tied together by figuratively removing one or two hydrogen atoms from each of two substituents or a substituent and the supporting molecular structure and joining the radicals to produce cyclic and polycyclic structures fused or appended to the molecular structure supporting the substituents.   For example, tying together adjacent hydroxy and methoxy groups attached to, for example, a phenyl ring gives a fused dioxolane structure containing the linking group -0-CH2-O-.  Tying together a hydroxy group and the molecular structure to which it is attached can give cyclic ethers, including epoxides.   Illustrative substituents also include oxygen, which when attached to carbon forms a carbonyl function.   Similarly, sulfur when attached to carbon forms a thiocarbonyl function. Within the L, R1, R2a, R2b, R3, R4 or R5 moieties, tying together substituents can form cyclic and polycyclic structures. Also illustrative of R1, R2a and R2b are embodiments wherein at least two of the R1, R2a and R2b moieties are contained in the same radical (i.e. a ring system is formed).   As the pyrazolidine moiety constitutes one ring, the R1 moiety contained in the same radical as R2a (or OR4) or R2b would result in a fused bicyclic or polycyclic ring system. Two R2a and R2b moieties contained in the same radical would result in a spiro ring system.<br>
As referred to herein, "alkyl", used either alone or in compound words such as "alkylthio" or "haloalkyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkyl, such as, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, or the different butyl, pentyl or hexyl isomers. "Tertiary alkyl" denotes a branched alkyl radical wherein the carbon atom linked to the remainder of the molecule is also attached to three carbon atoms in the radical. Examples of "tertiary alkyl" include -C(CH3)3, -C(CH3)2CH2CH3 and -C(CH3)(CH2CH3)(CH2)2CH3. "Alkenyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkenes such as ethenyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, and the different butenyl, pentenyl and hexenyl isomers.

"Alkylthio" includes branched or straight-chain alkylthio moieties<br>
such as methylthio,  ethylthio,  and the  different propylthio, butylthio,  pentylthio  and hexylthio isomers.   "Alkylsulfinyl" includes both enantiomers of an alkylsulfinyl group. Examples    of   "alkylsulfinyl"    include    CH3S(O),    CH3CH2S(O),    CH3CH2CH2S(O); (CH3)2CHS(O) and the different butylsulfinyl, pentylsulfinyl and hexylsulfinyl isomers. Examples   of  "alkylsulfonyl"   include   CH3S(O)2,   CH3CH2S(O)2,   CH3CH2CH2S(O)2, (CH3)2CHS(O)2 and. the different butylsulfonyl, pentylsulfonyl and hexylsulfonyl isomers.

"Cycloalkenyl" includes groups such as cyclopentenyl and cyclohexenyl as well as groups with more than one double bond such as 1,3- and 1,4-cyclohexadienyl.<br>
The term "halogen", either alone or in compound words such as "haloalkyl", includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. The term "1-2 halogen" indicates that one or two of the available positions for that substituent may be halogen which are independently selected. Further, when used in compound words such as "haloalkyl", said alkyl may be partially or fully substituted with halogen atoms which may be the same or different. Examples of "haloalkyl" include F3C, C1CH2, CF3CH2 and CF3CC12.<br>
The term "sulfonate" refers to radicals comprising a -OS(0)2- wherein the sulfur atom is bonded to a carbon moiety, and the oxygen atom is bonded to the remainder of the molecule and thus serves as the attachment point for the sulfonate radical. Commonly used sulfonates include -OS(O)2Me, -OS(0)2Et, -OS(O)2-n-Pr, -OS(O)2CF3, -OS(O)2Ph and -S(O)2Ph-4-Me.<br>
The total number of carbon atoms in a substituent group is indicated by the "Ci-Cj" prefix where i and j are, for example, numbers from 1 to 3; e.g., C1-C3 alkyl designates methyl through propyl.<br>

Typically Formula III comprises 0-50, more commonly 6-25, and most commonly 6-13 carbon atoms, and 2-12, more commonly 2-7, and most commonly 2-5 heteroatoms. The heteroatoms are commonly selected from halogen, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen and phosphorus. Three heteroatoms in Formulae I and II are the two oxygen atoms in the carboxylate ester group (R1OC)(O)-) and the oxygen atom in the other carbonyl radical. Two heteroatoms in Formulae I and III are the two nitrogen atoms in the pyrazoline ring and the precursor hydrazine. X and Y typically each comprise at least one heteroatom.<br>
Although there is no definite limit to the size of R1, R2a, R2b, R3, R4 and R5, optionally substituted alkyl moieties of R1, R2a, R2b, R3, R4 and R5 commonly include 1 to 6 carbon atoms, more commonly 1 to 4 carbon atoms and most commonly 1 to 2 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain. Optionally substituted alkenyl and alkynyl moieties of R1, R2a, R2b, R3, R4 and R5 commonly include 2 to 6 carbon atoms, more commonly 2 to 4 carbon atoms and most commonly 2 to 3 carbon atoms in the alkenyl or alkynyl chain. Optionally substituted tertiary alkyl moieties of L commonly include 4 to 10 carbon atoms, more commonly 4 to 8 carbon atoms and most commonly 4 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
As indicated above, the carbon moieties of R1, R2a, R2b, R3, R4 and R5 may be (among others) an aromatic ring or ring system. Also the aryl moiety of L is an aromatic ring or ring system. Examples of aromatic rings or ring systems include a phenyl ring, 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic rings, aromatic 8-, 9- or 10-membered fused carbobicyclic ring, systems and aromatic 8-, 9- or 10-membered fused heterobicyclic ring systems wherein each ring or ring system is optionally substituted. The term "optionally substituted" in connection with these R1, R2a, R2b, R3, R4 and R5 carbon moieties and the aryl moiety of L refers to carbon moieties which are unsubstituted or have at least one non-hydrogen substituent. These carbon moieties may be substituted with as many optional substituents as can be accommodated b'y replacing a hydrogen atom with a non-hydrogen substituent on any available carbon or nitrogen atom. Commonly, the number of optional substituents (when present) ranges from one to four. An example of phenyl optionally substituted with from one to four substituents is the ring illustrated as U-l in Exhibit 1, wherein Rv is any non-hydrogen substituent and r is an integer from 0 to 4. Examples of aromatic 8-, 9- or 10-membered fused carbobicyclic ring systems optionally substituted with from one to four substituents include a naphthyl group optionally substituted with from one to four substituents illustrated as U-85 and a 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl group optionally substituted with from one to four substituents illustrated as U-86 in Exhibit 1, wherein Rv is any substituent and r is an integer from 0 to 4. Examples of 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic rings optionally substituted with from one to four substituents include the rings U-2 through U-53 illustrated in Exhibit 1 wherein Rv is any substituent and r is an integer from 1 to 4.<br>
Examples of aromatic S-, 9- or 10-membered fused heterobicyclic ring systems optionally substituted with from one to four substituents include U-54 through U-84 illustrated in Exhibit 1 wherein Rv is any substituent, for example a substituent such as R9, and r is an integer from 0 to 4. Other examples of L, R1, R2a, R2b, R3, R4 and R5 include a benzyl group optionally substituted with from one to four substituents illustrated as U-S7 and a benzoyl group optionally substituted with from one to four substituents illustrated as U-88 in Exhibit 1, wherein Rv is any substituent and r is an integer from 0 to 4.<br>
Although Rv groups are shown in the structures U-l through U-S5, it is noted that they do not need to be present since they are optional substituents. The nitrogen atoms that require substitution to fill their valence are substituted with H or Rv. Note that some U groups can only be substituted with less than 4 Rv groups (e.g., U-14, U-15, U-l8 through U-21 and U-32 through U-34 can only be substituted with one Rv). Note that when the attachment point between (Rv)r and the U group is illustrated as floating, (Rv)r can be attached to any available carbon atom or nitrogen atom of the U group. Note that when the attachment point on the U group is illustrated as-floating, the U group can be attached to the remainder of Formulae I, II and III through any available carbon of the U group by<br>
replacement of a hydrogen atom.<br>
Exhibit 1<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
As indicated above, the carbon moieties of R1, R2a, R2b, R3, R4 and R5 may be (among others) saturated or partially saturated carbocyclic and heterocyclic rings, which can be further optionally substituted. The term "optionally substituted" in connection with these R1, R2a, R2b, R3, R4 and R5 carbon moieties refers to carbon moieties which are unsubstituted or have at least one non-hydrogen substituent. These carbon moieties may be substituted with as many optional substituents as can be accommodated by replacing  a hydrogen atom with a non-hydrogen substituent on any available carbon or nitrogen atom. Commonly, the number of optional substituents (when present) ranges from one to four. Examples of saturated or partially saturated carbocyclic rings include optionally substituted C3-C8 cycloalkyl and optionally substituted C3-C8 cycloalkyl. Examples of saturated or partially saturated heterocyclic rings include 5- or 6-membered nonaromatic heterocyclic rings optionally including one or two ring members selected from the group consisting of C(=O), SO or S(0)2, optionally substituted. Examples of such R1, R2a, R2b, R3, R4 and R5<br>
carbon moieties include those illustrated as G-l through G-35 in Exhibit 2. Note that when<br><br>
the attachment point on these G groups is illustrated as floating, the G group can be attached<br>
to the remainder of Formulae I and II through any available carbon or nitrogen of the G group by replacement of a hydrogen atom. The optional substituents can be attached to any available carbon or nitrogen by replacing a hydrogen atom (said substituents are not illustrated in Exhibit 2 since they are optional substituents). Note that when G comprises a ring selected from G-24 through G-31, G-34 and G-35, Q2 may be selected from O, S, NH or substituted N.<br>
Exhibit 2<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
It is noted that the carbon moieties of R1, R2a, R2b, R3, R4 and R5 and the aryl and tertiary alkyl moieties of L may be optionally substituted. As noted above, the R1, R2a, R2b, R3, R4 and R5 carbon moieties may commonly comprise, among other groups, a U group or a G group further optionally substituted with from one to four substituents. The L aryl moiety may commonly comprise, among other groups, a U group further optionally substituted with from one to four substituents. Thus the R1, R2a, R2b, R3, R4 and R5 carbon moieties may comprise a U group or a G -group selected from U-l through U-88 or G-l through G-35, and further substituted with additional substituents including one to four U or G groups (which may be the same or different) with both the core U or G group and substituent U or G groups optionally further substituted. The L moiety may comprise a U group selected from U-l through U-S8 or a tertiary alkyl radical, and further substituted with additional substituents including one to four U or G groups (which may be the same or different) with both the core U group (or tertiary alkyl radical) and the substituent U or G groups optionally further substituted. Of particular note are L carbon moieties comprising a U group optionally substituted with from one to three additional substituents. For example, L can be U-ll, in which an Rv attached to the 1-nitrogen is the group U-41 as shown in Exhibit 3.<br>

As generally defined herein, a "leaving group" denotes an atom or group of atoms displaceable in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. More particularly, "leaving group" refers to substituents X and Y, which are displaced in the reaction according to the method of the present invention. As is well known to those skilled in the art, a nucleophilic reaction leaving group carries the bonding electron pair with it as it is displaced. Accordingly the facility of leaving groups for displacement generally correlates with the stability of the leaving group species carrying the bonding electron pair. For this reason, strong leaving groups (e.g., Br, Cl, I and sulfonates such as OS(O)2CH3) give displaced species that can be regarded as the conjugate bases of strong acids. Because of its high electronegativity, fluoride (F) can also be a strong leaving group from sp2 carbon centers such as in acyl fluorides.<br>
According to the method of the present invention a compound of Formula I is prepared by reacting a compound of Formula II with a compound of Formula III as shown in Scheme 1.<br>
Scheme 1<br>

wherein R1, R2a, R2b, L, X and Y are as previously defined.<br>
Although the intermediate compound of Formula V can sometimes be isolated, it is usually not, because it spontaneously cyclizes to the corresponding compound of Formula I at room temperature. The cyclization is sometimes slow at room temperature; but proceeds at useful rates at elevated temperatures.,<br>
While the 5-oxo-pyrazoline product of Formula I is shown in Scheme 1 as a lactam, one skilled in the art recognizes that this is tautomeric with the lactol of Formula Ib as shown in Scheme 2.<br>
Scheme 2<br>

wherein R1, R2a, R2* and L are as previously defined.<br>
As these tautomers readily equilibrate, they are regarded as chemically equivalent. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to Formula I herein are to be construed to include also Formula Ib.<br>
Preferred for reason of ease of synthesis, better yield, higher purity, lower cost and/or product utility is the method of the present invention wherein: L is preferably H, optionally substituted aryl or optionally substituted tertiary alkyl. More preferably, L is H or optionally substituted aryl. Even more preferably, L is optionally substituted aryl. Most preferably, L is phenyl or pyridyl, each optionally substituted. R1 is preferably C1-C16 alkyl, C1-C16 alkenyl or C1-C16 alkynyl, each optionally substituted with one or more substituents selected from halogen, C1-C4 alkoxy or phenyl. More preferably, R1 is C1~C4 alkyl. Even more preferably, R1 is C1-C2 alkyl. Most preferably, R1 is methyl. Preferably, R2a is H or an optionally substituted carbon rnoiety. More preferably, R2a is H. Most preferably, R2a and R2b are each H. Preferably, each R3 is independently selected from OR5 or an optionally substituted carbon moiety. More preferably, each R3 is independently selected from an optionally substituted carbon moiety. Even more preferably, each R3 is independently selected from C1-C6 alkyl optionally substituted with one or more groups selected from halogen or C1-C4 alkoxy, or phenyl optionally substituted with 1-3 groups selected from halogen, C1-C4 alkyl or C1-C4  alkoxy. Most preferably, each R3 is independently selected from C1-C4  alkyl, phenyl or 4-methylphenyl. Preferably, each R5 is independently selected from C1-C6  alkyl optionally substituted with one or more groups selected from halogen or C1-C4  alkoxy. More preferably, each R5 is independently selected from C1-C4  alkyl.<br>
In the method of the present invention the leaving group Y of the starting compound of Formula II is first displaced to give the intermediate compound of Formula V, from which the leaving group X is displaced to give the final product of Formula I. Strong leaving groups are generally suitable for X and Y in the present method. Preferably leaving groups are selected for X and Y in view of their relative susceptibility, to displacement so that leaving group Y .is displaced before leaving group X. However, as nucleophilic substitution is inherently more rapid on acyl centers compared to the 2-position of esters, most combinations of strong leaving groups work well for X and Y in the present method. X is preferably Cl, Br, I or a sulfonate (e.g., OS(O)2CH3, OS(O)2CF3, OS(O)2Ph, OS(O)2Ph-4-, Me). More preferably, X is Cl, Br or I. Even more preferably, X is Cl or Br. Most preferably, X is Br. Y is preferably F, Cl, Br or I. More preferably, Y is Cl or Br. Most preferably, Y is Cl. The combination of X being Br and Y being Cl is notable for rapid condensation according to the method of the present invention to give a compound of Formula I in high yield and regioselectivity.<br>
The reaction is conducted in the presence of a suitable acid scavenger. Suitable acid scavengers for the method of the present invention include bases and also chemical compounds not typically considered bases but nevertheless capable of reacting with and consuming strong acids such as hydrogen chloride and hydrogen bromide. Nonbasic acid scavengers include epoxides such as propylene oxide and olefins such as 2-methylpropene. Bases include ionic bases and nonionic bases. Nonionic bases include organic amines. Organic bases providing best results include amines that are only moderately basic and nucleophilic, e.g., N,N-diethylaniline. Useful ionic bases include fluorides, oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, carboxylates and phosphates of alkali and alkaline earth metal elements. Examples include NaF, MgO, CaO, LiHC03, Li2CO3, LiOH, NaOAc, NaHCO3, Na2C03, Na2HPO4, Na3P04, KHC03, K2CO3, K2HPO4 and K3P04. Giving particularly good results are inorganic carbonate and phosphate bases comprising alkali metal 'elements (e.g., LiHCO3, Li2CO3, Li2HPO4, Li3PO4, NaHC03, Na2CO3, Na2HPO4 and Na3P04). Of these, preferred for their low cost as well as excellent results are NaHCO3, Na2CO3, Na2HP04 and Na3PO4. Particularly preferred is NaHCO3 and Na3PO4. Most preferred is NaHC03. Preferably at least two equivalents of acid scavenger is employed in the method of the present invention. Typically about 2 to 2.5 equivalents of acid scavenger is used. For the reaction of relatively acidic hydrazines of Formula III wherein, for example, L is --S(O)2R3 it may be advantagous to add first an acid scavenger that is not a strong base to avoid deprotonating the hydrazine moiety of Formula III during the formation of the intermediate of Formula V and then add a strong base to deprotonate the hydrazine moiety of Formula V to accelerate the condensation to give the final product of Formula I.<br>
Suitable solvents include polar aprotic solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide, methyl sulfoxide, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, acetonitrile and the like.  Nitrile solvents<br>
such as acetonitrile, proprionitrile and butyronitrile often provide optimal yields and product purities. Particularly preferred for its low cost and excellent utility as solvent for the method of this invention is acetonitrile.<br>
The method of the present invention can be conducted over a wide temperature range, but is typically conducted at temperatures between about -10 and 80 °C. While the intermediate compound of Formula V can be formed at 80 °C or higher, the best yields and purities are often achieved by forming it at lower temperature, such as between about 0 °C and ambient temperature (e.g., about 15 to 25 °C). Typically during the addition of reactants the reaction mixture is cooled to a temperature of -5 to 5 °C, most conveniently about 0 °C. After the reactants have beeri combined, the temperature is typically increased to near ambient temperature. To then increase the rate of cyclization of the compound of Formula V to the compound of Formula I, a temperature in the range of about 30 to 80 °C is usually employed, more typically about 30 to 60 °C, and most typically about 40 °C.<br>
The product of Formula I can be isolated by the usual methods well known to those skilled in the art such as evaporation of solvent, chromatography and crystallization. Addition of an acid with a pKa in the range of 2 to 5 can buffer excess base and prevent saponification and degradation of the product of Formula I during isolation steps involving water and heat (such as removal of solvent by distillation). Acetic acid works well for this purpose. Also, addition of such acids as acetic acid to concentrated solutions of certain products of Formula I can promote their crystallization.<br>
Preferred methods of this invention include the method wherein the starting compound of Formula II is Formula IIa, the starting compound of Formula III is Formula IIIa and the product compound of Formula I is Formula Ia as shown in Scheme 3 below.<br>

One skilled in the art will recognize that Formula ia is a subgenus of Formula I, Formula Ila is subgenus of Formula II, Formula IIIa is a subgenus of Formula III, and Formula Va is a subgenus of Formula V.<br>
While a wide range of optionally substituted carbon moieties as already described are useful as R1 in esters of Formula ia for the method of Scheme 3, commonly R1 is a radical containing up to 18 carbon atoms and selected from alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl; and benzyl and phenyl, each optionally substituted with alkyl and halogen. Preferably R1 is C1-C4 alkyl, more preferably R1 is C1-C2 alkyl, and most preferably R1 is methyl. Preferably X is Cl or Br, and more preferably X is Br. Preferably Y is Cl. Of note is the method shown in Scheme 3 wherein Z is N, n is 1 and R9 is Cl or Br and is located at the 3-position.<br>
As shown in Scheme 4, compounds of Formula II can be prepared by treating the corresponding carboxylic acids of Formula VI with the appropriate reagents to convert the hydroxy radical of the carboxylic acid function into a leaving group.<br>
Scheme 4 (Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R2a, R2b, X and Y are as previously defined.<br>
For example, a compound of Formula IIb (i.e. Formula II wherein Y is Cl) can be prepared by contacting a corresponding carboxylic acid of Formula VI with a reagent for converting carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides, such as thionyl chloride (S(O)C12) as shown in Scheme 5.<br>
18 Scheme (Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R2a, R2b and X are as previously defined.<br>
The reaction of the carboxylic acid of Formula VI with thionyl chloride is typically conducted in the presence of a moderately polar aprotic solvent such as dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, benzene, chlorobenzene or toluene. The reaction can be catalyzed by addition of N,N-dimethylfonnamide. Typically the reaction temperature is in the range of about 30 to 80 °C. When dichloromethane is used as solvent, the reaction is conveniently conducted at about its boiling point of 40 °C. Rapid removal of hydrogen chloride generated by the reaction is desirable and can be facilitated by boiling the solvent to limit the solubility of the hydrogen chloride. Because of its moderate boiling point, dichloromethane is preferred as a solvent.<br>
Because of compounds of Formula VI can be easily and inexpensively converted to compounds of Formula II wherein Y is Cl (i.e. Formula IIb), Y being Cl is preferred for the method of the present invention. However, other leaving groups are also useful as Y in the present method. Compounds of Formula II wherein Y is a leaving group other than  Cl can be prepared either directly from the corresponding compounds of Formula VI or from the compounds of Formula II b by methods well known to those skilled in the art (see, for example, H.W. Johnson &amp; D. E. Bublitz, /. Am. Chem. Soc. 1958, 80, 3150-3152 (VI to n (Y is Br)); G. Olah et ah, Chem. Ber. 1956, 89, 862-864 (lib to II (Y is F)); R. N. Haszeldine, J. Chem. Soc. 1951, 584-587 (lIb to II (Y is I))).<br>
As discussed above, acyl halide compounds of Formula II are easily prepared from the corresponding carboxylic acids of Formula VI by contacting with thionyl chloride (for Y is Cl) or other reagents for Y being another halide, or by contacting a compound of Formula II wherein Y is Cl with the appropriate reagent to convert Y to another halogen. Even though acyl halide compounds of Formula II are easily prepared, they are less simply isolated in 100% concentration, because they are typically not crystalline and at reduced pressures commonly available for chemical manufacturing their boiling points are typically higher -than their decomposition temperatures, thereby precluding distilling them. Although solvents can be removed from acyl halide compounds of Formula II by such methods as evaporation or distillation of the solvent at reduced pressure, typically sufficient solvent is entrained to cause the concentration of the Formula II compound to remain below 100%. However, the solvents used to prepare the compounds of Formula II are generally compatible with the method of the present invention, and therefore the method of the present<br>
invention works well starting with compositions of compounds of Formula II wherein the concentration of Formula II compound is less than 100%.   Therefore a composition of Formula II compound useful for the method of the present invention typically also comprises a solvent, particularly a solvent used to prepare the Formula II compound. Typical solvents include dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, benzene, chlorobenzene or toluene. Typically said composition comprises about 20 to 99% of Formula II compound on a weight basis. Preferably said composition comprises about 40 to 99 weight % of Formula II compound.   More preferably said composition comprises about 50 to 99 weight % of Formula II compound. .Also preferably said composition comprises at least about 80% of Formula II compound based  on the sum of the weight of the Formula II compound (including all stereoisomers) and the weights of regioisomers of the Formula II compound in the composition.   (For this calculation, the weight of Formula II compound (including all stereoisomers) is divided by the sum of the weight of the Formula II compound (including all stereoisomers) and the weights of regioisomers of the Formula II compound, and then the resulting division quotient is multiplied by 100%.  The regioisomers of Formula II involve, for example, interchanging the placement of X and R2a or R2b.)- More preferably said composition comprises at least about 90% of the Formula II compound based on the total weight of the Formula II compound and its regioisomers in the composition (i.e. the aforementioned sum of weights). Most preferably said composition comprises at least about 94% of Formula II compound based on the total weight of the Formula II compound and.its regioisomers in the composition.    Preferred is a composition comprising a compound, of Formula II wherein Y is Cl and X is Cl, Br or I, preferably Cl or Br, and more preferably Br. Of note is a composition, including said preferred composition, comprising a compound of Formula II wherein when R2a and R2b are each H, and X and Y are each Cl then R1 is other than benzyl and when R2a and R2b are each phenyl, and X and Y are each Cl, then R1 is other than methyl or ethyl. Particularly preferred is a composition comprising the compound of Formula II wherein R2a and R2b are each H, X.is Br, Y is Cl and R1 is methyl.   Also particularly preferred is a composition comprising the compound of Formula II wherein R2a and R2b are each H, X is Br, Y is Cl and R1 is ethyl.  This invention also pertains to the compounds of Formula II comprised by said compositions, including preferred compositions and compositions of note.<br>
Compounds of Formula VI can be prepared by a variety of chemical routes disclosed in the literature. For example, the compound of Formula VI wherein R2a and R2b are H, X is Br and R1 is ethyl can be prepared as described by U. Aeberhard et al., Helv. Chim. Acta 1983, 66, 2740-2759. The compound of Formula VI wherein R2a and R2b are H, X is Cl and R1 is benzyl can be prepared as described by J. E. Baldwin et al.,, Tetrahedron 1985, 41, 5241. Compounds of Formula VI wherein R2a and R2b are H and X is OS(0)2 Me, and R1 is methyl, ethyl, isopropyl or benzyl can be prepared as described by S. C. Arnold &amp; R. W.<br>
Lenz, Makromol. Chem. Macromol. Symp. 1986, 6, 285-303 and K. Fujishiro et al., Liquid Crystals 1992,12 (3), 417-429. One skilled in the art appreciates that these example routes can be generalized. Of special interest is the compound of Formula VI wherein R2a and R2b are H, X is Br and Rl is methyl, because its crystalline nature facilitates purification. Therefore the present invention also relates to a crystalline composition (e.g., crystals) comprising at least about 90% by weight, preferably at least about 95% by weight, of the compound of Formula VI wherein R2a and R2b are H, X is Br and R1 is methyl. Impurities in said crystalline composition can for example comprise regioisomers of the Formula VI compound and/or the solvent of crystallization entrained in the crystal lattice.<br>
Compounds of Formula III can be prepared by a wide variety of methods- reported in the literature, for example, see G. H. Coleman in Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. 1,1941, 442-445 (L is aryl); O. Diels, Chem. Ber. 1914, 47, 2183-2195 (L is -C(O)R3); L. F. Audrieth &amp; L. H. Diamond, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954, 76, 4869-4871 (Lis tertiary alkyl); L. Friedman et al. in Org.

It is believed that one skilled in the art using the preceding description can utilize the present invention to its fullest extent. The following Example is, therefore, to be construed as merely illustrative, and not limiting of the disclosure in any way whatsoever.

Halogenating reagents that can be used include phosphorus oxyhalides, phosphorus trihalides, phosphorus pentahalides, thionyl chloride, dihalotrialkylphosphoranes, dihalodiphenylphosphoranes, oxalyl chloride, phosgene, sulfur tetrafluoride and • (diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride. Preferred are phosphorus oxyhalides and phosphorus pentahalides. To obtain complete conversion, at least 0.33 equivalents of phosphorus oxyhalide versus the compound of Formula Ia (i.e. the mole ratio of phosphorus oxyhalide to Formula Ia is at least 0.33) should be used, preferably between about 0.33 and 1.2 equivalents. To obtain complete conversion, at least 0.20 equivalents of phosphorus pentahalide versus the compound of Formula Ia should be used, preferably between about 0.20 and 1.0 equivalents.

Alternatively as shown in Scheme 7, compounds of Formula 6 wherein X1 is halogen such as Br or Cl can be prepared by treating the corresponding compounds of Formula 6a wherein X2 is a different halogen (e.g., Cl for making Formula 6 wherein X1 is Br) or a sulfonate group such as methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate or p-toluenesulfonate .with hydrogen bromide or hydrogen chloride, respectively.<br>
Scheme 7<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R9 and n are as previously defined for Formula Ia.<br>
By this method the X2 halogen or sulfonate substituent on the Formula 6a starting compound is replaced with Br or Cl from hydrogen bromide or hydrogen chloride, respectively. The reaction is conducted in a suitable solvent such as dibromomethane, dichloromethane, acetic acid, ethyl acetate or acetonitrile. The reaction can be conducted at or near atmospheric pressure or above atmospheric pressure in a pressure vessel. The hydrogen halide starting material can be added in the form of a gas to the reaction mixture containing the Formula 6a starting compound and solvent. When X2 in the starting compound of Formula 6a is a halogen such as Cl, the reaction is preferably conducted in such a way that the hydrogen halide generated from the reaction is removed by sparging or other suitable means. Alternatively, the hydrogen halide starting material can be first dissolved in an inert solvent in which it is highly soluble (such as acetic acid) before contacting with the starting compound of Formula 6a either neat or in solution. Also when X2 in the starting compound of Formula 6a is a halogen such as Cl, substantially more than one equivalent of hydrogen halide starting material (e.g., 4 to 10 equivalents) is typically needed depending upon the level of conversion desired. One equivalent of hydrogen halide stalling material can provide high conversion when X2 in the starting compound of Formula 6a is a sulfonate group, but when the starting compound of Formula 6a comprises at least one basic function (e.g., a<br>
nitrogen-containing heterocycle), more than one equivalent of hydrogen halide starting material is typically needed. The reaction can be conducted between about 0 and 100 °C, most conveniently near ambient temperature (e.g., about 10 to 40 °C), and more preferably between about 20 and 30 °C. Addition of a Lewis acid catalyst (such as aluminum tribromide for preparing Formula 6 wherein X1 is Br) can facilitate the reaction. The product of Formula 6 is isolated by the usual methods known to those skilled in the art, including extraction, distillation and crystallization.<br>
Starting compounds of Formula 6a wherein X2 is Cl or Br are also of Formula 6 and can be prepared from corresponding compounds of Formula Ia as already described for Scheme 6. Starting compounds of Formula 6a wherein X2 is a sulfonate group can likewise be prepared from corresponding compounds- of Formula Ia by standard methods such as treatment with a sulfonyl chloride (e.g., methanesulfonyl chloride, benzenesulfonyl chloride or p-toluenesulfonyl chloride) and base in a suitable solvent. Suitable solvents include dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile and the like. Suitable bases include tertiary amines (e.g., triethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine) and ionic bases such as potassium carbonate and the like. A tertiary amine is preferred as the base. At least one of equivalent (preferably a small excess, e.g., 5-10%) of the sulfonyl chloride compound and the base relative to the compound Formula Ia is generally used to give complete conversion. The reaction is typically conducted at a temperature between about -50 °C and the boiling point of the solvent, more commonly between about 0 °C and ambient temperature (i.e. about 15 to 30 °C). The reaction is typically complete within a couple hours to several days; the progress of the reaction can by monitored by, such techniques known to those skilled in the art as thin layer chromatography and analysis of the 1HNMR spectrum. The reaction mixture is then worked up, such as by washing with water, drying the organic phase and evaporating the solvent. The desired product, a compound of Formula 6a wherein X2 is a sulfonate group, can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, including extraction, crystallization and distillation.<br>
As illustrated in Scheme 8, a compound of Formula 6 is then treated with an oxidizing agent optionally in the presence of acid.<br>
Scheme 8<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R9, Z , X1 and n are as previously defined for Formula 6 in Scheme 6.<br>
A compound of Formula 6 wherein R1 is C1-C4 allcyl is preferred as starting material for this step.   The oxidizing agent can be hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides, potassium persulfate,  sodium  persulfate,   ammonium  persulfate,  potassium  monopersulfate  (e.g., Oxone®) or potassium permanganate.     To obtain complete conversion,  at least one equivalent of oxidizing agent versus the compound of Formula 6 should be used, preferably from about one to two equivalents. This oxidation is typically carried out in the presence of a solvent. The solvent can be an ether, such as tetrahydrofuran, p-dioxane and the like, an organic ester, such as ethyl acetate, dimethyl carbonate and the like, or a polar aprotic organic such as N, N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile and the like. Acids suitable for use in the oxidation step include inorganic acids, such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids, such as acetic acid, benzoic acid and the like.   The acid, when used, should be used in greater than 0.1 equivalents versus the compound of Formula 6. To obtain complete conversion, one to five equivalents of acid can be used.   For the compounds of Formula 6 wherein Z is CR10, the preferred oxidant is hydrogen peroxide and the oxidation is preferably carried out in the absence of acid. For the compounds of Formula 6 wherein Z is N, the preferred oxidant is potassium persulfate and the oxidation is preferably carried out in the presence of sulfuric acid. The reaction can be carried out by mixing the compound of Formula 6 in the desired solvent and, if used, the acid.  The oxidant can then be added at a convenient rate. The reaction temperature is typically varied from as low as about 0 °C up to the boiling point of the solvent in order to obtain a reasonable reaction time to complete the reaction, preferably less than 8 hours. The desired product, a compound of Formula 7 can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, including extraction, chromatography, crystallization and distillation.<br>
Carboxylic acid compounds of Formula 7 wherein R1 is H can be prepared by hydrolysis from corresponding ester compounds of Formula 7 wherein, for example, R1 is C1-C4 alkyl. Carboxylic ester compounds can be converted to carboxylic acid compounds by numerous methods including nucleophilic cleavage under anhydrous conditions or hydrolytic methods involving the use of either acids or bases (see T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 1991, pp. 224—269 for a review of methods). For compounds of Formula 7, base-catalyzed hydrolytic methods are preferred. Suitable bases include alkali metal (such as lithium, sodium or potassium) hydroxides. For example, the ester can be dissolved in a mixture of water and an alcohol such as ethanol. Upon treatment with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, the ester is saponified to provide the sodium or potassium salt of the carboxylic acid. Acidification with a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, yields the carboxylic acid of Formula 7 wherein R1 is H. The carboxylic acid can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, including extraction, distillation and crystallization.<br>
Coupling of a pyrazolecarboxylic acid of Formula 7 wherein R1 is H with an anthranilic acid of Formula 8 provides the benzoxazinone of Formula 9. In Scheme 9, a benzoxazinone of Formula 9 is prepared directly via sequential addition of methanesulfonyl chloride in the presence of a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or pyridine to a pyrazolecarboxylic acid of Formula 7 wherein R1 is H, followed by the addition of an anthranilic acid of Formula 8, followed by a second addition of tertiary amine and methanesulfonyl chloride.<br>
Scheme 9<br>

wherein R6, R7, R9, X1, Z and n are as defined for Formula IV.<br>
This procedure generally affords good yields of the benzoxazinone.<br>
Scheme. 10 depicts an alternate preparation for benzoxazinones of Formula 9 involving coupling of a pyrazole acid chloride of Formula 11 with an isatoic anhydride of Formula 10 to provide the Formula 9 benzoxazinone directly.<br>
Scheme 10<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R6, R7, R9, X1, Z and n are as defined for Formula IV.<br>
Solvents such as pyridine or pyridine/acetonitrile are suitable for this reaction. The acid chlorides of Formula 11 are available from the corresponding acids of Formula 7 wherein R1 is H by known procedures such as chlorination with thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride.<br>
Compounds of Formula IV can be prepared by the reaction of benzoxazinones of Formula 9 with C1-C4 alkylamines and (C1-C4  alkyl)(methyl)amines of Formula 12 as outlined in Scheme 11.<br>
Scheme 11<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R6, R7, R8a, R8b, R9, X1, Z and n are as previously defined.<br>
The reaction can be run neat or in a variety of suitable solvents including acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, dichlpromethane or chloroform with optimum temperatures ranging from room temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent. The general reaction of benzoxazinones with amines to produce anthranilamides is well documented in the chemical literature. For a review of benzoxazinone chemistry see Jakobsen et al., Biorganic and Medicinal Chemistry 2000, 5, 2095-2103 and references cited within. See also Coppola, J.
