MEDICAL DEVICE COMPRISING A BIO-COMPATIBLE POLYMERIC PRODUCT WITH A LAYERED STRUCTURE<br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to polymers and products produced by polymers. It discloses a method for enhancing the quality of polymer products, especially polymeric products that are to be exposed to pressure, impact, wear and tear. The polymers disclosed herein are particularly useful for cartilage substitution and for products to be utilised in medical devices. Especially the product can be used as an artificial joint spacer made to replace the missing cartilage, so the joint can stay mobile. All patent and non-patent references cited in the present application, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
Background of invention<br>
Many prosthetic medical devices are implanted into load-bearing joints such as knees, hips, etc. As such, these prosthetic devices must be very strong and possess a high degree of wear resistance. Presently, the prosthetic medical device industry has utilised various metais and polymers and combinations thereof to fabricate prosthetic devices. Unfortunately, both metals and polymers have drawbacks. For example, metals such as stainless steel, tungsten and titanium, and alloys thereof, may succumb to the corrosive environment of the body and eventually begin to wear. Such wear may result in fine metallic particles being scraped away from the contact surface of the device and into surrounding tissue and bone which may potentially cause pathogenic problems. Polymers, such as polyethylene, polypropylene and nylons may also exhibit wear and may consequently produce particles which diffuse into tissue and bone. Both metallic and polymeric particles shed from these orosthetic medical devices are of concern because they may be inherently reactive with the tissue and bone they contact, thus possibly causing tissue degradation or necrosis.<br>
Many medical devices are implanted into load-bearing joints such as knees, hips, etc, or utilised in the human body where mechanical function provide high strength or shape stability such as heart valves, breast prosthesis, stent, catheter, etc. As such, these medical devices must be very strong and possess a high degree of wear resistance. Prosthetic medical devices manufacturers constantly work toward<br><br>
developing better products by improving their physical properties. Improved wear resistance, for example, is a desirable quality to impart to a prosthetic medical device. Improving wear resistance without losing strength or causing oxidative degradation is a difficult balance to obtain.<br>
Generally, joint damage, such as cartilage damage, is treated by replacing the joint with an artificial joint. However, serious complications are caused by the replacement of artificial joints, in particular a high occurrence rate of loosening problems resulting in breakage of the bones around the artificial joint In the case of cartilage damage a repair with cartilage substitution placed into intact bones is to be preferred instead of replacing the entire joint.<br>
Various methods have been devised attempting to reduce the wear rate of the load bearing prosthetic medical devices. For polymers, a common practice within the prosthetic medical device industry is to use cross-linked polymers and resins to form the medical device. Polymers are commonly cross-linked by chemical catalysts or irradiation exposure. Most cross-finking methodologies do result in greater wear resistance. However, indiscriminate or uncontrolled cross-linking may result in the formation of a weakened polymeric matrix, not capable of withstanding the enormous pressures placed on the devices in the patient resulting in degradative wear as described above.<br>
One common practice within the medica! device industry is to use cross-linked polymers and resins to form the medical device. "Cross-linked" polymers are defined as polymeric materials which have been subjected to chemical or radiation-initiated activation resulting in dendritic bond formation between and amongst individual polymeric chains yielding new intermolecular and intramolecular networks. These cross-linked networks within the polymer provide chemical and physical properties, which are usually different from the virgin polymer. Such properties include increased wear and creep resistance, durability, etc. Indiscriminate or uncontrolled cross-iinking of the polymeric material comprising the medical device may result in improved wear resistance, but strength and other desirable properties may be sacrificed.<br>
Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (hereinafter referred to as 'UHMW polyethylene' or 'UHMWPE') is commonly used to make prosthetic joints such as artificial<br><br>
hip joints. In recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that tissue necrosis and interface osteolysis, in response to UHMW polyethylene wear debris, are one cause of the long-term loosening failure of prosthetic joints. For example, the process of wear of acetabular cups of UHMW polyethylene in artificial hip joints introduces many microscopic wear particles into the surrounding tissues. The reaction of the body to these particles includes inflammation and deterioration of the tissues, particularly the bone to which the prosthesis is anchored. Eventually, the prosthesis becomes painfully loose and must be revised. It is generally accepted by orthopaedic surgeons and biomaterials scientists that the reaction of tissue to wear debris is the chief cause of long-term failure of such prostheses.<br>
US application 20020007219 describes radiation and melt treated ultra high molecular weight polyethylene prosthetic devices. The reference describes a medical prosthesis for use within the body which is formed of radiation treated ultra high molecular weight polyethylene having substantially no detectable free radicals. Preferred prostheses exhibit reduced production of particles from the prosthesis during wear of the prosthesis, and are substantially oxidation resistant Methods of manufacture of such devices and material used therein are also described.<br>
US application 20020037944 describes crosslinking of polyethylene for low wear using radiation and thermal treatments. Described are methods for enhancing the wear-resistance of polymers, the resulting polymers, and in vivo implants made from such polymers. One embodiment of the invention presents a method whereby a polymer is irradiated, preferably with gamma radiation, then thermally treated, such as by remelting or annealing. The resulting polymeric composition preferably has its most oxidized surface layer removed. Another embodiment of the invention presents a general method for optimizing the wear resistance and desirable physical and/or chemical properties of a polymer by cross-linking and thermally treating it. The resulting polymeric composition is wear-resistant and may be fabricated into an in vivo implant<br>
US application 20010049401 describes chemically crosslinked ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene for artificial human joints. Disclosed is a method for enhancing the wear-resistance of polymers by crosslinking them, especially before irradiation<br><br>
sterilization, in particular, the invention presents the use of chemically crosslinked ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene in in vivo implants.<br>

Finishing treatment of a medical device<br>
The present invention in particular relates to material formulations intended to meet the specifications of durability, bio-compatibility, and strength. These properties are ootainabie by treating polymer materials, such as polyethylene, polypropylene or polyvinylpyrrolidone or combinations and co-polymers thereof as well as precursor materials for polymerisation, with high-energy electrons, gamma rays, photons, mi-<br><br>
crowaves, ion implantation, plasma treatment, annealing, thermal radiation or another radiation to obtain ideal durability and bio-compatibility of the new, modified material. Treatment of the above-mentioned materials with radiation leads to cross-linking of polymers and thereby generating new, modified materials. Preferably, the polymer material is a cross-linked polyethylene or polypropylene material. More preferably the polymer material is a cross-linked polyethylene material.<br>
The properties of the materials to be obtained by the cross-linking process are preferably resistant to tear and wear; and have good compressibility.<br>
The medical devicemay be packed in a pouch, which is suitable for irradiation. Preferred are pouches of aluminium, more preferred are laminated pouches of PE, aluminium and PET, where PE (polyethylene) comprises the inner of the pouches and PET (polyethylene-terephthalat) comprises the outer of the pouches.<br>
A pouch with a medical devicemay be filled with nitrogen before it is made airtight. The medical devices are then subjected to irradiation to cross-link the polymeric material and sterilise the medical device.<br>
In order to increase stability of the medical polymeric device the polymers of the shaped polymer product may be subjected to further treatment, such as cross linking. In a preferred embodiment the cross linking treatment is conducted in order to cross link only a fraction of cross linkable polymers in the product. Accordingly, the products may be cross-linked by radiation, the cross-linking of the polymers may also be done by other methods known to the person skilled in the art. Said radiation may be but is not limited to high-energy electrons, gamma rays, photons, and microwaves. Cross binding the polymers improve the strength of the product. A preferred radiation process is cross-linking of fibres using treatment with accelerated electrons. As the cross-linking process takes place in the amorphous polyethylene regions, the optimal dose will depend on the fraction of amorphous polyethylene in the final device. The optimal radiation dose is preferably close to the gelation dose of polyethylene and thus lie between 10-10,000 kGy (0.1 and 100 Mrad), preferred is between 10 and 300 kGy, most preferred is 200 kGy.<br><br>
The radiation can be performed in one uninterrupted treatment, where the complete dose of radiation is given to the material. The radiation process may also be performed in pulsing or interrupting treatments, where the total dose of radiation is given in 2-15 shorter with an interval of 1 to 60 minute. Preferred is 25 kGy given eight times with 10 min interruption between each radiation treatment (total 200 kGy). More preferred are two times 25 kGy interrupted by 1 to 60 minutes and repeated 4 times with 10 hours to 1 day of interruption.<br>
The radiation may be performed for the entire product or device or only part of the product or device is radiated by using a shield or screen between the irradiation source.<br>
When using radiation, the radiation process described may be followed by annealing. The purpose of annealing is to eliminate long living free radicals by a heat treatment of 80°C for about 1-12 hours in vacuum. More preferred is 70-85°C for about 16-24 hours in an inert atmosphere. Preferred is when the inert atmosphere is Nitrogen.<br>
Typically, a device is prepared by a process comprising the following steps:<br>
•	The device is formed under vacuum by pressing the laminated polymers in a mould of specified dimensions. The polymer is chosen from the above mentioned polymers.<br>
•	After hardening the material as formed, or after swelling in a suitable solvent, the device may be subjected to high-energy electrons, gamma rays or another radiation in order to create cross-linking which will modify the mechanical properties of the material to meet the preferred specifications,<br>
•	Finally, after removal of the swelling solvent, the surface of the material may be treated to achieve good surface properties as described elsewhere.<br>
The medical devices may be subjected to annealing when they are irradiated. Annealing is performed in an oven at about 80GC for a few hours to remove residual free radicals. Or annealing is performed as describee elsewhere herein.<br><br>
Surface coating<br>
The surface of the device can subsequently be treated to modify surface properties such as wetting ability and/or biocompatibility. This surface treatment can be performed by plasma treatment, chemical grafting or by a combination of plasma polymerisation and chemical grafting. The material contacting with the biological surfaces may be smooth, biocompatible, preferably self-lubricating, and it should be wear-resistant so that particles generated due to wear are avoided in that this could otherwise result in foreign body reactions and cause further trouble to the function of the part of organism where the medical device is located.<br>
Furthermore, the surface materia! should preferably be a material or a combination of materials having self-repairing properties so that fissures, cracks or other ruptures on the surface do not exceed uncontrollable levels. However, the surface material is preferably continuous with the material of the rest of the device, e.g. the material may gradually merge into the material of the fabric, film or core of the device. In this context continuous means that the surface material cannot be pulled away from the material beneath.<br>
The surface of the material may be chemically treated so as to soften, rigidity or lubricate the surface of the device or parts thereof. The surface of the material may be coated so that the coating confers these properties, or may be treated so as to chemically alter the surface of the device so as to confer any of these properties. Alternatively, certain polymer surfaces may be modified by means of thermal or photolytic energy.<br>
Without being bound by theory it is also believed that a wetted surface reduces the risK of having the immune system recognising the device when implanted, which would otherwise lead to adverse effects of the device.<br>
In one embodiment the surface of the devicemay be coated by a plasma polymerisation, using low-power plasma equipment. The monomers used for the plasma polymerisation are any monomer forming a hydrophilic polymer by plasma polymerisation. Preferred are monomers forming polyvinylpyrrolidone and poiy-ethylene-glycol like polymers, most preferred is 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone.<br><br>

Two phases exists in artificial plasma: A gas-phase comprising an energi corresponding to the surrounding temperature, usually room temperature. In a plasma-phase ions and electrons have an energi at approximately 2-10 eV.<br>
The artificial plasma may be established by exposing a gas with electric field. The pressure of the gas is preferably 0.01-1 mbar. The electric voltage utilised is dependent of different features such as the pressure, the composition of the gas, electrode configuration, the size of the polymerisation chamber, and frequencies of the electricity. The voltage is typically 200-10,000V.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the plasma polymerisation 1-vinyi-2-pyrrolidinone • (VP)may be polymerised to polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in a plasma with low energi. The plasma functions as an initiator for the polymerisation by formation of radicals in the surface of the element to be coated. From the radicals the polymerisation process takes place where monomers of VP polymerise td~PVP. A' low~energy is necessary not to destroy the monomer VP in the gas-phase as well as the polymerised PVP. In a preferred embodiment the energy is 0.1-1 W/L<br>
In the plasma polymerisation treatment a carrier gas is used, preferred is an inert gas, such as argon or helium.<br><br>

Mechanical properties<br>
The structure of the material of a device may comprise a layered or laminated structure, a core of one material or one or more interposed layers with different properties enabling an overall function of the devise suitable for providing a spacer function and/or to exert pressure distribution of joints and/or to provide at least part of the sliding/rotating movement of joints by internal movement of the device, or relevant part of the device. However, it is preferred that the material itself does not comprise interposed layers resulting in sliding between the layers and thereby tear on the mating surfaces within the device. Accordingly, the body of the device should be one continuous solid or semi-solid material.<br>
Mechanical properties for certain relevant polymers are described by Szycher (Szy-cher, M. (editor), sponsored by SPE, Society of Plastics Engineers, Inc. Biocompatible Polymers, Metals, and Composites, pp. 725-727, 757-61).<br>
Mechanical properties of polymers are controlled by the elastic parameters, the three.moduli: elastic, shear, and compressive moduli. These parameters are theoretically interrelated. A modulus is the ratio between the applied stress and the corresponding deformation. The reciprocals of the moduli are called compliances. The three elastic moduli have the dimension: force per unit area, (N/m2 or Pa). Polymers are not normally ideal elastic bodies, but under load they show (time dependant) viscoelastic properties. By taking the load into consideration, the properties should be viewed according to this dilemma. Also, idea! elastic properties and ultimate properties are influenced by the viscoelastic properties.<br><br>
Ultimate tensile strength is a measure of the stress required to cause the material to rupture in tension. Ultimate elongation is the percent stretch of the material before it ruptures in tension. Elongation (%) is measured as<br>
Elongation (percent) =      Se-Sn  x 100<br>
So<br>
where SB = observed distance between bench marks of the stretched specimen at rupture, and S0 = the original distance between bench marks.<br>
Table 1 - Elastic parameters and their definitions<br><br><br><br>
Examples of ranges of the mechanical properties of the device are mentioned below. However, it should be contemplated that not all of the following characteristics may be fulfilled by the material of the prosthetic device since, as explained above, the numerous properties of the material are theoretically interrelated.

pressure distribution and/or the part which exerts the sliding/rotating movement in<br>
the joint when the joint is loaded has/have one or more of the following propeties<br>
(under biological conditions (37CC, physiological salinity)): A compressive modulus<br>
(K) of at least 2000 MPa, a shear modulus (G) of at least 1 MPa and an elastic<br>
module (E) of at least 10 MPa.     	-		<br>
Furthermore, certain requirements to the material under stress with forces that ultimately leads to disintegration can be expressed. Based on the elasticity parameters for the material, the properties of the material with respect to pressure, elongation, torsion and displacement in the range where the material responds elastic can be estimated. The ultimate limits should preferably be within ± 20% of the range of elastic response. As a consequence thereof, the limits for the ultimate properties<br><br>
(ultimate compression strength, tensile strength, torsional strength, shearing strength) can be derived. Furthermore, the material should have an "ultimate percentage elongation" of at least 20%.<br>
The materials according to the invention may be a "quasi elastic" material. Y. Shiki-nami and H. Kawarada, Biomateriate 19,1998, pp. 617-635, discuss that many materials of biological origin, has a J-form in a stress vs. strain curve, whereas may synthetic materials has an S-form.<br>
Preferably, the critical surface tension (yc) values should be within the "zone of bio-compatibilit/1 corresponding to the range of about 20-30 dynes/cm (as defined by Lelah M. D., Cooper, S.L, Polyurethanes in Medicine- CRC Press, Inc. Boca Raton, Florida, pp. 59-62 and 92-93).<br>

The cup is based on a sandwich construction with a LDPE core reinforced on both sides with UHMWPE fiber fabric.<br>
At the edge metal markers makes it possible to trace the cup when implanted.<br>
The round LDPE collar of the cup makes a cup without sharp edges and captures the metal markers.<br>
Finally a crosslinking of the polymer improves the performance of the LDPE core. The production process includes the following steps:<br><br>
•	injection moulding of base LDPE disk<br>
The LDPE disk is made of pellets/granulates in the injection moulding - process. The disk is approximately five mm. thick and 134 mm in diameter. One standard disk size will later be formed to different size of cups.<br>
•	Pressure consolidation with UHMWPE fiber fabric<br>

The cup goes to the irradiation plant, is irradiated and returns to the production area. The irradiation forms free radicals. The free radicals are<br>
	 very-reactive places in the polymer material, which react to form<br>
crosslinking in the polymer. The irradiation dose is about 200 kGy.<br>
