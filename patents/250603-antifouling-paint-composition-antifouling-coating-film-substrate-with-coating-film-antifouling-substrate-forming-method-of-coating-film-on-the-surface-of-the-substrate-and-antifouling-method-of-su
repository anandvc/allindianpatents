The present invention relates to an antifouling paint composition, an antifouling coating film, a substrate with a coating film, an antifouling substrate, a forming method of coating film on a surface of the substrate and an antifouling method of the substrate.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to an antifouling paint composition, an antifouling coating film formed from the antifouling paint composition, which can effectively prevent the attachment of marine organisms when formed on the surface of the body of a ship by a synergetic effect of the improvement in antibacterial action and renewability of coating film (the synergetic effect is obtained by adding zinc sulfide to a hydrolizable antifouling paint composition), a substrate with a coating film, an antifouling substrate, a forming method of a coating film on a surface of the substrate and an antifouling method of the<br>
substrate.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to an antifouling paint composition, an antifouling coating film formed from the antifouling paint composition, which can effectively prevent the attachment of marine organisms when formed on the surface of the body of a ship by a synergetic effect of the improvement in antibacterial action and renewability of coating film (the synergetic effect is obtained by adding zinc sulfide to a hydrolizable antifouling paint composition) , a substrate with a coating film, an antifouling substrate, a forming method of a coating film on a surface of the substrate and an antifouling method of the<br>
substrate.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The bottom of ship, submerged structures, fishing nets and the like may be damaged in their appearance and function as the result of the attachment and the proliferation of various aquatic organisms such as animals like oysters, mussels and barnacles, plants like lavers or bacteria on their surface upon the exposure in marine water for a long period of time.<br>
In the case when such aquatic organisms attach especially to the ship bottom and proliferate, the surface roughness of the whole ship increases, possibly leading to a decreased ship speed and increased fuel consumption. Moreover, a huge amount of labor and working hours are required for removing such aquatic organisms from the ship bottom. Furthermore, the strength and function of the submerged structures are deteriorated and the longevity of the submerged structures is significantly decreased if decomposition is caused by the attachment and proliferation of bacteria on submerged structures, followed by attachment of slimes (sludgy materials) thereto, and further if the coating film for corrosion proof of the submerged structures such as steel structures is damaged by the attachment and proliferation of large organisms.<br>
Conventionally, in order to prevent such damages, various antifouling paints have been applied to the ship bottom and the like, and various types of antifouling paints have been proposed, which are described in (1) to (9) as mentioned below.<br>
(1)	In Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No.<br>
522734/2003, an antibacterial composition having a biocidal<br>
effect comprising pyrithione or a pyrithione complex and zinc,<br>
copper or silver or a compound thereof (for example, salts,<br>
oxides, hydroxides, sulfates, chlorides, complexes and the<br>
like) is disclosed, and zinc sulfide is specifically disclosed<br>
as a zinc compound, wherein it is described that the<br>
antibacterial composition may be used by adding to an elastomer<br>
such as a styrene-butadiene copolymer, polyacrylate and<br>
silicone rubber and also may be used as a marine paint. However,<br>
a combination system of these compounds and a hydrolyzable<br>
metal polymer is not disclosed.<br>
(2)	In WO No. 2004/057964 pamphlet, an antimicrobial<br>
composition comprising pyrithione or a pyrithione complex, a<br>
zinc compound (such as zinc sulfide) and an organic amine is<br>
disclosed and is suggested to be applicable for antifouling<br>
of the body of ship. However, no description is made for a<br>
coating film forming polymer.<br>
(3)	In Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No.<br>
508639/1998, a marine antifouling paint containing a binder<br>
based composition (such as rosin) and a fiber is disclosed. It is described that a self-polishing polymer may be used as a binder and a zinc sulfide fiber is specifically exemplified as a fiber. Moreover, it is also described that zinc sulfide may be contained as a pigment as necessary.<br>
However, although there are expressions of the self-polishing polymer and the hydrolysable polymer, there is no concrete disclosures and examples for the polymer. In addition, the zinc sulfide fiber is exemplified but no concrete examples are presented in which the polymers are blended.<br>
(4)	In Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No.<br>
346329/2004, which is a divisional application of the above<br>
(2), there is a similar description to the above (2).<br>
(5)	In Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No.<br>
510891/2000, a marine antifouling paint comprising rosin, a<br>
fiber, and a polymer flexibility imparting agent is disclosed,<br>
and it is described that the paint has excellent weather<br>
resistance.  In addition, as the flexibility imparting agent,<br>
there is mentioned a poly (meth) acrylate, a polyester resin and<br>
the like.<br>
However, although a technical idea that a rosin metal salt which is one type of self-polishing polymers is used as the binder resin, there is no technical idea that a self-polishing polymer such as an acryl polymer and a polyester<br>
resin and the like having a metal salt based side chain is used and a self-polishing polymer such as (meth)acrylate ester based polymer having a silyl ester based side chain is used as is the case of the present invention.<br>
(6) Furthermore, in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 502473/2003, there is described a self-polishing antifouling marine paint composition containing a binder copolymer having a side chain terminal group represented by the following Formula (I) : and a fiber, and a zinc sulfide fiber is specifically described as the fiber. In addition, it is described that zinc sulfide may be contained as a pigment as necessary.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
I), R1 to R5 each independently represents an alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and an alkoxy group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, X is &gt;C(=0) and n is an integer 0, 1 or more. ]<br>
Moreover, as the monomer for the synthesis of said binder copolymer, there may be mentioned tri (isopropyl) silylacrylate,<br>
methoxyethylmethacrylate,     methylmethacrylate     and butylmethacrylate and the like.<br>
However, there are problems in the antifouling paint compositions described in the above publications that the resulting coating film may not fully exhibits an antifouling effect because of its low hydrolyzability (the elution property of the resin), causes problems such as poor adhesion and the like at the time of recoating at repair work and the like because of the deposition of an inactive layer on the surface of the coating film.<br>
(7)	Japanese  Patent  Laid-Open  Publication  No.<br>
302989/2001, an antifouling paint, which contains as a binder<br>
a resin having a silylated phosphonate group represented by<br>
the formula (1), -S (0) 2-0- [Si (R4) (R5) -0]n-Si (R1) (R2) R3, [where<br>
R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 each independently represents a hydrocarbon<br>
group such as an alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atoms and<br>
an alkoxy group having 1 to 18 carbon atoms and the like and<br>
n is an integer of 0 to 200.], is disclosed, and a metal<br>
pyrithione containing metal  (Cu,  Zn and the like)  is<br>
exemplified as an antifouling agent.  In addition, zinc<br>
sulfide and the like are exemplified as a pigment and it is<br>
described that they are blended at 1 to 60% of the solid content<br>
volume of the paint.<br>
(8)	In  addition,  in  Japanese  Patent  Laid-Open<br>
Publication No. 5692/2000, zinc sulfide is exemplified as a coloring pigment that may be blended in a paint used for film thickness determination utilizing the color difference between a coating film containing coloring pigments and a coated material.<br>
Furthermore, a hydrolyzable acryl-modified resin or a polyester-modified resin and the like are exemplified as a resin component contained in the paint. It is described that the hydrolyzable acryl-modified resin or the polyester-modified resin have a group represented by formula (1) : -COO-M-Yy (with the proviso that y represents the valence number of M -1, M represents a metal of Cu, Zn, Si and the like, Y represents an alkyl group , a hydroxyl group, a group represented by OOCR1 (R1 is a hydrocarbon group having 10 or more carbon atoms) or a group represented by R2-CO-CH2~CO-R3 (R2 is a divalent group comprising an alkylene group or a phenyl derivative and R3 is a monovalent group comprising an alkyl group or a phenyl derivative)), a group represented by the formula (2) : -N=CHR4 (R4 is a hydrocarbon having 6 or more carbon atoms) or the formula -SOa-NH-R5 (R5 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group) in the side chain.<br>
In the publication, there is an example in which a metal-containing copolymer paint "Ecoloflex" having a hydrolysable, self-polishing side chain terminal,<br>
-COO-M-OOCR1 as a film thickness determination paint is used, but there is no example in which zinc sulfide of a coloring pigment is blended.<br>
(9) In Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 327914/2001, it is described that a first coating may contain a coloring pigment when a silicone rubber final coating film is directly applied on a first coating film comprising a blockpolymer consisted of an organosiloxane unit and an alkyleneoxide unit without via an intermediate coating film, and zinc sulfide is exemplified as a pigment which may be blended. However, there is no examples in which zinc sulfide is blended.<br>
In this way, in the inventions described in the above (1) to (9) , although a hydrolysable resin comprising rosin and a crosslinkable metal salt copolymer is exemplified as a resin and zinc sulfide is exemplified as a coloring agent, any of which is not a disclosure of a technical idea in which attention is paid to the antifouling effect of zinc sulfide itself but is limited to the use of the function as a coloring pigment.<br>
In short, in these prior literatures, there are no technical ideas that the antibacterial action of zinc sulfide in the antifouling coating film obtained by a combination of the zinc sulfide and a hydrolysable resin such as a particular crosslinkable copolymer containing a bond of metal salt is<br>
favorably exerted to improve the antifouling properties by paying attention to the safety to the environment and the antibacterial action of zinc sulfide as is the case of the present invention.<br>

It is preferable in terms of the excellence in the antifouling property of the resultant coating film and the physical properties of the coating film such as especially cracking resistance that the zinc sulfide is contained at an amount of typically 10 to 500 parts by weight, preferably 50 to 200 parts by weight with respect to (the solid content) 100 parts by weight of the hydrolyzable copolymer (A') which is a total amount of said polymers (al) to (a3) . Meanwhile, if the zinc sulfide content is lower than the range mentioned above, there is a tendency that the coating film may not exhibit sufficient antifouling effect and the renewal property of the coating film surface is disturbed, and if the content exceeds the range, physical problems such as cracking tend to occur.<br>
In the present invention, it is preferable in terms of the persistence of the antifouling effect and the surface renewability that said antifouling agent (B) comprises zinc sulfide and an organic antifouling agent (b2), allowing the<br>
resultant coating film to exhibit an antifouling power especially in a highly polluted sea area where the coating film is liable to be soiled seriously.<br>
In the present invention, it is preferable in terms of excellence in the antifouling property of a coating film and the storage stability of the paint that said organic antifouling agent (b2) is at least one of organic antifouling agents selected from the group consisting of a metal-pyrithione represented by the following formula [VI] and a derivative thereof, tri-organic boron and amine complex thereof, and 4,5-dichloro-N-octylisothiazolin-3-one.<br><br>

In  the  present  invention,  it  is  preferable  in<br><br>
condideration of the excellent in the storage stability of a paint and in the balance between consumption property of the coating film and durability of the antifouling property that said organic antifouling agent (b2) is at least one kind of organic antifouling agents selected from the group consisting of zinc pyrithione, triphenylboron-pyridine complex, dimethylphenylboron-(4-isopropyl)pyridine complex and 4,5-dichloro-N-octylisothiazolin-3-one.<br>

Further, as the antifouling agent, a conventionally known antifouling agent may be used in view of exerting a sufficient antifouling property. However, it is preferable that an antifouling agent that has a relatively large environmental burden, for example, cuprous oxide etc. is not substantially used.<br><br><coloring pigments><br>
As coloring agents, various organic and inorganic pigments which are conventionally known can be used.<br>
As organic pigments, carbon black, naphthol red, phthalocyanine blue and the like can be mentioned.<br>
As inorganic pigments, for example, red iron oxide, barites, zinc oxide (ZnO, zinc white), titanium white, yellow iron oxide and the like can be mentioned. Moreover, various coloring agents such as dyes may be contained.<br>
In the present invention, as inorganic coloring pigments, any of red iron oxide, titanium white and yellow iron oxide is especially preferable in terms of tinting strength. Said organic pigments are also preferable in the point that they may provide a coating film having a brilliant color and cause less discoloration. <extender pigment><br>
An extender pigment is a pigment which has a small refractive index and may not hide a coated surface because it is transparent when blending with oil and varnish. As such extender pigments, there are mentioned, for example, talc, silica, mica, clay, zinc oxide, calcium carbonate which is also used as an antiprecipitation agent, kaolin, aluminum white, white carbon which is also used as a frosting agent, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, barium carbonate, barium<br>
sulfate and the like, among which an extender pigment selected from the group consisting of zinc oxide, talc, silica, mica, clay,  calcium carbonate,  kaolin and barium sulfate are preferable.<br>
Especially when zinc oxide is blended, it is preferable in consideration of the durability of the consumption property and attachment property of the resultant coating film that said zinc oxide is contained at an amount of typically 10 to 300 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the copolymer (A) solid content, and is contained at an amount of 1 to 40 % by weight in the antifouling paint composition.<br>
These extender pigments are used alone or in combination of two or more thereof. In addition, the consumption degree of a coating film may be adjusted depending on the kind of extender pigments.<br>
In the present invention, when talc is contained as an extender pigment in the antifouling paint composition in consideration of a cost reduction and extending effect of the resultant paint, and the transparency and covering property of the resultant coating film, it is preferable that talc is contained at an amount of 5 to 300 parts by weight, preferably 5 to 200 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of a hydrolyzable copolymer (A). In addition, when talc is contained in this way, it is preferable in terms of absence<br>

These plasticizers contribute to the improvement in cracking resistance of the coating film (antifouling coating film) formed from the resultant antifouling paint compositions, among which plasticizers, chlorinated paraffin (paraffin chloride) is preferably used.<br>
A chlorinated paraffin (paraffin chloride) blended as a plasticizer to the antifouling paint composition of the present invention may be linear or branched and may be liquid or solid (powder) at room temperature. With regard to this chlorinated paraffin, the average number of caron atoms is typically from 8 to 30, preferably 10 to 26, the number average<br>
molecular weight is typically 200 to 1200, preferably 300 to 1100, the viscosity is typically 1 or more (poise/25'C ) , preferably 1.2 or more (poise/25°C) , and the specific gravity is 1.05 to 1.80/25°C, preferably 1.10 to 1.70/25°C. A coating film with less cracking and peeling can be formed by using the antifouling paint composition, if a chlorinated paraffin with these carbon number is used. Incidentally, if the average number of carbon atoms of the chlorinated paraffin is less than 8, the suppression effect of cracking may be insufficient, and if said number exceeds 30, the consumption property (renewability) and antifouling property of the resultant coating film surface may be poor. Moreover, the chlorination ratio (chlorine content) of the chlorinated paraffin is typically 35 to 75%, preferably 35 to 65%. If a chlorinated paraffin having such chlorination ratio is used, a coating film with less racking and peeling can be formed by using the resultant antifouling paint composition. As such a chlorinated paraffin, there are mentioned "ToyoparaxlSO", "ToyoparaxA-70" and the like produced by Tosoh Corp.<br>
In the present invention, when a plasticizer represented by a chlorinated paraffin is blended, it is preferable in terms of the reduction of cracking resistance, reduction in discoloration and the improvement in water resistance of a coating film that such a plasticizer is contained at an amount<br>
of 0.05 to 40 % by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of said hydrolyzable copolymer (A).<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention, it is preferable that a plasticizer represented by a chlorinated paraffin is contained at an amount of 1 to 5 % by weight in an antifouling paint composition (that is, in which a volatile component such as a solvent is included).
