				<td>ULTRASONIC DIAGNOSTIC APPARATUS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus, and more<br>
particularly to an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus in which key switches can be<br>
operated without awkwardly bending the elbow or wrist, and such an ultrasonic<br>
diagnostic apparatus in which the key switch can be arranged aesthetically in the<br>
appearance design while preventing confusion in operation and eliminating dead<br>
space within the area occupied by the key switches.<br>
RELATED ART<br>
Fig. 1 is a plan view showing an example of an operation panel in a<br>
conventional ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus.<br>
The operation panel 51 is provided with an LCD display 21, vertical key<br>
switches 52 and horizontal key switches 53 for increasing/decreasing setting values<br>
relating to imaging and display of an ultrasonic image, an operation pad 22 and a<br>
keyboard 23.<br>
The vertical key switches 52 are associated with adjustment in which an<br>
increase/decrease of a setting value gives the impression of an increase/decrease in the<br>
vertical direction. For example, adjustment of the baseline shift in an ultrasonic<br>
Doppler technique gives the impression of vertical moving of a zero frequency axis,<br>
and therefore the adjustment is performed by the vertical key switch 52.<br>
The horizontal key switches 53 are associated with adjustment in which an<br>
increase/decrease of a setting value gives the impression of an increase/decrease in the<br>
horizontal direction. For example, adjustment of the cutoff frequency gives the<br>
impression of horizontal shifting of the filter characteristic in a frequency<br>
characteristic diagram having a frequency axis as a horizontal axis, and therefore the<br>
adjustment is performed by the horizontal key switch 53.<br>
In the conventional ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus, since the vertical and<br>
horizontal key switches 52 and 53 are disposed together on the operation panel 51, the<br>
following problems arise:<br>
(1) When an operation is performed using the right index ringer and<br>
middle finger, for example, the vertical key switches 52 have to be operated with the<br>
elbow opened outward and the wrist bent inward. Similarly, the horizontal switches<br>
53 have to be operated with the elbow shut inward and the wrist bent outward. In<br>
other words, the elbow and wrist must be awkwardly bent and the operator suffers<br>
from difficulty.<br>
(2) When the vertical and horizontal key switches 52 and 53 are<br>
disposed together, since the operational directions of the vertical and horizontal key<br>
switches 52 and 53 are different, confusion in operation may result<br>
(3) When the vertical and horizontal key switches 52 and 53 are<br>
disposed together, dead space is apt to occur within the area occupied by the key<br>
switches on the operation panel 51 and in the space occupied by switch bodies in the<br>
interior of the operation panel 51.<br>
(4) When the vertical and horizontal key switches 52 and 53 are<br>
disposed together, the aesthetics of the appearance design is degraded.<br>
