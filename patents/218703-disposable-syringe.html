				<td>This invention relates to a disposable syringe, more<br>
particularly to a disposable syringe which enables a needle<br>
cannula to be retracted within an encasing member.<br>
Exposed needles of conventional disposable syringes may prick<br>
the fingers of health care workers after use, and may infect them<br>
with contagious fatal diseases, such as AIDS, hepatitis, etc.<br>
To reduce the risk of accidents, a disposable syringe with a<br>
retractable needle has been developed. However, such a<br>
disposable syringe suffers from the following disadvantages in<br>
actual use:<br>
1. After injection, a plunger of the disposable syringe has<br>
to be first pushed forwardly to couple with the needle and then<br>
pulled rearwardly so as to pull the needle into the syringe body.<br>
Thereafter, the plunger has to be broken at a certain point to<br>
prevent inadvertent pressing of the plunger, which may cause the<br>
needle to project from the syringe body once again. Such a<br>
retracting procedure is relatively complicated, and<br>
considerations have to be given to whether the plunger can be<br>
firmly coupled to the needle in order to pull the needle that<br>
engages the front end of the syringe body. The coupling of the<br>
plunger to the needle and the subsequent pulling of the needle<br>
through the plunger are difficult to conduct since the engagement<br>
between the needle and the syringe body poses a certain<br>
resistance.<br>
2 . In order to facilitate retraction of the needle, a greater<br>
number of component parts are provided to couple the plunger to<br>
the needle, which, however, increases costs and complicates<br>
assembly.<br>
3. Due to the provision of more component parts, the amount<br>
of residual medication or blood trapped in dead corners of the<br>
disposable syringe also increases to result in aggravated<br>
environmental pollution problem.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a disposable<br>
syringe which has a relatively simple construction and which<br>
enables retraction of a needle after use in a simple operating<br>
manner.<br>
According to this invention, the disposable syringe includes<br>
a syringe body, a plunger, an encasing member and a retaining<br>
member.<br>
The syringe body includes a surrounding barrel wall which has<br>
an axis, front and rear surrounding ends opposite to each other<br>
in a longitudinal direction parallel to the axis, an outer<br>
surrounding wall surface, and an inner surrounding wall surface<br>
opposite to the outer surrounding wall surface. The inner<br>
surrounding wall surface confines an accommodation chamber. A<br>
front end wall extends from the front surrounding end radially<br>
and towards the axis to confine an internal port that is in fluid<br>
communication with the accommodation chamber. A needle cannula<br>
is disposed to extend in the longitudinal direction. A needle<br>
hub is disposed to secure the needle cannula to the front end<br>
wall such that the needle cannula is in fluid communication with<br>
the accommodation chamber through the internal port in the<br>
longitudinal direction.<br>
The plunger includes a head portion which is disposed to be<br>
movable in the accommodation chamber and which is in slidable<br>
contact with the inner surrounding wall surface, and a stem<br>
portion which extends from the head portion in the longitudinal<br>
direction and outwardly of the rear surrounding end so as to be<br>
manually operated.<br>
The encasing member is configured to be sleevable on the<br>
syringe body from the needle hub, and includes surrounding front<br>
and rear segments. The surrounding front segment surrounds the<br>
needle hub, and permits the needle cannula to extend outwardly<br>
thereof and to be retractable relative thereto. The surrounding<br>
rear segment extends from the surrounding front segment in the<br>
longitudinal direction, is to be sleeved on the surrounding barrel<br>
wall, and has an inner tubular wall surface which confronts and<br>
which is movable relative to the outer surrounding wall surface<br>
between a position of use, where the front end wall is closer<br>
to the surrounding front segment, and where the needle cannula<br>
extends outwardly of the surrounding front segment, and a disposal<br>
position, where the front end wall is remote from the surrounding<br>
front segment, and where the needle cannula is disposed inwardly<br>
of the surrounding front segment as a result of withdrawal of<br>
the needle hub from the surrounding front segment.<br>
The retaining member is disposed between the inner tubular<br>
wall surface and the outer surrounding wall surface to arrest<br>
unforced movement of the surrounding barrel wall in the position<br>
of use.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present invention will<br>

Before the present invention is described in greater detail,<br>
it should be noted that same reference numerals have been used<br>
to denote like elements throughout the specification.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 to 3, the first preferred embodiment of<br>
a disposable syringe according to the present invention is shown<br>
to comprise a syringe body 2, a plunger 3, an encasing member<br>
1, a retaining member, and a tip protector 4.<br>
The syringe body 2 includes a surrounding barrel wall 23, a<br>
front end wall 24, a needle cannula 26, and a needle hub 25. The<br>
surrounding barrel wall 23 defines an axis (X), and has front<br>
and rear surrounding ends 230,232 opposite to each other in a<br>
longitudinal direction parallel to the axis (X) . The surrounding<br>
barrel wall 23 has an outer surrounding wall surface 233 and an<br>
inner surrounding wall surface 239 opposite to the outer<br>
surrounding wall surface 233. The inner surrounding wall surface<br>
239 confines an accommodation chamber 21. The front end wall 24<br>
extends from the front surrounding end 230 radially and towards<br>
the axis (X) to confine an internal port 241 that is in fluid<br>
communication with the accommodation chamber 21. An annular<br>
retaining groove 234 is formed in the outer surrounding wall<br>
surface 233 adjacent to the front end wall 24.<br>
The needle hub 25 is integrally formed with the front end wall<br>
24, and extends from the front end wall 24 in the longitudinal<br>
direction to terminate at an insert end 251. The needle cannula<br>
26 includes a secured end 261 which is secured to the needle hub<br>
25 from the insert end 251, and a cannula body which extends from<br>
the secured end 261 in the longitudinal direction to terminate<br>
at a tip end 262 that is disposed outwardly of the needle hub<br>
25 such that the needle cannula 26 is in fluid communication with<br>
the accommodation chamber 21 through the internal port 241. The<br>
needle hub 25 further has a plurality of ribs 252 which are<br>
displaced angularly from one another about the axis (X) , and each<br>
of which extends radially and outwardly.<br>
The plunger 3 includes a head portion 31 which is disposed<br>
to be movable in the accommodation chamber 21 and which is in<br>
slidable contact with the inner surrounding wall surface 239,<br>
and a stem portion 32 which extends from the head portion 31 in<br>
the longitudinal direction and outwardly of the rear surrounding<br>
end 232 of the surrounding barrel wall 23 so as to be manually<br>
operated.<br>
The encasing member 1 is sleevable on the syringe body 2 from<br>
the needle hub 25. The encasing member 1 includes a surrounding<br>
front segment 13 and a surrounding rear segment 12 which extends<br>
from the surrounding front segment 13 in the longitudinal<br>
direction. The surrounding front and rear segments 13,12 have<br>
a smaller-diameter inner front wall surface 131 and a<br>
larger-diameter inner tubular wall surface 127, respectively,<br>
so as to form a surrounding shoulder portion 14 therebetween.<br>
The surrounding front segment 13 surrounds the needle hub 25,<br>
and has a front open end 132 to permit the needle cannula 26 to<br>
extend outwardly thereof and to be retractable relative thereto.<br>
The surrounding rear segment 12 is sleeved on the surrounding<br>
barrel wall 23. Accordingly, the inner tubular wall surface 127<br>
of the surrounding rear segment 12 confronts and is movable<br>
relative to the outer surrounding wall surface 233 of the<br>
surrounding barrel wall 23 between a position of use, as shown<br>
in Fig. 3, where the front end wall 24 abuts against the<br>
surrounding shoulder portion 14, and where the tip end 262 of<br>
the needle cannula 26 extends outwardly of the front open end<br>
132 of the front surrounding segment 13, and a disposal position,<br>
as shown in Fig. 4, where the front end wall 24 is remote from<br>
the surrounding front segment 13, and where the tip end 262 of<br>
the needle cannula 26 is disposed inwardly of the surrounding<br>
front segment 13 as a result of withdrawal of the needle hub 25<br>
from the surrounding front segment 13. Moreover, when the<br>
surrounding front segment 13 is brought to be sleeved on the needle<br>
hub 25, the ribs 252 of the needle hub 25 can create an increased<br>
friction force at the inner front wall surface 131, thereby<br>
establishing greater friction engagement between the needle hub<br>
25 and the surrounding front segment 13.<br>
In addition, referring to Figs. 1 and 2, an outer front wall<br>
surface of the surrounding front segment 13 has a rib portion<br>
133 which extends in the longitudinal direction. The tip protector<br>
4 has a sleeve end 41 which is disposed to sleeve on the outer<br>
front wall surface of the surrounding front segment 13. The sleeve<br>
end 41 includes a groove portion which mates with the rib portion<br>
133 to result in a splined engagement between the tip protector<br>
4 and the outer front wall surface of the surrounding front segment<br>
13, thereby ensuring secure shielding of the needle cannula 26.<br>
The retaining member includes male and female screw thread<br>
segments 128,235 which are disposed on the inner tubular wall<br>
surface 127 of the surrounding rear segment 12 and the outer<br>
surrounding wall surface 233 of the surrounding barrel wall 23,<br>
respectively. The male screw thread segment 128 includes a<br>
plurality of angularly displaced ribs and surrounds the axis (X) .<br>
The female screw thread segment 235 is disposed opposite to the<br>
surrounding retaining groove 234 in the longitudinal direction,<br>
and includes a plurality of spirally extending grooves (as shown<br>
in Fig. 2).<br>
When the encasing member 1 is brought over the needle hub 25<br>
and is sleeved on the syringe body 2, the male screw thread segment<br>
128 is angularly engageable with the female screw thread segment<br>
235 by rotation of the syringe body 2 relative to the encasing<br>
member 1 in a counterclockwise direction, until the ribs of the<br>
male screw thread segment 128 reach ends 2351 of the grooves of<br>
the female screw thread segment 235 so as to restrain the<br>
surrounding barrel wall 23 from displacing along the surrounding<br>
rear segment 12 in the longitudinal direction, thereby arresting<br>
unforced movement of the surrounding barrel wall 23 in the<br>
position of use. Therefore, an injection procedure of medication<br>
fluid in the accommodation chamber 21 can be performed by pushing<br>
the stem portion 32 of the plunger 3 towards the front end wall<br>
24.<br>
When the injection procedure has been completed, referring<br>
to Figs. 2 to 4, the surrounding barrel wall 23 is angularly moved<br>
in a clockwise direction relative to the surrounding rear segment<br>
12 so as to disengage the ribs of the male screw thread segment<br>
128 from the grooves of the female screw thread segment 235, and<br>
is displaced in the longitudinal direction remote from the<br>
surrounding front segment 13. Subsequently, the surrounding<br>
barrel wall 23 is pulled in the same direction so as to bring<br>
the surrounding barrel wall 23 from the position of use to the<br>
disposal position, as shown in Fig. 4, such that the male screw<br>
thread segment 128 engages the surrounding retaining groove 234,<br>
thereby restraining the surrounding barrel wall 23 from<br>
displacing along the surrounding rear segment 12 . In this position<br>
as described above, the used needle cannula 26 is disposed within<br>
the encasing member 1 for safe disposal.<br>
Referring to Figs. 5 and 6, the second preferred embodiment<br>
of the disposable syringe according to this invention is shown<br>
to be similar to the aforesaid embodiment in construction. The<br>
disposable syringe of this embodiment further includes a guideway<br>
237 which is disposed on the outer surrounding wall surface 233<br>
of the surrounding barrel wall 23, and which spirally extends<br>
to interconnect the female screw thread segment 235 and the<br>
surrounding retaining groove 234. As such, the male screw thread<br>
segment 128 is angularly movable along the guideway 237 between<br>
the female screw thread segment 235 and the surrounding retaining<br>
groove 234 so as to facilitate the displacement of the surrounding<br>
barrel wall 23 from the position of use to the disposal position.<br>
In addition, the surrounding rear segment 12 of the encasing<br>
member 1 further has an outer tubular wall surface 125 radially<br>
opposite to the inner tubular wall surface 127, and a plurality<br>
of slots 15 which are disposed in the outer tubular wall surface<br>
125, which are spaced apart from each other in the longitudinal<br>
direction, and which extend through the inner tubular wall surface<br>
127 so as to expose a portion of the surrounding barrel wall 23<br>
of the syringe body 2.<br>
Referring to Fig. 7, the third preferred embodiment of the<br>
disposable syringe according to this invention is shown to be<br>
similar to the second embodiment in construction. In this<br>
embodiment, additional slots 16 are formed through the<br>
10<br>
surrounding rear segment 12 of the encasing member 1, and are<br>
disposed diametrically opposite to the slots 15.<br>
Referring to Figs. 8 and 9, the fourth preferred embodiment<br>
of the disposable syringe according to this invention is shown<br>
to be similar to the aforesaid embodiments in construction. The<br>
disposable syringe of this embodiment further comprises a<br>
catheter device 5 which includes a catheter hub 51 and a tubular<br>
catheter 52. In addition, the rib portion 133 of the surrounding<br>
front segment 13 is shorter than that of the aforesaid embodiment<br>
so that a front surrounding sleeved region 134 is formed on the<br>
surrounding front segment 13 and forwardly of the rib portion<br>
133. The catheter hub 51 includes a surrounding hub wall which<br>
confines a duct 511 that extends along the axis, and which has<br>
a sleeve portion 512 that is sleeved on the front surrounding<br>
sleeved region 134, and a tip portion 513 opposite to the sleeve<br>
portion 512 . The tubular catheter 52 includes a proximate segment<br>
521 which is disposed in the tip portion 513 and which extends<br>
along the axis to communicate fluidly with the duct 511, and a<br>
distal segment 522 which extends from the proximate segment 521<br>
along the axis to project outwardly of the tip portion 513. The<br>
cannula body of the needle cannula 26 passes through the tubular<br>
catheter 52 to permit the tip end 262 to project outwardly of<br>
the distal segment 522. Hence, after the encasing member 1, in<br>
which the syringe body 2 is in the disposal position, has been<br>
removed from the catheter hub 51, a transfusion member (not shown)<br>
with medication fluid or an empty barrel (not shown) can be<br>
connected to the catheter hub 51 for administering the medication<br>
fluid into a patient"s vein or for drawing blood.<br>
As illustrated, the disposable syringe of this invention has<br>
the following advantages:<br>
1. By rotation of the syringe body 2 relative to the encasing<br>
member 1 in the clockwise direction to displace the surrounding<br>
barrel wall 23 from the position of use to the disposal position,<br>
the used needle cannula 26 can be retracted into the encasing<br>
member 1, thereby facilitating safe disposal of the disposable<br>
syringe.<br>
2. The disposable syringe has a simple construction that is<br>
easy to fabricate and assemble at a relatively low cost.<br>
3. Since the plunger 3 is in fit contact with the inner<br>
surrounding wall surface 239 of the surrounding barrel wall 23<br>
during the injection procedure, and since there is no component<br>
part on the inner surrounding wall surface 239, the amount of<br>
residual medication or blood trapped in the accommodation chamber<br>
21 can be minimized.<br>
4 . The disposable syringe can serve as an intravenous catheter<br>
inserting device for administering medication fluid into a<br>
patient"s vein or for drawing blood.<br>

direction so as to engage said male screw thread segment (128) when<br>
said surrounding barrel wall (23) is in the disposal position, thereby<br>
restraining said surrounding barrel wall (23) from displacing along said<br>
surrounding rear segment (12).<br>
4. The disposal syringe as claimed in claim 3, wherein a guideway (237)<br>
which is disposed on said outer surrounding wall surface (233), and<br>
which extends to interconnect said female screw thread segment (235)<br>
and said surrounding retaining grove (234) so as to facilitate the<br>
displacement of said surrounding barrel wall (23) from the position of<br>
use to the disposal position.<br>
5. The disposal syringe as claimed in claim 1, wherein said needle hub<br>
(25) is integrally formed with said front end wall (24) and extends<br>
from said front end wall (24) in the longitudinal direction.<br>
6. The disposal syringe as claimed in claim 5, wherein said surrounding<br>
front segment (13) has an inner front wall surface (131) with a<br>
diameter which is smaller than that of said inner tubular wall surface<br>
(127) so as to form a surrounding shoulder portion (14) therebetween,<br>
such that said front end wall (24) abuts against said surrounding<br>
shoulder portion (14) in the position of use.<br>
7. The disposal syringe as claimed in claim 6, wherein said needle hub<br>
(25) has a plurality of ribs (252) displaced angularly fron one another<br>
around the axis (X), each of said ribs (252) extending radially and<br>
outwardly so as to create an increased friction force at said inner front<br>
wall surface (131), thereby establishing greater friction engagement<br>
between said surrounding front segment (13) and said needle hub<br>
(25) when said surrounding front segment (13 is sleeved ons aid<br>
needle hub (25).<br>
8. The disposable syringe as claimed in claim 1, wherein said surrounding<br>
rear segment (12) further has an outer tubular wall surface (125)<br>
radially opposite to said inner tubular wall surface (127), and a<br>
plurality of slots (15) disposed in said outer tubular wall surface (125)<br>
and extending through said inner tubular wall surface (127) so as to<br>
expose a portion of said surrounding barrel wall (23).<br>
9. The disposable syringe as claimed in claim 1, wherein said surrounding<br>
front segment (13) has an outer front wall surface which has a rib<br>
portion (133) extending in the longitudinal direction, said disposable<br>
syringe further comprising a tip protector (4) which has a sleeve end<br>
(41) disposed to sleeve on said outer front wall surface, said sleeve<br>
end (41) including a groove portion which mates with said rib portion<br>
(133) to result in a splined engagement between said tip protector (4)<br>
and said outer front wall surface, thereby ensuring secure shielding of<br>
said needle cannula (26).<br>
A disposable syringe includes an encasing member (1) which is sleevable on a<br>
syringe body (2) from a needle hub (25) of the syringe body (2). A needle<br>
cannula (26) is secured to the needle hub (25) and projects outwardly of a<br>
surrounding front segment (13) of the encasing member (1) in a position of use.<br>
A plunger (3) is slidably disposed in a barrel wall (23) of the syringe body (2) in<br>
a longitudinal direction. The syringe body (2) is movable relative to the encasing<br>
member (1) in the longitudinal direction between the position of use, where the<br>
needle hub (25) is disposed in the surrounding front segment (13), and a<br>
disposal position, where the needle cannula (26) is disposed inwardly of the<br>
surrounding front segment (13) as a result of withdrawal of the needle hub<br>
(25) from the surrounding front segment (13).</td>
