STATOR OF RECIPROCATING MOTOR<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a reciprocating motor, and particularly, to a stator<br>
of a reciprocating motor capable of reduing the number of components and the<br>
number of assembling processes and also reduing dimensional errors of components<br>
in assembling.<br>
Background Art<br>
A motor converts electric energy into kinetic energy. The motor is classified into a<br>
rotating motor that coverts electric energy to a rotational movement force and a re-<br>
ciprocating motor that converts electric energy to a linear movement force.<br>
Figures 1,2 illustrate one embodiment of the reciprocating motor. As shown<br>
therein, the reciprocating motor includes a stator (S) including an outer core 100 and<br>
an inner core 200 inserted in the outer core 100; and a mover 300 movably inserted<br>
between the outer core 100 and the inner core 200 of the stator. The mover 300<br>
includes a permanent magnet 310 and a magnet holder 320 supporting the permanent<br>
magnet 310. A winding coil 400 and a bobbin 510 around which the winding coil 400<br>
is wound are coupled to the inside of the outer core 100, and the winding coil 400 may<br>
be coupled to the inner core 200.<br>
The outer core 100 is formed in a cylindrical shape having a certain diameter and<br>
has a certain width. When viewed in a circumferential direction, the outer core 100<br>
includes an opening groove 110 inwardly opened so that the winding coil 400 and the<br>
bobbin 410 are positioned therein; a pass portion 120, an outer side of the opening<br>
groove 110, through which a flux flows; and pole portions 130, both end portions of<br>
the pass portion 120, for forming poles.<br>
The inner core 200 is formed in a cylindrical shape having a certain width. When<br>
viewed in a circumferential direction, the inner core 200 has a rectangular shape<br>
having certain width and a certain length.<br>
The bobbin 410 is formed in a ring shape, and the winding coil 400 is made sirh<br>
that a wire is wound around the bobbin 410 plural times.<br>
Non-explained reference numerals 411, 140 are a terminal part and a fixing ring, re-<br>
spectively.<br>
Operations of the reciprocating motor will now be described.<br>
When power is applied to the reciprocating motor, a current flows through the<br><br>
winding coil 400, and a flux is formed around the winding coil 400 by the current<br>
flowing through the winding coil 400. The flux formed around the winding coil 400<br>
forms a closed loop along the pass portion 120 of the outer core and the inner core 200.<br>
By interaction between the flux formed along the pass portion 120 of the outer core<br>
and the inner core 200 by the current flowing through the winding coil 400 and the<br>
permanent magnet 310 of the mover, a force is applied to the permanent magnet 310 in<br>
an axial direction. The permanent magnet 310 and the magnet holder 320 are moved in<br>
an axial direction by the force applied to the permanent magnet 310. And, a direction<br>
of the current supplied to the winding coil 400 is alternatively changed, thereby<br>
linearly reciprocating the mover 300.<br>
The outer core 100 and the inner core 200 constituting the stator (S) are various in<br>
shapes and in their production method. In order to minimize loss of flux, the outer core<br>
100 and the inner core 200 of the stator are usually fabricated by stacking a plurality of<br>
thin plates having a prescribed shape.<br>
Figure 3 is a perspective view showing a disassembled outer core of the stator.<br>
As shown therein, the outer core 100 is made such that a plurality of lamination<br>
sheets (LI) having a prescribed shape is stacked at a ring-shaped bobbin 410, and<br>
fixing rings 140 are respectively coupled to both sides of a laminated assembly. The<br>
lamination sheets (LI) are radially and alternatively stacked to the bobbin 410. The<br>
laminated assembly is formed in a cylindrical shape.<br>
Such an outer core 100 of the stator is made as a plurality of lamination sheets (LI)<br>
is radially and alternatively stacked so as to have a ring shape, and fixing rings 140 are<br>
coupled to both sides of the laminated assembly. Accordingly, it is difficult to<br>
assemble the outer core and it takes much time to assemble the outer core, thereby de-<br>
teriorating its productivity.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates another embodiment of the stator.<br>
As shown therein, the outer core of the stator is made sich that a unit laminated<br>
assembly (LU1) with a certain thickness is constructed of a plurality of lamination<br>
sheets (L2), the unit laminated assemblies (LU1) are radially coupled to a ring-shaped<br>
bobbin 410, and fixing rings 140 are respectively coupled to both sides of the plurality<br>
of unit laminated assemblies (LUI).<br>
An inner surface and an outer surface of the unit laminated assembly (LUI) are<br>
formed curved by a plurality of lamination sheets 12. The inner surfaces of the unit<br>
laminated assemblies (LUI) coupled to the bobbin 410 form a circle, and their outer<br>
surfaces are spaced apart from each other, maintaining certain intervals therebetween.<br><br>
The bobbin 410 includes a ring-shaped body 412 having a ring-shaped winding groove (not<br>
shown) in a circumferential direction therein, and a ring-shaped cover 413 for covering the winding<br>
groove of the ring-shaped body 412. The winding coil 400 is positioned in the winding groove of the<br>
ring-shaped body 412, and a terminal part 411 is formed at one side of the ring-shaped body 412.<br>
Such a structure is relatively easy to assemble as compared to the above-mentioned ring-<br>
shaped outer core 100, since unit laminated assemblies (LU1) are coupled to the bobbin 410.<br>
However, such an outer core of the stator is made such that the unit laminated assembly<br>
(LU1) is coupled to the bobbin 410, and then ring-shaped fixing rings 140 are respectively coupled to<br>
both sides of unit laminated assemblies (LU1). Thus, it is not easy to finely fabricate the fixing rings<br>
140, and an assembling operation of making the fixing rings 140 fixedly coupled to both sides of the<br>
unit laminated assemblies (LU1) becomes complicated and difficult. That is, a ring groove 150<br>
formed at the unit laminated assembly (LU1), in which the fixing ring 140 is coupled, is formed by<br>
grooves formed at each lamination sheet (L2) constructing the unit laminated assembly (LU1). At<br>
this time, it is complicated and difficult to form grooves at each lamination sheet 12 and make the<br>
fixing ring 140 coupled to the grooves, thereby deteriorating assembly productivity.<br>
US 2002 / 105247 Al shows a stator of a reciprocating motor comprising an outer and an<br>
inner stator structure. The outer structure is composed of a winding coil and a plurality of units of<br>
laminated assemblies coupled to the bobbin of the winding coil in the circumferential direction.<br><br>

inner structure, only the outer stator structure is turned implemented around 90° in relation to the<br>
outer stator structure.<br>

Hereinafter, a stator of a reciprocating motor in accordance with the present<br>
invention will now be described in detail with reference to embodiments shown in ac<br>
companying drawings.<br>
Figures 5, 6 are a sectional view and a front view showing a reciprocating motor<br>
having a stator in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, and<br>
Figure 7 is a perspective view showing a partially cutout stator of the reciprocating<br>
motor. The same reference numerals are given to the same parts as the conventional<br>
art.<br>
As shown therein, the reciprocating motor includes a ring-shaped bobbin 500<br>
providing a winding coil 400 therein; a plurality of unit laminated assemblies (LU2)<br>
each constructed by stacking a plurality of lamination sheets and coupled to the bobbin<br>
500 in a circumferential direction; a fixing means integrally formed with the bobbin<br>
500 and fixing the unit lamination sheets (LU2) to the bobbin 500; an inner core 200<br>
inserted in an outer core at a certain interval between itself and a round inner circum-<br>
ferential surface formed by inner surfaces of the unit laminated assembly (LU2); and a<br>
mover 300 movably inserted between the unit laminated assembly (LU2) and the inner<br>
core 200.<br>
The unit laminated assembly (LU2) is constricted of two half-unit laminated<br>
assemblies 600 which are formed to be symmetric to each other on the reference to a<br>
horizontal direction (circumferential direction) of the bobbin 500. Preferably, the<br><br>
the same shape.<br>
The unit laminated assembly (LU2) may not be separated in two but be formed<br>
integrally, and may be implemented variously in shape.<br>
A lamination sheet constricting the half-unit laminated assembly 600 includes a<br>
half pass portion 610 having a certain width and a certain length; a side pass portion<br>
620 formed extended from the half pass portion 610, bent at a right angle; and a pole<br>
portion 630, an end portion of the side pass portion 620.<br>
The shape of the pole portion 630, an end portion of the side pass portion 620, may<br>
be implemented variously in shape.<br>
The half-unit laminated assemblies 600 are positioned at the bobbin 500 with end<br>
portions of the half pass portions 610 contacted to each other, and the two half-unit<br>
laminated assemblies 600 construct one unit laminated assembly (LU2).<br>
The bobbin 500 includes a ring-shaped body portion 510 having a ring-shaped<br>
winding groove 511 in which a winding coil is positioned; a covering portion 520 for<br>
covering the winding groove 511 of the ring-shaped body portion; and a totally-fixing<br>
portion 530 formed extended from the covering portion 520 and for fixing the unit<br>
laminated assembly (LU2) to the bobbin by covering an entire outer surface of the unit<br>
laminated assembly (LU2).<br>
The totally-fixing portion 530 of the bobbin is the fixing means.<br>
The bobbin 500 is made of a molding material having an insulating property.<br>
The winding coil 400 is made as a wire is wound plural times around the ring-<br>
shaped body portion 510 of the bobbin.<br>
The covering portion 520 is formed in a ring shape with a certain thickness and a<br>
certain width, and the width of the covering portion 520 is formed to be the same as<br>
that of the ring-shaped body portion 510.<br>
The unit laminated assembly (LU2) is formed as two separated half-unit laminated<br>
assemblies 600 are coupled to the bobbin 500 so that ends of the half pass portions 610<br>
of the half-unit lamination assemblies are contacted to each other. Then, an inner side<br>
of the half pass portion 610 of the laminated assembly 600 comes in contact with the<br>
covering portion 520 of the bobbin 500, and an inner side of the side pass portion 620<br>
comes in contact with a side surface of the ring-shaped body portion 510 of the bobbin.<br>
That is, the unit laminated assembly (LU2) is coupled to the bobbin, making the<br>
lamination sheets (L3) constricting the unit laminated assembly (LU2) face the center<br>
of the bobbin.<br>
The totally-fixing portion 530 of the bobbin has a certain thickness and is formed in<br><br>
a band shape a width of which is the same as that of the covering portion 520. The<br>
totally-fixing portion 530 covers a portion where two half-unit laminated assemblies<br>
600 constructing the unit laminated assembly (LU2) (a half pass portion of the<br>
laminated sheet) are in contact with each other. At this time, both surfaces and outer<br>
surface of the unit laminated assembly (LU2) are adhered to the totally-fixing portion<br>
530, and the totally-fixing portion 530 is protruded.<br>
A plurality of discharge openings 540 through which moisture is discharged is<br>
formed at the ring-shaped body portion 510 of the bobbin.<br>
The plurality of unit laminated assemblies (LU2) is fixedly coupled to the bobbin<br>
500 by totally-fixing portions 530, respectively.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates another embodiment of the fixing means. The same reference<br>
numerals are given to the same part as in the above embodiment.<br>
As shown therein, the fixing means is formed extended from a covering portion 520<br>
of the bobbin 500 and includes a partially fixing portion 550 for fixing the unit<br>
laminated assembly (LU2) to the bobbin by covering parts of both sides of the unit<br>
laminated assembly (LU2).<br>
The partially-fixing portions 550 for respectively fixing both sides of the unit<br>
laminated assembly (LU2) to the bobbin are formed in the same shape.<br>
The partially-fixing portion 550 has a certain thickness and a certain width, and its<br>
width is the same as that of the covering portion 520 of the bobbin.<br>
The partially-fixing portion 550 covers one side surface of the unit laminated<br>
assembly (LU2) and a part of its outer circumferential surface. And an inner surface of<br>
the partially-fixing portion 550 is adhered to one side surface of the unit laminated<br>
assembly (LU2) and its outer ciraimferential surface. The partially-fixing portion 550<br>
is protruded from the unit laminated assembly (LU2).<br>
Preferably, the partially-fixing portion 550 covers 1/3 of an outer surface of the unit<br>
laminated assembly (LU2).<br>
In addition, as shown in Figure 9, ends of partially-fixing portions 550 that fix both<br>
sides of the unit laminated assembly (LU2) are formed to be straight.<br>
As a different modified example of the partially-fixing portion, as shown in Figure<br>
10, ends of partially-fixing portions 550 that fix both sides of the unit laminated<br>
assembly (LU2) are formed to be curved, and the curved lines of the two partially-<br>
fixing portions 550 are formed to be symmetric to each other.<br>
The bobbin 500 provided with the partially-fixing portion 550 is made of a molding<br>
material having an insulating property.<br><br>
If the partially-fixing portion 550 is formed by over-molding, its deformation due to<br>
a constriction caused by cooling can be prevented, which may occur in the totally-<br>
fixing portion 530.<br>
The inner core 200 is formed in a cylindrical shape having a certain width. The<br>
inner core 200 is a laminated assembly constructed of a plurality of quadrangular<br>
shaped lamination sheets having a certain width and a certain length.<br>
One example of a method for fabricating a stator of a reciprocating motor as above<br>
will now be described.<br>
First of all, a plurality of unit laminated assemblies (LU2) is coupled to a bobbin<br>
500 in which a winding coil 400 is positioned. At this time, a totally-fixing portion 530<br>
or a partially-fixing portion 550 have not been made at the bobbin yet. The unit<br>
laminated assembly (LU2) is constructed of two half-unit laminated assemblies 600,<br>
and the two half-unit laminated assemblies 600 are coupled to the bobbin 500 so as to<br>
be in contact with each other. Inner surfaces of the lamination sheets (L3) constricting<br>
the laminated assembly 600 come in contact with the covering portion 520 of the<br>
bobbin, and inner surfaces of the side pass portions 620 of the lamination sheets come<br>
in contact with a side surface of the bobbin 500. The inner surfaces of the unit<br>
laminated assemblies (LU2) coupled to the bobbin 500 form an inner circumferential<br>
surface of a cylindrical shape.<br>
A molding material having art insulating property is over-molded on the bobbin and<br>
the plurality of unit laminated assemblies. The totally-fixing portion, the fixing means,<br>
means the molding material particularly covering the unit laminated assembly<br>
When partially-fixing portions 550, the fixing means, are formed, a molding<br>
material is over-molded only on a part of both sides of the unit laminated assembly<br>
(LU2).<br>
Then, the molding material is cooled.<br>
Hereinafter, operational effect of a stator of a reciprocating motor in accordance<br>
with the present invention will now be described.<br>
In the stator of the reciprocating motor in accordance with the present invention, a<br>
plurality of unit laminated assemblies (LU2) coupled to the bobbin 500 is fixedly<br>
coupled to the bobbin 500 by extendedly forming one side of the bobbin 500. Ac-<br>
cordingly the number of components is relatively reduced, and an assembly process is<br>
simplified.<br>
That is, in the conventional art, ring grooves 150 are formed at each unit laminated<br>
assembly (LU2), and a round-shaped fixing ring 140 is inserted in the ring groove 150<br><br>
by compressing the fixing ring 140. Therefore, a dimension of the ring groove 150 and<br>
that of the fixing ring 140 must be made so as to fit to each other, thereby making<br>
fabrication complicated and requiring relatively many components. However, in the<br>
present invention, there is no need for a ring groove 150 of a unit laminated assembly<br>
(LU2) and a fixing ring 140.<br>
In addition, in the present invention, deformation of a dimension of a unit laminated<br>
assembly (LU2) constructed of a plurality of lamination sheets (L3) is minimized, so<br>
that a gap between the outer core and the inner core, in which a mover 300 is inserted,<br>
is constantly maintained.<br>
Especially, since the present invention has a structure which can be produced by an<br>
over-molding, when a plurality of unit laminated assemblies (LU2) is fixed to the<br>
bobbin by an over-molding, an assembling time is shortened and the number of<br>
assembling processes is reduced.<br>
As so far described, in a stator of a reciprocating motor in accordance with the<br>
present invention is produced, components are easily assembled, and the number of<br>
assembling processes and the number of components are relatively reduced, thereby<br>
improving assembling productivity, reducing fabrication cost, and thus strengthening<br>
the competitiveness of the product.<br>
Also, in the present invention, since a dimensional error of a component is reduced<br>
in assembling, thereby improving reliability of a product.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or<br>
scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover modi-<br>
fications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the<br>
appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br>
