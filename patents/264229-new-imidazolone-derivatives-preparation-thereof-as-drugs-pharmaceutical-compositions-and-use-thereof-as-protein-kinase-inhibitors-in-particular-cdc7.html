				<td>NEW IMIDAZOLINE DERIVATIVES, PREPARATION THEREOF AS<br>
DRUGS, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS, AND USE THEREOF AS<br>
PROTEIN KINASE INHIBITORS, IN PARTICULAR CDC7<br>
The present invention relates to novel derivatives of<br>
imidazolones, the method of preparation thereof, the<br>
novel intermediates obtained, their application as<br>
medicinal products, pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing them and novel uses of said imidazolone<br>
derivatives.<br>
The invention thus relates to novel derivatives of<br>
imidazolones having inhibitory effects with respect to<br>
protein kinases.<br>
The products of the present invention can thus notably<br>
be used for the prevention or the treatment of<br>
disorders that can be controlled by inhibiting the<br>
activity of protein kinases.<br>
The products of the present application, as inhibitors<br>
of protein kinases, can be used quite particularly for<br>
the treatment or prevention of cancers. Cancer is a<br>
disease for which existing treatments are still<br>
inadequate. Certain protein kinases play an important<br>
role in many cancers. Inhibition of these protein<br>
kinases is potentially important in the chemotherapy of<br>
cancers, notably for suppressing tumour growth or<br>
survival.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to the<br>
identification of novel products which inhibit said<br>
protein kinases.<br>
The inhibition and regulation of protein kinases<br>
notably represent a powerful new mechanism of action<br>
for the treatment of a broad number of solid tumours.<br><br>
Disorders that can be treated with the products of the<br>
present application are therefore quite particularly-<br>
solid tumours.<br>
Protein kinases<br>
The protein kinases constitute a group of enzymes that<br>
catalyse the phosphorylation of hydroxy groups of<br>
specific protein residues such as tyrosine, serine or<br>
threonine residues. Said phosphorylations can<br>
extensively modify the function of proteins; thus, the<br>
protein kinases play an important role in the<br>
regulation of a great variety of cellular processes,<br>
notably including metabolism, cellular proliferation,<br>
cell differentiation or cell survival. Among the<br>
various cellular functions in which the activity of a<br>
protein kinase is involved, certain processes represent<br>
attractive targets for treating certain diseases. As an<br>
example, we may notably mention angiogenesis and<br>
control of the cell cycle, in which the protein kinases<br>
can play an essential role. These processes are<br>
essential for the growth of solid tumours as well as<br>
for the development of other diseases.<br>
The protein kinases participate in signalling events<br>
that control the activation, growth and differentiation<br>
of cells in response either to extracellular mediators,<br>
or to changes in the environment. In general, these<br>
kinases belong to two groups: those which phosphorylate<br>
serine and/or threonine residues preferentially, and<br>
those which phosphorylate tyrosine residues<br>
preferentially [S.K. Hanks and T. Hunter, FASEB. J.,<br>
1995, 9, pages 576-596]. The serine/threonine kinases,<br>
for example, are isoforms of protein kinases C [A.C.<br>
Newton, J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270, pages 28495-28498]and a group of cyclin-dependent kinases, such as Cdc2<br><br>
(Cdk1) [J. Pines, Trends in Biochemical Sciences, 1995,<br>
18, pages 195-197]. The tyrosine kinases include growth<br>
factor receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor<br>
(EGF) receptor [S. Iwashita and M. Kobayashi, Cellular<br>
Signalling, 1992, 4, pages 123-132], and cytosolic<br>
kinases such as p56tck, p59fYn, ZAP-70 and the csk<br>
kinases [C. Chan et al. , Ann. Rev. Immunol., 1994, 12,<br>
pages 555-592].<br>
Abnormally high levels of protein kinase activity have<br>
been associated with many diseases, resulting in<br>
abnormal cellular functions. This can occur either<br>
directly or indirectly, from a malfunction in the<br>
control mechanisms of kinase activity, connected for<br>
example with a mutation, overexpression or<br>
inappropriate activation of the enzyme, or with<br>
overproduction or underproduction of cytokines or of<br>
growth factors, which are also involved in signal<br>
transduction upstream or downstream of the kinases. In<br>
all these cases, selective inhibition of the action of<br>
the kinases offers hope of a beneficial effect.<br>
Among these protein kinases, we may mention quite<br>
particularly protein kinase Cdc7.<br>
Cdc7 is a serine/threonine kinase that has been<br>
characterized at the molecular level as a factor that<br>
is essential for initiating DNA replication.<br>
The catalytic activity of Cdc7, which is conserved<br>
throughout the eukaryotes, is dependent on its Dbf4<br>
regulatory subunit. Although the expression of Cdc7 (at<br>
the level of messenger and protein RNA) is constant<br>
throughout the cell cycle, the level of expression of<br>
Dbf4 is in contrast dependent on the cell cycle, which<br>
induces an increase in Cdc7 kinase activity during the<br><br>
G1-S transition. For this reason, Cdc7 is given the<br>
designation DDK (Dbf4-dependent kinase).<br>
The principal activity of the Cdc7/Dbf4 complex occurs<br>
on initiation of DNA replication during the S phase. It<br>
phosphorylates MCM2 which thus activates the MCM (Mini-<br>
Chromosome Maintenance) complex, which is an essential<br>
component of DNA-helicase activity.<br>
Cdc7 also plays an important role in mutagenesis,<br>
mainly induced by action at the level of the DNA-damage<br>
pathways and checkpoints, in particular at the ATR-<br>
dependent checkpoint, which prevents the initiation of<br>
DNA replication in response to damage of the single-<br>
stranded type caused by chemical agents such as<br>
etoposide.<br>
Cdc7 and Dbf4 are overexpressed in human tumour cell<br>
lines and in many tumour samples (lung, breast,<br>
thyroid, colon-rectum, oesophagus, uterus, testicle,<br>
liver (Hess et al., 1998 and internal data)) in<br>
comparison with the corresponding normal tissues.<br>
Experiments in suppressing Cdc7 expression using RNA<br>
interference (RNAi) technology show that inhibition of<br>
Cdc7 expression induces arrest of the cell cycle and<br>
prevents cellular proliferation of the human tumour<br>
cell lines HeLa and HCT116, but has a limited effect on<br>
normal cells (normal human skin fibroblasts) . This is<br>
reflected in a prolonged stoppage in G1 that induces<br>
apoptosis in cells lacking p53 (&gt; 50% of tumours) but<br>
is reversible in normal cells [A. Montagnoli et al.,<br>
CANCER RESEARCH 64, 7110-7116, October 1, 2004].<br>
The inhibitors of Cdc7 kinase activity can constitute a<br>
novel category of targeted cytotoxic therapy as well as<br><br>
of inhibitors of DNA replication. Such inhibitors would<br>
inhibit replication before the replication forks are<br>
established, thus blocking replication without damaging<br>
the DNA.<br>
The present application thus relates in particular to<br>
novel inhibitors of protein kinase Cdc7 that can be<br>
used notably for the treatment of abnormal cellular<br>
proliferation and more particularly in oncology.<br>

The carboxy radical or radicals of the products of<br>

radicals can be substituted with radicals selected for<br>
example from the halogen atoms, the hydroxyl, alkoxy,<br>

It may be recalled that stereoisomerism can be defined<br>
broadly as the isomerism of compounds having the same<br>
structural formulae, but in which the various groups<br>
are arranged differently in space, such as notably in<br>
monosubstituted cyclohexanes in which the substituent<br>
can be in the axial or equatorial position, and the<br>
various possible rotational conformations of the<br>
derivatives of ethane. However, there is another type<br>
of stereoisomerism, due to the different spatial<br>
arrangements of substituents that are fixed either on<br>
double bonds, or on rings, which is often called<br>
geometric isomerism or cis-trans isomerism. The term<br>
stereoisomers is used in the present application in its<br>
broadest sense and therefore applies to all of the<br>
compounds stated above.<br>

C(S) :<br><br>
In a first stage, the (5Z)-5-[(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-<br>
b]pyridin-3-yl)methylene]-2-thioxoimidazolidin-4-ones<br>
(la) are obtained by Knoevenagel reaction between a 2-<br>
thioxoimidazolidin-4-one (III) and an aldehyde, ketone<br>
or ester of formula (II) derived from 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-<br>
b]pyridine, in the presence of a base such as<br>
piperidine in a solvent such as ethanol. The<br>
temperature of choice for carrying out this reaction is<br>
between room temperature and the reflux temperature.<br><br>
All other usual conditions for a reaction of the<br>
Knoevenagel type can be used.<br>
Table 1 gives examples of compounds (Ia) prepared<br>
according to Scheme 1:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

imidazol-4-ones (Ib) are obtained by reaction between<br>
(5Z)-5-[(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)methylene]-2-<br>
thioxoimidazolidin-4-one (1a) and a primary or<br>
secondary amine of general structure (IV) (with R7 and<br>
R8 as defined in general formula (I) for example in<br>
ethanol at a temperature varying from 120 to 170°C in a<br>

thioxoimidazolidin-4-ones (Ia) are reacted with an<br>
alkylating agent (preferably, for example, methyl<br>
iodide) in the presence of a base such as<br>
diisopropylethylamine or sodium hydroxide, to give a<br>
thioalkylated derivative (Ic) . The thioalkyl group is<br>
finally replaced in a second stage with an amine<br>
R7R8NH, to obtain the derivatives (Ib). Said<br>
replacement is carried out in a solvent such as<br>
acetonitrile or ethanol, at a temperature between room<br>
temperature and the reflux temperature, or<br>
alternatively in a sealed tube under microwave<br>
irradiation.<br>

Scheme 3: The case when X-Y equals N=C-R; 1st synthetic<br>
route:<br><br>
The (5Z)-5-[(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)methylene]-<br>
3,5-dihydro-4H-imidazolidin-4-ones (Id) are obtained by<br>
Knoevenagel reaction between an imidazolidin-4-one (V)<br>
and an aldehyde, ketone or ester of formula (II)<br>
derived from 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine, in the presence<br>
of a base such as piperidine in a solvent such as<br>
ethanol, according to Scheme 3. The temperature of<br>
choice for carrying out this reaction is between room<br>
temperature and the reflux temperature. All other usual<br>
conditions for a reaction of the Knoevenagel type, such<br>
as acidic conditions, can be used. The imidazolidin-4-<br>
ones (V) can be prepared according to J. Org. Chem.<br>
1999, 64(22), 8084.<br>
An example of preparation of a product of formula (I)<br>
according to Scheme 3 is given in the experimental<br><br>
section hereunder as Example 13 as presented in Table<br>

In a first stage, the (5Z)-5-[(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-<br>
b]pyridin-3-yl)methylene]-2-oxoimidazolidin-4-ones<br>
(VII) are obtained by Knoevenagel reaction between a 2-<br>
oxoimidazolidin-4-one (VI) and an aldehyde, ketone or<br>
ester of formula (II) derived from lH-pyrrolo [2,3-<br>
b]pyridine, in the presence of a base such as<br>
piperidine in a solvent such as ethanol, according to<br>
Scheme 4. The temperature of choice for carrying out<br>
this reaction is between room temperature and reflux.<br>
Any other usual conditions for a reaction of the<br>
Knoevenagel type, such as acidic conditions, can be<br>
used.<br><br>
In a second stage, the (5Z)-5-[(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-<br>
b]pyridin-3-yl)methylene]-2-alkoxy-3,5-dihydro-4H-<br>
imidazol-4-ones (Ie) are obtained by reaction between<br>
the (5Z)-5-[(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)methylene]-<br>
2-oxoimidazolidin-4-ones (VII) and an alkylating agent<br>
RX (VIII) in an inert solvent at a temperature varying<br>
from room temperature to reflux. Alkylating agents VIII<br>
that are known to promote O-alkylation, such as halides<br>
or salts of oxonium tetrafluoroborate are preferred.<br>
Scheme 5: The case when X-Y equals N=C-R: 2nd synthetic<br>
route<br><br>
Alternatively, the (5Z)-5-[(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-<br>
yl)methylene]-3,5-dihydro-4H-imidazolidin-4-ones (Id)<br>
are obtained from an oxazolone of formula (X) . In a<br>
first stage, the cyclo-condensation of an N-acylated<br>
amide derivative of glycine (IX) on an aldehyde, ketone<br>
or ester of formula (II) , in the presence of a base<br>
such as sodium acetate in acetic anhydride and at a<br>
temperature between room temperature and the reflux<br>
temperature, gives an oxazolone of formula (X). This<br><br>
reaction with indole derivatives has been described: J.<br>
Am. Chem. Soc. 1946, 647. In a second stage, the<br>
reaction of the oxazolone (X) with an excess of amine<br>
of formula R1NH2, or of ammonia, gives an imidazolone<br>
(Id). This reaction is carried out in a solvent such as<br>
methanol or ethanol, at a temperature between room<br>
temperature and the reflux temperature. Alternatively,<br>
this reaction can be carried out in a sealed tube under<br>
microwave irradiation, at a temperature between 80°C<br>
and 200°C.<br>
Table 5 The products of formula (I) in Table 5 can be<br>
prepared according to Scheme 3 or 5 above and are<br>
described as examples in the experimental section<br>
hereunder.<br><br><br><br>
Scheme 6: The case when X-Y equals N=C-OR<br><br><br>
The compounds of type (Ie) can be prepared by analogy<br>
with the derivatives of imidazopyridines described for<br>
example in J. Org. Chem 2001, 66(20), 6576-6584.<br>
Scheme 7: The case when X-Y equals N=C-OR<br><br>
Alternatively, the molecules of type (Ie) can be<br>
prepared by first forming the imidazolone according to<br>
a method similar to that described for example in Bull.<br>
Korean Chem. Soc. 2007, 28(6), 913-914. In a first<br>
stage, the dehydration of a urea (XIV), with for<br>
example bromine and triphenylphosphine, gives a<br>
carbodiimide of formula (XV). In a second stage,<br><br>
addition of an alcohol and cyclization gives the<br>
imidazolone of formula (XVI). Finally, condensation on<br>
an aldehyde or ketone of formula (II) gives a compound<br>
(Ie).<br>
The examples in Table 7 can be prepared according to<br>
Scheme 6 or 7.<br><br>
Table 8: the compounds in Table 8 can be prepared<br>
according to the methods described above in Schemes 1<br>

Said products obtained by the above schemes can be<br>
products of formula (I) or alternatively, to obtain<br>
products of formula (I) or for transformation to other<br>
products of formula (I) , can be submitted, if desired<br>
and if necessary, in any order, to one or more<br>
transformation reactions known by a person skilled in<br>
the art, for example the following reactions:<br>
a) a reaction of esterification or of amidation of an<br>
acid function,<br><br>
b)	if applicable, a reaction of oxidation of an<br>
alkylthio group to the corresponding sulphoxide or<br>
sulphone,<br>
c)	a reaction of reduction of the free or esterified<br>
carboxy function to an alcohol function,<br>
d)	a reaction of transformation of an alkoxy function<br>
to a hydroxyl function, or alternatively of a hydroxyl<br>
function to an alkoxy function,<br>
e)	a reaction of elimination of the protecting groups<br>
that protected reactive functions may be carrying,<br>
f)	a reaction of salification with an inorganic or<br>
organic acid or with a base to obtain the corresponding<br>
salt,<br>
g)	a reaction for resolving racemic forms to resolved<br>
products,<br>
said products of formula (I) thus obtained being in all<br>
possible isomeric forms: racemates, enantiomers and<br>
diastereoisomers.<br>
It should be noted that said reactions of<br>
transformation of substituents into others substituents<br>
can also be carried out on the starting products as<br>
well as on the intermediates as defined above before<br>
continuing the synthesis according to the reactions<br>
stated in the method described above.<br>
The methods described in the above schemes can be<br>
carried out according to the usual conditions known by<br>
a person skilled in the art and notably according to<br>
the reaction conditions described hereunder for<br>
preparation of the examples of the present application.<br><br>
Among the starting products used for preparation of the<br>
products of formula (I) according to the present<br>
invention, some are available commercially or can be<br>
prepared according to the usual methods known by a<br>
person skilled in the art.<br>
It is also possible, notably, to prepare some starting<br>
products from products that are known or are available<br>
commercially, for example by submitting them to one or<br>
more reactions known by a person skilled in the art.<br>
The experimental section hereunder gives examples of<br>
said starting products.<br>
For preparation of the products of formula (I)<br>
according to the present invention, the various<br>
reactive functions that can be carried by some<br>
compounds of the reactions defined above can, if<br>
necessary, be protected: this relates for example to<br>
free hydroxyl, acyl, carboxy radicals or alternatively<br>
amino and monoalkylamino radicals which can be<br>
protected with appropriate protecting groups.<br>
We may mention the following list, which is not<br>
exhaustive, of examples of protection of reactive<br>
functions:<br>
- hydroxyl groups can be protected for example with<br>
alkyl radicals such as tert-butyl, trimethylsilyl,<br>
tert-butyldimethylsilyl,	methoxy-methyl,<br>
tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl or acetyl,<br>
- amino groups can be protected for example with<br>
acetyl, trityl, benzyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl, BOC,<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl, phthalimido or other radicals known<br>
in peptide chemistry,<br><br>
-	acyl groups such as the formyl group can be protected<br>
for example in the form of cyclic or acyclic ketals or<br>
thioketals such as dimethyl or diethylketal or ethylene<br>
dioxyketal, or diethylthioketal or ethylenedithioketal,<br>
-	the acid functions of the products described above<br>
can, if desired, be amidated with a primary or<br>
secondary amine for example in methylene chloride in<br>
the presence, for example, of 1-ethyl-3-<br>
(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride at<br>
room temperature,<br>
-	the acid functions can be protected for example in<br>
the form of esters formed with easily cleavable esters<br>
such as benzyl or tert-butyl esters or the esters known<br>
in peptide chemistry.<br>
Notably, NH or 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine can be<br>
protected if necessary with paratoluenesulphonyl,<br>
phenylsulphonyl, acetyl, triisopropylsilyl, tert-<br>
butyldimethylsilyl or trimethylsilylethoxymethyl.<br>
Reactions a) to g) can be carried out, for example, as<br>
stated hereunder.<br>
a) The products described above can if desired undergo,<br>
on any carboxy functions present, reactions of<br>
esterification or amidation, which can be carried out<br>
according to the usual methods known by a person<br>
skilled in the art. The reactions of amidation can<br>
notably be carried out in the presence of a coupling<br>
agent such as a carbodiimide derivative. We may mention<br>
as examples N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl), N1-<br>
ethylcarbodiimide (EDCI), N,N' -diisopropyl-carbodiimide<br>
(DIC) or N,N'-dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide.<br><br>
b)	Any alkylthio groups in the products described above<br>
can, if desired, be transformed into the corresponding<br>
sulphoxide or sulphone functions in the usual<br>
conditions known by a person skilled in the art, for<br>
example with peracids such as peracetic acid or<br>
metachloroperbenzoic acid or alternatively with ozone,<br>
oxone, sodium periodate in a solvent such as methylene<br>
chloride or dioxan at room temperature.<br>
Production of the sulphoxide function can be promoted<br>
with an equimolar mixture of the product containing an<br>
alkylthio group and of the reagent such as notably a<br>
peracid.<br>
Production of the sulphone function can be promoted<br>
with a mixture of the product containing an alkylthio<br>
group with an excess of the reagent such as notably a<br>
peracid.<br>
c)	Any free or esterified carboxy functions in the<br>
products described above can, if desired, be reduced to<br>
an alcohol function by the methods known to a person<br>
skilled in the art: any esterified carboxy functions<br>
can, if desired, be reduced to an alcohol function by<br>
the methods known by a person skilled in the art and<br>
notably with lithium and aluminium hydride in a solvent<br>
such as tetrahydrofuran or alternatively dioxan or<br>
ethyl ether.<br>
Any free carboxy functions in the products described<br>
above can, if desired, be reduced to an alcohol<br>
function notably with boron hydride.<br>
d)	Any alkoxy functions such as notably methoxy in the<br>
products described above can, if desired, be<br>
transformed to hydroxyl functions in the usual<br><br>
conditions known by a person skilled in the art, for<br>
example with boron tribromide in a solvent such as<br>
methylene chloride, with pyridine hydrobromide or<br>
hydrochloride or alternatively with hydrobromic or<br>
hydrochloric acid in water or trifluoroacetic acid<br>
under reflux.<br>
It is to be understood that the reactions described<br>
above can be carried out as stated or alternatively, if<br>
applicable, according to other usual methods known by a<br>
person skilled in the art.<br>
e)	The elimination of protecting groups, for example<br>
those stated above, can be carried out in the usual<br>
conditions known to a person skilled in the art,<br>
notably by acid hydrolysis carried out with an acid<br>
such as hydrochloric, benzenesulphonic or para-<br>
toluenesulphonic, formic or trifluoroacetic acid or<br>
alternatively by catalytic hydrogenation.<br>
The phthalimido group can be eliminated with hydrazine.<br>
A list of various protecting groups that can be used is<br>
given for example in patent BF 2 499 995.<br>
f)	The products described above can, if desired,<br>
undergo reactions of salification for example by an<br>
inorganic or organic acid or by an inorganic or organic<br>
base according to the usual methods known by a person<br>
skilled in the art: said reaction of salification can<br>
be performed for example in the presence of<br>
hydrochloric acid or alternatively tartaric, citric or<br>
methanesulphonic acid, in an alcohol such as ethanol or<br>
methanol.<br>
g)	Any optically active forms of the products described<br>
above can be prepared by resolution of racemates<br><br>
according to the usual methods known by a person<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
The products of formula (I) as defined above as well as<br>
their salts of addition with acids display interesting<br>
pharmacological properties notably on account of their<br>
kinase inhibiting properties as mentioned above.<br>
It should be noted that as certain protein kinases play<br>
a key role in the initiation, development and<br>
completion of the events of the cell cycle, molecules<br>
that inhibit said kinases are likely to limit<br>
undesirable cellular proliferation such as that<br>
observed in cancers, and can be used in the prevention,<br>
control or treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such<br>
as Alzheimer's disease or neuronal apoptosis.<br>
The products of the present invention can notably be<br>
used for the treatment of tumours.<br>
The products of the invention can thus also enhance the<br>
therapeutic effects of antitumour agents currently<br>
used.<br>
The products of formula (I) of the present invention<br>
therefore possess quite particularly antiproliferative<br>
properties.<br>
These properties justify their application in therapeu-<br>
tics and the invention relates in particular to the<br>
products of formula (I) as defined above as medicinal<br>
products, said products of formula (I) being in all<br>
possible isomeric forms: racemates, enantiomers and<br>
diastereoisomers, as well as salts of addition of said<br>
products of formula (I) with pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable inorganic and organic acids or inorganic and<br>
organic bases.<br><br>

returning to a temperature close to 25°C, add water and<br>
ice. There is formation of a precipitate in the form of<br><br>
gum. Take up the latter in two times 2 0 cm3 of ethyl<br>
acetate. Combine the organic phases, wash with water,<br>
dry over magnesium sulphate, filter and concentrate to<br>
dryness at reduced pressure. Take up the residue in<br>
5 cm3 of ethyl acetate. The precipitate obtained is<br>
filtered and dried at reduced pressure. 82 mg of 4-<br>
chloro-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine-3-carbaldehyde is<br>
obtained. The filtrate is concentrated to dryness at<br>
