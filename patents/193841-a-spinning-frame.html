The invention relates to a spinning frame.<br>
From the literature about electrical drives of textile machines, in particular for drawing, devices are known with which the movement of mechanically independent drives can be co-ordinated. At these respective drives measurements are performed and compared with limit values i.e. actual values, whereby a regulator can initiate an adjustment of rotation or whereby a control unit can initiate a switching action. As an example from said literature the European patent EP-Al-0 340 756 is mentioned, which relates to a regulating drawing system.<br>
In the development of textile frames the trend in recent times is to suggest simple and low cost concepts by which maintenance-free and robust textile frames can be built which can also be operated by less trained personnel, for example in third world countries. It is the task of the present invention to create a method and a device which satisfy these requirements.<br>
The task as object of the invention is solved by a method with the characteristics according to the independent claim 1 and a device according to the characteristics of the independent claim. The depending claims further relate to preferred improvements of the method i.e. the device.<br>
The invention is characterized in that the aimed at goal is achieved with only a few and simple electronic components.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a spinning-frame comprising at least a draw-system with an electric drive and an electric drive for driving spindles of a spinning-frame as well as a control-unit having at least a counting module for counting, registering and comparing the amount of rotation of the single electric drives wherein at least one rotatable part is connected to a first motor and provided with a marking to which a feeler is arranged which through circuit line is connected to the counter and wherein the counter with at least one limit value transmitter, and impulse generator and a comparator is connected to a power source via a communication line in the control unit of the spinning frame, and wherein the power source is connected at least to the motor of a drive for the drawing system of the spinning frame.<br>
The invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawing.<br>
Figure taking a ring spinning frame as an example, whose most important<br>
groups of drives are shown with their control devices	—<br><br>
in said figure. Amongst other drives the spinning frame comprises a drive 3,3' each for drawing systems and a drive 8 for spindles. One motor 4, 4', 9 each, preferably an asynchronous motor, is provided with power from a frequency converter 32 via an internal electrical power supply network 34. The converter 32 is connected to the normal mains 33. The frequency converter 32 is connected to a control unit 2 by means of a communication line 30, said control unit is divided into different modules, for instance a counting module 18,19 or an operating module 25. At various points of the drives feelers are attached, which register the rotation movement of the drives, for instance a feeler 7 on drive 3, a feeler 1'   and a feeler 40 on drive 3' and a feeler 11 and 15 each on drive 8 for the spindle. The feelers are in particular designed as inducers on shaft parts of the drives, for instance the feeler 7 on a plate 60 that is either toothed or provided with holes said feeler being on one of the cylinders 6 of the drive for the drawing system 3 or a feeler 40 near a plate 40' which is provided with holes on the motor shaft 4'. On drive 8 near the feeler 11 a mark 10 is provided on the shaft of the drive 9 and a plate 14 near the feeler 12. Instead of a plate with holes a mark can be provided on a shaft. Between the motors 4,4' and 9 and the cylinders 6,6' i.e. the spinning shaft 13, transmission blocks 5,5' i.e. 10 are provided, which at the drives 3,3' for the drawing system comprise drive belts and change-gears and at the drive 8 comprise a drive belt. The spinning shaft 13 transmits the drive force to the spindles 17 via belt pulleys 15 and a common belt 16. The feelers 1,1',12   etc. are connected to the counting modules 18,19 via lines 70,70', 120. In the counting module 19 a counter 20 registers for instance signals from feeler 11 via line 110 and from feeler 40 via line 400. Due to the different numbers of pairs of poles the motors 4' and 9, whose synchronisation is to be monitored through the counting of the signals, can run at different revolutions, even though they are driven by frequency changer 32 with alternating current of one frequency. The differences in the number of revolutions can be balanced by a certain number of holes for instance in plate 40'<br><br>
in comparison with the marking 10 on the shaft of the motor 9, so that during normal operation of the spinning frame 1, the same number of impulses per unit should be registered by the feelers 11 and 40.<br>
Within the counting module 19 it is controlled whether the deviation of the numbers of impulses per time unit of the different drives 3' and 8 is within an acceptable limit. Thereby from a counter 20' each, in the counting module 20 the number of impulses can be recorded via the lines 100 and 400 in for example a memory unit 22 where it can be compared with limit values from a limit value transmitter 21. As soon as in one of the counters 20' in the counting module 20 an impulse number of for instance 999 is obtained, an impulse generator 23 is used to control during a defined time interval, whether, within the time interval the other counter in the counting module 20 has also obtained the given value 999. Said time interval is the fraction of the time which passes until the impulse number 999 is obtained, for instance 2 % of the total time interval. A comparator 24 can be used to compare the given limit values with the obtained impulse numbers and if the defined conditions are not obtained it can initiate an alarm or it can stop the spinning frame via the communication line 30. The values stored in the limit value transmitter 21 can for instance be entered via the operating module 25, for instance according to a method and the respective device described in the German patents 44 30 193.6. As far as there are no other explanations in this description, for the way on how to enter said values by the operatives, the method described in the above mentioned German patent is applicable. During normal operation of the spinning frame the above described comparison of synchronisation of the drive 3' and 3 is continuously and repeatedly performed, if a respective previous comparison had been concluded with a positive result.<br>
According to another method it is controlled by means of a counter at what time an impulse number of for instance 999 is<br><br>
obtained. At the same time it is controlled, what number of impulses are obtained in an other counter. The difference of the impulse numbers, being determined in comparator 24, is compared with the acceptable limit value, with the above mentioned consequences if the limit value is exceeded.<br>
In particular for monitoring the starting of a spinning frame a similar comparison process is performed. After the start of the spinning frame 1 via the operating module 25, the supply of the motors with electric power via a transmitter 32 is released through the control unit, whereafter the motors 4,4',9 are started at the same time or within a slight time shift. After the start impulse for the drives a time interval is defined by an impulse generator 23 within which, from at least one motor 4' at least one impulse for movement in the counter 2 0 of the counting module 19 has to be registered via the feeler 40. If for instance the motor 9 of the drive 8 for the spindles starts and if within the given time interval of for instance 0.6 seconds no impulse of movement is obtained by the counter 40, this means that there is a fault in the electrical installation whereafter analogous to the above described method of monitoring the synchronisation of the motors of the drawing system, drives of the frequency transmitter 32 are stopped via the communication line 30. Thus expensive faults in the production process can be prevented or reduced. In a ring spinning frame for instance the major part of the yarns remain intact i.e. without breakage after such a switch-off. Instead of a frequency transmitter 32 also an other source of power can be applied. The operating objects, such as the limit value transmitter 21, the impulse generator 23, comparator 24 etc. of the counting module 19 can be composed of a computing unit.<br><br><br>
