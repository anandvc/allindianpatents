				<td>AN APPARATUS FOR DECODING A VIDEO BITSTREAM ACCORDING TO THE MPEG STANDARD<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for decocing a video bitstream, and more particularly, to an apparatus for decoding an MPEG (moving pictures experts group) video bitstream which can perform a decoding operation for a video bitstream on a real-time basis in a system such as a high-definition TV (HDTV) requiring a high-speed processing by decoding a macroblock according to the MPEG standard via a plurality of paths.<br>
A system such as a HDTV requiring a highspeed, processing operation, requires system clock of at least 100MHz in order to decode an input bitstream when considering picture size and header information. Also, system clock of 110-120MHz is required considering an interlace between the whole components in a decoder.<br>
However, when a decoder is implemented by using developed components, it is difficult to expect a stable decoding as well as to perform a decoding operation at desired speed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings,<br>
Referring to FIG. 1 illustrating an embodiment of the present invention, a video buffering verifier (VBV) buffer 110 receives a video bitstream according to the MPEG-2 standard. Since the VBV buffer 110 is well known to a person skilled in the art as it follows the MPEG-2 standard, the detailed description will be omitted. A variable length decoder 120 performs a variable length decoding operation with respect :o the video bitstream output from the VBV buffer 110. The variable length decoder 120 supplies symbols obtained by the variable length decoding to a data distributor 130. The variable length decoder 120 supplies header data obtained from the input video bitstream to a header analyzer 170. The variable length decoder 120 also supplies part of the header data obtained from the video bitstream to the data distributor 130. The data distributor<br>
130 distributes the symbols supplied from the variable length decoder 120 in units of a block to a first restorer 140 and a second restorer 150 constituting a first restoring path and a second restoring path, respectively, on the basis of the applied header data. The header analyzer 170 analyzes the header data supplied from the variable length decoder 120 and outputs various parameters necessary for data restoration of the FIG. 1 apparatus. Both the first and second restorers 140 and 150 restore the symbols supplied from the data distributor 130 according to the parameters output from the header analyzer 170, and output the restored data to i macroblock formation unit 160. The macroblock formation unit 160 reconstructs the blocks of the received data into a macroblock.<br>
The detailed structure and operation of the FIG. 1 apparatus in connection with signal lines and components which are shown in FIG. 1 will be described in more detail with reference to FIGs. 2 through 7.<br>
. FIG. 2 is a detailed block diagram of the data distributor 130 of FIG. 1. The data distributor 130 includes a demultiplexer 131 which receives the symbols and header data supplied from the variable length decoder 120. The demultiplexer 131 receives a coded block pattern (CBP) signal, an end of block (EOB) signal, the symbols and a write control (W_CTI), which are output from the varaible length decoder 120. The CBP ai.d the EOB follows the MPEG standard, which .is header data contained n the video bitstream received in the FIG. 1 apparatus. The CBP signal is header data which is transmitted only in the encoded inter-macroblock, end indicates which block is encoded among the respective inter-macroblocks, The write control signal W_CTL is generated in the variable length decoder 120, and<br>
is a signal indicating a write point in time with respect to the output data. The demultiplexer 131 uses the CBP signal, the EOB signal and the write control signal in order to separate blocks composed of the injiut symbols. In more detail, the demultiplexer 131 identifies blocks of :he encoded symbols according to the CBP signal the EOB signal. In particular, the demultiplexer 131 distributes the identified blocks to first and second first-in-first-out (FIFO) memories 132 and 133, based on the structure of the macroblock shown in FIG. 3. FIG. 3 is a view for explaining a macroblock which is involved with a 4:2:0 format of a picture. The macroblock is composed of six blocks, in which one macroblock is encoded<br>
in sequence  with Yl,  Y2,  Y3,  Y4, Cu  and Cv.     Here Yl-Y4 represent<br>
luminance blocks and Cu and Cv represent chrominance blocks.    Therefore,<br>
the demultiplexer 131 supplies the blocks Yl, Y3 and Cu of FIG. 3 to the first FIFO memory 132, and supplies the blocks Y2, Y4 anc Cv to the second FIFO memory 133. The demultiplexer 131 generates a first write enable signal W_ENABLE1 according to the write control signs 1 when data is supplied to the first FIFO memory 132, and generates a .second write enable signal W_ENABLE2 according to the write control signs 1 when data is supplied to the second FIFO memory 133. The demultiple: cer 131 also uses the above-described encoded block pattern (CBP) in order to prevent the symbols from being wrongly distributed by the block v hich is not encoded in the inter-macroblock,<br>
The first FIFO memory 132 stores the symbols applied together with the first write enable signal W ENNABLE1 from the demultiplexer 131, and the second FIFO memory 133 stores the symbols applied togetier with the<br>
second write enable signal WJENABLE2 from the demultiplexer 131.    The<br>
first  and   second   FIFO   memories   132   and   133   output   fullness   signals<br>
/^*-\ FIFO_FULL1 and FIFO FULL2 indicating data fullness to sat OR) gate 134,<br>
if the individually stored data exceeds a predetermined amount of the data. The OR gate 134 logically sums the first and second full less signals FIFO_FULL1 and  FIFO FULL2, and outputs the resultant fulness signal FIFO_FULL to the variable length decoder 120. The variable leigth decoder 120 judges data fullness of the first and second FIFO memojies 132 and 133, based on the fullness signal F FIFO FULL, and accordingly controls the amount of the data to be supplied to the demultiplexer 120. That is, if the fullness signal FIFO.FULL indicates that the first or second FFO memory 132 or 133 is full of a predetermined amount of data or more, the variable length decoder 120 interrupts the data output' to the data distributor 130. Meanwhile, if the fullness signal FIFO_FULL indicates that the first or second FIFO memory 132 or 133 is not full of a predetermine! amount of data or more, the variable length decoder 120 performs the da;a supply to the data distributor 130.<br>
Also, the first FIFO memory 132 outputs the stored data to the first restorer 140 if a first read enable signal R ENABLE1 is applied from a first run level decoder 141. The second FIFO memory 133 outputs the stored data to the second restorer 150 if a second read enable signal R ENABLE2 is applied from a second run level decoder 142.<br>
The header analyzer 170 shown in FIG. 4 includes a header FIFO memory 171 and a header, decoder 172. The header FIFO nemory 171 stores the header data transmitted from the variable length decoder 120<br>
together with the write control signal W_CTL, and outputs the stored data according to the read enable signal R ENABLE. The header decoder 172 decodes the data output from the header FIFO memory 171 and generates a plurality of parameters including an encoding indication signal and a scan type select signal ALT_SCAN. Here, the encoding indication signal PAT_CODE is needed for decoding the symbols in units of a block, and indicates whether each block within each macroblock has boen encoded. The scan type select signal ALT.SCAN is a signal for designating a zigzag scan or an alternate scan with respect to each block.<br>
The header decoder 172 generates a read enable signal R. ENABLE at the time when a macroblock decoding start signal MB_START shown in FIG. 7 is generated, starts reading of the header data of a corresponding macroblock MB(m+l), and interrupts generation of the read enable signal RJ5NABLE if the header data has been completely read. The header decoder 172 generates again a read enable signal R ENABLE at the time when a next macroblock decoding start signal MBJ5TART is generated, and reads the header data of the corresponding macroblock ME(m+2). The header decoder 172 decodes the header data read from the J leader FIFO memory 171. Particularly, the header decoder 172 decodes the header data of the macroblock which goes at least earlier than the -iata of the macroblock which is restored by the first and second restorers L40 and 150. The header decoder 172 supplies the encoding indication signal PAT..CODE<br>
obtained by the decoding to the first and second restorers :.40 and 150 whenever the macroblock decoding start signal MB_START is applied from the first run level decoder 141 to be described later. Therefore, the<br>
macroblock to be restored by the first and second restorers 140 and 150<br>
becomes   a  macroblock  which   goes  just  previously   in   advaice/of  the<br>
macroblock    corresponding    to    the    macroblock    decoding    s:art    signal MB_START.<br>
FIG. 5 is a detailed block diagram of first and second run level decoders 141 and 151 of FIG. 1. If the encoding indication signal PAT_CODE output from the header analyzer 172 indicates that a block is an encoded block, the first and second run level decoders 141 and 151 perform run level decoding with respect to the block. The encoding indication signal PAT_CODE indicates which one of an intra-mz croblock, an inter-macroblock, a skipped macroblock and a non-coded mac/oblock is a macroblock to which blocks belong, and whether the blocks belonging to each macroblock have been encoded. The encoding indication signal PAT_CODE has a bit value of "1" for an encoded block and a bit value of "0" for the non-encoded block. Such an encoding indication signal PAT_CODE is received via N bus lines from the header decoder 172, and a bus width is varied according to a data format of the macroblock. For example, the bus width becomes 6 bits in case of a 4:2:0 format, 8 bits in case of a 4:2:2 format, and 12 bits in case of a 4:4:4 format. Therefore, the first and second run level decoders 141 and 151 receive i he encoding indication signals PAT.CODEl and PAT_CODE2 via thret bus lines, respectively.<br>
The first and second run level decoders 141 and 151 gen-a-ate a block start signal, based on the data received from the first and second FIFO memories 132 and 133, respectively, and start' run level decoding with<br>
respect to each block based on the block start signal. The firs: and second run level decoders 141 and 151 start run level decoding of th( symbols of each block from the point in time of generation of the block start signal shown in FIG. 7. However, the point in time of decoding wiih respect to each block is varied according to a degree of the data storage in the first and second FIFO memories 132 and 133. As an example, whei the second FIFO memory 133 is empty, the second run level decoder 151 does not start run level decoding in response to the block start signal and awiits until the second FIFO memory 133 is filled with the symbols of one to then start run level decoding. Thus, the first and second run level decoders 141 and 151 complete the run level decoding at different poiits in time. Accordingly, the first and second run level decoders 141 and 151 generate block encoding end signals BLOCK_END1 and BLOCK.END2 irdicating that run level decoding is completed with respect to the block the input symbols, and give and take the generated block decoding end signals to and from each other, respectively. As can be seen from FIG. 7, the first and<br>
second   run   level   decoders   141   and   151   make   the   points   in   time   of<br>
generation of the block start signals coincident with each" o'her/   As a<br>
result,   a  valid  data  intervals   with  respect  to  the   output  of  the   scan<br>
converter  become  coincident  with  each  other.     As   an  exajnple  of  the<br>
different run level decoding end points in time, FIG. 7 shows the different points in time of generation of the block decoding end /signals BLOCK_END1 and BLOCK END2 in connection with the run level decoding. The first and second run level decoders 141 and 151 compare tie generated block decoding end signal with the received block decoding em. signal, and<br>
generates a block start signal for the next block based on the block decoding end signal at the point in time which is relatively late\ The first run level decoder 141 generates a macroblock decoding start signal MB_START to be supplied to the header analyzer 170, based on the point<br>
in time of generation of the final block start signal with respect to each macroblock.<br>
Meanwhile, the operation of the first run level decoder 141 will be<br>
described with respect to the run level decoding. The first run level decoder 141 generates a first data valid signal VALID_DATA1 of a high-level state during the time when the run level decoded data is output, and down-counts the run data of each symbol. The first run level decoder 141 outputs the count value COEF_CNT1 during the time when down-counting is performed, and outputs level data correspondin 3 to the run data of which the down-count is completed, to the first scan converter 142. The first run level decoder 141 also generates a first read enable signal R ENABLE1 whenever down-count with respect to each un data is completed, and the first FIFO memory 132 responding to the generated first read enable signal R_ENABLE1 supplies the next symbol data to the first run level decoder 141. Such an operation in connection with the run level<br>
decoding is performed in the same manner even in the secor.d rum level<br>
decoder 151.   The resultant second data valid signal VALID DATA2,count<br>
value COEF_CNT1 and level data are output to the second scan converter 152. The second read enable signal R ENABLE2 is transrritted to the second FIFO memory 133.<br>
FIG. 6 is a detailed block diagram of a first scan converte r 142 which<br>
receives the outputs of the first run level decoder 141. Since the first and second scan converters 142 and 152 have the same constitution as that of FIG. 6, respectively, the detailed description of only the first scm converter 142 will follow.<br>
.In FIG. 6, an alternate scan address generator 81 and a zigzag scan<br>
address generator 82 receive the scan type select signal ALT SCAN of the header decoder 172 of FIG. 4, and are active according to the value of the scan type select signal ALT.SCAN. If the first data /alid signal VALID_DATA1 is applied to the alternate scan address geneiator 81, the zigzag scan address generator 82 and an enable signal generator 84, the alternate scan address generator 81 or the zigzag scan address generator 82 generate scan addresses during the time when the first data valid signal VALDD_DATA1 is applied. As an example, if the value of tie scan type select signal ALT SCAN is "1," the zigzag scan address jrenerator 82 generates scan addresses, and if the value thereof is "0," the alternate scan address generator 81 generates scan addresses. The enable sigral generator 84 generates a write enable signal W ENABLE and supplies the same to a memory bank 86. The block start signal is applied to a raster scan address generator 83 and a select signal generator 87. The select sigral generator 87 generates a memory change signal CHANGE based on the received block start signal. A first memory 86a or a second memory 86b in the memory bank 86 stores the data or outputs the stored data according to the value of the memory change signal CHANGE, in which when the first memory 86a stores the input data, the second memory 86b outputs the stored data. Also, if the value of the memory change signal CHANGE is changed, the<br>
operation is reversed. The first and second memories 86a and 86b are designed to have capacities of storing one block of the run level decoded data.<br>
The alternate scan address generator 81 or the zigzag scan address generator 82 generates a memory write address for one block size, that is, the size of 8x8 pixels according to the scan type select signal ALT_SCAN and the count value COEF_CNT1. The first or second memory 86a or 86b is selected to perform a write operation according to the memory change signal of the select signal generator 87, and stores the level data supplied from the first run level decoder 141 according to the memory write address applied from the address generator 81 or 82. Finally, the first or second 86a or 86b stores "0" at the storage location corresponding to the count value COEF_CNT1, and stores the level data at the next storage location.<br>
The raster scan address generator 83 increases an internal counter from 0 to 63 in response to the block start signal, to generate a read address, and repeats an up-counting operation and a read address generation operation starting from 0 if the count value reaches 63. The first or second memory 86a or 86b which receives the read address outputs the stored data to a first inverse quantizer 143.<br>
The first inverse quantizer 143 and a first inverse discrete cosine transformer (IDCT) 144 perform inverse quantization and inverse discrete cosine transformation in turn with respect to the output of the first scan converter 142, and output the resultant data to the macroblock formation unit 160. A second inverse quantizer 153 and a second inverse discrete cosine transformer (IDCT) 154 perform inverse quanti2ation and inverse<br>
operation is reversed. The first and second memories 86a and 86b arc designed to have capacities of storing one block of the run level decoded data.<br>
The alternate scan address generator 81 or the zigzag scan address generator 82 generates a memory write. address for one block size, that is, the size of 8x8 pixels according to the scan type select signal ALT_SCAN and the count value COEF_CNT1. The first or second memory 86'a or 86b is selected to perform a write operation according to the memory change signal of the select signal generator 87, and stores the level data supplied from the first run level decoder 141 according to the memory write address applied from the address generator 81 or 82. Finally, the first or second 86a or 86b stores "0" at the storage, location corresponding to the count value COEF_CNT1. and stores the level data at the next storage location.<br>
The raster scan address generator 83 increases an internal counter from 0 to 63 in response to the block start signal, to generate a read address, and repeats an up-counting operation and a read address generation operation starting from 0 if the count value reaches 63. The first or second memory 86a or 86b which receives the read address outputs the stored data to a first inverse quantizer 143.<br>
The first inverse quantizer 143 .and a first inverse discrete cosine transformer (IDCT) 144 perform inverse quantization and inverse discrete cosine transformation in turn with respect to the output of the first scan converter 142, and output the resultant data to the macroblock formation unit 160. A second inverse quantizer 153 and a second inverse discrete cosine transformer (IDCT) 154 perform inverse quantization and inverse<br>
discrete cosine transformation in turn with respect to the output of the second scan converter 152, and output the resultant data to tht macroblock formation unit 160. Since the operations of the inverse quantisers 143 and 153 and the IDCTs 144 and 154 are well known to one having an ordinary skill in the art, the detailed description thereof will , be orritted. The macroblock formation unit 160 of FIG. 1 reconstructs the data supplied from the first and second IDCT units 144 and 154 into a prior-to-b' ;ing-encoded video macroblock.<br>
As described above, the apparatus for decoding the 1/IPEG video bitstream via a plurality of paths restores the blocks cons ituting each macroblock using the header data contained in the video bitstream via a  respectively different restoring path, and reconstructs the restored data into a macroblock size. A system such as a HDTV requiring. high-speed processing can process data on a real-time basis, and can syi.chronize the data which is separated into two paths for data restoration, based on the valid data, to thereby facilitate hardware implementation..<br>

distributor comprises;<br><br>
-	a first FIFO memory interposed between the output of said<br>
demultiplexer and the input of said first restoring means, for<br>
storing the symbols supplied from said variable length decoding<br>
means and generating a first data fullness signal<br>
-	a second FIFO memory interposed between the output of said<br>
demultiplexer and the input of said second restoring means, for<br>
storing the symbols supplied from said variable length decoding<br>
means and generating a second data fullness signal; and<br>
-	an OR gate for logically summing said first and second data<br>
fullness signals, and<br>
wherein said variable length decoding means temporarily interrupts data supply to said data distributor if the logically summed result of<br>
said OR gate indicates that one of said first and second FIFO memories is full of the data.<br>
4.	The decoding apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein said first<br>
restoring means decodes the symbols stored in said first FFO<br>
memory based on an encoding indication signal and said second<br>
restoring means decodes the symbols stored in said second FIFO<br>
memory based on the encoding indication signal, and one of said first<br>
and second restoring means generates a macroblock decoding start<br>
signal for the next macroblock decoding start signal for the next<br>
macroblock based on a point in time of completion of the run level<br>
decoding with respect to the final block in each macroblock.<br>
5.	The decoding apparatus as claimed in claim 4, wherein said each<br>
restoring means comprises;<br><br>
-	a run level decoder for down-counting run data constituting the<br>
symbol, outputting corresponding level data whenever the down-<br>
count is completed, reading the next symbol from said<br>
corresponding FFO memory, and generating a block start signal<br>
indicating decoding start with respect to each block;<br>
-	a write address generator for generating a write address in<br>
response to the down-count result of said run level decoding<br>
means ;<br>
-	a read address generator for generating a read address in response<br>
to the block start signal of said run level decoding means; and<br>
-	a memory for recording the level data output from said run level<br>
decoding means according to the write address of said write<br>
address generator and outputting the recorded level data<br>
according to the read address of said read address generator.<br><br>
6.	The decoding apparatus as claimed in claim 5, wherein said read<br>
address generator generates read addresses for reading the data stored<br>
in said memory by one block size in response to the block start<br>
signal, and said memory stores the data value of "0" if the down-<br>
count result indicates that the down-count is proceeding, while said<br>
memory stores the level data supplied from said run level decoding<br>
means if the down-count result indicates that the down-count has<br>
been completed.<br>
7.	The decoding apparatus as claimed in claim 4, wherein said header<br>
analyzer comprises;<br>
-	a FIFO memory for storing the header data output from said<br>
variable length decoding means; and<br>
-	means for reading the header data of the corresponding<br>
macroblock from said FIFO memory and outputting the read<br>
header data.<br>
8. An apparatus for decoding video bitstream according to the MPEG standard substantially as herein described with reference to and as illustrated by the accompanying drawings.<br></td>
