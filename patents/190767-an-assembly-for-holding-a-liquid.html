				<td>The present invention relates to an assembly for holding a liquid. The present invention also relates to a container for filling with liquids without gas bubbles. The invention relates in particular to a closure cap by means of which containers can be filled with liquids without gas bubbles.<br>
For numerous applications it is necessary to transfer liquids into containers in such a way that no residual air or gas is included.  Such a requirement applies, for example, to containers for pharmaceutical solutions which are used in certain inhalers which meter liquids by means of a measuring chamber (cf. for example WO 91/14468, see Fig. 1).  Since the liquid to be metered in this case frequently contains highly effective pharmaceutical substances which have to be accurately metered, the range of fluctuations in the dosage administered must be as small as possible; otherwise, the patient will not receive the quantity of active substance prescribed by the doctor.  In view of the tiny amount of liquid administered per dose, even relatively small bubbles lead to high percentage deviations in the above-mentioned inhalers.<br>
The invention now relates to a container and more particularly to a closure cap and a process for filling containers without gas bubbles.  The closure cap is constructed so that, when placed on the neck of the container, it displaces some of the contents of the container and at the same time allows any gas enclosed therein to escape and engages in the closure position. The closure may contain means for guiding a cannula for removing liquid from the container.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 shows an axial section through the centre of a closure cap of this kind.<br>
Fig. 2 shows, again in axial section, the neck of a container with the closure cap according to the invention fitted thereon in the closure position, the vents being arranged differently.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the embodiment according to the invention, wherein the vents (at least one) are provided in the form of recesses on the upper part of the container.<br>
Fig. 3a shows an enlarged view of the embodiment according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the container according to the invention with the closure cap fitted thereon.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a closure cap according to the invention with guide means for the cannula for removing the liquid.<br>
In Fig. 1, the flexible closure cap (1) has a device (2) - in this case in the form of a dipping nozzle - through which some of the contents of the container (3) are displaced during the closure process.  An inner encircling bead (4) (crimped edge) on the lower rim of the closure cap (1) engages in the closure position below a cylindrical ring (5) running around the outside of the neck of the container.  Whilst the closure cap (1) is being pushed on, the rim of the closure cap expands and the bead (4) abuts on the ring (5) to form a seal, so that the only communication between the interior (7) of the cap and the exterior is through one or more vents (6).  In the closure position the gap between the flat part of the closure cap (1) and the upper edge of the neck of the container, which may<br>
optionally be provided with an encircling rib (8) to improve the seal, is filled by a sealing ring (9) and in this way the interior of the container (3) is reliably sealed off from the interior (7) of the cap, which surrounds the sealing ring (9) and the neck of the container (3).  The internal diameter of the sealing ring (9) is preferably selected so that it fits tightly against the device (2).  The vent or vents (6) may also be located at other points on the exterior of the cap, possibly on the side, in the cylindrical part of the cap.<br>
Fig. 2 shows-the neck of the container with the closure cap (1) fitted thereon in the closure position. However, in this case, venting is achieved by the fact that vents (6) in the form of recesses are provided in the encircling bead (4) of the closure cap (1). Alternatively, recesses in the ring (5) may also serve as venting means (see Fig. 3).  The dipping nozzle (2) is sealed off by a membrane (10) at the lower end.  In order to remove liquid, the membrane is pierced with a cannula.<br>
Figure 3 shows, again in axial section, the neck of a container with the closure cap fitted thereon during the closing process.  As shown in Fig. 3, there is at least one vent (6) in the ring (5) of the container. Preferably, the vents are arranged in the form of recesses in the ring (5).  Alternatively, the vents may be provided in the form of bores.  The vents (6) are arranged in such a way that the air can escape from the interior (7) of the cap during the closure process through the vents (6), but after the container has been sealed there is no longer any communication between the liquid inside the container and the vents.<br>
Fig. 4 shows, in axial section, a container according to<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides for an assembly for holding a liquid, said assembly comprising:<br>
(a)	a container (3) having a neck defining a passage through which liquid may be introduced into the side of the container;<br>
(b)	a cap (1) for sealing the container, said cap comprising:<br>
a dipping nozzle (2) which displaces part of the contents of the container when the cap is pushed onto the neck of the container, said dipping nozzle having an interior which forms a guide (12) that runs along an axis of said nozzle said guide having a first end that is open and a second, closed, end that is terminated with a membrane (10) that is adopted to be pierced by a cannula which has been inserted into said guide, and<br>
one or more vents (6) for establishing communication between the inside and the outside of the container, as the container is closed with the cap, to thereby allow gas and/or liquid displaced by the dipping nozzle (2) to escape from the interior of the container.<br>
the invention with a closure cap fitted thereon, the vent or vents being provided in the outer part of the ring (5).  The vents may be provided in the form of recesses.  The device (11) serves to secure the reformable inner bag (3b) to the inner wall of the fixed external container (3a) facing the bag (3b).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the container (3) consists of a dimensionally stable outer container and a readily deformable inner bag (3b) which collapses onto itself as the liquid is removed.  In these embodiments, any residual air bubbles would be particularly detrimental. Such containers are described, for example, in European Patent 532873, the contents of which are hereby referred to.<br>
Figure 5a shows a preferred embodiment of the closure cap according to the invention, in which the interior of the dipping nozzle is constructed so as to form a guide for a cannula for the removal of liquid.  In the present instance the vents (6) are provided on the upper part of the container (3).  As already described, the vents may alternatively be provided on the closure cap.<br>
Figures 5b and 5c show other embodiments with regard to the construction of the dipping nozzle (2) and the guide (12) for the cannula for removing liquid.  The guide (12) may include an O-ring seal (13) as shown in Fig. 5c.<br>
The drawings show a sealing ring (9) and an encircling rib (8).  In an alternative embodiment the encircling rib (8) may be omitted if all the parts are manufactured with high precision to fit exactly.<br>
In order to remove liquid from the container (3) the membrane (10) is pierced with a cannula.  The preferred<br>
embodiments are those wherein the container (3) has a readily deformable inner bag (3b) and the tip of the cannula is located half way up the container when the liquid is removed.  In this case, air bubbles are least problematic.<br>
The container and closure cap (1) are generally made of plastics material.  Since the liquid transferred into the container is not compressible in practice, the system comprising the container and closure cap must be sufficiently deformable to allow expansion of the liquid in heat.  Similarly, when the liquid is removed the walls of the- container must be capable of yielding sufficiently or collapsing.  Suitable plastics, consisting of polyethylene or polypropylene, for example, are available to those skilled in the art for the manufacture of these containers and for the closure cap (1) .<br><br><br><br><br><br>
