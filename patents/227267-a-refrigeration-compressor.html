				<td>COMPRESSOR VALVE PLATE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates generally to refrigeration<br>
compressors. More particularly, the present invention relates to a reciprocating<br>
piston type refrigeration compressor which incorporates a unique design for the<br>
valve plate assembly which improves the clamping characteristics of the valve<br>
plate gasket and thus improves the sealing of the valve plate gasket<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Reciprocating piston type compressors typically employ suction<br>
and discharge pressure actuated valving mounted onto a valve plate assembly<br>
which is located at the end of a cylinder formed by a compressor body. The<br>
valve plate assembly is typically sandwiched between a compressor head<br>
and the compressor body. A valve plate gasket is located between the valve<br>
plate assembly and the compressor body to seal the interface.<br>
[0003] Traditionally, the valve plate gasket is compressed due to a<br>
clamping load which is created by the attachment of the compressor head to the<br>
compressor body. The compressor head is attached to the compressor body by<br>
head bolts which extend through the compressor head, through the head gasket,<br>
through the valve plate assembly through the valve plate gasket and finally<br>
threadingly received by the compressor body. As these head bolts are tightened,<br>
compression of the valve plate gasket occurs.<br><br>
[0004] Typically, the head bolts are located around the outside<br>
perimeter of the compressor head, the valve plate assembly and the valve plate<br>
gasket. Thus, the valve plate gasket receives most of its clamping load from this<br>
outside perimeter. Because the clamping load is generated at the outside<br>
perimeter of the valve plate gasket, there is a lower clamping load and thus a<br>
lower amount of compression of the valve plate gasket in the center portion of<br>
the valve plate gasket spaced from the outside perimeter. Because of this lower<br>
amount of compression of the valve plate gasket in the center portion, most of<br>
the valve plate gasket failures occur in this center portion.<br>
[0005] In addition to compression of the valve plate gasket by the head<br>
bolts, valve plate gasket compression load is also created by the high pressure<br>
discharge gas located above the valve plate assembly. This high pressure<br>
discharge gas presses the valve plate assembly against the valve plate gasket<br>
and the compressor body. Typically the valve plate assembly is comprised of an<br>
upper valve plate, a lower valve plate and one or more spacers located between<br>
the upper and lower valve plates. In the center area of the valve plate assembly,<br>
there is no head bolt as described above and thus there is no spacer which<br>
creates an open void due to the lack of a spacer between the upper and lower<br>
valve plates. This means that the load, exerted by the high pressure discharge<br>
gas, is exerted on the upper valve plate and this exerted pressure is not<br>
transmitted directly to the lower valve plate in this center portion.<br>
[0006] The present invention provides the art with a unique valve plate<br>
assembly which improves the valve gasket clamping load in the center portion<br><br>
and thus it significantly reduces valve gasket failures. The unique valve plate<br>
assembly of the present invention includes a center spacer which is located<br>
between the upper and lower valve plates in the center portion of the valve plate<br>
assembly. By incorporating this additional center spacer, the valve plate<br>
assembly exerts an increased clamping force in this center portion to increase<br>
the compression of the valve plate gasket and thus improve its performance and<br>
durability.<br>
[0007] In the first embodiment of the present invention, the center<br>
spacer defines a bolt hole which extends through the spacer. A center bolt is<br>
assembled through the valve plate assembly using this bolt hole and it is<br>
threadingly received by the compressor body. When this center bolt is tightened,<br>
it provides additional clamping load to the valve plate gasket in the center portion<br>
to produce a more even clamping load throughout the entire valve plate gasket to<br>
improve performance and durability while reducing failures. The center bolt can<br>
extend only through the valve plate assembly and through the valve plate gasket<br>
into the compressor body or the center bolt can extend through the compressor<br>
head, through the valve plate assembly and through the valve plate gasket into<br>
the compressor body if desired.<br>
[0008] In another embodiment of the present invention, the center<br>
spacer does not include the bolt hole. The center spacer is located within the<br>
center portion of the valve plate assembly to transmit both the clamping load and<br>
the pressure exerted by the high pressure discharge gas from the upper valve<br>
plate, to the lower valve plate, to the valve plate gasket and finally to the<br><br>
compressor body. This additional load exerted onto the valve plate gasket at its<br>
center portion increases the compression of the gasket at the center portion to<br>
produce a more even clamping load throughout the entire valve plate gasket to<br>
improve performance and durability while reducing failures. This additional<br>
embodiment is useful when it is not possible to assemble a center bolt due to a<br>
compressor unloader system or other features of the compressor being located<br>
at a position which limits access to the center portion of the valve plate assembly.<br>
[0009] Further areas of applicability of the present invention will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating<br>
the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of<br>
illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0018] The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. There is shown in Figures 1-5 and compressor assembly 10<br>
which incorporates the unique valve plate assembly in accordance with the<br>
present invention. Compressor assembly 10 comprises a compressor body 12, a<br>
compressor head 14, a head gasket 16, a valve plate assembly 18 and a valve<br>
plate gasket 20.<br>
[0019] Compressor body 12 defines a pair of compression cylinders 22<br>
within which a piston 24 is slidably disposed. Each compression cylinder 22 is in<br>
communication with both a discharge chamber and a suction chamber through<br>
valve plate assembly 18.<br><br>
[0020] Valve plate assembly 18 comprises an upper valve plate 26, a<br>
lower valve plate 28, an annular spacer 30 a plurality of interior spacers 32 and a<br>
center spacer 34. Valve plate assembly 18 defines a pair of suction passages 36<br>
which are in communication with the suction chamber of compression assembly<br>
10 and a pair of discharge passages 38 which are in communication with the<br>
discharge chamber of compressor assembly 10. Each discharge passage 38 is<br>
defined by a radially inclined or beveled sidewall 40 extending between an upper<br>
surface 42 and a lower surface 44 of valve plate assembly 18. Beveled sidewall<br>
40 is formed from upper valve plate 26. A surface 46 of beveled sidewall 40<br>
provides a valve seat for a discharge valve member 48 which is urged into<br>
sealing engagement therewith by discharge gas pressure and a spring 50<br>
extending between discharge valve member 48 and a bridge-like retainer 52.<br>
[0021] As shown, discharge valve member 48 is of a size and a shape<br>
relative to discharge passage 38 so as to place a lower surface 54 thereof in<br>
substantially coplanar relationship to lower surface 44 of valve plate assembly<br>
18. Spring 50 is located in a recess 56 provided in retainer 52. Discharge valve<br>
member 48 is essentially pressure actuated and spring 50 is chosen primarily to<br>
provide stability and also to provide an initial closing bias or preload to establish<br>
an initial seal. Other types of springs, other than that illustrated may of course be<br>
used for this purpose. Retainer 52, which also serves as a stop to limit the<br>
opening movement of valve member 48 is secured to valve plate assembly 18 by<br>
a pair of suitable fasteners 58.<br><br>
[0022] Annular spacer 30 is disposed between upper valve plate 26<br>
and lower valve plate 28 and annular spacer 30 forms suction passage 36 with<br>
upper valve plate 26 and lower valve plate 28. The plurality of interior spacers 32<br>
are positioned around each compression cylinder 22 as illustrated in Figure 4.<br>
Valve plate assembly 18 is secured to compressor body 12 when compressor<br>
head 14 is secured to compressor body 12. Valve plate assembly 18 is<br>
sandwiched between compressor head 14 and compressor body 12 with valve<br>
plate gasket 20 being sandwiched between valve plate assembly 18 and<br>
compressor body 12 and head gasket 16 being sandwiched between valve plate<br>
assembly 18 and compressor head 14.<br>
[0023] A plurality of bolts 60 extend through compressor head 14, head<br>
gasket 16, upper valve plate 26 of valve plate assembly 18, annular spacer 30 of<br>
valve plate assembly 18, lower valve plate 28 of valve plate assembly 18, valve<br>
plate gasket 20 and are threadingly received by compressor body 12. The<br>
tightening of bolts 60 compresses valve plate gasket 20 to provide a sealing<br>
relationship between valve plate assembly 18 and compressor body 12 provide a<br>
sealing relationship between valve plate assembly 18 and compressor head 14.<br>
As shown in the Figures, the plurality of bolts 60 and annular spacer 30 of valve<br>
plate assembly 18 are located around the outer circumferential portion of<br>
compressor head 14 and valve plate assembly 18. In the prior art, the plurality of<br>
bolts 60 extending through compressor head 14, head gasket 16, valve plate<br>
assembly 18, valve plate gasket 20 and threadingly received by compressor<br>
body 12 were the only mechanical means for providing a compressive load to<br><br>
valve plate gasket 20. While this compressive load was sufficient for the outer<br>
circumferential portion of valve plate gasket 20 , the center portion of valve plate<br>
gasket 20 would see less of a compressive load than the outer circumferential<br>
portion due to the distance between the center portion and each of the plurality of<br>
bolts 60.<br>
[0024] The present invention improves the compressive characteristics<br>
of valve plate gasket 20 and thus its performance and durability by adding center<br>
spacer 34. Center spacer 34 is located at approximately the geometric center of<br>
valve plate assembly 18 at a position which is on a line which extends between<br>
the geometric center of one compression cylinder 22 and the geometric center of<br>
an adjacent compression cylinder 22. This places center spacer 34 generally<br>
midway between both the length and width of valve plate assembly 18. Center<br>
spacer 34 extends between upper valve plate 26 and lower valve plate 28 and is<br>
received within a bore 62 defined by lower valve plate 28. While illustrated as<br>
being received in bore 62 in lower valve plate 28, bore 62 could be located in<br>
upper valve plate 26 and center spacer 34 could be reversed from what is<br>
illustrated if desired. Center spacer 34 defines a through hole 64 which is<br>
aligned with a hole 66 extending through upper valve plate 26. A center bolt 68<br>
extends through hole 66 of upper valve plate 26, through hole 64 of center<br>
spacer 34 and is threadingly received in compressor body 12. The tightening of<br>
center bolt 68 provides additional compressive load for valve plate gasket 20 at<br>
the center of valve plate gasket 20 to increase the compression of valve plate<br>
gasket 20, to produce a more even clamping load throughout the entire valve<br><br>
plate gasket 20 and to improve both the performance and durability of its sealing<br>
function.<br>
[0025] Valve plate assembly 18 further defines an annular valve seat<br>
70 and sidewall 40 defines an annular valve seat 72 located at its terminal end.<br>
Disposed between valve seat 70 and valve seat 72 is suction passage 36.<br>
[0026]	Valve seat 72 of sidewall 40 is positioned in coplanar<br>
relationship with valve seat 70 of valve plate assembly 18. A suction reed valve<br>
member 76 in the form of an annular ring sealingly engages, in its closed<br>
position, valve seat 72 of sidewall 40 and valve seat 70 of valve plate assembly<br>
18 to prevent passage of fluid from compression cylinder 22 into suction passage<br>
36. A central opening 78 is provided in suction reed valve member 76 and is<br>
arranged coaxially with discharge passage 38 so as to allow direct fluid flow<br>
communication between compression cylinder 22 and lower surface 54 of<br>
discharge valve member 48. Suction reed valve member 76 also includes a pair<br>
of diametrically opposed radially outwardly extending tabs 80. One tab 80 is<br>
used to secure reed valve member 76 to valve plate assembly 18 using a pair of<br>
drive studs 82.<br>
[0027]	As piston 24 within compression cylinder 22 moves away<br>
from valve plate assembly 18 during a suction stroke, the pressure differential<br>
between compression cylinder 22 and suction passage 36 will cause suction<br>
reed valve member 76 to deflect inwardly with respect to compression cylinder<br>
22, to its open position (shown in dashed lines in Figure 3), thereby enabling gas<br>
flow from suction passage 36 into compression cylinder 22 between valve seats<br><br>
70 and 72. Because only tabs 80 of suction reed valve member 76 extend<br>
outwardly beyond the sidewalls of compression cylinder 22, suction fluid flow will<br>
readily flow into compression cylinder 22 around substantially the entire inner<br>
and outer peripheries of suction reed valve member 76. As a compression<br>
stroke of piston 24 begins, suction reed valve member 76 will be forced into<br>
sealing engagement with valve seat 70 and valve seat 72. Discharge valve<br>
member 48 will begin to open due to the pressure within compression cylinder 22<br>
exceeding the pressure within discharge passage 38 and the force exerted by<br>
spring 50. The compressed gas will be forced through central opening 78, past<br>
discharge valve member 48 and into discharge passage 38. The concentric<br>
arrangement of valve plate assembly 18 and reed valve member 76 allow<br>
substantially the entire available surface area overlying compression cylinder 22<br>
to be utilized for suction and discharge valving and porting, thereby allowing<br>
maximum gas flow both into and out of compression cylinder 22.<br>
[0028]	The continuous stroking of piston 24 within compression<br>
cylinder 22 continuously causes suction reed valve member 76 and discharge<br>
valve member 48 to move between their open and closed positions. Compressor<br>
body 12 includes an angled or curved portion 84 at the outer edge of<br>
compression cylinder 22 adjacent the free end of suction reed valve member 76<br>
to provide a friendly surface for suction reed valve member 76 to bend against,<br>
thereby significantly reducing the bending stresses generated within the free end<br>
tab 80.<br><br>
[0029]	Referring now to Figure 6, a compressor assembly 110 in<br>
accordance with another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The<br>
embodiment illustrated in Figure 6 is the same as the embodiment illustrated in<br>
Figure 3 except that center bolt 68 has been replaced by center bolt 168. Center<br>
bolt 68 extended through valve plate assembly 18 and valve plate gasket 20 and<br>
was threadingly received by compressor body 12. Center bolt 168 illustrated in<br>
Figure 6 extends through cylinder head 14, valve plate assembly 18 and valve<br>
plate gasket 20 and is threadingly received by compressor body 12. In order to<br>
exert the addition compressive loads, an extension 170 is added to cylinder head<br>
14 through which center bolt 168 extends. The operation, function and features<br>
of compressive assembly 110 are the same as those described above for<br>
compressor assembly 10.<br>
[0030]	Referring now to Figure 7, a valve plate assembly 118 in<br>
accordance with another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated.<br>
Valve plate assembly 118 is the same as valve plate assembly 18 except that<br>
center spacer 34 has been replaced with center spacer 134. Center spacer 134<br>
is located at the same position as center spacer 34 which is at approximately the<br>
geometric center of valve plate assembly 118. This places center spacer 134<br>
generally midway between both the length and width of valve plate assembly 118<br>
or the same position as shown for center spacer 34 in Figure 4. Center spacer<br>
134 extends between upper valve plate 26 and lower valve plate 28 and is<br>
received within a bore 162 defined by upper valve plate 26. While illustrated as<br>
being received in bore 162 in upper valve plate 26, bore 162 could be located in<br><br>
lower valve plate 28 and center spacer 134 could be reversed from what is<br>
illustrated if desired.<br>
[0031]	Because center spacer 134 is a solid member, center bolt 68<br>
or 168 are not included and thus valve plate gasket 20 does not receive<br>
additional compression at its center portion through the tightening of a center<br>
bolt. Instead, the additional compressive load applied to the center portion of<br>
valve plate gasket 20 is applied by the addition of a center rib similar to extension<br>
170 illustrated in Figure 6 and by gas pressure from compressed gas which is<br>
located in the gas discharge chamber located above valve plate assembly 118.<br>
Compressed gas at discharge pressure exerts a load on upper valve plate 26<br>
and this load is transferred directly to lower valve plate 28 through center spacer<br>
134. In addition, the tightening of bolts 60 exert a load on upper valve plate 26<br>
through the center rib (not shown) and this load is also transferred directly to<br>
lower valve plate 28 through center spacer 134. The exerted load on lower valve<br>
plate 28 is then exerted on valve plate gasket 20 to provide additional<br>
compressive load for valve plate gasket 20 at the center of valve plate gasket 20<br>
to increase the compression of valve plate gasket 20, to produce a more even<br>
clamping load throughout the entire valve plate gasket 20 and to improve both<br>
the performance and durability of its sealing function. In the prior art where<br>
center spacer 134 is not present, the pressure load exerted on upper valve plate<br>
26 is not directly transferred to lower valve plate 28.<br>
[0032]	The description of the invention is merely exemplary in<br>
nature and, thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are<br><br>
intended to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be<br>
regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
