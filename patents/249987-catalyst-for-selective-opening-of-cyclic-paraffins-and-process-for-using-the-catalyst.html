				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]       This invention relates to a catalyst for ths selective opening of cyclic paraffins which comprises a Group VETT metal component, a molecular sieve, a refractory oxide and optionally a modifier. This invention also relates to a process for selective ring opening using the catalyst.<br>
[0002]       Olefins are used in various reactions to produce important chemical compounds. Accordingly, demand for olefins is ever increasing and therefore new processes or increased efficiencies in existing processes are required. One of the main processes used in preparing light olefins is naphtha steam cracking. It is known that the efficiency of steam cracking depends on the specific composition of the naphtha feed. Specifically it has been demonstrated that converting naphthenes to acyclic paraffins, e.g. n-paraffins significantly improves olefin yield from the steam cracker. There is, therefore, a need for an improved ring opening catalyst.<br>
[0003]       Improved ring opening catalysts are also necessary because of increasing demand for environmentally friendly products and clean burning high performance fuels. In this case naphthene rings are opened to give acyclic paraffins which in turn can be isomerized. These isomerized paraffins have improved characteristics than the corresponding naphthenes.<br>
[0004]       An increased amount of paraffins is also required in providing refomrjlated gasoline. Reformulated gasoline differs from '.he traditional product in having a lower vapor pressure, lower final boiling point, increased content of oxygenates, and lower content of olefins, benzene and aromatics.<br>
[0005]       Reduction in gasoline benzene- content often has been addressed by changing the cut point between light and heavy naphtha, directing more of the potential benzene fanners co isomerization instead of to reforming. No benzene is formed in isomerization, wherein benzene is converted to Q&gt; naphthenes and Q<br>
naphthenes are isomerized toward an equilibrium mixture of cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane or converted to paraffins through ring opening. It is believed that such CG cyclics are preferentially adsorbed on catalyst sites relative to paraffins, and the cyclics thus have a significant effect on catalyst activity for isomerization of paraffins. Refiners thus face the problem of maintaining the performance of light-naphtha isomerization units which process an increased concentration of feedstock cyclics.<br>
[0006]       Catalysts which are useful for ring opening are known and include a high chloride platinum component dispersed on a refractory inorganic oxide which is described in US-A-5,463,155. US-A-5,811,624 describes a catalyst for the selective opening of 5 and 6 membered rings which consists of a transition metal catalyst selected from the group consisting of carbides, nitrides, oxycarbides, oxynitrides, and oxycarbonitrides. The transition metal is selected from the group consisting of metals from Group IVA, VA, VIA of the Periodic Table of the Elements. US-A-6, 235,962 B1 discloses a catalyst for ring opening which comprises a earner consisting of alumina, a metal modifier selected from the group consisting of scandium, yttrium and lanthanum, and at least one catalytically active metal selected from the group consisting of platinum, palladium, rhodium, rhenium, indium, ruthenium, and cobalt. US-A-5,382,730 discloses a process for ring opening and isomerization of hydrocarbons where the catalyst comprises an aluminosilicate zeolite such as Zeolite Y or Zeolite Beta and a hydrogenation component. US-A-5,345,026 discloses a process for conversion of cyclic hydrocarbons to non-cyclic paraffin hydrocarbons where the catalyst comprises a hydrogenation-dehydrogenation component and an acidic solid component comprising a group IVB metal oxide modified with an oxyanion of a group VD3 metal. US-A-3,617,511 discloses a catalyst for conversion of cyclic hydrocarbons to paraffins where the catalyst comprises rhodium or ruthenium on a halogen promoted refractory oxide. US-A-6,241,876 discloses a ring opening catalyst which comprises a large pore crystalline molecular sieve component with a faujasite structure and an alpha acidity of less than one and a Group VTJI noble metal. U.S. Publication No. 2002/43481 Al discloses a catalyst for naphthalene ring opening which comprises at least one Group VETJ metal selected from iridium,<br>
platinum, rhodium and ruthenium on a refractory inorganic oxide substrate containing at least one of an alkali metal and alkaline earth metal. Finally U.S. Publication No. 2002/40175 Al discloses a naphthene ring opening catalyst comprising a Group VD3 metal selected from indium, platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium and combinations thereof. With the metal being supported on the substrate comprising at least one of a Group IB, HE, and IVA metal.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]       One aspect of the present invention is a catalyst which is useful for opening or cleaving naphthenic rings. The catalyst of the present invention comprises a Group Vm metal component an optional modifier component, a molecular sieve and a refractory inorganic oxide. The molecular sieves which can be used in the present invention are any of those which have 8, 10 or 12 ring pores and which have weak to medium acidity. Acidity of the molecular sieves can be determined by one of several techniques. One method involves measuring the ability of the molecular sieves to crack heptane, i.e. heptane crackjng test. The cracking test involves placing a sample (250 mg) of the molecular sieve to be tested into a microreactor and drying the catalyst for 30 minutes at 200°C using flowing hydrogen. The sample is then reduced by heating for one hour at 500°C in flowing hydrogen. After cooling to 450°C a feedstream comprising hydrogen gas saturated with heptane at 0°C is flowed over the sample. Online analysis of the effluent gas is earned out using gas chromatography after holding for 20 minutes at a temperature from 450-550°C. A weakly acidic molecular sieve will have a heptane conversation of no more that 20% and preferably no more than 10%, while a moderately acidic molecular sieve will have a cracking conversion of no more than 40% and preferably no more than 30%. Another test method is ammonia temperature programmed desorption or NH3-TPD. This test basically involves contacting a molecular sieve sample with ammonia and then measuring the amount of ammonia desorbed over a temperature range of 200°C to 500°C. Details of this test procedure are provided in US-A-4,894,142 which is incorporated herein by reference. Molecular sieves with moderate acidity will desorb less than 0.4mmol of NH3/g total over the 200°C to 500°C range, while a weakly<br>
acidic molecular sieve will desorb a total of less than 0.2mmol of NH3/g over the 200°C to 500°C temperature range. Finally, acidity can be measured by pyridine infrared (DR). Specific examples of molecular sieves with weak to moderate acidity, include but are not limited to MAPSOs, SAPOs, UZM-4, UZM-4M, UZM-5, UZM-5P, UZM-5HS, UZM-6, UZM-8, UZM-8HS, UZM-15, UZM-15HS, UZM-16, UZM-16HS and mixtures thereof. MAPSO molecular sieves are disclosed in US-A-4,758,419. A preferred MAPSO is MAPSO-31. SAPO molecular sieves are disclosed in US-A-4,440,871. Preferred SAPOs are SAPO-11, SAPO-34 and SM-3 (US-A-4,943,424). UZM-4 is described in US-A-6,419,895 Bl while UZM-5, UZM-5P and UZM-6 are described in US-A-6,388,157 Bl.

[0008]      Further, all the molecular sieves identified by a UZM designation will collectively be referred to as UZM zeolites. For completeness, the following brief description of the UZM zeolites described in the patent applications above will be provided below.<br>
[0009]       All of the UZM zeolites have a microporous crystalline structure of at least A1O2 and SiOj tetrahedral units. UZM-8, UZM-15 and UZM-16 have a composition on an as-synthesized and anhydrous basis expressed by an empirical formula of:<br>
M:+RrAl,_xExSiyOz	(1).<br>
M is at least one exchangeable cation selected from the group consisting of alkali and alkaline earth metals, "m" is the mole ratio of M to (Al + E) and, "n" is the weighted average valence of M. R is defined as follows:<br>
1)	UZM-8: R is at least one organoammonium cation selected from the group<br>
consisting of quaternary ammonium cations, diquatemary ammonium cations,<br>
protonated amines, protonated diamines, protonated alkanolamines and<br>

diamines, protonated alkanolamines, diquatemaryammonium cations,<br>
quaternized alkanolamines and mixtures thereof, "r" is the mole ratio of R to<br>
(Al + E); and<br>
3)	UZM-16: R is benzyltrimethylammonium (BzTMA) cation or a combination<br>
of BzTMA and at least one organoammonium cation selected from the group<br>
consisting of quaternary ammonium cations, protonated amines, protonated<br>
diamines, protonated alkanolamines, diquatemaryammonium cations,<br>
quaternized alkanolamines and mixtures thereof, "r" is the mole ratio of R to<br>
(Al+E).<br>
[0010]       E is an element selected from the group consisting of Ga, Fe, In, Cr, B, and mixtures thereof. The other variables are defined as "p" is the weighted average valence of R; "x" is the mole fraction of E, "y1 is the mole ratio of Si to (Al + E) and "z" is the mole ratio of 0 to (Al + E). The values of "m", "n", "r", "p", "x", "y" and "z" are presented in Table A.<br>
Table A<br><br>
(Table Remove)[0011]       These zeolites are also characterized by x-ray diffraction patterns having at least the d-spacings and relative intensities set forth in Table B (UZM-8), Table C (UZM-15) and Table D (UZM-16).<br>
Table B (UZM-8)<br><br>
(Table Remove)Table C (UZM-15)<br><br>
Table D (UZM-16)<br><br>
(Table Remove) [0012]       The UZM-8, UZM-15 and UZM-16 zeolites are prepared by a hydrothermal crystallization of a reaction mixture prepared by combining reactive sources of R, aluminum, silicon and optionally M and E. The sources of aluminum include but are not limited to aluminum alkoxides, precipitated aluminas, aluminum metal, sodium aluminate, organoammonium aluminar.es, aluminum salts and alumina sols. Specific examples of aluminum alkoxides include, but are not limited to aluminum ortho sec-butoxide and aluminum ortho isopropoxide. Sources of silica include but are not limited to tetraethylorthosilicate, colloidal silica, precipitated silica, alkali silicates and organoammonium silicates. A special reagent consisting of an organoammonium aluminosilicate solution can also serve as the simultaneous source of Al, Si, and R. Sources of the E elements include but are not limited to alkali berates, boric acid, precipitated gallium oxyhydroxide, gallium sulfate, feme sulfate, ferric chloride,<br>
chromium nitrate and indium chloride. Sources of the M metals include the halide salts, nitrate salts, acetate salts, and hydroxides of the respective alkali or alkaline earth metals. R can be introduced as an organoammonium cation or an amine. When R is a quaternary ammonium cation or a quatemized alkanolammonium cation, the sources include but are not limited to the hydroxide, chloride, bromide, iodide and fluoride compounds. Specific examples include without limitation DEDMA hydroxide, ETMA hydroxide, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, tetraethylammonium hydroxide, hexamethonium bromide, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, methyltriethylammonium hydroxide, tetramethylammonium chloride, propylethyldimethylammonium hydroxide (PEDMAOH), trimethylpropylammonium hydroxide, trimethylbutylammonium hydroxide (TMBAOH), N,N,N,N',N',N-hexamethyl 1,4 butanediammonium hydroxide (DQ4), and choline chloride. The source of R may also be neutral amines, diamines, and alkanolamines that subsequently hydrolyzes to form an organoammonium cation. Specific examples are triethanolamine, triethylamine, and N,N,N',N'tetramethyl-l,6-hexanediamine. Preferred sources of R without limitation areETMAOH, DEDMAOH, and HM(OH)2.<br>
[0013]       In a special case, a reagent in the form of an aluminosilicate stock solution may be used. These solutions consist of one or more organoammonium hydroxides and sources of silicon and aluminum that are processed to form a clear homogenous solution that is generally stored and used as a reagent. The reagent contains aluminosilicate species that typically don't show up in zeolite reaction mixtures derived directly from separate sources of silicon and aluminum. The reagent is generally alkali-free or contains alkali at impurity levels from the silicon, aluminum, and organoammonium hydroxide sources. One or more of these solutions may be used in a zeolite synthesis. In the case of substitution of Al by E, the corresponding metallosilicate solution may also be employed in a synthesis.<br>
[0014]       As shown above, not all the R cations can produce all of the three UZM structures. Thus the preparation of UZM-15 requires at least one first organoammonium cation having at least one organic group with at least two carbon atoms, e.g. DEDMA, ETMA, TMBA, DQ4 and PEDMA and optionally (in addition to the first<br>
organoammonium cation) a second organoammonium compound. The preparation of UZM-16 requires benzyltrirnethylammonium (BzTMA) or a combination of BzTMA and at least one organoammonium cation as described above.<br>
[0015]       The reaction mixture containing reactive sources of the desired components can be described in terms of molar ratios of the oxides by the formula:<br>
[0016]       The values of the variables for the UZM-8, 15 and 16 are presented in Table E along with general and preferred reaction conditions. The reaction mixtures are reacted at the stated conditions in a sealed reaction vessel under autogenous pressure.<br>
Table E Reaction Mixture Compositions and Reaction Conditions for UZM Zeolites<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
 [0017]      After crystallization is complete, the solid product is isolated from the heterogeneous mixture by means such as filtration or centrifugation, and then washed with de-ionized water and dried in air at ambient temperature up to 100°C.<br>
[0018]      As-synthesized, the zeolites will contain some of the exchangeable or charge balancing cations in its pores. These exchangeable cations can be exchanged for other cations, or in the case of organic cations, they can be removed by heating under controlled conditions. Ion exchange involves contacting the zeolites with a solution<br>
containing the desired cation (at molar excess) at exchange conditions. Exchange conditions include a temperature of 15°C to 100°C and a time of 20 minutes to 50 hours. Calcination conditions include a temperature of 300°C to 600CC for a time of 2 to 24 hours.<br>
[0019]      A special treatment for removing organic cations which provides the ammonium form of the zeolite is ammonia calcination. Calcination in an ammonia atmosphere can decompose organic cations, presumably to a proton form that can be neutralized by ammonia to form the ammonium cation. The resulting ammonium form of the zeolite can be further ion-exchanged to any other desired form. Ammonia calcination conditions include treatment in the ammonia atmosphere at temperatures between 250°C and 600°C and more preferably between 250°C and 450°C for times of 10 minutes to 5 hours. Optionally, the treatments can be carried out in multiple steps within this temperature range such that the total time in the ammonia atmosphere does not exceed 5 hours. Above 500°C, the treatments should be brief, less than a half hour and more preferably on the order of 5-10 minutes. Extended calcination times above 500°C can lead to unintended dealumination along with the desired ammonium ion-exchange and are unnecessarily harsh as most organoammonium templates easily decompose at lower temperatures.<br>
[0020]       The UZM-4M, UZM-5HS, UZM-8HS, UZM-15HS and UZM-16HS zeolites are prepared from their respective parent zeolite by a number of various techniques and are represented by the empirical formula:<br>
MirAlo-oE.Si.O,.     (2).<br>
[0021]       In formula (2), E and "x" are as defined above except for UZM-4M and UZM-5HS where "x" varies from 0 to 0.5. Mi is at least one exchangeable cation selected from the group consisting of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, rare earth metals, ammonium ion, hydrogen ion and mixtures thereof, a is the mole ratio of Ml to (Al +E), n is the weighted average valence of Ml, y' is the mole ratio of Si to (Al + E) and z" is the mole ratio of O to (Al + E). The values of the variables for the zeolites are presented below in Table F.<br>
Table F<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
 [0022]       The value of y' is greater than the specific value set forth in Table F to virtually pure silica. By virtually pure silica is meant that virtually all the aluminum and/or the E metals have been removed from the framework. It is well know that it is virtually impossible to remove all the aluminum and/or E metal. Numerically, a zeolite is virtually pure silica when y' has a value of at least 3,000, preferably 10,000 and most preferably 20,000. Thus, ranges for y' are from 3, 5, 6.5 or 7 to 3,000 preferably greater than 10 to 3,000; 3, 5, 6.5 or 7 to 10,000 preferably greater than 10 to 10,000 and 3, 5, 6.5 or 1 to 20,000 preferably greater than 10 to 20,000.<br>
[0023] The zeolites UZM-4M, UZM-5HS, UZM-8HS, UZM-15HS and UZM-16HS are further characterized by an x-ray diffraction pattern having at least the d-spacings and relative intensities set forth in Tables G, H, I, J and K respectively.<br><br><br>
(Table Remove)Table I UZM-8HS<br><br>
Table J UZM-15HS<br><br>
Table K UZM-16HS<br><br>
\(Table Remove) [0024]       The UZM-4M, UZM-5HS, UZM-8HS, 15HS and 16HS are prepared by removing aluminum and optionally inserting silicon into the structure thereby increasing the Si/Al ratio and thus modifying the acidity and ion exchange properties of the zeolites. These treatments include: a) contacting with a fluorosilicate solution or slurry; b) calcining or steaming followed by acid extraction or ion-exchange; c) acid extraction or d) any combination of these treatments in any order.<br>
[0025]       Fluorosilicate treatment is known in the art and is described in US-A-6,200,463 Bl, which cites US-A-4,711,770 as describing a process for treating a zeolite with a fluorosilicate salt. Both patents are incorporated by reference in their entirety. General conditions for this treatment are contacting the zeolite with a solution containing a fluorosilicate salt such as ammonium fluorosilicate (AFS) at a temperature of 20°C to 90°C.<br>
[0026]       The acids which can be used in carrying out acid extraction include without limitation mineral acids, carboxylic acids and mixtures thereof. Examples of these include sulfuric acid, nitric acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), citric acid, oxalic acid, etc. The concentration of acid which can be used is not critical but is conveniently between 1 wt-% to 80 wt-% acid and preferably between 5 wt-% and 40 wt-% acid. Acid extraction conditions include a temperature of 10°C to 100°C for a time of 10 minutes to 24 hours. Once treated with the acid, the treated UZM zeolite is isolated by means such as filtration, washed with deionized water and dried at ambient temperature up to 100°C.<br>
[0027]       The extent of dealumination obtained from acid extraction depends on the cation form of the starting UZM as well as the acid concentration and the time and temperature over which the extraction is conducted. For example, if organic cations are present in the starting UZM zeolite, the extent of dealumination will be slight compared to a UZM zeolite in which the organic cations have been removed. This may be preferred if it is desired to have dealumination just at the surface of the UZM zeolite. As stated above, convenient ways of removing the organic cations include calcination, ammonia calcination, steaming and ion exchange. Calcination, ammonia calcination and ion exchange conditions are as set forth above. Steaming conditions include a temperature of 400°C to 850°C with from 1% to 100% steam for a time of 10 minutes to 48 hours and preferably a temperature of 500°C to 600°C, steam concentration of 5 to 50% and a time of 1 to 2 hours.<br>
[0028]       It should be pointed out that both calcination and steaming treatments not only remove organic cations, but can also dealuminate the zeolite. Thus, alternate embodiments for dealumination include: a calcination treatment followed by acid<br>
extraction and steaming followed by acid extraction. A further embodiment for dealumination comprises calcining or steaming the starting UZM zeolite followed by an ion-exchange treatment. Of course an acid extraction can be carried out concurrently with, before or after the ion exchange.<br>
[0029]       The ion exchange conditions are the same as set forth above, namely a temperature of 15°C to 100°C and a time of 20 minutes to 50 hours. Ion exchange can be carried out with a solution comprising a cation (Ml1) selected from the group consisting of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, rare earth metals, hydrogen ion, ammonium ion, and mixtures thereof. By carrying out this ion exchange, the Ml cation is exchanged for a secondary or different Ml' cation. In a preferred embodiment, the UZM composition after the steaming or calcining steps is contacted with an ion exchange solution comprising an ammonium salt. Examples of ammonium salts include but are not limited to ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride, ammonium bromide, and ammonium acetate. The ammonium ion containing solution can optionally contain a mineral acid such as but not limited to nitric, hydrochloric, sulfuric and mixtures thereof. The concentration of the mineral acid is that amount necessary to give a ratio of H* to NH4+ of 0 to 1. This ammonium ion exchange aids in removing any debris present in the pores after the steaming and/or calcination treatments.<br>
[0030]       It is apparent from the foregoing that, with respect to effective process conditions, it is desirable that the integrity of the zeolite crystal structure be substantially maintained throughout the dealumination process, and that the zeolite retains at least 50%, preferably at least 70% and more preferably at least 90% of its original crystallinity. A convenient technique for assessing the crystallinity of the products relative to the crystallinity of the starting material is the comparison of the relative intensities of the rf-spacing of their respective X-ray powder diffraction patterns. The sum of the peak intensities, in arbitrary units above the background, of the starting material is used as the standard and is compared with the corresponding peak intensities of the products. When, for example, the numerical sum of the peak heights of the molecular sieve product is 85 percent of the value of the sum of the<br>
peak intensities of the starting zeolite, then 85 percent of the crystallinity has been retained. In practice it is common to utilize only a portion of the peaks for this purpose, as for example, five or six of the strongest peaks. Other indications of the retention of crystallinity are surface area and adsorption capacity. These tests may be preferred when the substituted metal significantly changes, e.g., increases, the absorption of x-rays by the sample or when peaks experience substantial shifts such as in the dealumination process.<br>
[0031]       After having undergone any of the dealumination treatments as described above, the UZM zeolite is usually dried and can be used as discussed below. The properties of the modified UZM zeolite can be further modified by one or more additional treatment. These treatments include steaming, calcining or ion exchanging and can be carried out individually or in any combination. Some of these combinations include but are not limited to:<br><br>
calcine 	ion exchange; <br>
— ~— •• &gt;           steam           • 	 <br><br>
*     calcine 	*            steam <br>
&gt;     steam 	*           calcine; <br>
steam<br>
ion exchange ion exchange<br>
steam	»	calcine;<br>
[0032]       The dealumination treatment described above can be combined in any order to provide the zeolites of the invention although not necessarily with equivalent result. It should be pointed out that the particular sequence of treatments, e.g., AFS, acid extraction, steaming, calcining, etc can be repeated as many times as necessary to obtain the desired properties. Of course one treatment can be repeated while not repeating other treatments, e.g., repeating the AFS two or more times before carrying out steaming or calcining, etc. Finally, the sequence and/or repetition of treatments will determine the properties of the final UZM-4M, UZM-5HS, UZM-8HS, 15HS or 16HS composition.<br>
[0033]       In specifying the proportions of the zeolite starting material or adsorption properties of the zeolite product and the like herein, the "anhydrous state" of the zeolite will be intended unless otherwise stated. The term "anhydrous state" is employed herein to refer to a zeolite substantially devoid of both physically adsorbed and chemically adsorbed water.<br>
[0034]       A second component of the catalyst of the invention is a catalytic metal component which is selected from the metals of Group VTil (Groups 8, 9 and 10 of the IUPAC designation) of the Periodic Table of the Elements and preferably from the noble metals. The group of noble metals are ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, platinum, iridium and osmium. Preferred catalytic metals are platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0035]       The catalytic metal component can be deposited either on the molecular sieve or on a refractory inorganic oxide component. Inorganic oxides which can be used are any of those well known in the art and include but are not limited to aluminas, silica/alumina, silica, titania, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, clays and zirconia. In order to avoid confusion it is pointed out that the term silica/alumina does not mean a physical mixture of silica and alumina but means an acidic and amorphous material that has been cogelled orcoprecipitated. The term is well known in the art, see e.g. US-A-3,909,450; US-A-3,274,124 and US-A-4,988,659. The aluminas which can be used include gamma alumina, theta alumina, delta and alpha alumina.<br>
[0036]       The catalytic metal component is deposited onto either the zeolite or inorganic oxide by means well known in the art such as spray impregnation or evaporative impregnation. Both spray or evaporative impregnation use a solution containing a decomposable compound of the desired metal. By decomposable is meant that upon heating the compound decomposes to provide the catalytic metal or catalytic metal oxide. Non-limiting examples of decomposable compounds which can be used include chloroplatinic acid, palladic acid, chloroiridic acid, rhodium trichloride, ruthenium tetrachloride, osmium trichloride, iron chloride, cobalt chloride, nickel chloride, iron nitrate, cobalt nitrate, nickel nitrate, rhodium nitrate, ammonium chloroplatinate, platinum tetrachloride hydrate, palladium chloride, palladium nitrate,<br>
tetraamine platinum chloride and tetraamminepalladium (IT) chloride. The solvent which is used to prepare the solution is usually water although organic solvents such as alcohols, dimethyl formamide (DMP), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and amines, e.g., pyridine can be used.<br>
[0037]       Spray impregnation involves taking a small volume of the solution and spraying it over the support (zeolite or oxide) while the support is moving. When the spraying is over, the wetted support can be transferred to other apparatus for drying or finishing steps.<br>
[0038]       One particular method of evaporative impregnation involves the use of a steam-jacketed rotary dryer. In this method the support is immersed in the impregnating solution which has been placed in the dryer and the support is tumbled by the rotating motion of the dryer. Evaporation of the solution in contact with the tumbling support is expedited by applying steam to the dryer jacket. The impregnated support is then dried at a temperature of 60°C to 300°C and then calcined at a temperature of 300°C to 850°C for a time of 30 minutes to 8 hours to give the calcined catalyst.<br>
[0039]       When the molecular sieve is the support, the catalytic metal component can also be deposited thereon by ion-exchange. Ion-exchange is earned out by contacting the molecular sieve with a solution containing a compound of the desired metal at ion-exchange conditions which include a temperature of 20°C to 100°C for a time from 5 minutes to 6 hours.<br>
[0040]       When the catalytic metal component is deposited on the refractory inorganic oxide component, the catalyst comprises separate particles. One configuration is a loose mixture of the two particles (refractory oxide and zeolite particles) or the particles are mixed and then formed into shaped articles such as cylinders, pellets, pills, spheres, irregularly shaped particles, etc. Methods of preparing such shaped articles are well known in the art. In the case where the catalytic metal is deposited on the molecular sieve, then the inorganic oxide acts as a binder so that the resultant mixture can be formed into any of the shapes described above.<br>
[0041]       In another embodiment, the molecular sieve and inorganic oxide are first mixed and formed into a shaped article and then the catalytic metal is deposited onto the composite article by any of the means described above. In this case, the catalytic metal is believed to be deposited on both the inorganic oxide and zeolite supports. Regardless of how and where the catalytic metal is deposited, it is present in the final catalyst in an amount from 0.01 to 10 weight percent of the catalyst expressed as the metal. It should also be pointed out that the metal component can be present on the catalyst in its elemental (zero valent) state or as the oxide.<br>
[0042]       The catalyst can also contains a modifier which modifies the activity of the catalytic metal. The modifier is selected from the group consisting of titanium, niobium, rare earth elements, tin, rhenium, zinc, germanium and mixtures thereof. Preferred rare earth elements are cerium, ytterbium, lanthanum, dysprosium and mixtures thereof. The modifier component is deposited by the same techniques as described above for the catalytic metals. Further, the modifier can be deposited on the support before, after or simultaneously with the catalytic metal, although not necessarily with equivalent results. It is preferred to deposit the modifier with the catalytic metal. The amount of modifier can vary substantially but is usually in the range of 0.1 to 50 wt.-%, preferably 1 to 10 wt.-% of the catalyst as the element.<br>
[0043]       The catalyst described above is used in a process where cyclic paraffins are opened or cleaved to acyclic paraffins. The feeds which can be used in the ring opening process are any of those which comprises C$ - C&amp; aliphatic rings, i.e. naphthenic rings. Naphtha feeds can vary considerably in the amount of aromatic, naphthene and paraffin components which they complain. Depending on the source, feeds can contain from 15% to 55% naphthenes. One example of naphtha feed was found to contain 17 wt.-% aromatics, 44 wt.-% naphthenes and 39 wt.-% aromatics.<br>
[0044]       The feedstream is contacted with the catalyst at ring opening conditions which include a temperature of 200°C to 600°C, a pressure of atmospheric to 20,684 kPag, and preferably from 1379 kPag to 13790 kPag, a liquid hourly space velocity of 0.1 to 30 hr"1 and preferably 2 to 10 hr"' and H2/HC (hydrocarbon) ratio from 0.1 to 30 and preferably from 1 to 10.<br>
