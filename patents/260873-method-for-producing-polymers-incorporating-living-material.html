				<td>Process for manufacturing hydrophobic polymers<br>
5      Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing hydrophobic polymers<br>
incorporating living organisms and/or cell products.<br>
10      Prior art<br>
This type of method is known for non-permanent,  biodegradable hydrophilic<br>
polymers with a melting point well below 1000C, in which temperature-sensitive<br>
tissue cells and organic molecules are incorporated. The polymer degrades after a<br>
15     short time.<br>
American patent US-5,985,354 in the name of MATHIOWITZ describes a method<br>
of the above type. The problem encountered in the known prior art is that the<br>
melting point of permanent, non-biodegradable polymers is well above 1000C at<br>
20 normal pressure conditions for the incorporation of living material. The<br>
implantation of living, active organisms or microorganisms at temperatures of this<br>
level is impossible without fatal consequences for these organisms. Accordingly, it<br>
has to be assumed that the incorporation of living material during the production of<br>
a usable object from the base material, in this case the polymer, is not achievable,<br>
25 even if the organisms which are introduced can subsequently perform useful<br>
activity at normal ambient temperatures. Possible activities in this respect are<br>
oxygen consumption or absorption, absorption of radiant energy, including what is<br>
known as "UV blocking", and the like. The above therefore demonstrates that<br>
currently there are considerable restrictions in the possible range of applications<br>
30     for living cells in this type of polymer.<br>
A further problem encountered in the known prior art is that the slow diffusion of<br>
cellular components and biomolecules in a moist environment is based on a<br>
technology which is predicated on multi-wall microcapsules of hydrophilic, soluble<br>
35 or biodegradable polymers. However, there is currently no available technology<br>
which permits the slow diffusion of a gamma to biomolecules from a permanent<br><br>
-  2   -<br>
polymeric carrier without it being degraded in an aqueous and/or dry environment.<br>
This applies in particular to biomolecules of the hydrophobic fatty acid type, such<br>
as lipids and hydrocarbons.<br>
5 Therefore, the known prior art mainly has the following shortcoming, namely that<br>
bio-encapsulation of cells in polymers is not possible above 1000C under standard<br>
pressure conditions, on the one hand, and that slow diffusion of cellular<br>
metabolites and related organic molecules from polymers is not possible without<br>
degradation of the polymer in a moist environment, on the other hand.<br>
10<br>
Object of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to offer a solution to the abovementioned<br>
drawbacks and/or shortcomings.<br>
15<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
According to the present invention, there is proposed a method for producing<br>
hydrophobic   polymers   in   which   a   hydrophobic   polymer   is   selected,   and<br>
20 furthermore a set of organisms is selected from cells and/or cell products.<br>
Remarkably, aggregates are then formed by working the said cells into the said<br>
polymer, resulting in the formation of what is known as a polymer-bio aggregate,<br>
referred to below as PBA, producing a novel function of the polymer product<br>
formed in this way.<br>
25<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, further to the main measure<br>
defined above, there is defined that the work is carried out in the operating<br>
temperature range taken from the temperature range for which the lower limit is<br>
set at virtually 1000C under virtually standard pressure conditions, in particular at<br>
30     virtually one atmosphere.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, there is defined that<br>
the abovementioned cells are selected from the category of what are known as the<br>
cysts and/or in a phase of inactive or dormant stages. A quite significant number<br>
35 of types of organisms or microorganisms can change from an active life form to<br>
what is known as a quiescent stage or spore, known as cysts. Said spores are<br><br>
-   3   -<br>
able to withstand extreme environmental fluctuations in a latent form. In this state<br>
of anabiosis, they are able to withstand extremely dry conditions and temperatures<br>
well above 1000C.<br>
5 Under suitable biotechnology conditions, these types can not only be cultivated<br>
but also converted, in controlled culture conditions, known an encysting, into<br>
usable spores for bio-encapsulation in a polymeric matrix.<br>
During the production process of an industrial product, such as packaging<br>
10 material, textile fibers, granules or the like, said spores and the polymer are<br>
agglomerated within a short period of time during which the polymer is liquid,<br>
namely at a temperature above its melting point. This produces what is known as<br>
a polymer-bio aggregate, referred to below as "PBA".<br>
15 As long as the product is not in use, the organisms of the bio-component in said<br>
PBA remain inactive. However, as soon as the living conditions become favorable,<br>
coinciding with the product starting to be used in association with an environment<br>
which is suitable for life in terms of temperature and relative humidity, the spores<br>
change into active, metabolizing cells under these favorable ambient conditions.<br>
20 For this period, the biologically active form will perform its intended function. As<br>
soon as the optimum conditions revert to conditions which are less than optimum,<br>
the active form returns to the spore.<br>
The process remains reversible in accordance with a feedback mechanism which<br>
25     is controlled by the living environment of the organism in said PBA.<br>
Thus, according to a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, said cell<br>
products  are  selected  from  the  category  of so-called   metabolites,   i.e.   the<br>
molecules   which   are   biochemically   synthesized   by   organisms   under   the<br>
30     abovementioned temperature working conditions.<br>
According to yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
polymers are selected from  non-biodegradable polymers.  Reliable,  slow and<br>
prolonged diffusion of organic molecules out of polymers into a moist or fluctuating<br>
35     environment can be realized without degradation of the polymer.<br><br>
-   4   -<br>
An advantage obtained by virtue of the method defined by the present invention is<br>
mainly that the biological activity of the organisms incorporated in the so-called<br>
PBA produced in accordance with the invention imparts novel, previously unknown<br>
properties to the polymer. Said PBA hereby ensures the desired environment for<br>
 5     which said PBA was made.<br>
A  further  advantage  consists  in  the  standardized   release  of very  specific<br>
biomolecules, such as so-called repellents, from a polymeric matrix, such as<br>
granules, textile fibers and the like, without said polymeric matrix being lost in a<br>
10      variable environment as a result of climatological instabilities, for example.<br>
Further features and properties of the present invention are defined in further sub-<br>
claims.<br>
15 Further details and particularities will emerge from the following description of a<br>
number of exemplary embodiments of the method according to the invention and<br>
its uses.<br>
Description<br>
20<br>
In general terms, the present invention relates to a method for producing<br>
hydrophobic polymers which incorporate living organisms and/or cell products. A<br>
number of specific use examples are described below.<br>
25 A particularly significant application area is in the food packaging sector which<br>
employs what is known as an oxygen barrier, with a PBA layer arranged as an<br>
intermediate layer in multi-layer packaging material for foodstuffs, such as PET<br>
bottles for beverages, such as beers or fruit juices for example. The polymer<br>
component of the PBA is in this case PET, while the PBA bio component is a type<br>
30 of yeast with a dry spore, such as for example Saccharomyces, which is able to<br>
withstand the high temperatures of the production process. The PBA remains<br>
inactive until the PET bottle has been filled. When the package is being filled with<br>
fruit juices or beer, for example, the internal environment of the PBA becomes<br>
water-saturated, with the result that the spores are activated to form respiring cells<br>
35 which consume all the oxygen present inside the bottle. As a result, all the oxygen<br>
is withdrawn from the contents under the influence of what is known as the O2<br><br>
~~   5    ~<br>
scavenger. Also, all the external oxygen which can diffuse through the wall is<br>
captured by the yeast cells for respiration, which results in an efficient oxygen<br>
barrier.<br>
5 A further example of a use consists in the action as a UV blocker, which works in a<br>
similar way to the above example. Instead of the yeast cells, there is incorporated<br>
in the PBA a type of alga, such as for example Haematococcus, the spores of<br>
which very intensively block UV light. A continuous layer of Haematococcus cells,<br>
haematocysts with a high concentration of astaxanthin, makes the PBA opaque to<br>
10 UV light. This fact is utilized in moisture-resistant UV-proof films and polymer<br>
coverings.<br>
A still further use consists in the combined application of both examples<br>
mentioned above in connection with food packaging with an oxygen barrier and a<br>
15 UV blocker which is suitable for PET bottles as packaging for beers and fruit juices<br>
and the like. The PBA biocomponent is a calibrated mixture of Saccharomyces<br>
and Haematococcus. Said oxygen scavengers, such as yeast cells for example,<br>
represent a permanent oxygen barrier, while the UV blocker, such as a type of<br>
alga, for example, prevents photochemical degradation of the filling.<br>
20<br>
Yet another application consists in the absorption of energy from sunlight with a<br>
cooling effect which is similar to the example above relating to the so-called UV<br>
blocker. Instead of Haematococcus, the PBA incorporates a type of alga such as<br>
for example Chlorococcus, the active form of which, in the presence of a high<br>
25 degree of moisture, participates very intensively in photosynthesis, consuming<br>
high-energy rays of the sunlight. A continuous layer of cells will provide the PBA<br>
with an energy-absorbing function, resulting in a non-heating, in other words<br>
cooling, effect at the bottom of the polymer. The above effect is utilized in<br>
moisture-resistant films and polymer coverings for sun-shielding purposes.<br>
30<br>
Finally there is the application example ranging from energy-absorbing cloth to<br>
perspiration-sensitive sports clothing which derives from the previous example. A<br>
PBA with a polymer component of polypropylene and a biocomponent of<br>
photosynthesizing organisms, such as a cyanobacterium or a unicellular alga type,<br>
35 is extruded to form a textile fiber. The temperature-resistant spores of the algae,<br>
after they have been extruded to form a fiber, are processed to produce a textile<br><br>
-   6   -<br>
product. Use of fibers of this type in textile products ranges from covering fabrics,<br>
such as canvas, to sports clothing. For the absorption of moisture, for example<br>
sweat, the incorporated cells will convert the incident energy of sunlight into<br>
photosynthetic metabolites. As a result, the incident solar radiation is not<br>
5 converted into heat, but rather is extracted from the textile fiber, resulting in the<br>
desired cooling action. When drying out when no further sweat is being produced,<br>
the cells revert to their latent, inactive state. This is because the process is<br>
reversible.<br>
10 Application examples relating to slow diffusion of cellular components and at least<br>
partially hydrophobic biomolecules in a moist environment are described below.<br>
In a variant on the UV blocker from the above example, the active metabolite,<br>
astaxanthin, which very intensively blocks UV light, is incorporated in the PBA<br>
15 instead of the Haematococcus cells. As an alternative to the expensive component<br>
astaxanthin, it may be possible to use less expensive UV blockers. The diffusion<br>
rate of the UV blocker from the PBA in the middle layer of the polylamellar film to<br>
the periphery is regulated at a low to very low diffusion rate, depending on the<br>
quality and requirements. This fact is exploited in moisture-resistant UV-repellent<br>
20 films and polymer coverings, as well as for packaging material for food products.<br>
The polymer must in this case be durable and must not deteriorate in moist<br>
conditions.<br>
In this context, an additional example of application consists in insect-repellent<br>
25     films, fibers - textile - and microgranules. This represents a variant on the above<br>
example. In this case, the bio component of the PBA is a bio-active organic<br>
molecule or a mixture of molecules, preferably hydrophobic substances, such as<br>
lipids, fatty acids, isoprene derivatives and hydrocarbons. In addition to a film or<br>
laminate, the processed product may also be a PBA which is processed to form a<br>
30     textile fiber or granule or microgranule, in which the biocomponent is released to<br>
the environment at a predetermined rate. This component has a specific repellent<br>
action to insects. Examples which have been tested include:<br>
PBA with isoprene derivates and/or branched hydrocarbons with a repellent<br>
activity to house dust mites. The PBA is extruded to form a textile fiber for weaving<br>
35     a fixed carpet and other products which have to be resistant to house dust mites;<br>
and<br><br>
-   7   -<br>
PBA with fatty acid components which are repellent to diptera, namely flies and<br>
mosquitoes, and biting and blood-sucking lice, Mallophaga, Anoplura,<br>
respectively, as well as the human head louse and poultry lice, cockroaches, ants<br>
and wasps. The PBA is granulated or extruded to form a textile fiber. The laden<br>
5 granules are mixed into the animal's coat, to protect against myiasis, horsefly and<br>
the like, or are scattered on the nesting site of the host of the parasite in question.<br>
Laden fibers are processed to form a protective textile as a nightcap to kill head<br>
lice, or what is known as a tissue with which an object can be rubbed to protect<br>
against ants, cockroaches, flies and the like.<br>
10<br>
Further to the above example, another important application is the use of the<br>
PBAs as a crop protection agent, in particular as a herbicide or even as a<br>
fungicide.<br>
15 The biological activity of the organisms incorporated in the PBA gives the polymer<br>
new properties which were not previously known. The PBA ensures the desired<br>
environment for which the PBA was made, such as for example an anaerobic<br>
environment, complete oxygen barrier, energy absorption of solar radiation,<br>
controlled release of metabolites and the like.<br>
2 0<br>
The interaction and exchange of various types of organisms or microorganisms<br>
and/or molecules in the bio component of the PBA can also yield a large number<br>
of possible applications.<br><br>
