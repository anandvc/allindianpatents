TITLE<br>
Fenofibrate-Cyclodextrin Inclusion Complexes and their Pharmaceutical Composition<br><br>
APPLICANTS<br>
	USV Limited, BSD Marg, Govandi,<br>
	Mumbai 400088, Maharashtra, India,<br>
  	an Indian Company<br><br>
INVENTORS<br>
Dr Gidwani Suresh Kumar and Singnurkar Shashikant Purushottam, USV Limited, BSD Marg, Govandi, Mumbai 400088, Maharashtra, India, both Indian Nationals<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel pharmaceutical compositions having a high dissolution profile. In particular, the invention relates to compositions including cyclodextrin, inclusion complexes and method for preparing the same. The present application claims the benefit of US provisional application No 60/382,997, filed on May 23, 2002 which is incorporated   herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND   OF THE INVENTION<br>
2<br>
Fenofibrate corresponds to the nomenclature of 2-[4-(4-chlorobenzoyl)phenoxy]-2-methyl propionate and is insoluble in water. Fenofibrate   has the formula:<br><br><br>
With an aqueous solubility of less than 0.5 mg/liter, the dissolution of fenofibrate likely represents the rate limiting steps before the drug becomes adsorbed in the body. Fenofibrate is a neutral, lipophilic compound having a lipid water distribution coefficient, log P = 5,24, and is a well-known hypolipemiant from the family of fibrates, which is commercially available in various doses (100 and 300 mg for example Secalip ) but in a form leading to poor  bioavailability of the active ingredient.<br>
Bioavailability is the degree to which or rate at which a drug or other substance is absorbed or becomes available at the site of physiological activity after administration. Drugs having a high dissolution profile have a higher bioavailability than drugs that have a low dissolution profile. A hypolipemiant is a drug that reduces the amount of lipids (fats) in the blood. Lipophilic is a substance having affinity for, tending to combine with, or capable of dissolving in lipids. Fenofibrate is both hypolipemiant and lipophilic. Due to its poor hydrosolubility (solubility in water), however, fenofibrate is poorly absorbed   in the digestive tract   and consequently   its bioavailability is<br>
3<br><br>
incomplete, irregular and often varies from one person to another. As a result, commercially available doses must be of higher strength and require     application several times a day.<br>
EPA-0330532 to Curtet et al, describes a method for improving bioavailability of fenofibrate by co-micronizing fenofibrate with a surfactant, for example sodium lauryl sulphate, in order to improve fenofibrate solubility. According to this invention, 200 mg of co-micronized fenofibrate was found to be bioequivalent to 300 mg of non-micronized fenofibrate. However, this improvement in dissolution and bioavailability is not satisfactory because the technique of co-micronizing with a surfactant still leads to incomplete dissolution of fenofibrate.<br>
US 6,277,405 B 1 to Stamm, et al, describes a fenofibrate pharmaceutical composition having enhanced bioavailability. It comprises spraying a suspension of a micronized fenofibrate with hydrophilic polymer, for example, polyvinyl pyrrolidone onto an inert carrier. Following granulation, the granulate formed consists of crystals   of,   for  example, lactose,   which are   isolated    and particles of<br>
4<br><br>
micronized fenofibrate and PVP adhere to the crystal surface. The granulate obtained is compressed to form tablets. This composition has been shown to have a dissolution of at least 10% in 5 minutes, 20% in 10 minutes, 50% in 20 minutes and 75% in -30. minutes as measured by using the rotating blade method at 15 rpm, in a dissolution medium constituted by water with 2% by weight polysorbate 80 or with 0.025 M sodium lauryl sulphate. Although the composition described in the '405 patent appears to show improved bioavailability, its method of preparation is complex and expensive. For example, the process described by Stamm et al. involves spray coating of fenofibrate with polyvinyl pyrrolidone onto an inert carrier. This process not only involves the material loss of fenofibrate but also requires expensive equipment such as a fluidized bed coater / granulator    that is difficult to scale   up for a commercial product.<br>
US 6,294,192 To Patel, et al, describes triglyceride free compositions and methods for improved delivery of hydrophobic therapeutic agent, for example fenofibrate. Prepared by simple physical mixing, the compositions include a hydrophobic therapeutic agent and a  carrier,      where   the   carrier is   formed    from a    combination    of a<br>
5<br><br>
hydrophilic surfactant and a hydrophobic surfactant. Upon dilution with an aqueous solvent, the composition forms a clear aqueous dispersion of the surfactant containing a hydrophobic therapeutic agent. Patel et al. also refer to fenofibrate as one of the hydrophobic therapeutic agent but do not provide any bioavailability improvement data on fenofibrate. The carrier described in Patel et al. further comprises cyclodextrin or cyclodextrin derivatives as an additional solubilizer to enhance the solubility of the hydrophobic therapeutic agent and not as the carrier itself. Further, Patel et al. do not provide any information or data for the use and effect of such solubilizers and their concentrations. By gently mixing or shaking the cyclodextrin with the carrier, the drug employed in the compositions of Patel et al. gains only marginal improvement in solubility (dissolution) and/or bioavailability.<br>
This invention       provides    an     inclusion complex	of<br>
fenofibrate with cyclodextrin, the complex having enhanced bioavailability as compared to either fenofibrate alone or a suspension of a micronized fenofibrate with hydrophilic polymer, such as PVP. As such,  the present  invention  overcomes  the     limitations  still existing  in<br>
6<br><br>
available fenofibrate products so as to improve the dissolution profile, improve absorption characteristics improve bioavailability of fenofibrate and reduce the dose required for administration to attain a desired effect as compared to that for a fenofibrate pharmaceutical composition that is not part of a complex with cyclodextrin. Thus, there is still a need to provide fenofibrate pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms having enhanced bioavailability where the dissolution of fenofibrate in the body is increased to a level of 100% within a short period of time after administration in comparison to a level of dissolution that fenofibrate has by itself, before it forms an inclusion complex with cyclodextrin. That is, the fenofibrate pharmaceutical composition has a characteristic that allows a dosage form of the inclusion complex of fenofibrate with cyclodextrin to be completely dissolved within a   short time after administration.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An aspect of the present invention resides in providing an immediate release pharmaceutical composition comprising an inclusion complex    of fenofibrate    with cyclodextrin which complex shows rapid<br>
7<br><br>
and   complete    dissolution    of   fenofibrate, resulting       into enhanced bioavailability.<br>
Another aspect of the invention resides in a method for the preparation of an inclusion complex of fenofibrate with cyclodextrin which is efficient and economical, simple and less time consuming than conventional techniques, and which is suitable for manufacture of a   product on commercial scale.<br>
Preferably, the complex of fenofibrate with cyclodextrin renders the active drug fenofibrate highly soluble and/or rapidly dissoluble in physiological fluids including gastric fluid. Dissolution levels of fenofibrate can reach from about 80% to about 100% in a relatively short amount of time from about 10 to about 30 minutes, preferably from about   10   to about 20 minutes.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention is to provide pharmaceutical compositions of an inclusion complex of fenofibrate with cylodextrin, which renders the active drug fenofibrate highly soluble and/or   rapidly dissoluable    and safe    for use as a pharmaceutical.<br>
8<br><br>
Still another aspect of the present invention is to provide a method for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions having an inclusion complex of fenofibrate with cyclodextrin, which results in a product safe for use as a pharmaceutical and which renders the active drug fenofibrate highly soluble in physiological as well as in gastric fluid   pH.<br>
Other improvements which the present invention provides over the prior art will be identified as a result of the following description which sets forth the preferred embodiments of the present invention. The description is not in any way intended to limit the scope of the present invention, but rather only to provide a working example of the presently preferred embodiments.

17<br><br>
The fenofibrate - cyclodextrin inclusion complex of the invention is unreported hitherto and is novel. According to the invention, the fenofibrate is in micronized form having an average particle size suitable for interaction with cyclodextrin. The micronized fenofibrate has increased surface area for better interaction with cyclodextrin or cyclodextrin derivatives. The solvent used is in considerably less quantity then previously known in the art. For example, a solvent to cyclodextrin molar ratio of from about 1 : 1.5 to about 1:4 is sufficient to wet the cyclodextrin and result in a semisold reaction mixture. The semisolid mixture of cyclodextrin is amenable to shear mixing with fenofibrate because of which it has been possible to obtain an inclusion complex in which the fenofibrate is uniformly distributed and dispersed in cyclodextrin matrix. The shear mixed inclusion complexes prepared by the method of the invention show rapid and high aqueous solubility of fenofibrate. For example, the shear mixed inclusion complexes show a 95% dissolution at physiological pH of 6.8 within 15 minutes and 100% dissolution in within 30 minutes. 70% dissolution in neutral pH of water within 30 minutes and 45% dissolution in pH of 1.2 (gastric fluid) within 30 minutes. Shear mixing is   provided   by methods well known in the art, for example by using a<br>
18<br><br>
high shear mixer as manufactured by Diosna Mixer, West Germany or<br>
its equivalent.<br>
The following experimental examples are illustrative of the best mode of the invention but not limited to the scope thereof All the materials   used in the   examples   below    are   commercially   readily<br>
available.<br>
Example 1<br>
The purpose of this example was to prepare of an inclusion complex    of fenofibrate   and beta cyclodextrin.<br>
Beta cyclodextrin (504 gm) having an average particle size from about 10 (um to about 70 um was mixed with 216 ml of demineralised water. The water : beta cyclodextrin ratio was 1 : 2.33. The reaction mixture was mixed in a suitable high shear mixer available from Diosna Mixer, West Germany or its equivalent to obtain a semisolid mixture. To the semisolid beta cyclodextrin mixture, fenofibrate (160 gm) milled to an average particle size of from about 2 um   to about 40 u.m   was added and mixed in a high shear mixer for<br>
19<br><br>
1  hour. The fenofibrate : beta cyclodextrin   molar ratio was  1:1. The resulting semisolid mass was dried   at from   about 40°C to about 60°C<br>
to obtain a solid inclusion complex of fenofibrate with beta cyclodextrin.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 An inclusion    complex of fenofibrate   and beta cyclodextrin was prepared according   to a procedure   analogous to that of Example 1.<br>
A mixture of isopropyl alcohol (80 ml) with water (120 ml) was used instead of demineralised water. The mixture of isopropyl alcohol and water was mixed with 504 gm of beta cyclodextrin to obtain an inclusion complex having a molar ratio of fenofibrate : beta cyclodextrin of about 1:1. The molar ratio of isopropyl alcohol with water mixture    to beta cyclodextrin was  1 ; 2.52.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 The procedure  of   Example   1   was    followed  using    beta cyclodextrin   (1008 gm)    to   obtain    an inclusion complex   which had a molar ratio of fenofibrate : beta cyclodextrin of 1:2 and a molar ratio of water to beta cyclodextrin of 1 : 2.33.<br>

EXAMPLE 5 The procedure of Example 1 was followed using gamma cyclodextrin (575 gm) (Cerestar Inc., USA) to obtain an inclusion complex wherein the molar ratio of fenofibrate : gamma cyclodextrin was 1 ; 2 and the molar ratio of water : gamma cyclodextrin ratio was 1 : 2.21.<br>
EXAMPLE 6 The procedure   of Example 1  was followed using randomly methylated beta    cyclodextrin (590 gm)  (Cerestar Inc., USA)   to obtain an inclusion    complex   having a   molar  ratio     of fenofibrate : gamma<br>
21<br><br>
cyclodextrin   of   1:1,   and a   ratio of water : gamma cyclodextnn of   1 : 2.10.<br>
EXAMPLE 7 The procedure of Example 1 was followed using isopropyl alcohol (230 ml) (MERCK KgaA, Germany) instead of demineralized water to obtain an inclusion complex. The isopropyl alcohol : beta cyclodextrin ratio, was 1 : 2.19. The fenofibrate : beta cyclodextrin molar ratio   was 1:1.<br>
EXAMPLE 8 The procedure of Example 9 was followed using isopropyl alcohol (460 ml) and beta cyclodextrin (1008 gm) to obtain an inclusion complex wherein the molar ratio of fenofibrate : beta cyclodextrin was 1 : 2, and the molar ratio of isopropyl alcohol: beta cyclodextrin was 1 : 2.19.<br>
22<br><br>
EXAMPLE 9 The    procedure     of    Example     6  was     followed    using hydroxypropyl    beta    cyclodextrin    (670 gm) (Cerestar Inc, USA) and isopropyl alcohol.      The resulting   inclusion complex had a molar ratio<br>
of   fenofibrate :  hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin  of  1:1, and a  molar ratio   of isopropyl alcohol : hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin of 1 : 3.72.<br>
EXAMPLE  10 A pharmaceutical composition in tablet form comprising 160 mg of fenofibrate   was prepared by homogeneously mixing the inclusion complex of Example  1    with the excipients    set forth in Table  1 below :<br>
23<br><br><br>
TABLE  1<br>
The ingredients set forth in Table 1 above are easily commercially available. Subsequently, the resulting pharmaceutical composition was directly compressed into tablets by methods well known in the art. For example, the tablet can be obtained on an alternating compression medicine (e.g. Korsch EKO) or a rotary machine (e.g. Fette Perfecta 2).<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
The fenofibrate tablets obtained in Example 13 were film coated with a film coating having the composition set forth in Table 2 below;<br>
TABLE 2<br><br>
The above ingredients are easily commercially available. To coat the fenofibrate tablets, film coating procedures well known in the art were used. Tablets were coated in an Accela Coater by spraying the coating solution of the above composition at a flow rate of about 40 to about 80 ml per minute and a pressure of from about 4 to about 6 Kg / square cm.   During   coating the   tablet    bed   temperature   was   kept   at<br>
25<br><br>
from about   35°C     to   about     45°C   with   air blower   under   exhaust throughout the coating process.<br>
EXAMPLE 12 A pharmaceutical composition in capsule form comprising 160 mg of fenofibrate was prepared by homogeneously mixing the inclusion complex of Example 1 with the additives set forth in Table 3 below, before being filled into hard gelatin capsule of size 0, according to methods well known in the art. All ingredients listed below are easily commercially available   from services as listed in Table  1.<br>
Table 3<br><br>
Ingredients	Contents      in Tablet<br>
Inclusion complex of Example 1	664 mg<br>
Microcrystalline cellulose	32 mg<br>
Sodium starch glycolate	12 mg<br>
Talc	8 mg<br>
Crosspovidone	12 mg<br>
Colloidal silicone dioxide	4 mg<br>
Magnesium stearate	10 mg<br>

EXAMPLE 13 160 gm  of fenofibrate    was mixed   with   504    gm of beta cyclodextnn to provide a mixture     containing  160mgof fenofibrate per 664    mg    of mixture    wherein the molar    ratio of   fenofibrate : beta cyclodextnn was 1:1.<br>
EXAMPLE 14 In this  example, the inclusion complex    of Example 1   was characterized by high pressure    liquid    chromatography    (HPLC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).<br>
A.      Quantitative determination of fenofibrate  form inclusion complex by HPLC<br>
The   potency    of  inclusion complex   was   calculated   by   HPLC with the following parameters as listed in Table 4 below:<br>
27<br><br><br>
TABLE 4<br>
The retention of fenofibrate was found to be 12.5 minutes for 32 mg of the inclusion complex of Example 1 which contained 5.01 mg of fenofibrate. This assay level proved that fenofibrate was uniformly   dispersed    through out the inclusion complex.<br>
B.       Differential Scanning Calorimetry Study<br>
Thermogram of fenofibrate, beta cyclodextrin, a physical mixture of fenofibrate and beta cyclodextrin in a molar ratito 1 : 1 and the fenofibrate - beta cyclodextrin inclusion complex of the invention were as shown in figures 1A, 1B, 1C and 1D respectively. The thermograms were taken with Mettler TC11K - DSC, manufactured   by Mettler Instruments<br>
28<br><br>
AG, Switzerland. The peak at 80.1°C in Figure 1A was due to the melting of fenofibrate. Figure 2B showed an endothermic peak at 303.3°C corresponding to beta cyclodextrin and one peak at 96°C due to the moisture content of beta cyclodextrin. The physical mixture showed endothermic peak of both fenofibrate at 79.8°C and beta cyclodextrin at 299.9°C as in Figure 1C. The inclusion complex showed an drastic reduction in the intensity of the fenofibrate peak at 79.4°C as in Figure ID, indicating the formation of inclusion complex.<br>
EXAMPLE 15 In this example, in-vitro dissolution studies of the fenofibrate inclusion complexes of the invention and fenofibrate (micronized form) were performed using the rotating blade method at 75 rpm according to the USP24, in a dissolution medium constituted by water with 0.025 M sodium lauryl sulphate and water with 2% by weight polysorbate - 80.   The results were as shown in Table 5 below:<br>
