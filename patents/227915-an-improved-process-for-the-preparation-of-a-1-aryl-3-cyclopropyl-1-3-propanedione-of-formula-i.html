Using these reaction conditions it has been found that the reaction gives high yields of the desired final product.<br>
Certain compounds of formula (I) and a number of processes for their preparation have been described in the European Patent<br>
Applications cited above.  Compounds (II) are known or may be prepared by known methods. Compound (III) and methods for its preparation are known.<br>
The aprotic solvents which may be used may be nonpolar or polar. Nonpolar aprotic solvents which are suitable include aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons, particularly toluene and xylenes (toluene is preferred); aromatic halogenated hydrocarbons (chlorobenzene is preferred) or ethers such as tert-butyl methyl ether, dioxan or tetrahydrofuran. Examples of suitable polar aprotic solvents include dimethylsulphoxide, N-methylpyrrolidinone, N,N-dimethylformamide or N,N-dimethylacetamide (dimethylsulphoxide and N-methylpyrrolidinone are preferred). Chlorobenzene and toluene are especially preferred because of the good results obtained, and cost and suitability of such solvents for large scale preparations.<br>
Generally the reaction temperature used in the above process is from about 0Â°C to the boiling point of the solvent, preferably from about 0Â°C to about 100Â°C; for non-polar solvents such as toluene or chlorobenzene a temperature of from about 40Â°C to about 90Â°C is especially preferred; whilst for polar aprotic solvents such as dimethylsulphoxide and N-methylpyrrolidinone chlorobenzene a temperature of from about 20Â°C to about 40Â°C is especially preferred.<br>
Generally the reaction takes place in the presence of a strong base which is most preferably selected from an alkoxide of an alkali or alkaline earth metal, notably sodium ethoxide, sodium methoxide, sodium or potassium t-butoxide; and a metal hydride (notably sodium hydride). Sodium methoxide is an especially preferred base for reasons of effectiveness in the reaction.<br>
According to a preferred variant of the process of the present invention the reaction is performed with continuous distillation of the alcohol Rj-OH formed in the course of the reaction, at atmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure (preferably from 150 to 250 mbars).<br>
.Alternatively the alcohol Ri-OH formed may be removed by the use of a suitable molecular sieve, for example a 4 Angstrom molecular sieve. Compounds of formula (II) wherein R2 represents Cj_5 alkylthio;<br>
R3 represents Cj.g haloalkyl and R4 represents hydrogen may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula (IV):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br>
(IV) wherein R] and R3 are as defined above and RÂ£ represents a<br>
halogen atom selected from fluorine, chlorine and bromine (preferably fluorine or chlorine), with an alkylthiol (or metal salt thereof) of formula R2-X wherein R2 is as defined above (preferably methylthio) and X<br>
represents hydrogen or an alkali metal (preferably sodium, potassium or lithium).<br>
Preferably the above reaction to prepare intermediates of formula (II) is performed under substantially anhydrous conditions using a polar aprotic solvent preferably N-methylpyrrolidinone, acetonitrile or dimethylsulphoxide, at a temperature of from about -20Â° to about 150Â°C, preferably 0Â° to about 50Â°C.<br>

The mixture was heated at 55-57T for 1 hour. Methanol was distilled under reduced pressure. After cooling to 20Â°C the mixture was acidified and the organic phase washed (sodium bicarbonate solution and with water) and evaporated to give l-cyclopropyl-3-(2-methylthio-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)propane-l,3-dione as yellow crystals (14.03g). m.p. 64Â°C. A yield of 92.9% was obtained. The purity of the product was 95%.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of l-cyclopropvl-3-(2-methylthio-4-trifluoromethvlphenvl)propane-1.3-dione (large scale).<br>
Sodium methoxide (64g, 1.15M) was added to a mixture of methyl 2-methylthio-4-trifluoromethylbenzoate (200g, 0.8M) in chlorobenzene (380g). The mixture was heated to 75Â°C and cyclopropyl methyl ketone (75g, 0.88M) added during 2 hours whilst maintaining stirring at 75 Â°C. After 4 hours methanol was distilled under reduced pressure, the mixture cooled to 50Â°C , and water followed by sulphuric acid (53g of 36N) added. The organic phase was distilled under reduced pressure to give 1 -cyclopropyl-3 -(2-methylthio-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)propane-1,3-dione as yellow crystals (240g), m.p. 58-60Â°C. A yield of 88% was obtained. The purity of the product was 90%.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of l-cyclopropyl-3-(2-methylthio-4-trifluoromethylphenvl)propane-1.3-dione (small scale).<br>
Sodium methoxide (0.54g. 0.01M) was added to a mixture of methyl 2-methylthio-4-trifluoromethylbenzoate (1.25g. 0.005M) and cyclopropyl methyl ketone (0.5g, 0.006M) in anhydrous N-methylpyrrolidinone and heated at 30Â°C for 3 hours. The cooled mixture was acidified, extracted (ether), washed (water) and evaporated to give 1 -cyclopropyl-3-(2-methylthio-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)propane-1,3-dione (1.43g), m.p.68Â°C in a yield of 94%. The purity of the product was greater than 95%.<br>
The above experiment was repeated but replacing the N-methylpyrrolidinone by dimethylsulphoxide to give the desired product in a yield of 97%. The purity of the product was greater than 95%.<br>
Example 4<br>
By proceeding according to the method described in Example 1 but using sodium methoxide (1.5 equivalents) and cyclopropyl methyl ketone (1.5 equivalents) and replacing the toluene by tert-butyl methyl ether, there was obtained, after 3 hours at 55Â°C (with distillation of methanol), a 92% yield of l-cyclopropyl-3-(2-methylthio-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)propane-l,3-dione (purity 95%).<br>
Example 5<br>
By proceeding according to the method described in Example 1 but using cyclopropyl methyl ketone (1.5 equivalents) and replacing the toluene by tetrahydrofuran, there was obtained, after 5 hours at 40Â°C (without distillation of methanol), a 75% yield of the desired product.<br>
Reference Example 1<br>
Dry sodium thiomethoxide (0.385g, 0.0055M) was added to a solution of methyl 2-chloro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoate (1.19g, 0.005M) in anhydrous N-methylpyrrolidinone (10ml) at 5Â°C. After 3 hours the<br>
mixture was acidified, extracted (ether), washed (water) and evaporated to give methyl 2-methylthio-4-trifluoromethylbenzoate (1.18g, 94% yield), 'H NMR2.44(s,3H), 3.89(s,3H), 7.33(1H), 7.41(1H), 8.02(1H).<br><br><br><br><br>
