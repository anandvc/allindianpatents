				<td>DEW POINT HUMIDIFIER AND RELATED GAS TEMPERATURE CONTROL<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of continuous flow gas<br>
humidification systems, and, more particularly, to a method and a system for<br>
humidifying gas reactants for fuel cells or other gases. It also relates to the field of<br>
temperature control and tracing of the humidified gas.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
As described in U.S. Patent No. 6,338,472 to Shimazu etal., humidifiers, like<br>
those of the field of the present invention, are typically used to humidify process<br>
gases supplied to an anode or a cathode of a Solid Polymer Fuel Cell (SPFC). The<br>
process gases comprise a fuel gas provided to the anode and an oxidizing gas<br>
provided to the cathode. A solid polymer fuel cell generates electrical energy by<br>
electrochemical reactions in which protons generated from a fuel supplied to the<br>
anode transfer to the cathode through an electrolyte membrane and react with an<br>
oxidizing gas supplied to the cathode to produce water. The humidifier of the present<br>
invention, however, is not limited to fuel cells, but is generally applicable to the<br>
humidification of gases.<br>
Similarly, a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC), in contrast to<br>
the SPFC device, generally consists of three main components: (1) a porous diffusion<br>
catalytic anode, (2) a proton conductive membrane, and (3) a porous diffusion<br>
catalytic cathode The PEMFC converts chemical energy to electrical energy with<br>
catalytic electrochemical reactions of hydrogen and oxygen at the anode and cathode,<br>
respectively. During the process, the conductivity of the proton exchange membrane<br>
plays an important role in the performance of the PEMFC. The membrane<br>
conductivity, however, depends on its water content. Usually, high water content<br>
gives high conductivity. In fact, fuel and oxidant gases must be humidified to<br>
maintain adequate water content in the membrane, therefore requiring a humidifier<br>
and a method of humidifying reactant gases.<br>
To operate a fuel cell normally, whether a SPFC or a PEMFC, the membrane<br>
must be kept wet. To keep the membrane wet, the process gases are typically<br>
humidified by one or more of a variety of techniques. For example, one commonly<br>
used technique, referred to herein as a "bubbling-type" humidifier, involves bubbling<br>
reactant gases up through a container of heated water so that water molecules are<br>
taken up with the reactant gases. An energy source is provided to facilitate the water<br>
evaporation into the gas bubbles or gas stream through the container.<br>
In order to make gases highly humidified, the flow rate of gases should be low<br>
enough, or the residence time in water should be long enough. Also, the distribution<br>
of gases in the liquid water has a large influence on the final humidity of gases. A<br>
bubbling-type humidifier should also avoid leaving water droplets to be carried out by<br>
the gas stream, even when flow rate is relatively low because there is no typically gaswater<br>
separation function in such a humidifier. This method of humidification has the<br>
advantage of being very simple and inexpensive. However, typical bubbling-type<br>
humidifiers cannot deliver 100% relative humidity to gases and only allow relatively<br>
low gas flow rate for a certain cross area of humidifier. Another disadvantage of this<br>
method is its uncertainty as to just how much humidity has been imparted to gases as<br>
the gases leave the outlet of the humidifier. Many factors, including water<br>
temperature, flow rate, gas distribution, inlet gas temperature and humidity, physical<br>
structure and condition of the humidifier, affect humidity at outlet.<br>
In bubbling-type humidifiers, it is difficult to control humidity unless using a<br>
feedback signal developed from the measurement of actual humidity value at the<br>
humidifier outlet. Even with such controls, the bubbling-type humidifier requires a<br>
relatively large cross section area and water height to humidify the gas and the<br>
response time for change of humidity is very long.<br>
In another conventional method, referred to herein as "steam injection or<br>
steam mixing", water vapor steam is injected, usually in an excess amount, into a dry<br>
gas stream to form a gas-vapor-water droplet mixture. The mixture then flows<br>
through a heat exchanger to condense down to a set temperature by a chilling coolant.<br>
Water droplets and extra water vapor in the mixture condense to a water stream,<br>
which is further separated from the gas-vapor stream by a water separator and a water<br>
drain. Because there is a condensation process, the set temperature is equal to the<br>
Dew Point Temperature. In order to have a condensation procedure, extra water<br>
vapor steam must be used. In this technology, a separate boiler, condenser, chiller,<br>
water drain and their own individual control systems are usually needed. In order to<br>
maintain good control of the dew point temperature, these types of humidifiers are<br>
usually bulky, complicated, and expensive with very low energy efficiency.<br>
Another known technique for humidifying reactant gases uses a "membranetype"<br>
humidifier. One example of a membrane-type humidifier is shown and<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,996,976 to Murphy etal. In this technique, water is<br>
pumped through a heating element and then directed to one side of a porous<br>
membrane. The gases to be humidified are directed across the other side of the<br>
membrane. Water molecules penetrate the membrane from the heated water side to<br>
the reactant gas side where the water molecules evaporate into the gases and the gases<br>
absorb heat from the water. The water may be circulated through a heating chamber<br>
as described, or the water may be heated directly in an evaporation chamber. The<br>
temperature of the gas-vapor mixture is lower than the temperature of the water<br>
because evaporation occurs at the surface of the membrane. Because of this<br>
phenomenon, the temperature and humidity of the gas-vapor mixture is rather difficult<br>
to control Further, the difficulty of control increases as the rate of gas flow increases<br>
because the amount of heat absorbed from the water is relatively high. Further, a<br>
specialized membrane is required, increasing the overall cost of such a system.<br>
Again, there is no mechanism to guarantee precise humidity control without further<br>
condensation or employment of a humidity sensor.<br>
U. S. Pat. No 5,262,250 to Watanabe and U. S. Pat. No. 5,952,119 to Wilson<br>
teach a kind of self-humidification method for membrane electrode assemblies of fuel<br>
cells. The former uses some narrow path or wicks within a membrane and the latter<br>
sews hydrophilic thread through a backing layer to enhance the humidification of the<br>
membrane. However effective such self-humidification may be in a laboratory<br>
environment, it is difficult for commercial manufacturing in a large scale.<br>
Yet another technique for the humidification of a gas involves the application<br>
of ultrasonic energy to the gas and a water bath. A quantity of water is contained<br>
within an enclosure and gas is introduced to the volume within the enclosure above<br>
the surface of the water. An ultrasonic energy source within the enclosure extends<br>
through the gas volume into the water bath. Application of ultrasonic energy<br>
generates water vapor, which is taken up by the gas and the gas-vapor mixture is<br>
withdrawn from the enclosure. This technique has the advantage of easily<br>
controllable humidity of the gas-vapor mixture for "batch" processing of gas, but is<br>
not suitable to generate and control the humidity of a continuous stream of gas.<br>
Still another technique for humidification of a gas involves a variation of the<br>
steam-injection-type humidifier, wherein water is injected onto a hot element, such as<br>
a plate, to evaporate the water into an enclosure. Gas is pumped into the enclosure to<br>
mix with the water vapor to develop a gas-vapor mixture. The amount of water that is<br>
injected onto the heating element is calculated and controlled to meet certain humidity<br>
requirements. Further, the temperature of the exit gas-vapor mixture is controlled by<br>
controlling the temperature of the heating element.<br>
However, this factor presents a drawback of this technique in that the heating<br>
component must use a certain minimum power to reach a temperature sufficiently<br>
high to flash the water to vapor instantly and this minimum temperature is usually<br>
much higher than the preferred mixture temperature. Also, it is difficult to quickly<br>
change the temperature of the heating element when the flow rate of gas or water<br>
changes and it is difficult to precisely control the temperature of the gas-vapor<br>
mixture, thus the mixture is likely to be overheated. Even if the mixture temperature<br>
can be adequately controlled, the range of flow rate and the range of temperature is<br>
unacceptably limited using this technique. This is because this technique requires the<br>
simultaneous control of two parameters, i.e. the temperature of the gas-vapor mixture<br>
and the temperature of the heating element, in one control loop by one means, i.e. the<br>
power to the heating element. It is difficult, if not impossible, to simultaneously<br>
control these parameters in a realistic control mechanism.<br>
One proposed solution to this control problem involves the use of a condenser<br>
in the stream for the gas-vapor mixture. In principle, the humidification is carried out<br>
in two steps and two devices. The first step involves steam injection as previously<br>
described to generate an over-heated, over-humidified gas-vapor mixture. The second<br>
step involves passing the mixture through the condenser to condense the gas-vapor<br>
mixture at its dew point. A chiller is required to carry away the heat released from the<br>
condensation to maintain the condenser at the dew point. Thus, additional energy is<br>
needed to generate the over-heated and over-humidified mixture in the first step, and<br>
even more energy is required to drive the chiller to dissipate the additional heat from<br>
the cooling and condensation of the mixture. This means that this technique is very<br>
energy inefficient, and it is also bulky, complicated, and expensive to build and use.<br>
Another humidification method for PEMFC is taught in U. S. Pat. No.<br>
6,383,671 to Andrews. This method uses a heater to vaporize liquid water and then<br>
lets the steam directly mix with dry gases. Effective humidification may obtained for<br>
the reactant gases under certain conditions. However, one of problems with this<br>
apparatus is that the reactant gases are not pre-heated; that is, the temperature and<br>
humidity of gases are far from saturation status of dew point. When vapor mixes with<br>
these cool gases, condensation occurs This phenomenon makes the precise control of<br>
humidity difficult because the gases and steam vapor are not mixed evenly. In order<br>
to mix the gases and vapor well, the practical size of this humidifier must be quite<br>
large.<br>
Thus, there remains a need for a system and a method of humidifying gases<br>
that is energy efficient, simple, and easy to control, and more importantly, provides<br>
precisely a desired amount of humidification of a continuous gas stream. The present<br>
invention is directed to such a solution.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention addresses these and other drawbacks in the art by<br>
providing a continuous flow of gas through two stages. The first stage provides prehumidification<br>
of reactant gases with a bubbling action, while the second stage<br>
provides generating vapor steam in a steam generator and mixing the pre-humidified<br>
gases with the vapor steam in a mixing chamber. No permeable membrane is used,<br>
and only a single parameter (temperature) is used for precise control of the<br>
humidification of the gas at the dew point. That is, the temperature at the outlet is<br>
used as the sole parameter to control the operation of the heating element in the steam<br>
generator<br>
Gas is introduced into an enclosure or vessel under pressure. The gas then<br>
bubbles up through a bubbling evaporator. Above the water bubbling evaporator, the<br>
gas-vapor-water droplets mixture mixes with injected water vapor steam to form<br>
saturated gas-vapor-water droplets mixture. The saturated gas-vapor-water droplets<br>
mixture then flows through a moisture separation region having "Y"-shaped cross<br>
section Water droplets fall by gravity and inertia to bulk water while saturated gas<br>
flows up and exits from the humidifier.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a gas humidifier that is<br>
simple and easy to control to precisely produce saturated gas at the dew point. It is a<br>
further object of the invention to provide a method of humidifying gas with such a<br>
humidifier. It is yet another object of the invention to provide a gas humidifier that<br>
produces saturated gas at the dew point over a wide range of temperatures using a<br>
single measured parameter (temperature) within the enclosure without dew point<br>
"calibration" It is another object of the invention to provide simple, economic, and<br>
effective means to further heat and trace the gas temperature after humidification.<br>
In order to realize these and other features and advantages of the invention,<br>
enhanced thermal insulation is provided between the steam generating boiler and bulk<br>
water within the vessel and/or the pre-humidifier. The thermal insulation prevents<br>
direct heating of bulk water or pre-humidified gas by heat from the boiler. Thus,<br>
thermal energy from a heating element with the steam generating boiler is contained<br>
with the boiler to only generate vapor. Heat is therefore passed to the gases only<br>
through gas-vapor mixing and/or vapor condensing.<br>
Although the boiler is thermally isolated from other functions of the gas<br>
humidifier, openings at the bottom of the boiler are provided so that bulk water from<br>
the vessel flows back into boiler. This arrangement eliminates the necessity of a<br>
separate water supply and recycling system and further provides water leveling for the<br>
pre-humidifier, the condenser/water separator and the boiler. On the other hand,<br>
because water flows from the bulk water in the vessel into the bottom of the boiler,<br>
the water path does not cause convection of heat from the boiler to the pre-humidifier<br>
or the bulk water.<br>
Thermal efficiency of the humidifier is also improved by enhanced thermal<br>
insulation applied to the mixer/condenser wall to prevent heat transfer to the gas<br>
stream at 100% relative humidity along the path to the outlet of the humidifier. This<br>
feature ensures the gas stream remains at 100% relative humidity. The thermal<br>
insulation of the boiler and the mixer/condenser eliminates the need to pass the<br>
humidified gas through an additional humidification stage.<br>
As previously described, the outlet of the mixing chamber and condenser<br>
defines a "Y11 shape in cross section. The bulk water level within the vessel is<br>
maintained lower than this outlet. This keeps the gas-vapor mixture from flowing<br>
through the bulk water and causing bubbling, which would limit the maximum flow<br>
rate of gas through the humidifier. This arrangement increases maximum flow rate<br>
for the same cross sectional area by more than 10 times without this feature.<br>
From the mixing chamber, the gas vapor mixture makes a number of distinct<br>
changes in direction before reaching the outlet of the vapor. This circuitous route for<br>
the gas vapor mixture causes water droplets to fall back into the bulk water, while<br>
maintaining saturated gas out the outlet of the humidifier. This also means that it is<br>
not necessary to use the bulk water or a separate water separator and drain for water<br>
separation.<br>
A temperature sensor for (dew point) temperature measurement and control is<br>
mounted in an outlet chamber of the humidifier, and not in the bulk water. This<br>
measurement point reflects the gas-vapor mixture temperature more accurately than in<br>
water.<br>
The mixing chamber also serves as a condenser. Thus, it is not necessary to<br>
use bulk water for condensation. Relatively cold, pre-humidified gas cools down the<br>
water steam while mixing with it. This cooling process condenses some of the steam<br>
in the mixture Condensed water and the heat it carries with it will be used for prehumidification<br>
and steam generation. This condensation recycles water and heat for<br>
natural, automatic heat and water balancing.<br>
In a presently preferred embodiment of the invention, the same coolant (such<br>
as, for example, city water or chill water) is used for temperature regulation in the<br>
humidifier, the gas heater, the gas line and the humidity sensor assembly. This<br>
feature simplifies the control system and makes temperature control smooth and<br>
stable. When city water is used, it eliminates a complicated, separate cooling,<br>
heating, and circulating systems for each of those functions.<br>
These and other features and advantages of this invention will be readily<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art from a review of the following detailed description<br>
along with accompany drawing figures.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 show the core structure of a humidifier 10 and a method humidifying<br>
gas, in accordance with the present invention. The humidifier 10 principally<br>
comprises a vessel 12, preferably cylindrical in aspect, with a top 14 and a bottom 16.<br>
An inlet line 18 introduces dry gas into the vessel 12, and an outlet 20 directs<br>
humidified gas from the vessel. Dry gas is shown entering the vessel by an arrow 22<br>
and humidified gas is shown exiting the vessel by an arrow 24.<br>
The dry gas 22, which is at a lower temperature than set dew point<br>
temperature, is initially humidified by flowing through pre-humidifier 26. The dry<br>
gas 22 bubbles up through the pre-humidifier 26 forming bubbles 28, which rise up<br>
through the pre-humidifier, thereby picking up some moisture and being warmed to a<br>
higher temperature by the water in the pre-humidifier column. The pre-humidifier 26<br>
defines an elongated container, such as a tube, with openings 30, preferably along the<br>
bottom of the tube inside the vessel. The openings 30 provide a water path to a boiler<br>
32, which is also preferably an elongated container, such as a tube, adjacent to the<br>
pre-humidifier 26 The openings 30 further provide a water flow path to a reservoir<br>
34 of bulk demineralized water retained with the vessel. A water inlet 38 provides<br>
makeup water to make up for water released from the vessel in humidified gas, as<br>
controlled by a control valve 39.<br>
The pre-humidifier 26 defines an open top outlet 40, preferably above a water<br>
level 42 of the bulk demineralized water. The gas bubbles 28 rise up through the prehumidifier,<br>
and when gas flow rate is very slow, the pre-humidifier functions in the<br>
manner of a conventional bubbling humidifier. However, when gas flow rate is high,<br>
a large volume of gas mixes with small amount of water and this action develops a<br>
foam-like mixture, the mixture includes a humidified gas. The foam-like mixture<br>
rises out of the outlet 40 of the pre-humidifier, carrying a substantial quantity of<br>
water, and into a mixing chamber 44. The mixing chamber 44 is defined by a<br>
cylindrical thermal insulator 46 having a cylindrical, vertically oriented side member<br>
48 and a horizontally oriented top 50. The side member need not be cylindrical, but<br>
may take other shapes, so long as it defines an open bottom container with a bottom<br>
edge 49 above the water level and below the tops of the pre-humidifier and the boiler.<br>
The mixing chamber wall is thermally insulated so that a 100% relative humidity gasvapor<br>
mixture flows up through an annulus 62 between the mixing chamber and the<br>
inside surface of the vessel 12 will not be heated up.<br>
At this point, it should be noted that the pre-humidifier functions in a<br>
substantially different manner than a conventional bubbling humidifier. In a bubbling<br>
humidifier, only water vapor with no water droplets should get out from the water<br>
retained within the bubbling humidifier. The flow rate through a bubbling humidifier<br>
is hence very limited. However, the pre-humidifier of the present invention can pass a<br>
gas stream of very high flow rate, in fact more than ten times higher than that of a<br>
conventional bubbling humidifier with same cross section.<br>
Returning to Figure 1, positioned within the boiler 32 is a heater element 52<br>
Preferably, the heater element is a resistive element, although other heating means<br>
may be used within the spirit of the invention. The heater element terminates a top<br>
end 54, which is positioned below the water level 42. The heater element generates<br>
water vapor steam in the boiler , which is enclosed within a thermal-insulated wall 56.<br>
Water vapor steam rises from the boiler and out an open top 58 into the mixing<br>
chamber 44. Just as with the pre-humidifier, the boiler 32 includes openings 31 along<br>
the inside surface of the bottom 16 for the flow of bulk water from the vessel into the<br>
bottom of the boiler Bulk water also flows into the bottom of the pre-humidifier<br>
through the openings 31.<br>
Water vapor steam is released from the boiler 32 into the mixing chamber 44,<br>
which also serves as a condenser to condense steam into droplets which fall back into<br>
the bulk water. The steam released from the open top or outlet of the boiler flows<br>
naturally and freely, without obstruction. The boiling temperature within the boiler is<br>
typically much higher than the set dew point temperature in the present invention.<br>
However, pre-humidified gas exiting the pre-humidifier 26 is typically cooler than the<br>
dew point temperature. Thus, pre-hurnidified gas from the pre-humidifier, which is<br>
cooler than the dew point, mixes with steam from boiler, which is typically hotter than<br>
the dew point<br>
Under normal operating conditions, water steam mixes with the prehumidified<br>
gas and heats it. In doing so, the water steam releases thermal energy,<br>
thereby cooling down to the point that it condenses in the mixing chamber and<br>
condenser. As long as there is a condensing process, the mixture in the mixing<br>
chamber by definition is saturated. The mixing procedure generates 100% relative<br>
humidity gas-vapor mixture in the mixing chamber at a predetermined dew point<br>
temperature or higher The mixing procedure also generates condensed water droplets<br>
60 at a temperature around the dew point temperature. The water droplets carry heat<br>
from condensation process to the pre-humidifier.<br>
The mixture of water droplets, water steam, and pre-humidified gas flows<br>
down between the outside of the tube forming the pre-humidifier and the side member<br>
48 of the mixing chamber 44. A water separator or moisture separation region 61 is<br>
defined at the bottom edge of the side member 48. In cross section, the water<br>
separator 61 resembles a "Y" shape. In that way, the moisture separation region has a<br>
downward gas-water mixture path, an upward gas path, and a water collector below<br>
the bottom edge. As the steam/gas mixture flows downward out the bottom of the<br>
mixing chamber, gravity and inertia force the condensed water droplets to continue<br>
down to flow into the bulk water. Saturated steam, however, flows down under the<br>
bottom edge of the side member 48, continuing to flow in the annulus 62 between the<br>
outside surface of the side member 48 and the inside surface of the vessel. This flow<br>
action effectively separates the heavier water droplets from the saturated steam. It<br>
also retains the energy contained in the water droplets and this energy is returned to<br>
the bulk water. The gas, now saturated with water, flows up through the annulus 62<br>
and into an exit chamber 64, above the top surface of the horizontally oriented top 50.<br>
The saturated gas then exits the vessel at the gas outlet 20.<br>
Note that the gas and vapor mixture makes six distinct changes of direction<br>
from the mixing chamber to the outlet 20. It moves (1) horizontally outward, then<br>
(2) downward, then (3) horizontally outwardly again, then (4) vertically upward, then<br>
(5) horizontally inward, and finally (6) vertically upward out the outlet. This<br>
circuitous route eliminates the water droplets from the gas and vapor mixture,<br>
ensuring a saturated gas at the outlet.<br>
The water level 42 is lower than the outlet of mixing chamber 44. This<br>
structure prevents the gas-vapor mixture from flowing through water. Water level is<br>
maintained by a water level sensor and a water pump (not shown). If the gas-vapor<br>
mixture were to flow through water, the turbulent action could potentially create a<br>
foaming action, thereby carrying water droplets up to the outlet of the humidifier,<br>
severely limiting the maximum gas flow rate. Thus, placing the outlet of the mixing<br>
chamber above the bulk water level increases the maximum flow rate of gas through<br>
the humidifier by a factor often, over a bubbling-type humidifier of the same cross<br>
sectional area<br>
A temperature sensor 70 is mounted on the top of the vessel, penetrating into<br>
the outlet chamber 64. In this way, the precise temperature of the saturated gas is<br>
measured by the sensor 70 The sensor 70 provides a temperature measurement to a<br>
temperature controller 72, which controls the cycling of the heater element 52 in the<br>
boiler. This function controls the temperature of gas-vapor mixture at the gas outlet<br>
20 to be at the desired dew point temperature by adjusting the thermal energy<br>
provided by the boiler 32. Because the gas-vapor mixture is at 100% relative<br>
humidity, the temperature at the outlet 20 is at true dew point temperature. Dew point<br>
temperature is hence accurately controlled by controlling this gas outlet temperature.<br>
To further assist in temperature regulation, a jacket 80 may be mounted on the outer<br>
surface of the vessel to circulate chilled or ambient temperature water, fed from a chill<br>
water inlet 79 and emptying into a chill water outlet 81. This feature of the invention<br>
is described in greater detail in respect of Figure 3.<br>
As previously described, water and heat from condensation in the mixing<br>
chamber go back to the bulk water 34 to be used for pre-humidification and steam<br>
generation. The pre-humidification process not only functions to partially humidify<br>
dry gas, it also uses, or recycles, this water and heat from condensation. Prehumidification<br>
keeps the temperature of the bulk water at a lower temperature than<br>
the selected dew point temperature. Lower water temperature guarantees prehumidified<br>
gas at a lower temperature than dew point temperature. The mixing of gas<br>
at lower temperature with vapor steam at higher temperature will bring the vapor<br>
temperature down and cause condensation, guarantying 100% relative humidity for<br>
the humidified gas. This pre-humidification procedure, which consumes water and<br>
heat, keeps water and heat balanced, thereby conserving demineralized water and<br>
heat. This feature substantially enhances the efficiency of the invention and<br>
simplifies temperature humidity control.<br>
An alternative embodiment of the present invention is shown in Figure 2. In<br>
this embodiment, a boiler 90 is mounted as a separate component outside of a<br>
humidifier vessel 92. The vessel encloses a pre-humidifier 94, constructed as<br>
previously described in respect of Figure 1. Dry gas enters at a gas inlet 96 and<br>
humidified gas exits the vessel at a gas outlet 98. A water path 100 from the prehumidifier<br>
94 or bulk water within the vessel is provided so that water can be supplied<br>
to the boiler naturally from the vessel, thereby maintaining a water level 102 in the<br>
vessel 92, the pre-humidifier 94, and the boiler 90. The water path 100 eliminates the<br>
need for a separate water level sensor and a water supply and recycling device. With<br>
this water path, the boiler may be considered to be integrated with humidifier for<br>
purposes of water level control, gas humidification, and temperature control Water<br>
in the vessel and in the boiler are thus maintained at a level 105, and both may be<br>
drained through a drain 107. A heater element 104 develops vapor steam, which is<br>
introduced into the vessel through a steam injection line 106. The steam injection line<br>
penetrates into a mixing chamber 108 which is constructed and functions as<br>
previously described. The mixing chamber also serves as a condenser, and<br>
condensation from the mixing chamber is returned to the bulk water as before. The<br>
humidifier also may include a chill water jacket 110, fed from a chill water inlet 109<br>
and emptying into a chill water outlet 111, as previously described.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates another presently preferred embodiment of a humidifier of<br>
this invention. This embodiment provides a simple, efficient integration of the<br>
various components for humidification, gas heating, temperature tracing, and<br>
humidity sensing together, using the same coolant.<br>
The vessel 12, pre-humidifier 26, boiler 32, the mixing chamber 44, and other<br>
various components are constructed as previously described in respect of Figure 1. In<br>
this embodiment, however, chill water is provided at an inlet 120 flows into the jacket<br>
(see also Figure 1) for temperature regulation and fast dew point decreasing. Instead<br>
of chill water, regular city tap water may be used for circulating chill water because it<br>
never comes in contact with the gas and vapor of the humidifier. The chill water<br>
flows upward through the jacket 80, until it reaches a chill water outlet 122 at the top<br>
of the vessel. At this point, the chill water has been heated to about dew point<br>
temperature, having received thermal energy from the outside surface of the vessel.<br>
The cooling effect of chill water makes the temperature control of boiler easier and<br>
smoother.<br>
The heated circulating chill water then goes from the humidifier into a gas<br>
heater jacket 124, which surrounds and encloses a substantially horizontal gas heater<br>
126. The gas heater 126 includes a heater element 128 positioned therein. The<br>
circulating chill water further heated in the gas heater jacket 124. The chill water then<br>
passes into a connecting line 130 and into a water jacket 132 for a humidity sensor<br>
134. It then flows into a gas outlet jacket 136. The gas outlet jacket 136 discharges<br>
into a chill water discharge line 138, through a back pressure controller 140 and out a<br>
chill water outlet 142<br>
The gas heater 126 heats up the gas-vapor mixture from the outlet 20 of the<br>
humidifier to approximately the set gas temperature. Because the circulating chill<br>
water is preheated in the jacket 80 to temperature close to dew point, it does not need<br>
to be preheated before meeting 100% humidified gas in the gas heater to prevent<br>
condensation The water in the gas heater jacket 124 makes temperature control<br>
smooth and stable It enables fast temperature change, both up and down, without<br>
significant overshoot<br>
The circulating chill water, which is further heated in gas heater jacket 124, is<br>
used for temperature tracing along a gas line or conduit 144. Thus, the gas line or<br>
conduit defines a jacketed tubing for gas transportation and gas temperature tracing<br>
along the gas line Gas temperature in the gas line 144 may measured at a gas outlet<br>
148 from the gas line 144 with a gas temperature sensor 146. The sensor 146<br>
provides a temperature signal to a heater temperature controller 150 to control the<br>
cycling of the heater element 128. The use of the heated circulating chill water<br>
enables the temperature to be maintained at desired temperature at the outlet 148 from<br>
the gas line 144 and to be maintained at temperature close to this temperature along<br>
the gas line This heated water enables uniform temperature control and smooth<br>
temperature transaction without significant overshoot.<br>
The circulating chill water at the end of line can also be used for temperature<br>
control of humidity sensor jacket 132. It is important to have the temperature of<br>
humidity sensor to be kept close to gas temperature. Without this heated water, it is<br>
complicated and expensive to use a heater unit for the humidity sensor assembly, such<br>
as heat tape, to accomplish this function. Instead of using separate temperature<br>
control loops for gas heating, temperature tracing, and humidity sensor jacket heating,<br>
which will need separate temperature control systems, this method needs no extra<br>
heaters and controllers but only one heating loop for these functions. It eliminates<br>
extra systems, which include heating, cooling, circulating and control units.<br>
Typically, a humidity sensor requires the condition of limited flow rate,<br>
usually less than 0.2 slpm (standard flow, standard liters per minute). Under<br>
conditions of high flow rate, a sampling mechanism is usually applied to a humidity<br>
sensing unit, which makes it complicated and expensive. The present invention,<br>
however, makes the humidity sensor 134 work properly for a high flow rate gas<br>
stream. A check valve 152 is installed in the main gas line and in parallel with a<br>
humidity sensor assembly 154. The check valve keeps pressure drop across the<br>
humidity sensor assembly lower than a preset value and hence controls the flow rate<br>
through the humidity sensor assembly lower than the pre-set value. When the flow<br>
rate of humidified gas through the line 144 is lower than this preset value, all gas<br>
flows through the humidity sensor assembly.<br>
Operation of the Gas Humidifier<br>
The thermodynamic operation of the humidifier starts with dry gas at or lower<br>
than ambient temperature and results in saturated gas at the dew point temperature at<br>
the outlet of the humidifier. In a first step, the gas travels through the pre-humidifier,<br>
an un-insulated pipe, absorbing heat from the bulk water and cooling the bulk water<br>
by the same amount of energy. In a second step, gas from the pre-humidifier mixes<br>
with steam from the boiler and forms a saturated gas-vapor-water droplets mixture<br>
and condenses. In a third step, the mixture flows through the "Y"-shaped water<br>
separator, where a saturated gas-vapor mixture flows up to the outlet. Water droplets<br>
carry heat from condensation down to the bulk water, thereby providing heat-water<br>
recycling and heat-water balancing.<br>
The operation of the heating element in the boiler is controlled by the<br>
temperature of the gas-vapor mixture at the outlet of the humidifier as determined by<br>
a temperature sensor in order to maintain the dew point and maintain thermal balance<br>
within the apparatus. Using the structure of the present invention, a separate<br>
condenser and chiller is therefore eliminated, and the heat from the condensing gasvapor<br>
mixture is released directly into the bulk water, thus conserving the energy that<br>
is lost in prior art systems using a separate condenser and chiller.<br>
Thus, the heat balance of the apparatus is given by the following equation.<br>
Total heat needed to generate 100% = Total heat from steam generator - heat<br>
humidified gas at the dew point from loss to environment - heat to chill<br>
inlet gas and water water<br>
This means that by controlling one simple parameter, the power of the heating<br>
element, the temperature of the gas-vapor mixture at the outlet of the humidifier is<br>
assured of being at the desired dew point. The precise humidification of the gas<br>
stream is assured for a continuous gas stream, regardless of the flow rate of the gas.<br>
In known humidification systems, the level of humidification of the gas stream varies<br>
with the flow rate and other parameters of the system before entering a separate<br>
condenser, and this drawback in the art is eliminated by the present invention.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the temperature of the humidified gas is<br>
further controlled by the operation of the gas stream heater, which is cycled by a<br>
control signal based on the temperature of the gas at the gas outlet. Chill water is<br>
circulated through the apparatus to provide stable operation of the humidification<br>
system.<br>
The principles, preferred embodiment, and mode of operation of the present<br>
invention have been described in the foregoing specification. This invention is not to<br>
be construed as limited to the particular forms disclosed, since these are regarded as<br>
illustrative rather than restrictive. The invention should not be limited to water as<br>
coolant either. Moreover, variations and changes may be made by those skilled in the<br>
art without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br><br><br>
