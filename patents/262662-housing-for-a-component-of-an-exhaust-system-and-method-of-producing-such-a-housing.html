Housing for a Component of an Exhaust System and Method of Producing Such<br>
a Housing<br>
The invention relates to a housing for a component of an exhaust system, in<br>
particular for an exhaust gas purification device. The invention also relates to a<br>
method of producing a housing for a component of an exhaust system.<br>
The component can be in particular a diesel particulate filter or a catalyst.<br>
These are mounted within the housing along with a support mat. Most recently, a<br>
manufacturing method which is generally called "calibration" has often been used<br>
therefor. In this method, the housing is provided so as to have an envelope which<br>
is closed in the circumferential direction. The component is then pushed into the<br>
envelope along with the support mat, and the envelope is then upset in the radial<br>
direction until the component, along with the support mat, is retained within the<br>
housing with the desired pressure. This method is also known as "shrinking<br>
process". In modern shrinking methods, each envelope is shrunk individually, that<br>
means that the individual dimensions of the component and of the support mat<br>
are taken into account. This results in the diameter of the shrunk housing varying<br>
within determined limits.<br>
To permit the coupling of the housing, along with the component inserted<br>
therein, to an exhaust system, an inlet cone and an outlet cone are usually<br>
mounted upstream and downstream of the housing. Since these are always<br>
made available with the same diameter, it is provided in modern shrinking<br>
methods to calibrate the axial ends of the housing for the component after the<br>
shrinking step such that independently of the individual shrinking, the housing<br>
has always the same diameter at least at its axial ends. This method is generally<br>
costly.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a housing for a component of an<br>
exhaust system which permits the coupling of an inlet cone or of an outlet cone<br>
with low effort. The object of the invention also consists in providing a method for<br>
a simplified manufacturing of such a housing.<br><br>
-2-<br>
For this purpose, provision is made according to the invention for a housing<br>
for a component of an exhaust system, in particular for an exhaust gas<br>
purification device, the housing having an envelope which comprises a shrunk<br>
clamping portion for the component, and a transition portion which adjoins the<br>
clamping portion in the axial direction, and a connecting portion which adjoins the<br>
transition portion in the axial direction and the diameter of which is larger than<br>
that of the clamping portion. The following steps are provided in the method<br>
according to the invention: A tubular envelope is at first provided The<br>
component, along with the support mat, is then inserted into the envelope. The<br>
envelope is then shrunk in a clamping portion which terminates spaced apart<br>
from the ends of the envelope, as viewed in the axial direction, whereas the axial<br>
ends of the envelope are not acted upon. The invention is based on the<br>
surprising finding that if the envelope is shrunk only in a central region and a<br>
short portion at the axial ends of the envelope remains unworked, the diameter<br>
and also the angle of these unworked portions depend only to a very low degree<br>
on the diameter of the shrunk central region. In other words: An approximately<br>
truncated connecting portion is always produced at the axial ends of the envelope<br>
independently of the diameter to which the central region is shrunk, the diameter<br>
and the angular orientation of this connecting portion varying only to a small<br>
extent such that it is suitable for the coupling of the inlet cone or of the outlet<br>
cone without further working steps.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment of the invention, the envelope<br>
terminates approximately flush with the component in the axial direction when the<br>
latter is received within the housing. This constitutes a particular advantage of the<br>
method according to the invention and of the housing according to the invention,<br>
since it is possible to configure the envelope shorter than in the prior art. In the<br>
prior art, the envelope must project beyond the component in the axial direction,<br>
since otherwise, the calibration of the axial ends of the envelope is impossible<br>
The invention however takes the finding into account that the diameter of the<br>
envelope increases at the axial ends when the clamping portion is shrunk, so that<br>
enough space is available for receiving the inlet cone or the outlet cone. This is<br>
surprising in so far as the change in the diameter at the axial end of the envelope<br>
is exactly opposite to that of the diameter of the clamping portion.<br><br>
-3-<br>
The invention is described below with reference to one embodiment which is<br>
illustrated in the enclosed drawings, in which:<br>
-	Figure 1 shows a schematic section of the housing according to the<br>
invention;<br>
-	Figure 2 shows the detail II of Figure 1 on an enlarged scale; and<br>
-	Figure 3 shows schematically the shape of the envelope before and after<br>
the shrinking process.<br>
Figure 1 shows a housing 10 which consists of an envelope 12 and of two<br>
coupling parts 14, only one of them being shown in the present case. The<br>
coupling parts are an inlet cone or an outlet cone by means of which the housing<br>
may be coupled to an exhaust system of a combustion engine. A component 16<br>
of the exhaust system, in particular a diesel particulate filter or a catalyst, is<br>
arranged within the housing 12. The component 16 is surrounded by a support<br>
mat 18.<br>
In the initial state, i.e. before the mounting of the component 16, the envelope<br>
12 has a diameter DA (cf. Figure 3). The envelope need not necessarily have a<br>
circular cross-section but may have an oval, a tri-oval or other cross-section. In<br>
the initial state, a length L of the envelope 12 projects beyond a clamping portion<br>
20 in which a shrinking tool 22 engages the envelope and upsets the latter in the<br>
radial direction, as can also be seen in Figure 3. As a result of the upsetting of<br>
the envelope in the region of the clamping portion, the diameter at this location is<br>
reduced to the end diameter DE (cf. Figure 3 again) so that the component 16 is<br>
firmly retained within the envelope along with the support mat 18 During the<br>
upsetting or shrinking step, the region of the envelope, which projects beyond the<br>
shrinking tool 22 in the axial direction is deformed in the way shown in Figure 3. A<br>
transition portion 24 which has an arcuate cross-section and in which the<br>
diameter of the envelope is outwardly enlarged adjoins the radially inwardly upset<br>
clamping portion 20, and a connecting portion 26 which is approximately<br>
truncated and has its maximum diameter at the axial end of the envelope 12<br>
adjoins the transition portion 24. The connecting portion 26 has an angle of<br>
inclination a, and the diameter of the envelope at the outer end of the connecting<br>
portion 26 is larger than the initial diameter DA. It must also be noted that the<br><br>
-4-<br>
total length of the envelope increases during the shrinking process since half of<br>
the reduction of the diameter of the envelope results in an increased wall<br>
thickness and the other half in an increased length.<br>
In modern shrinking methods, the end diameter DE is adapted to the<br>
respective diameter of the component 16. It is however remarkable that changes<br>
in the end diameter DE leads only to a negligible degree to changes in the<br>
diameter of the connecting portion 26 and in the angle a. It was found in tests<br>
that in case of a shrinking for example from an initial diameter of 158.4 mm to a<br>
set diameter of 152.8 mm and of an individual adaptation of the end diameter DE<br>
by ± 1mm in relation to the set diameter, an insignificant change in the diameter<br>
of the connecting portion in the range of ± 0.1 mm could be observed. The length<br>
L by which the envelope projects beyond the shrinking tool 22 in the initial state<br>
varied here between 15 and 24 mm.<br>
Since the diameter and the angle of the connecting portion 26 always remain<br>
almost constant despite changes in the end diameter DE, it is possible to apply a<br>
standard coupling part 14 to each individually shrunk envelope 12. As can be<br>
seen in Figures 1 and 2, this standard coupling part may have, for example, a<br>
conically extending coupling portion 15 which is inserted into the connecting<br>
portion 26. The envelope 12 and the coupling part 14 can then be connected, for<br>
example welded or soldered to each other.<br>
A further advantage which occurs if only part of the length of the envelope 12<br>
is shrunk consists in that the connecting portion 26 is widened in comparison with<br>
the initial diameter so that the coupling part 14 can be inserted into the space<br>
between the component 16 and the envelope 12. As can be clearly seen in<br>
Figures 1 and 2, the coupling part 14 overlaps the component 16. This results in<br>
a housing which is particularly compact in the axial direction. The fact that the<br>
component 16 is freely received within the housing at its axial ends rather than<br>
clamped over its entire length does not impair the clamping between the<br>
envelope 12 and the component 16.<br><br>
