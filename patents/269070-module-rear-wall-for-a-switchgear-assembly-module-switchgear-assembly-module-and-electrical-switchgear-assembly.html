Module rear wall for a switchgear assembly module,<br>
switchgear assembly module and electrical switchgear<br>
assembly<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a module rear wall having a<br>
measuring device for a switchgear assembly module of an<br>
electrical switchgear assembly, in particular a<br>
withdrawable module, having the features of claim 1 and<br>
to a switchgear assembly module having such a module<br>
rear wall and an electrical switchgear assembly, in<br>
particular a medium-voltage or low-voltage switchgear<br>
assembly, having at least one switchgear assembly<br>
module having a module rear wall according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Continuously increasing and often changing demands in<br>
the processing industry and in electrical engineering<br>
bring about the need for the use of medium-voltage and<br>
low-voltage switchgear assemblies which can be<br>
converted and maintained as simply as possible. Current<br>
assemblies in this regard generally have a plurality of<br>
switchgear cabinets which are designed using<br>
withdrawable part technology and are comparatively easy<br>
to fit with components and to configure. Withdrawable<br>
part technology in this context means that all the<br>
electrical operating means and electrical devices, such<br>
as control and/or measuring devices installed as<br>
components, for example, are preferably arranged on<br>
modularized withdrawable parts.<br>
Advantageous here is the simplified accessibility of<br>
the respective withdrawable module by virtue of the<br>
fact that, if required, for example in the event of a<br>
fault or of a failure, but also in the event of the<br>
respective switchgear assembly being reconfigured, this<br>
withdrawable module can be removed easily from the<br><br>
WO 2006/105882	PCT/EP2006/002765<br>
- 2 -<br>
respective switchgear cabinet and replaced by a<br>
suitable module.<br>
Disadvantageously, however, the control and/or<br>
measuring devices installed are in general<br>
conventional, generally available electrical and<br>
electronic components which have not been adapted for<br>
use in withdrawable part technology and which often<br>
require a comparatively large amount of space in the<br>
respective switchgear assembly module owing to their<br>
arrangement and design and cause increased<br>
configurational complexity. In the context of repair<br>
and servicing measures, this then usually also results<br>
in longer maintenance times and downtimes.<br>
Furthermore, the increased amount of space required for<br>
the abovementioned components often necessitates<br>
physical overdimensioning of the actual switchgear<br>
assembly module since, owing to the specific<br>
arrangement and geometry of the individual components<br>
(a module can only be as small as its largest<br>
component), a large proportion of the converted space<br>
is usually unusable.<br>
The object of the invention is to specify, for a given<br>
functionality, a switchgear assembly module having a<br>
measuring device with simplified handling and improved<br>
utilization of space.<br>
This object is achieved by a switchgear assembly having<br>
the features of claim 10, a switchgear assembly module<br>
having the features of claim 9 and a module rear wall<br>
having the features of claim 1.<br>
The electrical switchgear assembly according to the<br>
invention in this case has at least one switchgear<br>
assembly module, in particular a withdrawable module,<br>
having a module rear wall having an integrated<br><br>
WO 2006/105882	PCT/EP2006/002765<br>
- 3 -<br>
measuring device, the module rear wall also being an<br>
integral part of the respective switchgear assembly-<br>
module .<br>
With the aid of the module rear wall according to the<br>
invention, which is matched to the respective size<br>
requirements of the module technology and has an<br>
integrated measuring device, it is now possible to make<br>
best possible use of the space available in the<br>
switchgear assembly module in question. Furthermore,<br>
handling of the respective switchgear assembly module<br>
and therefore of the electrical switchgear assembly is<br>
also improved and simplified by virtue of the fact<br>
that, if required, in the event of a fault and/or in<br>
the event of maintenance or servicing work on the<br>
measuring device, only the module rear wall according<br>
to the invention needs to be replaced, without the<br>
remaining components and internals of the respective<br>
switchgear assembly module being affected. It is<br>
therefore possible to insert the switchgear assembly<br>
module in the electrical switchgear assembly correctly<br>
again as quickly as possible merely by changing the<br>
module rear wall.<br>
The measuring device integrated in the module rear wall<br>
in this case advantageously comprises at least one<br>
outgoing contact having means for integrated measured-<br>
variable detection and/or measured-variable<br>
preprocessing as well as possibly one or more outgoing<br>
contacts without measured-variable detection and/or<br>
measured-variable preprocessing.<br>
Furthermore, the measuring device of the module rear<br>
wall preferably has at least one access contact.<br>
In a further embodiment, the measuring device has at<br>
least one transmission unit for measured data<br>
transmission, it being possible to provide for at least<br><br>
WO 2006/105882	PCT/EP2006/002765<br>
- 4 -<br>
one interface to be provided, by means of which the<br>
detected and/or preprocessed measured data are made<br>
available for callup.<br>
The at least one interface may in this case be, in<br>
particular, an interface which can be read by a<br>
correspondingly set-up data processing device, for<br>
example an RS-232, RS485/RS422 and/or a USB interface.<br>
It is also advantageously possible to provide<br>
conventional power links or bus links for reading or<br>
calling up the detected and/or preprocessed measured<br>
data via a corresponding bus system or control system<br>
and/or via a local or global network, in particular the<br>
Internet, for example for the purpose of a remote<br>
diagnosis. As an alternative to this, interfaces for<br>
wireless information transmission to a corresponding<br>
control system or bus system and/or a data processing<br>
device set up for this purpose, for example by means of<br>
wireless LAN (WLAN) or Bluetooth, can also be provided.<br>
An interface for voltage supply, for example for<br>
supplying the means for integrated measured-variable<br>
detection and/or measured-variable preprocessing, can<br>
likewise be provided, in an alternative configuration<br>
it also being possible for a common interface for data<br>
transmission and voltage supply to be provided.<br>
The invention will be described further with reference<br>
to some figures and exemplary embodiments.<br>
The invention, advantageous configurations and<br>
improvements of the invention and particular advantages<br>
of the invention will be explained and described in<br>
more detail with reference to the exemplary embodiments<br>

module rear wall with the exemplary<br>
configuration shown in figure 1 and having a<br>
measuring device with a rear wall element,<br>
input contacts, a partition, outgoing<br>

Figure 1 shows a module rear wall 10 with an exemplary<br>
configuration and having an integral measuring device<br>
24 for a withdrawable module for an electrical<br>
switchgear assembly, in an exploded illustration.<br>
The module rear wall 10 shown is in this case an<br>
integral part of the respective switchgear assembly<br>
module and contributes to the formation of the module<br>
housing.<br>
The module rear wall 10 comprises a rear wall element<br>
11 in the form of a trough and having a trough base 12<br>
and four side walls 14. The trough base 12, whose outer<br>
side forms the rear side 16 of the module rear wall 10,<br>
in this case has a virtually rectangular to square<br>
cross-sectional area. The trough base 12 of the rear<br>
wall element 11 has a plurality of sockets with cutouts<br>
18 for accommodating and passing through outgoing<br>
contacts 2 0 and/or input contacts 22 of the measuring<br>
device. In the example shown here, in total eight<br>
sockets with cutouts 18 are provided for in each case<br>
four input contacts 22 and four output contacts 20.<br>
The module rear wall 10 as well as the trough-like rear<br>
wall element 11 have, on their side walls 14, means<br>
which allow for the module rear wall 10 to be connected<br>
to the rest of the module housing, for example in the<br>
form of hooks and/or catches 3 0 in order to make it<br>
possible for them to be latched into eyelets or cutouts<br>
in the rest of the module housing, or vice versa. The<br><br>
WO 2006/105882	PCT/EP2006/002765<br>
- 7 -<br>
module housing and the module rear wall 10 in this case<br>
each have complementary connecting means, i.e. ones<br>
which complete one another.<br>
Furthermore, the rear wall element 11 is prepared for<br>
accommodating a multi-pole connection or plug by means<br>
of a corresponding connection element 13b.<br>
The module rear wall 10 comprises an integrated<br>
measuring device, which in this case comprises, for<br>
example, a plurality of components, which are crucially<br>
arranged in the trough interior of the rear wall<br>
element 11. The rear wall element 11 and the components<br>
of the measuring device have connecting elements 23,<br>
25, for example catches or hooks 23 and cutouts 25 and<br>
eyelets which correspond in complementary fashion, in<br>
order to, in the installed state, enter into a<br>
connection with one another that is secured against<br>
becoming detached unintentionally and form, as integral<br>
parts, one unit, the module rear wall 10.<br>
Starting from the trough base inner side of the rear<br>
wall element 11, the measuring device has a plurality<br>
of input contacts 22. Each of the four input contacts<br>
22 shown here has a clamp-like contact end 22a, which<br>
passes through the sockets 18, which are provided for<br>
this purpose, of the trough base 12 of the rear wall<br>
element 11, and a finger-like contact end 22b, which<br>
extends into the trough interior of the rear wall<br>
element 10. This is correspondingly shown in figure 6<br>
in a perspective plan view of the rear wall element 11,<br>
in the viewing direction from the right.<br>
As further components, the measuring device comprises a<br>
plastic partition 40 between the input contacts 22 and<br>
the outgoing contacts 2 0 in order to insulate or shield<br>
them electrically from one another and therefore avoid<br>
the risk of short circuits. The plastic partition 40 is<br><br>
WO 2006/105882	PCT/EP2006/002765<br>
- 8 -<br>
in the form of a hood and almost completely covers at<br>
least the sockets 18 for accommodating the input<br>
contacts 22. Cutouts with integral formations 42 for<br>
passing through and guiding the finger-like contact<br>
ends 22b of the input contacts 22 are provided in the<br>
plastic partition 40. Furthermore, the plastic<br>
partition 40 has cutouts with integral formations 44<br>
for arranging and guiding as well as passing the<br>
outgoing contacts 20 through the sockets 18, which are<br>
provided for this purpose, of the trough base 12 of the<br>
rear wall element 11. This is correspondingly shown in<br>
figure 7 in a perspective plan view of the rear wall<br>
element 11, in the viewing direction from the right.<br>
Each of the four outgoing contacts 20 shown here in<br>
this case also has a clamp-like contact end 20a, which<br>
passes through the sockets 18, which are provided for<br>
this purpose, of the trough base 12 of the rear wall<br>
element 11 and up to the rear side 16 thereof, as well<br>
as a finger-like contact end 20b, which extends into<br>
the wall interior of the rear wall element 11, as can<br>
also be seen from figure 8, in a perspective plan view<br>
of the rear wall element 11 with input contacts 22, a<br>
partition 40 and outgoing contacts 20, in the viewing<br>
direction from the right.<br>
Three of the four outgoing contacts 20 shown<br>
furthermore have means for measured-variable detection<br>
50 and/or measured-variable preprocessing 52, for<br>
example for filtering and/or amplifying but possibly<br>
also for the mean-value generation of the measured data<br>
detected.<br>
A transmission unit 60 for transmitting measured data<br>
and/or information is provided as a further component<br>
of the measuring device, this transmission unit in this<br>
case being in the form of, for example, a transmission<br>
board populated suitably and with corresponding<br><br>
WO 2006/105882	PCT/EP2006/002765<br>
- 9 -<br>
components. The transmission unit 60 advantageously<br>
comprises at least one preconfigurable interface 62, by-<br>
means of which the detected and/or preprocessed<br>
measured data are made available for callup. Making the<br>
measured data available in this case takes place by<br>
accessing the corresponding outgoing contacts 20 and/or<br>
their means for measured-variable detection 50 and/or<br>
measured-variable preprocessing 52, as is also<br>
indicated in figure 9, in a perspective plan view of<br>
the rear wall element 11, in the viewing direction from<br>
the right.<br>
The at least one preconf igurable interface 62 may in<br>
this case be, in particular, an interface which can be<br>
read by suitable data processing devices, for example<br>
an RS-232, RS485/RS422 and/or a USB interface, but it<br>
is also advantageously possible to provide conventional<br>
power links or bus links, such as, for example, an<br>
Ethernet interface, for reading the relevant status<br>
information via a corresponding bus system or control<br>
system and/or via a local or global network. As an<br>
alternative to this or in addition to this, at least<br>
one interface for wireless information transmission to<br>
a corresponding control system and/or a data processing<br>
device set up for this purpose, for example by means of<br>
wireless LAN (WLAN) or Bluetooth, can also be provided.<br>
In addition, the transmission unit 60 has an interface<br>
for voltage supply, for example for supplying the<br>
transmission board and its components and/or the means<br>
for measured-variable detection 50 and/or measured-<br>
variable preprocessing 52 itself, which interface can<br>
be coupled to or combined with the interface for data<br>
transmission.<br>
Furthermore, the transmission unit 60 shown in figure 1<br>
has integral formations with cutouts 64 for access<br>
through to the outgoing contacts 20 and/or their means<br><br>
WO 2006/105882	PCT/EP2006/002765<br>
- 10 -<br>
for measured-variable detection 5 0 and/or measured-<br>
variable preprocessing 52.<br>
Finally, a cover 70 with integral formations 70a for<br>
passing through the cutouts 64 of the transmission unit<br>
60 for isolating the phases as well as clearances 72<br>
for passing through the input contacts 22 and the<br>
outgoing contacts 20 as well as a cutout 74 for access<br>
to the interface 62 of the measuring device 24 is also<br>
provided, which cover partitions the measuring device<br>
off from the interior of the respective switchgear<br>
assembly module and protects it against contamination<br>
and damage, in particular during fitting.<br>
The trough-like rear wall element 11 also has, in the<br>
region of the trough base 12 in the trough interior,<br>
further connecting means 23, which allow for the rear<br>
wall element 11 to be connected to the measuring device<br>
24 and/or for individual components 4 0 of the measuring<br>
device 24 to be connected to one another, for example<br>
in the form of hooks and/or catches 2 3 in order to make<br>
it possible for them to latch into eyelets or cutouts.<br>
A screw connection between the measuring device 24 and<br>
the rear wall element 11 and/or between individual<br>
components of the measuring device 24 can in principle<br>
be provided. The rear wall element 11 and the partition<br>
4 0 therefore latch with one another via the<br>
complementary connecting means, the catches 23 and the<br>
cutouts 25, as a result of which the input contacts are<br>
fixed in their installed position. Furthermore, the<br>
partition 40 and the plastic cover 70 latch with one<br>
another via the complementary connecting means, the<br>
catches 73 and the cutouts or windows 43, as a result<br>
of which both the transmission unit 60 and the outgoing<br>
contacts 20 are fixed in their installed position. In<br>
addition, installation aids 75, 77 for installing and<br>
fixing the transmission unit 60 are provided.<br><br>
WO 2006/105882	PCT/EP2006/002765<br>
- 11 -<br>
Advantageously, the rear wall element 11, the partition<br>
4 0 and the cover 70 are formed from plastic, in<br>
particular from electrically nonconductive plastic.<br>
Figure 2 shows the module rear wall 10 with the<br>
exemplary configuration shown in figure 1, in a<br>
rearward perspective illustration in the viewing<br>
direction from the left. In this case, the clamp-like<br>
contact ends 20a, 22a of the input contacts 22 and the<br>
outgoing contacts 20 as well as the associated sockets<br>
with the cutouts 18 in the outer side or rear side 16<br>
of the trough base 12 of the rear wall element 11 are<br>
indicated. Likewise indicated are the finger-like<br>
contact ends 20b of the outgoing contacts 20.<br>
Furthermore, centering devices 11a and 11b for guiding<br>
the module rear wall into a corresponding accommodating<br>
apparatus and/or adapter unit (not illustrated) are<br>
located on the rear side of the rear wall element 11.<br>

interface 62 of the measuring device 24, the finger-<br>
like contact ends 20b, 22b of the input contacts 22 and<br>
the outgoing contacts 20 as well as the plastic cover<br>
70 are indicated.<br>

ends 20b, 22b of the input contacts 22 and the outgoing<br>
contacts 20 as well as the plastic cover 70 with the<br>
clearances 72 for passing through the input contacts 22<br>
and the outgoing contacts 20 as well as a cutout 74 as<br><br>

accommodating and passing through the clamp-like<br>
contact ends 20b, 22b of the input contacts 22 and the<br>
outgoing contacts 20.<br>
