				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing a chromium catalyst.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the oxidation of chlorinated hydrocarbons, aluminum oxide in the form of particulate alumina is one of the materials of choice. There is an upper use temperature limit for the gamma form of alumina. Alumina is suitable by itself for the oxidation of hydrocarbons, however activated forms are available which contain one or more metal oxides, platinum, platinum/metal oxide, and others. Specific examples include Cr203-CuO/Al203, Pt/Al203, Mn02/Cr203/Al203, and those containing oxides of cobalt, nickel, vanadium, and molybdenum.<br>
Commercial catalytic oxidation processes have been adapted for disposal of waste organic solvents, ground water pollutants, synthetic byproducts, incinerator flue exhaust and automotive exhausts. In the large scale catalytic oxidation of chlorinated hydrocarbons, fuel value is typically recovered as steam and chlorine is recovered as HC1 and/or Cl2. Various approaches are taught in the patent and scientific literature.<br>
Jamal  Eden  disclosed  in  British  Patent  No. 1,506,238  a  Cr203  impregnated  alumina,   silica  or mixture  as  a  fixed  or  fluidized  catalyst   for treating  the  by-product  waste   stream  from  the oxychlorination  of  ethylene.     The  oxidized  exit stream,   free  of  chlorohydrocarbons,   and containing  HCl,   can  be  re-used  in  the oxychlorination  process.     The  catalyst comprised  10-50%  Cr203  on  90-50%  alumina.     The temperature  of  the  catalyst  bed  was  maintained at   from  300°C  to  450°C.     Eden  prepared  the catalyst  by  impregnating  alumina  with  aqueous Cr (N03)3.9H20  or  CrCl3.6H20,   drying  over  hot  air, and  calcining  for  approximately  16  hours  at 54 0°C.     The  catalyst  preparation  of  Eden  is consistent  with  the  conventional  teaching  that catalyst  calcination  temperature  should  be  as high  as  the  intended  use  temperature,   and typically  about   50°  to  100°C  higher  than  the intended  use  temperature.<br>
Ernest  Johnston  has  disclosed  in  U.S. Patent  No.   3,989,807  the  use  of  fluidizable Cr203/alumina  catalyst   for  recovering  chlorine values   from  direct   liquid  injection  of chlorinated  organic  compounds  mixed  with  air. In  Johnston's  process  elemental  chlorine   (Cl2) was  recovered  rather  than  the  HCl   intermediate. Johnston's  catalyst  preparation  consisted  of impregnation  of  chromium  salt  or  oxide  on  the support,   followed  by  drying  and  optionally conditioning  at  350°C  -   500°C.     Johnston suggested  generally  a  chromium  metal  content  of from  0.1  to  20  weight  percent,   preferably  0.5 to  about   10  percent,   on  a  support  having  a<br>
surface  area  at  least  50  m2/g,   preferably  at least  about  200  m2/g.<br>
William  Hunter,   et  al.   disclosed  in  U.S. Patent  No.   4,330,513   a  catalytic  oxidation process  using  conventional  chromium  on  alumina. The  catalyst  comprised  15%  to  25%  by  weight chromic  oxide  on  a  suitable  attrition  resistant carrier  having  a  particle  size  ranging  from  500 microns  up  to  0.25   inches.     Hunter  et  al. suggested  a  catalyst  preparation  by conventional  techniques  with  a  preferred embodiment  prepared  by  forming  large  preformed shapes  such  as  pellets   from  an  extruded  support followed  by  calcining  the  bare  support. Aqueous  chromic  acid  was  then  applied  at   120°F followed  by  drying  at   250°F  and  calcining  at 1300°F   (704°C).<br>
The  deactivation  of  commercial  chromia-alumina  catalysts  over  long  term  exposure  of streams  containing  500  ppm  of  C1   -   C2 chlorohydrocarbons  and  mixtures  has  been studied.     See  S.   K.   Agarwal,   J.J.   Spivey  and J.B.   Butt     Catalyst  Deactivation  During  Deep<br>
Oxidation  of  Chlorohydrocarbons,  Applied<br>
Catalysis  A:   General,   82,    (1992),   pp.   259-275. The  authors   found  that  during  long  term  use-on-stream  the  reaction  zone  temperature  needed  to be   increased  in  order  to  maintain  high conversion  rates.     The  authors  observed  steady deactivation  for  a  mixed  stream  of  chlorinated and  non-chlorinated  hydrocarbons.     The temperature  needed  to  be  raised  from  3 05°C  to 418°C  over  210  days  to  maintain  conversion  at or  above   99%.     The  volatilization  of  chromium appears  worse   for  chlorinated  hydrocarbon feedstreams.     The  authors  speculated  that   the volatilizing  of  chromium  oxychloride  may  be beneficial   in  continuously  exposing  fresh catalyst   surfaces.<br>
In  commercial   scale  catalytic  oxidation  of chlorinated  materials,     the  maximum  operating temperatures  are  limited  by  the  optimal temperature  range  for  the  chosen  catalyst  as well  as  the  corrosion  resistance  inherent   in the  metals  used  for  the  equipment.   For  example, certain  economical  nickel   alloy  steels  undergo catastrophic  corrosion  in  the  presence  of  HCl at  or  above  530   °C.        Increasing  the  operating temperature  of  the  reaction  zone  approaching this  temperature  will   lead  to  higher  corrosion rates.      It  would  therefore  be  desirable   from  an economic  standpoint   to  maintain  very  high conversion  of  99%  or  higher  of  feedstocks  over long  periods  of  time  without  risking  increased rates  of  corrosion.   In  view  of  the  recognition that  conventional   chromium  catalysts  deactivate during  long  term  exposure  to chlorohydrocarbons,   there  is  a  need  for eliminating  deactivation  or  substantially reducing  the  rate  at  which  a  chromium  catalyst loses   its  activity  level.<br>
The  art  related  to  supported  oxidation catalysts  recognizes  loss  in  catalyst  activity is  caused  by  physical  attrition,   and transformations   in  the  support  material   leading to  a  loss  in  surface  area.     Loss  of  active<br>
metal  oxide  follows  with  time-on-stream  from physical   attrition  and  volatilization  in  the form  of  chromium  oxychloride  which  is  increased in  the  presence  of  chlorinated  feedstocks.     The art  suggests  that   in  some  processes,   sloughing off  of  catalyst  surface  is  beneficial   for maintaining  activity.     The  loss  of  the  active metal   from  catalyst   supports  may  be  beneficial from  a  technical   standpoint,   however  from  an environmental  view,   metal   loss   is  problematic because  the  effluent   streams  from  catalytic oxidation  processes  must  conform  to  local  and state  emissions  regulations.     The  hexavalent chromium  in  chromium  oxychloride   (Cr02Cl2),   for example,   is   listed  as  a  carcinogen;   and trivalent  chromium  is  considered  a  toxic substance  and  there  are  stringent  upper  limits on  their  concentration  in  discharged  waste. Therefore,   it  would  be  desirable  to  provide reduced  chromium  emissions  in  the  waste effluent  of  catalytic  oxidation  processes.<br>
The  inventors  have  investigated  the changes  in  metal  oxide  catalysts  over  time-on-stream  in  the  catalytic  oxidation  of chlorinated  hydrocarbons  and  have  discovered  a method  of  making  a  chromium  impregnated catalyst  which  unexpectedly  shows  high stability  and  reduced  chromium  volatilization during  long  term  use.       Therefore  the  catalyst of  the  present   invention  is  not  only  more economical  in  use  but  is  also  more environmentally  friendly.<br><br>
Summary  of  the  invention<br>
In  accordance  with  the  present   invention there  is  provided  a  method  of   fixing  chromium on  a  support.   The  method  results  in  a  chemical transformation  in  the  catalyst  which surprisingly  reduces  the  loss  of  chromium during  long  term  usage.     The  catalyst  made  by the  method  has  also  surprisingly  shown  no  loss in  activity  after  several   thousand  hours  on-stream  in  the  catalytic  oxidation  of chlorohydrocarbon  feed  stream.   The  method comprises  contacting  a  solid  support  with  a chromium  compound,   leaving  a  specified  amount of  chromium  compound,   and  heating,   as  in calcining,   the  impregnated  support  to  a temperature  of  from  725   °C  to  1100   °C.<br>
In  accordance  with  the  invention  there  is further  provided  a  process  for  using  a  chromium catalyst   for  the  oxidation  of  combustible solids,   liquids  and/or  gases.     The  process   for the  catalytic  oxidation  of  combustible material,   comprises:<br>
contacting  a  combustible  material   in  a  reaction zone  at  a  reaction  temperature  of  between  400°C and  800°C  in  the  presence  of  air  or  oxygen, wherein  the   zone  contains  a  catalyst   comprising chromium  which  has  been  fixed  to  the  supporting material  by  calcining  at  a  temperature  from about   725°C  to  about   1100°C.     The     preferred process   includes  recovering  the  heat  of reaction  and  chlorine  value  as  HCl  and/or chlorine.<br>
The method of fixing chromium on the support at higher temperatures causes greater loss in the surface area of the support compared with conventional methods. However, it was unexpectedly found that this catalyst surprisingly shows significantly less chromium loss and very high conversion over extended periods of time without the need for gradually increasing the processing temperature. The optimum operating temperature of the process may be comparatively higher than with conventional chromium catalysts in some instances, yet very high conversion rates are sustainable over a long period of time and there is no formation of any highly undesirable compounds (HUCs), such as polychlorinated biphenyls, dibenzofurans, or dibenzodioxins.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for preparing a chromium catalyst, comprising:<br>
mixing a solid supporting material with a chromium compound of the kind herein described to form a chromium containing treated supporting material that has a chromium content from 0.1% to 30% by weight, drying said treated supported material, and<br>
calcining the treated supporting material at a temperature and for a time at least sufficient for said treated supporting material to reach a temperature of from 900°C to 1100°C to obtain the chromium catalyst.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
Figure I is a plot of the weight percent chromium in the catalyst on the y-axis versus time-on-stream in hours for 3 catalysts having chromium fixed to the support by calcining at 704°C, 750°C and 900°C.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment The method of making the catalysts and catalytic oxidation methods are adapted for fixed-bed or fluid bed processes, depending on the chosen physical attributes for the solid support material. The catalysts are those containing from 0.1% to 30%, preferably 0.5%<br>
to  2 0%,   more  preferably  2%  to  10%  and  most preferably  4%  to  6%  by  weight,   based  on  the total.weight  of  catalyst,   of  chromium  metal which  has  been  fixed  to  the  support  at  a temperature  of  from  725°C  to  1100°C.     The chromium  compound  deposited  on  the  support  can be  from  a  suitable  form  such  as  Cr03  or  CrCl3. The  preferred  catalyst  support  has  a  surface area  of  from  100   to  250   square  meters  per  gram, and  preferably  from  130  to  220   square  meters per  gram   (m2/gm)   prior  to  impregnation  with chromium  compound.      In  the  preparation  of  an alumina  catalyst   suitable  for  fluidized  bed processes,   for  example,   calcination  at  725°C  -1100   °C    will  cause  an  appreciable  reduction  in the  catalyst  surface  area.     A  30%  to  60% reduction  in  the  surface  area  of  alumina  is expected.     After  calcination,   the  surface  area of  the  catalyst  will  range  typically  from  50  to 150  m2/g.     The  preferred  range  of  temperature  of calcination  is   from  750°C  to  1100   °C,   more preferably  from  800   °C  to  1100   °c,   still  more preferably  from  850   °C  to  1100   °C.   and  most preferably  from  900   °C  to 1100   °C<br>
The  method  of   fixing  chromium  on  the support   is  readily  adapted  for  making  a  fixed bed  catalyst.     A  suitable  method  of  preparing  a fixed  bed  embodiment  consists  of  preparing dried  and  extruded  or  pelletized  alumina followed  by  treating  with  chromium  and calcining.     Dried  and  formed  alumina   (Al203)   is prepared  by  any  one  of  a  number  of  techniques well  known  in  the  industry.     For  example,<br>
sodium  aluminate  can  be  reacted  with  a  suitable reagent  to  cause  precipitation  of  aluminum hydroxide  gel.     Alternatively,   a  suitable alkali  such  as  ammonium  hydroxide  is  added  to an  aluminum  salt  such  as  aluminum  sulfate  or aluminum  chloride  in  an  amount  sufficient  to form  aluminum  hydroxide.     Upon  drying  and calcining,   the  aluminum  hydroxide  is  converted to  alumina.     The  alumina  is  mulled  with  the slow  addition  of  water  until  the  moisture content   is  approximately  50%  and  the consistency  of  the  mulled  alumina  is appropriate  for  extrusion.     The  alumina  is  then extruded  through  a  0.125   inch   (0.317  cm.)   die and  the  extruded  pieces  about  0.125  to  about 0.375   inch  long   (0.317  to  0.95  cm.)   are  dried on  a  tray  or  belt  dryer  followed  by  calcination at  from  1  to  4  hours  at  a  temperature  of between  480   °C  to<br>
750   °C.     The  calcined  extrudate  is characterized  by  high  surface  area  and  high porosity.     The  extruded  particles  are impregnated  with  a  aqueous   (eg.   50%)   solution of  chromic  acid  at  a  temperature  of  about   50°C. The  impregnated  extrusions  are  then  dried  at 120°C  followed  by  calcining  for  a  time  at  least sufficient   for  the  material  to  reach  725°C  and preferably  higher.      In  practice  the  dwell   time during  calcination  will  range  from  an  hour  to 24  hours,   however,   good  results  occur  with  tray drying  in  3  hours.       Alumina  is  commercially available  from  a  variety  of  sources  including Alcoa  Industrial  Chemicals  Division,   Bauxite, Ar.,   USA  or  Alcoa  International,   Lausanne, Switzerland.<br>
For  the  sake  of  brevity,   examples  of  the present  invention  will  be  demonstrated  using  a suitable  fluidizable  catalyst.     In  the preparation  of  catalysts  suitable  for  fluid  bed oxidation,   the  preferred  particles  have  the largest  proportion  of  their  particles   in  the range  of  average  diameter  from  4 0  to  140 microns.     Very  small  particles  or  "fines", having  an  average  diameter  below  about  20 microns  are  preferably  avoided.     Catalyst   fines can  be  recovered  during  catalytic  oxidation  by cyclone  separators,   for  example.<br>
Examples  of  chromium  salts  and  oxides which  may  be  impregnated  on  the  support  include chromium  chloride  and  chromous  chloride; chromium  oxide,   e.g.,   chromium  dioxide; chromium  phosphate,   e.g.,   chromic  phosphate; chromium  acetate,   e.g.,   chromic  acetate; chromium  formate,   e.g.,     chromic   formate, chromium  nitrate,   e.g.,   chromic  nitrate; chromium  bromide,   e.g.,   chromous  bromide; chromium  carbonate,   e.g.,   chromous  carbonate; chromic  hydroxide,   barium  chromate,   and potassium  dichromate.     Chromium  chloride  and chromic  acid  are  preferred.     Chromic  acid  is most  preferred.     In  comparisons  between  fluid bed  catalysts  made  with    chromic  oxide  or chromium  chloride,   no  appreciable  differences are  seen  in  effectiveness.     A  variety  of commercial  sources  for  chromium  compounds  may be  found  in  the  Chemicalweek  Buyers  Guide   , Oct.1991,   Chemicalweek  International,   Inc., incorporated  herein  by  reference.<br><br>
The  amount  of  chromium  metal  present  can generally  range  from  0.1%  to  30%,   but   2%  to  10% by  weight  chromium  metal  on  the  support   is preferred.     More  preferably,   chromium  content is   from  4%  to  6%  by  weight  of  the  total  weight of  catalyst.     The  chromium  compound  is conveniently  dissolved  in  water  for impregnating  the  support.     In  terms  of  weight percent  chromium  oxide,   0.3%  of  chromium  oxide is  an  equivalent  of  0.1%  on  a  chromium  metal basis;   a  2%  chromium  metal  content   is  equal   to 6%  on  the  basis  of  Cr203;   a  10%  chromium  metal basis   is  equal  to  29%  on  the  basis  of  Cr203.<br>
Non-limiting  examples  of   solid  supports suitable   for  impregnation  and  use  may  include alumina,   silica-alumina,   molybdenum-alumina, activated  alumina,   silica  gel,   diatomaceous earths,   Fullers  earth,   kieselguhr,   pumice, asbestos,   kaolin,   bentonite,   zeolites,    (e.g., zeolites  A,   X  and  Y),   silica-magnesia-alumina, and  chromia-alumina.     Alumina  supports,   and particularly  alumina  supports  having predominately  the  gamma  form  are  most preferred.     Commercial  varieties  of  gamma alumina  may  be  obtained  from  Engelhard  Corp., Chemical  Catalyst  Group.     The  support  may  be agglomerated  or  fused  through  a  pelletizing  or extrusion  process  as  discussed  above  for  fixed bed  reactors,   or  a  spray  dried  and  calcined powder  for  fluid  bed  applications.<br>
The  types  of   feed  stocks  usable  with  the process  are  innumerable  combustible  materials in  any  form  which  can  be  conveyed  to  the combustion  reaction  zone.     For  example, chlorinated  hydrocarbons  generally  are  ' compounds  or  mixtures  comprising  only  carbon, chlorine  and  hydrogen,   or  carbon,   chlorine hydrogen  and  oxygen.     Such  chlorinated hydrocarbons  may  be  lower  molecular  weight materials  e.g.   containing  from  1  to  about  3 0 carbon  atoms,   and  more  typically  from  2   to  8 carbon  atoms,   or  such  chlorinated  hydrocarbons may  be  of  higher  molecular  weight,   i.e., chlorine-containing  polymers  or  resins  having  a molecular  weight  of  up  to  about   1  million  or more.     The   feed  stock  may  be  waste  gases  from an  incinerator,   or  a  by-product   stream  from chemical   synthesis     processes  such  as  in  vinyl chloride  or  chloroprene  production,   food processes,   coating  or  other  solvent  handling processes.     Specific  examples  of   combustible materials  contained  in  waste  streams  are chlorinated  hydrocarbons   including  the  various isomers  of  chlorinated  benzene, tetrachlorobutenes,   trichloropropenes,   waste materials  from  cracking  of  ethylene  dichloride to  vinylchloride,   dichloropropane, dichloroethylene,   trichloroethylene, trichloroethane,   pentachlorobutane, hexachlorodibenzodioxin,<br>
hexachlorodibenzofuran,     tetrachlorobiphenyl, the  by-product  waste  stream  from  the oxychlorination  of  ethylene,   polyvinyl chloride,   polyvinylidene  chloride,<br>
polychloroprene,   PTFE  and  chlorinated polyethylene,   to  name  a  few.     In  the  most preferred  practice  of  the  process  of  using  the chromium  activated  catalyst,   feedstocks preferably  contain  zero  or  very  low  amounts   (
The  extent  of  chromium  metal  loss   in  prior art  catalysts  is  directly  proportional  to  the total  feedstock  fed  through  the  reaction  zone. Thus,   with  more  concentrated  feeds,   the chromium  loss  rate  would  be  relatively  higher. The  method  of  making  the  catalyst   in  the present   invention  enables  using  the  catalyst for  catalytic  oxidation  of  combustible materials  with  a  lower  chromium  metal   loss under  conditions  of  relatively  high concentrations  of  chlorinated  feedstock. Furthermore,   the  method  of  use  enables  high conversion  of  polychlorinated  species  which  are relatively  difficult  to  completely  oxidize.<br>
The  combustible  materials  may  be  reacted in  any    physical   form  conveyable  to  the reaction    zone.     For  example,   chlorinated organic  compounds  may  be  vaporized  with  or without  water  and  mixed  with  oxygen  or  an oxygen-containing  gas   in  the  reaction  zone  or prior  thereto.     Organic  compounds  which  are  not easily  vaporizable  may  be  introduced  into  the reactor  zone  as  a  liquid  in  the   form  of,   for example,   droplets,   mists  or  air  atomized  jet.<br>
If  necessary,   chlorinated  organic  compounds which  are  normally  solid  at  reaction temperatures  or  which  sublime  upon  heating  may be  dissolved  in  a  liquid  solvent   such  as  lower boiling  chlorohydrocarbon(s)   prior  to introduction  into  the  reaction  zone  or  they  may be   introduced  into  the  reaction  zone  as  a slurry  or  as  a  solid.     Solid  polymer  particles as  ground  or  chopped  pieces  can  be  metered  by  a ribbon  blade  into  the  reaction  zone.<br>
A  description  of  a  suitable  fluid  bed reactor  and  a  fixed  bed  reactor  is  found  in  a review    article  entitled  Vinyl  Chloride  by  J.A. Cowfer  and  A.J.   Magistro,   Kirk  Othmer Encyclopedia  of  Chemical  Technology,   Vol.   23, 3rd  Ed.,    (1983),   John  Wiley,   pp.   865-885,   which is   incorporated  herein  by  reference.     Fluidized bed  reactors  can  be  cylindrical  vessels  made  of corrosion  resistant  nickel  alloy  steel, equipped  with  internal   coils   for  heat  removal (usually  as  steam)   and  either  internal  or external  cyclones  used  for  capturing  fine catalyst  particles.<br>
Fixed  bed  reactors  typically  resemble multi-tube  heat  exchangers  with  catalyst  packed in  vertical  tubes  held  in  a  tube  sheet  at   top and  bottom.     Reaction  heat  is  removed  typically by  steam  generation  on  the  shell   side  of  the reactor  or  by  some  other  heat-transfer  fluid. Inert  diluent  mixtures  with  catalysts  may  be employed  and  packed  in  certain  proportions   so that   low  catalyst  activity  is  at  the   inlet  and with  a  gradient  of  catalyst  activity  toward  the<br>
exit  end.     The  reactor  steel  can  be  nickel alloys  constructed  with  regard  to  either  fluid bed  or  fixed  bed  configurations.     The  primary considerations   for  the  catalytic  oxidation process  are  the  temperature  of  processing, balancing  of  carbon  to  oxygen  from  the feedstock,   balance  of  hydrogen  to  chlorine ratio  and  contact  time  within  the  combustion reaction  zone.     Calculation  of  proper  ratios can  be  made  after  characterizing  the  feedstock composition.     For  example,   an  indirect  measure of  chlorine  content   in  an  organic   liquid feedstock  can  be  estimated  by  the  density  of  a representative  sample.     Generally  a stoichiometric  equivalent  or  an  excess  of molecular  oxygen  to  carbon   (02:C2)   should  be maintained  to  ensure  complete  combustion.     The preferred  mole  ratio  of  oxygen  to  carbon  is  at least   1.1:1.     Quantitative  measurement  of excess  oxygen  in  the  effluent  stream  can  be made  for  monitoring  and  controlling  the  rate  of air  or  oxygen  introduced  relative  to  the   feed rate  of  the  combustible  material.     Under  the preferred  conditions  recovery  of  chlorine   in the  effluent  stream  of  the  process  is  in  the form  of  predominantly  HCl.     The  amount  of  Cl2 produced  is  preferably  present  at  up  to  about 20%  of  the  total  chlorine  in  the  effluent stream.     The  hydrogen:chlorine  mole  ratio favoring  predominantly  HCl   formation  is  greater than  about  1.4.     A  suggested  mole  ratio  is  from 1.4  to  5.5.<br>
The  temperature  of  combustion  in  the present  process  at  which  greater  than  90%  of the  combustible  materials  are  converted generally  is  above  3 00°C.     The  optimum temperature  depends  upon  the  chemical composition  of  the  feedstock.     Chlorinated aromatic  hydrocarbons  are  more  difficult  to completely  oxidize,   therefore  relatively  higher processing  temperatures  are  preferably maintained,   e.g.   455°C  -525°C.     Greater  than 99%  conversion  is  achieved  at   from  455°C  and above.<br>
The  reaction  zone  residence  time  may  be from  several  seconds  to  several  hours,   more typically  several  seconds  up  to  several minutes,   e.g.,   from  about  1  second  up  to  about 2  minutes.     Preferably,   residence  time  is   from about  5  seconds  up  to  about  100  seconds,   and most  preferably  from  about  5  seconds  up  to about   50   seconds.<br>
Atmospheric,   sub-atmospheric  or  super-atmospheric  reaction  pressures  may  be  employed within  the  reaction  zone.     The  reaction pressures  typically  may  be  from  about   0.5  atm absolute  to  about   15  atm  absolute,   more typically  from  about   0.5  atm  absolute  to  about 10   atm  absolute  and    preferably  from  1  to  about 7  atm  absolute.<br>
In  the  typical   start  up  of  a  catalytic oxidation  process,   hot  air  is  fed  through  the catalyst  bed  to  reach  a  temperature  of  about 300°C.     A  low  odor  paraffinic  hydrocarbon  is introduced  next,   and  the  heat  of  reaction usually  enables  the  desired  reaction temperature  to  be  reached.     The  intended feedstock  is  then  introduced  and  the  process modulated  to  achieve  steady  state  conditions and  a  99+%     conversion  of  feedstock  to  chlorine values,   carbon  oxides  and  water.   The  simplest method  for  monitoring  the  proper  carbon  to oxygen  ratio  is  by  measuring  the  excess  oxygen remaining  in  the  vent  gas.     When  the  feed  stock is  characterized  and  can  be  expressed  as  a chemical  equation,   then  the  mole  ratio  of carbon  to  oxygen  is  determined  by  ordinary stoichiometry.     Over  time,   additional   catalyst is   incrementally  added  to  maintain  optimum conditions  as  attrition  occurs.<br>
The   invention  is  more  clearly  understood<br>
in  view  of  the  examples  presented  below  for  the<br>
preparation  of  catalyst  and  the  oxidation<br>
process  utilizing  the  catalyst.	Experiments<br>
were  conducted  to  compare  the  extent  of chromium  loss  on-stream  relative  to  the catalyst  preparation  method.     As  previously noted,   chromium  attrition  from  the  catalyst ends  up  in  the  effluent  stream  from  the oxidation  reaction  and  in  accordance  with environmental  restrictions,   chromium  must  be accounted  for  in  the  waste  effluent.<br>
Examples  1-3<br>
Chromium  impregnated  catalyst  was  prepared by  dissolving  256  g  of  CrCl3« 6H20  in  300  ml distilled  H20  until  a  clear  solution  was obtained.     A  planetary  mixer  was  used  with  845 g  of  gamma  alumina  under  slow  mixing.     The aqueous  chromium  was  slowly  added  over  several minutes.     The  catalyst  was  dried  and  divided into  separate  portions   for  calcining  at different  temperatures  as   listed  below. Calcination  was  conducted  in  the  presence  of steam  over  night.      In  the  commercial preparation  of  the  catalyst,   a  conventional rotary  calciner  can  be  used.     Residence  time during  calcination  of  the   impregnated  solid catalyst   can  conceivably  extend  from  a  few seconds  to  several  hours  depending  on  the  rate of  heat  transfer  to  the  catalyst  material, however  it   is  sufficient  that  the  solid catalyst  material  actually  reaches  at   least 725°C,   preferably  at  least  800°C,   more preferably  at   least   850°C,   and  most  preferably at   least   900°C.     Excessive  residence  time   is uneconomical,   can  unnecessarily  reduce  the surface  area  of  the  catalyst  via  phase transformation,   particularly  with  gamma  alumina supports.     Examples   1  to  3  were  calcined  under the   following  conditions.<br>

Each  sample  of  catalyst  was  separately tested  in  a  laboratory  quartz   fluid  bed  reactor having  3 0  mm  i.d.   and  equipped  with  heating elements  for  temperature  control.     The  height of  the  fluidized  bed  was  approximately  18 inches.     The  top  section  of  the  quartz   tube  was tapered  to  an  internal  diameter  of approximately  60  mm  to  act  as  a  cyclone  for retaining  catalyst  particles.     A  column  of  180 cc  of  each  catalyst  was  used.     A  feed  stock containing  31%  by  weight  perchloroethylene  and 69%  by  weight  dichlorobenzene  was   fed  through an  inlet  approximately  1   inch  above  the  bottom of  the  reaction  bed  which  was  maintained  at  450 °C.     The  rate  of  feedstock  flow  into izhe reaction  zone  was   0.14  g/min.   after  start-up. An  air  stream  was  split   into  2  equal   streams.<br><br>
One  stream  was  mixed  with  the   feedstock  just prior  to  entry  into  the  bed,   with  the  other  air stream  entering  at  the  bottom  of  the  quartz reactor.     The  total  air  feed  rate  was  about   27 m-moles/min.     Effluent  gases  were  bubbled through  water  and  then  dried  in  a  desiccator prior  to  analysis  using  a  gas  chromatograph. Chromium  content   in  the  catalyst  was  analyzed initially  and  over  time  using  XRF  analysis. Chromium  content  was  determined  using  a  Fisons ARL  8410  X-ray  fluorescence  analyzer.     The analysis  employed  the  chromium  K-alpha  1,2   at 69.36  degrees  on  a  LIF  200  crystal  and  FPC detector.     The  X-ray  tube  was  operated  at  50  Kv and  50  Ma.   The  results  are  illustrated  in  Fig. 1  and  table  1  below.<br>
TABLE   1<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It  can  be  seen  that  Example  1  shows  a 31.7%   loss  of  chromium  after  450  hours  on-stream.        Example  2   surprisingly  showed  reduced chromium  loss  of   12.8%  after  491  hours-on-stream  and  example  3   showed  a  further unexpected  reduction  in  chromium  loss  of   11.6% after  664  hours  on-stream.        The  dependant variable  controlled  for  was  the  temperature  of the  calcination  step  and  the  data  shows  a significant  unexpected  transition  in  the  degree of  chromium  fixation  occurring  between  704   °C and  750   °C.     Calcining  at   725°C  provides unexpectedly  less  chromium  loss  over  time compared  with  calcining  at  704°C.     A  reduction in  chromium  emission  in  the  waste  effluent gases  on  the  order  of  the  difference  between examples  l,   2  and  3  can  be  appreciated  on  a commercial  scale.     For  example,   at  100,000   lbs. (45,400  kg.)   of  reactor  capacity  corrected  for a  0.15%  daily  loss  of  catalyst  through  physical attrition,     the  annual  amount  of  chromium  metal due  to  volatilization  would  be  as  follows:<br>

In  a  separate  long  term  trial  using  a chromium  catalyst  made  according  to  the invention  which  included  a  calcination  step  at 900°C,   this  catalyst   showed  an  initial  chromium loss  of  approximately  10%  during  the  first several  hundred  hours  of  use  on-stream  with  a<br>
feed  stock  consisting  of   31%  perchloroethylene and  69%  dichlorobenzene.     This  catalyst surpisingly  showed  no  further  loss   in  chromium, and  has  undergone  no  change   in  activity  after more  than  3,000  hours  on-stream,   at  constant temperature.<br>
While  the   invention  has  been  explained  in relation  to  its  preferred  embodiments,   it   is  to be  understood  that  various  modifications thereof  will  become  apparent  to  those  skilled in  the  art  upon  reading  the  specification.
