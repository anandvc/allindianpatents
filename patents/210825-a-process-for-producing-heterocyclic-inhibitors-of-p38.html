TECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing heterocyclic  inhibitors  of<br>
p38, a mammalian protein, kinase involved in cell proliferation, ceil death and, response to extracellular stimuli.  The invention also relates to methods for producing these inhibitors,  The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising the inhibitors of the invention and methods of utilizing those compositions in the treatment and prevention of various disorders,<br>
BftCKGROUMD OP THE INVENT I OH<br>
Protein kinases are involved in various<br>
cellular responses to extracellular signals. Recently, a family of mitogen^activated protein kinases {MAPK) has been discovered.  Members of this family are Ser/Thr kinases that activate their substrates by phosphorylation [B. Stein et al., Ann. Rep. Med. Chem.f 31, pp. 289-93 (1996)j .  MAPKs are themselves activated by a variety of signals including growth f.iccors, cytokines, UV radiation, and stress-inducing agents.<br>
One particularly interesting MAPK is p38.  p38, also known as cytokine suppressive anti-inflatnmatory drug binding protein (CS3P) and RK, was isolated from raurine pre-B ceils that were transfected with the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor, CD14, end induced with LPS. p38 has since been isolated and sequenced, as has the cDNA encoding it in humans and mouse.  Activation of p38 has been observed in cells stimulated by stress, such as treatment of 1ipopolysaccharides (LPS), UV,<br><br>
anisoraycin, or osmotic shock, and by cytokines, such as IL-1 and TNF.<br>
Inhibition of p38 kinase leads to a blockade on the production of both IL-1 and TNF, IL-1 and TNF stimulate the production.of other proinflairanatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 and h*ave been implicated in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases and in post-raenopausal osteoporosis [R. B, Kimble et al., Endocrinol., 136, pp. 3054-61 (1995)}.<br>
Based upon this finding, it is believed that p38, along with other MAPKs, have a role in mediating cellular response to inflammatory stimuli, such as leukocyte accumulation, macrophage/iuonocyte activation, tissue resorption, fever, acute phase responses and neutrophilia.  In addition, MAPKs, such as p38, have been implicated in cancer, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, immunodeficiency disorders, autoimmune diseasesr ce?), deeth,. allergies, osteoporosis and neurodegenerative disorders.  Inhibitors of p38 have also been implicated in the area of pain management through inhibition of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2 induction.  Other diseases associated with 11-1, IL-6, IL-8 or TNF overproduction are set forth in WO 96/21654.<br>
PCT publication WO 97/33883 describes amino-substituted pyrimidine compounds for use in treating cytokine mediated diseases.  European Patent Applications EP 0 337 943 and EP 0 337 944 describe N-phenyl~N~ pyrimidin-2-yl ureas having herbicidal and plant growth-regulating activity.<br>
Others have already begun trying to develop drugs that specifically inhibit MAPKs .o  For example, PCT publication WO 95/31451 describes pyrazole compounds that<br><br>
-2a-<br>
inhibit MAPKs, and, in particular, p38.  However, the efficacy of these inhibitors in vivo is still being<br>
investigated.  PCT publication WO 96/27098 also describes p38 inhibitors, which include substituted pyridine compounds,<br>
Accordingly^ there is still1 a great need to develop other potent inhibitors of p38, including p38™<br><br>
specific inhibitors, that are useful in treating various conditions associated with p38 activation.<br>

According to another embodiment, the present invention provides methods of producing the above-identified inhibitors of p38 of the formulae (la),(Ib), (Ic), (Id) and (Ie).  Representative synthesis schemes for formula (la) are depicted below.<br>
Schemes 1-3 illustrate the preparation of compounds in which W is either an amino, carboxyl or an aldehyde function.  In each case the particular moiety may be modified through chemistry well known in the literature.  For example the final amino compounds D and N (schemes 1 and 4 respectively) may be acylated, sulfonylated or alkylated to prepare compounds within the scope of W.  In all schemes, the LI and L2 groups on the initial materials are meant to represent leaving groups<br><br>
WO 99/58502	PCT/US99/10291<br>
~-35~<br>
ortho to the nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring.  For example, compound A may foe 2, 6™dichloro~3 nitro pyridine.<br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
5	in Scheme  1,   W is  selected from amino™<br>
derivatized compounds  such as N (R2) SO2-N{R2) 2;   N{R2)SO2~<br>
N(R1(R3);   N(R')C(O)-R2;   or  N(R2)2.<br>
In Scheme 1, the Q2 ring is introduced<br>
10  utilizing one of many reactions know in the art which result in the production cf biaryl compounds.  One example may be the reaction of an aryl lithium compound with the pyridine intermediate A.  Alternatively, an arylmetalic compound such as an aryl stannane or an aryi<br>
15  boronic acid may be reacted with the aryl halide portion<br>
(intermediate A) in the presence of a Pd° catalyst to form product B.   In the next step, a Ql substituted derivative such as a phenyl acetonitrile derivative may be treated with a base such as sodium hydride/ sodium 20  amide, LDA, lithium hexamethyldisilazide or any number of<br><br>
-36-<br>
other non-nucleophilic bases to deprotonate the position alpha to the cyano group, which represents a masked amide moiety.  This anion is then contacted with intermediate B ,tc form C-  The nitrile or equivalent group of intermediate C is then hydrolyzed to form the amide and the nitro group is subjected to reducing conditions to form the amine intermediate D.  Intermediate D is then used to introduce various functionality defined by W through chemistry such as acylation, sulfcnylation or alkylation reactions well known in the literature. Depending on the regiochemistry of the first two steps of this procedure, the first two steps may need to be reversed.<br>
15  Scheme 2<br><br>
In Scheme 2, W is selected from carboxyl-derivatized compounds, such as C(O)-R2; CH(OH)-R2; C(O)-N(R2)2; or C(0)-2 0  OR .<br>
Scheme 2 generally follows the procedures described for Scheme 1 except that a carboxyl<br><br>
-37-<br>
intemediate such as E is the starting material.  The first two steps mirror Scheme 1, and, as mentioned for Scheme 1, may be reversed depending on the regiochemistry of specific examples.  Intermediate G is formed from these first two steps and this material may be hydrolyzed as mention to for the carboxyl intermediate H.  The carboxyl group may then be modified according to well-known procedures from the literature to prepare, analogs with defined W substituenrs such as acylations, amidazions and esterificanions.<br>
Scheme 3<br><br>
In Scheme 3, W is selected from (C1-C4) straight or branched alkyl optionally substituted with N(R')Z, OR', CO2R', CON(R')2, R3, or SO2N(R2)2; or a 5-6 membered carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring system optionally substituted with N(R'}2, OR', CO2R' , CON(R')2, or SO2N (?/);.; provided that W is not an R3 substituted Ci alkyl.<br><br>
WO 99/58502	PCT/US99/10291<br>
-38-<br>
In scheme 3 a pyridine derivative is metalated and quenched with one of many known electrophiles which can generate an aldehyde, to form intermediate I. . The aldehyde can then be masked to form the dimethyl acetal 5  J.  This intermediate is then carried on as described in scheme 1 and 2 to introduce the Ql and Q2 substituents, to produce intermediate L.  As before, these two steps may be interchanged depending on specific regiochemistry. The masked aldehyde of L may then be deprotected and<br>
10  utilized to form compounds with the defined W substitution using well know chemistry such as alkylations and reductive aminations.<br>
Schemes 4-6 are similar to schemes 1-3 with the exception that the targeted compounds are those in which<br>
15  Z = Nitrogen.  The steps for these schemes parallel 1-3 with the exception that the alkylation utilizing a phenyl acetonitrile is replaced with a reaction with a Ql amine derivative such as a substituted aniline derivative.  The<br>
20  acylation reaction with, for example/ chlorosulfonyl isocyanate.<br><br>
WO 99/58502	PCT7US99/10291<br>
-39-<br><br>
In Scheme 4, W is selected from amino-derivati2ed groups such as N (R2) SO2-N(R2) 2; N(R2)SO2-5  N(R:'){R3); N{R2)C(O)-OR2; N (R2) C (0) -N (R2) 2; N(R2)C(O)-N(RZ)(R3); N(R2)C(O)-R2; or N(R2)2.<br>
In Scheme 4, intermediate B (from scheme 1) is treated with, for example, an aniline derivative in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate.<br>
10  Additionally, a palladium catalyst may be utilized to<br>
enhance the reactivity of this general type of reaction, if needed.  The resulting amine derivative is then acylated to form intermediate M.  The nitro group of M is then reduced to form N and the amino group may then be<br>
15  derivatized as described for scheme I.  As mentioned for schemes 1-3, the steps involved in the introduction of the Ql and Q2 substituents may be interchanged depending on the specific regiochemistry of specific compounds.<br><br>

In Scheme 5, W is selected from carboxyl-derivatized groups such as C(O)-R2; CH(OH)-R2; C(O)-N(R2)2; or C(O)-OR2.<br>
Scheme 6<br><br><br><br>
-41-<br>
In Scheme 6, W is selected from (C1-C4) straight or branched alkyl optionally substituted with N(R')z/ OR', CO2R', CON(R')2, R3/ or SO2N(R2}2; or a 5-6 membered carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring system optionally substituted with N(R' ) 2, OR', CO2R', CON(R')2, or SO2N(R2)2; provided that W is not an R3 substituted Ci alkyl.<br>
Schemes 5 and 6 generally follow the procedures mentioned above.<br>
One having skill in the art will recognize schemes 1-6 may be used to synthesize compounds having the general formula of (Ib), (Ic), (Id) and (Ie).<br>
