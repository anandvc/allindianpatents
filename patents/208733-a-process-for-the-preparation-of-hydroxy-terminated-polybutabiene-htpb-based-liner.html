				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process of preparation of hydroxy terminated poly-butadiene (HTPB) based liner being used for case bonded composite propellant motors.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Solid propellant motors contain two distinctive systems, namely propellants and the subsystems that are not combustible and are elastomeric in nature. Three main basic subsystems are insulation, liner and inhibition. Of the three, the requirement for liner is very stringent and varies from motor to motor. These motors include a motor case which surrounds a solid propellant having a star or other shaped hollow core, which defines a combustion chamber, an ignitor assembly, which is usually mounted on top of the propellant and a bottom mounted nozzle assembly. An insulator, which usually comprises one or more layers of a rubber material bonded to the case wall, prevents excessive heating and possible burn through of the casing. Generally, a liquefied formulation is applied to the insulator surface and partially cured, forming a thin liner which enhances bonding of the propellant to the insulator. The propellant slurry is then prepared and poured into the motor case, contacting the semi-cured<br>
liner.  The slurry cast motor is then kept for curing.  During the<br>
process  of  curing,  the propellant and  liner  undergo chemical rross-linking  thereby  resulting  in  a  firm  bond  between  the<br>
propellant  and  the  insulator  by  means  of  the  liner   coat. Carboxy terminated poly-butadiene (CTPB) based liner material with<br>
trifunctional   epoxy   resin  and   tris— (-2-methy1   aziridinyl) phosphine  oxide (MAPO) as a curative with carbon-black as  filler<br>
have been used for various cartridge devices.  A liner formulation based on epoxy/PBAN (polybutadiene acrylic acid acrylonitrile) has<br>
also  been  used for Aerojet applications.  HTPB  based  composite propel1ants  are  widely used in present  day  propellant  motors. One  of the liner formulations uses HTPB  (RM—45) ,  di-octyl sebacate  (DOS),  carbon black filler  with  dimeryl  diisocyanate<br>
(DDI) as a curative.<br>
The main disadvantage of the known liner formulation is that<br>
it  contains  di-octyIs-sebacate (DOS) as  plasticiser while  the propel lant.  contains di-octyl adipate (DOA) as plasticiser,  which<br>
leads  to  plasticiser migration.<br>
A MIL-standard describes liner formulation based on  HTPB—C—<br>
talack-DDI and imine curing bonding agent.  One of the disadvantage of  such a known liner formulations is that it uses MAPO as one of<br>
the ingredients which is highly toxic and carcinogenic.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of such known liner liner formulations is that MAPO has poor thermal stability<br>
Further disadvantage of such known liner formulations is that MAPO has got side reactions due to which repeatable properties are not achieved.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide HTPB based liner for case bonded composite propellants and a process for preparation thereof where-in the liner composition forms covalent bond between the propellant and the liner.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to develop HTPB based liner for case bonded composite propellants having interfacial bond which is completely reliable.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to develop HTPB based liner for case bonded composite propellants having superior bond strengths.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to develop HTPB based liner for case bonded composite propellants having burn rates of 5-20 mm/sec at 70 kgf/cm2.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to develop HTPB based liner for case bonded composite propellants whose pot life is such that the liner is cured to a tacky state till casting of the propellant is completed.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to develop HTPB based liner for case bonded composite propellants so that curing can be performed preferably at room temperature.<br>
Even further object of the present invention is to develop HTPB based liner for case bonded composite propellants overcoming the problem of aging.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to develop HTPB based liner for case bonded composite propellants overcoming the migration of plastisizers and other reactive components from the propellant to the liner, during curing of the propellant.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of hydroxy terminated poly butadiene (HTPB) based liner which comprises by the steps of deaerating 58 to 70% basic binder as herein described, mixing of 0.015 to 3% cross-linking cum anti-oxidant as herein described and 0.5 to 1.1% tackifier as herein described, three phased addition of fillers as herein described followed by addition of a curative as herein described.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the steps are carried out under controlled humidity of 55+5%. The process consists in the steps described subsequently herein.<br>
Preparation of Liner<br>
HTPB, 58 to 70% by weight more preferably 62 to 66% by weight (deaerated under vacuum 
weight metre preferably 22 to 24% by weight is added in three equal instalments with 5 minutes intermittent mixing. After complete<br>
addition,  the mixing is continued without vacuum  and  thereafter<br>
o     o with  vacuum  ( 
 cooling  this  mixture to a temperature of  
(2,4- and 2,6- toluene diisocyanate) . is added according to — NCO:OH ratio required to obtain curative index of 0.0 to 1.3 more<br>
preferably to obtain a curative index of 1.0 to 1.05 (Liner composition contains excess NCO group, whereas propel 1 ant<br>
composition contains excess OH groups, so NCO of liner and OH of propellant react to form a bond).<br>
The  insulator is abraded, cleaned by  trichloroethy lene  to<br>
o remove  oily or greasy matter and kept in oven at 70 C for 2 to 3<br>
hours  for  evaporation  of solvent.   The  liner  composition  is<br>
diluted  with dry dichloromethane (CH  Cl ) in 1:1 proportion  and 2 mixed  well with mechanical stirrer for five minutes.  Thin  layer<br>
is  applied on insulation layer manually by brush or by spray  gun depending  upon  the size of the rocket motor.  The  liner  coated<br>
motor is preserved under vacuum till the propellant is cast.<br>
The  liner coat remains tacky from 22 hours to 72  hours  of<br>
application.    The  propellant  has  to  be  cast  during   tacky condition.   After casting of propellant the motor is  cured,  NDT<br>
tested and statically evaluated.<br>
This invention will now be illustrated with a working example which is intended to be typical example to explain the technique of the present invention and is not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation in the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
650 g of HTPB was deaerated under vacuum (
TDI (2,4- and 2,6-toluene diisocyanate was added. After addition of TDI the mix was stirred for 15 minutes and evacuated for 10 minutes and poured in tray to obtain 2.5 -3.0 mm thick sheets. The sheets were cured at ambient for three days and tested for mechanical properties according to ASTM D-638 M, Type M-II. The interface properties were studied by Wheel-peel measurements with composite propellants. Bond strength was determined by placing the propellant pieces (50 x 20 x 20mm) in Al mould, 10 mm apart and the liner formulation was filled in the gap and cured. The samples were tested on Instron Universal Testing Machine.<br>
The results of characterization of the liner formulation are summerised in Table 1.<br>
1	Tensile strength (kgf/cm2)	18-20<br>
2	% Elongation	40-50<br>
3	Density (g/cc)	1.18-1.20<br>
4	Shore Hardness A	58-60<br>
5	Tensile bond strength with composite propellant (kgf/cm2)     5 to 8<br>
6	Peel strength (cohesive failure in propellant) (kgf/cm2)	1.2 - 2.222<br>
7	Pot life (tacky condition	72 hours<br>
The efficacy of interface properties was studied at extremes of temperatures from -30°C to + 55°C also. In all the cases the failure observed is cohesive in propellant than at the interface. This is further confirmed by NDT testing and proved by static testing the rocket motors in endwise-burning as well as in radial mode.<br>
The tacky behaviour of the final product for the desired extended duration is produced by the synergistic effect on each other by the different constituent of the present formulation. This tacky behaviour is absent in any of the individual constituents.<br><br><br>
