				<td>APPARATUS FOR COMPRESSION MOLDING ARTICLES MADE OF<br>
PLASTICS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for compression molding<br>
articles made of plastics.<br>
Background Art<br>
The invention can be applied non-exclusively to an apparatus for<br>
manufacturing any plastic articles, and in particular caps for closing<br>
containers and the like.<br>
Patent US 5,807,592 by the same Assignee discloses apparatuses for<br>
pressure-molding of caps for closing containers, such as screw caps. Such<br>
apparatuses comprise a carousel that rotates about a vertical axis and on<br>
which a plurality of pressure-molding units are mounted concentrically<br>
around the rotation axis of the carousel and at identical angular distances.<br>
Each one of said units comprises an upper punch, which cooperates with a<br>
lower mold that is aligned with said punch and has a molding cavity.<br>
By virtue of the rotation of the carousel, the molding units trace a<br>
circular path, which comprises a first sector, in which the necessary doses of<br>
plastic material to be molded are deposited in the cavities of the molds, a<br>
second sector, in which the article is molded, a third sector, in which the<br>
molded article is cooled, and a fourth sector, in which the molded article is<br>
extracted and conveyed away.<br>
In these known apparatuses, the plastic material to be molded is removed<br>
from an extruder by means of a rotating head provided with a plurality of<br>
removal elements, which trace a circular path that has a point of tangency<br>
with the extrusion nozzle and with the circular path traced by the molding<br>
units. The rotating head and the carousel are mutually in step, in order to<br>
allow the removal elements to remove in succession doses of plastic<br>
material from the extruder and deposit them in the cavities of the molds.<br>
Apparatuses for forming liners inside preformed caps are also known. In<br><br>
these apparatuses, the doses of plastic material, after being removed, are introduced in the<br>
preformed caps conveyed by a rotating head. The caps are then transferred into the<br>
molding units of a rotating carousel, which form the liners directly inside the caps.<br>
Further examples of cap and liner molding systems are available from the<br>
documents US-A-5 811 044 and US-A-4 979 282.<br>
The conventional apparatuses suffer the drawbacks that the doses of plastic<br>
material removed from the extruder, by moving in a free air environment, do not maintain<br>
a constant temperature until molding occurs and therefore have differences in the degree<br>
of plasticity of the plastic material between the surface layers and the innermost layers.<br>
These differences cause variations in the flow of the plastic material during<br>
molding and generate defects on the finished product.<br>
This drawback, moreover is worsened by the removal elements, which cool down<br>
along the path that they trace, so that when they make contact with the plastic material at<br>
the outlet of the extruder they cause a localized temperature variation in the contact<br>
region which causes aesthetic surface defects on the product.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The aim of the present invention is therefore to provide an improved apparatus so<br>
as to obviate the drawbacks on the finished product<br>
This aim is achieved with an apparatus whose characteristics are defined in the<br>
appended claims.<br>

Ways of carrying out the Invention<br>
With reference to figures 1 to 7, reference numeral 1 designates a portion<br>
of the carousel of an apparatus for compression molding, which is<br>
rotationally actuated in the direction X about a vertical axis.<br>
The carousel 1 comprises a plurality of molding units, each whereof is<br>
composed of an upper punch (not shown in the drawing), which is aligned<br>
with a lower mold 2.<br>
Each mold 2 has a cavity 3, which is open upward and in which a dose D<br>
of plastic material is molded; said dose is introduced therein in the pasty<br>
state and is fed by a rotating head 4, which rotates in the direction Y about a<br>
further vertical axis Z that is parallel to the rotation axis of the carousel.<br>
The mold 2 is mounted at the top of a vertical stem, which is guided in a<br>
seat of the carousel 1 and is actuated by a hydraulic jack (not shown), which<br>
can be connected, by way of suitable valve systems, to a supply of<br>
pressurized fluid. When the pressurized fluid pushes the stem upward, the<br><br>
mold 2, in an appropriate region of the path traced by the carousel,<br>
compresses the dose D of plastic material against the punch, performing,<br>
along a subsequent arc of the path, the molding of the article, for example a<br>
cap-type closure.<br>
Said rotating head 4 is shown only schematically in the accompanying<br>
drawings, since it is not relevant to the inventive concept of the present<br>
invention. In any case, it can be understood more clearly from the aforesaid<br>
patent US 5,807,592.<br>
As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the rotating head 4 comprises a shaft 5,<br>
which rotates about the vertical axis Z and to the top of which a flange 6 is<br>
rigidly coupled; a plurality of elements 7 for removing the doses of plastic<br>
material are fixed to the lower face of said flange and are distributed around<br>
the axis Z at an equal circumferential distance that is equal to the one by<br>
which the molds 2 are spaced around the axis of the carousel A. Each<br>
removal element 7 comprises a sort of cup, which has a concave portion<br>
directed along the rotation axis Y. The lower edge of the cups 7 is co-planar<br>
to the outlet of a nozzle 8a of an extruder 8, whose opening is directed<br>
upward so that during the rotation of the head 4 each cup 7 can remove from<br>
the nozzle a dose D of plastic material that corresponds to the dose that exits<br>
from the nozzle in the time that elapses between the passage of two<br>
successive cups in front of said nozzle.<br>
The cups 7 trace a path A that is tangent to the path B traced by the<br>
molds 2, and the angular velocities of the carousel 1 and of the rotating head<br>
4 are linked so that at the point of tangency of the paths A and B each cup 7<br>
is substantially aligned with a respective mold 2. The transfer of the dose D<br>
from the cups 7 into the cavities 3 of the molds can be performed as<br>
described in the aforesaid patent US 5,807,592 by virtue of the action of a<br>
jet of compressed air that is directed downward, possibly combined with a<br>
downward mechanical action obtained by providing, in each cup, an<br>
expulsion piston that can move vertically and is actuated by compressed air<br><br>
by way of valve means.<br>
As explained initially, with known compression molding carousels of the<br>
type described above, the dose D of plastic material, after being removed by<br>
the cups 7, is struck by the stream of air for a certain time before it is<br>
deposited in the cavities 3. During this time, the dose D undergoes a cooling<br>
that alters its consistency, so that during molding there is an uneven flow of<br>
the plastic material, with the mentioned defects that can be observed on the<br>
finished article. This drawback is combined with the fact that the removed<br>
doses transfer heat to the cups, which dissipate it during the rotation of the<br>
carousel, so that at every removal of the doses from the extruder, the<br>
temperature decrease due to the contact of the doses with the cups is added<br>
to the temperature decrease of the doses caused by the air of the<br>
environment.<br>
In order to obviate this drawback, a stationary device is associated with<br>
the outlet of the extruder 8 and keeps the temperature of the doses<br>
substantially constant by way of temperature conditioning means.<br>
Said device (see Figures 4 to 7) is composed of two vertical walls 9 and<br>
10, which are shaped like a circular arc and lie concentrically to the rotation<br>
axis of the carousel 4, between the extruder 8 and the point of tangency of<br>
the paths A and B.<br>
Two superimposed horizontal walls or bottoms 11 and 12 are arranged<br>
between the walls 9 and 10; the upper bottom 11 forms, together with the<br>
walls 9 and 10, an upper channel 13, while the lower bottom 12 encloses,<br>
together with the bottom 11, a duct 14 that is connected to a compartment<br>
15.<br>
The compartment 15 is connected, by means of a tube 16, to a delivery of<br>
heated air, which after being conveyed through the compartment 15 into the<br>
duct 14 flows into the upper channel 13 through a plurality of openings 17<br>
formed in the upper bottom 11, forming thus temperature conditioning<br>
means.<br><br>
The device is adjacent to the flange 6, so that the edges of the walls 9 and<br>
10 skim the lower face of the flange 6, so as to close in practice the channel<br>
13.<br>
In order to reduce the escape of the hot air from the channel 13, at the<br>
opposite end of said channel there are two respective transverse partitions<br>
18 and 19, in which two passage openings 20 and 21 are formed; said<br>
openings are sized so as to allow the passage of the cups 7 during the<br>
rotation of the head 4.<br>
Operation of the device according to the invention is readily<br>
understandable from the above description. In particular, it should be noted<br>
that the doses D removed from the outlet of the extruder 8, by passing<br>
through a channel that is substantially closed until they are deposited in the<br>
cavities 3, do not undergo appreciable temperature variations. Indeed, by<br>
adjusting appropriately the temperature of the air fed into the channel it is<br>
possible to adjust the temperature of the doses to values for optimizing the<br>
consistency of the plastic material during molding, so as to ensure the<br>
production of articles that are free from structural and aesthetic defects.<br>
The described device is susceptible of numerous modifications and<br>
variations, all of which are within the scope of the appended claims and are<br>
shown in Figures 8 to 14. It is noted that for the sake of simplicity in<br>
description, the parts that are identical, similar or equivalent to the parts of<br>
the apparatus shown in Figures 1 to 10 are designated by the same reference<br>
numerals increased by 100 for the variation of Figures 8 to 10, by 200 for<br>
the variation of Figures 11 and 12, and by 300 for the variation of Figures<br>
13 and 14.<br>
Figures 8, 9 and 10 illustrate a solution in which the walls 109, 110 close<br>
concentrically in a cylindrical shape around the rotation axis Z of the<br>
rotating head, so as to form a circular channel 113, which remains closed by<br>
the flange 106 and in which the cups 107 rotate. The openings 117 are<br>
formed in the circular bottom 111 and allow connection to the underlying<br><br>
duct 114 (Figure 10) and therefore the feeding of the hot air, which by<br>
filling all of the circular channel 113 keeps its temperature at a substantially<br>
constant value, which can in any case be preset according to the<br>
requirements.<br>
A first access opening 122 and a second access opening 123 are formed<br>
through the upper bottom 111 and the lower bottom 112 (not shown); said<br>
first opening is provided in order to allow the nozzle 108a of the extruder<br>
108 to access the channel 113 up to the level where the doses D are removed<br>
by the cups 107, and the removed doses are deposited through said second<br>
opening into the cavities of the molds 103.<br>
The solution of Figures 8 to 10, with respect to the one described above,<br>
offers the advantage of keeping the temperature of the cups 107<br>
substantially constant, so as to prevent the cups from cooling during the<br>
rotation of the head 104 and, by making contact with the doses, from<br>
causing damaging variations in the consistency of the plastic material and<br>
from forming defects that can be observed on the outer surface of the<br>
molded article.<br>
The two embodiments shown in Figures 11 and 12 and respectively in<br>
Figures 13 and 14 relate to adaptations of the inventive concept to an<br>
apparatus for forming a liner inside caps C.<br>
The embodiment of Figures 11 and 12 comprises a vertical extruder 208<br>
with a nozzle 208a that is orientated downward. Below the extruder 208<br>
there is the rotating head 204, which is keyed on a shaft 205 that has a<br>
horizontal axis and is provided with cups 207 that are arranged radially with<br>
respect to the shaft 205.<br>
A conveyor 23 is arranged tangentially below the rotating head 204 and<br>
conveys the caps C at a mutual distance equal to the circumferential<br>
distance of the cups 207.<br>
The rotating head 204 is synchronized, with the conveyor so that each cup<br>
207 deposits the dose D removed from the nozzle 208a in a respective cap<br><br>
c.<br>
The cups 207, along the semicircular portion of the path that runs from<br>
the nozzle 208a to the point of tangency with the conveyor, rotate inside a<br>
semicircular channel 213 formed between two walls 209 and 210 that lie<br>
concentrically to the shaft 205 and continue parallel to the conveyor 23<br>
above and below the caps C.<br>
The channel 213 is closed at the front by a wall 24, which joins the walls<br>
209 and 210 and at the rear by a side wall 25, to which the outer wall 210 is<br>
coupled, and by a disk 26, which the inner wall 209 skims with its edge.<br>
The concentric walls 209 and 210 are provided with openings that allow<br>
the cups 207 to enter and exit the channel.<br>
At the nozzle 208a there is the connecting tube 216 for connection to the<br>
delivery of hot air, which accordingly conditions the temperature of the<br>
doses from the point where they are removed to the point where they are<br>
compressed inside the caps C in order to produce the liners.<br>
The embodiment of Figures 13 and 14 also comprises a rotating head<br>
304, which has a vertical axis and concentrically to which a plurality of grip<br>
elements 27 are provided, that are similar to clamps and are actuated like<br>
clamps in order to grip and retain the caps C. A rotating head of this type is<br>
described for example in greater detail in patent US 4,518,336 by the same<br>
Assignee, to which reference is made here as an integral part of the present<br>
description.<br>
A cup 307 is provided in alignment with each individual grip element 27<br>
and above the respective cap C, and is rigidly coupled to a stem 28 that can<br>
slide vertically and is provided, at the top, with a roller 29 that follows a<br>
stationary cam 30. The cam 30 actuates the stems 28 between a position for<br>
removing the doses D from an extruder 308 and a position for depositing<br>
said doses inside the caps C.<br>
The caps C, with the dose D deposited therein, after covering a preset<br>
0 rotation angle (approximately 90° in Figure 14), are inserted in respective<br><br>
seats 31 of a rotary star conveyor 32, by which they are transferred onto a<br>
molding carousel 33 equipped with molding units 34, which mold the liners<br>
G inside the caps C.<br>
The caps C move from the extruder 308 to the carousel 33 inside a<br>
channel 313 that is S-shaped and runs, along a first part of its length,<br>
concentrically to the rotation axis of the rotating head 304 and, along a<br>
second part, concentrically to the rotation axis of the star conveyor 32.<br>
The channel 313 has, along said first part, a substantially tubular<br>
structure with a rectangular cross-section, which is formed by two vertical<br>
walls 309 and 310 and two upper and lower horizontal walls 35 and 36. The<br>
lower wall, along the arc that is concentric to the axis of the star conveyor<br>
32, is integrated, along half of its radial width, by the peripheral annular<br>
region of the star conveyor 32.<br>
The channel 313 is supported by brackets 37, 37a, which are fixed to<br>
fixed parts 38 of the apparatus, and is connected to a hot air supply as in the<br>
previously described examples. In order to allow the doses D to be<br>
deposited in the caps C after being removed from the extruder 308 by means<br>
of the cups 307, along the portion of the upper wall that is concentric to the<br>
axis of the rotating head 304 there is an arc-like slot 39, through which the<br>
cups 307 can be arranged adjacent to the caps in order to deposit the doses<br>
and can be raised back into the position in which they are ready for the<br>
subsequent removal.<br>
As clearly shown, the embodiment of Figures 13 and 14, like the<br>
embodiment of Figures 11 and 12, illustrates the possibility to condition the<br>
temperature of the doses even when the path between the removal point and<br>
the deposition point of the doses is considerably long.<br>
In the practical execution of the invention, the thermal conditioning of<br>
the doses can be provided not only by means of hot air but also by<br>
subjecting the doses to heating by irradiation or by heating the air in the<br>
channel with electrical means. Moreover, it has been found that even<br><br>
without adding heat from outside the system is capable of ensuring a<br>
thermal equilibrium by utilizing the heat of the nozzle of the extruder and of<br>
the extruded plastic material.<br>
