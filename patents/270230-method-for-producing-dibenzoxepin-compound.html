				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
METHOD FOR PRODUCING DIBENZOXEPIN COMPOUND<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing<br>
olopatadine which is useful as a medicament.<br>
Background Art<br>
Olopatadine ((Z)-11-(3-dimethylaminopropylidene)-<br>
6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-acetic acid) is a compound<br>
represented by Formula (II) :<br><br>
and it is a pharmaceutical compound useful as an antiallergic<br>
agent to be applied to allergic rhinitis, urticaria or the like.<br>
When (Z)-11-(3-dimethylaminopropylidene)-6,11-<br>
dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-acetic acid is produced by a<br>
chemical synthetic method, its E-isomer is simultaneously<br>
generated in general. Therefore, in order to obtain the<br>
objective Z-isomer more, it is necessary to isomerize the<br>
E-isomer to the Z-isomer.<br>
JP-B-5-86925 and JP-B-7-116174 describe that when the<br>
objective substance is obtained as an E/Z mixture, the isomers<br><br>
can be separated through column chromatography,<br>
recrystallization or the like, and if necessary, the cis-isomer<br>
(Z-isomer) can be isomerized to the trans-isomer (E-isomer)<br>
through a reflux treatment in acetic acid in the presence of<br>
an appropriate acid catalyst such as p-toluenesulfonic acid for<br>
1 to 24 hours. However, these documents do not describe<br>
isomerization from the E- to the Z-isomer.<br>
Further, J. Med. Chem., 35, 2074-2084 (1992) describes<br>
that methyl 11-(3'-dimethylaminopropylidene)-6,11-<br>
dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-acetate is saponified to obtain a<br>
corresponding carboxylic acid as a mixture of E/Z isomers (E:Z<br>
= 1:2), and the E-isomer is isolated from the mixture through<br>
a column, and then, an acetic acid solution of the E-isomer is<br>
heated at 100°C in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid for<br>
21 hours to cause isomerization, whereby a mixture of E/Z<br>
isomers (E:Z = 65:35) is obtained.<br>
However, a method capable of more efficiently obtaining<br>
the objective Z-isomer has not been found yet.<br>

Hereinafter, the invention will be described in detail.<br>
(Step 1) Compound [III] + Compound [IV] → Compound [I]<br>
Compound [I] can be produced by a reaction of Compound<br>
[III] with Compound [IV].<br>
Examples of a solvent used in the reaction include ethers<br>
(such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether and diisopropyl ether) ,<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons (such as toluene and xylene) and the like,<br>
and mixed solvents thereof, and a reaction temperature is<br>
generally from 0 to 50°C.<br>
The Compound [IV] (that is, a<br><br>
3-dimethylaminopropylmagnesium halide) used here can be<br>
produced from, for example, a 3-dimethylaminopropylhalide<br>
(3-dimethylaminopropyl chloride or bromide) and magnesium.<br>
The Compound [IV] is used in an amount of generally from 1 to<br>
2 mol, preferably from 1.1 to 1.7 mol per mol of the Compound<br>
[III] . It is preferred that the reaction is performed by<br>
dissolving the Compound [IV] in an appropriate solvent (such<br>
as tetrahydrofuran or a toluene/tetrahydrofuran mixed solvent)<br>
at a concentration of about 10 to 40% and gradually adding<br>
dropwise the obtained solution to a solution of the Compound<br>
[III] in a solvent (such as tetrahydrofuran). The temperature<br>
of the liquid at the time of dropwise addition is generally from<br>
0 to 50°C, preferably from 10 to 30°C. The dropwise addition<br>
time is generally from 1 to 10 hours, preferably from 1 to 3<br>
hours. Further, it is preferred that stirring is performed for<br>
about 0.5 to 5 hours after completion of the dropwise addition<br>
for allowing the reaction to sufficiently proceed.<br>
After it is confirmed that the reaction has sufficiently<br>
proceeded according to the above procedure, by performing a<br>
common post-treatment method, for example, a procedure such as<br>
extraction, liquid layer separation, washing, drying<br>
(dehydration) , concentration and the like, the Compound [I] can<br>
be isolated.<br>
(Step 2) Compound [I] → Compound [II]<br><br>
Compound [II] can be produced by heating the Compound [I]<br>
in a solvent in the presence of an acid.<br>
Examples of the acid include hydrogen chloride and<br>
sulfuric acid, and hydrogen chloride is preferred. Hydrogen<br>
chloride may be used in a gaseous form or as hydrochloric acid.<br>
A used amount of the acid is preferably from about 1 to 5 mol<br>
per mol of the Compound [I].<br>
With regard to the solvent, an organic solvent or a<br>
mixture of an organic solvent and water is preferred. A mixing<br>
ratio of the organic solvent to water is generally from 10:1<br>
to 10:3 by volume. Examples of the organic solvent include<br>
esters (such as ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, butyl acetate,<br>
ethyl propionate, propyl propionate and butyl propionate),<br>
ethers (such as diethyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether,<br>
diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol dibutyl<br>
ether, diethylene glycol diethyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxyethane<br>
and tetrahydrofuran), amides (such as N,N-dimethylformamide,<br>
N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone and<br>
1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone), ketones (such as methyl<br>
isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexanone and<br>
cyclopentanone) , nitriles (such as acetonitrile and<br>
propionitrile), alcohols (such as methanol, ethanol,<br>
1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol and 2-butanol), halogenated<br>
hydrocarbons (such as methylene chloride, chloroform and<br>
chlorobenzene) , aromatic hydrocarbons (such as toluene and<br><br>
xylene) and nitrobenzene, and toluene is preferred. A used<br>
amount of the solvent is not particularly limited as long as<br>
it is an amount capable of completely dissolving the Compound<br>
[I], and, it is generally from 1 L to 5 L, preferably from 1.5<br>
L to 2.5 L based on 1 kg of the Compound [I].<br>
A heating temperature is generally from 50°C to 150°C,<br>
preferably from 80°C to 110°C. A reaction time depends on the<br>
temperature, used amount of the raw material or the like, and,<br>
it is generally from 0.5 hour to 20 hours, preferably from 2<br>
hours to 10 hours. This reaction is preferably performed under<br>
stirring. In this manner, the dehydration reaction and<br>
deesterif ication reaction of the Compound [I] and isomerization<br>
from the E- to the Z-isomer of the produced compound proceed.<br>
In the case where hydrogen chloride gas is used as the<br>
acid, it is preferred that the reaction is performed in an<br>
autoclave. Further, in the case where hydrochloric acid or<br>
sulfuric acid is used as the acid, it is preferred that water<br>
is azeotropically distilled off for the purpose of accelerating<br>
the isomerization reaction after heating. The azeotropic<br>
distillation of water can be performed by using a known<br>
distillation method, for example, with a Dean-Stark apparatus.<br>
In the reaction solution from which water has been<br>
azeotropically distilled off, the Compound [II] rich in the<br>
Z-isomer is present; however, by distilling off the solvent from<br>
the reaction solution, the Compound [II] can be obtained as an<br><br>
acid addition salt corresponding to the acid used.<br>
Purification can also be performed by recrystallization from<br>
an appropriate solvent (for example, a mixed solvent of acetone<br>
and water).<br>
Further, the acid addition salt of the Compound [II] can<br>
be converted into the acid-free Compound [II] by an alkali<br>
treatment using a common procedure.<br>
The Compound [III] which is the raw material compound of<br>
the invention can be produced by a reaction of (11-oxo-6,11-<br>
dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-yl)acetic acid produced according<br>
to a method described in J. Med. Chem. 19, 941 (1976), J. Med.<br>
Chem. 20, 1499 (1977) or JP-A-58-21679 with a compound<br>
represented by:<br><br>
(wherein R1, R2 and R3 have the same meanings as above) in the<br>
presence of a dehydrating agent such as trifluoroacetic<br>
anhydride or an acid catalyst according to a known tertiary<br>
esterification method.<br>
Examples<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to Examples; however, the invention is not limited<br>
to these. A ratio of E- to Z-isomers of the produced compound<br>
was determined based on a value measured by high performance<br><br>
liquid chromatography (HPLC). In the following Examples, %<br>
other than an area percent indicating a purity determined by<br>
HPLC refers to % by weight.<br>
Example 1<br>
Production of t-butyl 11-hydroxy-ll-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-<br>

3-dimethylaminopropyl chloride hydrochloride, 143 g of water,<br>
110 ml of toluene and 146. 4 g of a 25% aqueous solution of sodium<br>
hydroxide were added, and the mixture was stirred at about 25°C<br>
for 30 minutes. To the separated organic layer, 16.8 g of<br>
potassium carbonate was added to dehydrate the organic layer,<br>
which was then filtered. The residue was washed with 60 ml of<br>
toluene, and the filtrate and the washings were combined,<br>
whereby a toluene solution of 3-dimethylaminopropyl chloride<br>
was prepared.<br>
• Ten milliliters (10 ml) of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 0.73<br>
g of magnesium were mixed, and 0.1 g of 1, 2-dibromethane was<br>
added to activate magnesium. Then, 11.6 g of the obtained<br>
toluene solution of 3-dimethylaminopropyl chloride was added<br>
dropwise thereto at 37 to 39°C over 30 minutes. The mixture<br>
was stirred at 50°C for 1 hour, whereby a Grignard reagent was<br>
prepared.<br>
To a solution of 6.4 g (0.02 mol) of t-butyl<br>
(11-oxo-6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-yl)acetate<br><br>
dissolved in 35 ml of tetrahydrofuran, the thus obtained<br>
Grignard reagent was added dropwise at 15 to 20°C over about<br>
1 hour. The mixture was stirred at the same temperature for<br>
30 minutes, and the resulting reaction mixture was poured into<br>
a mixed liquid of 30 ml of water and 5.4 g of acetic acid. Then,<br>
28% aqueous ammonia was added thereto to adjust the pH of the<br>
mixture to 9.6, and the mixture was subjected to liquid layer<br>
separation. The separated organic layer was washed with 50 ml<br>
of a 15% saline solution and then concentrated, whereby 8.04<br>
g of t-butyl 11—hydroxy-11-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-6,11-<br>
dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-acetate was obtained. The<br>
apparent yield was 97.7%.<br>

11-hydroxy-ll-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,<br><br>
e] oxepin-2-acetate and 20 ml of toluene were charged, and 3.8<br>
g (0.03645 mol) of 35% hydrochloric acid was added thereto. A<br>
ratio of E- to Z-isomers in the resulting reaction mixture was<br>
85:15. This reaction mixture was stirred on a bath at a<br>
temperature between 100 and 105°C for 14 hours (reflux was<br>
initiated when the interior temperature reached 88°C and the<br>
temperature rose to 95°C) . A ratio of E- to Z-isomers at this<br>
time was 66:33. Further, a Dean-Stark apparatus was attached<br>
thereto and water was azeotropically distilled off (distilled<br>
amount: about 10 ml of toluene and about 1 ml of water) . The<br>
resulting reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and<br>
the solvent was removed. To the residue, 100 ml of acetone and<br>
1 ml of water were added, and the mixture was stirred for 4 hours .<br>
Then, the mixture was cooled to 5°C followed by filtration, and<br>
the resulting crystals were washed with 10 ml of cold acetone.<br>
The washed crystals were dried at 50°C, whereby 4.6 g of<br>
olopatadine hydrochloride was obtained. The purity measured<br>
by HPLC was determined to be 91.8% for the Z-isomer and 5.8%<br>
for the E-isomer.<br>

hermetically sealed and the mixture was stirred at a temperature<br>
between 90°C and 97°C for 8 hours, and then, the resulting<br>
reaction mixture was cooled to 25°C. A ratio of E- to Z-isomers<br>
at this time was 3.5 : 96.5. The reaction mixture was diluted<br>
by adding 10 ml of toluene thereto followed by filtration, and<br>
the resulting crystals were washed with 20 ml of toluene and<br>
then with 10 ml of acetone. The washed crystals were dried at<br>
