FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present disclosure relates to method of monitoring oil pressure and system<br>
for adaptively detecting an oil pressure fault within an internal combustion<br>
engine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The statements in this section merely provide background information related to<br>
the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
Internal combustion engines induce combustion of an air and fuel mixture to<br>
generate drive torque. More specifically, air is drawn into the engine through a<br>
throttle and is distributed to cylinders. The air is mixed with fuel and the air and<br>
fuel mixture is combusted within the cylinders to reciprocally, drive pistons, which<br>
rotatably drive a crankshaft. Besides the reciprocally driven pistons, there are<br>
multiple moving components within the engine that enable and regulate the<br>
combustion process including, but not limited to, the intake and exhaust<br>
valvetrains.<br>
In order to ensure proper operation and reduced wear of the internal<br>
components, lubricating oil is circulated through the engine. More specifically, an<br>
oil pump pumps oil from an oil pan through the engine. After the oil has been<br>
circulated through the engine, it collects within the oil pan. An oil filter is also<br>
provided in order to filter the oil before it circulates through the engine.<br>
Oil pressure is typically monitored to ensure that it is within an appropriate<br>
operating range. More specifically, an oil pressure sensor is typically provided<br><br><br>
 and is responsive to the oil. pressure. An excessively high of low oil pressure can<br>
be detrimental to the engine components and can result from degraded oil, a<br>
change in oil viscosity, use of an inappropriate oil filter, a low oil level,<br>
mechanical hardware malfunction, among other reasons.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present disclosure provides a method of monitoring an oil pressure of oil<br>
that is implemented within an internal combustion engine. The method includes<br>
determining an expected oil pressure value based on engine operating conditions<br>
and monitoring an actual oil pressure value based on a signal generated by an oil<br>
pressure sensor. A difference between the expected oil pressure value and the<br>
actual oil pressure value is calculated and is compared to a threshold difference.<br>
A diagnostic trouble code is generated when the difference exceeds the<br>
threshold difference.<br>
In other features, the method further includes trimming the expected oil<br>
pressure value based on at least one of the differences and a parameter of the<br>
engine. The method parameter includes at least one of a mileage, engine load, a<br>
cumulative number of combustion events, a cumulative number of engine starts,<br>
time and monitored temperature cycles.<br>
In other features, the expected oil pressure value is determined from a look-up<br>
table. Expected oil pressure values that are stored within the look-up table are<br>
selectively trimmed.<br><br>
In another feature, the method further includes determining whether an oil<br>
change has occurred and trimming the expected oil pressure value based on the<br>
difference if the oil change has not occurred.<br>
In another feature, the method further includes determining whether a mileage,<br>
over which the engine has operated, exceeds a threshold mileage and trimming<br>
the expected oil pressure value based on the difference if the mileage is less<br>
than a pre-determined value.<br>
In still another feature, the method further includes determining whether an<br>
engine speed is steady. The expected oil pressure value is determined only when<br>
the speed is steady.	<br>
In yet another feature, the engine operating conditions include an engine speed<br>
and an engine temperature.<br>
Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the description provided<br>
herein. It should be understood that the description and specific examples are<br>
intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope<br>
of the present disclosure.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:<br>

intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure in any way.<br>

engine;<br><br>

disclosure;<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way<br>
intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of clarity,<br>
the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify similar<br>
elements. As used herein, the term module refers to an application specific<br>
integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or<br>
group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware programs, a<br>
combinational logic circuit, or other suitable components that provide the<br>
described functionality.<br>
Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary engine system (10) is illustrated. The<br>
exemplary engine system (10) includes an engine (12), an intake manifold (14)<br>
and an exhaust manifold (16). Air is drawn into the intake manifold (14) through<br>
a throttle (18) and is distributed to cylinders (20). The air is mixed with fuel and<br>
the air and fuel mixture is combusted within the cylinders 20 to reciprocally drive<br>
pistons (not shown), which rotatably drive a crankshaft (22). Although two<br><br>
 cylinders are shown, it is anticipated that the engine system (10) can include<br>
more or fewer cylinders (20).<br>
A control module (30) monitors various engine operating parameters. For<br>
example, an engine speed sensor (32) monitors an engine speed (RPMENG) and<br>
generates a corresponding signal that is received by the control module (30). An<br>
oil pressure sensor (34) and an engine temperature sensor (36) monitor an<br>
actual oil pressure (POILACT) and an engine temperature (TENG), respectively, and<br>
generate corresponding signals that are received by the control module (30).<br>
TENG can be determined based on a temperature of a cooling fluid that is<br>
circulated through the engine and/or a temperature of the oil that is circulated<br>
through the engine. Alternatively, TENG can be predicted using an engine<br>
temperature algorithm (e.g., a virtual engine temperature sensor), thereby<br>
eliminating the need for the engine temperature sensor (36).<br>
It is anticipated that the adaptive oil pressure fault detection control of the<br>
present disclosure can be implemented in any engine type including, but not<br>
limited to, the exemplary engine system described herein. For example, the<br>
adaptive oil pressure fault detection can be implemented in an active fuel<br>
management (AFM) engine, in which one or more cylinders are selectively<br>
deactivated.<br>
In such an engine system, operation using all of the engine cylinders is referred<br>
to as an activated mode, and a deactivated mode refers to operation using less<br>
than all of the cylinders of the engine (one or more cylinders not active). In the<br>
deactivated mode, there are fewer cylinder operating. As a result, there is less<br><br>
 drive torque available to, drive the vehicle driveline and accessories (e.g.,<br>
alternator, coolant pump, A/C compressor). Engine efficiency, however, is<br>
increased as a result of decreased fuel consumption (i.e., no fuel supplied to the<br>
deactivated cylinders) and decreased engine pumping. Because the deactivated<br>
cylinders do not take in air, overall engine pumping losses are reduced.<br>
The adaptive oil pressure fault detection control of the present disclosure detects<br>
an oil pressure fault based on a comparison of the sensed oil pressure (POILACT)<br>
and an expected oil pressure (POILEXP). POILEXP is determined based on the engine<br>
operating conditions. Exemplary engine operating conditions include TENG and<br>
RPMENG- POILEXP can be determined from a look-up table using the engine<br>
operating conditions as inputs to the look-up table.<br>
The adaptive oil pressure fault detection control also includes an adaptive<br>
learning function, which trims the initial values of POILEXP during the early life of<br>
the engine with known oil quantities and qualities (e.g., factory oil fill). The<br>
adaptive learning function refines POILEXP for each individual engine system. The<br>
adaptive oil pressure fault detection control can also to adjust the POILEXP look-up<br>
table based on a normal use degradation value. The degradation value can be<br>
based on simple vehicle parameters including, but not limited to, vehicle mileage.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, more complicated algorithms that monitor more<br>
detailed vehicle parameters including, but not limited to, engine load, the<br>
number of combustion events, the number of engine starts, temperature cycles<br>
and the like can be implemented. For example, the oil degradation factor can be<br>
determined by an oil life monitor, which indicates when to change the oil.<br><br>
 Parameters including, but not limited to, engine RPM and oil temperature can be<br>
used to determine the relative life of the oil.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the adaptive oil pressure fault detection control<br>
determines whether the engine is operating at a steady speed. Because POILACT<br>
lags RPMENG, execution of the adaptive oil pressure fault detection control<br>
assures that POILACT has stabilized for the prevailing RPMENG. Whether the engine<br>
is operating at steady speed can be determined, for example, by monitoring<br>
RPMENG over a threshold time period. If a difference (ARPMENG) between a<br>
maximum RPMENG value occurring during the threshold time period and a<br>
minimum RPMENG value occurring during the threshold time period is less than or<br>
equal to a threshold difference (ARPMTHR), the engine is deemed to be operating<br>
at steady speed. If ARPMENG is greater than or equal ARPMTHR, the engine is<br>
deemed to not be operating at steady speed.<br>
If the engine is deemed to be operating at steady speed, values for the current<br>
RPMENG and TOIL, for example. In the case of a look-up table, the look-up table is<br>
comprised of cells defined by RPMENG on one axis and Ton on another. An<br>
exemplary portion of such a look-up is illustrated in Figure 2. The values in the<br>
cells represent POILEXP and tolerance for the prevailing engine conditions. The<br>
look-up table is initially populated based on expected new engine oil pressure<br>
with the factory fill oil and oil filter. The tolerance accounts for variance due to<br>
factors including, but not limited to, oil life, usage (e.g., oxidation, fuel dilution<br>
and the like), oil characteristics (e.g., viscosity, additives and the like), oil filter<br>
characteristics (e.g., pressure drop variables) and variations in the oil pressure<br><br>
 reading signal string, which includes the oil pressure sensor. The size of the cells<br>
can be symmetric or cells in selected areas can have either increased or decrease<br>
granularity.<br>
The adaptive oil pressure fault detection control determines a difference (ΔPOIL)<br>
between POILEXP and POILACT. If ΔPOIL is greater than a threshold difference<br>
APOILTHR, either positive or negative, an oil pressure error diagnostic trouble code<br>
(DTC) is set. If ΔPOIL is within less than or equal to ΔPOILTHR, POILACT is as is<br>
expected and no DTC is set. Some of the failures that can induce setting of the<br>
DTC include, but are not limited to, premature engine wear, oil pressure leak,<br>
low oil pressure, oil filter problems, faulty oil pressure sensor, non-compatible oil<br>
fill, wrong oil type and/or coolant in the oil.<br>
In a further feature, if ΔPOIL is within less than or equal to ΔPOILTHR, the adaptive<br>
oil pressure fault detection control determines whether the engine oil has been<br>
changed from the factory fill, whether the vehicle has been run less than a<br>
threshold time in total (e.g., the total hours that the engine has been run less<br>
than a threshold time in total (e.g., the total hours that the engine has been run<br>
is less than a threshold number of hours). If any or each of these conditions is<br>
true, a trim block array around and including the specific POILEXP cell is adjusted<br>
based on ΔPOIL. More specifically, the trim block array including the specific<br>
POILEXP cell is adjusted in the direction of ΔPoil (e.g., positive or negative) by a<br>
predetermined percent of ΔPOIL. If any or each of these conditions is not true,<br>
the look-up table values are not trimmed. Instead, the basic engine<br>
characteristics can be mapped and used for future reference.<br><br>
. In the case of aft active fuel management (AFM) type engine system, the<br>
adaptive oil pressure fault detection can be implemented to selectively prohibit<br>
deactivation of the cylinders. More specifically, if the DTC is set, as described<br>
above, deactivation of the cylinders is prohibited. By disabling deactivation of the<br>
cylinders during this fault mode, engine damage resulting from mistimed valve<br>
lifter events can be prevented. For example, it has been demonstrated that an<br>
improper oil viscosity can affect the response time of the actuation system,<br>
which is implemented to enable AFM.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, exemplary steps that are executed by the adaptive oil<br>
pressure fault detection control will be described in detail. In step 300, control<br>
determines whether RPMENG is steady. If RPMENG is not steady, control ends. If<br>
RPMENG is steady, control trims the PEXPOIL values based on the oil degradation, as<br>
discussed in detail above, in step 302. It is anticipated, however, that step 302<br>
can be forgone if so desired. In step 304, control determines POILEXP based on<br>
TENG and RPMENG.<br>
Control determines ΔPOIL in step 306. In step 308, control determines whether <br>
ΔPoil is greater than ΔPOILTHR- If ΔPoil is greater than ΔPOILTHR, control sets a DTC<br>
in step 310 and control ends. If the absolute value of ΔPoil is not greater than<br>
ΔPOILTHR/ control continues in step 312. In step 312, control determines whether<br>
the first oil change has occurred. If the first oil change has not occurred, control<br>
ends. If the first oil change has occurred, continues in step 314. In step 314,<br>
control determines whether the mileage is less than a threshold mileage. If the<br>
mileage is not less than the threshold mileage, control ends. If the mileage is<br><br>
 less than the threshold mileage, control trims the POILEXP values based on ΔPOIL in<br>
step 316 and control ends.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4, exemplary modules that execute the adaptive oil<br>
pressure fault detection control will be described in detail. The exemplary<br>
modules include an RPMENG steady module (400), a POILEXP module (402), a<br>
summer module (404), a comparator module (406), a DTC module (408) and a<br>
trim module (410). The RPMENG steady module (400) determines whether RPMENG<br>
is steady and generates a corresponding signal. The POILEXP module (402)<br>
determines POILEXP based on RPMENG and TENG if it receives the signal generated<br>
by the RPMENG steady module (400). The POILEXP values stored within the POILEXP<br>
module (402) can be selectively trimmed, as described in detail above, based on<br>
a signal generated by the trim module (410).<br>
The summer module (404) determines ΔPOil based on POILEXP and POILACT- ΔPOIL <br>
and ΔPTHR are input to the comparator module (406). If ΔPOil is greater than<br>
APTHR, the comparator module (406) generates a corresponding signal (e.g., 1).<br>
If ΔPoil is not greater than ΔPTHR, the comparator module (406) generates a<br>
corresponding signal (e.g., 0). The DTC module (408) selectively sets the DTC<br>
based on the signal output from the comparator module (406). The trim module<br>
(410) selectively generates a trim signal that is output to the POILEXP module<br>
(402). The trim signal can be generated based on ΔPOIL, mileage and/or<br>
cumulative engine operating time, as described in detail above.<br>
The adaptive oil pressure fault detection control of the present disclosure<br>
provides more accurate oil pressure fault detection than tradition fault detection<br><br>
 methods. This is at least partially achieved through trimming of the expected oil<br>
pressure values, as described in detail above. Furthermore, the adaptive oil<br>
pressure fault detection control described herein can be implemented in<br>
traditional engine systems without requiring additional vehicle hardware and the<br>
signal processing required to execute the control is not obtrusive to the<br>
mechanical operation of the engine system. Not only can engine failure due to<br>
lack of oil pressure be detected and avoided, other potential engine problems<br>
including, but not limited to, coolant in the oil, for example, can be detected<br>
before being detrimental to the engine system.<br>
Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing description that<br>
the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be implemented in a variety of<br>
forms. Therefore, while the disclosure has been described in connection with<br>
particular examples thereof, the true scope of the disclosure should not be so<br>
limited since other modifications will become apparent to the skilled practitioner<br>
