DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION <br>
The process of the present invention may be carried out according to Schemes 1-4 below and the description that follows. In the following Schemes, unless otherwise indicated,<br>
substituents R3, R4,R8 and R15 are as defined above.<br>

Oxidation<br><br>
The compound of formula 4, used as a starting material for the processes of the<br>
present invention is readily prepared from compound 5, i.e., in which R4 is hydrogen, see,<br>
WO 98/56802, and United States patents 4,328,334, 4,474,768 and 4,517,359, all of which<br>
are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
5	The Schemes given above are illustrative only and are described in further detail<br>
below and in the Examples further here in below.   In Scheme 1, the epoxide of formula 2 is<br>
converted to an amine of formula _1, wherein R3 is –CH2NR15R8 wherein R15 and R8 are as<br>
defined  above.  In the most preferred embodiment of the invention, the amine is n-<br>
propylamine, i.e., R8 is n-propyl and R15 is H.<br>
10	To prepare a compound of formula 1,   the compound of formula 2 is preferably<br>
treated with a compound of the formula HNR15R8, wherein R15 and R8 are as defined<br>
above, in the presence of an appropriate solvent such as isopropanol, or a mixture of organic<br>
solvents comprising isopropanol, preferably at a temperature of from about 40°C to about<br>
95°C. The most preferred temperature to perform the reaction is from about 50°C to about<br>
15	55°C, but higher temperatures may also be used, e.g., 76°C. The most preferred pressure to<br>
perform the reaction is at about atmospheric pressure; however, the reaction may also be performed at elevated pressures.<br>
in one previous method of opening the epoxide of formula 2 (see, WO 98/56802,<br>
Examples 48, 50, 51 and 70) the 2'-hydroxy group was protected, and the production of the<br>
20	compound of formula 1 (or formula la, respectively) required the simultaneous hydrolysis of<br>
the protecting group and the amination of the epoxide. This process was not preferred<br>
because performing the hydrolysis during the epoxide opening step is inefficient, and<br>
isolation of the compound of formula 1 was made more difficult due to the presence of the<br>
un-hydrolysed protecting group and other impurities. In another previous method, the<br>
25	compound of formula 2 (in which the 2'-hydroxy is not protected),   was reacted with pure<br>
alkylamine, i.e., without organic solvent. In this case, the reaction proceeded slowly at the<br>
normal boiling temperature of n-propylamine (about 48°C). Consequently, in order to produce<br>
an elevated temperature, the reaction was run at elevated pressure, a less preferred feature<br>
at commercial scale. (See, WO 98/56802, Example 8 (Preparation 2), having a yield of 11 %).<br>
30	In addition, a catalyst was used in the reaction. Applicants made the discovery that a mixture<br>
of n-propylamine and isopropanol has a boiling point, at ambient atmospheric pressure, of<br>
about 76°C, which allows the reaction to proceed at high yield (over 85%), at a temperature of<br>
about 50°C to 55°C, without the use of a pressurized reaction vessel or catalyst(s).<br>
Applicants' method provides high yield (85%) and a better purity profile than earlier methods,<br>
35	and allows a variety of crystallization procedures for both the free base form and acid salts of<br>
the compound of formula 1, to afford the compound of formula 1 in highly purified form such as is desirable for use in parenteral formulations.<br><br>
In Scheme 2, the compound of formula 2 may be prepared by treating the compound of formula 3 with a sulfur methylide, at a temperature of from about -80°C to about -45°C, followed by removal of the 2'-protecting group by conventional methods, to provide the compound of formula 2. The starting material for the process of Scheme 2 is preferably the trifluoroacetic acid addition salt of the compound of formula 3, which is first converted to the free base form, cooled to low temperature, about -70°C, and then reacted with a low-temperature solution of the sulfur methylide. The sulfur methylide is preferably a dimethylsulfonium methylide, e.g., (CH3)2S+CH2 prepared by conventional means, e.g., by<br>
treating a trimethylsulfonium salt, e.g., (CH3)3,SX,  wherein X is halo, preferably bromo, or a<br>
sulfonate, more preferably trimethylsulfonium bromide, with an activating agent such as potassium hydroxide, potassium tert-butoxide, sodium tert-butoxide, potassium ethoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium hexamethyldisilazide (KHMDS) or sodium methoxide, preferably potassium tert-butoxide, in an ether solvent such as THF, or in CH2CI2, DMF, or DMSO, or a mixture of two or more of the foregoing solvents.    The protecting group is removed by<br>
conventional means, e.g., catalytic hydrogenation when R^ is CBZ.<br>
In Scheme 3, the 4" ketone is prepared from the compound of formula 5 in a single-vessel, continuous process. In the first step of the process, the 2' hydroxy group is selectively protected by conventional means, preferably by treating the 2'-hydroxy of formula 5, wherein<br>
R4 is hydrogen, with benzylchloroformate in dichloromethane to yield the compound of<br>
formula 4 wherein R4 is benzyloxycarbonyl ("CBZ"). Preferably, at least 2 molar equivalents of benzylchloroformate are used, in order to ensure complete conversion of the 2'-hydroxy group to its protected form. Dichloromethane is preferred as solvent, wherein the reaction is performed using at least 15 volumes of dichloromethane relative to the volume of starting material, thus minimizing the formation of bis-CBZ impurities. The compound of formula 4, wherein R4 is CBZ, may be isolated as its dibenzoyl-D-tartrate salt, which allows purging of potential bis-CBZ impurity. However, aqueous extractive workup of the compound of formula 4 is not preferred, because the isolated product is unstable due to the presence of a benzylamine formed by amine alkylation of the compound of formula 4 by benzylchloride (formed by the decomposition of benzylchloroformate). Accordingly, after the protection step the reaction mixture is preferably carried forward directly to the second step without isolation of the compound of formula 4. The second step, which may be carried out in the same vessel as the first step, comprises oxidation of the 4"-hydroxyl group to yield the 4"-ketone of formula 3. The oxidation is preferably an activated-DMSO oxidation as described above, i.e., performed at reduced temperature, e.g., -60 to -70°C, and involving activation of the DMSO in situ by adding trifluoroacetic anhydride to the chilled solution of the compound in DMSO, followed by addition of triethylamine. The reaction mixture is then added to water and gradually warmed to ambient temperature. The mixture is preferably washed in water to yield a solution of the compound of formula 3.<br><br>
The   trifluoroacetic acid salt of the compound of formula 3 may be prepared by<br>
washing the reaction mixture of the oxidation step with water, followed by addition of<br>
trifluoroacetic acid and then a solvent suitable for crystallization of the salt, for example<br>
isopropanol or a mixture of methylene chloride and methyl tert-butyl ether ("MTBE"). Other	acid addition salts, such as the dibenzoyl-D-tartrate salt and the phosphate salt, may also beprepared, in a conventional manner. The dibenzoyl-D-tartrate and phosphate salts are useful in the processes of the invention, but are less preferred compared to trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
As shown in Scheme 4, altogether the invention relates to a process for preparing the<br>
compound of formula 1 in two stages: in the first stage, the compound of formula 3 is<br>
prepared in a single-vessel process involving benzyloxycarbonyl protection of the 2'-hydroxy<br>
group of the compound of formula 5 to yield the compound of formula 4, followed directly by<br>
oxidation of the 4"-hydroxy group of 4 to yield the ketone of formula 3, which is preferably<br>
isolated as its trifluoroacetic acid addition salt. In the second stage, the free base form of<br>
the compound of formula 3 (preferably prepared from its trifluoroacetic acid salt) is converted	to the 4"-epoxide of formula 2, the 2'-protecting group is removed to restore the 2'-hydroxy,and the epoxide is opened with an amine by heating in a mixture containing isopropanol, to yield the compound of formula <br><br><br><br>

The compounds prepared by the processes of the present invention that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids.    Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to mammals, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate a compound prepared by the processes  of the present invention  from  the reaction  mixture  as  a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent, for use in subsequently reactions or for the preparation of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds prepared by the processes of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent.  Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is readily obtained.    The desired salt can also be precipitated from a solution of the free base in an organic solvent by adding to the solution an appropriate mineral or organic acid. The compounds of formula 1 prepared by the processes of this invention, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof (hereinafter "the active compounds"), may be administered through oral, parenteral, topical, or rectal routes in the treatment of bacterial and protozoa infections.<br>
In general, the active compounds are most desirably administered in dosages ranging from about 0.2 mg per kg body weight per day (mg/kg/day) to about 200 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses (i.e., from 1 to 4 doses per day), although variations will necessarily occur depending upon the species, weight and condition of the subject being treated and the particular route of administration chosen. However, a dosage level that is in the range of about 4 mg/kg/day to about 50 mg/kg/day is most desirably employed. Variations may nevertheless occur depending upon the species of mammal, fish or bird being treated and its individual response to said medicament, as well as on the type of pharmaceutical formulation chosen and the time period and interval at which such administration is carried out. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effects, provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day.<br>
The active compounds may be administered alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents by the routes previously indicated, and such administration may be carried out in single or multiple doses. More particularly, the active compounds may be administered in a wide variety of different dosage forms, i.e., they may be combined with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, hard candies, powders, sprays, creams, salves, suppositories, jellies, gels, pastes, lotions, ointments, aqueous suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs, syrups, and the like. Such carriers include solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous media and various non-toxic organic solvents, etc.  Moreover, oral pharmaceutical compositions can be<br><br>
suitably sweetened and/or flavored.   In general, the active compounds are present in such dosage forms at concentration levels ranging from about 5.0% to about 70% by weight.<br>
            For oral administration, tablets containing various excipients such as microcrystalline<br>
cellulose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate and glycine may be<br>
employed along with various disintegrants such as starch (and preferably corn, potato or<br>
tapioca starch), alginic acid and certain complex silicates, together with granulation binders<br>
like polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as<br>
magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tabletting<br>
purposes.   Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin<br>
capsules; preferred materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as<br>
high molecular weight polyethylene glycols.   When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are<br>
desired for oral administration,  the active compound  may be combined with various<br>
sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes, and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or<br>
suspending agents as well, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol,<br>
glycerin and various like combinations thereof.<br>
For parenteral administration, solutions of an active compound in either sesame or<br>
peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol may be employed.  The aqueous solutions should<br>
be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic. These aqueous<br>
solutions are suitable for intravenous injection purposes.  The oily solutions are suitable for<br>
intraarticular, intramuscular and subcutaneous injection purposes.   The preparation of all<br>
these solutions under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques will known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Additionally, it is also possible to administer the active compounds of the present<br>
invention topically and this may be done by way of creams, jellies, gels, pastes, patches,<br>
ointments and the like, in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>
              For administration to animals other than humans, such as cattle or domestic<br>
Animals the active compounds may be administered in the feed of the animals or orally as a drench composition.<br>
           The active compounds may also be administered in the form of liposome delivery<br>
systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar<br>
vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines.<br>
          The active compounds may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug<br>
carriers. Such    polymers    can    include    polyvinylpyrrolidone,    pyran    copolymer,<br>
polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamide      phenyl,       polyhydroxyethylaspartamide-phenol,       or<br>
polyethyleneoxide-polylysine substituted with palmitoylresidues. Furthermore, the active compounds may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, copolymers of polylactic   and   polyglycolic   acid,   polyepsilon   caprolactone,   polyhydroxy   butyric   acid,<br><br>
/<br>
polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans,  polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.<br>

invention. It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the specific details<br>
