				<td>Simultaneous operation of interfaces<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a method for the simultaneous operation of<br>
two interfaces of a portable data carrier as well as such a data carrier, in particular a<br>
chip card, a secure multimedia card, a mobile radio card or the like.<br>
[0002] Present developments in the field of portable data carriers, such as e.g. chip<br>
cards and the like, for more flexible application possibilities use a plurality of<br>
physically independent interfaces. In particular, portable data carriers can be provided<br>
with a conventional contact-type interface as well as an additional contactless<br>
interface, e.g. an antenna device for a radio link. The actual data communication then<br>
is carried out with the help of respective contact-type communications protocols (in<br>
the field of chip cards and mobile radio communications e.g. T=0, T=l) and/or<br>
contactless communications protocols (e.g. T=CL) with an external communication<br>
unit, with which the data carrier is in a communication connection.<br>
[0003] Both, the operating systems and control systems available for portable data<br>
carriers having a contact-type and a contactless interface and the data communication<br>
modes presently supported by the multiple read/write units and communication units,<br>
however, exclusively admit only one data communication at a time either via the<br>
contact-type or via the contactless interface. But this is disadvantageous in situations,<br>
in which during a data communication via one of the two interfaces, via the other<br>
interface there starts a further data communication, which is not repeatable at a later<br>
point in time. Such a scenario is given with a portable data carrier formed as a mobile<br>
radio card, for example, when via the contact-type interface there is made a mobile<br>
phone call and meanwhile via the contactless interface a payment transaction, e.g. in<br>
public transport, is to be handled. For other types of portable data carriers other<br>
scenarios are thinkable respectively.<br>
[0004] An obvious solution of this problem is to install a real-time multitasking<br>
operating system on the portable data carrier, in order to realize a simultaneous data<br>
communication via the two interfaces as concurrent, virtually parallel processes. At<br>
present, however, this solution is not realistic in view of the limited resources of<br><br>
portable data carriers and in many cases also not required for the normal use of such<br>
data carriers.<br>
[0005] US 6,105,874 discloses a portable data carrier with a contact-type and a<br>
contactless interface, which switches between the two interfaces with the help of an<br>
OR logic. But when the two interfaces are active at the same time the OR operation<br>
leads to data losses. US 6,045,043 discloses a double interface apparatus, with which a<br>
contactless data communication is started, as soon as a magnetic field is present at the<br>
contactless interface, independent of the respective state of the contact-type interface.<br>
Such preferential treatment of the contactless interface, however, leads to<br>
disadvantages with respect to the stability of contact-type data communications.<br>
[0006] Therefore, it is an object of the present invention, that a contact-type and a<br>
contactless interface of a portable data carrier can be simultaneously and reliably<br>
operated.<br>
[0007] This problem is solved according to the invention by a method and an<br>
apparatus having the features of the independent claims. The dependent claims<br>
describe advantageous embodiments and developments of the invention.<br>
[0008] In the following one starts out from the situation that with a portable data<br>
carrier, which is provided with a first interface device comprising a first interface and<br>
a second interface device comprising a second interface as well as with a processor,<br>
and that the first interface device carries out a data communication via the first<br>
interface, meanwhile a data communication is started via the second interface by the<br>
second interface device. Then a sequencing device of the data carrier sequences the<br>
competing data communications by interrupting the first data communication and<br>
starting the second data communication or by delaying the start of the second data<br>
communication. In this way the second data communication which starts during the<br>
first data communication can be processed virtually simultaneous to the first, without<br>
there occurring a data conflict or that one of the two data communications remains<br>
entirely disregarded because of a preferred treatment of the respective other data<br>
communication.<br><br>
[0009] The sequencing device coordinates the operation of the interface devices and<br>
that of the pertinent interfaces respectively in such a way that a sequential processing<br>
of simultaneous data communications is permitted. For this purpose the sequencing<br>
device sends a respective signal to the first interface device in order to signal to it that<br>
the first data communication carried out at that moment is to be interrupted, and a<br>
further signal to the second interface device in order to signal that the second data<br>
communication is to be started. Alternatively, the sequencing device sends a signal to<br>
the second interface device in order to signal that the second data communication is to<br>
be delayed, while the first interface device can continue the first data communication<br>
in an uninfluenced fashion.<br>
[0010] In case the first interface device is a contactless interface device with a<br>
contactless interface and the second interface device is a contact-type interface device<br>
with a contact-type interface, there results the situation, that during a running<br>
contactless data communication via the contactless interface a contact-type data<br>
communication via the contact-type interface is added. In this case in a first<br>
embodiment of the invention, after the running contactless data communication has<br>
been interrupted, the contact-type data communication is started and entirely<br>
completed, and subsequently the interrupted contactless data communication is<br>
continued. This is coordinated by the sequencing device sending respective signals to<br>
the contactless and the contact-type interface device. Here within the framework of the<br>
contact-type data communication an incoming block of messages or data is completely<br>
received by the contact-type interface device and stored in a FIFO (first in - first out)<br>
or other memory of the data carrier. This storage operation can be realized, for<br>
example, by a direct memory access (DMA) or in an interrupt-driven fashion. Such a<br>
block of messages or data to be completely stored in particular can be an instruction,<br>
which is sent by an external communication unit being in contact with the data carrier<br>
via the contact-type interface, e.g. by a command APDU (C-APDU; Application<br>
Protocol Data Unit) when using the T=l communications protocol.<br>
[0011] Within the framework of the contact-type data communication, in response<br>
to the incoming instruction, e.g. of a command APDU, a response, e.g. a respective<br>
response APDU (R-APDU) caused by the sequencing device, is sent via the contact-<br><br>
type interface to the external communication unit. For this within the framework of the<br>
T=l protocol a given response time (BWT; Block Waiting Time) between the<br>
incoming instruction and the sending of the respective response is provided, the data<br>
communication being aborted by the external communication unit when it does not<br>
receive any incoming response within the response time BWT. To avoid such a<br>
consequence after the end of the response time BWT, the sequencing device can give<br>
instructions to the contact-type interface device with the help of a respective signal as<br>
to direct an extension inquiry (WTX; Waiting Time Extension) to the external<br>
communication unit waiting, in order to extend the processing time for generating and<br>
sending the response required by the contact-type interface device.<br>
[0012] In a second embodiment of the present invention the start of the contact-type<br>
data communication is delayed until the already running contactless data<br>
communication is entirely completed. The delay of the start of the contact-type data<br>
communication is caused by the sequencing device with the help of a respective signal<br>
to the contact-type interface device. Thereupon, the contact-type interface device<br>
delays the contact-type data communication by ignoring a data input at the contact-<br>
type interface, by incoming data not being further processed. By ignoring/ not<br>
processing the data incoming at the contact-type interface, however, an asynchronous<br>
input buffer (UART; Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) disposed<br>
immediately downstream of the contact-type interface can overflow, since the<br>
incoming data exceed the (normally low) storage capacity of the UART buffer storage.<br>
[0013] This, however, is recognized after the completion of the contactless data<br>
communication by the sequencing device with the help of the state of the UART<br>
storage, so that a contact-type data communication started while the contactless data<br>
communication was carried out can be subsequently recognized. On the basis of the<br>
incorrect contact-type data communication determined in this way, the contact-type<br>
interface device is given instructions by a respective signal of the sequencing device as<br>
to send an error message to the external communication unit, so that it repeats the<br>
contact-type data communication. Then the contact-type data communication can be<br>
completely and undisturbed received by the contact-type interface device.<br><br>
[0014] The two above-mentioned embodiments are particularly suitable for chip<br>
cards and the like, the contact-type interface device of which works according to the<br>
block-based T=l communications protocol. In contrast to this, the following third<br>
embodiment can preferably be used within the framework of the T=0 communications<br>
protocol by the contact-type interface device of a chip card. In the third embodiment<br>
the contactless data communication is interrupted when the contact-type data<br>
communication is started, and only the header of an instruction (C-APDU) received<br>
within the framework of the contact-type data communication is received, which must<br>
not be lost in a contact-type data communication within the framework of the T=0<br>
protocol. In an incoming instruction in the form of a command APDU the header in<br>
the T=0 protocol consists of five bytes, which, caused by the sequencing device, are<br>
temporarily stored in a FIFO buffer (first-in first-out) or any other memory or memory<br>
area of the data carrier in particular by a direct memory access (DMA) or in an<br>
interrupt-driven fashion.<br>
[0015] After the receipt of the header the sequencing device again switches over to<br>
the temporarily deactivated contactless interface device, in order to continue the<br>
interrupted contactless data communication. After the completion of the continued<br>
contactless data communication, the contact-type data communication is continued by<br>
the contact-type interface device and finally completed. When interrupting the contact-<br>
type data communication after the receipt of the header, a predetermined interruption<br>
time (WWT, Work Waiting Time), which indicates the maximum duration of an<br>
interruption of the contact-type data communication, has to be observed. If the<br>
contactless data communication cannot be continued within this interruption time<br>
WWT, the interruption time WWT will be extended until the contactless data<br>
communication can be completed and the interrupted contact-type data communication<br>
can be continued. Interrupting, switching and continuing the data communications is<br>
coordinated by the sequencing device, which also monitors and, if necessary, extends<br>
the predetermined interruption time WWT of the contact-type data communication.<br>
[0016] While the three above-described embodiments are applicable, when a<br>
contact-type data communication starts during a running contactless data<br>
communication, in the following there are described two further embodiments for the<br><br>
opposite case, namely that a contactless data communication starts during a running<br>
contact-type data communication. In principle, the two following embodiments can be<br>
combined in any desired way with the three above-described embodiments.<br>
[0017] In the fourth embodiment the running contact-type data communication is<br>
interrupted by a waiting phase caused by the sequencing device, during which the<br>
sequencing device activates the contactless interface device. During this waiting phase,<br>
which preferably is arranged directly after the receipt of an instruction (e.g. a C-<br>
APDU) by the contact-type interface device and before the sending of a respective<br>
response (e.g. a R-APDU), the contactless interface device is ready-to-receive. If<br>
during the waiting phase a contactless data communication is not started, the contact-<br>
type interface device will be re-activated, which then can continue the contact-type<br>
data communication interrupted before. If, however, during the waiting phase a<br>
contactless data communication starts, such communication is completed by the<br>
contactless interface device, even when this exceeds the originally arranged waiting<br>
phase. In this case, the waiting phase is extended, caused by the sequencing device,<br>
until the contactless data communication is entirely completed.<br>
[0018] The waiting phase is realized by the contact-type interface device as a<br>
proactive phase, i.e. with the help of proactive commands, which reverse the master-<br>
slave relation between the external communication unit and the data carrier<br>
compulsory with the T=0 and T=l protocol, so that an instruction can be given by the<br>
data carrier, which is answered by the external communication unit. With the help of<br>
such proactive commands of the data carrier, from the external communication unit<br>
there can be requested, in principle, waiting-phases of any length to be used for other<br>
purposes during a contact-type data communication. This is possible in particular with<br>
the help of the FETCH command and the TERMINAL RESPONSE command, with<br>
the help of which an external communication unit can be caused to first fetch an<br>
instruction (e.g. the request for the waiting phase) at the data carrier and subsequently<br>
send a response to the instruction to the data carrier. With the help of such proactive<br>
commands in the case of a starting contactless data communication the waiting phase<br>
can be extended, caused by the sequencing device, until the contactless data<br>
communication is entirely completed. Since the mechanism of the proactive<br><br>
commands is provided within both the framework of the T=0 and of the T=l protocol,<br>
this fourth embodiment can be realized with the two protocols.<br>
[0019] With a fifth embodiment of the present invention the contactless interface is<br>
locked/ deactivated by the sequencing device until the already running contact-type<br>
data communication via the contact-type interface device is completed, i.e. an<br>
instruction (C-APDU) was received and a respective response (R-APDU) was sent.<br>
Here there is made use of the fact, that an external radio communication unit, which<br>
wants to establish a contactless data communication with the data carrier via the<br>
contactless interface device of the data carrier, recognizes by repeated polling when<br>
the contactless interface is unlocked/activated, in order to then start the contactless<br>
data communication. This embodiment is preferably used with the T=0 protocol, but<br>
can also be implemented in the T=l protocol.<br>
[0020] Further features and advantages of the invention appear from the following<br>
description of various embodiments and alternative embodiments according to the<br>
invention in connection with the accompanying Figures.<br>
[0021] Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of a chip card having a contact-<br>
type and a contactless interface;<br>
[0022] Figure 2 shows a flow chart of a sequencing process in the T=0 protocol;<br>
[0023] Figure 3 shows a flow chart of a first variant of a sequencing process in the<br>
T=l protocol;<br>
[0024] Figure 4 shows a flow chart of a second variant of a sequencing process in<br>
the T=l protocol; and<br>
[0025] Figure 5 shows a flow chart of an alternative sequencing process.<br>
[0026] Figure 1 schematically shows a portable data carrier having the form of a<br>
chip card 1 with a processor 7 (CPU) and a three-stage memory array consisting of a<br>
permanent ROM memory 8, in which is located the operating system of the chip card<br>
1, a rewritable EEPROM memory 9 and a volatile RAM main memory 10. In addition,<br>
chip card 1 comprises a contact-type interface device 2, 3, which comprises a<br><br>
conventional six-field or eight-field contact surface according to ISO 7816 as a<br>
physical interface 2 and a respective interface control 3. Moreover, chip card 1<br>
comprises a contactless interface device 4, 5 with a contactless interface 4, which can<br>
be formed as an antenna or the like, and a respective interface control 5.<br>
[0027] The contactless data and energy transmission to/from the chip card 1 can be<br>
realized in manifold ways, in particular as a conventional radio or RFTD connection.<br>
The respective interface controls 3, 5 control the operation of the pertinent interfaces<br>
2, 4 according to given standardized communication protocols. The contact-type<br>
interface 2 can be operated, for example, according to the communications protocols<br>
T=0 or T=l usual in chip card and mobile radio communications, while the contactless<br>
interface 4, for example, is operated according to the T=CL protocol. The two<br>
interface controls 3, 5 in principle work independently of each other and process only<br>
the one data communication 16, 19, which is handled via the respective interface 2, 4.<br>
[0028] In case of simultaneous data communications 16, 19 at two interfaces 2, 4 a<br>
coordinating sequencing is effected by a sequencing device 6, which is located<br>
downstream of the two interface devices 2, 3 and 4, 5. Sequencing device 6 sequences<br>
the handlings of the two competing data communications 16, 19, which in principle<br>
ought to be carried out in parallel by the respective interface devices 2, 3 and 4, 5, in<br>
such a way that at any time processor 7 processes only one of the two data<br>
communications 16, 19 and despite of this a data loss does not happen. For sequencing<br>
there is required a communication, coordinated by the sequencing device 6, with the<br>
respective external (radio) communication units 12, 13, which are in the simultaneous<br>
data communications 16, 19 with chip card 1. Both interface controls 3, 5 of interfaces<br>
2, 4 and sequencing device 6 can be designed as hardware elements of chip card 1 or<br>
as software components, which either are stored as applications in EEPROM memory<br>
9 or as components of the operating system in ROM memory 8. If they are executed<br>
by processor 7 of chip card 1, respective processes will be formed and processed.<br>
[0029] Chip card 1 in principle can be any chip card provided with a processor, for<br>
example a smart card, a secure multimedia card or a mobile radio card, such as e.g. a<br>
GSM mobile radio card. In the last-mentioned case the GSM mobile radio card<br><br>
communicates via the contact-type interface 2 with a telecommunication<br>
terminal/mobile phone, in which the GSM mobile radio card is inserted, while via the<br>
contactless interface 4 there can be carried out a contactless data communication with<br>
an external radio communication unit, for example a vending terminal or the like<br>
equipped appropriately. In case of a contact-type communication 16 communication<br>
data 17,18 are exchanged between the contact-type interface 2 of chip card 1 and a<br>
respective contact-type interface 14 of an external communication unit 12. Likewise,<br>
in case of a contactless data communication 19 communication data are exchanged<br>
between contactless interface 4 and a respective contactless interface 15 of a radio<br>
communication unit 13.<br>
[0030] When using the T=0 or T=l protocol, contact-type data communication 16 of<br>
the chip card 1 is carried out in the master-slave operation mode with the external<br>
communication unit 14, e.g. a mobile phone, as an active communication partner<br>
(master) and the chip card 1 as reactive communication partner (slave), which merely<br>
reacts to the instructions of the external communication unit 14. For this reason, in the<br>
following it can be assumed, that a contact-type data communication 16 comprises an<br>
instruction 17 of external communication unit 14 to chip card 1 and a subsequent<br>
response 18 of chip card 1 to communication unit 14. In this connection instructions<br>
and answers, preferably, have an ISO-7816-conform structure independent of the<br>
protocol. Instruction 17 preferably has the form of a command APDU (C-APDU) and<br>
response 18 has the form of a response APDU (R-APDU). Both, a C-APDU 17 and a<br>
R-APDU 18 correspond to a standardized data format and comprise both the actual<br>
pay load data and supplementary control data. A C-APDU 17 consists of leading<br>
header data 17a (header) and following payload data 17b, while an R-APDU 18<br>
consists of leading payload data 18a and following trailer data 18b (trailer).<br>
[0031] Within the scope of the present invention only those technical features of<br>
chip cards, chip card protocols and data formats are explained, which are immediately<br>
necessary for understanding the invention.<br>
[0032] When in the following the terms interrupting or resuming a data<br>
communication are used, there is meant interrupting or resuming the processing of the<br><br>
communication by the SIM card 1 in particular by its CPU 7. Detailed and<br>
supplementary technical connections are described in "Handbook of the chip cards, 4th<br>
ed." by W. Rankl and W. Effing.<br>
[0033] Figure 2 schematically shows the simultaneous processing of a contact-type<br>
data communication 16 (CONTACT COM; Fig. 2, on the left) via the contact-type<br>
interface device 2, 3 sequenced by the sequencing device 6 of a SIM mobile radio card<br>
1 as a preferred implementation of a portable data carrier according to the invention,<br>
and a contactless data communication 19 (CONTACTLESS COM; Fig. 2, on the<br>
right) via the contactless interface device 4, 5. Here the steps S1 to S10 (Fig. 2, at the<br>
top) constitute the sequencing of a contact-type data communication 16, which starts<br>
during an already running contactless data communication 19, while with the steps<br>
S21 to S24 (Fig. 2, at the bottom) a simple sequencing of a contactless data<br>
communication 19 is realized, which starts while a contact-type data communication<br>
16 is already running.<br>
[0034] With a contact-type data communication 16 within the framework of the T=0<br>
protocol the header data 17a (HEADER) comprising 5 bytes of a received C-APDU 17<br>
should not be lost. For this reason at least the processing of a running contactless data<br>
communication (step S1) is interrupted when a contact-type data communication 16 is<br>
started. The header data 17a sent by an external communication unit 12 are completely<br>
received (step S2) and temporarily stored by the sequencing device 6 e.g. in a FIFO<br>
memory 11, which preferably is arranged in the RAM memory 10 of SIM card 1.<br>
Likewise, header data 17a can be written into a memory or memory area of SIM card 1<br>
provided therefor, e.g. in the RAM main memory 10, per direct memory access<br>
(DMA) or via an interrupt.<br>
[0035] After the header data 17a have been completely received the sequencing<br>
device 6 again switches over to the contactless data communication 19, which then is<br>
at least carried out further (step S3) or entirely completed.<br>
[0036] An interruption time WWT (Work Waiting Time) at the contact-type<br>
interface 2, which indicates the maximum time period between the starting edges of<br>
two received bytes following each other before the abortion of the data reception, is<br><br>
monitored either by the sequencing device 6 or the interface control 3. SIM card 1<br>
sends an extension inquiry 21 (shortly) before the end of the WWT, for example in the<br>
form of a so-called zero byte: '60' as a procedure byte, via the contact-type interface 2<br>
to the external communication unit 14 (step S4). For this purpose the contactless data<br>
communication 19 continued in step S3, if required, is interrupted again and not<br>
continued until after that (step S5).<br>
[0037] There can follow multiple steps of sending extension inquiries (S6)<br>
respectively via the contact-type interface 2, in order to maintain the contact-type data<br>
communication 16 until the contactless data communication 19 is completed (step S7).<br>
In this way, acknowledging the complete receipt of the header data 17a of an incoming<br>
C-APDU by the interface unit 3 with the help of an acknowledge ACK as a procedure<br>
byte (step S8) is delayed until after the completion of the contactless data<br>
communication 19.<br>
[0038] Subsequently, the contact-type data communication 16 interrupted on receipt<br>
of the header data 17a (step S2) is continued according to the protocol, by in step S9<br>
taking place the exchange of payload data (DATA), i.e. that on the one hand the<br>
pay load data 17b of the command APDU 17 are transmitted to the SIM card 1 and on<br>
the other hand the payload data 18a of the response APDU 18 are transmitted to the<br>
external communication unit 12. Finally, the trailer data 18b (TRAILER) of the<br>
response APDU 18 are transmitted to the external communication unit 14 (step S14).<br>
These trailer data 18b for example comprise the return codices SW1 and SW2 (return<br>
code) of the response APDU 18.<br>
[0039] When the contactless data communication 19, however, is already completed<br>
with step S3, the interrupted receipt of the instruction 17 via the contact-type interface<br>
2 is continued with the steps of sending S8 the acknowledgement ACK, the data<br>
exchange S9 and transmitting S10 the trailer data 18b.<br>
[0040] The opposite case that during a contact-type data communication 16 a<br>
contactless data communication 19 starts, can be sequenced within the framework of<br>
the T=0 protocol.<br><br>
[0041] In a first variant, not separately shown in a Figure, the processing of the<br>
contact-type data communication 16 at first is interrupted and subsequently is<br>
maintained with the help of extension inquiries 21, in order to be able to process the<br>
contactless data communication 19 virtually parallel. The method basically runs<br>
analogous to the steps S2 to S10 described above in Figure 1, only step S1 is to be<br>
mentally deleted. After the receipt of header data 17a as a first procedure step, the<br>
running contact-type data communication 16 is interrupted by a newly started<br>
contactless data communication 19. A WWT is monitored for the contact-type data<br>
communication 16 and, if required, extended once or multiple times by an extension<br>
inquiry 21, until the contactless data communication 19 is completed. Thereafter, the<br>
interrupted contact-type data communication 16 can be continued.<br>
[0042] In a second variant, which is shown in the bottom half of Fig. 2, at first there<br>
is carried out the contact-type data communication 16 in an operating state<br>
(OPERATING STATE), in which at the same time the contactless interface 4 is<br>
locked by the sequencing device 6, by sending header data 17a of a command APDU<br>
17 (step S21), exchanging payload data 17b, 18a (step S22) and sending trailer data<br>
18b of a response APDU (step S23). The contactless data communication 19 is<br>
blocked or delayed during the operating state of the contact-type interface device 2, 3.<br>
This means, that during the operating state of the contact-type interface device 2, 3<br>
interrupts, which are produced at the contactless interface device 4, 5 by reason of a<br>
starting contactless data communication 19, e.g. because the contactless interface 4<br>
entries the magnetic field of a radio communication unit 13, are ignored and not<br>
processed.<br>
[0043] Since the radio communication unit 13 carries out a polling for a certain<br>
period, when the contactless interface unit 4, 5 is locked, i.e. repeatedly tries to make<br>
contact, the start of the contactless data communication 19 can be delayed until the<br>
completion of the operating state. After sending the trailer data 18b to the external<br>
communication unit 12 the sequencing device 6 converts the contact-type interface<br>
device 2, 3 from the operating state into an inoperative state (IDLE STATE), in which<br>
at the same time the contactless interface unit 4, 5 is released, so that upon the<br>
application of a respective magnetic field at the contactless interface 4 (or with the<br><br>
receipt of an RIQx signal from the external radio communication unit 13) the<br>
contactless data communication 19 can be started and carried out in step S24. After the<br>
completion of the contactless data communication 19, the operating state of the<br>
contact-type interface device 2, 3 is switched on by the sequencing device 6 and there<br>
can take place a further contact-type data communication 16.<br>
[0044] With the sequencing methods complementing each other that are described<br>
with respect to Fig. 2 an alternating and lossless processing of the competing data<br>
communications 16, 19 via interfaces 2, 4 of SIM card 1 and with that a simple<br>
multitasking for the T=0 protocol is realized.<br>
[0045] In a similar way Figures 3 and 4 show two alternative sequencing methods<br>
for a contact-type data communication 16 according to the T=l protocol, which starts<br>
during a contactless data communication 19. The opposite case of a contactless data<br>
communication 19 starting during a contact-type data communication 16 can be<br>
realized in the T=l protocol in principle analogous to the T=0 protocol, i.e. either as<br>
shown in the lower half of Figure 2 or as a method which starts with step 32 of Fig. 3.<br>
[0046] Both Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the case of a contact-type data communication<br>
16 starting during a contactless data communication 19. In the T=l protocol the receipt<br>
of header data 17a and pay load data 17b of an instruction 17 (C-APDU) cannot be<br>
interrupted as with the T=0 protocol (cf. Fig. 2, above). Therefore, for the T=l data<br>
communication 16 two alternatives are expedient, which are realized by steps S31 to<br>
S38 (Fig. 3) and S41 to S45 (Fig. 4).<br>
[0047] With the embodiment shown in Fig. 3 a contactless data communication 19<br>
started in step S31 is interrupted with the start of the contact-type data communication<br>
16 by the sequencing device 6, so as to first start the contact-type data communication<br>
16. For this purpose in step S32 the C-APDU 17 is received via contact-type interface<br>
2 and temporarily stored in a FIFO memory 11. Alternatively, data 17a, 17b of<br>
incoming instruction 17 can also be stored with the help of a direct memory access<br>
(DMA) or in an interrupt-driven fashion with priority in any suitable memory or<br>
memory area of SIM card 1. Thereafter, the contact-type data communication 16 again<br><br>
is interrupted in favor of the continuation of the contactless data communication 19<br>
(step S33).<br>
[0048] The predetermined response time (BWT, Block Waiting Time) for<br>
generating and sending a response 18 (R-APDU) to the received instruction 17 is<br>
monitored in SIM card 1. In good time before the end of the BWT SIM card 1 sends in<br>
a step S34 an extension inquiry 21 in the form of a waiting time extension inquiry<br>
(WTX Request) and receives a respective acknowledgement (Waiting Time Extension<br>
Acknowledge - WTX Ack). Requesting an extension of the waiting period can be<br>
effected, if required, several times, until the contactless data communication 19 is<br>
completed (step S35). Requesting S34 the extension can be effected in a fashion<br>
controlled by CPU 7 of SIM card 1 or by contact-type interface device 2, 3. Thereafter,<br>
SIM card 1 continues the processing of the contact-type data communication 16 (step<br>
S38). In particular, the steps connected with the received command 17 are executed<br>
and a respective R-APDU 18 is sent via the contact-type interface device 2, 3 to the<br>
external communication unit 12.<br>
[0049] Moreover, the response time BWT should be adjusted respectively already in<br>
the initialization phase (ATR; Answer to reset) of the contact-type data<br>
communication 16 arranged upstream of the described method. The BWT is<br>
negotiated between SIM card 1 and external communication unit 12 such that it has a<br>
value as high as possible.<br>
[0050] In the case of a running contact-type data communication 16 and a then<br>
starting contactless data communication 19, in the T=l protocol, too, the contact-type<br>
data communication 16 can be interrupted and as long as necessary maintained by<br>
respective extension inquiries 21 until the contactless data communication 19 is<br>
completed. This solution can also be recognized in Fig. 3, when step S33 is regarded<br>
as the start of the contactless data communication and step S31 is imagined not to be<br>
there or is allocated to the completion of a previous contactless data communication.<br>
[0051] Before an interruption of the processing of a data communication in favor of<br>
the processing of a different data communication it is checked, whether it is permitted<br>
at all that the data communication is interrupted. For example, it can be defined that it<br><br>
is only permitted that the contact-type data communication is interrupted. Parameter<br>
for the sequencing stored on SIM card 1 can contain information as to which type of<br>
data communication is permitted to be interrupted. Furthermore, in the parameter to be<br>
checked can be differentiated whether it is permitted that the data communication is<br>
interrupted as an initial data communication in favor of a second data communication<br>
or as a second data communication in favor of an initial data communication. The<br>
parameter to be checked can be designed in a card-specific, application-specific and/<br>
or command-specific fashion. With that, for example, the provider of an application<br>
has the possibility to adapt the behavior of the SIM card to his security requirements<br>
without a change of the control software in the SIM card.<br>
[0052] Moreover, there can be checked, whether an interruption of a data<br>
communication is necessary at all. When the remaining runtime expected for the<br>
processing of a data communication falls below a limit value, the data communication<br>
can be continued without an interruption being necessary. The remaining runtime can<br>
be calculated from a measured command runtime and an expected scheduled runtime<br>
for the command. The limit value as a parameter for the sequencing can also be<br>
designed in a card-specific, application-specific and/ or command-specific fashion.<br>
[0053] Checking the necessity and/ or permissibility of the interruption as described,<br>
is an option applicable to all embodiments of the invention.<br>
[0054] In an alternative embodiment for the T=l protocol shown in Fig. 4, a running<br>
contactless data communication 19 (step S41) is not interrupted on the start of a<br>
competing contact-type data communication 16, but completed.<br>
[0055] The competing contact-type data communication 16 here is not actively<br>
interrupted or completed, but merely not processed. I.e., that the data of a C-APDU 17<br>
incoming at the contact-type interface 2 in step S42 reach into one of the asynchronous<br>
UART input buffer 20 arranged downstream of the contact-type interface 2, but these<br>
data are not read-out further with priority and processed as usual. The consequence is<br>
that the normally relatively small UART buffer 20 overflows already after a part of the<br>
incoming data (step S42) of the C-APDU 17 (OVERFLOW) and at least the remaining<br>
data incoming after the overflow are lost (step S43).<br><br>
[0056] After the completion of the contactless data communication 19 the<br>
sequencing device 6 recognizes the overflow of the UART buffer 20 and thus that<br>
during the processing of the contactless data communication 19 a competing contact-<br>
type data communication 16 has taken place in step S23 and S24, which could not be<br>
completely received. If necessary, the sequencing device 6 has to let go the still<br>
remaining data of the C-APDU 17 in step S43 into the void. The end of the<br>
transmission of the C-APDU 17 is recognized by the sequencing device 6 from the<br>
expiring of the character waiting time (CWT), which defines the maximum time<br>
period between the starting edges of two consecutive characters within an incoming<br>
data block. Then the incorrect receipt of the C-APDU 17 in steps S18 and S19 is<br>
acknowledged with an error message (ERR) of the sequencing device 6 or the contact-<br>
type interface device 2, 3 to the external communication unit 12 in step S44,<br>
whereupon the external communication unit 12 again sends C-APDU 17, which then<br>
can be received properly and completely (step S45).<br>
[0057] Finally, Figure 5 with steps S51 to S59 shows a further embodiment of a<br>
sequencing of, in principle, competing data communications 16,19, for the case that a<br>
contactless data communication 19 starts during an already running contact-type data<br>
communication 16. In contrast to the approaches shown above, the sequencing is not<br>
effected solely by the SIM card, but at least partially in cooperation with the external<br>
communication units 12.<br>
[0058] For this purpose the running contact-type data communication 16 is<br>
temporarily interrupted by the sequencing device 6 at different points in time and a<br>
ready-to-receive state (STANDBY) of the contactless interface 4 is created, in order to<br>
be able to recognize and process any starting contactless data communications 19. For<br>
example, after the sending of a C-APDU 17 from the external communication unit 12<br>
to the contact-type interface device 2, 3 in step S51 and before sending back a<br>
respective R-APDU 18 in step S53 a temporary ready-to-receive state of the<br>
contactless interface device 2, 3 can be arranged (step S52), in order to be able to<br>
process any contactless data communications 19 starting during this time period.<br><br>
[0059] In SIM mobile radio cards 1 there is provided a special set of commands<br>
within the framework of the SIM application toolkit, which provides proactive<br>
commands to a mobile radio card 1, which avoid the conventional master-slave<br>
relation between a SIM mobile radio card 1 and a communication unit 12, 13 and<br>
allow the SIM card 1 to direct instructions to the communication unit 12, which have<br>
to be answered by the latter. For this purpose, in particular the commands STATUS,<br>
FETCH and TERMINAL RESPONSE are suitable. With the help of the STATUS<br>
command the communication unit 12 requests, whether SIM card 1 wants to issue<br>
proactive commands. The card will answer with a status code "91XX", if it wants to<br>
send a command itself. By transmitting the FETCH command, the external<br>
communication unit 12 then fetches an instruction at SIM card 1 which it has to<br>
process, while with the help of the TERMINAL RESPONSE command (TERM<br>
RESP) the respective response of the external communication unit 12 to the instruction<br>
fetched before is transferred to SIM card 1. By using the proactive commands of the<br>
SIM application toolkit, there can be selectively achieved, e.g. caused by the<br>
sequencing device 6, a ready-to-receive state (STANDBY) at the contactless interface<br>
4 several times one after the other.<br>
[0060] Response 22 in the form of status code "91XX" of SIM card 1 in step S53<br>
causes the external communication unit 12 to fetch an instruction at SIM card 1 with a<br>
FETCH command 23 (step S54). SIM card 1 uses the processing time granted to it for<br>
a ready-to-receive state phase S55 of the contactless interface 4.<br>
[0061] As an instruction to be fetched by the external communication unit 12 now,<br>
preferably, the MORE TIME instruction can be used, with which SIM card 1 requests<br>
further time from the external communication unit 12 for the processing of tasks. In<br>
the present case, by the step of sending S56 a MORE TIME inquiry 21, it requests the<br>
time for a further ready-to-receive-state phase (STDBY) for processing the contactless<br>
data communication 19. The MORE TIME instruction 21 of SIM card 1 is granted by<br>
external communication unit 12 with a TERMINAL RESPONSE command (step<br>
S57). If now in the further ready-to-receive-state phase a contactless data<br>
communication 19 starts (step S58), SIM card 1 can send further MORE TIME<br>
instructions. Preferably, the ready-to-receive state is extended in such a way until the<br><br>
completion of the contactless data communication 19. SIM card 1 can send in step<br>
S59, for example, a status code "9000" as a response 18 via the contact-type interface<br>
device 2, 3 to the communication unit 12.<br>
[0062] During the proactive phase, before each sending S53, S56, S59 of a response,<br>
the sequencing device 6 can release/activate the contactless interface device 4, 5, in<br>
order to be able to recognize and process any contactless data communication 19.<br>
After the sending of the response, the contact-type interface device 2, 3 is re-activated.<br>
[0063] With a step S50 of sending a further STATUS command then possibly starts<br>
a further data communication 16 between communication unit 12 and SIM card 1 via<br>
contact-type interface device 2, 3.<br>
[0064] The time interval between the receipt of two STATUS commands or between<br>
the last response of SIM card 1 in a proactive phase and the next STATUS command<br>
should be chosen in a suitable way. Normally, the time interval is negotiated between<br>
SIM card 1 and communication unit 12 in an initialization phase of the contact-type<br>
communication 16. Communication unit 12 then sends STATUS commands in the<br>
agreed time interval. Because of the fast reaction time necessary for the contactless<br>
data communication 19, the time interval should be as small as possible.<br>
[0065] From the viewpoint of communication unit 12, however, an as large as<br>
possible time interval would rather be expedient, for example, to save electricity or to<br>
avoid times in which the communication unit 12 waits for an instruction of SIM card<br>
1. Therefore, the time interval should be arranged such that it can be (temporarily)<br>
shortened. As a trigger for the shortening, for example, an input of the user into the<br>
communication unit 12 can be used, with which the user requests a release/ activation<br>
of the contactless communication interface 4, 5, preferably for a limited time period of<br>
for example one minute. But likewise, recognizing a contactless data communication<br>
field or recognizing an attempt to set up the contactless data communication can serve<br>
as a trigger, the contactless data communication, preferably, being recognized and<br>
communicated to communication unit 12 by SIM card 1, for example in the form of a<br>
status code of a response 18.<br><br>
[0066] Then the user can activate the contactless interface device 4, 5 for a given<br>
time period, for example one minute, via the SIM application toolkit of the mobile<br>
radio card, so that during this time period the sequencing device 6 creates the ready-to-<br>
receive state of the contactless interface device 4, 5 via cycles of proactive commands.<br>
The sequencing device 6 or the contactless interface device 4, 5 - optionally after an<br>
initialization of the contactless interface 4 - waits a given time period (e.g. two<br>
seconds) for a contactless data communication 19 starting at the contactless interface<br>
4. If within this time period a contactless data communication 19 starts, the sequencing<br>
device 6 ensures, that such communication can be completed.<br>
[0067] Here it is advantageous, that immediately after a contactless data<br>
communication 19 a user dialogue via the contact-type interface 2 can be started. It is<br>
also possible that instead of the MORE TIME instruction different proactive<br>
commands are used, with which, additionally, a contactless data communication 19<br>
starting at the contactless interface 4 is waited for. Instead of the above described<br>
proactive operating, there can also be sent one or a plurality of special APDUs from<br>
the external communication unit 12 to SIM card 1, which for a defined time period<br>
wait for a contactless data communication 19 at the contactless interface 4. Likewise,<br>
it is possible, that the external communication unit 12, which normally is a mobile<br>
radio terminal, operates a cyclic polling with suitable APDUs, so that the user of the<br>
mobile radio card 1 does not have to carry out a selection from the menu in the SIM<br>
application toolkit, in order to activate the contactless interface device 4, 5.<br>
[0068] With the above-described embodiments there have to be taken into<br>
consideration, that the occurrence of a magnetic field at the contactless interface 4,<br>
preferably, doe not necessarily mean that a contactless data communication 19 is really<br>
effected. Therefore, it can be expedient to define the start of a contactless data<br>
communication 19 as the point in time at which SIM card 1 is selected by the external<br>
radio communication unit 13. Until this point in time, in particular the receipt and<br>
temporary storage of data within the framework of the contact-type data<br>
communication 16 by the contact-type interface device 2, 3 and an initialization and<br>
anticollision at the contactless interface 4 can run in parallel.<br><br>
[0069] Likewise, a contactless data communication 19, which can also consist of a<br>
plurality of APDUs, preferably is "short", i.e. that in the case of two contact-type data<br>
communications 16 following each other it can be placed in between their APDUs. In<br>
this connection it can be expedient to monitor the length of a contactless data<br>
communication 19 and to optionally abort it, if it lasts too long. In case of longer<br>
contactless data communications 19 it can be expedient to alternately process the<br>
respective APDUs of the competing contact-type and contactless data communications<br>
16, 19. For this purpose, however, a delay mechanism to be used at the contactless<br>
interface device 4, 5 is necessary. Since the protocol mechanisms of the contactless<br>
T=CL protocol are similar to those of the contact-type T=l protocol, also with a<br>
contactless data communication 19 there can be used a monitoring or extension of the<br>
response time by WTX inquiries and/ or the repeated sending/ receiving of ignored<br>
and/ or lost data blocks.<br><br>

occurring contact-type and contactless data communications (16, 19) in such a way<br>
that the two data communications (16, 19) can be carried out sequentially step-by-step<br>
and without data loss. The processing of the first data communication via the first<br>
interface (4) is interrupted in order to start a second data communication via the<br>
second interface (2). After the step of starting, the interrupted processing of the first<br>
data communication is continued while at the same time the started second data<br>
communication is maintained.</td>
