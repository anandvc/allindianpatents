Water (500 ml), Methylene chloride (300 ml) is added to the residue and mixed for about 15 min. pH of the reaction mass is adjusted with hydrochloric acid to 1.8 at temperature of 20 - 25°C. Reaction mass is allowed to settle, layers are separated, aqueous layer is extracted with methylene chloride (100 ml). Combined organic layer is washed water (100 ml), treated with charcoal (5 gms) and dried the organic layer over anhydrous sodium sulphate (10 gms). Solvent is distilled off from the dried organic layer at temperature below 50°C finally under vacuum. Acetone (100 ml) is added to the residue, mixed for about 10 min and solvent is distilled off under vacuum at temperature below 50°C. Acetone (300 ml) is added to the residue, cooled the mass to 30°C and pH of the mass is adjusted to 2.8 with IPA HC1 (about 2 ml). Temperature of reaction mass is raised, maintained for 1 hr at reflux temperature, cooled and maintained for 30 min at 25 - 30°C. Product is filtered, wet cake is washed with acetone (50 ml) and dried the wet cake at temperature of 60 - 70°C till becomes constant weight.<br>
The Dry weight of tert Butyl 4,-[4-Methyl-6-(l-methyl-lH-benzimidazol-2-yl)-2-n-propyMH-benzimidazol-l-yl-methyl]biphenyl-2-carboxylate hydrochloride is 73 gms (Yield: 73%). HC1 content: 5.85 % w/w<br><br><br>
Tert.Butyl-4^ -[4-Methyl-6-( 1 -methyl-1 H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-2-n-propyl-1H-benzimidazol-l-yl-methyl]biphenyl-2-carboxylate hydrochloride (50 gms) is suspended in acetone (250 ml) and hydrochloric acid (50 ml) is added. Temperature of the mass is raised, maintained at 50°C - 55°C for 3 hrs, cooled and maintained at 25 - 30°C for 2 hrs. Product is filtered; wet cake is washed with water (2 x 50 ml) and acetone (50 ml). Dried the wet cake at temperature 60°C - 65°C till constant weight.<br>
Dry weight of Telmisartan dihydrochloride is 44 gms (Yield: 90.8%) HC1 content: 11.89% w/w; Water content: 2.85%<br><br>
4' -[4-Methyl-6-( 1 -methyl-1 H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-2-n-propyl-1 H-benzimidazol-1 -yl-methyl] biphenyl-2-carboxylic acid dihydrochloride ( 50 gms) is suspended in methanol (450 ml) and mixed for about 15 min. Charcoal (5.0gms) is added, mixed for about 30 min, filtered off the charcoal through hyflow bed and washed the bed with methanol (50ml). pH of the filtrate is adjusted to 6.5 with aqueous ammonia solution at temperature of 25°C -35°C. Temperature of the mass is raised, maintained for 1 hr at 50°C-55°C, Cooled and maintained for 6 hrs at 0 - 5°C. Product is filtered, wet cake is washed with water (2 x 100ml) and finally with methanol (100 ml). Dried the wet cake at temperature of 75°C - 85°C till becomes constant weight.<br>
Dry weight of Telmisartan is 36 gms (Yield: 82.2%) IR, DSC confirms the product as polymorphic Form-A<br></td>
