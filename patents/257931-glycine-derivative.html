				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Glycine Derivative and Use Thereof<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a glycine derivative and its medical use,<br>
particularly a therapeutic agent for inflammatory bowel disease.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Inflammatory bowel disease is a collective name of ulcerative colitis and<br>
Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis is a non-specific chronic inflammatory disease in<br>
which mucosal damage in large intestine diffusely and continuously ascends from<br>
rectum. . On the other hand, in Crohn's disease, inflammation is observed at various<br>
sites in gastrointestinal tract, and transmural conditions such as deep ulcer and<br>
perforation are observed. Although the pathogenesis of these diseases is not known,<br>
various causes such as infections, environmental factors, psychosomatic medical<br>
problems, inheritance and immune abnormality are assumed, and the diseases are<br>
generally thought to be multiple-cause diseases caused by being complexly<br>
intertwined with the above-described factors.<br>
[0003]<br>
The major symptoms of ulcerative colitis are mucous and bloody stool,<br>
abdominal pain and diarrhea, and anemia and tachycardia are observed depending on<br>
the degree of bleeding. Inappetence, weight loss, general malaise and easy<br>
fatigability are also observed in some cases. Complications in intestinal tract<br>
include massive bleeding, perforation, toxic megacolon and occurrence of colon<br>
cancer. Complications in organs other than intestinal tract include skin diseases<br>
such as erythema nodosum and pyoderma, ophthalmic diseases such as conjunctivitis<br>
and iridocyclitis, and stomatitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis is rarely observed.<br><br>
[0004]<br>
The most frequent symptoms of Crohn's disease are diarrhea and abdominal<br>
pain. Further, fever, melena, weight loss due to impaired absorption, general<br>
malaise, anal pain and anemia are often observed. Complications in intestinal tract<br>
include constriction, fistula and adhesion. Complications in organs other than<br>
intestinal tract include skin diseases such as necrotic pyoderma and erythema<br>
nodosum, joint disease, stomatitis, cholangitis and fatty liver. Crohn's disease is<br>
classified into small intestinal type, small and large intestinal type and large intestinal<br>
type.<br>
Peak of onset of inflammatory bowel disease is in twenties, and recurrence<br>
and remission are easy to be repeated, so that frequently, QOL is seriously disturbed.<br>
Further, since the number of patients is increasing due to the recent changes of<br>
environmental factors such as the change in dietary life, the importance of therapy of<br>
inflammatory bowel disease is increasing year by year.<br>
[0005]<br>
Therapy for inflammatory bowel disease is performed by means of<br>
pharmacotherapy, apheresis or surgical therapy. Pharmacotherapy includes the<br>
remission-induction therapy in which the symptoms are alleviated and remission is<br>
quickly induced, and the prophylactic remission-maintenance therapy in which the<br>
remission period is prolonged. In the remission-induction, in cases where the<br>
symptoms are slight or moderate, the therapy is based on oral administration of<br>
salazosulfapyridine or 5-aminosalicylic acid. These drugs are also used for the<br>
prophylactic remission-maintenance therapy. If the effects of the drugs are<br>
insufficient or the symptoms are more serious, adrenocortical steroids or<br>
immunosuppressive agents are used.<br>
[0006]<br>
Therapy for Crohn's disease is mainly performed by means of nutritional<br><br>
therapy, pharmacotherapy or surgical treatment. The pharmacotherapy is based on<br>
5-aminosalicylic acid preparation, and adrenocortical steroids or immunosuppressive<br>
agents are used depending on the symptoms.<br>
[0007]<br>
Recently, it has been proved that local cytokines strongly participate in the<br>
pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, and studies on the drugs targeting the<br>
cytokines are underway. Anti-TNF-Î± antibody therapy targeting TNF-a, which is<br>
a key cytokine of Crohn's disease, is presently used for the amelioration of the lesion<br>
or for decreasing the amount of steroids.<br>
[0008]<br>
However, known therapeutic agents for inflammatory bowel disease does not<br>
sufficiently satisfy the needs of users with respect to the purpose such as amelioration<br>
of symptoms or reduction of side effects.<br>
[0009]<br>
It is known that leukocytes strongly participate in the development of<br>
inflammatory bowel disease. In recent years, a number of trials for inhibiting the<br>
development of the disease are underway using monoclonal antibodies, antisenses or<br>
low molecular compounds which inhibit the activation or hyperfunction of<br>
leukocytes, or which inhibit the proinflammatory substance produced by leukocytes.<br>
Examples of the target molecules include CD4 which is a surface molecule expressed<br>
on leukocytes, adhesive molecules, regulatory molecules of T cell activation (CD40L,<br>
CD28 and CTLA-4), phosphorylation signals of leukocytes, transcription factors,<br>
various inflammatory chemical mediators such as inflammatory cytokines and LTB4,<br>
active oxygen and various enzymes (PDEIV, lipoxygenase and the like). The<br>
therapeutic effects by inhibiting these molecules on inflammatory bowel disease have<br>
been proved by using monoclonal antibodies or low molecular inhibitors in human<br>
clinical studies or in experimental animal models (see, for example, Non-patent<br><br>
Literature 1, Non-patent Literature 2 and Non-patent Literature 3).<br>
[0010]<br>
In the lesion tissues in inflammatory bowel disease, prominent infiltration of<br>
leukocytes is observed. It is widely recognized that the infiltration is due to the<br>
leukocytes normally circulating in the blood which penetrate the vascular wall,<br>
resulting in gathering of the leukocytes at the lesion tissues. It has been proved that<br>
infiltration of the leukocytes via vascular endothelium is caused by the interaction<br>
between integrins on the leukocytes and adhesion molecules which belong to the<br>
immunoglobulin family such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on the vascular endothelial<br>
cells.<br>
[0011]<br>
Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1: CD54) is an adhesion molecule<br>
belonging to the immunoglobulin super family, and mainly exists on vascular<br>
endothelium. ICAM-1 binds to lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1:<br>
integrin a LÎ²2, CD 11 a/CD18) and Mac-1 (integrin aM(32, CD1 lb/CD 18) on<br>
leukocytes, and is involved in extravasation of inflammatory cells (see, for example,<br>
Non-patent Literature 4). Existence of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-<br>
1) also has been confirmed in intestinal mucosal tissues (see, for example, Non-<br>
patent Literature 5), and the molecule is involved in extravasation of leukocytes by<br>
binding to very late activating antigen-4 (VLA-4: integrin Î±4Î²1)(see, for example,<br>
Non-patent Literature 6). Further, as an adhesion molecule specific to the<br>
endothelial cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissues, mucosal addressing cell<br>
adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) is known. MAdCAM-1 binds to lymphocyte<br>
Peyer's patch HEV adhesion molecule-1 (LPAM-1: integrin Î±4Î²7), and plays an<br>
important role in gut immunity (see, for example, Non-patent Literature 7 and Non-<br>
patent Literature 8). It is also known that integrin Î±4Î²7 binds to VCAM-1 similar<br>
to integrin Î±4Î²1 (see, for example, Non-patent Literature 9). The therapeutic<br><br>
effects on inflammatory bowel disease by inhibiting the binding between the<br>
adhesion molecules and their integrin receptors have been proved by using antisenses<br>
to ICAM-1 or monoclonal antibodies to integrin Î±4 in human clinical studies (see,<br>
for example, Non-patent Literature 10) or in experimental animal models (see, for<br>
example, Non-patent Literature 11, Non-patent Literature 12 and Non-patent<br>
Literature 13).<br>

shown in Tables 6 and 7 include pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.]<br>
The compounds represented by Formula (I) and the pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts thereof according to the present invention can be synthesized by the<br>
following steps:<br>
[0044]<br>
Conversion of the compounds represented by the following Formula (VI) :<br>
[0045]<br><br>
(wherein the symbols have the same meanings as described above):<br>
[0046]<br>
to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be attained by a conventional<br>
method using a base (inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide; organic base such as<br><br>
triethylamine; or basic amino acid such as lysine) or an acid (acetic acid; inorganic<br>
acid such as nitric acid or sulfuric acid; organic acid such as acetic acid or maleic<br>
acid; organic sulfonic acid such as p-toluenesulfonic acid; acidic amino acid such as<br>
aspartic acid).<br>
[0047]<br>
The compounds of Formula (VI) can be obtained by converting the esterified<br>
carboxyl group CO2R16 of a compound of the Formula (VII):<br>
[0048]<br><br>
[0049]<br>
[wherein R16 represents C1-C5 alkyl, and other symbols have the same meanings as<br>
described above]<br>
to carboxyl group.<br>
[0050]<br>
Conversion of the esterified carboxyl group CO2R16 to carboxyl group may be<br>
attained by a conventional method such as hydrolysis using a base (alkaline metal<br>
hydroxide such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, barium hydroxide) or an<br>
acid (such as hydrochloric acid), or acid (e.g. trifluoroacetic acid) treatment. The<br>
amount of the base is usually 0.9 to 100 equivalents, preferably 0.9 to 10.0<br>
equivalents with respect to the compound of Formula (VII). The amount of the acid<br>
is usually 1.0 equivalent with respect to the compound of Formula (VII) to an excess<br>
amount used as a solvent, preferably 1.0 to 100 equivalents with respect to the<br>
compound of Formula (VII).<br><br>
[0051]<br>
Examples of the solvent include aprotic bipolar solvents such as DMF and<br>
DMSO; ether solvents such as diethyl ether, THF and DME; alcoholic solvents such<br>
as methanol and ethanol; halogen-containing solvents such as dichloromethane,<br>
chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and 1,2-dichloroethane; water; and mixtures thereof.<br>
Among these, DMF, THF, methanol, ethanol or water is preferably used. The<br>
reaction temperature is thought to be -30Â°C to 200Â°C. In case of hydrolysis using a<br>
base, the reaction temperature is preferably -20Â°C to 60Â°C, more preferably -10Â°C to<br>
40Â°C. In case of hydrolysis using an acid, the reaction temperature is preferably 0Â°C<br>
to 180Â°C, more preferably 0Â°C to 100Â°C. The reaction time may appropriately be<br>
selected depending on the conditions such as reaction temperature, and satisfactory<br>
results are usually obtained by selecting a reaction time between about 1 minute and<br>
30 hours.<br>
[0052]<br>
The compounds of Formula (VII) may be synthesized by the following<br>
method (Method A or Method B) depending on the "V" structure thereof:<br>
[0053]<br>
Method A: In cases where V is -CH=CH-<br>
[0054]<br><br>
[0055]<br>
[wherein Z1 represents a leaving group such as halogen atom or<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy group, and other symbols have the same meanings as<br><br>
described above]<br>
The compounds of Formula (VIIa) can be synthesized by coupling a<br>
compound of Formula (VIIIa) with a compound of Formula (IX).<br>
[0056]<br>
The coupling reaction is carried out in the presence of a palladium catalyst<br>

Measurement of Inhibitory Effect on Leukocyte Functions<br>
Jurkat cells which are a cell line originated from human acute T cell<br>
lymphoma were allowed to react with BCECF-AM at 37Â°C for 20 minutes to<br>
fluorescently label the cells. The fluorescently labelled Jurkat cells were allowed to<br>
react with ligand-expressing cells or with a ligand-immobilized plate at 37Â°C for 30<br>
minutes. After removing non-adherent cells by washing, 1% NP40 was added to<br><br>
lyse the adherent cells, and fluorescence intensity was measured with Cytoflow 2300<br>
(Millipore). From the obtained fluorescence intensity, the number of adherent cells<br>
was calculated. Each test compound was reacted with the Jurkat cells before the<br>
beginning of the adhesion reaction. In Table 18, the IC50 of each compound is<br>
shown.<br><br>
As is apparent from Table 18, the compounds in the present invention clearly<br>
inhibit functions of leukocytes involved in the development of inflammatory bowel<br><br>
disease, so that they exhibit therapeutic and/or prophylactic actions against<br>
inflammatory bowel disease.<br>
Example 87<br>
[0468]<br>
Measurement of Inhibitory Effect on Inflammatory Mediator Production by<br>
Leukocytes<br>
A mixture of human peripheral blood and physiological saline containing 3%<br>
dextran was left to stand for 30 minutes and then the upper layer was recovered.<br>
The upper layer was overlaid on Histopaque 1077 (SIGMA), and the resultant was<br>
centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 30 minutes. The supernatant was removed by<br>
aspiration and a buffer was added to the precipitate to prepare a neutrophil<br>
suspension (4 x 105 cells/mL). To the neutrophil suspension, ionomycin was added<br>
and the mixture was incubated at 37Â°C for 30 minutes, followed by quantification of<br>
leukotriene B4 by EIA (Amersham, Biotrak EIA system). Each test compound was<br>
added to the neutrophil suspension before adding ionomycin. In Table 19, the IC50<br>
of each compound is shown.<br>
[0469]<br><br>
[0470]<br>
As is apparent from Table 19, the compounds in the present invention inhibit<br>
production of inflammatory mediators by leukocytes involved in the development of<br>
inflammatory bowel disease, so that they exhibit therapeutic and/or prophylactic<br>
actions against inflammatory bowel disease.<br><br>
Example 88<br>
[0471]<br>
Inhibitory Effect of Compounds in Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS)-induced Colitis<br>
Model of mice (1)<br>
Female BALB/c mice (Charles River, Japan) of 7 to 9 weeks old were<br>
allowed to freely drink 3 w/v% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 8 days to induce<br>
colitis. The non-induced (background) group was allowed to freely drink sterilized<br>
distilled water. The compound described in Example 28 was orally administered to<br>
the mice at a dose of 5 mg/kg, and the compounds described in Example 4, Example<br>
22 and Example 78 were orally administered to the mice at a dose of 15 mg/kg every<br>
day. At day8 from the beginning of the drinking, stool consistency was scored (0:<br>
normal stool, 2: loose stool, 4: diarrhea) by using the method described by Murthy et<br>
al (see, for example, Dig Dis Sci., 38, 1722 (1993)).<br>
[0472]<br>
The score of the non-induced group was 0, while the score of the colitis-<br>
induced group was 1.0 to 1.8. On the other hand, the scores of the groups which<br>
received the compounds were lower than the score of the colitis-induced group,<br>
showing the evident amelioration of symptom. The rate of amelioration by the<br>
compound described in Example 28 was 71%, that of the compound described in<br>
Example 4 was 44%, that of the compound described in Example 22 was 67% and<br>
that of the compound described in Example 78 was 40%.<br>
[0473]<br>
As is apparent from the results, the compounds of the present invention have<br>
an excellent therapeutic effect on inflammatory bowel disease.<br>

[0474]<br>
Inhibitory Effect of Compounds in Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS)-induced Colitis<br><br>
Model of mice (2)<br>
Female BALB/c mice (Charles River, Japan) of 7 to 9 weeks old were<br>
allowed to freely drink 3 w/v% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 5 to 7 days, and<br>
then to freely drink sterilized distilled water for 5 days. The procedure was repeated<br>
3 times to induce colitis. The non-induced (background) group was allowed to<br>
freely drink sterilized distilled water. The compounds described in Examples 81<br>
and 84 were orally administered to the mice at a dose of 5 mg/kg, respectively, every<br>
day from Day 27 to Day 31 after from the beginning of the drinking, and stool<br>
consistency was scored (0: normal stool, 2: loose stool, 4: diarrhea) by using the<br>
method described by Murthy et al (see, for example, Dig Dis Sci., 38, 1722 (1993).<br>
[0475]<br>
The score of the non-induced group was 0, while the score of the colitis-<br>
induced group was 1.6 to 1.7. On the other hand, it was demonstrated that the<br>
scores of the groups which received the compounds were lower than the score of the<br>
colitis-induced group, showing the evident amelioration of symptom. The rates of<br>
amelioration by the compounds described in Example 81 and Example 84 were<br>
68.8% and 82.4%, respectively.<br>
