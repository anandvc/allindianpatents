DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Figures I and 2 shows a panty girdle type foundation garment 100 according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention.  The garment 100 includes a distensible pouch or bladder 102 for applying pressure to either or both of the sacral and parasacral areas of a human female's anatomy.  The bladder 102 is constructed of a pliable material, such as rubber or suitable synthetic resins, such that the bladder readily conforms to the epidermal contours over the sacral and/or parasacral areas of the female's body.<br>
The bladder 102 is interposed between the female and a panel 104 that is formed of a substantially non-stretchable material, such as nylon.  The panel 104 may comprise an integral portion of a homogenous foundation garment, or a separate member securely attached to a conventional foundation garment.  The panel 104 may further comprise one or more straps (not shown) for encircling the user's torso lo maintain the desired position of the panel 104.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a fluid flow control unit 106 is positioned in or near a waistband 108 of the garment 100.  The fluid flow<br>
-4-<br><br>
control unit 106 comprises a fluid supply 110 for adding fluid to a cavity 112 in (he bladder 102, and a fluid release 114 for removing fluid from the cavity 112.  The fluid supply 110 may comprise a hand-operated pump (e.g., a squeeze bulb), a power operated pump, or a fluid reservoir (e.g., a compressed gas cylinder) for distending the bladder 102.  According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the fluid release 114 comprises a valve for collapsing the bladder 102.  The fluid control unit 106 may additionally comprise one or more check valves (not shown) for regulating the direction of fluid flow, a pressure regulator (not shown) for establishing and/or maintaining a desired fluid pressure in the bladder 102, and a collection container (not shown) for holding excess fluid.<br>
The term "fluid," as it is used according to the present invention, comprises any gas, liquid or combination thereof.  It is also envisioned that materials capable of transitioning between different states of matter under common ambient conditions may also be used to distend the bladder 102.  According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the fluid comprises air and/or water.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, an elastic foundation panel 116 is located on the opposite side of the garment 100 with respect to the panel 104, i.e., over the lower abdominal area of a female's body. This panel 116 produces a force "B" in a direction that is designed to reduce bloating and create a trimmer appearance.<br>
Elastic legbands 118 may be provided to prevent the garment 100 from riding up in response to distension of the bladder 102 and/or motion of the user.<br>
During menstruation, the pelvic organs and tissues become engorged with blood, which causes congestion due to edema and swelling of the entire pelvic areas 120 (sec Figures 3 and 4).  This results in pressure being placed posteriorly on the anterior sacrum 122 and sacral area 124.   Nerves and veins in the sacral area 124 pass through small holes or sacral foramina 126, and the pressure that is caused by the congestion distorts the normal anatomy and impedes neurologic function and venous drainage.  This change in normal venous drainage exasperates the congestion, putting even more pressure on the nerve roots and causing additional discomfort.<br>
The present invention is directed to relieving the congestion and associated discomfort of menstruation by placing pressure on the posterior aspect of the sacrum and parasacral areas 124, 128 (see Figure 6).  The externally applied pressing force "P" (see Figure 5) helps counteract the pressure that results from vascular tissue engorgement. According to the present invention, the external pressing force P places the sacrum and<br>
-5-<br><br>
parasacral areas 124, 128 in a more normal anatomical relationship, which relaxes the pressure around the sacral foramina 126. This relaxation helps restore normal venous outflow and therefore helps to relieve congestion. Thus, the present invention helps to restore normal anatomy, reduces nerve irritation and decreases pain.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the use of a single cavity bladder.  According a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a multiple cavity bladder may enable different pressures to be developed in the different cavities for the comfort of the wearer. Figures 7 and 9 show a bladder 202 having separated sacral and parasacral cavities 212A, 2I2B.  Two flow control units 206A and 206B respectively adjust the independent pressures in the cavities 212A, 212B.  As shown in Figure 6, the cavities 212A, 212B may apply different pressing forces to the sacraJ and parasacral areas 124, 128, respectively. Of course, the flow control units 206A, 206B may be combined in a single unit with appropriate valves for separately adding and removing fluid from each of the cavities 212A, 212B.<br>
Figure 8 shows an arrangement according to a third embodiment of the invention wherein elastomeric or foam inserts 330 are arranged within a bladder 302 to modify the pressing force that is applied the sacral area 124.<br>
Figure 10 shows a fourth embodiment of the invention. In this arrangement, foam pads 432 are located on either side of a bladder 402 in order to modify the pressing force that is applied to the parasacral areas 128.<br>
Figure II shows a panty girdle type foundation garment 100' including a non-extensible element 500 according to the present invention.  The non-extensible element 500 is positioned for applying pressure to either or both of the sacraf and parasacral areas of a human female's anatomy.  The non-extensible element may be constructed as a solid body 510 (Figure 12), a hollow body 520 (Figure 13), or a cellular body 530 (Figure 14). In each case, the non-extensible element 500 may be shaped or readily conform to the epidermal contours over the sacral and/or parasacral areas of the female's body.<br>
Like the preferred embodiment described above with respect to Figure 1, the non-extensible element 500 is interposed between the female and a panel 104 that is formed of a substantially non-stretchable material, such as nylon.  The panel 104 may comprise an integral portion of a homogenous foundation garment 100', or a separate member securely attached to a conventional foundation garment 100'.  The panel 104 may further comprise<br>
-6-<br><br>
one or more straps (not shown) for encircling the user's torso to maintain the desired position of the panel 104.<br>
Also like the preferred embodiment described above with respect to Figure 1, an elastic foundation panel 116 is located on the opposite side of the garment 100' with respect to the panel 104, i.e., over the lower abdominal area of a female's body. This panel 116 produces a force "B" in a direction that is designed to reduce bloating and create a trimmer appearance.   Elastic legbands 118 may also be provided to prevent the garment 100' from riding up in response to motion of the user.<br>
Examples of materials that may be used to construct a solid body 510 according to the present invention include organic materials such as feathers, down, or fur, fibrous materials such as wood or paper, reformed metals such as ceramics, metals, natural rubber, natural or synthetic resins, or other polymers.  Examples of configurations for hollow bodies 520 according to the present invention include tubes, partial enclosures, and complete enclosures.  And examples of types of materials that may be used to construct a cellular body 530 according to the present invention include foams, sponge rubber, or other expanded materials.  Of course, other equivalent materials and configurations that are capable of providing the pressing force P in accordance with the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
Additional advantages and modifications will also readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative devices, shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
