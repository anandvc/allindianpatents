				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for the manufacture of Herbal Soft Candies useful for promoting positive health and amelioration of certain body dysfunctions &amp; disorders. The latter conditions include the common cold &amp; cough, liver &amp; cardiac disorders, skin afflictions, male infertility and erectile dysfunction, chronic obstructive airway disease, and other such organic disorders. For the first time, a herbal product has been crafted that is expansive in its scope and versatile in its applications. Thus we have an array of herbal candies based on the nectar among fruits - the Amla berry, Embellica officianalis. The finely micronized and ghee-impregnated particles of Ascorbic Acid act as the drug-delivery carriers of the innumerous molecules that derive from the herbal decoction. The novelty of the invention lies in the entirely new concept of dispensing traditional formulations &amp; preparations in an easily portable and modern format. In another view, the herbal candy is an epitome of the blend between the finest that tradition has to offer and the magnificent strides of modern science &amp; technology.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Various types of 'awaleh' (a fried paste of amla pulp in ghee with sugar) preparations have been made in the country over the millennia according to the Ayurvedic system of medicine. These 'awalehas' were dispensed in jars in paste<br>
form to be partaken by spoons; and were usually dosed as 2 tea-spoons morning &amp; evening. The preparations were medicinal in taste and entailed carrying a jar of the same if one were to go on tours. There was the matter of portability, leakage of the paste and need of a spoon to take the medicinal product.<br>
Furthermore, desiccation of the awaleh by continued heating and dehydration in an attempt to produce a candy resulted in a product that was extremely sticky, hard to bite and difficult to eat.<br>
INNOVATIVE ASPECT -<br>
The object of the present invention is a herbal candy which, besides being the first of its kind i.e. soft-candy, presents for the first time the awaleh preparation in single-dose candy form without the defects and deficiencies noted above; in other words the herbal soft candy is :<br>
	Very tasty, with a highly refined texture<br>
	Minimally sticky<br>
	Soft to bite and eat<br>
	Portable format - eat &amp; throw (the wrapper); can be eaten on the move.<br>
	Maintaining its texture over vast temperature variations.<br>
The innovation primarily rests on the addition of a product of modern technology Liquid glucose, to the awaleh (during the final stages of the preparation) and heating the mixture upto a precise temperature reading. Were the glucose syrup not added, and only sucrose syrup used, the awaleh would not be of soft candy consistency and texture, rather would be hard &amp; sticky. Hence, the innovation is remarkable because it results from combining the traditional knowledge with innovations of modern technology namely, liquid sugars, vaccumizers, and thermometers for precise measurements of temperature achieved.<br>
Moreover, the invention lends itself to mass production processes with ease. By the use of vacuum boilers &amp; mixers, the process can be carried out at mass scale and can be commercially viable. Lower temperatures required using vacuum would help to preserve more of the Vitamin C contained in Amla. Furthermore, different combinations of herbs using the same process results in different herbal candies which would be remedial for a large variety of disorders ranging from the common cold, cough, renal and respiratory dysfunction to anti-senility preparations. Herbal candies for preventive and promotive health can also be prepared (for the first time).<br>
In preparing the awaleh in the traditional manner the Amla (Embellica officinalis) is first boiled in a mixture of herbs namely Adhatoda vasaka.Tribulus terrestris, Solanum xanthocarpum, Solanum jacquini, Pistacia integerrima, Phyllanthus niruri, Vitis vinifera, Iris germanica, Aquilaria agallocha, Terminalia chebula,<br>
Tinospora cordifolia, Zingiber officinale, Cyperus scariosus, Boerhaavia diffusa, Santalum   album,   Elettaria   cardamomum,   Nelumbium   speciosum,   Pueraria tuberosa, Saccharum spontaneum, Hygrophila obovata, Cinnanomum cassia, Cinnamomum iners.   The seed and fibre and then separated from the pulp by sieving and the pulp then fried in ghee. The herbal decoction, in which the amla was boiled, is also stained through cloth, and a syrup obtained by adding sugar to it while heating. The fried amla pulp is then mixed with this herbal syrup and the mixture (may be called First mixture) heated till the required paste - like consistency is achieved, when the heating is discontinued and some powdered herbs and minerals (Prakshape) along with honey are added to the mixture to obtain the final awaleh. In the process of candy manufacture a vital last step is modified  to obtain  a soft candy.  This  step consists  in  adding  by weight approximately an equal amount of liquid glucose to the First mixture and then heating the mixture (which may be called the Second mixture) till it obtains a soft-ball consistency, which occurs around 238°F at usual atmospheric pressure and at much lower temperature in a vacuumizer. In one embodiment of the herbal candy, the process may be stopped here and the second mixture poured into moulds. In another embodiment of the invention, to the second mixture may be added a pulverized and sieved mixture of herbs and minerals (may be termed the Prakshape),   alongwith   honey  and   saffron   in   desired   proportions,   to   the accompaniment of vigorous stirring; or otherwise, this addition to the second mixture may be limited only to the addition of honey &amp; saffron (Crocus sativus). The Prakshape in the usual embodiment consists of Cinnamomum cassia,<br>
Cinnamomum iners, Elettaria cardamomum, Mesua ferrea, Piperaceae longum &amp;<br>
manna of Bambusa	anundinacea in desired proportions.<br>

The "desired proportions" in which the aforesaid raw herbs, minerals and honey may be used would be determined by the medical benefit desired to be obtained via the herbal candy. Flavouring of the herbal candy and sweetness may also be fine-tuned by the use of honey in desired proportions.<br>
The proportions of herbal syrup, glucose syrup &amp; invert sugar used in the preparation would depend on the final sweetness, hygroscopicity, texture and softness required. As a<br>
general rule, the proportions of herbal syrup (sucrose) &amp; glucose syrup are roughly one part of herbal syrup and two parts of glucose syrup. Hence the candy becomes one part fried amla pulp, one part herbal syrup and two parts glucose syrup.<br>
The ratio of ingredients in the herbal (decoction ) syrup is as below :<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The ratio of ingredients in the Second mixture is as below :<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The Prakshape consists of dalchini, elaichi, tejpat, nagkesar, papal and Bamboo manna in the following ratio :<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The ratio of Prakshape to the Second mixture (In the Final mixture ) is ~   1 : 42 to 48<br>
Part of the glucose syrup may be replaced by invert sugar (upto 10% by weight) and the glucose syrup should be of high D.E. (Dextrose equivalent). A high D.E. (more than 55%) implies more dextrose and maltose and little dextrin. (D.E. is the percentage of reducing sugars expressed as dextrose calculated on dry solids, and indicates the degree of hydrolysis to which the starch has been subjected during the manufacturing process).<br><br>
The herbal candy obtained by the above process has a fine texture and is soft to bite and easy to eat. It also does not stick much to the wrapper and maintains its shape and texture over wide variations of temperature, ranging from 1 - 50° C, hence no special form of storage like refrigeration is required for the temperature conditions usually prevailing in all parts of India. Humidity of the air also does not affect the storage of the candy over long periods of time and the product has a long shelf - life, easily maintaining its shape and texture for 2 - 3 years after manufacture.<br>
Another important aspect of the herbal candy, and which is also one of the objectives, is the exclusion of any type of preservatives and chemical substances in the preparation. The synthetic substances usually used in candy and chocolate manufacture are emulsifiers, stabilizers, colouring agents and preservatives. In the embodiment described above, none of these is required and the candy is free from these. Thus, any harmful effects, which may occur due to the chemical additives especially when eaten by small children, are not there in the herbal candy. In other words, the herbal soft candy has only those ingredients that promote positive health, which is the basic idea of the invention.<br>
In the following example, which illustrates a precise form of execution of the invention, the proportions are expressed by weight.<br>
Example 1 - The herbs to be used in the decoction are cleaned, weighed out and kept separately. The Amla (E.O.) is put in cloth pouches so as to fully immerse in the decoction. Now about 30 litre water is taken in a large utensil of about 80-100 litre<br>
capacity and the herbs are added, 100 gm. each herb for 20 kg. of Amla. The herbal decoction is thus prepared by boiling the Amla (in cloth pouches) and the herbs in water over a long time at usual atmospheric pressure. The process may also be carried out at lower boiling temperatures under partial vacuum. The herbs to be used in the decoction are Adusa, Chandan white, Kamal ke phool, Harad, Munakka, Bhui-amla, Elaichi, Nagar-motha, Punarnava, Badi and small kateri, Gokhru, Kakra shringi, Kak nasa, Agar, Pohkar-mool, Saunth kapoor ka, Kaons, Bidari kand, Dalchini, Tejpat, Pipal small and Giloye.<br>
When the amla is fully boiled, the pouches containing amla are taken out of the decoction and mashed over a sieve or muslin cloth to separate the seeds and fibre from the pulp. The amla pulp is then fried in ghee, using approximately 1 kg. of ghee. When the pulp is properly fried, it is taken off the burner and kept aside. The decoction, which had been simmering all along, is now sieved through cloth to obtain a clear decoction. Sugar (Sucrose) is now added to this, in a proportion of 10 kg. sugar to 6 kg. of decoction. This is heated till a thick syrup is obtained which is sieved through cloth.<br>
The fried amla pulp and syrup are now mixed and heated in the proportion: 6 kg. of pulp &amp; 6kg. of decoction syrup. Glucose syrup is soon added around equal in weight to the two (i.e. about 12 kg.) and all are heated together. When the mixture reaches the consistency of soft ball, which occurs at 238° F, the heating is stopped and to the mixture is added a pulverized &amp; sieved mixture of herbs and minerals, with vigorous stirring to create the final mixture. Honey &amp; Saffron may likewise be added. The pulverized mixture called Prakshape<br>
consists of 20gm. each of dalchini, tejpat, nagkesar, elaichi ; 160gm. of pipal &amp; 250 gm. of bamboo manna.<br>
The Herbal Candy prepared in this example is the standard 'awaleh' candy, being a derivative of chyavanprash awaleh. As such, it is beneficial for all-round growth and re-juvenation of all age groups, besides being restorative of hepatic, cardiac, pulmonary, intestinal and renal disorders. It also helps to cure common cold &amp; cough &amp; thereby also helps in prevention of rheumatic heart disease in children.<br>
Example 2 - The herbs to be used in the decoction are cleaned, weighed out and kept separately. The Amla (E.O.) is put in cloth pouches so as to fully immerse in the decoction. Now about 30 litre water is taken in a large utensil of about 80 - 100 litre capacity and the herbs are added, 100 gm. each herb for 20 kg. of Amla. The herbal decoction is thus prepared by boiling the Amla (in cloth pouches) and the herbs in water over a long time at usual atmospheric pressure. The process may also be carried out at lower boiling temperatures under partial vacuum. The herbs to be used in the decoction are Munakka, Harad, Pipli, Duralabh, Kakra shringi, Kateri, Shwet punarnava, Rakth punarnava, Bhumyamlaki.<br>
When the amla is fully boiled, the pouches containing amla are taken out of the decoction and mashed over a sieve or muslin cloth to separate the seeds and fibre from the pulp. The amla pulp is then fried in ghee, using approximately 1 kg. of ghee. When the pulp is properly fried, it is taken off the burner and kept aside. The decoction, which had been simmering all along, is now sieved through<br>
cloth to obtain a clear decoction. Sugar (Sucrose) is now added to this, in a proportion of 10 kg. sugar to 6 kg. of decoction. This is heated till a thick syrup is obtained which is sieved through cloth.<br>
The fried amla pulp and syrup are now mixed and heated in the proportion: 6 kg. of pulp &amp; 6kg. of decoction syrup. Glucose syrup is soon added around equal in weight to the two (i.e. about 12 kg,) and all are heated together. When the mixture reaches the consistency of soft ball, which occurs at 238° F, the heating is stopped.<br>
The candy produced in this example is especially designed to ameliorate cough. As such it is useful in cough due to viral and immune causes and helps to reduce convalescence time and decreases intensity of cough.<br>
It is understood that the invention is not limited to the conditions described above. For instance the finished product may be a "plain" candy, a milk candy or a candy containing nuts. It may also contain fruits. The milk candy can be manufactured with full cream milk powder, skimmed milk powder, condensed milk etc. Whether the herbal candy is "plain" or contains milk, nuts etc., it can be used for coatings, fillings, solid candy articles without additions, bars and similar products. The candy may also be coated with hardened sugar to increase its attractiveness &amp; durability<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
