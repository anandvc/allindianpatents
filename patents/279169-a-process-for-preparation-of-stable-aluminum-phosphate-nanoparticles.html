Section 10<br>
"Aluminium Phosphate Nanoparticles."<br>
Serum Institute of India Ltd, an Indian company, of 212/2, Off Soli Poonawalla Road, Hadapsar, Pune 411 028 Maharashtra India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
\\Vulkan\Patent Data\daleep\Year 2008\App!icnlion\Conventional phase\March.doc<br>
 <br>
Aluminium Phosphate Nanoparticles<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to aluminium phosphate nanoparticles and method of preparation thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Adjuvants are defined as substances used in combination with a specific antigen to enhance the immune response. An effective vaccine usually requires an adjuvant to stimulate the immune response. The only adjuvants approved for use in currently licensed vaccines are the aluminium-containing adjuvants. Aluminium hydroxide and aluminium phosphate are the most commonly used adjuvants. In 1926, the adjuvant effect of aluminium compounds was described by Glenny et. al. (Glenny AT, Pope CG, Waddington H, Wallace U. Immunological Notes XVII to XXIV. J. Pathol. 29, 31-40, 1926) . Scholtz et. al. in 1984 demonstrated that pure aluminium phosphate can be prepared using equimolar amounts of aluminium chloride and trisodium phosphate. Although such adjuvants are widely used today, aluminium phosphate adjuvants can be difficult to manufacture with reproducible properties as the experimental conditions like temperature, concentration and even rate of addition of chemicals reagents strongly influence the properties of the gel prepared. The important properties that are affected are particle size distribution, electric charge and hydrated colloid nature of the precipitate formed. These properties then affect the adsorption of antigen and thus the immunogenicity of the antigen.<br>
 <br>
Subcutaneous administration of vaccines is considered as the most appropriate route for delivering an antigen to secondary lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes where adaptive immunity is initiated. It is known that the fate of the particles following subcutaneous administration depends on the size of the particles. Large particles, having a size greater than 1 micron are unable to access and drain into the lymphatics and may not be phagocytosed. readily and they are retained at the injection site until they degrade to a sufficiently small size. On the contrary, small particles having a size less than 1 micron enter lymphatic capillaries, which form a one-way drainage system connected to the lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes and lymphatic ducts, respectively. Particles with a diameter less than 100 nm enter the lymphatic capillaries through gaps between the lymphatic endothelial cells while particles having diameter between 100 nm to 1 micron are phagocytosed by antigen representing cells such as dendritic cells which subsequently passage into the lymphatic capillaries.<br>
Nanoparticles of adjuvants are considered to be the most promising system for delivery of antigen to the draining lymph nodes following subcutaneous administration. Nanoparticles are defined as particles with diameter ranging from 1 to 1000 nm.<br>
Nanometer size particles were used as carrier particles in the prior art. See 5178882,  5219577,  5306508,  5334394, 5460830, 5462750 and 5464634. The paricles described herein are in the range of 10 to 200 nm size range and are difficult to make with a degree of consistency.<br>
 <br>
Calcium phosphate particles have been under investigation as an alternative to aluminium-containing adjuvants in parenteral vaccines. Calcium Phosphate particles (&gt;1000nm) as vaccine adjuvants are unsuitable due to inferior adjuvanting activity and possess a rough and oblong morphology. (Goto et. al., Vaccine, vol.15, no. 12-13, 1364-1371, 1997).<br>
US 6355271 discusses a method for preparing one or more particles of calcium phosphate having diameters between about 3 00 nm to about 4000 nm, comprising reacting a soluble calcium salt with a soluble phosphate salt, wherein the reaction comprises: (a) mixing an aqueous solution of calcium chloride with an aqueous solution of sodium citrate to form a mixture, (b) adding an aqueous solution of sodium phosphate to the mixture to form a solution, (c) stirring the solution until particles of the desired size and comprising calcium phosphate are obtained and co-crystallized with antigenic material. The particles of size more than 1000 nm may not be phagocytosed and therefore are not suitable as adjuvants.<br>
WO 2007/098186 discloses a composition prepared by combining one or more oils, one or more non-ionic: surfactants, optionally one or more sterols, aluminium salt and an aqueous phase. The aluminium phosphate particles prepared therein range from 50 nm to 5000 nm and are stabilized by the surfactants added therein.<br>
WO 2008/009592 discloses a method of preparing nanoparticles of metal phosphates with desired particle<br>
 <br>
size, size distribution and purity wherein the method involves atomization of the solution in a reactor in excess of 100 deg C wherein the said temperature is selected in such a way that the organic acid and the water evaporate from the solution to produce nanoscale particles. Such process seems to be hazardous and teadious.<br>
The instant invention overcomes the drawbacks of. the prior art and provides a method for production of nanoparticles of aluminium phosphate with particle diameter less than 1000 nm, preferably 10 to 600 nm.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The first embodiment of the instant invention is the stable nanoparticles of aluminium phosphate with particle diameter less than 1000 nm.<br>
The second embodiment of the instant invention is the process for preparation of the stable nanoparticles of aluminium phosphate with particle diameter less than 1000 run.<br>
Specifically, the stable nanoparticles of aluminium phosphate are of diameter less than 600 nm, preferably between 10 to 600 nm. The particle size or mean particle size of the nanoparticles can be controlled and the particle size distribution can be restricted to a desired level. The process of preparation of aluminium phosphate nanoparticles is a simple and robust process which produces<br>
 <br>
the particles of desired diameter. The process produced nanoparticles with high degree of consistency in terms of properties of the particles.<br>
The aluminium phosphate gel used for preparation of the nanoparticles can be prepared in situ or aluminium phosphate powder can be dissolved in suitable buffer before size reduction.<br>
The nanoparticles of the instant invention can be prepared from aluminium phosphate gel or precipitate. The pH of the solution can be adjusted to a desired pH in the range of 6 to 10. The preferred pH is around 7.0. The particles can be prepared by treating the gel with either a homogenizer or a sonicator. Appropriate technical parameters e.g. pressure, frequency, speed or amplitude of the homogenizer or sonicator can be adjusted to produce particles of desired size. The particles thus obtained can be stabilized in a suitable buffer. The preferred buffer is phosphate buffer of pH 7.0. The buffer can be the buffer used to formulate the final vaccine.<br>
