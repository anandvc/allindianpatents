				<td>Self-adhesive film for teeth<br>
The present invention relates to film-shaped preparations<br>
which are pressure-sensitive adhesive to teeth, gums or the<br>
oral mucosa and which are suitable for cosmetic or medical<br>
treatment of the teeth, especially the tooth necks, and of<br>
the gums. In addition, the present invention relates to a<br>
process for the manufacture of such film-shaped preparations<br>
Products for cleaning one's mouth and for active substance<br>
delivery having the form of pastes, creams or mouth rinses<br>
have long since been known and have been available on the<br>
market. These products include tooth pastes and creams<br>
which have a cleaning effect, protect against caries, are<br>
desensitizing, or have a bleaching effect. Also known are<br>
creams, gels and ointments that are applied in the oral region<br>
for treating local illnesses and disorders such as<br>
anti-inflammatory remedies, analgesic remedies and/or tonics<br>
For some years, film-shaped, flat-shaped or strip-shaped<br>
oral application forms, too, have been commercially available<br>
and are used for cosmetic or therapeutic purposes.<br>
These application forms include, for example, the Listerine<br>
Pocket-PaksÂ® by Pfizer or the "Teeth Whitestrips" by Procter<br>
&amp; Gamble. Such application forms are as a rule based on<br>
films made up of water-soluble polymers which on use disintegrate<br>
rather quickly and are therefore not suitable for a<br>
longer-lasting treatment.<br>
In addition, products are known that consist of several<br>
layers, such as those disclosed in US 6,582,708, which,<br>
In addition, products are known that consist of several<br>
layers, such as those disclosed in US 6,582,708, which,<br>
however, include only one flexible layer and which, due to<br>
their overall thickness of up to 3 mm, are disturbing and<br>
unpleasant in the mouth.<br>
The recipes and methods used in the manufacture of the<br>
known film-shaped application forms, for the most part,<br>
start from water or from water-containing alcoholic polymer<br>
solutions. A disadvantage here is that there are limitations<br>
to preparing a completely dissolved formulation of<br>
lipophile, poorly water-soluble active substances or of active<br>
substances that are sensitive to water.<br>
The object of the present invention was thus to provide a<br>
mono- or multilayered, water-soluble or at least partially<br>
water-swellable, film-shaped material which has good adhesion<br>
to teeth, gums or the oral mucosa, which is suitable<br>
as active substance carrier, and which does not already<br>
disintegrate within a few seconds. More particularly, the<br>
object is to provide a film-shaped material of the aforementioned<br>
type which enables administration of waterinsoluble<br>
or water-sensitive active substances.<br>
This object is achieved by providing a mono- or multilayered,<br>
pressure-sensitive-adhesive, film-shaped preparation<br>
which contains at least one polymethyl vinyl ether-maleic<br>
acid anhydride copolymer, polyvinyl acetate and/or at least<br>
one copolymer of the vinyl acetate with vinyl alcohol esters<br>
of fatty acids, as well as at least one cosmetic<br>
and/or pharmaceutically active substance.<br>
Preferably, the content of polymethyl vinyl ether-maleic<br>
acid anhydride copolymer in the film-shaped, pressure sensitive<br>
adhesive preparations is 5 to 35%-wt.<br>
The content of polyvinyl acetate and/or of the copolymer(s)<br>
of the vinyl acetate with vinyl alcohol esters of fatty acids<br>
in the film-shaped, pressure-sensitive-adhesive preparations<br>
preferably amounts to 4 to 35%-wt.<br>
The film-shaped, pressure-sensitive adhesive preparations<br>
in addition have a content of at least one cosmetic and/or<br>
pharmaceutical active substance which is determined by the<br>
nature of the illness or by the cosmetic needs. The active<br>
substance is preferably a poorly water-soluble active substance<br>
or a water-sensitive active substance.<br>
The term "poorly water-soluble active substances" is understood<br>
to mean such active substances as have a solubility<br>
in water of less than 1 g/1. These include, for example,<br>
griseofulvin, estradiol and vitamin D3.<br>
The water-sensitive active substances include those active<br>
substances, the aqueous solution of which looses more than<br>
0.1% of its active substance content within 24 hours at<br>
room temperature due to decomposition of the active substance.<br>
The water-sensitive active substances include, for<br>
example, acetylsalicylic acid and iodine.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the film-shaped,<br>
pressure-sensitive adhesive preparation in addition contains<br>
carboxrymethyl cellulose and/or one of its salts. The<br>
content of carboxymethyl cellulose or of one of its salts<br>
in the preparation amounts to 5 to 35%-wt.<br>
To manufacture the film-shaped preparations, which are<br>
pressure-sensitive adhesive on teeth, gums or the oral mucosa,<br>
the various, water-soluble and/or water-swellable<br>
polymers are mixed with at least one active substance in<br>
solutions containing organic solvents as main component.<br>
This mixture is used to coat a substrate, and the coated<br>
substrate is dried, optionally by application of heat.<br>
The advantages of the invention arise especially where mixtures<br>
of polymethyl vinyl ether-maleic acid anhydride copolymers<br>
with polyvinyl acetate or the copolymers of the<br>
vinyl acetate with vinyl alcohol esters of fatty acids, are<br>
used.<br>
The content of polymethyl vinyl ether-maleic acid anhydride<br>
copolymer is preferably 5 to 35%-wt., and the content of<br>
polyvinyl acetate and/or the copolymer(s) of the vinyl acetate<br>
with vinyl alcohol esters of fatty acids is preferably<br>
4 to 35%-wt., in each case relative to the solids content.<br>
The polymethyl vinyl ether-maleic acid anhydride copolymers<br>
sold under the name of "GantrezÂ®" by the firm of ISP, and<br>
the polyvinyl acetates or copolymers of the vinyl acetate<br>
with vinyl alcohol esters of fatty acids, designated as<br>
"VINNAPASÂ®", of the firm of Wacker Polymer Systems,<br>
Burghausen, have proved to be particularly suitable in accordance<br>
with the present invention.<br>
Any solvents which dissolve the polymethyl vinyl ethermaleic<br>
acid anhydride copolymers and polyvinyl acetate or<br>
copolymers of the vinyl acetate with vinyl alcohol esters<br>
of fatty acids may be used as the organic solvents which,<br>
in the method according to the invention, are contained in<br>
the solution as the main component thereof. Of these organic<br>
solvents, those are used with preference which also<br>
mix with water since by adding small amounts of water, e.g.<br>
of 1 to 5%-wt., the dissolving power for the polymers and<br>
the active substance/active substances can be adapted to<br>
the given requirements. Particular preference is given to<br>
those organic solvents which permit addition of the active<br>
substance dissolved in ethanol or in an ethanol-water mixture.<br>
The especially preferred organic solvent is selected<br>
from the group comprising methyl ethyl ketone, ethyl acetate,<br>
ethanol, acetone and mixtures thereof.<br>
The consistency and/or tackiness of the resultant filmshaped<br>
preparations can be adapted to the demands placed on<br>
the product by altering the mixing ratio of ethanol and<br>
methyl ethyl ketone. Solvent mixtures containing an ethanol<br>
portion of 5 to 20%-wt., relative to the total solvent,<br>
have proved advantageous.<br>
To manufacture a preferred embodiment enabling a particularly<br>
successful adhesion of the film-shaped preparations<br>
Multilayer/ pressure-sensitive-adhesive film-shaped preparations,<br>
with which it is possible to achieve, for example,<br>
an, improved adhesion of the preparation to teeth, can be<br>
prepared, for example, by hot lamination, by coating already<br>
existent layers with further solvent-containing compounds,<br>
as described hereinabove in connection with the<br>
manufacture of a monolayer film, or by other processes<br>
known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Pieces having a size appropriate to the respective given<br>
purposes are then punched out from the film or laminate.<br>
The process according to the present invention results in<br>
film-shaped preparations which adhere to teeth, gums or the<br>
oral mucosa, which do not already disintegrate within a few<br>
seconds, and by means of which water-insoluble and even water-<br>
sensitive active substances can be administered. These<br>
preparations may advantageously be utilised for medical or<br>
cosmetic treatments.<br>
Example:<br>
5g of a 33.3% solution (%-wt.) of a vinyl acetate-based<br>
polymer in methyl ethyl ketone and 3 g of a 15% solution<br>
(%-wt.) of polymethyl vinyl ether-maleic acid anhydride (=<br>
copolymer of methyl vinyl ether and maleic acid anhydride)<br>
in ethyl acetate were added together and homogenised. This<br>
resulted in a solution which was spread at various coating<br>
thicknesses and, subsequently, dried. This yielded flexible<br>
films which adhered both to the oral mucosa and to the<br>
teeth.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
