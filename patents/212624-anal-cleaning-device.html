ANAL CLEANING DEVICE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an anal cleaning device, preferably in the form of a personal hegiene device such as a mini bidet or douche. The anal cleaning device can be used as a hand held device, and may be used in conjunction with the normal low down flushing suite within a toilet facility. However it can also be used in conjunction with non flushing, open and squat down toilet pits as exist in some European and Asian countries, and in other toiletry contexts.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
Anal cleaning falls into a number of categories:<br>
1. Wiping with paper is by far the most common method used and, whilst commonly accepted, has certain problems in as much as it can be messy, and normal hygiene requires the hands to be washed after the anus is wiped.<br>
Wiping with paper is generally not a perfect way of cleaning the anal area. It can cause the irritation and cross contamination to other areas. It can cause the spread of bacteria from hands to food when washing of one's hands is not performed or is inadequate. Also, paper in toilets is prone to run out especially in public toilets. Paper consumption for this operation is enormous.<br>
Excessive use of paper by any one user can cause a blockage in the toilet bowl and happens quite frequently on sea going vessels. A person using this method also has to be of normal build proportions to be physically able to accomplish<br><br>
the reaching of the area concerned and completing wiping operation. People with physical disabilities such as bad backs, arthritis, injured hands wrists, arms, shoulders or any other injury which immobilises the dexterous side of the body are often unable to complete the task of wiping with paper.<br>
For example a right-handed person who is post operational eg. from a right shoulder rotata cuff tendon syndrome, whereby the right arm is immobilized, can suddenly find the task most difficult and sometimes impossible to accomplish with left hand.<br>
2. Bidets use water jets in toilet bowls. This apparatus is used more frequently in continental countries and is somewhat more hygienic. However there are certain difficulties experienced with this method, in as much as copious quantities of water are used and a large area to be dried, using once again a lot of paper and/or a towel which then has to be washed.<br>
Bidets are additionally installed dedicated devices which are generally more expensive than the normal low down flushing toilet suite. Bidet devices fitted to a low down flushing suite have a number of problems associated with the installation and use of the devices. The following documents are examples: U.S. Patent No. 1,818,388 U.S. Patent No. 2,852,782 U.S. Patent No.3,513,487, and U.S. Patent No. 4,259,754.<br>
These bidet devices are designed to be retrofitted to conventional flushing toilet bowls and often require extensive modifications to the normal plumbing installations. Furthermore the spray heads of these devices and dedicated bidets are mounted in a fixed position necessitating the use of a copious quantities of water, wetting a large area in the endeavour to accomplish through cleaning of the anus. A question of the hygienic state of these devices also exists due to the possibility of improper cleaning of the device after each usage.<br><br>
3) Hand held Bidets and Douches are also known. Examples include:<br>
U.S. Patent No.3,110,038, U.S.Patent No.3,662, U.S. Patent No.3/797,481, U.S. Patent No.3,882,864, U.S. Patent No.4,000,742, U.S. Patent No. 4,197,594, U.S.Patent No.4,205,402, U.S. Patent No,.4,510,630, U.S. Patent No.4,596,058, AU-B-63102/90, CA2149839, DE4421424, JP2000-051313, JP09262187, JP2000-093483 and JP2000-070325.<br>
The prior art hand held devices incorporating water sprays can be used to clean the anal area but are such that the positioning of the water spray is by the operation of the device and the sensitive feel of the water spray on the user's body skin. The operation of such devices whereby one cannot see the area to be cleaned requires guesswork and dexterity by the operator.<br>
Such prior art hand held cleaning devices can cause damage if held in contact with the surface of body parts. Such prior art devices can also cause cross contamination and infection to other parts of the body.<br>
Prior art hand held bidets and douches in the main tend to wet a large area which has to be dried. This in itself becomes a problem.<br>
It would be advantageous if a device could be provided that is simple to manufacture and use. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an anal cleaning device comprising of a fluid flow directing member connectable to a fluid source and having a fluid oudet for directing fluid from the source out of the member ; and a wall member projecting out from the flow directing member near the fluid outlet and positionable at a perineum of a user such that, when located thereat, the wall member spaces the fluid outlet from the user's anus and tends to prevent fluid<br><br>
from reaching that side of the wall member opposite to the fluid oudet side of the wall member.<br>
The device can be provided in a personal hygienic hand held format for anal cleaning and can also be used in conjunction with a conventional toilet-flushing unit. Further, it can be used in other toilet facilities where there is a supply of pressurized water. Whilst typically the device is used for releasing liquids (such as water), it can also be used to direct gases (such as air) for anal drying, deodorising and sanitising purposes.<br>
In accordance with the present invention advantageously the flow directing member and the wall member can be manufactured simply. In addition, the wall member can help locate the device (eliminating guesswork) and can prevent liquid and faeces splashing forwards toward the genital area. In this regard, the wall member of the present invention can enable easy and correct positioning of the device by allowing the user to feel that the device is in the correct position. This feature is even more important when the user has the use of only one arm. Also, as a hand held unit, the device can be easily positioned and operated efficiently and effectively, and used to wet only a small area.<br>
Preferably the flow directing member is a cleaning head, with the wall member formed integrally with the head to project orthogonally therefrom and intermediate a first end connectable to a fluid source line and a second opposite end near which the fluid outlet is located. For example, the wall member can be moulded or formed integrally with the cleaning head (eg. From plastics, or cast from metal).<br><br>
Preferably, the wall member is generally trapezoidal in shape, tapering outwardly from a relatively narrower base, mounted at the flow-directing member, to a relatively wider remote free end.<br>
Preferably, the wall member remote end is an edge adapted for close (and thereby comfortable) positioning at the user's perineum. Preferably the edge is a curved and rounded, and also has a curvature along its length that is adapted for close positioning at the perineum.<br>
Preferably the wall member is relatively stiff or inflexible.<br>
Preferably the device is adapted for use with a conventional low down suit within a toilet facility.<br>
Preferably the flow directing member is connected via, a fluid conveying rod to a handle. In this regard, the handle typically comprises a separate component in the device, however can also be defined by a part of the conveying rod itself. Preferably the rod is also relatively inflexible such that, in conjunction with the handle, it can be used to position the wall member at the user's perineum.<br>
Preferably the flow directing member is defined by or at a remote end of the fluid conveying rod away from the handle. Also, the rod can be bent intermediate its ends, to aid angled positioning of the wall member adjacent to the anus.<br>
As an alternative, the wall member can be mounted at the rod remote end either directly or via a collar which is slidable along and selectively fastenable at the rod remote end.<br>
Preferably the handle incorporates a means for controlling a supply of typically pressurized liquid from a flexible conduit attached to an inlet to the<br><br>
handle. Preferably the controlling means is a manually operated, easily opened, but normally biased-shut piston valve.<br>
Preferably, the valve is configured such that differential forces from pressurised liquid within the handle, typically resulting from a pressurized liquid supply control tap being opened, keeps the valve normally shut.<br>
Preferably the piston valve is opened with a force applied against a spring-return lever fitted into the handle. Preferably the lever pivots about a fulcrum point and, in so doing, an opposing end of the lever, which typically has toggle forked legs which typically has toggle forked legs which straddle the piston valve, transfers such force, and the piston valve is then moved to an open position.<br>
Preferably the volume of flow through the device is reduced by restricted passages within the piston valve. Preferably a body of the handle is through-bored, and in which bore the piston valve is arranged, the piston valve having a bore extending partway therethrough, the piston valve interacting with the handle such that, in a closed position, the piston valve closes the through-bore of the handle, and in an open position liquid flows through the handle via the bore of the piston valve, and thence out of the device. Thus, when the piston valve is open, liquid is supplied to the flow directing member, (eg. via the fluid conveying rod) and thence to the fluid outlet where it typically discharges as a jet or jets to the anus.<br>
The device can be operated externally to the toilet bowl by depressing the lever within the handle, and the handle can be fixed at any rotational position to suit the user. In this regard, the handle can be assembled at any degree of angular rotation in relation to the anal cleaning head, as required by incapacitated people.<br><br>
The anal cleaning device can include a fail-safe mechanism such that a small force only is required for the operation of the device, to ensure that the liquid supply is easily stopped.<br>
The wall member is preferably sized and configured to prevent an end of the flow directing member from accidentally being directly inserted into any aperture of the body.<br>
Preferably the cleaning device can be stored in a sanitary position outside the toilet bowl within easy reach of the user, preferably within the confines of a container in which is held a quantity of disinfectant solution for washing the cleaning head of the device, In this regard, preferably the hygienic storage container is either wall or floor mounted. The storage container preferably incorporates a sump of disinfectant solution so that the anal cleaning head can be dunked, before the device is located in a holding bracket to drip-dry for the next user. However, as stated above, the cleaning head and conveying rod can be easily disconnected for storage.<br>
The cleaning head and fluid conveying rod may also be detached from the handle and, if necessary, washed over the low down suite bowl with the water spray from the handle, and then stored out of sight. This also allows for the use of various cleaning heads, and may be a preferred aesthetic feature for the user of the device.<br>
The device can be economically viably manufactured a personal hygienic device which is inexpensive to purchase and fit to a toilet suite and which, with modern production techniques, can be made light weight (eg. mainly or entirely of plastics) and readily accessible for disabled people.<br><br>
Advantageously, the device can be operated with one hand, thus allowing handicapped and disabled people usage thereof. The device can also reduce the use of toilet paper.<br>
The pressurised liquid supplied to the device is preferably via a conveniently positioned wall mounted tap, preferably lever operated. For simplicity, and because domestic water pressure varies from one location to another, this tap can be opened to give approximately the liquid pressure desired by the user. Users can thereafter become familiar with their requirements.<br>
Alternatively an installation can be provided that incorporates a pressure control valve and mixing device utilizing eg. hot and cold water.<br>
The fluid conveying rod can be made from aUuminium for lightness or stainless steel if a more durable product is required. Preferably the whole device is lightweight.<br>
Preferably the fluid conveying rod is of sufficient length to enable the device to be operated external to the toilet bowl, however may be shortened, eg. for users who prefer a shorter offset rod version. Typically the end of the conveying rod is an open tube for insertion into the cleaning head. Preferably the cleaning head has at least one fluid oudet in the form of an orifice which comes into communication with the liquid supply when the hand operated valve in the handle is opened.<br>
Also, interchangeable cleaning heads having varying configurations of liquid jets can be provided, thus offering a user a choice of different cleaning actions, as may be required.<br>
Preferably the wall member is located adjacent to the fluid outlet. Preferably the wall member is generally perpendicular to an axis of the fluid conveying rod. As stated above, the wall member may be separately affixed to the rod.<br><br>
The direction of the ensuing liquid jet exiting the fluid oudet through the device or is angled slighdy rearward of perpendicular.<br>
Furthermore preferably all corners and edges of the device are preferably rounded so to prevent bodily damage.<br>
Preferably the fluid conveying rod is a hollow circular-sectioned tube, but can be of any shape as may be desired.<br>
Preferably the fluid oudet (eg. orifice) is circular without limiting the use of other jet shapes which might be used.<br>
Also, in certain installations it may be considered advantageous to have heated liquid supplied from a modern state of the art mixing device at a constant preset temperature and/or pressure.<br>
Thus, in accordance with the present invention the wall member maintains a definite distance between the oudet and the surface of the anus. The device therefore prevents damage which could otherwise be caused if the spray jet were to be accidentally positioned to close or inserted into the anus, which is a possibility with many prior art devices.<br>
Thus this invention is for an anal cleaning device comprising of a fluid flow directing member connectable to a fluid source and having a fluid oudet for directing fluid from the source out of the member; and a wall member projecting out from the flow directing member near the fluid oudet and positionable at a perineum of a user such that, when located thereat, the wall member spaces the fluid oudet from the user's anus and tends to prevent fluid from reaching that side of the wall member opposite to the fluid oudet side of the wall member.<br><br>

Referring firstly to Figures 1 to 9, where like reference numerals represent similar or like parts, Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a first preferred anal cleaning device 1 in accordance with the present invention. The device 1 includes a handle 13 having various parts as shown in Figures 5 to 8. A Flexible supply tube 14 is connected to the handle and pressurized water is supplied thereto, typically from a wall mounted tap, preferably of the lever operated type.<br>
The device includes a fluid conveying rod in the form of a hollow cylindrical bent tube 12 (bent at 12b) with the length and bent being sufficient to allow for easy positioning of the device eg. with one's forearm resting on one's thigh.<br>
The device also includes a cleaning head 2 having a partly hollow (Figure 3) cleaning head body 10. A wall member in the form of flange 11 projects generally orthogonally from the body 10. The flange 11 is typically integrally formed (eg. moulded or machined) with body 10, although it may be fitted separately to the device (eg. by sliding a collar lie (Figure 12) over the end of tube 12). A single orifice 10a is formed in the cleaning head body 10, however, multiple orifices may be employed as appropriate. The cleaning head<br><br>
is further detailed in Figures 2, 3, 4.<br>
Figure 2 shows an end view of the cleaning head at its connection end (ie. Where it connects to tube 12). In this regard, the tube 12 is inserted snugly into a tubular recess 10b of body 10 (Figure 3) which in turn opens onto a narrower recess 10c, defining a shoulder lOd against which an end of tube 12 can abut (eg. sealingly via an o-ring (not shown). Thus the head 2 can be permanently or releasable attached to the end of tube 12 via any suitable means including adhesive, welding, grub screw(s), screw threading, bayonet fitting, ball detent, interference, friction or snap -fitting etc.<br>
The flange 11 is plate-like and generally trapezoidal in shape, having a rounded fee end lip 11a and curved ends lib. Lip 11a functions as a positioning bar and accordingly is circular in cross section and rounded on the ends of the arc as shown, to be optimally shaped to sit generally flush against a user's perineum.<br>
The orifice 10a is typically an upwardly directed jet, such that water which issues forth from the orifice 10a is directed parallel to and in-line with a centre line of the flange 11 (ie. In-line with the centre of the lip 11a). Alternatively the orifice can be defined such that exiting water is directed to issue back towards flange 11 (ie as an angled stream). The cleaning head and flange can be manufactured from stainless steel components, as a single piece polished investment casting, as cast porcelain or other ceramic , or preferably injection moulded from plastic material.<br>
Figure 4 shows a perspective view of the tube 12 and cleaning head 2. In this embodiment the flange and orifice are moulded integrally to form a unitary cleaning head. The tube 12 is then fastened into the cleaning head.<br><br>
Figure 5 shows a cross-sectional detailed view of the handle 13, including a fragmentary sectional view of a piston valve 18 and operating trigger lever 17.<br>
Figure 6 shows a side view of the piston valve body 18 and Figure 7 shows a side view of the operating lever 17 and a biasing lever spring 24 as a singular moulded piece. Figure 8 shows an end view of the operating lever showing the forked toggle 25 which straddles the piston valve 18.<br>
When assembled fulcrum bearings 17a of lever 17 fit into place on fulcrum pins moulded into the valve body recess for the operating lever. The handle is configured such that a light force is required to depress trigger lever 17. When so depressed the lever pivots on fulcrum bearings 17a, moving against biasing lever spring 24, the end of which slides in recess 28. In so pivoting the toggle legs 25, which straddle the piston valve body 18 at recess 26, urge the piston valve towards the handle inlet end I (so marked).<br>
Valve body 18 is positioned to slide in this passage. A liquid flow passage 13a extends right through handle 13. Valve body 18 has a longitudinal bore 29 extending almost completely therethrough, inwardly from its end adjacent inlet end I. A laterally extending passage 30 connects to bore 29 and opens onto an adjacent part of passage 13a. The valve body 18 has a closed opposite plug end 31, having an adjacent annular recess 32 into which a flexible sealing ring (eg. O-ring) can be located.<br>
In a normal orientation of the handle, the plug end 31 closes part of passage 13a (ie. The restricted part at shoulder 33) to prevent liquid flow therethrough. Thus, liquid leaving passage 30 is stagnant in the adjacent part of passage 13a so that the device is closed to fluid flow. However, when the lever 17 is depressed it urges the valve body towards inlet I. The plug end 31 opens the<br><br>
passage adjacent to shoulder 33, thus bringing the inlet I into fluid communication with tube 12, so that liquid can flow through the device, flowing through the valve body.<br>
When lever 17 is released, water pressure moves piston 18 back and/or the spring 24 pivots the lever 17 back away from handle 13, thus returning the valve body 18 to its position in Figure 5, and returning plug end 31 into a sealing configuration. In this regard, spring 24 is typically a leaf spring which assists to close the piston valve when the liquid pressure is insufficient to piston valve when the liquid pressure is insufficient to close the piston valve by differential pressure, the leaf spring acting as a fail-safe mechanism. This again closes passage 13a to liquid flow therethrough.<br>
The handle 13 has an externally threaded male connection 27 at the inlet end, which is compatible with and attachable to a flexible plumbing pressure hose (see Figure 1).<br>
The handle 13 is internally finished to accommodate the ready sliding of piston valve body 18 therein, Valve body 18 also has either two or four O-rings 19 fitted at 19a and 19b (ie. On either side of toggle legs 25) to prevent liquid flow around its outside, thereby preventing loss of liquid through the operating lever aperture. The sealing ring at plug end 31 prevents flow in the closed position.<br>
Tube 12 is a sliding fit in the recess provided in handle 13. To connect tube 12 to handle 13, a nut 22 having a conical female internal face 23 is tightened against a mating conical male thin-walled section 34 in handle 13. The internal face of the thin-walled conical section 34 is a close fit on the tube 12. When tightened the conical sections provide a clamping effect on tube 12. Screwed nut 22 has recessed grip sections 21 on its outer periphery and is a sliding fit on<br><br>
tube 12 in. This arrangement thus supports the tube 12 in, and affixes it to, the handle 13, but also allows it to be released therefrom for cleaning, servicing, interchange or replacement.<br>
Fig.9 shows a cross sectional view of a container 15 for the storage of the device between uses. The cross sectional shape of the container base 15a can be circular, square, rectangular or any other shape which fits the confines of a toilet area, in which the device is used. Disinfectant solution 16 is located in the receptacle defined by base 15a, and into which the cleaning head 2 can be immersed and agitated for cleaning/ disinfecting. A lateral bracket 15b supports the device above solution 16 so that it can drip dry prior to its next use.<br>
Referring now to Figures 10 to 17, where like reference numerals are used to denote similar or like parts, alternative anal cleaning devices are depicted.<br>
The handle 13 is essentially the same as the first embodiment except that leaf spring 24 is replaced by a helical spring captured within lever 17.<br>
In Figure 10 the cleaning head 2 is again fitted onto the end of tube 12 as shown, with the flange 11 again extending out from body 10. However, in Figures 11 to 13 the tube 12 is closed at tube end 12a, with the orifice 10a being defined (eg. formed or drilled) into tube end 12a. Thus, in this the body 10 is defined by tube end 12a. Also, in this embodiment flange 11 extends from a collar lie which is slid on to the tube end 12a and then fastened thereto adjacent orifice 10a(eg. via welding, adhesive, grub screw, screw thread etc). Thus, the tube 12 can be detached from the handle 13 as described above, and the flange 11 can also be detached from the tube 12, for cleaning, servicing, interchange, replacement etc.<br><br>
Also, the flange 11 of the Figures 10 to 13 is thinner in profile than flange 11 of the first embodiment. In other respects the cleaning devices are similar or the same.<br>
The tube 12 can be interchanged as described above so that shorter or longer, bent or straight tubes can be employed as appropriate. In addition, different flange sizes can be employed for different users.   Also heads having multiple orifices can be employed.<br>
The supply tube 14 can be connected to a toilet water supply and to a pressure regulator as appropriate. Alternatively it may be connected to a hot/cold water mixer for delivering cleaning water of appropriate temperature. It may also be able to be selectively connected to an air supply eg. from central healing, for anal drying after washing.<br>
Typically many of the components are formed from injection moulded plastics or corrosion-resistant metals such as aluminium and stainless steel.<br>
Whilst the invention has been described with reference to a number of preferred embodiments, it will be appreciated that it can be embodied in many other forms.<br>

ANAL CLEANING DEVICE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an anal cleaning device, preferably in the form of a personal hegiene device such as a mini bidet or douche. The anal cleaning device can be used as a hand held device, and may be used in conjunction with the normal low down flushing suite within a toilet facility. However it can also be used in conjunction with non flushing, open and squat down toilet pits as exist in some European and Asian countries, and in other toiletry contexts.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
Anal cleaning falls into a number of categories:<br>
1. Wiping with paper is by far the most common method used and, whilst commonly accepted, has certain problems in as much as it can be messy, and normal hygiene requires the hands to be washed after the anus is wiped.<br>
Wiping with paper is generally not a perfect way of cleaning the anal area. It can cause the irritation and cross contamination to other areas. It can cause the spread of bacteria from hands to food when washing of one's hands is not performed or is inadequate. Also, paper in toilets is prone to run out especially in public toilets. Paper consumption for this operation is enormous.<br>
Excessive use of paper by any one user can cause a blockage in the toilet bowl and happens quite frequently on sea going vessels. A person using this method also has to be of normal build proportions to be physically able to accomplish<br><br>
the reaching of the area concerned and completing wiping operation. People with physical disabilities such as bad backs, arthritis, injured hands wrists, arms, shoulders or any other injury which immobilises the dexterous side of the body are often unable to complete the task of wiping with paper.<br>
For example a right-handed person who is post operational eg. from a right shoulder rotata cuff tendon syndrome, whereby the right arm is immobilized, can suddenly find the task most difficult and sometimes impossible to accomplish with left hand.<br>
2. Bidets use water jets in toilet bowls. This apparatus is used more frequently in continental countries and is somewhat more hygienic. However there are certain difficulties experienced with this method, in as much as copious quantities of water are used and a large area to be dried, using once again a lot of paper and/or a towel which then has to be washed.<br>
Bidets are additionally installed dedicated devices which are generally more expensive than the normal low down flushing toilet suite. Bidet devices fitted to a low down flushing suite have a number of problems associated with the installation and use of the devices. The following documents are examples: U.S. Patent No. 1,818,388 U.S. Patent No. 2,852,782 U.S. Patent No.3,513,487, and U.S. Patent No. 4,259,754.<br>
These bidet devices are designed to be retrofitted to conventional flushing toilet bowls and often require extensive modifications to the normal plumbing installations. Furthermore the spray heads of these devices and dedicated bidets are mounted in a fixed position necessitating the use of a copious quantities of water, wetting a large area in the endeavour to accomplish through cleaning of the anus. A question of the hygienic state of these devices also exists due to the possibility of improper cleaning of the device after each usage.<br><br>
3) Hand held Bidets and Douches are also known. Examples include:<br>
U.S. Patent No.3,110,038, U.S.Patent No.3,662, U.S. Patent No.3/797,481, U.S. Patent No.3,882,864, U.S. Patent No.4,000,742, U.S. Patent No. 4,197,594, U.S.Patent No.4,205,402, U.S. Patent No,.4,510,630, U.S. Patent No.4,596,058, AU-B-63102/90, CA2149839, DE4421424, JP2000-051313, JP09262187, JP2000-093483 and JP2000-070325.<br>
The prior art hand held devices incorporating water sprays can be used to clean the anal area but are such that the positioning of the water spray is by the operation of the device and the sensitive feel of the water spray on the user's body skin. The operation of such devices whereby one cannot see the area to be cleaned requires guesswork and dexterity by the operator.<br>
Such prior art hand held cleaning devices can cause damage if held in contact with the surface of body parts. Such prior art devices can also cause cross contamination and infection to other parts of the body.<br>
Prior art hand held bidets and douches in the main tend to wet a large area which has to be dried. This in itself becomes a problem.<br>
It would be advantageous if a device could be provided that is simple to manufacture and use. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an anal cleaning device comprising of a fluid flow directing member connectable to a fluid source and having a fluid oudet for directing fluid from the source out of the member ; and a wall member projecting out from the flow directing member near the fluid outlet and positionable at a perineum of a user such that, when located thereat, the wall member spaces the fluid outlet from the user's anus and tends to prevent fluid<br><br>
from reaching that side of the wall member opposite to the fluid oudet side of the wall member.<br>
The device can be provided in a personal hygienic hand held format for anal cleaning and can also be used in conjunction with a conventional toilet-flushing unit. Further, it can be used in other toilet facilities where there is a supply of pressurized water. Whilst typically the device is used for releasing liquids (such as water), it can also be used to direct gases (such as air) for anal drying, deodorising and sanitising purposes.<br>
In accordance with the present invention advantageously the flow directing member and the wall member can be manufactured simply. In addition, the wall member can help locate the device (eliminating guesswork) and can prevent liquid and faeces splashing forwards toward the genital area. In this regard, the wall member of the present invention can enable easy and correct positioning of the device by allowing the user to feel that the device is in the correct position. This feature is even more important when the user has the use of only one arm. Also, as a hand held unit, the device can be easily positioned and operated efficiently and effectively, and used to wet only a small area.<br>
Preferably the flow directing member is a cleaning head, with the wall member formed integrally with the head to project orthogonally therefrom and intermediate a first end connectable to a fluid source line and a second opposite end near which the fluid outlet is located. For example, the wall member can be moulded or formed integrally with the cleaning head (eg. From plastics, or cast from metal).<br><br>
Preferably, the wall member is generally trapezoidal in shape, tapering outwardly from a relatively narrower base, mounted at the flow-directing member, to a relatively wider remote free end.<br>
Preferably, the wall member remote end is an edge adapted for close (and thereby comfortable) positioning at the user's perineum. Preferably the edge is a curved and rounded, and also has a curvature along its length that is adapted for close positioning at the perineum.<br>
Preferably the wall member is relatively stiff or inflexible.<br>
Preferably the device is adapted for use with a conventional low down suit within a toilet facility.<br>
Preferably the flow directing member is connected via, a fluid conveying rod to a handle. In this regard, the handle typically comprises a separate component in the device, however can also be defined by a part of the conveying rod itself. Preferably the rod is also relatively inflexible such that, in conjunction with the handle, it can be used to position the wall member at the user's perineum.<br>
Preferably the flow directing member is defined by or at a remote end of the fluid conveying rod away from the handle. Also, the rod can be bent intermediate its ends, to aid angled positioning of the wall member adjacent to the anus.<br>
As an alternative, the wall member can be mounted at the rod remote end either directly or via a collar which is slidable along and selectively fastenable at the rod remote end.<br>
Preferably the handle incorporates a means for controlling a supply of typically pressurized liquid from a flexible conduit attached to an inlet to the<br><br>
handle. Preferably the controlling means is a manually operated, easily opened, but normally biased-shut piston valve.<br>
Preferably, the valve is configured such that differential forces from pressurised liquid within the handle, typically resulting from a pressurized liquid supply control tap being opened, keeps the valve normally shut.<br>
Preferably the piston valve is opened with a force applied against a spring-return lever fitted into the handle. Preferably the lever pivots about a fulcrum point and, in so doing, an opposing end of the lever, which typically has toggle forked legs which typically has toggle forked legs which straddle the piston valve, transfers such force, and the piston valve is then moved to an open position.<br>
Preferably the volume of flow through the device is reduced by restricted passages within the piston valve. Preferably a body of the handle is through-bored, and in which bore the piston valve is arranged, the piston valve having a bore extending partway therethrough, the piston valve interacting with the handle such that, in a closed position, the piston valve closes the through-bore of the handle, and in an open position liquid flows through the handle via the bore of the piston valve, and thence out of the device. Thus, when the piston valve is open, liquid is supplied to the flow directing member, (eg. via the fluid conveying rod) and thence to the fluid outlet where it typically discharges as a jet or jets to the anus.<br>
The device can be operated externally to the toilet bowl by depressing the lever within the handle, and the handle can be fixed at any rotational position to suit the user. In this regard, the handle can be assembled at any degree of angular rotation in relation to the anal cleaning head, as required by incapacitated people.<br><br>
The anal cleaning device can include a fail-safe mechanism such that a small force only is required for the operation of the device, to ensure that the liquid supply is easily stopped.<br>
The wall member is preferably sized and configured to prevent an end of the flow directing member from accidentally being directly inserted into any aperture of the body.<br>
Preferably the cleaning device can be stored in a sanitary position outside the toilet bowl within easy reach of the user, preferably within the confines of a container in which is held a quantity of disinfectant solution for washing the cleaning head of the device, In this regard, preferably the hygienic storage container is either wall or floor mounted. The storage container preferably incorporates a sump of disinfectant solution so that the anal cleaning head can be dunked, before the device is located in a holding bracket to drip-dry for the next user. However, as stated above, the cleaning head and conveying rod can be easily disconnected for storage.<br>
The cleaning head and fluid conveying rod may also be detached from the handle and, if necessary, washed over the low down suite bowl with the water spray from the handle, and then stored out of sight. This also allows for the use of various cleaning heads, and may be a preferred aesthetic feature for the user of the device.<br>
The device can be economically viably manufactured a personal hygienic device which is inexpensive to purchase and fit to a toilet suite and which, with modern production techniques, can be made light weight (eg. mainly or entirely of plastics) and readily accessible for disabled people.<br><br>
Advantageously, the device can be operated with one hand, thus allowing handicapped and disabled people usage thereof. The device can also reduce the use of toilet paper.<br>
The pressurised liquid supplied to the device is preferably via a conveniently positioned wall mounted tap, preferably lever operated. For simplicity, and because domestic water pressure varies from one location to another, this tap can be opened to give approximately the liquid pressure desired by the user. Users can thereafter become familiar with their requirements.<br>
Alternatively an installation can be provided that incorporates a pressure control valve and mixing device utilizing eg. hot and cold water.<br>
The fluid conveying rod can be made from aUuminium for lightness or stainless steel if a more durable product is required. Preferably the whole device is lightweight.<br>
Preferably the fluid conveying rod is of sufficient length to enable the device to be operated external to the toilet bowl, however may be shortened, eg. for users who prefer a shorter offset rod version. Typically the end of the conveying rod is an open tube for insertion into the cleaning head. Preferably the cleaning head has at least one fluid oudet in the form of an orifice which comes into communication with the liquid supply when the hand operated valve in the handle is opened.<br>
Also, interchangeable cleaning heads having varying configurations of liquid jets can be provided, thus offering a user a choice of different cleaning actions, as may be required.<br>
Preferably the wall member is located adjacent to the fluid outlet. Preferably the wall member is generally perpendicular to an axis of the fluid conveying rod. As stated above, the wall member may be separately affixed to the rod.<br><br>
The direction of the ensuing liquid jet exiting the fluid oudet through the device or is angled slighdy rearward of perpendicular.<br>
Furthermore preferably all corners and edges of the device are preferably rounded so to prevent bodily damage.<br>
Preferably the fluid conveying rod is a hollow circular-sectioned tube, but can be of any shape as may be desired.<br>
Preferably the fluid oudet (eg. orifice) is circular without limiting the use of other jet shapes which might be used.<br>
Also, in certain installations it may be considered advantageous to have heated liquid supplied from a modern state of the art mixing device at a constant preset temperature and/or pressure.<br>
Thus, in accordance with the present invention the wall member maintains a definite distance between the oudet and the surface of the anus. The device therefore prevents damage which could otherwise be caused if the spray jet were to be accidentally positioned to close or inserted into the anus, which is a possibility with many prior art devices.<br>
Thus this invention is for an anal cleaning device comprising of a fluid flow directing member connectable to a fluid source and having a fluid oudet for directing fluid from the source out of the member; and a wall member projecting out from the flow directing member near the fluid oudet and positionable at a perineum of a user such that, when located thereat, the wall member spaces the fluid oudet from the user's anus and tends to prevent fluid from reaching that side of the wall member opposite to the fluid oudet side of the wall member.<br><br>

Referring firstly to Figures 1 to 9, where like reference numerals represent similar or like parts, Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a first preferred anal cleaning device 1 in accordance with the present invention. The device 1 includes a handle 13 having various parts as shown in Figures 5 to 8. A Flexible supply tube 14 is connected to the handle and pressurized water is supplied thereto, typically from a wall mounted tap, preferably of the lever operated type.<br>
The device includes a fluid conveying rod in the form of a hollow cylindrical bent tube 12 (bent at 12b) with the length and bent being sufficient to allow for easy positioning of the device eg. with one's forearm resting on one's thigh.<br>
The device also includes a cleaning head 2 having a partly hollow (Figure 3) cleaning head body 10. A wall member in the form of flange 11 projects generally orthogonally from the body 10. The flange 11 is typically integrally formed (eg. moulded or machined) with body 10, although it may be fitted separately to the device (eg. by sliding a collar lie (Figure 12) over the end of tube 12). A single orifice 10a is formed in the cleaning head body 10, however, multiple orifices may be employed as appropriate. The cleaning head<br><br>
is further detailed in Figures 2, 3, 4.<br>
Figure 2 shows an end view of the cleaning head at its connection end (ie. Where it connects to tube 12). In this regard, the tube 12 is inserted snugly into a tubular recess 10b of body 10 (Figure 3) which in turn opens onto a narrower recess 10c, defining a shoulder lOd against which an end of tube 12 can abut (eg. sealingly via an o-ring (not shown). Thus the head 2 can be permanently or releasable attached to the end of tube 12 via any suitable means including adhesive, welding, grub screw(s), screw threading, bayonet fitting, ball detent, interference, friction or snap -fitting etc.<br>
The flange 11 is plate-like and generally trapezoidal in shape, having a rounded fee end lip 11a and curved ends lib. Lip 11a functions as a positioning bar and accordingly is circular in cross section and rounded on the ends of the arc as shown, to be optimally shaped to sit generally flush against a user's perineum.<br>
The orifice 10a is typically an upwardly directed jet, such that water which issues forth from the orifice 10a is directed parallel to and in-line with a centre line of the flange 11 (ie. In-line with the centre of the lip 11a). Alternatively the orifice can be defined such that exiting water is directed to issue back towards flange 11 (ie as an angled stream). The cleaning head and flange can be manufactured from stainless steel components, as a single piece polished investment casting, as cast porcelain or other ceramic , or preferably injection moulded from plastic material.<br>
Figure 4 shows a perspective view of the tube 12 and cleaning head 2. In this embodiment the flange and orifice are moulded integrally to form a unitary cleaning head. The tube 12 is then fastened into the cleaning head.<br><br>
Figure 5 shows a cross-sectional detailed view of the handle 13, including a fragmentary sectional view of a piston valve 18 and operating trigger lever 17.<br>
Figure 6 shows a side view of the piston valve body 18 and Figure 7 shows a side view of the operating lever 17 and a biasing lever spring 24 as a singular moulded piece. Figure 8 shows an end view of the operating lever showing the forked toggle 25 which straddles the piston valve 18.<br>
When assembled fulcrum bearings 17a of lever 17 fit into place on fulcrum pins moulded into the valve body recess for the operating lever. The handle is configured such that a light force is required to depress trigger lever 17. When so depressed the lever pivots on fulcrum bearings 17a, moving against biasing lever spring 24, the end of which slides in recess 28. In so pivoting the toggle legs 25, which straddle the piston valve body 18 at recess 26, urge the piston valve towards the handle inlet end I (so marked).<br>
Valve body 18 is positioned to slide in this passage. A liquid flow passage 13a extends right through handle 13. Valve body 18 has a longitudinal bore 29 extending almost completely therethrough, inwardly from its end adjacent inlet end I. A laterally extending passage 30 connects to bore 29 and opens onto an adjacent part of passage 13a. The valve body 18 has a closed opposite plug end 31, having an adjacent annular recess 32 into which a flexible sealing ring (eg. O-ring) can be located.<br>
In a normal orientation of the handle, the plug end 31 closes part of passage 13a (ie. The restricted part at shoulder 33) to prevent liquid flow therethrough. Thus, liquid leaving passage 30 is stagnant in the adjacent part of passage 13a so that the device is closed to fluid flow. However, when the lever 17 is depressed it urges the valve body towards inlet I. The plug end 31 opens the<br><br>
passage adjacent to shoulder 33, thus bringing the inlet I into fluid communication with tube 12, so that liquid can flow through the device, flowing through the valve body.<br>
When lever 17 is released, water pressure moves piston 18 back and/or the spring 24 pivots the lever 17 back away from handle 13, thus returning the valve body 18 to its position in Figure 5, and returning plug end 31 into a sealing configuration. In this regard, spring 24 is typically a leaf spring which assists to close the piston valve when the liquid pressure is insufficient to piston valve when the liquid pressure is insufficient to close the piston valve by differential pressure, the leaf spring acting as a fail-safe mechanism. This again closes passage 13a to liquid flow therethrough.<br>
The handle 13 has an externally threaded male connection 27 at the inlet end, which is compatible with and attachable to a flexible plumbing pressure hose (see Figure 1).<br>
The handle 13 is internally finished to accommodate the ready sliding of piston valve body 18 therein, Valve body 18 also has either two or four O-rings 19 fitted at 19a and 19b (ie. On either side of toggle legs 25) to prevent liquid flow around its outside, thereby preventing loss of liquid through the operating lever aperture. The sealing ring at plug end 31 prevents flow in the closed position.<br>
Tube 12 is a sliding fit in the recess provided in handle 13. To connect tube 12 to handle 13, a nut 22 having a conical female internal face 23 is tightened against a mating conical male thin-walled section 34 in handle 13. The internal face of the thin-walled conical section 34 is a close fit on the tube 12. When tightened the conical sections provide a clamping effect on tube 12. Screwed nut 22 has recessed grip sections 21 on its outer periphery and is a sliding fit on<br><br>
tube 12 in. This arrangement thus supports the tube 12 in, and affixes it to, the handle 13, but also allows it to be released therefrom for cleaning, servicing, interchange or replacement.<br>
Fig.9 shows a cross sectional view of a container 15 for the storage of the device between uses. The cross sectional shape of the container base 15a can be circular, square, rectangular or any other shape which fits the confines of a toilet area, in which the device is used. Disinfectant solution 16 is located in the receptacle defined by base 15a, and into which the cleaning head 2 can be immersed and agitated for cleaning/ disinfecting. A lateral bracket 15b supports the device above solution 16 so that it can drip dry prior to its next use.<br>
Referring now to Figures 10 to 17, where like reference numerals are used to denote similar or like parts, alternative anal cleaning devices are depicted.<br>
The handle 13 is essentially the same as the first embodiment except that leaf spring 24 is replaced by a helical spring captured within lever 17.<br>
In Figure 10 the cleaning head 2 is again fitted onto the end of tube 12 as shown, with the flange 11 again extending out from body 10. However, in Figures 11 to 13 the tube 12 is closed at tube end 12a, with the orifice 10a being defined (eg. formed or drilled) into tube end 12a. Thus, in this the body 10 is defined by tube end 12a. Also, in this embodiment flange 11 extends from a collar lie which is slid on to the tube end 12a and then fastened thereto adjacent orifice 10a(eg. via welding, adhesive, grub screw, screw thread etc). Thus, the tube 12 can be detached from the handle 13 as described above, and the flange 11 can also be detached from the tube 12, for cleaning, servicing, interchange, replacement etc.<br><br>
Also, the flange 11 of the Figures 10 to 13 is thinner in profile than flange 11 of the first embodiment. In other respects the cleaning devices are similar or the same.<br>
The tube 12 can be interchanged as described above so that shorter or longer, bent or straight tubes can be employed as appropriate. In addition, different flange sizes can be employed for different users.   Also heads having multiple orifices can be employed.<br>
The supply tube 14 can be connected to a toilet water supply and to a pressure regulator as appropriate. Alternatively it may be connected to a hot/cold water mixer for delivering cleaning water of appropriate temperature. It may also be able to be selectively connected to an air supply eg. from central healing, for anal drying after washing.<br>
Typically many of the components are formed from injection moulded plastics or corrosion-resistant metals such as aluminium and stainless steel.<br>
Whilst the invention has been described with reference to a number of preferred embodiments, it will be appreciated that it can be embodied in many other forms.<br>
