The composition is made up to 100 % with tap water or deionised water. The procedure is purely physical. No chemical reaction takes place between the individual components.<br>
Cleaning and disinfecting formulations according to the present invention may further comprise thickening agents, sequestering agents, antioxidants, UV absorbers, dyes, perfumes, buffer compounds, vitamins, moisturizers, body care substances, solids like waxes etc..<br>
The formulations according to the invention exhibit strong bactericidal activity in two respects:<br>
-	rapid destruction of germs present.<br>
This can be demonstrated, for example, by a suspension test, e.g. according to test method EN 1276.<br>
-	long-term bactericidal activity on the treated surface, as a result of which recolonisation is<br>
prevented effectively.<br>
This can be demonstrated, for example, by the AATCC 100-1993 method.<br>
They are therefore suitable for disinfecting and cleaning human skin and hands, hard articles and textile fibre materials and can be applied thereto in dilute or undiluted form, an amount of at least 2 ml, preferably in the undiluted form, being suitable for disinfection of the hands.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are very especially used in washing and cleaning formulations, for example in household washing formulations, powder washing formulations, washing pastes, fabric softeners, solid soaps, dishwashing formulations, all-purpose cleaners, especially in liquid washing formulations for textile fibre materials.<br><br>
The invention accordingly relates also to a method for the antimicrobial treatment of textile fibre materials in washing liquor, which method comprises treating the textile fibre materials in the washing liquor with a composition comprising<br>
(a)	a microbicidal active ingredient of<br>
(a,) from 0 to 5 % by weight of a diphenyl ether compound and (a^) from 0.1 to 5 % by weight of a phenol derivative,<br>
(b)	from 0 to 50 % by weight of one or more hydrotropic agents,<br>
(c)	from 5 to 80 % by weight of one or more synthetic detergents or of a soap or of combinations of the mentioned substances and/or of a salt of a saturated and/or unsaturated C^-Cj/atty acid,<br>

(e)	from 0 to 50 % by weight of typical ingredients for cleaning and disinfectant compositions and optionally<br>
(f)	tap water or deionised water ad 100 %,<br>
In the method according to the invention preference is given to a washing liquor that is free of diphenyl ether compounds, that is to say contains no component (a,).<br>
The invention relates also to a method for imparting antimicrobial properties to textile fibre materials, which method comprises treating the textile fibre materials in the washing liquor with a composition comprising<br>
(a)	from 0.01 to 10 % by weight of a mixture of a microbicidal active ingredient of<br>
(a,) a diphenyl ether compound and<br>
(a^) a phenol derivative,<br>
(b)	from 0 to 50 % by weight of one or more hydrotropic agents,<br>
(c)	from 5 to 80 % by weight of one or more synthetic detergents or of a soap or of<br>
combinations of the mentioned substances and/or of a salt of a saturated and/or<br>
unsaturated Cg-Cj^ fatty acid,<br>
(g)	from 0 to 50 % by weight of an alcohol,<br>
(h)       from 0 to 50 % by weight of typical ingredients for cleaning and disinfectant compositions and optionally and optionally<br><br>
(i)        tap water or deionised water ad 100 %,<br>
at least a fraction of the antimicrobial active ingredient remaining on the textile fibre<br>
material.<br>
The textile materials that.can be treated in accordance with the invention are undyed or dyed or printed, natural or synthetic fibre materials, for example of silk, wool, polyamide or polyurethanes, and especially cellulosic fibre materials of all kinds. Such fibre materials are, for example, natural cellulose fibres, such as cotton, linen, jute and hemp, as well as cellulose and regenerated cellulose. Preferred suitable textile fibre materials are of cotton.<br>
Using the composition according to the invention it is possible to destroy bacteria present on the washing material in the dilute liquor during the washing procedure. At the same time, antimicrobial properties are imparted to the washed textile material, that is to say bacteria that get on the textile material while it is being worn are destroyed.<br>
The following Examples illustrate the invention. Percentages and parts are percentages by weight and parts by weight, respectively.<br><br><br>
Example 2: Determination of the bactericidal efficacy of formulations (1) to (5) in accordance with EN 1276 (concentration 80 %. contact time 5 minutes) in log reduction<br>
Test principle:<br>
1.0 ml of a bacterial suspension is added to 8.0 ml of the formulation in question (the test concentration is multiplied by a factor of 1.25) and to 1.0 ml of a suspension of 0.3 % (factor 10) bovine albumin and mixed vigorously. After the contact time (see above) at 21 °C (+/-1 °C), a 0.1 ml sample is removed and added to 50 ml of TSB + inactivator (= test neutralisation mixture, 10°). 500 |il of the neutralisation mixture are added to 9 ml of TSB + inactivator to give a 10'^ dilution. Each test neutralisation mixture and the dilutions are filtered over a membrane and washed with 150 ml of distilled water. The membranes are<br><br><br>
The results in Table 1 show that good bactericidal effects can be achieved on the textile material using the formulations according to the invention.<br>
Example 3: Determination of the bactericidal effects, during wear (from 0 to 24 hours), on textile material washed under standard conditions<br>
Textile material: cotton<br>
washing formulation:	2.3 g<br>
water:	300 ml<br>
liquor ratio:	1:10<br>
duration of treatment:	10 min<br>
temperature:	40°C<br><br>
Test principle:<br>
Round cotton textile patches which have been washed under standard conditions (2.3 g<br>
detergent in a 300 ml liquor; 30 g textile; washing period: 10 minutes at 40X) are placed in<br>
sterile Petri dishes (diameter: 55 mm).<br>
All the samples are then inoculated with 0.25 ml of a bacterial suspension (approx.<br>
- 10^ cfu/sample) and placed in a humidity chamber at 37°C.<br>
Directly after inoculation and after 8 and 24 hours at 37°C, the inoculated textile patches are placed in 50 ml of 0.07 molar phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, containing 1 % Tween 80 and 0.3 % lecithin) and shaken for 1 minute. After shaking, a dilution series in sterile distilled water, down to a concentration of 10"^ is prepared. 100 }xl samples of the undiluted solution and of the 10"' and 10*^ dilutions are applied to the plates using a spiralometer. After incubation, the surviving colonies are counted, calculated as cfu/sample and given in Table 2 herein below.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
