				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
AMINOCYCLOHEXANES AS DIPEPTDDYL PEPTIDASE-IV INHIBITORS FOR THE TREATMENT<br>
OR PREVENTION OF DIABETES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel substituted aminocyclohexanes which are inhibitors of the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme ("DPP-IV inhibitors") and which are useful in the treatment or prevention of diseases in which the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme is involved, such as diabetes and particularly Type 2 diabetes. The invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and the use of these compounds and compositions in the prevention or treatment of such diseases in which the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme is involved.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Diabetes refers to a disease process derived from multiple causative factors and characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose or hyperglycemia in the fasting state or after administration of glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test. Persistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia is associated with increased and premature morbidity and mortality. Often abnormal glucose homeostasis is associated both directly and indirectly with alterations of the lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein metabolism and other metabolic and hemodynamic disease. Therefore patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus are at especially increased risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications, including coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Therefore, therapeutical control of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism and hypertension are critically important in the clinical management and treatment of diabetes mellitus.<br>
There are two generally recognized forms of diabetes. In Type 1 diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), patients produce little or no insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose utilization. In Type 2 diabetes, or noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), patients often have plasma insulin levels that are the same or even elevated compared to nondiabetic subjects; however, these patients have developed a resistance to the insulin stimulating effect on glucose and lipid metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, which are muscle, liver and adipose tissues, and the plasma insulin levels, while elevated, are insufficient to overcome the pronounced insulin resistance.<br>
Insulin resistance is not primarily due to a diminished number of insulin receptors but to a post-insulin receptor binding defect that is not yet understood. This resistance to insulin responsiveness results in insufficient insulin activation of glucose uptake, oxidation and storage in muscle and inadequate insulin repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secretion in the liver.<br><br>
The available treatments for Type 2 diabetes, which have not changed substantially in many years, have recognized limitations. While physical exercise and reductions in dietary intake of calories will dramatically improve the diabetic condition, compliance with this treatment is very poor because of well-entrenched sedentary lifestyles and excess food consumption, especially of foods containing high amounts of saturated fat. Increasing the plasma level of insulin by administration of sulfonylureas (e.g. tolbutamide and glipizide) or meglitinide, which stimulate the pancreatic Dcells to secrete more insulin, and/or by injection of insulin when sulfonylureas or meglitinide become ineffective, can result in insulin concentrations high enough to stimulate the very insulin-resistant tissues. However, dangerously low levels of plasma glucose can result from administration of insulin or insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas or meglitinide), and an increased level of insulin resistance due to the even higher plasma insulin levels can occur. The biguanides increase insulin sensitivity resulting in some correction of hyperglycemia. However, the two biguanides, phenformin and metformin, can induce lactic acidosis and nausea/diarrhea. Metformin has fewer side effects than phenformin and is often prescribed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.<br>
The glitazones (i.e. 5-benzylthiazolidine-2,4-diones) are a more recently described class of compounds with potential for ameliorating many symptoms of Type 2 diabetes. These agents substantially increase insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver and adipose tissue in several animal models of Type 2 diabetes resulting in partial or complete correction of the elevated plasma levels of glucose without occurrence of hypoglycemia. The glitazones that are currently marketed are agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR), primarily the PPAR-gamma subtype. PPAR-gamma agonism is generally believed to be responsible for the improved insulin sensititization that is observed with the glitazones. Newer PPAR agonists that are being tested for treatment of Type n diabetes are agonists of the alpha, gamma or delta subtype, or a combination of these, and in many cases are chemically different from the glitazones (i.e., they are not thiazolidinediones). Serious side effects (e.g. liver toxicity) have occurred with some of the glitazones, such as troglitazone.<br>
Additional methods of treating the disease are still under investigation. New biochemical approaches that have been recently introduced or are still under development include treatment with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g. acarbose) and protein tyrosine phosphatase-lB (PTP-1B) inhibitors.<br>
Compounds that are inhibitors of the dipeptidyl peptidase-TV ("DPP-IV") enzyme are also under investigation as drugs that may be useful in the treatment of diabetes, and particularly Type 2 diabetes. See for example WO 97/40832, WO 98/19998, U.S. Patent No. 5,939,560, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 6: 1163-1166 (1996); and Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett.. 6: 2745-2748 (1996). The usefulness of DPP-TV inhibitors in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes is based on the fact that DPP-IV in vivo readily inactivates glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP). GLP-1 and GEP are<br><br>
incretins and are produced when food is consumed. The incretins stimulate production of insulin. Inhibition of DPP-IV leads to decreased inactivation of the incretins, and this in turn results in increased effectiveness of the incretins in stimulating production of insulin by the pancreas. DPP-FV inhibition therefore results in an increased level of serum insulin. Advantageously, since the incretins are produced by the body only when food is consumed, DPP-IV inhibition is not expected to increase the level of insulin at inappropriate times, such as between meals, which can lead to excessively low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Inhibition of DPP-IV is therefore expected to increase insulin without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia, which is a dangerous side effect associated with the use of insulin secretagogues.<br>
DPP-IV inhibitors also have other therapeutic utilities, as discussed herein. DPP-IV inhibitors have not been studied extensively to date, especially for utilities other than diabetes. New compounds are needed so that improved DPP-FV inhibitors can be found for the treatment of diabetes and potentially other diseases and conditions. The therapeutic potential of DPP-IV inhibitors for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes is discussed by DJ. Drucker in Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs. 12: 87-100 (2003) and by K. Augustyns, et al., in Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents. 13: 499-510 (2003).<br>

The compounds of the present invention contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus occur as racemates, racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures, and individual diastereomers. In particular the compounds of the present invention have an asymmetric center at the stereogenic carbon atoms marked with an * in formulae la, Ib, Ic, Id, le, and If. Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such<br><br>
asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this invention. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds.<br>
Some of the compounds described herein contain olefmic double bonds, and unless specified otherwise, are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.<br>
Some of the compounds described herein may exist as tautomers, which have different points of attachment of hydrogen accompanied by one or more double bond shifts. For example, a ketone and its enol form are keto-enol tautomers. The individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are encompassed with compounds of the present invention.<br>
Formula I shows the structure of the class of compounds without preferred<br>
stereochemistry. Formulae la and Ib show the preferred stereochemistry at the stereogenic carbon atoms to which are attached the NH2 and Ar groups on the cyclohexane ring. Formulae Ic, Id, le, and If show<br>
the preferred stereochemistry at the stereogenic carbon atoms to which are attached the NH2, Ar, and N(R4)-X-R3 groups on the cyclohexane ring.<br>
The independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the X-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration.<br>
If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art.<br>
Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by methods well known in the art.<br>

The utility of the compounds in accordance with the present invention as inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme activity may be demonstrated by methodology known in the art. Inhibition constants are determined as follows. A continuous fluorometric assay is employed with the substrate Gly-Pro-AMC, which is cleaved by DPP-TV to release the fluorescent AMC leaving group. The kinetic parameters that describe this reaction are as follows: Km = 50 fxM; kca, = 75 s'1; kcat/Km = 1.5 x 106 NT's"1.   A typical reaction contains approximately 50 pM enzyme, 50 uJVI Gly-Pro-AMC, and buffer (100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) in a total reaction volume of 100 uj. Liberation of AMC is monitored continuously in a 96-well plate fluorometer using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Under these conditions, approximately 0.8 |JM AMC is produced in 30 minutes at 25 degrees C. The enzyme used in these studies was soluble (transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic extension excluded) human protein produced in a baculovirus expression system (Bac-To-Bac, Gibco BRL). The kinetic constants for hydrolysis of Gly-Pro-AMC and GLP-1 were found to be in accord with literature values for the native enzyme. To measure the dissociation constants for compounds, solutions of inhibitor in DMSO were added to reactions containing enzyme and substrate (final DMSO concentration is 1%). All experiments were conducted at room temperature using the standard reaction conditions described above. To determine the dissociation constants (Kj), reaction rates were fit by non-linear regression to the Michaelis-Menton equation for competitive inhibition. The errors in reproducing the dissociation constants are typically less than two-fold.<br>
In particular, the compounds of the following examples had activity in inhibiting the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme in the aforementioned assays, generally with an IC5Q of less than about<br>
1 u,M. Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds in use as inhibitors the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme activity.<br>
Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme (DPP-PV) is a cell surface protein that has been implicated in a wide range of biological functions. It has a broad tissue distribution (intestine, kidney, liver, pancreas, placenta, thymus, spleen, epithelial cells, vascular endothelium, lymphoid and myeloid cells, serum), and distinct tissue and cell-type expression levels. DPP-IV is identical to the T cell activation marker CD26, and it can cleave a number of immunoregulatory, endocrine, and neurological peptides in vitro. This has suggested a potential role for this peptidase in a variety of disease processes in humans or other species.<br><br>
Accordingly, the subject compounds are useful in a method for the prevention or treatment of the following diseases, disorders and conditions.<br>
Type n Diabetes and Related Disorders: It is well established that the incretins GLP-1 and GIF are rapidly inactivated in vivo by DPP-IV. Studies with DPP-rV(~A)~deiicient mice and preliminary clinical trials indicate that DPP-IV inhibition increases the steady state concentrations of GLP-1 and GDP, resulting in improved glucose tolerance. By analogy to GLP-1 and GIP, it is likely that other glucagon family peptides involved in glucose regulation are also inactivated by DPP-IV (eg. PACAP).   Inactivation of these peptides by DPP-IV may also play a role in glucose homeostasis. The DPP-IV inhibitors of the present invention therefore have utility in the treatment of type n diabetes and in the treatment and prevention of the numerous conditions that often accompany Type n diabetes, including Syndrome X (also known as Metabolic Syndrome), reactive hypoglycemia, and diabetic dyslipidemia. Obesity, discussed below, is another condition that is often found with Type n diabetes that may respond to treatment with the compounds of this invention.<br>
The following diseases, disorders and conditions are related to Type 2 diabetes, and therefore may be treated, controlled or in some cases prevented, by treatment with the compounds of this invention: (1) hyperglycemia, (2) low glucose tolerance, (3) insulin resistance, (4) obesity, (5) lipid disorders, (6) dyslipidemia, (7) hyperlipidemia, (8) hypertriglyceridemia, (9) hypercholesterolemia, (10) low HDL levels, (11) high LDL levels, (12) atherosclerosis and its sequelae, (13) vascular restenosis, (14) irritable bowel syndrome, (15) inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, (16) other inflammatory conditions, (17) pancreatitis, (18) abdominal obesity, (19) neurodegenerative disease, (20) retinopathy, (21) nephropathy, (22) neuropathy, (23) Syndrome X, (24) ovarian hyperandrogenism (polycystic ovarian syndrome), and other disorders where insulin resistance is a component. In Syndrome X, also known as Metabolic Syndrome, obesity is thought to promote insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and increased cardiovascular risk. Therefore, DPP-IV inhibitors may also be useful to treat hypertension associated with this condition. Obesity. DPP-IV inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of obesity. This is based on the observed inhibitory effects on food intake and gastric emptying of GLP-1 and GLP-2. Exogenous administration of GLP-1 in humans significantly decreases food intake and slows gastric emptying (Am. J. Physiol.. 277: R910-R916 (1999)). ICV administration of GLP-1 in rats and mice also has profound effects on food intake (Nature Medicine, 2: 1254-1258 (1996)). This inhibition of feeding is not observed in GLP-1R("A) mice, indicating that these effects are mediated through brain GLP-1 receptors. By analogy to GLP-1, it is likely that GLP-2 is also regulated by DPP-IV. ICV administration of GLP-2 also inhibits food intake, analogous to the effects observed with GLP-1 (Nature Medicine, 6: 802-807 (2000)). In addition, studies with DPP-IV deficient mice suggest that these animals are resistant to diet-induced obesity and associated pathology (e.g. hyperinsulinonemia).<br><br>
Cardiovascular Disease: GLP-1 has been shown to be beneficial when administered to patients following acute myocardial infarction, leading to improved left ventricular function and reduced mortality after primary angioplasty (Circulation, 109: 962-965 (2004)). GLP-1 administration is also useful for the treatment of left ventricular systolic dysfunction in dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic induced left ventricular dysfunction, and thus may prove useful for the treatment of patients with heart failure (US2004/0097411). DPP-IV inhibitors are expected to show similar effects through their ability to stabilize endogenous GLP-1.<br>
Growth Hormone Deficiency: DPP-FV inhibition may be useful for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency, based on the hypothesis that growth-hormone releasing factor (GRF), a peptide that stimulates release of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary, is cleaved by the DPP-IV enzyme in vivo (WO 00/56297). The following data provide evidence that GRF is an endogenous substrate: (1) GRF is efficiently cleaved in vitro to generate the inactive product GRF[3-44] (DBA 1122: 147-153 (1992)); (2) GRF is rapidly degraded in plasma to GRF[3-44]; this is prevented by the DPP-IV inhibitor diprotin A; and (3) GRF[3-44] is found in the plasma of a human GRF transgenic pig (J. Clin. Invest.. 83: 1533-1540 (1989)). Thus DPP-IV inhibitors may be useful for the same spectrum of indications which have been considered for growth hormone secretagogues.<br>
Intestinal Injury: The potential for using DPP-IV inhibitors for the treatment of intestinal injury is suggested by the results of studies indicating that glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), a likely endogenous substrate for DPP-IV, may exhibit trophic effects on the intestinal epithelium (Regulatory Peptides. 90: 27-32 (2000)). Administration of GLP-2 results in increased small bowel mass in rodents and attenuates intestinal injury in rodent models of colitis and enteritis.<br>
Immunosuppression: DPP-IV inhibition may be useful for modulation of the immune response, based upon studies implicating the DPP-IV enzyme in T cell activation and in chemokine processing, and efficacy of DPP-IV inhibitors in in vivo models of disease. DPP-IV has been shown to be identical to CD26, a cell surface marker for activated immune cells. The expression of CD26 is regulated by the differentiation and activation status of immune cells. It is generally accepted that CD26 functions as a co-stimulatory molecule in in vitro models of T cell activation. A number of chemokines contain proline in the penultimate position, presumably to protect them from degradation by non-specific aminopeptidases. Many of these have been shown to be processed in vitro by DPP-IV. In several cases (RANTES, LD78-beta, MDC, eotaxin, SDF-lalpha), cleavage results in an altered activity in chemotaxis and signaling assays.   Receptor selectivity also appears to be modified in some cases (RANTES). Multiple N-terminally truncated forms of a number of chemokines have been identified in in vitro cell culture systems, including the predicted products of DPP-IV hydrolysis.<br>
DPP-IV inhibitors have been shown to be efficacious immunosuppressants in animal models of transplantation and arthritis. Prodipine (Pro-Pro-diphenyl-phosphonate), an irreversible<br><br>
inhibitor of DPP-IV, was shown to double cardiac allograft survival in rats from day 7 to day 14 (Transplantation, 63: 1495-1500 (1997)). DPP-IV inhibitors have been tested in collagen and alkyldiamine-induced arthritis in rats and showed a statistically significant attenuation of hind paw swelling in this model [Int. J. Immunopharmacologv. 19:15-24 (1997) and Immunopharmacology. 40: 21-26 (1998)]. DPP-IV is upregulated in a number of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Graves' disease, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Immunology Today. 20: 367-375 (1999)).<br>
HIV Infection: DPP-IV inhibition may be useful for the treatment or prevention of HTV infection or AIDS because a number of chemokines which inhibit HIV cell entry are potential substrates for DPP-IV (Immunology Today 20: 367-375 (1999)). In the case of SDF-lalpha, cleavage decreases antiviral activity (PNAS, 95: 6331-6 (1998)).   Thus, stabilization of SDF-lalpha through inhibition of DPP-IV would be expected to decrease HTV infectivity.<br>
Hematopoiesis: DPP-TV inhibition may be useful for the treatment or prevention of hematopiesis because DPP-IV may be involved in hem'atopoiesis. A DPP-IV inhibitor, Val-Boro-Pro, stimulated hematopoiesis in a mouse model of cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia (WO 99/56753). Neuronal Disorders: DPP-IV inhibition may be useful for the treatment or prevention of various neuronal or psychiatric disorders because a number of peptides implicated in a variety of neuronal processes are cleaved in vitro by DPP-IV. A DPP-IV inhibitor thus may have a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of neuronal disorders. Endomorphin-2, beta-casomorphin, and substance P have all been shown to be in vitro substrates for DPP-IV. In all cases, in vitro cleavage is highly efficient, with kcat/Kn, about 106 M'V1 or greater. In an electric shock jump test model of analgesia in rats, a DPP-IV inhibitor showed a significant effect that was independent of the presence of exogenous endomorphin-2 (Brain Research. 815: 278-286 (1999)). Neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects of DPP-IV inhibitors were also evidenced by the inhibitors' ability to protect motor neurons from excitotoxic cell death, to protect striatal innervation of dopaminergic neurons when administered concurrently with MPTP, and to promote recovery of striatal innervation density when given in a therapeutic manner following MPTP treatment [see Yong-Q. Wu, et al., "Neuroprotective Effects of Inhibitors of Dipeptidyl Peptidase-IV In Vitro and In Vivo," Int. Conf. On Dipeptidyl Aminopeptidases: Basic Science and Clinical Applications. September 26-29, 2002 (Berlin, Germany)].<br>
Anxiety: Rats naturally deficient in DPP-IV have an anxiolytic phenotype (WO 02/34243; Karl et al., Physiol. Behav. 2003). DPP-IV deficient mice also have an anxiolytic phenotype using the porsolt and light/dark models. Thus DPP-FV inhibitors may prove useful for treating anxiety and related disorders. Memory and Cognition: GLP-1 agonists are active in models of learning (passive avoidance, Moms water maze) and neuronal injury (kainate-induced neuronal apoptosis) as demonstrated by During et al.<br><br>
(Nature Med. 9: 1173-1179 (2003)) . The results suggest a physiological role for GLP-1 in learning and neuroprotection. Stabilization of GLP-1 by DPP-IV inhibitors are expected to show similar effects Mvocardial Infarction: GLP-1 has been shown to be beneficial when administered to patients following acute myocardial infarction (Circulation, 109: 962-965 (2004)). DPP-FV inhibitors are expected to show similar effects through their ability to stabilize endogenous GLP-1.<br>
Tumor Invasion and Metastasis: DPP-FV inhibition may be useful for the treatment or prevention of tumor invasion and metastasis because an increase or decrease in expression of several ectopeptidases including DPP-IV has been observed during the transformation of normal cells to a malignant phenotype (J. Exp. Med.. 190: 301-305 (1999)). Up- or down-regulation of these proteins appears to be tissue and cell-type specific. For example, increased CD26/DPP-IV expression has been observed on T cell lymphoma, T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, cell-derived thyroid carcinomas, basal cell carcinomas, and breast carcinomas. Thus, DPP-IV inhibitors may have utility in the treatment of such carcinomas. Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy: DPP-IV inhibition may be useful for the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy because increased DPP-IV activity was noted in prostate tissue from patients with BPH (Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem.. 30: 333-338 (1992)).<br>
Sperm motilitv/male contraception: DPP-IV inhibition may be useful for the altering sperm motility and for male contraception because in seminal fluid, prostatosomes, prostate derived organelles important for sperm motility, possess very high levels of DPP-IV activity (Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem.. 30: 333-338 (1992)).<br>
Gingivitis: DPP-IV inhibition may be useful for the treatment of gingivitis because DPP-IV activity was found in gingival crevicular fluid and in some studies correlated with periodontal disease severity (Arch. Oral Biol.. 37: 167-173(1992)).<br>
Osteoporosis: DPP-IV inhibition may be useful for the treatment or prevention of osteoporosis because GIF receptors are present in osteoblasts.<br>
Stem Cell Transplantation: Inhibition of DPP-FV on donor stem cells has been shown to lead to an enhancement of their bone marrow homing efficiency and engraftment, and an increase in survival in mice (Christopherson, et al., Science, 305:1000-1003 (2004)). Thus DPP-IV inhibitors may be useful in bone marrow transplantation.<br>

Such other drug(s) may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of Formula I. When a compound of Formula I is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such other drugs and the compound of Formula I is preferred. However, the combination therapy may also include therapies in which the compound of Formula I and one or more other drugs are administered on different overlapping schedules. It is also contemplated that when used in combination with one or more other active ingredients, the compounds of the present invention and the other active ingredients may be used in lower doses than when each is used singly.

When a compound of the present invention is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition containing such other drugs in addition to the compound of the present invention is preferred. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that also contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to a compound of the present invention.<br>
The weight ratio of the compound of the present invention to the second active ingredient may be varied and will depend upon the effective dose of each ingredient. Generally, an effective dose of each will be used. Thus, for example, when a compound of the present invention is combined with another agent, the weight ratio of the compound of the present invention to the other agent will generally range from about 1000:1 to about 1:1000, preferably about 200:1 to about 1:200. Combinations of a compound of the present invention and other active ingredients will generally also be within the aforementioned range, but in each case, an effective dose of each active ingredient should be used.<br><br>
In such combinations the compound of the present invention and other active agents may be administered separately or in conjunction. In addition, the administration of one element may be prior to, concurrent to, or subsequent to the administration of other agent(s).<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be administered by oral, parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, ICV, intracisternal injection or infusion, subcutaneous injection, or implant), by inhalation spray, nasal, vaginal, rectal, sublingual, or topical routes of administration and may be formulated, alone or together, in suitable dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles appropriate for each route of administration. In addition to the treatment of warm-blooded animals such as mice, rats, horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, cats, monkeys, etc., the compounds of the invention are effective for use in humans.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions for the administration of the compounds of this invention may conveniently be presented in dosage unit form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. In the pharmaceutical composition the active object compound is included in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect upon the process or condition of diseases. As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material<br><br>
such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the techniques described in the U.S. Patents 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release.<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxy- propylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides,<br><br>
for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents.<br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br>
For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compounds of the present invention are employed. (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouthwashes and gargles.)<br>
The pharmaceutical composition and method of the present invention may further comprise other therapeutically active compounds as noted herein which are usually applied in the treatment of the above mentioned pathological conditions.<br>
In the treatment or prevention of conditions which require inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-TV enzyme activity an appropriate dosage level will generally be about 0.01 to 500 mg per kg patient body weight per day which can be administered in single or multiple doses. Preferably, the dosage level will be about 0.1 to about 250 mg/kg per day; more preferably about 0.5 to about 100 mg/kg per day. A suitable dosage level may be about 0.01 to 250 mg/kg per day, about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg per day, or about 0.1 to 50 mg/kg per day. Within this range the dosage may be 0.05 to 0.5,0.5 to 5 or 5 to 50 mg/kg per day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0 to 1000 mg of the active ingredient, particularly 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0. 20.0, 25.0, 50.0, 75.0, 100.0, 150.0, 200.0, 250.0, 300.0, 400.0, 500.0, 600.0, 750.0, 800.0, 900.0, and 1000.0 mg of<br><br>
the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day, preferably once or twice per day.<br>
When treating or preventing diabetes mellitus and/or hyperglycemia or<br>
hypertriglyceridemia or other diseases for which compounds of the present invention are indicated, generally satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds of the present invention are administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg per kilogram of animal body weight, preferably given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day, or in sustained release form. For most large mammals, the total daily dosage is from about 1.0 mg to about 1000 mg, preferably from about 1 mg to about 50 mg. In the case of a 70 kg adult human, the total daily dose will generally be from about 7 mg to about 350 mg. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response.<br>
It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the host undergoing therapy.<br>
Synthetic methods for preparing the compounds of the present invention are illustrated in the following Schemes and Examples. Starting materials are commercially available or may be made according to procedures known in the art or as illustrated herein.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared from intermediates such as those of formula n and EII using standard reductive amination conditions followed by deprotection. The preparation of these intermediates is described in the following Schemes,<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
wherein AT, R.3 and R4 are as defined above, X is a bond, and P is a suitable nitrogen protecting group such as tert-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), and 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc).<br>

Compounds of formula n are known in the literature or may be conveniently prepared by a variety of methods familiar to those skilled in the art. One common route is illustrated in Scheme 1. Bromo or iodo substituted benzene 1 is treated with magnesium to form the corresponding Grignard reagent or lithiated with reagents such as n-butyllithium and then treated with cyclohexanone 2 to form the tertiary alcohol 3. Alcohol 3 is dehydrated, for example, by treatment with phosphorus oxychloride or by treatment with p-toluenesulfonic acid in toluene with azeotropic removal of water, to provide styrene 4. Reduction by treatment with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium on carbon yields the protected 4-aryl substituted cyclohexanone 5. Deprotection under acidic conditions gives the cyclohexanone 6, which is then converted to a silyl enol ether, such as triisopropylsilyl enol ether 7 using reagents and methods familiar to those skilled in the art. The enol ether 7 upon treatment with iodosobenzene and trimethylsilyl azide forms the azido cycohexene 8, which upon reduction to the amine with lithium aluminum hydride or other reducing agents known in the literature yields the amine 9, as a mixture of cis and trans isomers. Protection of the resulting amine, for example, as its BOC derivative by treatment with di-te/-/-butyl dicarbonate, gives 10. Treatment of 10 with a source of fluoride anion removes the silyl protecting group and gives Intermediate Ha.<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
An alternative method to prepare Intermediate n is shown in Scheme 2. The<br>
commercially available ketone 2 is treated with dimethyl carbonate to form the keto ester 11, which is then transformed to the enol Inflate 12 upon treatment with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride. Treatment of 12 with aryl boronic acid 13. gives the aryl cycohexene 14. Reduction of 14 is readily achieved with reagents such Mg in methanol to provide ester 15 as a mixture of cis and trans isomers. Conversion to the thermodynamically more stable trans isomer 16 is effected by treatment with a base such as sodium methoxide in solvent such as methanol. Hydrolysis of the ester with a base such as lithium hydroxide to form the acid _17 followed by Curtius rearrangement gives the amine 18, as its benzyl carbamate derivative. Deprotection of the ketal by treatment with acid such as p-toluenesulfonic acid in dioxane provides Intermediate lib.<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
An alternative approach to Intermediate n is shown in Scheme 3. A Diels-Alder reaction between styrene 19 and diene 20 provides cyclohexene 21. Deprotection gives intermediate n. Styrene .19 and diene 20 are commercially available, known in the literature, or prepared by a variety of methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
As illustrated in Scheme 4, the compounds of the present invention of formula I, wherein X is a bond, are made by reductive amination of ^Intermediate n in the presence of amine HI using reagents such as sodium cyanoborohydride or decaborane in solvents such as dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, or methanol to provide intermediate IV. The reaction is optionally conducted in the presence of a Lewis acid, such as titanium tetrachloride. The reaction may also be facilitated by adding an acid, such as acetic acid. In some cases, Intermediate HI may be a salt, such as a hydrochloride or<br>
trifluoroacetic acid salt, and in these cases it is convenient to add a base, generally N,N-diisopropylethylamine, to the reaction mixture. The protecting group is then removed with, for example, trifluoroacetic acid or methanolic hydrogen chloride in the case of Boc, to give the desired amine I. The product is purified, if necessary, by recrystallization, trituration, preparative thin layer chromatography, flash chromatography on silica gel, such as with a Biotage® apparatus, or HPLC. Compounds that are purified by HPLC may be isolated as the corresponding salt. Purification of intermediates is achieved in the same manner.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Compounds I of the present invention wherein X is not a bond may be prepared as described in Scheme 5. Intermediate He is treated with an agent such as an acyl chloride, sulfonyl chloride, carbamoyl chloride, alkyloxy or aryloxycarbonyl choride or an isocyante in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or /V,7V-diisopropylethylamine to give intermediate IV. Deprotection provides compounds of formula I.<br>
In some cases the product I or synthetic intermediates illustrated in the above schemes may be further modified, for example, by manipulation of substituents on Ar, R.3, or R^. These manipulations may include, but are not limited to, reduction, oxidation, alkylation, acylation, and hydrolysis reactions that are commonly known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In some cases the order of carrying out the foregoing reaction schemes may be varied to facilitate the reaction or to avoid unwanted reaction products. The following examples are provided so that the invention might be more fully understood. These examples are illustrative only and should not be construed as limiting the invention in any way.<br><br>
