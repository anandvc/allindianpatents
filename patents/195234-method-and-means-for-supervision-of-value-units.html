				<td>The invention relates to a method for supervising the functioning of semiconductor valve units and to a system for carrying out the method, a control unit and a control assembly for cooperation with said control unit.<br>
In a station for transmission between an alternating current system and a system for high-voltage direct current transmission (HVDC) a number of controllable rectifier units are provided, each of which, with regard to the high voltage, consisting of a large number of series-connected valve units comprising thyristors. Each valve unit receives a portion of the rated voltage and each has a semiconductor which is triggering and each is provided with a control unit (TCU). These control units operating at high voltage receive their control signals from a common control assembly at close to earth potential. Conventional light conductors are used for the signal transmission. Equally conventional is to allow these control units to emit so-called indication pulses by means of light conductors to the common control assembly. These signals are emitted in the form of a light pulse as soon as a voltage arises across the thyristor in its forward direction which exceeds a certain threshold value, e.g. 30 V. In this manner, it is possible to ensure that no trigger pulse is sent to the thyristor before a sufficient forward voltage has been attained in order to ensure quick and effective triggering and low power losses during the trigger cycle. In addition to the means for transforming incoming light pulses to electrical trigger signals, as well as to signal with light signals the attainment of a certain forward voltage level, the individual control units also comprise means for executing a voltage-controlled triggering in the event that the triggering in one of the series-connected semi  conductors  should  fail  (individual  overvoltage  protection)   and  are<br>
relatively complicated devices. Reference is made to Ekstrom: High Power Electronics HVDC and SVC (Stockholm 1989} for a general description of HVDC technology.<br>
It has also been shown to be desirable to reduce the maintenance time for an HVDC plant. According to known technology, maintenance requires that the plant be taken out of operation whilst one or more operators perform error searches by means of partially manual operations in order to determine whether everything is operating correctly or whether some component is suffering from a fault. If the operators discover that a fault is present in the HVDC plant, it then remains to determine which components in the system are the same of the faulty functioning <br>
It is previously known to register the absence of the said indication pulses, something which makes it possible to detect the existence of possibly faulty thyristore with regard to the fact that these are often short-circuited when functioning incorrectly. For this reason, no voltage in the forward direction arises and therefore an indication pulse is never sent from such a stricken valve unit.<br>
The indication pulses serve two different purposes. On the one hand they are used to prevent one of the semiconductors receiving an trigger signal before the voltage thereacross is sufficient, and on the other hand the absence of indication pulses from one of the control circuits is registered centrally, whereby it is possible to keep tabs on which of the semiconductors has broken down. The fact that a small number of the series-connected semiconductors have become permanently short circuited can be tolerated since the remainder have the ability to accept their portion of the total voltage to thereby permit an exchange only during maintenance work.<br>
in Swedish patent application no. 92025006 a method is described for fault detection by selecting a single control unit and subjecting the selected control unit to a -trigger signal without sending a trigger signal to other valve units. By means of thereafter detecting the moment in time for the appearance of an indication signal from the selected control unit as well as the moment in time for corresponding indication pulses from the other control units in the same rectifier unit, an incorrect functioning of the selected valve unit can be detected.<br>
The Known method does, nowever, require individual activation of each separate valve unit with an individual trigger order pulse FPx.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method which permits reduced maintenance time of an HVDC plant.<br>
Accordingly there is provided a method for supervising the functioning of valve units using a system comprising a central control unit (10) and a plurality of valve units, wherein each valve unit comprises a semiconductor valve (THY1 -THYN) and a control device (TCU) for controlling the semiconductor valve, the control device comprising a trigger order input for receiving a trigger order signal (FP), an indication output for emitting a first indication signal (IP), and a trigger signal output (100) for emitting a trigger signal to the semiconductor valve, wherein the method comprises the steps of: detecting a voltage (UT) across a semiconductor valve, generating a first indication signal (IP) in response to the detected voltage, generating a second indication signal (SSTP) in response to a detected forward voltage across the semiconductor valve; transferring the first indication signal     and     the     second     indication     signal     between     the     control<br>
device (TCU) and the central control unit (10) on the same transmission line; generating said first indication signal (IP) when the voltage (UT) across the semiconductor valve is a positive forward voltage (UT) exceeding a first threshold value (U1); generating, in the central control unit (10), a trigger order signal (CP, FP) when a first indication signal has been received; generating, in the control devices (TCU), a trigger signal upon detected receival of the trigger order signal (FP); and generating, in the control devices (TCU), the second indication signal (SSTP) when the forward voltage (UT) exceeds a second threshold value (U2), said second threshold value being higher than said first threshold value.<br>
Accordingly, there is also provided Apparatus for supervising the functioning of a plurality of valve units as claimed in claim 1, said apparatus comprising a central control unit (10), a plurality of valve units and a transmission line, in which each valve unit has: a semiconductor element (THY1-N), a control device for controlling the semiconductor element, a trigger order input for receiving a trigger order signal (FP), an indication output for emitting a first indication signal (IP) in response to a detected voltage across the semiconductor element; and a trigger signal output (100) for emitting a trigger signal to the semiconductor element, and wherein the control device comprises means (60, 120, 105, 110) for emitting a second indication signal (SSTP) in response to a detected forward voltage across the semiconductor element, the control device being connected to deliver the second indication signal (SSTP)and the first indication signal (IP) on the same transmission line; the indication output (111) emits the first indication signal (IP) when the semiconductor element in its forward voltage direction has achieved a first predetermined voltage threshold value; the central control unit (10) is adapted to deliver a trigger order signal (CP, FP) to said trigger order inputs when a first indication signal has been received; the valve units are adapted to generate a trigger signal on the trigger signal outputs upon detected receipt of a trigger order signal; and said means (60, 120, 105, 110) for emitting a second indication signal (SSTP) is adapted to emit the second indication signal (SSTP) when the semiconductor element in its forward voltage direction has attained a second predetermined voltage threshold value, said second threshold value being higher than said first threshold value.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a simplified method for supervising the functioning and fault detection of a plurality of valve units in an HVDC plant.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a method for supervising the functioning which can be applied during normal operation of the HVDC plant, as well as a system for performing the method.<br><br>
These objects are achieved by a method according to the invention. By means of this method, each control unit generates a signal combination of first and second indication signals which permits an automated fault diagnosis. These objects are also achieved by a system for performing the method according to the invention. These objects are alo achieved by an advantageuos control unit. This control unit attains the object of initiating voltage-controlled triggering^should the normal triggering have failed, as well as indicating copmponent malfunction, for the semiconductor valve as well as for other components. In addition, during voltage-controlled triggering, a second indication signal is emitted in order to inform the central control assembly that such triggering' has taken place.<br>
The control assembly for cooperation with the control unit has the advantage of being capable of automatically executing an operational check during normal operation. Further features ef the invention are described :.n the remaining claims.<br>
The invention will be described in greater detail below with reference to the attached drawings.<br>

A portion of a thyristor valve system with a number of series-connected thyrlstors THYl - THYN is shown in Fig. 1, though in which only two thyristors have been illustrated. Each thyristor cooperates with its own adjacent control unit TCU1 - TCUN at the thyristor's high voltage potential. These units must be at high voltage. In the control equipment at earth potential shown to the left of the dashed line there is a number of light pulse generators L, which, via light conductors, are connected to respective<br>
ones of the control units TCJ. All the light pulse generators can be activated simultaneously by a control pulse CP, whereby trigger pulses FP1 - FPN are sent to the control units of the thyristors, which provide electrical trigger pulses to cause the thyristors to conduct.<br>
The known art further comprises an individual pulse source ICP, which, via the bus Bl, can feed an trigger pulse to just one, totally randomly selectable, of the light sources L. In this manner, a selected thyristor can be individually triggered.<br>
Indication pulses IP are sent from the control units TCU in the form ot light pulses via second light conductors to respective receiving detectors D which generate electrical<br>
pulses.<br>
As is known in the art, an indication pulse is generated by a control unit TCUX to indicate that a sufficient forward voltage has been attained to enable the thyristor to be able to receive a trigger pulss FF. The triggering pulses which arrive at the detectors D are collected in a second bus B2 and studied, for example by means of a microcomputer which generates common control pulses CP or an individual control pulse ICP.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a monitoring system according ~o one embodiment of the invention. Each control unit TCU1 - TCUN can communicate with a central control assembly 10 via light conductors in a manner similar to the disclosed known art. Each control unit TCUX comprises means for generating a conventional indication pulse IP as well as means for generating a signal SSTP indicating that voltage-controlled triggering has taken place. Bo~h the signals are transmitted via light conductors to the central control assembly 1.0.<br>
The central control assembly 10 comprises a control means 20 which, in a Known manner, generates a trigger order pulse CP. The central electrical triggering order pulse CP is converted in-a known manner by electro-optical means L to optical triggering order signals FP1 - FPN to signal to the control units TCU1 - TCUN that the thyristors THY1 -THYN are to be made to conduct.<br>
The control assembly 10 further comprises an evaluation unit 30 to which the signals IP and SSTP are delivered. The electrical triggering order signal CP generated by the control means is delivered to the evaluation unit 30 on an input 40. The signals IP and SSTP, respectively, originating from the control units TCU are delivered on a signal bus input 42 to the evaluation unit 30.<br>
In terms of hardware and software, the units 20 and 30 which are described in this text can be integrated in a single arrangement, though they are described herein as separate units in order to simplify the understanding of the invention.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a principal block diagram of the relevant components in a control unit TCUX according to one embodiment of the invention, since these control units are relatively complete arrangements; only the most relevant components for the invention are described here in order to simplify the understanding of the invention and for toe sake of clarity.<br>
The control unit TCUX comprises means (not shown) to measure the forward voltage across respective thyristors THYX. A signal which indicates the measured forward voltage is applied to the lead 50 and is distributed to a number of criteria units 60, 70, SO and 90, respectively.<br>
Each criteria unit involves a stipulation which, together or in combination with-another stipulation, amst be met in order that an electrical triggering pulse can be fed out on an output 100 for delivery to the gate terminal of the thyristor THYC.<br>
The criteria unit 90 generates an output signal once sufficient forward voltage U1I    for example 30 V. is<br>
attained to allow triggering of the thyristor. This output signal is delivered to an input of an OR-gate 105, the output of which is connected to an electro-optical means l10 which can generate an optical indication pulse IP on an optical link output 11l. In this manner, the indication pulse IPX is generated when the stipulation in the criteria unit 90 is met. The control unit has an input 106 for receiving a trigger order pulse FP from the central contvol assembly 10.<br>
If for some reason the thyristor is not triggered when remaining thyristors have triggerred the forward voltage will attain a second threshold value U2 at which voltage-controlled triggering of the thyristor will be initiated. the criteria unit fin is arranged to generate a high output signal "1" when the second throshold value is attained, "he second threshold value can, for example, be a forward voltage of 7 kv.<br>
As is illustrated in Fig. 3, the output of the criteria unit 60 is connected to an OR-gate 112 which, In turn, when a high input signal is received, causes a trigger signal to be delivered to the output 110.<br>
The control unit according to the invention further comprises an AND-gate 120 with an input connected to the output of the criteria unit 60,  and a second input<br>
connected to the output loo for the trigger signal t0 the chyristor.<br>
The AND-gate 120 thus generates a high signal on its output when the output signal of the criteria unit 60 :1s high and a trigger signal is simultaneously delivered to the output 100. The high signal on the output of the AND-gate indicates that voltage-controlled triggering occurs. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, tne output signal of the AND-gate 112 is delivered to a second input of the OK~gate 105. In this manner, a light pulse SSTP is generated which indicates that voltage-centrolled triggering SST has occurred, the light pulse being generated cy the electro-optical means 110,<br>
According to the preferred embodiment, the signal pulse for SST is coded in the same manner as for the conventionn?. indication pulse IP.<br>
Identification of whether the signal IP/SSTP on the output from the means 110 signals an indication pulse or that voltage-controlled trigging has been attained is performed by the evaluation unit 3 0 in the central control assembly 10.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a principal block diagram of the evaluation unit 30 according to one embodiment of the invention. As has been described above, the evaluation unit receives not only a signal on the input 40 which indicates when a common triggering order signal CP is sent to the control units TCU, but also individual signals I1 - IN on the roultipole input 42 from each control unit TCU.<br>
The evaluation unit 30 comprises an RS flip-flop 150 for each control unit TCU1 - TCUN. Each IP/SST signal input is connected both to the set input of an RS flip-flop as well<br>
as to an input on an OR-gate 160. The OR-gate 160 thus has an input connected to each of the individual signal inputs on the bus input 42.<br>
The OR-gate 160 has an output which is connected to a time circuit 170, the output of which is connected to an inverting input 180 of an OR-gate 182. The OR-gate 182 has an output which is connected to an input 184 of an AND-gats 190. The output of the AND-gate 190 is connected to a second input 194 of the OR-gate 182. The output of the AND-gate 190 is further connected to an input of a time circuit 196, the output of which is connected to both an Inverting input 200 as well as to a non-inverting input 210 of a processor unit 220.<br>
This described processor unit 220 can, in reality, comprise a variety of processors with memory units and signal processing means, in order to simplify the understanding of the invention, it will, however, be described as one processor unit 22 0.<br>
The processor unit 220 furthermore has a bus input 230 for individual reading of the HS flip-flops 150 and a reset output 240 which is connected to the reset input of all RS flip-flops,<br>
The processor unit 220 additionally has an alarm output 242 and a bus connector 244 via which the processor can communicate with the control means 20. The signal input 40 of the evaluation unit 30 is connected to the input of a monostable flip-flop 230. The output of the monostable flip-flop 250 is connected to a non-inverting input 270 of the AND-gate 190.<br><br>
Figs. 5, 6 and 7 illustrate in a principal manner how the voltage UT. across the thyristor THY1 can appear and exemplify how the above-described system operates.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a normally operating triggering sequence. Positive voltage in the drawings signifies positive forward voltage across the thyristor THY, The forward voltage level U1 indicates the voltage at which an indication pulse shall be generated by the control unit TCU and the voltage level U2 indicates the voltage level at which the control unit TCU shall initiate voltage-controlled triggering and an SSTP signal. The voltage level U2 can for example, be in the order of 7000 V.<br>
Pig. 5B illustrates an indication pulse which is generated when the voltage UT exceeds the threshold value U1 The<br>
indication pulse is delivered from the output 111 of the control unit TCUl to the central control assembly 10 which, in dependence thereof, delivers a common triggering order pulse CP so that triggering order signals FBI - PBN are delivered to all control unite TCUl - TCVN.<br>
Pig. 5C illustrates the triggering pulse FP which is received on the input 106 of the control unit TCV. As is illustrated toy the dashed line which extends from the positive edge of the triggering pulse FP in Fig. 5C, the voltage UT decreases<br>
across the thyristor to 0 or approximately 0 as a result of the triggering of the thyristor. The forward voltage level across the thyristor thereafter remains at a alightly positive level just above 0 V as long as current flows through the thyristor. When the voltage across the rectifier unit eventually changes sign and/or when the current in the conducting direction of the thyristor ceases, the thyristor will be rearward biased as illustrated by a zero crossing 252 in Fig. 5A.<br>
Fig. 5D illustrates that no second indication signal SSTP arises when the control unit is functioning normally.<br>
Pig. 5E illustrates the signal IPS which is generated in the time circuit 170.<br>
Fig. 5F illustrates the signal KP which controls the operation of the processor unit 220 with readings of the memory units 150.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates the case when the thyristor does not trigg as a result of the trigging signal FP, but instead trigs due to voltage-controlled protection triggering. The control unit TCU thus generates an indication pulse IP and the control unit 10 generates a trigger signal FP as described above, though the voltage UT continues to increase because the thyristor has not triggered, when the positive forward voltage UT across the thyristor exceeds the threshold value U2 the control unit initiates voltage-controlled triggering and a signal SSTP is generated to indicate that voltage-controlled triggering has taken place. The signal SSTP is illustrated in Fig.6D.<br>
Fig, 7 illustrates the case in which the thyristor at the control unit TCO" in question is short-circuited- Since neither the threshold value U1 nor the threshold value U2<br>
is attained across the thyristor in question, neither will signals IP or SSTP be generated. However, the control unit TCU nevertheless receives a trigger signal FP since one or more of the remaining thyri store in the rectifier unit receive voltage and inform the control assembly 10 to generate the triggering signal FP.<br>
As will be apparent from the above description of the control unit TCU and the evaluation unit 30, the system<br>
according to the described embodiment is arranged to transmit the signals IP and SSTP on the same transmission line.<br>
When comparing Fig. SB with Pig. 6D, it will be apparent that the signals IF and SSTF can nevertheless be differentiated from each other since they arise at different instances in time.<br>
With reference to Fig. 4 and figs, 5-7, the evaluation unit 30 operates in the following manner.<br>
At the starting point, all RS flip-flops 150 are set to 0, When the voltage UT exceeds the threshold value U1, an indication signal IP is delivered from the control units CTU operating for this purpose.<br>
The signal IP sets corresponding RS flip-flop 150. The signals IP - IPN are also delivered to respective inputs of the OR-gate 160.<br>
Each indication signal IF has, in accordance with this embodiment, substantially one µs duration and since the individual IP signals arise with certain distribution, the output signal from the OR-gate will be a shower of pulses with the shower lasting for up to 300 µS.<br>
It lies within the scope of the invention that the indication pulses have a different duration such as somewhere within the interval 0,5 µs  to 10 µs.<br>
The output signal of the OR-gate 160 is delivered to the time circuit 170, the purpose of which being to generate a steady signal IPS depending on the inputted signal shower, which steady signal indicates that an indication pulse IP has arrived. The signal Ips  becomes high on the positive<br>
edge of the first indication signal IP and, according to the preferred embodiment, maintains the high signal level on the IPS for 192 µs after the negative edgs cf the output signal of the OR-gate. The signal IPS is thus high for a time interval T3 = 192 µs after the negative edge of the latest indication pulse IP. Some examples of this are illustrated in figs. 5E and 6£, respectively. This implies, as a result of the inverted input 180 of the OR-gate 132, that the AND-gate 180 is locked at a low output signal as long as IPS is high, with retriggerings, during a lead interval, the triggering order signal CP is generaced immediately in response to an indication signal IP and during these retriggerings the evaluation readings of the RS flip-flops ISO are not to be carried out. The signal CPS jnder such circumstances will become high as a result of said retriggeringj generating indication signals, and :he signal IPS remains high during the time T3 in order to lock the output signal KP of the AND-gate 19C at a lower level, In this manner the goal of performing the evaluation procedure only at the first triggering order in each lead interval for the valve units is attained.<br>
The control means 20 (Fig. 2) can, for example, be connected to the output of the OR-gate 160 via the bus 244 to detect that some IP has been received and the control means 20 depending thereon, delivers a trigger order signal CP. The first, and normally the only, triggering order signal CP during a lead interval is generated by the control assembly 20 with a certain delay once a first indication signal IP has been received- A number of other stipulations must first be met, and in practice the first trigging order signal CP is generated later than the time T3 after which an indication signal XP has been received. As mentioned above, it does however occur sometimes that a thyristor may extinguish during the lead interval, commences to receive voltage and generates a first indication signal IP. In such<br>
cases, the control assembly 10 shall immediately generate the triggering order signal, but not perform the evaluation routine. The triggering order sicrnal is received both on the input 106 of each control unit TCU (Fig. 3), as well a&amp; on the input 40 of the central evaluation unit 30 (Pier.4).<br>
The triggering order pulse cp is received on the input 40 and fed to the signal time means 250, where the means 250 has the function of a monostable flip-flop which becomes high during the time T2 = 100 µs  after receiving a positive edge<br>
of the signal CP. As is illustrated in Fig. 5P, the means 196 generates a signal which becomes high after the delay T?i = 30 jus after the positive edge of the output signal of the monostable flip-flop 250.<br>
The time circuit 196 thus gives a delay of T1 = 3 0 µs before a high signal is delivered to the xnputs 310 and 200 of the processor unit. This implies that possikle incorrectly sent indication signals which can have been generated by the control units TCV in connection with the transients which arise at the triggering instance are not incorrectly interpreted as second indication signals SSTP.<br>
The above stated times T1, T2 and T3 are only examples according to a preferred embodiment of the invention. The time T1 can alternatively be chosen within the interval 0-7 0 µs. A plurality of combinations of the time intervals T1, T2, T3 are possible and these time intervals determine the size of a time window within which the processor unit 220 performs readings of the RS flip-flops 150.<br>
The AND-gate 190 thus generates in cooperation with the time circuit 196 during normal operation a control pulse KP, the positive edge of which arises at the time T1 <br>
3 0 MS after the positive edge of the triggering signal CP if the signal IPS is not high at that instance.<br>
A positive edge of the control pulse KP which is detected at the input 210 of the processor 220 initiates a first interruption routine (interrupt) to be performed by the processor. The processor 230 thus reads all the RS flip-flops 150 and stores the result in a first memory vector Ml with N positions (see Fig. 8}. A read high signal implies that the corresponding control unit TCU has sent a normal first indication pulse, whilst a read low signal implies that the corresponding control unit TCU has not sent an indication pulse. After reading the Q~outputs of the flip-flops 150, the processor 220 sends a reset signal to the output 240 so that the RS flip-flops 150 are set to zero in order to be in -a ready state co receive the second indication signal SSTP.<br>
The negative edge of the signal Kp arises at the time T2 after the positive edge of the triggering order signal CP.<br>
At the negative edge of the signal KP a second interruption routine is activated in the processor 220 as a result of detection at the input 200. in the second interruption routine, the RS flip-flops 150 are once again read via the databus which is connected to the input 230. A read high signal at this instance implies that the corresponding control unit TCU has generated a signal SSTP indicating voltage-controlled triggering The read signal bits are stored in a second memory vector M2 with N positions, i.e. as many positions as the number of RS flip-flops 150. in this manner, an individual condition code is generated for each valve unit.<br>
with reference to the table in Fig. B, for each position one of the following four combinations can have arisen:<br>
(Ml,	M2)	=	(1.0)<br>
(Ml,	M2)	=	(1,1)<br>
(Ml,	M2)	=	fo.0)<br>
(Ml,	M2)	=	10,1)<br>
In Fig. 8, position 1 illustrates the signal sequence which is shown in figs. 5A-5F, i.e. normal operation of the, valve unit which comprises the control unit TCUl and t1e thyristor THY1.<br>
Position 2 in Pig. 8 illustrates the signal combination F1/1) which arises when voltage-controlled triggering is indicated. The corresponding signal sequence is illustrated in figs. 6A-6F-<br>
Position 3 in Pig. 8 illustrates the signal combination (o,o) which arises when the thyristor is short-circuiteo. The corresponding signal sequence is illustrated in figs 7A-7F.<br>
Position 4 in Fig. 8 illustrates the signal combinaticn (0,1) which arises if the corresponding control unit has not sent a first indication pulse, but instead sent an indication of voltage-controlled triggering. This combination thus indicates that a fault is present in the control unit TCU4 in the fourth position and that the fault is in the criteria unit 90 or one of the components up to the electro-optical means 110.<br>
In order to filter out interference signals which can randomly arise, a number of time-consecutive measured results are stored and only if the same fault condition is detected at more than a predetermined quota of control instances for a certain valve position is an alarm signal generated. An alarm signal comprises the following information:<br>
Alarm condition: one of the above described signal combinations (1,1), (0,0) or (0,1),<br>
Valve position: whichever of the valve positions l ~ N m question.<br>
Time instance; the date and the moment in time that the alarm was generated.<br>
A convertor arrangement for art KVDC system according to the invention thus comprises a system for continuous supervision of the functioning of distributed system components. The system according to the invention performs the supervision by means of repeated application of a distributed first method F1 and a similarly repeated application of a centra; second method F2, The main aspects of the methods Fl and F2 are illustrated in Fig. 9A and 9B,<br>
The first method Fl, which is illustrated in Fig. 9A 19 carried out by each control unit TCU each time the corresponding thyristor THY receives a positive forward, voltage which exceeds the threshold value U1. When the.<br>
forward voltage UT exceeds the threshold value U, in accordance with the method a correctly functioning control unit will generate a first indication signal IP. That or those control units which suffer from a fault in corresponding components will not: generate a first indication signal.<br>
since the system comprises a large number of control units, one or more of the control units will, however, generate an indication signal. The central second method F2 in the central unit 10 commences once a number of triggering stipulations have been met. one of these stipulations is that an indication signal IP has been received.<br>
According to the method F2, see Fig. 9B, a trigger order signal CP, FP is, generated for delivery to both the central evaluation unit 30 and to each distributed control unit TCU.<br>
According to the method F2/ the memory units 150 (see Pig. 4) which have registered each received first indication signal IP from the control units are now read. The memory units 150 are thereafter set to zero in order to be prepared to register a possible second indication signal SSTP from one or mora of the control units. A waiting period commences after the zero-setting operation. A signal which is registered during the waiting period in any one of the memory units 130 will be interpreted as a second indication signal SSTP.<br>
In each control unit, the method Fl (see Fig. 9A) implies a wait to obtain a trigger order signal from the central control assembly 10. When waiting for the triggering order, si teat is continuously executed to determine whether the forward voltage UT across the thyristor exceeds the second<br>
threshold value l^.<br>
If the forward voltage UT exceeds the second threshold value U2 before a trigger order signal is detected, a second indication signal SSTP is generated at the same time that a locally initiated voltage-controlled triggering of the thyristor is initiated.<br>
if a trigger order signal FP is detected, a trigger signal to the thyristor is always generated.<br>
once this triggering signal has been generated, the method Fl implies a repetition from the starting position by waiting<br><br><br>
until the voltage UT exceeds the voltage threshold valua UT, as described above.<br>
According to the method F2, the memory units 150 are read after the waiting period and the received measurement series is delivered to an analysis means for analysis according to the above description- Thereafter, the method F2 is repeated from its start position by waiting for a first indication signal.<br><br><br><br><br>
