				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>A novel method for increasing the supply ranges of packet oriented transferring radio stations which are located outside the range of a central base station and are supplied by wireless base stations (relay stations). In contrast to conventional wireless transfer systems, a communication service quality is guaranteed. The invention uses a common time-interconnected capacity assignment method. Said capacity assignment is generated by an AP for stations (MT, FMT) which can be reached directly by a base station (AP). Individual MTs are present in the form of wireless base stations and serve as relay stations (FMTs) with regard to the MTs outside the range of an AP. For an AP, FMTs appear as MTs. The FMT forms a partial frame structure in a part of the AP distribution capacity transfer system which is embedded in the time frame structure dictated by the commanding central station.</td>

Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a piperidine derivative and a process for preparing the same.  More particularly, the present invention relates to a piperidine derivative useful as an intermediate for pharmaceuticals such as paroxetine and the like which are useful, for example, as an antidepressant.<br>
Discussion of the Related Art<br>
In general, paroxetine useful as an antidepressant is prepared by the processes described, for example, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 7-138228 and Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 59-46216.<br>
However, these processes have the drawback that, upon deprotection of N-methyl group, complicated procedures such as hydrolysis after the transformation of N-methyl group to carbamate group are required.<br>
In addition, there is disclosed a process for preparing paroxetine using an amidomalonic acid ester derivative as a starting material in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 7-138228.<br><br>
However, the amidomalonic acid ester derivative is not in general commercially available.  Therefore, there necessitates troublesome procedures such that the amidomalonic acid ester derivative should be previously prepared before using.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a compound useful as an intermediate for preparing paroxetine and a process for simply and industrially preparing the compound.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the following description.<br>

It is desired that the amount of hydrogen chloride to react on {3S,4R)-trans-l-tert-butoxycarbonyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-[(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)oxymethyl]-piperidine is usually 1 to 5 moles per 1 mole of (3S^4R)-trans-l-tert-butoxycarbonyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-[(3,4-methylenedioxypheny1)oxymethyl]piperidine.<br>

The temperature when hydrogen chloride is reacted thereon varies depending upon the amount of hydrogen chloride used and is usually within a range of ordinary temperature to the boiling point of isopropanol when the amount of hydrogen chloride is within a range of 1 to 2 mole per 1 mole of the (3S,4R)-trans-l-tert-butoxycarbonyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-[(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl )oxymethyl ] piperidine.<br>
Vfhen the hydrogen chloride is reacted thereon, (3S,4R)-trans-l-tert-butoxycarbonyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-[ (3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl) oxymethyl ] piperidine hydrochloride is formed, at the same time that the tert-butoxycarbonyl group is deprotected.<br>

Usually, isopropanol is incorporated in a content of<br><br>
8 to 15% by weight in the thus obtained crystals of (3S,4R)-trans-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-[(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)oxymethyl]piperidine hydrochloride.<br>
The crystals of the (3S^4R)-trans-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-C(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)oxymethyl]piperidine hydrochloride are dried, for example, at 80* to 110*'C under reduced pressure to convert the crystals from those having the maximum endothermic peak at a temperature range of 98- to 110°C to those having the maximum endothermic peak at a temperature range of 118** to 132°C as measured by DSC (differential scanning calorimetry).  The reason why the heating temperature is adjusted to not lower than 80°C is to rapidly dry isopropanol.  The reason why the heating temperature is adjusted to not higher than 110°C is to avoid melting of the crystals.<br>
The crystals thus converted are composed of anhydrous (3S,4R)-trans-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-[(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)oxymethyl]piperidine hydrochloride having an isopropanol content of 0.1 to 5% by weight.<br>
The anhydrous hydrochloride is a compound useful as an antidepressant.<br>

methylpiperidine (hereinafter referred to as -Known Compound A-), which was prepared according to the method disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 7-138228 was added to and dissolved in the above mixture. After the mixture was cooled to a temperature of -20°C, a mixed solution prepared by dissolving 0.52 g of ethyl chloroformate in about 5 ml of toluene was added dropwise thereto.  The temperature of the resulting mixture was gradually raised to room temperature, and then allowed to stand at room temperature for about two hours. Thereafter^ about 10 ml of water was added to the above mixture, and then the mixture was made alkaline by adding aqueous sodium hydroxide solution.  The alkaline mixture was allowed to stand to separate into a toluene layer and an aqueous layer, and the aqueous layer was removed.  The toluene layer was concentrated by using a rotary evaporator, and the remaining concentrate (hereinafter referred to as -Derivative B-) was obtained as an oily product.  Further, about 5 ml of toluene was again added to Derivative B, and 1 g of ethyl chloroformate 'was added to the above mixture at room temperature.  Thereafter, the resulting mixture was allowed to stand overnight. Subsequently, diluted aqueous hydrochloric acid was added thereto, and the toluene solution was separated therefrom as the neutral part.  The separated toluene solution was<br><br>

Example 25  [Preparation of (-)-(3S,4R)-4-(4-fluorophenvl )-3-[(3,4-methvlenedloxvphenvl)-oxymethvllpiperidine hydrochloride!<br>
A 100 ml four-necked glass flask equipped with a thermometer and a reflux condenser was charged with 75.7 ml of isopropanol and 9.15 g (21.30 mmol) of (3S,4R)-l-tert-butoxycarbonyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-[3,4-<br><br>
methylenedioxyphenyl)oxymethyl3plperidine, and the mixture was dissolved therein under nitrogen gas atmosphere. Thereafter, 9.70 g (53.21 mmol calculated as hydrochloric acid) of a 20%-isopropanol solution of hydrochloric acid was added dropwise to the above reaction mixture at a temperature of from 20° to 30°C, and stirred at a temperature of from 20° to 30*'C for one hour. Subsequently, the resulting mixture was heated to a reflux temperature.  After stirring the reaction mixture at the above reflux temperature for additional two hours, the reaction mixture was cooled, and then a small amount of seed crystals of (-)"(3S,4R)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-[(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl )oxymethyl] piperidine hydrochloride containing isopropanol was added thereto, to afford a crystalline product.  After sufficient crystallization, the reaction mixture was cooled to a temperature of from 0° to 5°C, and then the cooled mixture was kept at a temperature of from 0" to 5°C for one hour.  The resulting crystals were collected by filtration, and the crystals were sufficiently washed with isopropanol, to give white crystals, which were (-)"(3S,4R)-4"(4"-fluorophenyl)-3-[ (3, 4-methylenedioxyphenyl )oxymethyl]piperidine hydrochloride.  The resulting crystals were dried under a reduced pressure at 90°C, to give 6.17 g of a product. The yield was 79.17% based on (3S,4R)-l-tert-<br><br>
butoxycarbonyl-4- (4-f luorophenyl) -3- [(3^4-methylenedioxyphenyl )oxyrnethyl] piper idine •<br>
The above crystals contained isopropanol in an amount of 2.51% by weight.<br>
Experimental Example<br>
A four-necked glass flask was charged with 223.2 g (0.6777 mol) of (3S,4R)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-[(3,4-inethylenedioxyphenyl)oxymethyl 3 piper idine and 2150 ml of isopropanol, and 135-9 g (0.7454 mol) of a 20% isopropanol solution of HCl was added dropwise to the above mixture over a period of 10 minutes at a temperature of from 50* to 60°C.<br>
Next, 11.21' g of activated carbon was added to the mixture to decolorize and the mixture was stirred over a period of 15 minutes at a temperature of from 60° to 70°C. Thereafter, the resulting mixture was filtered to remove the activated carbon, and then washed with 225 ml of hot isopropanol of a temperature of from 70° to 80°C.  As a result, the solution could be substantially decolorized.<br>
The filtrate was cooled to a temperature of from 45* to 50°C, and then seed crystals were added thereto, to allow crystals to precipitate.  Thereafter, the slurry of crystals was kept for one hour at a temperature of from 0* to 5°C.  Subsequently, the crystals were collected by<br><br>
filtration, and then the obtained crystals were washed with 640 ml of cold isopropanol of a temperature of from about 0° to about 5°C.  The washed crystals were dried under a reduced pressure at 70°C, to give 209,4 g (0.5117 mol) of white paroxetine hydrochloride containing 10.6% of isopropanol.<br>
Further, 180.3 g (0.4406 mol) of the paroxetine hydrochloride was dried under a reduced pressure, to give 157.7 g (0.4216 mol) of white paroxetine hydrochloride containing 2.2% of isopropanol.<br>
With the paroxetine hydrochloride containing 10.6% of isopropanol, the profile between the drying temperature and the residual amount of isopropanol was examined.  The results are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
It can be seen from Table 1 that by the combinations of the drying temperatures ranging from 80° to llO°C and the drying time course of 168 hours, the residual amount of isopropanol can be controlled within a range of from 0.1 to 5%.<br>
As explained above, according to the present invention, a compound highly useful as an intermediate for the preparation of paroxetine can be advantageously prepared in a simple manner.<br>
Also, paroxetine hydrochlorides and anhydrous crystals can be prepared in a simple manner from the above compound.<br>
