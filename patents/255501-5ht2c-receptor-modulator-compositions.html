5HT2C RECEPTOR MODULATOR COMPOSITIONS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The present application seeks priority to provisional application with U.S.S.N. 60/561,037 filed on April 9, 2004, the entire application is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to devices and methods-for collection, storage and transportation of a liquid suspension of biological specimens containing analytes of interest in a dry state. The invention further provides methods for recovery of the biological specimens containing analytes of interest for subsequent research laboratory analysis and clinical trial testing.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Biological specimens are often collected, transported and stored for analysis of the levels and concentrations of various analytes contained therewithin. Conventionally, liquid suspensions of biological specimens are stored in sealed airtight tubes under refrigeration. Liquid sample collection, handling, transportation and storage has many problems associated with it, for example: the cost of refrigeration (typically by dry ice) in remote collection centers; the risk of container breakage or leakage which causes loss of sample and the danger of infection; sample instability during shipment and storage; refusal of transport carriers to accept liquid biohazard shipments; and collection of adequate sample volume to ensure quantities compatible with laboratory methods of subsequent analyses. The costs of addressing the above problems are substantial.<br>
Dried blood spot (DBS) and dried plasma spot (DPS) sampling on filter paper are alternative methods to the liquid sampling procedures, and have been used worldwide with some success. Since the 1980s, manufacturers such as Schleicher and Schuell Corp., Bio-Rad, Boehringer Mannheim Corp,, and Whatman, Inc., have been producing filter papers for DBS and DPS sampling. In using these commercially available biological sampling filter paper systems, a blood or plasma spot is placed in one or more designated areas of the filter paper, allowed to dry, and then mailed along with a test request form to the laboratory. Commonly used filter papers are known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as Whatman 3 MM, GF/CM30, GF/QA30, S&amp;S<br><br><br><br><br>
1<br><br>
WO 2005/102526	PCT/US2005/005392<br>
903, GB002, GB003, or GB004. Several categories of blotting materials for blood specimen collection ate available, e.g., S&amp;S 903 cellulose (wood or cotton derived) filter paper and Whatman glass fiber filter paper. However, certain disadvantages have been associated with these commercially available filter papers. Specifically, certain of these commercially available and commonly used materials lack characteristics which provide precision values and accuracy that are preferred for carrying out certain biological assays.<br>
Genetic material can be extracted and isolated from DBSs in sufficient quantities for use in genetic analysis. For instance, DBS has been used for the detection of prenatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Cassol, et al., J. Clin Microbiol 30 (12): 3039-42, 1992). DPS and DBS have also been used for HIV RNA detection and quantification (Cassol, et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 35: 2795-2801, 1997; Fiscus, et al., J. Clin. MicrobioL 36: 258-60, 1998; O'Shea, et al., AIDS 13: 630-1, 1999; Biggar, et al., J. Infec. Dis. 180 1838^3, 1999; Brambilla, et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 41(5): 1888-93, 2003); HIV DNA detection and quantification (Panteleefe, et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 37: 350-3, 1999; Nyambi, et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 32: 2858-60, 1994); and HIV antibody detection (Evengard, et al, AIDS 3: 591-5, 1989; Gwinn, et al, JAMA 265: 1704-08, 1991). HCV RNA detection and genotyping are also reported using DBS (Solmone et al, J. Clin. Microbio. 40 (9): 3512-14, 2002). Although these studies provide a good correlation with liters using DPS or DBS is obtained as compared with conventional liquid plasma samples, a loss of viral titers may occur after room temperature storage (Cassol, et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 35: 2795-2801, 1997; Fiscus, et al., X Clin. Microbiol. 36: 258-60, 1998). DBS and DPS samples are clearly less expensive and less hazardous to transport than liquid samples.<br>
However, the procedure of analyte microextraction from DBS and DPS on filter, paper suffers from a number of disadvantages. For example, microextraction of sufficient DNA or RNA from filter paper involves reconstitution in a liquid medium under certain vigorous procedures, e.g., vortex and centrifugation, that damages the genetic analytes of interest. Furthermore, the fibers and other components of the filters become dislodged into the reconstitution solution, and require further centrifugation separation and/or can impede the ability to isolate the genetic material, such as by blocking genetic material from adhering to a separation column. Such prior microextraction procedures require a high standard of technical assistance, and even<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2005/102526	PCT/US2005/005392<br>
then do not consistently provide results with a desired level of sensitivity and specificity.<br>
Furthermore, the sample volume used for DBS and DPS on filter paper is-limited, typically to 50µl spots, and considerable difficulty in analyte detection can be encountered, particularly when the concentration of the desired analyte material is low in the sample. Also in the prior art, there is a lack of deliberate inhibition of enzymes and chemicals which degrade the analytes, such as genetic material contained therewithin. Even in the presence of a bacteriostatic agent there are conditions that permit enzymatic, nonenzymatic and autolytic breakdown of the genetic material. Furthermore, microextraction of genetic material from DBS or DPS on filter papers is considerably more difficult if absorption of high molecular weight DNA or RNA is required. Although the introduction of new material and transportation methods continuously improve the ways samples are handled, the quantity and quality of the sample available for subsequent analysis are still of great concern to researchers and<br>
clinicians alike.<br>
Thus, there is a need for a safe, convenient and simple device for collection, storage and transportation of liquid suspension of biological specimens containing analytes of interest in a dry state, especially in large field studies and for application in settings where collection, centrirugation, storage and shipment can be difficult, as is often the case in developing countries. In addition, there is a need for improved recovery of the biological specimens for subsequent analysis mat provides precision values and accuracy of detection of the analytes of interest contained therewithin.<br>

WO 2005/102526	PC1YUS2005/005392<br>
The present invention, provides a device and method for collection, storage and transportation of a liquid suspension of a biological specimen containing an analyte of interest. More particularly, the present invention provides a device and method for collection, storage and transportation of a liquid suspension containing a biological specimen in a dry state that is convenient and simple to use. As used herein, the terms "a" or "an" mean one or more than one depending upon the context in which they are used. For example, "an analyte" in a sample refers to a particular type of analyte of interest (e.g. HTV DNA), of which there may be numerous copies within the sample. Where a sample is referred to as containing an analyte, it is understood that the sample may contain many other types of analytes of interest also.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "collection, storage and transportation" refers to the preservation of liquid suspension of biological specimen containing analytes of interest in a form suitable for subsequent analysis. The time period for which biological specimen may be preserved according to the present invention may be as short as the time necessary to transfer a sample of biological specimen from a collection source to the place where subsequent analysis is to be performed. Therefore, the invention provides that such preservation can occur for a period of several minutes, hours, days, months or greater. The temperature conditions under which a biological specimen may be stored in the device provided by the present invention are not limited. Typically, samples are shipped and/or stored at ambient or room temperature, for example, from about 15°C to about 40°C, preferably about 15°C to 25°C. In another embodiment the samples may be stored in a cool environment For example, in short-term storage, the samples can be refrigerated at about 2°C to about 10°C. In yet another example, the samples may be refrigerated at about 4°C to about 8°C. In another example, in long-term storage, the samples can be frozen at about -80°C to about -10°C. In yet another example, the samples can be frozen from about -60°C to about -20°C. In addition, the device may preferably but not necessarily be stored in dry or desiccated conditions or under an inert atmosphere.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the present invention provides a device comprising a container defining an interior space having side walls, a bottom and a lid which may be opened. In one preferred embodiment, the invention provides a container having a threaded screw cap. In other embodiments, the lid can remain attached to the container such as a flip-top fashion. In another embodiment, the lid may also be cork-like. The lid preferably provides an air-tight seal when the container is closed. The shape of the<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2005/102526	PCT/US2005/005392<br>
container is not limited, but can be cylindrical, rectangular, or tubular for example-Materials for construction of the container are not limited, but can be plastic, metal foil, laminate comprising metal foil, metallized film, glass, silicon oxide coated films, aluminum oxide coated films, liquid crystal polymer layers, and layers of nano-composites; metal or metal alloys, acrylic, and amorphous carbon for example.<br>
In another embodiment, fee lid may be sealed to the container by heating. Suitable seals include, but are not limited to, lap seals, fin seals, butt seals, and the like, and the seals can be made by any of the suitable means known to those skilled.in the art such as heating sealing, or the application of cold or hot melt adhesives, a heated bar, hot air, infrared radiation, ultrasonic sealing, radio frequency sealing, laser sealing, and the like.<br>
The device also comprises a matrix inside the container. The matrix has an ability to absorb a liquid suspension readily and quickly, as well as to release the biological specimen containing analytes of interest efficiently and precisely. In preferred embodiments, the matrix can absorb at least 0.1 ml, 0.2 ml, 0.3 ml, 0.4 ml, 0.5 ml, 0.6 ml, 0.7 ml, 0.8 ml, or 0.9 ml, or preferably 1.0 ml, or greater, sample of a liquid suspension of a biological specimen containing an analyte of interest. The term "absorb" and "adsorb" are used interchangeably, and means that the liquid suspension is incorporated into or onto the matrix in such a way as to not be readily removed from the matrix unless subjected to conditions which are intentionally or inadvertently performed to remove the absorbed liquid suspension of biological specimen or the reconstituted biological sample from the matrix.<br>
The volume of the matrix may or may not expand upon absorption of the liquid suspension, and may or may not contract upon drying. However, a liquid saturated matrix can be compressed by at least about 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, or 90% of its saturated volume. Volumetric compression is one convenient technique for release of the reconstituted biological specimen, however, any other means, such as centrifugation, can alternatively be employed to release the biological specimen from the matrix.<br>
Therefore, as used herein, the term "compress," "compressable," "compression," and other derivatives of the word "compress" means that the volume of the saturated matrix is reduced as compared to the original volume of the saturated matrix while a force or a pressure is applied to the matrix. As used herein, the term "a portion of the biological specimen" means at least some of the biological specimen<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2005/102526	PCT/US2005/005392<br>
contained in the liquid suspension is released from the matrix. In one preferred embodiment, the matrix is compressed until the maximum volume of the reconstituted biological specimen is released from the matrix.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the matrix is three-dimensional in a shape such as cylinder, cube, sphere, pyramid or cone. In one of the preferred embodiments, the matrix is in the shape of a cylinder about 20 mm in length and 8 mm in diameter. However, the matrix can be widened, lengthened, or shortened to achieve any needed volume capacity. In yet another preferred embodiment, the matrix is removable from a container. As used herein, the term "removable" means that the matrix can be detached or separated from the container. In one of the preferred embodiments, the matrix is removably mounted in a holder on the lid of a container. In yet another preferred embodiment, the matrix is removably mounted to a lid extension of the transportation or storage container. In other embodiments, the matrix can be mounted in the container, and compressed therein to release reconstituted biological suspension through a port for example.<br>
The matrix of the present invention includes any absorbent material to which the liquid suspension of biological specimen containing analytes of interest will absorb and which does not inhibit storage or subsequent analysis of the analytes of interest applied thereto. The material of the matrix itself preferably has no or minimal effect on the measurement or detection of the analytes of interest. In preferred embodiments, the matrix comprises an absorbent material that is of a porous nature to provide entrainment of the liquid suspension in the matrix, As used herein, the term "entrain" and derivatives thereof means that during storage the liquid suspension is bound to the matrix without substantial reliance on ionic, covalent or van der waals interactions. A matrix suitable for this purpose includes, but is not limited to, a matrix that is composed of cellulose acetate fibers, wood or cotton derived cellulose, nitrocellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, hydrophilic polymers including polyproplylene, polyester, polyamide, carbohydrate polymers, polytetrafluroehtylene, glass fiber, nylon, and combinations thereof.<br>
As used herein, the term "liquid suspension" refers to any liquid medium and mixture containing biological specimens. This includes, for example, water, saline; cell suspensions of humans, animals and plants; extracts or suspensions of bacteria, fungi, plasmids, viruses; extracts or suspensions of parasites including helminthes, protozoas, spirochetes; liquid extracts or homogenates of human or animal body<br>

In preferred embodiments, the device provided by the present invention also includes a desiccant, either a natural or synthetic desiccant, inside the container to create and maintain dry conditions within the container. Preferably, the desiccant is in vaporous communication with the matrix in the device having a dye indicator reactive with moisture whereby the desiccant changes to a bright color when exposed to humidity or moisture. In one of the preferred embodiments, the desiccant is in vaporous communication with the matrix so that an air permeable barrier is formed in-between the desiccant and the matrix inside the container. The desiccant used in the device is commonly known in the art, including but is not limited to montmorillonite clay, lithium chloride, activated alumina, alkali alumino-silicate,'DQll Briquettes, silica gel, molecular sieve, calcium sulfate, and calcium oxide. The desiccant can be provided with a colorimetric indicator of water content.<br>
The matrix of the invention may optionally include a composition absorbed to the matrix wherein the composition protects against degradation of the analytes of interest contained in the biological specimens. As used herein, the term "protects against degradation of the analytes of interest" means that a matrix in the device of the invention maintains the stored analytes of interest contained in the biological specimens in a substantially nondegraded form, providing that the analytes of interest are suitable for many different types of subsequent analytical procedures. Protection against degradation may include protection against substantial damaging of analytes of interest caused by chemical or biological agents including action of bacteria, free radicals, nucleases, ultraviolet radiation, oxidizing agent, alkylating agents, or acidic agents (e.g., pollutants in the atmosphere). Preferably, the composition absorbed on the matrix of the invention may include one or more of a weak base, a chelating agent, a protein denaturing agent such as a detergent or surfactant, a nuclease inhibitor, and a free radical trap. In the case where the stored analyte of interest is RNA, particularly unstable RNA, the composition may include RNase inhibitors and inactivators, genetic probes, complementary DNA or RNA (or functionally equivalent compounds), proteins and organic moieties that stabilize RNA or prevent its degradation.<br>
Another composition which protects against degradation which may be optionally used is an oxygen scavenger element. As used herein, the term "oxygen scavenging element" refers to is a substance that consumes, depletes or reduces the<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2005/102526	PCT/US2005/005392<br>
amount of oxygen from a given environment without negatively affecting the samples of interests. Suitable oxygen scavenging elements are well-known to those skilled in the art. Non-limiting examples of oxygen scavenging elements include but are not limited to compositions comprising metal particulates reactive with oxygen such as transition metals selected from the first, second or third transition series of the periodic table of the elements, and include manganese II or,III, iron II or III, cobalt II or III, nickel II or III, copper I or II, rhodium II, III or IV, and ruthenium. The transition metal is preferably iron, nickel or copper. An' example of an iron oxygen scavenging element is D500 from Multisorb. Other commercially available oxygen scavengers may also be purchased from companies such as Mitsubishi, Dow, or the like. Other examples of oxygen scavenging element may be enzymes which consumes, depletes or reduces the amount of oxygen from the given environment without negatively affecting the samples of interests.<br>
In another embodiment, the container may optionally comprise a modified atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon through well known gas purging process prior to sealing, shipping, or storing. The term "modified atmosphere" refers to any replacing or altering normal atmospheric gas compositions with at least one inert gas or gas which does not degrade the sample of interests.<br>
As used herein, a "weak base" suitable for the composition of the invention may be a Lewis base which has a pH of about 6 to 10, preferably about pH 8 to 9.5. The weak base suitable for the composition of the invention may, in conjunction with other components of the composition, provide a composition pH of 6 to 10, preferably, about pH 8.0 to 9.5. Suitable weak bases according to the invention include organic and inorganic bases. Suitable inorganic weak bases include, for example, an alkali metal carbonate, bicarbonate, phosphate or borate (e.g., sodium, lithium, or potassium carbonate). Suitable organic weak bases include, for example, tris-hydroxymethyl amino methane (Tris), ethanolamine, triethanolamine and glycine and alkaline salts of organic acids (e.g., trisodium citrate). A preferred organic weak base is a weak monovalent organic base, for example, Tris. The weak base may be either a free base or a salt, for example, a carbonate salt. It is believed that the weak base may provide a variety of functions, such as protecting the analytes of interest from degradation, providing a buffer system, ensuring proper action of the chelating agent in binding metal ions, and preventing the action of acid nucleases which may not be completely dependent on divalent metal ions for functioning.<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2005/102526	PCT/US2005/005392<br>
As used herein, a "chelating agent" is any compound capable of complexing multivalent ions including Group II and Group III multivalent metal ions and transition metal ions (eg., Cu, Fe, Zn, Mn, etc). Preferably, the chelating agent is ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), citrate or oxalate. It is believed that one function of the chelating agent is to bind multivalent ions which if present with the stored biological specimen may cause damage to the analytes of interest, especially to nucleic acids. Ions which may be chelated by the chelating agent include multivalent active metal ions, for example, magnesium and calcium, and transition metal ions, for example, iron. Both calcium and magnesium are known to promote nucleic acid degradation by acting as co-factors for enzymes which may destroy nucleic acids (e.g., most known nucleases). In addition, transition metal ions, such as iron, may readily undergo oxidation and reduction and damage nucleic acids by the production of free radicals or by direct oxidation.<br>
The composition can further include a protein denaturing agent if the analytes of interest are nucleic acids. As used herein, a "protein denaturing agent" functions to denature non-nucleic acids compounds, for example, nucleases. If the protein denaturing agent is a detergent or a surfactant, the surfactant may also act as a wetting agent to facilitate the uptake of a sample by the dry solid matrix. The terms "surfactant" and "detergent" are synonymous and may be used interchangeably throughout the specification. Any agent which denatures proteins without substantially affecting the nucleic acids of interest may be suitable for the invention. Preferred protein denaturing agents include detergents. As used herein "detergents" include ionic detergents, preferably anionic detergents. A preferred anionic detergent suitable for the invention may have a hydrocarbon moiety, such as an aliphatic or aromatic moiety, and one or more anionic groups. Particularly preferred anionic detergents include sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and sodium lauryl sarcosinate (SLS). The ionic detergent causes inactivation of a microorganism which has protein or lipid in its outer membranes or capsids, for example, fungi, bacteria or viruses. This includes microorganisms which may be pathogenic to humans or which may cause degradation of nucleic acids. It is believed that inactivation of a microorganism by a detergent is a result of destruction of the secondary structure of the organisms external proteins, internal proteins, protein containing membranes, or any other protein necessary for viability. However, the detergent may not inactivate some forms of organisms, for example, highly resistant bacterial spores and extremely stable enteric virions.<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2005/102526	PCT/US2005/005392<br>
The composition of the invention may optionally include a free radical trap. As used herein, a "free radical trap" is a compound which is sufficiently reactive to be preferred, over a DNA molecule or a component thereof, as a reactant- with a free radical, and which is sufficiently stable not to generate damaging free radicals itself. Examples of a suitable free radical trap include: uric acid or a urate salt, mannitol, benzoate (Na, K, Li or tris salt), 1-3 dimethyl uric acid, guanidine, guanine, thymine, adenine, cytosine, in N-acetyl-histidine, histidine, deferoxamine, dimethyl sulfoxide, 5'5' dimethyl pyrroline-N-oxide, thiocyanate salt and thiourea. Preferred free radical traps include mannitol, thiocyanate salts, uric acid or a urate salt. It is believed that the longer the period of time for which the nucleic acid is to be stored the more likely that a free radical trap may be advantageously included in the composition sorbed to the solid matrix. Even if the nucleic acid is only to be stored for a matter of minutes, a free radical trap may still be incorporated into the composition. It is believed that one function of the free radical trap may be to trap nucleic acid damaging free radicals. For example, when the free radical trap used is uric acid or urate salt it may be converted to allantoin which may also act as a free radical trap that preferentially accepts free radicals that would otherwise damage nucleotide bases, for example, guanine. Preferably, the free radical trap reacts with free radicals regardless of source (including free radicals present in the air). Free radicals may be generated through oxidation or reduction of iron in biological specimen, such as blood. Typically, free radicals are believed to be generated by spontaneous oxidation of the groups which are present, for example, in denatured serum protein of blood. Free radicals may also be generated by radiation such as UV light, x-rays and high-energy particles. In addition, free radical traps which are also a weak acid, e.g. uric acid, may also function as a component of the buffering system provided by the weak base discussed above. Also, the free radical trap may enhance removal of a stored sample of nucleic acids if in situ processing is not desired.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1A &amp; IB, an exemplary transportation or storage device of the invention is shown for collecting, storing and transporting liquid suspension of biological specimen containing analytes of interest is shown. The container 20 is cylindrical and has side walls 22, a bottom 24 and an openable lid 26, which sealingly engages the container 20 opening.

Accordingly, a desiccant 40 is also placed inside the container 20, separated with the matrix 30 by an optional air permeable barrier 42, for in vaporous communication with the matrix 30 to control humidity or moisture therein.<br>
The present invention further provides a method for collecting, storing or transporting a liquid suspension of biological specimen containing analytes of interest. The method includes: a) applying the liquid suspension of biological specimen to the matrix in the device, and b) sealing the lid/cap on the device after the liquid suspension applied thereon is dry. In preferred embodiments, the liquid suspension, is air-dried at room temperature. Other commonly available drying methods, such as vacuum dry, low heat dry, low pressure dry, and fan dry, may also be used.<br>
Referring to Fig. IB, the lid 26 of the container 20 has a lid extension 28 holding a removable matrix 30 which is disassembled. A liquid suspension of any biological specimen containing analytes of interest is added on the top of the matrix 30 and is allowed to fully absorb into the matrix 30 (See Fig. 3). The lid 26 with the matrix 30 having bound biological specimen thereon is allowed to air-dry, and then reassembled with the container 20 for storage or transportation at ambient temperature.<br>
The method of the present invention further optionally includes an intermediate step of applying a stabilizing composition to the matrix to protect the analytes of interest against degradation. Depending upon the analytes of interest, the stabilizing composition, as discussed above, may include but is not limit to one or more of a weak base, a chelating agent, a protein denaturing agent such as a detergent or surfactant, a nuclease inhibitor, and a free radical trap. Particularly for protection of unstable RNA, the stabilizing composition may include RNase inhibitors and inactivators, genetic probes, complementary DNA or RNA (or functionally equivalent compounds), proteins and organic moieties that stabilize RNA or prevent its degradation.<br>
The present invention fiirther provides a method for recovering from the matrix in the device the biological specimen containing analytes of interest In preferred embodiments, the method includes the following steps: a) applying reconstitution buffer to the matrix to rehydrate the bound biological specimen containing analytes of interest, and b) compressing the matrix to release a portion of the biological specimen. According to the present invention, the reconstitution buffer includes the components of IX phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or nuclease-free water optionally with the addition of sodium azide or other antimicrobial agent. The reconstitution buffer may<br>

also include any number or combinations of available biological preservatives or blood anticoagulants including but not limited to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), sodium citrate, and heparin. PBS or nuclease-free water serves as the sterile and neutral medium for the rehydration, resuspension, and recovery of the analyse(s) of interest from the matrix. When included, antimicrobial agents such as sodium azide prevent microbial growth and subsequent contamination with RNases. When included, biological preservatives such as EDTA, sodium citrate, and heparin serve as anticoagulants and or chelating agents.<br>

In one of the preferred embodiments, the analytes of interest are nucleic acids including either or both DNA or RNA molecules. Preferably, the liquid suspension of biological specimen contains at least about 500 ng isolated DNA or UNA molecules, more preferably at least about 1 µg DNA or RNA molecules. As used herein, the term "isolated," "isolation," and other derivatives of the word "isolate" means that the DNA or RNA molecules are substantially free from some of the other cellular material with which it is naturally associated, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized.<br>
The present invention further provides that the analytes of interest contained in the biological specimen recovered from the matrix of the device into the reconstitution buffer are subject to subsequent analysis. As used herein, the term "subsequent analysis" includes any analysis which may be performed on recovered biological specimens stored in reconstitution buffer. Alternatively, the analytes of interest contained in the biological specimen may be isolated, purified or extracted prior to analysis using methods known in the art. The analytes of interest may be subjected to chemical, biochemical or biological analysis. In one of the preferred embodiments, the analytes of interest are nucleic acids including either or both DNA or RNA molecules<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2005/102526	PCT/US 2005/005392<br>
that can be detected or analyzed with or without' prior extraction, purification or isolation. DNA or RNA extraction, purification or isolation, if necessary, is performed based on methods known in the art. Examples of subsequent analysis include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), ligase chain reaction (LCR), reverse transcriptase initiated PCR, DNA or RNA hybridization techniques including restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), viral DNA or RNA detection and quantification, viral load tests, DNA or RNA genotyping, etc. "Subsequent analysis" also includes other techniques using genetic probes, genomic sequencing, enzymatic assays, affinity labeling, methods of detection using labels or antibodies and other similar methods.<br>

The kit may optionally include a stabilizing solution. Kits of the present invention can further include a reconstitution buffer, a compression device and further protocols for rehydration and recovery of the biological specimen. The container of the kit may be any container suitable for use during application of a liquid suspension of biological specimen containing analytes of interest to the matrix or during application and one or more phases of subsequent processing of a sample of the biological specimen. Therefore, a kit may be used to apply a liquid suspension to the matrix where the matrix is removed from the kit container for processing in a different container. Alternatively, a liquid suspension of biological specimen may be applied, stored, transported and further processed all in the same kit container.<br>
The kit may also include one or more of any of the matrix disclosed herein. This includes one or more matrix with or without compositions for protection of analytes of interest contained in the biological specimen. One aspect of the kit of the present invention is that the reconstituted biological specimen containing analytes of interest is released by compressing the matrix. This procedure avoids vortexing and centrifuging the sample, i providing decreased chance of sample damage, human labor costs and matrix contamination of the sample. A compression device of the kit of the present invention may be any device that is used to provide a force or pressure on the matrix to compress it. In one of the preferred embodiments, the compression device is a syringe, wherein the matrix is placed in the syringe barrel and the force or pressure is<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1 One (1.0) ml Sample Preparation and Device Recovery Kit<br>
Kit Components:<br>
This example provides a kit for the preparation, transportation, and recovery of thirty-six (36) dry biological specimens from bodily fluids or tissue. Materials and reagents for the preparation and recovery of thirty-six (36) one (1.0) ml samples for dried ambient transportation include the following:<br><br>
Storage and Handling:<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2005/102526	PCT/US2005/005392<br>
Upon receipt, all kit components are stored dry at room temperature (15-25°C). Only use device container tubes when the indicating desiccant is blue in color. The device kit container tubes should not be if the indicating desiccant appears white or pink in color. Materials, such as 1000 µl pipette, 1000 µl sterile DNase-free, RNase-free pipette tips with aerosol barrier, rack for holding 15 ml conical tubes, safety glasses, laboratory coat, powder-free disposable gloves and biohazard waste container, are also required but are not provided by the kit. Safety Precautions:<br>
Disposable powder-free gloves are used to handle all materials as though capable of transmitting infectious agents. Utilize good laboratory practices and universal precautions relating to the prevention of transmission of blood borne pathogens {See Centers for Disease Control. Update: Universal precautions for prevention of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus and other blood borne pathogens in healthcare settings. MMWR, 1988;37:377-82, 387-8; National Committee for Clinical Laborator Standards. Protection of laboratory workers from infectious disease transmitted by blood, body fluids, and tissue; approved guideline. NCCLS Document M29-A Villanova (PA): NCCLS;1997 Dec. 90p; Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1030). Immediately, clean up any spills suspected of potentially containing infectious agents with 0.5% w/v sodium hypochlorite (10% v/v bleach). Dispose of all specimens and materials coming into contact with specimens as though they contain infectious agents. In the event that materials known or suspected of containing infectious agents are ingested or come in contact with open lacerations, lesions, or mucous membranes (eyes, nasal passages, etc.), consult a physician immediately.<br>
Example 2 Sample Preparation Using the Device Kit<br>
The sample preparation steps were performed within a biological safety cabinet using sterile technique and universal precautions relating to the handling of potentially infectious materials. Before beginning the sample preparation process, the protocol of using the device kit that is illustrated in Figs. 1A &amp; IB should be familiarized.<br>
Before loading a sample liquid suspension of biological specimen containing analytes of interest, the cap from the device container was unscrewed, inverted and<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2005/102526	PCT/US2005/005392<br>
placed on a clean working surface with the absorbent matrix facing upwards (See Figs. 1A &amp; IB). About up to 1 ml of sample fluid was slowly added to the top of the matrix plug and allowed it to fully absorb into the matrix. The device kit matrix loaded with the sample fluid was allowed to air-dry. In general, air-drying within a biological safety cabinet takes approximately 4.5 to 5 hours. Once the sample is completely dry, the cap holding the dried specimen-containing matrix was carefully reattached back to the device kit container tube. The specimen is'now ready for shipment or storage at ambient temperature.<br>
Example 3 Sample Recovery Using the Device kit<br>
The sample recovery steps were also performed within a biological safety cabinet using sterile technique and universal precautions relating to the handling of potentially infectious materials. Basically, a sterile 3 or 5 ml disposable Luer-Lok(tm) syringe (provided by the kit) was inserted into a 15 ml collection tube (also provided by the kit). The plunger was removed from the syringe barrel. The absorbent matrix containing the dried specimen was transferred into the syringe barrel by pressing the matrix against the sterile inside of the syringe barrel's mouth with just enough pressure to break it free from the attached cap and allow it to fall freely to the bottom of the syringe (See Figs. 4 &amp; 5). The syringe barrel with detached matrix plug was placed into a 15 ml conical collection tube, which is further placed into a rack. About 1 ml of Reconstitution Buffer (supplied by the kit) was applied slowly and directly to the top of the matrix plug to gently re-hydrate the dried specimen absorbed inside the matrix (See Fig. 6). It is necessary to inspect the absorption rate and adjust the application speed as needed while adding the reconstitution buffer, and try not to allow buffer to collect at the bottom of the syringe without first being absorbed into the matrix because failing to fully absorb the reconstitution buffer may result in lower recovery yields. The re-hydrating specimen was allowed to incubate for at least 10 minutes at room temperature prior to adding an additional 175 p.1 of Reconstitution Buffer to the top of the matrix plug.<br>
The syringe plunger was re-inserted into the syringe barrel and depressed with firm even pressure until the plunger has completely compressed the matrix plug and a maximum volume of approximately 1 ml is collected inside the 15 ml collection tube (See Fig. 7A, 7B, 7C, &amp; 7D). The syringe barrel, the plunger and the compressed<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2005/102526	PCT/US20 05/005392<br>
matrix plug were then removed from the 15 ml collection tube and discarded into an appropriate waste receptacle. The 15 ml collection tube containing the newly recovered specimen was sealed with the provided screw cap. The reconstituted sample is ready for storage, testing, or further subsequent analysis.<br>

The matrix specimens were reconstituted and recovered on day 1 post preparation and were used to examine the intra-assay viral load reproducibility of the Versant viral load<br>
assay.<br>
NucliSens viral load intra-assay reproducibility using the device kit: five matrices were prepared for each of three randomly selected HIV-1 positive plasma samples (N=15).<br>
The matrix specimens were reconstituted and recovered on day 3.5 post preparation and were used to examine the intra-assay viral load reproducibiliry of the NucliSens viral load assay.<br>
HIV-1 genotyping stability: Three archived HIV-1 positive plasma samples with previously determined viral-loads were randomly selected to prepare the device matrices for genotype stability testing. Two identical sets of matrices were prepared for each sample following the method described above. The dry packaged matrices were stored at ambient temperature for up to 7 days. Reconstituted plasma for each set of matrices was recovered on either day 1 or day 7, respectively. For each sample the entire recovered volume was extracted. Genotyping was performed on all samples using the TRUGENE HIV-1 genotyping kit, following the manufacturer's protocol. The matrix genotypes were then compared with previously determined frozen plasma-derived genotypes.<br>
HIV-1/HCV co-infection: For each of three HIV-1/HCV co-infected plasma samples, a single matrix and frozen plasma aliquot were prepared by an external laboratory and shipped overnight to Research Think Tank. The plasma aliquots were shipped on dry ice, while the device kit specimens were shipped separately at ambient temperature. Upon receipt, the matrix specimens were stored at ambient temperature until reconstituted for testing on day 7 post preparation. The corresponding frozen plasma were thawed for testing in parallel on day 7. All samples were assayed for viral load in duplicate using the Standard AMPLICOR viral load assay. A 140 µL volume of each sample was extracted for total RNA (HIV-1 and HCV), then genotyped using<br>

WO 2005/102526	PCT/US2005/005392<br>
the TRUGENE HIV-1, the HIV-1 GeneTanker and the HCV TRUGENE HCV 5'NC kits, following manufacturer's protocol.<br>
Phenotyping: RNA extracted from matched The device kit and frozen plasma HIV-1/HCV co-infected specimens were submitted for Phenoscript(tm)(VIRalliance) Paris, France) phenotyping analysis. Results:<br>
Device Kit Characteristics: The device kit consisted of an absorbent fibrous matrix for the preparation of dried plasma specimens and. a desiccant storage/transportation tube. The matrix yielded an approximate recovered plasma volume of 1.035 +/-0.03mL. The device kit specimens were dried in a biosafety cabinet, at ambient temperature, for a minimum of 4.5 hours prior to packaging. Viral load assays: The mean logio difference between matched frozen and the device kit dried plasma specimens using the standard AMPLICOR HIV-1 and VERSANT HIV-1 assay was 0.36 and 0.51, respectively (Table 6A and B; Standard Roche viral load for 9 randomly selected specimens and Bayer bDNA HIV-1 viral load for 12 randomly selected specimens respectively). Intra-assay quantitative reproducibility experiments for device kit indicated an overall Logio mean variance of 0.05 for the Ultrasensitive AMPLICOR HIV-1 assay at day 7 (Table 4), 0.05 for the VERSANT HIV-1 assay at day 1 (Table 3) and 0.06 for the NucliSens HIV-1 QT assay at day 3.5 (Table 7). Viral load values obtained from the device kit specimens were consistently lower than those obtained from matched frozen plasma specimens.<br>
Genotyping assays: The sequence quality generated between matched the device kit and frozen plasma specimens was comparable. However, in several sequences the device kit specimens exhibited an increase in sequence quality (data not shown). Mutation profiles obtained using either the TRUGENE HIV-1 and/or HIV-1 GeneTanker genotyping kits exhibited a high degree of concordance between matched the device kit and frozen plasma specimens (Table 1 and 2). This concordance was consistent regardless of HIV-1 viral-load, storage time or shipping conditions prior to genotype testing. Among matched co-infected the device kit and frozen plasma specimens, there was a 100% concordance at the genotype level for HCV using the TRUGENE HCV 5'NC kit. While samples 37 and 39 were in agreement at the subtype level, HCV subtype was unable to be determined for the sample 38 plasma specimens. Phenotyping: Phenorype results were successfully obtained for all matched HIV-1/HCV co-infected The device kit and frozen plasma specimens.<br>
