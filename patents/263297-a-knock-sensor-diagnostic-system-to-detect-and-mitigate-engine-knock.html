				<td>KNOCK SENSOR DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM AND METHOD<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates generally to powertrain control<br>
systems, and more particularly to knock sensors.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The background description provided herein is for the purpose of<br>
generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named<br>
inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects<br>
of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are<br>
neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.<br>
[0003] Internal combustions engines combust an air and fuel (A/F) mixture<br>
within cylinders to produce drive torque. More specifically, the combustion events<br>
reciprocally drive pistons that in turn drive a crankshaft to provide output torque.<br>
The A/F mixture is ignited at a desired crank angle. In some instances, however,<br>
the A/F mixture auto-ignites ahead of an ignition flame-front within the cylinders.<br>
This results in abnormal combustion or engine knock.<br>
[0004] During an engine knock condition, temperature and pressure of an<br>
unburned air/fuel mixture exceeds a certain level, which causes gases in an engine<br>
to auto-ignite. This combustion produces a shock wave that generates a rapid<br>
increase in cylinder pressure. Damage to pistons, rings, and exhaust valves can<br>
result if sustained heavy engine knock occurs. Engine knock can be heard by<br>
vehicle passengers.<br><br>
[0005] Modern engine control systems are designed to minimize exhaust<br>
emissions while maximizing power and fuel economy. Advancements in spark<br>
timing for a given air/fuel ratio are made to increase power and improve fuel<br>
economy. In general, advancing a spark relative to top dead center increases<br>
torque until a point is reached at which a peak torque is produced. When the spark<br>
is advanced too far, engine knock occurs. Thus, a spark is typically advanced to<br>
maximize output torque without generating engine knock.<br>
[0006] Accordingly, engine knock control systems have been developed to<br>
detect and to mitigate engine knock. Conventional knock detection systems include<br>
a knock sensor and a dedicated knock detection chip (knock IC) to process the<br>
knock sensor signal and calculate the engine knock intensity. An individual knock<br>
sensor and knock IC can be used to detect knock from each cylinder. Spark timing<br>
is adjusted based on detected engine knock.<br>
[0007] Over time and use an engine knock sensor circuit may experience<br>
a short or an open circuit. As a result, signals received from an engine knock sensor<br>
may be inaccurate or ineffective in preventing engine knock. Diagnosing a knock<br>
sensor circuit is difficult due to intrinsic high resistance and moderate capacitance<br>
associated therewith.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008] A knock sensor diagnostic system is provided that includes a knock<br>
sensor. A bias circuit applies a bias voltage to the knock sensor. An input circuit<br>
receives an input signal based on the bias voltage. A control module indicates a<br><br>
short circuit associated with the knock sensor based on the input signal. The bias<br>
voltage may be a direct current (DC) bias voltage.<br>
[0009] In another feature, a method of operating a knock sensor diagnostic<br>
system includes applying a bias voltage to a knock sensor. A first input signal is<br>
received based on the bias voltage. A test signal, with a predetermined frequency,<br>
is generated and applied to the knock sensor. A second input signal is received<br>
based on the test signal. A short circuit associated with the knock sensor is<br>
indicated based on the first input signal. An open circuit associated with the knock<br>
sensor is indicated based on the second input signal.<br>
[0010] In still another feature, a knock sensor diagnostic system is<br>
provided that includes a knock sensor. A signal generator generates and applies a<br>
diagnostic signal with a predetermined frequency to the knock sensor. An input<br>
circuit receives an input signal that is based on the diagnostic signal. A control<br>
module indicates an open circuit associated with the knock sensor based on the<br>
input signal.<br>
[0011] Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become<br>
apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood<br>
that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating exemplary<br>
embodiments of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are<br>
not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br><br>

according to an embodiment of the present disclosure;<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0016] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in no<br>
way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of clarity,<br>
the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify similar<br>
elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should be<br>
construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It should<br>
be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different order without<br>
altering the principles of the present disclosure.<br>
[0017] As used herein, the term module refers to an Application Specific<br>
Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or<br>
group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware programs, a<br><br>
combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that provide the<br>
described functionality.<br>
[0018] Referring now to FIG. 1, a functional block diagram of a vehicle<br>
control system 10 of a vehicle 11 is shown. The vehicle control system 10 includes<br>
a knock sensor diagnostic system 12. The knock sensor diagnostic system 12<br>
determines status of one or more knock sensors 13, which are mounted on an<br>
engine 14, and/or corresponding circuitry. The status may include output of a knock<br>
sensor, a fault with a knock sensor, a fault with corresponding knock sensor circuitry,<br>
quality of a knock sensor signal, and other knock sensor system status indicators. A<br>
fault with a knock sensor and/or corresponding circuitry may include a short circuit,<br>
an open circuit, or an improperly functioning circuit. A quality status may include<br>
signal levels, noise levels, signal-to-noise ratios, interference levels and other signal<br>
quality indicators. A detailed example of a knock sensor diagnostic system that may<br>
be used in replacement of the knock sensor diagnostic system 12 is shown and<br>
described with respect to FIG. 2.<br>
[0019] The vehicle 11 includes an engine 14 that has cylinders 15. Each<br>
cylinder 15 may have one or more intake valves and/or exhaust valves. The engine<br>
14 is configured with a fuel injection system 16 and an ignition system 18. An output<br>
of the engine 14 is coupled by a torque converter 22, a transmission 24, a driveshaft<br>
26 and a differential 28 to driven front wheels 30. The transmission 24 may, for<br>
example, be a continuously variable transmission (CVT) or a step-gear automatic<br>
transmission. The transmission 24 is controlled by a vehicle control module 20.<br>
Another control module, for example, a transmission control module may be used<br><br>
alone or in combination with the control module 20 in other embodiments to control<br>
the transmission 24.<br>
[0020] An electronic throttle controller (ETC) 36, or a cable-driven throttle,<br>
adjusts a throttle plate 38 that is located adjacent to an inlet of an intake manifold 40.<br>
The adjustment is based upon a position of an accelerator pedal 42 and a throttle<br>
control algorithm that is executed by the control module 20 The throttle 38 adjusts<br>
output torque that drives the wheels 30. An accelerator pedal sensor 44 generates<br>
a pedal position signal that is output to the control module 20 based on a position of<br>
the accelerator pedal 42. A position of a brake pedal 46 is sensed by a brake pedal<br>
sensor or switch 48, which generates a brake pedal position signal that is output to<br>
the control module 20.<br>
[0021] Other sensor inputs collectively indicated by reference number 50<br>
and used by the control module 20 include an engine speed signal 52, a vehicle<br>
speed signal 54, an intake manifold pressure signal 56, a throttle position signal 58,<br>
a transmission throttle signal 60, transmission pulley speed signals 62, 64 and<br>
manifold air temperature signal 66. The sensor input signals 52-66 are respectively<br>
generated by engine speed sensor 53, vehicle speed sensor 55, intake manifold<br>
pressure sensor 57, throttle position sensor 59, transmission throttle sensor 61,<br>
pulley sensors 63, 65, and temperature sensor 67. The transmission throttle signal<br>
60 indicates throttle pressure in the transmission 24. The pulley speed signals 62, 64<br>
indicate transmission input and output pulley speeds. The temperature signal 66<br>
indicates air temperature in the intake manifold 40. Other sensors may also be<br>
included.<br><br>
[0022] A knock sensor 13, e.g., an accelerometer, is mounted on the<br>
engine 14 and senses combustion detonation and engine knock in one or more of<br>
the cylinders 15. The knock sensor 13 provides a knock sensor signal 70 to the<br>
control module 20 that indicates extent of sensed engine knocking. Knock detection<br>
in the vehicle 11 may be performed, however, using techniques, devices and/or<br>
methods other than by use of the knock sensor 13. For example, engine parameters<br>
that are sensed and determined, via components other than a knock sensor, may be<br>
used to indirectly determine whether knock is present.<br>
[0023] Referring now also to FIG. 2, a functional block diagram and<br>
schematic view of a knock sensor diagnostic system 12" is shown. The knock<br>
sensor diagnostic system 12' includes one or more knock sensors 13' and an engine<br>
control module (ECM) 100. Each knock sensor 13' is part of a knock sensor circuit<br>
102. The ECM 100 may be part of the vehicle control module 20 or may be a<br>
separate stand alone control module. The ECM 100 includes an ECM<br>
microprocessor 104, a biasing circuit 106, a low-speed input circuit 108, an output<br>
test circuit 110, and a high-speed input circuit 111.<br>
[0024] The ECM microprocessor 104 may be in the form of or included as<br>
part of an integrated circuit (IC) chip. Although the ECM microprocessor 104 is<br>
shown having a particular number of inputs and outputs, additional inputs and<br>
outputs, such as inputs and outputs dedicated to knock sensor control, monitoring,<br>
and diagnostics, may be incorporated. The ECM may include a filter 112, a Fast<br>
Fourier Transform (FFT) device 113, and a digital signal processor (DSP) 114. The<br>
filter 112 may be a multiple order infinite impulse response (MR) filter or some other<br><br>
filter. The filter 112 and the FFT 113 filter and convert a high-speed input signal 117<br>
from a time domain representation to a frequency domain representation. The DSP<br>
114 may be used to implement the filter and FFT functions in digital format.<br>
[0025] The biasing circuit 106 and low-speed input circuit 108 are directed<br>
to detection of a short circuit within the knock sensor 131 and/or associated circuitry.<br>
The output test circuit 110 and high-speed input circuit 111 are directed to detection<br>
of an open circuit within the knock sensor 131 and/or associated circuitry. The high-<br>
speed input circuit 111 is also directed to the detection of engine knock.<br>
[0026] The ECM 100 has input/output (I/O) terminals 115, which are<br>
coupled to the knock sensor circuit 102. For the example shown, the knock sensor<br>
circuit 102 includes the knock sensor 13', which has knock sensor high and low-side<br>
terminals 116, 118. The knock sensor terminals 116, 118 may perform as input<br>
and/or output terminals. The knock sensor 13' may include, for example, a<br>
piezoelectric crystal that is mounted on a metal can, which picks up audible noise.<br>
The knock sensor 131 may include other elements or devices that allow for the<br>
detection of engine knock.<br>
[0027] The biasing circuit 106 applies a bias voltage across the knock<br>
sensor terminals 116, 118. The biasing circuit 106 may include a first resistor R1, a<br>
second resistor R2, and a third resistor R3, which are coupled in series. The first<br>
resistor R1 is coupled between a voltage supply Vs and the sensor high-side<br>
terminal 116. The second resistor R2 is coupled between the first resistor R1 and<br>
the third resistor R3. The second resistor R2 is also coupled across the knock<br><br>
sensor terminals 116, 118. The third resistor R3 is coupled between the second<br>
resistor R2 and the ground reference 120.<br>
[0028] The low-speed input circuit 108 may perform as a low pass filter<br>
and may include a fourth resistor R4 and a first capacitor C1. The fourth resistor R4<br>
is coupled between the low-side terminal 118 and a low-speed input 107 of the ECM<br>
microprocessor 104. A first end of the first capacitor C1 is coupled to both the fourth<br>
resistor R4 and the low-speed input 107. The other end of the first capacitor C1 is<br>
coupled to the ground reference 120. The low-speed input circuit 108 provides a<br>
low-speed input signal 109 to the ECM microprocessor 104.<br>
[0029] The output test circuit 110 provides a diagnostic test signal 130 to<br>
the knock sensor 13". The test signal 130 may be provided to the high-side of the<br>
knock sensor 13'. The output test circuit 110 may include a fifth resistor R5, which is<br>
coupled between the high-side terminal 116 and a diagnostic test output 132 of the<br>
ECM microprocessor 104.<br>
[0030] The high-speed input circuit 111 includes an alternating current<br>
(AC) coupling circuit 134, a bias/gain network 136 and an amplifier 138. The AC<br>
coupling circuit removes direct current (DC) bias and may include a second<br>
capacitor C2 and a third capacitor C3. The second capacitor C2 is coupled between<br>
the high-side terminal 116 and the bias/gain network 136. The third capacitor C3 is<br>
coupled between the low-side terminal 118 and the bias/gain network 136. The<br>
capacitors C2, C3 AC couple a knock sensor signal on ECM terminals 115 to the<br>
bias/gain network 136. This removes the static bias applied by the bias circuit 106.<br><br>
[0031] The bias/gain network 136 may include bias and gain adjusting<br>
elements that are used to adjust the bias and gain of signals received from the<br>
knock sensor 13'. The bias/gain network 136 provides a differential output 138 that<br>
is provided to inverting and non-inverting inputs 140, 142 of the amplifier 138.<br>
Output 144 of the amplifier 138 is coupled to a high-speed analog-to-digital<br>
converter (ADC) input 146 of the ECM microprocessor 104. A feedback signal path<br>
148 is provided between the bias/gain network 136 and the output 144.<br>
[0032] Note that the low-speed and high-speed designations, with regards<br>
to the inputs 107, 146, correspond to the reception of low or high frequency signals.<br>
The low-speed and high-speed designations indicate low-speed and high-speed<br>
sampling and processing rates for inputs 107, 146 by the microprocessor 104.<br>
[0033] The above-described elements of the knock sensor diagnostic<br>
system 12" are provided for example purposes only. Other elements may be<br>
included and/or replace the above-described elements. As an example, a knock IC<br>
that includes the ECM microprocessor 104 may include amplifiers, filters, a rectifier,<br>
an integrator, an A/D converter, a sample and hold device, and other analog and/or<br>
digital circuit elements.<br>
[0034] Referring now also to FIG. 3, a flow diagram illustrating a method of<br>
operating a knock sensor diagnostic system is shown. Although the following steps<br>
are described primarily with respect to operation of the knock sensor diagnostic<br>
system of FIG. 2, the steps may be easily modified to apply to other embodiments of<br>
the present invention.<br><br>
[0035] In step 200, the bias circuit 106 applies a bias voltage to the knock<br>
sensor 13'. As an example, the supply voltage Vs may be 5v. In step 202, the knock<br>
sensor 13" generates a knock sensor output signal, which has a high-side<br>
component and a low-side component. The high and low side components are<br>
provided on the high and low side output terminals 116, 118.<br>
[0036] In step 204, the low-speed input circuit 108 filters the knock sensor<br>
output signal or a component thereof to generate the low-speed input signal 109. In<br>
the example embodiment of FIG. 2, the low-speed input circuit 108 filters the low-<br>
side component and removes high frequencies, such as noise. Use of a low-pass<br>
filter prevents false diagnosis due to high frequency signals. The low-pass filter<br>
may, as an example, have a cutoff frequency of approximately 100-200Hz. The low-<br>
speed circuit 108 may also remove frequency components associated with engine<br>
knock.<br>
[0037] In step 206, the ECM microprocessor 104 receives the low-speed<br>
input signal 109, which is based on the applied bias voltage. In step 208, the ECM<br>
microprocessor 104 generates a first diagnostic signal and/or indicates a short circuit<br>
associated with the knock sensor 13' based on the low-speed input signal 109.<br>
When a short does not exist, a nominal voltage is measured by the ECM<br>
microprocessor 104. When a short circuit does exist, such as a short to ground or a<br>
high-voltage potential on either side of the knock sensor 13', a substantial change in<br>
the nominal voltage occurs. This change is detected by the ECM microprocessor<br>
104, which can then make a robust diagnostic decision. The high-voltage potential<br>
may, for example, be greater than the supply voltage Vs.<br><br>
[0038] In step 210, the output test circuit 110 generates and applies the<br>
test signal 130, with a predetermined frequency, to the knock sensor 13*. The test<br>
signal 130 may be in the form of a square wave and applied to the high-side of the<br>
knock sensor 13', as shown in FIG. 2. In one embodiment, the predetermined<br>
frequency is set outside a frequency range associated with knock detection. In<br>
another embodiment, the predetermined frequency is set outside a frequency range<br>
associated with engine background noise. In yet another embodiment, the<br>
predetermined frequency is set at approximately 20-21 kHz or approximately 20.5<br>
kHz, which is greater than an engine knock frequency window of approximately 5-18<br>
kHz and a normal engine noise frequency range. There is significant separation<br>
between the predetermined frequency and the engine knock frequency window.<br>
Note that the predetermined frequency may be greater than or less than the<br>
frequency ranges associated with engine knock and engine noise. Since the<br>
predetermined frequency is greater than or outside a frequency range that is<br>
associated with engine knock detection, the test signal 130 does not affect engine<br>
knock detection. Step 210 may be performed continuously.<br>
[0039] In step 212, the knock sensor 13' generates a knock sensor output<br>
signal, similar to step 202. Steps 202 and 212 may be performed simultaneously,<br>
may be performed as a single step, and/or may be performed continuously.<br>
[0040] In step 214, the bias/gain network 136 adjusts bias and gain of the<br>
knock sensor signal after AC coupling by the AC coupling circuit 134. In step 216,<br>
the amplifier 138 amplifies the differential output signal from the bias/gain network<br>
136. In step 218, output of the amplifier 138 or the high-speed input signal 117 is<br><br>
received by the ECM microprocessor 104. The high-speed input signal 117 is based<br>
on the test signal 130.<br>
[0041] In step 220, the filter 112 filters the high-speed input signal 117.<br>
The filter 112 removes signals having frequency above the predetermined<br>
frequency. In step 222, the FFT device 113 generates a frequency domain signal<br>
that is based on the filtered high-speed input signal 117.<br>
[0042] In step 224, the ECM microprocessor 104 generates an engine<br>
knock signal that is based on the frequency domain signal. Engine knock intensity is<br>
calculated, which is based on the knock sensor signal. An individual knock sensor<br>
and knock IC can be used to detect knock from each cylinder of an engine. Steps<br>
220-224 may be performed within the ECM microprocessor 104, via dedicated<br>
software. Steps 220-224 may also be performed via hardware.<br>
[0043] In step 226, generating a second diagnostic signal and/or indicates<br>
an open circuit associated with the knock sensor 13' based on the high-speed input<br>
signal 117 and/or normal engine audible levels, which may include background<br>
noise.<br>
[0044] In operation of the knock sensor diagnostic system 12', open circuit<br>
diagnosis at low engine speeds may be performed by applying the test signal, as<br>
described above. Low engine speeds may refer to speeds at approximately less<br>
than a predetermined engine speed, such as 3000 revolutions-per-minute (RPM).<br>
The test signal passes through capacitance of the knock sensor 13'. The test signal<br>
is detected on both terminals 116, 118 and is substantially the same on both<br>
terminals 116, 118. Thus, at the terminals 116, 118 the test signal is referred to as a<br><br>
common mode signal. The common mode signal is rejected by the amplifier 138,<br>
which results in only a small differential signal at the applied frequency. An open<br>
circuit in the knock sensor 13' or associated circuit converts the test signal into a<br>
differential mode signal, which is detected by the amplifier 138. As a result, there is<br>
an increase in amplitude of the high-speed input signal 117, which is robustly<br>
detected by the ECM microprocessor 104 after signal processing. Thus, similar<br>
processing is used for both normal engine knock detection operation, as well as<br>
open circuit detection. Note that the test signal may be applied and amplitude<br>
thereof may be detected at any engine operating speed or over an entire engine<br>
speed range.<br>
[0045] At high engine speeds, such as at speeds at or equal to<br>
approximately the predetermined engine speed, engine background noise may<br>
begin to "drown out" the applied test signal. This is true when the predetermined<br>
frequency is not outside the frequency range of the engine noise. At speeds above<br>
the predetermined engine speed, signal levels from the engine background noise<br>
allow for a robust detection of an open circuit. When an open circuit is present the<br>
ECM microprocessor 104 is unable to detect the engine background noise via the<br>
knock sensor 13". Thus, at high engine speeds, the ECM microprocessor may<br>
determine the presence of an open circuit due to lack of engine background noise<br>
detection. Approximate engine background noise levels may be stored and<br>
compared with current detected background noise levels to determine presence of<br>
an open circuit.<br><br>
[0046] Thus, the high-speed signal channel may be used for open circuit<br>
diagnosis over low and high engine speeds. High-speed open circuit detection may<br>
be based on the test signal and/or on the lack of engine background noise,<br>
depending upon whether the predetermined frequency is within the frequency range<br>
of the engine background noise. The test signal can be applied continuously without<br>
interfering with the normal engine knock detection operation.<br>
[0047] The above-described steps are meant to be illustrative examples;<br>
the steps may be performed sequentially, synchronously, simultaneously,<br>
continuously, or in a different order depending upon the application.<br>
[0048] The disclosed embodiments herein provide a knock sensor<br>
diagnostic system that provides open circuit detection and is robust with respect to<br>
sensor variation for short circuit detection. The embodiments allows for up-<br>
integration of a variable gain amplifier into processors.<br>
[0049] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be implemented in<br>
a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been described in connection<br>
with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the invention should not be so<br>
limited since other modifications will become apparent to the skilled practitioner upon<br>
a study of the drawings, specification, and the following claims.<br><br>
