				<td>TWO-COMPONENT POLYURETHANE COMPOSITIONS THAT ARE<br>
ESPECIALLY SUITABLE FOR USE AS STRUCTURAL ADHESIVES<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to the field of two-component<br>
po1yurethane compositions, more particularly of<br>
structural two-component polyurethano adhesives.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Two-component polyurcthane adhesives based on polyols<br>
and poly isocyanates have already been known for a long<br>
time. Two-component polyurethane adhesives have the<br>
advantage that, after mixing, they cure rapidly and so<br>
are able to accommodate relatively high forces rapidly<br>
after just a short time. For use as structural<br>
adhesives, however, exacting requirements in respect of<br>
strengths and adhesive forces are imposed on such<br>
adhesives, since adhesives of this kind constitute<br>
elements of load-bearing structures. High strengths are<br>
typically achieved through high degrees of<br>
crosslinking . This is typically achieved through the<br>
use of relatively highly polyfunctional polyols or<br>
polyamlnes and relatively highly polyfunctional<br>
po1yisocyanates.<br>
Thus, for example, EP 1 253 159 Al discloses in the<br>
examples a structural adhesive whose po1yo1 component<br>
comprises a mixture of a tetra functional aliphatic<br>
polyol and a difunctional aliphatic polyol and whose<br>
isocyanate component is a prepolymer based on<br>
polypropylene glycol and 4,4'-diphenylmethane<br>
diisocyanate .<br>
A high level of use of the highly polyfunctional.<br>
reactants, however, has the effect of a massive<br>
decrease in the extension, with the result that stress<br><br>
peaks occur under load, and adhesives of this kind<br>
become brittle .<br>
There is therefore a desire for rapid adhesives which<br>
exhibit hiqh strengths and nevertheless a high<br>
elasticity.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention, therefore, to<br>
provide a two-component polyurethane composition, more<br>
particularly a structural two-component polyurethane<br>
adhesive, which features high strength with high<br>
extension. This is made possible through the two-<br>
component polyurethane composition of claim 1 .<br>
The addition of an alkoxylated aromatic diol to an<br>
aliphatic triol in the polyol component surprisingly<br>
increases the extension but without lowering the<br>
strength.<br>
The improved extension leads to improved Impact,<br>
toughness of the cured material. In addition it has<br>
been found that the composition of the invention, as a<br>
result in particular of the use of an alkoxylated<br>
aromatic diol, has improved adhesion to metallic<br>
surfaces. Finally it has been observed that the<br>
composi ti.ons of the invention are distinguished by<br>
outstanding aging stability, more particu1ar1y with<br>
respect to moisture find temperature fluctuation.<br>
Embodiments of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a two-component<br>
polyurethane composition composed of a polyol component<br>
K1 and a poly isocyanate component K2. This polyol<br>
component K1 comprises at least one alkoxylated<br>
aromatic diol A1 and at least one aliphatic triol A2.<br>
The po.l y.i socyana l.e component. K2 comprises at least, one<br><br>
polyisocyanatc B1.<br>
The prefix "poly" in designations- such as "polyol",<br>
"po 1 y i socyanatc", "polyether" or "polyamine" indicates<br>
in the present document that the substance in question<br>
contains, formally, more than one of the functional<br>
groups occurring in its name, per molecule.<br>
An "aromatic diol" here and below is a diol which<br>
contains at least one aromatic nucleus and two hydroxy<br>
groups. In the diol there may also be two or more<br>
aromatic nuclei present. Preferably the hydroxhyl	, groups<br>
are not phenolic groups, i.e., they are advantageously<br>
not located directly on the aromatic nucleus.<br>
The aromatic nucleus may also be fused and/or<br>
heteroaromatic and/or a nucleus containing further<br>
s ubsfituents. In a heteroaromatic nuc1eus there are<br>
heteroatoms present which are part of the aromatic ring<br>
or r i rig system.<br>
Examples of aromatic nuclei of this kind are<br>
substituted benzene, naphthalene, anthracene,<br>
phenanthrene, imidazole, pyridine, pyrrole, pyrimidine,<br>
pyrazine, quinoline and phenazine. Examples of di.ois<br>
having two or more aromatic nuclei are diols having the<br>
parent structure of a bi phenyl,' terphenyl, 2,2.'-<br>
bipyridine, d i phony 1 methane, 1 , 1-dipheny 1 ethane or 2.,2.-<br>
dipheny1 propane.<br>
Aromatic diols which have shown themselves to be<br>
particularly suitable are those prepared from phenol<br>
and from formaldehyde, acefaldehyde or acetone or<br>
mixtures thereof, more particularly bisphenol A,<br>
bisphenol F or bisphenol A/F.<br>
Preferably the alkoxylated aromatic diol A1 is an<br>
ethoxylated and/or propoxylated aromatic diol..<br><br>
Al koxylated diols of this kind preferably have the<br>
structure of the formula (I)<br><br>
In this formula the substituent R1 is a group CH2,<br>
(CH(CH3) or C(CH3)2-<br>
The indices n, n' , m and m' are values such that<br>
n+n'+m+m' 1 to 20, more particularly n+n'+m+m' 1 to<br>
8.<br>
Furthermore, the substituents R2 and R3 are each such<br>
that R2 II and R3 - methyl or R2 methyl and R3	II.<br>
The segments a1 and a1' denote an oxypropylene unit (PO)<br>
and a2 and a2' an oxyethylene unit (EO) . The dashed<br>
lines in formula (1) represent the fact, schematically,<br>
that the sequence of the mutually attached alkylene<br>
glycol segments a , a1 , a2 and a2 is variable. tor<br>
instance, a blockwise or alternating or random sequence<br>
of these oxyalkylene units is possible. Alkoxylated<br>
aromatic diols of this kind are prepared in a manner<br>
which is known to the skilled worker.<br>
It is clear to the ski1led worker, furthermore, that in<br>
the a1koxylation of a diol it is also entirely possible<br>
for molecules to be formed which have different, degrees<br>
of alkoxylation in the two chains. It is also clear to<br>
the skilled worker, moreover, that in the case of<br>
alkoxylafions there are always distributions of<br>
different molecules. This is reflected in the fact,<br>
inter alia, that the total degree of alkoxylation<br>
(" TAG" - n+n' +m+m') may also be odd-numbered or adopt a<br><br>
non-integral va1ue.<br>
Purely propoxy la ted aromatic dlols of: the formula (I)<br>
are preferred over purely ethoxylated or mixed EO/PO-<br>
alkoxylated aromatic dlols of the formula (L), i.e., n<br>
is preferably - n' = 0.<br>
With particular preference the aromatic diol Al is a<br>
diol of the formula (1) with R1 = CH2 or C(CH3)2H, more<br>
particularty C(CH3)2 -<br>
Aromatic diols Al which have shown themselves to be<br>
most preferable are those of the formula (1) where R1<br>
C(CH3)2, n-n'=0, and having a total degree of<br>
alkoxylation of between 2 and 16.<br>
It can be advantageous for the two-component<br>
polyurethane composition also to contain mixtures of<br>
different aromatic diols Al.<br>
The aromatic diol Al is used preferably in an amount of<br>
2% to 10% by weight, based on the overall composition.<br>
The aliphatic trio! A2 is an aliphatic triol having a<br>
molecular weight of 360 to 6000 g/mol, corresponding to<br>
an OH equivalent weight of 120 to 2000, in particular a<br>
molecular weight of 120 to 2000 g/mol, preferably of<br>
160 to 17 00 g/mol.<br>
There are different kinds of such aliphatic triols.<br>
Thus, for example, they may contain urethane and/or<br>
urea and/or ether groups. The morphology of the triols<br>
may be very different. Thus, for example, star-shaped<br>
or comb-shaped triols are possible. It is additionally<br>
possible for the triol to contain not only primary but<br>
also secondary hydroxyl groups. Preferably all three<br>
hydroxyl groups are primary hydroxyl groups.<br>
Aliphatic triols A2 can be attained, for example, from<br><br>
an aliphatic triisocyanatc, more particularly from an<br>
isocyanurate, which is formed from three isocyanate<br>
molecules, in an excess of aliphatic diols, more<br>
particularly of polyetherdiols, where appropriate by<br>
further subsequent extension by means of aliphatic<br>
diisocyanates and allpiiatic diols.<br>
Further exemplary aliphatic tri.ols A2 may be obtained<br>
from low molecular weight aliphatic triols, such as<br>
trimethylolpropane or glycerol, for example, and an<br>
aliphatic diisocyanate, with subsequent reaction with<br>
an aliphaticdiol .<br>
Further exemplary aliphatic triols A2 are products of<br>
an alkoxylation reaction of low molecular weight<br>
aliphatic triols, such as trimethylolpropane or<br>
glycerol, for example. In particular these are<br>
ethoxylated, or propoxyiated or bufoxylated, aliphatic<br>
triols, more particularly those of trimethylolpropane<br>
or glycerol.<br>
1t may be advantageous for the two-component<br>
polyurethane composition also to contain mixtures of<br>
different aliphatic triols A2 . In particular it has<br>
been found advantageous to use mixtures of an aliphatic<br>
triol A2 having a relatively low molecular weight, more<br>
particularly between 360 and 2700 g/mol, with an<br>
aliphatic triol A2 having a higher molecular weight,<br>
more particularly between 4200 and 6000 g/mol.<br>
If only one aliphatic triol A2 is used, it is<br>
advantageous to choose one having a medium molecular<br>
weight, more particularly between 2000 and 1000 g/mol.<br>
The weight, ratio A1/A2 of aromatic diol Al to aliphatic<br>
triol A2 is preferably between 0.0b and 0.3.<br>
The pol.yol component K1 may further comprise other<br>
constituents. It is advantageous to use curing<br><br>
catalysts. Catalysts of this kind are known to the<br>
skilled worker tor the reaction of polyisocyanates with<br>
polyols, and where appropriate also for reaction with<br>
polyamines or water. Examples that may be mentioned of<br>
such catalysts include organometailic catalysts of tin,<br>
zinc and bismuth, such as dibutyl tin dilaurato, or<br>
tertiary amines, such as 1,4-diazobicyclo [2..2.2]octane<br>
(DABCO) , for examp1e.<br>
As additional constituents it is also possible for<br>
there to be diols, more particularly polyoxyalkylene-<br>
diols, and/or diamines. Suitable amines include, in<br>
particular, aliphatic, araliphatic, cycloaliphatic and<br>
toxicologically unobjectionable aromatic amines.<br>
Through the selection and concentration of suitable<br>
amines and also catalysts it is possible to exert an<br>
advantageous influence over the pot life, cure behavior<br>
and slip behavior.<br>
The polyisocyanate component K2 comprises at least one<br>
polyisocyanate B1.<br>
Particularly suitable as polyisocyanate B1 are, on the<br>
one hand, polyisocyanates B1' which in addition to two<br>
or more free isocyanate groups contain at least one<br>
urea or urethane or biuret or urethdione group .<br>
Particularly suitable are polyisocyanates based on<br>
aromatic polyisocyanates, more particularly on<br>
diphenylmethane diisocyanate (2,4'- and/or 4,4'-MDI).<br>
On the one hand, polyisocyanates of the type as<br>
available commercially in the form of DesniodurR VII 20<br>
from Bayer have been found particularly suitable,<br>
further suitable polyisocyanates B1 arc isocyanurates<br>
or biurets of a diisocyanate, more particularly of HD1<br>
and/or IPDI and/or TDI .<br>
If is entirely possible to use mixtures of<br>
polyisocyanates B1'. One preferred embodiment, employs a<br>
polyisocyanate B1' mixture of the Desmodur® VH 20 type<br><br>
with an HD1 i socyanurate .<br>
Particularly suitable as po1ylsocyanate B1 on the other<br>
hand are polyurethane prepolymers B1" which contain at<br>
least two isocyanate groups and which are formed from a<br>
reaction of at Least one polyisocyanate having a<br>
molecular weight of less than 300 g/mol, more<br>
particularly of between 150 g/mol and 270 g/mol, with<br>
at Least one polyol AB1. Particularly suitable as<br>
polyol AB1 are polyols which are selected from the<br>
group encompassing polyetherpolyols, polyestcrpolyols,<br>
polycarbonatepolyols, polyols formed from unsaturated<br>
monomers and mixtures thereof. The preparation of<br>
isocyanate-group-containing polyurethane prepolymers of<br>
this kind is accomplished in a known way and typically<br>
takes place in a stolchiometric excess of the<br>
polyisocyanate over the polyol. Polyisocyanates used<br>
for this purpose include, in particular, 2,1- and 2,6-<br>
tolylene diisocyanate (TDI), 2,4'- and 4,4'-diphenyl-<br>
methane diisocyanate (MDT), 1,6-hexamethy.l ene diiso-<br>
cyanate (HDI) and the isomer mixtures thereof, and<br>
mixtures with one another. MD1 is particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
Polyetherpolyols, also called polyoxyalkyl enepo'l yols,<br>
are polymerization products of ethylene oxide, 1,2-<br>
propy.l one oxide, 1,2- or 2,3-butylene oxide,<br>
tetrahydrofuran or mixtures thereof; where appropriate<br>
they are polymerized with the aid of a starter molecule<br>
having two or more active hydrogen atoms, such as<br>
water, ammonia, or compounds having two or more OH or<br>
NH groups, for example, such as 1, 2-ethanedi ol , 1,2-<br>
and 1 , 3-propanediol, neopentyl glycol, diethylene<br>
glycol, triethyl ene glycol, the isomeric dipropylene<br>
glycols and tripropylene glycols, the isomeric<br>
butanedio1s, pentanediols, hexanediols, heptanediols,<br>
octanediols, nonanediols, decanedlols, undecanediols,<br>
1,3- and 1 , 4-cyclohexanedimetLianol , bisphenol A,<br>
hydrogenated blsphenol A, 1, 1, 1-trimethylolethane,<br><br>
1,1,1-trimethylol propane, glycerol, aninino, and<br>
mixtures of the aforementioned compounds. It is<br>
possible to use not only polyoxyalkyienepolyols which<br>
have a low degree of unsaturation (measured in<br>
accordance with ASTM D-2819-69 and reported in<br>
millioquivatonls of unsaturation per gram of polyol<br>
(moq/g)), prepared for example by means of double metal<br>
cyanide complex catalysts (DMC catalysts), but also<br>
polyoxyalkylenepolyols having a higher degree of<br>
unsaturation, prepared for example by means of anionic<br>
catalysts such as NaOH, KOH or alkali metal alkoxides.<br>
Particu1ar1y suitable are polyoxya1kylenedio1s or<br>
polyoxyalkylcnetriols, more particularly polyoxy-<br>
propy] enediols or polyoxypropy]enetriols.<br>
Acclaim types of specific suitability are<br>
polyoxyalkylenediols or polyoxyalkylenetriols having a<br>
degree of unsaturation of less than 0.02. meq/g and<br>
having a molecular weight in the range from 1000 to<br>
30 000 g/mol, and also polyoxypropylenedio1s and<br>
-triols having a molecular weight of 400 to 8000 g/mol.<br>
By "molecular weight" or "molar weight" is meant, in<br>
the present document, always the molecular weight<br>
average Mn .<br>
Likewise particularly suitable are what are called EO-<br>
endcapped" (othy 1 ene ox.i de-endcapped) polyoxypropy lene-<br>
diols or triols. The latter are special polyoxy-<br>
propylene-polyoxyethyl enepolyols, obtained for example<br>
by alkoxylating pure polyoxypropylenepo1yols with<br>
ethylene oxide after the end of the polypropoxy1ation,<br>
and which as a result have primary hydroxyl groups.<br>
Polyesterpolyols are, in particular, polyols which are<br>
formed for example from dihydric and/or trihydric<br>
alcohols such as, for example, 1, 2-ethanediol,<br>
diethylene glycol, 1 , 2-propanediol , dipropyl ene glycol,<br>
1 , 4-butanediol., 1, 5-pentanediol, 1, 6-hexanodiol ,<br><br>
neopentylglycol , glycerol , 1,1,1-trimethylolpropane or<br>
mixtures of the aforementioned alcohols with organic<br>
dicarboxyl ic acids or their anhydrides or esters, such<br>
as, for examp1e, succinic acid, g1utaric acid, adipic<br>
acid, suberic acid, sebacic acid, dodecanedicarboxylic<br>
acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, phthalic acid,<br>
isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid and hexa-<br>
hydrophtha1ic acid or mixtures of the aforementioned<br>
acids, and also polyesterpolyols formed from lactones,<br>
such as E-capro1 actone, for example.<br>
Particularly preferred polycarbonatepolyo1s are those<br>
obtainable by reacting the abovementioned alcohols<br>
those used to synthesize the polyesterpolyols with<br>
dialkyl carbonates, diaryl carbonates or phosgene.<br>
By "polyols formed from unsaturated monomers" are<br>
meant, in particular, polyols of the kind formed from<br>
the polymerization of at least one of the monomers<br>
selected from the group encompassing ethylene,<br>
propylene, butyl one, butadiene, isoprene, styrene,<br>
vinyl alcohol, vinyl ethers, vinyl esters,<br>
acrylonitrile, acids, amides and esters of acrylic<br>
acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid,<br>
crotonic acid and itaconic acid and also mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
Particularly suitable polyols formed from unsaturated<br>
monomers are hydroxy-functional polybutadienes such as<br>
pol ybu tadi enepol yo 1 s and hydrogenated polybutadiene-<br>
polyols, and also po1y(meth)acrylalepolyo1s. By<br>
" (meth)acrylate" is meant, here and in the remainder of<br>
Lhe present document;, esters of both acrylic acid and<br>
of methacrylic acid. Similarly, "(meth) acrylic acid"<br>
identifies not only acrylic acid but also methacrylic<br>
acid .<br>
"Poly(meth)acrylatepolyols" here are polymers which are<br>
copolymers of a hydroxy-functional (meth)acrylic ester<br><br>
and at least one further monomer selected from the<br>
qroup encompassing the monomers acrylic acid,<br>
methacrylic acid, C1-C18 alkyl esters of acrylic acid or<br>
methacrylic acid, styrcne, vinyl esters and vinyl<br>
alcoho1. Preferred hydroxy- functional (me th )acrylic<br>
csters are hydroxyethy 1 (meth) acrylate, hydroxypropy-L<br>
(meth)acrylate and hydroxybutyl (meth)acrylate.<br>
These stated polyols ABl preferably have an average<br>
molecular weight of 250 to 30 000 g/mol , more<br>
particularly of 1000 to 8000 g/mol, and are preferably<br>
diols or triols, more particularly having an average OH<br>
functionality in the range from 1.6 to 3.<br>
One preferred embodiment uses a mixture of polyols AB1<br>
which is a mixture of diols and triols.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the polylsocyanate<br>
component K2 comprises at least one polylsocyanate B1'<br>
and at least, one polylsocyanate polyurethane prepolymer<br>
Bl".<br>
Both components K1 and K2, may contain additional<br>
constituents in addition to those already mentioned, of<br>
the kind the skilled worker knows from two-component<br>
polyurethane chemistry. These constituents may be<br>
present in only one component or in both. Examples of<br>
additional constituents of this kind that are used<br>
include solvents, plasticizers and/or extenders,<br>
fillers, such as carbon blacks, chalks or taics,<br>
adhesion promoters, more particularly trialkoxysilanes,<br>
and thixotropic agents, such as amorphous silicas, and<br>
zeolites.<br>
As the skilled polyurethane adhesives worker knows, if<br>
is necessary to ensure, when preparing the components,<br>
particularly in the case of the polylsocyanate<br>
component K2, that the raw materials are very largely<br>
free from water and that, during and followinq their<br><br>
preparation, it is virtually impxxssibio for any<br>
molsture to come into contact with the component. This<br>
is achieved on the one hand by physical or chemical<br>
drylng of the starting substances, and also by<br>
opjerating under inert gas, typxically nitrogen.<br>
The components K1 and K2 are advantageously formulated<br>
such that the volume ratio of component. Kl to component<br>
K2 is between 1:3 and 3:1, more particularly between<br>
1:2 and 2:1. With particular preference this ratio is<br>
approximately 1:1. The mixing ratio is preferably such<br>
that the NCO groups of conrponent K2 are stolchiometric<br>
in relation to the NCO-reactive group)s, typylcal ly Oil<br>
groups, of component Kl. If mixing is carried out not<br>
with substantial stolchiometry, i.e., with deviations<br>
of more than 5%, the reaction of components K1 and K2<br>
is non-optimal, leading to a reduction in the<br>

compos i t i on. This is true in particular for an excess<br>
of the polyoJ. component. In the case of an excess of<br>
polylsocyanafe, the situation is likewise fundamentally<br>
disadvantageous, but the impaired mechanical properties<br>
can be at least partly remedied by the subsequent<br>
reaction of the un reacted isocyanafe group) s with<br>
molsture, o r 1 q 1 n a t. i n g f o r e x amp) 1 e f r om f h e a 1 m o s p) h o r i c<br>
molsture, which may if appropriate lead to further<br>
crosslinks.<br>
Prior to application, the components K1 and K2 are<br>
stored .separately from one another and are mixed with<br>
one another only during or immediately prior to<br>
application. The components are advantageously present<br>
in a pack which is composed of two separate chambers,<br>
with the polyol component Kl present in one chamber and<br>
the polylsocyanate component K2 present in the other<br>
chamber. The components K1 and K2 are introduced into<br>
the chambers of the pack and given an airtight and<br>
mo i s1u re-1 i gh t seal.<br><br>
Preferred packages of this kind are, on the one hand,<br>
side-by-si.de double cartridges or coaxial cartridges,<br>
in which two tubular chambers are arranged alongside<br>
one another or inside one another and are sealed with<br>
pistons in an airtight and molsture-tight way. The<br>
driving of these pistons allows the components to be<br>
extruded from the cartridge. The ends of the tubes<br>
opposite the pistons are modified in such a way, via an<br>
adapter where appropriate, that the chamber openings in<br>
the region of the opening are connected directly to one<br>
another via a dividing wall. Advantageously there is a<br>
thread made in the region of the exit opening of the<br>
chambers, so that a static mixer or dynamic mixer can<br>
be mounted closely. Packages of this kind are preferred<br>
in particular for small-scale applications, in<br>
particular for volumes of up to 1 liter.<br>
For larger applications, particularly for applications<br>
in industrial manufacture, the components K1 and K2 are<br>
advantageously dispensed and stored in drums or pails,<br>
in this case the components are extruded via hydraulic<br>
presses, in particular by way of follower plates, and<br>
are supplied via pipelines to a mixing apparatus of the<br>
kind typically used for two-component adhesives in<br>
i.ndu s t r i a1 manu f actu re.<br>
With any package it is important that the<br>
po1ylsocyanate component K2 at least. be given an<br>
airtight and molsture-tight seal, so that. both<br>
components can be stored for a long time, i.e.,<br>
typically longer than 6 months.<br>
The method of adhesive bonding comprises the following<br>
steps:<br>
mixing the above-described components K1 and K2,<br>
applylng the mixed po'l yuref hane composition to at<br>
least one substrate surface to be bonded,<br>
carrylng out jolning within the open time,<br>
curing the polyurethane composition.<br><br>
Mixing is accomp.li.shod typically via static mixers or<br>
with the aid of dynamic mixers. At the mixing stage it<br>
is important to ensure that the two components are<br>
mixed as homogeneously as possible. If the two<br>
components are poorly mixed, there are local deviations<br>
from the optimum mixing ratio i.e., substantially<br>
stolchiometric - and this has the consequence of an<br>
impairment in the mechanical properties of the cured<br>
potyurethane composition. in order to assess the<br>
quality of mixing from a visual standpolnt as well it<br>
is advantageous if the two components K1 and K2 have<br>
two different colors, which can be distinguished well<br>
visually from one another and also from the mixture. An<br>
example of a color combination of this kind is present<br>
when one component is black and the other is white, in<br>
that case, effective mixing is present when there is a<br>
homogeneous gray color and there are no streaks or<br>
patterns in light or dark gray or in white or black.<br>
The mixed potyurethane composition 'is applied to at<br>
least one substrate surface to be bonded. The substrate<br>
to be bonded is preferably a metal, plastic, glass or<br>
ceramic. Typically there are two substrates present and<br>
intended for bonding. It is possible for the partner<br>
adherend, i.e., the second substrate, to be identical<br>
to or di f f erenf f rom the f i rs f subs 1, ra t.c . Adhos i ve ma y<br>
be applied to the first and/or second adherend.<br>
following application of adhesive, the adherends are<br>
jolned within the open time. Subsequent to jolning, the<br>
potyurethane composition is cured.<br>
This produces an assembly of the adherends, the<br>
adhesive positively connecting these adherends to one<br>
another.<br>
The polyurethano composition is preferably employed as<br>
a structural adhesive. Typi. cal examples of applications<br>
for such adhcsi.ves are found in built structures,<br><br>
automobiles, vehicles or boats. In these cases the<br>

t h e r e f o r e c o n s t i t u t e s a n i mp o r t a n t c o n n e c t i n g clem e n t,<br>
whose mechanical properties arc subject to exacting<br>
requirements. The present invention meets these<br>
exacting requirements very well, indeed.<br>
Moreover, as a result	of the high extension, the<br>
adhesive composition of	the invention exhibits high<br>
impact toughness and	also an outstanding aging<br>
stabi l.ity, particularly	with respect to molsture and<br>
temperature fluctuation.	Additionally it has been found<br>
that the composition of	the invention, particularly as<br>
a result o f; the use of	an alkoxylated aromatic diol,<br>
has an improved adhesion	to metallic surfaces.<br>
Examples<br>
Preparation<br>
The compositions Exl and Ex2 and also Ref.l as<br>
reference example, set out by way of example in table<br>
1, aJ1 have the same component K2 .<br>
For the production of components Kl, ExAl and ExA2, and<br>
also of the reference component RefA.l, the po.lyol<br>
mixture was charged to a vacuum dissolver and,<br>
fo.l lowing the addition of catalyst and drylng agent,<br>
and in the absence of molsture, the mixture was stirred<br>
at. 25 °C for 2 0 minutes. These polyo.l components Kl were<br>
subsequent]y dispensed into one chamber of a sido-by-<br>
side double cartridge (vol/vol - 1:1) made of:<br>
polypropylene, and were given an airtight and molsture-<br>
fight seal with plastic pistons.<br>
For component K2, dried chalk was added to the<br>
polylsocyanate and incorporated homogeneously in a<br>
vacuum dissolver, with stirring and under reduced<br>
pressure, at 25°C for 20 minutes. Subsequently this<br>
polylsocyanate component K2 was dispensed into the<br><br>
second chamber of the abovementioned side-by-side<br>
double cartridge, and was likewise provided with an<br>
airtight and molsture-tight seal using a plastic<br>
piston.<br>
Components K1 and K2 were mixed 1:1 votumetrical1y by<br>
means of a static mixer, in the quantities indicated in<br>
tab1e 1 .<br>
Measurements<br>
The mixed components K1 and K2 were introduced into<br>
dumbbell molds in accordance with ISO 527, Part 2, 1B<br>
and were cured at 25°C for 2 4 h and then at 105°C for<br>
3 h. following a conditioning time of 24 h at 25°C,<br>
elasticity modulus, tensi1e strength and elongation of<br>
the specimens thus produced were measured in accordance<br>
with ISO 527 on a ½wick 7,020 tensile testing machine,<br>
with a test temperature of 20°C and a test speed of<br>
50 mm/min.<br><br><br><br>
From the results it. is evident that examples Ex1 and<br>
Ex2 have not only a higher tensile strength but also<br>
higher breaking elongation as compared with Ref.1.<br><br>
