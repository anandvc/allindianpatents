				<td>LOW TEMPERATURE LIQUID POLYTfflOETHER POLYMERS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[001]   This invention is directed to polythioether polymers, curable compositions of polythioether polymers, processes for producing polythioether polymers, and the use of polythioether polymers in sealants, wherein the polythioether polymers and curable compositions are liquid at a temperature of 20°C or less.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
[002]   Polythioether polymers are widely used in aviation and aerospace sealants primarily due to their excellent fuel-resistance. In addition to resistance to aviation fuels, polymers useful hi aviation and aerospace sealants desirably exhibit the properties of low temperature flexibility, room temperature liquidity, and high temperature resistance. It is also desirable that the process used to synthesize the polythioether polymers be low cost, and free of malodorous and acidic byproducts. Developments in polythioether polymer chemistry have led to polymers exhibiting properties suitable for aviation and aerospace applications. For example, polythioether polymers formed by the free radical catalyzed addition reaction of vinyl ethers and polythiols as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,172,179, U.S. Patent No. 5,959,071, and U.S. Patent No. 5,912,319 are liquid at room temperature, exhibit excellent low-temperature flexibility and fuel resistance, and the synthesis does not generate undesirable cyclic or acidic byproducts.<br>
[003]   It is further desirable that polythioether polymers used in aviation and aerospace sealants remain liquid at low temperatures potentially encountered, for example, during transportation and storage. Specifically, it is desirable that the<br><br>
polythioether polymers remain liquid at a temperature of 20°C (68°F), and more preferably at a temperature of 4°C (39°F), for an extended period of time.<br>
[004]   In polythioether polymer systems it is known that the introduction of non-linearity into the polymer backbone, such as by incorporating pendent groups, reduces the glass transition temperature of the polymer and enhances the ability of the polymers to remain liquid at low temperatures. U.S. Patent No. 4,366,307 discloses<br><br>
the Incorporation of pendent alkyl side chains to provide liquid polythioether polymers with a glass transition temperature less than -50°C. U.S. Patent No. 5,959,071 discloses incorporating pendent methyl groups into polythioether polymers to produce fuel resistant polymers that are liquid at low temperatures and that exhibit a glass transition temperature less than -50°C.<br>
[005]   Polythioether polymers formed by the two-step addition reaction of polythiol, polyepoxide, and polyvinyl ether are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,486,297. In a first step, a polythiol is reacted with either a polyepoxide or a polyvinyl ether to form a prepolymer. hi a second step, the prepolymer and un-reacted polythiol is reacted with the component not participating in the first reaction step. The polyepoxide reaction introduces pendent hydroxyl groups along the backbone of the polythioether polymer and thereby increases the non-linearity in the polymer backbone. Polythioether polymers produced using polyepoxides as disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,486,297 exhibit a glass transition temperature less than -40°C. However, because the polyepoxide reaction favors polymer chain extension during the reaction, the resulting polythioether polymers are characterized by a high molecular weight and exhibit commensurate high viscosities on the order of 400 poise at room temperature. For use of polythioether polymers in curable sealant<br><br>
compositions, it is desirable that the polymer viscosity be on the order of 100 poise or less at room temperature.<br>
[006]   To overcome the disadvantages inherent in polythioether polymers synthesized using polyepoxides while maintaining the properties advantageous for aviation and aerospace sealant applications, a three-step method using monoepoxides for the synthesis of polythioether polymers and sealants made therefrom, are herein disclosed.<br>
[007]   Use of thiol addition chemistry in a three-step reaction process enables control of the polymer structure leading to polythioether polymers that exhibit low-temperature liquidity, as well as other properties desirable for aviation and aerospace sealant applications.<br>
[008]   In a first reaction step, a polythiol can be reacted with a monoepoxide having an epoxy group and a second group, other than an epoxy group, that is reactive with a thiol group, such that the reaction takes place preferentially at the second group, to form a first prepolymer. In the first step, a thiol group adds across the double bonds of the second, non-epoxy, group to form the first prepolymer. The first prepolymer can be the 1:1 addition product of a polythiol and a monoepoxide, and comprises an epoxy group and a thiol group. Following the first reaction step, the reaction mixture comprises the first prepolymer and un-reacted polythiols.<br>
[009]   The second reaction step comprises the ring opening of the epoxy groups by un-reacted thiol groups, typically in the presence of a catalyst, to form a second prepolymer. In the second reaction step, thiol groups on both the first prepolymer and un-reacted polythiols participate in the ring opening of the epoxy groups to form the second prepolymer. After the completion of the second reaction step, the reaction mixture comprises the second prepolymer and un-reacted starting<br><br>
polythiols. The second prepolymer is a polythiol having a higher molecular weight than the starting polythiols.<br>
[010]   The third reaction step comprises the free radical-catalyzed addition of the thiol groups of both the second prepolymer and remaining un-reacted starting polythiols across the double bonds of a polyunsaturated compound such as a divinyl compound.<br>
[Oil]   The three-step synthesis enables control of the molecular weight, polymer structure, and the equivalent weight, to produce polythioether polymers with consistent chemical and physical properties, and existing as a liquid at a temperature of 20°C or less and that are useful for aviation and aerospace sealant applications. The controlled introduction of polar hydroxyl groups into the backbone of the polythioether polymer, by increasing the overall polarity of the polymer without undesirable chain extension, enhances the compatibility of the polythioether polymer with additives used in the formulation of useful sealant compositions, and also enhances the adhesion properties of the polythioether polymer to surfaces.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

[029]   In certain embodiments, the polythioether polymers of Formulae I, I(a), in (infra), and HI(a) (infra) have a molecular weight between 2,000 and 5,000 Daltons. In other embodiments, polythioether polymers of Formulae I, I(a), HI, and H[(a) have a molecular weight between 3,000 and 4,000 Daltons. hi certain embodiments, the weight ratio of constituent A having the structure of Formula II(a) to A having the structure of Formula n(b) in the polythioether polymer is from 2:1 to 3:1.<br>
[030]   In certain embodiments, polythioether polymers of Formula I have a glass transition temperature, Tg, of -60°C (-76°F) or less.<br>
[031]   hi certain embodiments, polythioether polymers of the invention are liquid at a temperature of 20°C (68°F) or less, hi certain embodiments, polythioether polymers of the invention are liquid at a temperature of at least 4°C (40°F) or less and hi other embodiments, are liquid at a temperature of at least 4°C (40°F) or less for at least one month. Typically, polythioether polymers of the invention exhibit a viscosity ranging from 75 poise to 150 poise at a temperature of 20°C and a viscosity ranging from 300 poise to 380 poise at a temperature of 4°C. hi comparison, polythioether polymers formed using diepoxides such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br><br>
6,486,297 exhibit a viscosity ranging from 400 poise to 450 poise at a temperature of 20°C and are solid at a temperature of 4°C.<br>
[032]   In certain embodiments, compounds of the invention include polythioether polymers of the Formula III:<br>
B-{- S - A - [- (CH2)2 - R2 - (CH2)2 - S - A -]» -}Z	<br><br>
and more particularly<br>
B-{- S - A - [- (CH2)2 - R2 - (CH2)2 - S - A -]„- R6 }Z m(a)<br>
wherein<br>
A, R2, R6, and n are as described above,<br>
B is a z-vaient group derived from a polyfunctionalizing agent,<br>
z is an integer from 3 to 6,<br>
n is an integer selected to yield a molecular weight for the polythioether polymer of between 500 and 20,000 Daltons, and<br>
the weight ratio of H(a) to n(b) is from about 2:1 to 3:1. [033]   B is a z-valent group and is derived from a compound, B1, that represents a polyfunctionalizing agent. A polyfunctionalizing agent refers to a compound having more than two moieties that are reactive with -SH and/or — CH=CH2 groups. In certain embodiments, the polyfunctionalizing agent comprises from 3 to 6 such moieties, and B is denoted as a "z-valent" group, where z is the<br><br>
number of such moieties included in the agent, and hence the number of separate branches comprising the polvfunctional polythioether polymer.<br>
[034]   In certain embodiments of a compound of Formulae III andIIIi(a), the polyfunctionalizing agent is a trifunctionalizing agent wherein z = 3. In certain embodiments of a compound of Formulae III and III[(a)} the functional groups of the polyfunctionalizing agent are selected from vinyl groups and thiol groups. Polyfunctionalizing agents having mixed functionality, i.e., polyfunctionalizing agents that include moieties, which typically are separate moieties, that react with both thiol and vinyl groups can also be used. In certain embodiments, the polyfunctionalizing agent comprises trimethylolpropane trivinylether, and the polythiols described in U.S. Patent No. 4,366,307, U.S. Patent No. 4,609,762, and U.S. Patent No. 5,225,472. In certain embodiments, the trifunctionalizing agent is selected from triallylcyanurate (TAG), which is reactive with thiol groups, and 1,2,3-propanetrithiol, which is reactive with vinyl groups. In certain embodiments of a polythioether polymer having the structure of Formulae III and III(a), the polyfunctionalizing agent is derived from triallylisocyanurate, triallylcyanurate, or combinations thereof.<br>
[035]   Polyfunctionalizing agents having more than three reactive moieties, i.e. z &gt; 3, afford "star" polymers and hyper-branched polymers. For example, two moles of TAG can be reacted with one mole of a dithiol to produce a polyfunctionalizing agent having an average functionality of 4. This polyfunctionalizing agent can then be reacted with a polyvinyl compound and a dithiol to yield a prepolymer, which in turn can be reacted with a trifunctionalizing agent to afford a polythioether polymer blend having an average functionality between 3 and 4.<br><br>
[03 6]   Mixtures of polyfunctionalizing agents comprising a range of functionalities may also be used in the preparation of polythioether polymers having the structure of FormulaeIII and III (a). In certain embodiments, the use of certain amounts of trifunctionalizing agents affords polythioether polymers having average functionalities from 2.05 to 3.0. Other average functionalities can be achieved by using tetrafunctional polyfunctionalizing agents, or polyfunotionalizing agents with higher valencies. The average functionality of the resulting polythioether polymer will also be affected by factors such as stoichiometry, as is known to those skilled in the art.<br>
[037]   In accordance with certain embodiments of the invention, polythioether polymers of the invention are used to form curable compositions. Curable compositions of the invention comprise 30% by weight to 80% by weight of a polythioether polymer comprising at least one polythioether polymer of Formulae I, I(a), III, and III(a); at least one curing agent; and optionally, at least one filler. In certain embodiments, curable compositions of the invention are liquid at a temperature of 20°C (68°F) or less, hi other embodiments, curable compositions of the invention are liquid at a temperature of 4°C (40°F) or less. In still other embodiments, curable compositions of the invention are liquid at a temperature of 4°C (40°F) or less for at least one month.<br>
[03 8]   Curable compositions of the invention include at least one curing agent.

compositions of the invention:<br>
[078]   Peel strength was determined according to Mil-C-27725 and Mil-A-8625. Adhesion test panels are prepared by applying a layer of sealant to a metal substrate such as aluminum, steel, or titanium, applying a screen over the sealant, and applying a top layer of sealant over the screen. After curing, a cut is made between the screen and metal substrate, the screen pulled, and the peel pattern visually characterized. A desirable pattern occurs when part of the sealant adheres to the metal, and part of the sealant adheres to the screen along the cut. This pattern allows the determination of the peel strength expressed as pulling force/percent cohesive failure. Screen failure is defined as occurring when the sealant layer peels from the screen but remains adhered to the metal substrate, thus indicating that the sealant has superior adhesion to the metal surface compared to the screen. Screen failure does not permit a determination of peel strength of the sealant to a metal substrate.<br>

 [096]   The peel strength of the cured sealant comprising Base 3 and different amounts of Accelerator 3 representing a range of epoxy/HS equivalent ratios to produce various epoxy/mercaptan ratios on Mil-C surfaces was evaluated both dry and following immersion in JRF Type 1 for 7 days at 60°C (140°F). The results are provided in Table 7 35<br>
Table 7.  Peel Strength of Sealant Compositions of Base 3 and Different Amounts of Accelerator 3.<br><br>
[097]   As demonstrated by the results presented in Table 5 and Table 1, the adhesion of the cured sealant composition is influenced by the composition of the accelerator as well as by the epoxy/mercaptan ratio.<br>
Example 4<br>
[098]   A 5 liter 4-neck flask was charged with 2356.4 g (12.83 moles) of DMDO followed by 403.56 g (3.5 moles) of AGE while stirring. The mixture was stirred for 1.5 hours. During this period, the reaction temperature increased to 49°C (120°F). A solution of base catalyst (2.9 g in 0.5 ml toluene), l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0] undec-7-ene (DBU) was added to the reaction mixture. The exothermic reaction produced a temperature of 100°C in 0.5 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to 70°C and stirred for an additional 2 hours. A solution of 116.35 g (0.46 mole) of TAG, 1147.28 g (7.25 moles) of DEG-DVE, and 0.2 g of Vazo®67 was added over 2<br><br>
hours at 70°C. The reaction mixture was then stirred at 70°C for an additional 1 hour. Ten portions of Vazo®67 (0.6 g, 0.015% of total charge) were added at one-hour intervals at a temperature of 70°C, to complete the reaction. The mixture was degassed at 70°C / 0.5 mm Hg for 2 hours to provide a liquid polythioether, Polymer 4, of faint yellow color and low odor exhibiting a viscosity of 145 poise. The yield was 4.023 Kg (100%). The polythioether polymer remained liquid for at least 365<br>
t<br>
days at a temperature of 4°C (39°F).<br>
[099]   Further adjustments were made in the compositions of both the bases and accelerators. The compositions of five bases formed using polythioether Polymer 4 are presented in Table Removed<br>
[0100] Base compositions A, B, and C were cured with an accelerator, Accelerator 4A, having the composition presented in Table 9.<br>

 [0101] Following curing for one week at a temperature of 25°C (77°F), the hardness of the sealants formed using base compositions A, B, and C, and Accelerator 4A, was 53-55 Rex.<br>
[0102] Base compositions B, C, and D were cured with an accelerator, Accelerator 4B, having the composition presented in Table 10.<br>
( TableRemoved)<br><br><br>
 [0103] The peel strength (pli/%CF) of the sealants formed using base compositions B, C, and D, and Accelerator 4B, on Mil-C, Alodine®, and titanium surfaces according to Mil-C-27725 and MiI-A-8625 are presented in Table Removed<br>
[0104] Base compositions B and E were also cured with an accelerator, Accelerator 4C, having the composition presented in Table Removed.<br>

 Peel Strength of Sealants Formed Using Base Compositions B and Example 5	'<br>
[0106] In Example 5, a polythioether polymer was synthesized using a diepoxide to compare the performance of sealants comprising polythioether polymers synthesized using diepoxides with sealants comprising polythioether polymers synthesized using monoepoxides.<br>
[0107] A solution of neopentyl glycol diglycidyl ether (162.13g, 0.58 mole), DMDO (483.81 g, 2.64 moles), and triethylamine (0.3 g, 0.003 mole) was heated at 100°C for 16 hours, cooled to room temperature, and charged in a 1 liter 4-neck round bottom flask. TAG (14.38 g, 0.058 mole) and DEG-DVE (264.69 g, 1.67 moles) were added and the reaction mixture was heated to 70°C. Three portions of Vazo®67 (0.3 g, 0.032% of total charge) were added at one-hour Intervals at a temperature of 70°C, to complete the reaction. The reaction mixture was then degassed at 70°C /0.5 mra Hg for 2 hours to provide a liquid polythioether, Polymer 5, of faint yellow color and low odor, exhibiting a viscosity of 87 poise at 25°C. The reaction yield was 925 gm<br>
(100%). The polythioether polymer remained liquid for 35 days at a temperature of 4°C (39°F).<br>
[0108] A base composition, Base 5, having the same constituents as ia Example 1 was formulated using the polythioether formed in Example 5, rather than the monoepoxide polythioether described in Example 1. Base 5 was cured using three different accelerators in an epoxy/HS equivalent ratio of 1:1.05. The compositions of<br>
i<br>
the accelerators used to form sealants using Base 5 are presented in<br>
 Table Removed<br>
[0109] The peel strength (pli/%CF) of the sealants on Mil-C substrates was determined under dry conditions, following immersion in JEJP for 7 days, and following immersion in a solution of 3% NaCl according to Mil-C-27725 and Mil-A-8625 are presented in<br>
 Table Removed<br>
[0110] The dry peel strength for Base 1 cured with Accelerator 1 of Example 1 is included for comparison. Base 1 comprises a polythioether polymer of the invention formed using a monoepoxide and the three-step reaction process of the invention, while Base 5 comprises a polythioether polymer formed using a diepoxide. The cured composition having a polythioether polymer formed using the monoepoxide is shown to exhibit significantly greater dry peel strength (38 pli/100%CF) than thecured composition comprising a polythioether polymer formed using a diepoxide (23 pli/100%CF). The cured compositions formed using a diepoxide are unacceptable for use as aviation and aerospace sealants where it is desired that the peel strength under dry conditions, following immersion in JRF for 7 days, and following immersion in a solution of 3% NaCl according to Mil-C-27725 and Mil-A-8625 greater than 20 pli.<br><br><br><br><br>
