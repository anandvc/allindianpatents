Thii invention rebtes to a retractable<br>
footreit device for a motor cyde.<br>
The   term    "motor    cyde*    in    tiili<br>
ipedncation not onfy meani a motor cyde<br>
ai ii commonly known but induda any<br>
other vehide to which thii invention ta<br>
appUcable.<br>
In a motor cyde a footreit device li provided for the driver and for the pillion rider alio. UiuaOyf the footreit meant for the driver b flied (not foidaUe). On the other hand the footreit device provided for the pillion rider ii uiually foldabk^ lo that it can be folded againit the lide of the vehide when it ii not hi nie. The footreit, whether filed or foMable^ ii provided on both lidei of the vehide.<br>
Conventionally, the fiddable footreit requirei to be unfolded (from iti foMed poiition) by the pillion rider bending<br><br>
down to pun the footreit from ttf fold«d poiitioii and bring it Into iti unfolded portion. Tliiiy the piffion rider doet ^ther with hit handi or with hit foot, the former being the uiual mode adopted for getting a proper grip on the footreit before it ii unfolded. The hitter mode ii teidoffi ttied since the foot cannot l&gt;e a fuO •ttbttitttte for unfoldfaig the footrett The in«onvenienoe that the operation of the fooirest can cauie k wdl kMowrt to laotor cycle usen. Equally known to them are the haiardt of bending down, usually from a leated position on the pfflion, and attempting to unfold the footrest<br>
It it therefore an object <rf this htventlon to propose a footrcst device which can be solely opo by the foot wtthout any difficulty hi carrying out operation></rf><br>
which ii limpK quick and eny.<br>
The retractable footreit device for a motor cyde, according to thii invention, compriies a footreit monber hingeably fixed to a bracket attadhed to the frame of the motor ^yde, the taid memlier being thai hfaigeably movaMe to fokled and anfolded potitionf agahitt the lakl frame; dbaracterlied by a cam loaded by a spring and provided with a itot, said cam being connected to the said member and movable angvbirly therewith; a lock pin for engaging with the ilot whenever tlie ■aid member ii moved, agafaut the force exerted 1^ the spring, in a direction for attainfaig tts folded position; the slot, however, Jerking itself away from the pin, in disengagement, whenever the footrest is sharply thrust fai the same dfa'ection, to cause the said member to assume its unfolded position,<br><br>
under the force exerted by the spring.<br>
This mventioit will now be described with reference to the accompanyhig drawinp wfaidi iUttstrate, by way of example and not by way of limitation one of posioble embodiments of this invoition,<br>
Fig.l illttstratiag the embodiment (azid a part of tki&amp; motorc^'de frame to whkh it h attadied) with the footrest m&amp;mber in Hbk folded p
Fig.2 iOttstrating the embodhnent (and a part of the motorcycle frame to which it is attached) wtth the footrest member in its unfolded position<br>
Fig3 Uinstrathig the view hi Fig.1 partly cut away to dbdose the interior<br><br>
iodicatiDg the lock pin engaged with the slot in the cam.<br>
Fig.4 ilhistrathig iilnstrating the view in Fig.2 partly cut<br>
away to disclose the interior indicatmg the lock pin<br>
disengaged with the slot in the cam.<br>
A foob-est member M is hingeably fixed to a bracket B attached to the frame F of a motor cycle, the said member being thus hingeably movable to folded and unfolded positions as shown in the drawings.<br>
A cam C is loaded by a spring T and provided with a slot S. The cam C is connected to the member M and thus moves, angularly, with the member M.<br>
A lock pm L is provided for engaging with the slot S, whenever the member M is moved in the direction of the arrow V for attaining its folded position, against the<br><br>
force exerted by the spring T. The movement of the member M to its folded position is effected by flie pillion riddf by {^plying his foot to tiie member to move the member to the said position. With tht slot engaged with the lock pin L Ihe member M is retained in its folded position.<br>
The member M has a convex portion G on its surface which is ugually rubber-lined. Whenever the member M is to be unfolded, the pillion rider applies a sharp thrust, with his foot on tiie portion 0, causing the slot to jeik out of the slot S, in disengagement, and die member M, under the force exerted by the spring T, to unfold, for use by ^e pillion rider.<br>
The spring T is preferably a torsion spring.<br>
A stopper Q is provided for preventing movement of the member M, as its unfolds, beyond a predetermined pomt.<br><br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, as these do not exclude any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but various other embodiments of this invention are possible without departing from its scope and ambit<br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A retrftctable footrest device for a motor cycle comprisittg afootregt member kingeably fixed to t bracket aitached to the frame of &amp;e motor cycle, the said member being thus hingeably movable to folded and unfolded positions; characterised by a cam loaded by a spring and provided with a sbt, said cam being connected to the said member and movable angularly therewith; a lock pin for engaging with tiie slot, to lock itself therewith, whenever the said member k moved in the direction for attaining its folded position, against the force exerted by the spring; the slot, however, jerking itself away from the pin, in disengagement, whenever the footrest is sharply thrust in the said direction, to cause &amp;e sold member to assume its unfolded position, under the force exerted by tibe spring.<br>
2.	A device as clahn ed m Claim 1 wherein the spring is a torsion spring.<br><br>
3.	A device as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein<br>
tiie said member has a convex portion on its<br>
surface.<br>
4.	A device as claim ed in any one of ^e preceding<br>
Claims wherein a stopper is provided for the said<br>
member.<br>
5.	A retractable footrest device for a motor cycle<br>
SBbstantially as herein described and ilhistrated in,<br>
and with reference to, the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
