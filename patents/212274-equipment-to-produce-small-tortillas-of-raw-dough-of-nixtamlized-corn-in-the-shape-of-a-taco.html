				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention refers to an equipment for rolling up raw<br>
tortillas into the shape of a "taco." More specifically, it<br>
is a totally automated equipment for the precise and<br>
perfectly defined rolling up of small tortillas or flakes of<br>
raw dough of nixtamalized corn, which is done in a continuous<br>
manner.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
At present, conventional sheeter laminators are employed for<br>
the elaboration of tortillas or raw dough flakes of<br>
nixtamalized corn, which by means of a cutter can make<br>
various shapes and sizes of tortillas or flakes through the<br>
design and predetermined molding of the same.<br>
Until before the present invention, the shaping of "tacos"<br>
beginning with raw flakes or tortillas of nixtamalized corn<br>
dough was unknown and their manufacture presents unsolved<br>
technical problems. The above required, at that time, rolling<br>
up such tortilla or flake on itself, which once completely<br>
rolled up acquires the shape of a "taco."<br>
Raw dough "tacos" may be of various sizes and thickness,<br>
depending on the size and thickness of the tortillas or<br>
flakes, which are the basis of the product.<br>
The obvious solution to accomplish the rolling up of the raw<br>
tortilla on itself was to carry it out manually, with the<br>
problems that such procedure represents.<br>
Effectively, the manual elaboration of "tacos" starting with<br>
small tortillas of raw dough of nixtamalized corn with<br>
industrial processing purposes, which implies the production<br>
of great volumes of such product, does not meet the<br>
production expectations to cover a more or less ample market,<br>
since a considerable amount of labor would be required, which<br>
results in high production costs and therefore low income-<br>
yield capability.<br>
Due to the above, a machine for rolling up small tortillas of<br>
raw dough of nixtamalized corn on themselves, adapted for<br>
elaborating them mechanically, in considerable amounts and at<br>
adequate speeds, which meets industrial production<br>
expectations with commercial ends, would solve the previously<br>
described problems.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention has as its main objective to make available an<br>
equipment that permits rolling up on themselves small<br>
tortillas or flakes of raw dough of nixtamalized corn in a<br>
continuous and automatic manner.<br>
Another objective of this invention is to make available an<br>
equipment with the aforementioned qualities, which has also<br>
the particularity of being able to vary the speed of the<br>
acceleration conveyor, which permits obtaining a more exact<br>
rolling up on themselves of small tortillas or flakes of raw<br>
dough of nixtamalized corn, continuously and automatically.<br>
Another objective of this invention is to make available such<br>
equipment so that, besides, it has the feature of producing<br>
such product at considerable speeds and volumes at an<br>
industrial level with commercial purposes.<br>
Another objective of this invention is to make available such<br>
equipment so that, besides, it is able to shape such product<br>
in a single line, up to as many as may turn out to be shaped<br>
in the total width of operation of the production line.<br>
Another objective of this invention is to make available such<br>
equipment, so that it has the peculiarity of being capable of<br>
being assembled and disassembled on any conventional<br>
laminator of sheeter line at the end of the exit mesh,<br>
without affecting the elaboration of products typical of the<br>
corn line.<br>
And all those qualities and objectives that will be present<br>
when performing a description of this invention supported on<br>
the illustrated modality.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Broadly speaking, this invention consists in an automated<br>
equipment for rolling up on themselves small tortillas or<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an equipment to produce small<br>
tortillas of raw dough of nixtamalized corn in the shape of a "taco", starting from a<br>
conventional sheeter laminator with an exit mesh conveyor, characterized in that<br>
it integrates an additional equipment at the end of such conveyor, which<br>
comprises an acceleration mesh conveyor with an equal transversal section as<br>
the laminator exit conveyor, propelled by a system of generation and transmission<br>
of movement that comprises a motor, a reducer, and a transmission guard on the<br>
axis of the roller of such acceleration conveyor, which has on its sides two ,<br>
housings placed with three rectangular support structures with an upper control<br>
slit, fixed perpendicularly on the housings, on which there are supported in a<br>
manner susceptible of being disassembled and transversally with respect to the<br>
acceleration conveyor, three arrows: from two of them there is pending from both<br>
ends, in a manner similar to a swing, a set of individual meshes corresponding to<br>
the pre-rolling up meshes, while from the third arrow, there is pending one end, in<br>
a manner similar to a curtain, a set of final rolling up meshes for such small<br>
tortillas.<br>
flakes of raw dough of nixtamalized corn, which have the<br>
final shape of small and perfectly rolled up "tacos."<br>
In order to roll up on themselves small tortillas of raw<br>
dough of nixtamalized corn, we started from the utilization<br>
of a conventional sheeter laminator, which is made up of a<br>
hopper for receiving the dough, a couple of laminating<br>
rollers separated by a very short distance, which spin both<br>
in the same direction toward the inside; a lower roller with<br>
a cutter that gives shape and size to the tortillas or flakes<br>
unfastened by a device that causes the product not to stick;<br>
on the lower part of the laminator there is also the exit<br>
mesh conveyor.<br>
Starting from such sheeter laminator, we began experimenting<br>
to roll up the tortillas or flakes on themselves, first by<br>
placing persons at the sides of the conveyor, who rolled up<br>
the tortillas manually; but this, although it was acceptable<br>
from the point of view of the final shape of the product, was<br>
not attractive from the point of view of production volumes.<br>
Also, it was not attractive due to the high production costs<br>
implied by using a great amount of labor, which resulted in<br>
an operation with low income-yield capability.<br>
Then it was thought to substitute labor and design an<br>
equipment to effect such operation without the participation<br>
of workers" hands, which would produce the same results<br>
regarding the quality of the formation of the product and<br>
increase production volumes, at greater speeds in lesser<br>
times. Therefore, it was decided to design an automated<br>
equipment.<br>
Then we began to think of the type of equipment that could be<br>
used to effect such operation, which would allow for rolling<br>
up on themselves small tortillas of raw dough of nixtamalized<br>
corn with the appropriate quality, which would yield the<br>
wished for final shape of the rolling up in the shape of a<br>
"taco." It was then thought of using an element that would<br>
substitute the movement and manipulation effected by the<br>
human hand; we had the idea that through a roller with the<br>
appropriate surface, the same operation could be effected<br>
that would provide the effect and manipulation necessary to<br>
be able to roll up such tortillas on themselves. However,<br>
this implied designing a roller that would have the<br>
capability of spinning, and that would have a certain<br>
looseness and a pivoting effect of a vertical movement, which<br>
would allow for the tortillas being rolled up and going<br>
through once rolled up; but due to the great complexity than<br>
this represented and the infinity of pieces it would possibly<br>
require, it turned out to be an "element rather difficult to<br>
design, therefore, such possibility was discarded.<br>
We opted for placing a mesh transversally to the exit<br>
conveyor of the sheeter laminator, hanging as a curtain,<br>
which would permit to carry out such effect of rolling up,<br>
where it was necessary to choose the most appropriate<br>
material, which would prevent the adherence of the raw dough<br>
tortillas or flakes to the mesh; until, finally, such purpose<br>
was accomplished, but one more problem persisted, since the<br>
separation distance at which the raw dough tortillas or<br>
flakes come out, determined by the speed of the exit conveyor<br>
of the sheeter laminator, during the rolling up process, had<br>
as a result that the tortillas or flakes were too close<br>
together, which yielded two, three, or more tortillas at the<br>
same time. This had as a result an undesired amorphous<br>
rolling up.<br>
It was thought then of modifying the sheeter laminator, which<br>
would permit to elaborate tortillas or flakes of raw dough of<br>
nixtamalized corn at grater speeds, with the adjustment of<br>
the speed of the exit conveyor and modifications to the<br>
rollers and the structure of the laminator; but this implied<br>
greater modifications, adaptations, and additional equipment<br>
on such laminator, which would result in the elimination of<br>
the versatility of such conveyor, which would render it<br>
incapable of being used afterward to elaborate other types of<br>
products that do require the speeds of elaboration with which<br>
the laminator is designed.<br>
It was thought, therefore, to adapt a mesh conveyor at the<br>
end of the exit: conveyor of the laminator with greater speed,<br>
by placing a frequency variator on the motor of such<br>
conveyor, which allowed for adjusting the speed to make it<br>
more precise, which provided a greater separation space<br>
between the tortillas, the adequate separation space to<br>
permit the precise rolling up of each tortilla or flake<br>
individually, thus eliminating the problem of agglutination.<br>
However, although the above problem had been solved, a high<br>
percentage of badly shaped product was still obtained, which<br>
was undesirable due to the great loss generated; and after an<br>
analysis, it was found that such inefficiencies and<br>
malformations were due to the lack of flexibility of the mesh<br>
in the shape of a curtain, given that the length of the mesh<br>
was quite great when disposed transversally on the<br>
acceleration conveyor. Therefore, we opted for dividing<br>
into sections, in such a manner as to have meshes in the<br>
shape of individual and more flexible curtains, which<br>
improved the rolling up; but even so, the percentage of<br>
malformations, although it was less than before, represented<br>
a considerable loss of raw dough.<br>
The operation was analyzed in a detailed and conscientious<br>
manner, and we reached the conclusion and determination of<br>
testing with two meshes for the rolling up on themselves of<br>
the small tortillas, and after a considerable time and<br>
multiple rehearsals and experimentations, we reached the<br>
final placement and conformation that the two curtains of<br>
meshes should have to be able to obtain one hundred percent<br>
of product adequately formed and at the required operation<br>
speeds for the shaping of "tacos" starting with the precise<br>
rolling up on themselves of small tortillas of raw dough of<br>
nixtamalized corn, without modifying the sheeter laminator at<br>
all, maintaining its versatility and the possibility of using<br>
the same line to elaborate other characteristic products in<br>
this corn line, with no problem whatsoever.<br>
The system of rolling up on themselves of small tortillas of<br>
raw dough of nixtamalized corn comprises therefore, a mesh<br>
acceleration conveyor, with an equal transversal section as<br>
the exit conveyor of the sheeter laminator, propelled by a<br>
system of generation and transmission of movement, which<br>
comprises a motor which, through a reducer and a transmission<br>
guard, transmits movement to the axis of the roller of such<br>
conveyor.<br>
The acceleration conveyor presents a variable acceleration<br>
mesh and a housing on each side end. Such housings present a<br>
series of rectangular supports with slits on the upper part,<br>
placed perpendicularly to such housings, where three arrows<br>
are resting, placed transversally with respect to the<br>
acceleration conveyor. In the two first arrows, a series of<br>
individual meshes are attached and pending, suspended on both<br>
ends in a manner similar to a swing, each end supported by a<br>
different arrow, such meshes correspond to the pre-rolling up<br>
meshes, which present a small surface for dragging and<br>
contact with the acceleration conveyor mesh. This permits to<br>
fold upward only a small portion of the tortilla or flake. On<br>
the third and last arrow there are pending, attached from a<br>
single end in the shape of a curtain, a series of meshes<br>
aligned and in equal number as the aforementioned, which<br>
correspond to the final rolling up meshes, with a greater<br>
surface for contact and dragging with the acceleration<br>
conveyor mesh, which permits, with the help of the first<br>
folding previously effected, to roll up mors easily,<br>
perfectly, and efficiently such small tortillas of raw dough<br>
of nixtamalized corn.<br>
Such equipment has the particularity of implementing or<br>
incorporating as many pre-rolling up and final rolling up<br>
meshes for small tortillas of raw dough of nixtamalized corn,<br>
on the width of the acceleration conveyor, as lines of<br>
product are required.<br>
Besides, such equipment has the particularity of being able<br>
to withdraw the arrows that support the pre-rolling up and<br>
final rolling up meshes of such small tortillas and continue<br>
to produce on the line, corn products with similar or<br>
different characteristics of the line, without the need to<br>
make modifications to the structure or disassemble the<br>
additional equipment such as the acceleration belt, nor the<br>
housings with the supports.<br>
For a better understanding of the invention, we will go on to<br>
make the description of the same, shown on the drawings which<br>
with illustrative but not limiting purposes are enclosed to<br>
this description.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure .1 shows an isometric view of Che equipment for rolling<br>
up on themselves small tortillas of raw dough of nixtamalized<br>
corn, illustrating the placement and conformation of the<br>
sheeter laminator. For a better understanding of the<br>
invention, we will go on to make the detailed description of<br>
one of the modalities of the same, shown on the drawings<br>
which, with illustrative but not limiting purposes, are<br>
enclosed to this description.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The characteristic details of this structure in any of the<br>
preferred modalities are illustrated and described in the<br>
following figure.<br>
Figure 1 shows an isometric view of the equipment for rolling<br>
up on themselves small tortillas of raw dough of nixtamalized<br>
corn, illustrating the placement and conformation of the<br>
sheeter laminator, the conveyor with metallic mesh of the<br>
laminator exit, the acceleration mesh conveyor, the housings,<br>
the system of generation and transmission of movement, and<br>
the details of the placement and conformation of the axes on<br>
the supports, as well as the pre-rolling up and final rolling<br>
up meshes of such small tortillas.<br>
In such figure, the sheeter laminator 100 comprises a<br>
receiving hopper 101 for the dough, under which rollers 102<br>
and 103 for formation of the raw dough sheet of nixtamalized<br>
corn are placed; such rollers show two axes 104 and 105,<br>
through which the receive movement, both in the same<br>
direction of spin, toward the center, to favor the laminating<br>
process.<br>
Roller 103 shows a series of divisions in its transversal<br>
section, and on its lower part there is a roller with a<br>
cutter (not shown in the figure) , which provides the shape,<br>
size, and thickness to the tortillas or flakes of raw dough,<br>
and which are unfastened from the lower roller with a spear-<br>
type device that causes them not to stick (not shown in the<br>
figure). Likewise, on the lower part of the sheeter laminator<br>
100, there is a metallic mesh conveyor of exit 106, propelled<br>
by roller 107.<br>
After the metallic mesh conveyor of exit 106, there is a<br>
second metallic mesh conveyor of acceleration 108 with an<br>
equal transversal section, which advances at a greater speed<br>
than the exit conveyor 106. Such metallic mesh conveyor of<br>
acceleration 108 is propelled by a system of generation and<br>
transmission of movement with an appropriate location, which<br>
comprises a motor 109 with a reducer 110, which through a<br>
transmission guard 111 transmits movement and propels such<br>
conveyor.<br>
The acceleration conveyor 108 has fixed on each side a<br>
metallic housing 112; such housings have fixed each two<br>
supports 113 and 114 in a rectangular shape, with a slit on<br>
the upper part and with greater separation, to them are fixed<br>
a third support: 115 of equal features, supports 113 and 114<br>
of each housing 112, which supports in its slits arrows 116<br>
and 117 respectively, placed transversally with respect to<br>
the acceleration conveyor 118 in a manner that is susceptible<br>
of disassembly, while supports 115 support in their slits<br>
arrows 118, also transversally. At the same time, arrows 116<br>
and 117 support on both ends, in a manner similar to a swing,<br>
the pre-rolling up meshes 119. Such pre-rolling up meshes are<br>
placed with a small surface of contact and dragging with the<br>
mesh of acceleration conveyor 108, with permits to fold<br>
upward only a small portion of the tortilla or flake. On the<br>
other hand, arrow 118 supports on one end, in the shape of a<br>
certain, the final rolling up meshes 120, aligned and with<br>
equal number as the pre-rolling up meshes 119. The final<br>
rolling up meshes 120 show a greater surface of contact and<br>
dragging with the acceleration conveyor meshes 108, which<br>
permits, with the help of the first folding previously<br>
effected, with the pre-rolling up meshes 119, to roll up more<br>
easily, perfectly, and efficiently such small tortillas of<br>
raw dough of nixtamalized corn.<br>
Such equipment has the particularity of implementing or<br>
incorporating as many metallic pre-rolling up meshes 119 and<br>
final rolling up meshes 120 for small tortillas of raw dough<br>
of nixtamalized corn, on the width of the acceleration<br>
conveyor, as lines of product are required.<br>
Such equipment has the particularity of being capable of<br>
disassembling the arrows 116, 117, and 118, which support the<br>
pre-rolling up meshes 119 and final rolling up meshes 120,<br>
for such small tortillas, and continue to produce on such<br>
line, products characteristic of the corn line, without the<br>
need to make modifications to the structure, nor disassemble<br>
the additional equipment, such as the acceleration belt 108,<br>
nor the housings 112 with such supports 112, 114, and 115,<br>
without affecting the production of other products<br>
characteristic of this line.<br>
The invention has been described sufficiently so that a<br>
person with intermediate knowledge in the subject may be able<br>
to reproduce and obtain the results that we mention in this<br>
invention. However, any person capable in the field of the<br>
technique that corresponds to this invention may be able to<br>
make modifications not described in this application;<br>
however, if for the application of such modifications in a<br>
determined structure or in the manufacturing process of the<br>
same, the subject matter claimed in the following claims is<br>

the roller (102, 103) of such acceleration conveyor (108), which on its sides has<br>
two housings (102) placed with three rectangular support structures (113, 114,<br>
115) with an upper central slit, fixed perpendicularly. On such structures three<br>
arrows are supported in a manner susceptible of being disassembled, and<br>
transversally with respect to the acceleration conveyor; from two of them, there is<br>
pending from both sides in a manner similar to a swing, a set of individual metallic<br>
pre-rolling up meshes (119), with a small surface of dragging with the acceleration<br>
conveyor mesh (108); whereas from the third arrow there is pending on one end<br>
in a manner similar to a curtain, a set of metallic final rolling up meshes (120) for<br>
such small tortillas, with a greater surface of dragging with the acceleration<br>
conveyor mesh.</td>
