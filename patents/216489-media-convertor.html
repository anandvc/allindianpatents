				<td>PRIOR ART<br>
The Media Convertor Unit is to convert Fast Ethernet data entering on one Data Port, on twisited pair Copper wire to a fonnat. suitable for transmission on Fiber Optic Media on the other Data Port anti vice-versa.<br>
Some of the existing Media Convertors in the Industry are known to have used a Two Port Switch Intergrated Circuit to Translate between the two encoding schemes, since two different signal encoding schemes on Copper and Fiber have to be made to communicate with each other.<br>
The existing Media convertor are packaged as stand alone convertor" with appropriate connectors for the 100Base-Tx; copper side and 100Base-Fx Fiber side, as per the corresponding standards, in order to supply electrical power for the functioning of the Media Converter , an external AC or DC Adaptet is used. This Adapter steps down the standard line AC or DC volatage to a lower value which is input to the Media Convertor .<br>
The 100Base-TX Copper media can be in the form of a straight cable or a cross cable" depending on whether the Media Convertor is connected to an Interconnecting equipment  such as a Hub oran end station such a Computer. An ititenial or external switch is used to make the Media Converotr recognize whether straight or cross cable is used. In some cases, this switch is not<br><br>
Available and the user is compelled to use the appropriate cable during installation . In other case seperate connector are provided on the Media Convertor  for connection to a straight and cross cable.<br>
Demerits of the known art and object of the new invention<br>
Since a Two Port Switch Intergrated Circuit is known to use a Store and forward** mechanism in which a entire incoming frame in stored internally and then forwarded to the output port, this introduces a delay in the media conversion process.<br>
The external power supply Adaptor is in the form of a heavy encapsulated module with an integral plug The weight of the Adapter does not give a reliable connection to the mains socket and is a possible cause of faihire of the end-to-end data link when it becomes loose comes out of the socket and disrupts power supply  to the converter, Moreover as part of the installation process the user has to keep track of both the Converter and the Adapter<br>
In case an internal or external switch is used to indicate to the Media Convertor that a straight or cross cable is being used, the user has to set the switch appropriately depending on the cable being used. In case different connectors are earmarked Cor straight or cross cables the user has to take the<br><br>
precaution to use the appropriate connector based on the Cable available and the equipment he wants to connect the Convertor to. If neither a switch nor a seperate connector is available the user is compelled to ensure the use of the appropriate cable during installation.  All these methods, increase the complexity and time taken for installation and commissioning of the network.<br>
The objective of the invention is to develop aMEdia Convertor  which<br>
•	Converts from. Copper Media, to Fiber Media by consuming the least amount of time and introducing minimum delay in the path of data transmission<br>
•	Simplify the installation procedure<br>
•	Reduce  possibility of errors due to wrong types of cbles beiong used<br>
•	Decrease in the overall time needed for the instailatiooi and commissioning process.<br>
"Describtion of the invention as per the drawing<br>
the drawing of the  invention is illustrated in Fig 1,<br>
the  Media Convertor is based on a Network Card connects internally to an AC/DC Power supply Card housed in a Metallic enclosure. Media conversiott   is   accomplished   in.   the   network   Caid.   and   is   liased   on<br><br>
interconnecting two BCMi5221 10/ 100 Base-Tx/Fx Mini-PHy Tanvceivcsr from Broadcom Corporation (directly on their RMII interface<br>
the BCH5221 is a Single chip Fast Ethernet transcevier. It performs all of tins physical layer interface function for 100Base Tx connection on twisted pair copper meciia. It can also be configured for 100Base Fx transmission. When fiber-optic media when paired with an external liber-optic transceiver When connected to each other on their RMTf interlace a» shown in the EAock Diagram the internal receive channel FIFOs included in the BCM5221 allows the data to crosss over the clock boundaries without the requirement tor external buffering or clock muliplexing.<br>
On the twisted pair cooper media side the BCM5221 is connected to an RJ-45 connector through isolation magnetics. The BCM5221 normally transmits on its TD+/- pins and RD+/ pins . When connected by a straight cable to another device that does not perform Auto-MDI/MDIX crossover the BCM5221 automatically switches its transmitter to RUN-/- and receiver to TD+f- to communicate with the remote device. If two devices are connected that both have Auto MDJ/MDIX crossover capability, then a random algorithm determines which end performs the crossover function.<br><br>
The BCM5221 is configures for 100Base Fx operation by connection the SD+ input, to a 100Base-Fx compliant Fiber optic Transceiver and setting the bias volatge on the S&gt;D pin to 1.7v The diferent SD+/ pins input are then compatible 3.3v powered Fast Therenet compatible Fiber optic Tratisceivers. In this Media Convertor unit fiber optic Transceiver with SC LC connectors are spported for Multimode Singlemode and single fiber media,<br>
A SO MHz Crystal Oscillator with 50ppm frequency stability is used as the timing reference for the RHII interface the Ethernet. and the Fiber optic interface.<br>
The Media Convertor Unit can be fed with electrical power for its operation from a standard 3 pin 230 Volt 50 Hz AC socket by connecting it to the socket using a standard AC Power Chord. A DC compatible unit is also available which operates from nominal 4aV DC. The Dimensions of the enclosure is 120x I70x40mm and its weight 0.9kg,<br>
Indicators are available on the Media Convertor Unit for indicatmg to the user the status of the 100Base-TX link 100 Base-FX link and activity in the Fiber link. Mode setting switches are available on the Network card for setting default conditions and troublesliooting.<br><br>
Merits of the invention<br>
Since the Media convertor unit uses a direct conncention between the<br>
/<br>
BCM522 1 ICa using the RMII interface without the use of an external buffer or Switch IC the delay in  the conversion process is brough down to a minimum.<br>
By reducing the number of operations and parts involved in the installation and commissioning process, the installation proceudure is very much simplified. the user makes only one simple connecting for power by cotuiectbtig the Mains Calile to the socket instead of connecting an Adulter which contains active devices and is heavier. The installation. procedure is therefore simplified.<br>
The 100Base-Tx RJ-4S port has the intelligence to sense the type of cable (straight cable or cross cable that has been connected to it and will automatically configure itself appropriately. Network managers and Installation personnel need not take a "hit or miss" approach when installing our Media Convertor into their network and try different: cables until they find the right match (cables are not always clearly marked. This effectively eliminates the need for any intervention or troubles hooting by the person installing it. Possibility of errors due to wrong types of cables being used is eliminated.<br><br>
The Converter is made up of only one Assembly since the power supply cables are used for data connection and an active device, namely power Adapter is used for power connection By reducing the nunber and type of connections to be made to the Media Convertor Unit, the installation and commissioning process is simpliGed very much and time taken for this process is mjnmiized.<br>
