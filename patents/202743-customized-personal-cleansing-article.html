(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
CUSTOMIZED PERSONAL CLEANSING ARTICLE<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2004/058027	PCT/EP2003/013640<br><br>
fly  I  ^CtTOTOMiZlgD <peb gl></peb>
The invention relates to a personal cleansing article, and "more specifically to a personal cleansing article wherein an 5  assembly of one or more of skin cleansing, aesthetic, and skin benefit toilet bars are contained within the confines of a porous pouch.<br>
Toilet bar skin cleaning properties are well known.  An 10  ideal bar composition not only cleans but provides a large quantity of lather, and leaves the skin feeling comfortable. Consumers also desire to obtain toilet bars with good hardness, low mush, and that contain appealing aesthetic ingredients such as fragrances, optionally one or more other 15  aesthetic ingredients and one or more skin benefit agents such as emollients for moisturizing and treating the skin according to individual preferences and needs.<br>
To accomplish this, a wide variety of additives have been 20  suggested for inclusion in toilet bars.  Some additives enhance the physical properties of the bar such as lather volume, hardness and wear rate.  Other additives effect the aesthetic and sensory properties of the bar.  Still other additives enhance skin moisturization, residual 25  antibacterial properties, and treat skin conditions such as acne, etc.  Unfortunately not all potentially desirable additives may be compatible with each other.  As a result, a single toilet bar product is not suitable or desirable for every consumer.  At the same time, the bar manufacturer 3 0  desires to reduce costs by minimizing the difference .in toilet bar compositions it produces.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2004/058027	PCT/EP2003/013640<br>
/<br>
The use of a porous or netted bag or pouch to carry soap is<br>
known.  The prior art includes US Patent No. 1,682,119 where a bag is provided with soap in a flake or fragment form. Similarly US Patent No. 2,607,940 discloses a mesh bag so 5  that a soap can be easily inserted.  Similar arrangements are taught in e.g. US Patent No. 3,167,805, US Patent No. 4,190,550, US Patent No. 4,228,834, US Patent No. 4,48,0939, and US Patent No. 5,462,378.  US Patent No. 4,789,262 teaches a soap holding cleaning pad.  US Patent No.<br>
10  5,83 9,842 discloses a cleansing system with a toilet bar and a sponge in a porous pouch.  US Patent No. 6,042,288 teaches the use of a synthetic detergent bar and a pouf for holding the bar.  JP Patent No. 10137152 also teaches a solid soap in an expansible net.  The problem with prior art toilet bar<br>
15  and pouch implements is the inability to make available a product with a wide range of sensory properties in a convenient format, but with excellent physical properties.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that when a single toilet bar 20  is formulated with high levels of benefit agents such as a moisturizing agent, and aesthetic ingredients such as a fragrance, the wear rate and lather volume properties of the toilet bar such as lather, wear rate etc are substantially degraded compared to a system of individual toilet bars 25  formulated separately where a cleansing bar, a benefit agent bar, and an aesthetic agent bar are separately produced. For the purposes of this invention, a "bar" is herein defined' as an individual toilet bar or other geometrically or amorphous shaped body that may be selected from and 3 0  combined with other toilet bars or bodies according to the invention.  According to the present invention, these<br><br><br>
WO 2004/058027		PCT/EP2003/013640<br><br>
separate bars may be combined in a porous pouch to bring together all the cleansing and skin treatment attributes desired by the consumer, and at the same time form a useful cleansing implement with superior lathering properties compared to a single toilet bar formed with the same cleansing and skin treatment ingredients.  Furthermore it has been found that production efficiency is enhanced by making the bars separately, since such bars if made by the melt cast process have a shorter solidification time. Moreover the variability of solidification time in melt cast bars may be minimized by separate manufacturing of the bars. With respect to extrusion of such bars, the variability of processing parameters such as extrusion rate and stampability may also be minimized by separate manufacture of the bars.<br>
In one aspect of the invention there is provided a cleansing article, including:<br>
a closable receptacle formed of a porous material;<br>
a plurality of solid or semi-solid bars held in the receptacle including a first bar having a cleansing composition and a second bar having second composition selected from an aesthetic composition, a skin benefit composition or a combined aesthetic and benefit composition; wherein the cleansing and second compositions differ from each other; and<br>
wherein the cleansing composition contains a surfactant selected from a synthetic anionic surfactant, a soap, and a <br><br><br>
WO 2004/058027<br><br><br><br>
PCT/EP2003/013640<br><br>
blend.thereof.in. a concentration greater than about 5 % by wt. (preferably greater than about 10 % by wt.)and the second composition contains an aesthetic ingredient, a skin benefit ingredient or a blend thereof; the aesthetic or 5  benefit ingredient being present in a concentration that is greater than the concentration of the same ingredient in the cleansing composition.<br>

The term "substrate" also includes naturally 10  occurring materials such as animal skin e.g. chamois, leathers and the like.<br>
Preferred embodiments employ non-woven substrates, since they are economical and readily available in a variety of<br>
15  materials.  By non-woven is meant that the layer is<br>
comprised of fibers which are not.woven into a fabric but rather are formed into a sheet, particularly a tissue.  The fibers can either be random (i.e., randomly aligned) or they can be carded (i.e. combed to be oriented in primarily one<br>
20 direction) . Furthermore, the non-woven, substrate, can be composed of a combination of layers of random and carded fibers.<br>
Non-woven substrates may be comprised of a variety of 25  materials both natural and synthetic.  By "natural" is meant that the materials are derived from plants, animals, insects or by-products.  By "synthetic" is meant that the materials are obtained primarily from various man-made materials or from material that is usually a fibrous web comprising any 3 0  of the common synthetic or natural textile-length fibers, or mixtures thereof.<br>

Suitable pouch materials may include at least one apertured fabric, where a pattern is created by a network of bundled fiber segments surrounding apertures or holes; or in a contiguous nonwoven web which has been apertured or provided 5  with slits or other openings.  In one preferred embodiment, the water insoluble matterial is a substantially contiguous network of water insoluble fibers having a plurality of macroscopic openings.  A macroscopic opening is defined as an opening that is large relative to the intrinsic pore size 10  of the water insoluble material.<br>
In a typical spunbond or bonded carded web, for example, a macroscopic opening would appear to the eye to be a deliberately introduced hole or void in the web rather than<br>
15  a characteristic pore between adjacent fibers.<br>
Specifically, it could have a characteristic width or major axis diameter of about 0.1 mm to about 10 mm, or larger; preferably about 1 mm to about 5 mm.  A useful characteristic width may be defined as 4 times the area of<br>
20  the aperture divided by the perimeter.  Useful fabric aperture densities are about 10 to 700 per square inch, preferably about 2 0 to 500 per square inch.<br>
As discussed above, the nonwoven web may be made from 25  synthetic fibers, as is known in the art, and may be a<br>
spunbond web, a meltblown web, a bonded carded web, or other fibrous nonwoven structures known in the art.  For example, a polyester nonwoven web such as a low basis' weight spunbond material could be provided with apertures through pin 3 0  aperturing; perf embossing and mechanical stretching of the web; die punching or stamping to provide apertures or holes<br>

apertures or holes in the web; laser cutters that cut out portions of the web; patterned forming techniques, such as air laying of synthetic fibers on a patterned substrate to impart macroscopic openings; needle punching with sets of 10  barbed needles to engage and displace fibers; and other methods known in the art.  Preferably, the openings are provided in a regular pattern over at least a portion of the pouch.<br>
15  The pouch of the present invention can comprise two or more portions, each having a different texture and abrasiveness. The differing textures can'result from the use of different combinations of materials or from the use of a substrate having a more abrasive side for exfoliation and a softer,<br>
20  absorbent side for gentle cleansing.  In addition, separate portions of the pouch can be manufactured to have different permanent colors thereby helping the user to further distinguish the surfaces.<br>

WO 2004/058027<br><br><br><br>
PCT/EP2003/OI3640<br><br>
Basic Method:<br>
1.	Load Cell with the solid/semi-solid bar that is<br>
equilibrated and maintained at a constant temperature<br>
of 25°C using a water bath.<br>
5<br>
2.	Apply force from the top so that the solid/semi-solid<br>
bar is displaced at a rate of 10 mm/min through an<br>
orifice at the bottom of cell and measure the force<br>
applied in kN.  The orifice has a diameter of 2 mm and<br>
10       a length of 60 mm.<br>
The Pressure drop across the capillary length defines how rigid the material is.  This rigidity index is defined as:<br>
15       Rigidity Index = Pressure drop (kPA) = Force (kN)/Area (mA2) Where the Area = PI*DiamA2/4<br>
Diam = diameter of the rod applying the force, in this case 31.4 mm.<br>
2	0  Wear Rate Measurement Procedure<br>
Procedure<br>
1.	Weigh each bar to 0.01 gms., then place the bar in a<br>
25      soap dish.<br>
2.	Adjust tap water to 40°C, and keep running water into a<br>
bucket.<br>
. 3.  Immerse bar and hands in 4 0°C water .in a bucket.<br>
4.	Remove bar and rotate 20 times (180° rotation for each<br>
3	0      time).<br>
5.	Repeat steps 3 and 4.<br>
38<br><br>
WO 2004/058027<br><br><br><br>
PCT/EP2003/013640<br><br>
6.	Immerse the bar for the third time and replace in the soap dish.<br>
7.	Add'7.5 ml of tap water to the soap dish at 25°C.<br>
8.	Repeat the wash procedure (steps 2-6) three more times<br>
5      during the first day of the test. Washings are done 2<br>
hours apart.<br>
9.	After the last wash of the day, add 7.5 ml tap water at<br>
25°C to the soap dish and let the bars sit overnight.<br>
10.	After 17 hours repeat wash procedure (steps 2-6), but<br>
10      this time place the bars on a drying rack under ambient<br>
conditions.<br>
11.	After 17 hours weigh the bars to 0.01 g.<br><br>
15<br>
Wear rate (g/wash) = Initial Wt (g) - Final Wt. (g) / 5 Lather Volume Measurement Procedure<br>
Apparatus<br>
20  Two large sinks and a measuring funnel are used.  The<br>
measuring funnel is fabricated using a 10.5-inch diameter plastic funnel and a 3 00 ml graduated cylinder with the bottom cleanly removed.  The cylinder is fitted with the 0 ml mark over the funnel stem.  The cylinder is sealed onto<br>
25  the funnel.<br>
Procedure<br>
a). Place the funnel a.t the bottom of the Sink #1.  Add tap water to the sink until the 0 ml mark of the funnel is 30    reached.<br>
b) Generate lather.<br><br><br>
WO 2004/058027	PCT/EP2003/013640<br>
1)' Run-tap- on sink-#2-.<br>
2)	Adjust the temperature of the water to 3 0°C.<br>
3)	Holding the pouch with the bars between both hands under running water, rotate for 10 half turns (18 0<br>
5       degrees/half turn).<br>
4)	Remove hands and pouch from under the running water.<br>
5)	Rotate the pouch 15 half turns (18 0 degrees/half turn).<br>
6)	Place funnel over hands and pouch.<br>
10    7) Lower hands and funnel into Sink #1.<br>
8)	When hands and pouch are fully immersed, slide from under the funnel.<br>
9)	Lower funnel to the bottom of the sink.<br>
10)	Read the lather volume.<br>
15    11) Remove the funnel from Sink #1.<br>
12) Rinse funnel and hands in sink #2.<br>
