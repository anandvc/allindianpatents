SPECIFICATION<br>
SECTION 10<br>
TITLE   :	TYRE RETREADING PLANT<br>
APPLICANT (S) :    RECAMIC S.A,<br>
ROUTE DU MONT CARMEL 1,<br>
-<br>
CH-1762 GIVISIEZ, SWITZERLAND.<br>
WISS COMPANY.		<br>
The following Specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
The present invention relates to a tire retreading plant comprising at least two work stations for preparing the tyres to be retreaded, an autoclave having a horizontal axis for vulcanising the new treads, first transfer means for transferring the tyres between the various stations and for storing them and second transfer means for transferring the tyres into the autoclave, out of it and for storing them.<br>
The process implemented in the invention is of the type comprising stations for detreading the used tyres, for scraping the carcass, for laying the new tread, for rolling it on to the carcass, and a vulcanisation autoclave for the tyres which have been provided with their new tread.<br>
Generally, the transfers of tyres between these different stations on one hand, then into the autoclave and out of it on the other hand, as well as the various intermediate storage operations, are effected by conveyors of greater or lesser bulk and complexity. An example of this type of installation is described in European Patent 086 766.<br>
The present invention is directed precisely at simplifying the conveyors used hitherto.<br>
According to the invention, a tire retreading plant comprising a certain number of work stations for preparing the tyres to be retreaded, an autoclave having a horizontal axis for vulcanising the new treads, first means for transferring the tyres between the various stations and for storing them and second means for transferring the tyres into the autoclave, out of it and for storing them, is characterised in that the first and second transfer means comprise a common transfer and storage structure.<br>
Preferably, the first transfer means comprise a first endless loop of a monorail transporter and a crane, the boom of which makes it possible to reach all the work stations arranged in a circle around the crane, the<br><br>
second transfer means comprising a second endless loop and a branch of said monorail transporter, said branch penetrating into the autoclave, and also a crane, the common transfer and storage structure is formed of a branch common to the two endless loops of said monorail transporter and said crane.<br>
Advantageously, the two endless loops have an elongated form to facilitate intermediate storage of tyres in batches. The foot of the crane is preferably mounted inside the second endless loop of the monorail transporter.<br>
An example of embodiment of the invention, which is given in non-limitative manner, will be described in detail, with reference to the appended drawing, in which:<br>
-Figure 1 is a diagrammatic top view of the tire retreading plant;<br>
-Figures 2 and 3 are a diagrammatic elevation and side view of the same<br>
plant;<br>
-Figures 4,5 and 6 are simplified top views of the same plant, showing the<br>
transfers of the tyres during the successive phases; in these figures, only<br>
the references necessary to explain each phase of operation have been<br>
shown.<br>
Figure 1 shows diagrammatically the transfer means of a tire retreading plant according to the invention. These transfer means comprise a monorail transporter 1 and a single crane 2. The monorail transporter 1 comprises a first elongated endless loop 3 and a second endless loop 4 with a rectilinear branch 5 extending into the autoclave 6 having a horizontal axis. These two endless loops 3 and 4 have a common branch 7. The foot 8 of the crane 2 is mounted inside the second endless loop 4 of the monorail transporter 1.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 show the crane 2. The boom 9 thereof, which is equipped with a trolley 10 and a hoist 11, makes it possible-as will be described<br><br>
further below -to reach all the work stations arranged around the crane 2 in a circle C (in broken lines).<br>
In known manner, the monorail 1 is fixed to rigid posts, such as 12 and 13, and is equipped with brackets such as 14, for transporting the tyres 15, etc.<br>
With reference to Figures 4, 5 and 6, the operation of this plant will now be described and the role of the different stations specified.<br>
Figure 4 relates to the phase of receiving and detreading the used tyres which are to be retreaded.<br>
On arrival, the worn tyres to be retreaded are stored at 20, then inspected at 21 and cleaned at 22 using an aspirator; they are then stored at 23 before being mounted on the detreading machine 24. Advantageously, this machine is of a type which makes it possible to effect both the detreading and the dressing with the new tread. In this first stage, therefore, the worn tread is removed by scraping the crown of the tyre to be retreaded.<br>
From this station, the tyres are transferred by the crane, the boom 9 of which sweeps the circle C, and are stored beneath the monorail 1. The station 25, which makes it possible to turn the tyres, facilitates external repairs, for example on a crown reinforcement ply or damage to the sidewall, whereas the station 26 is an internal repair station. The tyres thus prepared then return to the station 25 for application of rubber solution before the new tread is laid, then they are stored on the first endless loop 3 of the monorail transporter 1.<br>
Figure 5 relates to the phase of retreading proper: the new treads, stored at 30, are brought at 31 to be cut to the desired length and sized, then mounted on a tyre using the machine 24 already mentioned. After dressing with the new tread, each  tyre is brought to the station 32 for the<br><br>
curing rim and the internal curing membrane or an internal chamber (in the case of textile carcasses) to be put in position; at the station 33 the tyres are inserted into an external envelope by an expander. The object of the station 34 is to tip the tyres in order to mount the external envelope and to draw the air between the tyre and the envelope in the case of radial carcasses; a rubber mat 35 arranged on the ground protects the external curing membranes from any risk of puncture.<br>
The tyres thus prepared are grouped on the outer branch of the second loop 4 of the monorail transporter 1 in batches of 5 or 10, for example, depending on the capacity of the autoclave 6, into which they are then introduced, guided on the branch 5 of the loop 4 of the monorail.<br>
Figure 6 relates to the phase of unloading of the retreaded tyres: after vulcanisation in the autoclave 6, the retreaded tyres are brought, still in batches, from the branch 5 to the common branch 7 of the monorail, for intermediate storage again.<br>
From there, they are taken up again at the station 33 for removing the outer envelope. In the case of radial tyres, the chambers or the internal envelopes are also removed in the protected zone 35.<br>
Finally, after a last check, the retreaded tyres, which are ready to be shipped, are unloaded and taken to 36.<br>
It can be seen that the invention makes it possible to produce a very compact installation, all the costs of which are reduced, and the space taken up on the ground of which is minimal.<br><br>
