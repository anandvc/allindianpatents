				<td>This invention relates to amethod of obtaining biomateriais coated to fibrin adhesive.<br>
This invention further relates to stable coating of growth factor incorporated bioadhesives onto polymeric materials so as to enhance attachment and proliferation of endothelial cells, and thus to reduce the thrombogenicity of the materials that are implanted as card iovascular prosthesis,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Blood vessel diseases and its blockage have become a major cause of damage of organs. Occlusive arterial disease is commonly treated, by-passing the occluded vessel. Though autogeneous grafts are the best, when suitable vein is not available, synthetic vascular grafts made of polyethylene terephthalate or polytetrafluoro ethylene are substituted.<br>
Alternatively, the blocked portion of the vessel may be reopened or replaced by a vascular stent composed of metal or synthetic materials.<br>
However, small caliber synthetic vascular grafts for medium or smal1 vessel bypass is limited by<br><br>
frequent  graft occlusion.  This is mainly  because  the<br>
currently    available    vascular   grafts    do   not endothelialize   and  they  remain  throrobogenic.    The<br>
seeding  of vascular grafts with endothelial  cells  has been  considered  as  a  solution  to  the  problem   of<br>
thrombogenicity  (Mosquera  and Goldman,  Br.  J-  Surg. 78:656-660, 1991) ,  In experimental settings, seeding  of<br>
endothelial   cells   has  shown   beneficial   effects. However,  seeded  grafts suitable for  routine  use are<br>
still  not produced-<br>
There   is  a  clear  need   for   nonthrombogenic<br>
synthetic  materials  for   implant  applications.   The surface  in  contact  with  blood  should  be  able   to<br>
endothelialize  or  form neointima in  a  short  period. This will  prevent protein deposition,  clot  formation,<br>
platelet adhesion and aggregation on  the surface.   The thrombus  should not grow on the surface to occlude  the<br>
flow or to  get embolized into the flow.<br>
While   endothelial   cell  seeding   can   reduce<br>
thrombogenicity of the surface, the major problem is the lack  of  a suitable protein coating on the  surface  to<br><br>
which  endotheial  cells can  attach  and  proliferate.<br>
Most  of  the  proteins have problem   that  their  cell attachment  domain   also  attract  platelet  and   thus<br>
thrombus forms on the area   where endothelial cells  haw not grown.  The coating of a matrix protein is, however,<br>
essential for cells to attach and grow.<br>
Another problem in the field is that only  limited<br>
number  of   cells  can  be  obtained   when  cells are harvested  from  the  patient's own blood  vessel.   The<br>
cells  should proliferate quickly so that after donating the  cells  at  least in a week's time he  can  get  the<br>
endothelialised  graft   placed, instead of  the  insured vessel.  Thus, the proteins coated on the surface  should<br>
also be able to promote cell proliferatiron.<br>
PRIOR ARTT<br>
When  a blood vessel  is injured, the process   of blood  clotting  generates  fibrin,  which  holds  other<br>
blood  cells  and  the  cytokines  and  growth   factors released by white blood cells, platelets and surrounding<br>
cells.    The  fibrin  network then acts  as  a  natural scaffold for cells to  migrate and proliferate and  thus<br>
tissue repair  and remodeling  takes place.<br><br>
The  idea  of  using fibrinogen or  fibrin  as   a matrix  has been  tried out [US Patent s  5,324,647  and 5,272,0743.   However, the method that has been used  to stabilize the fibrinogen to the surface is heating.  But heating  above   50°C  in  presence  of  moisture   will denature   the  proteins   and  especially  the   growth factors.   Thus  these  proteins  may  act  as  a   eel 1 attachment  scaffold but may not promote  the  migration and proliferation of  cells.<br>
Collagen  is also  a natural extrace1lular  matrix protein   which  helps   migration  and   cell   growth. Gelatin has been routinely used for growing  endothelial cells   in  tissue  culture wells  as  it  enhances  the migration and proliferatiron -  However, stabi1ization of gelatin  on  the surface  is difficult  and  cells  thus grown   get   easily  detached   under   shear   stress. Therefore, we have incorporated gelatin into  the fibrin network and stabilized it on the surface to improve  the cel1 migration and proliferation.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An  object  of  this  invention  is   to   propose a polymeric materials having a coating of growth  factor incorporated adhesives.<br><br>
Another object of this  invention is to propose  a method  of  coating polymeric   materials  with   growth factor  incorporated  bioadhesives which is   shown   to resist  the shear stress as compared to the  endothelial cells grown  on gelatin  coated  material.<br>
Still  another  object of  this  invention  is  to propose  a method of coating polymeric   materials  with growth   factor  incorporated  bioadhesives   which   is stabilize.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According  to this invention there is  provided  a<br>
method  of  coating  polymeric   materials  with  growth factor incorporated bioadhesives  which comprises in the<br>
steps of s i)    treating the surface of said material to obtain an<br>
enzyme activity ii)    coating  the  treated  surface  with  a   protein<br>
composition   and  allowing  it  to  cross   link    and polymerize iii)  subjecting the polymerized surface  to the step of<br>
tyophilization.<br><br>
The present invention provides methods for coating<br>
surfaces of  polymeric  materials using  cryoprecipitate obtained  from human plasma, bovine   thrombin,  gelatin<br>
from porcine skin and  growth factors isolated from calf hypothalamus.    After  coating  the  surface   with   a<br>
composition  of  above proteins, the  material  is  left between  30°C  to  40°C  for  the  thrombin  to  act   on<br>
fibrinogen   in  the  cryoprecipitate  to  form   fibrin monomers,  which  is subsequently cross  linked  by  the<br>
activated FXIII to form a net work in which gelatin  and growth  factors are retained -  The proteins thus  coated<br>
on the surface is then subjected to a freeze—drying step so  that fibrin network holding  the growth factors  and<br>
gelatin  is  stabilized on the surface.   The  composite coated  surfaces  showed minimal platelet  adhesion  and<br>
throfflbogenesis compared to the bare surfaces.<br>
This  invention  also relates to  the  accelerated<br>
proliferation of the endothelial ceils on the  composite coated surface.  The cells grown on  the surface  seemed<br>
to  be physiologically active, having good nitric  oxide production, expressed low density lipoproteins, was  not<br>
thrombogenic  and resisted shear stress when exposed  to flow.<br><br>
Details of the Invention;<br>
I<br>
1.	The present invention provides a composition of different proteins as a composite to coat polymeric surfaces. The polymeric material used is either polystyrene, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, or expanded polytetra fluoroethylene and may be in the form of circular or square pieces or as conduits.<br>
2.	According to one aspect of the invention, the polymeric material is initially incubated for 15 to 30 min in a solution of thrombin, 10 to 50 I U per ml, dissolved in 10 mM to 50 mM CaCl2 solution. The thrombin solution is added in a proportion of 0.5 ml to 1ml per cm2 material. After the incubation period, which is done between 30 to 40oC, the excess thrombin solution is aspirated out.<br>
3.	According tO; a related aspect of the invention, a fibrinogen concentrate obtained from human plasma as cryoprecipitate and stored as lyophilised powder is dissolved in DAA/ to get a concentration of 10 to 30 mg of total protein per ml. The solution of fibrinogen concentrate is mixed with an equal volume of 2% skin gelatin   prepared by autoclaving gelatin in distilled water. To this fibrinogen concentrate 250 to 500 ug of endothelial cell growth factor is also added. The composite solution containing fibrinogen, FXIII, gelatin and endothelial cell growth factors is mixed well. Fifty to 200 ul of this composite solution is then layered over thrombin absorbed surface. The material is then incubated between 30oC  to 40oC for 30 min to 60 min.<br>
E.g.1. Bovine thrombin (E.Merck, Germany) is adsorbed on the surface. Human fibhnogen concentrate obtained as cryoprecipitate is mixed with porcine skin gelatin (tissue culture grade obtained from Sigma Chem. USA), endothelial cell growth factors isolated by a standard method, from calf hypothalamus.<br>
4.	In another aspect of the invention the composite coated material is frozen at<br>
temperature ranging from -50oC  to -70oC  for a period of 2 to 24 h. The frozen<br>
material with the composite coating is then transferred to a lyophilizer and freeze<br><br>
dried at a temperature of -40°C to -55°C and negative pressure of 10 ' to 10-2 torr, for a period of 2 to 12 h.<br>
The polymeric material surfaces thus coated with the composite and stabilized by lyophilization has a thin uniform network of fibrin enmeshed with the growth factors and gelatin. Since the stabilization is done at a low temperature, the growth factors and the mitogenic fibrinopeptide generated during the action of thrombin on fibrinogen is expected to be biologically active. 5. In order to show that the growth factors are retained for a sufficient period for the seeded endothelial cells to consume, a release kinetics of proteins/peptides from the coating was measured.  Chromoproteins such as hemoglobin and cytochrome C were used, to measure the release kinetics, because it has similar molecular weights as the growth factors, and it is easy to quantitate from their Soret band absorbance. In this aspecct of the invention we have incorporated hemoglobin, and cytochrome C, into the composite. The release of the protein into the serum containing medium is estimated using a standard calibration curve that is generated with known concentrations of the chromoproteins. diluted in serum containing medium. The calibration curve is used to estimate the concentration of the protein released into the medium for a period of 120h. at an interval of 24 h. The medium is drawn from the tissue culture wells, first after 5 min after exposure to the medium, and then after every 24h. We found that till 96h, there is a steady release of the chromoproteins into the medium. This result confirmed that the coating technique used is efficient to retain the growth factors within the fibrin network. The uniformity of the network is visualised inder the microscope after staining the coated surface with Coomassie blue. 6. According to another aspect of the invention, we also tested the attachment and proliferation of endothelial cells on the coated composite matnx. The edothelial cellsare isolated from human umbelical cord vein. The vein of the umbelical cord is flushed several times with Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) and 0.1% collagenase in serum free MCDB is filled in the cannulated vein. After 5 min cells are resuspended in serum containing MCDB and cells are<br><br>
seeded onto a polystyrene culture flask coated with 0.1% gelatin. After 4 days, cells are harvested by treatment with 0.5% trypsin. The cells are washed and subcultured in another set of gelatin coated culture plates. These second passage ceils are harvested after 3 days and seeded on the composite coated surface. In 48h, a confluent monolayer is formed on the composite. The morphology of the cells grown on gelatin alone, fibrin alone and the composite are compared.<br>
7.	In another embodiment of the invention, the growth rate of the endothelial<br>
cells from the same passage is compared on gelatin coated, fibrin coated, and<br>
composite coated surfaces. The lyophilized surfaces with either fibrin or<br>
composite coating is rinsed with culture medium to remove excess thrombin.<br>
Equal number of cells harvested from the second passage grown on gelatin<br>
coated polystyrene dishes are then seeded on gelatin coated-, fibrin coated-, or<br>
composite coated polymeric material such as PTFE or Dacron. The cell<br>
attchment and spreading is monitored after 2h. The attachement and spreading<br>
are similar on fibrin coated- and composite coated surfaces, whereas on gelatin<br>
coated surface spreading is poor. By 48h, it is found that on the composite<br>
coated surface, the cells proliferated into a confluent monolayer, whereas on the<br>
fibrin-coated and gelatin coated surfaces confluent monolayer is formed by 72h<br>
or later. Thus an embodiment of this invention shows that endothelial cells<br>
attach similarly on fibrin and composite whereas proliferation on the composite is<br>
much better than that on the fibrin alone,<br>
8.	According to another aspect of the invention', it is also shown here that the<br>
fibrin coated on the surface is stable and is not lysed into fibrin degradation<br>
products during cell culture. To estimate fibrin degradation during endothelial<br>
cell culture, the tissue culture medium is collected at 24 h intervals during cell<br>
culture. Using an agglutination kit obtained from Diagnostica Stage we<br>
estimated the FDP in the culture media. There is no detectable level of FDP in<br>
the culture media for upto 7 days.<br><br>
9.	To measure the physiological activity of the endothelial cells, the cell<br>
monolayer grown on the composite coated surface is incubated with serum-free<br>
medium for 24h and the medium is taken for NO assay. A NO production in the<br>
range 2-3 nM per 0.5x106 cells are detected.<br>
10.	In another aspect of the invention we also demonstrated that the composite<br>
coated surface with endothelial cell monolayer is less thombogenic compared to<br>
the bare surface. The endothelialized surface is exposed to platelet rich plasma<br>
in a parellel plate flow chamber (fabricated according to Baumgartner's design).<br>
The perfusion of PRP is attained using a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 4 ml<br>
per min or 8 ml per min. After exposure of the surface to the PRP for 30 mm. the<br>
surface is rinsed with serum-free culture medium and the surface is fixed in 2%<br>
glutaraldehyde for 2h. The surface is then stained with Leishman's to view the<br>
adhered platelets. The adherence of platelets are estimated by counting several<br>
fields. The effect of the endothelialised monolayer on platelet activation in the<br>
PRP is assessed by measuring the response to agonist of exposed platelet rich<br>
plasma using a Chronplog platelet aggregometer. The platelet rich plasma after<br>
perfusion through the chamber without any materials served as the control After<br>
perfusion through a chamber holding an endothelialised surface, the PRP<br>
responded to agonists similar to the control PRP.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
