				<td>I~munophilins were originally discovered and studied<br>
ir. the immune tissue.  It was initially postulated by<br>
these  skilled  in the  art  that  inhibition of  the<br>
uncphiiins' rotamase activity leads to inhibition of.<br>
7-ceil   proliferation,    thereby   causing   the<br>
immunesuppressive activity exhibited by immunosupcressant<br>
drugs,  such as  cyclcspcrin A,  FX506  and rapamycin.<br>
Further study has shewn that the inhibition of rotamase<br>
activity,  in  and cf  itself,  does  not  result  in<br>
i~muncsuppressive activity.  Schreiber et al., Science,<br>
1390, vol. 25C, pp. 55c-553.  Instead, immunosuppression<br>
appears to stem from the. formulation of a complex of<br>
irnmuncsuppressar.t drugs and irnmuncphilins.  It has been<br>
shown that the i-muncphilin-drug complexes interact with<br>
ternary protein  targets,, as  their  mode  of  action.<br>
Schreiber et al. , Call, 19S1, vol. 56, pp. 807-815.  In<br>
the  case  of  FK3F-FK506  and  cyclophilin-CsA,  the<br>
iT.muncchilin-drug  complexes  bind  to  the  enzyme<br>
calcineurin and inhibit the T-cell receptor signalling<br>
which leads to T-cell proliferation.   Similarly,  the<br>
immunophj-lin-drug complex of FK3P-rapamycin interacts<br>
with  the RAFT1/FRA? protein  and  inhibits  the  IL-2<br>
receptor signalling.<br>
Immunophilins have been found to be present at high concentrations in the central nervous system. Immunochilins are enriched 1.0-50 times more in the<br>
central nervous system tnan in the immune system. Within neural tissues, immunophilins appear to influence nitric oxide synthesis, neurotransmitter release and neurcnal process extension.<br>
It has been found that picomolar concentrations cf an immunosuppressant such as FK5Q6 and rapamycin stimulate neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells and sensory neurons, namely dorsal root ganglion cells (DRGs) . Lyons et al., Proc. of Nad. Acad. Sci., 1994, vol. 91, pp. 3191-3195. In whole animal experiments, FX506 has been shown to stimulate nerve regeneration following facial -nerve injury.'<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that certain compounds with a high affinity for FKBPs are potent rotamase inhibitors and exhibit excellent neurotrcphic effects. Furthermore, these rotamase inhibitors are devoid of immunosuppressive activity. These findings suggest the use of rotamase inhibitors in treating various peripheral neuropathies and enhancing neuronal regrowth in the central nervous system (CNS). Studies have demonstrated that neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may occur due to the loss, or decreased availability, of a neurotrophic substance specific: for a particular population of neurons affected in the disorder.<br>
Several ' neurotrcphic factors affecting specific neuronai populations in the central nervous system have been identified. For example, it has been hypothesized that Alzheimer's disease results from a decrease or loss of nerve growth factor (NGF). It has thus been proposed to treat SDAT patients with exogenous nerve growth factor or other neurotrophic proteins, such as brain derived growth factor, glial derived growth factor, ciliary neurotrcphic factor and neurotrcpin-3, to increase the survival of degenerating neuronai populations.<br>
Clinical application of these proteins in various neurological disease states is hampered by difficulties in the delivery and bioavailability of large proteins to nervous system targets. By contrast, immunosuppressant drugs with neurotrophic activity are relatively small and display excellent bioavailability and specificity. However, when administered chronically, immunosuppressant drugs exhibit a number of potentially serious side effects including nephrotoxicity, such as impairment of glomerular filtration and irreversible interstitial fibrosis (Kopp et al. , <j. am. soc. nephroi. neurological deficits such as involuntary></j.>
tremors, or non-specific cerebral angina, such as non-localized headaches (De Groen et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 1987,   317:861.);   and  vascular  hypertension  with complications resulting therefrom (Kahan et al. , N. Engl.<br>
In order tc prevent the side effects associated with use of the irr.r.unc suppressant compounds, the present invention provides ncn-immunosuppressive compounds containing small molecule FK3P rotamase inhibitors for enhancing neurite outgrowth, and promoting neurcnal growth and regeneration in various neuropathoiogical situations where neuronal repair can be facilitated, including: peripheral nerve damage caused by physical injury or disease state such as diabetes; physical damage to the central nervous system (spinal cord and brain); brain damage, associated with stroke; and neurological disorders relating to neurodegeneration, such as Parkinson's disease, SDA7 (Alzheimer's disease), and amyo.trophic lateral sclerosis.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates tc neurotrophic low molecular weight, small molecule compounds having an affinity for FKB?-type immunophilins. Once bound to these proteins, the neurctrophic compounds are potent inhibitors of the enzyme activity associated with immunophilin proteins, particularly peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, or rctamase, enzyme activity. A key feature of the compounds cf the present invention is that they do not exert any significant immunosuppressive activity in<br><br>

As discussed above, the compounds of the presenc invention have an affinity for the FX5C6 binding protein, particularly FK3P12. The inhibition of the prolyl peptidyi cis-trans isomerase activity of FKB? may be measured as an indicator of this affinity.<br>
Ki Test Procedure<br>
Inhibition of the peptidyi-prolyl isomerase (rotamase) activity of the inventive compounds can be evaluated by known methods described in the literature (Harding, et al., Nature, 1989, 341:758-760; Holt et al. J". Am. Chem. Soc. , 115:9923-9938). These values are obtained as apparent Ki's and are presented in Table III. The cis-trans isomerization of an alanine-proline bond in a model subscrate, N-succinyi-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, is monitored spectrcphccometricaliy in a chymotrypsin-coupled assay, which releases para-nitroanilide from the trans form of the "substrate. The inhibition,._of__this reaction caused fay the addition of different concentrations of inhibitor is determined, and the data is analyzed as a change in first-order rate constant as a function of inhibitor concentration to yield the apparent Ki values.<br>
In a plastic cuvette are added 950 mL of ice cold assay buffer (25 mM KEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl), 10 mL of FK3? (2.5 mM in 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, i mM dithicchreicoi) , 25 mL cf chymotrypsin (50 mg/mi in 1 mM HCI} and 10 mL of test compound at various concentrations in dimethyl suifoxide. The reaction is initiated by the addition of 5 mL cf substrate (succinyl-Ala-Phe-Pro-Phe-para-nitroanilide, 5 mg/mL in 2.35 mM LiCl in trifiucroethanol).<br>
The absorbance an 390 nm versus time is monitored for 90 seconds using a spectrophotometer and the rate constants are determined from the absorbance versus time data files.<br>
The daca for these experiments for representative compounds are presented in Table III under the column " Ki" .<br>
The neurctrophic effects of the compounds of the<br>
••*	•<br>
present:  invention  can be  demonstrated  in  cellular biological experiments in vitro, as described below.<br>
Chick Dorsal Root Ganglion Cultures and Neurite Outgrowth<br>
Dorsal root ganglia were dissected from chick embryos of ten day gestation. Whole ganglion explants were cultured' on thin layer Matrigel-coated 12 well plates with Liebcvitz L15 plus high glucose media<br>
supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum, and also containing 10 µM cvtosine S-D arabincfuranoside (Ara C) at 37°C in an environment containing 5% CO.. Twenty-four hours later, the DRGs were treated with various immunophiiin licands. Forty-eight hours after drug treatment, the ganglia were visualized under phase contrast or Hoffman Modulation contrast with a Zeiss Axicvert inverted microsccce. Photomicrographs of the explants were made, and neurite outgrowth was quantitated. Neurites longer than the DRG diameter were counted as positive, with total number of neuritss quantitated per each experimental condition. Three to four DRGs are cultured per well, and each treatment was performed in duplicate.<br>
The data for these experiments for representative compounds are presented in the "ED50" column of Table III. Representative photomicrographs of compounds 1. (1 pM, 10 pM, 100 pM) and 2 (10 pM, 100 pM, 10 uM) promoting neurite outgrowth in sensory neurons are shown in FIG.'s 1(A-C) and 2(A-C) , respectively.<br>
