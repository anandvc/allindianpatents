				<td>This invention relates to a cooking utensil. More particularly this invention relates to a cooking utensil having a body (that may be a plate, a pan or a vessel) provided with at least one handle made of a thermally non-conducting material and which is placed on a stove for heating.<br>
Plates, pans and vessels provided on their sides with one or two handles made of a thermally non-conducting material such as plastic or wood are in day-to-day use in the kheben for cooking various foods. These are placed on a stove and the heat transmitted upwards heats up the foody of the cooking utensil and its handle. In course of time the beat labile handle is damaged. Often the flames of the stove eat up part or whole of the handle and it is a common sight to see old cooking utensils with flame eaten handles. At times this is the only reason for purchasing a new cooking utensil for The family. The damage to the handles is all the more evident when cooking is done on open stoves burning wood or other biomass and mis is the main reason why pressure cookers have not become popular in rural India thereby preventing the saving of valuable fuel. Attempts have been made in the prior art to provide a flame guard between the body of the cooking utensil and its handle. Thus a metal block or metal member is riveted on the utensil wall and the synthetic or wooden handle screwed on to the said metal block or member spaced sideward from the body of the utensil. It is expected by the designers that the flames of the stove passing upwards by the side of the body of the cooking utensil would touch only the said metal biock(s) and would spare the attached non-conducting handles. But this is far from the case. The handles of these utensils are also slowly eaten away especially towards their central ends. In addition to the flames the heat transmitted upward from the stove also causes denaturisation of the synthetic handles making them to wear out in course of time. One method to avoid this is to increase the radial length of the intervening metal blocks. But this would result in a weakly fitted handle and less efficient means of lifting the cooking utensil on handles fitted widely spaced from the body of the utensil. For cooking utensils having a handle (made of a non-conducting material) fitted directly on to the body of the utensil or on to the said body through a metal member, protection of the central end of the said heat labile handle is crucial in that the means of attachment of the said handle is usually situated towards the central end of the said handle and if this part is damaged the whole handle would soon fall down from the utensil. As such a heat shield for the central end of the handle is desirable even for cooking utensils having a metal flame guard member (on which said handle is attached spaced from the body of the utensil). The provision of a metal plate touching the non-conducting handle towards its central end would shift the hold on the handle peripherally because of the raised temperature of this metal plate during cooking. In the prior patent EP 0 499 057 Al a narrow portion is provided between the gripping portion and the attachment portion of me handle in order to<br><br>
reduce the beat transmitted to the gripping portion. There is no heat shield provided for the handle of the body of the cooking utensil. Patent application No.l46/MAS/2001 is a co-pending application dealing with handles of cooking utensils.<br>
The object of mis invention is to propose a means whereby the non-conducting handles can be adequately protected from the heat transmitted upwards from the stove, said means also enabling a more central hold on the handles to be taken for titling the body of the cooking utensil dun is possible with conventional methods. Another object of mis invention is to provide a shield for protecting the hands of the operator from the beat and flames of dw stove when the cooking utensil is being placed on or lifted from the stove holding on to the non-conducting handles of the utensil.<br>
Accordingly this invention provides a cooking utensil having a body (V) and at least one handle (H) made of a tiiermally non-conducting material such as plastic or wood provided on the said body projecting sideward from the said body, characterized in that said handle has a holding member (D) for lifting the utensil, a heat shield (F) comprising a plate made of a heat stable material such as metal is provided extending outwards under the said handle for a radial length of at least I cm beyond the central end of said holding member (D) and for a breadth of at least half the breaddi of the adjoining part of said handle, and said heat shield is positioned under and spaced by at least 1 cm from the said holding member (D) of the said handle so as to allow at least the tips of the human fingers to be positioned between me said holding member and the said heat shield for lining the utensil, said heat shield intercepting the heat transmitted upwards from the stove on which the utensil is placed.<br>
The part of the handle which can be held by passing the fingers underneath it would be considered as a holding member of the handle and the cooking utensil can be easily lifted up by holding on to the said holding members). The holding member D preferably has a radial lengdi of at least 1 cm or ideally more dian 2 cm. A gap of at least 1cm is usually needed for passing me tips of the human fingers between the holding member of the handle and the heat shield for lining the cooking utensil. For passing the fingers a gap of at least 1.5 cm is preferable. And for gripping with the fingers a gap of at least 2 cm is ideal. Also the radial outward extension of the heat shield from the central end of the holding member should preferably be at least 1 cm for providing protection for the tips and at feast 1.5 cm for providing protection for the body of tite fingers and at least 2,5 cm for providing protection for the hand of the operator. The invention permits a more central hold on the handle to be taken by the operator ttian is possible with the existing methods employing the conventional flame guard members. A handle may comprise of only the holding member whereas in another embodiment the handle has a finger guard member<br><br>
positioned spaced below the said holding member so as to allow at least the tips of the human fingers to be positioned between the said holding member and the finger guard member for lifting the utensil - the gap may preferably be at least 1 cm, the usual being 1.5 cm or more (for enabling the fingers to be introduced in the said gap). The holding member may be held with lesser gaps underneath when a finger guard member is present, as the hot heat shield would not then hurt the fingers of the operator.<br>
Accordingly this invention provides a cooking utensil having a body (V) and at least one handle (H) made of a thermally non-conducting material such as plastic or wood provided on the said body projecting sideward from the said body, characterized in that said handle has (i) a holding member (D) for lifting me utensil and (ii) a finger guard member (N) positioned spaced below the said holding member (D), and a heat shield (F) comprising a plate made of a heat stable material such as metal is provided extending outwards under the said finger guard member, so as to allow at least the tips of me human fingers to be positioned between me said holding member and the said finger guard member for lifting me utensil, said heat shield intercepting the heat transmitted upwards from the stove on which the utensil is placed.<br>
The finger guard member may preferably be positioned spaced from the said heat shield. The finger guard member N of the handle is the part of the handle directly above the heat shield F and is positioned spaced (preferably by at least 1 cm) from the holding member D of the handle for passing at least the tips of me human fingers for lifting the cooking utensil. It is desirable though not necessary that the finger guard member N and the holding member D form integral parts of the non-conducting handle H. The finger guard member may be separate and fitted spaced from tile holding member. Also the finger guard member made of a tiiermally non¬conducting material may be provided on the top surface of the heat shield F and fitted through the said heat shield.<br>
Flame guard members of the prior art comprise of a metal strap or rod extending from the body of the cooking utensil to the non-conducting handle. It may also be a metal strap ring provided between the body of the cooking utensil and the non-conducting handle. In some cases it may also be a metal plate closely clad on to the undersurface of the central end of the non¬conducting handle. The holding member D of the handle in such a case would be the part of the handle peripheral to the said metal plate or member as the metal clad part of the handle cannot be held safely when the metal plate is hot. A distinction may be made between those cooking utensils having two short handles lifted with almost equal force by the two hands of the operator and tttose utensils having an elongated handle lifted mainly or solely with one hand of the<br><br>
operator. The commonly used pressure cookers, fiying pans and sauce pans come under the latter category. In the preferred embodiments of the latter type of cooking utensils having a handle with an elongated holding member having a radial length of at least 6 cm, the said heat shield extends outwards under the said handle for a radial length of at least 2.5 cm fiom the central end of said holding member and breadth of at least half the breadth of the adjoining part of said handle and is positioned under and spaced by at least 2 cm from the said holding member of the said handle so as to allow the utensil to be lifted holding mainly or solely on the said elongated holding member. The fingers of one hand would usually encircle the holding member when these utensils are lifted mainly with one hand and hence the necessity of providing a larger gap between the said holding member and the heat shield. The gap between the holding member and the finger guard member in these utensils is usually at least 1.5 cm. The heat shield extending over at least one third the radial length of the handle (measured from the central end of said handle) and positioned directly under and spaced by at least 2 cms from the holding member D of the handle would provide adequate protection in most of the cases. For giving maximum protection for the hands of me operator when lining the utensil from the stove, the heat shield extends outwards under the said handle for a radial length of at least 4 cms from the central end of said holding member D and for a breadth of at least the breadth of the adjoining part of said handle and is positioned directly under and spaced by at least 3 cm from the holding member of the said handle. The heat shield F is fitted on to the body wall of the cooking utensil and/or on to the metal flame guard member J and/or on to the non-conducting handle H and extends outwards from the said body wall or from the flame guard member J or from the central end of the non-conducting handle H spaced from the holding member D of the handle.<br>
In a practical model the heat shield when viewed from the side is erect or inverted L shaped with the vertical limb of the L attached to the said body of the utensil or on to a metal flame guard member attached to the said body (said metal flame guard member providing the means for spaced attachment of the said handle from the said body). This fixing of the said vertical limb of the heat shield is usually done by means of screws, rivets or by welding. In an easily made model, me heat shield is erect L shaped and the means for fixing the said handle on to me body of the cooking utensil also provides me means for fixing the said vertical limb of the L on to the body of the utensil. In a preferred embodiment me heat shield extends over the entire undersurface of the said handle or also beyond its limits so as to protect the handle adequately. Two such handles with heat shield members are provided in appropriate cases, said handles being provided on opposite sides of the said body of the utensil for lifting the utensil wfth bom hands of the operator. The cooking utensils according to the invention are also provided wtm<br><br>
lids for efficient cooking. Pans or vessels, which are cup shaped, are subject to the maximum heat insult on their handles and are greatly benefited by the heat shield according to the invention. The invention may be applied with benefit to a cooking vessel having a neck narrower tfian its body. The invention is particularly relevant for ordinary cooking vessels used in the kitchen, which have a volume capacity ranging between half a litre and 80 litres. The handles of these household vessels are preferably disposed in the upper half of the vessel for efficient lifting. Means for rigid fitting of the non-conducting handles) to the vessel is also usually provided. The flames of me domestic stoves are unlikely to reach up to a gt«at height Therefore the vessel comprising the body of said cooking utensil has the non-conducting handfe(s) H disposed at a height of less than 75 cms from the base of the vessel. Also a heat shield F disposed at least 2.5 cms above the base of said cooking utensil is preferable, as it would not then get very hot during cooking.<br>
Several commonly used cooking utensils having non-conducting handles may be provided with the heat shield according to the invention so as to protect the handles from heat damage. Thus the body of me cooking utensil may constitute the body of a pressure cooker, said body being provided with a lid, a safety valve and means for fitting said lid on to the said body through a gasket so as to provide a seal. The heat shield for me handles may also be provided on a milk cooker with a double walled cup shaped body, the top ends of the two walls being hermetically sealed so as to enclose an outer jacket between me two walls for filling with water, means provided for fitting a whistle on to the outer wall of said cup shaped body such that the mourn of said whistle opens into me cavity of said outer jacket in the fitted position of the whistle. Anotfier cooking utensil comprises a vessel shaped body and a lid and means are provided for fitting a whistle on top of said lid such that the mourn of said whistle opens into the cavity of me utensil in the fitted position of the whistle and the said lid. The whistle in me above utensils comprises a whistle tongue housed within a whistle body, said whistle body enclosing a blind or open cavity communicating witit the mourn of the whistle dirough a narrow orifice situated by the side of said whistle tongue and with the exterior through another opening situated on the wall of the whistle body close to the said narrow orifice. Another cooking utensil comprises a vessel and a ltd and at least one plate, tray or cup for holding the food to be cooked with means provided for holding said plate, tray or cup in the horizontal plane wimin the utensil spaced from the bottom of the utensil. These utensils are usually used as steam cookers. Another cooking utensil has a stainless steel body wim a plate or layer made of a more thermally conducting material such as copper or aluminum provided under the base of said body attached to me said body. This attachment is usually an integral attachment.<br><br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein: Fig.l: is the side elevation of a cooking utensil according to the invention; Fig.2: is the sectional elevation of the utensil shown in Fig. I, the section being taken in the plane Y-Y shown in Fig. 1;<br>

of the handle is the part of the handle directly above the heat shield F (and below me holding member D) and it protects the hands of the operator from touching the heat shield F (which is likely to be hot when the cooker is placed on a stove). The spacing between the holding member and the finger guard member is usually at least 1 cm or preferably at least 1.5 cm. The finger guard members shown in the figures are all an integral part of the non-conducting handle of the cooking utensil. But though mis is convenient it is not always mandatory. The finger guard member (made of a non-conducting material) may be a separate piece fitted independently or it may also be provided on the upper surface of the heat shield and fitted through the heat shield. But even in such cases it performs the functions of a non-conducting handle in protecting the hands of the operator and will be considered a part of the non-conducting handle of the utensil.<br>
In the cooking utensil shown in Figs. 1-2 the handle H is fixed to the body (a vessel) of the utensil by passing the screw S on to the metal clamp C that is riveted on to me metal wall of the vessel, as is the conventional practice. The upwardly directed short vertical limb of the L shaped heat shield is riveted on to the vessel wall by two rivets R. The finger guard member N is also positioned spaced from tile heat shield F so as to reduce the heat transmission to the non¬conducting handle to a minimum.<br>
In me cooking utensil shown in Fig.3, the handle H wholly comprises of the holding member D and the heat shield F is a folded metal plate mat is fixed at its two central ends on to the body (a vessel) of me utensil. This is particularly useful for dun metal plates. The heat shield F for this embodiment extends outwards for a radial lengm of at least 1 cm beyond the central end of the non-conducting handle H (the holding member), said heat shield having at least half the breadth of said handle and is positioned under and spaced by 2 cm from the said non-conducting handle H.<br>
In the cooking utensil shown in Fig.4, me handle H is fixed to me body V (a vessel) of the utensil through a metal flame guard member J, as is the conventional practice. The handle has an integral finger guard member N with a gap for passing me fingers between me holding member D and the finger guard member N. The heat shield F is attached towards its central and peripheral ends to me under side of the handle H by fixing screws (not shown) and the central end of me heat shield extends towards the vessel wall so as to shield the central end of the non¬conducting handle from the heat transmitted upwards.<br>
In the handle of the cooking utensil shown in Fig.5, there is a recess Q between the holding member D and the finger guard member N of the said handle, said recess has a height of at least 1 cm, breadth of at least 2 cms and depth of at least 1 cm, the fingers being introduced into the said recess for lifting the cooker. The preferred gap between the handle block D (holding<br><br>
member) and the handle block N (finger guard member) is at least 1.5cm. The heat shield F is a plate folded at its two ends and is fitted within the longitudinal grooves on the handle H spaced from the holding member D of the handle.<br>
In the cooking utensil shown in Fig.6, the handle H made of a non-conducting material is, fixed to the body V (comprising the metal plate V) of the utensil through a metal flame guard member J which is usually a bent rod(s) or strap(s), the heat shield F comprising a metal plate being fitted to the said metal member J as shown so as to block the heat transmitted upwards.<br>
In the embodiments illustrated the heat shield F protects the non-conducting handle H and the fingers of the operator from the heat transmitted upwards from the stove. The heat shield positioned spaced from the holding member of the handle permits a more central hold on the handles to be taken for lifting the utensil than is possible with the conventional metal flame guard members. The finger guard member when present protects the fingers of me operator from the hot heat shield. The invention should not be construed to be limited to the embodiments illustrated but has a broad scope in enabling the protection of the non-conducting handle(s) of all cooking utensils (that are placed on stoves) employing the principles herein set form.<br><br><br>
