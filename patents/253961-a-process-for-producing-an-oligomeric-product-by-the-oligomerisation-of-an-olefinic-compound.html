				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to the oligomerisation of olefinic compounds in an aliphatic liquid medium to produce oligomers.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
Conventional ethylene oligomerisation technologies produce a range of α-olefins following either a Schulz-Flory or Poisson product distribution. By definition, these mathematical distributions limit the mass % of the tetramer that can be formed and make a distribution of products. In this regard, it is known from prior art (US patent 6,184,428) that a nickel catalyst comprising a chelating ligand, preferably 2-diphenyl phosphino benzoic acid (DPPBA),  a nickel precursor, preferably    NiCI2.6H2O,    and    a    catalyst    activator,    preferably    sodium tetraphenylborate, catalyse the oligomerisation of ethylene to yield a mixture of linear olefins containing 1-octene. The selectivity towards linear C8   -olefins is claimed to be 19%. Similarly the Shell Higher Olefins Process (SHOP process, US patents 3,676,523 and 3,635,937) using a similar catalyst system is reported to typically yield 11 mass % 1-octene in its product mixture (Chem Systems PERP reports 90-1, 93-6 and 94/95S12). <br>
Ziegler-type technologies based on trialkylaluminium catalysts, independently developed by Gulf Oil Chemicals Company (Chevron-Phillips, e.g. DE patent 1,443,927) and Ethyl Corporation (BP-Amoco, e.g. US patent 3,906,053), are also commercially used to oligomerise ethylene to mixtures of olefins that reportedly contain 13-25 mass % 1-octene (Chem Systems PERP reports 90-1, 93-6, and94/95S12).<br>
The prior art also teaches that chromium-based catalysts containing heteroatomic ligands with both phosphorus and nitrogen heteroatoms selectively catalyse the trimerisation of ethylene to 1-hexene. Examples of such heteroatomic ligands for ethylene trimerisation include bis(2-diethylphosphino-ethyl) amine (WO 03/053891) as well as (o-methoxyphenyl)2PN(methyl)P(o-methoxyphenyl)2 (WO 02/04119). Both these catalyst systems and processes are very specific for the production of 1 -hexene.<br>
Processes wherein transition metals and heteroatomic ligands are combined to form catalysts for trimerisation, tetramerisation, oligomerisation and polymerisation of olefinic compounds have also been described in WO 03,053890, WO 03'053891, WO 04/056479, WO 04/056477, WO 04/056478, WO 04/056480 and South African provisional patent application number 2004/3805.<br><br>
It has now been found that the oligomerisation of olefinic compounds by catalysts containing a transition metal and a ligand can be enhanced by carrying out the reaction in an aliphatic medium. In processes according to the present invention aliphatic solvents such as cyclohexane provided more active reaction systems compared to aromatic solvents, which can reduce catalyst consumption significantly. In at least some cases it has also been found that aliphatic solvents such as cyclohexane had the effect that the catalysts were less prone to deactivation at temperatures above 45QC compared to reactions where aromatic solvents were used at the same temperatures. Certain activators such as MMAO had also shown improved activity and stability of the catalyst when used in aliphatic solvents such as cyclohexane. Increased pressures also enhanced the reaction.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for producing an oligomeric product by the oligomerisation of at least one olefinic compound in the form of an olefin or a compound including an olefinic moiety by contacting the at least one olefinic compound with an oligomerisation catalyst in an aliphatic liquid medium  at a  reaction  temperature  of at least 50°C,  wherein  the catalyst comprises the combination of i)      a source of a transition metal; and ii)     a ligating compound of the formula<br><br>
(RXX1 (Y)X2(R?)n<br>
wherein:        X1 and Xr are independently selected from the group consisting of N, P, As, Sb, Bi, O, S and Se ; Y is a linking group between X' and X2; m and n are independently 0, 1 or a larger integer; and R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen, a hydrocarbyl group or a heterohydrocarbyl group, and R1 being the same or different when m&gt;1, and R2 being the same or different when n&gt;1.<br>
In this specification an aliphatic liquid medium is at least one liquid aliphatic compound, that is an acyclic or a cyclic organic compound, including a saturated and/or an unsaturated carbon compound, but excluding an aromatic compound.<br>
Oligomeric product<br>
The oligomeric product may be an olefin, or a compound including an olefinic moiety. Preferably the oligomeric product comprises an olefin, more preferably an olefin containing a single carbon-carbon double bond, and preferably it comprises an -olefin. The olefin product may comprise hexene, preferably 1-hexene, but more preferably it comprises octene, preferably 1-octene. The<br><br>
oligomeric product may comprise a mixture of hexene and octene, preferably a mixture of 1-hexene and 1-octene.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention the oligomerisation process is a selective process to produce a product containing more than 30% by mass of a single olefin product, preferably octene, and more preferably 1-octene. Preferably the product contains at least 35% of the olefin, preferably -olefin, preferably 1-octene, but it may be more than 40%, 50%, 60% or even 70% by mass.<br>
The olefinic product may be branched, but preferably it is non-branched. Oligomerisation<br>
The oligomerisation process may comprise a trimerisation process, but preferably it comprises a tetramerisation process.<br>
The process may be oligomerisation of two or more different olefinic units to produce an oligomer containing the reaction product of the two or more different olefinic units. Preferably however, the oligomerisation (preferably tetramerisation) comprises the oligomerisation of identical monomer olefinic units.<br><br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention the oligomerisation process is oligomerisation of a single -olefin to produce an oligomeric -olefin. Preferably it comprises the tnmerisation and/or tetramerisation of ethylene, preferably to 1-hexene and/or 1-octene.<br>
Olefinic compound<br>
The olefinic compound may comprise a single olefinic compound or a mixture of olefinic compounds. In one embodiment of the invention it may comprise a single olefin.<br>
The olefin may include multiple carbon-carbon double bonds, but preferably it comprises a single carbon-carbon double bond. The olefin may comprise an -olefin with 2 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 10 carbon atoms. The olefinic compound may be selected from the group consisting of ethylene, propene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, and 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 3-methy!-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, styrene, p-methyl styrene, 1-dodecene or combinations thereof. Preferably it comprises ethylene or propene, preferably ethylene. The ethylene may be used to produce hexene, preferably 1-hexene, and/or octene, preferably 1-octene.<br>
Aliphatic liquid .medium<br><br>
The aliphatic liquid medium may comprise a at least one acyclic compound, but preferably it comprises at least one cyclic compound. The cyclic compound may include one or more hetero-atoms (that is atoms other that H and C), but preferably it is a cyclic hydrocarbon, including a cyclic hydrocarbon wherein a hydrogen atom bound to a ring atom of the cyclic hydrocarbon is substituted with a hydrocarbyl, including an alkyl. The cyclic hydrocarbon may include one or more unsaturated carbon to carbon bonds, but preferably it comprises a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon. The ring structure defined by the saturated cyclic hydrocarbon may consist of 3 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably 5 to 8 carbon atoms. In one embodiment of the invention the ring structure defined by the saturated cyclic hydrocarbon may consist of 6 carbon atoms.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention the aliphatic liquid medium may comprise cyclohexane. Last mentioned compound is especially suitable from a product separation / solvent recycle point of view in trimerisation of ethylene.<br>
Alternatively, the aliphatic liquid medium may comprise a substituted cyclohexane wherein at least one (preferably only one) hydrogen atom of cyclohexane is substituted with a substitution moiety which is not H. The substitution moiety may comprise an organyl, preferably an alkyl. In one embodiment of the invention the aliphatic liquid medium may comprise methylcyclohexane. Last mentioned compound is especially suitable from a product separation solvent recycle point of view in tetramerisation of ethylene.<br><br>
It has been found that aliphatic liquid mediums such as cyclohexane provide higher reaction rates and catalyst stability (compared to aromatic liquid mediums) which can reduce catalyst usage. Aliphatic liquid mediums (e.g. cyclohexanes) are usually also more environmentally friendly than aromatic compounds.<br>
The aliphatic liquid medium may comprise a saturated acyclic compound such as one or more isoparaffins or mixtures of isoparaffins and linear paraffins, or linear paraffins, preferably it comprises the products known in the trade as, Norpar, and Isopar, and more preferably it comprises Isopar C due to ease of separation of products from the solvent.<br>
Preferably the liquid medium is an inert liquid medium.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the aliphatic liquid medium is a solvent of the olefinic compound and/or the oligomerisation catalyst, preferably of both.<br>
The aliphatic liquid medium may comprise a combination of one or more aliphatic compounds.<br>
Reaction Temperature<br><br>
The reaction temperature is at least 50°C, and preferably it is at least 60'C. The reaction temperature may be at least 80GC and at least 85 l-C and even as high as 100':C or higher and even 125QC. The reaction temperature may be from 50<br>
to 125(-C.<br>
It has been found that if oligomerisation reactions of this type were carried out in aromatic solvents the reaction temperature had to be limited to 459C or below as the higher temperatures result in faster deactivation of oligomerisation catalyst. It has now been found that if the reaction is carried out in an aliphatic solvent the catalyst is both less prone to deactivation at temperatures above 45SC and catalyst activity is still acceptable, even higher in at least some cases, at the higher temperatures.<br>
One disadvantage of having to limit the reaction temperature to a maximum of 45yC is heat removal becomes very expensive, either requiring refrigeration or very large cooling water exchangers for removal of the oligomerisation reaction exotherm.<br>
Most surprisingly it has also been found that in at least some cases at higher temperatures the oligomerisation process was more selective to high value oligomerisation products such as 1 -hexene and 1-octene.<br>
Pressure<br><br>
The reaction is preferably carried out at a pressure above 1000 kPa, more preferably at at least 4500 kPa, but even at at least 5000 kPa, even at at least 6000 kPa and even at at least 8000 kPa or even higher.<br>
Catalyst Activation<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the catalyst also includes one or more activators. Such an activator may be a compound that generates an active catalyst when the activator is combined with the source of transition metal and the ligating compound.<br>
Suitable activators include aluminium compounds, organoboron compounds, organic salts, such as methyl lithium and methyl magnesium bromide, inorganic acids and salts, such as tetrafluoroboric acid etherate, silver tetrafluoroborate, sodium hexafluoroantimonate and the like.<br>
Suitable aluminium compounds include compounds of the formula AI(R9)3 (R9 being the same or different), where each R9 is independently a d-C^ alkyl, an oxygen containing moiety or a halide, aluminoxanes, and compounds such as LiAIHj and the like. Aluminoxanes are well known in the art as typically oligomeric compounds which can be prepared by the controlled addition of water<br><br>
to an alkylaluminium compound, for example trimethylaluminium. Such<br>
compounds can be linear, cyclic, cages or mixtures thereof. Examples of suitable<br>
aluminium compounds in the form of organoaluminium activators include<br>
trimethylaluminium (TMA), triethylaluminium (TEA), tri-isobutylaluminium (TIBA),<br>
tri-n-octylaluminium, methylaluminium dichloride, ethylaluminium dichloride,<br>
dimethylaluminium chloride, diethylaluminium chloride, aluminium isopropoxide,<br>
ethylaluminiumsesquichloride,	methylaluminiumsesquichloride,<br>
methylaluminoxane (MAO), ethylaluminoxane (EAO), isobutylaluminoxane (iBuAO), modified alkylaiuminoxanes such as modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO).and mixture thereof.<br>
Examples of suitable organoboron compounds are boroxines, NaBH4, triethylborane, tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, trityl tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate, dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate, tributyl borate and the like.<br>
The activator may also be or contain a compound that acts as a reducing or oxidising agent, such as sodium or zinc metal and the like, or hydrogen or oxygen and the like.<br>
The activator may be selected from alkylaiuminoxanes such as nethylaluminoxane (MAO), high stability methylaluminoxane (MAO HS), 3thylaluminoxane (EAO), isobutylaluminoxane (iBuAO) as well as modified<br><br>
alkylaluminoxanes such as modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO). MMAO is described later in this specification.<br>
The transition metal source and the aluminoxane may be combined in proportions to provide AL'transition metal molar ratios from about 1:1 to 10 000:1, preferably from about 1:1 to 1000:1, and more preferably from 1:1 to 500:1.<br>
The process may include the step of adding to the catalyst system a trialkylaluminium compound in amounts of between 0.01 to 1000 mol per mol of alkylaluminoxane.<br>
It should be noted that aluminoxanes generally also contain considerable quantities of the corresponding trialkylaluminium compounds used in their preparation. The presence of these trialkylaluminium compounds in aluminoxanes can be attributed to their incomplete hydrolysis with water. Any quantity of a trialkylaluminium compound quoted in this disclosure is additional to alkylaluminium compounds contained within the aluminoxanes.<br>
t has been found that modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO) is especially suitable as an activator which may result in improved activity of the catalyst ncluding less deactivation of the catalyst.<br><br>
MMAO is methyl alurninoxane wherein one or more, but not all methyl groups have been replaced by one or more non-methyl moieties. Preferably the non-methyl moiety is an organyi, preferably a hydrocarbyl or a heterohydrocarbyl. Preferably it is an alkyl, preferably isobutyl or n-octyl.

The ligating compound may include a polymeric moiety to render the reaction product of the source of transition metal and the said ligating compound to be soluble at higher temperatures and insoluble at lower temperatures e.g. 25eC. This approach may enable the recovery of the complex from the reaction mixture for reuse and has been used for other catalyst as described by D.E. Bergbreiter et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1987, 109, 177-179. In a similar vein these transition metal catalysts can also be immobilised by binding the ligating compound to silica, silica gel, polysiloxane or alumina backbone as, for example, demonstrated by C. Yuanyin ef a!., Chinese J. React Pol., 1992, 1(2), 152-159 for immobilising platinum complexes.<br>
The ligating compound may include multiple ligating units or derivatives thereof.<br>
Non-limiting examples of such ligands include dendrimeric ligands as well as<br>
ligands where the individual ligating units are coupled either via one or more of<br>

The ligating compounds may be prepared using procedures known to one skilled in the art and procedures forming part of the state of the art.<br>
The oligomerisation catalyst may be prepared in situ, that is in the reaction mixture in which the oligomerisation reaction is to take place. Reaction mixture will be understood to include a reaction medium, reactants (olefinic compounds), reaction products and catalyst components. Typically the oligomerisation catalyst will be prepared in situ. However it is foreseen that the catalyst may be pre-formed or partly pre-formed.<br>
The source of transition metal and ligating compound may be combined (in situ or ex situ) to provide any suitable molar ratio, preferably a transition metal to ligand compound molar ratio, from about 0.01 :100 to 10 000 : 1, preferably from about 0.1 : 1 to 10:1.<br>
The process may also include combining one or more different sources of transition metal with one or more different ligating compounds.<br>
The oligomerisation catalyst or its individual components, in accordance with the invention, may also be immobilised by supporting it on a support material, for example, silica, alumina, MgCI2, zirconia, artificial hectorite or smectorite clays such as Laponite™ RD or mixtures thereof, or on a polymer, for example polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, or poly(aminostyrene). The catalyst<br><br>
can be formed in situ in the presence of the support material, or the support can be pre-impregnated or premixed, simultaneously or sequentially, with one or more of the catalyst components or the oligomerisation catalyst. In some cases, the support material can also act as a component of the activator. This approach would also facilitate the recovery of the catalyst from the reaction mixture for reuse.<br>
Process<br>
The olefinic compound or mixture thereof to be oligomerised according to this invention can be introduced into the process in a continuous or batch fashion.<br>
Preferably, the reaction conditions of the process are chosen such to produce oligomers (especially trimers and tetramers) in high yield by selectively converting an ethytenic feedstock such as ethylene.<br>
The process may include a process for the oligomerisation (especially tri- and/or tetramerisation) of ethylene or propylene or a mixture of olefins to yield an oligomerised product selectively.<br>
The individual components constituting the oligomerisation catalyst described herein may be combined simultaneously or sequentially in any order to give an active oligomerisation catalyst. The presence of an olefinic compound during the<br><br>
mixing of the catalyst components generally provides a protective effect which may result in improved catalyst performance.<br>
The reaction products derived from the oligomerisation reaction as described herein, may be prepared using the disclosed catalyst by a homogeneous liquid phase reaction.<br>
The reaction products derived from the oligomerisation reaction as described herein, may be prepared using the disclosed catalyst by a homogeneous liquid phase reaction in the presence or absence of an inert solvent, and/or by slurry reaction where the catalyst is in a form that displays little or no solubility, and/or a two-phase liquid/liquid reaction, and/or a bulk phase reaction in which neat reagent and/or product olefins serve as the dominant medium, and/or gas phase reaction, using conventional equipment and contacting techniques.<br>
The oligomerisation reaction may be carried out in a plant which includes reactor ypes known in the art. Examples of such reactors include, but are not limited to, jatch reactors, semi-batch reactors and continuous reactors. The plant may nclude, in combination a) at least one reactor system, b) at least one inlet line nto this reactor for olefin reactant and the catalyst system, c) effluent lines from his reactor for oligomerised reaction products, and d) at least one separator to ;eparate the desired oligomerised reaction products which may include a recycle<br><br>
loop for solvents and/or reactants and, or products which may also serve as a temperature control mechanism.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided the use of an aliphatic liquid medium in a process for producing an oligomeric product by the oligomerisation of at least one olefinic compound in the form of an olefin or a compound including an olefinic moiety by contacting at least one olefinic compound with an oligomerisation catalyst in the aliphatic liquid medium at a reaction temperature of at least 50SC, wherein the catalyst comprises the combination of<br>
i)        a source of a transition metal; and<br>
ii)       a ligating compound of the formula<br>
(R1)mX1(Y)X2(R2)n<br>
wherein:       X1 and X2 are independently selected from the group consisting of N, P, As, Sb, Bi, O, S and Se ; Y is a linking group between X1 and X2; m and n are independently 0, 1 or a larger integer; and R1 and R' are independently hydrogen, a hydrocarbyl group or a heterohydrocarbyl group, and R1 being the same or different when m&gt;1, and R2 being the same or different when n&gt;1.<br><br>
The invention will now be further described by means of the following non-limiting examples.<br>

The individual components of the examples may conceivably be omitted or substituted and, although not necessarily ideal, the invention may conceivably still be performed and these components are not to be taken as essential to the working of the invention.<br>
In the examples that follow all procedures were carried out under inert conditions, using pre-dried reagents. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich or Strem Chemicals unless stated otherwise.

A comparison of the results of Examples 1-10 (all catalytic runs in a variety of<br>
aromatic solvents) with Examples 11-17, 19-20 and 30-31 (all runs in a variety of<br>
aliphatic solvents) indicates that, irrespective of the aromatic solvent employed,<br>
all	catalytic	runs	with	the	Cr(acetylacetonate)3/<br>
(phenyl)2PN(isopropyl)P(phenyl)2/aluminoxane catalyst system in aliphatic solvents exhibited significantly higher reaction rates. This trend is also evident when a chromium coordination complex containing the same ligating compound is employed (see Example 21). In fact, comparing Example 18 with Example 17 indicates that the presence of only 1 volume % toluene in methylcyclohexane resulted in a nearly 50 reduction on reaction rate.<br><br>
The positive influence of aliphatic solvents on both reaction rate and catalyst stability is particularly apparent in Figure 1 which shows the cumulative ethylene uptake curves for Examples 8 and 12. In the case of Example 8 (a catalytic run in cumene, an aromatic solvent), the ethylene uptake rate decreased significantly over the first 500 seconds of run time while in the case of Example 12 (a catalytic run in cyclohexane, an aliphatic solvent) the ethylene uptake rate increased gradually over the first 1500 seconds of run time with no visible signs of catalyst deactivation thereafter.<br>
