STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT<br>
[0001] Not applicable.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] This invention relates generally to the field of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. More specifically, the invention relates to a system and method for converting syngas to hydrocarbons via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The system and method involve at least two slurry loops comprising at least one magnetic dynamic settling vessel or three or more slurry loops for separating catalyst slurry from gaseous and liquid Fischer-Tropsch products. The slurry loops are in fluid communication with the Fischer-Tropsch reactor. Background of the Invention<br>
[0003] Natural gas, coal deposits, and biomass are abundant energy sources that often serve as fuel for a large number of daily uses including heating and power generation. While abundant the location of these deposits far from industrialized, commercial infrastructure represents a significant hurdle to increased application as a replacement for oil distillates. Additionally, natural gas must be converted to a liquid by an expensive and energy intensive process. Comparatively, as solids coal and biomass have substantial mass for their energetic yield, requiring special tools, packaging and carriers to transport them.<br>
[0004] Liquid fuels that are easily transported long distances without expensive processes or packaging are highly advantageous. However, current petroleum exploration and production are unable to keep up with global demands for fuel. This trend is not predicted to change in the future. Resultantly, oil reserves are being depleted despite the rising costs to the end consumer. For this reason increased attention, interest, and investment in developing technologies that convert solid or gaseous fuels into liquid fuels.<br>
[0005] The process of converting the available material to a liquid fuel involves the partial oxidation of the material prior to a catalyzed reaction to create a liquid fuel. The Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactors contain the vital step of catalyzed synthesis of synthetic petroleum substitute liquid fuels. The process occurs via a catalyzed chemical reaction in which carbon monoxide and hydrogen from the material are converted into liquid hydrocarbons. The reaction is highly exothermic, and requires a cooled reactor to maintain conditions favorable for<br>
continued synthesis. Commercial FT reactors require cooling liquid to be transported through heat exchanging conduits in order to remove heat from the reactor.<br>
[0006] Additionally, the desirable liquid or wax product must be separated from the catalyst, intermediate hydrocarbon, and associated gases in the reaction slurry which may be returned to the reactor. Current reactor systems use a number of processes in this separation step including filtering, and settling. However the process of filtering the solid material and wax from the reaction slurry requires a high energy investment as the mixture must be continuously pumped (circulated) through the system at a rate exceeding the product draw rate. Additionally, maintenance and cleaning of these systems requires stopping the reactor processes completely. [0007] Settlers are a highly preferred method of separation. While comparatively a lower maintenance method of separation, they are highly dependent on the size, shape, and consistency of the solid catalyst particles. Longer time periods, or multiple steps in series or parallel are often required to fully separate the liquid fuel. The number of these devices dictates the rate at which the reactor can produce suitable synthetic products for further processing.<br>
[0008] Consequently, there is a need for a commercial FT reactor design that maximizes reactor run time, and efficiency in separating synthetic liquid products from reaction catalyst slurry by incorporating multiple slurry loops and a large slurry bed FT reactor.<br>
SUMMARY [0009] These and other needs in the art are addressed in one embodiment by a commercial FT reactor system comprising two or more, preferably three or more slurry loops for the purpose of removing desirable synthesis products from the reactor for further processing. [0010] The increased number and smaller size of the slurry loops may provide operational flexibility, efficiency, and increased run time to a commercial reactor. The multiple slurry loops contain separators that may be individually isolated from the reactor outlet stream for maintenance, while others remain on stream.<br>

be greater than about one half the total vertical height of the catalytic reactor. In embodiments, the reactor product (the product that is liquid at typical reaction pressures and temperatures) outlets are located in the lower 90% of the total vertical height of the catalytic reactor.

Each slurry loop fluidly connects a reactor product outlet 61 and a slurry return inlet 75 of FT reactor 20 with intervening wax removal separation equipment. Components of the FT system will be described in more detail hereinbelow.<br>
[0029]    The use of a greater number of smaller diameter catalyst/wax separation vessels 30 increases operational flexibility and manufacture of FT system 10. FT Reactor<br>
[0030] In embodiments, FT reactor 20 comprises a slurry bubble column reactor. In embodiments, FT reactor 20 has a diameter of from about 10 feet and about 40 ft. In embodiments, FT reactor 20 has a cylindrical body. In preferred embodiments, the metal wall thickness of FT reactor 20 is capable of withstanding pressures in the range of from about 10atm. to about 40 arm. FT reactor 20 comprises at least one syngas feed inlet 40 and at least one overhead tail gas outlet 50. In embodiments, the at least one overhead tail gas outlet 50 is located at or near the top of FT reactor 20. In embodiments, overhead tail gas outlet 50 is fluidly connected to a product collection system as known to those of skill in the art to be capable of removing product (e.g., crude light distillate, crude mid-distillate, FT water, or a combination thereof) from the FT tail gas.<br>
 [0031] In embodiments, gas inlet 40 is located at or near the bottom of FT reactor 20. In embodiments, syngas feed inlet 40 is positioned within the bottom 20% of the total vertical height, L, of reactor 20. In embodiments, an additional syngas feed inlet is positioned within the bottom 50% (not depicted) of the total reactor height, L. In some embodiments, gas inlet 40 (and optional feed nozzles) is positioned at or near the middle of the total vertical height of reactor 20.<br>
[0032] The superficial velocity is defined herein as the overall volumetric gas feed rate divided by the cross sectional area of the main reactor body. In embodiments, syngas feed inlet 40 comprises multiple nozzles such that the overall superficial velocity is greater than the average sedimentation velocity or greater than the minimum fiuidization velocity of the solid catalyst in reactor 20. In specific embodiments, syngas feed inlet 40 comprises multiple nozzles such that the resulting overall superficial velocity is greater than about 9cm/s; alternatively, greater than about 15 cm/s; alternatively, in the range of from about 5 cm/s to 25 cm/s; alternatively, in the range of from about 10 cm/s to about 20 cm/s; alternatively in the range of from about 12 cm/s to about 18 cm/s; alternatively in the range of from about 14 cm/s to about 18 cm/s. FT reactor 20 may further comprise inlet(s) for fresh activated catalyst slurry and inlet(s) for gas return from at least one of the separators 30 (not shown in Figure 1). [0033] The FT conversion within FT reactor 20 is exothermic. FT reactor 20 may comprise coils to remove the heat of reaction. In embodiments, FT reactor 20 comprises at least one coil within the main cylindrical body. In embodiments, reactor 20 comprises coils internal to the reactor. The coils will remove the exothermic heat of reaction via the vaporization of a fluid. In embodiments, the coil(s) are steam generating coils and the fluid to be vaporized comprises water. In some embodiments, steam is generated at pressures in the range of from 200psig to about 500psig. In optimum embodiments, steam is generated at a pressure of from 400psig to about 450 psig. In embodiments, reactor 20 comprises more than one set of cooling coils. In some embodiments, reactor 20 comprises at least one lower coil and at least one upper coil. By adjusting the flowrate through the coils, different amounts of heat may be removed from reactor 20. Alternatively, by adjusting directly or indirectly the temperature of the fluid in the coils, different amounts of heat may be removed from reactor 20. Typically, a lower cooling coil will generate more steam than an upper coil due to higher reaction rate and/or to higher catalyst concentration at the bottom of the reactor. This higher reaction may be due to the initial reaction with the syngas as it enters the reactor or uneven catalyst loading. For example, catalyst loading may be greater near the bottom of reactor 20 due to nonideal fiuidization that does not provide uniform catalyst distribution.<br>
 [0034] In embodiments, FT reactor 20 comprises steam coils in the main body of the reactor. In embodiments, FT reactor 20 comprises coils having an outer coil diameter in the range of from about 0.75 inch to 6 inches. In embodiments, the cumulative fraction of the cross sectional area of the coils to the cross sectional area of the main body of reactor 20 is in the range of from about 0.10 to about 0.50. In embodiments, reactor 20 comprises bayonet tubes arranged substantially vertically within reactor 20. In some embodiments, water is fed to bayonet tubes at or near the top of the reactor 20 and steam is removed from at or near the top of reactor 20. In some embodiments, water is fed to at or near the bottom of reactor 20 and steam is removed at the top of the tubes at or near the top of reactor 20.<br>

In some embodiments, a portion of slurry is withdrawn via at least three slurry offtakes 60 which are positioned near the top of FT reactor 20. Near the top of FT reactor 20, some portion of slurry is withdrawn through multiple nozzles. In still other variations of the disclosed system, a portion of slurry is withdrawn via at least four slurry offtakes 60 which are positioned near the top of FT reactor 20. Each slurry offtake 60 fluidly connects a reactor product outlet 61 to a separator inlet 45 of a separator 30. [0036] In embodiments, reactor 20 comprises at least two reactor product outlets located within the top 50% of the total vertical height, L, of the main body of reactor 20. In other embodiments, reactor 20 comprises at least three reactor product outlets located within the top 50% of the total vertical height of the main body of reactor 20. In yet other embodiments, reactor 20 comprises at least four reactor product outlets located within the top 50% of the total vertical height of the main body of reactor 20.<br>
[0037]    Reactor product outlets 61 may have a diameter of greater than 6 inches.    In embodiments, the reactor slurry outlets 61 have a diameter of less than 5 ft.   In embodiments, the reactor product outlets 61 have a diameter of greater than 6 inches and less than 5 ft. Slurry LOOPS<br>

In embodiments, the at least one separator 30 of each of the three or more slurry loops 65 is selected from the group consisting of filtration units, magnetic separators, settling units (e.g. vertical settlers, inclined settlers), dynamic settlers, magnetic dynamic settlers and combinations thereof. [0039] In embodiments, at least one slurry loop 65 comprises more than one separator in series. In embodiments, at least one slurry loop 65 comprises more than one separator in parallel. In specific embodiments, each slurry loop comprises at least one dynamic settler. In embodiments, at least one slurry loop 65 comprises two or more dynamic settlers in series or in parallel.<br>
[0040] Each separator 30 comprises at least one separator inlet 45 positioned in the top portion of the separator, a concentrated catalyst slurry outlet 71 whereby catalyst slurry comprising a higher concentration of solids than the catalyst slurry entering via separator inlet 45 exits the separator 30, and clarified wax outlet 81 whereby a stream of fluid comprising a lower concentration of solids than the slurry entering separator 30 via separator inlet 45 exits the separator 30.

In embodiments, the feed conduit extends at least 70% of the length of the MDSV such that the concentrated catalyst slurry from the reactor 20 discharges slurry within the lower portion of the MDSV. In embodiments, the feed conduit extends at least 80% of the length of MDSV. In embodiments, the feed conduit extends downwardly to within a conical zone at the bottom of the MDSV. In embodiments, the feed conduit is positioned in the geometric center of MDSV. In<br>
specific configurations the feed conduit is located at one side of the MDSV and the vessel further comprises internal plates, such as internal inclined plates.<br>
[0046] As mentioned hereinabove, in embodiments, the feed conduit is positioned near the geometric center of the MDSV and forms an annular region between the inner walls of the chamber and the feed conduit, whereby as the slurry flows into an annular region at the bottom of the settler, the heavier catalyst particles settle down aided by gravity and the magnetic field within the MDSV and are removed as concentrated slurry at the bottom of MDSV via concentrated catalyst slurry outlet 71. Nonmagnetic wax product rises up in the annular section and clarified wax is removed by a wax liquid product outlet 81and MDSV liquid product stream 80.<br>
[0047] In embodiments, the MDSV further comprises a multichannel baffle as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,730,221. The baffle(s) may help to prevent turbulence and/or improve retention of solid particles. The multichannel baffle may serve to divide the annular volume into plural channels. In embodiments, the maximum cross-sectional dimension of the channels is sufficiently small that natural convection flow is minimized and particle settling is promoted. In some embodiments, the multichannel baffle is positioned within the annular volume between the vessel walls and the feed conduit of MDSV. In these embodiments, wax liquid product outlet 81 communicates with the annular volume above the multichannel baffle and MDSV concentrated catalyst slurry outlet 71 communicates with the annular volume below the multichannel baffle. In embodiments, channels of the multichannel baffle have hexagonal cross section. Alternatively, the channels are circular in cross section.<br>
[0048] Each separator 30 comprises at least one clarified wax outlet 81 through which wax product reduced in solids content is removed from separator 30 via separated product stream 80.

Slurry return inlets 75 may have a diameter greater than 4 in. In embodiments, the slurry return inlets 75 have a diameter less than 5 ft. In embodiments, the slurry return inlets 75 have a diameter greater than 6 in. and less than 5 ft.<br>
[0049] In embodiments where slurry loop 65 comprises more than one separator 30 in series, slurry return 70 fluidly connects reactor 20 slurry return inlet 75 with the outlet concentrated catalyst slurry outlet 71 of the last separator 30 in the series. In embodiments, where slurry loop 65 comprises more than one separator 30 in parallel, slurry return 70 fluidly connects reactor 20 slurry return inlet 75 with the concentrated catalyst slurry outlets 71 of the separators 30. [0050] In embodiments, concentrated slurry is removed from separator 30 via concentrated catalyst slurry outlet 71. At least a portion of the catalyst recovered from separator 30 is recycled to FT reactor 20 via slurry return 70. In embodiments, concentrated slurry is removed from a lower portion of separator 30. In some embodiments, separator concentrated slurry stream, clarified wax liquid separated product stream 80, or both undergo further settling or filtering processes. As mentioned above, separator 30 may further comprise at least one baffle which may help to prevent turbulence and/or improve retention of solid particles. In embodiments, the at least one baffle is a multi-channel baffle.<br>
[0051] In embodiments, concentrated slurry is treated as known to those of skill in the art to further separate liquids therefrom and/or regenerate catalyst prior to recycle to reactor 20. Fischer-Tropsch catalyst may be regenerated by, for example, purging the catalyst with an inert gas or with a regenerating gas for a period of time, as known to those of skill in the art. [0052] In embodiments, concentrated slurry returns to FT reactor 20 via slurry return 70 via gravity driven loop. In alternative embodiments, concentrated slurry returns to reactor 20 via pump-assisted loop.<br>
[0053]    In embodiments, reactor product outlet 61 comprises a nozzle which connects it to slurry offtake 60. In embodiments, each slurry return 70 is connected to slurry return inlet 75 with a nozzle. Relative Geometry<br>
[0054] Figure 2 is a schematic of a top view of an embodiment of a FT system 10 according to the present disclosure. FT system 10 comprises more than 2 slurry loops 65. In preferred embodiments, FT system 10 comprises more than 3 slurry loops 65. In the embodiment of Figure 2, FT system 10 comprises 4 separators: settler 1 (30a), settler 2 (30b), settler 3 (30c), and settler 4 (30d), each making up the at least one separator 30 of a slurry loop 65.   In<br>
preferred embodiments, FT system 10 comprises four slurry loops 65. As mentioned hereinabove, each slurry loop 65 comprises 1 or more separator 30; in embodiments where a slurry loop 65 comprises 2 or more separators 30, the 2 or more separators 30 may be oriented in series and/or parallel.<br>
[0055] In embodiments, the inner diameter Dr of FT reactor 20 is greater than or equal to 6 feet and less than 60 feet. For example, biomass gasification plants may utilize FT reactor(s) 20 having relatively small diameters when compared to those utilized in coal gasification processes. In embodiments, the inner diameter Dr of FT reactor 20 is greater than or equal to 10 feet and less than 60 feet. In alternative embodiments, the inner diameter Dr of FT reactor 20 is greater than or equal to 12 feet. The inner diameter Dr of FT reactor 20 may be greater than or equal to 1.3 feet, in certain embodiments, for example pilot scale units. In alternative embodiments, the inner diameter Dr of FT reactor 20 is greater than or equal to 10 feet and less than 50 ft. In some embodiments, the inner diameter Dr of FT reactor 20 is greater than or equal to 10 feet. In embodiments, the total vertical height L of reactor 20 is greater than 50 feet. In embodiments, the total vertical height L of reactor 20 is greater than 60 feet. In embodiments, the total vertical height L of reactor 20 is greater than 50 feet and less than 200 ft.<br>
[0056] In embodiments, the inner diameter Ds of each separator 30 is greater than 2 feet. In embodiments, the inner diameter Ds of each separator 30 is less than or equal to the reactor diameter, Dr. In embodiments, the inner diameter Ds of each separator 30 is greater than 2 ft. and less than or equal to the reactor diameter, Dr. In other cases, such as pilot plant systems, the reactor diameter, Dr, may be less than or equal to about 1.5 ft., and the inner diameter Ds of each separator 30 may be less than or equal to the reactor diameter, Dr.<br>
[0057] The slurry loop height, H (the distance between each reactor product outlet 61 and the corresponding slurry return inlet of the corresponding slurry loop 65) is selected such that the pressure balance drives desired flow through the slurry loops 65.<br>
[0058] The expanded slurry height is the height of the catalyst, wax, and gas mixture in reactor 20. The gas feed and gaseous products "expand" the volume of the mixture. This expansion is caused by and may be referred to as 'gas hold up'. The slurry offtake via reactor product outlets 61 is below the expanded slurry bed height of reactor 20. Therefore, in such embodiments, slurry loop height H plus reactor base height Hb is less than approximately 0.9 times the total vertical height of the reactor L, i.e. H + Hb 
 [0059] In embodiments, slurry loop height H is greater than 0.5 times the total length L of reactor 20, i.e. H &gt; 0.5L. In embodiments, slurry loop height H is greater than the separator height Hs, i.e. H &gt; Hs.<br>
[0060] As seen in Figure 1, in embodiments, the angle Φ1 between the vertical outer wall of reactor 20 and each slurry return 70 is less than 90° and greater than 30°. As seen in Figure 1, in embodiments, the angle O2 between the outer wall of reactor 20 and each slurry offtake 60 is less than 90° and greater than 30°. In some embodiments, the distance Dre from the outer wall of FT reactor 20 to the outer wall of separator 30 is minimized. In preferred embodiments, Drs is less than Dr, i.e. Dre 
[0061] The diameter Ds of separator 30 is ideally selected so that the upward liquid velocity in separator 30 is greater than 15 cm/hr and less than 100 cm/hr. In embodiments where a dynamic magnetic separation vessel is used the upward liquid velocity is greater than 15 cm/h, more preferably greater than 30 cm/h and most preferable greater than 50 cm/h. In embodiments, separator 30 does not comprise significant internals, and the ratio of the separator height to the separator diameter, Hs/Ds, is greater than 0.9 and less than 10. In some embodiments, one or more separator 30 has a different height Hs than at least one of the other separators 30. In some embodiments, one or more separator 30 has a different diameter Ds than at least one of the other separators 30. For example, letting the diameters of separators 1 to 4 be Ds1, DS2, DS3, and Ds4 and the heights of separators 1-4 be Hs1, HS2, Hs3, and Hs4, respectively, in some embodiments, at least one of the diameters selected from Ds1, DS2, DS3 and Ds4 is not equal to at least one of the other diameters. Similarly, in embodiments, at least one of the separator heights selected from Hs1, Hs2, HS3, and Hs4 is not equal to the other separator heights.<br>
