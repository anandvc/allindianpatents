				<td>This invention relates to a mobile rice planting machine for planting any type of rice seedlings in the field.<br>
BACKGROUNB<br>
The transplant of the rice seedling is normally done manually which consumes considerable time. For instance, 14 labours can transplant only 1 acre of seedling in a day. Furthermore, during peak season there is labour shortage and it is difficult to transplant rice seedling resulting in less production.<br>
The object of this invention is to transplant rice seedling in the field during the peak season faster and with less expenditure.<br>
To achieve the said objective this invention provides a mobile rice transplanting machine for transplanting rice seedlings in the fields which comprises an engine for generating power, the said engine is coupled to the transmission system and the planting mechanism and are mounted on a frame having wheels, characterized in that the said planting mechanism consists of a seedling boxes containing number of seedling per hill, the seedling pusher means for pushing the rice seedlings in the boxes to the guiding grooves, adjusting mechanism for pushing the number of seedling per hill through the said guide grooves, finger means for planting seedlings in the soil and means for adjusting the depth for rice seedlings in the soil.<br>
The engine provided in the mobile rice transplanting machine is preferably gasoline engine 4 H,P. at 3000 RPM.<br>
The transmission system consist of a clutch coupled to reduction gear and speed change gear and transmission case. The clutch is simple belt driven and the gear boxes are fitted with high quality gears, shafts and bearings. The planting mechanism is driven through the transmission case of transmission system for planting the rice seedlings in the field.<br>
I<br><br>
The means for adjusting the depth consists of a float having adjusting lever connected to depth adjusting bolt, a check and set pin for setting depth adjusting pin. The said float is made of long flat piece of timber wood chemically treated to stand water and insects' attacks.<br>
The seedling pusher means for pushing the rice seedling consists of a rocking arm connected to adjusting screw and pusher bar and the means for pushing the seedling is connected to the said pusher bar.<br>
An adjusting mechanism for pushing the number of seedling per hill placed in the seedling box consists of an installation plate, adjusting bolt and nut and setting finger and a screen and bush.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows mobile rice transplanting machine according to this invention<br>
Figure 2 shows adjusting mechanism for setting depth.<br>
Figure 3 shows phase adjusting mechanism.<br>
Figure 4 shows seedling pusher used in the planting mechanism<br>
Figure 5 shows the adjusting mechanism for the number of seedling per hill in the planting mechanism, according to this invention.<br>
Figure 6 shows the planting operation backgroimd.<br>
Referring to the drawings, (I) shows the engine, having fuel tank (A) for the engine. (B) shows the power transmission system and 'C the rice planting system mounted on mobile three wheeler. Engine (1) is mounted on engine frame (12). The said engine (1) is coupled to power transmission system 'B' which consists of clutch (3), reduction gear (11), speed change gear (4). The clutch (3) is simple belt driven and the gear boxes are fitted with high<br><br>
quality gears, shafts and the bearings. The transmission system 'B' is connected to the planting system (apparatus) 'C The mobile three wheeler has a steering handle (2), driving wheel (10) and the rear wheels (7). The transplanting system 'C consists of seedling boxes (SB), seedling pusher (SP) and guide grooves and a float (8). The float is made of long flat piece of timber wood which is chemically treated to stand water and insects' attacks. The rear wheels (7) are removed from the wooden float before starting transplanting of rice seedlings in the fields. The float prevents piling of soil and insures straight movement of the machine in operation. The rice planting apparatus has adjustment mechanism for setting depth and planting number of seedling per hill in the field as shown in figure 2. The adjusting mechanism for setting depth consists of mainly setting depth adjusting bolt (13) and setting depth adjusting pin (14). The phase adjusting mechanism for seedling is shown in figure 3 which has a star wheel (15), roller (16) and roller installation plate (17) for phase adjusting the seedlings. The seedling pusher is shown in figure (4) which has a front rocking arm (18) which is coimected to the adjusting screw (19) and pusher bar (20). The seedling pusher (21) is connected to the pusher bar (20). The said pusher bar is connected to the connecting rod (22).<br>
The adjusting mechanism for the number of seedling per hill is shown in figure 5 whichf consists of installation plate (23), adjusting bolt (24), adjusting nut (25) and setting finger (26). It has also screen (27), bush (28) and brush (29)<br>
Working of the Machine<br>
The drive from the engine (1) is transmitted to the speed change gear box (4) through the belt drive clutch (3). The speed change gear box (4) provides two speeds for the machine i) Traveling Speed ii) Working Speed. The drive to the front wheel (10) is transmitted through the reduction gear box (11), and gear box (4). Drive to the planting apparatus (C) is transmitted through the transmission case which is driven by propeller shaft^from speed change gear box (4).<br>
The rice seedlings are kept by hill in the seedling boxes (SB) and are pushed by seedling pushers shown in figure 4, through the guide grooves to ensure the planting of set number of<br><br>
rice seedlings. The mechanism for adjusting the number of rice seedlings per hill &amp; depth of planting in the soil, distance between bill and position angle of planting is shown in figure 5. The whole operation of rice seedling planting is controlled by engaging a lever fitted to transmission case. In figure 6 planting operation is shown. The machine enters to the paddy field without performing planting work through 'El' and enters the planting area 'E2'. The said machine turns through turning area 'E3' without performing planting work. The machine exits the paddy field after finishing the work through exit 'E5'.<br><br><br><br>
