AMINE ORGANOBORANE COMPLEX INITIATED POLYMERIZABLE COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING SILOXANE POLYMERIZABLE COMPONENTS<br>
This invention relates to organoborane amine initiated polymerizable compositions that contain siloxane polymerizable components. The polymerizable compositions comprise compounds containing moieties capable of free radical polymerization and polymerizable compounds containing siloxane. In another embodiment the invention relates to adhesives, sealants, and coatings containing organoborane amine complexes and compounds containing moieties capable of free radical polymerization and polymerizable compounds containing siloxane backbones. Another embodiment of this invention is organoborane amine complexes in which the amine has siloxane functionality. Another embodiment of this invention relates to polymerizable compositions comprising compounds containing moieties capable of free radical polymerization and organoborane amine complex initiators and silicone containing materials capable of producing acid upon exposure to moisture allowing for the polymerizable composition to be stable in a one-part formulation in the absence of moisture.<br>
In many practical situations in which compounds are subjected to polymerization, for instance where the polymerizable compounds are used as adhesives, it is desirable to have polymerizable compositions and adhesive compositions that can cure on demand, by performing an operation such as heating, shearing or contacting two or more components containing reactive materials. Cure on demand means that the polymerization can be initiated when desired. A significant problem with cure on demand compositions is the stability of the compositions. Many such compositions at, or near, ambient temperature will cure partially resulting in an increased viscosity causing difficulties in handling and reduced functionality of the polymerizable composition or adhesive composition.<br>
Low surface energy olefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polytetrafluroethylene have a variety of attractive properties in a variety of uses, such as toys, automobile parts, furniture applications and the like. Because of the low surface energy of these plastic materials, it is very difficult to find adhesive compositions that bond to these materials. The commercially available adhesives that are used for these plastics require time consuming or extensive pretreatment of the surface before the adhesive will<br><br>
bond to the surface. Such pretreatments include corona treatment, flame treatment, the application of primers, and the like. The requirement for extensive pretreatment of the surface results in significant limitations to the designers of automobile components, toys, furniture and the like.<br>
A series of patents issued to Skoultchi (US Patent Numbers 5,106,928; 5,143,884; 5,286,821; 5,310,835 and 5,376,746 (all incorporated herein by reference)) disclose a two-part initiator system that is usefiil in acrylic adhesive compositions. The first part of the two-part system includes a stable organoborane amine complex and the second part includes a destabilizer or activator such as an organic acid or an aldehyde. The organoborane compound of the complex has three ligands which can be selected from CM0 alkyl groups or phenyl groups. The adhesive compositions are disclosed to be useful in structural and semi-structural adhesive applications, such as speaker magnets, metal to metal bonding, automotive glass to metal bonding, glass to glass bonding, circuit board component bonding, bonding select plastics to metal, glass to wood, etc. and for electric motor magnets.<br>
Zharov, et al. discloses in a series of US Patents (US 5,539,070; US 5,690,780; and US 5,691,065 (all incorporated herein by reference)) polymerizable acrylic compositions which are particularly useful as adhesives wherein organoborane amine complexes are used to initiate cure. It is disclosed that these complexes are good for initiating polymerization of an adhesive that bonds to low surface energy substrates.<br>
Pocius in a series of patents (US 5,616,796; US 5,621,143; US 5,681,910; US 5,686,544; US 5,718,977; and US 5,795,657 (all incorporated herein by reference)) disclose amine organoborane complexes using a variety of amines such as polyoxyalkylene polyamines and polyamines which are the reaction product of diprimary amines and compound having at least two groups which react with a primary amine. Pocius (US 5,686,544) discloses a composition comprising an organoborane polyamine complex, polyol and an isocyanate decomplexing agent.<br>
After polymerization many of the compositions of the prior art demonstrate excellent stability, strength, and adhesion at or near ambient temperatures, but at temperatures above and below room temperature undergo significant loss of strength and adhesion due to softening at temperatures above the adhesive's Tg and embrittlement at<br><br>
temperatures below the Tg of the adhesive matrix. This limits the environments where substrates bonded using these adhesives can be used.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for adhesive systems wlich are capable of bonding to low surface energy substrates, and initiator systems which facilitate such bonding. What are further needed are polymer compositions and adhesive systems which are thermally stable at, or near, ambient temperatures and which will undergo polymerization when the user desires. Also needed are adhesive compositions which are capable of bonding to low surface energy substrates, and bonding low surface energy substrates to other substrates, without the need for extensive or costly pretreatment. Compositions that have stability and adhesion at temperatures different from ambient are also desired.<br>
In one embodiment the invention is a polymerizable composition comprising a) an organoborane amine complex; b) one or more of monomers, oligomers or polymers having olefinic unsaturation which is capable of polymerization by free radical polymerization; c) one or more compounds, oligomers or prepolymers having a siloxane backbone and reactive moieties capable of polymerization; and d) a catalyst for the polymerization of the one or more compounds, oligomers or prepolymers having a siloxane backbone and reactive moieties capable of polymerization. Some of the compositions of the invention can be polymerized by exposure to temperatures at which the organoborane amine complex undergoes disassociation and initiates polymerization of the reactive compounds, oligomers or prepolymers.<br>
In another embodiment the invention is a two part polymerizable composition comprising a) an organoborane amine complex; b) one or more of monomers, oligomers or polymers having olefinic unsaturation which is capable of polymerization by free radical polymerization; c) one or more compounds, oligomers or prepolymers having siloxane in the backbone and reactive moieties capable of polymerization, d) an effective amount of a compound that causes the organoborane amine complex to disassociate, freeing the borane to initiate polymerization of the one or more monomers, oligomers or polymers having olefinic unsaturation; and e) a catalyst for the polymerization of the one or more compounds, oligomers or prepolymers having a siloxane backbone and reactive moieties capable of polymerization. The compound that causes disassociation of the complex is kept separate from the complex until initiation of polymerization is desired. It<br><br>
may be desirable to keep catalyst components used in the composition separate from portions of the composition with which they may react under normal storage or transport conditions for instance, in separate pails of a two part composition.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the two part composition further comprises a compound which is reactive with both the b) one or more of monomers, oligomers or polymers having olefinic unsaturation which is capable of polymerization by free radical polymerization; and the c) one or more compounds, oligomers or prepolymers having a siloxane backbone and reactive moieties capable of polymerization. This composition can be polymerized by contacting the two parts of the composition.<br>
In another embodiment the invention is an organoborane amine complex comprising an alkyl borane having ligands which are alkyl, cycloalkyl or both and an amino siloxane.<br>
In yet another embodiment the invention is a polymerizable composition comprising a) an organoborane amine complex; b) one or more of monomers, oligomers or polymers having olefinic unsaturation which is capable of polymerization by free radical polymerization; and c) a compound which has siloxane groups in its backbone and contains a moiety which when exposed to moisture releases an acid capable of decornplexing the organoborane amine complex. This; composition can be polymerized by exposing the composition to atmospheric moisture under conditions such that part c) decomposes to form an acid, which causes the organoborane amine complex to disassociate and initiate polymerization.<br>
The polymerizable compositions of the invention are stable at, or near, ambient temperature and can be cured upon demand by contacting the two parts of the composition, or alternatively by heating the composition above the thermal disassociation temperature of the organoborane amine complex. Furthermore, the polymerizable compositions of the invention can form bonds to low surface energy substrates without the need for primers or surface treatment. These polymerizable compositions can be used as adhesives, coatings or to laminate substrates together. The polymerized compositions may also demonstrate excellent cohesive and adliesive strength at elevated temperatures and thus demonstrate excellent stability at high temperatures. The compositions of the invention also<br><br>
exhibit excellent properties at a wide range of temperatures including at low temperatures, for instance down to -40°C.<br>
The organoborane used in the complex is a trialkyl borane or an alkyl cycloalkyl borane. Preferably such borane corresponds to Formula 1:<br>
B----(R2 )3<br>
wherein B represents Boron; and R2 is separately in each occurrence a C1-10 alkyl, C2-10 cycloalkyl, or two or more of R2 may combine to form a cycloaliphatic ring. Preferably R2 is C1-4alkyl, even more preferably C2-4 alkyl, and most preferably C3_4alkyl. Among preferred organoboranes are tri-ethyl borane, tri-isopropyl borane and tri-n-butylborane.<br>
The amines used to complex the organoborane compound can be any amine or mixture of amines which complex the organoborane and which can be decomplexed when exposed to a decomplexing agent. The desirability of the use of a given amine in an amine/organoborane complex can be calculated from the energy difference between the Lewis acid-base complex and the sum of energies of the isolated Lewis acid (organoborane) and base (amine) known as binding energy. The more negative the binding energy the more stable the complex.<br>
Binding Energy =<br>
(Complex Energy - (Energy of Lewis Acid + Energy of Lewis base))<br>
Such binding energies can be calculated using theoretical ab-initio methods such as the Hartree Fock method and the 3-21G basis set. These computational methods are available commercially employing commercial software and hardware such as SPARTAN and Gaussian 98 programs with a Silicon Graphics workstation. Amines having amine/organoborane binding energies of 10 kilocalories per mol or greater are preferred, amines having a binding energy of 15 kilocalories per mol or greater are more preferred and even more preferred are amines with a binding 20 kilocalories per mol or greater are most preferred.

The compounds, oligomers or prepolymers having a siloxane backbone and reactive moieties capable of polymerization useflil in this invention include any compound, oligomer or prepolymer containing siloxane units in the backbone and which have reactive groups which can polymerize under reasonable reaction conditions. Oligomer as used herein means a few identifiable chemical units linked together through reactive moieties. Oligomer can be thought of as a small polymer having only a few units, for instance a dimer, trimer, tetramer or pentamer. Mer is used to refer to one of the basic identifiable chemical units of a oligomer or polymer and often is the residue of the compound or<br><br>
compounds from which the oligomer or polymer is derived. Prepolymer means compounds having several basic identifiable chemical units which comprise the polymer, that is, several mers, which also have reactive groups which allow the compounds to further react. In practice, a prepolymer is a mixture of polymers having varying numbers of basic identifiable chemical units of the polymer and may contain some amount of oligomers. The term having a siloxane backbone means herein that the backbone of the compounds, oligomers and/or polymers contains basic identifiable chemical units having silicone and oxygen atoms in the backbone. Preferably the basic identifiable chemical units of siloxane correspond to the formula<br><br>
wherein R16 is defined hereinbefore. The term reactive moieties capable of polymerization mean any moieties which react with one another or with other reactive moieties to form oligomers, prepolymers or polymers. Examples of preferred reactive moieties capable of polymerization include vinyl moieties, hydrolyzable moieties, hydroxyl moieties, hydrides, isocyanate moieties, amines or in the case of cyclic siloxanes is the reactive end formed by ring opening; and the like. More preferred reactive moieties capable of polymerization include vinyl moieties, hydrolyzable moieties, hydroxyl moieties, hydrides and the like.<br>
The term hydrolyzable moiety is not particularly limited and is selected from conventional hydrolyzable groups. Specific examples are a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkoxy group, an acyloxy group, a ketoximate group, an amino group, an amido group, an acid amido group, an amino-oxy group, a mercapto group, and an alkenyloxy group. Preferred among them are a hydrogen atom, an alkoxy group an acyloxy group, a ketoximate group, an amino group, an amido group, an amino-oxy group, a mercapto group, and an alkenyloxy group. An alkoxy group is more preferred with a methoxy or ethoxy group being most preferred, for ease in handling due to its mild hydrolyzablility. One to three hydroxyl groups or hydrolyzable groups may be bonded to one silicon atom. Where<br><br>
two or more hydroxyl groups or hydrolyzable groups are present per reactive silicon group; they may be the same or different.<br>
The chemistry of siloxane polymerizations is well known and in general is applied to the current invention without substantial modification except that the reactants and catalysts may need to be separated into two part formulations to provide shelf life stability. The chemistry of siloxane polymerization is covered generally in many text books on the subject such asx by K. J. Saunders 2nd Ed, Chapman and Hall Publishers, London, (1988), Chapter 17, and, S. J. Clarson, J. J. Fitzgerald, M. J. Owen, and S. D. Smit, Editors, ACS Publishers, "Washington, D.C. (2000), incoiporated herein by reference.<br>
The siloxane containing phase may be added to the formulation in the form of monomers, oligomers, cyclic oligomers, or polymers which upon mixing will further react to build molecular weight.<br>
One class of siloxane polymers which are useful in the practice of this invention include vinyl functionalized siloxanes which may be further polymerized via free radical or addition mechanisms. Vinyl functionalized siloxanes comprise compounds, oligomers, and prepolymers which have siloxane units in the backbone and have polymerizable olefinic moieties. The vinyl functionalized siloxanes may contain hydrocarbylene and/or fluorocarbylene units in the backbone. Hydrocarbylene means a divalent moiety comprising carbon and hydrogen. Fluorocarbylene is a hydrocarbylene moiety with at least one of the hydrogens replaced with fluorine atoms, in some embodiments all of the hydrogens may be replaced with fluorine atoms. Preferred hydrocarbylene moieties are alkylene. Preferred fluorocarbylenes are partially or wholly fluorine substituted alkylenes. Preferred olefinic moieties include acrylate, methacrylate, vinyl, acetylenyl and the like. Preferably the vinyl functionalized siloxanes preferably contain moieties corresponding to the formula<br><br><br>
wherein V is a group containing olefinic unsaturation, R16 is as previously defined, h is separately in each occurrence an integer of 5 or greater, more preferably an integer of 10 or greater and most preferably an integer of 15 or greater, h is separately in each occurrence an integer of 50 or less, more preferably an integer of 40 or less and mdst preferably an integer of 30 or less. The vinyl functionalized siloxanes may also contain moieties in the backbone which correspond to the formula<br><br>
wherein R16, R17, h and k are as defined previously.<br>
Vinyl functionalized siloxanes may also react with a siloxane based compound, oligomer or polymer having a hydrogen (hydride functionalized siloxanes) or hydroxyl moiety bound to silicon. Hie hydride or hydroxyl functional silicon compound can be reacted with the vinyl functional siloxane at the point of unsaturation by a hydrosilylation reaction. This reaction is described in Kawakubo, U.S. Patent 4,788,254, column 12, lines 38 to 61, U.S. 3,971,751; U.S. 5,223,597; U.S. 4,923,927; U.S. 5,409,995 and U.S. 5,567,833, relevant parts incorporated herein by reference. Vinyl functionalized polydialkylsiloxanes may also be co-polymerized with diphenylsiloxane to further enhance low temperature properties. These materials can be used by processing either through addition cure using Pt catalysts or radical coupling using peroxide catalysts at room temperature. Fluorine substitution enhances the solvent resistance of the formed compositions.<br>
Hydride functionalized siloxanes also are useful within the scope of this invention. Hydride functional siloxanes undergo two main classes of reaction. The first is hydrosilation involving reaction with a vinyl functionalized polymer catalyzed with a Pt catalyst. The second reaction, dehydrogenation, involves, for example, the coupling reaction between a hydride functional siloxane and a hydroxy functionalized siloxane by coupling the chains and eliminating hydrogen gas. Iliese reactions are commonly catalyzed with a variety of metal salt catalysts known to those skilled in the art, for instance organo tin<br><br>
compounds such as dibutyltin diacetate, bis(2-ethyl-hexanoate)tms zinc octoate, or iron octoate. Both hydrosilation and dehydrogenation couple siloxane chains and, when the functionality of the hydride, vinyl and hydroxy containing moieties are two or greater, can produce extended or crosslinlced networks with rubber-like properties at room temperature. Preferably the hydride functional siloxanes contain terminal moieties corresponding to the formula<br><br>
wherein R,8is separately in each occurrence hydrogen or alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, alkaryl, or aralkyl having up to 20, preferably up to 8, carbon atoms; h and j are defined hereinbefore.<br><br>
Further the hydrides may contain moieties in the backbone corresponding to the formula <br>
wherein R16 and R17 are as defined hereinbefore and s is separately in each occurrence 1 or greater and preferably 3 or greater, preferably 10 or less and most preferably 8 or less.<br>
Another class of siloxane containing compounds, oligomers or prepolymers useful in this invention is siloxanes having terminal silanol groups or hydrolyzable groups which upon exposure to moisture form silanol groups. Terminal silanol groups on siloxane chains allow the compounds; oligomers or prepolymers react via condensation when catalyzed. These reactions proceed at room temperature as either a one part or two-part polymerization system. This reaction occurs at room temperature in the presence of silanol condensation catalysts. Silanol condensation catalysts are well known in the art and include the following: titanic acid esters, such as tetrabutyl titanate, tetrapropyl titanate, etc.; organotin compounds; organoaluminum compounds, such as aluminum trisacetylacetonate, aluminum trisethylacetonate, diisopropoxyalmninum ethylacetonate, etc.; reaction products, such as bismuth salts and organic carboxylic acids, such as bismuth tris(2-ethylhexoate), bismuth tris(neodecanoate), etc.; chelate compounds, such as zirconium tetracetylacetonate, titanium tetraacetylacetonate, etc.; organo lead compounds, such as lead octylate; organovanadium compounds; amine compounds, such as butylamine, octylamine, dibutylamine, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, oleylamine, cyclohexylamine, benzylamine, diethylaminopropylamine, xylylenediamine, triethylenediamine, guanidine, diphenylguanidine, 2,4,6-tris(dimethylaminometliyl)phenols morpholine, N-methylmorpholine, 2-ethyl-4-methylimidazole, l,l-diazabicyclo(5,4,0)undecene-7 (DBU), etc., or their salts with carboxylic acid, etc.; low-molecular-weight polyamide resins obtained from excess<br><br>
polyamines and poly basic acids; reaction products of excess polyamines and epoxy compounds; etc.<br>
Preferred organotin catalysts useful for the silanol condensation reaction are well known in the art. Among preferred tin compounds useful for silanol condensation are, dialkyltin(IV) salts of organic carboxylic acids, such as dibutyltin diacetate, dimethyl tin dilaurate, dibutyltin dilaurate, dibutyltin maleate or dioctyltin diacetate; tin carboxylates, such as tin octylate or tin naphthenate; reaction products of dialkyltin oxides and phthalic acid esters or alkane diones; dialkyltin diacetyl acetonates, such as dibutyltin diacetylacetonate (also commonly referred to as dibutyltin acetylacetonate); dialkyltinoxides, such as dibutyltinoxide; tin(II)salts of organic carboxylic acids, suchas tin(II) diacetate, tin(II) dioctanoate, tin(II) diethylhexanoate or tin(II) dilaurate; dialkyl tin (IV) dihalides, such as dimethyl tin dichloride; and stannous salts of carboxylic acids, such as stannous octoate, stannous oleate, stannous acetate, OT stannous laurate. However, these compounds are not particularly limited; one can use any silanol condensation catalysts that are in general use. Among these silanol condensation catalysts, organometallic compounds or combinations of organometallic compounds and amine compounds are preferable from the point of view of durability. These silanol condensation catalysts may be used individually or in combinations of 2 or more. Preferred catalysts are the dialkyl tin dicarboxylates, dialkyl tin oxides, dialkyl bis(acetylacetonates), reaction products of dialkyltin oxide and phthalic acid esters or an alkane dione, dialkyltin halides and dialkyl tin oxides. Even more preferred catalysts are dibutyltin dilaurate, dimethyltin dilaurate, dibutyltin maleate, dibutyltin diacetate, tin octylate, tin naphthenate, reaction products of dibutyltin oxide and phthalic acid esters or pentanedione, dibutyltin diacetylacetonate, dibutyltinoxide, and dimethyl tin chloride. The amount of catalyst used in the formulation is that amount which facilitates the cure of the adhesive without causing degradation of the adhesive after cure. The amount of catalyst in the adhesive formulation is preferably 0.01 percent by weight or greater, more preferably 0.1 percent by weight or greater, and most preferably 0.2 percent by weight or greater, and preferably 5 percent by weight or less, even more preferably 1.0 percent by weight or less and most preferably 0.4 percent by weight or less.<br><br>
Cyclosiloxanes or cyclic siloxanes can also be useful in the practice of the present invention. Cyclosiloxanes are compounds containing one or more ring structures containing siloxane units. These materials can undergo ring opening polymerization in the presence of bases catalysis and catalytic quantities of water. Cyclic siloxanes are useful, are well known, commercially available materials and are disclosed in Harkness, et al. US patents 6,001,928, Currie et al. US 6,054,548 and Halloran et al. US 6,207,781, all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Siloxane units useful in cyclosiloxanes preferably correspond to the formula<br><br>
Performance of ring opening cyclic siloxane polymerization in the practice of the present invention can bring benefits to polymerizable compositions of the present invention, in a manner similar to the other technologies discussed when formulated in such a way that the components of the composition are not detrimental to the functions of the end product. Catalysts useful in fhe polymerization of cyclic cyclosiloxanes are well known in the art. Preferably, alkaline catalysts such as phosphazenes and alkaline silanolates are used. Other useful catalysts are disclosed in US Patent 6 ,001,928 at column 1, lines 17 to 23 and US Patent 6,207,781 incorporated herein by reference. The catalysts areused amounts which are well known to those of skill in the art.<br>
Silanol or functionalized siloxanes are also useful in formulation of moisture curing systems. This chemistry is currently practiced throughout the sealing and coating industry by such companies as Dow Corning and General Electric. This room temperature chemistry can be practiced by many routes, all of which can find use within the scope of the current invention. Chemistry utilizing moisture curable siloxanes is described by U.S Intent 5,948,854 and 6,008,284 and references therein describing the use of titanium catalysts to promote moisture cure between silanol functionalized siloxanes and alkoxy functionalized siloxanes.<br><br>
The siloxane functional polymers may m some cases be Icept stable in a formulation which begins to polymerize and crosslink when in contact with atmospheric moisture. Many commercial materials take advantage of this ability of siloxane chemistry to allow for the creation of a single component product. The present invention is compatible in many cases with siloxane moisture cure technology.<br>
Some moisture curing technologies for siloxanes operate with the reaction of atmospheric moisture and a compound to produce an acid. This ability of some materials to be latent acid producers makes them attractive in the present invention to create a one component adhesive. In this case the polymerizable composition would consist of a stable trialkylborane-amine complex with a monomer composition capable of free radical polymerization and the latent acid producer. Siloxane functional materials are within the class of materials capable of producing acid upon exposure to atmospheric moisture. Examples of siloxane functional latent acid producer areethytriacetoxysiloxane and methyl triacetoxysiloxane.<br>
Polyacrylate materials can vary their glass transition temperature (Tg) by varying the monomer composition in the formulation. However, if the Tg of these materials is below room temperature, the properties of the adhesive can significantly deteriorate as the polymer tends to creep or flow. The low Tg acrylates can be crosslinked, however, this can also damage the compositions of the present invention by causing too rapid polymerization of the monomer. The presence of functional siloxane polymerizable compounds, such as described above, improves low temperature flexibility and elongation of polymerized or partially polymerized composition by providing a phase of very low Tg polymer while still providing excellent adhesion to low surface energy substrates. A sufficient amount of the siloxane functional materials are used to improve the physical properties of the polymerized or partially polymerized composition and to improve the low temperature properties of the polymerized or partially polymerized composition. The Tg of the compositions can be controlled by controlling the amount of siloxane polymer, and its crosslink density. An amount of siloxane polymer is present to achieve a glass transition temperature of 0°C or less. Preferably the polymeric compositions demonstrate lap shear strength is 100 psi or greater. It is preferred that the total polymerizable formulation contain 1 percent by weight or greater of siloxane polymerizable compound; more preferably 2 percent by weight or<br><br>
greater and most preferred 3 percent by weight or greater. It is preferred that the polymerizable formulation contain 90 percent by weight or less, more preferably 85 percent by weight or less and most preferably 80 percent by weight or less of siloxane polymerizable compound.<br>
A convenient method of incorporating additional functionality into the polymerizable composition and improve the physical properties of the siloxane functionality is to include in the formulation polyftinctional siloxane containing crosslinlcers. Polyfunctional siloxane containing crosslinlcers comprise compounds, oligomers and polymers which contain siloxane units and at least two, preferably 2 to 4, functional groups which react with the functional groups of the reactive materials present to crosslink the polymeric materials present. Preferably there are at least two different functional groups present which react with different compounds, oligomers or polymers present to link the different polymeric materials formed together. Preferably one reacts with the siloxane based materials and one reacts with the functional materials containing unsaturated groups, which are not olefinic in nature, present or formed in the reaction. Examples of such materials are (3-glycidylpropyl)trimethoxy siloxane, (acryloxypropyl)trimethoxysiloxane, and(methacryloxypropyl)trimetlioxysiloxane, (methaciylopropy)methylsiloxane-dimethylsiloxane copolymer, methacryloxypropylpropylterminated polydimethylsiloxane, (acryloxypropyl)methylsiloxane- dimethylsiloxane copolymer and die like. In one embodiment an oxirane ring is incorporated into the formulation as well as an alkoxy siloxane capable of crosslinking silanol functional siloxane containing polymers. In the other cases acrylic and methacrylic functionality is incorporated capable of crosslinking the siloxane containing phase to an acrylic phase. Other examples are mercapto functional siloxanes and isocyanato functional siloxanes. All of these materials are commercially available from companies such as Shin-Etsu Silicones, Witco, Dow Coming, Gelest and others. Siloxane containing compounds, oligomers and/or prepolymers which vinyl and hydrolyzable groups may also be used.<br>
In some cases it may be useful to crosslink the free radical polymerizable compound phase to the siloxane compound derived phase. This is achieved using a bi-flmctional monomer, hereinafter referred to as a crosslinker, containing both olefinic unsaturation functionality, for instance, an acrylic moiety, and silicone functional<br><br>
polymerizable functionality. Examples of this type of material include<br>
(acryloxypropyl)trimethoxysiloxaneand(methycryloxypropyl)trimethoxysiloxane. Similarly the siloxane phase can be crosslinked to the rigid polyurea phase produced by the reaction of the amine from the alkylborane-amine complex and an isocyanate. Such cros slinking materials include 3-aminopropyltriethoxy siloxane, 3-<br>
aminopropyltrimethoxysiloxane, 3-isocyantopropyltrimentooxysiloxane, N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysiIoxane. Such compounds react under normal conditions of the reaction with reactive components of a separate phase of the polymerizable composition. The amount of crosslinker used is that amount which gives the desired properties, that is, a sufficient lap shear strength at room temperature, 3'et does not cause the bond flexibility strength to go below the desired value. Preferred amounts of crosslinker are 0 percent by weight or greater based on the weight of the polymerizable formulation, more preferably 1 percent by weight or greater; most preferably 2 percent by weight or greater. Preferably the amount of crosslinker used is 20 percent by weight of the total polymerizable fomiulation or less; even more preferably 15 percent by weight or less and most preferably 12 percent by weight or less.<br>
It is preferable that the siloxane polymerizable compounds polymerize at a similar rate as the polymerization rate of the compounds containing moieties capable of free radical polymerization. If the reaction of one polymerizable component is too slow, the composition may vitrify or gel prior to obtaining acceptable conversion of monomer or oligomer to polymer of both phases. The unreacted components can act as a plasticizer and degrade properties, such as adhesion, thermal performance and the like. The properties of the final polymerized composition may be enhanced by post heating the polymerized composition to drive die completion of the polymerization. This is performed by heating the polymerized composition to a temperature above its glass transition temperature. In this embodiment it is preferred to post cure at the expected use temperature of the structure, more preferred at 5°C above the expected use temperature of the composition and most preferred to provide a thermal post cure of 10°C above the expected use temperature of the polymerized composition<br>
In a preferred embodiment the reaction of siloxane functional materials containing epoxy substituent(s) is achieved by incorporation of a catalyst as described by<br><br>
Saunders, K. J. in Organic Polymer Chemistry, 2nd Edition, Chapter 17 (1988), incorporated herein by reference. A variety of catalysts are useable in the practice of the current technology depending on the silicone chemistry being employed. Tin catalysts are ofen used to promote reactions between siloxane functional materials. Favored tin catalysts include dibutyltin diacetate and dibutyl tin dilaurate. Tetraalkoxytitanium catalysts have been described by de Buyl et al, in U.S. Patent 5,948,854 and in improvement by Nylund et al. in US Patent 6,008,284 for moisture curable room temperature vulcanizates. Various acidic catalysts are taught by Falender et al. in US Patent 4,448,927 all of which are included herein by reference. Platinum catalysts are also employed for polymerization of vinyl fimctionalized siloxanes. Examples of favored platinum catalysts include chloroplatinic acid and platinum (0)-l,3-divinyl-l,l,3,3-tetrametliyldisiloxane complex. The previous examples of useful catalysts are just provided for illustration and the present invention is not limited to them. In general, any catalyst that is useful for polymerizing siloxane functional monomers or oligomers will be useful in the present invention as long as it does not interfere with the catalyst or polymerizable components of the free radical component of the present invention.<br>
Catalysts are used in sufficient amounts to initiate polymerization of the siloxane functional compounds, in particular they can be used in relatively small amounts. Preferably the amount of catalyst used is 0.1 percent by weight of the total formulation or greater, more preferably 0.25 percent by weight or greater and most preferably 0.5 percent by weight or greater. Preferably the amounts of catalyst used is 10 percent by weight of the total formulation or less, more preferably 8 percent by weight or less and most preferably 6 percent by weight or less.<br>
The organoborane amine complexes useful for polymerization of the  . compounds having moieties capable of firee radical polymerization require the application of a decomplexation agent that will displace the amine from the borane and initiate free radical polymerization. The displacement of the amine from the allcylborane can occur with any chemical for which the exchange energy is favorable, such as mineral acids, organic acids, Lewis acids, isocyanates, acid chlorides, sulphonyl chlorides, aldehydes, and the like. Preferred decomplexation agents are acids and isocyanates. In those embodiments where an initiator for a ring opening polymerization is needed and is a Lewis acid, the decomplexing<br><br>
agent for the organoborane amine may be omitted as the Lewis acid may also function as the decomplexing agent. If the Lewis acid is used as the decomplexing agent and heterocyclic ring opening polymerization initiator no additional amounts are needed over those amounts needed to initiate polymerization. The choice of initiator may be impacted by the desired end use of the polymerizable composition. In particular, where the polymerizable composition is an adhesive and the material to which it will be bonded is polypropylene, the preferred class of initiators is isocyanate initiators and where the substrate is nylon the preferred initiators are acids.<br>
In one embodiment the decomplexing agent can be a siloxane compound which when exposed to moisture releases an acid which causes the organoborane amine complex to disassociate. Any siloxane compound which decomposes to release an acid may be used in this embodiment. Classes of compounds which contain siloxane and a moiety which decomposes to release an acid include halo silanes, acid anhydrides (carboxylic acids), acetoxy siloxanes, alkyl silicic acids, esters of carboxylic acids and silanols, acid chlorides and the like. Preferred compounds include silanol esters of carboxylic acids, acid anhydrides, acid chlorides and acetoxy silanes. Examples of siloxane functional latent acid producer are ethytriacetoxysiloxane and methyl triacetoxysiloxane.<br>
Free radical polymerization of olefmic, unsaturated components may also be initiated thermally. The temperature at which the composition is heated to initiate polymerization is dictated by die binding energy of the organoborane amine complex. Generally the temperature used to initiate the polymerization by decomplexing the complex is 30°C or greater and preferably 50°C or greater. Preferably the temperature at which thermally initiated polymerization is initiated is 120°C or less and more preferably 100°C or less. Any heat source that heats the composition to the desired temperature can be used, .provided the heat source does not negatively impact the components of the composition or its function. In this manner the composition may be contacted with the substrates either before or after the composition is exposed to heat. If the composition is heated prior to contact with the substrates, the composition should be contacted with the substrates before the composition has polymerized to the point at which the composition is no longer able to adhere to the substrates. It may be necessary in the thermally initiated reaction to control the oxygen content such that there is adequate oxygen to create favorable conditions for<br><br>
radical formation but not so much as to inhibit the polymerization. Catalyst levels for the reaction of other polymerizable species may need to be adjusted to ensure approximately equal reaction time for all polymerizations.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the siloxane polymers may be polymerized utilizing a moisture cure mechanism by which a component of the system is unreactive with the siloxane components, but becomes reactive upon exposure to moisture. The source of this moisture is usually the ambient environment, but may be provided from an encapsulated source. Various approaches have been employed to obtain good siloxane polymer properties, and these approaches can be used within the boundaries of the present invention. Commercially these formulations can be referred to as RTV-1 (room temperature vulcanization) for 1 part and RTV-2 for 2 part formulations. Several of the known approaches to RTV-1 are enumerated in Silicones Chemistry and Technology, edited by the technical staffs at Bayer AG, Th. Goldschmidt AG, Wacker-Chemie GmbH, and Haus der Technik e.V., CRC Press, Boca Raton (1991), pp 45-60 incorporated herein by reference andNylund et al. US 6,008,284, de Buyl, et al. US 5,948,854, Korner, et al. US 6,090,904, and Kozakiewicz, et al. US 5,705,561, all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The two-part polymerizable compositions or adhesive compositions of the invention are uniquely suited for use with conventional, commercially available dispensing equipment for two-part compositions. Once the two-parts have been combined, the composition should be used quickly, as the useful pot life (open time) may be short depending upon the monomer mix, the amount of complex, the amount of Lewis acid catalyst and the temperature at which the bonding is. to be performed. The adhesive compositions of the invention are applied to one or both substrates and then the substrates are joined together, preferably, with pressure to force excess composition out of the bond line. In general, the bonds should be made shortly after tire composition has been applied, preferably within 10 minutes. The typical bond line thickness is 0.005 inches (0.13 mm) to 0.03 inches (0.76 mm). The bond line can be thicker if gap filling is needed as the composition of the invention can function as both an adhesive and a gap filler. The bonding process can easily be carried out at room temperature and to improve the degree of bonding it is desirable to keep the temperature below 40°C, more preferably below 30°C, and most preferably below 25°C.<br><br>
The compositions may further comprise a variety of optional additives. One particularly useful additive is a thickener such as medium to high (10,000 to 1,000,000) molecular weight polymethyl methacrylate which may be incorporated in an amount of 10 to 60 weight percent, based on the total weight of the composition. Thickeners may be employed to increase the viscosity of the composition to facilitate application of the composition.<br>
Another particularly useful additive is an elastomeric material. The materials may improve the fracture toughness of compositions made therewith which can be beneficial when, for example, bonding stiff, high yield strength materials such as metal substrates that do not mechanically absorb energy as easily as other materials, such as flexible polymeric substrates. Such additives can be incorporated in an amount of 5 percent to 35 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the composition. Useful elastomeric modifiers include chlorinated or chlorosulphonated polyethylenes such as HYPALON 30 (commercially available from E. I. Dupont de Nemours &amp; Co., Wilmington, Delaware) and block copolymers of styrene and conjugated dienes (commercially available from Dexco Polymers under the Trademark VECTOR, and Firestone under the Trademark STEREON)., Also useful, and even more preferred, are certain graft copolymer resins such as particles that comprise rubber or rubber-like cores or networks that are surrounded by relatively hard shells, these materials often being referred to as "core-shell" polymers. Most preferred are the acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene graft copolymers available from Rohm and Haas. In addition to improving the fracture toughness of the composition, core-shell polymers can also impart enhanced spreading and flow properties to the uncured composition. These enhanced properties may be manifested by a reduced tendency for the composition to leave an undesirable "string" upon dispensing from a syringe-type applicator, or sag or slump after having been applied to a vertical surface. Use of more than 20 percent of a core-shell polymer additive is desirable for achieving improved sag-slump resistance. Generally the amount of toughening polymer used is that amount which gives the desired touglmess to the polymer or the adhesive prepared.<br>
Any additives that reinforce the siloxane containing component and do not inhibit the polymerization of the siloxane or free radical components can be beneficial to the practice of this invention. Reinforcing agents well known to those skilled in the art may be<br><br>
used in this invention. Preferred reinforcing agents include fumed silica or organically modified fumed silica. Many treated fumed silicas are available and may find application within the practice of the invention. Surface treated fumed silica is a common additive as described, for example, in Lutz et al. in US 4,344,800 andFalender et al. in US 4,448,927, Collins et al. in US 4,985,477, and also by Wu et al., J, Appl. Polym Sci,80, (2001) 2341-2346, all incorporated herein by reference. Other additives commonly known to those skilled in the art my be used such as those disclosed in Wang et al, J. Appl. Polym Sci.» 69, (1998), 1557-1561, incorporated herein by reference. Such commercial treated fumed silicas are available from companies like Cabot Corporation. Useflil amounts of reinforcing agents are greater than 0 percent. More preferred amounts of fumed silicas are greater than 2 percent and most preferred amounts are greater than 3 percent. Useful amounts of fumed silica or treated fumed silica are less than 40 percent by weight. Moreuseful amounts of fumed silica in the compositions is less than 30 percent and most useful amounts of fumed silica is less than 25 percent by weight in the compositions.<br>
Small amounts of inhibitors, such as dipheriylamines or hindered phenols, may be used, for example, to prevent or reduce degradation of the olefinic monomers during storage. Inhibitors may be added in an amount that does not materially reduce the rate of polymerization or the ultimate properties of an adhesive or other composition made therewith, typically 10 to 10,000 ppm (parts per million) based on the weight of the polymerizable monomers. For moisture curable compositions it may be useful to include, compounds for scavenging fugitive moisture in the composition before it reacts with the active component.<br>
Polymerizable compositions according to the invention may be used in wide variety of ways, including as sealants, coatings, primers, to modify the surface of polymers, and injection molding resins. They may also be used as matrix resins in conjunction with glass and metal fiber mats such as in resin transfer molding operations. They may further be used as encapsulants and potting compounds such as in the manufacture of electrical components, printed circuit boards and the like. Quite desirably, they provide polymerizable adhesive compositions that can bond a diverse myriad of substrates, including polymers, wood, ceramics, concrete, glass and primed metals. Another desirable related application is their use in promoting adhesion of paints to low surface energy<br><br>
substrates such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethyleneterephthalate, polyamides, and polytetrafluoroethylene, and their co-polymers. In ths embodiment the composition is coated onto the surface of the substrate to modify tie surface to enhance the adhesion of the final coating to the surface of the substrate.<br>
The compositions of the invention can be used in coating applications. In such applications the composition may further comprise a carrier such as a solvent. The coating may flirther contain additives well known to those skilled in the art for use coatings, such as pigments to color the coating, inhibitors and UV stabilizers. The compositions may also be applied as powder coatings and may contain the additives well known to those skilled in the art for use in powder coatings.<br>
The compositions of the invention can also be used to modify the surface of a polymeric molded part, extruded film or contoured object. Compositions of the invention can also be used to change the functionality of a polymer particle by surface grafting of polymer chains on to the unmodified plastic substrate.<br>
Polymerizable compositions of the invention are especially useful for adhesively bonding low surface energy plastic or polymeric substrates that historically have been very difficult to bond without using complicated surface preparation techniques, priming, etc. By low surface energy substrates is meant materials that have a surface energy of 45 mJ/m2 or less, more preferably 40 mJ/m2 or less and most preferably 35 mJ/m2 or less. Included among such materials are polyethylene, polypropylene, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, polyamides, syndiotactic polystyrene, olefin containing block co-polymers, and fluorinated polymers such as polytetrafluoroethlene (TEFLON™) which has a surface energy of less than 20 mJ/m2 (The expression "surface energy" is often used synonymously with "critical wetting tension" by others.) Other polymers of somewhat higher surface energy that may be usefully bonded with the compositions of the invention include polycarbonate, polymethylmethacrylate, and polyvinylchloride.<br>
The polymerizable compositions of the invention can be easily used as two* part adhesives. The components of the polymerizable compositions are blended as would normally be done when working with such materials. The decomplexing agent for the organoborane amine complex is usually included with the olefinic, polymerizable component so as to separate it from the organoborane amine complex, thus providhg one-<br><br>
part of the two-part composition. The organoborane amine complex of the polymerization initiator system provides the second part of the composition and is added to the first part shortly before it is desired to use the composition. Similarly, catdyst for the siloxane polymerization is kept separate from at least one component of the siloxane functional compounds involved with polymerization. The appropriate catalyst for siloxane polymerization may be added to the first part directly or it may bepre-dissolved in an appropriate carrier such as a reactive olefinic monomer, thai is, methyl methacrylate or a MMA/PMMA viscous solution.<br>
For a two-part adhesive such as those of the invention to be most easily used in commercial and industrial environments, the volume ratio at which the two-parts are combined should be a convenient whole number. This facilitates application of the adhesive with conventional, commercially available dispensers. Such dispensers are shown in US Patent Nos. 4,538,920 and 5,082,147 (incorporated herein by reference) and are available from Conprotec, Inc. (Salem NJ) under the trade name MIXPAC. Typically, these dispensers use a pair of tubular receptacles arranged side-by-side with each tube being intended to receive one of the two-parts of the adhesive. Two plungers, one for each tube, are simultaneously advanced (for example, manually or by a hand-actuated ratcheting mechanism) to evacuate the contents of the tubes into a common, hollow, elongated mixing chamber that may also contain a static mixer to facilitate blending of the two-parts. The blended adhesive is extruded from the mixing chamber onto a substrate. Once the tubes have been emptied, they can be replaced with fresh tubes and the application process continued.<br>
The ratio at which the two-parts of the adhesive are combined is controlled by the diameter of the tubes. (Each plunger is sized to be received within a tube of fixed diameter, and the plungers are advanced into the tubes at the same speed.) A single dispenser is often intended for use with a variety of different two-part adhesives and the plungers are sized to deliver the two-parts of the adhesive at a convenient mix ratio. Some common mix ratios are 1:1, 2:1, 4:1 and 10:1, but preferably less than 10:1 and more preferably less than 4:1.<br>
Preferably the mixed two-part compositions of the invention have a suitable viscosity to allow application without dripping. Preferably, the viscosities of the two<br><br>
individual components should be of the same order or magnitude. Preferably the mixed compositions have the viscosity of 100 (.1 Pa.S) centipoise or greater, more preferably 1,000 (1.0 Pa.S) centipoise or greater and most preferably 5,000 (5.0 Pa.S) centipoise or greater. Preferably the adhesive compositions have a viscosity of 150,000 (150 Pa.S) centipoise or less, more preferably 100,000 (lOOPa.S) centipoise or less and most preferably 50,000 (50 Pa.S) centipoise or less.<br>
In one embodiment the invention is a method for bonding two substrates together comprising<br>
A)	reacting a hydroxy terminated siloxane with a tetraalkoxy silicate dispersed in an acrylate resin in the presence of an silanol condensation catalyst as described hereinbefore, for instance an organo tin or titanate catalyst, under conditions such that a siloxane polymer dispersed in acrylate resin is prepared;<br>
B)	contacting the siloxane based polymer dispersed in acrylate resin with an organoborane amine complex;<br>
C)	contacting the composition of step B with an effective amount of a compound which causes the complex to disassociate;<br>
D)	contacting the two substrates with a composition according to step C located between the two substrates and allowing the adhesive to cure.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention allows for the use of the adhesive as a one-part composition. In this case a single tube will be used and applied in a simple manner without any complicated mixing prior to application. In this case it will be most beneficial to protect the components of the one-part adhesive from the introduction of any moisture prior to its application.<br>
Specific Embodiments<br>
The following examples are included for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the claims. Unless otherwise stated all parts and percentages are by weight.<br>
Preparation Of The Organoborane/Amine Complex<br>
50 cc of a 1M solution of organoborane, for example tributyl borane (TBB) in ether solution (Aldrich), was added to a weighed round bottom flask. The solution was<br><br>
purged with nitrogen. A weighed amount of the amine, for example, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysiloxane (14.35 gs 1:1.3 molar ratio of boron to amine), was added in small portions to the organoborane solution, maintaining the temperature below 40°C with an external ice bath. The amine was added to make a molar ratio of organoborane to amine of between 1:1 to 1:3. The solution was stirred for 30 minutes and then the solvent was removed on a rotary evaporator at less than 40°C. The weight of the flask and complex were periodically compared to the theoretical weight to assure that the solvent was completely removed. The complex was tested for pyrophonc reactivity by placing a drop on a paper towel and looking for charring of the towel. Some pyrophoric complexes can be made less or non-pyrophoric by adding additional amine (lowering the organoborane-.amine molar ratio).<br>
Preparation of Adhesive Compositions<br>
Two component (part) adhesives were produced as described below. One component (hardener) included the organoborane amine complex mixed with non-mutually reactive siloxane functional components, for example, catalytically reactive siloxanes without catalyst. In some cases the borane amine complex and the siloxane containing materials were diluted with methylmethacrylate (MMA) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), or other fillers, so as to obtain an appropriate mixing volume or viscosity. The other component (resin) contained other components of the siloxane functional components for reaction with the first component, acrylic resin and an optional decomplexing agent (for the organoborane amine complex), for example, acrylic acid or an isocyanate, such as, isophorone diisocyanate. The acrylic resin was a mixture of methylmethacrylate (MMA) and optionally polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). The MMA and PMMA were stirred or rotated overnight to mix the PMMA into the MMA. Siloxane reaction catalyst(s), tougheners and fillers, such glass beads, can be added to either side as long as they do not interfere with the shelf life of the adhesive components.<br>
The adhesive may be mixed at the desired volume ratio in air, in a bag, or through a pressurized gun. The adhesive was applied to test strips 1 inch (25.4 mm) wide by 0.125 inch (3.2 mm) thick with a 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) overlap, using polypropylene for low temperature, or using Nylon, Syndiotactic Polystyrene (sPS)/Nylon, or e-coated steel for high temperature and tested for adhesive strength as described hereinafter. The adhesive<br><br>
components were mixed and applied to one or both substrates. Adhesive thickness may be controlled by the addition of a few weight percent of glass beads to achieve the desired bond line thickness, for instance between 0.005 to 0.030 inches in diameter (0.13 mm to 0.76 mm). The coupons were mated to provide 0.25 inch squared (80 mm2) to 1.0 inch squared (645 mm2) substrate overlap in a lap-shear testing configuration. The samples were held in place with metal binder clips to provide constant force and facilitate the elimination of air bubbles in the adhesive during cure. The bonded samples were usually cured for at least 24 hours before being mounted in a tensile testing apparatus (Instron) fitted with a sample oven. The samples were evaluated at crosshead speeds of 0.05 (0.13 mm) and 0.5 (13.0 mm) inches per minute for room temperature and high temperature (&gt;100 °C) testing conditions, respectively. Maximum load (pounds) to break were recorded and maximum stress (psi) was calculated by dividing this load by the overlap area (inches squared). For high temperature testing the test strip was equilibrated to the desired temperature in the Instron tester's oven for at least 5 minutes before the test was started.<br>

Examples 1-6<br>
Examples 1-6 describe the performance of catalysts of the present invention useful for making adhesives. These trialkylborane amine catalysts showedgood to excellent thermal stability, provide functionality for crosslinking silanol functional materials, and provide excellent adhesion to low surface energy plastic substrates. In all cases the catalyst was added at 4 percent weight of the total adhesive to a formulation consisting of acrylic resin and 4 percent acrylic acid. The "take-off' temperature presented in Table 1 was the temperature at which the organoborane amine catalyst thermally decomplexes and the resin (MMA and PMMA) begins to polymerize. The polymerization is seen as an increase in the viscosity of the mixture, which was continuously monitored with a viscometer during a linear heat ramp<br>
(~1 degree C per minute). In ail examples the complexes did not exhibit pyrophoncity. The siloxane functional amines furthermore provide functionality to the amines not otherwise available. The results are demonstrated in Table 1.<br><br><br>
Examples 7-16 demonstrated that adhesives of the present invention formulated with catalysts of the present invention can provide excellent adhesion to low surface energy substrates. In all cases the substrate was PET and the adhesive was formulated with 50 percent 44,000 molecular weight (MWT) PDMS-OH, 5 percent (methacryloxypropy^trimethoxysiloxane, 1 percent DBTDA, 3 percent Cabosil 610 with the balance made up with tnethylmethacrylate monomer. The catalyst was tributylborane (TBB) complexed with a 1.1 or 1.5 mole of the indicated amine per mole of TBB. The adhesive contained 4 percent of the catalyst complex. The results are compiled in Table 2. The Lap shear testing was performed at room temperature (RT) of 25 °C. In all cases the failure was cohesive adhesive, which means the substrate surfaces both had adhesive coatings after failure.<br><br><br>
of promoting excellent adhesion to low surface energy substrates using adhesives of the present invention. The data also show that the catalysts are effective under a variety of initiating stoichiometries. Examples 9 and 10 show that these catalysts can be initiated with isocyanate functionalized siloxanes that similarly provide siloxane functionality for reaction with silanols and promote adhesion to veiy low surface energy plastic subs totes.<br>
Examples 17-21 and Comparative A<br>
Examples 17-21, relative to Comparative A, demonstrated the effect of small amounts of siloxane polymer to enhance the toughness of brittle acrylic formulations for adhesion to low surface energy iPP substrates. In all experiments the siloxane polymer wa the reaction product of a 4:1 wt. ratio of 250 equivalent weightPDMS-OH with TMOS catalyzed with 0.1 percent of DBTDA based on total adhesive weight The free radical polymerization was catalyzed by addition of H-29, initiated with ICEMAN. Comparative Example A was an identical system but without a PDMS/TMOS component The brittle/ductile nature of samples was determined according to ASTM D746. The results are compiled in Table 3.<br><br><br>
Examples 17-21 and Comparative Example A show that the incorporation of siloxane functional polymer into an acrylic resin can significantly enhance die room temperature toughness of the adhesive applied to very low surface energy substrates. These examples also demonstrate that the adhesive can be formulated with the siloxane polymer pre-reacted within the adhesive prior to application. Bond displacement means the yield distance of the bond line prior to break. Brittle means that the adhesive fails and ruptures at a set tension and elongation. Ductility is elongation after yield in a uniaxial tension test. Ductile failure is indicated by a measurable irreversible deformation of the adhesive prior to failure and is indicated by failure of the bond line, cohesively, with multiple initiation sites. The determination of the Ductile Brittle failure is made by examination of the failed bondline. See Properties of Polymers, chapter 10s by D. W. van Kreulen, Elsevier Publishing, 1972.<br>
Examples 22-27<br>
Examples 22-27 demonstrated the effect of silicone functional crosslinker on the measured adhesion of adhesives. All substrates were PET. All indicated fractional amounts are weight fractions based on total adhesive weight. All adhesives were formulated using 50 percent 44,000 MWT (number average) PDMS-OH, 1 percent DBTDA, 4 percent H-29, 4 percent IPDI, and 3 percent Cabosil 530. The balance was acrylic resin from which substitution was made with crosslinker. The crosslinker was in<br><br>
each case was (acryloxypropyl)trimethoxysiloxane which is capable of crosslinking the silioxane and acrylic phases together. Lap shear testing was performed on samples of each example according to the procedures described hereinbefore at a temperature of 25°C. The results are compiled in Table 4.<br><br>
formulations, that the preferred concentration of crosslinker was between 2 percent and 10 percent of the total adhesive weight, and that formulations of this invention were capable of achieving excellent adhesion to this low surface energy substrate.<br>
Examples 28-32<br>
Examples 28-32 were formulated with 5 percent (acryloxypropyl)trimethoxysiloxane, 1 percent DBTDA, 4 percent H-29, 4 percent IPDI, 3 percent Cabosil 610, with the balance made up of acrylic resin from which substitution was made to include the indicated amount of 44,000 MWT PDMS-OH. In all cases the failure was cohesive adhesive. Lap shear tests were performed using PET and iPP substrates at a temperature of 25°C. The results are compiled in Table 5.<br><br><br>
adhesive is siloxane and that adhesion can be obtained on very low surface energy substrates.<br>
Examples 33-42<br>
An alternative method of crosslinking phases of polymer blends was to chemically bond the ends of one phase to the other phase. Such block copolymers were then chemically dispersed as a function of the phase separation kinetics and the molecular weights of the blocks. Materials such as (methacryloxypropyl)methyl-siloxane dimethylsiloxane copolymer was an example of a material capable of forming a phase separated structure whose dispersion was dependent on the molecular block lengths. In all cases the compositions comprised 44,000 molecular weight PDMS-OH, the indicated acrylate end functionalized siloxane with either 1000-2000 centistoke (0.001 to 0.002 M?s) viscosity (RMS-33) or 2000-3000 centistoke (0.002 to 0.003 MVs) viscosity (RMS-83), (methacryloxypropyl)trimethoxysiloxane (MPTMS) was used as the crosslinker, and Cabosil 610 surface treated filmed silica was used as a structural filler. In all cases the free radical polymerization was catalyzed by addition of a 1:1.05 molar ratio complex of TBB:MOPA (2 percent in adhesive) and initiated with 2 percent based on total adhesive weight addition of IPDL In all cases the siloxane polymerization was catalyzed by 2 percent addition of DBTDA based on total adhesive weight. The balance of the formulation was methyl methacrylate. Lap shear testing on the substrate indicated was performed<br><br>
according to the procedure described hereinbefore at a temperature of 25°C.   The results are compiled in Table 6.<br><br>
compositions of the present invention can result in excellent adhesives for very low surface energy plastic substrates. All failures were ca.<br>
Examples 43 and Comparative B-D<br>
Example 43 compared a formulation of the current invention with 3 commercial silicone RTV-1 adhesives of the Dow Corning Corporation. The RTV-1 adhesive of the present invention is formulated from components in the following weights: 2 grams 44,000 molecular weight hydroxy terminated PDMS, 3 grams of acrylic resin, 0.28 grams ethyltriacetoxy siloxane, 0.1 grams DBTDA, and 0.5 grams Cabosil 530.<br>
These were applied as one part adhesives to the substrates. The comparative materials were applied from freshly opened tubes. In all cases the substrate was PET. Lap<br><br>
shear testing on the substrate indicated was performed according to the procedure described hereinbefore at a temperature of 25°C. The results are compiled in Table 7.<br><br>
adhesion to low surface energy substrates that was not obtained by conventional silicone adhesives on the same substrates. DC-738, DC-739 and DC-832 are one part RTV siloxane adhesives available from Dow Corning Corporation, Midland, Michigan; "ca" meant cohesive adhesive failure "a" meant the adhesive has delaminated from the substrate with no apparent transfer of the adhesive to the substrate.<br>
Examples 44-46<br>
Examples 44-46 were performed to provide evidence that the free radical and siloxane polymerization chemistry could be equally and effectively performed simultaneously using moisture cure chemistry to provide excellent room temperature adhesion to low surface energy substrates. Hie RTV-1 experiments took advantage of the hydrolysis of ethyltriacetoxysiloxane to provide initiation of the free radical polymerization and tin or alkoxy titanium catalysts to initiate moisture cure of alkyloxysiloxanes and hydroxy siloxanes. Hie adhesives of Hie experiments were prepared with 5.4 grams of acrylic resin, 3 grams of 44,000 MWT PDMS-OH, 0.7 grams of ethyltriacetoxysiloxane, 0.3 grams of tin (II) catalyst or titanium (IV) and 0.4 grams of H-29. The adhesive composition was mixed in a glass vessel and applied as a one part adhesive. In all cases the substrate was PET. The lap shear tests were performed at 25°C. The results are compiled in Table 8. All failures were cohesive adhesive.<br><br><br>
The data in Table 8 showed that RTV-1 moisture cure adhesives of the present invention using alternative catalysts are capable of providing excellent adhesion to low surface energy substrates.<br>
Examples 47-51<br>
In Examples 47-51 the adhesive was formulated from a mixture of 8.8 grams acrylic resin, 0.8 grams ethyltriacetoxysiloxane and 0.4 grams H-29. A small and variable amount of ketiminopropyltriethoxysiloxane was added to improve shelf life. The adhesive composition was mixed in a glass vessel and applied as a one part adhesive. The lap shear tests were performed at 25 °C. The results are compiled in Table 9.<br><br>
technology with excellent shelf life and that provided excellent adhesion to low surface energy susbstrates. The data in Table 9 showed that a single component adhesive could provide room temperature adhesion to low surface energy substrates with no surface pre-treatment and maintain excellent shelf life. Other additives such as tertiary amines could<br><br>
similarly extend shelf life. Shelf life means herein that the formulated adhesive maintained workability and demonstrated adhesion to the substrate after being allowed to sit undisturbed at room temperature in a moisture free container. Poor shelf life meant the adhesive lost workability and the ability to adhere to a substrate. Workability meant that the adhesive could be applied to the surface of a substrate by conventional means.<br>
Examples 52-56<br>
Examples 52-56 showed that progressively adding surface treated fumed silica has a beneficial effect, lip to a limit, on Hie measured adhesion of the present invention on a low energy surface substrate. All adhesives of the woe formulated from 50 percent 44,000 MWT PDMS-OH, 5 percent (acryloxypropyl)trimethoxysiloxane, 1 percent DBTDA, 4 percent H-29, 2 percent IPDI, and MMA. Cabosil 530 Fumed Silica was added at varying level in the examples as detailed in Table 10 and these additions were made by substitution for MMA. The lap shear tests were performed at 25 °C. The results are compiled in Table 10. In all cases the substrate was PET and the failure mode was ca.<br><br>
Examples 57-75 demonstrated the ability of adhesives of the present invention to obtain excellent adhesion to low surface energy substrates using a vinyl polymerization (addition) mechanism. The adhesive consists of 2600 Mn poly(dimethylsiloxane-co-methylhydrosiloxane)s hydride terminated that was 26 percent by weight of methylhydrosiloxane and 1000 cP (centipoise) (1 Pa.s) divinyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane. The siloxane polymerization is catalyzed using 0.1 molar Pt (0) complexed in 1,3-divinyl 1,1,3,3 tetramethyl siloxane. The free radical polymerization was<br><br>
carried out using a tributylborane complex with isophorone diamine in a 1:1.1 equivalence ratio (H28") and is initiated by reaction of the borane amine catalyst with isophoronediisocyanate. In many cases additional amine and isocyanate were added to the formulation to improve adhesive physical properties. In the formulations VS5500 glass balloons and Cabosil 530 fumed silica were added as fillers. In each case MMA was used as a monomer for the free radical polymerization. All weights were in grams. Part 1 comprised: VS 5500 glass beads; 8 parts of H28\ except Example 70 wherein it was present in 6 parts; PdV; IPDA; and PDMSH. In examples 75, 2 parts of Cabosil 530 fumed silica was also used. Part 2 of the adhesive compositions contained 11 parts of Cabosil 530 fumed silica, except Example 73 which contained 10 parts; IPDI; Pt(0) complex; methyl methacrylate. The formulations were designed to provide approximately 1:1 volumetric ratio. Lap shear tests were performed at room temperature on iPP and PET substrates. Table 11 shows the amounts of the components that varied in the examples and the results.<br><br><br><br>
excellent adhesion to very low surface energy substrates at room temperature with no surface pre-treatment<br>
Examples 76-78 and Comparative E<br>
Examples 76-78 and Comparative Example E were performed to demonstrate that adhesives of the present invention provide low temperature performance not achievable by other adhesives. The flexible adhesives of the present invention were distinguished by possessing very low ductile brittle transition temperatures, and providing flexible adhesion not possible using other adhesive compositions. All examples in Table 12 contained 44,000 MWT PDMS-OH, (aciyloxypropyl)trimethylsiloxane, 1 percent DBTDA, 3 percent<br><br>
Cabosil, 4 percent H-29, 2 percent IPDI based on total adhesive weight with the balance made up with methyl methacrylate). The comparative aciylic resin formulation consists of 15 percent by weight 75,000 MWT PMMA co butyl acrylate (5 percent butyl content), 35 percent butyl acrylate and 50 percent 2-ethylhexy methacrylate. Adhesives were formulated with the above resin and catalyzed by 4 percent H-29 and initiated by 2 percent IPDI. Lap shear testing of the adhesives on PET substrates at room temperature was performed. The results are compiled in Table 12. All examples demonstrated cohesive adhesive failure to low surface energy substrates.<br><br>
Formulations of the present invention work very well on all tested low surface energy substrates with minimal sensitivity to substrate identity. As well as providing excellent flexibility to very low temperatures, the adhesives of the present invention furthermore work well at high temperature, consistent with their crosslinked chemical structure. Examples 80-91 demonstrated the utility of the invention in providing wide latitude in application. In Table 13 the formulations contained the indicated weight percent of 44,000 MWT PDMS-OH. In all cases the free radical polymerization was initiated with IPDI at 2 percent of the total adhesive weight and 4 percent of H29 and the balance of the adhesive was made up with MMA. All samples were crosslinked with 5 percent addition of acyloxypropyltrimethoxysiloxane. The formulations also contained 3 percent Cabosil TS-610 fumed silica and 2 percent DBTDA based on total adhesive weight. The adhesives were initiated using 4 percent of H29. Bond lines were in all cases 0.005<br><br>
inches (0.127 mm) using glass beads to insure gap uniformity. The comparative samples were from a commercial Dow Coming silicone adhesive labeled DC-832. Lap shear testing of the adhesives on substrates listed at room temperature was performed. The results are compiled in Table 13. All failures were ca except the comparative samples, which were adhesive.<br><br>
Example 91 illustrated the ability of the present invention to incorporate further functionality by co-polymerizing a thermosetting minor phase. A minor epoxy<br><br>
phase was incorporated into the PDMS and acrylic phases. The adhesivewas 30 percent 44,000 MWT PDMSOH, 16 percent DER 331, 3 percent SnCl4 (epoxy catalyst), 3 percent Cabosil TS-530, 3 percent IPDI, 4 percent H-29, 31 percent MMA, 3 percent glycidyl methacrylate, 3 percent (3-glycidoxypropyl)trimethoxysiloxane, and 2 percent DBTDA. PET substrates were adhered in a lap shear configuration using the fomiulation and allowed to cure at room temperature for 48 hours. The sample was subsequently tested and gave a lap shear strength of 362 psi (2496 kPa) with a cohesive adhesive failure mode. This result showed that it is possible to incorporate an epoxy phase in conjunction with the acrylic, PDMS, and polyurea phases seen in the previous examples.<br><br><br>
