(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br><br><br>
NOVEL HYDROPHOBICALLY MODIFIED CATIONIC POLYMERS AND PERSONAL CARE COMPOSITIONS THEREOF<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
2008<br><br>
-   1   -<br>
NOVEL HYDROPHOBICA1XY MODIFIED CATIONIC POLYMERS AND PERSONAL CARE COMPOSITIONS THEREOF<br>
5<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to novel cationic polymers which have sufficient charge density and are modified in<br>
10  such way as to interact directly with benefit agents (e.g., optical modifier particles such as mica or talc and polar and non-polar oils) without the necessity of interaction with anionic surfactants, to enhance deposition of the particles.  The novel polymers   can be used,   for example,   in<br>
15  personal care compositions (e.g., bars, liquids, creams, lotions}, particularly personal wash-off and rinse-off compositions (rinse-off bars or liquids) to enhance deposition from such compositions.<br>
20<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The use of cationic polymers to enhance deposition of particles has been disclosed, for example, by applicants.<br>
25  In several of applicants' co-pending applications (e.g., U.S. Publication No. 2005/0227882 to Tsaur et al.; Publication No. 2005/0233916 to Polonka et al.), for example/ applicants disclose compositions comprising cationic polymer as part of a deposition system for<br>
30  delivering particles providing optical benefits.  In these applications, however, cationic polymers interact with<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
anionic surfactant to form a precipitate or coacervate which enhances deposition of particles.<br>
In co-pending U.S. Serial Nos. 11/370,109 and 11/370,267, 5  both to Polonka et al., the "deposition system' (cationic polymer/anionic surfactant) forms individually on particles to be deposited.  The thus "coated" particles interact with air to form a foam lather structure and particles are deposited predominantly from lather in use.  The individual<br>
10  deposition system chemistry still, however, is dependent on anionic surfactant interacting with cationic particles. None of the above references disclose the novel modified polymers of the invention or the use of these hydrophobically modified cationic polymers to interact<br>
15  directly with benefit agent (e.g., benefit agent particles), without need of anionic surfactant as part of deposition system, to enhance  benefit agent deposition.  Benefit agents with which hydrophobically modified cationics can react can, in principle, include emulsions of silicones or oils to the<br>
20  extent the emulsion is naturally negatively charged, it will interact with the modified cationic to enhance deposition.<br>
U.S. Application No. 2004/0223993 to Clapp et al. disclose direct hydrophobic modification of particles, but not the 25  hydrophobically modified cationic polymers of the invention. U.S. Patent No. 6,780,826 to Zhang discloses deposition of particles based on particle geometry.<br>
In a reference entitled "Effects of low-level substitution 30  on conditioning properties of cationic cellulosic polymers in shampoo systems", Journal of Cosmetic Science, volume 55,<br><br>
-   3   -<br>
pages S195-S205 (2004), T.V. Drovetskaya et al. disclose quaternized hydroxyethylcellulose polymers having hydrophobic character due to grafting of dimethyl dodecyl ammonium groups onto the cellulose backbone.  The product is 5  known commercially as Polymer SL®.  Cationic substitution is achieved with trimethyl ammonium grafts.<br>
In Polymer SL®, the degree of cationic substitution is fixed as   0.2, meaning  that one in five anhydroglucose units<br>
10  contains a quaternized graft. This level of modified cation corresponds to 1% nitrogen.  Since the repeat unit molecular weight for a cellulose backbone with this level of cationic grafts is about 300, this material has a cationic charge density of 0.7 milli-equivalents per gram.  Polymers of the<br>
15  subject invention have charge density &gt;2  meq/g, preferably &gt;2.5 meq/g, more preferably &gt;4 meq/g.<br>
Zhao et al. of Chinese Academy of Sciences published a paper entitled "Synthesis and Flocculation Properties of Poly 2 0  (dialkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride - vinyl<br>
trimethoxysilane) and poly (diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride-acrylamide-vinyl trimethoxysilane) in Journal of Applied Polymer Sciences, Volume 84, pp 335-342 (2002) .<br>
25  Zhao discloses the use of polymers as flocculants for water treatment.  Polymers use relatively low levels of hydrophobe (less than 10 mole% compared to those of invention which we use 10 mol% and greater) since higher levels are said to lead to insolubility.  Zhao further does not teach or<br>
30  suggest use of hydrophobically modified cationic polymers in personal care compositions, but only is concerned with<br><br>
-   4   -<br>
flocculants for water treatment.  There is no disclosure of personal wash compositions comprising cleansing surfactant (with at least 5% surfactant) and/or benefit agents (e.g., optical modifier particles; or emulsions), or that modified 5  cationic polymer enhanced deposition of particles (even in absence  of specific anionics).<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
10  Unexpectedly, applicants have found novel hydrophobically<br>
modified cationic polymers having a charge density exceeding about 2 milli-equivalents per gram.  The novel polymers can be used, for example, to enhance deposition of benefiting agents  in personal care cleansing compositions comprising<br>
15  at least about 5% surfactant.<br>
In one embodiment/ the invention comprises novel hydrophobically modified cationic polymers (i.e., modified at least 10 mol%) of at least certain charge density. 20<br>
These polymers comprise water-soluble (by water soluble is meant having a solubility in water in excess of 0.1%) terpolymer having general structure:<br>
25	(-A-)i (-B-)j (-C-)K<br>
wherein co-monomer A represents a cationic repeating unit defined as possessing one or more cationic charges over the pH range 4 to 10; co-monomer B represents an uncharged, water 30      insoluble (by water insoluble is meant having a solubility in water which is less than 0.1%) repeating unit consisting<br><br>
of either a hydrophobic backbone or possessing a hydrophobic pendant group, in either case consisting of from 3 to 20 C1 to C3 alkylene (preferably methylene) groups, and from 1 to 3 C1 to C3 alkyl (preferably methyl) groups; and co-monomer C 5  represents a repeating unit chosen so as to modify the overall polymer properties;<br>
wherein the indices i, j, and k represent the number of times the respective monomer unit is repeated in the polymer 10  chain, with the proviso that the ratio j/i is from about 0.1 to about 0.4 and that the ratio k/i is from about 0.0 to about 0.5<br>
In a second embodiment, the invention comprises personal 15  care cleansing compositions comprising:<br>
(1)  0,5 to 85%, preferably 5 to 75% by wt. cleansing surfactant (i.e., surfactant providing detergency);<br>
20       (2)  0.1 to 10% by wt., preferably 1 to 9% by wt. benefit agent; and (3)  0.01 to 5%, preferably 0.05 to 3% by wt. of the water soluble terpolymer described above except that, in the compositions of this embodiment of<br>
25	the invention,, ratio of j/i can be broader, i.e.,<br>
0.01 to 0.4 rather than 0.1 to 0.4.<br><br>
-   6   -<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel  cationic polymers 5  which have both a sufficiently large charge density (defined by co-monomer A having a charge density X3 milli-equivalents per gram, and/or the entire polymer having a charge density &gt; 2.0,  preferably &gt;2.5 milli-equivalents per gram) and sufficient hydrophobic modification (defined by a co-monomer<br>
10  B having a pendant group whose equivalent alkane carbon number (EACN) is &gt;4 and present at such a level that the ratio  of monomer B to monomer A (ratio of j/i) lies in the range from about 0.1 to about 0.4) to, for example, enhance deposition of benefit agents in compositions.  It is<br>
15  important to note that the resulting polymer must still be water soluble.<br>
Novel hydrophobically modified  cationic polymers as defined above are believed able to interact directly with benefit<br>
20  agent (independent of whether or not they are formulated with anionic surfactant) to enhance deposition of the agents.  While previous art has contemplated use of cationic polymer to interact with anionic surfactant and help particle deposition; or contemplated hydrophobic<br>
25  modification of benefit agent particles themselves to<br>
enhance particle deposition, to applicant's knowledge, the art has never contemplated directly modifying a high charge density cationic polymer, or noted the effect of such polymer on benefit agent deposition (e.g., in personal<br>
30  compositions).<br><br>
-   8   -<br>
In another embodiment, the invention relates to personal care compositions comprising the modified cationic polymers, with the only difference that polymers have hydrophobic modification in those compositions defined to be present at 5  such level that ratio of B to monomer A is in the range 0.01 to 0.4.<br>
In this regard, polymers of the invention can be used in cleansing compositions, i.e., composition comprising at 10  least about 5% surfactant and further comprising both the above noted cationic polymer (having broader ratio of B to monomer A) and benefit agent to be deposited.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of enhancing 15  deposition of benefit agents, particularly those providing an optical benefit comprising formulating a composition comprising at least about 5% surfactant, benefit agent and the defined cationic polymer.<br>
20  The invention is set forth more particularly below:<br>
More specifically, the invention comprises novel terpolymer having the general structure:<br>
25	(-A-)i (-B-)j (-C-)k<br>
wherein co-monomer A is a cationic repeating unit possessing one or more cationic charges when measured at a pH of 4 to 10; 30  wherein co-monomer B is an uncharged, water insoluble<br>
(solubility in water of less than 0.1%)  repeating unit<br><br>
_   9   _<br>
comprising at least one hydrophobic portion which is part of the co-monomer backbone or a pendant group attached to the backbone and which hydrophobic portion is defined as comprising 3 to 20  C1 to C3, preferably C1, alkylene groups 5  and from 1 to 3 C1 to C3, preferably C1 alkyl groups such that eguivalent alkane carbon number (EACN) of the pendant group is &gt;4;<br>
wherein co-monomer C is a repeating unit selected to modify solubility (preferably make more water soluble) of the<br>
10  overall polymer;<br>
wherein i, j, and k represent the number of times each respective monomer is repeated in the polymer claim, with the proviso that ratio of j/i is from 0.1 to 0.4 (except that it has ratio of 0.01 to 0.4 when used in compositions<br>
15  of the invention) and ratio of k/i is from 0.0 to 0.5 and<br>
such that the sum of i + j + k falls into the broad range of 100 (MW ~ 10,000) to 20,000 (MW ~ 106) .<br>
It is an important aspect of the invention that the modified 20  cationic polymer have both sufficient charge density and hydrophobic modification in order to provide a deposition chemistry (e.g., through interaction of modified cationic and benefit agent) for benefit agent (e.g., particles, emulsions)  which might be present in compositions in which 25  the modified cationic polymer may be used.<br>
Thus, preferably the cationic charge density of co-monomer A should be at &gt;3 milli equivalents of charge per gram of monomer units, more preferably &gt;4 meq/gm, more preferably &gt;5 30  meq/gm and even more preferably &gt;6 meq/gm; and/or the<br><br>
-   10   -<br>
density of the entire polymer should be &gt;2,   preferably &gt;2.5 meq/gm polymer.<br>
The polymer is preferably chosen so ratio of i (representing 5  monomer A) to i + j + k will yield charge density &gt; 2, preferably &gt;2.5 meq/gm per total polymer.<br>
The copolymer preferably is also chosen such that repeating unit B has a pendant side chain carrying an EACN of at least<br>
10 4,   more preferably of at least 8, most preferably of at<br>
least 10.  As an upper limit the pendant chain would likely have an  EACN of 18 or less, as higher EACN chains are difficult to copolymerize and would render the resulting copolymer water insoluble.<br>
15<br>
The equivalent alkane carbon number concept was introduced by L. Cash et al., in "The application of low interfacial tension scaling rules to binary hydrocarbon mixtures", Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, volume 59, pages<br>
20  39-44, 1977.  The interfacial tension of water with mixtures of oils was correlated by these authors using the EACN to describe the oil mixture as follows: EACN = XA EACNR + XB EACNa.  Here XA and XB are the mole fractions of oil component A and B, respectively, each oil being described by<br>
25  an individual EACN.  This EACN is in turn described as the<br>
number of carbons in the longest, linear segment that can be identified in a cyclic or non-linear oil.  The EACN concept is a convenient way to compare linear and non-linear oils in terms of their interaction with water.<br>
30<br><br>
-   11   -<br>
The copolymer is further preferably chosen and nature of B selected such that ratio of j to i falls into the range of about 0.1 to about 0.4 (keeping in mind that the resulting polymer must still be water soluble).  Again, this ratio is 5  the broader 0.01 to 0.4  when polymer is used in<br>
compositions of this second embodiment of the invention.<br>
The copolymer may further be further selected so that repeating C unit partially replaces unit B in order to make 10  the polymer more water soluble.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the sum of i + j + k corresponds to polymer having molecular wt. in range of 10,000 to 2,000,000.<br>
15<br>
As indicated co-monomer C is optional (controls water solubility depending on hydrophobicity which is established through co-co-mononer B) and, in one embodiment, the ratio of k/i can be effectively zero.  In another preferred<br>
20  embodiment, C is chosen to have an amine functionality.  It is believed that amine functionality can promote peptide bonding/binding with the proteins/amino acids on skin and so improve substantivity.<br>
25  Cationic Monomers corresponding to repeating unit A can be chosen, for example, from a list including 2-acryloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (AETAC), methacryloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (METAC), dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride (DMDAAC), acrylamidopropyl trimethyl<br>
30  ammonium chloride (APTAC), methacrylamidopropyl trimethyl<br><br>
-   12   -<br>
ammonium chloride (MAPTAC), and methyl quaternized vinyl imidazole.<br>
Hydrophobic monomers corresponding to repeating unit B below 5  can be chosen, for example, from a list including n-dodecyl methacrylamide (DMA), n-(n-octadecyl acrylamide) (ODA), and n-tert-octylacrylamide (tOA) and other.  The EACN of the pendant groups on these co-monomers are DMA = 12, ODA = 8, and tOA = 4.<br>
10<br>
Co-monomers corresponding to repeating unit C below can be chosen from any of the water-soluble monomers containing primary, secondary, or tertiary amine functional groups, including amides and imides, as well as alcohols.  Such co-<br>
15  monomers include acrylamide, methacrylamide,<br>
dimethylacrylamide, isopropylacrylamide, acrylylglycinamide, methacrylylglycinamide, vinyl oxazolidone, vinyl methyloxazolidone, vinyl pyrrolidone, and vinyl alcohol.<br>
20  In a second embodiment, polymers of the invention may be used in personal care compositions (e.g., bars, liquid, creams etc.), especially rinse-off personal wash compositions (e.g., bars, liquids) in which the novel co¬polymers of the invention enhance deposition of benefit<br>
25  agents, for  example, optical benefit agent particles.  An example of said compositions is:<br>
(1)  0.5 to 85%, preferably 3 to 80%, more preferably 5<br>
to 75% by wt. of a cleansing surfactant (i.e.,<br>
30	surfactant providing detergency);<br><br>
-   13   -<br>
(2)	0.1 to 10% by wt., preferably 1 to 9% by  wt. of a benefit agent; and<br>
(3)	0.01 to 5%, preferably 0.05 to 3% by wt. of a water-soluble (by water soluble is meant having<br>
5	solubility in excess of 0.1% in water) terpolymer<br>
having the structure noted above and as defined above.<br>
Surfactants<br>
10<br>
The surfactant can be any of  the thousands of anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants, zwitterionic surfactants cationic surfactants and mixtures clearly as are well known in the art.<br>
15<br>
Anionic surfactants include, but are certainly not limited to aliphatic sulphate, aliphatic sulfonate (e.g., C5 to C22 sulfonate or disulfonate), aromatic sulfonate (e.g., alkyl benzene sulfonate), alkyl sulfoccinates, alkyl and acyl<br>
2 0  taurates, alkyl and acyl sarcosinates, sulfoacetates, alkyl phosphates, carboxylates, isethionates, etc.<br>
Zwitterionic and Amphoteric Surfactants<br>
25  Zwitterionic surfactants are exemplified by those which can be broadly described as derivatives of aliphatic quaternary ammonium, phosphonium, and sulfonium compounds, in which the aliphatic radicals can be straight or branched chain, and wherein one of the aliphatic substituents contains from<br>
30  about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms and one contains an anionic<br><br>
-   14   -<br>
group, e.g., carboxy, sulfonate, sulfate, phosphate, or phosphonate.  A general formula for these compounds is:<br>
(R3)x<br>
5	1<br>
R2-Y(+) -CH2-R4Z[-]<br>
wherein R2 contains an alkyl, alkenyl, or hydroxy alkyl radical of from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms, from 0 to<br>
10  about 10 ethylene oxide moieties and from 0 to about 1<br>
glyceryl moiety; Y is selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur atoms; R3 is an alkyl or monohydroxyalkyl  group containing about 2 to about 3  carbon atoms; X is 1 when Y is a sulfur atom, and 2 when Y is a<br>
15  nitrogen or phosphorus atom (note that when x is 2, the R3 groups are attached to Y by two different bonds); 'R4 is an alkylene or hydroxyalkylene of from about 1 to about 4 carbon atoms and Z is a radical selected from the group consisting of carboxylate, sulfonate, sulfate, phosphonate,<br>
20  and phosphate groups.<br>
Amphoteric detergents which may be used in this invention include at least one acid group.  This may be a carboxylic or a sulphonic acid group.  They include quaternary nitrogen 25  and therefore are quaternary amido acids.  They should generally include an alkyl or alkenyl group of 7 to 18 carbon atoms.  They will usually comply with an overall structural formula:<br><br>
-   15   -<br>
0	R2<br>
II	1<br>
R1   -   [-C-NH{CH2)n]m-N+-X-Y<br>
5	1<br>
R3<br>
where R1 is alkyl or alkenyl of 7 to 18 carbon atoms;<br>
10  R2 and R3 are each independently alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or carboxyalkyl of 1 to 3 carbon atoms;<br>
n is 2 to 4;<br>
15  m is 0 to 1;<br>
X is alkylene of 1 to 3 carbon atoms optionally substituted with hydroxyl, and<br>
20  Y is ~CO2- or -SO3-<br>
Nonionic Surfactants<br>
The nonionic which may be used includes in particular the 25  reaction products of compounds having a hydrophobic group and a reactive hydrogen atom, for example aliphatic alcohols, acids, amides or alkyl phenols with alkylene oxides, especially ethylene oxide either alone or with propylene oxide.  Specific nonionic detergent compounds are 30  alkyl (C6-C22) phenols-ethylene oxide condensates, the condensation products of aliphatic (C8-C18) primary or secondary linear or branched alcohols with ethylene oxide,<br><br>
-   16   -<br>
and products made by condensation of ethylene oxide with the reaction products of propylene oxide and ethylenediamine. Other so-called nonionic detergent compounds include long chain tertiary amine oxides, long chain tertiary phosphine 5  oxides and dialkyl sulphoxides.<br>
The nonionic may also be a sugar amide, such as a polysaccharide amide.  Specifically, the surfactant may be one of the lactobionamides described in U.S. Patent No. 10  5,389,279 to Au et al. which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference or it may be one of the sugar amides described in Patent No.. 5,009,814   to Kelkenberg,   hereby incorporated  into the subject application by reference.<br>
15  Other surfactants which may be used are described in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 3,723,325 to Parran Jr. and alkyl polysaccharide nonionic surfactants as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,565,647 to Llenado, both of which are also incorporated into the subject application by reference.<br>

Indeed, novel copolymers of the invention may introduce formulation flexibility.  That is, for example, the deposition system is not dependent on inclusion of anionic surfactant since high charge density, modified cationic will<br>
25  interact with benefit agent to form deposition system rather than requiring a cationic polymer/anionic surfactant deposition system.  This in turn allows, for example, that much milder surfactants be used rather than rely on generally harsher (harsher on skin) anionic surfactants.<br>

Benefit Agent<br>
The benefit agent may be in principle any negatively charged moiety which will react with the hydrophobically modified 5  cationic polymer.  This may include, for example, emulsions of silicones or oils.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the benefit agent is an optical modifier which may be chosen from non-colored and colored, 10  organic and inorganic materials.<br>
Among the materials which may be used are included:<br>
Organic pigments, inorganic pigments, polymers and fillers 15  such as titanium oxide, zinc oxide, colored iron oxide,<br>
chromium oxide/hydroxide/hydrate, alumina, silica, zirconia, barium sulfate, silicates, natural/alkaloid (including derivatives) polymers, polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, ultramarine, alkaline earth carbonates.  The materials can 20  be platy materials such as talc, sericite, mica, synthetic mica, platy substrate coated,  with organic and  inorganic molecules, bismuth oxychloride, barium sulfate.  Particle can be composed of several materials (like dyes, lakes, toners).  Lakes are, for example, dyes with aluminum 25  hydroxide to help bind to solid.  Color can be generated through fluorescence, absorption or iridescence.  That is, color of modifier materials is generated through optical means rather than, for example, chemical means.<br>
30  In another embodiment of the invention, the invention<br>
relates to a method of enhancing deposition of particles.<br><br>
-   18   -<br>
particularly optical modifier particles, using the novel hydrophobically modified polymers of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES 5<br>
The polymerization process of the invention can be noted as set forth below.<br>
Hydrophobically modified cationic polymers are synthesized<br>
10  by copolymerizing X moles of a cationic monomer with Y<br>
moles of hydrophobic monomer in an alcoholic solvent.  Here, the fractions X/(X + Y) and Y/(X + Y) then designate the mole fraction of cationic and hydrophobic monomers, respectively, in the feed stock.  The alcoholic solvent was<br>
15  a blend of ethanol and methanol, selected so as to be a good solvent for both the cationic and hydrophobic monomers, and contained 5-20% w/w of water by virtue of the fact that the cationic monomers employed were added as concentrated aqueous solutions. The monomers and solvent were charged<br>
20  into a round bottom flask  and the solution was de-aerated by purging with nitrogen for thirty minutes.  At this point, polymerization was initiated by addition of initiator and heating under reflux using a heating mantle and a water-cooled condenser.  The initiator was used at a level of 0.01<br>
25  - 0.5 grams per hundred grams of monomer and was dosed<br>
incrementally at equally spaced intervals depending upon the half-life of the initiator and the total time of the polymerization.  At the end of the polymerization, the volume of the reaction mixture was reduced to about 1/2 by<br>
30  evaporation of alcohol under a nitrogen stream and then<br>
diluted with water. Unreacted monomer, initiator and solvent<br><br>
-   19   -<br>
were removed by dialyzing the reaction mixture against distilled/ deionized water using a Spectra/Por 3© dialysis membrane with a 3500 molecular weight cut-off.  Water was than removed by freeze-drying to leave the copolymer as a 5  fine powder.  The actual copolymer composition of the<br>
product was determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy of a solution in D20.<br>
Measurement of Deposition Using Contact Angle Test<br>
10<br>
Modification of the contact angle of water on glass: Glass microscope slides are cleaned by soaking for fifteen minutes in hot 70% nitric acid and are then rinsed extensively in distilled-deionized water to give a substrate possessing a<br>
15  zero contact angle with respect to water.  The slides are then immersed for a period of sixty seconds in a 0.1% aqueous solution of the polymer to be tested.  Following immersion, the slides are  removed from the solution and rinsed in running distilled-deionized water for ten seconds<br>
20  on each side.  This rinsing protocol is repeated for a total of three cycles and then the slides are patted dry with an optical quality absorbent wiper.  The slides are then mounted on a Rame Hart contact angle goniometer and a droplet of water applied using a micro-syringe.  The contact<br>
25  angle which the droplet makes with the glass substrate is read via a microscope against a protractor scale.  The measurement was repeated on  five droplets, using a new droplet on a different portion of the substrate for each determination.  The average value is then reported.<br>

10  In addition to the vinyl polymers of Example 1-5 synthesized above, a series of hydrophobically modified hydroxyethyl cellulose polymers were also obtained as samples from Amerchol Corporation (A subsidiary of the Dow Company).  The material designated as SoftCAT Polymer SK-M® was described<br>
15  as a high viscosity, quaternized hydroxyethyl cellulose<br>
polymer which has been substituted with trimethyl ammonium groups.  The nitrogen weight percentage of this material has been determined as 1.1% and, assuming an average of 2.5 moles of ethylene oxide per anhydroglucose ring, the degree<br>
20  of cationic substitution can be estimated at 0.22 with a cationic charge density of 0.8 milli-equivalents per gram. A hydrophobically modified hydroxyethyl cellulose was provided as SK-MH®, with a nitrogen weight percentage of 1.0% and consequently the same degree of substitution and a<br>
25  charge density of 0.7 milli-equivalents per gram.  According to the manufacturers, SoftCAT SK-MH© also contained a low level of hydrophobic dimethyldodecyl ammonium substitution. Applicants have employed 1H NMR to estimate that the level of hydrophobic loading on this polymer to corresponds to two<br>
30  (2) hydrophobic units per 100 anhydroglucose rings.  Both<br><br>
-   24   -<br>
materials are water soluble, but they also are both highly effective at increasing the viscosity of water.<br>

Example of Deposition - Contact Angle Test<br>
The ability of the copolymers constituting the present invention to improve the deposition of skin benefiting 15  agents was demonstrated using the contact angle test described in the protocol above.<br>

The results of Table I indicate that successively more 10  hydrophobically modified polymers, examples 1=&gt; 2=&gt;3, have a progressively greater tendency to increase the contact angle of water on  the surface of glass.  Such an  increase is consistent with the polymer hydrophobing the glass surface. The slight hydrophobic character of SK-MH nonetheless shows 15  the same tendency to increase the contact angle with respect to SK-M.<br><br>

The deposition of titanium coated mica (TCM) particles from these bars onto pig skin was gauged via a protocol which can be summarized as follows.  The pig skin was obtained from<br><br>
-   27   -<br>
black female skin, 3-5 months old,, partly shaved and dermatomed to 1.5 mm.  Each piece of skin measured 1" x 3" and was adhered to a glossy card.  A lather of approximately 100 mL volume was generated by wetting and rubbing the bar 5  under running tap water.  The lather was transferred to the piece of pig skin and worked into the skin for 60 seconds before rinsing for 30 seconds under running tap water.  The skin was allowed to dry for 1 hour before the change in reflectivity of the skin was read with a Glossmeter (Novo-10  Gloss Statistical Gloss Meter).<br>
