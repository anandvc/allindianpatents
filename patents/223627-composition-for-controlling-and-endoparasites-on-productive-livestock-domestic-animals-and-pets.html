				<td>Cpmbination of N-Phenyl-n'-benzoyl urea derivative and Nectin compounds for parasite control<br>
The present invention relates to preparations for veterinary medicine, which contain a combination of 1-[4-chloro-3-(3-chioro-5-trlfluoromethyl-2-pyridyloxy)phenyl]-3-(2,6-difluoro-benzoyl)urea [hereinafter compound (B)] and a further active ingredient of formula (i) below from the avermectin class. It also relates to the use of these two components in the production of veterinary preparations and their joint usage in a method of controlling ecto-and endo-parasltes on productive livestock, domestic animals and pets.<br>
1-[4-chloro-3-(3-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridyloxy)phenyt]-3-(2,6-difluorobenzoyl) including the preparation thereof, is known from European Published Specification EP-0.079,311. This compound has in the following the name "compound B".<br><br><br>
Ra is -CH(CH3)-CH3. -CH(CH3)-C2H5, -C(CH3)=CH-CH(CH3)2 or cyclohexyl; R3 is hydrogen or hydroxy if the bond between atoms 22 and 23 represents a double bond, or is hydrogen or the group =N-0-CH3 if a single bond is present between atoms 22 and 23; and R4 is H0-, in free form or in the form of a physiologically acceptable salt.<br>
Typical representatives of compounds of formula (i) are:<br><br>
and R3 is hydrogen steht, whereby atoms 22 and 23 are linked by a single bond and R2 is either -CH{CH3)-CH3 or -CH(CH3)-C2H5; both of them, including their preparation, are known from EP-0,001,689. Ivermectin is preferred in the context of the present invention.<br><br>
and R3 is hydrogen, whereby atoms 22 and 23 are linked by a double bond and R2 is cyclohexyl. Doramectin is described e.g. in EP-0,214,731 and EP-0,276,131.<br>
3)	Moxidectin, also known as LL-F28249a is a compound of formula (i), wherein Ri and Rs<br>
are hydrogen, whereby atoms 22 and 23 are linked by a single bond and R2 signifies<br>
-C(CH3)=CH-CH(CH3)2. Moxidectin is known from US-4,916,154.<br>
4)	Selamectin is 25-cyclohexyl-25-de{1-methylpropyl)-5-deoxy-22,23-dihydro-5-<br>
(hydroxyimino)avermectln B1 monosaccharide and thus a compound of fonnula {i),<br>
wherein R\ is the radical<br><br><br>
Ra Signifies cyciohexyl, R3 is hydrogen, whereby atoms 22 and 23 are linked by a single bond and R4 is HO-N=. Selameclin is known e.g. from: ECTOPARASITE ACTIVITY OF SELAMECTIN; A novel endectocide for dogs and cats. A Pfizer Symposium, held in conjunction with The 17th international Conference of the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology, 19 August 1999 . Copenhagen, Denmark.<br>
The compounds of formula (I} are known from the said publications or are obtainable analogously to known agents.<br>
As is known, the life cycles of the different parasites, which can infest humans or animals, are very complex, which makes it difficult to control them In many cases. In addition, multiple diseases are often a problem that has not yet been satisfactorily resolved- in particular in warmer regions, herd animals such as cattle and sheep, are often Infected by an epidemic of helminths and other worm diseases. These diseases in themselves are frequently life-threatening. In many ways, these animals which are already weakened by the endoparasites are additionally infested by ectoparasites, in particular ticks, which often appear en mass and further weaken these animals and form an additional stress factor. The animals which are already weakened by the worms take up even less nourishment because of these plagues, lose weight even more rapidly and require intensive treatment and attention. Moreover, ticks may be infected with various kinds of pathogens, and transmit them particularly easily to host animals that are already weakened and whose Immune system is also weakened. There is therefore a vital need to provide preparations which successfully eliminate both the parasitic worms and ticks.<br>
Typical helminthic diseases in the context of the present invention are those caused by members of the nematode class. These include for example the families Filariidae and Setariidae, and the genera Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, Ostertagia, Nematodirus, Cooperia, Ascaris, Bunostumum, Oesophagostonum, Chabertia, Trichuris, especially Tiichuiis vulpis, Strongylus, Thchonema, Dictyocaulus, Capillaria, Strongyloides, Heterakis, Toxocara, especially Toxocara cants, Ascaridia, Oxyuris. Ancylostoma, especially<br><br>
Ancylostoma caninum, Uncinaris, Toxascaris and Parascaris; Dirofilaria, especially Dirofilaria immitis (hearlworm).<br>
Ticks can feed exclusively from the blood of one host or also from the blood of different hosts. The attach themselves firmly to the host animal and suck its blood. The fully engorged females drop from the host animal and then lay a large number of eggs in a suitable niche in their surroundings. The developing larvae then search for a new host animal in order to develop into adults via the nymph stage, and in turn fully engorge themselves with blood. Certain species feed on two and some on three host animals during their lifecycle.<br>
Ticks of importance in this instance are above all those which belong to the genera Amblyomma, Boophilus, Hyalomma, Ixodes, Rhipicephalus and Dermacentor, especially the species Boophilus microplus and B. annulatus, and most especially B. microplus. They are responsible for the transmission of numerous diseases which can affect humans and animals. The diseases which are mostly transmitted are bacterial, protozoan, rickettsial and viral. The pathogens of such diseases are transmitted especially by ticks which feed on more than one host. These diseases can lead to the debilitation or even death of the host animals. In most cases they cause considerable economic damage, for example by diminishing the value of meat from livestock, damaging the usable skin, or reducing milk production.<br>
Ticks of the above species are traditionally controlled on otherwise healthy host animals by treating the infested animals with an acaticidally active composition depending on the type of infestation involved, i.e. by curative means. The occurrence of ticks, for example on pasture land, is heavily dependent, however, on seasonal weather conditions, and the ultimate infestation of the host animals itself depends also on their resistance to the ticks. This means that preventative control of the ticks is difficult and time-consuming, since inter alia the severity of Infestation by the pests can only be estimated with difficulty. In the case of animals that have already been weakened by other parasites, e.g. the above-mentioned worms, effective control of the ticks is particularly Important. Here, preparations are preferred, which show mai1<ed contact action i.e. either kill the ticks upon with pelt or skin induce them not to attach themselves and suck blood. weakened animals it is especially important that they are additionally stressed by anti-tick treatment treated a number of veterinary preparations side></ed><br>
effects of which might accumulate. Mass-produced, suitably-adapted, well-tolerated broad¬band preparations might provide a remedy.<br>
It is becoming increasingly difficult to synthesise or to isolate from natural sources new classes of active ingredient, which are equal to the active substances already available or even superior to them. Many of the known active ingredients in the field of animal health show exceptionally marked activity against certain target parasites. Unfortunately, their activity is usually restricted either to external or internal parasites only, or they have substantial gaps in their spectrum of activity in one respect or another. For treatment of already weakened animals, however, it would be desirable to provide broad-band preparations, which cover a broad spectrum of activity, are very well tolerated and can reduce the number of treatments to a minimum.<br>
Instead of searching for new active ingredients, possibly for years without success, It may be preferable to attempt to achieve the desired broad-band effect by combining known active substances. At first appearance, this seems to be a simple task, since the spectra of activity of different classes of substances have been known for a long time. In reality however, the mere combination of two active substances seldom leads to the desired success, since the simultaneous administration of different active substances can lead to unpredictable kinetic and metabolic effects, not to mention potentiation of the undesired side effects. Also, contrary potentiating or diminishing effects are observed, and even undesired chemical reactions between the degradation products arising through the endogenous enzymes. Not all of the proposed combinations exhibit the desired broad-band spectnjm upon practical application. In many cases, new deficiencies in efficacy occur, which render the preparation useless for the planned application or restrict it to specific cases, since one or other of the frequently appearing parasites is not covered or is unsufficiently covered, or the immune system of the treated animals is adversely affected, and they become susceptible to e.g. fungal diseases or other secondary infections, which makes their treatment more difficult and involves the usage of further veterinary preparations. A further difficulty is that helminthic infestations may be controlled particularly effectively if the corresponding preparations are administered systemically. I.e. either percutaneously or orally, and reach the parasites via the blood stream. On the other hand, tick preparations are preferably administered topically, i.e. to the skin or the pelt of the host animal, and exhibit their anti-tick activity there by contact. It is a difficult undertaking to find<br><br>
active ingredients that are to act in both treatments and which may be applied either systemically or topicaily or in both ways.<br>
If e.g. helminthic diseases and tick infestation are to be treated simultaneously, proposals for combination preparations have already been made in literature:<br>
In WO 96/25852 for example, there is an overall proposal to use the combination of a benzoylurea with a further active ingredient from the series milbemycin, avemiectin, milbemycinoxim, moxidectin, ivermectin, abamectin and doramectin. However, only the combinations lufenuron &amp; milbemycin and fluazuron &amp; milbemycin are mentioned specifically. There is no indication of using a specific combination of a benzoylurea with a macrocyclic compound, as used in the present invention. Furthermore, in European published specification EP-0,242,502, the combination of avemnectinen with a further active ingredient from the class of phorphoric acid esters, carbamates, carboxylic acid esters, certain benzoylureas or other known insecticides or acaricides, is proposed for the simultaneous control of insects, acarids and nematodes, albeit in the field of plant protection. This specification specifically proposes e.g. chlorfluazuron (compound lib, page 3) as the benzoylurea component. This has a certain structural closeness to the fluazuron used according to the invention<br>
If now an attempt is made to transfer these experiences from plant protection to usage in the field of veterinary medicine, which is the subject of the present invention, it is quickly established that the spectrum of activity of the proposed combinations has considerable deficiencies as regards the ectoparasites. Although the avermectin portion does lead to very good efficacy against various nematodes, the addition of the proposed benzoylureas does not gove the desired activity in the field of ectoparasites, especially against the most important members of the acarid order (mites and in particular ticks).<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that a relatively slight structural modification to the chlorfluazuron proposed in EP-0,242,502 not only balances out this deficit in activity, but also leads to extremely well tolerated preparations which act rapidly and persistently against various helminthic diseases and against ticks and mites, and in this way are eminently suitable for usage in the field of animal health. In addition, administration to cattle and sheep shows that these new combination preparations do not have an adverse effect on the normal behaviour of the animals among one another, nor in their eating habits. The new combinations may therefore be used not only curatively, but also preventatively and also<br><br>
over longer periods of time when there is an increased risk of infestation, without the appearance of negative side effects which would harm the animals.<br>
The benzoylureas proposed in EP-0,242,502 are notable structurally for the para-phenoxy-orpara-pyridyloxyphenyl group. One notable benzoylurea is e.g. the following substance<br><br>
By combining this substance (A) with typical representatives of avermectin derivatives, it is established in the case of the combination with ivermectin, doramectin and moxidectin that they are not suitable for usage in animal health, since although they eliminate the parasitic worms rapidly and persistently, they clearly have no influence on ticks.<br>
By comparing the biological activity of these combinations depicted in the prior art with that of the proposed combinations, which contain as the first component of the mixture likewise ivermectin, doramectin or moxidectin and as the second component the following<br><br>
it is established that by using this structural isomer (B), in which also one chlorine atom is missing, a significantly broader spectrum of activity is attained, which is important for veterinary medicine. As well as the frequently appearing womis, it also covers mites and in  
 <br>
The following examples serve to clarify the invention further, without limiting it in any way.<br>
Biological example<br>
For the sake of simplicity, the chicken mite Dermanyssus gallinae is used. This is a good model for determining the effect on ticks.<br>
In vitro effect on Dermanyssus gallinae<br>
The test is carried out with serial dilutions [avermectin component in concentrations of (32), 10, 3.2, 1.0, 0.32 to 0.0001 ppm; the 1-[4-chloro-3-(3-chior-5-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridyioxy)phenyt]-3-(2,6- difluorobenzoyi)urea in concentrations of 100, 32, 10, 3.2, 1.0, 0.32 and 0.1 ppm]. For the test, the lowest concentration of one active substance is combined with the lowest concentration of the other active substance, and the limits of activity thus worked out. Ten fully engorged female mites of the genus Dermanyssus gallinae adhered to a plastic adhesive film are brought into contact with 50ul of an aqueous suspension or emulsion of the test combination in question. After drying, the film is stuck onto a glass disc. This creates a kind of air bubble around each mite, the lower surface of which is formed by the glass disc and the upper surface by a bulging of the adhesive film. This bubble contains sufficient air for the mite to avoid suffocating. After 5 days, the effect of the test substance is evaluated with the aid of a stereomicroscope by assessing the effect on mortality, oviposition, egg quality, hatching rate, pupation rate, and development of protonymphs according to the following 4 criteria:<br>
1)	If 9 to 10 mites are dead, this indicates a lethal effect (characterised by M);<br>
2)	if 2 or more mites survive, but do not produce any eggs, this indicates sterility (S);<br>
3)	if 2 or more mites survive and produce eggs, but no larvae hatch from these eggs and no protonymphs develop, this indicates a development-inhibiting effect (H);<br>
4)if 2 or more mites survive and lay the usual number of normal eggs, from which lan/ae hatch and develop Into protonymphs, this indicates no activity (-).<br>
In each test, two basic suspensions/emulsions (without active ingredient) and one suspension/emulsion with only one of each component are also tested in the corresponding concentrations.<br>
The test is repeated three times with the following combinations and the results detennined. The final result is given in Tables 1 to 3, whereby in the tables marked with a the<br><br><br><br>
All the basic suspensions/emulsions (without active ingredient) show no biological activity, and also no secondary reactions. The active ingredient (A) of the prior art shows no activity at any concentration; the avermectin components ivermectin, moxidectin and doramectin achieve full activity at 0.32 and 10 ppm in tenns of preventing oviposition. 1-H-chloro-3-{3-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridyloxy)ph8nyl]-3-(2,6-difluorobenzoyl)urea prevents oviposition up to a concentration of 0,01 ppm.<br>
The comparison clearly shows that the combinations according to the invention (compare    tables 1 b, 2b and 3b with 1 a, 2a and 3a) are active against Dermanyssus gallinae at substantially lower threshold concentrations than the corresponding comparison combination from the prior art. Individual tests with the tick Boophilus microplus show a completely analogous manifestation and the first in vivo tests on sheep confimi the targeted activity. In vitro tests against nematodes (Haemonchus contortus) show/ that the mixing of substance (B) with the avermectin component has no effect on its antihelminthic activity.<br>
It has also been found that certain forms of application, for example external application, but especially systemic administration of the combination according to the invention and where appropriate with the addition of one or more compounds from other substance classes, e.g. methoprene, hydroprene, dicyclanil and cythioate, or their salts, to potentiate the effect, can eliminate the said ectoparasites very rapidly and completely, thus intervening to block the complex development cycle, and at the same time achieving an efficient control of the endoparasites, especially nematodes. The combinations and preparations according to the invention exert their excellent parasiticidal effect in full when given to the host animal systemically, i.e. orally, parenterlly, subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously. It is thus now possible, through selective periodic administration of these compounds, to prevent the constant reinfestatlon of the host animals with the various parasites in a simple manner and to keep the parasites at bay from the herds for a long time. The parasites are either killed by contact or are prevented from reproducing, or the juvenile stages are prevented from growing and die prematurely.<br>
A further preferred object of the invention is thus also a method of simultaneously controlling nematodes, mites and ticks in and on domestic animals, productive livestock and pets, in which the active ingredient combination according to the invention or a preparation of veterinary medicine which contains the combination is administered to the host animal orally, parenterally or by implant in an amount that is effective against the parasites.<br><br>
Essential to the invention is the fact that the combination or the preparation of the invention is administered in such a way th3t the active ingredients which the composition comprises can be taken up in sufficient quantity with the blood of the host animai by endoparasites, ectoparasites and other parasites which can be regarded as vectors for the transmission of endoparasites, so that the eggs laid by the adult parasites and/or the larvae hatching therefrom are not able to deveiop.<br>
This is achieved with the combination or preparation o1 the invention using different forms of appiication, e.g. through the oral administration of the preparations containing the active ingredients. In this case, formuiated means e.g. in the form of a powder, a tablet, a granulate, a capsule, an emulsion, a foam, in micro-encapsulated form, etc., whereby as aiready mentioned, the preparation does not necessarily have to be given to the animal directly, but may also be mixed with its food. Of course, all compositions to be administered orally may contain further additives, in addition to conventional formulation excipients. These additives encourage willing consumption by the host animal, for example suitable odorous substances and flavourings. Because of its simple practicability, oral usage is one of the preferred subjects of the irivention. A further type of application is parenteral usage, e.g. by subcutaneous or intravenous injection, topical application or as a long-term preparation (depot form) in the form of an implant or injection of microcapsules (so-called "microspheres").<br>
Oral application also includes e.g. administration of animal food, for example dog or cat food, which contains the active substances already mixed therein, e.g. as biscuits, as chews, as water-soluble capsules or tablets, in water-soluble form that can be dripped onto the food, or in other forms that can be mixed with the animal food. The implants also include all the devices which can be inserted into the body of the animal in order to deliver the substance.<br>
Percutaneous application forms include for example the subcutaneous, dermal, intramuscular and even intravenous administration of injectable forms. Apart from the usual injection syringes with needles, needleless systems and pour-on and spot-on formulations may also be expedient.<br>
By choosing a suitable fomnulation, it is possible to enhance the penetration power of the active ingredients through the living tissue of the animal, and to maintain its availability. This is of importance e.g. if one or more poorly soluble active ingredients are used, the low<br><br>
solubility of which require a solubility-enhancing measure, since the body fluids of the animal are only able to dissolve small amounts of the substance at a time.<br>
Furthermore, the active ingredient combinations may also be present in a matrix formulation, which physically prevents their decomposition and maintains the availability of the active ingredients. This matrix formulation is injected into the body and remains there as a type of depot, from which the active ingredient combination is continuously released. Such matrix formulations are known to the person skilled in the art. These are generally waxy, semi-solid excipients, for example plant waxes and polyethylene glycols with a high molecular weight or copolymers of degradable polyesters.<br>
Good availability of the active ingredient combination is also achieved by Inserting an implant of the active substances into the animal. Such implants are widely used in veterinary medicine and often consist of silicone-containing rubber. Here, the active substances are dispersed in the solid rubber or are found in the inside of a hollow njbber element. Care must be taken that active substances are selected, which are soluble in the njbber implant, since they are first dissolved in the rubber and then continuously seep from the rubber material to the body fluids of the animal to be treated.<br>
The rate of release of the active substances from the implant, and thus the time span during which the implant shows activity, is generally determined by the accuracy of measurement (amount of active ingredient in the implant) of the implant, the environment of the Implant and the polymer formulation from which the implant is made.<br>
The administration of the active ingredients by means of an implant represents a further preferred constituent of the present invention. This type of administration is extremely economical and effective, because a correctly dimensioned Implant guarantees a constant concentration of the active substance in the tissue of the host animal. Nowadays, implants can be designed and implanted in a simple manner, so that they are in a position to deliver the active ingredients over some months.<br>
The administration of veterinary medicine additives to animal food is best known in the field of animal health. Usually, first of all, a so-called premix is produced, in which the active substances are dispersed In a liquid or finely distributed in solid carriers. This premix can nomially contain about 1 to 800 g of the active ingredient combination per kg, depending on the desired end concentration in the food.<br><br>
It is known moreover that active ingredients can be hydrolysed or their effects attenuated by the constituents of the feed under unfavourable circumstances. This may be prevented by incorporating them in a protective matrix, for example gelatin.<br>
The combinations according to the invention are suitably applied in a dosage of 0-01 to 800, preferably 0.1 to 200, especially 0.5 to 50 mg/kg body weight based on the host animal, the amounts referring to the sum of both active substances.<br>
A good dose of the combination of the invention which can be administered regularly to the host animal is especially 2.5-5 mg/kg body weight in the cat and 0.5-15 mg/kg per kg body weight in the dog. In the sheep, it is 0.5 - 30 mg/kg body weight and in the cow it is 1 - 30 mg/kg body weight. It is expedient to carry out the administration at regular intervals, e.g. every few days, weekly, or monthly.<br>
The total dose can vary both between and within animal species, since the dose depends among other things on the weight and the constitution of the animal.<br>
For the formulation of compositions that are to be administered to humans, domestic animals, livestock, and pets, the adjuvants known from veterinary practice for oral, parenteral and implant forms can be used. The following is a non-exhaustive list of some examples.<br>
The active ingredient combinations according to the invention contain 1-[4-chloro'3-(3-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridyloxy)phenyl]-3-(2,6- difluorobenzoyl)urea [compound B] and a compound of fonnula (i} [Verbindung (i)] in almost any proportion, but preferably in a mixture ratio of B : 1 of 100,000 : 1 to 1 : 100, especially in a ratio of 10 ; 1 to 1: 100, advantageous active ingredient concentrations being ca. 100 -1 ppm of B to 0.1 -10 ppm of (i).<br>
Compositions or preparations to be used according to the invention normally contain 0.1 to 99 % by weight, especially 0.1 to 95 % by weight of a combination of the compound 1-[4-chloro-3-{3-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridyloxy)phenyl]-3-(2,6- difluorobenzoyl)urea and a compound of formula (i) and 99.9 to 1 % by weight, especially 99.9 to 5 % by weight of a solid or liquid, physiologically acceptable carrier, including 0 to 25 Gew.-%, especially 0.1 to 25 % by weight of a non-toxic surfactant.<br>
Suitable carriers are in particular fillers, such as sugars, e.g. lactose, saccharose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations and/or calcium phosphates, e.g. tricalcium phosphate or<br><br>
calcium hydrogen phosphate, in a broader sense also binders, such as starch pastes using e.g. com, wheat, rice or potato starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methyl cellulose and/or, if desired, disintegrants, such as the above-mentioned starches, in a broader sense also carboxymethyl starch, cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, agar, alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate. Excipients are especially flow conditioners and lubricants, for example silicic acid, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol. Tablet cores may be provided with suitable, where appropriate enteric, coatings, using inter alia concentrated sugar solutions which may comprise gum arable, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and/or titanium dioxide, or coating solutions in suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures, or, for the preparation of enteric coatings, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations, such as acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate. Dyes, flavours or pigments may be added to the tablets or tablet coatings, for example for identification purposes or to indicate different doses.<br>
Further orally adminlstrable pharmaceutical compositions include hard capsules consisting of gelatin, and also soft, sealed capsules consisting of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The hard capsules may contain the active ingredients in the form of granules, for example in admixture with fillers, such as lactose, binders, such as starches, and/or glidants, such as talc or magnesium stearate, and where appropriate stabilisers. In soft capsules, the active ingredients are preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, paraffin oil, or liquid polyethylene glycols, and stabilisers may likewise be added. Amongst other forms, capsules which can be both easily chewed and also swallowed whole are preferred.<br>
The fomiulations suitable for parenteral administration are especially aqueous solutions of the active ingredient combinations in walsr-soluble form, e.g. watev-soiubie salts, in the broader sense also suspensions of the active ingredients, such as appropriate oily injectable suspensions using suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles, such as oils, e.g. sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, e.g. ethyl oleate, or triglycerides, or aqueous injectable suspensions containing viscosity-increasing agents, e.g. sodium carisoxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran, and where appropriate stabilisers.<br>
The preparations of the invention may be prepared in a manner known perse, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, coating, dissolving or lyophilising processes. Veterinary preparations for oral administration can be obtained, for example, by combining<br><br>
the active ingredient combination with solid carriers, granulating a resulting mixture where appropriate, and processing the mixture or granules, if desired or necessary, to form tablets or tablet cores following the addition of suitable excipients.<br>
In the following formulation examples for usage on domestic animals, productive livestock and pets, the term "active ingredient combination" represents a 1:1 combination of l-[4-chloro-3-(3-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridyloxy)phenyl]-3-(2,6-difluorobenzoyl)ureaand ivennectin.<br>
Tablets: containing one of the active ingredients of formula I may be produced as follows:<br>
Constituents (for 1000 tablets)<br>
