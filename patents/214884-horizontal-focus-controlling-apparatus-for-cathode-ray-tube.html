				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a horizontal focus controlling apparatus for compensating a distortion generated on a cathode-ray tube (CRT) screen such as a computer or a TV set, and more particularly, to a horizontal focus controlling apparatus for making a horizontal parabola signal coincide with a phase of a flyback pulse (FBP) signal.<br>
The horizontal focus controlling means compensates for the distortion of the CRT screen by generating a parabola signal corresponding to a curved surface on the CRT screen and outputting it with a horizontal scan signal.  A horizontal parabola signal synchronized with a flyback pulse is required for controlling such a horizontal focus.  Since a horizontal portion of the CRT has a higher operating frequency than a vertical portion of the CRT, an output gain and a phase of the parabola signal should hardly change.  Also, since the CRT operates in a multi-synchronizing method, the above-mentioned conditions should be met with respect to all the horizontal synchronizing signal frequencies.  However, there is a problem that the output gain and the phase of the parabola signal change according to the input synchronizing signal frequency in a conventional technology.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a horizontal focus controlling apparatus for making a parabola<br>
output signal coincide with the phase of a FBP signal by generating a predetermined select signal in ord'er to control a horizontal focus in a CRT.<br>
To achieve the above object, there is provided a horizontal focus controlling apparatus for a cathode-ray tube, comprising:<br>
select signal generating means for dividing the period of a sawtooth signal into a falling portion, a rising portion located before the central point of the positive pulse of a flyback pulse signal, and a rising portion after the central point of the positive pulse of the flyback pulse signal and generating first, second, and third select signals synchronized with the respective portions; and<br>
parabola signal generating means for generating a parabola signal which is synchronized with the flyback pulse signal by controlling the sawtooth signal according to the selections of the first, second, or third select signals.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a horizontal focus controlling apparatus for a cathode-ray tube for generating a parabola signal applied to control the horizontal focus, said apparatus comprising:<br>
select signal generator for dividing the period of a sawtooth signal into a falling portion, a rising portion located before a central point of a positive pulse of the flyback pulse signal, and a rising portion after the central point of the positive pulse of the flyback pulse signal and generating first, second, and third select signals synchronized with the respective portions; and<br>
parabola signal generator for generating a parabola signal which is synchronized with the flyback pulse signal by controlling the sawtooth signal responsive to the selections of the first, second, or third select signals.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, a preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to the attached drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a block diagram of a horizontal focus controlling apparatus for a cathode-ray tube according to the present invention.  The horizontal focus controlling apparatus includes a select signal generating portion 1 which inputs a sawtooth signal SAWTOOTH INPUT and a pulse signal OSC INPUT which is synchronized with a falling portion of the sawtooth signal SAWTOOTH INPUT for dividing the period of the sawtooth signal SAWTOOTH INPUT into a falling portion, a rising portion located before the central point of the positive pulse of a flyback pulse signal, and a rising portion after the central point and generating first, second, and third select signals SELECT1, SELECT2 and SELECT3 synchronized with the respective portions and a parabola signal generating portion 2 for generating a parabola signal PARABOLA OUTPUT which is synchronized with the flyback pulse signal by controlling the<br>
sawtooth signal SAWTOOTH INPUT according to the selections of the first, second, or third select signals SELECT1, SELECT2 or SELECTS.  The detailed description of the operation of the horizontal focus controlling apparatus will be followed with reference to FIG. 2, FIGS. 3A-3E, FIG. 4 and FIGS. 5A-5E.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a circuit diagram of the select signal generating portion 1 shown in FIG. 1.  In FIGS. 3A to 3E show a relationship between an input signal and an output signal of the signal generating portion 1 shown in FIG. 2.  FIGS. 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D and 3E show waveforms of the sawtooth signal SAWTOOTH INPUT and a flyback pulse signal, the first select signal SELECT1, a comparator output signal, the second select signal SELECT2, and the third select signal SELECTS, respectively.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2 a comparator 11 outputs a signal which results when the sawtooth signal SAWTOOTH INPUT is compared with a threshold voltage Ref corresponding to a position of 0.375T thereof.  A first NOR gate 12 performs a logic NOR operation with respect to the output signal of the comparator 11 and the pulse signal (OSC INPUT) synchronized with a falling portion of the sawtooth signal SAWTOOTH INPUT and outputs the result.  A second NOR gate 13 performs a logic NOR operation with respect to the output signal of the first NOR gate 12 and the pulse signal (OSC INPUT) synchronized with the falling portion of the sawtooth signal SAWTOOTH INPUT and outputs the result.  By doing so, the pulse signal (OSC INPUT) synchronized with the falling portion of the sawtooth signal SAWTOOTH INPUT, the output signal of the first NOR gate 12,<br>
and the output signal of the second NOR gate 13 respectively serve as the first select signal SELECT1, the second select signal SELECT2 and the third select signal SELECT3.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a circuit diagram of the parabola signal generating portion 2 shown in FIG. 1 and FIGS. 5A-5E show a relationship between an input signal and an output signal of the signal generating portion 2 shown in FIG. 4.  FIGS. 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D and 5E show waveforms of the sawtooth signal SAWTOOTH INPUT, a fourth amplifier output signal, an inverted signal of the fourth amplifier output signal, the parabola output signal PARABOLA OUTPUT, and the flyback pulse signal.<br>
A reference voltage generator (not shown) generates a reference voltage Ref for controlling a direct current offset. A first amplifier 31 amplifies the sawtooth signal SAWTOOTH INPUT by unity gain and a first switch 34 outputs the output of the first amplifier 31 to a fourth amplifier 37 during a section selected by the first select signal SELECT1.  A second amplifier 32 controls the direct current offset of the sawtooth signal SAWTOOTH INPUT according to the input reference voltage Ref and the sawtooth signal SAWTOOTH INPUT, and then inverts and amplifies it by a predetermined unit of gain and a second switch 35 outputs the output of the second amplifier 32 to the fourth amplifier 37 during a section selected by the second select signal SELECT2.  A third amplifier 33 controls the direct current offset of the sawtooth signal SAWTOOTH INPUT according to the input reference voltage Ref and the sawtooth signal SAWTOOTH INPUT, and then inverts and amplifies it by a predetermined unit of<br>
gain and a third switch 36 outputs the output of the third amplifier 33 to the fourth amplifier 37 during a section selected by the third select signal SELECT 3.  The fourth amplifier 37 inverts and amplifies the output signal of the first, second or third switch 34, 35 or 36 which is output according to the first, second or third select signal SELECT1, SELECT2 or SELECTS by a gain based on the ratio of the rising section to the falling section of the sawtooth signal SAWTOOTH INPUT during the section in which the first select signal SELECT1 is activated and by a predetermined unit of gain during the other sections, and outputs the result.  An inverter 38 inverts and outputs the output signal of the fourth amplifier 37.  A multiplier 39 multiplies the output signal of the fourth amplifier 37 by that of the inverter 38 and generates the desired parabola signal PARABOLA OUTPUT. Here, reference characters R1-R8 indicate resistors and reference character Cl indicates a capacitor.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 5A and 5B, it is noted that a sawtooth signal having uniform rising and falling portions can be used to generate a sawtooth signal having no falling section by the switching of a select signal.  Referring FIGS. 5D and 5E, it is noted that the non-distorted parabola signal whose phase coincides with that of the flyback pulse signal can be generated by doing so.<br>
According to the horizontal focus controlling apparatus for a cathode-ray tube according to the present invention, it is possible to generate the non-distorted parabola signal whose phase coincides with that of the flyback pulse signal<br>
and to utilize it to control the horizontal focus of the CRT screen by generating the parabola signal after generating the sawtooth signal having no falling section by dividing the section of a predetermined sawtooth signal and generating a select signal corresponding thereto.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
