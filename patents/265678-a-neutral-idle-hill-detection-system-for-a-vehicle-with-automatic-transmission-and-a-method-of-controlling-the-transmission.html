NEUTRAL IDLE HILL DETECTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to transmission control systems and methods, and more particularly to transmission control systems and methods that control an operational state of a clutch.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] During vehicle travel there are many instances where the vehicle must stop and idle while still remaining in gear. For example, vehicles stop and idle at traffic signals, cross-walks, stop signs, and the like. During idle conditions when the transmission is in gear, transmission neutral idle control can be used to improve fuel economy by reducing the load on the engine. When the vehicle isat rest, the brakes are applied, the transmission is in a drive manual range, and the engine is idling, a transmission drive input clutch can be released to produce a geared neutral state. By going to this geared neutral state, the amount of fuel required to keep the engine idle stable will be reduced when compared to normal in-gear idle conditions. This is intended to improve fuel economy during conditions that would be encountered during urban driving when the vehicle frequently stops for traffic lights, or during congested stop-and-go driving.<br><br>
2<br><br>
[0003] Vehicles implementing the neutral idle control may experience vehicle roll-back events during periods of idle while positioned on a hill. More specifically, if a vehicle is idling on a surface that has a sufficient grade, the vehicle may be induced to roll backward once the transmission input clutch is released. This occurs when the brake pressure is not sufficient to maintain the position of the vehicle.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] Accordingly, a neutral idle hill detection system for a vehicle with an automatic transmission comprises a range selection input device that receives an operating range of a transmission. A throttle position input device receives a throttle position signal. A transmission output speed input device receives a transmission output speed signal. A transmission temperature input device receives a temperature signal. A brake status input device receives a brake signal. A control module receives the range, the throttle position signal, the transmission output speed signal, the temperature signal, and the brake signal, detects a hill condition based on the received signals, and controls a first clutch of the transmission based on the hill condition.<br>
[0005] In one other feature, the neutral idle hill detection system comprises a brake module that determines brake pressure, and<br><br>
3<br>
wherein the control module receives the brake pressure and detects the hill condition based on the brake pressure.<br>
[0006] In another feature, the control module increments a hill counter if the hill condition is detected and determines a neutral idle condition based on the hill counter. The first clutch is controlled based on the neutral idle condition.<br>
[0007] In other features, the neutral idle hill detection system comprises a turbine speed input device that receives a turbine speed signal. The control module receives the turbine speed signal and further determines the neutral idle condition based on the transmission range, the transmission output speed signal, the throttle position signal, the turbine speed signal, the brake signal, and the transmission temperature signal. Alternatively, the neutral idle condition is further determined based on the transmission range, the transmission output speed signal, the turbine speed signal, the throttle position signal, the brake signal, the transmission temperature signal, and a brake pressure or the hill condition.<br>
[0008] In still other features, the control module detects the hill condition if: range indicates the transmission is operating in a forward range, the transmission output speed signal is greater than a selectable value, the throttle position signal is less than a selectable value, the brake signal indicates the brakes are applied, and the temperature signal falls within a selectable range<br><br>
4<br>
[0009] In still other features, the control module increments a hill counter and sets a hill condition flag to true if control detects the hill condition. The control module detects the hill condition if the counter is less than a selectable maximum. Alternatively, the control module detects the hill condition if the hill counter is greater than a selectable maximum and the brake pressure is greater than a hill brake pressure plus a selectable offset.<br>
[0010] Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0020] The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a<br><br>
6<br>
processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that executes one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0021] Referring now to Figure 1, a vehicle is shown generally at 10. The vehicle includes an engine 12 that drives a transmission 14 through a torque converter 16. Air is drawn into the engine 12 through a throttle 18. The air is mixed with fuel and combusted within cylinders (not shown) of the engine 12 to produce drive torque. The torque converter 16 supplies the engine torque to the transmission via an input shaft 20. The transmission 14 in the preferred embodiment is a multi-speed automatic clutch-to-clutch transmission that drives an output shaft 22 based on engine torque. As can be appreciated, the transmission can also be any type of automatic transmission including, but not limited to freewheel transmissions and continuously variable transmissions (CVTs). For exemplary purposes, the present invention will be discussed in the context of the clutch-to-clutch transmission.<br>
[0022] The output shaft 22 drives a driveline 24 of the vehicle 10. A range selection device 26 enables an operator to set the transmission at a desired operating range including, but not limited to, park, reverse, neutral, and one or more forward drive positions. The speed   and   torque   relationships   between   the   engine   12   and   the<br><br>
7<br>
driveline 24 are controlled by hydraulically operated clutches C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 of the transmission 14. Pressurized fluid is provided to the clutches from a regulated hydraulic pressure source 28. The clutches C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 are coupled to the hydraulic pressure source via control valves 30, which regulate clutch pressure by supplying or discharging fluid to/from the clutches C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5. Brakes 42 act to apply pressure to the driveline 24 to stop the momentum of the vehicle 10 during idle conditions.<br>
[0023] Referring now to Figure 2, in the exemplary transmission, the five clutches C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 are selectively engaged to provide neutral, six forward drive ratios, and one reverse drive ratio. Although the exemplary automatic transmission 14 includes six forward drive ratios and one reverse drive ratio, it is appreciated that the hill detection system according to the present invention can be implemented in automatic transmissions having more or fewer drive ratios<br>
[0024] The table of Figure 2 illustrates an exemplary combination of engaged clutches to establish the various drive ratios. The first forward drive ratio is established by engaging the first clutch C1 and the fifth clutch C5. The second forward drive ratio is established by disengaging the fifth clutch C5 and substantially simultaneously engaging the fourth clutch C4. To establish the third forward drive ratio, the fourth clutch C4 is disengaged as the third<br><br>
8   <br>
clutch C3 is engaged. The fourth forward drive ratio is established by disengaging the third clutch C3 while engaging the second clutch C2. To establish the fifth forward drive ratio, the first clutch C1 is disengaged as the third clutch C3 is substantially simultaneously engaged. The sixth forward drive ratio is established by disengaging the third clutch C3 and simultaneously engaging the fourth clutch C4. The reverse drive ratio is established by engaging the third clutch C3 and the fifth clutch C5. The transmission 14 is in neutral when only the fifth clutch C5 is engaged.<br>
[0025] Referring back to Figure 1, a first speed sensor 32 senses a rotational speed of a turbine in the torque converter 16 and generates a turbine speed signal. A second speed sensor 34 senses a rotational speed of the output shaft 22 and generates an output speed signal. A temperature sensor 36 senses a temperature of the transmission fluid and generates a transmission temperature signal. A throttle position sensor 38 senses a position of the throttle 18 and generates a throttle position signal. A brake sensor 43 senses the status of the brakes 42 and generates a brake status signal. A control module 40 receives the above mentioned signals and determines values from the signals. Control module controls the operation of the control valves 30 during neutral idle control based on the values determined from the signals and the hill detection method of the present invention<br><br>
9<br>
[0026] In an alternative embodiment, a brake module (not shown) can also be included to provide a status of the brakes 42 to the control module 40. The brake module can also determine and provide a brake pressure to the control module 40.<br>
[0027] Referring now to Figures 1 and 3, the flowchart illustrates the steps performed during neutral idle control. Control continually executes the neutral idle control method and the hill detection method during a drive cycle. In step 100, the clutch C1 is closed. If entrance conditions for neutral idle control are met. at step 110, the clutch C1 is released in step 120. The entrance conditions include an evaluation of a hill detection flag and counter set by the hill detection method of the present invention. The flag and counter will be discussed in more detail below. The entrance conditions also include an evaluation of the transmission range, output speed, turbine speed, throttle position, the brake status, transmission temperature, and brake pressure (if available). The table of Figure 5 lists all of the conditions that should met in order to set a neutral idle control flag to TRUE and release the clutch C1.<br>
[0028] Referring back to Figures 1 and 3, once the clutch C1 is released at 130, a neutral idle control flag is set to TRUE and any slippage of the transmission is controlled in step 140. Exit conditions are also monitored. If the exit conditions are met at step 150, the clutch C1 is applied in step 160.   Exit conditions include the evaluation<br><br>
10<br>
of a hill detection flag set by the hill detection method of the present invention. This flag will be discussed in more detail below.<br>
[0029] Exit conditions also include the evaluation of the transmission range, output speed, turbine speed, throttle position, the brake status, transmission temperature, brake pressure (if available), and a brake pressure derivative (if available). At least one of the conditions listed in the table of Figure 6 should be met in order to set the neutral idle control flag to FALSE and re-apply the clutch C1. Referring back to Figures 1 and 3, if the clutch C1 is applied at step 170, the neutral idle control flag is set to FALSE and the clutch C1 remains closed in step 100.<br>
[0030] Referring now to Figure 4, a flowchart illustrating the steps performed by the hill detection method according to the present invention is shown. Control first initializes a hill counter and a hill brake pressure to zero and sets a hill detection flag to FALSE in step 200. In step 210, hill detection entrance conditions are evaluated. Hill detection entrance conditions include an evaluation of the transmission range, output speed, throttle position, transmission temperature, the brake status, brake pressure (if available), the hill counter, the hill detection flag, and the neutral idle control flag. The table of Figure 7 lists the conditions that should be evaluated.<br><br>
11<br>
[0031] Referring back to Figure 4, if all the conditions are met, control determines whether a brake pressure is available in step 220. Brake pressure can be available if the brake module is included in the vehicle to sense and determine the brake pressure. If the brake pressure is available, a hill detection flag is set to TRUE and the hill counter is incremented in step 230. In step 240, a hill brake pressure is calculated according to the following equation:<br><br>
Control then loops back to step 200 where the entrance conditions are evaluated. If the brake pressure signal is not available in step 220, the hill detection flag is set to FALSE and the hill counter is incremented in step 250. Control then loops back to step 200, where the entrance conditions are evaluated.<br>
[0032] If any of the conditions of Figure 7 are not met, hill detection exit conditions are evaluated in step 260. Hill detection exit conditions include an evaluation of output speed, throttle position, the brake status, and brake pressure. The table of Figure 8 lists the conditions that should be evaluated. If at least one of the conditions is met, the hill counter and the hill brake pressure are set to zero and the hill detection flag is set to FALSE in step 270. Control loops back to step 200 where the entrance conditions are evaluated.    Otherwise,<br><br>
12<br>
control loops back to step 200 where the entrance conditions are evaluated without resetting the values.<br>
[0033] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the invention should not be so limited since other modifications will become apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, specification, and the following claims.<br><br>
