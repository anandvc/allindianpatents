				<td>Novel use of 2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-<br>
chromane and its physiologically acceptable salts<br>
The present invention relates to the use of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-(5-(4-fluorophenyI)-<br>
3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-<br>
chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture<br>
of a medicament for the treatment of extrapyramidal movement disorders<br>
and/or for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of adverse<br>
effects of anti-Parkinsonian drugs in extrapyramidal movement disorders<br>
and/or for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of<br>
extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) induced by neuroleptics.<br>
2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridyimethylaminomethyl]-chromane, (S)-(+)-2-[5-<br>
(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyiaminomethyl]-chromane or physiologically<br>
acceptable salts thereof (US 5,767,132, column 9, lines 6 to 32) and a<br>
process (US 5,767,132, Examples 1, 6 and 19) by which it/they can be<br>
prepared are known from U.S. Patent US 5,767,132. The compounds<br>
which are referred to herein are described in the patent as a combined<br>
selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist and 5-HT1A receptor agonist.<br>
Therefore, the use of 2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-<br>
chromane and its physiologically acceptable acid addition salts and the use<br>
of its enantiomer (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-<br>
chromane and its physiologically acceptable acid addition salts for the<br>
manufacture of a medicament for prophylaxis and control of the sequelae<br>
of cerebral infarction (apoplexia cerebri) such as stroke and cerebral<br>
ischaemia, for prophylaxis and control of cerebral disorders, e.g. migraine,<br>
especially in geriatrics in a manner similar to certain ergot alkaloids, the<br>
treatment of anxiety, tension and depression states, sexual dysfunctions<br>
caused by the central nervours system, for disturbances in sleep or<br><br>
absorption of food or for the treatment of psychosis (schizophrenia) is<br>
disclosed.<br>
Additionally, they are suitable to eliminate cognitive deficiencies, to improve<br>
powers of learning and memory and to treat Alzheimer's disease. They can<br>
be furthermore used for treating side-effects in the treatment of<br>
hypertension, in endocrinology and gynecology, e.g. for the treatment of<br>
acromegaly, hypogonadism, secondary amenorrhea, premenstrual<br>
syndrome or undesired puerperal lactation.<br>
The invention had the object of providing novel uses for (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane, (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane and their<br>
physiologically acceptable salts.<br>
It has been found that (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane or physiologically acceptable salts and/or (S)-(+)-<br>
2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or<br>
physiologically acceptable salts also have therapeutic activity against<br>
extrapyramidal movement disorders such as idiopathic Parkinsons's<br>
disease, Parkinson syndromes, dyskinetic, choreatic, or dystonic<br>
syndromes, tremor, Gilles de la Torette syndrome, ballism, myoclonus,<br>
restless legs syndrome or Wilsons's disease, as well as extrapyramidal<br>
motoric disturbances [synonymous extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)]<br>
induced by neuroleptics.<br>
Additionally it has been found that (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chrornane or physiologically acceptable salts<br>
and/or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminorhethyl]-chromane<br>
or physiologically acceptable salts have therapeutic activity against adverse<br>
effects of anti-Parkinsonian drugs in extramyramidal movement disorders,<br>
in particular against dopaminomimetic adverse effects of anti-Parkinsonian<br>
drugs in idiopathic Parkinson's disease or Parkinson syndromes.<br><br>
Furthermore it has been found that (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or physiologically acceptable salts<br>
and/or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane<br>
or physiologically acceptable salts show an extremely low liability to induce<br>
extrapyramidal side effects. Extrapyramidal motor side effects in e.g.<br>
rodents are measured by the ability of a drug to induce catalepsy.<br>
Catalepsy is defined as a state where an animal continues to remain in an<br>
unnormal (nonphysiological 'uncomfortable') posture for a long time (e.g.:<br>
M.E. Stanley and S.D. Glick, Neuropharmacology, 1996; 15: 393-394;<br>
C.J.E. Niemegeers and P. Janssen, Life Sci., 1979, 201-2216). For<br>
example, if a hindpaw of a rat is placed on an elevated level, e.g. a<br>
platform elevated 3 cm above ground level, a normal rat immediately<br>
withdraws the hindpaw from the platform to the ground level. A cataleptic<br>
rat remains in this unnatural posture even for minutes.<br>
Although (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluoropheayl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-<br>
chromane or physiologically acceptable salts or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or physiologically<br>
acceptable salts have a dopamine antagonistic mechanism of action which<br>
is known to induce extrapyramidal motor side effects (C.J.E. Niemegeers<br>
and P. Janssen, Life Sci., 1979, 201-2216), unexpectely (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or physiologically<br>
acceptable salts and/or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or physiologically acceptable salts do<br>
not induce any catalepsy in rats in doses up to 500fold higher compared to<br>
the doses effective in the animal models indicative for the before-<br>
mentioned therapeutic indications.<br>
Even more unexpectedly, (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane or physiologically acceptable salts and/or (S)-(+)-<br>
2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or<br><br>
physiologically acceptable salts moreover are able to prevent catalepsy<br>
induced by conventional antidopaminergic drugs and even reverses already<br>
existing catalepsy induced by conventional antidopaminergic drugs such as<br>
haloperidol; the doses for this anticataleptic effect are in the same dose-<br>
range shown to be effective in the animal models indicative for the before-<br>
mentioned therapeutic indications.<br>
Beneficial effects on the extrapyramidal motoric system have previously<br>
been described for other drugs with 5-HT1A agonistic action. Buspirone for<br>
example, which is an anxiolytic drug by nature, exhibits moderate anti-<br>
dyskinetic properties in advanced Parkinson patients (B. Kleedorfer et al., J<br>
Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry, 1991, 54: 376-377; V. Bonifati et al., Clin<br>
Neuropharmacol, 1994,17: 73-82). The main mechanism of action is<br>
obviously via stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors of the raphe nigral and raphe<br>
striatal pathways. In contrast to buspirone, (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-<br>
3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or physiologically acceptable salts<br>
and/or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane<br>
or physiologically acceptable salts thereof are more potent agonists at the<br>
5-HT1A receptor (IC50 of buspirone: 30 nmol/l).<br>
Furthermore, (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane or physiologically acceptable salts and/or (S)-(+)-<br>
2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or<br>
physiologically acceptable salts thereof exhibit a D2 antagonism under<br>
increased doses which represents an additional advantage in comparison<br>
to conventional 5-HT1A agonists like buspirone. On one hand, the D2<br>
antagonism lowers the risk of psychotic reactions caused by the stimulation<br>
of serotonin receptors and, on the other hand, emphasises indirectly the D1<br>
properties of the co-administered non-selective D1/ D2 agonist l-dopa. A<br>
more selective stimulation of D1, receptors is known to be beneficial for the<br>
treatment of dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease (P.J. Blanchet et al., J<br>
Neural Transm. 1995, 45 (Suppl.): 103-112). Therefore both, the 5-HT1A<br><br>
agonistic and the D2 antagonistic properties of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or physiologically<br>
acceptable salts and/or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or physiologically acceptable salts<br>
thereof, contribute to the advantageous effects on the extrapyramidal<br>
motoric system.<br>
The pharmacological profile of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridyl-<br>
methyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or physiologically acceptable salts and/or<br>
(S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or<br>
physiologically acceptable salts is furthermore characterized by a high<br>
affinity to the dopamine D3 receptor. The D3 receptor is obviously involved<br>
in the pathogenesis of dyskinesia. So an association between a genetic<br>
polymorphism of the dopamine D3 receptor and the disposition to develop<br>
tardive dyskinesia has recently been reported (Segmann et al. 1999, Mol-<br>
Psychiatry 4: 247). Additionally, there is obviously an increased density of<br>
dopamine D3 receptors in Parkinson patients with l-dopa-induced<br>
dyskinesia. Therefore, the interaction of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or physiologically acceptable salts<br>
and/or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane<br>
or physiologically acceptable salts with the dopamine D3 receptor is an<br>
additional important mechanism leading to beneficial effects on the<br>
extrapyramidal system, in particular in the treatment of dyskinesia.<br>
The atypical neuroleptic clozapine is regarding the extrapyramidal effects -<br>
but not regarding structure or side effects - congruent with (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-<br>
(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or physiologically<br>
acceptable salts and/or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or physiologically acceptable salts<br>
particularly in scope of the anticataleptic properties. Recent studies provide<br>
evidence that clozapine ameliorates dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease (F.<br>
Perelli et al., Acta Neurol Scan, 1998, 97: 295-299; P. Pollak et al., Lancet,<br><br>
1999, 353: 2041-2041). Besides that, clozapine is known to have a variety<br>
of other beneficial effects on extrapyramidal movement disorders, like in<br>
tardive dyskinesia, tremor, Huntington's disease, Tourette's syndrome,<br>
akathisia and dopaminomimetic psychosis (C. Pfeiffer and M. L. Wagner,<br>
Am J Hosp Pharm, 1994, 51: 3047-3053). (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-<br>
3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or physiologically acceptable salts<br>
thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-<br>
chromane or physiologically acceptable salts thereof improve these kinds<br>
of movement disorders even without bearing the risk of the fatal side<br>
effects of clozapine like agranulocytosis and acute nephritis (J. Alvir et al.,<br>
N Engl J Med, 1993, 329:162-167; T. J Elias et al., Lancet, 1999, 354:<br>
1180-1181).<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to the use of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or physiologically<br>
acceptable salts thereof and/or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or physiologically acceptable salts<br>
thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of<br>
extrapyramidal movement disorders.<br>
A preferred salt of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyll-chromaneis(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
A preferred salt of (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane is(S)-(-)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Therefore, the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of extrapyramidal movement disorders in<br>
which the pharmacologically acceptable salt is (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br><br>
Therefore, the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of extrapyramidal movement disorders in<br>
which the pharmacologically acceptable salt is (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-<br>
3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Additionally, the invention relates to the use of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing at least one compound of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or one of their<br>
biocompatible salts together with at least one solid, liquid or semiliquid<br>
excipient or adjunct for the treatment of extrapyramidal movement<br>
disorders.<br>
(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane<br>
and/or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-<br>
chromane or their physiologically acceptable salts, useful for the treatment<br>
of extrapyramidal movement disorders', in particular for the treatment of<br>
idiopathic Parkinson's disease, Parkinson syndromes, dyskinetic, choreatic<br>
or dystonic syndromes, extrapyramidal motoric adverse effects of<br>
neuroleptics, tremor, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, ballism, myoclonus,<br>
restless legs syndrome or Wilson's disease and/or useful for the treatment<br>
of adverse effects in idiopathic Parkinson's disease or Parkinson<br>
syndromes including medicinal compositions as defined below, are<br>
preferably administered in doses from 0.1 to 100 mg. preferentially<br>
between approximately 1 and 20 mg. The composition may be<br>
administered once or more times a day, e.g. 2, 3. or 4 times daily. The<br>
specific dose for each patient depends on all sorts of factors, e.g. on the<br>
activity of the specific compound employed, on the age, body weight,<br>
general state of health, on sex, diet, time and route of administration, on<br>
the excretion rate, pharmaceutical substance combination and on the<br>
severity of the particular disorder to which the therapy relates. Oral<br><br>
administration is preferred, but also parenteral routes of administration (e.g.<br>
intravenous or transdermal) can be utilized.<br>
Anti-Parkinsonian drugs are conventional drugs such as l-dopa (levodopa)<br>
and l-dopa combined with benserazide or carbidopa, dopamine agonists<br>
such as bromocriptine, apomorphine, cabergoline, pramipexol, ropinirol,<br>
pergolide, dihydro-α-ergocriptine or lisuride plus all drugs acting via<br>
stimulation of dopamine receptors, inhibitors of catechol-O-methyl<br>
transferase (COMT) such as entacapone or tolcapone, inhibitors of<br>
monoamine oxidase (MAO) such as selegiline and antagonists of N-methyl-<br>
D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors such as amantadine or budipine.<br>
Adverse effects of said anti-Parkinsonian drugs are all types of dyskinesias,<br>
such as choreic, dystonic, ballistic and myoclonic dyskinesia, as well as<br>
motor (response) fluctuations or psychotic states.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to the use of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof and/or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of adverse<br>
effects of anti-Parkinsonian drugs in idiopathic Parkinson's disease.<br>
Treatment of adverse effects of conventional anti-Parkinsonian drugs as<br>
defined above are determined in a modification of the animal model of the<br>
Parkinsonian cynomolgus monkey according to P.J. Blanchet et al., Exp.<br>
Neurology 1998; 153: 214-222. Monkeys render parkinsonian by repeated<br>
injections of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The<br>
Parkinsonian monkeys are chronically treated with the standard l-dopa<br>
therapy according to P.J. Blanchet et al., Mov. Disord., 1998; 13: 798-802.<br>
Longterm treatment with l-dopa induces extrapyramidal motor side effects<br><br>
and psychotic states which are both qualitatively and quantitatively,<br>
assessed by the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (P.J. Blanchet et<br>
al., Mov. Disord. 1998; 13: 798-802) for different body parts (face, neck,<br>
trunk, each limb) and by rating for psychotic states by observing the<br>
monkey's attention, reactivity and mobility. (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-<br>
3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane and/or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane reduced overall<br>
choreiform dyskinesias and dystonic dyskinesias as well as psychotic<br>
states.<br>
A typical study to investigate the efficacy of the compounds according to<br>
the invention for adverse effects in Parkinson's disease is described in the<br>
following. 40 patients of either sex with advanced idiopathic Parkinson's<br>
disease complicated by "peak-dose" dyskinesia participate in a double-<br>
blind, cross-over study. The main inclusion criteria are Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage<br>
&gt; 2.5 (lit: Hoehn H.M. et al, Neurology 1967; 17: 427-442), aged 40-75<br>
years, symptom duration of at least 5 years, and a l-dopa treatment<br>
duration of at least 3 years. (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride or<br>
placebo is administered as "add on" to the conventional Parkinson<br>
treatment, which is maintained unchanged during the whole study. The<br>
dose of blinded medication is titrated over a period of 3 weeks in a range<br>
from 2.5 to 10 mg b.i.d. Then the medication is kept constant for 1 week.<br>
Before the start of titration and at the end of the treatment period a l-dopa<br>
challenge is performed according to P. Damier et al. (Movement<br>
Disord.1999, 14 (Suppl. 1), 54-59) using video recording. The main<br>
outcome measure of the protocol is the mean score for dyskinesia during<br>
the first hour in the "on" state after l-dopa challenge. Therefore, the<br>
investigator assesses every minute the severity of dyskinesia (0 = absent, 4<br>
= severe disabling involuntary movements) from 0 to 4 in seven parts of the<br><br>
body (upper and lower limbs, face, trunk, neck). After a 2-week wash-out<br>
period the two study arms are crossed over and the protocol is repeated.<br>
The statistical analysis of the mean dyskinesia scores demonstrates a<br>
significant clinical improvement under treatment with (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride or (S)-<br>
(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane<br>
hydrochloride.<br>
A preferred salt of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane is(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
A preferred salt of (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane is(SH+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Therefore, the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of adverse effects of anti-Parkinsonian drugs<br>
in idiopathic Parkinson's disease in which the pharmacologically acceptable<br>
salt is(R/SH-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-<br>
chromane hydrochloride or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Additionally, the invention relates to the use of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing at least one compound of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or one of its<br>
biocompatible salts or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane or one of its biocompatible salts together with at<br>
least one solid, liquid or semiliquid excipient or adjunct for the treatment of<br>
adverse effects of anti-Parkinsonian drugs in idiopathic Parkinson's<br>
disease.<br><br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to the use of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or one of its<br>
biocompatible salts and/or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyi-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane or one of its biocompatible salts, for the<br>
manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's<br>
disease.<br>
A typical animal model for idiopathic Parkinson's disease is the<br>
Parkinsonian cynomolgus monkey according to P.J. Blanchet et a/., Exp.<br>
Neurology 1998; 153: 214-222. Monkeys render parkinsonian by repeated<br>
injections of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).<br>
Parkinsonian symptoms are qualitatively assessed by the use of the Laval<br>
University Disability Scale (B. Gomez-Mancilla et al., 1993; Mov. Disord. 8:<br>
144-150) measuring the following symptoms: posture, mobility, climbing,<br>
gait, holding food, vocalizing, grooming, social interaction. (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-<br>
(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridy!methyl-aminomethyl]-chromane reduced all the<br>
parkinsonian symptoms and increased total activity.<br>
A typical study to investigate the efficacy of the compounds according to<br>
the invention in the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease is<br>
described in the following. 180 patients of either sex with idiopathic<br>
Parkinson's disease participate in a double-blind study. The main inclusion<br>
criteria are Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage &gt; 2.0 (Hoehn H.M. et al, Neurology 1967;<br>
17: 427-442), aged 50-80 years, symptom duration of at least 5 years.<br>
(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-3-pyridyl-methyl-aminomethyl]-chromane<br>
hydrochloride or(S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-<br>
chromane or placebo is administered as "add on" to the conventional<br>
Parkinson treatment, which is maintained unchanged during the whole<br>
study. The dose of blinded medication is titrated over a period of 4 weeks<br>
in a range from 2.5 to 10 mg b.i.d. Then the medication is kept constant for<br><br>
1	week. Before the start of titration, at the end of the treatment period and<br>
2	weeks after the end of the tiration period an assessment is performed in<br>
each patients using the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS<br>
part I to V according to S. Fahn et al., in: Recent developments in<br>
Parkinson's disease, vol. 2, MacMillan health information 1987, 153-163).<br>
This allows to detect simultaneously a beneficial effect of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-<br>
(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or one of its<br>
biocompatible salts or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane or one of its biocompatible salts, in particular of<br>
(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane<br>
hydrochloride or (S)-(/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride, on the global motoric function, on<br>
dystonia, motor fluctuations, and on psychosis. Furthermore, the efficacy to<br>
treat tremor is shown by the means of the UPDRS. The statistical analysis<br>
of the UPDRS scores demonstrates a significant clinical improvement<br>
under treatment with (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-3-pyridyl-methyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride' or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Therefore the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease in which the<br>
physiologically acceptable salt is (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethylj-chromane hydrochloride or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Additionally, the invention relates to the use of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing at least one compound of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or one of its<br>
biocompatible salts or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane or one of its biocompatible salts together with at<br><br>
least one solid, liquid or semiliquid excipient or adjunct for the treatment of<br>
idiopathic Parkinson's disease.<br>
The limiting factor of Parkinson treatment with l-dopa and/or dopamine<br>
agonists is often the occurence of psychosis or dyskinesia and other motor<br>
fluctuations.<br>
It has been found that (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof and/or<br>
(S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a<br>
physiologically acceptable salt thereof enhance the anti-Parkinsonian effect<br>
of anti-Parkinsonian drugs as defined above without inducing<br>
extrapyramidal side effects.<br>
Therefore, the add-on therapy with (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof and/or the therapy with (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminornethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof, in particular of their hydrochlorides, now opens the possibility to<br>
increase the doses of l-dopa and/or dopamine agonists and/or all other<br>
anti-Parkinsonian drugs as defined above in order to counteract periods of<br>
insufficient motility ("off" phases) without provoking the above mentioned<br>
side effects. That represents an entirely novel approach in the treatment of<br>
Parkinson's disease leading to a significant benefit for the patients.<br>
Thus, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as<br>
active principles, (i) (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or (S)-<br>
(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a<br>
physiologically acceptable salt thereof, and (ii) at least one anti-<br>
parkinsonian drug, in combination with one or more pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients.<br><br>
Particularly, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising, as active principles, (i) (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride, and<br>
(ii) l-dopa or l-dopa combined with benserazide or carbidopa, in<br>
combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
The ratios of the respective amounts of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or on of its physiologically<br>
acceptable salts and/or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fIuorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyi-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane or one of its physiologically acceptable salts and<br>
of the conventional anti-Parkinsonian drug thus vary in consequences.<br>
Preferably, the weight ratio of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fIuorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or one of its biocompatible salts or<br>
(S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or<br>
one of its physiologically acceptable salts to the conventional anti-<br>
parkinsonian drug ranges from 1:1 to 1:100, preferably from 1:10 to 1:90<br>
and better still from 1:40 to 1:60.<br>
Another subject of the present invention is additionally the use of (R/S)-(-<br>
/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or one of<br>
its physiologically acceptable salts or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or one of its physiologically<br>
acceptable salts in combination with at least one anti-Parkinsonian drug, for<br>
the preparation of a medicinal combination intended to enhance the anti-<br>
parkinsonian effect of said anti-Parkinsonian drugs.<br>
According to the invention, the term "medicinal combination" is inteded to<br>
refer either to a pharmaceutical composition as defined above, in which the<br>
two active principles or compounds are the essential constituents of the<br>
same composition, or to a kit comprising two separate compositions, the<br><br>
first comprising (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane or one of its physiologically acceptable salts as<br>
sole active principle, and the second comprising at least one anti-<br>
parkinsonian drug as active compound.<br>
According to the invention, the term "medicinal combination" is inteded to<br>
refer either to a pharmaceutical composition as defined above, in which the<br>
two active principles or compounds are the essential constituents of the<br>
same composition, or to a kit comprising two separate compositions, the<br>
first comprising (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-<br>
chromane or one of its physiologically acceptable salts as sole active<br>
principle, and the second comprising at least one anti-Parkinsonian drug as<br>
active compound.<br>
When the medicinal combination is in the form of a kit, the administration of<br>
the two compositions constituting this kit, although carried out separately, is<br>
simultaneous for a combined therapy. It is preferred to use (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-<br>
(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane in the form of the<br>
hydrochloride.<br>
Adverse effects of anti-Parkinsonian drugs as defined above are<br>
additionally known in particular in Parkinson syndromes.<br>
Parkinson syndromes are e.g. multiple system atrophies (MSA),<br>
Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome (= progressive supranuclear<br>
palsy), cortico-basal degeneration, olivo-ponto cerebellar atrophy or Shy<br>
Drager syndrome.<br>
(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or<br>
a physiologically acceptable salt and/or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br><br>
thereof are useful for the treatment of Parkinson syndromes in particular of<br>
multiple system atrophies.<br>
Therefore the present invention relates to the use of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof and/or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of adverse<br>
effects in Parkinson syndromes.<br>
The present invention relates additionally to the use of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof and/or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of<br>
Parkinson syndromes.<br>
A typical animal model is the reserpinized rat or mouse (e.g. M.S. Starr and<br>
B.S. Starr, J. Neural Transm. - Park. Dis. Dement. Sect., 1994; 7: 133-142;<br>
M. Gossel et al., J. Neural Transm. - Park. Dis. Dement. Sect., 1995; 10:<br>
27-39; N.R. Hughes et al., Mov. Disord., 1998; 13: 228-233). Reserpine is a<br>
potent depleter of monoamines and produces nearly complete akinesia in<br>
both species. Prominent 24 h after application, the distance travelled and<br>
the time active is nearly zero as measured in conventional activity meters.<br>
(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or<br>
a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof dose-dependently reduced akinesia, i.e. restored distance travelled<br>
and time active to about the level of normal animals.<br><br>
Another more recent animal model is the striatonigral degeneration<br>
approach in the rat according to G.K. Wenning et a/., J. Neural Transm.<br>
Suppl., 1999; 55: 103-113. Rats receive an unilateral injection of 6-<br>
hydroxydopamine into the left medial forebrain bundle followed by an<br>
injection of quinolinic acid into the ipsilateral striatum inducing nigrostriatal<br>
degeneration. The degeneration results in turning behavior to a challenge<br>
with dopaminomimetics such as apomorphine or amphetamine. Turning<br>
behavior is measured by an automated recorder. Turning behavior induced<br>
by apomorphine or amphetamine is dose-dependently antagonized by<br>
(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or<br>
a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof.<br>
Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is due to an expansive neurodegeneration<br>
in the extrapyramidal and autonomic nervous system which leads to an<br>
akinetic Parkinsonian syndrome with vegetative disturbances. In contrast to<br>
idiopathic Parkinson's disease the density of central dopamine receptors is<br>
markedly decreased and therefore, MSA patients poorly respond to<br>
dopaminergic drugs. Since (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or (S)-<br>
(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a<br>
physiologically acceptable salt thereof act predominantly via serotonin<br>
receptors on the extrapyramidal system, they are able to improve the motor<br>
performance in these otherwise mostly untreatable patients.<br>
A typical study to investigate the efficacy of the compounds according to<br>
the invention in MSA patients encompasses 30 patients of either sex with a<br>
symptom duration of at least 5 years and a significant reduction of central<br>
dopamine receptors in positron emission tomography (PET) scan. The<br>
study design is similar to that described above for Parkinson's disease.<br><br>
(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane<br>
hydrochloride or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-<br>
chromane hydrochloride or placebo is titrated as "add on" to the<br>
conventional treatment (dose range 2.5 to 20 mg b.i.d.). Before the start of<br>
titration and at the end of the treatment period a complete UPDRS<br>
assessment is performed in each patient (primary outcome measure). After<br>
a 2-week wash-out period the two study arms are crossed over and the<br>
protocol is repeated. Statistical analysis of UPDRS demonstrates a<br>
significant clinical improvement under treatment with (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride or (S)-<br>
(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane<br>
hydrochloride.<br>
Therefore, the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of adverse effects of anti-Parkinsonian drugs<br>
in Parkinson syndromes in which the pharmacologically acceptable salt is<br>
(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane<br>
hydrochloride.<br>
Therefore, the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of adverse effects of anti-Parkinsonian drugs<br>
in Parkinson syndromes in which the pharmacologically acceptable salt is<br>
(S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane<br>
hydrochloride.<br>
Additionally, the invention relates to the use of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing at least one compound of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof together with at least one solid, liquid or semiliquid excipient or<br>
adjunct for the treatment of adverse effects of anti-Parkinsonian drugs in<br>
Parkinson syndromes.<br><br>
Therefore, the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of Parkinson syndromes in which the<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salt is (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Therefore, the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of Parkinson syndromes in which the<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salt is (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Additionally, the invention relates to the use of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing at least one compound of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof together with at least one solid, liquid or semiliquid excipient or<br>
adjunct for the treatment of Parkinson syndromes.<br>
The present invention relates to the use of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-I5-(4-fluorophenyl)-<br>
3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof and/or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-<br>
chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture<br>
of a medicament for the treatment of dyskinetic and/or choreatic<br>
syndromes.<br>
Dyskinetic and/or choreatic syndromes are e.g. Huntington's disease, minor<br>
chorea or chorea of pregnancy.<br>
(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or<br>
a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyhdylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof are in particular useful for the treatment of Huntington's disease.<br><br>
A typical animal model is the systemic 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) model in<br>
rats according to C.V. Boriongan et a/., Brain Res., 1995; 697: 254-257.<br>
Rats are treated with injections of the selective striatal neurotoxin 3-NP i.p.<br>
every fourth day (C.V. Boriongan et a/.., Brain Res. Protocols, 1997; 1: 253-<br>
257). After two injections of 3-NP, rats display nocturnal hyperactivity<br>
reflecting symptoms of early Huntington's disease, whereas rats treated<br>
with four injections of 3-NP display nocturnal akinesia (hypoactivity)<br>
reflecting symptoms of late Huntington's disease. Nocturnal activity is<br>
automatically measured in conventional acitivity cages by infrared beams.<br>
(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or<br>
a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof reduce both the nocturnal hyperactivity and akinesia.<br>
A typical trial to establish the effect of the compounds according to the<br>
invention on chorea, voluntary motor performance, and functional disability<br>
in patients with Huntington's disease encompasses 32 genetically<br>
diagnosed patients. (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride or placebo is<br>
administered as "add on" to the conventional treatment, which is<br>
maintained unchanged during the whole study. The dose of blinded<br>
medication is titrated over a period of 3 weeks in a range from 2.5 to 20 mg<br>
b.i.d. Then the medication is held constant for 1 week. Assessments are<br>
performed in the week before and at the last day of the trial. Chorea is<br>
scored using the abnormal involuntary movement scale (AIMS, W. Guy, in:<br>
ECDEU assessment manual. Rockville MD: US dept. of health, education<br>
and welfare, 1976: 534-537), the unified Huntington's disease rating scale<br>
(UHDRS, Huntington study group, 1996, Movement Disord, 11: 136-42),<br>
and judgement of video recordings. Voluntary motor performance is<br><br>
assessed using the UHDRS motor scale. Patients and their partners<br>
complete a questionnaire regarding functional disability. Statistical analysis<br>
demonstrates significant improvement of voluntary and involuntary motor<br>
performance in Huntington patients under treatment with (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof.<br>
A preferred salt of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane is(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Therefore, the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of dyskinetic and/or choreatic syndromes, in<br>
particular for the treatment of Huntington's disease, in which the<br>
pharmacologically"acceptable salt is (R7S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chrornane hydrochloride.<br>
A preferred salt of (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane is(S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Therefore, the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of dyskinetic and/or choreatic syndromes, in<br>
particular for the treatment of Huntington's disease, in which the<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salt is (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Additionally, the invention relates to the use of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing at least one compound of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically<br><br>
acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof together with at least one solid, liquid or semiliquid excipient or<br>
adjunct for the treatment of dyskinetic and/or choreatic syndromes.<br>
The present invention relates to the use of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-<br>
3-pyridylmethyl-aminornethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-<br>
chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture<br>
of a medicament for the treatment of dystonic syndromes.<br>
Dystonic syndromes are e.g. spasmalic torticollis, writer's cramp,<br>
blepharospasm, Meige syndrome or dopasensitive dystonia.<br>
(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or<br>
a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof is in particular useful for the treatment of spasmalic torticollis and/or<br>
blepharospasm.<br>
A typical animal model is the mutant dystonic hamster according to A.<br>
Richter and W. Loscher, Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 54: 633-677. In this<br>
genetically dystonic hamsters, dystonic attacks are provoked by taking the<br>
animal from the home cage and placing it on a balance. The dystonic<br>
syndrome consists of a sequence of abnormal movements, and the<br>
severity of the single symptoms is rated by a scoring system. (R/S)-(-/+)-2-<br>
[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a<br>
physiologically acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof dose-dependently reduce the severity of dystonic symptoms.<br><br>
To demonstrate the efficacy of the compounds according to the invention in<br>
dystonic syndromes, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study is performed<br>
in patients with cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis) who do not tolerate<br>
injection of botulinum toxin. (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride is<br>
titrated as described above in the range from 2.5 mg to 20 mg b.i.d. The<br>
Toronto western spasmodic torticollis rating scale (TWSTRS, C.L. Cornelia<br>
et al., 1997, Movement Disord, 12: 570-575) is used as primary outcome<br>
measure. A significant improvement in the TWSTRS scores is noted for the<br>
patients treated with (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or (S)-<br>
(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a<br>
physiologically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
A preferred salt of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane is(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Therefore the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of dystonic syndromes, in particular of<br>
spasmalic torticollis and/or blepharospasm, in which the pharmacologically<br>
acceptable salt is (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
A preferred salt of (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane is (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Therefore the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of dystonic syndromes, in particular of<br><br>
spasmalic torticollis and/or blepharospasm, in which the pharmacologically<br>
acceptable salt is (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Additionally, the invention relates to the use of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing at least one compound of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluoropheny!)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof together with at least one solid, liquid or semiliquid excipient or<br>
adjunct for the treatment of dystonic syndromes.<br>
The present invention relates to the use of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-<br>
3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-<br>
chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture<br>
of a medicament for the treatment of extrapyramidal symptoms induced by<br>
neuroleptics.<br>
Extrapyramidal motoric disturbances induced by neuroleptics are e.g. early<br>
dyskinesia, dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonoid, in particular bradykinesia, or<br>
tardive dyskinesia.<br>
(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or<br>
a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof are useful particularly for the treatment of akathisia and/or tardive<br>
dyskinesia and/or parkinsonoid.<br>
A typical animal model is neuroleptics-induced muscle rigidity in rats<br>
according to S. Wolfarth et al., Arch. Pharmacol. 1992; 345: 209-212. Rats<br>
are challenged with the conventional neuroleptic drug haloperidol which<br>
enhances muscle tone. Muscle tone is electromechanically measured as<br><br>
the resistence to passive flexion and extension of the hind limb. (R/S)-(-/+)-<br>
2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a<br>
physiologically acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof thereof decrease the mucle tone enhanced by haloperidol.<br>
Another typical animal model is the neuroleptics sensitized monkey<br>
according to D.E. Casey, Psychopharmacology, 1996; 124: 134-140.<br>
Monkeys treated repeatedly with conventional neuroleptics are highly<br>
sensitive to a subsequent challenge dose of neuroleptic drugs. When<br>
challenged, the monkeys immediately show extrapyramidal motor side<br>
effects such as dystonia, dyskinesias, akathisia, and bradykinesia which<br>
are rated by a scoring system. The conventional neuroleptic drug<br>
haloperidol is given as a challenge. When the before-mentioned<br>
extrapyramidal motor side effects occur, (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-<br>
chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof is administered;<br>
(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or<br>
(SH+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane dose-<br>
dependently reduce the extrapyramidal motor side effects.<br>
Tardive dyskinesia is a common adverse effect of long-term treatment with<br>
neuroleptics. A typical study to investigate the efficacy of the compounds<br>
according to the invention in tardive dyskinesia is described in the following.<br>
32 schizophrenic (DSM-III-R) inpatients aged 25 - 60 years on long-term<br>
stable antipsychotic treatment (duration of at least 5 years) entered the<br>
study. (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-<br>
chromane hydrochloride or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride or placebo is<br>
administered as "add on" to the antipsychotic treatment, which is Kept<br><br>
constant during the whole study. The dose of blinded medication is titrated<br>
over a period of 3 weeks in a range from 2.5 to 20 mg b.i.d. Then the<br>
medication is maintained under double-blind conditions for 2 weeks. After a<br>
2-week wash-out period, the test drugs are crossed over. Assessments of<br>
tardive dyskinesia by means of the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale<br>
(AIMS, see obove) and of Parkinsonian extrapyramidal side effects<br>
(UPDRS, see above) are made pretreatment and posttreatment. AIMS<br>
scores during treatment with (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride are<br>
significantly lower than during placebo period.<br>
A preferred salt of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane is(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Therefore the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of extrapyramidal symptoms induced by<br>
neuroleptics, in particular of akathisia and/or tardive dyskinesia, in which<br>
the pharmacologically acceptable salt is (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
A preferred salt of (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane is (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Therefore the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of extrapyramidal symptoms induced by<br>
neuroleptics, in particular of akathisia and/or tardive dyskinesia, in which<br>
the pharmacologically acceptable salt is (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br><br>
Additionally, the invention relates to the use of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing at least one compound of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof together with at least one solid, liquid or semiliquid excipient or<br>
adjunct for the treatment of extrapyramidal symptoms induced by<br>
neuroleptics.<br>
The present invention relates to the use of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-<br>
3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-<br>
chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture<br>
of a medicament for the treatment of tremor.<br>
Tremor includes all types of tremors such as essential tremor, activated<br>
physiological tremor, cerebellar tremor', orthostatic tremor or drug-induced<br>
tremor.<br>
(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or<br>
a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof are particularly useful for the treatment of essential tremor and/or<br>
drug-induced tremor.<br>
Typical animal models utilize either genetic mutant animals or are models<br>
where tremor is induced by a pharmacological agent (for review: H. Wilms<br>
et al., Mov. Disord., 1999; 14: 557-571).<br>
Typical genetic models in mutant animals are the Campus Syndrome in the<br>
Pietrain pig according to A. Richter et al. (Exp. Neurology, 1995; 134: 205-<br>
213) or the Weaver mutant mouse according to J.R. Simon and B. Ghetti<br><br>
(Mol. Neurobiol., 1994; 9: 183-189). In the Campus Syndrome model,<br>
these mutant pigs show a high-frequency tremor when standing and during<br>
locomotion, but not while lying at rest. Assessment of tremor is made by<br>
accelerometric recording. In the Weaver mutant mouse, degenerative<br>
cerebellar atrophy is fould in association with tremor, gait instability, and<br>
toppling over the sides after a few steps. Gait disability and toppling result<br>
in dramatically reduced locomotor activity measured by the distance<br>
travelled and the time spent with ambulation in conventional activity cages.<br>
(R/SH-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or<br>
a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof improve the Campus Syndrome in the Pietrain pig, i.e. reduce<br>
disabling tremor when standing and during locomotion, and enhance<br>
locomotor activity in the Weaver mutant mouse.<br>
A typical animal model for drug-induced tremors is the oxotremorine-<br>
induced tremor (e.g. H. Hallberg and O. Almgren, Acta Physiol. Scand.,<br>
1987; 129: 407-13; J.G. Clement and W.R. Dyck, J. Pharmacol. Meth.,<br>
1989; 22: 25-36). Oxotremorine induces tremor which is measured by a<br>
rating scale. (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-<br>
chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof inhibit oxotremorine-induced tremors.<br>
A preferred salt of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chrornane is (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Therefore the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of tremors, in particular of essential tremors<br><br>
and/or drug-induced tremors, in which the pharmacologically acceptable<br>
salt is(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-<br>
chromane hydrochloride.<br>
A preferred salt of (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane is (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Therefore the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of tremors, in particular of essential tremors<br>
and/or drug-induced tremors, in which the pharmacologically acceptable<br>
salt is(S)-(+)-2-{5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane<br>
hydrochloride.<br>
Additionally, the invention relates to the use of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing at least one compound of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof together with at least one solid, liquid or semiliquid excipient or<br>
adjunct for the treatment of tremor.<br>
The present invention relates to the use of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)<br>
3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethy!]-chrornane or a physiologically acceptable sa<br>
thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-<br>
chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture<br>
of a medicament for the treatment of extrapyramidal movement disorders<br>
chosen from the group consisting of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome,<br>
bailism, myoclonus, restless legs syndrome and Wilson's disease.<br><br>
A typical animal model for myoclonus is myoclonus induced by an acute<br>
hypoxic episode according to D.D. Truong et a/., Mov. Dsiord., 1994; 9:<br>
201-206). In this model of posthypoxic myoclonus, rats undergo a cardiac<br>
arrest for 8 minutes and are resuscitated thereafter. Myoclonic jerks occur<br>
spontaneously but can be provoked by auditory stimulation, too, worsening<br>
over the days following cardiac arrest. (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-<br>
chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof dose-dependently<br>
reduce the number of spontaneous and autitory-evoked myoclonic jerks.<br>
A preferred salt of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane is(R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Therefore the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of extrapyramidal movement disorders<br>
chosen from the group consisting of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome,<br>
ballism, myoclonus, restless legs syndrome and Wilson's disease in which<br>
the pharmacologically acceptable salt is (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
A preferred salt of (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane is (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-<br>
aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Therefore the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of extrapyramidal movement disorders<br>
chosen from the group consisting of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome,<br>
ballism, myoclonus, restless legs syndrome and Wilson's disease in which<br><br>
the pharmacologically acceptable salt is (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane hydrochloride.<br>
Additionally, the invention relates to the use of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing at least one compound of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof together with at least one solid, liquid or semiliquid excipient or<br>
adjunct for the treatment of extrapyramidal movement disorders chosen<br>
from the group consisting of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, ballism,<br>
myoclonus, restless legs syndrome and Wilson's disease.<br>
The extrapyramidal movement disorders such as<br>
Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome (= progressive supranuclear<br>
palsy), cortico-basal degeneration, olivo-ponto cerebellar atrophy, Shy<br>
Drager syndrome, minor chorea, chorea of pregnancy, writer's cramp,<br>
blepharospasm, Meige syndrome, dopa-sensitive dystonia, Gilles de la<br>
Tourette syndrome, ballism, myoclonus, restless legs syndrome, and<br>
Wilson's disease are not frequent enough to perform regular double-blind<br>
trials. However, the medical need in this field is pressing since no sufficient<br>
therapies are available so far.<br>
Therefore, open-label observations in few selected patients are an<br>
adequate method to demonstrate the efficacy of (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof.<br>
All the pharmaceutical preparations used for the treatment of<br>
extrapyramidal movement disorders and/or for the treatment of adverse<br><br>
effects of anti-Parkinsonian drugs in extrapyramidal movement disorders<br>
including the medicinal combination can be used as pharmaceuticals in<br>
human or veterinary medicine.<br>
The compositions of the invention are preferably administered parenterally,<br>
or better still orally, although the other routes of administration, for instance<br>
such as rectal administration, are not excluded.<br>
Suitable excipients are organic or inorganic substances which are suitable<br>
for enteral (e.g. oral), parenteral or topical adminstration and which do not<br>
react with (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethyl-aminomethyl]-<br>
chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-chromane or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof, for example water, vegetable oils, benzyl alcohols,<br>
alkylene glycols, polyethylene glycols, glycerol triacetate, gelatine,<br>
carbohydrates such as lactose or starch, magnesium stearate, talc,<br>
petroleum jelly. Forms which are used for oral administration are, in<br>
particular, tablets, pills, sugar-coated tablets, capsules, powders, granules,<br>
syrups, liquids or drops, forms for rectal administration are, in particular<br>
suppositories, forms for parenteral administration are, in particular,<br>
solvents, preferably oily or aqueous solutions, furthermore suspensions,<br>
emulsions or implants, and forms for topical administration are transdermal<br>
plasters, ointments, creams or powders. (R/S)-(-/+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-<br>
pyridylmethyl-aminomethyll-chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof or (S)-(+)-2-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-pyridylmethylaminomethyl]-<br>
chromane or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof may also be<br>
lyophilized and the resulting lyophilisates used for example for the<br>
preparation of injectable products. The abovementioned preparations can<br>
be in sterilized form and/or comprise auxiliaries such as glidants,<br>
preservatives, stabilizers and/or wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for<br>
modifying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, colourings, flavourings<br>
and/or other active ingredients, e.g. one or more vitamins.<br><br>
Preparations may, if desired, be designed to give slow release of (R/S)-(-<br>
