3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF 3-SUBSTITUTED-l, 2-DIHYDROXYBENZENE, 2-SUBSTITUTED-l, 4-DIHYDROXY BENZENE AND THEIR DERIVATIVES THEREOF<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to process for the preparation of 3 -substituted- 1,2-dihydroxybenzene (I), 2-substituted-1, 4-dihydroxybenzene (II) and their symmetric and unsymmetrical O-alkyl, aralkyl, substituted and unsubstituted alkyl or aralkyl derivatives from 2-substituted phenols and an allyl halide.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
1, 2-dihydroxybenzenes i.e., catechols exhibit a variety of molecular modes of action in biological Systems and have attracted the attention of the pharmaceutical industry. Among the catechols in general, catechols that have a substituent on 3-position are of particular interest. 3-fluorocatechol and its alkoxy derivatives are potential precursors in the synthesis of a wide range of Pharmaceuticals such as adrenergic catecholamine, biogenic amines and the recent 2-iminopyrrolidine derivatives as thrombin receptor antagonists.<br>
Few methods are available which either give a very poor to moderate yield or unselective methods utilizing 2-substituted phenol particularly 2-fluorophenol as a key starting material. They also involve elaborative approach, much expensive, raw materials, and use of expensive organometallic reagents, which lead to problems with handling, safety, and waste disposal. Some of the methods also involve troublesome laborious biochemical approach giving very poor yield and difficulty in scale-up for large-scale industrial production.<br>
For example, Hansen et al., (Tetrahedron Lett 46, 2005, 3357-3358) have reported a surprising yield of 66 % for 3-fluorocatechol employing a typical procedure reported for 3-bromocatechol, Which involves magnesium chloride, para formaldehyde, triethyl amine base and tetrahydrofuran solvent in an atmosphere of Argon. According to their procedure, insitu oxidation of the expected 3-fluorosalicylaldehyde gives 3-fluorocatechol.<br>
Lynch et al., (J. Biotechnol, 58,1997, 167-175) have disclosed the preparation of 3-fluorocatechol from fluorobenzene by utilizing pseudomonas putida ML2 biocatalyst. This method involves a longer reaction time, huge reaction mass volume and as a whole is laborious and the yield is rather poor for industrial scale-up.<br>
Finkelstein et al., (Applied and Environmental Microbiology, Vol.66, 2000, 2148-2153) have described   the   preparation   of   3-fluorocatechol   from   2-fluorophenol   by   a   biochemical<br><br><br>
transformation. Again this method is low yielding, troublesome, time consuming and doesn't fit for large scale industrial production.<br>
Other workers like Martan et al. in US 4124643 have disclosed a method for preparing 2-allyl-6-fluorophenol with only 88% conversion of 2-fluorophenol employing allyl chloride as other starting material. In their art, the reaction is not completed and involves purification of the product by vacuum distillation resulting in only 76.6 % molar yield. In the next stage, the process involved Claisen’s type rearrangement of allyl-2-fluorophenylether in the presence of t-butylhydroxyanisole as an antioxidant and sodium carbonate as a base catalyst under nitrogen atmosphere. The disadvantage of this step is that it gives low yield and involves distillation procedures. Ladd et al. (Synth. Commun., 15(1), 1985, 61-69) have reported a process for producing 1-fluoro-2, 3-dimethoxybenzene (8, R=F, R1=R2=CH3) starting from 2-fluorophenol (1, R=F) and allyl bromide. In their method the first step involves extraction of the product with ether solvent after quenching the cooled reaction mass with water. The disadvantage of this method is that it is expensive, involves unnecessary extraction of the product with a solvent and distillation of the product leading to 85 % molar yield only. The overall yield of the targeted product is only about 40%.<br>
Recently, Suzuki et al. in US 20050004204, have disclosed a process for preparing 1, 2-diethoxy-3-fluorobenzene (8, R=F, R1= R2=C2H5) starting from expensive 3-fluorocatechol (8, R=F, R1= R2=H) and ethyl iodide utilizing dimethyl formamide as solvent. The disadvantage of this process is that it is expensive, low yielding and involves purification of product by column chromatography.<br>
The novel and inventive feature of the present invention is that it involves a new sequence for producing potential precursors for a wide range of modern pharmaceutical ingredients with high yield and purity, which has never discussed before for small scale or large scale industrial productions.<br>
Objects of the present invention<br>
It is therefore the primary object of this invention to provide an improved and efficient process for the preparation of 3-substituted-l,2-dihydroxybenzene (I), 2-substituted-l, 4-dihydroxybenzene (II) and their symmetric and unsymmetrical O-alkyl, aralkyl, substituted and unsubstituted alkyl or aralkyl derivatives from 2-substituted phenols and an allyl halide.<br><br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a process for the production of the substituted<br>
dihydroxy benzene compounds and their derivatives that is cost effective and doesn't generate a<br>
significant amount of unwanted/ unrecoverable waste or byproduct.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the production of the substituted<br>
dihydroxy benzene compounds and their derivatives in high yields and quality without extensive<br>
purifications, special equipments or extra set-up in industries.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the production of the<br>
substituted dihydroxy benzene compounds and their derivatives for industrial scale up.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide a process for the production of substituted<br>
dihydroxy benzene compounds and their derivatives by providing a safe handling method which<br>
does not use expensive organometallics, troublesome approach towards work up, isolation and<br>
purification of intermediates and products.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention to provide a process for the production of substituted<br>
dihydroxy benzene compounds and their derivatives which does not involve waste disposal<br>
problems.<br>

Detailed description of the of the present invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for producing 3-substituted-1, 2-dihydroxybenzene (I), 2~substituted-l, 4-dihydroxybenzene (II) and their alkyl derivatives and more particularly 3-substituted catechol (8, R1= R2 =H) and its methyl and ethyl derivatives of the following structural formulae, whereby greater yields of the desired products are obtained.<br>
&gt; 11<br>
wherein R represents hydrogen atom or a halogen selected from F or Cl or Br, or NO2, wherein R1 and R2  represent hydrogen or a C1-C4 alkyl, substituted and unsubstituted alkyl, aralkyl, heteroalkyl groups, wherein R1 and R2 are identical or different. The reaction scheme of the present process is as follows:<br><br>
SCHEME<br><br>
i	: Allyl halide, acetone, K2CO35 ~60 °C, 4-5 hrs.<br>
ii	: Heat, N-methyl pyrrolidinone, ~ 195 °C, 5-6 hrs.<br>
iii, vii    : Alkylating agent, Acetone, K2CO3, heat, ~ 60 °C, 5-6 hrs.<br>
iv	: KOH / methanol, heat, 60-70 °C, 24 hrs.<br>
v	: KMnCV Methylenedichloride, Benzyl triethyl ammonium<br>
chloride, 0-5 °C, 1-2 hrs.<br>
vi	: m-Chloroperbenzoic acid/Methylenedichloride, or H2O2/<br>
HCO2H, 35-40 °C, 24 hrs.<br>
The first step of the present invention comprises heating 2-substituted phenol(l) with a suitable basic material in presence of an organic solvent under stirring and dropping a suitable allyl halide in to the reaction vessel over a period of 4-5 hr. The reaction is carried out with in a temperature range of about 25° to 110°C, preferably between about 25° to 80°C and most preferably between about 50° to 70°C. Allyl halides used are allyl chloride, allyl bromide, allyl iodide, and the like in an amount of 1-4 mole % and the preferred halide quantity is 1-2,5 mole %. The basic material includes a basic metal carbonate or hydroxide. For example, basic or alkaline reagents which may be used comprise sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, lithium<br><br>
carbonate, magnesium carbonate, cesium carbonate and the like in an amount of 1-4 mole %. Potassium carbonate is the usually preferred reagent, which is free of water of crystallization and Which has to be brought to a fine particle size by milling, for example in ball mills or pinned-disk mills. Potassium carbonate having fine particle fraction of 85% or smaller than 0.1 mm and 70 % or smaller than 0.05 mm is practically suitable. While the organic solvents used are acetone, methylethylketone, dipropylketone, methylpropylketone, hydrocarbon solvents such as hexanes, heptanes, cyclohexane, and the like in a 2-15 times by volume per mole of phenol compound used. Reaction may be carried out at atmospheric pressure or super atmospheric pressure ranging from about 1 to 50 atmospheres is used for the reaction. Time that is needed for addition of allyl halide into a reaction flask of 2-substituted phenol may be approximately in the range of about Ihr to 4 hrs, preferably addition time is in the range of about 1.5 to 2.5 hrs. After completion of the “eaction, the reaction mass is concentrated, cooled and quenched as such with water. The layers are illowed to separate for about 0.5 to Ihr. The separated organic layer is given water wash and dried )n a suitable drying agent such as anhydrous sodium sulphate, anhydrous magnesium sulphate and he like. The amount of water used for quenching the reaction mass be about 4-15 times based on he weight of the phenol used for the reaction.<br>
Thereafter, the crude ortho substituted allyl phenyl ether (2) which is thus obtained is heated to 180-225 °C quickly in a suitable solvent to effect a Claisen's type rearrangement for a time period of about 2.5 hrs to 12 hrs in an atmosphere of nitrogen, preferably at about 195° to 205°C. The solvents used comprise N-methyl pyrrolidinone, diphenyl ether, decaline, N,N-diethylaniline, and the like and preferably N-methyl pyrrolidinone, since it is easily removed from the product by washing with water. The amount of solvent used is about 0.75 to 4.0 volumes based on the weight of the allyl phenyl ether used for the rearrangement and preferably in the range 1.5 to 2.5 volumes of the solvent. After completion of rearrangement reaction, the reaction mass is cooled and quenched with water. The layers are allowed to separate during a period of about 0.5 to Ihr and the separated organic layer is given brine wash in a volume of 1: 2 ratio based on the weight of starting material used. The aqueous layer is extracted with a suitable halohydrocarbon solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane and the like, in an amount of approximately 1-3 volumes of the solvent based on the weight of the starting material used. Washing the organic extract with water and removing the solvent by distillation may offer about 2-5 % of the additional product, which is added to the main organic layer.<br><br><br>
The thus formed crude 2-allyl-6-substituted phenol (3) and 4~allyl-2-substituted phenol (3a) mixture is alkylated without further purification with an alkylating agent, utilizing a basic material and a solvent. The alkylating agent is selected from the group of methyl and ethyl esters of sulphuric acid, alkyl halides such as methyl iodide, ethyl iodide, ethyl bromide, propyl bromide propyl iodide, isopropyl bromide, butyl bromide and the like, in an amount of about 1 to 10 mole % based on the total weight of the isomeric phenol mixture and considering 1:1 yield ratio from the previous step reaction. The solvents, basic materials employed including their quantities and particle size, temperature of the reaction are the same as mentioned above for allylation of 2-substituted phenols (1). After completion of the reaction, the reaction mass is cooled to about 15-35°C, preferably about 25-30°C, quenched with water in 3-10 volumes based on the weight of the starting material used and the layers are separated. The organic layer is washed with brine or water (5-10 % by volume based on the weight of the starting compound) to remove the adhered inorganics and trace of the used solvent.<br>
The mixture of crude ortho allyl product (4) and para allyl product (4a) is taken to the subsequent isomerization step or separated almost completely by fractional distillation technique. The ideal and most advantageous method is effectively separating the said isomers by distillation and utilizing the distilled allyl products for isomerization separately to form the corresponding propenyl derivatives (5 and 5a) at a temperature of about 50° to 180°C employing alkali metal hydroxides like potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and the like, with a suitable protic solvent selected from methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol and the like. The amount of metal hydroxide used is about 2 to 10 mole % based on the weight of the allyl compound used and the volume of solvent used in millilitres or litres is with respect to the weight of the allyl compound used. This isomerisation is also effected by using metal catalyst such as palladium composited on carbon, rhodium composited on activated alumina or silica, ruthenium composited on silica or alumina, platinum composited on silica, and the like. The reaction time is in the range of about 5 to 45 hrs, preferably 15 to 24 hrs.<br>
If alkali metal hydroxides and alcoholic solvent are employed, after completion of the reaction, the reaction mass is concentrated, cooled to below 40°C; diluted with water, neutralized with dilute (about 10 %) mineral acids such as sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid and the like to pH 5 to 7, preferably to pH 6-6.5. the reaction mass is filtered and extracted with a suitable solvent such as methylene dichloride, chloroform, dichloroethane, toluene, hexanes, heptanes, diethyl ether, isopropyl ether and the like. The solvent is distilled off to recover the desired compound in good<br><br><br>
yield. If only metal catalysts are employed, the catalyst is filtered off after the reaction to obtain the desired propenyl compound in good yield.<br>
The crude propenyl compounds (5 and 5a) thus obtained are oxidized to benzaldehydes (6 and 6a) using oxidants such as potassium permanganate, sodium periodate, potassium periodate, osmium tetroxide, potassium permanganate/SiO2 or acidic alumina mixture and the like; the preferred oxidizing agent is potassium permanganate. Suitable organic solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, water, and the like in about 3 to 50 volumes based on the weight of the propenyl compound used. Phase transfer catalysts like benzyl triethyl ammonium chloride, tetra butyl ammonium bromide, cetrimide, tetra butyl ammonium hydroxide, tri-n-octyl ammonium bromide and the like are also be employed to speed up the oxidation reaction. The temperature of the reaction ranges from 0° to 50°C and the preferred temperature range is 0° to 10°C. The quantity of oxidizing agents employed is in the range of about 0.2 to 10 mole % based on the actual mole % of the propenyl compounds (5 and 5a) used. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mass is treated at about 0° to 35°C with acidic reagents such as dilute (about 2-6 % aqueous) sulfuric acid, dilute hydrochloric acid and the like. Thereafter, reaction mass is filtered to recover the useful inorganic byproduct (MnO2), if potassium permanganate is used for the reaction. If the solvent is an organic solvent, the organic filtrate is distilled off to obtain the desired aldehyde products (6 and 6a). If the reaction solvent is water, the product may be extracted from the aqueous filtrate with one of the solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, water, and the like. Distillation of solvent gives the expected aldehyde products (6 and 6a) in good yield and purity. These aldehyde products thus obtained are subjected to oxidation with organic peroxides such as perbenzoic acid, meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, performic acid, peracetic acid and the like or with an inorganic peroxide like hydrogen peroxide (30 %) in a suitable medium with or without the use of a catalyst to obtain the corresponding alkoxy phenols (7 and 7a) in good yield. Further, these phenolic compounds thus obtained are alkylated in presence of a suitable base, solvent and an alkylating agent. The ratio of phenolic mixture, alkylating agent, base and the ketonic solvent is 1: 1: 1:4. The alkylating agent is selected from the group consisting of dimethyl sulphate, diethyl sulphate, methyl iodide, ethyl iodide, ethyl bromide, substituted and unsubstituted alkyl, aralkyl, and alkyl halides derived from heterocyclic compounds to obtain corresponding dialkoxybenzenes (8 and 8a).<br><br>
The dialkoxybenzenes are dealkylated in the presence of an acid selected from the group<br>
consisting    of   aqueous    hydrobromic    acid,    hydrochloric    acid,    borontribromide    in<br>
dichloromethane or dichloroethane to obtain the targeted products (8, R1=R2=H and 8a,<br>
R1=R2=H) in good yield with high purity.<br>
/Ul of the above-mentioned reactions are monitored by TLC, GC or HPLC methods.<br>

The reaction mass is stirred overnight at room temperature, and the reaction is monitored by TLC. After completion of reaction, the mixture is filtered and the filtrate is concentrated under vacuum to a residue. The intermediate compound thus obtained is dissolved in methanol (1L), KOH (2L, 10 %) is added at about 10°C and the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. Thereafter, methanol is distilled off and the resultant aqueous solution is neutralized with con. HC1 (500 ml), the pH is adjusted to 5-6.5, and filtered. The aqueous layer is extracted with methylenedichloride (2.6 L), and washed with aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (600 ml, 10 %). The solvent is removed by distillation to obtain 2-ethoxy-3-fluorophenol (7, R=F, R1=C2H5) in 248 g (54 % yield) with a GC purity of 98%. Method B:<br>
To a stirred solution of formic acid (98 %, 2,472 g, 53.7 moles) and hydrogen peroxide (30 %, 1,328 g, 39 moles) is added 2-ethoxy-3-fluorobenzaldehyde (6, R=F, R1=C2H5, 496 g, 2.68 moles) in methylenedichloride (1.49 L) at room temperature. The reaction mass is heated to 35° to 40°C for 24 hrs and the reaction is monitored by TLC. After the completion of reaction, the reaction mass is cooled to room temperature and allowed the layers to separate. The methylenedichloride layer is separated and concentrated. To the resulting residue methanol (1L) and 10 % KOH (2 L) are added at about 10°C, and the resulting mixture is stirred at room<br>
i<br>
temperature for 1 hr. The alkali solution is concentrated to remove methanol and neutralized with dilute hydrochloric acid (400 ml) to pH 2-4. The product is extracted from the aqueous layer with methylenedichloride (1.5 L), washed with saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate (500 ml), dried over anhydrous magnesium chloride and distilled to obtain 315 g (68 %yield) of 2-ethoxy-3-fluorophenol (7, R=F, R1=C2H5) with a GC purity of 98 %.
