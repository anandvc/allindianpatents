PROCESS FOR THE RACEMISATION OF ENANTIOMERICALLY ENRICHED<br>
g-AMlNO NITRILES<br>
The invention relates to a process for the racemisation of enantiomerically enriched a-amino nitriies.<br>
Many enantiomerically enriched active ingredients like pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals can be prepared using enantiomerically enriched a-amino nitriies, which are commonly used as a precursor for a-amino acids or derivatives thereof. The preparation of pharmaceuticals or agrochemicals generally involves a process with many consecutive steps. a-Amino nitriies can be converted into a wide variety of compounds, for example a-amino acids, a-amino acid amides, p-amino alcohols, vicinal diamines and protected a-amino aldehydes, and therefore are broadly applicable in the preparation of enantiomerically enriched active ingredients. The preparation of enantiomerically enriched compounds commonly includes a resolution step wherein the undesired enantiomer is left as a byproduct. In such resolutions the theoretical maximum yield with regard to the starting material is 50%. The yield can increase significantly by racemisation and recycling of the undesired enantiomer. Preferably the resolution process is combined with racemisation in situ. Therefore, there exists a need for a racemisation process of a-amino nitriies that is compatible with a large variety of resolution processes.<br>
A process wherein an in situ racemisation of an enantiomerically enriched a-amino nitrile occurs is described in US-A-4683324.<br>
A disadvantage of the process of US-A-4683324 is that a protic solvent has to be used. It is known that a-amino nitriies partly decompose in protic solvents. Therefore, in the process of US-A-4683324 HCN is added in order to suppress decomposition. From EP-A-1050529 it is further known that non polar, (but actually meaning aprotic) solvents stabilize a-amino nitriies with respect to decomposition and prevent racemisation.<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a process for the racemisation of a-amino nitriies wherein a racemisation with less decomposition is achieved, and that can be used in combination with resolutions in the preparation of enantiomerically enriched compounds in high yield and high enantiomeric excess.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by using a Lewis<br><br>
acid catalyst. Lewis acids by definition are able to accept an electron pair from compounds that have a free available electron pair.<br>
Suitable Lewis acid catalysts according to the invention comprise a metal ion M , which is complexed according to the genaral structure<br>
MnXpSqLr<br>
in which n represents an integer larger than or equal to 1, for instance is equal to 1, 2,<br>
3, 4, 5, 6, 7	and p, q and r each independently represent an integer larger than or<br>
equal to 0, for instance 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7	and in which n and p are chosen such<br>
that MnXp is neutral.<br>
The metal M may be in the ionic form (Mk+) with suitable counter ions X, wherein k represents the valence of the metal ion, or in the zero valent form (M°) with p = 0.<br>
Suitable metals are for instance metals chosen from main group elements IA-IVA of the Periodic Table (CAS version), the transition metals and the lanthanides, preferably Al, Ti, Zr, or a lanthanide, for example Sm or La, or combinations thereof.<br>
X represents an anionic counter ion or covalently bound anionic ligand for non zero valent metals. Suitable examples are halides, in particular CI" or Br' ; alkyl groups with e.g. 1-12 C-atoms, for example methyl, ethyl, n-propyl (nPr) or i-butyl (Bu) groups, alkoxy groups with e.g. 1-12 C-atoms, for example n-pentoxy, i-propoxy, t-butoxy groups preferably the alkoxy groups derived from a secondary alcohol; anions derived from amides, aminoalcohols or amines; CN" groups; anionic aromatic ligands, in particular cyclopentadienyl (Cp), pentamethyl cyclopentadienyl (Cp*) or indenyl.<br>
S represents a so-called spectator ligand, a neutral ligand which is difficult to exchange by other ligands, for example aromatic compounds or olefines. Examples of aromatic compounds are aromatic hydrocarbons, for instance benzene, toluene, cumene, cymene or mesitylene. Suitable olefines are for instance dienes, in particular 1,5-cyclooctadiene or 1,5-hexadiene.<br>
L represents a neutral ligand, which can be relatively easy exchanged by other ligands, for example phosphines in particular PPh3 or PCy3, nitriles or coordinating solvent molecules, especially tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetonitrile, dimethylfomamide, alcohols, amines, in particular tertiary amines, for example Et3N.<br>
Catalyst represented by the general structure MnXpSqLr as described above are generally known in the art. As will be understood by the person skilled in the art the distinction between spectator ligand S and neutral ligands L is gradual and<br><br>
amenable to discussion; besides that it may depent on the reaction conditions.<br>
Examples of suitable catalyst are: LiBr, AKO'Prfe, AICI3i Al(alkyl)3, with each alkyl is a C1-C12 alkyl group, AI(Et2)CN, AI(iBu)2H,i AI(CH3)-0-) n. Zr(OtBu)4, Zirconocene, Sm(0'Pr)3(Sm(Cp)3, La(Cp)3. Particularly preferred catalyst are aluminum alkoxides, aluminum alkyls, lanthanide alkoxides, for instance samarium alkoxides, and lanthanocenes, for instance lanthanide tris-cyclopentadienyl compounds.<br>
The racemisation can be carried out in the presence of a solvent. Preferably aprotic solvents are used in the racemisation according to the invention, for instance aliphatic hydrocarbons, for example hexane, heptane; aromatic hydrocarbons, for example toluene and xylene; ethers, for example methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE); esters, for example ethyl acetate; or mixtures thereof. The concentration of the amino nitrile in the reaction mixture preferably is between 0.1 and 2 M.<br>
The temperature for the racemisation preferably will be chosen as high as possible and such that still a sufficiently low level of decomposition is maintained under the reaction conditions. The optimal temperature can be determined by the skilled person and lies for instance between -20 and 120 °C, preferably between 30 and 100 °C.<br>
The racemisation according to the invention can be combined with a separate resolution processes or with an in situ resolution process so that in principle the product can be obtained in 100% yield and 100% ee. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, racemisation is applied in combination with an in situ resolution process.<br>
Examples of resolution processes that can be combined with the racemisation according to the invention are for instance, crystallization induced resolutions (classical resolutions), for instance resolutions via diastereoisomeric salt formation or entrapment, enzymatic resolutions, or resolutions achieved by physical separation methods. Examples of resolution process in combination with an insitu racemisation are, for instance, crystallization induced asymmetric transformations or dynamic kinetic resolutions (DKR). A clear advantage of the racemisation according to the invention is that an aprotic solvent can be chosen. In order to achieve a "100% yield, 100° ee" result as a rule it is better to use aprotic solvents in resolution processes. For instance, aprotic organic solvents show less deactivation of enzymes in enzymatic processes than protic organic solvents. Thus, in combination with an enzymatic resolution (DKR) aprotic solvents are particularly suitable solvents to be<br><br>
used in stereoselective reactions e.g. stereoselective acylation reactions or stereoselective nitrile converting reactions. For asymmetric transformations low solubilities of diastereomeric salts are preferred and can be achieved by aprotic solvents.<br>
In such "100% yield and 100% ee" concepts the racemisation system is chosen such that the racemisation system is compatible with the stereo differentiating process, for instance with the resolving agents or the enzyme used in the resolution. The choice of the optimum reaction conditions will as a rule be a compromise between the optimum resolving or stereo differentiating process conditions and the optimum racemisation conditions. The person skilled in the art will be able to find the optimal conditions for his situation. The temperature range, for instance, mostly will be chosen between 0 and 120 °C, preferably 20 and 110 °C. The concentration of the amino nitrile in the reaction mixture preferably is between 0.1 and 2M.<br>
Examples of amino nitriles that can be racemised according to the invention are for instance amino nitriles with formula (1)<br><br>
wherein * denotes a chiral C-atom, R\ R2, R3 and R4 each independently represent H, an optionally substituted alkyl, aryl, alkaryl or aralkyl group with, for instance 1-20 C-atoms, or R1 and R2 or R1 and R3 or R 3and R4 together with the atom(s) to which they are attached form an optionally substituted 4-8 membered (hetero)cyclic group with for instance 3-20 C-atoms.<br>
The invention will be elucidated by the following examples, without however being limited thereby.<br>
