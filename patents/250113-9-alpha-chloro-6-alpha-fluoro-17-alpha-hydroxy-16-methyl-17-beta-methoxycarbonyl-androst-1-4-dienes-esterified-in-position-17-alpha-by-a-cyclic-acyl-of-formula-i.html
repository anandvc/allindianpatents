In compounds of formula I, the indicated methyl group in the 16 position of the corticosteroid ring system may be in the alpha or beta conformation. 16-ct-methyl compounds are preferred.<br>
Compounds of formula I in which R contains a basic group are capable of forming acid addition salts, particularly pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compound of formula I include those of inorganic acids, for example, hydrohalic acids such as hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid or hydroiodic acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid; and organic acids, for example aliphatic monocarboxylic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid, aliphatic hydroxy acids such as lactic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid or malic acid, dicarboxylic acids such as maleic acid or succinic acid, aromatic carboxylic acids such as benzoic acid, p-chlorobenzoic acid, diphenylacetic acid or triphenylacetic acid, aromatic hydroxy acids such as o-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, l-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acid or 3-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acid, and sulfonic acids such as methanesulfonic acid or benzenesulfonic acid. These salts may be prepared from compounds of formula I by known salt-forming procedures.<br>
Especially preferred compounds of formula I include those hereinafter described in the Examples, particularly those of Examples 3,11,14,17,19,26, 34, 37, 39, 51, 60, 67, 72, 73, 90,99 and 101.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of compounds of formula I which comprises<br>
(A) conversion of a carboxylic acid of formula<br><br><br>
Process variant (A) may be carried out using known procedures for converting a carboxylic acid, or ester-forming functional derivative thereof such as an acid halide thereof, into the corresponding methyl ester. Conveniently, the carboxylic acid is reacted with a methyl ester of a strong acid, preferably dimethyl sulfate, in the presence of an aprotic organic base such as l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). The reaction is usually carried out in an inert organic solvent, for example an amide such as dimethyl formamide, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or a mixture thereof. The reaction temperature is conveniently from ambient temperature to 100°C.<br>
Process variant (B) may be carried out using known hydrochlorination procedures, for example by passing gaseous HCl into a solution of the compound of formula III in an inert<br><br>
organic solvent, for example a hydrocarbon such as toluene. The reaction temperature is conveniently from ambient temperature to 60°C.<br><br>
The acylation may be effected using known procedures, for example by reacting a compound of formula IV with an acid halide of formula RCOX where R is as hereinbefore defined and X is halogen, such as bromine or, preferably, chlorine. The reaction is usually carried out in the presence of a base, preferably a tertiary organic base such as pyridine. The reaction temperature is suitably from ambient to 50°C. The acylation may also be effected by reacting a compound of formula IV with a carboxylic acid of formula RC02H in the presence of an activating agent such as 0-(7-azabenzotriazo-l-lyl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluroniurn hexafluorophosphate (HATU) and a base, preferably a tertiary organic base such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine. The reaction may be carried out in a dipolar aprotic solvent, such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), or a chlorohydrocarbon solvent such as dichloromethane (DCM). The reaction temperature is suitably from ambient to 60°C. Compounds of formula IV may be prepared by hydrochlorination of the corresponding 9,11-epoxy compound, of formula V<br><br><br>
into the methyl ester thereof. This conversion may be carried out using the procedures hereinbefore described for process variant (A). Compounds of formula VI may be prepared by appropriate acylation of the corresponding 17-hydroxy compound of formula V; this acylation may be effected using known procedures, for example as hereinbefore described for acylation of compounds of formula IV.<br>
Compounds of formula I are useful as pharmaceuticals. Accordingly, the invention also provides a compound of formula I for use as a pharmaceutical. The compounds of formula I<br><br>
have important pharmacological properties. For example, they have a high anti¬inflammatory activity, which can be demonstrated by their inhibition of TNF-alpha synthesis and release in a human macrophage cell line and by their inhibition of inflammatory conditions, particularly in the airways, e.g. inhibition of eosinophil activation, in animal models, e.g. mouse or rat models of airways inflammation, for example as described by Szarka et al, J. Immunol. Methods (1997) 202:49-57; Renzi et al, Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. (1993) 148:932-939; Tsuyuki et al., J. Clin. Invest. (1995) 96:2924-2931; and Cernadas et al (1999) Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 20:1-8.<br>
Compounds of formula I exhibit surprisingly low systemic side effects at therapeutically effective doses. Compounds of formula I have a long duration of action, with a potential for once-a-day administration.<br>
Inhibition of TNF-alpha synthesis and release from the human macrophage cell line U937 by compounds of formula I may be demonstrated and measured in an assay as described by Sajjadi et al. J. Immunol. 1996;156:3435-3442. Compounds of Examples 3, 11,14, 17,19, 26, 34, 37, 39, 51, 60, 67, 72, 73, 90, 99 and 101 have IC50 (nM) values of 0.035, 0.025, 0.100, 0.05, 0.046,0.024, 0.10, 0.102, 0.101, 0.048, 0.048, 0.048, 0.102, 0.159,0.076, 0.106 and 0.208 respectively in this assay.<br>
In vivo anti-inflammatory activity may be assessed by inhibition of lung eosinophilia in rats using a modification of the method of Szarka et al op cit. Male Brown Norway rats (approximately 200g) are sensitised on day 1 with an intraperitonial injection of 0.5 ml of a mixture of ovalbumin (0.02mg/ml) and aluminium hydroxide (20mg/ml), followed by Acellulare pertussis adsorbat vaccine (0.2ml of a 1:4 dilution with 0.9% saline). The procedure is repeated on day 15 and day 21. On day 28 the test compound is administered intratracheally as a dry powder lactose blend under isoflurane anaesthesia. 24 hours later the sensitised dosed rats are exposed to an aerosol of ovalbumin (5mg/ml) for 60 minutes and after a further 24 hours they are sacrificed. The lungs are removed and after lavage with Hank's solution (balanced salt solution, 100ml; EDTA lOOmM, 100ml; HEPES 1M, 10ml, water 1000ml), eosinophil numbers in the recovered solution are quantified directly using a Corbas Helios 5Diff apparatus (Hoffman-LaRoche).<br>
Compounds of Examples 14,17,26, 34, 37, 39,51, 60, 73,99 and 101 exhibit a reduction in eosinophil count compared to vehicle control of 65, 71, 63,90,61, 76, 69, 67,43,48 and<br><br>
40 % respectively in this assay. Examples 14, 26, 34 and 99 are dosed at 3mg/kg, with the remainder at lmg/kg.<br>
Systemic side effects may be assessed by reduction in thymus weight on chronic administration to rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (approximately 250g) are treated once daily for 4 days with the test compound administered at a dose of lmg/kg either orally as a hydroxypropyl cellulose suspension or intratracheally under isoflurane anaesthesia as a dry-powder lactose blend. On day 5 the rats are sacrificed, autopsy is performed and the weight of the thymus is determined. Compounds of Examples 17, 26, 34, 37, 73,99 and 101 exhibit a reduction in thymus weight compared to vehicle control when dosed orally of 20,2, 0,19, 9, 0 and 2 % respectively in this assay. Compounds of Examples 17, 26, 73 and 99 exhibit a reduction in thymus weight compared to vehicle control when dosed intratracheally of 78, 55, 31 and 70 % respectively in this assay.<br>
Having regard to their anti-inflammatory activity, compounds of formula I are useful in the treatment of inflammatory conditions, particularly inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases. Treatment in accordance with the invention may be symptomatic or prophylactic.<br>
Inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include asthma of whatever type or genesis including both intrinsic (non-allergic) asthma and extrinsic (allergic) asthma, mild asthma, moderate asthma, severe asthma, bronchitic asthma, exercise-induced asthma, occupational asthma and asthma induced following bacterial infection. Treatment of asthma is also to be understood as embracing treatment of subjects, e.g. of less than 4 or 5 years of age, exhibiting wheezing symptoms and diagnosed or diagnosable as "wheezy infants", an established patient category of major medical concern and now often identified as incipient or early-phase asthmatics. (For convenience this particular asthmatic condition is referred to as "wheezy-infant syndrome".)<br>
Prophylactic efficacy in the treatment of asthma will be evidenced by reduced frequency or severity of symptomatic attack, e.g. of acute asthmatic or bronchoconstrictor attack, improvement in lung function or improved airways hyperreactivity. It may further be evidenced by reduced requirement for other, symptomatic therapy, i.e. therapy for or intended to restrict or abort symptomatic attack when it occurs, for example anti¬inflammatory (e.g. corticosteroid) or bronchodilatory. Prophylactic benefit in asthma may in particular be apparent in subjects prone to "morning dipping". "Morning dipping" is a<br><br>
recognised asthmatic syndrome, common to a substantial percentage of asthmatics and characterised by asthma attack, e.g. between the hours of about 4 to 6 am, i.e. at a time normally substantially distant form any previously administered symptomatic asthma therapy.<br>
Other inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases and conditions to which the present invention is applicable include acute lung injury (ALI), adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary, airways or lung disease (COPD, CO AD or COLD), including chronic bronchitis or dyspnea associated therewith, emphysema, as well as exacerbation of airways hyperreactivity consequent to other drug therapy, in particular other inhaled drug therapy. The invention is also applicable to the treatment of bronchitis of whatever type or genesis including, e.g., acute, arachidic, catarrhal, croupus, chronic or phthinoid bronchitis. Further inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include pneumoconiosis (an inflammatory, commonly occupational, disease of the lungs, frequently accompanied by airways obstruction, whether chronic or acute, and occasioned by repeated inhalation of dusts) of whatever type or genesis, including, for example, aluminosis, anthracosis, asbestosis, chalcosis, ptilosis, siderosis, silicosis, tabacosis and byssinosis.<br>
Having regard to their anti-inflammatory activity, in particular in relation to inhibition of eosinophil activation, compounds of formula I are also useful in the treatment of eosinophil related disorders, e.g. eosinophilia, in particular eosinophil related disorders of the airways (e.g. involving morbid eosinophilic infiltration of pulmonary tissues) including hypereosinophilia as it effects the airways and/or lungs as well as, for example, eosinophil-related disorders of the airways consequential or concomitant to Loffler's syndrome, eosinophilic pneumonia, parasitic (in particular metazoan) infestation (including tropical eosinophilia), bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, polyarteritis nodosa (including Churg-Strauss syndrome), eosinophilic granuloma and eosinophil-related disorders affecting the airways occasioned by drug-reaction.<br>
Compounds of formula I are also useful in the treatment of inflammatory conditions of the skin, for example psoriasis, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata, erythema multiforma, dermatitis herpetiformis, scleroderma, vitiligo, hypersensitivity angiitis, urticaria, bullous pemphigoid, lupus erythematosus, pemphisus, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and other inflammatory conditions of the skin.<br><br>
Compounds of formula I may also be used for the treatment of other diseases or conditions, in particular diseases or conditions having an inflammatory component, for example, treatment of diseases and conditions of the eye such as conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and vernal conjunctivitis, diseases affecting the nose including allergic rhinitis, diseases of the joints such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.<br>
Compounds of formula I are also useful as co-therapeutic agents for use in conjunction with other drug substances for treatment of airways diseases, particularly bronchodilatory or anti¬inflammatory drug substances, particularly in the treatment of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases such as those mentioned hereinbefore, for example as potentiators of therapeutic activity of such drugs or as a means of reducing required dosaging or potential side effects of such drugs. A compound of formula I may be mixed with the other drug in a fixed pharmaceutical composition or it may be administered separately, before, simultaneously with or after the other drug. Such other drugs include anticholinergic or antimuscarinic agents, in particular ipratropium bromide, oxitropium bromide and tiotropium bromide, LTB4 antagonists such as those described in US5451700, LTD4 antagonists such as montelukast and zafirlukast, dopamine receptor agonists such as cabergoline, bromocriptine, ropinirole and 4-hydroxy-7-[2-[[2-[[3-(2-phenylethoxy)propyl]sulfonyl]ethyl]amino]ethyl]-2(3H)-benzothiazoloneand pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof (the hydrochloride being Viozan® - AstraZeneca), PDE4 inhibitors such as Ariflo®(GlaxoSmith Kline), Roflumilast(Byk Gulden),V-11294A(Napp), BAY 19-8004(Bayer), SCH-351591(Schering-Plough), and PD189659(Parke-Davis) and beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists such as salbutamol, terbutaline, salmeterol and, especially, formoterol and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and compounds (in free or salt or solvate form) of formula I of PCT International Publication No. WOOO/75114, which document is incorporated herein by reference, preferably compounds of the Examples thereof, especially a compound of formula<br><br>
o<br>
1'<br>
OH in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate form.<br>
Combinations of compounds of formula I and beta-2 agonists, PDE4 inhibitors or LTD4 antagonists may be used, for example, in the treatment of COPD or, particularly, asthma. Combinations of agents of the invention and anticholinergic or antimuscarinic agents, PDE4 inhibitors, LTB4 antagonists or dopamine agonists may be used, for example, in the treatment of asthma or, particularly, COPD.<br>
In accordance with the foregoing, the invention also provides a method for the treatment of an inflammatory condition, particularly an inflammatory or obstructive airways disease, which comprises administering to a subject, particularly a human subject, in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of formula I as hereinbefore described. In another aspect the invention provides the use of a compound of formula I as hereinbefore described for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of an inflammatory condition, particularly an inflammatory or obstructive airways disease.<br>
The compounds of formula I may be administered by any appropriate route, e.g. orally, for example in the form of a tablet or capsule; parenterally, for example intravenously; by inhalation, for example in the treatment of inflammatory or obstructive airways disease; intranasally, for example in the treatment of allergic rhinitis; topically to the skin, for example in the treatment of atopic dermatitis; or rectally, for example in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising as active ingredient a compound of formula I, optionally together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier therefor. The composition may contain a co-therapeutic agent such as a bronchodilatory or anti-inflammatory drug as hereinbefore described. Such compositions may be prepared using conventional diluents or excipients and techniques<br><br>
known in the galenic art. Thus oral dosage forms may include tablets and capsules. Formulations for topical administration may take the form of creams, ointments, gels or transdermal delivery systems, e.g. patches. Compositions for inhalation may comprise aerosol or other atomizable formulations or dry powder formulations.<br>
The invention includes (A) a compound of formula I in inhalable form, e.g. in an aerosol or other atomisable composition or in inhalable particulate, e.g. micronised, form, (B) an inhalable medicament comprising a compound of formula I in inhalable form; (C) a pharmaceutical product comprising a compound of formula I in inhalable form in association with an inhalation device; and (D) an inhalation device containing a compound of formula I in inhalable form.<br>
Dosages of compounds of formula I employed in practising the present invention will of course vary depending, for example, on the particular condition to be treated, the effect desired and the mode of administration. In general, suitable daily dosages for administration by inhalation are of the order of 0.005 to 10 mg, while for oral administration suitable daily doses are of the order of 0.05 to 100 mg.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following Examples.<br>
