form the cell on an integrated circuit chip. By reducing the size of the SRAM cell, a higher density -SRAM can be fabricated. Although many techniques have been successfully employed to provide higher density SRAMs, the demand for higher and higher density SRAMs continues unabated. Accordingly, there is a continuous need to produce ever smaller SRAM cells.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0023]	The present invention addresses the above-mentioned problems, as well as<br>
others, by providing an inverted FinFET thin film transistor, and a static random access<br>
memory (SRAM) cell that is formed using inverted FinFET thin film transistors.<br>
[0024]	A cross-sectional view of a conventional FinFET thin film transistor 10 is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1. A plan view of the FinFET transistor 10 is illustrated in FIG. 2. In this<br>
example, the FinFET transistor 10 is formed on an insulating layer 12 (e.g., a layer of Si02).<br>
The FinFET transistor 10 comprises a fin 14. typically formed of silicon or other suitable<br>
semiconductor material, and a gate 16, formed of polysilicon or other suitable conductive<br>
material, running over the fin 14. A channel 18 is formed in the portion of the fin 14 that<br>
extends under the gate 16. As shown in FIG. 2, the source 20 and drain 22 of the FinFET<br>
transistor 10 are located at opposing ends of the fin 14. The benefits provided by such a<br>
FinFET transistor 10 include, for example, smaller size, reduced power consumption, and<br>
faster switching times due to the "double gate" structure surrounding the channel 18.<br>
[0025]	A cross-sectional view of an inverted FinFET thin film transistor 30 in<br>
accordance with the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 3. A plan view "of the inverted<br>
FinFET transistor 30 is illustrated in FIG. 4. As shown, in the inverted FinFET transistor 30,<br>
a fin 32, typically formed of silicon or other suitable semiconductor material, acts as the gate<br>
34 of the transistor, rather than as the body, source and drain, as would be the case for a<br>
typical FinFET transistor (e.g., see FIGS. 1-2). A layer 36, formed of polysilicon or other<br>
suitable semi-conductive material, crosses the fin 32 and forms the channel 38, source 40, and<br>
drain 42 of the inverted FinFET 30 transistor, rather than the gate, as would be the case for a<br>
typical FinFET transistor (e.g., see FIGS. 1-2). Other semiconductor and conductive<br>
materials, known to one skilled in the art, may be used to form the fin 32 and layer 36.<br>
[0026]	A more detailed view of a p-channel inverted FinFET transistor 50 in<br>
accordance of the present invention is shown in FIG. 5. In this example, the p-channel inverted FinFET transistor 50 includes an n+ doped silicon fin 52 that acts as the gate 54 of the transistor 50. The gate 54 is covered by a layer 56 of a gate insulator (e.g., Si02). A layer 58 of polysilicon crosses the fin 52 and forms the body region 60 of the transistor 50. The body region 60 includes a p+ doped source 62, p+ doped drain 64, and channel 72 of the<br><br>
V<br>
transistor 50. The channel 72 includes lightly p doped areas on either side of the gate 54 and below spacers 68, which are formed on the sides of the transistor 50. and may comprise, for example, Si02, Si3N4. etc. The p+ doped source 62 and drain 64. and a p+ doped region 70 of the body region 60 located over the gate 54. supply the channel 72 with p-type carriers. As will be presented in greater detail below, the p-channel inverted FinFET transistor 50. the operation of which may be slightly degraded because of the polycrystalline silicon which comprises channel 72, is useful as the pull-up device in a SRAM cell. The use of such a p-channel inverted FinFET transistor 50, along with the fin underpass 80 described below7 with regard to FIG. 6, significantly reduces the layout (i.e., surface) area of a SRAM cell compared to a SRAM-cell designed using conventional CMOS techniques.<br>
[0027]	As illustrated in FIG. 6, the fin underpass 80 has a structure similar to that<br>
of the p-channel inverted FinFET transistor 50 described above. For example, the fin underpass 80 includes an n+ doped silicon fin 82 that is covered by an insulating layer 84 of a gate insulator such as Si02. Unlike the p-channel inverted FinFET transistor 50. however, the layer of polysilicon 86 running over the fin 82 is n+ doped. As such, the n+ doped polysilicon layer 86 passes over, and is insulated from, the n+ doped fin 82 by the insulating layer 84.<br>
[0028]	A schematic diagram of a conventional six-transistor SRAM cell 90 is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 7.   As known in the art, the SRAM cell 90 includes a pair of cross-coupled inverters 92, 94 to store a data bit state, and a pair of n-channel coupling transistors Nl, N2 to read and write a data bit between the cross-coupled inverters 92, 94 and the bitlines BL, BL (BAR). The inverter 92 includes a p-channel pull-up transistor PI and a n-channel pull-down transistor N3. Similarly, the inverter 94 includes a p-channel pull-up transistor P2 and a n-channel pull-down transistor N4. The operation of such a SRAM cell 90 is well known and will not be presented in detail. When such a six-transistor SRAM cell is produced, for example, using an industry standard lOOnm node (see, e.g., Brighten et al, "Integration of High Performance, Low Leakage and Mixed Signal Features into a 100 nm CMOS Technology," 2002 Symposium on VLSI Technology, Digest of Technical papers P62-3, June 2002),-the resultant standard SRAIvf cell size is approximately 126/xm2. By using the processes of the present invention, however, a SRAM cell can be produced that is<br><br>
approximately 65% of the size of a standard SRAM cell produced using an industry standard 100 nm node.<br>
[0029]	The formation of the transistors P2, Nl, and N3 (FIG. 7). using a p-channel<br>
inverted FinFET transistor in accordance with the present invention, and two n-channel FinFET transistors, respectively, is illustrated in FIG. 8. The process flow for forming the inverted FinFET transistor and FinFET transistor, as well as a fin underpass and a fin-based buried contact, will be presented in detail below.<br>
[0030]	As shown in FIG. 8, silicon fins 100, 102 are formed in the same process step<br>
on a substrate. The silicon fins 100, 102 may comprise separate fins, or may comprise<br>
different portions of the same fin. A layer 104 of polysilicon extends between, and passes    '<br>
over the sides and tops of, the fins 100 and 102. A layer 106 of polysilicon, formed in the<br>
same process step as the layer 104 of polysilicon, passes over the sides and top of the fin 100.<br>
[0031]	To form the p-channel inverted FinFET transistor P2, a portion of the silicon<br>
fin 100 is n+ doped to produce the gate 108 of P2, while a portion of the layer 104 of<br>
polysilicon is p+ doped to form a body region including the source 110, channel 112, and<br>
drain 114 of P2. The channel 112 of P2 passes over the gate 108. The source 110 and drain<br>
114 of P2 are located on either side of the gate 108 and are connected by the channel 112.<br>
[0032]	The body region of the n-channel FinFET transistor N3, including the source<br>
116, channel 118, and drain 120, is formed using a lightly doped portion of the fin 102. The gate 122 of N3 is formed using a n+ doped portion of the polysilicon layer 104. Thus, the polysilicon layer 104 is used to form the gate 122 of N3 and the source 110, channel 112. and drain 114 of P2. Further, the polysilicon layer 104 connects the gate 122 of N3 to the drain 114 of P2. A self-aligned metal silicide (not shown), such as CoSi2, can be used to bridge the n+ to p+ junction in the polysilicon layer 104 to ensure good electrical conductivity from gate 122 to drain 114.<br>
[0033]	The body region of the n-channel FinFET transistor Nl, including the drain<br>
124, channel 126, and source 128, is formed using a lightly doped portion of the fin 100. The<br>
gate 129 of Nl is formed using a n+ doped portion of the layer 106 of polysilicon. Thus, the<br>
fin 100 is used to form the gate 108 of P2 and the drain 124, channel 126, and source 128 of<br>
Nl. Further, the fin 100 connects the gate 108 of P2 to the drain 124 of Nl.<br>
[0034]	A six-transistor SRAM cell 130 formed in accordance with the present<br><br>
invention is illustrated in FIG. 9. The SRAM cell 130 operates in a convention manner. The<br>
SRAM cell 130 is formed using two p-channel inverted FinFET transistors PI, P2. four n-<br>
channel FinFET transistors Nl, N2, N3, and N4, two fin underpasses UP1, UP2. and five fin-<br>
based buried contacts BCL BC2, BC3. BC4. and BC5.   In the SRAM cell 130, the underpass<br>
UP1 allows the conductive path between the drain of Nl and BC1 to insulatively pass under<br>
the conductive path between BC3 and BC5. Similarly, the underpass UP2 allows the<br>
conductive path between BC5 and BC2 to insulatively pass under the conductive path<br>
between BC1 and BC4. By using this unique combination of structures, the layout of the<br>
SRAM cell 130 is simplified, and the size of the SRAM cell 130 is significantly reduced<br>
compared to a standard SRAM cell with similar minimum feature sizes produced using<br>
known techniques. Before presenting the layout of the SRAM cell 130 of the present<br>
invention, an exemplary process flow for producing a p-channel inverted FinFET transistor,<br>
n-channel FinFET transistor, fin underpass, and fin-based buried contact in accordance with<br>
the present invention will be described with regard to FIGS. 10-26.<br>
[0035]	In the following exemplary description of the process flow for producing a<br>
p-channel inverted FinFET transistor, n-channel FinFET transistor, fin underpass, and fin-<br>
based buried contact, numerous masking, patterning, etching, stripping, growing, depositing,<br>
and implanting steps are described in general terms. It should be noted that although the*-<br>
specific details required to perform these steps have been omitted for brevity and clarity,<br>
these details are nonetheless well known to those skilled in the art of semiconducting<br>
processing. It should also be noted that alternate materials known to those skilled in the art<br>
may exist for each of the materials used in the formation of the p-channel inverted FinFET<br>
transistor, n-channel FinFET transistor, fin underpass, and fin-based buried contact. Further,<br>
although described below for use in a SRAM cell, the p-channel inverted FinFET transistor,<br>
n-channel FinFET transistor, fin underpass, and fin-based buried contact may also be used<br>
individually or in other combinations in other semiconductor devices. The doping of these<br>
structure may also vary. For example, a n-channel inverted FinFET transistor may be formed<br>
by using p-type doping in place of n-type doping and vice-versa.<br>
[0036]	Initially, as shown in FIG. 10, a layer 142 of Si02 and a masking layer 144 of<br><br>
Si3N4 are formed on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer 140. The SOI wafer 140 comprises a silicon substrate 146. a buried oxide (BOX) layer 148. and a layer of silicon 150 approximately 30nm to 170nm thick.   The Si3N4 layer is patterned and etched to provide Si3N4 shapes 152 that are approximately 5nm to 30nm wide.<br>
[0037]	Using the Si3N4 shapes 152 as a mask, the Si02 layer 142 is patterned and<br>
etched to form Si02 shapes 154 as shown in FIG. 11. The Si02 layer 142 is first etched using an anisotropic etch. This is followed by an isotropic oxide etch to adjust the final width of the Si02 shapes 154.<br>
[0038]	In FIG. 12, after stripping the Si3N4 shapes 152, the SiO: shapes 154 are used<br>
as a mask during an anisotropic etch of the silicon layer 150. The etching stops at the surface of the BOX layer 148. The resultant silicon fins 156A, 156B, 156C. and 156D. having a width of approximately lnm to 30nm, are used to form the fin portions of a p-channel inverted FinFET transistor (P-IFinFET), a fin underpass (UP), a n-channel FinFET transistor (FinFET) and a fin-based buried contact (BC). A layer 158 of sacrificial SiO:. approximately 1.5nm to 6nm thick, is then grown on the sides of the silicon fins 156A-D. The layer 158 of " sacrificial Si02 protects the silicon fins 156A prior to, and during, a subsequent implantation step.<br>
[0039]	A photoresist mask layer 160 is then applied and patterned to selectively<br>
expose the fins 156A, 156B, and 156D as illustrated in FIG. 13. The fin 156C remains covered by the mask layer 160. An n-type dopant 161, such as phosphorus or arsenic, is then implanted via ion implantation into the exposed fins 156A, 156B, and 156D. The fin 156C remains undoped because of the remaining mask layer 160.   After implantation, the remaining mask layer 160 and the sacrificial Si02 layer 158 are stripped away. A layer 162 of gate insulator, such as Si02 is then grown/deposited on the fins 156A, 156B, 156C, and 156D as illustrated in FIG. 14. A layer 164 of undoped polysilicon is then deposited to a thickness of approximately lOnm to 75nm. The thickness of the undoped polysilicon layer 164 is less than the combined thicknesses of the silicon layer 150 and the Si02 layer 142 (FIG. 10). A layer 166 of a spacer material, such as Si02? approximately 5nm to 75nm thick, is then deposited on the undoped polysilicon layer 164. As illustrated in FIG. 15, the spacer layer 166 is then anisotropically etched to form sidewall spacers 168 on the undoped polysilicon<br><br>
layer 164. At this point in the process, the fins 156A, 156B, and 156D are n+ doped, while the fin 156C is undoped.<br>
[0040]	In FIG. 16, a photoresist mask layer 170 is applied and patterned to selectively<br>
mask off the P-IFinFET region around the fin 156A where the p-channel inverted FinFET<br>
transistor is to be formed. The exposed sidevvall spacers 168 next to the fins 156B. 156C, and<br>
156D are then isotropically etched away. Thereafter, as shown in FIG. 17, all regions except<br>
for the BC region are selectively masked off with a BC photoresist mask 172. The<br>
polysilicon layer 164 in the exposed BC region is then etched away and the exposed layer 162<br>
of gate oxide on the sides of the fin 156D is stripped away. After the mask 172 has been<br>
stripped away, a thin film 174 of undoped polysilicon is deposited as shown in FIG. 18. The<br>
polysilicon layer 174 is selectively etched back with a mask (not shown) selectively covering<br>
the other structures until the sidewall spacers 168 next to the fin 156A are exposed.<br>
[0041]	The next step in the process is illustrated in FIG. 19. In particular, a<br>
photoresist mask layer 176 is deposited and patterned to cover the P-IFinFET, UP, FinFET<br>
and BC regions. The unmasked areas of the polysilicon layers 164, 174 are then etched away.<br>
The mask layer 176 is then stripped away as shown in FIG. 20. A top view corresponding to<br>
