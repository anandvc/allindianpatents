CONTROL COMMANDS DURING SOFT-HANDOFF"<br><br>
APPLICANT<br><br><br>
QUALCOMM INCORPORATED,<br>
a Delaware Corporation of 5775 Morehouse Drive,<br>
San Diego, California 92121-1714, USA.<br>
the following specification particularly describes<br>
the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
I1002J The present invention relates generally to communication, and more<br>
specifically to techniques for detennining the reliability of transmit power control<br>
(TPC) commands received in a wireless communication system and for combining<br>
received TPC commands in soft handover.<br>
Background<br>
[1003] In a wireless communication system, a terminal (e.g., a cellular phone)<br>
communicates with one or more base stations via transmissions on the downlink and<br>
uplink. The downlink (i.e., forward link) refers to the communication link from the<br>
base stations to the terminal, and the uplink (i.e., reverse link) refers to the<br>
communication link from the terminal to the base stations. The downlink and uplink are<br>
typically allocated different frequency bands.<br>
[1004] In a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system, each base station may<br>
receive uplink transmissions from multiple terminals. Since these uplink fransmissions<br>
occur over a shared frequency band, the transmission from each terminal acts as<br>
interference to the transmissions from other terminals. For each terminal, the<br>
interference due to other terminals degrades this terminal's received signal quahty. (For<br>
simplicity, signal quahty is quantified by a signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) in Ae<br>
following description.) Each terminal needs to maintain a particular SIR in order to<br>
achieve the desired level of performance, which maybe quantified by a particular frame<br><br>
error rate (FER), packet error rate (PER), block error rate (BLER), or bit error rate<br>
(BER).<br>
[1005] To maximize uplink capacity, an uplink power control mechanism is<br>
typically used to control the transmit power of each terminal. Conventionally, this<br>
power control mechanism includes an "inner" loop and an "outer" loop. The inner loop<br>
adjusts the transmit power of the tenninal such that its received SIR, as measured at the<br>
base station, is maintained at a target SIR. This target SIR is often referred to as the<br>
"setpoint". The outer loop adjusts tlie target SIR to maintain the desired level of<br>
performance, which may be, for example, 1% BLER. The uplink power control<br>
mechanism thus attempts to reduce power consumption and interference while<br>
maintaining the desired link performance for the tenninal.<br>
[1006] Many CDMA systems support soft handover (i.e., soft handoff) on the<br>
uplink. Soft handover on the uplink refers to the reception of an uplink transmission<br>
from a tenninal by multiple base stations. Soft handover provides diversity against<br>
deleterious path effects, such as fading and multipaths, since multiple base stations at<br>
different locations are used to receive the uplink transmission. Soft handover may<br>
provide unproved reliability for the uplink transmission fi'om the terminal.<br>
[1007] While a tenninal is in soft handover on the uplink with multiple base<br>
stations, an iimer loop is typically maintained by each of these base stations to adjust the<br>
terminal's transmit power. Conventionally, each base station determines the received<br>
SIR for the uplink transmission, generates TPC commands based on the received SIR<br>
and the target SIR, and transmits the TPC commands to the tenninal. Each TPC<br>
command is either (1) an UP command to direct the terminal to increase its transmit<br>
power or (2) a DOWN command to direct the terminal to decrease its transmit power.<br>
Each base station independently generates TPC commands for the tenninal based on the<br>
received SIR measured at that base station for the uplink transmission from the terminal.<br>
[1008] While in soft handover, the terminal receives TPC commands from multiple<br>
base stations and determines whether each received TPC command is an UP command<br>
or a DOWN command. The terminal then conventionally applies the "OR-of-the-<br>
DOWN" rule for the TPC commands received from multiple base stations. For each<br>
power control period, this rule requires the terminal to decrease its transmit power if any<br>
one of the received TPC commands is determined to be a DOWN command.<br><br>
[1009] The OR-of-the-DOWN rule works well if the terminal can reUably receive<br>
the TPC commands from all base stations. If the TPC commands from any base station<br>
are unreliably received, then the transmit power of the terminal will be biased<br>
downward or low. This is because UP commands sent by an unreliably received base<br>
station may be erroneously detected as DOWN commands by the terminal. This would<br>
then cause tlie terminal to decrease its transmit power regardless of the TPC commands<br>
received from more reliable base stations. The downward bias in transmit power can<br>
result in degraded performance (e.g., a higher BLER) for the terminal. In extreme<br>
instances, the downward bias can lead to a loss of the terminal's signal at the base<br>
stations.<br>
[1010] Since the downward bias and higher BLER are undesirable, a requirement is<br>
often imposed such that only TPC commands received with sufficient reliability are<br>
combined by the OR-of-the-DOWN rule. Conventionally, the rehability of the received<br>
TPC commands for each base station is determined based on a pilot received from that<br>
base station. Each base station transmits its pilot at a fixed power level. If the received<br>
pilot strength (i.e., received pilot power) for a base station exceeds a pilot threshold,<br>
then that base station is considered to be received reliably and its TPC commands are<br>
combined by the OR-of-the-DOWN rule.<br>
[1011] The use of received pilot strength to determine the rehability of received<br>
TPC commands is sub-optimal for several reasons. First, different transmit power<br>
levels may be used for the pilot and the TPC commands. The pilot is transmitted at a<br>
fixed power level while the TPC commands are transmitted at a power level determined<br>
by a downlink power control mechanism. If the TPC commands are transmitted at a<br>
low power level relative to the power level of the pilot, then the TPC commands may be<br>
unrehably received even if the pilot is strongly received. Second, if power balancing is<br>
not apphed while in soft handover, then the ratio of TPC command power to pilot power<br>
may differ widely for different base stations. In this case, even if the received pilot<br>
strengths are the same for all base stations, the TPC commands will be received at<br>
different powers for different base stations. Thus, in certain circumstances, the<br>
rehability of the received TPC commands cannot be accurately determined based on the<br>
received pilot strength.<br><br>
[1012] There is therefore a need in the art for techniques to more accurately<br>
determine the reliability of received TPC commands and to combine these received TPC<br>
commands in soft handover.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[1013] Techniques for determining the reliability of TPC commands received from<br>
a transmitter (e.g., a base station) in a wireless communication system are provided<br>
herein. A received TPC command is considered reliable if its absolute value exceeds a<br>
TPC target value. The TPC target value may be derived based on a TPC threshold and<br>
possibly one or more scaling factors. The TPC threshold may be a function of various<br>
quantities (e.g., SIR, EJI^, EJN,, and so on) for one or more transmissions (e.g.,<br>
TPC, pilot, and so on) received from the transmitter. (EJN, is an energy-per-chip-to-<br>
total-noise-and-interference ratio, and EJI^ is an energy-per-chip-to-total-incoming-<br>
signal ratio.) The TPC threshold may be selected to trade off between false alarm and<br>
missed detection for the received TPC command. Depending on the implementation of<br>
the receiver, the TPC target value may also be derived based on a weight (e.g., a<br>
weighted N, //â estimate) so that the received TPC command can be compared directly<br>
against TPC target value. The TPC threshold and TPC target value and their derivation<br>
are described in detail below.<br>
[1014] Each received TPC command is compared against the TPC target value to<br>
obtain a detected TPC command. Each detected TPC command may be a DOWN<br>
command, an UP command, or a "rejected" command. A detected TPC command is a<br>
rejected command if the received TPC command is considered to be unreKable, which<br>
may be the case if the absolute value of the received TPC command is less than the TPC<br>
target value. Rejected commands are not used for power control. Multiple TPC target<br>
values may be derived with multiple scaling factors, as also described below. One TPC<br>
target value may be used to determine whether the received TPC commands are UP<br>
commands, and another TPC target value may be used to determine whether the<br>
received TPC commands are DOWN commands.<br>
[1015] Techniques for combining TPC commands received from multiple<br>
transmitters (e.g., base stations) in a wireless communication system are also provided<br>
herein. For a receiver (e.g., a terminal) in soft handover and receiving TPC commands<br>
from multiple transmitters, a different TPC target value may be determined for each<br><br>
transmitter. The received TPC commands for each transmitter are compared against the<br>
TPC target value for that transmitter to obtain detected TPC commands. The detected<br>
TPC commands for received TPC commands deemed as unrehable are discarded and<br>
not used for power control. The detected TPC commands for the multiple transmitters<br>
are combined to provide TPC decisions. For each power control period, the OR-of-the-<br>
DOWN rule may be applied to the detected TPC commands to obtain a TPC decision<br>
for that power control period. The TPC decision is (1) a DOWN command if any one of<br>
the detected TPC commands is a DOWN command, (2) a rejected command if all<br>
detected TPC commands are rejected commands, or (3) an UP command otherwise.<br>
[1016] The techniques described herein may be used for any closed-loop power-<br>
controlled wireless communication system that sends TPC commands to control<br>
transmit power (e.g., CDMA systems). These techniques may be used for both the<br>
downlink and the uplink. Various aspects and embodiments of the invention are<br>
described in further detail below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[1027] The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an example,<br>
instance, or illustration." Any embodiment or design described herein as "exemplary"<br>
is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments<br>
or designs.<br>
[1028] FIG. 1 shows a portion of a wireless communication system 100. For<br>
simplicity, only thoree base stations 110a, 110b, and 110c and one terminal 120 are<br>
shown in FIG. 1. A base station is a fixed station used for communicating with the<br>
terminals, and may also be referred to as a Node B, a base transceiver system (BTS), an<br>
access point, or some other terminology. A terminal may be fixed or mobile, and may<br>
also be referred to as a user equipment (UE), a mobile station, a remote station, an<br>
access terminal, or some other terminology.<br>
[1029] A terminal may communicate with one or multiple base stations on the<br>
downlink and/or uplink at any given moment. This depends on whether or not the<br>
terminal is active, whether or not soft handover is supported, and whether or not the<br>
terminal is in soft handover, hi FIG. 1, terminal 120 is in soft handover on the uplink,<br>
and its uplink transmission is received by all three base stations 110a, 110b, and 110c.<br>
Terminal 120 also receives TPC commands firom all three base stations while in soft<br>
handover. These three base stations are included in an "active set" of the terminal.<br>
[1030] A radio network controller (RNC) 130 couples to base stations 110a, 110b,<br>
and 110c and may further couple to other network entities. RNC 130 provides<br>
coordination and control for the base stations coupled to it. RNC 130 may also be<br>
referred to as abase station controller (BSC), a mobile switching center (MSC), or some<br>
other terminology.<br>
[1031] The techniques described herein for determining the reliability of received<br>
TPC commands and for combining received TPC commands in soft handover may be<br>
implemented in various wireless communication systems. System 100 may thus be a<br>
CDMA system, a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) system, a Frequency<br>
Division Multiple Access (FDMA) system, or some other type of system. A CDMA<br>
system may implement one or more standards such as W-CDMA, IS-95, IS-2000, and<br>
IS-856. A TDMA system may implement one or more standards such as Global System<br>
for Mobile Communications (GSM). These standards are well known in the art. The<br><br>
techniques described herein may also be used for downlink as well as uplink power<br>
control. For clarity, these techniques are specifically described for uplink power control<br>
in an exemplary system, which is a CDMA system that implements W-CDMA (i.e., a<br>
W-CDMA system).<br>
[1032] W-CDMA defines a channel structure capable of supporting multiple users<br>
concurrently and efficiently transmitting various types of data. In W-CDMA, data to be<br>
transmitted on the downlink to a particular terminal is processed as one or more<br>
"transport" channels at a higher signaling layer. The transport channels support<br>
concurrent transmission of different types of services (e.g., voice, video, packet data,<br>
and so on). The transport channels are then mapped to one or more "physical"<br>
channels, which are assigned to the terminal for a communication session (e.g., a call).<br>
In W-CDMA, a downlink dedicated physical channel (downlink DPCH) is typically<br>
assigned to each active terminal for the duration of a communication session. The<br>
downlink DPCH carries transport channel data and control data in a time-division<br>
multiplexed (TDM) manner.<br>
[1033] FIG. 2A shows the format for the downlink DPCH in W-CDMA. Data is<br>
transmitted on the downlink DPCH in radio frames. Each radio frame is transmitted<br>
over a 10 msec frame, which is divided into 15 slots. Each slot is fiirther partitioned<br>
into multiple fields for different types of data.<br>
[1034] As shown in FIG. 2A, for the downlink DPCH, each slot includes data fields<br>
220a and 220b (Datal and Data2), a TPC field 222, a transport format combination<br>
indicator (TFCI) field 224, and a pilot field 226. Data fields 220a and 220b carry user-<br>
specific data. TPC field 222 carries a TPC command. TFCI field 224 carries the<br>
transport format for the downlink DPCH. Pilot field 226 carries a dedicated pilot for the<br>
terminal. The duration of each field in the downlink DPCH is determined by the slot<br>
format used for the downUnk DPCH. One TPC command is sent in each slot in TPC<br>
field 222. TPC field 222 may have a duration of 2, 4, 8, or 16 bits, depending on the<br>
selected slot format.<br>
[1035] As shown in FIG. 2A, the downlink DPCH is a multiplex of a downlink<br>
dedicated physical data channel (DPDCH) and a downlink dedicated physical control<br>
channel pPCCH). The fransport channel data is mapped to the DPDCH, while the<br>
DPCCH carries signaling information from a physical layer.<br><br>
[1036] FIG. 2B shows the format for a common pilot channel (CPICH) in W-<br>
CDMA. The CPICH is a fixed rate (30 kbps) downlink physical channel that carries a<br>
predefined bit sequence. The CPICH is transmitted at a fixed power level.<br>
[1037] hi W-CDMA, each physical channel is assigned a different orthogonal<br>
variable spreading factor (OVSF) code. The OVSF code is used to "channelize" the<br>
data carried by the physical channel. The OVSF codes in W-CDMA are akin to the<br>
Walsh codes in IS-95 and IS-2000. An OVSF code of all zeros is used for the CPICH,<br>
and a non-zero OVSF code is assigned for the downlink DPCH. The downlink DPCH<br>
and CPICH are described in detail in a document 3GPP TS 25.211, which is publicly<br>
available.<br>
[1038]      FIG. 3 shows a block diagram of a base station 1 lOx (which may be one of<br>
the base stations in FIG. 1) and terminal 120.<br>
[1039] At base station 1 lOx, for the downlink, a transmit (TX) data processor 310<br>
receives, formats, and codes various types of traffic data (e.g., user-specific data,<br>
overhead data, and so on) based on one or more coding schemes to provide data<br>
symbols. A modulator (MOD) 312 then processes the data symbols and pilot symbols<br>
to provide a sequence of complex-valued chips. For W-CDMA, the processing by<br>
modulator 312 includes (1) channelizing (or "spreading") each data symbol for each<br>
physical channel with an OVSF code for that channel, (2) channelizing each pilot<br>
symbol with the pilot OVSF code, (3) combining the channelized data and pilot symbols<br>
for all physical channels, and (4) spectrally spreading (or "scrambling") the combined<br>
symbols with a scrambling sequence assigned to the base station to obtain the sequence<br>
of complex-valued chips. These chips are then provided to a transmitter unit (TMTR)<br>
314 and conditioned (e.g., converted to one or more analog signals, amplified, filtered,<br>
and frequency upconverted) to generate a downlink signal. The downlink signal is then<br>
routed through a duplexer 316 and transmitted fi:om an antenna 318 and over a wireless<br>
communication link to the terminals.<br>
[1040] At terminal 120, the downlink signal(s) fi:om one or multiple base stations<br>
are received by an antenna 350, routed through a duplexer 352, and provided to a<br>
receiver unit (RCVR) 354. Receiver unit 354 conditions (e.g., filters, anipUfies, and<br>
frequency downconverts) the received signal and further digitizes the conditioned signal<br>
to provide a stream of data samples. A demodulator (DEMOD) 356, which may be<br>
implemented with a rake receiver, then processes the data samples to provide<br><br>
"recovered" symbols. For W-CDMA, the processing by demodulator 356 includes (1)<br>
descrambling the data samples with a descrambhng sequence for the base station being<br>
recovered, (2) channelizing the descrambled samples with OVSF codes to segregate the<br>
received data symbols and pilot symbols onto their respective physical channels, and (3)<br>
coherently demodulating the received data symbols with pilot estimates to obtain the<br>
recovered symbols, as described below. A receive (RX) data processor 358 then<br>
decodes the recovered symbols to obtain the user-specific data and overhead data sent<br>
on the downlink.<br>
[1041] The processing for an uplink transmission may be performed similarly to<br>
that described above for the downlink. The downlink and uplink processing for W-<br>
CDMA is described in documents 3GPP TS 25.211, 25.212, 25.213, and 25.214, all of<br>
which are pubHcly available.<br>
[1042] Controllers 320 and 360 direct various operations at base station 11 Ox and<br>
terminal 120, respectively. Memory units 322 and 362 store data and codes for<br>
controllers 320 and 360, respectively.<br>
[1043] FIG. 4 shows a block diagram of a rake receiver 356a, which is one<br>
embodiment of demodulator 356 in FIG. 3. Rake receiver 356a includes a sample<br>
buffer 408, a searcher 410, N finger processors 412a through 412n (where N &gt; 1), and a<br>
symbol combiner 430.<br>
[1044] Receiver unit 354 processes the received signal fi-om antenna 350 and<br>
provides a stream of data samples, which is stored in buffer 408. Buffer 408 thereafter<br>
provides the data samples to the appropriate processing units (e.g., searcher 410 and/or<br>
finger processors 412) at the appropriate time. Searcher 410 searches for strong signal<br>
instances (i.e., multipaths) in the received signal and provides the strength and timing of<br>
each found multipath that meets a set of criteria. The search processing is known in the<br>
art and not described herein.<br>
[1045] Each finger processor 412 may be assigned to process a different multipath<br>
of interest (e.g., a multipath of sufficient strength). Within each finger processor 412, a<br>
resampler/rotator 420 performs resampling and phase rotation on the data samples to<br>
provide derotated samples at the proper chip rate and with the proper timing and phase.<br>
A descrambler 422 then multiplies the derotated samples with the descrambling<br>
sequence for the base station being recovered and provides descrambled samples.<br><br>
[1046]       To recover the pilot on the CPICH, a pilot channelizer 424b first multiplies'<br>
the descrambled samples with the pilot OVSF code, Wpi,^,, and further accumulates the<br>
resultant samples for each time interval T^.,^, to obtain a received pilot symbol.  T ââ, is<br>
an integer multiple of the length of the pilot OVSF code. A pilot filter 426 then filters<br>
the received pilot symbols to provide pilot estimates for the CPICH.<br>
[1047] To recover the data on the downlink DPCH, a data channelizer 424a first<br>
multiplies the descrambled samples with the OVSF code W^^^^ for the downlink DPCH<br>
and further accumulates the resultant samples over the length of this OVSF code to<br>
provide received data symbols. A data demodulator 428 then coherently demodulates<br>
the received data symbols with the pilot estimates to provide data symbol estimates.<br>
The pilot estimates are used as phase reference for the coherent demodulation.<br>
[1048] The coherent demodulation may be performed with a dot product or a cross<br>
product. The dot product of the received data symbols and the pilot estimates may be<br>
expressed as:<br>
rin)=Dl{n)-P;{n) + D^(n)-P^{n) ,	Eq(l)<br>
where Dj'(n) + jDQ(n) is a complex-valued received data symbol from data<br>
channelizer 424a of finger processor i for symbol period Â«;<br>
Pj'{n) + JPQ{H) is a complex-valued pilot estimate from pilot filter 426 of finger<br>
processor i for symbol period n; and<br>
Y\n) is a real-valued data symbol estimate firom finger processor i for symbol<br>
period n.<br>
The cross product of the received data symbols and the pilot estimates may be expressed<br>
as:<br>
Y\n) = Dl{n)-P^{n)-Dl{nyP;{n) .	Eq(2)<br>
[1049] Symbol combiner 430 receives and combines the data symbol estimates fi'om<br>
all finger processors assigned to process each base station and provides final data<br>
symbol estimates (i.e., recovered symbols) for that base station. If multiple base<br>
stations are being processed (e.g., in soft handover), then symbol combiner 430 provides<br><br>
a stream of recovered symbols for each base station. Coherent demodulation and<br>
symbol combining are also described in U.S Patent Nos. 5,764,687 and 5,490,165.<br>
[1050] On the uplink, the capacity of each base station is limited by the total power<br>
received by the base station. To maximize uplink capacity, the transmit power of each<br>
terminal is typically controlled to be as low as possible to reduce interference while<br>
maintaining the desired level of performance. This level of performance is denoted by a<br>
target BLER (e.g., of 1%) in the following description.<br>
[1051] BIG. 5 shows an uplink power control mechanism 500, which includes an<br>
inner loop 510 and an outer loop 520. For a terminal in soft handover and<br>
communicating with multiple base stations (i.e., node Bs, in W-CDMA terminology),<br>
one inner loop 510 is maintained by each base station for the terminal. A single outer<br>
loop 520 is maintained for the terminal by a network entity, e.g., RKfC 130. FIG. 5 also<br>
shows various processing units in base station 11 Ox and terminal 120 that make up the<br>
inner and outer loops. (Not all processing units are shown in FIG. 5 for simplicity.)<br>
[1052] For each base station, inner loop 510 attempts to maintain the received SIR<br>
for the uplink transmission, as measured at that base station, as close as possible to a<br>
target SIR. Inner loop 510 performs power adjustment by: (1) estimating the received<br>
SIR for the uplink transmission (in a demodulator 334 at base station 1 lOx, see FIG. 3),<br>
(2) comparing the received SIR against the target SIR (in a TPC generator 324 at base<br>
station 11 Ox), (3) generating TPC commands based on the results of the comparison<br>
(also in TPC generator 324), and (4) sending the TPC commands to the terminal via the<br>
downlink (cloud 540). Each TPC command is either an UP command to dkect an<br>
increase in transmit power or a DOWN command to direct a decrease in transmit power.<br>
One TPC command is sent in each slot m W-CDMA.<br>
[1053] The terminal processes the downlink transmissions received from the base<br>
stations in its active set. For each slot, the terminal processes the DPCCH for each base<br>
station to obtain a received TPC symbol, which is an estimate of the TPC command sent<br>
by that base station. Each received TPC symbol is a "soft-decision" symbol (i.e., a<br>
multi-bit value) that comprises (1) a hard-decision value ("0" or "1") for the TPC<br>
command sent by the base station plus (2) channel noise and other distortions. For each<br>
slot, the terminal combines the received TPC symbols for all base stations in the active<br>
set to obtain a single TPC decision for that slot (in a TPC processor 364 at terminal<br>
120). The terminal then adjusts its uplink transmit power accordingly based on the TPC<br><br>
decision (in a transmitter unit 376 at terminal 120). For W-CDMA, the TPC commands<br>
may be sent as often as 1500 times per second, thus providing a relatively fast response<br>
time for inner loop 510.<br>
[1054] Due to path loss and fading on the uplink (cloud 530), which typically varies<br>
over time and especially for a mobile terminal, the received SIR at each base station<br>
continually fluctuates. For each base station, inner loop 510 attempts to maintain the<br>
received SIR at or neai- the target SIR in the presence of changes in the uplink.<br>
[1055] Outer loop 520 continually adjusts the target SIR such that the target BLER<br>
is achieved for the uplink transmission. A single outer loop 520 may be maintained for<br>
the terminal by RNC 130. The uplink transmission from the terminal is received and<br>
decoded by each base station to recover the transmitted data blocks, and the status of<br>
each decoded data block is determined (by an RX data processor 336 in base station<br>
11 Ox). For each decoded data block, a determination is made whether the data block<br>
was decoded correctly (good) or in error (erased) or not transmitted at all (DTX). The<br>
status of each decoded data block (good, erased, or DTX) is then sent to RNC 130.<br>
RNC 130 selects certain ones of the decoded data blocks and adjusts the target SIR<br>
accordingly based on the status of the selected data blocks. Typically, if a data block is<br>
decoded correctly, then the received SIR at the base stations is Ukely to be higher than<br>
necessary, and the target SIR is reduced slightly. Conversely, if a data block is decoded<br>
in error, then the received SIR at the base stations is likely to be lower than necessary,<br>
and the target SIR is increased. The target SIR may be maintained fixed if RNC 130<br>
detects that no data blocks were transmitted.<br>
[1056] The performance of the uplink power control is dependent on the terminal's<br>
ability to accurately detect the TPC commands sent by the base stations.<br>
Conventionally, the terminal determines whether or not each base station is reliably<br>
received based on the received pilot strength measured at the terminal for that base<br>
station. If a base station is deemed to be rehable, then the received TPC commands for<br>
the base station are used by the inner loop for power control. This method of<br>
determining the reliability of received TPC commands based on received pilot strength<br>
may be inaccurate for the reasons given above.<br>
[1057] The reliability of the received TPC commands is determined by the received<br>
SIR for the TPC commands (i.e., the TPC SIR). The TPC SIR for W-CDMA may be<br>
expressed as:<br><br>
TPC SIR=-.A^^c -SF.^^^^^A^ ,	Eq (3)<br>
where TV, //â is the total-noise-and-interference-to-total-incoming-signal ratio;<br>
TPC E^ 11^ is the received signal strengtli for the TPC commands;<br>
SF is the spreading factor for the OVSF code (i.e., the OVSF code length) for<br>
the downlink DPCH; and<br>
Nj.pc is the number of TPC bits in a slot.<br>
The term E^ denotes the energy-per-chip for a data or pilot symbol. The term N,<br>
denotes the total noise and interference power (i.e., without the desired signal). The<br>
term /â denotes the total incoming signal power at the input of receiver unit 354. /â is<br>
typically a fixed value that is determined by the design of the receiver unit. Since /â is<br>
a fixed value, N,l Iâ is simply the squared magnitude of noise and interference, and<br>
TPC E^ 11â is the squared magnitude of the received TPC commands.<br>
[1058] The slot format indicates various configurable transmission parameters for<br>
the downlink DPCH, such as the number of bits transmitted for each TPC command<br>
(iVjyc) ^d the spreading factor for the downlink DPCH. These configurable<br>
parameters are used to obtain the proper scaling in the computation of the TPC SIR.<br>
The terms SF and N^pf, may be accounted for by a scaling factor in equation (3).<br>
[1059] In one specific receiver implementation, the following quantities are<br>
computed by the terminal:<br>
A = ^, -CPICH EJI, -N, II, , and	Eq (4)<br>
B = ^2 â  ^CPICH EJI,- Nâc â¢ SF â  ^TPC E, II, ,	Eq(5)<br>
where CPICH EJI, is the received pilot strength for the CPICH;<br>
A is a weighted N^ II, estimate computed for each finger processor;<br>
B is the value of the received TPC command from the symbol combiner; and<br>
/Cj and k^ are two fixed-value constants determined by the receiver design.<br>
The TPC SIR may be computed using the quantities A and B, as follows:<br><br>
where k^^O.Ski/k^ . hi equations (3) through (6), the multiplication and division by<br>
Nj.pc â  SF can be performed with simple shift operations because this quantity has a<br>
power-of-two value (i.e., Njp^ â¢ SF = 2% where z is a positive integer).<br>
[1060] The TPC SIR may be computed as shown in equation (6) for each received<br>
TPC command and used to determine the reliability of the received TPC command. If<br>
the TPC SIR for a given received TPC command is sufficiently high (i.e., exceeds a<br>
TPC SIR threshold), then the received TPC command is deemed as rehable and used for<br>
power control. Conversely, if the TPC SIR for the received TPC command is low (i.e.,<br>
falls below the TPC SIR threshold), then the received TPC command is deemed as<br>
unreliable and discarded. The TPC SIR threshold is typically a static value that is<br>
selected based on a tradeoff between probability of false alarm and probability of<br>
missed detection, as described below.<br>
[1061] It may not be convenient to compute the TPC SIR expUcitly as shown in<br>
equation (6). Some simplifications may be made. For example, the quantity B^ may be<br>
compared against a TPC target value, which is equal to the product Nj.pc -SF-A-Aj"'<br>
times the TPC SIR threshold.    This implementation avoids the need for a divide<br>
operation. Other simpUfications may also be made, as described below.<br>
[1062]      Equation (6) may be rewritten as:<br><br>
B<br>
VA<br><br>
= k, -Vi^jpc-SF-VTPCSIR<br><br>
= fc,-VTPCSIR	,	Eq(7)<br>
= TPCâ.<br>
where k,=^l/y[k^, kâ =k,-^Nrpc SV, and TPC,,, is a TPC threshold (which is<br>
typically a static value). The quantity B/VA may be computed for each received TPC<br>
command and compared against the TPC threshold. Again, to avoid a divide operation,<br>
the quantity B may be compared against a TPC target value, which may be defined as:<br>
TPC^,,,,=VA-TPC^  .	Eq(8)<br><br>
The TPC target value may be viewed as a weighted or dynamic TPC threshold, where<br>
VA is the weight. The weight VA is proportional to ^CPICR EJI^- ^N, 11â,<br>
which is the weighted N, 11^ estimate, as shown in equation (4). The use of the TPC<br>
target value avoids the need to explicitly compute the TPC SIR. The reliability of the<br>
received TPC commands may be determined by performing simple comparison between<br>
the received TPC commands and the TPC target value.<br>
[1063] A received TPC command for a given base station is considered reliable if<br>
the absolute value of the received TPC command exceeds the TPC target value. The<br>
reliability of each received TPC command is individually determined based on the TPC<br>
command itself and the TPC target value. For a terminal in soft handover, a different<br>
TPC   target   value   may   be   derived   for   each   base   station   based   on   the<br>
.^CPICH EJI^' â yJN,/!^ measured at the terminal for that base station.<br>
[1064]      The TPC threshold, TPC,^, may also be defined in some other manners. In a<br>
first alternative embodiment, the TPC threshold is defined as:<br>
TPC,,=ii:4-VTPCSIR   ,	Eq(9)<br>
where K,, is a scaling factor that is not a function of Nj.pc â¢ SF.<br>
[1065]      Lti a second alternative embodiment, the TPC threshold is defined as:<br>
TPC,, = K, â  ^CVICB. EJl â  VTPC SIR ,	Eq (10)<br>
where K^ is a scaling factor.<br>
[1066]      In a third alternative embodiment, the TPC threshold is defined as:<br>
TPC,, = K, â  CPICH EJIâ- TPC SIR ,	Eq (11)<br>
where K^ is a scaling factor.<br>
[1067]      In a fourth alternative embodiment, the TPC threshold is defined as:<br>
TPCâ=/
where K^ is a scaling factor.<br>
[1068]      In a fifth alternative embodiment, the TPC threshold is defined as:<br><br>
TPC,, ^Kf â¢VOTHER_DPCCH_FIELD EJN,   ,     â 	Eq(13)<br>
where OTHER_DPCCH_FIELD EJN, is the EJN, oftheTFCI, the dedicated pilot,<br>
or a combination of any DPCCH symbols, and K^ is a scaling factor.<br>
[1069] In general, tlie TPC threshold may be a function of SIR, EJN^, EJI^,<br>
N,II^, or some other quantity for one or more transmissions. The transmission may be<br>
a common pilot (e.g., the CPICH), tlie received TPC commands, the data symbols<br>
received on a physical or code channel used for the TPC commands, a dedicated pilot<br>
(e.g., in the DPCCH, as show in FIG. 2A), or some other transmission.<br>
[1070] The TPC threshold may be determined based on a tradeoff between the<br>
probability of false alarm and the probability of missed detection. A hi^er TPC<br>
threshold results in lower likeHhood of false alarm and higher likelihood of missed<br>
detection. A false alarm occurs when an incorrectly received TPC command is deemed<br>
to be reliable and used for power control. False alarm is less likely to occur if the TPC<br>
threshold is high. A missed detection occurs when a correctly received TPC command<br>
is deemed to be unreUable and discarded. Missed detection is more likely to o'ccur if the<br>
TPC threshold is high. The TPC threshold may be selected to trade off between the<br>
probability of false alarm and the probability of missed detection. If the TPC threshold<br>
is based on TPC SIR, and since the computation of TPC SIR is dependent on the slot<br>
format as shown in equation (7), the scaling factor K^ in equation (7) may be a function<br>
of slot format. However, it can be shown that a fixed value for the scaling factor K^<br>
(i.e., not a fimction of slot format, as shown in equation (9)) can provide good<br>
performance and simple implementation.<br>
[1071]      In equation (8), the TPC target value is computed based on a weight<br>
.y/CPICH EJI^ â¢ -JNJX, &gt; which is proportional to -JX. The specific weight to use for<br>
the TPC target value may be dependent on the manner in which the received TPC<br>
commands are obtained. For example, the weight ^CPICH EJI^ '-^^tlh is used in<br>
equation (8) because the received TPC commands are obtained based on coherent<br>
demodulation of the received data symbols with the pilot estimates. The weight allows<br>
the received TPC commands to be compared directly against the TPC target value, and<br>
avoids the need for a division by VA  as described above.    For other receiver<br><br>
implementations, the weight may be a function of some other quantities, or may even be<br>
omitted altogether. The specific weight to use for the TPC target value may also be<br>
dependent on the manner in which various types of data are transmitted. For example,<br>
if the TPC commands are transmitted at a known power offset from the CPICH, then the<br>
TPC target value may be computed based on the received signal strength for the<br>
CPICH. The specific weight to use for the TPC target value may also be dependent on<br>
other factors.<br>
[1072] FIG. 6A shows a block diagram of an embodiment of TPC processor 364<br>
within terminal 120. TPC processor 364 includes a TPC target computation unit 610, a<br>
TPC detection unit 640, and a TPC combiner 650.<br>
[1073] Within computation unit 610, the pilot estimates for the CPICH for all<br>
assigned finger processors are provided to a computation unit 612, which computes the<br>
CPICH EJI^-NJIâ for each finger processor. The quantity (CPICH EJI^). for<br>
finger processor i may be obtained as the power of the pilot estimates, which is<br>
(CPICH EJi;)i = Pj'(nf+P^{nf.    The quantity NJIâ may be obtained by (1)<br>
computing a pilot difference as AP'(n) = P'(M)-P'(Â«-l), where<br>
P'(n) = P/(n) + jPQ(n), (2) computing the pilot difference power as ||AP'(Â«)||^, and<br>
(3) filtering the pilot difference power to obtain N,/Iâ. Unit 612 then multipHes<br>
(CPICH Â£'^//^), for each finger processor with N,/I^ to obtain<br>
(CPICH EJIâ-N,II,\ for that finger processor.<br>
[1074] Unit 612 may fiirther filter the (CPICH EJI^-N,IIX values for each<br>
finger processor. If a finger processor has just been assigned, then its filtered values<br>
may take some time to settle. In the interim period, a small value may be used instead<br>
of the filtered values. This small value ensures that the output firom a newly assigned<br>
fmger processor is not combined right away with the outputs firom other finger<br>
processors. This is the desired result if the new finger processor is assigned to a weak<br>
multipath, and marginally affects performance if the new finger processor is assigned to<br>
a strong multipath.<br>
[1075] A summing unit 614 then receives and sums the filtered or unfiltered<br>
(CPICH EJI^- N, //â),â  values for all finger processors assigned to each base station to<br><br>
obtain a (CPICH EJI^-NJI^)^ value for that base station. This summing may be<br>
expressed as:<br>
(CPICH Â£,//â.iV,/U. = E(CPICH^,//â.Ar,/U.  ,	Eq(14)<br>
where S^. denotes the set of all finger processors assigned to process base station k.<br>
[1076] A filter 616 then filters the (CPICH EJI^-NJI^)^ values for each base<br>
station to obtain filtered values for that base station. Filter 616 may implement a finite<br>
impulse response (FIR) filter, an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter, or some other<br>
filter structure. A unit 618 then takes the square root of the filtered<br>
(CPICH EJI^'NJI^)^ values to obtain the quantity (^CPICH EJI^-^N,/!^)^,<br>
which is -yjA^. A unit 620 then multiplies the output of unit 618 with a TPC threshold,<br>
TPC,^ 4, and one or more scaling factors (e.g., K^^ and Kjâ) to obtain one or more TPC<br>
target values for the base station. In one embodiment, a single TPC target value is used<br>
for the detection of both UP and DOWN commands. This single TPC target value may<br>
be computed as:<br>
TPC,^,,, =K,,,,â -TPC,,,, 'QcnCR EJ I,-^NJZ), ,        Eq(15)<br>
"where TPC^,g^n is the TPC target value for base station k;<br>
TPC,,, i is the TPC threshold for base station k; and<br>
K^p,jâ is a scaling factor used to compute the TPC target value.<br>
[1077] In another embodiment, separate TPC target values are used for the detection<br>
of UP and DOWN commands. These TPC target values may be computed as:<br>
TPC,^,,,., =ii:â, -TPC,,., -(VCPICH EJI, -^Njh), , and Eq(16)<br>
'^P'-'target,*!,/;<br>
= K,â -TPC,,, -(VCPICH EJI, -^NJI^),  ,<br>
where TPC,,,^ is the TPC tlireshold for base station k;<br>
TPCb,rget,Â«p,A is the UP TPC target value for base station k;<br>
TPCtarget,rfÂ«,it ^^ thc DOWN TPC target value for base station k;<br><br>
K^p is a scaling factor used to compute the UP TPC target value; and<br>
K^â is a scaling factor used to compute the DOWN TPC target value.<br>
The UP and DOWN TPC target values are used to detect for UP and DOWN<br>
commands, respective!)'-, sent by the base stations.<br>
[1078] FIG. 6A also shows an embodiment of symbol combiner 430. A summing<br>
unit 632 receives and sums the data symbol estimates' from all fimger processors<br>
assigned to each base station to obtain the final data symbol estimates for that base<br>
station. This summing may be expressed as:<br>
Y,(n) = Y,r(n) ,	Eq(17)<br>
where Y^^ (n) is the final data symbol estimate for base station k for symbol period n.<br>
[1079] A summing unit 634 then accumulates the final data symbol estimates<br>
obtained for each base station during the TPC field in each slot (see FIG. 2A) to provide<br>
a received TPC command for that base station for that slot. This accumulation may be<br>
expressed as:<br>
TPC^,,= "ZUn) ,	Eq(18)<br>
where TPCâ j is the received TPC command for base station k.<br>
[1080] Summing units 632 and 634 may also be swapped in FIG, 6A. In this case,<br>
the received TPC command for base station k may be obtained by (1) accumulating the<br>
data symbol estimates for each finger processor over the TPC field to obtain a received<br>
TPC command for that finger processor and (2) accumulating the received TPC<br>
commands for all finger processors assigned to each base station to obtain the received<br>
TPC command for that base station.<br>
[1081] TPC detection unit 640 then compares the received TPC commands for each<br>
base station against the TPC target value(s) for that base station. Unit 640 provides the<br>
detected TPC commands for each base station based on the resuh of the comparison.<br>
[1082] FIG. 6B shows the use of separate UP and DOWN TPC target values to<br>
detect the received TPC commands. The horizontal axis represents the possible values<br>
for the received TPC commands.   The UP TPC target value, TPCt,,get,,p,*. ^^ the<br><br>
DOWN TPC target value, TPC^.^.^^^^, are marked on the horizontal axis. Each<br>
received TPC command is mapped onto the horizontal axis. The detected value for<br>
each received TPC command is dependent on where the received TPC command falls in<br>
relation to tlie TPC target values. If inverted polarity is used for the TPC commands,<br>
then the detection for each received TPC command may be expressed as:<br><br>
TPC,., =<br><br>
DOWN command,   if TPCâ,, &gt; TPC,,,,,ââ, ,<br>
UP command,	if TPCâ., 
rejected command,   otherwise ,<br><br>
where TPC,^,, is the detected TPC command for base station k.<br>
As shown in equation (19), the received TPC command is considered unreliable and<br>
rejected if it falls in the range between  TPCi,^,,^^,   and  TPCt3^.,,,âi   (i.e., if<br>
TPCtjjgg,jâj &gt;TPCâ4 -TPC^ggtâpj(.).<br>
[1083] If a single TPC target value is used, then the UP and DOWN TPC target<br>
values may be set as: TPC^,,.,,,,., =-TPC,,,,,, and TPC,,,,,,â_, =TPC^,,,,,. A single<br>
TPC target value may be used if no bias is desired in the detection of UP and DOWN<br>
commands, so that UP and DOWN commands are equally hkely to be rejected. This<br>
may be the case, for example, if the terminal is not in soft handover. Two TPC target<br>
values may be used, for example, if a bias is desired in the detection of UP and DOWN<br>
commands. This may be the case, for example, if the terminal is in soft handover and<br>
the DOWN commands have a larger influence in the OR-of-the-DOWN rule. The UP<br>
TPC target value may be set to a small negative value or possibly even zero, so that UP<br>
commands are less likely to be rejected.<br>
[1084] Referring back to FIG. 6A, TPC combiner 650 receives and combines the<br>
detected TPC commands for all base stations to provide TPC decisions. TPC combiner<br>
650 implements the OR-of-the-DOWN rule to provide a TPC decision for each slot.<br>
TPC combiner 650 discards detected TPC commands for received TPC commands<br>
deemed as unreliable. For each slot, TPC combiner 650 provides (1) a DOWN TPC<br>
decision if any one of the detected TPC commands is a DOWN cormnand, (2) a rejected<br>
TPC decision if all detected TPC commands are rejected commands, or (3) an UP TPC<br>
decision otherwise. For each slot, the terminal increases its transmit power for an UP<br>
TPC decision, decreases its transmit power for a DOWN TPC decision, and maintains<br><br>
its transmit power otherwise. The TPC detection and combining may also be performed<br>
in some other manners.      '^<br>
[1085] For the embodiment shown in FIG. 6A, units 612, 614, and 616 may operate<br>
whenever pilot estimates are available from the finger processors. The TPC target<br>
value(s) for each base station maybe computed for each slot, each frame, or some other<br>
time  interval.      To   compute  the   TPC  target  value(s),   only  the  most  recent<br>
(^CPICH EJI^ â¢ -yJNJIJ J. value for each base station is needed from filter 616.<br>
[1086] For clarity, pseudo-code for a specific implementation of the detection and<br>
combining of received TPC commands is described below. Table 1 hsts the variables<br>

[1087] FIG. 7A shows an embodiment of a process 700 for determining the<br>
reHability of TPC commands received from a transmitter (e.g., a base station) in a<br>
wireless communication system (e.g., a CDMA system). At least one TPC target value<br>
is determined based on a TPC threshold and possibly a weight, as described above (step<br><br>
712). Multiple TPC target values may be computed and used to detect for UP<br>
commands and DOWN commands, as described above. The received TPC commands<br>
are compared against the TPC target value(s) (step 714). A detected TPC command is<br>
provided for each received TPC command based on the result of the comparison (step<br>
716). Each detected TPC command is a DOWN command, an UP command, or a<br>
rejected command, as shown in equation (19).<br>
[1088] FIG. 7B shows an embodiment of a process 750 for combining TPC<br>
â  commands received from multiple transmitters in a wireless communication system. At<br>
least one TPC target value is determined for each transmitter based on a TPC threshold<br>
and possibly a weight for the transmitter (step 752). The TPC target value(s) for each<br>
transmitter may be determined as described above. The received TPC commands for<br>
each transmitter are compared against the TPC target value(s) for that transmitter to<br>
obtain detected TPC commands for the transmitter (step 754). The detected TPC<br>
commands for the multiple transmitters are then combined to provide TPC decisions<br>
(step 756). Detected TPC commands for unreliably received TPC commands are<br>
discarded. The OR-of-the-DOWN rule may be appKed to the detected TPC commands<br>
for each power control period to obtain a TPC decision for that power control period, as<br>
described above.<br>
[1089] Various schemes may also be implemented in combination with the<br>
techniques described above. Some of these schemes are described below.<br>
[1090] In a first scheme, a power lock threshold is maintained for each assigned<br>
finger processor and used to accept or reject the received TPC commands for that finger<br>
processor. The power lock threshold may be computed based on an average<br>
DVCCEEJN,,   the    EJN,    of  any   DPCCH   field   including   TPCEJN,,<br>
CPICH EJI^, or some other EJN, or EJI^ measurement. For W-CDMA, the<br>
TPC, TFCI, and dedicated pilot (see FIG. 2A) may be transmitted at different power<br>
levels. Thus, the average DPCCH EJN, may be different from the TPC EJN,. The<br>
power lock threshold for each finger processor may be set, for example, to the<br>
measurement for the finger processor with the strongest multipath minus an offset (e.g.,<br>
a few dB). If this value is less than a minimum threshold value (e.g., -20 or -17.5 dB),<br>
then the power lock threshold may be set to the minimum threshold value. The power<br>
lock threshold for the strongest finger processor may be set to the minimum threshold<br>
value.<br><br>
[1091] If the measurement for a given finger processor is less than the power lock<br>
threshold for that finger processor, then the received TPC commands for that finger<br>
processor are discarded and not used for power control. The use of a power lock<br>
threshold based on DPCCH EJN, or TPC EJN, may result in some finger<br>
processors assigned to a "good" base station being combined even though the<br>
CPICH E^ llâ for these finger processors may be weak. This scenario is more likely to<br>
occur if power balancing is not applied for soft handover, and the ratio between DPCCH<br>
power to CPICH power varies across multiple base stations in tlie active set.<br>
[1092] In a second scheme, a power lock threshold is maintained for each base<br>
station and used to accept or reject the received TPC commands for that base station.<br>
The power lock threshold may be computed based on DPCCH EJl^,, TPC EJ'N,,<br>
CPICH EJI^, or some other EJ'N^ or EJI^ measurement.  The measurement for<br>
each base station may be determined by combining the measurements for all finger<br>
processors assigned to process that base station. The power lock threshold for each base<br>
station may be determined by the measurement for the strongest received base station<br>
minus an offset (e.g., a few dB). If the measiirement for a given base station is less than<br>
the power lock threshold for that base station, then the received TPC conmiands for that<br>
base station are discarded.<br>
[1093] In a third scheme, the received powers for the DPCCH and CPICH are<br>
estimated for each base station, and the ratio of DPCCH power to CPICH power is<br>
computed. The DPCCH to CPICH power ratios for all base stations in the active set are<br>
then compared to detect for power imbalance. Power imbalance may be declared, for<br>
example, if the largest power ratio is greater than X times the smallest power ratio,<br>
where X is a value greater than one. If power imbalance is not declared, then the<br>
received TPC coinmands may be accepted or rejected based on pilot signal stiength<br>
(i.e., received power for the CPICH). Otherwise, if power imbalance is declared, then<br>
the techniques described above may be used to determine the reliabiUty of individual<br>
received TPC commands and to combine these received TPC commands.<br>
[1094] In a fourth scheme, only the received TPC commands for the strongest<br>
received base station are used for power conti:ol. The received TPC commands for all<br>
other base stations are discarded. For this scheme, no TPC combining is performed.<br>
The received TPC commands for the sb:ongest received base station may be accepted or<br>
rejected using the techniques described above.<br><br>
[1095] The techniques described herein can more accurately determine the<br>
reliability of received TPC commands. These techniques may be advantageously used<br>
by/for terminals that are in soft handover as well as those that are not in soft handover.<br>
[1096] The techniques described herein may be used for any closed-loop power-<br>
controlled wireless communication system that sends TPC commands to control<br>
transmit power. For example, these techniques may be used for CDMA systems such as<br>
W-CDMA, IS-95, IS-2000, and IS-856 systems. Different systems may send TPC<br>
commands in different manners, using different channel structures, and so on.<br>
Moreover, the TPC commands for different systems may have different formats and/or<br>
different polarity than those described above for W-CDMA. The number of TPC target<br>
values to use and the values for these TPC target values may then be dependent on the<br>
format and polarity used for the TPC commands.<br>
[1097] The techniques described herein may be implemented by various means. For<br>
example, these techniques may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination<br>
thereof For a hardware implementation, the processing units for these techniques (e.g.,<br>
TPC processor 364) may be implemented within one or more application specific<br>
integrated circuits (ASICs), digital signal processors (DSPs), digital signal processing<br>
devices (DSPDs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), field programmable gate arrays<br>
(FPGAs), processors, controllers, micro-controllers, microprocessors, other electronic<br>
units designed to perform the fimctions described herein, or a combination thereof<br>
[1098] For a software implementation, the techniques described herein may be<br>
implemented with modules (e.g., procedures, fimctions, and so on) that perform the<br>
fimctions described herein. The software codes may be stored in a memory unit (e.g.,<br>
memory unit 322 or 362 in FIG. 3) and executed by a processor (e.g., controller 320 or<br>
360). The memory unit may be implemented within the processor or external to the<br>
processor, in which case it can be communicatively coupled to the processor via various<br>
means as is known in the art.<br>
[1099] The previous description of the disclosed embodiments is provided to enable<br>
any person skilled in the art to make or use the present invention. Various<br>
modifications to these embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art,<br>
and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments without<br>
departing firom the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, the present invention is not<br><br>
intended to be limited to the embodiments shown herein but is to be accorded the widest<br>
scope consistent with the principles and novel features disclosed herein.<br>
