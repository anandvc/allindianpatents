It is also possible to admix other known active compounds, such as herbicides, fertilizers and growth regulators.<br>
When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention can furthermore be present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with synergistic agents. Synergistic agents are compounds which increase the action of the active compounds, without it being necessary for the synergistic agent added to be active itself.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available formulations can vary within wide limits. The active compound concentration of the use forms can be from 0.0000001 to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by weight.<br>
The compounds are employed in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms.<br>
When used against hygiene pests and pests of stored products, the active compound is distinguished by an excellent residual action on wood and clay as well as a good stability to alkali on limed substrates.<br><br><br><br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are in each case commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants having novel properties ("traits") which have been obtained by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by genetic engineering. These can be cultivars, bio- or genotypes.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions to be used according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are preferably to be treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly advantageous useful traits to these plants. Examples of such traits are better plant<br><br><br><br>
growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryIIA, CryIIIA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the increased defence of the plants against fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosates or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names<br><br><br>
Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean). Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with the compounds of the formula (I) and/or the active compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds and/or mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention act not only against plant, hygiene and stored product pests, but also in the veterinary medicine sector against animal parasites (ectoparasites), such as hard ticks, soft ticks, mange mites, leaf mites, flies (biting and licking), parasitic fly larvae, lice, hair lice, feather lice and fleas. These parasites include:<br>

The active compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention are also suitable for controlling arthropods which infest agricultural productive livestock, such as, for example, cattle, sheep, goats, horses, pigs, donkeys, camels, buffalo, rabbits, chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese and bees, other pets, such as, for example, dogs, cats, caged birds and aquarium fish, and also so-called test animals, such as, for example, hamsters, guinea pigs, rats and mice. By controlling these arthropods, cases of death and reduction in productivity (for meat, milk, wool, hides, eggs, honey etc.) should be diminished, so that more economic and easier animal husbandry is possible by use of the active compounds according to the invention.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are used in the veterinary sector in a known manner by enteral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, potions, drenches, granules, pastes, boluses, the feed-through process and suppositories, by parenteral administration, such as, for example, by injection (intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraperitoneal and the like), implants, by nasal administration, by dermal use in the form, for example, of dipping or bathing, spraying, pouring on and spotting on, washing and powdering, and also with the aid of moulded articles containing the active compound, such as collars, ear marks, tail marks, limb bands, halters, marking devices and the like.<br>
When used for cattle, poultry, pets and the like, the active compounds of the formula (I) can be used as formulations (for example powders, emulsions, free-flowing compositions), which comprise the active compounds in an amount of 1 to 80% by weight, directly or after 100 to 10 000-fold dilution, or they can be used as a chemical bath.<br>
It has furthermore been found that the compounds according to the invention have a strong insecticidal action against insects which destroy industrial materials.<br>
The following insects may be mentioned as examples and as preferred - but without a limitation:<br><br><br>
Beetles, such as<br>
Hylotrupes   bajulus,   Chlorophorus   pilosis,   Anobium   punctatum,   Xestobium<br>

Bristletails, such as Lepisma saccarina.<br>
Industrial materials in the present connection are to be understood as meaning non¬living materials, such as, preferably, plastics, adhesives, sizes, papers and cards, leather, wood and processed wood products and coating compositions.<br>
Wood and processed wood products are materials to be protected, especially preferably, from insect infestation.<br>
Wood and processed wood products which can be protected by the agent according to<br>
the invention or mixtures comprising it are to be understood as meaning, for<br>
example:<br>
building timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, boat jetties,<br>
wooden vehicles, boxes, pallets, containers, telegraph poles, wood panelling, wooden<br>
windows and doors, plywood, chipboard, joinery or wooden products which are used<br>
quite generally in house-building or in building joinery.<br><br><br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of concentrates or in generally customary formulations, such as powders, granules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
The formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by mixing the active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersing agent and/or binder or fixing agent, a water repellent, if appropriate siccatives and UV stabilizers and if appropriate dyestuffs and pigments, and also other processing auxiliaries.<br>
The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for the preservation of wood and wood-derived timber products comprise the active compound according to the invention in a concentration of 0.0001 to 957o by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br>
The amount of the compositions or concentrates employed depends on the nature and occurrence of the insects and on the medium. The optimum amount employed can be determined for the use in each case by a series of tests. In general, however, it is sufficient to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of the active compound, based on the material to be preserved.<br>
Solvents and/or diluents which are used are an organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or an oily or oil-like organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture of low volatility and/or a polar organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water, and if appropriate an emulsifier and/or wetting agent.<br>
Organic chemical solvents which are preferably used are oily or oil-like solvents having an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably above 45°C. Substances which are used as such oily or oil-like water-insoluble solvents of low volatility are appropriate mineral oils or aromatic fractions thereof, or<br><br><br>
solvent mixtures containing mineral oils, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
Mineral oils having a boiling range from 170 to 220°C, white spirit having a boiling range from 170 to 220°C, spindle oil having a boiling range from 250 to 350°C, petroleum and aromatics having a boiling range from 160 to 280°C, terpentine oil and the like, are advantageously employed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons having a boiling range from 180 to 210°C or high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons having a boiling range from 180 to 220°C and/or spindle oil and/or monochloronaphthalene, preferably a-monochloronaphthalene, are used.<br>
The organic oily or oil-like solvents of low volatility which have an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably above 45°C. can be replaced in part by organic chemical solvents of high or medium volatility, provided that the solvent mixture likewise has an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, and that the insecticide/fungicide mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, some of the organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture is replaced by an aliphatic polar organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture. Aliphatic organic chemical solvents containing hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups, such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters or the like, are preferably used.<br>
Organic chemical binders which are used in the context of the present invention are the synthetic resins and/or binding drying oils which are known per se, are water-dilutable and/or are soluble or dispersible or emulsifiable in the organic chemical solvents employed, in particular binders consisting of or comprising an acrylate resin, a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation or<br><br><br>
polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenolic resin, hydrocarbon resin, such as indene-cumarone resin, silicone resin, drying vegetable oils and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The synthetic resin used as the binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or solution. Bitumen or bituminous substances can also be used as binders in an amount of up to 10% by weight. Dyestuffs, pigments, water-repelling agents, odour correctants and inhibitors or anticorrosive agents and the like which are known per se can additionally be employed.<br>
It is preferred according to the invention for the composition or concentrate to comprise, as the organic chemical binder, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or a drying vegetable oil. Alkyd resins having an oil content of more than 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight, are preferably used according to the invention.<br>
All or some of the binder mentioned can be replaced by a fixing agent (mixture) or a plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent evaporation of the active compounds and crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of the binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers originate from the chemical classes of phthalic acid esters, such as dibutyl, dioctyl or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric acid esters, such as tributyl phosphate, adipic acid esters, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates, such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates, such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher molecular weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic acid esters.<br>
Fixing agents are based chemically on polyvinyl alkyl ethers, such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl ether or ketones, such as benzophenone or ethylenebenzophenone.<br><br><br><br>
Possible solvents or diluents are, in particular, also water, if appropriate as a mixture with one or more of the abovementioned organic chemical solvents or diluents, emulsifiers and dispersing agents.<br>
Particularly effective preservation of wood is achieved by impregnation processes on a large industrial scale, for example vacuum, double vacuum or pressure processes.<br>
The ready-to-use compositions can also comprise other insecticides, if appropriate, and also one or more fungicides, if appropriate.<br>
Possible additional mixing partners are, preferably, the insecticides and fungicides mentioned in WO 94/29 268. The compounds mentioned in this document are an explicit constituent of the present application.<br>
Especially preferred mixing partners which may be mentioned are insecticides, such as chlorpyriphos, phoxim, silafluofm, alphamethrin, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, permethrin, imidacloprid, NI-25, flufenoxuron, hexaflumuron, transfluthrin, thiacloprid, methoxyfenozide and triflumuron,<br>
and also fungicides, such as epoxyconazole, hexaconazole, azaconazole, propiconazole, tebuconazole, cyproconazole, metconazole, imazalil, dichlorfluanid, tolylfluanid, 3-iodo-2-propinyl-butyl carbamate, N-octyl-isothiazolin-3-one and 4,5-dichloro-N-octylisothiazolin-3-one.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can at the same time be employed for protecting objects which come into contact with saltwater or brackish water, such as hulls, screens, nets, buildings, moorings and signalling systems, against fouling.<br>
Fouling by sessile Oligochaeta, such as Serpulidae, and by shells and species from the Ledamorpha group (goose barnacles), such as various Lepas and Scalpellum species, or by species from the Balanomorpha group (acorn barnacles), such as Balanus or Pollicipes species, increases the frictional drag of ships and, as a<br><br><br>
consequence, leads to a marked increase in operational costs owing to higher energy consumption and additionally frequent residence in the dry dock.<br>
Apart from fouling by algae, for example Ectocarpus sp. and Ceramium sp., fouling<br>
	by sessile Entomostraka groups, which come under the generic term Cirripedia<br>
(cirriped crustaceans), is of particular importance.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the compounds according to the invention,<br>
alone  or in  combination  with  other active  compounds,  have  an  outstanding<br>
	antifouling action.<br>
Using the compounds according to the invention, alone or in combination with other active compounds, allows the use of heavy metals such as, for example, in bis(trialkyltin)  sulphides,  tri-n-butyltin  laurate,  tri-n-butyltin  chloride,  copper(I)<br>
	oxide,   triethyltin   chloride,   tri-n-butyl(2-phenyl-4-chlorophenoxy)tin,   tributyltin<br>
oxide, molybdenum disulphide, antimony oxide, polymeric butyl titanate, phenyl-(bispyridine)-bismuth chloride, tri-n-butyltin fluoride, manganese ethylenebisthio-carbamate, zinc dimethyldithiocarbamate, zinc ethylenebisthiocarbamate, zinc salts and   copper   salts   of   2-pyridinethiol   1-oxide,   bisdimethyldithiocarbamoylzinc<br>
	ethylene-bisthiocarbamate, zinc oxide, copper(I) ethylene-bisdithiocarbamate, copper<br>
thiocyanate, copper naphthenate and tributyltin halides to be dispensed with, or the concentration of these compounds to be substantially reduced.<br>
If appropriate, the ready-to-use antifouling paints can additionally comprise other<br>
	active compounds, preferably algicides, fungicides, herbicides, molluscicides, or<br>
other antifouling active compounds.<br>
Preferably suitable components in combinations with the antifouling compositions according to the invention are: <br>
algicides such as<br><br><br>
2-tert-butylaniino-4-cyclopropylamino-6-methylthio-1,3,5-triazine, dichlorophen, diuron, endothal, fentin acetate, isoproturon, methabenzthiazuron, oxyfluorfen, quinoclamine and terbutryn;<br>

tetrachloro-4-(methylsulphonyl)-pyridine,	2,4,5,6-tetrachloroisophthalonitrile,<br>
tetramethylthiuram disulphide and 2,4,6-trichlorophenylmaleimide.<br>
The antifouling compositions used comprise the active compound according to the invention of the compounds according to the invention in a concentration of 0.001 to 50% by weight, in particular 0.01 to 20% by weight.<br>
Moreover, the antifouling compositions according to the invention comprise the customary components such as, for example, those described in Ungerer, Chem. Ind. 1985, 37, 730-732 and Williams, Antifouling Marine Coatings, Noyes, Park Ridge, 1973.<br><br><br><br>
Besides the algicidal, fungicidal, molluscicidal active compounds and insecticidal active compounds according to the invention, antifouling paints comprise, in particular, binders.<br>
Examples of recognized binders are polyvinyl chloride in a solvent system, chlorinated rubber in a solvent system, acrylic resins in a solvent system, in particular in an aqueous system, vinyl chloride/vinyl acetate copolymer systems in the form of aqueous dispersions or in the form of organic solvent systems, butadiene/-styrene/acrylonitrile rubbers, drying oils such as linseed oil, resin esters or modified hardened resins in combination with tar or bitumens, asphalt and epoxy compounds, small amounts of chlorine rubber, chlorinated polypropylene and vinyl resins.<br>
If appropriate, paints also comprise inorganic pigments, organic pigments or colorants which are preferably insoluble in salt water. Paints may furthermore comprise materials such as colophonium to allow controlled release of the active compounds. Furthermore, the paints may comprise plasticizers, modifiers which affect the rheological properties and other conventional constituents. The compounds according to the invention or the abovementioned mixtures may also be incorporated into self-polishing antifouling systems.<br>
The active compounds are also suitable for controlling animal pests, in particular insects, arachnids and mites, which are found in enclosed spaces such as, for example, dwellings, factory halls, offices, vehicle cabins and the like. They can be employed alone or in combination with other active compounds and auxiliaries in domestic insecticide products for controlling these pests.

The preparation and use of the active compounds according to the invention are illustrated by the examples below.<br><br><br><br>
Preparation Examples Example (I-a-1)<br><br>
Process A:<br>
At room temperature, a solution of 53.3 g (0.16 mol) of the compound according to Preparation Example (II-1) (99% pure, cis/trans 97:3) in 160 ml of dimethylformamide (DMF) is added dropwise to a solution of 30% strength methanolic NaOMe solution (72 g, 0.4 mol) in 240 ml of DMF (with the methanol being completely removed beforehand by distillation).<br>
The reaction mixture is heated to 60°C and stirred at 60°C for 4 h.<br>
The methanol formed during the reaction is distilled off under slight vacuum. At 50-60°C, a mixture of 32% strength hydrochloric acid (96 ml) and 960 ml of water is then added dropwise. The solution is stirred at room temperature for 1 h and the solid is filtered off with suction, washed 2 x with in each case 200 ml of water and dried.<br>
Yield: 44.16 g (91.6% of theory), m.p. 224-228°C<br><br>
Example (I-a-2)<br><br>
Process E:<br>
1.75 g of the compound of Example (I-c-2) are initially charged in 5 ml of ethanol, and 0.5 g of NaOH in 4 ml of water is added dropwise at room temperature. The mixture is stirred at 40-50°C and the reaction is monitored by thin-layer chromatography.<br>
When the reaction has ended, the ethanol is distilled off and the residue is made up with water to a volume of 10 ml. At 0-10°C, the mixture is acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid and the precipitate is filtered off with suction and dried.<br>
Yield: 1.35 g (92% of theory), m.p. 274°C.<br>
Analogously to Example (I-a-2), Example (I-a-1) of melting point 226 °C is obtained according to Process E.<br><br><br>

3.02 g (l0mmol) of the compound of Example (I-a-1) and 1.21 g (12 mmol) of triethylamine are initially charged in 20 ml of chlorobenzene. At 60-65°C, a solution of 1.14 g (10.5 mmol) of ethyl chloroformate in 8 ml of chlorobenzene is then added dropwise. The mixture is stirred at 60-65oC for 4 h. At room temperature, the reaction<br>
	solution is diluted with 20 ml of chlorobenzene and extracted with 20 ml of water,<br>
20 ml of 5% strength aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and finally with 10 ml of saturated aqueous NaCl solution, the organic phase is dried and the solvent is distilled off. This gives 3.88 g of crude product, 1.523 g of which were recrystallized from 15 ml of methylcyclohexane. This gave 1.437 g of product; accordingly, the calculated<br>
	yield for the total amount of I-c-1 is 3.72 g. Based on a purity of 99.6%, the yield is<br>
3.68 g (4 98.6% of theory), m.p. 142-143°C<br><br><br>

hydrochloride (WO 02/02532, Ex. 15) and 221 g (1.6 mol) of potassium carbonate are initially charged in 370 ml of acetonitrile.<br>
At 5-10°C, a solution of 75.1 g (0.4 mol) of 2,5-dimethylphenylacetyl chloride in<br>
	140 ml of acetonitrile is added dropwise.<br>
The mixture is then stirred at room temperature for 3 h. Subsequently, the reaction<br>
mixture is added to 21 of ice-water. The mixture is stirred for about 1 h and the<br>
precipitate is filtered off with suction, washed 3 times with in each case 150 ml of<br>
	water and then dried.<br>
Yield: 131 g (98.2% of theory), m.p. 101-102°C<br><br><br><br>
Example (I-c-2)<br><br><br><br>

The mixture is stirred at room temperature and the reaction is monitored by thin-layer chromatography.<br>
After the reaction has ended, the solvent is distilled off and the residue is washed twice with 500 ml of 0.5 N NaOH solution. The organic phase is dried, the solvent is distilled off and the residue is purified by column chromatography (silica gel, dichloromethane/ethyl acetate 3:1)<br>
Yield: 9.82 g (33% of theory), m.p. 159°C.<br>
The cis isomer (I-c-2) (9.82 g) obtained according to Process D is again purified by column chromatography on silica gel using dichloromethane/acetone 5:1.<br>
