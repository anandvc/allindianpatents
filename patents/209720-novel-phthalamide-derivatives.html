WO 96/37494, WO 98/25923),     .         as wells as preparations, which contain insecticidally active plant extracts, nema-todes, fungi or viruses.<br>
A mixture with other known active compounds, such as herbicides, or with fertilizers, growth regulators, safeners or semiochemicals is also possible.<br>
Further, the active compounds of the formula (I) of the present invention can exist also as a mixed agent with a synergist and such formulations and application forms<br><br><br>
can be mentioned as commercially useful. Said synergist itself must not be active, but is a compound that enhances the action of the active compound.<br>
The content of the active compounds of the formula (I) of the present invention in a<br>
 	commercially useful application form can be varied in a wide range.<br>
The concentration of the active compounds of the formula (I) of the present invention at the time of application can be, for example, in the range of 0.0000001 to 100 % by weight, preferably in the range of 0.00001 to 1 % by weight.  <br>
The compounds of the formula (I) of the present invention can be used by usual methods suitable to the application forms.<br>
In case of application against hygienic pests and stored grain  pests the active<br>
 	compounds of the present invention have a good stability against alkali on a calcific<br>
substance and further show an excellent residual effectiveness in wood and soil.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or<br>
 	those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast<br>
fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been<br>
 	explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are in each case commer¬<br>
cially available or in use are treated according to the invention. By plant cultivars are<br>
meant plants having new properties ("traits"), bred either by conventional breeding,<br>
 	by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They may be cultivars, biotypes<br>
and genotypes.<br><br><br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars. their location and growth<br>
conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the<br>
invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example,<br>
reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an<br>
increase in the activity of the substances and compositions to be used according to<br>
the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures,<br>
increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering<br>
performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better<br>
quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage<br>
 	stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the<br>
effects which were actually to be expected.<br><br><br><br>
Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CryDF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are increased defence of plants against fungi, bacteria and viruses by systematic acquired resistance (SAR), systemine, phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and corresponding expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotncin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), EMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these or still to be developed genetic traits, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with the compounds of the general formula (I) or the active compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds or mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or the mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br><br><br><br>
The active compounds according to the invention act not only against plant, hygiene<br>
and stored product pests, but also in the veterinary medicine sector against animal<br>
parasites (ectoparasites), such as hard licks, soft ticks, mange mites, leaf mites, flies<br>
(biting and licking), parasitic fly larvae, lice, hair lice, feather lice and fleas. These<br>

The active compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention are also suitable for controlling arthropods which infest agricultural productive livestock, such as, for<br>
 	example,   cattle,   sheep,  goats,   horses,   pigs,  donkeys,  camels,   buffalo,   rabbits,<br>
chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese and bees, other pets, such as, for example, dogs, cats, caged birds and aquarium fish, and also so-called test animals, such as, for example, hamsters, guinea pigs, rats and mice. By controlling these arthropods, cases of death and reduction in productivity (for meat, milk, wool, hides, eggs, honey etc.) should<br>
 	be diminished, so that more economic and easier animal husbandry is possible by use<br>
of the active compounds according to the invention.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are used in the veterinary sector in a known manner by enteral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, potions, drenches, granules, pastes, boluses, the feed-through process and suppositories, by parenteral administration, such as, for example, by injection (intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraperitoneal and the like), implants, by nasal administration, by dermal use in the form, for example, of dipping or bathing, spraying, pouring on and spotting on, washing and powdering, and also with the aid of moulded articles containing the active compound, such as collars, ear marks, tail marks, limb bands, halters, marking devices and the like.<br>
When used for cattle, poultry, pets and the like, the active compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention can be used as formulations (for example powders, emulsions, free-flowing compositions), which comprise the active compounds according to the invention in an amount of 1 to 80% by weight, directly or after 100 to 10 000-fold dilution, or they can be used as a chemical bath.<br><br><br>

Industrial materials in the present connection are to be understood as meaning non¬living materials, such as, preferably, plastics, adhesives, sizes, papers and cards, leather, wood and processed wood products and coating compositions.<br>
Wood and  processed wood products are materials to be protected, especially preferably, from insect infestation.<br>
Wood and processed wood products which can be protected by the agents according to the invention or mixtures comprising these are to be understood as meaning, for example:<br><br><br>
building timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, boat jetties, wooden vehicles, boxes, pallets, containers, telegraph poles, wood panelling, wooden window frames and doors, plywood, chipboard, joinery or wooden products which are used quite generally in house-building or in building joinery.  <br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used as such, in the form of concentrates or in generally customary formulations, such as powders, granules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
 	The formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example<br>
by mixing the active compounds according to the invention with at least one solvent or diluent,  emulsifier,  dispersing agent and/or binder or fixing agent,  a water repellent, if appropriate siccatives and UV stabilizers and if appropriate dyestuffs and pigments, and also other processing auxiliaries.  <br>
The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for the preservation of wood and wood-derived timber products comprise the active compound according to the invention in a concentration of 0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br><br>
The amount of the compositions or concentrates employed depends on the nature and<br>
occurrence of the insects and on the medium. The optimum amount employed can be<br>
determined for the use in each case by series of tests. In general, however, it is<br>
sufficient to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of<br>
 	the active compound, based on the material to be preserved.<br>
Solvents and/or diluents which are used are an organic chemical solvent or solvent<br>
mixture and/or an oily or oil-like organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture of low<br>
volatility and/or a polar organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water,<br>
 	and if appropriate an emulsifier and/or wetting agent.<br><br><br><br>
Organic chemical solvents which are preferably used are oily or oil-like solvents having an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably above 45°C. Substances which are used as such oily or oil-like water-insoluble solvents of low volatility are appropriate mineral oils or aromatic fractions thereof, or solvent mixtures containing mineral oils, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
Mineral oils having a boiling range from 170 to 220°C, white spirit having a boiling range from 170 to 220°C, spindle oil having a boiling range from 250 to 350°C, petroleum and aromatics having a boiling range from 160 to 280°C, terpentine oil and the like, are advantageously employed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons having a boiling range from 180 to 210°C or high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons having a boiling range from ISO to 220"C and-'or spindle oil and/or monochloronaphthalene, preferably a-monochloronaphthalene, are used.<br>
The organic oily or oil-like solvents of low volatility which have an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, can be replaced in part by organic chemical solvents of high or medium volatility, provided that the solvent mixture likewise has an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, and that the insecticide/fungicide mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, some of the organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture is replaced by an aliphatic polar organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture. Aliphatic organic chemical solvents containing hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups, such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters or the like, are preferably used.<br>
Organic chemical binders which are used in the context of the present invention are the synthetic resins and/or binding drying oils which are known per se, are water-<br><br><br>
dilutable and/or are soluble or dispersible or emulsifiable in the organic chemical solvents employed, in particular binders consisting of or comprising an acrylate resin, a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation or polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenolic resin, hydrocarbon resin, such as indene-coumarone resin, silicone resin, drying vegetable oils and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The synthetic resin used as the binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or solution. Bitumen or bituminous substances can also be used as binders in an amount of up to 10% by weight. Dyestuffs, pigments, water-repelling agents, odour correctants and inhibitors or anticorrosive agents and the like which are known per se can additionally be employed.<br>
It is preferred according to the invention for the composition or concentrate to comprise, as the organic chemical binder, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or a drying vegetable oil. Alkyd resins having an oil content of more than 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight, are preferably used according to the invention.<br>
All or some of the binder mentioned can be replaced by a fixing agent (mixture) or a plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent evaporation of the active compounds and crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of the binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers originate from the chemical classes of phthalic acid esters, such as dibutyl, dioctyl or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric acid esters, such as tributyl phosphate, adipic acid esters, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates, such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates, such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher molecular weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic acid esters.<br><br>
Fixing agents are based chemically on polyvinyl alkyl ethers, such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl ether or ketones, such as benzophenone or ethylenebenzophenone.<br>
Possible solvents or diluents are, in particular, also water, if appropriate as a mixture<br>
 	with one or more of the abovementioned organic chemical solvents or diluents,<br>
emulsifiers and dispersing agents.<br>
Particularly effective preservation of wood is achieved by impregnation processes on a large industrial scale, for example vacuum, double vacuum or pressure processes.  <br>
The ready-to-use compositions can also comprise other insecticides, if appropriate, and also one or more fungicides, if appropriate.<br>
Possible additional mixing partners are, preferably, the insecticides and fungicides mentioned in WO 94/29 268. The compounds mentioned in this document are an explicit constituent of the present application.<br>
Especially preferred mixing partners which may be mentioned are insecticides, such as chlorpyriphos, phoxim, silafluofin, alphamethrin, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, permethrin, imidacloprid, NI-25, flufenoxuron, hexaflumuron, transfluthrin, thiacloprid, mefhoxyfenozide and triflumuron,<br>

Fouling by sessile Oligochaeta, such as Serpulidae, and by shells and species from the Ledamorpha group (goose barnacles), such as various Lepas and Scalpellum species, or by species from the Balanomorpha group (acorn barnacles), such as Balanus or Pollicipes species, increases the frictional drag of ships and, as a consequence, leads to a marked increase in operation costs owing to higher energy consumption and additionally frequent residence in the dry dock.<br>
Apart from fouling by algae, for example Ectocarpus sp. and Ceramium sp., fouling<br>
by sessile Entomostraka groups, which come under the generic term Cirripedia<br>
 	(cirriped crustaceans), is of particular importance.<br>
