				<td>This invention relates to telephone billing In particular, the invention relates to a method of billing for<br>
use of a telephone. The invention also relates to a SIM card for connection to a telephone and to a<br>
telephone assembly which includes the SIM card. The invention extends to a set of SIM card<br>
executable instructions<br>
US 6332579 describes billing method in which a mobile telephone routinely communicates via<br>
telecommunication network with a server based billing engine to update time records and to upload tariff<br>
tables. But it was not known from US 6332579 that a user can provide his input on the manner of<br>
billing for a call and then terminate a call in accordance with such input.<br>
Prepaid mobile telephone billing is currently managed by a mobile operator. The equipment required to<br>
operate a payphone business using a cellular telephone operating on pre-paid airtime is bulky and<br>
costly, and often impractical.<br>
WO 0065859 discloses storing billing rates of multiple telephone networks on a SIM and allowing the<br>
user to select the network for making a call based on the call rates. But this document does not<br>
disclose calculating call cost while a call is in progress, terminating calls or any inputs from the user<br>
relating to the billing method apart from merely selecting the network.<br>
WO 9528062 discloses a partly SIM based billing method and does not allow further calls to be made if<br>
a balance stored in a SIM is too low. However, the document does not disclose calculating call cost<br>
while a call is in progress, terminating calls or any input from the user relating to the billing method,<br>
apart from merely selecting the network.<br>
In NOKIA 2100 call termination is implemented in the telephone itself and not on its SIM as in the present invention. In<br>
Nokia 2100 the termination of call is done by a firmware being supplied with the phone with very limited<br>
flexibility in setting other parameters and with no response to changes in call charging circumstances<br>
However this telephone does not have the facility of adjustment of numerous billing parameters such as<br>
using different charge rates for different callers, using different pulse rates etc as in the present<br>
invention<br>
The invention provides a method of billing for use of a telephone which has an electronic identification<br>
module, the method including storing on the identification module account information relating to a<br>
telephone account for use of the telephone, and automatically adjusting the account information in<br>
response to billable use of the telephone.<br>
In other words, the invention provides a telephone billing method in which billing is managed by an<br>
electronic identification module which is connectable to a telephone<br><br>
The identification module may be a Subscriber Identification module (SIM)<br>
card which is installed in a mobile telephone, such as a cellular telephone. The SIM<br>
card may comprise integrated circuitry which provides an electronic processor and<br>
memory means, so that the SIM card is programmable. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
SIM card is programmable by use of SIM application Toolkit.<br>
The term SIM card is meant to include any electronic module which is<br>
removably connectable to a telephone device for uniquely identifying itself to a<br>
telephone network.<br>
The method may thus include providing a set of computer readable<br>
instructions on the SIM card for enabling the SIM card to manage the account<br>
associated with the SIM card, when the set of instructions is executed.<br>
Storing account information on the SIM card may include storing on the<br>
SIM card an account balance for the account managed by the SIM card.<br>
The method may also include storing on the SIM card transaction<br>
information about individual telephonic transactions performed for the account on the<br>
SIM card. Such transaction information may include the duration of a particular billable<br>
event or telephone call, as well as the cost of each billable event.<br>
The account which is maintained on the SIM card may be a prepaid<br>
account, the SIM card thus being arranged to permit the making of telephonic<br><br><br>
transactions only if the account balance stored on the on SIM card is positive. The<br>
account information may thus include a balance of available credit, which may be in the<br>
format of a monetary value. The method may include automatically increasing or<br>
decreasing the account balance on the SIM card in response to additions and<br>
deductions to the account.<br>
The account which is managed by the SIM card may be a payphone<br>
account, the method including calculating the cost of each billable event by use of the<br>
SIM card and adjusting an account balance for that call accordingly. Preferably, the<br>
method includes specifying a cost limit for each billable event, and continually adjusting<br>
the available funds in the account balance for that event during progress of the event,<br>
the event preferably being ended automatically when the available funds in the event<br>
account balance are depleted.<br>
Instead, or preferably in addition, the method may include managing a<br>
network account by use of the SIM card, the network account having a network balance<br>
which is automatically adjusted during use of the telephone. It will be appreciated that<br>
the method defined above is particularly suited to use in providing a payphone service,<br>
as an owner, vendor or operator can permit customers to use the telephone, the cost of<br>
the billable events being calculated by the SIM card and an event account being<br>
managed for each billable event. Conveniently, the method may include permitting<br>
adjustment of billing rules on the event account, for use by customers.<br>
It will be appreciated that events which result in a reduction of the account<br>
balance on the SIM card typically include calls or messages which are made on the<br><br>
telephone against the account. The method may thus include continuously adjusting<br>
the account balance during the making of a telephone call, and automatically<br>
terminating the telephone call if the account balance is depleted.<br>
Use of the telephone on credit against the account may be permitted, so<br>
that telephone transactions are allowed when the account balance is negative.<br>
The method may include permitting a user to set a maximum charge<br>
and/or duration for a particular telephone call; tracking the charge and duration of the<br>
telephone call while it is in progress; and automatically terminating the telephone call<br>
when the maximum charge or duration is reached.<br>
The method may include receiving an update communication from a<br>
network operator, the update communication including information relating to the<br>
account which is maintained by the SIM card, and automatically changing the account<br>
information stored on the SIM card to reflect the update communication, if required.<br>
Preferably, such update communications between the network operator and the<br>
telephone are via an essentially wireless telephone network, such as a cellular<br>
telephone network, on which the telephone operates.<br>
The update communication may include information indicative of a deposit<br>
made against the account, the method including automatically increasing the account<br>
balance stored on the SIM card by an amount represented in the update<br>
communication. As mentioned above, the update communication is typically sent by an<br>
authorised sender such as, for example, a service provider linked to a bank. In use, a<br><br><br>
network subscriber will thus typically buy a certain amount of airtime for the SIM card<br>
account by paying a deposit at a bank or other authorised deposit receiving facility. In<br>
response, an update communication is automatically sent to the SIM card to authorise a<br>
corresponding increase in the SIM card account. It will be appreciated that all such<br>
communications with the SIM card may be encrypted, to inhibit fraudulent tampering<br>
with the account information on the SIM card. Preferably, the encryption is at network<br>
operator level.<br>
When a subscriber has paid a deposit for increasing the SIM card<br>
account, the update communication may be sent to the SIM card and the account<br>
balance on the SIM card updated in response thereto. The reception of the update<br>
communication and changing of the account information on the SIM card may occur<br>
without displaying notification thereof on the telephone. The method may include<br>
receiving a notification message from a wireless telephone network operator in respect<br>
of the update communication, and displaying the notification message on the telephone,<br>
the update communication being in the form of a telephonic text message.<br>
The method may include storing on the SIM card billing information<br>
comprising different billing rules for different billable events, each billing rule including<br>
billing parameters for the associated billable event. Such billing information may include<br>
information relating to billing of audio or data communications like, for example, voice<br>
calls or SMSs. The method may include billing voice calls as closely as possible to<br>
accepted telecommunications regulations by applying a split billing sliding scale.<br><br><br>
The SIM card may thus be programmed with separate billing rules for:<br>
local mobile network voice calls; non-local mobile network voice calls; local public<br>
landline network voice calls; international voice calls; free or reserved voice calls; and<br>
SMSs and other data communications.<br>
The method may include keeping track by the SIM card of the duration of<br>
any telephone call, and using the duration of the telephone call in combination with the<br>
billing parameters associated with the particular billable event to calculate the cost of<br>
the call.<br>
The method may include updating the billing information on the SIM card<br>
in response to receiving an update communication which contains information indicative<br>
of a change in billing information. It will be appreciated that billing rates vary from time<br>
to time, and that the billing information on the SIM card should preferably correspond to<br>
current billing rules applied by the telephone network.<br>
Each billing rule may include billing parameters which determine how<br>
billing is done for the associated billable event. The various billing rules may have<br>
common parameters, which typically include: an initial time unit; a cost of the initial time<br>
unit; a subsequent time unit; a cost of the subsequent time unit; number prefixes<br>
associated with different billing rules; and a data cost.<br>
The initial time unit may be measured in seconds and may define the<br>
duration of the first unit of the call. The cost of the initial time unit may be charged in<br>
response to the voice call being connected to a receiving entity. The subsequent time<br><br><br>
the first unit of the call.<br>
The billing information may include a plurality of number prefixes which<br>
are associated with respective billable events, the type of billable event which is<br>
performed automatically being identified by reading the number prefix of a call, billing<br>
parameters of the identified type of billable event being applied to the call. Each<br>
number prefix preferably comprises five digits or four digits and a '+' sign. The cost of<br>
time units may be recorded in the lowest or least common denominator of currency of<br>
the country concerned. In South Africa, for example, the cost may therefore be<br>
recorded in cents. The number prefixes may allow for different telephone number<br>
ranges. Thus the cost associated with a billing rule may vary according the number<br>
prefix with which the dialled telephone number corresponds.<br>
The method may include automatically identifying the type of billable event<br>
by reading the number prefix of a call, and applying the associated billing parameters to<br>
the billable event. The appropriate billing rule may thus be automatically applied to its<br>
corresponding call type to determine a cost associated with that call.<br>
The method may include displaying account information and/or transaction<br>
information on a telephone to which the SIM card is connected. The account<br>
information and/or the transaction information may be made available on a selection<br>
menu displayed on a display, means of the telephone. In use, a user of the telephone<br>
will thus be able to view the cost and/or duration of any call or other billable event<br><br><br>
immediately after making the call. The user will also be able to view on the display<br>
screen the current account balance on the SIM card.<br>
It will be appreciated that permitting immediate viewing of call costs<br>
facilitates use of a telephone connected to the SIM card as a payphone.<br>
The method may include keeping track, at network level, of use of the SIM<br>
card, to calculate a current account balance associated with the SIM card, the account<br>
balance stored on the SIM card being automatically periodically compared with the<br>
calculated account balance at network level, and the account being flagged if there is a<br>
substantial discrepancy between the calculated account balance at network level and<br>
the account balance stored on the SIM card.<br>
The invention extends to a SIM card which is configured for managing<br>
billing for use of a telephone to which the SIM card is, in use, connected.<br>
The SIM card may be programmable, the SIM card having a memory on<br>
which is stored:<br>
account information relating to a telephone account which is managed by the<br>
SIM card; and<br>
a set of instructions for automatically adjusting the account information in<br>
response to billable use of a telephone to which the SIM card is connected.<br><br><br>
In other words, the SIM card may be provided with a software application<br>
or program for management of an airtime account on the SIM card. The SIM card may<br>
conveniently be programmed with SIM application Toolkit (STK).<br>
Differently defined, the invention extends to a telephone SIM card which<br>
includes a set of instructions for managing billing for use of a telephone to which the<br>
SIM card is, in use, connected.<br>
The SIM card may be programmed to store thereon an account balance<br>
for the account managed by the SIM card, and automatically to increase or decrease<br>
the account balance in response to additions to or deductions from the account.<br>
The SIM card may be programmed to permit a user to set a maximum<br>
charge and/or duration for a telephone call, the SIM card being arranged continuously to<br>
keep track of the charge and/or duration of a telephone call during its progress, and<br>
automatically to terminate the telephone call when that telephone call reaches its pre-<br>
set maximum charge and/or duration.<br>
The SIM card may be arranged to manage a payphone account or event<br>
account by calculating the cost of each billable event by use of the SIM card and to<br>
adjust an event account balance accordingly. Preferably, the SIM card is configured to<br>
permit a use to a cost limit or maximum charge for each billable event, and continually<br>
to adjust the available funds in the account balance for that event during progress of the<br>
event, the SIM card typically being arranged to end a billable event automatically when<br>
the available funds in the event account balance are depleted.<br><br><br>
Instead, or preferably in addition, the SIM card may be arranged to<br>
manage a network account by use of the SIM card, the network account having a<br>
network balance which is automatically adjusted during use of the telephone. In such<br>
. case, the SIM card may be arranged to manage and store information regarding a<br>
network account and an event account. It will be appreciated that the SIM card defined<br>
above is particularly suited to use in providing a payphone service, as an owner, vendor<br>
or operator can permit customers to use the telephone against the event account, the<br>
cost of billable events being calculated by the SIM card and an event account being<br>
managed for each billable event. Conveniently, the SIM card may be arranged to<br>
permit adjustment of billing rules for charging against the event account.<br>
The SIM card may be programmed to generate and store transaction<br>
information about individual telephonic transactions performed for the account on the<br>
SIM card, the transaction information including the cost and/or duration of respective<br>
billable events.<br>
The SIM card may be arranged to manage a prepaid airtime account, the<br>
SIM card being programmed to check the account balance upon attempted initialisation<br>
of a billable event on a telephone connected to the SIM card, and to permit performance<br>
of the billable event only if the account balance is positive.<br>
The SIM card may also be arranged to increase the account balance in<br>
response to reception of an update or recharge communication from a network<br>
operator. In addition, the SIM card may be arranged to receive and to display on the<br><br><br>
telephone a message, typically an SMS message, advising a user that a particular<br>
amount has been added to the account balance.<br>
The SIM card may be configured for automatically terminating a telephone<br>
call which is in progress, when the account balance reaches a pre-determined minimum<br>
amount. This minimum amount will be zero in the case of a pre-paid account.<br>
The SIM card may have stored thereon billing information comprising<br>
different billing parameters for different billable events. The billing information may<br>
include billing parameters for billable events selected from the group comprising: local<br>
mobile network voice calls; non-local mobile network voice calls; local public landline<br>
network voice calls; international voice calls; free or reserved voice calls; and SMSs and<br>
other data communications.<br>
The memory of the SIM card may therefore conceptually be divided into<br>
account memory in which account information is stored, and billing memory in which<br>
billing information is stored.<br>
The SIM card may be arranged for updating the billing information thereon<br>
in response to reception of an update communication from a network operator.<br>
The SIM card may be programmed to permit selective display of the<br>
account information and the transaction information on a telephone to which the SIM<br>
card is connected.<br><br><br>
The invention extends further to a telephone assembly which includes:<br>
a telephone; and<br>
a SIM card as defined above, which is connected to the telephone for directing<br>
operation of the telephone.<br>
The telephone may be a mobile telephone, preferably being a cellular<br>
telephone (further referred to as a cellphone). The telephone typically operates on the<br>
GSM standard.<br>
An embodiment of the invention will now be further described, by way of<br>
example, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a system for telephone billing, the system<br>
including a telephone which has a SIM card in accordance with the invention;<br>

Figure 7 is a flow diagram of method steps performed by the SIM card of Figure<br>
1 to terminate a voice call.<br>
In Figure 1, reference numeral 10 generally indicates a system for<br>
performing a method of telephone billing in accordance with the invention, the telephone<br>
billing being managed by a SIM card 14 in accordance with the invention.<br>
The system 10 includes a cellphone 12 which is configured for use on a<br>
GSM-standard cellular telephone network 20. The network 20 includes network<br>
operators (not shown) which provide support services related to use of cellphones 12<br>
over the network 20. It will be appreciated that the system 10 includes a multitude of<br>
cellphones 12 which can communicate over the network 20, but that only one of the<br>
cellphones 12 are shown, for clarity of illustration.<br>
The cellphone 12 contains a SIM card 14 which serves to identify itself to<br>
the network 20, for controlling whether or not calls can be made by the cellphone 12 via<br>
the network 20. Such SIM cards are usually associated with particular subscribers, so<br>
that the network operator can establish for whose account the cellphone 12 is used.<br>
The SIM card 14 is programmable so that the cellphone 12 and the SIM card 14<br>
communicate in conventional fashion. It will be appreciated that the SIM card 14 is<br><br><br>
configured to initiate and control communication with an electronic processor and<br>
connected equipment of the cellphone 12, so that the SIM card 14 can control to an<br>
extent the applications run on the cellphone 12 and the information displayed on a<br>
display screen of the cellphone 12.<br>
The SIM card 14 has been pre-programmed with a set of instructions for<br>
managing an airtime account on the SIM card 14. The SIM card 14 thus includes a<br>
software application or program, schematically represented by numeral 14.1. In this<br>
example, the SIM card 14 is programmed with SIM application Toolkit (STK).<br>
The SIM card 14 has a memory arrangement which is configured to store<br>
account information in an account memory 14.2 and transaction information in a billing<br>
memory 14.3. The instructions of the program 14.1 relate to the processing of account<br>
information and transaction information. It should be appreciated that separate<br>
representation of the account memory 14.2 and the billing memory 14.3 is merely<br>
schematic, and that the account memory 14.2 and the billing memory 14.3 may be<br>
integral with the program 14.1.<br>
The account memory 14.2 on the SIM card 14 includes a pre-paid account<br>
balance, which indicates how much credit a user has with which to make telephone<br>
calls or send other communications, such as SMSs. It should be appreciated that<br>
although the SIM card 14 is programmed in this example to manage a pre-paid airtime<br>
account, the SIM card 14 can, in other embodiments, be arranged for managing any<br>
type of telephone account.<br><br><br>
The program 14.1 is arranged to increase the account balance in<br>
response to receiving an update or recharge communication from a network operator<br>
that a deposit has been made against the account managed on the SIM card 14. A<br>
user of the telephone 12 may choose to increase the balance by any convenient<br>
method, for example, by depositing money into an associated bank account (not<br>
shown). Once the user has chosen to increase the balance and taken the necessary<br>
steps, the cellphone 12 receives an update communidation via the network 20 indicating<br>
an amount by which the balance must be increased.<br>
The SIM card 14 then automatically, under the instructions of the program<br>
14.1, adds the indicated amount to the balance, and the resultant balance is stored in<br>
the account memory 14.2 on the SIM card 14. The process will be repeated for future<br>
balance increases.<br>
The update communication is received and processed by the telephone<br>
12 and the SIM card 14 without the user's knowledge. However, to alert the user to an<br>
increase in his account, an SMS is automatically sent by the network operator to the<br>
telephone 14. This text message informs the user that the balance has been increased<br>
and by what amount it has increased.<br>
The program 14.1 is further arranged to cause automatic reduction in the<br>
account balance in response to the performance of a billable event, such as a voice call<br>
or an SMS, on the telephone 12. The SIM card 14 thus calculates the cost of any call,<br>
while the call is being performed, and immediately adjusts the account balance. The<br>
cost of each call is calculated with reference to billing information which forms part of<br><br><br>
the transaction information stored on the SIM card in the billing memory 14.3. The<br>
billing information determines how charges are calculated and at what rates.<br>
In this example, the billing information includes six billing rules. These six<br>
rules are respectively associated with:<br>
local mobile network voice calls;<br>
non-local mobile network voice calls;<br>
local public landline network voice calls;<br>
international voice calls;<br>
free or reserved voice calls; and<br>
SMSs and other data communications.<br>
Each billing rule contains common parameters that may be assigned<br>
different values. The parameters are:<br>
an initial time unit;<br>
a cost of the initial time unit;<br>
a subsequent time unit;<br>
a cost of the subsequent time unit;<br>
number prefixes; and<br>
a data cost.<br>
All these parameters are assigned values depending on how the call is to<br>
be billed. The initial time unit is measured in seconds and defines duration of the first<br>
unit of the call. If the initial time unit is 30 seconds, the first 30 seconds of the call are<br>
included in the initial time unit. A cost is associated with the initial time unit, in this<br><br><br>
example being 180 cents. This means a call of 30 seconds or shorter is billed at 180<br>
cents. The cost of the initial time unit is charged in response an indication that the call<br>
is connected to a receiving entity.<br>
The subsequent time unit defines all units of time other than the initial unit.<br>
Therefore a subsequent time unit defines a second unit, a third unit, a fourth unit, and<br>
so forth. If a subsequent time unit is, for example, 60 seconds, the second unit of time<br>
will be from 30 seconds after the call was connected to 90 seconds after to call was<br>
connected. The subsequent time unit cost, typically being different from the cost of the<br>
initial time unit, is charged for each subsequent time unit. In this example, the<br>
subsequent time unit cost is 90 cents. This means a call of between 31 and 90 seconds<br>
will be billed at 270 cents (being the sum of the initial time unit, 180 cents, and one<br>
subsequent time unit, 90 cents).<br>
The cost of time units is recorded in the lowest common denominator, or<br>
least common denominator, of currency of the country concerned. In South Africa, for<br>
example, the cost will therefore be recorded In cents. For example, if the cost of a<br>
particular unit is R1.44, the system 10 will record the cost as 144.<br>
The SIM card 14 is thus programmed to calculate the total amount at<br>
which a call is billed with the formula:<br>
cost of initial time unit + cost of subsequent time unit * number of subsequent time units.<br><br><br>
The system 10 is programmed to bill voice calls as closely as possible to<br>
accepted telecommunications regulations by applying a split billing sliding scale<br>
principle known as 'initial call duration cost accumulating subsequent call duration cost'.<br>
The respective prefixes correspond to the format of dialling codes, and<br>
therefore contain either five digits or four digits and a '+' sign. Different billing rules will<br>
include different number prefixes. The billing rule for local mobile network voice calls,<br>
for example, contains number prefixes that correspond with mobile network operators in<br>
the location where the cellphone 12 is used. The billing rule governing international<br>
voice calls includes international dialling prefixes, for example 09264 (the international<br>
dialling code from South Africa to Namibia). The SIM card 14 is programmed to<br>
determine when an international call is being made, and will automatically charge in<br>
accordance with the corresponding billing rule, which will thus automatically bill the call<br>
at higher rate than for a local call. Ideally any particular number prefix is associated<br>
with only one particular billing rule.<br>
In a similar manner, the data cost parameter, which forms part of the<br>
billing information stored on the billing memory 14.3, is used to bill for data<br>
communications, such as SMSs.<br>
The program 14.1 on the SIM card 14 is further arranged to cause display<br>
of account information and transaction information on the display screen of the<br>
cellphone 12. In this example, the information is accessible via a selection menu<br>
displayed on the screen, the user being able to select, desired items for display by<br>
operation of the cellphone's keypad. The user will thus, at any time, be able to select<br><br><br>
for viewing the current account details, which includes the latest account balance. The<br>
user will also be able to view the transaction details, particularly the duration and the<br>
cost of calls made.<br>
Figures 2 to 7 show, schematically, the process steps performed by the<br>
SIM card 14, in use, when the telephone 12 is used. Figure 2 is a flow diagram of a<br>
sub-program for sending an SMS. To send and SMS the user, in conventional fashion,<br>
keys the text message in on the keypad of the cellphone 12 and attempts to send the<br>
SMS. The SIM card 14 is programmed to choose the appropriate billing rule from the<br>
billing memory 14.3, which will be the rule governing SMSs and other data costs. The<br>
only parameter that is pertinent to this rule is the data cost, being the cost of a single<br>
data communication. An SMS send event is thus initiated, at block 31, after which the<br>
SIM card 14 compares, at block 32, the balance in the account information 14.2 with the<br>
data cost. If the balance is greater than or equal to the data cost, the user has sufficient<br>
credit to send an SMS. The data cost is then deducted, at block 33, from the account<br>
balance and the resultant balance is stored in the account memory 14.2 on the SIM<br>
card 14. The SMS is allowed, at block 34, and is sent in conventional fashion. The<br>
SMS send event, at block 31, ends, at block 36.<br>
If, however, the available balance is smaller than the data cost, the user<br>
does not have sufficient credit to send an SMS. The SMS attempt is barred, at block<br>
35, and the SMS send event ends, at block 36.<br>
Figure 3 is a flow diagram of a sub-program for initiating a voice call. To<br>
make a call, the user, in conventional fashion, keys in the number to dial, or selects it<br><br><br>
from a list. The user enters an amount (further referred to a change amount) which<br>
represents the maximum amount for the cost of the call. The user then attempts to<br>
initiate a voice call, at block 39. The SIM 14 card determines, at block 40, whether or<br>
not it has received on override command. If it has received such a command, at branch<br>
40.1, it allows the call attempt to proceed, at block 41, and ends the sub-program at<br>
block 80. If there was no override command, at branch 40.2, the SIM card 14<br>
determines, at block 42, whether or not there is already a call in progress. If there is a<br>
call in progress, at branch 42.1, the call attempt is blocked, at block 43, and the sub-<br>
program ends at block 80.<br>
If there is not a call in progress, at branch 42.2, the SIM card 14<br>
determines, at block 44, whether or not it has received a USSD (Unstructured<br>
Supplementary Service Data) command. If it has received such a command, at branch<br>
44.1, it allows, the call attempt to proceed, at block 45, and ends the sub-program at<br>
block 80.<br>
If there was no USSD command, at branch 44.2, the SIM card 14<br>
determines, at block 46, whether or not the dialled number was found. If the dialled<br>
number was not found, at branch 46.1, the call attempt is blocked, at block 47, and ends<br>
the sub-program, at block 80. If the dialled number is found, at branch 46.2, the SIM<br>
card 14 converts the dialled number to an ASCII (American Standard Code for<br>
Information Interchange) format, at block 48.<br><br><br>
Variables representing the total charge and total duration of the call are<br>
assigned the value of zero respectively, at block 50. The SIM card 14 determines, at<br>
block 52, whether or not the change amount in the account memory 14.2 is equal to<br>
zero. At any stage, the change amount reflects the remainder of the amount set by the<br>
user before he initiated the voice call. If the change amount is equal to zero, at branch<br>
52.1, it means that the user failed to set an amount, and the screen of the cellphone 12<br>
displays the error message 'Please set an amount first' for four seconds, at block 54. It<br>
is to be appreciated that any convenient duration for the error message display could be<br>
used, four seconds being a duration which allows the user to read the message but<br>
does not freeze the cellphone 12 for too long. The call attempt is blocked, at block 56,<br>
and the sub-program comes to an end, at block 80.<br>
If the change amount is not equal to zero, at branch 52.2, the user has<br>
entered a maximum amount for the call, and the SIM card 14 compares, at block 58,<br>
the number prefix of the dialled number with all the number prefixes in all the billing<br>
rules of the billing memory 14.3. Typically, an operator of a payphone business<br>
receives a cash deposit from a customer and then sets the maximum charge or change<br>
amount on the telephone 12 to equal the deposit. During a call, the change amount is<br>
continually decremented until the change amount is depleted. The SIM card 14 selects<br>
the billing rule associated with the first number prefix which matches the number prefix<br>
of the dialled number. That billing rule is then selected as the billing rule that is<br>
applicable to the voice call. If an appropriate billing rule, at block 60, was not found, at<br>
branch 60.2, the call attempt is blocked, at block 56, and the sub-program comes to an<br>
end, at block 80. In other words, if no match was found, the number prefix does not<br>
appear in any billing rule and hence is not an allowed number. If, however, a match for<br><br><br>
the prefix is found, at branch 60.2, it means that the number prefix of the dialled number<br>
does occur in a number prefix of a billing rule. For example, if a user in South Africa<br>
dials a number in Namibia, the system 10 is programmed to compare the number prefix,<br>
which will be 09264. A match may be found, depending on the configuration, in the<br>
international voice calls billing rule, and that rule would be applicable. The parameters<br>
associated with the applicable billing rule will be the parameters applied to the voice<br>
call.<br>
The SIM card 14 compares, at block 62, the change amount with the cost<br>
of the first time unit associated with the applicable billing rule. If the change amount is<br>
smaller than the cost of the first time unit, at branch 62.1, the screen of the cellphone 12<br>
displays the error message 'Please set an amount first' for four seconds, at block 64,<br>
blocks the call attempt, at block 66, and the sub-program comes to an end, at block 80.<br>
If the change amount is greater than or equal to the cost of the first time<br>
unit, then the SIM card 14 compares, at block 68, the balance in the account information<br>
14.2 with the cost of the first time unit associated with the applicable billing rule. If the<br>
balance is smaller than the cost of the first time unit, at branch 68.1, the user has<br>
insufficient credit to initiate a voice call. The screen of the cellphone 12 displays the<br>
error message 'Low balance' for four seconds, at block 70, and the call attempt is<br>
blocked, at block 66, and the sub-program comes to an end, at block 80.<br>
If, however, the balance is greater than or equal to the cost of the first time<br>
unit, at branch 68.2, the user has enough credit to initiate the call, and the dialled<br>
number is then compared to a list of barred numbers in the billing memory 14.3, at block<br><br><br>
74. if the dialled number corresponds to a barred number, at branch 74.1, the screen of<br>
the cellphone 12 displays the error message 'Barred number' for four seconds, at block<br>
76, and the call attempt is blocked, at block 66, and the sub-program comes to an end,<br>
at block 80. If the dialled number does not correspond to a barred number, at branch<br>
74.2, the call attempt is allowed to proceed, at block 78, and the sub-program ends at<br>
block 80. If, at any stage, the call attempt is blocked, the process ends when the<br>
current sub-program ends. If however, to call attempt was allowed, the process<br>
continues to the next sub-program.<br>
Figure 4 shows a flow diagram of a sub-program for calculating the call<br>
costs of a voice call during the first time unit. The sub-program is automatically<br>
executed after the sub-program of Figure 3 if the call attempt was allowed to proceed<br>
and not blocked. The SIM card 14 waits for the call to be connected, at block 82. If the<br>
call did not connect, at branch 82.1. the call ends, at block 66.<br>
If, however, the call did connect, at branch 82.2, a timer is assigned the<br>
same value as the initial time unit, at block 83, and the timer is started, at block 84. The<br>
term timer In this context is understood to mean a variable that counts down at a set<br>
rate, starting at a defined number and ending at zero. The cost of the first time unit is<br>
added to the variable representing the total charge, at block 85. It will be appreciated<br>
that because the variable representing the total charge was zero, said variable will now<br>
be equal to the cost of the.first time unit. The SIM card 14 is programmed to wait for the<br>
timer to reach zero. When the timer does reach zero, the first time unit has ended, and<br>
the sub-program terminates, at block 66.<br><br><br>
Figure 5 and Figure 6 are flow diagrams of sub-programs for calculating<br>
the cost of a voice call during subsequent time units. The sub-program of Figure 5 is<br>
automatically executed, at block 87, when the timer which was started in the previous<br>
sub-program reaches zero.<br>
The SIM card 14 determines, at block 88, whether or note the current<br>
iteration of the sub-program is a billing event in which the duration of the event<br>
determines its cost. If it is not, at branch 88.1, a message is displayed on the screen of<br>
the cellphone 12, at block 89, the message being selected from a message indication<br>
set. The message indication set includes the following messages:<br>
'Low balance';<br>
'Number barred';<br>
'No number found';<br>
'Consecutive call not allowed'; and<br>
'Please set amount'.<br>
If, however, the current iteration is a timer billing event, at branch 88.2, it is<br>
determined, at block 90, whether or not the remaining balance in the account memory<br>
14.2 is greater than or equal to the cost of a subsequent call unit. If the balance is not<br>
greater than or equal to the cost of a subsequent call unit, at branch 90.1, it means that<br>
there is not enough credit remaining to pay for the next call unjt, and the SIM card 14<br>
issues the AT+CHUP command (a standard hang-up command) to the cellphone 12, to<br>
terminate the call. If the balance is greater than or equal to the cost of a subsequent<br><br><br>
call unit, at branch 90.2, it is determined, at block 92, whether or not the change amount<br>
is greater than or equal to the cost of a subsequent call unit. If it is not, at branch 92.1,<br>
the user has spent all the money which he wanted to spend on the call, and the<br>
AT+CHUP command is issued to the cellphone 14 to terminate the call. If it is greater<br>
than the cost of a subsequent time unit, at branch 92.2, the timer is set to the<br>
subsequent call unit duration, at block 94.<br>
The cost of a subsequent call unit is then charged, at block 96 (see Figure<br>
6 for more detail).<br>
At block 98, the SIM card 14 issues the AT+CPAS command to the<br>
cellphone 12 to determine, at block 100, whether the cellphone 12 is on the hook or<br>
whether it is off the hook. If the cellphone 12 is on the hook, at branch 100.1, it means<br>
that the call has ended, and the sub-program ends at block 104. If the cellphone 12 is<br>
off the hook, at branch 100.2, the SIM card 14 issues the AT+CHUP command to<br>
terminate the phone call, at block 102, and the sub-program ends, at block 104.<br>
Referring now to Figure 6, the flow diagram shows a sub-program for<br>
charging the cost of a subsequent time unit. The sub-program is initiated by block 96 of<br>
the sub-program of Figure 5, and starts at block 110. It is determined, at block 112,<br>
whether or not the total call duration is greater than a duration threshold. The duration<br>
threshold is a timer used to track the time spent on a call and thereby monitor the<br>
duration of the call. If it is not, at branch 112.1, the duration of a subsequent call unit is<br>
added to the total call duration, at block 122. If the total call duration is not greater than<br><br><br>
the duration threshold, at branch 112.2, the cost of a subsequent time unit is added to<br>
the total' call charge, at block 114, subtracted from the balance, at block 116, and<br>
subtracted from the change amount, at block 118. The duration of a subsequent call<br>
unit is then added to the duration threshold, at block 120, and added to the total call<br>
duration, at block 122. The sub-program then ends, at block 124.<br>
It is to be appreciated that the sub-program of Figure 6 will have as many<br>
iterations as there are subsequent call units.<br>
Figure 7 shows a flow diagram of a sub-program for terminating a voice<br>
call, the sub-program being automatically executed, at block 130, when the call is<br>
ended. At block 132, the SIM card 14 determines whether or not the call did indeed<br>
disconnect. If it did not, at branch 132.1, the sub-program ends, if it did, at branch<br>
132.2, the screen of the cellphone 12 displays, at block 134, the message 'Last call<br>
charge: x' where x is the charge of the last call, for four seconds, and sets call ended<br>
state flags<br>
There are three call ended state flags which respectively are called 'call<br>
control in progress', timer do count', and 'continue call make' and are used to track the<br>
status of the call. The 'call control in progress' flag indicates whether the user may view<br>
the menu, or whether a call is in progress in which case viewing of the menu is<br>
disabled. This avoids the user interfering with the billing process of the current call.<br>
The 'timer do count' flag indicates whether the timer on the next timer event should<br>
restart in preparation for that timer event or whether the timer should not start another<br><br><br>
timer eve . The 'continue call make' flag indicates whether a call attempt may be<br>
allowed or whether to block the call attempt and bar the call.<br>
It is determined whether or not a certain trigger level is reached, at block<br>
136. The trigger level is a preset variable which indicates when to send an SMS to a<br>
predefined telephone number to indicate that the value of the transactions (that is, voice<br>
calls and SMSs) on the cellphone has reached that trigger level.<br>
If the trigger level was not reached, at branch 136.1, the sub-program<br>
ends, at block 140. If the trigger level was reached, at branch 136.2, an SMS is sent, at<br>
block 138, to a predefined number as a notification. The sub-program then terminates,<br>
at block 140.<br>
The SIM card 14 provides the cellphone 12 with menu options (not shown)<br>
for allowing the user to view information relating to the pre-paid alrtime account at any<br>
time. To view Information, an option entitled 'Sharedfone' on the menu of the cellphone<br>
12 is selected in conventional fashion. Selecting the 'Sharedfone' option displays four<br>
sub-options that the user may select.<br>
The first sub-option is entitled 'Call charge'. When selected, this sub-<br>
option displays information relating to calls that the user has made, comprising:<br>
the total charge of a call;<br>
the duration of that call; and<br><br><br>
the number that was dialled.<br>
The second sub-option is entitled 'Change'. When selected, this sub-<br>
option displays the amount remaining from the initial amount entered before the phone<br>
call was made or the SMS was sent, the amount being the difference between the initial<br>
amount entered and the cost of the phone call made or the SMS sent.<br>
The third sub-option is entitled 'Balance'. When selected, this sub-option<br>
displays the current balance available to the<br>
The fourth sub-option is entitled 'Purse Manager'. An owner PIN<br>
(personal identification number) must be entered into the phone to access this option.<br>
Once the owner PIN is entered, the user may view a further sub-menu which provides<br>
five further sub-options (referred to as purse manager sub-options).<br>
The first purse manager sub-option is entitled 'Sales total'. When<br>
selected, this purse manager sub-option displays information relating to units which<br>
have been used.<br>
The second purse manager sub-option is entitled 'Clear sales total'.<br>
When selected, this purse manager sub-option resets to zero the running total of units<br>
which have been used.<br><br><br>
The third purse manager sub-option is entitled 'Set postpay'. When<br>
selected, this purse manager sub-option sets the mode of operation to 'postpay' model.<br>
The 'postpay' model does not require the user to set a change amount before a call and<br>
will deduct the cost of the call from the balance in the same manner as if a change<br>
amount had been set first. This option is convenient for allowing users to make calls on<br>
credit.<br>
The fourth purse manager sub-option is entitled 'Change PIN'. This purse<br>
manager sub-option is used by the user to change the owner PIN. When selected, the<br>
user is prompted to enter the current owner PIN, and, if correctly entered, the user is<br>
prompted to enter a new owner PIN and is then prompted to confirm the new owner PIN<br>
by entering it again. If the new owner PIN is correctly confirmed, it will be set as the<br>
owner PIN.<br>
The fifth purse manager sub-option is entitled 'Set profits'. When<br>
selected, this purse manager sub-option is used by the user to change the billing cost<br>
and time duration of categories of billing rates. Each billing category defines a set of<br>
dialled number prefixes and the time duration and cost associated with calls made to<br>
phone numbers starting with one of the dialled number prefixes.<br>
It is to be appreciated that the use of the telephone 12 is billed by the SIM<br>
card 14 at network rates. However, the operator or owner of the telephone can set a<br>
rate or duration of time units at which the user's customers are charged.<br><br><br>
The applicant believes that this invention provides an advantageous<br>
method of telephone billing, especially in the payphone industry. The embodiment of<br>
the invention described above allows virtual prepaid networks to operate on existing<br>
GSM networks. The cost of entry of new businesses is reduced as no complex billing<br>
and administrative infrastructures are required.<br>
An airtime vendor can thus sell airtime on the cellphone 12, receiving<br>
payment from clients for use of the cellphone 12. As the cost and duration of each<br>
transaction is immediately displayed, there is no need for the vendor to keep track of the<br>
duration of the calls and to calculate the cost of individual calls. The vendor also has<br>
the option of setting a maximum cost of a telephone call, so that the call automatically<br>
ends when the pre-set cost is reached. It will be appreciated that the SIM card's<br>
program 14 is arranged to permit adjustment by a vendor of the call rate at which<br>
airtime is sold on the cellphone 12 as described above, so that the vendor's profit<br>
margin will be determined by the difference between the cost of airtime paid to the<br>
network, and the price at which airtime is sold. In such case, the maximum cost of the<br>
call, which is set by the vendor, is calculated at the cost rate adjusted by the vendor,<br>
while the account balance is adjusted at network rates.<br>
The need for vouchers is eliminated as recharge deposits can be made<br>
directly to a bank account. A more effective means for informal GSM payphone<br>
operators, especially in developing countries, is provided, as no specialised payphone<br>
equipment, apart from the SIM card 14, is required to run a payphone business.<br><br><br>
