(SECTION 10)<br>
TITLE : AN ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION CURABLE INK COMPOSITION FOR INKJET APPLICATION ON THE PAINTED AUTOMOTIVE PARTS OR PAINTED POLYMER AUTOMOTIVE SUBSTRATES FOR DECORATION AND TEXT PRINTING PURPOSE WITH CLEAR TOPCOAT.<br>
APPLICANT   : KANSAI NEROLAC PAINTS LTD.,<br>
a Company registered under the Companies Act, 1956 having address at Nerolac House, Ganpatrao Kadam Marg, Lower Parel, Mumbai -400 013, India. Indian National<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an UV curable composition which exhibits a relative low viscosity and is curable at a high sensitivity, forming a coating of superior adhesion and hardness, and its use on the base coat painted automotive parts which are lacquered by conventional taping lacquer. The invention concerns coatings curable by ultraviolet radiation, which may be printed on to polymer substrates to provide a thermal drop-on-demand ink-jet receptive layer.<br>
Radiation curable ink compositions that include a curable component having a functionality that is greater than two, is present in the ink composition in an amount greater than 50 percent 6y weight, ana' has a molecular  weight in the range of about 400 g/mole to about 10,000 g/mole; a component that has a functionality that is less than or equal to 2; and an initiator component. A solvent component, pigment, a surface tension modifier and other materials also can be included. The radiation curable inks are employed in ink jet printers and are particularly suited for use in printing on large-scale substrates. The printed images described herein have good adhesion to polymeric substrates such as styrene-based, polycarbonates, polyolefins, polyethylene terephthalate glycol ester, acryliC and others.<br>
A composition of an ultraviolet light curable jettable ink which includes a colorant, a photoinitiating system, and monomers and flow additives used for printing onto the painted automotive base coat for decoration purpose and exposing the marking to ultraviolet radiation after at least two second.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In general, ink containing a substantial amount of organic liquids would produce undesirable emissions during the printing process. such emissions are substantially avoided, however, with energy curable inks. Energy curable inks use low viscosity<br><br>
reactive materials to attain the desired viscosity. The reactive materials have reactive groups that are cured after printing with radiation, such as UV radiation or electron beams.<br>
First, faster cure times offer substantial economic benefits. Furthermore, heat sensitive materials can be safely coated and cured with UV light without thermal degradation of heat sensitive substrates. Additionally, UV light is a relatively low cost of energy due to its widespread availability.<br>
Advantages of UV curable inks:<br>
Faster cure time offers substantial economic benefits.<br>
Heat sensitive material can be safely coated and cured with UV light without thermal<br>
degradation of heat sensitive substrates.<br>
Additionally UV light is a low cost of energy due to its widespread availability.<br>
Radiation curable inks are printed onto numerous substrates, both rigid and flexible. These include polymeric substrates, such as various types of PVC as well as polystyrene (usually modified), polycarbonate, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), polyolefines, polyesters, and others. The appearance of the printed image is affected by "jettable" characteristics of the ink, such as ink viscosity, droplet formation, satellite formation, drying or curing time and other properties that relate to the ejection of the ink from the print head, droplet travel and impact onto substrate.<br>
The low viscosity reactive materials in energy curable inks may include monoethylenically and polyethylenically unsaturated monomers and oligomers. The energy curable inks may also include unreactive oligomers and polymers. Because monofunctional monomers are particularly low in viscosity, ink jet inks to date have included substantial amounts of monofunctional monomers.<br><br>
Therefore, a need continues to exist for radiation-curable ink compositions that adhere well to multiple substrates, form printed images having good appearance, improved hardness and good flexibility and that are capable of withstanding outdoor weather conditions.<br>
The invention generally relates to radiation-curable ink compositions for inkjet printing, to methods for using them and to printed displays produced by curing the ink compositions on a substrate. In one embodiment, the invention is directed to radiation-curable ink compositions for inkjet printing on multiple substrates.<br>
Prior art:<br>
Ink-jet printing is a technique which puts a number of constraints on the nature of the ink which is used. These constraints include low viscosity (usually less than 50 cP or, for continuous operation, less than 10 cP at 25.degree. C), sufficient surface tension that the jet can produce the necessary large number of small droplets, and (at least for continuous operation) sufficient conductivity that the droplets can be directed as desired onto a substrate to be printed. The ink must be a homogeneous liquid capable of rapid conversion to a dry printed area on the substrate.<br>
Inks for use in piezoelectric drop-on-demand ink-jet printing traditionally comprise a mixture of fatty acids, fatty esters and oil-soluble dyes. Such inks should be slow-drying, to prevent clogging of the nozzles; this constraint results in the process being suitable only for surfaces where the ink may dry through absorption On non-absorbent surfaces, the ink remains wet for an undesirably long period of time. Ink compositions available in market are composed of different monomers, oligomers, pigments, additives and photoinitiators. These compositions tried for printing with inkjet printing machine. These inks found to be inferior in terms of curing, consistency in printing. The printed images have poor water resistant, have poor flexibility characteristics as well as hardness of these images is found to be not up to the mark.<br><br>
In some cases curing of the inks is not possible even after changing different line conditions of the printing process.<br>
These UV ink compositions are costlier than the described invention. Hence we can get economical advantage with the better performance properties.<br>
Comparable study of performance properties is given in the table no.1<br>
Ink compositions of the invention are compatible with ink jet printing systems, in particular systems designed to produce logos and text art displays. They have favorable dot gain characteristics and result in good quality printed images that exhibit good adherence to many of the substrates being used in outdoor displays. In addition, the printed images are water resistant, have good flexibility characteristics as well as improved hardness,<br>
The invention further provides an ink jet printing method in which an ink jet printer prints the ink jet ink of the invention onto a substrate which is base coat painted metal parts. The use of this UV curable ink is for decoration i.e. printing of company logos and text for decoration purpose.<br>
For example : US patent 6,593,390 describes development of a radiation curable ink jet ink which is essentially free of non-reactive diluent and yet has the desired viscosity, surface tension, volatility, stability and drying rate and produces print of acceptable quality. Inks according to the invention thus can be printed without difficulty from ink jet printers to give good quality print on a variety of substrates including such disparate materials as paper and non-adsorbent materials e.g. metal. They are of particular interest, however, in printing on plastics which are difficult to print on, e.g. polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene<br><br>
The inks may be employed for printing on to a wide variety of substrates, both absorbent and non-absorbent including paper, glass, plastic and metal, e.g. steel, copper and aluminium, but claimed that suitable for printing on to plastics to provide a strongly bonded print of good definition and optical density, especially if the surface to be printed is pre-treated e.g. by flame, plasma etch or corona treatment to raise the surface energy.<br>
US patent 7365105: The patent describes radiation curable ink compositions and applications thereof. The radiation curable ink gives the printed images described herein have good adhesion to polymeric substrates such as styrene-based, polycarbonates, polyolefins, polyethylene terephthalate glycol ester, acrylic and others.<br>
But these ink compositions are found to be inferior on the base coat painted metal parts. For white ink consistency of printing and curing is found to be inferior. For black ink curing of print is inferior. Over this UV cured printed layer thermosetting acrylic or polyester based topcoat is applied. It is found that inter coat adhesion of base coat, printing layers and acrylic or polyester based topcoat is poor. This ink composition is found to be working well only on plastic parts.<br>
These prior art difficulties are overcome by new novel ink composition which is suitable for base coat (acrylic, alkyd, polyester) painted metal parts as well as on the plastic parts. In addition to good substrate adhesion, the inks adhere to one another when printed in layers.<br>
Over this UV cured printed layer thermosetting acrylic or polyester based topcoat is applied. It is found that inter coat adhesion of base coat, printing layers and acrylic or polyester based topcoat is better.<br><br>
Present Process of application of stickers on automotive parts:<br><br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide new radiation curable composition of radiation curable ink for printing on the base coat painted automotive parts. This radiation curable ink with relatively low viscosity and high curing sensitivity, capable of forming a strong and soft film even under various environments.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide new UV curable ink for inkjet printing on painted automotive parts or painted polymer automotive substrates for decoration and text printing purpose with clear topcoat over it with better hardness as well as flexibility to provide proper adhesion to the base coat painted substrate as well as with the top coat layer.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Conventionally decorative text is applied by application of stickers on the different different substrates including metal, plastic, paper.<br>
The structural composition of the sticker then we can find different layers of the paper and plastic material. When we apply sticker on any substrate only printed part is utilized for application. After application of this remaining plastic coverings of the sticker are thrown away. This will be non value added waste to the environment.<br>
Disadvantages of stickers:<br>
•	Costlier.<br>
•	Generates Paper and Mastic waste.<br>
•	Requirement of skilled person for application.<br>
Advantages of Inkjet printing<br>
•	As a system Less costlier than stickers.<br>
•	Environment friendly Process as there is no generation of paper and plastic wastes.<br>
•	Customized process hence less chances of errors.<br>
By making use of radiation curable ink -jet ink is utilized for ink jet application on the painted automotive parts or painted polymer automotive substrates for Decorative image and text printing purpose with clear topcoat over it.<br>
Composition of Radiation curable ink:<br>
This radiation curable ink is divided in to two parts:<br>
1)	UV curable clear ink base :<br>
2)	Colourant dispersed in monomers or oligomers:<br><br>
The radiation curable ink-jet ink and the radiation curable liquid layer contain monomers and/or oligomers, which are polymerized by the curing means of the inkjet printer. Monomers, oligomers or prepolymers may possess different degrees of functionality, and a mixture including combinations of mono-, di-, tri- and higher functionality monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may be used. These components are curable, typically photo-curable, e.g. UV curable, and should adhere to the ink-receiver surface after printing and serve to bind the colorant. A mixture of two or more monomers of the same functionality is preferred, with particularly preferred a mixture of two di-functional monomers.<br>
The viscosity of the radiation curable ink-jet ink and the radiation curable liquid layer can be adjusted by varying the ratio between the monomers and oligomers.<br>
Any method of conventional radical polymerization, photo-curing system using photo acid or photo base generator, or photo induction alternating copolymerization may be employed. In general, radical polymerization and cationic polymerization are preferred, and photo induction alternating copolymerization needing no initiator may also be employed. Furthermore, a hybrid system of combinations of these systems is also effective.<br>

Photo-Initiators :<br>
A catalyst called a photo-initiator typically initiates the polymerization reaction. The photo-initiator requires less energy to activate than the monomers and oligomers to form the polymer. The photo-initiator suitable for use in the radiation curable ink-jet ink and the radiation curable liquid layer may be a Norrish type I initiator, a Norrish type II initiator or a photo-acid generator.<br>
The photo-initiator absorbs light and is responsible for the production of free radicals or cations. Free radicals or cations are high-energy species that induce polymerization of monomers, oligomers and polymers and with polyfunctional monomers and oligomers thereby also inducing cross-linking.<br>

initiator is selected from the group consisting of an aliphatic amine, an aromatic<br>
amine and a thiol. Tertiary amines, heterocyclic thiols and 4-dialkylamino-benzoic<br>
acid are particularly preferred as co-initiator. Specific examples of photo-initiators<br>

phosphineoxide, Bis{2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphineoxide, Polymeric Aminobenzoate Derivative Polymeric Benzophenone Derivative, Polymeric Thioxanthone Derivative<br>
Inhibitors :<br>
Suitable polymerization inhibitors include phenol type antioxidants, hindered amine light stabilizers, phosphor type antioxidants, hydroquinone monomethyl ether commonly used in (meth)acrylate monomers, and hydroquinone, t-butylcatechol, pyrogallol may also be used. Of these, a phenol compound having a double bond in molecules derived from acrylic acid is particularly preferred due to its having a polymerization-restraining effect even when heated in a closed, oxygen-free environment. Suitable inhibitors are, for example, Sumilizer.TM. GA-80, Sumilizer.TM. GM and Sumilizer.TM. GS produced by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd, and Genorad.TM.16, Genorad.TM.18 available from Rahn of Zurich, Switzerland.<br>
Since excessive addition of these polymerization inhibitors will lower the ink sensitivity to curing, it is preferred that the amount capable of preventing polymerization be determined prior to blending. The amount of a polymerization inhibitor is generally between 1-20 % of the total ink weight or the total link composition.<br>
Furthermore, the radiation curable ink-jet ink and the radiation curable liquid layer may also contain polymerizable oligomers. Examples of these polymerizable oligomers include epoxy acrylates, aliphatic urethane acrylates, aromatic urethane acrylates, polyester acrylates, and straight-chained acrylic oligomers.<br><br>
Colorants :<br>
Colorants may be dyes, but are preferably pigments or a combination thereof. Organic and/or inorganic pigments, pigments dispersion pastes may be used.<br>
The pigment particles should be sufficiently small to permit free flow of the ink through the inkjet printing device, especially at the ejecting nozzles which usually have a diameter ranging from 10 .mu.m to 50 .mu.m. The particle size influences also the pigment dispersion stability. It is also desirable to use small particles for maximum colour strength. The particles of the pigment dispersed in the ink-jet ink should have a particle size of less than 10 .mu.m, preferably less than 3 .mu.m, and most preferably less than 1 .mu.m. The average particle size of pigment particles is preferably 0.05 to 0.5 .mu.m.<br>

Dyes can only manifest the ideal colour in an appropriate range of pH value. Therefore, the radiation curable ink-jet ink preferably further comprises a pH buffer, such as potassium hydroxide (KOH).<br>
Resins :<br>
The radiation curable ink-jet ink and the radiation curable liquid layer may further contain a resin, also called a pigment stabilizer or dispersant used to obtain a stable dispersion of the pigment(s) in the inkjet ink.<br>
The pigments may be added to the radiation curable ink-jet ink as a dispersion comprising a dispersant.<br>
Suitable resins: petroleum type resins (e.g., styrene type, acryl type, polyester, polyurethane type, phenol type, butyral type, cellulose type, and rosin); and thermoplastic resins (e.g., vinyl chloride, vinylacetate type). Concrete examples of these resins include acryiate copolymers, styrene-acrylate copolymers, acetalized and incompletely saponified polyvinyl alcohol, and vinylacetate copolymers.<br><br>
Additives : -<br>
Surfactants :<br>
The radiation curable ink-jet ink and the radiation curable liquid layer may contain at least one surfactant. The surfactant(s) can be anionic, cationic, non-ionic, or zwitter-ionic and are usually added in a total quantity 0.1-1.0 wt % based on the total ink weight.<br>
A fluorinated or silicone compound may be used as a surfactant, however, a potential drawback is extraction by food from inkjet food packaging material because the surfactant does not cross-link. It is therefore preferred to use a copolymerizable monomer having surface-active effects, for example, silicone-modified acrylates, silicone modified methacrylates, fluorinated acrylates, and fluorinated methacrylates.<br>
Defoamers :<br>
The radiation curable ink-jet ink and the radiation curable liquid layer may contain at least one defoamer. The defoamer(s) can be usually added in a total quantity 0.1-1.0 wt % based on the total ink weight.<br>
Slip additives :<br>
The radiation curable ink-jet ink and the radiation curable liquid layer may contain at least one slip additive. The slip additive can be usually added in a total quantity 0.1-1.0 wt % based on the total ink weight.<br><br>
Solvents :<br>
The radiation curable ink-jet ink and the radiation curable liquid layer may contain as a solvent, water and/or organic solvents, such as alcohols, fluorinated solvents and dipolar aprotic solvents, the solvent preferably being present in a concentration between 10 and 80 wt %, particularly preferably between 20 and 50 wt %, each based on the total weight of the radiation curable inkjet ink, respectively the total weight of the radiation curable liquid layer.<br>
However, the radiation curable ink-jet ink preferably does not contain an evaporable component, but sometimes; it can be advantageous to incorporate an extremely small amount of an organic solvent in such inks to improve adhesion to the ink-receiver surface after UV curing. In this case, the added solvent can be any amount in the range which does not cause problems of solvent resistance and VOC, and preferably 0.1-20.0 wt %, and particularly preferably 0.1-10.0 wt %, each based on the total weight of the radiation curable ink-jet ink<br>
Suitable organic solvents include alcohol, aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, esters, aliphatic hydrocarbons, higher fatty acids, carbitols, cellosolves, higher fatty acid esters. Suitable alcohols include methanol, ethanol, propanol and 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 2-butanol, t.-butanol. Suitable aromatic hydrocarbons include toluene, and xylene. Suitable ketones include methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, 2,4-pentanedione and hexafluoroacetone. Also glycol, glycolethers, N-methylpyrrolidone, N,N-dimethylacetamid, N,N-dimethylformamid may be used.<br>
