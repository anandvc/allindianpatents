				<td>The present invention relates to a synergistic salt bath composition for surface oxidation treatment of ferrous metal articles, including nitrided ferrous metal articles to increase their corrosion resistance, the surface oxidation treatment being carried out at a temperature between 32 0°C and   550°C.<br>
Salt baths containing alkali metal nitrates have long been used to treat ferrous metal parts, including parts that have been previously nitrided, to increase their corrosion resistance by forming a layer of magnetite Fe304 to protect the  underlying   iron.<br>
Document FR-A-2 463 821 describes a process for treating nitrided ferrous metal parts by immersing the parts in a molten salt bath containing sodium and potassium hydroxides with 2% to 20% by weight of nitrates of these alkali metals for a period between 15 minutes and 50 minutes. The temperatures used are between 250°C and 450°C. The corrosion resistance of parts treated in this way is greatly increased compared with parts which have only been nitrided.<br>
Document FR-A-2 525 637 describes a process of the same<br>
kind specifically intended for ferrous metal parts<br>
containing sulfur, such as parts that have been nitrided in<br>
baths        containing        sulfur-containing        substances.	The<br>
oxidizing bath contains sodium and potassium cations and<br>
nitrate and hydroxyl anions. It preferably contains<br>
carbonate anions and 0.5% to 15% of an oxygenated alkali<br>
metal salt whose oxyreduction potential relative to the<br>
hydrogen reference electrode is less than or equal to -1<br>
volt,     such    as    a    bichromate.	An    oxygenated    gas    is    blown<br>
into        the        bath        and        the        concentration        of   insoluble<br>
particles in the bath is maintained at less than 3% by<br>
weight.	This    produces     good    corrosion    resistance (250<br>
hours in the salt spray test) without deterioration of wear and fatigue resistance and there is an improvement in   seizing  resistance  under   conditions   of   dry   rubbing.<br>
However, it has been found that this performance<br>
cannot	be	achieved	with	the	reliabilityand<br>
reproducibility required to meet industrial demands.<br>
Performance variations are relatively minor in the<br>
laboratory.	They     become     much     greater     for     treatment<br>
carried       out       on       an       industrial       scaie.	They       are<br>
particularly noticeable when large quantities of small parts are "bulk" treated or parts with imperfect surfaces are treated: the presence of disrupted areas such as pressing or punching burrs, crimping or bending creases and welding heterogeneities are all sources of defects and   therefore   of   corrosion.<br>
A random resistance to corrosion is totally<br>
unacceptable for parts such as jack or camper piston rods<br>
and automobile windshield wiper and starter motor<br>
spindles.	The    solution    to    this    problem    has     for    many<br>
years been to refresh the baths repeatedly, as and when<br>
required, according to the more or less aberrant results<br>
obtained.	This      solution      is      not       satisfactory,in<br>
particular because of the industrial requirements mentioned  previously.<br>
The        proportions	of	the        bath	constituents<br>
(hydroxides, carbonates, nitrate, bichromate) have been varied to improve reliability and corrosion resistance. Our investigations have shown that to achieve excellent corrosion resistance (i.e. more than 400 hours exposure to salt spray before the first appearance of traces of corrosion) , the surface of the parts must be a uniform deep black color, typical of the formation of a layer of magnetite   Fe3O4   with   good   crystalline   order.      At   the   sametime, the corrosion potential in a 30 g/1 NaCl solution relative to a saturated calomel electrode should be L   000   mV   to   1   300   mV,    indicative   of   complete   passivation  .<br>
The correlation between the oxyreduction potential of the oxygenated salt (e.g. bichromate) and the desirable   corrosion  potential   should  be   noted.<br>
However,     baths    containing    alkali    metal     hydroxides<br>
nitrates,       carbonates      and      bichromate      or      permanganate<br>
require     frequent     testing     of     the     bath     composition     and<br>
adjustment    to    the    operating    conditions     specific     to     tie<br>
parts       if      efficiency      is      to      be      maintained.	Als;.<br>
performance varies due to modification of the composition<br>
of the bath by consumption of reagents, soiling by<br>
residues on the parts due to previous treatments and<br>
reaction of the soiling materials with the bath<br>
constituents, entrainment of bath constituents with parts<br>
removed from the bath, and reaction of the hydroxides in<br>
the bath with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; these<br>
performance variations occur despite periodic adjustment<br>
of    the    bath    composition.	In    specific    applications the<br>
strong oxidizing agent (bichromate) concentration is relatively   critical.<br>
Enrichment of the bath with carbonates due to<br>
oxidation of nitriding bath cyanates and absorption, or<br>
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere lead to precipitation<br>
of carbonates that form a sludge at the bottom of tnt<br>
bath.	Removal        of        this        sludge        entrains        active<br>
constituents   of   the   bath.<br>
The invention concerns oxidizing bath compositions based on alkaline-earth metal nitrates which have a reliable   and   repetitive   oxidizing  power.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a synergistic salt bath composition for surface oxidation treatment of ferrous metal articles, including nitrided ferrous metal articles to increase their corrosion resistance, the surface oxidation treatment being carried out at a temperature between 32 0°C and 550°C, wherein the salt  bath  composition   comprises   :<br>
a)	one or more molten salts of sodium selected from the group comprising sodium nitrate	[NaN03] ,	sodium carbonate   [Na2C03]    and   sodium  hydroxide    [NaOH],<br>
b)	one or more molten salts of lithium [Li] selected from the group comprising lithium nitrate [LiN03] , lithium carbonate    [Li2C03]    and   lithium  hydroxide    [LiOH],<br>
c)	optionally comprising one or more molten salts of potassium selected from the group comprising potassium nitrate	[KN03] ,	potassium carbonate	[K2C03J	and potassium  hydroxide    [KOH],<br>
wherein the molten salts of sodium [Na] or potassium [K] are substituted by one or more molten salts of lithium [Li] selected from the group comprising lithium nitrate [LiN03] , lithium carbonate [Li2C03] and lithium hydroxide [LiOH] in the proportion to have concentration of lithium [Li] cations by weight relative to the mass of the bath between 0.1% and 5%,<br>
wherein the salt bath composition comprises the molten salts in a proportion to form stoichiometric equilibrium between nitrate anions [N03-] , carbonate anions [C032-] and hydroxyl anions [OH] of the molten salts of the alkali metals and alkali metal cations [Na+] , [K+] and [Li + ] of the molten salts   of   the   alkali   metals.<br>
carried out at a temperature between 32 0°C and 550°C, the composition including at least nitrate anions and sodium cations and where appropriate potassium alkali cations, characterized in that it includes lithium cations substituted for sodium or potassium cations in a proportion by weight relative to the mass of the bath between   0.1%  and  5%.<br>
We have found that substituting lithium for sodium and possibly potassium in the proportions indicated above unexpectedly leads to baths which form magnetite layers of a uniform black on ferrous metal parts, the corrosion potential of the treated parts being systematically at least 1 000 mV, even for parts made from materials which are supposedly difficult to treat by oxidation, such as nitrided  cast   iron.<br>
Note that the chemical properties of alkali metals are very similar, with the result that the person skilled in the art usually thinks that alkali metals can be substituted for each other to suit circumstances such as availability, cost, purity or stability. In salt baths the combination of cations is often chosen so that the mixture has a relatively low melting point and a sufficiently low viscosity at the working temperature of the  bath.<br>
We have not been able to elucidate exactly and precisely the physico-chemical mechanisms which, in baths in accordance with the invention, lead to the formation of ordered crystals and totally impermeable magnetite layers, as indicated by the uniformly black appearance of the surface of the parts and by the corrosion potential.<br>
Based on the results obtained however, we suspect that the small atomic radius of lithium could play a decisive role. It is known that, because of its small atomic    radius,     lithium    can    penetrate    into    the    crystal<br>
lattice of magnetite to form crystalline Li2Fe3O4 which has clearly defined and constant crystal lattice parameters. It is thus possible that the lithium cation stabilizes the crystal lattice of the magnetite as the latter   forms.<br>
The concentration of lithium is preferably between 0.5% and 1.75% by weight; the corrosion resistance is most   reliable  and  reproducible   in  this   range  of  values.<br>
In addition to nitrate anions and carbonate and hydroxyl anions, in stoichiometric equilibrium with the alkali metal cations, the preferred bath compositions contain proportions by weight of carbonate CO32-, nitrite NO3- and hydroxyl OH- anions within the following percentage ranges relative to the active or liquid mass of   the  bath:<br>
8.5 
These limits have been experimentally determined to provide an appropriate viscosity at the operating temperatures, with a low probability of uncontrolled reactions in the presence of reducing agents, whilst allowing for the likely relative concentrations of cations.<br>
The aforementioned composition preferably contains significant  proportions  by  weight   of  potassium.<br>
We have also found that the presence of lithium<br>
in baths containing nitrate, hydroxyl and carbonate<br>
anions reduces the quantity of sludge formed by the<br>
precipitation    of    carbonates.	This    effect    appears     to<br>
be particularly marked if the concentrations of lithium and potassium cations and carbonate or nitrate anions are substantially equivalent to a ternary alkali (sodium, potassium and lithium) nitrate or carbonate eutectic.<br>
Since      the      concentration      of       lithium      has       been determined   to   form   ordered   crystalline   magnetite   layers, the   concentrations   of   carbonate   or   nitrate   anions   and   of potassium        cations        are        related        to        the        lithium concentration  as   follows:<br>
for  the  carbonate  eutectic:<br>
9	x  Li+  
2.7   x  Li+   
for  the  nitrate  eutectic:<br>
30  x  Li+   
10	x  Li+   
In all cases the sodium concentration is stoichiometric.<br>
Features and advantages of the invention will emerge from the following description illustrated by examples.<br>
Example   1<br>
An oxidizing salt bath was prepared by melting a mixture of 3 65 kg of sodium nitrate, 3 65 kg of sodium hydroxide, 90 kg of sodium carbonate, 90 kg of potassium carbonate and 90 kg of lithium carbonate and heating the mixture  to  450°C.<br>
The percentage ionic concentrations were therefore as   follows:<br>
anions	cations<br>
NO3-	26.6	Na+	34.7<br>
CO32-	16.3	K+	5.1<br>
OH-	15.6	Li+	1.7<br>
Non-alloy 0.38% carbon steel test pieces previously sulfonitrided as disclosed in documents FR-A-2 171 993 and FR-A-2 271 307 (immersion for 90 minutes in a salt bath at 570°C containing 37% cynanate anions and 17% carbonate anions, the cations being K+, Na+ and Li+, the bath also containing 10 ppm to 15 ppm of S2- ions) were  treated  in  this  bath  for   five  minutes.<br>
The treated test pieces had a particularly uniform and decorative black color. Crystallographic analysis of the test pieces by X-ray diffraction showed that the majority substance present was magnetite Fe3O4; there was a  minor  proportion  of  mixed  oxide  Li2Fe3O4.<br>
In an electrochemical corrosion test using voltametric analysis on an aerated 30 g/1 NaCl solution, the corrosion potential measured relative to the saturated calomel electrode was in a range from 1 000 mV to 1 3 00 mV, indicative of total passivation of the parts, according to the technical information we have collected on assessing the quality of oxidizing salt bath treatment.<br>
Note that the measured potentials of 1 000 mV to 1 3 00 mV correspond in fact to the inherent oxidation potential of the NaCl solution; it is not possible to measure a real corrosion potential if it is at least as high as the oxidation potential of the test solution.<br>
Weekly cleaning of a salt bath of the invention used daily for production to remove the sludge deposited at the bottom of the crucible removed 7 0 kg of salts containing  60%  by  weight  of   carbonates.<br>
Note that the ternary eutectic of carbonates of sodium, potassium and lithium had the composition 33.2% Na2C03, 34.8% K2C03 and 32% Li2C03. The composition of the carbonates in the bath (33.3% for each) was very close  to  that  of  the  eutectic.<br>
Comparative   trials<br>
Two experimental baths were made up with no lithium.<br>
The first bath contained 330 kg of sodium nitrate, 330 kg of sodium hydroxide, 330 kg of sodium carbonate and 10 kg of sodium bichromate, giving the following percentage  ionic   concentrations:<br>
anions	cation<br>
N03-	24.1	Na+	42.3<br>
OH-	14<br>
CO32-	18.8<br>
Cr2072-	0.8<br>
The   second  bath   contained   150   kg   of   sodium  nitrate,<br>
530   kg      of      sodium      hydroxide      and      320   kg      of       sodium<br>
carbonate,   i.e.   a  percentage   ionic  composition:<br>
anions	cation<br>
NO3-	11	Na+	48.3<br>
OH-	22.5<br>
CO32-	18.2<br>
The        treatment        conditions	(temperature        450°C,<br>
duration five minutes) were as for the first example. The  results  were  as   follows:<br>
All the test pieces treated were covered with a black  layer  of  magnetite  Fe304-<br>
The test pieces treated in the first comparative bath were uniformly black; their corrosion potential was between 1 000 mV and 1 3 00 mV, from which it may be concluded  that   the  oxide  layer  was  passive.<br>
The test pieces treated in the second comparative<br>
bath were mainly black, with some showing brown<br>
highlights.	The     corrosion     potential     varied     between<br>
250  mV    and    1   300  mV.	It    may    be     concluded    that     the<br>
quality of the magnetite layer varied from one test piece to another and that the second comparative bath did not offer  sufficient  reliability.<br>
Weekly cleaning of the two experimental baths used daily for production removed approximately 150 kg of sludge  containing  approximately   60%   carbonate.<br>
From the point of view of mechanical and tribological properties, the bath from example 1 and the first comparative bath yielded entirely equivalent results.<br>
Example  2<br>
An oxidizing salt bath was produced from 3 65 kg<br>
NaOH, 270 kg Na2CO3, 62 kg NaN03, 277 kg KN03 and 76 kg<br>
LiNO3.	The    nitrates    were    divided    between     the     three<br>
alkali cations in proportions of 14.9% NaNO3, 66.8% KNO3<br>
and 18.3% LiN03, substantially equivalent to the ternary<br>
eutectic.	The	corresponding	percentage	ionic<br>
concentrations   by  weight  were   as   follows:<br>
anions	cations<br>
N03-	28.2	Na+	34.3<br>
C032_	15.4	K+	10.8<br>
OH-	15.5	Li+	0.77<br>
Nitrided cast iron test pieces were treated<br>
in this bath using the same operating conditions as<br>
in    Exctmple     1     and    in     the     comparative     examples.	The<br>
treated test pieces were uniformly black, the surface layer was preponderantly magnetite Fe304 and the corrosion potential was in the range from 1 000 mV to 1   300  mV.<br>
Similar nitrided cast iron test pieces were treated<br>
in the first and second comparative baths described above<br>
and     were     an     irregular     brownish     red     color.	X-ray<br>
diffraction analysis indicated that the surface layer was preponderantly magnetite, but that the crystal order was irregular, the X-ray diffraction spectrum showing anomalies compared to standard (ASTM) spectra for magnetite.<br>
Weekly cleaning of the bath from example 2 containing 0.77% lithium and used daily for production removed  about   80  kg  of   sludge.<br>
Example  3<br>
Two experimental baths were prepared containing only nitrate anions. Bath A contained 48.5% KNO3, 39.5% NaN03 cmd 12% LiN03, with the following percentage ionic concentrations:<br><br>
anion	cations<br>
NO3-	7 0.3	Na+	13.1<br>
K+	15.4<br>
Li+	1.2<br>
A    comparative    bath    B   was    prepared    containing    55%<br>
NaNO3   and  45%  KNO3,   i.e.   the   following  ionic  percentages:<br>
anion	cations<br>
NO3-	67.6	Na+	14.9<br>
K+	17.5<br>
Nitrided cast iron test pieces were treated in these  baths   (immersed  for   15  minutes   at   400°C).<br>
The test pieces treated in bath A all had a deep black surface layer. The test pieces treated in bath B had  a  grey  surface  layer  with  brown  highlights.<br>
The corrosion potentials, determined in the same way as previously, were in the range from 1 000 mV to 1 300 mV in the case of the test pieces treated in bath A and in a range from 3 00 mV to 90 0 mV in the case of those treated in bath B, with the expected consequences as to their  corrosion  resistance.<br>
Note that the comparative examples corresponding to examples 2 and 3 confirm the known difficulty of protecting nitrided cast iron against corrosion and demonstrate  the  efficacy  of   the  baths  of   the  invention.<br>
With reference to example 3, the parts treated must have all traces of residues from the nitriding bath carefully removed, because pure nitrate baths are liable to  react  violently  on  contact  with  reducing  substances.<br>
With reference to the reduced formation of carbonate sludge in baths containing hydroxides, nitrates and carbonates, we found that the reduction in sludge formation appeared to be optimal if the concentrations by weight of a nitrate or carbonate anion, in conjunction with the concentration of potassium and lithium cations, corresponded    to    the   presence    in    the    bath   of    a    ternary<br>
eutectic   of   the   anion  with   the  Na+,   K+   and  Li+   cations.<br>
As the efficacy of formation of an ordered crystalline magnetite layer depends on the concentration by weight by lithium, the rule for obtaining the optimum combination of the two effects is to choose the lithium concentration appropriate to formation of the protective magnetite layer and then, on the basis of this concentration, to determine the potassium and carbonate or nitrite anion concentration from the ternary eutectic composition  of   that   anion.<br>
Thus,   for  the  carbonate  anion:<br>
9	x  Li+   
2.7   x  Li+   
and  for  the  nitrate  anion:<br>
30   x  Li+   
10	x  Li+   
Of course, in all cases, the sodium cation will be in excess of the composition of the ternary eutectic, because of the presence of anions other than the anion taken into consideration for the eutectic and because the bath  must  be  in  stoichiometric   equilibrium.<br>
It goes without saying that the invention is not limited to the examples described but encompasses all variant executions thereof within the scope of the claims.<br><br><br><br>
