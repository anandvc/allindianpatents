				<td>The present invention relates to an improved fire extinguishant. By way of example and without implying any limitation the fire extinguishant of the present invention can be employed for extinguishing the A, B and C class of fires.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION :<br>
The fire extinguishant formulations for extinguishing the A, B and C class of fires as known in the prior art, generally comprise of graphite and / or oxidised graphite.<br>
The disadvantages of such known fire extinguishant formulations, as stated above, is that the giuphite and / or oxidised graphite makes the fire extinguishant formulation conducting in nature at high applied voltaqe, which in turn makes the said formulation unsuitable for its application as fire extinguishant on the live electric wire or cable.<br>
The another type of fire extinguishant formulations for extinguishing the A, B and C class of fires as known in the prior art, generally comprise of aerosil.<br>
The disadvantages of such known fire extinguishant formulations comprising of aerosil, as stated above, is that the formulation thus resulted is very expensive, which in turn limits the application of the said products.<br>
Still another type of fire extinguishant formulations for extinguishing the A, B and C class of fires or any such fire, as known in the prior art, generally comprise of organic compounds, such as ethyl vinyl, polymers, copolymers etc.<br>
The disadvantages of such known fire extinguishant formulations comprising of organic compounds, such as ethyl vinyl, polymers, copolymers etc., as stated above, is that the decomposition products of the said formulations after extinguishing the fire of class A, B and C or any such fire thus resulted are harmful and not environment friendly, and the thermal characteristics of such fomulations are not better, which in turn limits the application of the said formulation products.<br>
Still further an another type of fire extinguishant formulations for extinguishing the A, B and C class of fires as known in the prior art, generally comprise of inorganic and / or organic silicates and / or siliconates, such as sodium aluminomethyl siloxanolates, sodium organosiliconates etc.<br>
The disadvantages of such known fire extinguishant formulations comprising of inorganic and / or organic silicates and / or siliconates, as stated above, is that the formulation thus resulted is very expensive, which in turn limits the application of the said formulation products.<br>
Yet another type of fire extinguishant formulations for extinguishing the A, B and C class of fires as known in the prior art, generally comprise of two active basic materials, such as sulphates and phosphates both.<br>
The disadvantages of such known fire extinguishant formulations comprising of two active basic materials, such as sulphates and phosphates both, as stated above, is that the formulations thus resulted in turn result in the<br>
decomposition products comprising of oxides of sulphur, which in turn are not environment friendly.<br>
i<br>
The fire extinguishant is expected to have properties, like electrical insulation, low or cold temperature resistance and as well suitable at high temperature, fire fighting efficiency and free flow characteristics, better non-hygroscopicity and still being non-toxic and resulting in the environment friendly decomposition products in addition being highly economical.<br>
The disadvantage of the fire extinguishanls known in the prior art, as described here in above, is that these do not have all these properties in one end use product.<br>
The drawback of the process of preparation of known such fire extinguishant formulations is that, these generally require heavy instrumentation and still resulting in the poor recovery of the solvent.<br>
The another drawback of process of preparation of known such fire extinguishant formulations is that, the temperature of the process of preparation is as high as 160°C or above, requiring higher amount of the energy.<br>
Still another drawbacks of known such processes having the requirements of heavy instrumentation and higher amount of energy and as well resulting in poor recovery of the solvent are that the cost of the process and hence of the end products is increased and this in turn again limit their wider applications / use of the end products among the masses.<br>
A primary object  of the  present  invention<br>
is to propose an improved fire extinguishant, which can advantageously be employed for extinguishing fires such as of the A, B and C class of fires.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose an improved fire extinguishant which can advantageously be employed for extinguishing fires-' such as of the A, B and C class of fires and wherein the disadvantages and drawbacks of the prior art, as described herein above/ are eliminated totally or reduced to the major extent.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose an improved fire extinguishant which can advantageously be employed for extinguishing fires such as of the A, B and C classoffires which has better free flowing property and fire fighting efficiency, and better shelf life and high temperature and low temperature resistance.<br><br>
A further object of the present invention<br>
is to propose an improved fire extinguishant which<br>
can advantageously be employed for extinguishing<br>
fires such as of the A, B and C class of fires<br>
