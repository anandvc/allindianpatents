				<td>HYDROCARBON THERMAL CRACKING USING ATMOSPHERIC RESIDUUM<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons using a<br>
vaporization unit in combination with a pyrolysis furnace wherein at least a<br>
preponderance of the liquid hydrocarbonaceous feed to be cracked in the furnace is<br>
first vaporized in the vaporization unit. More particularly, this invention relates to the<br>
use of atmospheric residuum as a significant liquid hydrocarbonaceous feed<br>
component for the vaporization unit and furnace.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Thermal (pyrolysis) cracking of hydrocarbons is a non-catalytic petrochemical<br>
process that is widely used to produce olefins such as ethylene, propylene, butenes,<br>
butadiene, and aromatics such as benzene, toluene, and xylenes.<br>
Basically, a hydrocarbon containing feedstock is mixed with steam which<br>
serves as a diluent to keep the hydrocarbon molecules separated. The<br>
steam/hydrocarbon mixture is preheated in the convection zone of the furnace to<br>
from about 900 to about 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit (°F or F), and then enters the<br>
reaction (radiant) zone where it is very quickly heated to a severe hydrocarbon<br>
thermal cracking temperature in the range of from about 1,400 to about 1,550F.<br>
Thermal cracking is accomplished without the aid of any catalyst.<br>
This process is carried out in a pyrolysis furnace (steam cracker) at pressures<br>
in the reaction zone ranging from about 10 to about 30 psig. Pyrolysis furnaces have<br>
internally thereof a convection section (zone) and a separate radiant section (zone).<br>
Preheating functions are primarily accomplished in the convection section, while<br>
severe cracking mostly occurs in the radiant section.<br>
After thermal cracking, depending on the nature of the primary feed to the<br>
pyrolysis furnace, the effluent from that furnace can contain gaseous hydrocarbons<br>
of great variety, e.g., from one to thirty-five carbon atoms per molecule. These<br>
gaseous hydrocarbons can be saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated,<br>
and can be aliphatic, alicydics, and/or aromatic. The cracked gas can also contain<br>
significant amounts of molecular hydrogen (hydrogen).<br>
The cracked product is then further processed in the olefin production plant to<br>
produce, as products of the plant, various separate individual streams of high purity<br>
such as hydrogen, ethylene, propylene, mixed hydrocarbons having four carbon<br>
atoms per molecule, fuel oil, and pyrolysis gasoline. Each separate individual<br>
stream aforesaid is a valuable commercial product in its own right. Thus, an olefin<br>
production plant currently takes a part (fraction) of a whole crude stream or<br>
condensate, and generates therefrom a plurality of separate, valuable products.<br>
Thermal cracking first came into use In 1913 and was first applied to gaseous<br>
ethane as the primary feed to the cracking furnace for the purpose of making<br>
ethylene. Since that time, the industry has evolved to using heavier and more<br>
complex hydrocarbonaceous gaseous and/or liquid feeds as the primary feed for the<br>
cracking furnace. Such feeds can now employ a fraction of whole crude or<br>
condensate which is essentially totally vaporized while thermally cracking same.<br>
The cracked product can contain, for example, about 1 weight percent (wt.%)<br>
hydrogen, about 10 wt.% methane, about 25 wt.% ethylene, and about 17 wt.%<br>
propylene, all wt.% being based on the total weight of that product, with the<br>
remainder consisting mostly of other hydrocarbon molecules having from 4 to 35<br>
carbon atoms per molecule.<br>
Natural gas and whole crude oil(s) were formed naturally in a number of<br>
subterranean geologic formations (formations) of widely varying porosities. Many of<br>
these formations were capped by impervious layers of rock. Natural gas and whole<br>
crude oil (crude oil) also accumulated in various stratigraphic traps below the earth's<br>
surface. Vast amounts of both natural gas and/or crude oil were thus collected to<br>
form hydrocarbon bearing formations at varying depths below the earth's surface.<br>
Much of this natural gas was in close physical contact with crude oil, and, therefore,<br>
absorbed a number of lighter molecules from the crude oil.<br>
When a well bore is drilled into the earth and pierces one or more of such<br>
hydrocarbon bearing formations, natural gas and/or crude oil can be recovered<br>
through that well bore to the earth's surface.<br>
The terms "whole crude oil" and "crude oil" as used herein means liquid (at<br>
normally prevailing conditions of temperature and pressure at the earth's surface)<br>
crude oil as it issues from a wellhead separate from any natural gas that may be<br>
present, and excepting any treatment such crude oil may receive to render it<br>
acceptable for transport to a crude oil refinery and/or conventional distillation in such<br>
a refinery. This treatment would include such steps as desalting. Thus, it is crude oil<br>
that is suitable for distillation or other fractionation in a refinery, but which has not<br>
undergone any such distillation or fractionation. It could include, but does not<br>
necessarily always include, non-boiling entities such as asphaltenes or tar. As such,<br>
it is difficult if not impossible to provide a boiling range for whole crude oil.<br>
Accordingly, whole crude oil could be one or more crude oils straight from an oil field<br>
pipeline and/or conventional crude oil storage facility, as availability dictates, without<br>
any prior fractionation thereof.<br>
Natural gas, like crude oil, can vary widely in its composition as produced to<br>
the earth's surface, but generally contains a significant amount, most often a major<br>
amount, i.e., greater than about 50 weight percent (wt. %), methane. Natural gas<br>
often also carries minor amounts (less than about 50 wt. %), often less than about 20<br>
wt. %, of one or more of ethane, propane, butane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide,<br>
hydrogen sulfide, and the like. Many, but not all, natural gas streams as produced<br>
from the earth can contain minor amounts (less than about 50 wt. %), often less than<br>
about 20 wt. %, of hydrocarbons having from 5 to 12, inclusive, carbon atoms per<br>
molecule (C5 to C12) that are not normally gaseous at generally prevailing ambient<br>
atmospheric conditions of temperature and pressure at the earth's surface, and that<br>
can condense out of the natural gas once it is produced to the earth's surface. Ail<br>
wt.% are based on the total weight of the natural gas stream in question.<br>
When various natural gas streams are produced to the earth's surface, a<br>
hydrocarbon composition often naturally condenses out of the thus produced natural<br>
gas stream under the then prevailing conditions of temperature and pressure at the<br>
earth's surface where that stream is collected. There is thus produced a normally<br>
liquid hydrocarbonaceous condensate separate from the normally gaseous natural<br>
gas under the same prevailing conditions. The normally gaseous natural gas can<br>
contain methane, ethane, propane, and butane. The normally liquid hydrocarbon<br>
fraction that condenses from the produced natural gas stream is generally referred to<br>
as "condensate," and generally contains molecules heavier than butane (C5 to about<br>
C20 or slightly higher). After separation from the produced natural gas, this liquid<br>
condensate fraction is processed separately from the remaining gaseous fraction<br>
that is normally referred to as natural gas.<br>
Thus, condensate recovered from a natural gas stream as first produced to<br>
the earth's surface is not the exact same material, composition wise, as natural gas<br>
(primarily methane). Neither is it the same material, composition wise, as crude oil.<br>
Condensate occupies a niche between normally gaseous natural gas and normally<br>
liquid whole crude oil. Condensate contains hydrocarbons heavier than normally<br>
gaseous natural gas, and a range of hydrocarbons that are at the lightest end of<br>
whole crude oil.<br>
Condensate, unlike crude oil, can be characterized by way of its boiling point<br>
range. Condensates normally boil in the range of from about 100 to about 650F.<br>
With this boiling range, condensates contain a wide variety of hydrocarbonaceous<br>
materials. These materials can include compounds that make up fractions that are<br>
commonly referred to as naphtha, kerosene, diesel fuel(s), and gas oil (fuel oil,<br>
furnace oil, heating oil, and the like).<br>
Naphtha and associated lighter boiling materials (naphtha) are in the C5 to<br>
C10, inclusive, range, and are the lightest boiling range fractions in condensate,<br>
boiling in the range of from about 100 to about 400F.<br>
Petroleum middle distillates (kerosene, diesel, atmospheric gas oil) are<br>
generally in the C10 to about C20 or slightly higher range, and generally boil, in their<br>
majority, in the range of from about 350 to about 650F. They are, individually and<br>
collectively, referred to herein as "distillate," "distillates," or "middle distillates."<br>
Distillate compositions can have a boiling point lower than 350F and/or higher than<br>
650F, and such distillates are included in the 350-650F range aforesaid, and in this<br>
invention. Atmospheric residuum (resid or residua) typically boils at a temperature<br>
of from about 650F up to its end boiling point where only non-boiling entities such as<br>
asphaltenes and tar are left. Atmospheric resid is formed by processing crude<br>
oil/condensate in an atmospheric thermal distillation tower. Atmospheric resid is not<br>
the same as vacuum residuum which is formed in a vacuum assisted thermal<br>
distillation tower, and has a boiling range of from about 1,000F up to its end boiling<br>
point where only non-boiling entities remain.<br>
The olefin production industry is now progressing beyond the use of fractions<br>
of crude oil or condensate (gaseous and/or liquid) as the primary feed for a cracking<br>
furnace to the use of whole crude oil and/or condensate itself.<br>
Recently, U.S. Patent Number 6,743,961 (hereafter "USP '961") issued to<br>
Donald H. Powers. This patent relates to cracking whole crude oil by employing a<br>
vaporization/mild cracking zone that contains packing. This zone is operated in a<br>
manner such that the liquid phase of the whole crude that has not already been<br>
vaporized is held in that zone until cracking/vaporization of the more tenacious<br>
hydrocarbon liquid components is maximized. This allows only a minimum of solid<br>
residue formation which residue remains behind as a deposit on the packing. This<br>
residue is later burned off the packing by conventional steam air decoking, ideally<br>
during the normal furnace decoking cycle, see column 7, lines 50-58 of that patent.<br>
Thus, the second zone 9 of that patent serves as a trap for components, including<br>
hydrocarbonaceous materials, of the crude oil feed that cannot be cracked or<br>
vaporized under the conditions employed in the process, see column 8, lines 60-64<br>
of that patent.<br>
Still more recently, U.S. Patent 7,019,187 issued to Donald H. Powers. This<br>
patent is directed to the process disclosed in USP '961, but employs a mildly acidic<br>
cracking catalyst to drive the overall function of the vaporization/mild cracking unit<br>
more toward the mild cracking end of the vaporization (without prior mild cracking) -<br>
mild cracking (followed by vaporization) spectrum.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 6,979,757 to Donald H. Powers is directed to the process<br>
disclosed in USP '961, but that invention removes at least part of the liquid<br>
hydrocarbons remaining in the vaporization/mild cracking unit that are not yet<br>
vaporized or mildly cracked. These liquid hydrocarbon components of the crude oil<br>
feed are drawn from near the bottom of that unit and passed to a separate controlled<br>
cavitation device to provide additional cracking energy for those tenacious<br>
hydrocarbon components that have previously resisted vaporization and mild<br>
cracking. Thus, that invention also seeks to drive the overall process in the<br>
vaporization/mild cracking unit more toward the mild cracking end of the<br>
vaporization-mild cracking spectrum aforesaid.<br>
The disclosures of the foregoing patents, in their entirety, are incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 11/219,166, filed September 2, 2005,<br>
having common inventorship and assignee with USP '961, is directed to the process<br>
of using whole crude oil as the feedstock for an olefin plant to produce a mixture of<br>
hydrocarbon vapor and liquid. The vaporous hydrocarbon is separated from the<br>
remaining liquid and the vapor passed to a severe cracking operation. The<br>
remaining liquid is vaporized using a quench oil to minimize coke forming reactions.<br>
U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 11/365.212, filed March 1, 2006,<br>
having common inventorship and assignee with USP '961, is directed to the use of<br>
condensate as the dominant liquid hydrocarbonaceous feed for the vaporization unit<br>
and furnace.<br>
U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 11/584,722, filed October 20, 2006,<br>
having common inventorship and assignee with USP '961, is directed to the<br>
integration of the vaporization unit/furnace combination with a crude oil refinery.<br>
During periods of increased gasoline demand the gasoline supply (pool) can<br>
be increased by subjecting various crude oil fractions, including distillates, to various<br>
refinery catalytic cracking processes such as fluid catalytic cracking. Thus, the<br>
quantity of gasoline/naptha produced from a barrel of crude oil can be increased if<br>
desired. This is not so with distillates as defined above. The amount of distillate<br>
recovered from a barrel of crude oil is fixed and cannot be increased as it can with<br>
gasoline. The only way to increase distillate production to increase the distillate<br>
supply for the distillate pool is by refining additional barrels of crude oil<br>
By this invention valuable distillates that are in short supply are saved for the<br>
distillate pool, and not consumed in the cracking process.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with this invention, the aforesaid combination of a vaporization unit/cracking furnace is operated with its feed containing a significant amount of<br>
residuum from at least one atmospheric thermal distillation column, i.e., atmospheric<br>
resid.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 shows a simplified flow sheet for the whole crude oil/condensate<br>
cracking process described hereinabove.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The terms "hydrocarbon," "hydrocarbons," and "hydrocarbonaceous" as used<br>
herein do not mean materials strictly or only containing hydrogen atoms and carbon<br>
atoms. Such terms include materials that are hydrocarbonaceous in nature in that<br>
they primarily or essentially are composed of hydrogen and carbon atoms, but can<br>
contain other elements such as oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, metals, inorganic salts, and<br>
the like, even in significant amounts.<br>
The term "gaseous" as used in this invention means one or more gases in an<br>
essentially vaporous state, for example, steam alone, a mixture of steam and<br>
hydrocarbon vapor, and the like.<br>
Coke, as used herein, means a high molecular weight carbonaceous solid,<br>
and includes compounds formed from the condensation of polynuclear aromatics.<br>
An olefin producing plant useful with this invention would include a pyrolysis<br>
(thermal cracking) furnace for initially receiving and thermally cracking the feed.<br>
Pyrolysis furnaces for steam cracking of hydrocarbons heat by means of convection<br>
and radiation, and comprise a series of preheating, circulation, and cracking tubes,<br>
usually bundles of such tubes, for preheating, transporting, and cracking the<br>
hydrocarbon feed. The high cracking heat is supplied by burners disposed in the<br>
radiant section (sometimes called "radiation section") of the furnace. The waste gas<br>
from these burners is circulated through the convection section of the furnace to<br>
provide the heat necessary for preheating the incoming hydrocarbon feed. The<br>
convection and radiant sections of the furnace are joined at the "cross-over," and the<br>
tubes referred to hereinabove carry the hydrocarbon feed from the interior of one<br>
section to the interior of the next.<br>
In a typical furnace, the convection section can contain multiple sub-zones.<br>
For example, the feed can be initially preheated in a first upper sub-zone, boiler feed<br>
water heated in a second sub-zone, mixed feed and steam heated in a third sub-<br>
zone, steam superheated in a fourth sub-zone, and the final feed/steam mixture split<br>
into multiple sub-streams and preheated in a lower (bottom) or fifth sub-zone. The<br>
number of sub-zones and their functions can vary considerably. Each sub-zone can<br>
carry a plurality of conduits carrying furnace feed there through, many of which are<br>
sinusoidal in configuration. The convection section operates at much less severe<br>
operating conditions than the radiant section.<br>
Cracking furnaces are designed for rapid heating in the radiant section<br>
starting at the radiant tube (coil) inlet where reaction velocity constants are low<br>
because of low temperature. Most of the heat transferred simply raises the<br>
hydrocarbons from the inlet temperature to the reaction temperature. In the middle of<br>
the coil, the rate of temperature rise is lower but the cracking rates are appreciable.<br>
At the coil outlet, the rate of temperature rise increases somewhat but not as rapidly<br>
as at the inlet. The rate of disappearance of the reactant is the product of its<br>
reaction velocity constant times its localized concentration. At the end of the coil,<br>
reactant concentration is low and additional cracking can be obtained by increasing<br>
the process gas temperature.<br>
Steam dilution of the feed hydrocarbon lowers the hydrocarbon partial<br>
pressure, enhances olefin formation, and reduces any tendency toward coke<br>
formation in the radiant tubes.<br>
Cracking furnaces typically have rectangular fireboxes with upright tubes<br>
centrally located between radiant refractory walls. The tubes are supported from<br>
their top.<br>
Firing of the radiant section is accomplished with wall or floor mounted<br>
burners or a combination of both using gaseous or combined gaseous/liquid fuels.<br>
Fireboxes are typically under slight negative pressure, most often with upward flow<br>
of ffue gas. Flue gas flow into the convection section is established by at least one<br>
of natural draft or induced draft fans.<br>
Radiant coils are usually hung in a single plane down the center of the fire box.<br>
They can be nested in a single plane or placed parallel in a staggered, double-row<br>
tube arrangement. Heat transfer from the burners to the radiant tubes occurs largely<br>
by radiation, hence the thermo "radiant section," where the hydrocarbons are heated<br>
to from about 1,400°F to about 1,550°F and thereby subjected to severe cracking,<br>
and coke formation.<br>
The initially empty radiant coil is, therefore, a fired tubular chemical reactor.<br>
Hydrocarbon feed to the furnace is preheated to from about 900°F to about 1,000°F<br>
in the convection section by convectional heating from the flue gas from the radiant<br>
section, steam dilution of the feed in the convection section, or the like. After<br>
preheating, in a conventional commercial furnace, the feed is ready for entry into the<br>
radiant section.<br>
The cracked gaseous hydrocarbons leaving the radiant section are rapidly<br>
reduced in temperature to prevent destruction of the cracking pattern. Cooling of the<br>
cracked gases before further processing of same downstream in the olefin<br>
production plant recovers a large amount of energy as high pressure steam for re-<br>
use in the furnace and/or olefin plant. This is often accomplished with the use of<br>
transfer-line exchangers that are well known in the art.<br>
With a liquid hydrocarbon feedstock downstream processing, although it can<br>
vary from plant to plant, typically employs an oil quench of the furnace effluent after<br>
heat exchange of same in, for example, the transfer-line exchanger aforesaid.<br>
Thereafter, the cracked hydrocarbon stream is subjected to primary fractionation to<br>
remove heavy liquids, followed by compression of uncondensed hydrocarbons, and<br>
acid gas and water removal therefrom. Various desired products are then<br>
individually separated, e.g., ethylene, propylene, a mixture of hydrocarbons having<br>
four carbon atoms per molecule, fuel oil, pyrolysis gasoline, and a high purity<br>
hydrogen stream.<br>
Figure 1 shows one embodiment of a cracking process that uses whole crude<br>
oil and/or condensate as the dominant {primary) furnace feed. Figure 1 is very<br>
diagrammatic for sake of simplicity and brevity since, as discussed above, actual<br>
furnaces are complex structures.<br>
Figure 1 shows a liquid cracking furnace 1 wherein a crude oil/condensate<br>
primary feed 2 is passed in to an upper feed preheat sub-zone 3 in the upper, cooler<br>
reaches of the convection section of furnace 1. Steam 6 is also superheated in an<br>
upper level of the convection section of the furnace.<br>
The pre-heated cracking feed stream is then passed by way of pipe (line) 10<br>
to a vaporization unit 11 (see USP '961), which unit is separated into an upper<br>
vaporization zone 12 and a lower vaporization zone 13. This unit 11 achieves<br>
primarily (predominately) vaporization of at least a significant portion of the naphtha<br>
and gasoline boiling range and lighter materials that remain in the liquid state after<br>
the pre-heating step. Gaseous materials that are associated with the preheated feed<br>
as received by unit 11, and additional gaseous materials formed in zone 12, are<br>
removed from zone 12 by way of line 14. Thus, line 14 carries away essentially all<br>
the lighter hydrocarbon vapors, e.g., naphtha and gasoline boiling range and lighter,<br>
that are present in zone 12. Liquid distillate present in zone 12, with or without some<br>
liquid gasoline and/or naphtha, is removed there from via line 15 and passed into the<br>
upper interior of lower zone 13. Zones 12 and 13, in this embodiment, are separated<br>
from fluid communication with one another by an impermeable wall 16, which can be<br>
a solid tray. Line 15 represents external fluid down flow communication between<br>
zones 12 and 13. In lieu thereof, or in addition thereto, zones 12 and 13 can have<br>
internal fluid communication there between by modifying wall 16 to be at least in part<br>
liquid permeable by use of one or more trays designed to allow liquid to pass down<br>
into the interior of zone 13 and vapor up into the interior of zone 12. For example,<br>
instead of an impermeable wall 16, a chimney tray could be used in which case<br>
liquid within unit 11 would flow internally down into section 13 instead of externally of<br>
unit 11 via line 15. In this internal down flow case, distributor 18 becomes optional.<br>
By whatever way liquid is removed from zone 12 to zone 13, that liquid moves<br>
downwardly into zone 13, and thus can encounter at least one liquid distribution<br>
device 18. Device 18 evenly distributes liquid across the transverse cross section of<br>
unit 11 so that the liquid will flow uniformly across the width of the tower into contact<br>
with packing 19.<br>
Dilution steam 6 passes through superheat zone sub-20, and then, via line 21<br>
in to a lower portion 22 of zone 13 below packing 19. In packing 19 liquid and steam<br>
from line 21 intimately mix with one another thus vaporizing some of liquid 15. This<br>
newly formed vapor, along with dilution steam 21, is removed from zone 13 via line<br>
17 and added to the vapor in line 14 to form a combined hydrocarbon vapor product<br>
in line 25. Stream 25 can contain essentially hydrocarbon vapor from feed 2, e.g.,<br>
gasoline and naphtha, and steam.<br>
Stream 17 thus represents a part of feed stream 2 plus dilution steam 21 less<br>
liquid distillate(s) and heavier from feed 2 that are present in bottoms stream 26.<br>
Stream 25 is passed through a header (not shown) whereby stream 25 is split into<br>
multiple sub-streams and passed through multiple conduits (not shown) into<br>
convection section pre-heat sub-zone 27 of furnace 1. Section 27 is in a lower, and<br>
therefore hotter, section of furnace 1. Section 27 is used for preheating stream 25 to<br>
a temperature, aforesaid, suitable for cracking in radiant zone 29.<br>
After substantial heating in section 27, stream 25 passes by way of line 28<br>
into radiant section 29. Again, the multiple, individual streams that normally pass<br>
from sub-zone 27 to and through zone 29 are represented as a single flow stream 28<br>
for sake of brevity.<br>
In radiant firebox 29 of furnace 1, feed from line 28, which contains numerous<br>
varying hydrocarbon components, is subjected to severe thermal cracking conditions<br>
as aforesaid.<br>
The cracked product leaves radiant firebox 29 by way of line 30 for further<br>
processing in the remainder of the olefin plant downstream of furnace 1 as described<br>
hereinabove and shown in USP '961.<br>
When using crude oil and/or condensate as the significant components; or<br>
feed 2, substantial amounts of distillates are ultimately passed into furnace 1 and<br>
cracked thereby converting such distillates into lighter components. Accordingly,<br>
these distillates are lost as a source of distillate supply for jet fuel, diesel fuels and<br>
home heating oils.<br>
Pursuant to this invention, feed 2 contains, as a significant component thereof,<br>
residuum obtained from the atmospheric thermal distillation of at least one crude oil<br>
and not the crude oil/condensate feed of the prior art. Although one or more<br>
atmospheric residua can be essentially the sole component of feed material 2, this<br>
invention is not so limited so long as atmospheric residuum is a significant<br>
constituent in feed 2 and line 10.<br>
Note that this invention does not apply to vacuum resid or catalytic cracking.<br>
For purposes of this invention, feed 2 can enter furnace 1 at a temperature of<br>
from about ambient up to about 300F at a pressure from slightly above atmospheric<br>
up to about 100 psig (hereafter "atmospheric to 100 psig"). Feed 2 can enter zone<br>
12 via line 10 at a temperature of from about ambient to about 700F at a pressure of<br>
from atmospheric to 100 psig.<br>
Stream 14 can be essentially all hydrocarbon vapor formed from feed 2 and is<br>
at a temperature of from about ambient to about 700F at a pressure of from<br>
atmospheric to 100 psig.<br>
Stream 15 can be essentially all the remaining liquid from feed 2 less that<br>
which was vaporized in pre-heater 3 and is at a temperature of from about ambient<br>
to about 700F at a pressure of from slightly above atmospheric up to about 100 psig<br>
(hereafter "atmospheric to 100 psig").<br>
The combination of streams 14 and 17, as represented by stream 25, can be<br>
at a temperature of from about 600 to about 800 F at a pressure of from atmospheric<br>
to 100 psig, and contain, for example, an overall steam/hydrocarbon ratio of from<br>
about 0.1 to about 2, preferably from about 0.1 to about 1, pounds of steam pa-<br>
pound of hydrocarbon.<br>
In zone 13, dilution ratios (hot gas/liquid droplets) will vary widely because the<br>
compositions of atmospheric resid and condensate vary widely. Generally, the hot<br>
gas, e.g., steam and hydrocarbon at the top of zone 13 can be present in a ratio of<br>
steam to hydrocarbon of from about 0.1/1 to about 5/1.<br>
Steam is an example of a suitable hot gas introduced by way of line 21. Other<br>
materials can be present in the steam employed. Stream 6 can be that type of<br>
steam normally used in a conventional cracking plant. Such gases are preferably at<br>
a temperature sufficient to volatilize a substantial fraction of the liquid hydrocarbon<br>
15 that enters zone 13. Generally, the gas entering zone 13 from conduit 21 will be<br>
at least about 650F, preferably from about 900 to about 1,200F at from atmospheric<br>
to 100 psig. Such gases will, for sake of simplicity, hereafter be referred to in terms<br>
of steam alone.<br>
Stream 17 can be a mixture of steam and hydrocarbon vapor that has a<br>
boiling point lower than about 1,200F. Stream 17 can be at a temperature of from<br>
about 600 to about 800F at a pressure of from atmospheric to 100 psig.<br>
Steam from line 21 does not serve just as a diluent for partial pressure<br>
purposes as is the normal case in a cracking operation. Rather, steam from line 21<br>
provides not only a diluting function, but also additional vaporizing and mild cracking<br>
energy for the hydrocarbons that remain in the liquid state. This is accomplished<br>
with just sufficient energy to achieve vaporization and/or mild cracking of heavier<br>
hydrocarbon components in the atmospheric resid and by controlling the energy<br>
input. For example, by using steam in line 21, substantial vaporization/mild cracking<br>
of feed 2 liquid is achieved. The very high steam dilution ratio and the highest<br>
temperature steam are thereby provided where they are needed most as liquid<br>
hydrocarbon droplets move progressively lower in zone 13.<br>
The atmospheric resid feed employed in this invention can be from a single<br>
or multiple sources, and, therefore, can be a single resid or a mixture of two or more<br>
residua. Atmospheric resid useful in this invention can have a wide boiling range,<br>
particularly when mixtures of residua are employed, but will generally be in a boiling<br>
range of from about 600F to the boiling end point where only non-boiling entities<br>
remain.<br>
Pursuant to this invention, light materials such as light gasoline, naphtha, and<br>
gas oils boiling lighter (lower) than about 1,000F, all as defined hereinabove,<br>
remaining in the atmospheric residuum feed will be vaporized in unit 11 and removed<br>
by way of either line 14 or 17 or both and fed to furnace 1 as described hereinabove.<br>
In addition, hydrocarbonaceous entities heavier than the lighter entities mentioned<br>
above in this paragraph can. at least in part, be mildly cracked or otherwise broken<br>
down in unit 11 to lighter hydrocarbonaceous entities such as those mentioned<br>
above, and those just formed lighter entities removed by way of line 17 as feed for<br>
furnace 1. The remainder of the residuum feed, if any, is removed by way of line 26<br>
for disposition elsewhere.<br>
Atmospheric resid bottoms from an atmospheric thermal distillation tower<br>
(atmospheric tower) are primarily composed of a gas oil component boiling in the<br>
range of from about 600 to about 1,000F and a heavier fraction boiling in a<br>
temperature range of from about 1,000F up to its end boiling point where only non-<br>
boiling entities remain. A vacuum assisted thermal distillation tower (vacuum tower)<br>
typically separates this gas oil component from its associated heavier fraction<br>
aforesaid, thus freeing the gas oil fraction for separate recovery and beneficial use<br>
elsewhere.<br>
By the process of mis invention, the need for a vacuum tower to recover the<br>
gas oil component contained in atmospheric resid is eliminated, without eliminating<br>
the function thereof. This is accomplished in this invention by using atmospheric<br>
resid as a significant portion of the feed 2 (and 10) to stripper 11 of Figure 1. In<br>
section 13 of stripper 11 the counter current flow of downward moving hydrocarbon<br>
liquid and upward flowing steam 21 enables the heaviest (highest boiling point)<br>
liquids to be contacted at the highest steam to oil ratio and with the highest<br>
temperature steam at the same time. This creates an efficient operation for the<br>
vaporization and mild cracking of the atmospheric resid thereby forming additional<br>
lighter materials from that resid, and freeing the gas oil component of that resid, all<br>
for recovery by way of line 17 as additional cracking feed for furnace 1. It can be<br>
seen that this invention utilizes for breaking down atmospheric resid, energy in<br>
stripper 11 that is normally utilized in the operation of furnace 1, while eliminating the<br>
energy cost of operating a separate vacuum tower. Similarly the capital and other<br>
costs for a vacuum tower are eliminated without loss of the function of that vacuum<br>
tower in breaking down atmospheric resid and separating the useful gas oil<br>
component thereof.<br>
The amount of atmospheric resid employed in feed 10 pursuant to this<br>
invention can be a significant component of the overall feed 2. The atmospheric<br>
resid component can be at least about 20 wt.% of the total weight of the feed, but it<br>
is not necessarily strictly within this range.<br>
Depending on the specific physical and chemical characteristics of the<br>
atmospheric resid added to feed 2, other materials can be added to that feed. Such<br>
additional materials can include fight gasoline, naphtha, natural gasoline, and/or<br>
condensate. Naphtha can be employed in the form of full range naphtha, light<br>
naphtha, medium naphtha, heavy naphtha, or mixtures of two or more thereof. The<br>
light gasoline can have a boiling range of from that of pentane (C5) to about 158F.<br>
Full range naphtha, which includes light, medium, and heavy naphtha fractions, can<br>
have a boiling range of from about 158 to about 350F. The boiling ranges for the<br>
light, medium, and heavy naphtha fractions can be, respectively, from about 158 to<br>
about 212F, from about 212 to about 302F, and from about 302 to about 350F.<br>
If light materials, as aforesaid, are added to the atmospheric resid in feed 2, it<br>
can be preferable, again depending on the specific characteristics of this resid feed<br>
in line 2, that lighter fractions such as light gasoline and light naphtha be added to<br>
that resid feed, thereby leaving medium and/or heavy naphtha fractions for addition<br>
to the gasoline pool.<br>
The amount of light materiaS(s) thus deliberately added to the atmospheric<br>
resid in feed 2 can vary widely depending on the desires of the operator, but the<br>
resid in feed 2 will remain a significant component of the feed in line 10 to<br>
vaporization unit 11.<br>
The deliberate re-mixing of already separated light materials with atmospheric<br>
resid is counter intuitive and not done in the art. However, the addition of one or<br>
more of these light materials to the atmospheric resid is highly useful in this invention<br>
because they help lift the gas oil from the atmospheric resid in stripper 11.<br>
Depending on the characteristics of the resid in line 2, the amount of residua<br>
added to line 2, and present in line 10, after addition of one or more light materials<br>
thereto as aforesaid, can be less than 20 wt. % and still be within the spirit of this<br>
invention.<br>
It can be seen, that, with this invention, the distillates that are removed by the<br>
atmospheric tower are preserved for separate use such as for diesel fuel and<br>
kerosene, and a novel combination of atmospheric resid and lighter material in<br>
stripper 11 is used to form additional cracking feedstock from atmospheric resid that<br>
would otherwise be lost for this purpose.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
An atmospheric residuum characterized as Skikda atmospheric resid from<br>
Algeria is mixed in equal parts by weight with natural gasoline, and fed directly into<br>
the preheat section 3 of the convection section of pyrolysis furnace 1. This feed is at<br>
260F and 80 psig. In this convection section this residuum feed is preheated to<br>
about 690F at about 60 psig, and then passed into vaporization unit 11 wherein a<br>
mixture of gasoline, naphtha and gas oil gases at about 690F and 60 psig are<br>
separated in zone 12 of that unit.<br>
The separated gases are removed from zone 12 for transfer to the convection<br>
preheat sub-zone 27 of the same furnace. The preheated stream is then passed to<br>
radiant section 29.<br>
The hydrocarbon liquid remaining from residuum feed 2, after separation from<br>
accompanying hydrocarbon gases aforesaid, is transferred to lower section 13 and<br>
allowed to fall downwardly in that section toward the bottom thereof. Preheated<br>
steam 21 at about 1,050F is introduced near the bottom of zone 13 to give a steam<br>
to hydrocarbon ratio in section 13 of about 1. The falling liquid droplets are in<br>
counter current flow with the steam that is rising from the bottom of zone 13 toward<br>
the top thereof. With respect to the liquid falling downwardly in zone 13, the steam<br>
to liquid hydrocarbon ratio increases from the top to bottom of section 19.<br>
A mixture of steam and vapor 17 which contains the gas oil fraction at about<br>
760F is withdrawn from near the top of zone 13 and mixed with the gases earlier<br>
removed from zone 12 via line 14 to form a composite steam/hydrocarbon vapor<br>
stream 25 containing about 0.4 pounds of steam per pound of hydrocarbon present.<br>
This composite stream is preheated in sub-zone 27 to about 1,000F at less than<br>
about 50 psig, and then passed into radiant firebox 29 for cracking at a temperature<br>
in the range of 1,400°F to 1,550°F.<br>
Bottoms product 26 of unit 11 is removed at a temperature of about 900 F,<br>
and pressure of about 60 psig, and passed to the downstream processing equipment<br>
to produce fuel oil therefrom.<br>
