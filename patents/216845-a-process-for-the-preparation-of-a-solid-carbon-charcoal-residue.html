Containing Carbon Dioade<br>
	10 	Cross Reference to Related Application<br>
		Applicants hereby claim the benefit under 35 U.S.C. Sec. 119(e) of the U.S.<br>
		Provisional Patent Application No. 60/420,766, filed October 22, 2002, entitled<br>
		"The Production and Use of a Soil Amendment made by the Combined<br>
		Production of Hydrogen, Sequestered Carbon and utilizing Off Gases Containing<br>
	15 	Carbon Dioxide", which is fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
		FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
		This invention relates to the production and use of a nitrogen enriched carbon<br>
		based fertilizer and soil amendment made during the pyrolytic conversion of<br>
	20 	carbonaceous materials which produce charcoal and the reaction of said charcoal<br>
		with ammonia, carbon dioxide, water and other components generally found in<br>
		flue gas emissions. The invention also relates to the optimization of that ebarcoal<br>
		with mineral and plant nutrients to produce and use the combined materials as a<br>
		soil amendment and fertilizer. The invention also relates to the use of the material<br>
	25 	as a way to economically store carbon and captured greenhouse gases in the soil.<br>
		BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
		The increasing anthropogenic CO2 emissions and possible global warming have<br>
		challenged the United States and pther countries to find new and better ways to<br>
	30 	meet the world's increasing needs for energy while, at the same time, reducing<br>
		greenhouse gas emissions. Recent evidence has shown that melting glaciers,<br>
		freshwater influxes into the oceans and thinning ice at the North Pole are likely<br>
		the result on the earth's warning. The National Acadamy of Sciences report in<br>
		2002, on Rapid Climate Change, has detailed evidence that changes in the earth's<br>
	35 	climate has occurred very rapidly in the past. Due to the mounting evidence of <br><br><br>
WO 2004/037747						PCT/US2003/033553<br>
	5 	global warning, nations have wisely sought to work together to reduce potential<br>
		impacts of greenhouse gas emissions through negotiated agreements, most notably<br>
		the Kyoto Agreement. The agreement, signed currently by a majority of the<br>
		planet's nation states, seek to limit greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels.<br>
		However, many are calling for greater reductions. On February 24, 2003, Prime<br>
	10 	Minister Tony Blair, one of the United Stetes closest allies, said in a speech, "It is<br>
		clear Kyoto is not radical enough," and "We know now, from further research and<br>
		evidence, that to stop further damage to the climate we need a 60% reduction<br>
		world-wide". This number represents trillions of dollars in goods, services and<br>
		electrons created through those emissions by businesses that perceive risk and loss<br>
	15 	of income of such reductions. Rowever, evidence is mounting that a path does<br>
		need to be implemented quickly and the quickest way to implement a portion of<br>
		the global solution is to develop commercial and environmental synergies that<br>
		reduce risk and potential losses. Solutions that stabilize income potential for the<br>
		worlds business community, establish sustainable methods of growing food, and<br>
	20 	help meet the energy demands of the economically developing societies will meet<br>
		far less resistance than solutions with little corresponding value other than<br>
		sequestration.<br>
		The challenge humanity faces is how to significantly reduce of our non-renewable<br>
	25 	greenhouse gas emissions. The use of reforestation is one solution, but that is<br>
		limited as forest and biomass utilize available soil nutrients, primarily nitrogen.<br>
		Wulliam Schlesinger, Dean of the Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth<br>
		Sciences at Duke University noted in 2001;<br>
	30 	"However, the rate of carbon storage in forests declines as they mature, so the<br>
		only way by which, reforestation programs can continue to sequester carbon over<br>
		the long term is if they transition into programs that produce commercial biomass<br>
		fiels; that is, we must replace fossil fiel wifii binmass energy. It would require<br>
		reforestation of all the once-forested land on Earth, including that now used for<br>

	5 	agriculture or covered by urban areas, to store 6 PgC/yr—the amount emitted each<br>
		year from fossil fuel combustion" (Vitousek 1991).<br>
		In order to moat these increasing demands, methods have been proposed and are<br>
		being researched to sequester carbon in the ocean through fertilization and carbon<br>
	10 	dioxide uptake (US6,200,530) and through pumping of CO2 into ths ocean<br>
		(US6,598,407). Other methods, such as injection in coal seams of underground<br>
		reservoirs are also being researched heavily. All these methods represent an<br>
		expense except in specific areas where CO2 can be used for enhanced oil<br>
		recovery.<br>
	15<br>
		Many methods have been developed for removing other greenhouse gases and air<br>
		pollutants such as of nitragen and sulfur oxides from flue gas exhaust of fossil<br>
		fuels. Some of these processes result in a byproduct fertilizer, which create a<br>
		profit center through utilization of the materials. For background purposes, some<br>
	20 	related patents that sapport this approach are discussed here. US 5,624,649,<br>
		teaches a method for producing potassium sulfate while removing sulfur dioxide<br>
		from flue gas. US 6,605,263, describes methods for producing ammonium sulfate<br>
		during the same. US 4,540,554, describes the use of potassium compounds to<br>
		produce potash fertilizer while scrubbing for sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides.<br>
	25 	US 4,028,087, describes the production of a fertilizer from baghouse sludge-<br>
		ammonia-acid salt. US 5,695,616, teaches the production of ammonium sulfate<br>
		and ammonium nitrate via the use of a election beam and ammonia. In US<br>
		6,363,869, potassium hydroxide is to produce potassium nitrate and potassium<br>
		sulfate from flue gas.<br>
	30<br>
		The capture of sulfur and nitrogen gases and their conversion into fertilizers does<br>
		help. They create potent greenhouse gases however it is small in comparison to<br>
		the impact of carbon dioxide. However, as a fertilizer, they can increase plant<br>
		growth and help increase natural sequestration. The volume of carbon that has<br>
	35	 grown and is growing in the atmosphere means the most direct path is to directly<br>

WO 2004/037747						PCT/US2003/033553<br>
	5 	reduce the size of our carbon dioxide pool by capturing and utilizing carbon and<br>
		carbon compounds in long life application. Capturing carbon while creating a<br>
		value added carbon based fertilizer/soil amendment would help solve the<br>
		problems related to biomass sequestration. It can help restore nutrients that have<br>
		been removed through aggressive harvesting and provide plants with essential<br>
	10 	nutrients that allow them to utilize the higher levels of CO2 in our atmosphere.It<br>
		 is also one of the few existing distribution channel (i.e. the farm/agrochemical<br>
		Industry), which is paid to move millions of tons of natural and aynthotic<br>
		compounds to farms worldwide. However, the most rapid adoption comes with<br>
		profits and income. Therefore, this solution should yield more food, fiber, and<br>
	15 	energy than we currently aie able to achieve, and it should do it in a way that<br>
		could be sustaimed for fronsaods of years without degrading the environment.<br>
		Traditional agricultural practices such as land clearing and cultivation of soil have<br>
		led to land degradation, mineralization of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the<br>
	20 	subsequent loss of SOC as carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted to the atmosphere (Lal<br>
		et al, 1998; Hao et al., 2001). These activities have reduced soil's natural ability<br>
		to grow plant life in abundance. Additionally, the depletion of trace minerals from<br>
		our soils are impacting the health of our ecosphere and risk creating mankind as a<br>
		species depending on a smaller and smaller window of elements to support a<br>
	25 	growing world population. This reduction in elemental diversity could have long<br>
		term effects on the future health and development of our species.<br>
		The use of carbon-based fertilizers to effect long-term storage of the carbon and<br>
		remove atmosphere carbon dioxide requires that the carbon must be stable and or<br>
	30 	convert in the soil to a stable material. The earth has a carbon that meets these <br>
		requirements. That carbon is charcoal. Charcoal makes up a significant<br>
		percentage of our soil. In five representative soil samples, USDA soil scientist<br>
		Don Reicosky, reported that up to 35% of soil carbon was comprised of charcoal.<br>
		What is exciting is that not only is charcoal found in soils in great abandance but<br>
	35 	also that it provides substantial value once there.<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2004/037747						PCT/US2003/033553<br>
	5 	Reports of historical use of charcoal as a soil amendment date back over 2000<br>
		years to the Amazon rain forest (Glaser, 1999) Man-made sites, known as "Terra<br>
		Preta" (black dirt) have been purported to be created by an indigenous people who<br>
		were able to overcome poor quality soils by adding charcoal. These sites, with<br>
		their broken pottery and other indicators of human occupation, after a thousand<br>
	10 	years sites are valued today because they out produce non-manmade soils by 3<br>
		fold (Mann, 2002). The ability to increase crop yields dose not just apply to old<br>
		charcoal, Steiner, (unpublished) recreated Terra Preta soils in Brazil with fresh<br>
		charcoal form a local supplier and reported up 280% increases in biomaas yields<br>
		over fertilization alone. His crop yields were even higher, Glaser (1999) reports<br>
	15 	17% increase in rice yields with charcoal additions over a control. Hoshis reports<br>
		20-40% increase in plaot height and volume with the addition of bamboo charcoal<br>
		over controls with an optimum at 100g per square meter per year (or 1 too per<br>
		hectare or 890Ibs/acre). Nishio in studies using commercial charcoal made from<br>
		bark, found alfalfa growth increases of 1.7-1.9 times over fertilization alone.<br>

	5 	Charcoal is a form of sequestered carbon that will not rapidly decompose and<br>
		return CO2 into the atmosphere. It is very resistant to microbial decay, (Glaser<br>
		1999; Glaser et al. 2003a). Studies have shown that Terra Preta soils contained up<br>
		to 70 times more pyrogenic C (charcoal) than the surrounding soils. The<br>
		hypothesis is that charcoal persists in the soil for centuries due to its chemical<br>
	10 	stability caused by the aromatic structure. (Glaser, el al. 2002) The material's<br>
		chemical structure is resistant to microbial degradation (Goldberg 1985; Schmidt<br>
		et al. 1999; Seiler and Crutzen 1980). Glaser confinued the stability by 14C dating<br>
		of the soil charcoal with results showing ages of 1,000-2,000 years.(Glaser et al.<br>
		2000), Other reports show that charcoal can even be found in highly weathered<br>
	15 	environments with carbon dating it back thousands of years. (Gavin, 2002;<br>
		Saldarriagae et al.1986).<br>
		Charcoal has unique physical structures and chemical properties, which if<br>
		optimizer, offer significant value as a soil amendment Its open porous structure<br>
	20 	readily adsorbs many naturally occurring compounds. This property allows<br>
		charcoal to act as a natural sponge. In crop faming, applied nutrients are rapidly<br>
		teached below the root zone of annual crops (Calm et al, 1993; Melgar et al.,<br>
		1992) however, charcoal can adsorb and hold nutrients at the root level of plants<br>
		and reduce teaching. (Lehmann, 2000). Charcoal also acts to increase soil's water<br>
	25 	holding capacity and increase cation exchangc capacity. (Glaser, 1999). Evidence<br>
		in the Terra Preta soils show that these traits do not diminish significantly with<br>
		time and therefore new exchange sites are being created, however slowly.<br>
		Charcoal does breakdown through abiotic oxidation of elemental C to CO 2,<br>
		howevar, under environmental conditions, this process is extremely slow (Shneour<br>
	30 	1966). It is known that can fungi and bacteria are capable of de-grading low-rank<br>
		coals such as brown coal (Fakoussa and Hofrichter 1999). It has been shown<br>
		(Hofrichter et al. 1999) that extracellular manganese pcroxidase is an enzyme of<br>
		wood-rotting and leaflitter-decaying basidiomycetes capable of degrading<br>
		micromolecular fractions of brown coal (lignite). As a result of such decay,<br>
	35 	reactive products such as phenoxy, peroxyl and C-centred radicals are formed<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2004/037747						PCT/US2003/033553<br>
	5 	which subsequently undergo non-cnzymatic reactions leading to the cleavage of<br>
		covalent bonds, including the fission of aromatic rings. (Glaser, et al.2002)<br>
		Charcoal has the potential to form organo-mineral complexes (Ma et al. 1979),<br>
		which are found in Terra Preta soils (Glaser el al. 2000). The assumption is that<br>
	10 	slow oxidation (biotic and/or abiotic) on the edges of the aromatic backbone of<br>
		charcoal forming carboxylic groups is responsible for both the potential of<br>
		farming organo-mineral complexes and the sustainable increase in CEC (Glaser<br>
		1999; Glaser et al, 2000, 2001a). From the stand point of carbon sequestration,<br>
		this means that it is not a permanent removal but from the vantage point of a soil<br>
	15 	amendment, it has value now and will continue to add value to soils just as the<br>
		charcoal added to the Terra Preta soils have done for the last few thousand years.<br>
		The open pore structure can provide sate haven from famual predators for essential<br>
		symbiotic microbial communities (Pietkien, Zackrisson et al. (1996). In her<br>
	20 	research she investigated microbial communities that would repopolate the ground<br>
		after a forest fire. In the experiment she prepared four adorbents, pumice (Purn),<br>
		activated carbon (AcTC), charcoal from Empetyum nigrum twigs (EmpCh), and<br>
		charcoal from humus (HuCh) (pyrolyzed at 450C). A 25 gram microcosm of<br>
		untreated humus was covered by 25 grams of the above adsorbents and moistened<br>
	25 	regularly with litter extract that contained 170 mg 1-1 glucose, which was included<br>
		in the total concerntration of organic C (730 mg1-1).The adsorbents bound organic<br>
		compounds with different affinities; the adsorbing capacity increased in the ordor<br>
		Purn 
		microbial biomass in the adsorbents followed the order EmpCh &gt; HuCh &gt; ActC &gt;<br>
	30 	Purn (V, Fig. I). Activiry, measured as basal respiration and rate of bacterial<br>
		growth rate, were higher in both EmpCh, HuCh than in ActC or Purn. In her<br>
		analysis, she observes that microbes attached themselves to the charcoal particles<br>
		and preferentially degraded the adsorbed substrates as with biological activated<br>
		carbon beds (De Laat et al. 1985, Kim et al. 1997). She concluded that charcoal<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2004/037747						PCT/US2003/033553<br>
	5 	formed by combustion when moistened with substrate-rich litter extract was<br>
		capable of supporting microbial communities,<br>
		The importance of soil fertility and for need for thriving symbiotic miciobial<br>
		communities cannot be understated. While we no not understand their functions,<br>
	10 	the millious of specieas of fungi, bacteria and other microbiota represent over 15% <br>
		of all species on the earth. From their roles nitrogen fixing to providing plant<br>
		defenses, the life below ground represents an ecosystem with thousands to<br>
		hundreds of thousands of interacting species. (Hanksworth et al. 1992; (Truper<br>
		1992). The development of a carbon based fertilizer should have aspects that<br>
	15 	facilitate soil microbe activity. In the production of charcoal, volatile organic<br>
		species are evolved during the rise in temperature. From 280C to 450C this<br>
		exthermic proces can continue in an oxygen starvad environment as is well<br>
		known to those skoilled in charcoal production. These gases (Runkcl mi Wilke,<br>
		1951) as the move through the carbonizing material, are distilled with other<br>
	20 	molecules forming both shorter and longer chain molecules. Longer chain<br>
		molecules have higher dew points. These new compounds then condense to form<br>
		intraparticle condensates. The continued rise in temperature during the<br>
		exothermic phase repeats this process many times before vapor phase molecules<br>
		leave the char particle. Under increased pressure and subsequent high daw points,<br>
	25 	thses compounds will remain as additional char (US 5,551,958). Evidence that<br>
		the condensates provide a source of nutrients for microbial activity from charcoal<br>
		pyrolyais were demonstrated by the US Geological Survey (Michel, 1999). At<br>
		condense. To drive off these remaining molecules require higher temperatures, as<br>
	30 	is well known to those who make activated carbons, and when charcoal is halted<br>
		at lower temperatures, these compounds remain. This evidence supports the<br>
		results from Pitikein that charred wood perform better as a host site for microbial<br>
		communities due 10 the incomplete combustion and available sources of nutrients.<br>
		There may also be other factors also present which are currently unknown.<br>

	5 	It is well know to those skilled in the art of pyrolysis that above 425C, that the<br>
		pipes and reactors remain clear of tar deposits. By removing char from its heated<br>
		environment at close proximity to this number we can allow a certain amounts of<br>
		volatile organics to remain in the char while still converting the material into a<br>
		stable form of carbon, The majority will convert into polynuclear aromatic and<br>
	10 	heteroaromatic ring systems as structural units. These have been shown to provide<br>
		charcoals with chemical and microbiological resistance (Haumaier and Zech <br>
		1995; Glaser et al.1998), but not total immunity.<br>
		Limited work has been published on optimizing charcoal production for use as a<br>
	15 	soil amendment Glaser, Lehmann and Zech's work in Biology and Fertility of<br>
		Soila, 2002; 35:219-230 present an Excellent review of published material. This<br>
		work reviews the evidence and past work in studying charcoal production and<br>
		impact as a soil amendment. The Food and Fertilizer Technology Center for the<br>
		Asian and Pacific Region instructs in a leaflet for fanners on the use of charcoal<br>
	20 	that they can experience 10-40% increases and show research results of 138%<br>
		increases with charcoal plus fertilizer over fertilization alone. The leaflet instructs<br>
		methods of making rice hull char in an above ground mound charring system.<br>
		Instructions were limited to charring the material until it was "smoked black" and<br>
		to not let it turn to ash.<br>
	25<br>
		The use of charcoal and activated carbon for fertilizers and soil amendments is <br>
		well known and has been referenced by US 2684295. US 4529434, US 4670039,<br>
		US 5127187, US 522561, US 5921024, YS 6273927, and US 6302396. Each of<br>
		these teach that charcoal or activated carbon is a fertilizer component but do not<br>
	30 	instruct on its manufacture or optimization for this purpose.<br>
		Other patents give more details. US 3259501 teaches the use of an ammoniated<br>
		and charred rice hulls for fertilizer and US 2171408 teaches the use of sulfuric<br>
		acid activated carbons for fertilizer due to high ion exchange capacity. No<br>
		instruction is given on the manufacture of the charcoal. US 3146087 describes a<br>

		BR 422061 teaches that acid groups created in charcoal by chlorine treatment<br>
		allow adsorption of nitrogen compounds allowing up to 20% available nitrogen.<br>
		However, the inventor does not relay that this can be developed by a state within a<br>
		temperature profile of carbonization. He does offer that a gas treatment of chlorine<br>
	15 	on a moistened carbonized materials and a treatment on the same by ammonia gas<br>
		or aqueous ammonia followed by blown air will produce a good ammonia<br>

		were formed from Iignin and cellulose at 400-500C. (Matsui, et al. 2000;<br>

	It is therefore an object of this present invention to provide an effective soil <br>
	amendment containing a source of nitrogen or may also include one or more of<br>
	soil nutrients. Additionally, this material will have properties that provide long<br>
	term benefit to the user by increasing cation exchange, increasing water holding<br><br>

	DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
25 	The pyrolysis of biomass materials and the steam reforming of the off gases<br>
	and/or pyrolysis liquids produce significant amounts of hydrogen and a solid char<br>
	product Hydrogen, after separation, can be converted into ammonia using the<br>
	industry standard Haber-Bosch process as the two reactions operate at the same<br>
	temperature range. The ammonia when combined carbon dioxide (CO2) form<br>
30 	ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3), with sulfur dioxide or nitrous oxide and a<br>
	platinum and nickel catalyst will form HNO3 and H2SO4. These which combined<br>
	with NH3 will form as an intermediate of NH3 HCO3 and (NH2)2CO production<br>
	process, to form additional fertilizer species, (NH4)NO3 and (NH4)2SO4. The<br>
	invention described here is the simulaneous production of hydrogen, its<br>
35 	conversion into ammonia, a porous char, the combination of ammonia, and the<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2004/037747						PCT/US2003/033553<br>
5 	flue gases of combustion or other high percentage sources of carbon dioxide and<br>
	the porous char in order to deposition of nitrogen rich compounds in the pote<br>
	structure of the carbonaceous material. The invention, provides the use of this<br>
	combined porous adsorbent char, enriched with nitrogen compounds, as a slow<br>
	release fertilizer/soil amendment with also is a novel inemod for sequestering<br>
10 	largo amounts of carton from the atmosphere. Char makes a perfect media for<br>
	storing significant quintities of compounds. The combination of nitrogen<br>
	compounds created in and on me carbon can produce a slow release nitrogen<br>
	fertilizer with many advantages over tradional ammonium nitrate, urea or liquid<br>
	ammonia. One of these is that it is less reactive reducing the risk of it being used<br>
15 	a compound for making explosives.<br>
	Since both the bicarbonate HCO3 of NH4HCO3 and the elementary carbon (C) of<br>
	the char materials are nondigestible to soil bacteria, they can be stored in soil and<br>
	subsoil earth layers as sequestrated carbons for many years. Therefore, a<br>
20 	combined NB4HCO3-char product can not only provide nutrients (such as NH4)<br>
	for plant growth, but also has the potential to fully utilize the capacity of soil and<br>
	subsoil earth layers to store both inorganic carbon (such as HCO3 ) and organic<br>
	elementary carbon (C). Urea (NH2)2CO can also be combined with the char<br>
	materials to form a similar product However, the urea production process<br>
25 	generally costs some more energy and has less capacity to solidify CO2 than the<br>
	CO2-solidifying NH4CO3 production process (U.S. patent No. 6,441,43781).<br>
	The char malerials are also mixable with other nitrogen fertilizer species such as<br>
	NH4NO3 and (NH4)SC4, but those mixtures would not have the benefits of<br>
	providing bicarbonate (HCO3) to soils. Therefore, the combined NH4HCO3-char<br>
30 	product is preferred in realizing the -maximal carbon-sequestration potentil in soil<br>
	and subsoil earth layers.<br>
	Furthermore, the combined NH4HCO3-char product has synergistic benefits.<br>
	First, th0e char particles can be used as catalysts (providing more effective<br>
35 	nacleation sites) to speed up the formation of solid NH4HCO3 particles in the CO2-<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2004/037747						PCT/US2003/033553<br>
5 	solidifying NH4HCO3 production process, thus enhancing the efficiency of the<br>
	CO2-solidifymg technology. Second, the char materials are generally alkaline in<br>
	pH because of the presence of certain mineral oxides in the ash product This pH<br>
	value of a typical char material is about 9.8. This alkaline material may not be<br>
	favorable for use in alkaline soils such as those in the western United States while<br>
10 	it is very suitable for use in acidic soils such as those in the estern United States.<br>
	However, use of NH4HCO3 can neutralize the alkali of the char materials. When<br>
	the char materials are mixed with NH4HCO3 of equal weight, the pH of the<br>
	product becomes much better (closer to neutral pH 7). As illustrated in Table 1,<br>
	the pH value of the NH4HCO3-char mixture is 7.89, which is significantly lower<br>
15 	(better) than that of the char material (pH 9.85). Therefore, this type of<br>
	NH4HCO3-char combined fertilizer will be able to be used in alkaline soils, in<br>
	addition to pH neutral and acidic soils. This type of NH4HCO3-char fertilizer can<br>
	be produced either by the char particle-enhanced NH4HCO3-solidifying NH4HCO3<br>
	production process or by physically mixing NH4HCO3 with char materials.<br>
20 	Figure 1 presents photograph of the NH4HCO3-char fertilizer samples that were<br>
	created by char particle-enhanced NH4-CO2-solidifying NH4HCO3 production<br>
	process [marked as "treated char"] and by a physical mixing of NH4HCO3 and<br>
	char [marked as "NH4HCO3-char mixture (50%50%W)"]. Depending on the<br>
	amount of NH4HCO3 deposited onto the char particles by char particle-enhanced<br>
25 	NH3-CO2-solidifying NH4HCO3 production process, the treated char has a pH<br>
	value of 8.76 in this particular sample. The pH of the product can be further<br>
	improved by deposition moreNH4HCO3 onto the char particles by the process.<br>
	When the NH4HCO3-char product is applied into soil, it can generate another<br>
30 	synergistic benefit. For example, in the western parts of China and the United<br>
	States China where the soils contains significantly higher amount of alkaline earth<br>
	minerals and where the soil pH value is generally above 8, when NH4HCO3 is<br>
	used alone, its HCO3 can neutralize certain alkaline earth minerals such as<br>
	[Ca(OH)]+ and/or Ca++ to form stable carbonated mineral products such as CaCO3<br>
35 	that can serve as a permanent sequestration of the carbon. As more and more<br>

5 	nitrate, and micro mineral nutrints such as iron and molybdenum to make more-<br>
	nutrient-complete compound fertilizers.<br>
	Example 1<br>
	We produced 5 different chars from peanut shells, at different temperatures<br>
10 	(900°C, 600°C, 500°C, 450°C and 400°C) in a low oxygen environment. In each<br>
	case, the samples were brought to the target temperature for 1 minute. The<br>
	samples were taken up to temperature and then allowed to cool. Next the materials<br>
	were pound and sieved to a particle size less than 30 US mesh and greater than 45<br>
	US mesh and prepared 20.0-gram samples. We mixed an aqueous solution of<br>
	15 48% NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate). Each sample was soaked for 5 minutes and<br>
	then poured through cone filter paper and allowed to air dry for 24 hours. We then<br>
	poured rinses of 100 ml of tap water (pH8) through the cone filter. The pH of each<br>
	resulting rinse was measured showing a decreasing pH commensurate with the<br>
	leaching rates of each material.<br>
20<br>
	There was very little difference between the samples except for the one prepared<br>
	at 400°C. After three or four rinses, the materials, which were carbonized at the<br>
	higher temperatures, would stabilize at the pH 8 of the rinse material (local tap<br>
	water). The 400°C char showed very little ehange and it was only after the 9th<br>
25 	rinse that it began 10 drop a bit faster but even after 12 rinses it still had not<br>
	stabilized.<br><br>
19<br><br>

5 	The work by Asada on bamboo charcoal demonstrated similar impacts on<br>
	ammonia adsorption.<br>
	Example Two<br>
	While the process can apply to many configurations, this example uses S relatively<br>
10 	simple production technique. In this case, we used a mechanical fluidized bed<br>
	easily adaptable to any gas stream and injected CO2, and hydrated ammonia. A<br>
	250g charge of 30-45 mesh (0.4mm - 0.6mm), 400°C char was fed in at regular<br>
	intetvals varying from 15-30 minutes. A higher rotor speed increased the<br>
	fluidization and suspended the particles until they became too heavy from the<br>
15 	deposition of NH4HCO3 to be supported by fluidized gas flows. The longer<br>
	durations produced significanfly larger particles. At 10-15 minutes the particles<br>
	ranged from l.0mm to 2.0mm and between 20-30 minutes they ranged from 3.0 to<br>
	6.00mm. The interior of the particles were then examined under a scanning<br>
	election microscope. Internal pore structure showed significant formations of<br>
20 	structures of NH4HCO3 at 10-15 minutes. The material produced between 20-30<br>
	minutes had completely filled internal pores and cavities.<br><br>

5 	Global Potential<br>
	This chart shows the number of kg of CO2 per million BTUs of each type fuel.<br>
	Fossil fuels have a significant carbon cost. Hydrogen used as a fuel with carbon<br>
	utilization can remove 112kg of CO2 per GJ of energy used. Current energy use is<br>
10 	increasing CO2 by 6.1 Gt/yr (IPCC). Renewable hydrogen with carbon utilization<br>
	and CO2 capture can provide energy with a negative carbon component. To<br>
	calculate how much negative energy we would need to use at 112kg of CO2<br>
	captured and utilized per 1GJ, to equal the world's 6.1 gigaton CO2 annual<br>
	surplus, we divide 6.1Gt/112kg to yield 54Bj. That is approximately what is<br>
15 	reported at the world current annual bioenergy consumption (55EJ-Hall)<br><br>
40 	The large majority of increases in CO2 will come from economically developing<br>
	countries as their burgeoning entrepreneurial populations industrialize. A<br>
	sustainable techsnology needs to be able to scale to meet the growng needs of this<br>
	large segment of the population. Developing an economical size that offers a<br>
	profitable platform may require certain minirmims and it may be that the lower<br>
45 	limit of economical production are larger than typical biamass conversion<br>
	systems. A 1-2 MW facility could be the lower limit yet there are two factors that<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2004/037747						PCT/US2003/033553<br>
5 	are important to note. The first is that the low relative efficiencies required by<br>
	both the hydrogen separation and the ammonia production may allow a smaller<br>
	foot print system to be developed using new technologies. Future research efforts<br>
	in separations technologies and ammonia catalyst could offer developments that<br>
	lead to systems for even very small fanning communities.<br>
10<br>
	The second point is that the total hydrogen is approximately three times the<br>
	maximam that can be utilized in one facility, so every third facility could be<br>
	designed to accept the charcoal that is produced by two standalone energy<br>
	systems. This special facility could process all of its hydrogen and the carbon<br>
15 	from two other locations and use existing industrial ammonia manufacturing<br>
	techniques to create the carbon-fertlizer. If all hydrogen is converted to fertilizer<br>
	then there is an opportunity to acquire outside CO2 (34 kg required for each 100<br>
	kg biomass processed) and the opportunity to earn revenue from SOx, NOx<br>
	removal could provide it with another income stream and help its economics. It<br>
20 	would also fit closely inio strategies of developing areas that wish to attract and<br>
	support GHG emitting manufacturing.<br>
	The energy from a total systems point of view could create a viable pathway to<br>
	carbon negative energy as detailed in the IIASA focus on Bioenergy Utilization<br>
25	 with CO2 Capture and Sequestration (BECS). The effects shown in the prior<br>
	graph (Figure 16) (i.e. providing 112kg of CO2 removal for each GJ of energy<br>
	used) could allow major manufacturers to offset their carbon costs. The graph in<br>
	Figure 17 shows various materials used in automobile manufacturing and the life<br>
	cycle, analysis of carbon emissions per kilogram. The second bar in stripes<br>
30 	represents the weight of biomass using this process, which would be required to<br>
	offset that carbon cost. The third bar, extending down in the checked pattern,<br>
	shows the amount of sequestered carbon that would be created if the process were<br>
	used to produce all the energy required for production and the last bar represents<br>
	the amount of biomass required to meet the energy needs of producing that<br>
35 	amount of the automotive material. In some materials, the amounts needed for<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2004/037747						PCT/US2003/033553<br>
5 	energy production are less that the amounts needed for needed offset. This<br>
	illustrates that energy is just one aspect of GHG production related to materials<br>
	manufacturing and that metbods for offenttins CO2 release are essential.<br><br>
10<br>
	The opportunity for economically developing areas with biomass is to utilize their<br>
	resources to help manufacturers reach carbon-negative status. If the material<br>
	leaves a factory with a net carbon negative budget then the behavior of<br>
	consumerism becomes an agent of climate mitigation and supports economies in<br>
15 	side stepping fossil fuel pathways.<br>
	How large could this method be applied and to what areas of the earth could<br>
	utilized a concerted effort to reclaim eroded land and increase current farmland<br>
	production are areas for furture research. The positive impact of an increased soil<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2004/037747						PCT/US2003/033553<br>
5 	carbon content ultimately leads to increased food and plant yields, further helping<br>
	to reduce CO2 buildup. There is very little information on the maximum rates of<br>
	utilization, though 10,000 kg/ha of char have been used with very positive results<br>
	and researchers have proposed that as little as 2000 kg/ha could prove beneficial<br>
	for plant growth. (Glaser,et al. 2002; ICFAC.2002)<br>
10<br>
	For a quick test of reasonableness, we saw from above that 1GJ of hydrogen<br>
	produced and used will represent 112kg of utilized and stored carbon dioxide.<br>
	Therefore, taking the atmospheric rise of 6.1GT and dividing by 112kg/Gj =<br>
	54.5EJ. This number fa11s amazingly along the 55EJ estimate of the corrent<br>
15 	amount of biomass. that is used for energy in the world today.(Hall et al. 1983)<br>
	While the potential reaches many times this for the future utilization of biomass,<br>
	this snows that there is a chance that we can be proactive in our approach.<br>
	Technical / Economic Overview and Global Impacts<br>
20 	A study of the economics of the OENL process for NH4HCO3 production from<br>
	fossil fuel scrubbing was conducted by the University of Tennessee ("UT Study")<br>
	in 2001. There are also ongoing economic evaluations of renewable hydrogen<br>
	production from the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Those studies<br>
	can provide the outer framework for this preliminary economic estimate. The UT,<br>
25 	examined the economics of producing ammonium bicarbonate in the exhaust<br>
	stream of fossil fuel combustion. It assumed the use of natural gas to produce <br>
	ammonia and the subsequent conversion to ammonium bicarbonate. Since, this<br>
	was prior to the use of charcoal inclution, it did not include any economic gains, <br>
	which could be attributed to chercoal. Some gains benefit the fossil foel user.<br>
30 	These include a single system for removal of CO2, SOx and NOx, no required<br>
	drying of the final product and offsettng income from fertilizer sales. Optimally,<br>
	fossil fuel users will partner with fertilizer manufacturers to use their existing<br>
	market penetration. Fertilizer manufacturing firms, which have been relegated to<br>
	the sale of commodity goods, can reinvent their product offerings to include<br>
35 	service-based delivery of soil fertility and management of soil carbon content<br>

5 	The economic projections of the UT study were based on a market value of the<br>
	end product at $2.63/lb atom of nitrogen based on 1999 prices of nitrogen<br>
	fertilizer. Today's prices are significantly higher due to increased natural gas<br>
	prices. However, with a target of 20% CO2 removal, the study concluded that a<br>
	700 MW facility would be optimally sized for the economical production<br>
10 	fertilizer and would yield a after tax ROI of $0.33. The investment required to<br>
	meet this level of CO2 capture was calculated to be $229 million. The same<br>
	amount of carbon captured with ECOSS, where 88% of the target will be met by<br>
	the carbon contained in the char would only require a production unit one-fifh the<br>
	size and possibly smaller. Additionally, the system can be much simpler than what<br>
15 	was required to convert 100% of hydrogen produced into ammonia. With this<br>
	approach, the engineering and construction costs can be significantly reduced.<br>
	While economics and scale of ammonia production typically favor larger<br>
	installations, Kyoto reduction targets can be met through smaller facilities where<br>
	the efficiency is in carbon utilization.<br>
20<br>
	The UT study assumed the world's consumption and demand for nitrogen would<br>
	became the limiting factor in how much carbon could be captured. The total<br>
	market for nitrogen in 1999 was 80.95 million tons, which then converted at the<br>
	power plant targeting 20% redactions in CO2, lead to the determination that 337<br>
25 	fossil fuel plants of 237 MW each would meet world fertilizer demand. Their <br>
	calculations showed that this would reduce the global C output from coal<br>
	combustion by 3.15%. The study also assumed the use of natural gas to make the<br>
	ammonia. The total stoichiometric calculation for ammonia from natural gas and<br>
	the conversion of 8Ib-moles of NH3 into NH4HCO3 which captures 5 Ib moles of<br>
30 	CO2. With renewable hydrogen to make ammonia, no fossil fuel based CO2 is<br>
	release into the atmosphere and the following is found,<br>
	8NH3+8CO2+8H2O&gt;8NH4CO3.<br>
	Therefore, renewable hydrogen allows a 1.6 times increase in CO2 captured per lb-<br>
35 	mole of NH4HCO3 produced. Utilizing the study above, a switch to renewable<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2004/037747						PCT/US2003/033553<br>
5 	hydrogen would increase carbon capture, 3.15 x 1.6 = 5.04%. However, carbon<br>
	closure of biomass energy is not zero but has been calculated (Spath&amp;Mann-1997)<br>
	at 95%. A more accurate number would be 5.04 x 95%= 4.79% reduction in C<br>
	from worldwide coal combustion if renewable H2 as the source for producing<br>
	ammonia and all the world's N requirements are met from NH4HCO3 scrubbed<br>
10 	from power plant exhaust.<br>
	As slated before, the total C captured in the combined ECOSS material was 12%<br>
	from fertilizer and 88% from char. Taking the theoretical number of 4.79% and <br>
	equating mat to the 12% portion of ECOSS, would mean that the total carbon<br>
15 	capture at 1999 N levels would be increased or leveraged 100 / 12 = 8.3 fold or<br>
	reduce total C from coal combustion by -39.9%. This leveraged total should be<br>
	seen as a theoretical potential. The factors of increased biomass growth with the<br>
	addition of charcoal as found by Mann (2002), Hoshi(2002), Glaser(2002),<br>
	Nishio(1999) and Ogawa(1983) show increase biomass growth from 17% to as<br>
20 	280% with non-optimized char. The direct utilization of an optimized char plus<br>
	slow release nitrogen/nutrients may allow the increase biomass growth targets<br>
	organic matter, further increasing C capture (especially if no-till management<br>
	practices are adopted). Therefore, another bracket in our assessment of this<br>
25 	process is the increase in non-fossil fuel CO2 capture from biomass growth in<br>
	addition to the leveraged total.<br>
	The ability to slow down the release of ammonia in the soil will allow plants to<br>
	increase their uptake of nitrogen. This will lead to a reduction in NO2<br>
30 	atmospheric release. This potent greenhouse gas is equivalent to 310x the impact<br>
	of CO2. The fertilizer industry releases CO2 during the manufacture of ammonia<br>
	from methane.<br>
4N2 +3CH4+6H20&gt;3CO2+ 8NH3<br>
The equation illustrates that for each ton of nitrogen produced, 0-32 tons of C are<br>
35 released, and the 80.95 million tons of nitrogen utilized would represent 26<br>

	The economics of hydrogen from biomass has been addressed in the 2001 report<br>
	by Spath et al.(2001). Their conclusion was that pyrolytic conversion of biomass<br>
10 	offered the best economics due in part to the opportunity for co-product<br>
	production and reduced capital costs. However, this assessment was based on<br>
	using bio-oil for reforming and acknowledged uncertainty in pricing for co-<br>
	products. Their analysis, at a 20% IRR, provided plant gate pricing of hydrogen<br>
	from $9.79-$11.41/GJ. In the UT study, hydrogen production equipment<br>
15 	represented 23% of the total capital equipment costs and utilized a $4/GJ expense<br>
	for methane. This cost represented -50% of total expenses and -45% of before<br>
	tax prifits. If we assume that other operational costs remain the same, with the<br>
	increased cost of natural gas, the inside plant cost of renewable hydrogen would <br>
	no longer be 2.4-2.8 times the costs from mathane, but is approaching 1.6-1.9<br>
20 	times. Since net profits were based on market price of nitrogen, then increases in<br>
	natural gas prices will change total income in the model as well. For simplicity if<br>
	we use $7/GJ, them total income would increase 1.75x and expenses related to<br>
	renewable hydrogen would roughly equal -50% of before tax profits, Iatra plant<br>
	usage of renewable hydrogen (i.e. no storage or transport expense) becomes<br>
25 	significantly more competitive at our current natural gas prices.<br>
	Another advantage comes from a review of traditional ammonia processing<br>
	methods and how they compare to the ECOSS process. The UT study| notes that<br>
	due to unfavorable equilibrium conditions inherent in NH3 conversion, only 20-<br>
30 	30% of the hydrogen is converted in a single pass. From the section in this paper<br>
	on Production Chemistry Calculations, we determined that the ECOSS process<br>
	could only utilize 31.6% of the hydrogen as we were limited by the total amount<br>
	of char produced and the target 10% nitrogen Loading. This means that it possible<br>
	that a single pass NH3 converter could be used and the expense of separating and<br>
35 	recycling unconverted hydrogen is eliminated. The 68.4% hydrogen is then<br>
28<br><br>

5 	available for sale or use by the power cornpany/fertilizfer partnership. This shows<br>
	that the ECOSS process thus favors the inefficiencies of ammonia production and<br>
	reduces costs inherent in trying to achieve high conversion raws of hydrogen<br>
	With, incresed biomass utilization for energy and increasing demands for food<br>
10 	production, the requirements for fertilization will increase. The restoration and<br>
	return of unicronutrints could allow substantive increases in overall soil<br>
	amendment applications and the potential needs for nitrogen may not be such a<br>
	limiting factor as was considered in the UT study. From a global systems view,<br>
	the combination of topsoil restoration, desert reclamation, and file associated<br>
15 	increases in biomass growth, could allow the economics to be driven not by C<br>
	capture but rather by value creation of increased soil/crop productivity.<br>
	This concept of biomass energy production with carbon utilization may open the<br>
	door to millions of tons of CO2 being removed from industrial emissions while<br>
20 	utilizing captured C to restore valuable soil carbon content. This process<br>
	simultaneously produces a zero emissions, fuel that can be used to operate farm<br>
	machinery and provide electricity for rural users, agricultural irrigation pumps,<br>
	and rural industrial parks. Future developments from the global research<br>
	community will produce a range of value added carbon containing co-prodncrs<br>
25 	from biomass. With this development and future use of inventions like this, both<br>
	the produeers of carbon dioxide and agricultural community have the capability to<br>
	become a significant part of the solution to the global rise in greenhouse gas<br>
	emissions while building sustainable economic development programs for<br>
	agricultural areas in the industrialized and economically developing societies.<br>

	well with the exothemic range for the materil. Since each biomass has<br>
	differences, there is no set rule, but most well designed pyrolysis units can operate<br>
	with little external heat after startup and with limited oxygen present. The char<br>
	removal will functions best with an automated gate or star valve which discharges<br>
15 	the char at optimal temperature ranges for the desired material. The higher<br>
	temperature chars will release nutrients faster than lower temperature chars and<br>
	according to the use and application of the fertilizer. However the range to insure<br>
	maximum ammonia uptake will be less than 500C and above 350C. When<br>
	dealing with any new biomass, adsorption rates should be tested to establish<br>
	range of pyrolysis temperatures using a small furnace. Those skilled in the art can<br>
	measure adsorption of ammonia on char using a sampling bag (tedlar tag), with a<br>
	started concentration of ammonia, char and using an analytical ammonia<br>
	detector. As raw materials will vary, these tests can insure a baseline performance<br>
25 	in scrubbing as well aa in fertilizer performance. The inert heal source can be one<br>
	of many gas, flue gag, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, but gas should be chosen to be<br>
	compatible with the hydrogen production system. In the case of hydrogen steam<br>

	into a nonoxidative chamber or transfer unit 108. The char can be allowed to cool<br>

	is unknown.<br>
	The hydrogen production system, 106 while shown as steam reforming followed<br>
10 	by CO shift, this system can be any unit that produces hydrogen suitable for<br>
	continued processing into ammonia. The preferred system for maximum<br>
	atmospheric carbon reduction is one which uses biomass or renewably derived<br>
	fuels and derives its energy from a carbon neutral or negative source. Gases 109<br>
	containing primarily hydrogen and CO2 are separated using pressure swing<br>
15 	adsorption 110 or other industry acceptable methods. The carbon dioxide 114 is<br>
	greenhouse neutral at this point and can be released or used to replace 115 flue gas<br>
	if there is no fossil fuel cased carbon dioxide 123 available. When operated in this<br>
	manner the energy derived has an even higher effective carbon negative<br>
	accounting. Ammonia production 117 is shown as using the Haber process or<br>
20 	other economically and industry accepted methods for ammonia production. At<br>
	conditions needed to sequester .75 to 1.5 tons per hectare of carbon and provide<br>
	sufficient charcoal to offer substantive plant response, a 10% nitrogen content is<br>
	recommended. The resulting balance then points to 60-67% of the hydrogen<br>
	produced will be available for sale. This lends to a configuration where 3<br>
25 	locations feed one which is the capture and fertilizer production center. The others<br>
	produce hydrogen and or energy and charcoal which is sent then to one location<br>
	where all of its hydrogen is utilized.<br>
	The ammonia produced 118 is then saturated with water by bubbling ammonia<br>
30 	through water 119. This reaction produces heat and the water levels need to be<br>
	monitored and automatically maintained. The gas phase hydrated amoionia 120 is<br>
	then allowed to enter a chamber 121 with the charcoal. This saturation will be<br>
	suffciently complete in 3-10 seconds, according to particle size. The<br>

	temperature range. The ammonia when combined carbon dioxide (CO2) form<br>
	ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3), with snifter dioxide or nitrous oxide and a<br>

	flue gases of combustion or other high percentage sources of carbon dioxide and<br>
15.	the porous char in order to deposition of nitrogen rich compounds in the pore<br>
	structure of the carbonaceous material. The invention provides the use of this<br>
	combined porous adsorbent char, entriched with nitrogen compounds, slow<br>
	release design coating from plaster, polymer and/or sulfer, for a slow release<br>
	fertilizer/soil amendment with which is a novel method for sequestering large<br>
20 	amounts of carbon from the atmosphere. Char makes a perfect media for storing<br>
	significant quantities of compounds. The combination of nitrogen compounds<br>
	created in and on the carbon can produce a slow release nitrogen fertilizer with<br>
	many advantages over traditional ammonium nitrate, urea or liquid ammonia. <br>
	One of these is, that it is less reactive redusing the risk of it bening used a<br>
25 	compound for making exploaivea.<br>
	Since both the bicarbonate HCO3 of NH4HCO3 and the elementary carbon (C) of<br>
	the char materials are nondigestible to soil bacteria, they can be stored in soil and<br>
	subsoil earth layers as sequestrated carbons for many years. Therefore, a<br>
30 	combined NH4HCO3 -char product can not only provide nutrients (such as NH4)<br>
	for plant growth, but also has the potential to fully utilize the capacity of soil and<br>
	subsoil eaitti layers to store both inorganic carbon (such as HCO3 ) and organic<br>
	eleinentary carbon (C). Urea (NH2)2CO can also be combined with the char<br>

	The char materials are also mixable with other nitrogen fertilizer species such as<br>
	NH4NO3 and (NH4)SO4, bul those mixtures would not have the benefits of<br>
	providing bicarbonate (HCO3 ) to soils. Therefore, the combined NH4HCO3-char<br>
	product is preferred in realizing the maximal carbon-sequescation potential in soil<br>
10 	and subsoil earth layers (Figs. 1 and 2).<br>
	Futhermore, the combined NH4HCO3-char product has synergistic benefits.<br>
	First, the char particles can be used as catalysta (providing more effective<br>
	nucleantion sites) to speed up fee formation of solid NH4HCO3 particles in the CO2-<br>
15 	solidifynig NH4HCO3 production process, thus enhancing the efficiency of the<br>
	CO2-solidifying technology. Second, the char materials are generally alkaline in<br>
	pH because of the presence of certain mineral oxides in the ash product. The pH<br>
	value of a typical char material is about 9.8. This alkaline material may not be<br>
	favorable for use in alkaline soils such as those in the western United States while<br>
20 	it is very suitable for use is acidic soils such as those in the eastern United States. <br>
	However, use of NH4HCO3 can neutralize the alkaline of the char materials. When<br>
	the char materials are mixed with NH4HCO3 of equal weight, the pH of the<br>
	product becomes much better (closer to neutral pH 7). As illustrated in Table 1,<br>
	the pH value of the NH4HCO3-char mixture is 7.89, which is significantly lower<br>
25 	(better) than that of the chat material (pH 9.85). Therefore, this type of<br>
	NH4HCO3-Char combined fertilizer will be able to be used in alkaline soils, in<br>
	addition to pH neutral and acidic soils. This type of NH4HCO3-char fertilizer can<br>
	be produced either by the char particle-enhanced NH3CO2Solidifying NH4HCO3<br>
	production, process (Fig. 3) or by physically mixing NH4HCO3 with char<br>
30 	materials. Figure 4 presents photograph of the NH4HCO3-char fertilizer samples<br>
	that were created hy char particle-enhanced NH3-CO2-solidifying NH4HCO3<br>
	production process [marked as "treated char'] and by a physical mixing of<br>
	NH4HCO3 and char [marked as "NH4HCO3-char mixture (50%/50%W)"].<br>
	Depending on the amount of NH4HCO3 deposited onto the char particles by char<br>

WO 2004/037747						PCT/US2003/033553<br>
5 	char has a pH value of 8.75 in this particular sample. The pH of the product can<br>
	be further improved by deposition more NH4HCO3 onto the char particles by the<br>
	process.<br>
	When the NH4HCO3-char product is applied into soil, it can generate yet another<br>
10 	synergistic benefit. For example, in the western parts of China, and the United<br>
	States where the soils contains significantly higher amount of alkaline earth<br>
	minerals and where the soil pH value is generally above 8, when NH4HCO3 is<br>
	used alone, its HCO3 can neutralize certain alkaline earth mineralB such as<br>
	[Ca(QH)]4 and/or Ca++ to form stable carbonated mineraldi products such as CaCO3<br>
15 	that can serve as a permanent scquestrarjoa of the carborn As more and more<br>
	carbonated earth mineral products are formed when NH4HCO3 is used repeatedly<br>
	as fertilizer for tens of years, some of the soils could gradually become hardeued. <br>
	This type of "soil hardening' has bee noticed in some of soils in the western part<br>
	of China where NH4HCO3 has been used as a fertilizer for over 30 years. It is also<br>
20 	known that this type of soil "hardening" problem could be overcome by<br>
	application of organic manure including humus. Char is another ideal organic<br>
	material that can overcome the "soil hardening" problem because of its soft,<br>
	porous, and absorbent properties. Therefore, co-use of NH4HCO3 and char<br>
	materials together can allow continued formation of carbonated mineral products<br>
25 	such as CaCO3 and/or MgCO3 to sequester maximal amount of carbons into the<br>
	soil and subsoil terrains while still maintaining good soil properties for plant<br>
	growth.<br>
	Another embodiment of the invention can be to also add other nutrients to the<br>
30 	carbon. The material itself contains trace minerals needed for plant growth.<br>
	Adding phosphorus, calcium and magnesium can augment performance and create<br>
	a slow release micro nutrient delivery system.<br>
	Another embodiment of the invention can include the processing of the carbon to<br>
35	 produce very large pore structures. The material can be used as an agent to<br>

WO 2004/037747						PCT/US2003/033553<br>
5 	capture watershed runoff of pesticides, and herbicides. By edding a deposition of<br>
	various materials (example: gaseous iron oxide), the material can be uaed to<br>
	capture such compounds as phosphorus from animal feedlots.<br>
	Another embodiment for the invention is to use standard Industrial processes well<br>
10 	known to those skilled in the arts, to use the hydrogen produced, combined with<br>
	air and other free nitrogen present in the production process to create the ammonia<br>
	that will be used as the nitrogen source material.<br>
	Based on market demands, these products can be further combined with other<br>
15 	fertilizer species such as potassium, magnesium, ammonium sulfate, ammonium<br>
	nitrate, and micro mineral nutrients such as iron molybdenum to make more- <br>
	nutrient-complete compoand fertilizers.<br>
	To assist an appreciation by those of skill of The art for the scope of exemplary<br>
20 	embodiment of the present invention, the Applicants have identified within the<br>
	body of this technical specification certain publications relevant to the technical<br>
	field of the present invention. Applicants have used an identifier of the format<br>
	"Author(s)/Publication year" to provide a readily recognizable identifier for these<br>

This invention relates a series of steps to provide an economical production of a carbon based<br>
fertilizer and soil amendment made during the capture of greenhouse gases from the<br>
combustion of fossil and nan fossil fuels. The invention uses biomass and other carbonaceous<br>
sources through pyrolytic conversion to gases and charcoal to allow for the further<br>
production of co-products, such as hydrogen and ammonia. The invention also relates to the<br>
combination of hydrated ammonia, combustion flue gas exhaust, and charcoal, provide for<br>
the conversion of the charcoal into a valued added soil amendment to return essential trace<br>
minerals and plant nutrients to the soil. The ability to produce a large volume carbon co-<br>
product while removing mandated emissions and producing renewable based hydrogen<br>
provides an economic gain to a large number small and large businesses and increase the<br>
chance of achieving significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.<br></td>
