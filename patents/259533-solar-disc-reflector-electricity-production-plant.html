				<td>Invention is related to Solar Disc Reflector Electricity Production Plant<br>
Preface:- In modern age new new techniques are being adopted to obtain electrical energy in which to obtain electrical energy expenditure is incurred like from Diesel, Petrol, coal etc. machines are operated through the energy obtained &amp; electricity is produced through the operation of Dynamo, Generator etc. in the same context electricity production form the speed (velocity) of air through wind mill, electricity production from the water current etc. have been major sources. Today we consider electricity is an inseparable tool of our lives that nothing is possible without it in our life. Today our need of electricity has increased so much that it is difficult for the electricity department to supply. The cost of electricity has increased so much that we are making its payment with a lot of difficulty. Thefts of electricity are increasing day by day. Due to this theft of electricity and the cost incurred on the loss of electricity in the maintenance of electricity the cost has to be born by the honest consumer even then we are not getting electricity on time and as per our requirement.<br>
In this environment scientists developed a new technique to produce electricity from the solar plates in which electricity is obtained in the sunlight by fitting a panel plate of solar cells on a specific angle in the south direction on the roof of the house in the sunlight. The electricity obtained like this is D.C. which is received in low voltage which is stored in the battery through electricity charger instrument and later on through D.C. light instrument and inverter D.C. is converted to A.C. appropriate volt is increased A.C. light instruments are operated which stop automatically when the battery is discharged after sometimes which does not fulfill our needs regularly and from the electricity obtained by this method only single pace electrical equipment of less power can be operated.<br>
Through this technique of mine after considering that electricity obtained by this method is not utilized fully developed a new technique. In this technique sun rays are collected and set in the water boiler from the solar disc reflector from the heat of the collected electric ray steam is generated which operates the steam engine then from belt and pully necessary R.P.M. is set electricity is produced from the operation of three phase electricity production machine generator. A.C. electricity obtained like this is converted through A.C. to D.C. transformer different phases of electricity is stored in batteries and later on in absence of sunrays or in the night this D.C. electricity is converted to A.C. all types of A.C. single phase, double phase or three phase electrical equipments are operated.<br>
A.C. electricity generator received like this all single phase domestic equipment can be directly operated from generator in the day and all three phase equipment can also be operated directly during the day and in the night or in the absence of sunlight stored electricity which is converted from D.C. to A.C. and used for domestic &amp; other purposes from electricity obtained like this twenty five to fifty percent need of our daily requirement of electricity may be met and we will get rid of the disturbance arising in our work due to absence of light. More solar disc reflectors may be installed in this plant to make necessary steam from whose rays more steam can be generated from more heat. This solar disc reflector rotates automatically in the direction of the sun from east to west through the pendulum watch which collects the sun rays points them on a specific point on the boiler from which definite heat is produced.<br><br>
Introduction<br>
In this technique of solar disc reflector electricity production plant disc reflector umbrella automatically rotates from east to west from a pendulum watch system which is installed (according to the diagram).The sun rays which are accumulated their temperature is very high, from this temperature water in water boiler boils and is converted to steam. There the steam pushes the piston of the engine from its pressure. A safety wall is installed in the steam boiler and steam goes through the exit pipes to the piston chamber of the steam operated engine (steam engine). There steam pushes the piston of the steam engine from its force. A safety wall is installed in the steam boiler by which steam engine runs with its speed. The number of solar disc reflector may be increased according to the temperature required. It may be more than one.<br>
Electricity production generator is run by steam engine's wheel through belt. To run generator on required RPM from the steam engine's wheel RPM is set through Pullys from which necessary electricity is obtained. This generator single phase, double phase three may be of any power of kilowatt of electricity production as required.<br>
Single phase, double phase or three phase electricity can be used directly during sunlight through the generator is converted from A.C. to D.C. through the transformer may be stored in all types of phases in different different batteries which later in the night or in the absence of sunlight is converted from D.C. electricity to A.C. electricity through Altinator transformer in single phase, double phase or three phase and may be used as per requirement. Both these types of A.C. &amp; D.C. (A.C. electricity which is received directly from the generator and D.C. electricity which is obtained from battery storage) are joined to a changer electricity switch which runs electrical equipment as required through lines.<br><br>
Description of Solar Electricity Production Plant<br>
(1). Solar disc reflector :- It is an oval shaped plate in which glass mirror's fiber strips, or nickel, steel polished mirror plates are fitted on the inside which like a mirror reflector reflects the recurring sunrays and centers them on a certain point on the steam boiler gives energy (heat) as required. These solar disc reflectors may be installed more than one as per requirement to gain more heat. Steam is generated in the steam boiler through these rays only.<br>
(2). Weight Pully :- After setting the solar disc reflector in East direction this pully rotates the disc towards west.<br>
(3). Pendulum Watch:- With the help of this watch only the disc reflector rotates @ per second along with the sun and reflects the recurring sun rays in the right place on the steam boiler and doesn't let a difference in the temperature come and steam is generated continuously.<br>
(4). Weight:- This weight is tied on the pully through a rope and is hanged on the pully which to the pully by its weight rotates the solar disc reflector in the west direction.<br>
(5). Weight Rope :- It is made of cotton or steel wires or nylon by which weight is hung on the pully by tying.<br>
(6). Pendulum :- It is a pendulum in a watch which by its speed limits the movement given by the solar disc reflector's bearing by limiting @ per second through the ball bearing of the watch.<br>

Claim<br>
I claim :-<br>
1 - In th solar disc electricity production equipment through solar disc reflector (1) or recurring lenses sun rays are collected and directed on a point on the boiler (9) in this boiler there is a net of spiral pipes in which water flows, on the net of these pipes of the boiler zero point rays of the sun are directed through the solar disc reflector or lenses by which the water filled in these pipes starts heating and turns into steam, this steam is sent to the piston chamber of the engine through exit pipe, the piston of the engine is operated from the pressure of this steam from which the wheel of the engine rotates and operates the electricity production equipment (generator) produces one phase or three phase electricity. After operating the piston the pressure of the steam decreases, this steam is sent from the exit door of the piston chamber through exit pipes to the water tank and cooled so that the steam again turns into water. From this water tank water is sent to the pipes of the boiler through a small electric water pump. There again the procedure that water filled in the pipe is turned into steam from the heat of solar reflector disc or lenses and is sent to the chamber of the engine is repeated. Solar disc reflector is an oval shaped disc of 12 foot by 18 foot in which 6 inch to 12 inch long and 2 inch to 3 inch wide big mirror or steel plate which can convert sun rays are installed. The mirror or steel plate is fitted on an angle in the solar disc reflector that can focus and direct the sun rays on zero point on the middle axis of the solar disc reflector a spring is attached by which in the morning by rotating towards the sun in the disc the key is wound up, the wound up key in the spring rotates the disc immediately from west to east but pendulum lever ball bearing box is installed below in the solar disc reflector through which obstruction is produced in the pressure of rotation of the spring. This obstruction rotates the solar disc reflector or solar box of lenses along with the sun from east to west at a certain point. Next day again the solar disc or box made of solar lenses is directed towards east direction by which the spring key is wound up. in the same way this process goes on every day from morning to evening.<br>
2.	- In the piston (which is described in the claim one) of the steam engine of the solar disc reflector and in the connecting rod at least three-three groups are made which protects the pressure form getting outside and maintains the pressure.<br>
3.	- To store electricity in batteries after conversion from A.C. to B.C. received through solar disc reflector or lenses (to use during the night or in the absence of sunlight) or after converting D.C. of batteries to A.C. to run A.C. equipments one way diode of appropriate power are installed to complete circuit is made into use.<br><br></td>
