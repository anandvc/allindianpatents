CROSS-REFFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/892,683 filed on March 2, 2007. The disclosure of the above application is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates generally to a park servo for an<br>
automatic transmission and more particularly to a park servo for an automatic<br>
transmission having a pressure assisted return to park piston.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]	In previous automatic transmissions having an electronic transmission<br>
range shift (ETRS) feature, electro-hydraulic solenoid/valves (solenoids) have been used<br>
to provide pressurized hydraulic fluid to a hydraulic servo that rotates the manual shaft to<br>
release and place the vehicle transmission in park. Particularly in cold environments, the<br>
time necessary for the hydraulic servo to return the transmission to park after such a shift<br>
command, though not long, may be viewed as less than optimal. Accordingly, it has been<br>
determined that improvements in return to park actuators for automatic transmissions are<br>
desirable.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0004]	A pressure assisted park servo assembly for an automatic<br>
transmission typically having an electronic transmission range shift (ETRS) configuration<br>
includes a multiple port servo or spool valve which receives pressurized hydraulic fluid<br>
from various sources including two solenoids and transmission ports. The spool valve<br>
controls two flows of pressurized hydraulic fluid to a park servo to quickly place the<br>
transmission in or release it from park. The park servo includes a compression spring<br>
which also urges the park servo toward its park position. The fluid sources within the<br>
transmission maintain or latch the spool valve and park servo on the out of park position.<br>
[0005]	Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide a pressure<br>
assisted park servo for an automatic transmission having electronic transmission range<br>
shift.<br>
[0006]	It is a further object of the present invention to provide a pressure<br>
assisted park servo assembly for an automatic transmission having a servo or spool valve<br>
which receives pressurized hydraulic fluid from solenoids and the transmission.<br>
[0007]	It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a servo<br>
valve and pressure assisted park servo that provides enhanced operating speed.<br>
[0008]	It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a pressure<br>
assisted park servo having a compression spring which urges the servo piston toward the<br>
park position.<br>
[0009]	Further objects and advantages of the present invention will become<br>
apparent by reference to the following description and appended drawings wherein like<br><br>
reference numbers refer to the same component, element or feature.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0019]	Referring now to FIG. 1, an automatic transmission is illustrated and<br>
generally designated by the reference number 10. Typically, the automatic transmission<br>
10 will include an electronic transmission range shift (ETRS) feature. The automatic<br>
transmission 10 includes a housing 11 which is preferably a metal casting and includes<br>
numerous openings, shoulders, flanges and other features (not illustrated) which receive,<br>
locate and support various components of the automatic transmission 10. Extending<br>
through one such opening in the housing 11 is a manual shaft 12 which is coupled to and<br>
translates park components between Park and Out of Park ranges within the automatic<br>
transmission 10. The manual shaft 12 is coupled though a suitable linkage 14 to the bi-<br>
directionally translating output shaft or piston rod 16 of a pressure assisted park servo 20<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
[0020]	Also associated and in fluid communication with the pressure assisted<br>
park servo 20 is a return to park solenoid 22, an out of park solenoid 24 which are both<br>
connected to a source of pressurized hydraulic fluid (not illustrated) and a hydraulic,<br>
multiple port ETRS, servo or spool valve 30.<br>
[0021]	Referring now to FIG. 2, it will be appreciated that the servo or spool<br>
valve 30 includes a housing 32 which defines a cylindrical bore 34 of diverse diameters<br>
and a plurality of preferably radial passageways or ports which communicate with the<br>
cylindrical bore 34. A first control port 40 is disposed at one end of the bore 34 and<br><br>
communicates with the outlet or control side of the out of park solenoid 24. A second<br>
control port 42 is disposed adjacent the first port 40 and communicates between the bore<br>
34 and the outlet or control side of a drive and braking solenoid 44. A first exhaust port 46<br>
is adjacent the second control port 42 and communicates between the bore 34 and a<br>
hydraulic sump or reservoir (not illustrated). A third control port 48 communicates through<br>
a first hydraulic line 52 to a first chamber 54 in the pressure assisted park servo 20.<br>
Pressurized hydraulic fluid in the first chamber 54 provides force against one face 55 of a<br>
piston 56 and extends the shaft or piston rod 16. Such extension is assisted by a first<br>
compression spring 58 disposed in the first chamber 54 about the piston rod 16. A fluid<br>
port 57 communicates with the first chamber 54 and a valve 59. The valve 59 is illustrated<br>
as a ball/check valve, however, other kinds of valves may be employed without departing<br>
from the scope of the present invention. The valve 59 allows air or fluid to enter the first<br>
chamber 54 in order to prevent a vacuum from forming in the first chamber 54 when the<br>
piston 56 is returning to the Park position and when there is no pressurized fluid provided<br>
by a pressurized hydraulic fluid source, such as when the engine of the motor vehicle is<br>
off. Accordingly, the valve 59 increases the rate of return to the Park position.<br>
[0022]	The housing 32 of the servo or spool valve 30 also defines a first inlet<br>
port 62 which communicates between a source of pressurized hydraulic fluid (not<br>
illustrated) and the cylindrical bore 34 adjacent the third control port 48. A fourth control<br>
port 64 communicates through a second hydraulic line 66 with a second chamber 68 in<br>
the pressure assisted park servo 20. Pressurized hydraulic fluid in the second chamber<br>
68 provides force against an opposite face 69 of the piston 56 and retracts the shaft or<br>
piston rod 16. A second exhaust port 72 adjacent the fourth control port 64 communicates<br><br>
between the bore 34 and the hydraulic sump or reservoir. A fifth control port 74<br>
communicates with the bore 34 and receives pressurized hydraulic fluid from components<br>
within the transmission indicating that the transmission is in a forward gear. Finally, a<br>
sixth control port 76 is disposed at the second end of the bore 34 and communicates with<br>
the outlet or control side of the return to park solenoid 22.<br>
[0023]	Axially, slidably disposed within the cylindrical bore 34 of the housing<br>
32 of the servo or spool valve 30 is a valve spool 80 having various diameters and<br>
shoulders which cooperate with the cylindrical bore 34 and the ports 40, 42, 46, 48, 62,<br>
64, 72, 74 and 76 to control the direction and flow of hydraulic fluid to the pressure<br>
assisted park servo 20.<br>
[0024]	The valve spool 80, from left to right, includes a first shoulder 82<br>
operatively associated with the first inlet port 40, a second shoulder 84 operatively<br>
associated with the second inlet port 42, a first control disc 86 operatively associated with<br>
the first exhaust port 46 and the third control port 48, a second control disc 88 operatively<br>
associated with the fourth control port 64 and the second exhaust port 72, a third shoulder<br>
92 operatively associated with the fifth control port 74 and a fourth shoulder 94 operatively<br>
associated with the sixth control port 76.<br>
[0025]	As illustrated, a first stub potion 96 of the valve spool 80 extends<br>
beyond the first shoulder 82 and a second stub portion 98 of the valve spool 80 extends<br>
beyond the fourth shoulder 94 to limit translation of the valve spool 80 in left and right<br>
directions, respectively. In a portion of the bore 34 communicating with the port 76 and<br>
concentrically located about a portion of the valve spool 80 and contacting the fourth<br>
shoulder 94 is disposed a second compression spring 102.<br><br>
[0026]	Operation of the pressure assisted park servo 20 will now be<br>
described with serial reference to the drawings, beginning with FIG. 2. In FIG. 2, the<br>
automatic transmission 10 is in park and the spool 80 of the ETRS or spool valve 30 is at<br>
its left limit of travel (as viewed in the drawings). In this condition, pressurized hydraulic<br>
fluid, provided to the first inlet port 62, is present at the third control port 48 and<br>
pressurizes the first hydraulic line 52 and the first chamber 54 of the pressure assisted<br>
park servo 20, driving or maintaining the piston 56 and shaft or piston rod 16 of the<br>
pressure assisted park servo 20 to or in its park position, to the right as illustrated in FIG.<br>
2.<br>
[0027]	In FIGS. 3 and 4, the vehicle operator has requested a transmission<br>
operating range other than park and the out of park solenoid 24 is activated, providing<br>
hydraulic fluid to the first control port 40, applying pressure to the first shoulder 82 and<br>
causing translation of the valve spool 80 to the right. This action causes translation of the<br>
first control disc 86 which connects the first chamber 54 and the first hydraulic line 52<br>
through the third control port 48 to the first exhaust port 46 which allows release of<br>
hydraulic fluid from the first chamber 54. Additionally, the second control disc 88<br>
translates to the right and pressurized hydraulic fluid, present at the first inlet port 62, is<br>
provided to the fourth control port 64, the second hydraulic line 66 and the second<br>
chamber 68 to retract the shaft or piston rod 16 and move the manual shaft 12 and<br>
automatic transmission 10 out of park.<br>
[0028]	In FIG. 5, the drive and braking solenoid 44 is energized to supply<br>
pressurized hydraulic fluid to the second control port 42 and against the second shoulder<br>
84. This provides an additional force to the valve spool 80 to maintain it in its rightmost<br><br>
(out of park) position and provides a back up or redundant feature to the out of park<br>
solenoid 24 to ensure that the transmission remains out of park.<br>
[0029]	In FIG. 6, the automatic transmission 10 is in a forward gear and<br>
pressurized hydraulic fluid from the transmission 10 is supplied to the fifth control port 74<br>
and against the third shoulder 92 which also provides a force to the valve spool 80 to<br>
maintain it in its rightmost position. Given the redundancy, the out of park solenoid 24<br>
may be turned off. While the drive and braking solenoid 44 may remain on, however, the<br>
transmission fluid provided to the fifth control port 74 provides a hydraulic latch which<br>
keeps the automatic transmission 10 out of park if the drive and braking solenoid 44 fails<br>
or the TEHCM controller stops working.<br>
[0030]	In FIG. 7, the vehicle operator requests park. Both the out of park<br>
solenoid 24 and the drive and braking solenoid 44 are de-energized and the return to park<br>
solenoid 22 is energized. Pressurized hydraulic fluid is then supplied to the sixth control<br>
port 76 and the fourth shoulder 94 of the valve spool 80 adjacent the second compression<br>
spring 102. The combination of hydraulic pressure and spring force moves the valve<br>
spool 80 back to the left, to the park position, faster than the compression spring 102<br>
alone would be able to move the valve spool 80.<br>
[0031]	In FIG. 8, the valve spool 80 has translated to the left, to its park<br>
position, translating the second control disc 88 to the left and connecting the fourth control<br>
port 64, the second hydraulic line 66 and the second chamber 68 to the second exhaust<br>
port 72 to allow the hydraulic fluid in the second chamber 68 to be released. At the same<br>
time, the first control disc 86 translates to the left, the first inlet port 62 is placed in fluid<br><br>
communication with the third control port 48 and the first hydraulic line 52 and pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid begins to fill the first chamber 54 of the pressure assisted park servo 20.<br>
[0032]	In FIG. 9, the piston 56 and the shaft or piston rod 16 of the pressure<br>
assisted park servo 20 have fully returned to the right, to the park position. By utilizing<br>
pressurized hydraulic fluid from the first inlet port 62, the motion of the piston 56 and the<br>
piston rod 16 of the pressure assisted park servo 20 is much faster than that achieved by<br>
utilizing the first compression spring 58 alone and the park position of the automatic<br>
transmission 10 is quickly achieved.<br><br>
