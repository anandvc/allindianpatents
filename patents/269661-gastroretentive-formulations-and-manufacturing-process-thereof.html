GASTRORETENTIVE FORMULATIONS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS<br>
THEREOF<br>
The invention relates to gastroretentive formulations,<br>
in particular tablets, and to the process for manufacturing<br>
said formulations.<br>
An important factor affecting the absorption of orally<br>
administered drug through gastro-intestinal tract is transit<br>
time in gastrointestinal tract.<br>
Some active substances, for example metformin and<br>
ciprofloxacin, are known as being absorbed only from the<br>
stomach to the jejunum, i.e in the upper part of the<br>
gastrointestinal tract.<br>
Hence, to achieve maximum efficiency with a minimum of<br>
active substance, it would be beneficial that the formulation<br>
be retained during a prolonged time in the stomach and allows<br>
therein a sustained release of the active substance.<br>
Some attempts have already been done to achieve<br>
formulations with such a sustained release in the stomach,<br>
either thanks to the use of multilayer tablets such as in US<br>
6,797,283 (Edgren et al.), US patent application 20030232081,<br>
or thanks to tablets which are sufficiently small to be<br>
ingested and which swell after ingestion such as in<br>
US6,635,280 (Shell et al.) and US 6,660,300 (Timmins et al.),<br>
and which further include disintegrating agent and<br>
effervescent agent, such as in US 6,261,601 (Talwar et al.).<br>
However, these formulations are not completely<br>
satisfactory and it still exists a need for formulations<br>
which are able to be retained in the higher part of the<br>
gastrointestinal tract and to release the active substance<br>
during several hours in the stomach.<br>
Unexpectedly and surprisingly, the inventors have<br>
found that those objectives are fulfilled with a<br>
WO 2007/010400 PCT/IB2006/002636<br>
2<br>
gastroretentive formulation comprising an active substance<br>
granulated with a mixture of a weak gelling agent, a<br>
strong gelling agent, and a gas generating agent.<br>
In the present invention, a "weak gelling agent" is a<br>
compound presenting a viscosity of less than 175 centipoise<br>
when it is in a form of a 2.6 % W/V aqueous dispersion at<br>
25°C.<br>
A "strong gelling agent" is a compound presenting a<br>
viscosity of at least 600 centipoise when it is in the<br>
form of a 1 % W/V aqueous solution at 25° C.<br>
Without being linked by any theory, it is thought<br>
that the weak gelling agent helps the matrix to swell<br>
faster due to its fast wetting property and the<br>
effervescent agent, which liberate gas on reaction with<br>
the gastric medium, helps to keep the tablet floating in<br>
the stomach. Use of a strong gelling agent provides<br>
rigidity to the swollen tablet matrix and helps to entrap<br>
the liberated gas in the tablet matrix.<br>
In other words, as the acidic environment of the<br>
stomach enters in the core of the gelled matrix, it reacts<br>
with the gas liberating agent to liberate gas. The<br>
liberated gas gets entrapped in the gel matrix and<br>
releases slowly on the surface of the gelled matrix as the<br>
drug is diffused or delivered from the gelled matrix. The<br>
released gas gets adsorbed on the surface of the gelled<br>
matrix forming a bubbled layer on the surface and helps to<br>
control the dissolution or erosion of the gelled matrix in<br>
turn helping to control the release of the drug from the<br>
matrix. The composition remains in the stomach for long<br>
time releasing almost entire drug in the stomach for<br>
absorption.<br>
According to the present invention, the<br>
gastroretentive formulation is a monolithic pharmaceutical<br>
WO 2007/010400 PCT/IB2006/002636<br>
3<br>
composition with sustained release effect, which is<br>
retained in the stomach from where the drug has maximum<br>
absorption for better therapeutic effect thereby acting as<br>
site specific drug delivery system.<br>
The formulation is suitable for both highly soluble<br>
and/or partially soluble or poorly soluble drugs.<br>
Due to this specific delivery system, the formulation<br>
according to the invention, is particularly useful for<br>
antibacterial substances of the fluoroquinolone class such as<br>
ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, grepafloxacin,<br>
enoxacin, amifioxacin, fleroxacin, temafloxacin,<br>
lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, sparfloxacin, levofloxacin,<br>
gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin, amoxicillin and Cephalexin<br>
derivatives in the form of base or salt thereof and' also for<br>
antidiabetic substances such as metformin hydrochloride,<br>
Gliclazide, antihyertensive drugs such as diltiazem<br>
hydrochloride, metoprolol tartarate or succinate.<br>
The amount of active substance ranges from 10 to 90%,<br>
preferably from 20 to 80 % and even more preferably from 50<br>
to 75 % by weight of the total weight of the formulation.<br>
The weak gelling agent is selected from the group<br>
comprising a co-processed material of microcrystalline<br>
cellulose and sodium carboxy methylcellulose, preferably the<br>
one sold under the trademark AVICEL® CL611, AVICEL® RC 581<br>
and AVICEL® RC 591.<br>

consisting of methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl<br>
cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose with the. exclusion of low-<br>
substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose,<br>

guar gum, carrageenan gum, locust bean gum, sodium alginate,<br>
agar-agar, gelatin, modified starches, co-polymers of<br>
WO 2007/010400 PCT/IB2006/002636<br>
4<br>
carboxyvinyl polymers, co-polymer of acrylates, co-polymers<br>
of oxyethylene and oxypropylene and mixtures thereof.<br>
The total amount of both weak and strong gelling agents<br>
ranges from 2 to 40% , preferably from 3 to 30 % and even<br>
more preferably from 5 to 25 % by weight of the total weight<br>
of the formulation.<br>
The ratio of the weak gelling agent to the strong<br>
gelling agent ranges between 1:1 to 1:10, preferably from 1:2<br>
to 1:8 and even more preferably between 1:3 to 1:5.<br>
The ratio of the substance active to both weak and<br>
strong gelling agents ranges from 1:99 to 99:1, preferably<br>
from 1:1 to 20 :1, and even more preferably from 2:1 to 15 :1<br>
The gas generating agent is a compound which generates<br>
gas when it is in contact with an acidic medium, such as<br>
gastric fluid. Said gas generating agent is selected from the<br>
group consisting in water soluble carbonates, sulfites and<br>
bicarbonates, such as sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate,<br>
sodium metabisulfite, calcium carbonate, and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
The amount of gas generating agent ranges from 5 to 30%,<br>
preferably from 10 to 25 % and even more preferably from 12<br>
to 22% by weight of the total weight of the formulation.<br>
The gas generating agent may be present in the<br>
formulation according to the invention inside the granules of<br>
active substance or as an excipient of the formulation or<br>
both.<br>
Thus, according to a first embodiment, at least a part<br>
of the gas generating agent is present in the granules of the<br>
active substance, i.e. at least a part of the gas generating<br>
agent is granulated together with the active substance and<br>

with the other granulating agents; the remaining part of the<br>
WO 2007/010400 PCT/IB2006/002636<br>
5<br>
gas generating agent being present with excipients of the<br>
formulation, i.e. not granulated with the active substance.<br>
According to a second embodiment, the whole amount of<br>
the gas generating agent is present with the excipients of<br>
the formulation, i.e. is not granulated with the active<br>
substance and the mixture of weak and strong gelling agents,<br>
optionally with the other granulating agents.<br>

6<br>
The amount of binder (C) ranges from 0 to 10 %,<br>
preferably from 0.5 to 5%, and even more preferably from 1<br>
