				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The disclosures herein relate generally to infusion devices and method, and more particularly to a subcutaneous infusion device specifically adapted for receiving therapeutic substances injected with a syringe.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Presently, the delivery options available to insulin dependent diabetics for insulin delivery include direct injections with a syringe, continuous-dcli\ery with an insulin pump and injections with a jet-spray. Each one of these insulin delivery options has advantages, disadvantages and limitations with respect to factors such as comenience. cost, effort, safety, reliability and pain. Accordingly, selection of an acceptable delivery option by a diabetic will depend on the advantages of a selected insulin delivery option as well as the diabetic's ability and willingness to tolerate the limitations and disadvantages of the selected insulin delivery option.<br>
One of the most reliable methods of insulin delivery that a diabetic can choose is direct inicction with a syringe (i.e.. an injection needle pierces the skin). Direct injection with a syringe offers precise measurement of insulin and the security of manual delivery. However, direct injection with a svrinue sometimes necessitates multiple injections during the course of a day. For example, a Type-1 diabetic generally needs a dosage of insulin either immediately before or.after a meal.<br>
For many diabetics, their aversion to needles precludes them from ever being able to bring themselves to direct injection with a syringe. For other diabetics, multiple direct injections per day and bruises at the injection site become too much to tolerate. Regardless of the particular reason or reasons, there arc a large number of diabetics who cannot bring themselves to inject their insulin directly with a needle or who lose their ability to tolerate direct injections with a syringe. These diabetics often under-medicate themselves, endangering their physical health and mental well being.<br>
Many diabetics who choose not to subject themselves to multiple direct injections with a syringe, because they have a fear of needles and/or because they bruise easily, look to other options besides direct injections with a syringe. For those who simply have a fear of needles, but are able to tolerate the pain and bruises associated with injection needles, jet spray injection is an option. Jet spray injection delivers a fine stream of insulin through the skin under extreme high pressure. Although a needle is not used, jet spray injection exhibits a similar level of pain and bruising associated with its use as do direct injections with a syringe.<br>
The insulin pump has become the most popular option for diabetics who cannot face multiple daily direct injections with a syringe. With the insulin pump, a diabetic receives a continuous dosage of insulin from a pump apparatus via an infusion device mounted on their body. Insulin is supplied (e.g.. pumped) from the insulin pump through a tube to the infusion device. Infusion devices generally include a cannula mounting in a subcutaneous manner within the flesh of the diabetic. The infusion device includes a channel that transmits insulin from an inlet port to the cannula for being delivered to the subcutaneous tissue layer of the diabetic.<br>
Mounting of the infusion device generally involves the use of an insertion needle. Most conventional infusion devices have an insertion needle that extends through a body of the device and through the cannula. During mounting of such a conventional infusion device, the insertion needle serves to pierce the skin and to support the cannula, as most cannulas are made from a soft and/or flexible material. Accordingly, the diabetic still must deal with a needle piecing their skin. However, because the infusion device may remain in place for an extended period of time (e.g., typically up to 3 days or more), the diabetic need only deal with one injection type needle over 3 or more days, rather than multiple times per day. This extended period of time between needle insertions is what makes the pump tolerable for many diabetics who have an aversion to being pierced with injection needles.<br>
The advantages of the insulin pump do not come without a number of significant disadvantages. One disadvantage is that the precise measurement of insulin and the security of manual delivery associated with direct injections with a syringe are largely turned over to the insulin pump.   Situations such as the pump malfunctioning, degradation of the insulin within the pump<br>
reservoir (e.g., due to heat), bubbles in the reservoir/supply tube of the pump (e.g., due to agitation) and inherent limitations of an electro-mechanical device often result in the pump delivering an incorrect dosage of insulin. As the pump is a continuous delivery device, the diabetic may not know that they are receiving an incorrect dosage of insulin until a lengthy period of time has passed, resulting in dangerous blood-sugar levels. Another disadvantage is that the insulin pump, which is about the size of a typical pager, must be worn essentially 24 hours per day. Finding an inconspicuous yet convenient place to wear the pump can be difficult. Still another disadvantage is the cost of the insulin pump - about S8000 for the pump, plus disposable supplies. Though insurance plans generally cover insulin pumps, the considerable price of the pump adversely affects insurance premiums. Furthermore, under certain insurance policies, the insured party may still have the responsibility of paying for at least a portion of the pump.<br>
The present invention therefore provides an infusion device for receiving an injection from a syringe, comprising:<br>
a body including an accessible surface having a single inlet port therein, an engagement surface having a single outlet port therein and a medication delivery channel extending between the single inlet port and the single outlet port;<br>
a cannula coupled to the body at the single outlet port, wherein the cannula receives medication from the single outlet port and transmitting the medication therethrough; and<br>
a first self-sealing member attached to the body and forming a first septum for the medication delivery channel.<br>
Therefore, a device and method for enabling a frequently administered medication to be injected with a syringe in a manner that overcomes limitations associated with conventional medication delivery devices and methods.<br>

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The disclosures made herein relate to various aspects of an infusion device specifically adapted for receiving an injection from a syringe. As discussed in greater detail below, such an infusion device is beneficial to any patient (e.g.. human patients or animal patients) that requires receiving medication via some type of direct injection on a daily basis. Insulin-dependent diabetics are an example of a patient that requires receiving medication via some type of trans-dermal medication delivery on a daily basis. In fact, a typical insulin-dependent diabetic require multiple trans-dermal injections of insulin daily.<br>
0-<br>
An infusion device in accordance with embodiments of the disclosures made herein is mountable on a patient with the cannula extending into or through subcutaneous tissue of a patient. Once the infusion device is mounted on the patient, the patient may use a syringe and injection needle for receiving an injection of one or more medications via the infusion device. The patient is spared having their skin pierced by the injection needle. After an initial skin piercing by an insertion needle of the infusion device, all injections are facilitated via the injection needle being engaged with the infusion device rather than through the skin of the patient. The patient would only be subjected to piecing of the skin by a needle when replacing an existing mounted infusion device with a new infusion device. Depending on factors associated with the patient, the medication, the specific construction of the infusion device, it is contemplated herein that the infusion deuce would only need to be replaced every three days or more.<br>
An infusion device in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosures made herein permits patients who might not otherwise choose direct injection with a syringe due to as their primary mode of medication delivery for any number of reasons (e.g.. an aversion to needles, an intolerance to bruises at an injection site, etc) to now do so. Through the use of such an infusion device, a patient may enjoy the precise measurement of a medication and/or the security of manual delivery afforded by direct injection with a syringe. It should be noted that direct injection is one of the most reliable methods of self-delivery that a patient can choose. This reliability is due at least in part to this precise measurement of the medication and the security of manual delivery. In essence, a patient has direct control over when, where and how much medication they are receiving. Accordingly, infusion devices in accordance with embodiments of the disclosures made herein aid in enabling patients to properly medicate themselves, thus maintaining their health and mental well being.<br>
Another advantage of an infusion device in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosures made herein is the ability to easily conceal the infusion device, without hindering access to it. The size and profile of the infusion device pennits it to be worn inconspicuously under clothing at various portions of the patient's body. While not directly related to a patient's physiological health, being able to readily conceal the infusion device under nearly any garment goes a long way to enhancing the mental well-being of human patients.<br>
Still another advantage of an infusion device in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosures made herein is its cost. Its cost is a fraction of other delivery devices intended to reduce anxiety and/or discomfort associated with direct injections with a syringe. Its relatively low cost will be of benefit to patients, doctors and insurance companies.<br>
Turning now to the drawing figures. FIGS. 1 and 2 depicts a infusion device 10 in accordance with a first embodiment of the disclosures made herein. The infusion device 10 includes a body 12. a cannula 14, a self-scaling member 16 and an adhesive laminate member 17. The body 12 includes an accessible surface 18 having a single inlet port 20 therein, an engagement surface 22 having a single outlet port 24 therein and a medication delivery channel 26 extending between the single inlet port 20 and the single outlet port 24. The infusion device 10 represents an embodiment of a single cannula infusion device in accordance with the disclosures made herein.<br>
The cannula 14 is coupled to the body 12 at the single outlet port 24. The cannula 14 is adapted for receiving medication from the single outlet port 24 and transmitting the medication through a channel 28 of the cannula. The cannula 14 and the medication delivery channel 26 have an essentially straight, common longitudinal axis. The essentially straight, common longitudinal axis extends generally perpendicular to the engagement surface 22 of the body 12. Although the engagement surface 22 is depicted as being essentially planar, it is contemplated and disclosed herein that the engagement surface may have a profile other than essentially planar. Furthennore. it is contemplated herein that in other embodiments of infusion devices as disclosed herein, the medication delivery channel 26 and the associated cannula 14 do not have an essentially straight, common longitudinal axis.<br>
The self-sealing member 16 is mounted at least partially within the medication delivery channel 26 with an exposed surface of the self-sealing member 16 being essentially contiguous with the accessible surface 18 of the body 12. The self-sealing member 16 forms a septum extending across the medication delivery channel 26. The septum limits contaminants entering the medication delivery channel 26 and limits the back-flow of medication from the medication delivery channel 26 through the single inlet port 20.<br>
The adhesive laminate member 17 is mounted on the engagement surface 22 of the body 12. The adhesive laminate member 1 7 includes an adhesive layer disposed between a substrate layer and a release liner layer. The substrate layer provides structural integrity for the adhesive layer and is attached to the body 12. The release liner is removable from the adhesive layer for engaging the adhesive layer to be bonded to a skin surface of the patient during mounting of the infusion device 10. thereby securing the infusion device 10 to a patient's body. It is contemplated that the substrate layer may be omitted or integral with the body 12 in other embodiments (not shown) of the disclosures made herein.<br>
The medication delivery channel 26 includes a tapered portion 30 adiacent to the accessible surface 18 of the body 12. The tapered portion 30 of the medication delivery channel 26 forms a funnel-shaped entry into the medication delivery channel 26. Fhe tapered portion 30 is intended to aid a patient in engaging an injection needle 32 of a syringe 34 in a relatively quick and convenient<br><br>
manner by providing an insertion area for the needle 32 that is suitably larger than a cross sectional area of the injection needle 32.<br>
The tapered portion 30 of the medication delivery channel 26 is tapered in a manner such that the single inlet port 20 has a minor diametrical dimension at least about two times greater than a minor diametrical dimension of the medication delivery channel 26. A nominal diametrical dimension of an essentially non-tapered portion of the medication delivery channel (e.g., adjacent to the single outlet port 24) is an example of the minor diametrical dimension of the medication delivery channel 26. Examples of port and channel cross-sectional profiles include round, rectangular, triangular, elliptical and other known profiles. In one embodiment of the single inlet port 20 and the medication delivery channel 26. the single inlet port 20 and the medication deliveiy channel 26 each have a circular cross-sectional profile and the single inlet port 26 is essentially circular. In such an embodiment, the opening (i.e.. a circular shaped opening) has a diameter at least about two times greater than a minor diameter of the medication deliveiy channel.<br>
The body 12 further includes an identification feature 36 on the accessible surface 18 encompassing the single inlet port 20. The identification feature 36 is intended to aid in identifying the single inlet port 20. The identification feature 36 is raised with respect to the accessible surface IS of the body 12.<br>
It is contemplated herein that identification features in accordance with embodiments of the disclosures made herein may be at least partially raised with respect to an accessible surface of a respective body, may be at least partially recessed with respect to an accessible surface of a respective body or a combination of both raised and recessed with respect to an accessible surface of a respective body. It is also contemplated herein that identification features in accordance with embodiments of the disclosures made herein may be a different color than a respective body and/or self-sealing material. It is yet further contemplated herein that identification features in accordance with embodiments of the disclosures made herein may be any one of a plurality of shapes (e.g.. round, rectangular, triangular, elliptical, etc.). It is still further contemplated herein that identification features in accordance with embodiments of the disclosures made herein may be a<br>
symbol (e.g., a Braille symbol) or a shape positioned adjacent to a respective inlet port, but not encompassing that port.<br>
FIG. 3 depicts an infusion device 100 in accordance with a second embodiment of the disclosures made herein. The infusion device 100 is similar in structure to the infusion device 10 depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2. Structural elements and features of the infusion device 100 and the infusion device 10 (depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2) are similarly denoted. For example, the body of the infusion device 100 is denoted as 112, whereas the body of the infusion device 10 is denoted as 12. Such similar elements and features are denoted for clarity in FIG. 3. but may not be discussed in specific detail in reference to FIG. 3.<br>
The infusion device 100 includes a body 112, a self-scaling member 116 mounted on an accessible surface 118 of the body 1 12 and a single outlet port 124 that is offset from an engagement surface 122 of the body 112. The self-sealing member 1 lo forms a septum extending across the medication delivery channel 126. The septum limits contaminants entering the medication delivery channel 126 and limits the back-flow of medication from the medication delivery channel 126 through the single inlet port 120. Although the self-sealing member 116 is depicted as covering only a portion of the accessible surface 11 8 of the body 1 12, it is contemplated and disclosed herein that the self-sealing member 116 may cover essentially the entire accessible surface 118 of the body 112.<br>
The self-sealing member 116 includes an integral identification feature 136. The identification feature 136 encompasses the single inlet port 120 of the medication delivery channel 126. The identification feature 136 is intended to aid in identifying the medication delivery channel 126. The identification feature 136 is raised with respect to an exposed surface of the self-sealing member 1 16. It is contemplated herein that identification features in accordance with embodiments of the disclosures made herein may be at least partially raised with respect to the exposed surface of a respective self-sealing member, may be at least partial!) recessed with respect to an exposed surface of a respective self-sealing member or a combination of both raised and recessed with respect to an exposed surface of a respective self-scaling member.<br>
FIG. 4 depicts an infusion device 200 in accordance with a third embodiment of the disclosures made herein. The infusion device 200 is similar in structure to the infusion device 10<br>
depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2. Structural elements and features of the infusion device 200 and the infusion device 10 (depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2) are similarly denoted. For example, the body of the infusion device 200 is denoted as 212, whereas the body of the infusion device 10 is denoted as 12. Such similar elements and features are denoted in FIG. 4. but may not be discussed in specific detail in reference to FIG. 4.<br>
The infusion device 200 includes a body 212 and a self-sealing member 216. The self-sealing member 216 is mounted on the body 212 adjacent to an engagement surface 222 of the body 212 and at least partially within the medication delivery channel 226. The self-sealing member 216 forms a septum extending across the medication delivery channel 226 adjacent to a single outlet port 224 of the body 212. The septum limits contaminants entering the channel 228 of the cannula 214 and limits the back-flow of medication from the cannula through the single outlet port 224.<br>
FIG. 5 depicts an infusion device 300 ,in accordance with a fourth embodiment of the disclosures made herein. The infusion device 300 is similar in structure to the infusion device 10 depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2. Structural elements and features of the infusion device 300 and the infusion device 10 (depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2) are similarly denoted. For example, the body of the infusion device 300 is denoted as 312. whereas the body of the infusion device 10 is denoted as 1 ?.. Such similar elements and features are denoted in FIG. 5, but may not be discussed in specific detail in reference to FIG. 5.<br>
The infusion device 300 includes a body 312. a first self-sealing member 316 mounted on the body 312 adjacent to an accessible surface 318 of the body 3 12 and a second self-sealing member 3 1l) mounted on the body 3 12 adjacent to an engagement surface 322 of the body 312. The first self-sealing member 316 forms a septum extending across the medication delivery channel 326 adjacent to a single inlet port 320 of the body 3 I 2 (i.e., the first septum). The second self-sealing member 3 1 ^ forms a septum extending across the medication delivery channel 326 adjacent to a single outlet port 324 of the body 3 12 (i.e.. the second septum). The first septum limits contaminants entering the medication delivery channel 326 and limits the back-tlow o\' medication from the medication delivery channel 326 through the single inlet port 320. The second septum limits the back-flow of medication from the medication delhcry channel 326 through the single inlet port 320.   An<br>
advantage of the second septum is that the volume of the medication delivery channel is taken out of the dosage amount (i.e., medication does not sit stagnant in the medication delivery channel) when the injection needle is properly inserted through both the first and the second septum prior to delivering the medication.<br>
FIG. 6 depicts an infusion device 400 in accordance with a fifth embodiment of the disclosures made herein. The infusion device 400 is similar in structure to the infusion device 10 depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2. Structural elements and features of the infusion device 400 and the infusion device 10 (depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2) are similarly denoted. For example, the body of the infusion device 400 is denoted as 412. whereas the body of the infusion device 10 is denoted as 12. Such similar elements and features are denoted in FIG. 6, but may not be discussed in specific detail in reference to FIG. 6.<br>
The infusion device 400 includes a body 412 having an accessible surface 418 with a single inlet port 420 therein, an engagement surface 422 having a single outlet port 424 therein and a medication delivery channel 426 extending between the single inlet port 420 and the single outlet port 424. A needle stop 438 is positioned adjacent to the single outlet port 424 of the medication delivery channel 426. The needle stop may be a discrete component attached to the body 412 or may be integrally formed with the body 412. The needle stop 438 limits the depth to which an injection needle can be inserted into the medication delivery channel 430.<br>
One advantage of limiting the insertion depth of an insertion needle is that the needle Is prevented from damaging (e.g.. piercing) the cannula 414. Even when a needle that is too long relative to an intended use needle is used with the infusion device 400, the needle stop 43S precludes the needle from piercing through the cannula 4] 4 or piercing into the patient's flesh adjacent to the cannula 414. Another advantage oi~ limiting the insertion depth of an insertion needle is that the overall height of the body 41 2 can be reduced. Because the insertion depth of an injection needle is physically limited by the needle stop 438. the overall length of the medication delivery channel 426 (i.e., the distance between the single inlet port 420 and the single outlet port 424) no longer serves to limit over insertion of an injection needle. Accordingly, the overall height of the body 412 can be<br>
reduced with respect to a body without a needle stop, without concern for over insertion of an injection needle.<br>
FIG. 7 depicts an infusion device 500 in accordance with a sixth embodiment of the disclosures made herein. The infusion device 500 includes a body 512, a plurality of cannulas 514, a plurality of self-sealing members 516 and an adhesive laminate member 517. The body 512 includes an accessible surface 518 having a plurality of single inlet ports 520 therein, an engagement surface 522 having a plurality of single outlet ports 524 therein and a discrete medication delivery channel 526 extending between a respective one of the single inlet ports 520 and a respective one of the single outlet ports 524. Each discrete medication channel 526 is associated with only one of the single inlet ports 520 and only one of the single outlet ports 524.<br>
Each discrete medication delivery channel 526 is spaced apart from an adjacent discrete medication delivery channel 526 by a prescribed distance. Factors such as the type(s) of medication and the frequency of injections delivered via the infusion device 500 influence the prescribed distance. The term discrete in reference to medication delivery channel refers to each medication delivery channel being separate from each other medication delivery channel. The infusion device 500 represents an embodiment of a multi-cannula infusion device in accordance with the disclosures made herein.<br>
Each one of the cannulas 514 is coupled to the body 512 at a respective one of the single outlet ports 524. Each one of the cannulas 514 is adapted for receiving medication from the respective one of the single outlet ports for transmitting the medication through a channel 528 of the corresponding one of the cannulas 514. A first one of the cannulas 514 is a different length than a second one of the cannulas. It is contemplated that in other embodiments of multi-cannula infusion devices in accordance with the disclosures made herein, all of the cannulas are essentially the same length.<br>
Each medication delivery channel 526 and the associated one of said cannulas 514 have a common, essentially straight longitudinal axis. The common, essentially straight longitudinal axis extends generally perpendicular to the engagement surface 522 of the body 512.
