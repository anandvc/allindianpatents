				<td>A REPLACABLE INK CONTAINER FOR PROVIDING INK TO AN INKJET<br>
PRINTING SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to ink containers for providing ink to inkjet printers.<br>
[0002] Inkjet printers frequently make use of an inkjet printhead mounted on a carriage<br>
that is moved back and forth across print media, such as paper. As the printhead is moved<br>
across the print media, a control system activates the printhead to deposit or eject ink<br>
droplets onto the print media to form images and text. Ink is provided to the printhead by<br>
a supply of ink that is either carried by the carriage or mounted to the printing system not<br>
to move with the carriage.<br>
[0003] For the case where the ink supply is not carried with the carriage, the ink supply<br>
can be in continuous fluid communication with the printhead by the use of a conduit to<br>
replenish the printhead continuously. Alternatively, the printhead can be intermittently<br>
connected with the ink supply by positioning the printhead proximate to a filling station<br>
that facilitates connection of the printhead to the ink supply.<br>
[0004] For the case where the ink supply is carried with the carriage, the ink supply may<br>
be integral with the printhead, whereupon the entire printhead and ink supply is replaced<br>
when ink is exhausted. Alternatively, the ink supply can be carried with the carriage and<br>
be separately replaceable from the printhead. For the case where the ink supply is<br>
separately replaceable, the ink supply is replaced when exhausted, and the printhead is<br>
replaced at the end of printhead life. Regardless of where the ink supply is located within<br>
the printing system, it is critical that the ink supply provide a reliable supply of ink to the<br>
inkjet printhead.<br>
[0005] There is an ever present need for ink supplies which make use of low cost<br>
materials and are relatively easy to manufacture, thereby reducing ink supply cost that<br>
tends to reduce the per page printing costs. In addition, these ink containers should be<br>
volumetrically efficient to produce a relative compact ink supply for reducing the overall<br>
size of the printing system. In addition, these ink supplies should be capable of being<br>
made in different form factors so that the size of the printing system can be optimised.<br>
[0006] Finally, these ink supplies should be capable of forming a reliable fluid<br>
connection with the printing system upon insertion into the printing system. This fluid<br>
connection should reduce the evaporation of water and other volatile ink components and<br>
minimize entry of air and contaminants from the ink delivery system.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] One aspect of the present invention is a replaceable printing component for m<br>
inkjet printing system configured for receiving the replaceable printing component.<br>
[0008] The inkjet printing system has a fluid inlet and a sealing structure. The<br>
replaceable printing component includes a sealing surface configured for engaging a<br>
corresponding sealing structure on the inkjet printing system. The sealing surface is<br>
configured so that sealing material that wets the sealing surface seals defects between the<br>
sealing surface and the sealing structure.<br>
[0009] Another aspect of the present invention is a replaceable ink container for<br>
providing ink to an inkjet printing system. The inkjet printing system is of the type<br>
having a receiving station for receiving the replaceable ink container. The receiving<br>
station has a fluid inlet and a sealing structure. The replaceable ink container includes a<br>
reservoir defining a fluid outlet and a sealing surface proximate the fluid outlet. The<br>
replaceable ink container also includes a sealing material contained within the reservon<br>
for wetting the sealing surface to seal defects between the sealing surface and the sealing<br>
structure.<br>
[0010] In one preferred embodiment, the sealing material is a pigmented ink. The<br>
pigmented ink when dried solidifies between the sealing surface and the sealing structure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0023] FIG. 1 is a perspective view of one exemplary embodiment of a printing system<br>
10, shown with its cover open, that includes at least one replaceable ink container 12 that<br>
is installed in a receiving station 14. With the replaceable ink container 12 properly<br>
installed into the receiving station 14, ink is provided from the replaceable ink container<br>
12 to at least one ink jet printhead 16. The ink jet printhead 16 includes a small ink<br>
reservoir and an ink ejection portion that is responsive to activation signals from a primer<br>
portion 18 to deposit ink on print media. As ink is ejected from the printhead 16, the<br>
printhead 16 is replenished with ink from the ink container 12.<br>
[0024] In an illustrative embodiment, the replaceable ink container 12, the receiving<br>
station 14, and the ink jet printhead 16 are each part of a scanning print carriage 20 that is<br>
moved relative to a print media 22 to accomplish printing. Alternatively, the ink jet<br>
printhead 16 is fixed and the print media is moved past the printhead 16 to accomplish<br>
printing. The printer portion 18 includes a media tray for receiving print media 22. As<br>
print media 22 is stepped through the print zone, the scanning carriage moves the<br>
printhead 16 relative to the print media 22. The printer portion 18 selectively activates the<br>
printhead 16 to deposit ink on print media 22 to thereby accomplish printing.<br>
[0025] The scanning carriage 20 is moved through the print zone on a scanning<br>
mechanism, which includes a slider rod 26 on which the scanning carriage 20 slides is<br>
the scanning carriage 20 moves through a scan axis. A positioning means (not shown) is<br>
used for precisely positioning the scanning carriage 20. In addition, a paper advance<br>
mechanism (not shown) is used to step the print media 22 through the print zone as the<br>
scanning carriage 20 is moved along the scan axis. Electrical signals are provided to he<br>
scanning carriage 20 for selectively activating the printhead 16 by means of an electrical<br>
link such as a ribbon cable 28.<br>
[0026] A method and apparatus is provided for inserting the ink container 12 into the<br>
receiving station 14 such that the ink container 12 forms proper fluidic and electrical<br>
interconnect with the printer portion 18. The fluidic interconnection allows a supply of<br>
ink within the replaceable ink container 12 to be fluidically coupled to the printhead 16<br>
for providing a source of ink to the printhead 16. The electrical interconnection allows<br>
information to be passed between the replaceable ink container 12 and the printer por ion<br>
18. Information passed between the replaceable ink container 12 and the printer portion<br>
18 can include information related to the compatibility of replaceable ink container 12<br>
with printer portion 18 and operation status information such as the ink level information,<br>
to name some examples.<br>
[0027] One aspect of the present invention is a fluid interconnection technique that<br>
reduces the loss of water and other volatile ink components, and minimizes air transfer<br>
into the ink delivery system. This technique as will be discussed in more detail with<br>
respect to FIGS. 8-11, makes use of a sealing material carried with the ink container to<br>
seal imperfections in a sealing member thereby limiting loss of volatiles in the ink. The<br>
sealing material reduces the effect of contamination on sealing surfaces to increase seal<br>
robustness. By preventing loss of volatiles in the ink the reliability of printing system is<br>
improved.<br>
[0028] FIG. 2 is a simplified schematic representation of the inkjet printing system 10<br>
shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 2 is simplified to illustrate a single printhead 16 connected to a<br>
single ink container 12. The inkjet printing system 10 includes the printer portion 18 and<br>
the ink container 12, which is configured to be received by the printer portion 18. The<br>
printer portion 18 includes the inkjet printhead 16 and a controller 29. With the ink<br>
container 12 properly inserted into the printer portion 18. an electrical and fluidic<br>
coupling is established between the ink container 12 and the printer portion 18. The<br>
fluidic coupling allows ink stored within the ink container 12 to be provided to the<br>
printhead 16. The electrical coupling allows information to be passed between an<br>
electrical storage device 80 disposed on the ink container 12 and the printer portion 18.<br>
[0029] The exchange of information between the ink container 12 and the printer portion<br>
18 is to ensure the operation of the printer portion 18 is compatible with the ink contained<br>
within the replaceable ink container 12 thereby achieving high print quality and reliable<br>
operation of the printing system 10.<br>
[0030] The controller 29, among other things, controls the transfer of information<br>
between the printer portion 18 and the replaceable ink container 12. In addition, the<br>
controller 29 controls the transfer of information between the printhead 16 and the<br>
controller 29 for activating the printhead to selectively deposit ink on print media. In<br>
addition, the controller 29 controls the relative movement of the printhead 16 and print<br>
media. The controller 29 performs additional functions such as controlling the transfer of<br>
information between the printing system 10 and a host device such as a host computer<br>
(not shown).<br>
[0031] FIG. 3 is a perspective view of a portion of the scanning carriage 20 showing a<br>
pair of replaceable ink containers 12 properly installed in the receiving station 14. An<br>
inkjet printhead 16 is in fluid communication with the receiving station 14. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the inkjet printing system 10 includes a tricolor ink container<br>
containing three separate ink colors and a second ink container containing a single ink<br>
color. In this embodiment, the tri-color ink container contains cyan, magenta, and yellow<br>
inks, and the single color ink container contains black ink for accomplishing four-color<br>
printing. The replaceable ink containers 12 can be partitioned differently to contain fewer<br>
than three ink colors or more than three ink colors if more are required. For example, in<br>
the vase of high fidelity printing, frequently six or more colors are used to accomplish<br>
prilling.<br>
[0032] In an exemplary embodiment, four inkjet print printheads 16, one printhead 16 for<br>
printing black ink, and three printheads 16 for printing cyan, magenta and yellow, are<br>
each fluidically coupled to the receiving station 14. In this exemplary embodiment, each<br>
of the four printheads is fluidically coupled to one of the four colored inks contained in<br>
the replaceable ink containers. Thus, the cyan, magenta, yellow and black printheads 16<br>
are each coupled to their corresponding cyan, magenta, yellow and black ink supplies,<br>
respectively. Other configurations which make use of fewer printheads than four are also<br>
possible. For example, the printheads 16 can be configured to print more than one ink<br>
color by properl) partitioning the printhead 16 to allow a first ink color to be provided to<br>
a first group of ink nozzles and a second ink color to be provided to a second group of ink<br>
nozzles, with the second group of ink nozzles different from the first group. In this<br>
manner a single printhead 16 can be used to print more than one ink color allowing<br>
fewer titan four printheads 16 to accomplish four-color printing.<br>
[0033] In another exemplary embodiment, four printheads each with a printhead can be<br>
employed, with four replaceable ink containers, and with each cartridge fluidically<br>
coupled so one of the four colored inks contained in the replaceable ink containers. Thus,<br>
for this alternate embodiment, the cyan, magenta, yellow and black printheads are each<br>
coupled to their corresponding cyan, magenta, yellow and black ink supplies,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0034] The scanning carriage portion 20 shown in FIG. 3 is shown fluidically coupled to<br>
a single printhead 16 for simplicity. Each of the replaceable ink containers 12 includes a<br>
latch 30 for securing the replaceable ink container 12 to the receiving station 14. The<br>
receiving station 14 in the preferred embodiment includes a set of keys 32 that interact<br>
with corresponding keying features (not shown) on the replaceable ink container 12. The<br>
keying features 10 on the replaceable ink container 12 interact with the keys 32 on the<br>
receiving station 14 to ensure that the replaceable ink container 12 is compatible with the<br>
receiving station 14.<br>
[0035] FIG. 4 is a side plan view of the scanning carriage portion 20 shown in FIG. 2.<br>
The scanning carriage portion 20 includes the ink container 12 shown properly installed<br>
into the receiving station 14, thereby establishing fluid communication between the<br>
replaceable ink container 12 and the printhead 16.<br>
[0036] The replaceable ink container 12 includes a reservoir portion 34 for containing<br>
one or more quantities of ink. In the preferred embodiment, the tri-color replaceable ink<br>
container 12 has three separate ink containment reservoirs, each containing ink of a<br>
different color. In this preferred embodiment the monochrome replaceable ink container<br>
12 is a single ink reservoir 34 for containing ink of a single color.<br>
[0037] In the preferred embodiment, the reservoir 34 has a capillary storage member 92<br>
(FIGS. 8-9) disposed therein. The capillary storage member 92 is a porous member<br>
having sufficient capillarity to retain ink to prevent ink leakage from the reservoir 3a<br>
during insertion and removal of the ink container 12 from the printing system 10. This<br>
capillary force is sufficiently great to prevent ink leakage from the ink reservoir 34 over a<br>
wide variety of environmental conditions such as temperature and pressure changes. In<br>
addition, the capillarity of the capillary member is sufficient to retain ink within the ink<br>
reservoir 34 for all orientations of the ink reservoir as well as a reasonable amount of<br>
shock and vibration the ink container may experience during normal handling. The<br>
preferred capillary storage member is a network of heat bonded polymer fibers described<br>
in US Patent Application entitled"Ink Reservoir for an InkJet Printer"attorney docket<br>
10991407 filed on October 29,1999, serial number 09/430,400, assigned to the assignee<br>
of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference. Other types of capillary<br>
material could alternatively be employed, such as foam.<br>
[0038] Once the ink container 12 is properly installed into the receiving station 14, the<br>
ink container 12 is fluidically coupled to the printhead 16 by way of fluid interconnect<br>
36. Upon activation of the printhead 16, ink is ejected from the printhead 16 producing a<br>
negative gauge pressure, sometimes referred to as backpressure, within the printhead 16.<br>
This negative gauge pressure within the printhead 16 is sufficient to overcome the<br>
capillary force resulting from the capillary member disposed within the ink reservoir 34.<br>
Ink is drawn by this backpressure from the replaceable ink container 12 to the printhead<br>
16. In this manner, the printhead 16 is replenished with ink provided by the replaceable<br>
ink container 12.<br>
[0033] The fluid interconnect 36 is preferably an upstanding ink pipe that extends<br>
upwardly into the ink container 12 and downwardly to the inkjet printhead 16. The fluid<br>
interconnect 36 is shown greatly simplified in FIG. 4. In the preferred embodiment, the<br>
fluid interconnect 36 is a manifold that allows for offset in the positioning of the<br>
printheads 16 along the scan axis, thereby allowing the printhead 16 to be placed offset<br>
from the corresponding replaceable ink container 12. In the preferred embodiment, the<br>
fluid irterconnect 36 extends into the reservoir 34 to compress the capillary member,<br>
thereby forming a region of increased capillarity adjacent the fluid interconnect 36. This<br>
region of increased capillarity tends to draw ink toward the fluid interconnect 36, thereby<br>
allowing ink to flow through the fluid interconnect 36 to the printhead 16. The ink<br>
container 12 is properly positioned within the receiving station 14 such that proper<br>
comprejs'on of the capillary member is accomplished when the ink container 12 is<br>
inserted into the receiving station. Proper compression of the capillary member estab-<br>
lishes a reliable flow of ink from the ink container 12 to the printhead 16.<br>
[0040] The replaceable ink container 12 further includes a guide feature 40, an<br>
engagement feature 42, a handle 44 and a latch feature 30 that allow the ink container 12<br>
to be inserted into the receiving station 14 to achieve reliable fluid interconnection with<br>
the printhead 16 as well as form reliable electrical interconnection between the<br>
replaceable ink container 12 and the scanning carriage 20.<br>
[0041] In this exemplary embodiment, the receiving station 14 includes a guide rail 46,<br>
an engagement feature 48 and a latch engagement feature 50. The guide rail 46<br>
cooperates with the guide rail engagement feature 40 and the replaceable ink container 12<br>
to guide the ink container 12 into the receiving station 14. Once the replaceable ink<br>
container 12 is fully inserted into the receiving station 14, the engagement feature 42<br>
associated with the replaceable ink container engages the engagement feature 48<br>
associated with the receiving station 14, securing a front end or a leading end of the<br>
replaceable ink container 12 to the receiving station 14. The ink container 12 is then<br>
pressed downward to compress a spring biasing member 52 associated with the receiving<br>
station 14 until a latch engagement feature 50 associated with the receiving station 14<br>
engages a hook feature 54 associated with the latch member 30 to secure a back end or<br>
trailing end of the ink container 12 to the receiving station 14.<br>
[0042] FIG. 5 is a front perspective view of the ink receiving station 14 shown in<br>
isolation. The receiving station 14 shown in FIG. 5 includes a monochrome bay 56 for<br>
receiving an ink container 12 containing a single ink color and a tri-color bay 58 for<br>
receiving an ink container having three separate ink colors contained therein. In this<br>
preferred embodiment, the monochrome bay 56 receives a replaceable ink container 12<br>
containing black ink, and the tri-color bay receives a replaceable ink container 12<br>
containing cyan, magenta, and yellow inks, each partitioned into a separate reservoir<br>
within the ink container 12. The receiving station 14 as well as the replaceable ink con-<br>
tainer 12 can have other arrangements of bays 56 and 58 for receiving ink containers<br>
containing different numbers of distinct inks contained therein. In addition, the number of<br>
receiving bays 56 and 58 for the receiving station 14 can be fewer or greater than two.<br>
[0043] For example, a receiving station 14 can have four separate bays for receiving four<br>
separate monochrome ink containers 12 with each ink container containing a separate ink<br>
color to accomplish four-color printing.<br>
[0044] Each bay 56 and 58 of the receiving station 14 includes an aperture 60 for<br>
receiving each of the upright fluid interconnects 36 that extend there through. The fluid<br>
interconnect 36 is a fluid inlet for ink to exit a corresponding fluid outlet associated with<br>
the ink container 12. An electrical interconnect 62 is also included in each receiving bay<br>
56 and 58. The electrical interconnect 62 includes a plurality of electrical contacts 64. In<br>
the preferred embodiment, the electrical contacts 64 are an arrangement of four spring-<br>
loaded electrical contacts with proper installation of the replaceable ink container 12 into<br>
the corresponding bay of the receiving station 14.<br>
[0045] The receiving station 14 shown in Fig 5 is simplified and does not show detail of<br>
the fluid interconnect 36. A separate fluid interconnect 36 extends through each aperture<br>
60 to provide fluidic coupling between the ink container 12 and the corresponding<br>
printhead 16. The fluidic interconnect 36 is shown in more detail in Figs. 8,9,10a and<br>
10b.<br>
[0046] FIG. 6 is a bottom view of a three-color replaceable ink container 12 of the<br>
present invention shown in isolation. The replaceable ink container 12 includes a pair of<br>
outwardly projecting guide rail engagement features 40. In the preferred embodiment,<br>
each of these guide rail engagement features 40 extend outwardly in a direction<br>
orthogonal to upright side 70 of the replaceable ink container 12. The engagement<br>
features 42 extend outwardly from a front surface or leading edge of the ink container 72.<br>
The engagement features 42 are disposed on either side of an electrical interface 74 and<br>
are disposed toward a bottom surface 76 of the replaceable ink container 12. The electri-<br>
cal interface 74, shown in Fig 7, includes a plurality of electrical contacts 78, with each<br>
of the electrical contacts 78 electrically connected to an electrical storage device 80.<br>
[0047] Once the ink container 12 is installed into the printing system 10 and fluidically<br>
coupled to the printhead by way of fluid interconnect 36, the capillary storage member 92<br>
should allow ink to flow from the ink container 12 to the ink jet printhead 16. As the<br>
printhead 16 ejects ink. a negative gauge pressure, sometimes referred to as a<br>
backpressure, is created in the printhead 16. This negative gauge pressure within the<br>
printhead 16 should be sufficient to overcome the capillary force retaining ink within the<br>
capillary member 92, thereby allowing ink to flow from the ink container 12 into the<br>
printhead 16 until equilibrium is reached. Once equilibrium is reached and the gauge<br>
pressure within the printhead 16 is equal to the capillary force retaining ink within the ink<br>
container 12, ink no longer flows from the ink container 12 to the printhead 16. The<br>
gauge pressure in the printhead 16 will generally depend on the rate of ink ejection from<br>
the printhead 16. As the printing rate or ink ejection rate increases, the gauge pressure<br>
within the printhead will become more negative, causing ink to flow at a higher rate to<br>
the printhead 16 from the ink container 12.<br>
[0048] In one preferred inkjet printing system 10 the printhead 16 produces a maximum<br>
backpressure that is equal to 10 inches of water or a negative gauge pressure that is equal<br>
to 10 inches of water. The maximum backpressure will depend on the particular printhead<br>
used in the system. As the backpressure increases, the size of the ink droplets ejected by<br>
the printhead 16 becomes smaller, leading eventually to print quality problems, and<br>
ultimately to depriming, when air is pulled through the printhead nozzles. The smaller the<br>
nozzle size, the higher will be the backpressure tolerated by the printhead before the print<br>
quality issues are typically encountered. Thus, for an exemplary form of thermal inkjet<br>
printhead, depriming of a black ink printhead typically occurs at a backpressure of about<br>
19 inches of water, and print quality issues arise at a backpressure of about 8 inches of<br>
water. For an exemplary color ink printhead, which typically has smaller nozzles than a<br>
black ink printhead, depriming occurs at a backpressure about 30 inches of water, and<br>
prirt quality issues arise at a backpressure of about 12 inches of water.<br>
[0049] FIG. 7 is a perspective view of a monochrome or single color replaceable ink<br>
container 12 of the present invention. The monochrome ink container 12 is similar to the<br>
tri-color ink container 12 shown in FIG. 6 except that only a single ink color is container<br>
therein instead of three separate ink colors contained within the tri-color ink container 12.<br>
[0050] FIG. 8 is a cross-sectional view taken along line 8-8 of FIG. 4, illustrating in<br>
further detail the ink container 12, comprising the reservoir portion or containment vessel<br>
34, with the reservoir material 90 disposed therein. The ink container 12 is shown<br>
positioned for connection with the fluid interconnect 36 on the ink container receiving<br>
station 14 for illustrative purposes.<br>
[0051] The ink container receiving station 14 includes the fluid interconnect 36 for<br>
establishing fluid coupling to the ink container 12 and a fluid interconnect 92 for<br>
establishing fluid coupling with the corresponding printhead 16 and a fluid coupling 94 in<br>
fluid communication with each of the fluid interconnects 36 and 92. Once the ink<br>
container 12 is properly inserted into the receiving station 14, the fluid interconnect 36<br>
extends into the reservoir 34 to compress the capillary member 90 and establish fluid<br>
communication between the ink container 12 and the printhead 16.<br>
[0052] The ink container receiving station 14 also includes a sealing structure 96 to<br>
provide a seal between the ink container 12 and the receiving station 14. The sealing<br>
structure 96 tends to limit evaporation of volatile ink components such as water within<br>
the ink container 12 once the ink container 12 is properly installed into the receiving<br>
station 14. In addition, the sealing structure 96 tends to prevent contamination of the ink<br>
provided to the printhead 14. In one preferred embodiment, the sealing structure 96 is a<br>
circumferential structure that is formed from a resilient material. As the ink container 12<br>
is inserted into the receiving station 14, the sealing structure 96 engages a sealing surface<br>
98 proximate the fluid outlet 88 of the ink container to form a seal between the sealing<br>
structure 96 and trie ink container 12. The seal is established by a sealing surface 98<br>
associated with the sealing structure 96 engaging the sealing surface 100 associated with<br>
the ink container 2.<br>
[0053] In one exemplary embodiment, the sealing structure 96 is attached to the fluid<br>
interconnect 36 so that once the ink container 12 is properly inserted into the receiving<br>
station 14, the sealing structure 96 forms a seal between the sealing surface 100 on the<br>
ink container 12 and the outer circumference of the fluid interconnect 36. In this manner,<br>
exposure of ink to the atmosphere is greatly reduced, tending to limit the evaporation of<br>
volatiles within the ink container 12.<br>
[0054] FIG. 9 shows the ink container 12 properly inserted into the receiving station 14<br>
such that ink flow between the ink container 12 and the fluid interconnect 36 is<br>
established. The sealing structure 96 is shown engaged with the sealing surface 100 on<br>
the ink container 12 to form a seal around the fluid outlet 88 of the ink container 12 for<br>
limiting the evaporation of volatiles within the ink. The seal is formed by opposing<br>
surfaces on the sealing structure 96 that engage with the sealing surface 100 on the ink<br>
container 12 to form a face seal therebetween.<br>
[0055] The ink reservoir 34 in the preferred embodiment includes a vent 38 for<br>
equalizing pressure within the reservoir 34 to allow the extraction of ink from the ink<br>
container 12. The vent 38 is preferably formed to limit evaporation of volatiles within the<br>
ink. In one preferred embodiment, the vent 38 is formed by using a labyrinth for<br>
minimizing air entry while providing pressure equalization within the ink container 12 so<br>
that ink can be extracted from the ink container 12 without building up excessive<br>
backpressure. The use of a labyrinth greatly reduces volatile loss in the ink due to the<br>
vent 38. Therefore, it is important that the sealing structure 96 properly seal to limit<br>
volatiles within the ink from escaping.<br>
[0056] The sealing structure 96 in one exemplary embodiment is formed of a resilient<br>
material such as elastomeric structure such as Ethylene-Propylene-Diene monomer/butyl<br>
blend (EPDM/buytyl). Alternatively, the sealing structure 96 includes a spring that<br>
compressed as the ink container 12 is inserted into the receiving station 14 so that the<br>
spring urges the sealing structure 96 against the ink container 12 to establish a seal<br>
between the ink container 12 and the receiving station 14 to prevent evaporation of<br>
volatiles within the ink. An exemplary form of the sealing structure 96 with a spring is<br>
described in co-pending application serial number 09/651,682, filed August 30,2000,<br>
LONG-LIFE SPRING-BACKED FLUID INTERCONNECT SEAL.<br>
[0057] 11G. 10a is a greatly enlarged view of the sealing structure 96 in engagement with<br>
the outet surface of the ink container 12 shown in FIG. 9. In one preferred embodiment,<br>
the sealing surface 98 of the sealing structure 96 includes an annular groove 102 formed<br>
therein. The annular groove 102 is configured to retain a sealing material 104 provided<br>
by the ink container 12. In the preferred embodiment, the sealing material 104 provided<br>
by the ink container is an ink having suspended particles therein. As the ink within the<br>
annular groove dries, the suspended particles come out of suspension and solidify to seal<br>
any defects between the sealing surfaces 98 and 100. In an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
sealing material is a pigmented ink having suspended carbon black particles therein.<br>
Pigmented ink such as this exemplary pigmented ink is described in detail in U. S. Patent<br>
No.8,085,698.<br>
[0058] To encourage the sealing material to enter the annular groove 102, the sealing<br>
surface 100 on the ink container 12 can be formed to be highly wettable. Surfaces that are<br>
highly wettable tend to draw sealing material to the sealing surface 100. Alternatively,<br>
various mechanical features such as capillary structures can be formed in the ink<br>
container 12 to draw ink to the annular surface so that the surface between the sealing<br>
structure 96 and the ink container 12 are wetted to seal defects there between.<br>
[0059] FIG. 10b is a cross-section taken across lines 10 b to show the sealing surface 98<br>
of the sealing structure 96 shown partially broken away. In one preferred embodiment,<br>
the annular groove 102 formed within the sealing surface 98 to retain the sealing material<br>
104. Retaining sealing material 104 within the groove 102 ensures sealing material 104 is<br>
present to seal defects that exist along the entire continuum of the seal surface. Defects<br>
along the seal surface may be the result of molding defects that can produce irregularities<br>
in the seal surface, or contamination on the seal surface. By sealing defects with sealing<br>
material 104 the seal between the sealing surface 98 and the sealing surface 100 is<br>
improved.<br>
[0060] FIG. 11 is graphical representation showing the defect size versus percent of<br>
sealing for the seal between the ink container 12 and fluid interconnect 36 with and<br>
without the use of the sealant for sealing defects of the present invention. The sealing<br>
ability of a face seal such as shown in FIG. 10a between the sealing surface 98 and the<br>
sealing surface 100 using pigmented ink as a sealant is represented by curve 106. The<br>
sealing ability of the same face seal but without the use of the sealing material is<br>
represented buy curve 108 shown in dashed lines. Without the use of the sealing material<br>
no seal is formed when the defect is greater than 25 microns. In contrast, the use of<br>
pigmented ink as a sealant allows a seal to be at least partially formed for defects less<br>
thai 125 microns. The crosshatched portion 110 between curves 106 and 108 represents<br>
an improvement in sealing using the technique of the present invention. Pigmented ink is<br>
an effective sealant for surface seals such as face seals. The use of pigmented ink as a<br>
sealing material tends to allow the system to be self-sealing and is especially effective for<br>
defec'vS that are of smaller size.<br>
[0061] The present invention provides an improved seal for preventing the loss of<br>
volaties such as water from ink within the ink container and the entire ink delivery<br>
system. This improved seal makes use of the unique properties of pigmented ink to seal<br>
any imperfections at the seal surface. The improved seal of the present invention allows<br>
the seal to be a relatively inexpensive face seal thereby tending to reduce the overall costs<br>
of the printing system. In addition, the sealing technique of the present invention makes<br>
for relatively easy insertion and removable requirements thereby tending to reduce the<br>
costs and size of the receiving station. Finally, by preventing the loss of volatiles from the<br>
ink, the reliability of the printing system is improved as well as the quality of the printed<br>
images<br>
[0062] The present invention has been discussed with respect to the use of sealing<br>
material to improve the robustness of the seal between the ink container 12 and the<br>
receiving station 14. The technique of the present invention is suitable for sealing other<br>
fluid sails in the ink delivery system as well. For example, a similar seal arrangement can<br>
be used netween the printhead 16 and the fluid interconnect 36 as the seal arrangement<br>
used between the ink container 12 and fluid interconnect 36. The sealing material of the<br>
present invention can be used to seal defects present in the seal between the printhead 16<br>
and the fluid interconnect 36.<br>
