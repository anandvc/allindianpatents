Glasses<br>
The invention relates to glasses for everyday use, comprising a frame into which is fitteci a lens system for the correction of defective vision, which comprises at least one pair of lenses formed by a first lens and a second lens, which first and second lens, viewed in the path of vision, are disposed one behind the other and are mutually adjustable for realising a desired degree of correction of vision,<br>
Glasses with such a lens system are known, for exam-ple, from ÜS-Ä-5 644 374.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide such glasses wherein the adjustment for realising the desired degree of correction of vision is very simple to carry out, and can easily be modified as required.<br>
To this end the glasses according to the invention are characterized, in that the first lens is coupled with a first adjusting element and the second lens is coupled with a second adjusting element, and in that in the assembled State the first and the second adjusting elements form an integral component of an adjusting organ, and are designed for moving one along the other for the purpose of an adjustment of the lenses,<br>
The glasses according to the invention are adjusted simply by moving the first adjusting element and the second adjusting element in relation to each other and subsequently, when the desired correction pf vision has been realised, to fix them in the position reached.<br>
It is observed that a lens system, of which the first lens is coupled with a first adjusting element and the second lens is coupled with a second adjusting element, and wherein the first and the second adjusting elements in the assembled state form an integral component of an adjusting organ, and are designed for moving one along the other for the purpose of adjusting the lenses is known as such from EP-A-l 433 415. However, this publication does not concern glasses for everyday use but -an eye refraction system of Which such a lens system forms a part.<br><br>
- To facilitate easy adjustment, it is desirable for the first adjusting element and the second adjusting element to be provided with a first and second thread, respectively.<br>
An embodiment of the glasses according to the inven-tion that is convenient and simple to operate is character-.ized/ in that the adjusting organ comprises a spindle rod, circumferentially provided with at least a third and a fourth thread designed to engage the first and second thread, respectively r   of the first and second adjusting element,<br>
The pitch of both the first and the second thread of the adjusting elements as well as of the third and fourth threads of the spindle rod run counter to one another.<br>
In order to facilitate the Operation it is further desirable for the adjusting organ to be incorporated in the frame, and for the spindle rod to have an operating organ that projects at least beyond the outer side of said frame.<br>
A sturdy embodiment of the glasses according to the invention is characterized, in that one of the two adjusting elements of the adjusting organ is fixed and integrated with the frame, and the other adjusting element is designed for movement along the adjusting element integrated with the frame, for the purpose of adjusting the lenses in relation to each other.<br>
Hereinafter the invention will be further elucidated by way of a preferred embodiment of the glasses according to the invention, without limiting the appended Claims.<br>
The drawing shows in:<br>
-	Figure 1, a part of the glasses according to the invention, and<br>
-	Figure 2, a detail of the glasses shown in Figure 1.<br>
Identical reference numerals in the figures refer to similar parts.<br>
Figure 1 shows a part of a pair of glasses 1.<br>
These glasses 1 are provided with temples, one tem™ ple 2 being shown in Figure 1.<br>
The temple 2 is linked to a bridge piece 3 of a frame, which in a manner well-known to the person skilled in<br><br>
the art, continues in the direction of arrow A forrning a mir-ror-image part of the glasses 1, where the glasses are pro-vided with a second temple.<br>
Linked to the bridge piece 3 is a pair of lenses 4,<br>
5	comprised of a first lens 4 and a second lens" 5.<br>
Viewed in the path of vision, the first lens 4 and the second lens 5 are disposed one behind the other and are mutually adjustable for realising a desirable degree of cor-rection of vision in said path of vision.<br>
The desirable correction of vision is realised in accordance with the above-mentioned publication U3-A-5 644 374 or more generally in accordance with US-A-3 305 294.<br>
To this end the first lens 4 is coupled with a first adjusting element 6 and the second lens 5 is coupled with a second adjusting element 7,<br>
One thing and another is further elucidated by way of Figure 2, which shows in detail the pair of lenses comprised of the first lens 4 and the second lens 5, together with the first adjusting element 6 and the second adjusting element 7 coupled thereto.<br>
With respect to this first adjusting element 6 and the second adjusting element 7 it is observed that in the as~ sembled state7 they form an integral component of an adjusting organ, which in the present case is incorporated in the bridge piece 3 of a frame. The first adjusting element 6 and the second adjusting element 7 are designed to act together such as to implement an  adjustment of the first lens 4 and the second lens 5, that corresponds to the desired degree of correction of vision. Figure 2 shows an exploded view of the bridge piece 3 that incorporates the first adjusting element<br>
6	and the second adjusting element 7, so as to illustrate<br>
that the first adjusting element 6 has a first thread 8 and<br>
correspondingly, that the second adjusting element 7 is pro-<br>
vided with a second thread 9.<br>
As is shown in Figure 1, the glasses 1 according to the invention further comprise a spindle rod 10 which, together with the first adjusting element 6 and second adjusting element 7, is incorporated in the bridge piece 3 of a<br><br>
frame. Said spindle rod 10 is circumferentially provided with a third thread 11, which is designed to engage the first thread 8 of the first adjusting element 6, and with a fourth tread 12 that engages the second thread 9 of the second adjusting element 7.<br>
The pitch of the first thread 8 of the first adjusting element 6' and of the second thread 9 of the second adjusting element 7 run counter to each other, as do the pitch of the third 11 and fourth 12 thread provided on the spindle rod 10.<br>
It is worth mentioning that it is also possible to provide only one of the two adjusting elements with the above-elucidated thread for engaging the threaded rod, The other adjusting element may then be embodied without thread and in a fixed position, for example, as part of the frame. In this embodiment, only one of the lenses is adjustable and the other lens is unadjustably mounted in the frame. Never-theless, it is possible to adjust the lenses in relation to each other by operating the threaded rod and through the en-suing adjustment of the moveable adjusting element with which the adjustable lens is coupled.<br>
With regard to operating the adjusting organ 6, 7, 10, it is for all possible embodiments preferred that the spindle rod 10 at the outward side of the temple 2 be provided with a conveniently controllable operating organ 13.<br>
The other side of the glasses may also be provided with such an operating organ 13.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
