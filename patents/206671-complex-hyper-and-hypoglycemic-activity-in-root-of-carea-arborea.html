TITLE<br>
"A method of making Careya arborea herbal drug for complex hyper-and hypoglycemic activity."<br>
Field of Invention<br>
Involvement of plants to cure various diseases is a multidisciplinary area of research, concerned with the observation, description and experimental investigation of indigenous plants drugs and their biological activities. It is the interdisciplinary scientific exploration of biologically active agents.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
Modern medicine has made phenomenal progress in the treatment of several diseases. Yet, scientists are unable to find a successful and sure-cure therapy against certain diseases. A metabolic disease such as diabetes has eluded the efforts made by scientists. So far, only palliative therapies have been discovered for them. In fact, there are serious side toxic effects as a result of prolonged use of such conventional drugs. It is, therefore, essential to look for remedies from non-conventional sources, which can not only control diabetes successfully, but also cure it forever.<br>
Object of Invention<br>
Metabolic diseases such as diabetes have eluded efforts made by scientists. So far, only palliative therapies have been discovered for them. In     fact, there are serious side toxic effects as a result of prolonged use of such conventional drugs. It is, therefore, essential to look for remedies from non-conventional sources, which can not only control diabetes successfully, but also cure it forever.<br>
Despite tremendous advances witnessed in modern medicine, vaccines and diagnostics, the evaluation of plants and, of their active natural principles is the logical way of searching for the new drugs to treat this disease. Screening of plant material serves several other purposes, to develop new drugs and new<br><br>
Plant material serves several other purpose to develop new drugs and new leads to identify not only the chemical varieties but also novel type of ' biological activities.<br>
Summary<br>
The most important methods for discovering new herbal drugs from non conventional sources is to analyse them for their biological activity, and the plant species, Careya arborea was selected for analysis, with a view to search safe cure the most alarming disease; diabetes. This species showed complex Hyper- and hypoglycemic activity in glucose loaded albino rats. Hypoglycemia was not observed in any of the experimental animals, proving it to be a safe drug.<br>
Brief Discription of The Accompanying Drawing<br>
Drawing land 2 shows the blood glucose level of different groups at different time interval. Drawing 3 and 4 represents the percent rise in blood sugar level of the groups at various time interval.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
Single Dose Experiment: Normal albino rats were used for screening of natural product for hypoglycemic activity. At the primary screening level the natural product was fed to the animals orally. The dried sample powder as well as its aqueous extract has been gsed. Animals were fasted for sixteen hours The blood from tail end of each rat was withdrawn for estimating blood glucose level. The blood glucose level was read in glucometer using Accutrend sensor comfort strip used in Advantage glucometer. The natural product was fed to the animal orally and a dose of 100 mg / kg body weight was used.<br>
Fifteen Sprague Dawley strain (out bred) albino rats were taken and kept in polypropylene cages in three groups of three each for fifteen days for acclimatization under standard experimental room conditions.<br><br><br><br>
On the day sixteenth all the food from each cage was removed and the animals were kept for overnight starvation (5:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m.).<br>
On the day seventeenth, approximately 0.10 ml blood was drawn from tail end of each rat. This blood was introduced on the area specified on the strips for blood sample (Accutrend sensor comfort used in Advantage Glucometer) The strip was put in the glucometer for reading of blood sugar count. Animals, which showed blood glucose levels between 60 - 80 mg/dl, were finally selected and grouped into three and termed as Control Group, test sample treated Group C-l and test sample treated group C-ll. Each group contained three rats each.<br>
Aqueous decoction sample C-1 was prepared by soaking 0.5 g / 3ml, powdered sample overnight in distilled water in the night of day seventeenth .<br>
On day eighteenth, glucose solution (12.5 g /100 ml) was prepared in<br>
distilled water. Aqueous solution of C-l was filtered. C-ll freshly prepared by<br>
p\) adding 1 g sample / 3ml. Gum acacia solution was used as vehicle for oral<br>
administration of test samples to animals of group C-l and C-ll at an. arbitrary<br>
dose of 100mg/ kg body weight of the rats. The plant test samples were<br>
dissolved in 1% gum acacia solution (1g / 100ml) in the ratio of 0.3 g in 3mi.<br>
These doses were given with the help of 1.0 ml plastic syringe and cannula at<br>
zero hours. An equal amount of 1.0% gum acacia was given to animals of<br>
Control group immediately after drawing 0.10 ml blood from the tail end of each<br>
rat for glucose content (Zero hour sample). Table. 1 gives the detailed account of<br>
body weight and dose of each group.. <br>
Table .1.		<br>
DOSES<br><br><br>
Glucose solution was administered to animals of each group at a dose of 2.0 g / kg body weight, after 30 min of giving test samples. Approximately 0.10 ml blood was drawn from tail end of each rat at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min. Glucose content was determined for each animal with the help of Advantage Giucometer using Accutrend strips. No food was given to animal till the collection of last blood sample at 120 min. post glucose loaded.Table.2,3 and 4 represent the blood glucose level of different groups at different time interval.<br>

Percent Antihyperglycemic Activity of Careya arborea<br><br>
The growing concern about the side effects of drugs has meant that herbalism is called upon once more to provide natural medicines. Keeping this in view, efforts were made to establish the pharmacological value as hypoglycemic agents.<br>
Evaluation of hypoglycemic activity in the sample at the primary screening level itself, gave exciting result. This plant drug can be proved to be very helpful in combating the most alarming diseases i.e. diabetes.<br>
Detailed pharmacological investigation can lead to very interesting results, Primary screening in glucose loaded rats with multiple doses (extract / fraction / pure) can be undertaken. The work can be extended for the screening the inhibition in post prandial hyperglycemia post glucose load in diabetic rats.<br>
The experimental results in case of Careya arborea revealed slightly different pattern of hypoglycemic activity. Group C-l and Group C-ll were administered with aqueous decoction of the sample powder and powder of sample respectively. The observation showed that all these groups were maintaining almost same level of blood glucose at zero hours in the experiment performed for evaluation of hypoglycemic activity of Careya arborea (Drawing1&amp;2). The observation recorded at different time intervals for Test Group<br><br><br>
C-ll seems to be totally ineffective in showing hypoglycemic effect. As per the standard method adopted, the percent rise in blood glucose was calculated. Test Group C-l seems to be effective in lowering the blood glucose level (Hypoglycemic effect), but, surprisingly the Test Group C-ll increased the blood glucose level( Hyoerglycemic effect) (Table3, 4). Percent antihyperglycemic activity was calculated as per the standard method for both the test groups (C-l &amp; C-ll) (Drawing 3 and 4), which clearly indicated about complex Hyper- and hypoglycemic activity of Careya arborea.   .<br>
These are the novel findings. Keeping in view all the above findings it is being reported that use of aqueous decoction of powdered form and powder of root of Careya arborea in our standardized formulations are safe methods for treating complex hyper- and hypoglycemia.<br>
Dose Preparation:Root of Careya arborea was collected. The root was dried in shade below 40° C and powdered. Aqueous decoction sample C-l was prepared by soaking the sample in 1% gum acacia overnight in and the next morning it was filtered and used for testing. C-ll freshly prepared by adding sample in 1%. gum acacia and used immediately. Gum acacia solution was used as vehicle for oral administration of test samples to animals of group-S-I and-S-ll. The dose of drug in each case is 100mg/ kg body weight of the rats. Glucose solution (12.5 g /100 ml) was prepared in distilled water.<br>
The effect of herbal drug is more pronounced when used in powdered form itself in the doses standardized by us. The same doses were given to perform the experiment again on these animals after 15 days. It was found that the effect of the doses given still persisted after a fortnight. The method of treatment is simple and safe. It is safe because no indication of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) was observed in any of the experimental animals.<br><br>
