BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a tension bolt for a compressor.<br>
Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-318822, filed<br>
November 27, 2006, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
As industrial turbo compressors, a turbo compressor that compresses air, etc. at a<br>
plurality of stages is known. In this turbo compressor, a rotary shaft to which an<br>
impeller is connected is rotated via a gear train by a driving motor.<br>
There is a rotor in which an impeller is connected only to one end of a rotary<br>
shaft, a rotor in which impellers are respectively connected to both ends of a rotary shaft,<br>
or a rotor in which a plurality of such rotary shafts are provided. In any of them, a<br>
curvic coupling is used for a coupling joint between the rotary shaft and the impeller, and<br>
a tension bolt is used for a fastening mechanism of the joint. The curvic coupling that<br>
couples the rotary shaft and the impeller is made to generate a high pressing force by the<br>
axial force of the tension bolt, thereby preventing the occurrence of looseness by an acute<br>
temperature change or a vibration (refer to JP-A-4-321724 (FIG. 1)).<br>
When the curvic coupling between the rotary shaft and the impeller is fastened<br>
using the tension bolt, a fastening nut is screwed when the tension bolt is pulled to a<br>
predetermined range of the amount of elongation. The amount of elongation of the<br>
tension bolt is measured by a dial gauge. By controlling the amount of elongation of<br>
the tension bolt, the axial force (tensile force during fastening) of the tension bolt is<br><br>
2<br>
controlled indirectly.<br>
Although it is desirable that the axial force by the tension bolt be larger, an<br>
upper limit by the elastic limit of a material for the bolt exists. Further, a lower limit of<br>
the axial force that is determined from the viewpoint of prevention of looseness of the<br>
tension bolt, etc. also exists. For this reason, the tensile force of the tension bolt needs<br>
to be controlled between the lower limit and the upper limit.<br>
However, since the amount of elongation of the tension bolt is extremely small,<br>
operation will be repeated many times in order to obtain the amount of elongation<br>
targeted. As a result, there is a problem in that the operating efficiency may be lowered.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention has been made in view of the above situations, and it is therefore<br>
an object of the invention to provide a rotor of a turbo compressor capable of increasing<br>
the amount of elongation of a tension bolt for fastening an impeller and a rotary shaft of<br>
the turbo compressor, thereby improving the efficiency of coupling operation, and<br>
achieving stabilization.<br>
The following means have been adopted in the rotor of a turbo compressor<br>
according to the invention in order to solve the above problems.<br>
A first invention provides a rotor of a turbo compressor having an impeller and a<br>
rotary shaft that supports the impeller. The rotor includes a fastening mechanism<br>
having a mechanical joint formed at an end face of each of the impeller and the rotary<br>
shaft, a tension bolt inserted through a throueh-hole formed in the center of rotation of<br>
the impeller, a fastening nut screwed to a first male thread formed at one end of the<br>
tension bolt, a housing hole formed at an end face of the rotary shaft to house a portion of<br>
an elongated portion of the tension bolt, and a female thread formed at a bottom face of<br><br>
the housing hole and screwed to a second male thread formed at the other end of the<br>
tension bolt.<br>
Preferably, the depth of the housing hole is specified according to the amount of<br>
elongation of the tension bolt.<br>
Preferably, the depth of the housing hole is 10% or more of the length of the<br>
elongated portion.<br>
Preferably, the rotor of a turbo compressor further includes a washer that is fitted<br>
on one end of the tension bolt and is provided between the impeller and the fastening nut.<br>
Here, a combined length of the depth of the housing hole and the thickness of the washer<br>
may be 10% or more of the length of the elongated portion.<br>
A second invention provides a rotor of a turbo compressor having an impeller<br>
and a rotary shaft that supports the impeller. The rotor includes a fastening mechanism<br>
having a mechanical joint formed at an end face of each of the impeller and the rotary<br>
shaft, a tension bolt inserted through a through-hole formed in the center of rotation of<br>
the impeller, a fastening nut screwed to a first male thread formed at one end of the<br>
tension bolt, n female i'hrend formed at an end face of the rotarv shaft and screwed to a<br>
second male thread formed at the other end of the tension bolt, and a protruding portion<br>
formed so as to protrude from a rear central portion of the impeller to house a portion of<br>
an elongated portion of the tension bolt.<br>
Preferably, the protruding amount of the protruding portion is specified<br>
according to the amount of elongation of the tension bolt.<br>
Preferably, the protruding amount of a protruding portion is 10% or more of the<br>
length of the elongated portion.<br>
Preferably, the rotor of a turbo compressor further includes a washer that is fitted<br>
on one end of the tension bolt and is provided between the impeller and the fastening nut.<br><br>
4<br>
Here, a combined length of the protruding amount and the thickness of the washer may<br>
be 10% or more of the length of the elongated portion.<br>
According to the invention, the following effects can be obtained.<br>
In the rotor of the turbo compressor according to the invention, in the fastening<br>
mechanism that fastens the impeller to one end of the rotary shaft, the total length of the<br>
tension bolt can be increased. Thus, the control width of the amount of elongation of<br>
the tension bolt during assembling (upper limit of the amount of elongation - lower limit<br>
of the amount of elongation) can be increased, and adjustment work can be facilitated.<br>
Accordingly, the workability and working efficiency of assembling can be improved.<br>
Further, a portion of the tension bolt is housed in the housing hole formed at the<br>
end face of the rotary shaft or in the protruding portion formed at the rear central portion<br>
of the impeller. Thus, even if the length of the tension bolt becomes long, the total<br>
length of a unit in which the impeller is fastened to the rotary shaft can be made<br>
unchanged. Accordingly, stable operation can be achieved without lowering the critical<br>
velocity of the rotary shaft. Further, the shape change of other members is also<br>
unnecessary and consequently a cost rise can be suppressed.<br>

FIG, 3 is an exploded sectional view showing a fastening mechanism 70<br>
according to a first embodiment.<br>
A fastening mechanism 70 fastens the second rotary shaft 12 and the first<br>
impeller 21 or second impeller 22 in the first rotor 17. Further, the fastening<br><br>
8<br>
mechanism fastens the third rotary shaft 13 and the third impeller 23, or fourth impeller<br>
24 in the second rotor 18.<br>
Hereinafter, the fastening mechanism 70 that fastens the second rotary shaft 12<br>
and the first impeller 21 will now be described.<br>
The fastening mechanism 70 includes a curvic coupling 71 (curvic: registered<br>
trademark) that fastens the second rotary shaft 12 and the first impeller 21 so that their<br>
axes may coincide with each other, a tension bolt 74 that pinches and supports the second<br>
rotary shaft 12 and the first impeller 21 under predetermined pressure, a fastening nut 80,<br>
and the like.<br>
The curvic coupling 71 consists of a curvic toothed portion 72 formed in the<br>
shape of a face gear at an end face 12a of the second rotary shaft 12, and a curvic toothed<br>
portion 73 formed in the shape of a face gear at a rear central end face 21a of the first<br>
impeller 21. By making the curvic toothed portion 72 and the curvic toothed portion 73<br>
face each other and mesh with each other, the axis of rotation of the second rotary shaft<br>
12 and the axis of rotation of the first impeller 21 coincide with each other.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the tension bolt 74 is obtained by forming male threads 76<br>
and 77 at both ends of a high-strength steel rod, and adds a tensile force during<br>
attachment to press (pinch) a member arranged between the male threads 76 and 77 by a<br>
reaction force (axial force) to the tensile force.<br>
The tension bolt 74 consists of the male threads 76 and 77 formed at both ends,<br>
and an elongated portion 75 between the male threads76 and 77.<br>
The size of the male thread 76 or 77 is, for example, about Ml 2 to M22, and<br>
although the length of the elongated portion 75 is specified according to the length of the<br>
first impeller 21, it is, for example, about 150 mm.<br>
A housing hole 78 in which the male thread 76 and a portion of the elongated<br><br>
9<br>
portion 75 of the tension bolt 74 are housed is formed at the end face 12a of the second<br>
rotary shaft 12. Furthermore, a female thread 79 that is screwed to the male thread 76 is<br>
formed at a bottom face 78a of the housing hole 78.<br>
Accordingly, when the male thread 76 of the tension bolt 74 is inserted into the<br>
housing hole 78 formed at the end face 12a of the second rotary shaft 12 and further, the<br>
male thread 76 is screwed to the female thread 79, the tension bolt 74 is erected<br>
perpendicularly to the end face 12a of the second rotary shaft 12.<br>
In addition, the total depth of the housing hole 78 and female thread 79 is greater<br>
than the length of the male thread 76 of the tension bolt 74. Accordingly, when the<br>
male thread 76 of the tension bolt 74 is screwed to the female thread 79, a portion of the<br>
elongated portion 75 of the tension bolt 74 in the vicinity of the male thread 76 will be<br>
inevitably housed in the housing hole 78.<br>
Meanwhile, a through-hole 21c for allowing the tension bolt 74 to be inserted<br>
therethrough is formed in the center of rotation (axis) of the first impeller 21. The<br>
length of the first impeller 21 (distance from the rear central end face 21a to a front<br>
central end face 21b) is made slightly greater than the length of the elongated portion 75<br>
protruding from the end face 12a of the second rotary shaft 12. Accordingly, when the<br>
tension bolt 74 that is erected perpendicularly to the end face 12a of the second rotary<br>
shaft 12 is inserted through the through-hole 21c of the first impeller 21, the male thread<br>
77 of the tension bolt 74 protrudes from the front central end face 21b of the first<br>
impeller 21.<br>
Then the first impeller 21 is fastened to the end face 12a of the second rotary<br>
shaft 12 by screwing the fastening nut 80 to the male thread 77.<br>
Next, the assembling sequence of the fastening mechanism 70 will now be<br>
described.<br><br>
10<br>
As described above, the tension bolt 74 is inserted into the housing hole 78<br>
formed at the end face 12a of the second rotary shaft 12, and further the male thread 76<br>
of the tension bolt 74 is screwed to the female thread 79 formed at the bottom face of the<br>
housing hole 78.<br>
Next, the tension bolt 74 erected from the end face 12a of the second rotary shaft<br>
12 is inserted into the first impeller 21, thereby making the curvic toothed portion 72<br>
formed at the end face 12a of the second rotary shaft 12 and the curvic toothed portion 73<br>
formed at the rear central end face 21a of the first impeller 21 mesh with each other.<br>
Then, the fastening nut 80 is screwed to the male thread 77 of the tension bolt 74<br>
protruding from the front central end face 21b of the first impeller 21, thereby<br>
performing temporary stopping.<br>
Next, when the fastening nut 80 is fastened and is fixed, a hydraulic tension<br>
device (not shown) is connected to the male thread 77 of the tension bolt 74, thereby<br>
giving a desired tensile force to the tension bolt 74. Then, the fastening nut 80 is finally<br>
fastened to the tension bolt 74 with the tensile force added.<br>
Whether or not the tensile force is a desired value is indirectly determined by<br>
measuring the amount of elongation of the tension bolt 74 (elongated portion 75). The<br>
amount of elongation of the tension bolt 74 (elongated portion 75) is measured by a<br>
vernier caliper, a micrometer, or a dial gauge 85. In addition, the measurement<br>
resolution of the dial gauge 85 is 0.01 mm.<br>
That is, when the amount of elongation of the tension bolt 74 (elongated portion<br>
75) falls within a predetermined range, the fastening nut 80 is screwed to the tension bolt<br>
74.<br>
Then, the tensile processing by the hydraulic tension device is stopped, and the<br>
hydraulic tension device is removed from the tension bolt 74.<br><br>
11<br>
By passing through such an operation, the curvic coupling 71 (curvic toothed<br>
portions 72 and 73) is always pressed under a predetermined pressure by the axial force<br>
of the tension bolt 74. Accordingly, the axis of rotation of the second rotary shaft 12<br>
and the axis of rotation of the first impeller 21 coincide with each other, and the second<br>
rotary shaft 12 and the first impeller 21 are always coupled together without loosening.<br>
FIG. 4A is a sectional view of the fastening mechanism 70 according to the first<br>
embodiment, and FIG. 4B is a conventional example of a fastening mechanism.<br>
In the fastening mechanism 70, the total length of the tension bolt 74 is longer<br>
than that of a conventional example. To be exact, the length L of the elongated portion<br>
75 is longer than the length LI of the conventional example (the length of the male<br>
thread 76 or 77 is the same).<br>
For this reason, when the tension bolt 74 and the tension bolt of the conventional<br>
example are pulled with the same force by the hydraulic tension device, the amount of<br>
elongation of the tension bolt 74 becomes greater by such amount that the elongated<br>
portion 75 is longer.<br>
In addition, a portion of the male thread 76 or 77 of the tension bolt 74 is also<br>
elongated integrally with the elongated portion 75. That is, the portion of the male<br>
thread 76 or 77 that is screwed to neither the female thread 79 nor the fastening nut 80 is<br>
elongated. Accordingly, to be exact, a combined portion of the portion of the male<br>
thread 76 or 77 that is screwed to neither the female thread 79 nor the fastening nut 80<br>
and the elongated portion 75 becomes a substantially elongated portion.<br>
Meanwhile, as for a tensile force to be piven to the tension bolt 74 bv the<br>
hydraulic tension device, its upper limit and lower limit are set.<br>
The upper limit of the tensile force is specified according to the yield force of<br>
the tension bolt 74. On the other hand, the lower limit of the tensile force is specified<br><br>
12<br>
according to a force that is required to prevent looseness of the tension bolt 74 of the<br>
male thread 76 and 77, or a force that presses the first impeller 21 against the second<br>
rotary shaft 12 by means of the tension bolt 74.<br>
Specifically, the tensile force to be given to the tension bolt 74 is set to 0.5 to 0.7<br>
of the yield stress ay of the tension bolt 74 (upper limit: 0.7 ay and lower limit: 0.5 ay).<br>
If the strength section of the tension bolt 74 is 10.9 (JIS B 1051:2000) and the<br>
length L of the elongated portion 75 is 150 mm, the control value width of the amount of<br>
elongation (upper limit of the amount of elongation - lower limit of the amount of<br>
elongation) will be set to about 0.13 mm when a tensile force within the<br>
above-mentioned range is given to the tension bolt 74.<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to manage the amount of elongation of the tension<br>
bolt 74 (elongated portion 75) with high precision by using the dial gauge 85.<br>
As described above, the amount of elongation of the tension bolt 74 becomes<br>
greater than that of the tension bolt of the conventional example by such an amount that<br>
the elongated portion 75 is longer. For this reason, as for the tension bolt 74, the control<br>
value rnrmc of the amount of elongation of. the lension bolt 74 becomes greater than<br>
before.<br>
Accordingly, since the attention that is needed to control the amount of<br>
elongation during assembling of the tension bolt 74 is more reduced than before, the<br>
operability and operating efficiency of the assembling is improved.<br>
Here, the depth of the housing hole 78 in which a portion of the elongated<br>
portion 75 of the tension bolt 74 (the male thread 76 side) is housed is set to be 10% or<br>
more (for example, 15 mm or more) of the total length of the elongated portion 75 (for<br>
example, 150 mm).<br><br>
13<br>
In other words, the length L of the elongated portion 75 of the tension bolt 74<br>
(for example, 150 mm) is greater than the length LI of the elongated portion of the<br>
conventional tension bolt (for example, 135 mm) by 10% or more.<br>
The length of the portion of the elongated portions 75 of the tension bolt 74 that<br>
is housed in the housing hole 78 (for example, 15 mm) will have an amount of elongation<br>
of 0.01 mm or more when a tensile force is given by a hydraulic tension device during<br>
assembling. Since the amount of elongation of 0.01 mm or more is more than the<br>
measurement resolution of the dial gauge 85, it is possible to reliably measure even the<br>
amount of elongation by the dial gauge 85.<br>
As described above, according to the turbo compressor 1 of the present<br>
embodiment, in the fastening mechanism 70 in which the first impeller 21 and the second<br>
impeller 22 are fastened to both ends of the second rotary shaft 12 of the first rotor 17,<br>
the total length (especially the length L of the elongated portion 75) of the tension bolt 74<br>
is greater than that of the conventional example. Thus, the control value width of the<br>
amount of elongation of the tension bolt 74 during assembling (upper limit of the amount<br>
of elongation - lower limit of the amount of elongation) can be made greater than before.<br>
Accordingly, since the attention that is needed to control the amount of elongation is<br>
more reduced than before, the operability and operating efficiency of the assembling is<br>
improved.<br>
Moreover, a portion of the tension bolt 74 is housed in the housing hole 78<br>
formed at the end face 12a of the second rotary shaft 12. Thus, even if the total length<br>
of the tension bolt 74 is greater then before, the total lenth of a unit in which the first<br>
impeller 21 and the second impeller 22 are fastened to the second rotary shaft 12 can be<br>
made the same as that of the conventional case.<br>
Accordingly, stable operation can be achieved without lowering the critical<br><br>
14<br>
velocity of a rotary shaft. Further, there are advantages in that the shape change of other<br>
members is unnecessary and the cost hardly rises.<br>
FIG. 5 is a sectional view showing a modified example of the fastening<br>
mechanism 90 according to the first embodiment.<br>
The fastening nut 80 is screwed to the male thread 77 of the tension bolt 74 via a<br>
washer 81. This makes it possible to further increase the length L of the elongated<br>
portion 75 of the tension bolt 74. That is, the length L of the elongated portion 75 can<br>
be increased by the thickness of the washer 81.<br>
Accordingly, the operability and operating efficiency of assembling can be<br>
further improved.<br>
[Second Embodiment]<br>
FIG. 6A is a sectional view of a fastening mechanism 90 according to a second<br>
embodiment, and FIG. 6B is a conventional example of a fastening mechanism.<br>
The fastening mechanism 90 fastens both ends of the second rotary shaft 12 to<br>
the first impeller 21 and the second impeller 22, similarly to the fastening mechanism 70<br>
according to the first embodiment.<br>
Hereinafter, only portions different from the fastening mechanism 70 according<br>
to the first embodiment will be described, the same reference numerals are given to the<br>
same portions, and the description thereof is omitted herein.<br>
The fastening mechanism 90 includes a curvic coupling 71 that fastens the<br>
second rotary shaft 12 and the first impeller 21 so that their axes may coincide with each<br>
other, a tension bolt 74 that pinches and supports the second rotary shaft 12 and the first<br>
impeller 21 under predetermined pressure, a fastening nut 80, and the like.<br>
The curvic coupling 71 consists of a curvic toothed portion 72 formed at an end<br>
face 12a of the second rotary shaft 12, and a curvic toothed portion 73 formed at an end<br><br>
15<br>
face 21 a of a protruding portion 2 If that protrudes from the center of a rear face of the<br>
first impeller 21.<br>
The tension bolt 74 consists of the male threads 76 and 77 formed at both ends,<br>
and an elongated portion 75 between the male threads 76 and 77.<br>
The size of the male thread 76 or 77 is, for example, about M12 to M22, and<br>
although the length of the elongated portion 75 is specified according to the length of the<br>
first impeller 21, it is, for example, about 150 mm.<br>
A female thread 79 that is screwed to the male thread 76 of the tension bolt 74 is<br>
formed at the end face 12a of the second rotary shaft 12. When the male thread 76 is<br>
screwed to the female thread 79, the tension bolt 74 is erected perpendicularly to the end<br>
face 12a of the second rotary shaft 12.<br>
Meanwhile, a through-hole 21c for allowing the tension bolt 74 to be inserted<br>
therethrough is formed in the center of rotation (axis) of the first impeller 21. The<br>
through-hole 21c is also formed in the protruding portion 21 f that protrudes from the<br>
center of the rear face of the first impeller 21. That is, a portion of the elongated portion<br>
75 of the tension bolt 74 is housed in the protruding portion 21 f.<br>
The length of the first impeller 21 (distance from the rear central end face 21a to<br>
a front central end face 21b) is made slightly greater than the length of the elongated<br>
portion 75 protruding from the end face 12a of the second rotary shaft 12. Accordingly,<br>
when the tension bolt 74 that is erected perpendicularly to the end face 12a of the second<br>
rotary shaft 12 is inserted through the through-hole 21c of the first impeller 21, the male<br>
thread 77 of the tension bolt 74 protrudes from the front central end face 21b of the first<br>
impeller 21.<br>
Then, the first impeller 21 is fastened to the end face 12a of the second rotary<br>
shaft 12 by fitting the washer 81 onto the male thread 77, and further screwing the<br><br>
16<br>
fastening nut 80 thereto.<br>
In addition, the washer 81 may not be provided.<br>
Also, the length of the protruding portion 21 f that protrudes from the center of<br>
the rear face of the first impeller 21 is set to be 10% or more (for example, 15 mm or<br>
more) of the total length (for example, 150 mm) of the elongated portion 75 of the<br>
tension bolt 74.<br>
By such a configuration, the fastening mechanism 90 can obtain the same effects<br>
as the fastening mechanism 70 according to the first embodiment. That is, since the<br>
total length of the tension bolt 74 (especially the length L of the elongated portion 75) is<br>
greater than that of the conventional example, the control value width of the amount of<br>
elongation of the tension bolt 74 during assembling (upper limit of the amount of<br>
elongation - lower limit of the amount of elongation) can be made greater than before.<br>
Accordingly, since the attention that is needed to control the amount of elongation is<br>
more reduced than before, the operability and operating efficiency of the assembling is<br>
improved.<br>
Further, a portion of the tension bolt 74 is housed in the protruding portion 21f<br>
protruding from the center of the rear face of the first impeller 21, and the length of the<br>
second rotary shaft 12 becomes short by that much. Thus, even if the total length of the<br>
tension bolt 74 is greater than before, the total length of a unit in which the first impeller<br>
21 and the second impeller 22 are fastened to the second rotary shaft 12 can be made the<br>
same as that of the conventional case. Accordingly, there are advantages in that the<br>
shane chanee of other members is unnecessary and the cost hardlv rises-<br>
Here, the operation sequence or various shapes or combinations of respective<br>
constructional members shown in the above-described embodiments are merely<br>
examples, and various changes may be made on the basis of process conditions, design<br><br>
17<br>
requirements, or the like without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.<br>
Although the above-described embodiment has been described for the case<br>
where the turbo compressor 1 is of a so-called uniaxial two-stage type, the invention is<br>
not limited thereto. For example, the turbo compressor may be a so-called biaxial<br>
two-stage type, biaxial three-stage type, a biaxial four-stage type, etc. Further, the<br>
invention can also be applied to a uniaxial one-stage type.<br>
Even if the turbo compressor is of any one of these types, the fastening<br>
mechanisms 70 and 90 can be used as means that fasten a rotary shaft and an impeller of<br>
a rotor.<br>
The number of washers 81 and fastening nuts 80 to the male thread 77 of the<br>
tension bolt 74 can be changed according to design conditions. For example, two<br>
fastening nuts 80 may be attached for prevention of looseness.<br>
Although the dial gauge 85 has been described as a measuring device that<br>
measures the amount of elongation of the tension bolt 74, the invention is not limited<br>
thereto. The measuring device may be a micrometer and a vernier caliper. Further, a<br>
non-contact measuring device, such as a laser length-measuring device, may be used.<br>
Further, although the case where a hydraulic tension device is used has been<br>
described as the method of applying a tensile force to the tension bolt 74, the invention is<br>
not limited thereto. A case where the fastening nut 80 is fastened by a wrench and the<br>
amount of elongation of the tension bolt 74 is measured may be adopted.<br>
Although the case where the curvic coupling 71 is used has been described as a<br>
mechanical joint provided between the second rotary shaft 12, and the first impeller 21 or<br>
second impeller 22, a Hirth coupling, etc. can be used.<br>
Although the preferable embodiments of the invention have been described<br>
hitherto, the invention is not limited to these embodiments. Additions, omissions,<br><br>
18<br>
substitutions, and other alternations of components can be made without departing from<br>
the spirit of the invention. The invention is not limited by the above description and is<br>
limited by only the scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
