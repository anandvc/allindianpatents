PROCESS FOR THE HYDROCYANATION OF UNSATURATED COMPOUNDS<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the hydrocyanation of unsaturated compounds to unsaturated mononitrile compounds or to dinitrile compounds.<br>
It relates more particularly to a process for the manufacture of dinitriles by double hydrocyanation of diolefins, such as butadiene, comprising a recovery and separation of the catalyst system.<br>
The hydrocyanation reaction is used industrially for the synthesis of compounds comprising nitrile functional groups from compounds comprising unsaturations. Thus, adiponitrile, which is an important chemical intermediate, in particular in the manufacture of hexamethylene diamine, a monomer for a number of polymers, such as polyamide, is manufactured by hydrocyanation in two stages of butadiene or of a hydrocarbon cut, known as C4 cut, comprising butadiene. In this manufacturing process, the two reactions are carried out with catalytic systems comprising essentially the same entities, namely an organometallic coordination complex and at least one organophosphorus ligand of monodentate organophosphite type, such as tritolyl phosphite.<br>
Numerous  patents  disclose  this  process  for  the<br>
manufacture  of  adiponitrile  and  processes  for  the<br>
manufacture of the catalysts.<br>
Furthermore, for the economics of the process, it is<br>
important to be able to recover the catalytic system<br>
and to recycle it in the hydrocyanation stages.<br>
Thus, Patent US 4 539 302 discloses a process for the<br>
recovery of  the  catalyst  from the  reaction medium<br>
obtained in the second stage of the process for the<br>
preparation of adiponitrile, namely the hydrocyanation<br>
of unsaturated nitriles to dinitriles.<br><br>
This process for recovery by settling makes it possible to limit the losses of metal element and facilitates the control of the organophosphorus ligand/metal element ratio for the hydrocyanation of unsaturated nitriles. Thus, it is also possible to recover a catalytic system with a high ligand/metal element ratio which makes possible recycling and reuse of the catalytic system in the stages for the manufacture of catalyst and/or in the stages of hydrocyanation of butadiene or the isomerization of branched pentenenitriles.<br>
Numerous other organophosphorus ligands have been provided for the catalysis of these hydrocyanation reactions.<br>
Thus, bidentate ligands of organophosphite, organophosphinite, organophosphonite and organo-phosphine type have been disclosed in numerous patents, such as, for example, Patents WO 99/06355, WO 99/06356, WO 99/063 57, WO 99/06358, WO 99/52632, WO 99/65506, WO 99/62855, US 5 693 843, WO 96/1182, WO 96/22968, US 5 981 772, WO 01/36429, WO 99/64155 or WO 02/13964.<br>
Finally, provision has also been made, in patent WO 03/11457, to use a mixture of mono- and bidentate ligands for the catalysis of hydrocyanation reactions.<br>
In the case of mixtures of ligands, it is also important to be able to recover the catalyst without losing ligands or metal element.<br>
One of- the aims of the present invention is to provide a process for the manufacture of dinitriles by hydrocyanation of unsaturated compounds using a catalytic system comprising a mixture of monodentate organophosphite ligands and of bidentate organophosphorus ligands which makes possible separation and recovery of the catalyst and of various<br><br>
products with minimum loss of compounds forming the catalytic system.<br>
To this end, the invention provides a process for the manufacture of dinitriles by hydrocyanation of unsaturated compounds comprising at least one stage of hydrocyanation in the presence of a catalytic system comprising an organometallic complex formed by one or more organophosphorus ligands of monodentate organophosphite type and one or more bidentate organophosphorus ligands and optionally a promoter of Lewis acid type and at least one stage of separation by distillation of a reactant used in the process or of a compound formed by the reaction from a medium comprising the said catalytic system, characterized in that the medium subjected to the stage of separation by distillation comprises a ratio of the number of moles of monodentate and bidentate organophosphorus ligands, expressed as phosphorus atoms, with respect to the number of metal element atoms of less than or equal to 15 and/or a concentration by weight of metal element forming the organometallic complex of less than or equal to 1.3%, and in that the distillation bottom temperature of the distillation stage is less than or equal to 180°C.<br>
The term "distillation bottom temperature" is understood to mean the temperature of the medium present in the boiler of the distillation plant and the temperature of the walls of the boiler.<br>
The distillation conditions and in particular the maximum temperature of the walls of the boiler make it possible to limit and even to eliminate the precipitation of the metal element forming the organometallic complex. This is because a higher temperature can bring about decomplexing of the catalyst, resulting in the precipitation of the metal element, during the separation or distillation stage.<br><br>
The metal elements exhibiting a catalytic effect in a hydrocyanation reaction are, for example, nickel, cobalt, iron, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, platinum, copper, silver, gold, zinc, cadmium or cerium. Nickel is the preferred catalytic element. For greater clarity, the metal element will be denoted by the term "nickel" in the continuation of the present text, without this having a limiting meaning.<br>
Mention may be made, as monodentate organophosphite ligands which are suitable for the invention, by way of examples, of triphenyl phosphite, tritolyl phosphite (TTP) or tricymenyl phosphite.<br>
Mention may be made, as bidentate ligands which are suitable for the invention, of organophosphite, organophosphonite, organophosphinite or organophosphine compounds and in particular of those with the following structures, in which Ph means phenyl:<br><br><br><br>
According to a preferred characteristic of the invention, the catalytic system present in the reaction medium generally comprises a number of moles of bidentate ligands, expressed as the number of phosphorus atoms with respect to a metal element atom, of between 1 and 4 (limits included) , while that of monodentate ligands, expressed as the number of phosphorus atoms, is between 4 and 12 (limits included).<br>
These ratios can be different according to the hydrocyanation reaction carried out. This is because the manufacture of dinitriles is generally carried out in two successive stages consisting, in a first stage, in hydrocyanating a diolefin, such as butadiene, with HCN to give unsaturated mononitriles and, in a second stage, in converting these mononitriles to dinitriles by reaction with HCN. Furthermore, the process generally comprises a stage of isomerization of the branched unsaturated mononitriles obtained from the first  stage  in  order  to  convert  them  to  linear<br><br>
mononitriles which will be converted to linear dinitriles in the second stage.<br>
Thus, the ligand/nickel ratio used in the first stage is generally higher than that used in the second stage. Likewise, the concentration of nickel can be different in the two stages.<br>
Furthermore, in the reaction for the hydrocyanation of the unsaturated nitriles or second stage, a promoter or cocatalyst is generally used. Lewis acids are generally chosen as preferred promoters.<br>
Use may in particular be made, by way of examples, of the  Lewis  acids  mentioned  in  the  work  edited  by G.A. Olah  "Friedel-Crafts  and  Related  Reactions", volume I, pages 191 to 197 (1963).<br>
The Lewis acids which can be employed as cocatalysts in the present process are advantageously chosen from compounds of the elements from Groups lb, lib, Ilia, 11 lb, IVa, IVb, Va, Vb, VIb, VI lb and VI11 of the Periodic Table of the Elements. These compounds are generally salts, in particular halides, such as chlorides or bromides, sulphates, sulphonates, haloalkylsulphonates, perhaloalkylsulphonates, in particular fluoroalkylsulphonates or perfluoroalkyl-sulphonates, haloacetates, perhaloacetates, carb-oxylates and phosphates.<br>
Mention may be made, as nonlimiting examples of such Lewis acids, of zinc chloride, zinc bromide, zinc iodide, manganese chloride, manganese bromide, cadmium chloride, cadmium bromide, stannous chloride, stannous bromide, stannous sulphate, stannous tartrate, indium chloride, indium trifluoromethylsulphonate, indium trifluoroacetate, chlorides or bromides of rare earth elements, such as lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium,  hafnium,  erbium,  thulium,  ytterbium and<br><br>
lutetium, cobalt chloride, ferrous chloride or yttrium chloride.<br>
Use may also be made, as Lewis acid, of compounds such as triphenylborane or titanium tetraisopropoxide.<br>
It  is,  of  course,  possible  to  employ mixtures  of<br>
several Lewis acids.<br>
Preference  is  very particularly given,  among  Lewis<br>
acids,  to  zinc  chloride,  zinc  bromide,  stannous<br>
chloride,  stannous  bromide,  triphenylborane,  indium<br>
trifluoromethylsulphonate,  indium trifluoroacetate and<br>
zinc chloride/stannous chloride mixtures.<br>
The Lewis acid cocatalyst employed generally represents<br>
from 0.005 to 50 mol per mole of nickel.<br>
In each of these stages, the reaction medium obtained after the hydrocyanation reaction is advantageously subjected to separation by distillation of the unreacted reactant, namely butadiene or the unsaturated nitrile, in order to be recycled.<br>
According to invention, these separation stages are carried out while observing a distillation bottom temperature according to the conditions of ligand/nickel ratio and nickel concentration indicated above in order to avoid or limit decomplexing of the nickel and its precipitation.<br>
According to preferred characteristics of the invention, the total ligand/nickel ratio, expressed as number of phosphorus atoms with respect to the number of nickel atoms, is preferably less than or equal to 15, advantageously between 5 and 15, the concentration by weight of nickel advantageously being between 0.1% and 2%, preferably between 0.1% and 1.2% (limits included).<br><br>
The term "total ligand" is understood to mean all the molecules of monodentate and bidentate ligands. In the present text, the expression "ligand/nickel" also relates to the ratio of all the molecules of mono- and bidentate ligands with respect to the number of nickel atoms, unless expressly indicated otherwise.<br>
Thus, in the case of the separation of butadiene or C4 petroleum cut by distillation of the reaction medium resulting from the first hydrocyanation stage, the maximum temperature of the distillation bottoms is less than or equal to 180°C for a ratio of moles of bidentate ligand, expressed as phosphorus atoms, to the number of nickel atoms of between 1 and 4 (limits included) and that of the monodentate ligand of between 4 and 12 (limits included) . In addition, according to a preferred characteristic of the invention, the concentration by weight of nickel is greater than or equal to 0.1%, advantageously greater than 0.2%.<br>
Likewise, in the stage of separation of the unsaturated nitriles from the medium resulting from the second stage of hydrocyanation of the unsaturated nitriles, the distillation bottom temperature is advantageously less than or equal to 140°C for a ratio of moles of bidentate ligand, expressed as phosphorus atoms, to the number of nickel atoms of between 1 and 4 (limits included) and that of the monodendate ligand of between 4 and 7 (limits included). In addition, according to a preferred characteristic of the invention, the concentration by weight of nickel is greater than or equal to 0.2%.<br>
Furthermore, in one embodiment, the process of the invention can comprise a stage of extraction of the organometallic complex and of the organophosphorus ligands from the medium comprising the nitriles and in particular the dinitriles by liquid/liquid extraction us ing an ext ract ion solvent. Ment ion may be made, as<br><br>
suitable extraction solvent, by way of examples, of saturated, linear or cyclic, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane, cyclopentane, cycloheptane and more generally cycloparaffins or analogues. Cyclohexane is the preferred extraction solvent.<br>
The solution of ligands and of organometallic complex in the extraction solvent is also subjected to distillation in order to separate the extraction solvent and to recycle the ligands and the organometallic complex thus recovered. In the present invention, the extraction solvent is a reactant used for the implementation of the process.<br>
This separation is also carried out while observing the characteristics of the invention indicated above, such as ligand/nickel ratio, concentration of nickel and distillation bottom temperature.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, this separation of the cyclohexane is carried out with a distillation bottom temperature of less than or equal to 18 0°C for a concentration by weight of nickel of greater than or equal to 0.7%. In addition, according to a preferred characteristic of the invention, the ratio of moles of bidentate ligand, expressed as phosphorus atoms, to the number of nickel atoms is between 1 and 4 (limits included) and that of the monodentate ligand is greater than or equal to 8.<br>
According to the invention, in the stages of separation by distillation starting from a medium comprising the catalytic system, the maximum temperature of the distillation bottoms is determined and is a function of the ligand/nickel ratio and of the concentration of nickel in the medium. Thus, this temperature increases as the ligand/nickel ratio increases and/or as the concentration of nickel increases.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the process comprises a stage of separation of the catalytic system and of the dinitriles carried out in a stage of settling into two dense and light phases. The medium fed to this settling stage is either the medium obtained after the second hydrocyanation stage or the distillation bottoms obtained in the stage of separation of the unreacted unsaturated nitriles.<br>
Thus, the lower or dense phase comprises most of the nickel and of the bidentate ligand and a portion of the monodentate ligand, the upper or light phase being composed of the dinitriles and the remaining portion of the nickel and of the mono- and bidentate ligands.<br>
The medium fed to the settling stage is advantageously cooled  to  a  temperature  of  between  25  and  75 °C, preferably between 30 and 55°C.<br>
According to another characteristic of the process of the invention, the upper phase recovered in the settling stage comprises a ligand/nickel molar ratio advantageously of greater than 8.<br>
According to the invention, the total recovery of the metal complex and of the ligands is carried out by liquid/liquid extraction of these using an extraction solvent which is immiscible with the dinitriles. This operation corresponds to that described above, the solvents being identical.<br>
In this embodiment, it is advantageous, prior to the stage of distillation of the unreacted unsaturated nitriles, to adjust and to control the concentration of nickel in the medium by addition of a portion of the lower or dense phase recovered in the settling stage.<br><br>
This is because the concentration of nickel used in the hydrocyanation medium, when the nickel is used in combination with a bidentate ligand in accordance with the process of the invention, can be very low, such as, for example, of the order of 100 to 2000 mg of nickel/kg of reaction medium. In order to obtain a concentration of nickel suitable for promoting the settling, it may be necessary to add a certain amount of catalytic system to the reaction medium exiting from the hydrocyanation stage. This adjustment to the concentration of nickel can be made as indicated above.<br>
The process of the invention thus makes possible recovery and separation of the catalyst with a loss of metal element and thus of catalyst which is minimized.<br>
The present invention preferably applies to the hydrocyanation of butadiene and of linear or branched unsaturated nitriles comprising from 3 to 8 carbon atoms and more preferably of 3-pentenenitrile and/or 4-pentenenitrile for the production of adiponitrile with use of a catalyst of the type represented by the following formula:<br>
Ni(Li)x(L2)y in which Li represents a monodentate ligand and L2 a bidentate ligand,<br>
x and y represent decimal numbers ranging from 0 to 4, the sum x © 2y being equal to 3 or 4-.<br>
The catalyst can be composed of a mixture of complexes corresponding to the above general formula.<br>
The catalytic system or the reaction medium can also comprise an amount of mono- and/or bidentate organophosphorus ligand in the free form, that is to say not bonded to the nickel. The catalytic systems of the invention can be obtained by formation, in a first stage, of an organometallic complex between the nickel and monodentate ligand. Processes for the formation of<br><br>
such complexes are, for example, disclosed in patents US 3 903 120 and US 4 416 825.<br>
In a second stage, the bidentate ligand is added to the medium comprising the said organometallic complex.<br>
The first and second hydrocyanation stages are advantageously carried out in series. In this case, it is advantageous for at least a portion of the catalyst recovered, in part icular that recovered in the liquid/liquid extraction, and more particularly the catalyst recovered in the upper phase of the settling stage, to be recycled and used as catalyst in the first stage of hydrocyanation of butadiene and/or in the stage of isomerization of branched unsaturated nitriles to linear unsaturated nitriles. The use of an identical or similar catalytic system for the hydrocyanation of butadiene and that of pentenenitriles is preferred.<br>
However, it is also possible to use the catalytic system described above solely in the stage of hydrocyanation of unsaturated nitriles, the catalytic system used in the first stage of hydrocyanation of butadiene and the isomerization stage being different, in the nature of the compounds.<br>
Other details and advantages of the invention will become more clearly apparent in the light of the examples given below solely by way of illustration.<br>
