				<td>PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OP CYCLIC CARBONATE Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of cyclic carbonates. More particularly the present invention relates to the a process of cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxide using cata!&gt;'tic system consists of Zinc-substituted-polyoxometalate catalyst and a Lewis base with very high turn over number. The present invention involves a new catalytic system comprising of Zinc- substituted polyoxometalate and a Lewis base such as dimethyl aminopyridine for production of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and carbon dioxide. More particularly, the present invention involves inexpensive catalyst system for the above said reaction with very high turn over number and also the catalyst can be reusable. Background of the invention<br>
Carbon dioxode is inexpensive, highly abundant and can be used as a Ci feed stock for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates, polycarbonates etc. These transformations are attractive processes from the view of point "green chemistry" because CO2, a global warming gas, can be incorporated without any side product and also it is a renewable C1 source. Organic cyclic carbonates have been widely used as monomers, aprotic organic solvents, pharmaceutical/fine chemical intermediates, electrolytic components, chemical intermediates etc. and are also useful in many biomedical applications. Cyclic carbonates are also used to synthesis dialkyl carbonates which are of industrial importance for many potential applications.<br>
Several catalytic materials including amines, phosphines, metal oxides have been reported in the recent years for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from CO2. Transition metal ion based catalysts in conjunction with a Lewis base have been reported to be efficient for the CO2 fixation reaction. A substantial number of patents and articles are available in the literature which describe production of alkylene carbonates from alkylene oxides and carbon dioxide. For example, Japanese patent, JP 47-31981 discloses the synthesis of alkylene carbonates from an epoxide and carbon dioxide in the presence of a Lewis acid (e.g ZnCI2, AICI3 etc) and an organic base, and the process was carried out at 100-400 °C and 19.6-294 bar CO2 pressure with 90 % yield. Japanese patent, JP 51-13,720 discloses sim.ilar catalyst system where the temperature was 80-130 °C and the pressure was less than 70.9 bar with approximately 90 % yield. Chinese patent, CN1343668A by Deng et al teaches the process   for  synthesizing  cyclic  carbonate  by  catalyst  composed  of azacyclic<br>
compound, non-metal halide and alkali metal halide or ammonium tetrabutyl bromide<br>
at temperature 100-140-0C-and 1.5-4.5 MPa pressure.			<br>
(us Patent 2003/0023109Ar\by gchlosberg et al and WO 03/000641 Al by     ' Buchanan et al describe integrated process for preparation of dialkyl carabonates where the first step involves synthesis of cyclic carbonates using halogen free alkyl ammonium salt catalysts at temperature 100-200 °C and CO2 pressure upto 1000 psig. U.S. patent 2773070 by Lichtenwalter et al discloses reaction of alkylene oxides with carbon dioxide in the presence of certain class of ammonium halides where the process was operated at 100-225 °C and pressure of more than 300 psig. U.S. Patent 2,873,282 by McCellan at al used catalyst comprised of hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonates of quaternary ammonium compounds and the process operates at 1000-1500 psig and at 150-175 °C. U.S. Patent 5,153,333 by Schubert et al discloses a process of preparing 2-oxo-l,3-dioxolanes comprises of reacting an epoxy compound with carbon dioxide at 60-200 °C at normal pressure in the presence of a quaternary phosphonium compound as catalyst. Japanese patent JP1975000077840 describes preparation of cyclic carbonates from epoxide and CO2 in good yield using a Grignard reagent and a N-containing compound. Russian patent RU2128658C1 by Dobyleva et al discloses a method of preparation of cyclic carbonates with a cobalt halide catalyst at temperature 130-150 C and pressure of 1-1.5 MPa.<br>
Though good conversion and selectivity have been achieved as reported in the literature, most of the reported catalytic systems carry at least one of the following disadvantages: (1) need for high concentration of catalyst, (2) instability of catalyst, (3) air-sensitivity, (4) need for co-solvent, (5) requirement of higher temperature/pressure, (6) difficulty in separating the catalyst after the reaction for reuse etc. So efficient catalyst composite operating at milder experimental conditions preferably without need for any organic solvents but with very high turn over number is of great interest. Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of cyclic carbonates which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to carry out above reaction under milder experimental conditions with short duration time and without any solvent.<br>

A catalytic system comprising of Zinc-substituted polyoxometalate, Na,2[WZn3(H2O)2(ZnW9O34)2]-48H2O and a Lewis base has been found to be efficient for chemical fixation of CO2 with epoxides (I) to form cyclic carbonates of structure II given below: (Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is halogen atom, aliphatic or aromatic groups. The reaction was carried out at moderate CO2 pressure of 60 psig and in the temperature range 100-140° C with very high turn number of more than 40.000. with nearly a quantitative conversion and 95-99 % selectivity. The Zinc-substituted polyoxometalate catalyst is easy to separate after the reaction by filtration and reusable for many cycles. The reaction can be carried out without any solvent.<br>
In a feature of the present invention, the process of invention can be carried out with short reaction time of three hours especially at temperatures 140°C with high conversion and selectivity and with very high turn over numbers. In another feature of the present invention, only very small amount of catalyst is required.<br>
Process of the present invention is described herein below with reference to illustrative examples and should not be considered to limit the scope of present invention in any manner. EXAMPLE 1<br>
This is an example of preparation in which a solution of Na2W04.2H20 (127 g, 0.38 moi) in water (350 cm3) heated at 80-85 °C and vigorously stirred, treated with 14 mol dm"-3 nitric acid (25 cm3, 0.35 mol) until the precipitate formed dissolved entirely, then, a solution of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (29.8 g, 0.10 mol) in water (100 cm3) was added with continuous stirring and heating at 90-95 ° C. The solution is filtered and recrystallized from water.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
This is an example of a typical reaction in which a stainless steel autoclave equipped with over head stirrer and gas inlet, outlet pipes and pressure gauge charged with 0.0027 mmol of Zinc-substituted polyoxometalate, 3 moles equivalent dimethyl aminopyrdine, hexadecane (internal standard for GC analysis), uifforent mmol equivalents of epichlrohydrine (epoxide) as given in Table (1) herein below and 10 ml of CH2CI2. After purging with CO2, the reaction mixture was pressurized to 60 psig and heated to temperature 100 °C. The overhead stirring speed was around 400 rpm. The course of the reaction was monitored by taking samples repeatedly, and determining the residual content as well as the cyclic carbonate formation by GC, IR, NMR and GC-MS. The reaction is completed at 24 hrs at this temperature except for the 135 mmol equivalent epoxide reaction where the completion of reaction needed nearly 29 hrs. During the entire course of the reaction selectivity remains more than 95 %. Quantification of the product by mass balance yield is always 2-5 % less than calculated from GC and NMR, preferably due to loss during handling and part of the product sticking to the wall of the autoclave.

EXAMPLE 3<br>
This is an example of a typical reaction in which a stainless steel autoclave equipped with over head stirrer and gas inlet, outlet pipes and pressure gauge charged with 0.0027 mmol of Zinc-substituted polyoxometalate catalyst, 3 moles equivalent dimethyl aminopyridine, hexadecane (internal standard for GC analysis), 27 mmol equivalent of epichlorohydrine (epoxide) and 10 ml of CH2CI2. After purging with CO2, the reaction mixture was pressurized to 60 psig and heated to different temperature range 100-150 °C and the results are as given in Table (2) herein below. The course of the reaction was monitored by repeatedly taking samples and determining the residual content as well as the cyclic carbonate formation by GC, IR, NMR and GC-MS. The time required for complete epoxide conversion decreases with increasing temperature.<br>

(Table  Removed)<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
This is an example of a typical reaction in which a stainless steel autoclave equipped with over head stirrer and gas inlet, outlet pipes and pressure gauge charged with 0.0027 mmol of Zinc-substituted polyoxometalate catalyst, 3 moles equivalent dimethylamino pyridine, hexadecane (internal standard for GC analysis), 27 mmol equivalent of epichlorohydrine (epoxide) and 10 ml of CH2CI2. After purging with CO2, the reaction mixture was pressurized to different pressure range 60-150 psig and heated to 140°C. It was discovered that conversion and selectivity are independent of carbon dioxide pressure in the range 60-150 psig. EXAMPLE 5<br>
This is an example to check the role of the Zinc-substituted polyoxometalate catalyst and the Lewis base, wherein the experiments are carried out in a stainless steel autoclave equipped with over head stirrer and gas inlet, outlet pipes and pressure gauge. Three experiments are carried out: (i) in the absence of Zinc-substituted polyoxometalate, (ii) in the absence of Lewis base and (iii) in the absence of both Zinc-substituted polyoxometalate and the Lewis base, and the results are given in Table (3) herein below. It is observed that both experiments (i) and (ii) proceeded only upto 49 and 65 % conversion respectively. The partial conversion probably indicates their roles in the activation of CO2 and epoxide. In the absence of both Zinc-substituted polyoxometalate catalyst and dimethyl aminopyridine, the conversion is very low. However, the coexistence of Zinc-substituted polyoxometalate catalyst and the base seems to be important for the high activity in promoting the cycloaddition reactions. Table (3)<br>

polyoxometalate after the first reaction is completed. Aftei the coinplclion of the<br>
reaction,   the   reaction   mixture   was   centrifuged   and   the   Zinc-substituted<br>

of the reaction was monitored by repeatedly taking samples and determining the<br>
residual content as well as the cyclic carbonate formation by GC, IR, f JMR and GC-<br>
MS and the results at the end of three hours are given in Table (5) herein below. The<br>
selectivity and conversion were as good as the fresh reaction. Such a cycle is repeated<br>
thrice and found that the conversion is bit low only after second use though the<br>
selectivity remains very high (more than 98 %).<br>
