				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a substituted hydantoin compounds for the treatment of obstructive airway diseases, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy.<br>
Metalloproteinases are a superfamily of proteinases (enzymes) whose numbers in recent years have increased dramatically. Based on structural and functional considerations these enzymes have been classified into families and subfamilies as described in N. M. Hooper (1994) FFBS Letters 354:1-6. Examples of metalloproteinases include the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as the collagenases (MMP1, MMP8, MMP13), the gelatinases (MMP2, MMP9), the stromelysins (MMP3, MMP10, MMP11), matrilysin (MMP7), metalloelastase (MMP12). enamelysin (MMP19), the MT-MMPs (MMP14, MMP15, MMP16, MMP17); the reprolysin or adamalysin or MDC family which includes the secretases and sheddases such as TNF converting enzymes (ADAM 10 and TACE); the astacin family which include enzymes such as procollagen processing proteinase (PCP); and other metalloproteinases such as aggrecanase, the endothelin converting enzyme family and the angiotensin converting enzyme family.<br>
Metalloproteinases are believed to be important in a plethora of physiological disease processes that involve tissue remodelling such as embryonic development, bone formation and uterine remodelling during menstruation. This is based on the ability of the metalloproteinases to cleave a broad range of matrix substrates such as collagen, proteoglycan and fibroncctin. Metalloproteinases are also believed to be important in the processing, or secretion, of biological important cell mediators, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF); and the post translational proteolysis processing, or shedding, of biologically important membrane proteins, such as the low affinity IgE receptor CD23 (for a more complete list see N. M. Hooper et al, (1997) Biochem. J. 321:265-279).<br>
Metalloproteinases have been associated with many diseases or conditions. Inhibition of the activity of one or more metalloproteinases may well be of benefit in these diseases or conditions, for example: various inflammatory and allergic diseases such as, inflammation of the joint (especially rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and gout), inflammation of the <br>
gastro-intestinal tract (especially inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and gastritis), inflammation of the skin (especially psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis); in tumour metastasis or invasion; in disease associated with uncontrolled degradation of the extracellular matrix such as osteoarthritis; in bone resorptive disease (such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease); in diseases associated with aberrant angiogenesis; the enhanced collagen remodelling associated with diabetes, periodontal disease (such as gingivitis), corneal ulceriation, ulceratibn of the slati, post-opera^<br>
anastomosis) and dermal wound healing; demyelinating diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems (such as multiple sclerosis); Alzheimer's disease; extracellular matrix remodelling observed in cardiovascular diseases such as restenosis and atheroscelerosis; asthma; rhinitis; and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD).<br>
MMP12, also known as macrophage elastase or metalloelastase, was initially cloned in the mouse by Shapiro et al [1992, Journal of Biological Chemistry 267: 4664] and in man by the same group in 1995. MMP12 is preferentially expressed in activated macrophages, and has been shown to be secreted from alveolar macrophages from smokers [Shapiro et al, 1993, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 268:23824] as well as in foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions [Matsumoto et al, 1998, Am. J. Pathol. 153: 109]. A mouse model of COPD is based on challenge of mice with cigarette smoke for six months, two cigarettes a day six days a week. Wild-type mice developed pulmonary emphysema after this treatment. When MMP12 knock-out mice were tested in this model they developed no significant emphysema, strongly indicating that MMP12 is a key enzyme in the COPD pathogenesis. The role of MMPs such as MMP12 in COPD (emphysema and bronchitis) is discussed in Anderson and Shinagawa, 1999, Current Opinion in Anti-inflammatory and Immunomodulatory Investigational Drugs 1(1); 29-38. It was recently discovered that smoking increases macrophage infiltration and macrophage-derived MMP-12 expression in human carotid artery plaques Kangavari [Matetzky S, Fishbein MC et al., Circulation 102:(18) 36-39 Suppl. S, Oct 31,2000].<br>
MMP9 (Gelatinase B; 92kDa TypelV Collagenase; 92kDa Gelatinase) is a secreted protein which was first purified, then cloned and sequenced, in 1989 [S.M. Wilhelm et al (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264 (29): 17213-17221; published erratum in J. Biol. Chem. (1990) 265<br><br>
(36): 22570],  A recent review of MMP9 provides an excellent source for detailed information and references on this protease: T.H. Vu &amp; Z. Werb (1998) (In : Matrix Metalloproteinases, 1998, edited by W.C. Parks &amp; R.P. Mecham, pp. 115 - 148, Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-545090-7). The following points are drawn from that review by T.H. Vu &amp; Z. Werb (1998).<br>
The expression of MMP9 is restricted'riorrnallyto a few cell types, including trophoblasts, osteoclasts, neutrophils and macrophages. However, the expression can be induced in these same cells and in other cell types by several mediators, including exposure of the cells to growth factors or cytokines. These are the same mediators often implicated in initiating an inflammatory response. As with other secreted MMPs, MMP9 is released as an inactive Pro-enzyme which is subsequently cleaved to form the enzymatically active enzyme. The proteases required for this activation in vivo are not known. The balance of active MMP9 versus inactive enzyme is further regulated in vivo by interaction with TJMP-1 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases -1), .a naturally-occurring protein. TIMP-1 binds to the C-terminal region of MMP9, leading to inhibition of the catalytic domain of MMP9. The balance of induced expression of ProMMP9, cleavage of Pro- to active MMP9 and the presence of TIMP-1 combine to determine the amount of catalytically active MMP9 which is present at a local site. Proteolytically active MMP9 attacks substrates which include gelatin, elastin, and native Type IV and Type V collagens; it has no activity against native Type I collagen, proteoglycans or laminins.<br>
There has been a growing body of data implicating roles for MMP9 in various physiological and pathological processes. Physiological roles include the invasion of embryonic trophoblasts through the uterine epithelium in the early stages of embryonic implantation; some role in the growth and development of bones; and migration of inflammatory cells from the vasculature into tissues.<br>
MMP9 release, measured using enzyme immunoassay, was significantly enhanced in fluids and in AM supernatants from untreated asthmatics compared with those from other populations [Am. J. Resp. Cell &amp; Mol. Biol., Nov 1997,17 (5).583-591]. Also, increased MMP9 expression has been observed in certain other pathological conditions, thereby<br><br>
implicating MMP9 in disease processes such as COPD, arthritis, tumour metastasis, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and plaque rupture in atherosclerosis leading to acute coronary conditions such as myocardial infarction.<br>
A number of metalloproteinase inhibitors are known (see for example the reviews of MMP inhibitors by Beckett R.P. and Whittaker M., 1998, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, 8(3):259-282, and by Whittakef M.et'al,' 199'9,"Chemical'Reviews'99(9):2735-2776).<br>

wherein R2 is as defined in formula (I); or b)   <br>
(Formula Removed) <br>

wherein R is as defined in formula (I), R is H or a suitable protecting group and X is a<br>
leaving group such as halide or inflate; with an acerylenic compound of formula (IX)<br>

wherein R represents H or trimethylsilyl, R is as defined in formula (I) and R represents<br>
H or a suitable protecting group; with an aryl halide or triflate of formula (VI)<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is as defined in formula (I) and X represents halide or triflate; and optionally thereafter forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
In the above process (a), suitable leaving groups L1 include halo, particularly chloro. The<br>
reaction is preferably performed in a suitable solvent optionally in the presence of an added base for a suitable period of time, typically 0.5 to 24 h, at ambient to reflux temperature. Typically solvents such as pyridine, dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile or dichloromethane are used. When used, the added base may be an organic base such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine or pyridine, or an inorganic base such as an alkali metal carbonate. The reaction is typically conducted at ambient temperature for 0.5 to 16 h, or until completion of the reaction has been achieved, as determined by chromatographic or spectroscopic methods. Reactions of sulfonyl halides with various primary and secondary amines are well known in the literature, and the variations of the conditions will be evident for those skilled in the art<br>
Sulfonylchlorides of formula (33) (wherein L represents chlorine) are conveniently prepared by oxidative chlorination of compounds of formula (IV)<br><br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
using methods that will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art (Mosher, J., J. Org. Chem. 1958. 23,1257; Griffith, O., J. Biol Chem. 1983.258, (3), 1591; WO 02/074767).<br>
Compounds of formula (III) can be prepared by various methods described in the literature or variations thereon as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art of synthetic organic chemistry. Suitable methods include, but are not limited to, those described below and are shown in Scheme 1."<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Scheme 1<br>
In Scheme 1, PG represents a suitable protecting group such as t-Boc; X represents a leaving group such as a halide or a triflate; R represents hydrogen or trimethylsilyl; tms represents trimethylsilyl; Ar represents a 5-pyrimidinyl ring substituted at the 2-position by<br>
R ; and R is as defined in formula (I).<br>
The reaction between the aryl- or vinyl derivative [(V) or (VI)] and an acetylene [(VII), (VIII) or (IX)] can be accomplished, optionally in a suitable solvent, using a catalyst such as a suitable palladium salt, for example, PdCl2(PPh3)2, with/or without an added copper salt and with an amine base such as piperidine, triethylamine, diisopropylamine or diisopropylethylamine. When used, the added solvent may be, for example, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile orN,N-dimethylformamide. The reaction is conducted at "ambient'to reflux temperature" 'for"20 "minutes to several hours "until chromatographic or spectroscopic methods indicate completion of the reaction. Palladium catalysed reactions involving acetylenic compounds are well known in the literature, and variations of the conditions will be evident for those skilled in the art. General methodology of this type is described in, for example, Brandsma, L., Synthesis of Acetylenes, Allenes and Cumulenes: Methods and Techniques, 2004, Elsiever Academic Press, chapter 16, pages 293-317; Transition Metals-Catalysed Couplings of Acetylenes with sp2-halides, Sonogashira, K., J. Organomet. Chem., 2002, 653,46-49; Tykwinski, R. R., Angew, Chem. Int.Ed., 2003,42, 1566-1568.<br>
The vinyl inflate (V) wherein X is O-triflate and PG is t-Boc can be prepared as described in the literature (Wustrow, D. J., Synthesis, 1991,993-995).<br>
Suitable substituted pyrimidinyl halides or Inflates of formula (VI) can be prepared by various methods described in the literature, for example, Budesinsky, Z. et al., Coll. Czech. Chem. Commun., 1949,14,223-235; Takahashi et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull, 1958, 6,334-337; US 4,558,039.<br>
The acetylenic compound (VIII) can be prepared from the triflate (V) via a palladium catalysed coupling reaction with trimethylsilylacetylene followed by, if necessary, deprotection of the trimethylsilyl group .using, for example, potassium fluoride in a suitable solvent. Alternatively, preparation of compound (VIII) wherein R is H and PG is t-Boc can be accomplished by dehydrating a compound of formula (VII), for example, by mesylation followed by treatment with a suitable base, for example, diisopropylethylamine.<br><br>
Acetylenic heteroaryl compounds of formula (IX) can be prepared by various methods described in the literature.<br>
In process (b), the reactions are carried out using methods similar to those described above for the preparation of compounds of formula (VIII). If necessary, one nitrogen in the<br>
hydantoin ring of compounds of formula (X) can be protected using SEMC1 (R = SEM)<br>
before the palladium catalysed reaction is performed. Compounds of formula (X) can be prepared by acid catalysed deprotection of compounds of formula (V) (PG = t-Boc), followed by reaction with a compound of formula (II), in the same way as described above for the preparation of compounds of formula (I).<br>
In process (c), the reactions are carried out in a similar manner to those described above for the preparation of compounds of formula (VIII). If necessary, one nitrogen of the<br>
hydantoin ring of compounds of formula (XI) can be protected using SEMC1 (R = SEM)<br>
before the palladium catalysed reaction is performed Compound (XI) is conveniently prepared from compound (VIII) wherein R is trimethylsilyl and PG is t-Boc by acid catalysed removal of the t-Boc group (for example, using acetyl chloride in methanol), followed by reaction with a compound of formula (II), as described above for the reaction between compounds of formulae (II) and (III).<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that inthe processes of the present invention certain potentially reactive functional groups such as hydroxyl or amino groups in the starting reagents or intermediate compounds may need to be protected by suitable protecting groups. Thus, the preparation of the compounds of the invention may involve, at various stages, the addition and removal of one or more protecting groups.<br>
Suitable protecting groups and details of processes for adding and removing such groups are described in 'Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry', edited by J.W.F. McOmie, Plenum Press (1973) and Trotective Groups in Organic Synthesis', 3rd edition, T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience (1999).<br><br>
The compounds of the invention and intermediates thereto may be isolated from their reaction mixtures and, if necessary further purified, by using standard techniques.<br>
The present invention will now be further explained by reference to the following illustrative examples.<br>

[Fluorescenceplus inhibitor - Fluorescencebackground] divided by the [Fluorescenceminus inhibitor -Fluorescencebackground].<br>
Protein Binding<br>
Plasma protein binding was determined by ultrafiltration in an automated 96 well format assay. On each test occasion the plasma protein binding of a reference compound (budesonide) was monitored in parallel.<br>
Test compounds (10 mM dissolved in DMSO) were added to plasma to a final concentration of 10 µM and equilibrated at room temperature for 10 minutes. 350 µL of<br><br>
the plasma was transferred to an ultraftltration plate, Microcon-96 (lOkDa cutoff, Millipore). The ultrafiltration plate was centrifuged at 3000G for 70 minutes at room temperature. After centrifugation, the concentration of the compounds in the obtained plasma water (the unbound fraction) was determined by LC-MS/MS using a 3-point calibration curve and compared to the concentration in the original spiked plasma.<br>
The analyses' were'performed using'a" gradient chromatographic system with acetic acid/acetonitrile as mobile phases. The detection was done using a triple quadropole mass spectrometer, API3000 or API4000, from Applied Biosystems, with an electrospray interface.<br>
Protocol for Determination of Solubility<br>
The solubility of test compounds in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was determined as follows:<br>
The test compound (1 mg) was weighed into a 2 mL glass vial with a screw cap and 0.1M phosphate buffer pH 7.4. (1.00 mL) was added. The sample vial was then sonicated for about 10 minutes and then placed on a shake board overnight at 20 °C. The contents of the sample vial were then filtered through a Millipore Millex-LH 0.45 µm filter into a new 2 mL glass vial to give a clear solution. The clear solution (40 uL) was transferred to a new 2 mL glass vial and diluted with 0.1M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (960 uL).<br>
A standard calibration curve for each particular test compound was established using solutions of known concentration. These solutions of known concentration were normally chosen to have concentrations of ~10 µg/mL and -50 µg/rnL. They were prepared by dissolving a known weight of the compound in 99.5 % ethanol (500 uL) and then sonicating for one minute if necessary. If the compound was still not completely dissolved, DMSO (500 uL) was added and the mixture sonicated for an additional one minute. The resulting solution was then diluted to the appropriate volume with a mixture of acetonitrile/100 mM ammonium acetate pH 5.5 20-50/80-50. If necessary, a further, more dilute, standard solution was prepared by dilution.<br><br>
Test compound solutions and standard solutions were then analysed by HPLC with UV-detection using the following parameters and the solubility of the test compound in 0.1M phosphate buffer was thereby determined:<br>
HPLC-equipment:     HP1100/HP1050<br>

Protocol for Determination of Log. P<br>
Log D values at pH 7.4 were determined using a shake flask method. An appropriate small<br>
amount of the test compound was placed in a 2 mL glass vial with a screw cap at room<br>
temperature and 600 µL of 1-octanol (saturated with 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4) was<br>
added. The vial was then sonicated for one minute so as to dissolve the compound<br>
completely. Then 600 µL of 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 (saturated with l-octanol)<br>
was added and the vial was shaken for 4 minutes to mix the two phases. The two phases<br>
were then separated by centrifugation of the sample at lOOOg for 10 minutes at room<br>
temperature. Finally, the separated aqueous and organic phases were analysed in duplicate<br>
by HPLC using the following conditions:<br>
Injector:	Spark Holland, Endurance<br>
