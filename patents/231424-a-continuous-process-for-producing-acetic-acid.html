				<td>LOW ENERGY CARBONYLATION PROCESS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to processes for making acetic acid; and in<br>
particular to a low energy process for making acetic acid by way of carbonylating methanol with<br>
carbon monoxide and utilizing at most two distillation columns in the primary purification train<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Among currently employed processes for synthesizing acetic acid, one of the most useful<br>
commercially is the rhodium catalyzed carbonylation of methanol with carbon monoxide as<br>
taught in United States Patent No. 3,769,329 of Paulik et al. The carbonylation catalyst<br>
comprises rhodium, either dissolved or otherwise dispersed in a liquid reaction medium along<br>
with a halogen containing catalyst promotor as exemplified by methyl iodide. Generally, the<br>
reaction is conducted with the catalyst being dissolved in a liquid reaction medium through<br>
which carbon monoxide gas is continuously bubbled. Paulik et al. disclosed that water may be<br>
added to the reaction mixture to exert a beneficial effect upon the reaction rate. Water<br>
concentrations greater than about 14 weight percent are typically used. This is the so called<br>
"high water" carbonylation process.<br>
An alternative to the "high water" carbonylation process is the "low water" carbonylation<br>
process as disclosed in United States Patent Nos. 5,001,259; 5,026,908; and 5,144,068. Water<br>
concentrations below 14 weight percent and even below 10 weight percent can be used in the<br>
"low water" carbonylation process. Employing a low water concentration simplifies<br>
downstream processing of the desired carboxylic acid to its glacial form.<br>
It is desirable in a carbonylation process for making acetic acid to minimize the number<br>
of distillation operations in order to minimize energy usage in the process. In this respect there<br>
is disclosed in United States Patent No. 5.416.237 to Aubisne et al. a process for the production<br>
of acetic acid by carbonylation of methanol in the presence of a rhodium catalyst, methyl iodide,<br>
and an iodide salt stabilizer. The improvement according to the '237 patent resides in<br>
maintaining a finite concentration of water up to about 10 percent by weight and a methyl<br>
acetate concentration of at least 2 percent by weight in the liquid reaction composition and<br>
recovering the acetic acid product by passing the liquid reaction composition through a flash<br>
zone to produce a vapor fraction which is passed to a single distillation column from which the<br>
acetic acid product is removed. The drawback of eliminating distillation stages is that the level<br>
of purity of the product suffers. In particular the distillation columns tend to remove high boiling<br><br>
iodides as well as aldehyde contamination products. Both of these impurities impact the<br>
commercial desirability of the final product.<br>
Various means for removing iodides are well known in the art. It was discovered by<br>
Hilton that macroreticulated, strong acid cationic exchange resins with at least one percent of<br>
their active sites converted to the silver or mercury form exhibited remarkable removal<br>
efficiency for iodide contaminants in acetic acid or other organic media. The amount of silver or<br>
mercury associated with the resin may be from as low as about one percent of the active sites to<br>
as high as 100 percent. Preferably about 25 percent to about 75 percent of the active sites were<br>
converted to the silver or mercury form and most preferably about 50 percent. The subject<br>
process is disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,615,806 for removing various iodides from<br>
acetic acid. In particular there is shown in the examples removal of methyl iodide, HI, I2 and<br>
hexyl iodide.<br>
Various embodiments of the basic invention disclosed in United States Patent No.<br>
4,615,806 have subsequently appeared in the literature. There is shown in United States Patent<br>
No. 5,139,981 to Kurland a method for removing iodides from liquid carboxylic acid<br>
contaminated with a halide impurity by contacting the liquid halide contaminant acid with a<br>
silver (I) exchanged macroreticular resin. The halide reacts with the resin bound silver and is<br>
removed from the carboxylic acid stream. The invention in the '981 patent more particularly<br>
relates to an improved method for producing the silver exchanged macroreticular resins suitable<br>
for use in iodide removal from acetic acid.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,227,524 to Jones discloses a process for removing iodides<br>
using a particular silver-exchanged macroreticular strong acid ion exchange resin. The resin has<br>
from about 4 to about 12 percent cross-linking, a surface area in the proton exchanged form of<br>
less than 10 m2/g after drying from the water wet state and a surface area of greater than 10m2/g<br>
after drying from a wet state in which the water has been replaced by methanol. The resin has at<br>
least one percent of its active sites converted to the silver form and preferably from about 30 to<br>
about 70 percent of its active sites converted to the silver form.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,801,279 to Miura el al. discloses a method of operating a<br>
silver exchanged macroreticular strong acid ion exchange resin bed for removing iodides from a<br>
Monsanto type acetic acid stream. The operating method involves operating the bed silver-<br>
exchanged resin while elevating the temperatures in stages and contacting the acetic acid and/or<br>
acetic anhydride containing the iodide compounds with the resin. Exemplified in the patent is<br>
the removal of hexyl iodide from acetic acid at temperatures of from about 25Â° C to about 45Â° C.<br><br>
So also, other ion exchange resins have been used to remove iodide impurities from<br>
acetic acid and/or acetic anhydride. There is disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,220,058 to<br>
Fish et al. the use of ion exchange resins having metal exchanged thiol functional groups for<br>
removing iodide impurities from acetic acid and/or acetic anhydride. Typically, the thiol<br>
functionality of the ion exchange resin has been exchanged with silver, palladium, or mercury.<br>
There is further disclosed in European Publication No. 0 685 445 A1 a process for<br>
removing iodide compounds from acetic acid. The process involves contacting an iodide<br>
containing acetic acid stream with a polyvinylpyridine at elevated temperatures to remove the<br>
iodides. Typically, the acetic acid was fed to the resin bed according to the '445 publication at a<br>
temperature of about 100Â°C.<br>
With ever increasing cost pressures and higher energy prices, there has been ever<br>
increasing motivation to simplify chemical manufacturing operations and particularly to reduce<br>
the number of manufacturing steps. In this regard, it is noted that in United States Patent No.<br>
5,416,237 to Aubigne et al. there is disclosed a single zone distillation process for making acetic<br>
acid. Such process modifications, while desirable in terms of energy costs, tend to place<br>
increasing demands on the purification train. In particular, fewer recycles tend to introduce (or<br>
fail to remove) a higher level of iodides into the product stream and particularly more iodides of<br>
a higher molecular weight. For example, octyl iodide, decyl iodide and dodecyl iodides may all<br>
be present in the product stream as well as hexadecyl iodide; all of which are difficult to remove<br>
by conventional techniques.<br>
Other impurities in acetic acid made by way of the rhodium catalyzed carbonylation of<br>
methanol, notably aldehydes and propionic acid, are likewise known. It is proposed in an article<br>
by Watson, The Cativaâ¢ Process for the Production of Acetic Acid, Chem. Ind. (Dekker) (1998)<br>
75 Catalysis of Organic Reactions, pp. 369-380, that acetaldehyde undergoes reduction by<br>
hydrogen in the rhodium-catalyzed system to give ethanol which subsequently yields propionic<br>
acid. It is postulated that enhanced rhodium catalyzed systems have increased standing levels of<br>
rhodium-acyl species which will form free acetaldehydes at a higher rate.<br>
The precise chemical pathway within the methanol carbonylation process that leads to<br>
the production of crotonaldehyde, 2-ethy] crotonaldehyde and other permanganate reducing<br>
compounds is not well understood. One prominent theory for the formation of the<br>
crotonaldehyde and 2-ethyl crotonaldehyde impurities in the methanol carbonylation process is<br>
that they result from aldol and cross-aldol condensation reactions that involve acetaldehyde.<br>
Substantial efforts have been directed to removing acetaldehyde.<br><br>
Conventional techniques used to remove acetaldehyde and other carbonyl impurities<br>
have included treatment of acetic acid with oxidizers, ozone, water, methanol, amines, and the<br>
like. In addition, each of these techniques may or may not be combined with the distillation of<br>
the acetic acid. The most typical purification treatment involves a series of distillations of the<br>
product acetic acid. Likewise, it is known that carbonyl impurities can be removed from organic<br>
streams by treating the organic streams with an amine compound such as hydroxyl amine which<br>
reacts with the carbonyl compounds to form oximes followed by distillation to separate the<br>
purified organic product from the oxime reaction products. However, this method of treating the<br>
product acetic acid adds cost to the process.<br>
There is disclosed in United States Patent Na5,625,095 to Miura et al. and PCT<br>
International Application No. PCT/US97/18711, Publication No. WO 98/17619 various methods<br>
of removing acetaldehydes and other impurities from a rhodium-catalyzed acetic acid production<br>
process. Generally, these methods involve removing undesirable impurities from recycle<br>
streams to reduce acetaldehyde concentrations in the system.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
There is provided in accordance with the present invention a low energy carbonylation<br>
process utilizing in the primary purification train at most two distillation columns. In<br>
accordance with the inventive process, the amount of aldehydes in the product stream is<br>
preferably controlled by removal of aldehydes from the system or by operating the process such<br>
that low levels of aldehyde contaminants and their derivatives, such as organic iodides are<br>
generated. Moreover, high boiling iodides are removed by way of a high temperature ion<br>
exchange resin such that the product exhibits high levels of purity.<br>
More specifically, there is provided in accordance with the present invention a<br>
continuous process for producing acetic acid including:<br>
(a) reacting methanol with a carbon monoxide feed stock in a carbonylation<br>
reactor holding a catalytic reaction medium while maintaining in said<br>
reaction medium during the course of said reaction at least a finite<br>
concentration of from about 0.1 weight percent up to less than 14 weight<br>
percent of water together with: (i) a salt soluble in the reaction medium at<br>
the reaction temperature in an amount operative to maintain a<br>
concentration of ionic iodide in the range of from about 2 to about 20<br>
weight percent effective as a catalyst stabilizer and co-promoter; (ii) from<br>
about 1 to about 20 percent methyl iodide; (iii) from about 0.5 to about 30<br><br>
weight percent methyl acetate; (iv) a rhodium catalyst; and (v) acetic acid.<br>
A portion of the reaction medium is withdrawn from the reactor and<br>
vaporized in a flashing step. The flashed vapor is distilled to form a liquid<br>
acetic acid product stream utilizing up to two distillation columns while<br>
providing one or more recycle streams to the reactor. The amount of<br>
aldehyde in the liquid acetic acid product stream is optionally controlled<br>
by one of three techniques or combinations of these techniques which<br>
include: (i) operating the reactor at a total pressure of from about 15 to<br>
about 40 atmospheres while maintaining a partial pressure of hydrogen of<br>
less than about 6 psia; (ii) maintaining in the reaction medium a<br>
concentration of less than about 5 weight percent methyl iodide; and (iii)<br>
removing aldehyde impurities from at least one of the recycle streams.<br>
Particularly preferred iodide salts are alkali metal iodide salts such as lithium iodide.<br>
The salts may be formed in-situ, for example, by adding lithium acetate or salt forming<br>
phosphines including pentavalent phosphine oxides to the reactor. So long as the ionic iodide is<br>
measurable by silver titration, minimizes rhodium precipitation and operates to maintain the<br>
majority of or at least 50% of the rhodium in the Rh(I) oxidation state at water concentrations of<br>
less than 14%, it is a "salt", as defined herein. Salts may be used alone or in combination to<br>
maintain the requisite level of ionic iodide. Compare, U.S. Patent No. 5,817,869 with U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,031,129, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference.<br>
Iodides are removed from the liquid acetic acid product residue stream such that the<br>
product has an iodide content of less than about 10 ppb iodide. The iodides are removed by one<br>
of two processes:<br>
(a)	a first process involves contacting the liquid acetic acid product residue<br>
stream with an anionic ion exchange resin at a temperature of at least<br>
about 100Â° C followed by contacting the liquid acetic acid product residue<br>
stream with a silver or mercury exchanged ion exchange substrate wherein<br>
at least one percent of the active sites (i.e., sulfonic acid moieties) of the<br>
resin have been converted to the silver or mercury form;<br>
(b)	a second process involves contacting the liquid acetic acid product residue<br>
stream with a silver or mercury exchanged ion exchange substrate at a<br><br>
temperature of at least about 50Â°C wherein at least one percent of the<br>
active sites of the resin have been converted to the silver or mercury form.<br>
When utilizing an anionic resin, particularly preferred resins include polyvinylpyridine<br>
resins and polyvinylpyrrolidone resins. The anionic resins are typically employed at a<br>
temperature of at least about 150Â°C.<br>
When a silver or mercury exchanged substrate is used, it is typically a macroreticular,<br>
strong acid cationic resin. Temperatures may be from about 60 to about 100Â°C. A minimum<br>
temperature of 60Â°C is sometimes employed while a minimum temperature of about 70Â°C may<br>
likewise be preferred in some embodiments.<br>
In general, when a silver or mercury exchanged strong acid cationic resin is employed<br>
typically from about 25% to about 75% of the active sites are converted to the silver or mercury<br>
form. Most typically about 50% of the active sites are so converted.<br>
The aldehydes in the system may optionally be controlled by removing aldehydes from<br>
the recycle to the reactor by way of, for example, distillation from a condensed recycle stream.<br>
Alternatively the level of aldehyde impurities in the system may be controlled by<br>
minimizing the partial pressure of hydrogen or the levels of methyl iodide in the reactor. In<br>
particular, at a total pressure in the reactor of 15 to 40 atmospheres absolute a partial pressure of<br>
from about 0.1 to about 4 psia of hydrogen may be employed. A partial pressure of hydrogen of<br>
from about 1 to about 4 psia may be preferred. Relatively low level of methyl iodide in the<br>
reactor may be about 5 weight percent or less. A level of methyl iodide of from about 1 to about<br>
5 weight percent may likewise be employed.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, there is provided, an acetic acid made by the process<br>
described herein, wherein the product has a propionic acid content of less than about 500 ppm.<br>
Typically, the product acid has a propionic acid content of less than about 250 ppm, with less<br>
than about 150 ppm being preferred.<br>
Particularly preferred processes are those utilizing a silver-exchanged cationic substrate<br>
for removing iodides and relatively low hydrogen partial pressures in the reactor for controlling<br>
aldehyde impurities. The product stream in many cases includes organic iodides with a C10 or<br>
more aliphatic chain length which need to be removed. Sometimes more than 25% of the<br>
iodides present, or even 50%, have an organic chain length of more than 10 carbon atoms.<br>
Decyl iodides and dodecyl iodides are especially prevalent in the absence of heavy ends<br>
and other finishing apparatus and are difficult to remove from the product stream as will be<br>
appreciated from the data hereinafter appearing. The silver-exchanged cationic substrates of the<br><br>
present invention typically remove over 90% of such iodides; oftentimes the product stream has<br>
from 10 to about 1000 ppb total iodide prior to treatment which would make the product<br>
unusable for iodide-sensitive applications.<br>
From about 20 ppb to about 750 ppb prior to iodide removal treatment is somewhat<br>
typical, whereas the iodide removal treatment is preferably operative to remove at least about<br>
99% of the total iodide present.<br>
In a typical embodiment, iodide removal treatment involves contacting the product with<br>
a silver-exchanged sulfonic acid functionalized macroreticular ion exchange resin, wherein the<br>
product has an organic iodide content of greater than 100 ppb prior to treatment and an organic<br>
iodide contact of less than 10 ppb after contacting the resin.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
It will be appreciated that the rhodium catalyzed process for preparing acetic acid is well<br>
known. Thus, the invention will be described in terms of differences from prior art processes<br>
such as are described in United States Patent Nos. 5,001,259; 5,026,908; 5,144,068, the<br>
disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. There are two criteria which are<br>
desirably satisfied to maintain optimum performance of reaction system for the rhodium<br>
catalyzed carbonylation of methanol to acetic acid. This is over and above the maintenance of a<br>
stable catalyst system from which the rhodium catalyst does not precipitate during the course of<br>
product recovery. First it is desired to maintain a high productivity in the carbonylation reactor<br>
itself as measured by the quantity of acetic acid formed per unit time per unit volume or weight<br>
of liquid reaction medium contained in the reactor. This might be termed "reactor productivity"<br>
or "reactor space time yield", also referred to as "STY". Second, the present process<br>
improvement contemplates the maintenance of optimal productivity as measured by the<br>
ultimately-recovered glacial acetic acid in the combined system including both the carbonylation<br>
reactor and the purification train. It will be recognized by one skilled in the art that water is an<br>
undesirable component of the crude acetic acid and that the more water there is in the product<br>
stream the greater will be the operating cost and required capital investment in the product<br>
recovery purification system. Thus, there is also a system productivity to be considered in<br>
addition to the reaction productivity with the system productivity depending upon the degree to<br>
which water is kept out of the residue of the crude product stream. The drier this stream is, the<br><br>
higher will be the overall system productivity so long as the reaction productivity is maintained<br>
with a suitable impurity profile.<br>
For purposes of this invention, the catalyst which is employed includes a rhodium<br>
component and a halogen promotor in which the halogen is typically iodine. The catalyst<br>
system is preferably generally homogenous as is well known. The rhodium component of a<br>
catalyst system of the present invention is believed to be present in the form of a coordination<br>
compound of rhodium with a halogen component providing at least one of the ligands of such<br>
coordination compound. In addition to the coordination of rhodium and halogen, it is believed<br>
that carbon monoxide and ligands form coordination compounds or complexes with rhodium.<br>
The rhodium component of the catalyst system in the present invention may be provided by<br>
introducing into the reaction zone rhodium in the form of rhodium metal, rhodium salts and<br>
oxides, organic rhodium compounds, coordination compounds of rhodium and the like. The<br>
halogen promoting component of the system consists of a halogen compound comprising an<br>
organic halide. Thus alkyl, aryl and substituted alkyl or aryl halides can be used. Preferably, the<br>
halide promoters are present in the form of an alkyl halide in which the alkyl radical corresponds<br>
to the alkyl radical of the free alcohol which is carbonylated. For example in the carbonylation<br>
of methanol to acetic acid, the halide promoter will comprise methyl halide and most preferably<br>
methyl iodide. The reaction medium employed may include any solvent compatible with the<br>
catalyst system and may include pure alcohols, or mixtures of the alcohol feed stock and/or the<br>
desired carboxylic acid and/or esters of the two compounds. The preferred solvent and reaction<br>
medium for the process of this invention comprises acetic acid.<br>
Water is also maintained in the reaction medium but at relatively low concentrations; that<br>
is concentrations below about 14%. It has been shown (United States Patent Nos. 5,001,259;<br>
5,026,908; and 5,144,068) that reaction rate substantially equal to and above reaction rates<br>
obtained with water concentrations above about 14% can be achieved with water concentrations<br>
below 14% and as low as 0.1 weight percent. In accordance with the present invention the<br>
desired reaction rates are obtained at low water concentrations by maintaining in the reaction<br>
medium an ester which corresponds to the alcohol being carbonylated and the acid product of<br>
the carbonylation reactant and most preferably an additional iodide ion which is over and above<br>
the iodide which is present as a catalyst promoter such as methyl iodide or other organic iodide.<br>
Thus, in the carbonylation reaction of methanol to acetic acid, the ester is methyl acetate and the<br>
additional iodide co-promoter is an iodide salt with lithium iodide being most preferred.<br>
It has been found that under low water concentrations, methyl acetate and iodide ion act<br>
as rate promoters when relatively high concentrations of each of these components are present<br><br>
and that the promotion is higher when both of these components are present simultaneously as<br>
disclosed in United States Patent Nos. 5,001,259; 5,026,908; 5,144,068<br>
Additionally, it has been shown that in reaction mediums having a methyl acetate<br>
concentration of greater than about 2 weight percent, iodide ion is necessary not only to increase<br>
the reaction rate but also to stabilize the rhodium catalyst due to the deleterious effect of high<br>
methyl acetate concentrations on its stability, even at high water concentrations.<br>
Table 1 gives suitable ranges of some of the various reactor components used in the<br>
process of the present invention.<br><br><br>
Amounts of water, iodide ion, methyl acetate and methyl iodide are set forth as both a<br>
broad range and a preferred, or optimal ranges for obtaining both catalyst stabilization and<br>
reaction rate enhancement. The preferred range is that which is preferred from the standpoint of<br>
optimal performance of the entire system including the primary product recovery system as<br>
explained above. It will be seen that the recommended concentrations are, very generally, the<br>
same for both stabilization and also rate enhancement.<br>
Suitably stable ion exchange resins utilized in connection with the present invention for<br>
preparing silver or mercury-exchanged resins for iodide removal typically are of the "RSO3H"<br>
type classified as "strong acid", that is, sulfonic acid, cation exchange resins of the<br>
macroreticular (macroporous) type. Particularly suitable ion exchange substrates include<br>
AmberlystÂ®15 resin (Rohm and Haas) suitable for use at elevated temperatures. Other stable<br>
ion exchange substrates such as zeolites may be employed, provided that the material is stable in<br>
the organic medium at the conditions of interest, that is, will not chemically decompose or<br>
release silver or mercury into the organic medium in unacceptable amounts. Zeolite cationic ion<br>
exchange substrates are disclosed for example, in United States Patent No. 5,962,735 to<br>
Kulprathipanja el al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
At temperatures greater than about 50Â°C, the silver or mercury exchanged cationic<br>
substrate may tend to release small amounts of silver on the order of 500 ppb or less and thus the<br>
silver or mercury exchanged substrate is chemically stable under the conditions of interest.<br>
More preferably silver losses are less than about 100 ppb into the organic medium and still more<br>
preferably less than about 20 ppb into the organic medium. Silver losses may be slightly higher<br>
upon start up or if the process is conducted with exposure to light since silver iodide is believed<br>
photoreactive and may form soluble complexes if contacted by light. In any event, if so desired,<br><br>
a bed of cationic material in the unexchanged form may be placed downstream of the silver or<br>
mercury exchange material of the present invention, to catch any silver or mercury released from<br>
the cationic ion exchange resin.<br>
The process of the present invention may be carried out in any suitable configuration. A<br>
particularly preferred configuration is to utilize a bed of paniculate material (termed herein a<br>
"guard bed") inasmuch as this configuration is particularly convenient. A typical flow rate, such<br>
as is used when acetic acid is to be purified, is from about 0.5 to about 20 bed volumes per hour<br>
(BV/hr). A bed volume is simply the volume occupied by the resin in the bed. Simply put, for<br>
100 ml of resin the bed volume is said to be 100 ml. Typical flow rates are usually from about 6<br>
to about 10 BV/hr, with about 8 BV/hr being preferred in many embodiments.<br>
Similar flow rates are employed when utilizing an anionic guard bed of a pyridine or<br>
pyrrolidone resin. The terminology "pyridine resin", "pyridine ring-containing polymer",<br>
"pyridine polymer" and the like used herein is intended to refer to a polymer containing<br>
substituted or non-substituted pyridine rings or substituted or non-substituted, pyridine-<br>
containing polycondensed rings such as quinoline rings. The substituents include those inert to<br>
the methanol carbonylation process conditions such as an alkyl group and alkoxy group.<br>
Typical examples of the insoluble, pyridine ring-containing polymers include those obtained by<br>
reaction of vinylpyridine with a divinyl monomer or by reaction of vinylpyridine with a divinyl<br>
monomer-containing vinyl monomer, such as copolymers of 4-vinylpyridine and<br>
divinylbenzene, copolymers of 2-vinylpyridine and divinylbenzene, copolymers of styrene.<br>
vinylbenzene and divinylbenzene, copolymers of vinylmethylpyridine and divinylbenzene and<br>
copolymers of vinylpyridine, methyl acrylate and ethyl diacrylate. Particularly preferred<br>
polymers are described in United States Patent No. 5,334,755 to Yoneda et al., the disclosure of<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference. Relatively high degrees of crosslinking in the<br>
polymer is most preferred.<br>
The terminology "pyrrolidone resin", "pyrrolidone ring-containing polymer",<br>
pyrrolidone polymer and the like used herein is intended to refer to a polymer containing<br>
substituted or non-substituted pyrrolidone rings. The substituents may include those inert to the<br>
methanol carbonylation medium such as alkyl groups or alkoxy groups. Typical examples of<br>
insoluble, pyrrolidone ring-containing polymer include those obtained by reaction of vinyl<br>
pyrrolidone with a di-vinyl monomer-containing vinyl monomer such as a co-polymer of a vinyl<br>
pyrrolidone and divinyl benzene. Pyrrolidone polymers are discussed in United States Patent<br>
No. 5,466,874 of Scales et al. as well as United States Patent No. 5,286,826; 4,786,699 and<br>
4,139,688, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. A preferred<br><br>
pyrrolidone polymer substrate is available under the trade name of ReillexÂ® from Reilley Tar<br>
and Chemical Corporation of Indianapolis, IND.<br>
It is desirable that the above nitrogen heterocyclic ring-containing polymer should be<br>
crosslinked by at least 10%, preferably at least 15% or 20% and up to 75%. A degree of<br>
crosslinking below 10% is disadvantageous because the mechanical strength of the polymer may<br>
degrade during use. As the degree of crosslinking increases, the availability of the polymer<br>
surface may be unduly restricted. A maximum degree of crosslinking of 50 or 60 percent is then<br>
preferred. The term "degree of crosslinking" used herein is intended to refer to the content, in<br>
terms of % by weight, of the divinyl monomer, for example.<br>
A pyridine or pyrrolidone insoluble polymer may be in the free base or N-oxide form or<br>
quaternized form as noted above. The insoluble, pyridine or pyrrolidone ring-containing<br>
polymer is preferably in a bead or granular form, more preferably in a spherical form, having a<br>
particle diameter of 0.01 - 2 mm, preferably 0.1-1 mm, more preferably 0.25 - 0.7 mm.<br>
Commercially available pyridine-containing polymers such as Reillex-425 (product of Reilly<br>
Tar and Chemical Corporation) and KEX-316, KeX-501 and KEX-212 (products of Koei<br>
Chemical Co., Ltd.) may be suitably used for the purpose of the present invention. As noted<br>
above pyrrolidones are also available from Reilly Tar and a degree of crosslinking of at least<br>
about 20% is preferred.<br>
The present invention is further described in connection with Figures 1 and 2 wherein<br>
like numerals designate similar parts. There is shown in Figure 1 a first apparatus 10 useful for<br>
practicing the process of the present invention. Apparatus 10 includes a reactor 12, a flasher, a<br>
splitter column 16, as well as optionally, a high temperature resin bed 20, heat exchanger means<br>
22 and a resin bed 24. There is further provided a condenser 30 for collection the light ends<br>
from the splitter column. In Figure 1, column 16 operates as both a light ends and dehydration<br>
distillation column.<br>
Acetic acid is manufactured in a liquid phase reaction typically at about 150Â°C - 200Â°C<br>
in reactor 12 at a pressure of from about 30 to about 60 bar. Carbon monoxide and methanol are<br>
introduced continuously into the back-mixed reactor wherein carbon monoxide mass transfer<br>
into the liquid phase is maximized with adequate mixing, indicated at 32. at a high carbon<br>
monoxide partial pressure. Non-condensable by-products are vented from the reactor to<br>
maintain an optimum carbon monoxide partial pressure in the reactor, as indicated at 34. The<br>
reactor off-gas is treated to recover reactor condensables, e.g., methyl iodide, before flaring.<br>
Catalyst solution, containing the product acetic acid, as well as the various components<br>
of the reaction mixture, such as rhodium complexes and iodide salts, is drawn off and provided<br><br>
to flasher 14 by way of line 36. In flasher 14, the product acetic acid and the majority of the<br>
light ends (methyl iodide, methyl acetate, water) are separated from the reactor catalyst solution<br>
and forwarded with dissolved gasses to purification section byway of an adiabatic single stage<br>
flash. This crude separation also functions to remove the exothermal heat of reaction. The<br>
catalyst solution is recycled to reactor 12 by way of a catalyst recycle line 38.<br>
The vapor product from flasher 14 proceeds via line 40 to splitter (light ends) column 16.<br>
Methyl iodide, methyl acetate, and a portion of the water are condensed overhead at 30 to form<br>
two phases (organic and aqueous). Either or both phases may be treated to remove aldehydes<br>
and aldehyde impurities before being returned to the reactor via lines 42, 44, 46 indicated on<br>
Figure 1. As noted earlier, preferred methods for treating these phases are described in United<br>
States Patent No. 5,625,075 and WIPO publication WO 98/17619, the disclosures of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference. A portion of the overhead, the aqueous phase, for example,<br>
may be recycled to column 16 as reflux via line 48, whereas the residue of column 16 is recycled<br>
to reactor 12 via lines 50, 46.<br>
Product acetic acid is withdrawn via a sidestream 52 and fed to a resin bed 20 at elevated<br>
temperature and pressure. The sidestream is located near the bottom of the column and can be<br>
withdrawn as a vapor or liquid sidestream. If it is a vapor sidestream, it is condensed prior to<br>
feeding to bed 20. Typically, bed 20 is operated at a temperature above about 170Â°C and<br>
consists of an anionic, heterocyclic-ring containing polymeric ion exchange resin. Most<br>
preferably, resin bed 20 is a bed of particulate pyridine resin or pyrrolidine resin described<br>
above, suitably crosslinked so that it will withstand processing at elevated temperatures and<br>
pressures.<br>
The product leaves high temperature resin bed 20 via line 54 and conveyed to heat<br>
exchanger 22 wherein the product is cooled to a temperature of about 100Â°C or less.<br>
A silver-exchanged cationic macroporous resin bed 24 is used to further remove iodides.<br>
Product acetic acid leaves the system at line 56.<br>
Figure 2 shows an alternate apparatus 10 wherein the inventive process may be<br>
practiced. Parts are numbered in Figure 2 as in Figure 1 and operated in substantially the same<br>
manner, except that there is further provided a separate dehydration column 18 for receiving the<br>
product acetic acid stream from column 16 via line 52 as well as a different iodide removal<br>
system as described below. The overhead of vessel 18 is condensed at 58 and becomes two<br>
phases, aqueous and organic, both of which are recycled to reactor 12. The aqueous stream is<br>
also refluxed to column 18 via line 62. The dry crude acetic acid exits column 18 as a residue<br>
stream at 64 and is provided to heat exchanger 22 which cools the product such that the average<br><br>
temperature in resin bed 24 is maintained preferably between about 50 and 70Â°. If it is desired<br>
to operate bed 24 at a higher temperature, it may be convenient to locate heat exchanger 22<br>
upstream of bed 24. After cooling, the stream is treated in resin bed 24 and cooled again in heat<br>
exchanger 26 before being fed to resin bed 28. Resin bed 28 is also a bed of silver or mercury<br>
exchanged cationic ion exchange media and is typically operated at an average product<br>
temperature of from about 35Â°C to about 20Â°C.<br>
As used herein, the terminology "primary purification train" and like terminology refers<br>
to purification equipment operating on the primary product stream from the flasher, excluding<br>
vent recovery equipment, scrubbers, alkanes removal and so forth. Thus, with respect to Figure<br>
1, the primary purification train consists of light ends and dehydration column 16, high<br>
temperature resin bed 20, resin bed 24 and associated conduits. Note that the flasher is not<br>
generally considered part of the primary purification train nor are scrubbers and the like. Thus<br>
with respect to Figure 2, the primary purification train includes light ends column 16,<br>
dehydration column 18 and resin beds 24 and 28.<br>
Particularly preferred methods of operating the resin beds, especially bed 24,<br>
is described below. Further, it is seen that aldehyde impurities are controlled by optimizing<br>
conditions in reactor 12 as hereinafter described.<br>
Examples<br>
The following Examples 1-5 and comparative Examples A through F used the<br>
procedures described below. Unless otherwise noted, Iodide removal was performed using<br>
silver exchanged AmberlystÂ® are 15 resin. The resin (100 ml wet) was loaded into a 22 mm OD<br>
glass column and acetic acid containing iodides was eluted at a flow rate of 13.3 ml/min. Iodide<br>
levels in the eluate were measured every two (2) hours. Total iodides are measured in the eluate<br>
by any suitable technique. One suitable technique is by way of neutron activation analysis<br>
(NAA) as is well known in the art. The iodide levels for particular species were also measured.<br>
A preferred method in this latter respect is gas chromatography utilizing an electron capture<br>
detector.<br>
Comparative Examples A and B<br>
Samples of the residue from the drying column of a conventional Monsanto type acetic<br>
acid plant containing 540 ppb total iodide and 238 ppb total iodide were treated at room<br>
temperature using a silver exchanged bed of AmberlystÂ® 15 resin and the total iodides in the<br><br>
eluate were measured as a function of time as shown in Figure 3. As can be seen from Figure<br>
3, total iodide removal was typically less than about 90% at the start of the test and<br>
progressively decayed over a ten hour time period to much lower removal efficiencies.<br>
The various iodide components in the feed were identified to include:<br>
methyl iodide<br>
ethyl iodide<br>
2-iodo-2-methyl propane<br>
propyl iodide<br>
2-butyl iodide<br>
butyl iodide<br>
iodine<br>
pentyl iodide<br>
hexyl iodide<br>
octyl iodide<br>
decyl iodide<br>
dodecyl iodide<br>
hexadecyl iodide<br>
The predominant high molecular weight organic iodide components identified were<br>
decyl iodide and dodecyl iodide.<br>
Comparative Examples of C and D and Example 1<br>
Following the procedure outlined above, the temperature dependence of the guard bed<br>
performance was measured for relatively high (ppm) levels of organic iodides in acetic acid.<br>
Results for dodecyl iodide (Example C) and hexyl iodide (Example D) at 25Â°C and for dodecyl<br>
iodide at 100Â°C are shown in Figure 4. Results indicate that, guard bed performance is greatly<br>
enhanced at 100Â°C over 25Â°C. particularly for dodecyl iodide. Performance improvements<br>
include both removal efficiency and useful life of the bed.<br>
Comparative Examples E.F<br><br>
Following the procedure outlined above, the effect of chain branching on guard bed<br>
performance was investigated by comparing removal of hexyl iodide with removal of neopentyl<br>
iodide (Example F). Results appear in Figure 5.<br>
Examples 2-4<br>
Following the procedure outlined above, performance of a silver-exchanged AmberlystÂ®<br>
15 guard bed was evaluated for removal of dodecyl iodide at 25Â°C, 50Â°C, 75Â°C, and 100Â°C and<br>
for removal of hexyl iodide at 25Â°C. Results appear in Figure 6 where Examples C and D also<br>
appear for purposes of comparison. Here again, it can be seen removal efficiencies in useful<br>
capacities of the bed are greatly enhanced at temperatures above about 50Â°C.<br>
Example 5<br>
Following the procedures outlined above, samples of acetic acid (drying column residue)<br>
from a Monsanto type acetic acid plant containing respectively 540 ppb total iodide (Example<br>
A), 238 ppb total iodide (Example B) and 259 ppb total iodide (Example 5). The acid was<br>
treated, as before, using a silver exchanged AmberlystÂ® 15 guard bed at 25Â°C and 50Â°C. As can<br>
be seen from Figure 7, performance at 50Â°C was far superior to removal efficiencies at 25Â°C.<br>
Indeed the guard bed removed greater than 99% (nearly quantitative removal) of the total iodide<br>
at 50Â°C.<br>
As part of the present invention it is desirable to control the amount of acetaldehyde<br>
carbonyl impurities that are included in the product stream. Some techniques involve the<br>
treatment of acetic acid with oxidizers, ozone, water, methanol, amines and the like. These<br>
techniques might include, for example, the removal of carbonyl impurities from organic streams<br>
by treating the organic stream with an amine compound such as hydroxylamine which reacts<br>
with the carbonyl compounds to form oximes followed by distillation to separate the purified<br>
organic product from the oxime reaction products. As noted above, this method adds cost to the<br>
process.<br>
There is disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,625,095 to Miura et al. and PCT<br>
International Application No. PCT/US 97/18711 Publication No. WO98/17619 various methods<br>
of removing aldehydes and other impurities from a rhodium catalyzed acetic acid production<br>
process. Generally these methods involve extracting undesirable impurities from the process<br>
recycle streams to reduce acetaldehyde concentrations in the system. The disclosure of the '095<br>
patent and International Application No. PCT/US97/1871 ] are hereby incorporated into this<br><br>
application by reference and these techniques may be used to control the acetaldehyde<br>
concentration in the system of the present invention.<br>
Another method is to control the acetaldehyde concentration in the product stream by<br>
minimizing the production of byproducts. It has been discovered that by maintaining the<br>
hydrogen partial pressures at or below levels previously recognized in the art is beneficial. The<br>
production of acid aldehyde and its derivatives, particularly crotonaldehyde and 2-ethyl<br>
crotonaldehyde can be dramatically reduced. The following examples illustrate this feature<br>
which can be employed in connection with the present invention.<br>
A reaction system which is employed, wherein the present improvement is demonstrated,<br>
comprises (a) a liquid-phase homogeneous carbonylation reactor, (b) a so-called "flasher", and<br>
(c) a "methyl iodide-acetic acid splitter column". The carbonylation reactor is typically a stirred<br>
autoclave within which the reacting liquid contents are maintained automatically at a constant<br>
level. Into this reactor there are continuously introduced fresh methanol, sufficient water to<br>
maintain at least a finite concentration of water in the reaction medium, recycled catalyst<br>
solution from the flasher base, and recycled methyl iodide and methyl acetate from the overhead<br>
of the methyl iodide-acetic acid splitter column. Alternate distillation systems can be employed<br>
so long as they provide means for recovering the crude acetic acid and recycling to the reactor<br>
catalyst solution, methyl iodide, and methyl acetate. In the process, a mixed carbon<br>
monoxide/hydrogen feed is continuously introduced into the carbonylation reactor just below the<br>
agitator which is used to stir the contents. The mixed gaseous feed is, of course, thoroughly<br>
dispersed through the reacting liquid by this means. A gaseous purge stream is vented from the<br>
reactor to prevent buildup of gaseous by-products and to maintain a set carbon monoxide partial<br>
pressure at a given total reactor pressure. By controlling the venting of gases, it is also possible<br>
to control the hydrogen partial pressure in the reactor. The temperature of the reactor is con-<br>
trolled automatically, and the carbon monoxide/hydrogen feed is introduced at a rate sufficient<br>
to maintain the desired total reactor pressure.<br>
Liquid product is drawn off from the carbonylation reactor at a rate sufficient to maintain<br>
a constant level therein and is introduced to the flasher at a point intermediate between the top<br>
and bottom thereof. In the flasher the catalyst solution is withdrawn as a base stream<br>
(predominantly acetic acid containing the rhodium and the iodide salt along with lesser<br>
quantities of methyl acetate, methyl iodide, and water), while the overhead of the flasher<br>
comprises largely the product acetic acid along with methyl iodide, methyl acetate, and water. A<br>
portion of the carbon monoxide and hydrogen along with gaseous by-products such as methane,<br>
hydrogen, and carbon dioxide exits the top of the flasher.<br><br>
The product acetic acid drawn from the base of the methyl iodide-acetic acid splitter<br>
column (it can also be withdrawn as a side stream near the base) is then drawn off for final<br>
purification as desired by methods well known in the art and which are outside the scope of the<br>
present invention. The overhead from the methyl iodide-acetic acid splitter, comprising mainly<br>
methyl iodide and methyl acetate, is recycled to the carbonylation reactor.<br>
The primary reaction control method comprises continually analyzing the liquid contents<br>
of the reactor as well as the carbon monoxide and hydrogen content of the gas in the reactor vent<br>
and, on the basis of these analyses, controlling the flow of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, water,<br>
methanol, and methyl iodide to maintain the specified reaction medium composition. It should<br>
be further explained that the methanol addition to the carbonylation reactor is based not on an<br>
analysis of its contents for methanol but, rather, on analysis for methyl acetate content. Most of<br>
the methanol is converted almost immediately to methyl acetate when it enters the carbonylation<br>
reactor.<br>
In a continuous process which is described above, the catalyst system is maintained, with<br>
the reactants being continuously supplied to the reaction zone containing the catalyst system at<br>
the desired temperature and pressure. The products are continuously withdrawn, as described<br>
above by withdrawing a portion of the solution containing the catalyst system, unreacted feed,<br>
equilibrium components, and the desired product. The desired product is then separated from<br>
such solution to permit recycling of the catalyst containing solution which includes unreacted<br>
feed and also equilibrium components.<br>
The following examples are included to demonstrate methods of controlling the level of<br>
aldehyde impurities in accordance with the present invention. It should be appreciated by those<br>
of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples which follow represent<br>
techniques discovered by the inventors to function well in the practice of the invention, and thus<br>
can be considered to constitute preferred modes for its practice. However, those of skill in the<br>
art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the<br>
specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
Examples 6-9<br>
A continuous pilot plant equipped generally as described above with a 4-liter reactor<br>
operating at 1.5 liter reaction volume was used to investigate the effect of hydrogen partial<br>
pressure on the formation of by-products while carbonylating methanol. Operating conditions<br>
and results appear in Table 2 below. "Column Residue Impurities" refers to impurities in the<br><br>
crude acetic acid product and "H2pp" refers to the partial pressure of hydrogen in the reaction<br>
vessel in pounds per square inch absolute.<br><br><br>
As can be seen, the impurity profile is improved at lower hydrogen partial pressures in<br>
the reactor.<br>
While the foregoing examples demonstrate the reduction of crotonaldehyde and the like,<br>
it will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that other impurities and byproducts in rhodium<br>
catalyzed carbonylation systems include butane, butanol, butyl acetate, butyl iodide, ethanol,<br>
ethyl acetate, ethyl iodide, hexyl iodide and high boiling impurities. The present invention<br>
appears to minimize production of these impurities as well.<br>
Another method of controlling the acid aldehyde involves operating the process at<br>
relatively low concentrations of methyl iodide.<br>
A typical homogeneous reaction system which is employed for the following examples is<br>
generally as described above and comprises (a) a liquid-phase carbonylation reactor, (b) a<br>
flasher, and (c) a methyl iodide-acetic acid splitter column. The carbonylation reactor is<br>
typically a stirred autoclave within which the reacting liquid contents are maintained<br><br>
automatically at a constant level. Into this reactor there are continuously introduced fresh<br>
methanol, sufficient water to maintain at least a finite (&gt;50 ppm and preferably at least about 0.1<br>
wt%) concentration of water in the reaction medium, recycled catalyst solution from the flasher<br>
base, and recycled methyl iodide, methyl acetate and water from the overhead of the methyl<br>
iodide-acetic acid splitter column. A distillation system can be employed to further process the<br>
condensed overhead stream from the flasher. The residue from the flasher is recirculated to the<br>
reactor. Carbon monoxide is continuously introduced into and thoroughly dispersed within the<br>
carbonylation reactor. A gaseous purge stream is vented from the head of the reactor to prevent<br>
buildup of gaseous by-product and to maintain a set carbon monoxide partial pressure at a given<br>
total reactor pressure. The temperature and pressure of the reactor are controlled by methods<br>
known in the art.<br>
Crude liquid product is drawn off from the carbonylation reactor at a rate sufficient to<br>
maintain a constant level therein and is introduced to the flasher at a point intermediate between<br>
the top and bottom thereof. In the flasher the catalyst solution is withdrawn as a base stream<br>
predominantly acetic acid containing the rhodium catalyst and the iodide salt along with lesser<br>
quantities of methyl acetate, methyl iodide, and water, while the condensed overhead of the<br>
flasher comprises largely the crude product, acetic acid, along with methyl iodide, methyl<br>
acetate, and water. A portion of the carbon monoxide along with gaseous by-products such as<br>
methane, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide exits the top of the flasher.<br>
The dry acetic acid (
iodide-acetic acid splitter column (it can also be withdrawn as a side stream near the base) for<br>
final purification as desired by methods which are obvious to those skilled in the art and which<br>
are outside the scope of the present inventions. The overhead from the methyl iodide-acetic acid<br>
splitter, comprising mainly methyl iodide, methyl acetate and water, is recycled to the<br>
carbonylation reactor.<br>
The following specific examples are supplied for the purpose of better illustrating the<br>
invention. These examples are not intended, however, to limit or restrict the scope of the<br>
invention in any way and should not be construed as providing conditions, parameters, or values<br>
which must be utilized exclusively in order to practice the present invention.<br>
Examples 10-12<br>
Continuous methanol carbonylations were performed in a reaction system as described<br>
above, which includes a stirred reactor, a flasher, and a methyl iodide-acetic acid splitter<br>
column. Except for varying methyl iodide concentration the reaction conditions were repeated<br><br>
in each of the following examples so as to demonstrate the effect of reduced methyl iodide on<br>
acetaldehyde.<br>
Each run achieved steady state conditions before collecting impurity data by operating<br>
the reactor continuously to maintain constant target reaction compositions and conditions, as<br>
indicated in Table 3. Then, for at least 12 hours thereafter, data was collected and plots were<br>
maintained to indicate that the carbonylation reaction was in steady state mode.<br>
The results of Examples 10-12 are provided in Table 3. With respect to Table 3, the<br>
values are mass balance data taken over at least a 12 hour period at steady state conditions. The<br>
results of Examples 10 and 12 each represent a single mass balance run. The results of Example<br>
11 are an average of two mass balance operating periods.<br>
Table 3: Continuous Operation Results<br><br>
As can be seen, the acetaledehyde concentration in the reactor is reduced with a reduction of<br>
MEI<br>
In a still further aspect of the invention, there is provided method of reducing the Color<br>
Value (Pt-Co) units of acetic acid, hereafter referred to as APHA Color Value. Typically, this<br>
method involves treating acetic acid to achieve a consistently low level of below about 5 APHA<br>
color units. To illustrate, 10 samples of acetic acid were examined at various levels of iodide<br>
and color impurities. Only one sample, which was derived from material having an APHA<br><br>
Color Value of 65, exhibited a value of greater than 5 APHA color units after treatment. This<br>
aspect of the present invention is better appreciated from the Examples.<br>
Examples 13-22<br>
A resin bed was prepared utilizing Rohm &amp; Haas AmberlystÂ® 15 macroporous resin<br>
with 10% of the sites converted to the silver (Ag+) form. Acetic acid was obtained from the<br>
drying column residue of a Monsanto-type plant (e.g., line 64 of Figure 2) and from a residue<br>
stream of a heavy ends column from a Monsanto-type acetic acid plant. As will be appreciated<br>
by one of skill in the art, the heavy ends has a higher concentration of iodide and color<br>
impurities of generally the same type present in the drying column residue, that is, including<br>
decyl iodide and dodecyl iodide. The drying column residue and drying column residue spiked<br>
with 0.1 % heavy ends residue was treated by contracting it with the resin prepared as above at<br>
50Â°C as further detailed in Table 4 below. As used herein, "Color Value", "Pt-Co Color Units",<br>
"Color Units", and like terminology refer to APHA, sometimes referred to as Hazen Pt-Co color<br>
units determined in accordance with ASTM test method designation D1209-62 "Standard<br>
Method of Test for Color of Clear Liquids Using Platinum-Cobalt Color Standards", preferably<br>
utilizing a suitable spectrometer.<br><br><br>
Addition of 0.1 % heavy ends to the Drying column residue feed material was used to accelerate<br>
the exhaustion of the resin by increasing the concentration of the same iodide and color body<br>
species already present in the stream.<br>
As can be seen, treatment with the resin particularly at elevated temperatures is effective<br>
to maintain the Color Value at a level of less than 10 and usually less than 5 Pt-Co Color Units.<br>
The treatment is particularly useful in connection with a continuous process for producing acetic<br>
acid comprising: (a) reacting methanol with a carbon monoxide feedstock in a carbonylation<br>
reactor holding a catalytic reaction medium while maintaining in the reaction medium during the<br>
course of the reaction at least a finite concentration of from about 0.1 weight percent up to less<br><br>
than 14 weight percent of water; (b) withdrawing a stream of the reaction medium from the<br>
reactor and vaporizing a portion of the withdrawn medium in a flashing step; (c) distilling the<br>
flashed vapor to form a liquid acetic acid product stream utilizing in a primary purification train<br>
up to two distillation columns while providing one or more recycle streams to said reactor; and<br>
(d) removing iodides from said liquid acetic acid product stream and simultaneously controlling<br>
the Color Value of said acetic acid stream such that the product has an iodide content of less<br>
than about 10 ppb iodide and a Color Value of less than about 10, preferably less than about 5,<br>
wherein said step of removing iodides and controlling the Color Value of said product stream<br>
consists essentially of contacting said liquid acetic acid product stream with a silver or a<br>
mercury exchanged ion exchange substrate at a temperature of at least about 50Â°C wherein at<br>
least one percent of the active sites of said resin have been converted to the silver or mercury<br>
form.<br>
The method of treating the acetic acid stream is typically applied to a stream having a<br>
Color Value of greater than about 5 and includes contacting the liquid acetic acid product stream<br>
with a silver or a mercury exchanged ion exchange substrate at a temperature of at least about<br>
50Â°C wherein at least one percent of the active sites of said resin have been converted to the<br>
silver of mercury form such that the treated acetic acid has a Color Value of less than about 5<br>
after treatment. Sometimes the acetic acid has a Color Value of greater than about 10 prior to<br>
contacting the stream with said silver or mercury exchanged ion exchange substrate. Typically,<br>
the acetic acid stream contains decyl iodides and dodecyl iodides prior to treatment with said<br>
silver or mercury exchanged ion exchange substrate.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail here and above various modifications to<br>
