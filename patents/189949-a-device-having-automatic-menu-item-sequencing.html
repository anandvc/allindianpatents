				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a device having automatic<br>
menu item sequencing.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
As the complexity of electronic devices increases, the number of user selectable operating modes of the devices correspondingly increases. For miniature electronic devices such as portable paging receivers, providing a convenient method for rapid selection of most desired operating modes becomes difficult. This is due in part to the miniature size of the device.<br>
For example, common prior art pagers had only a few operating modes such as "read", "protect", and "delete". Presenting a predetermined sequence of menu items for selection of these few modes proved trivial. However, with the advent of improved microcomputers with increased memory for use in these devices, the number of possible operating modes has increased to a dozen or more. The modes may now include: "read", "protect", "set alert volume", "erase", "off", "set alarm", "set alert melody", "auto/manual power", "set auto power time", "set time of day", "set read mode", and "chronograph". However, mode selection tools typically available to PCs users , such as a large graphic monitor, a full alpha key board and a mouse, are not available to users of such miniature electronic devices. Thus, the methods used on a PC to select operating modes may not readily adapt to miniature devices.  Due to the miniature nature of the device the size of the display and the number and type of user controls are limited. For example, a typical display may be less than two square inches or twelve and a half square centimeters and the device may have only a few switches and no mouse. On such a miniature device, menu items allowing the user to select a desired mode are presented in a<br>
predetermined sequence. The user then navigates sequentially through the sequence of menu items to select the desired operating mode.<br>
A problem arises when one user desires a certain set of operating modes which are different from those of another user. Attempting to solve this problem with a predetermined sequence of menu items cannot not satisfy all users of the devices. For example, a first user may frequently use the device's chronograph mode for timing sporting events, and thus would prefer to have the menu item corresponding to the chronograph mode occur early in the sequence of menu items. On the other hand, another user with many appointments may prefer to use the device's alarm modes while having little or no use for the device's chronograph functions.  This user would prefer to have menu items corresponding to the device's alarm fimctions occur early in the sequence of menu items while having the chronograph menu item occur last in the sequence of menu items. Consequently, it is not possible to design a predetermined sequence of menu items capable of satisfying both users.<br>
Thus, what is needed is a method for adjusting the sequence of menu items on an electronic device to correspond to the way the user uses the device.<br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
In a portable information display device having a plurality of operating modes and a corresponding plurality of menu items, providing for selection by a user of the device of one of the plurality menu items comprises the steps of monitoring selection by the user of each of the plurality of operating modes, and selecting a first menu item from the plurality of menu items in response to said step of monitoring.<br>
The present invention provides a device having automatic menu item sequencing, the device comprising:<br>
a plurality of operating modes;<br>
a display for displaying a plurality of menu items coiTesponding to the plurality of operating modes;<br>
one or more switches for selection by the user of the plurality of operating modes;<br>
means for monitoring selection by the user of the plurality of operating modes to determine a frequency of selection of each of the plurality of operating modes; and<br>
means for assigning an adaptive priority to each of the plurality of menu items based on the frequency of selection, said adaptive priority ranging from a highest priority menu item to a lowest priority menu item, wherein the highest priority menu item corresponds to a most frequently selected operating mode and the lowest priority menu item corresponds to a least frequently selected operating mode, wherein each menu item is further assigned a predetermined default priority for use in assigning the adaptive priority when at least two of the operating modes have a substantially similar frequency of selection.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
FIG. 1 shows a front view of a device 20 operating in accord with the preferred embodiment of the present invention.  The paging device has a display area 22 for communicating message information to the user.  The display area is preferably comprised of a display means such as a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). Display area 22 has a pager status display area 24 for indicating various statuses of the pager.  For example, the status area indicates time stamp information, out of range, auto-on off, as well as alert type and alarni statuses. Display area 22 also has a graphic display area 26 which is capable of displaying both text and graphic information. Graphic display 26 may be used for displaying message information received by the pager as well as menu items for mode selection of the pager. Pager 20 also has a mode switch 28 and a select switch 30 which are preferably push button switches.  These switches enable the user to control the operation of the pager, including the viewing of a mode selection menu and selection of operating modes front the menu.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a table of m.enu items in accord with the preferred embodiment of the present invention.  The table includes a plurality of operating modes and a corresponding plurality of menu items.  Column 40 is a list of menu items from which the user may select an operating mode of the pager.  In the preferred embodiment, the symbol<br>
corresponding to the menu item displayed on graphic display 26 is the same as the text contained in column 40.  In alternate embodiments, the symbol could be a foreign language equivalent of the text or a representative icon.  Column 42 represents the default priority assigned to each menu item which indicates an initial sequence of the menu item. Column 44 represents the number of times a user has selected a particular operating mode of the pager.  Column 46 represents the priority of the menu item in the sequence that it will be displayed in display area 26. As will be explained with reference to FIG. 3, the priority is a function of both the default 42 and frequency 44 columns.<br>
The operating modes of column 40 are typical of pagers. The read messages mode allows the user to view messages received by the pager. The protect messages mode allows the user to prevent selected messages from being deleted.  The set alert volume mode allows the user to set the SPL level of the alert including silent mode and vibratory alerts.  The erase messages mode allows the user to delete unwanted messages from the memory of the pager.  The power off mode allows the user to manually switch the pager off.  The set alarm mode allows the user set the time that an alarm will sound. The set melody alert allows the user to choose from a set of predetermined alert melodies.  The auto/manual power mode allows the user to enable or disable the automatic time of day on/off functions.  The set auto power time mode enable the user to set the time at which the pager will automatically turn off or on. The set time of day mode allows the user to set the pager's time of day clock. The set read mode allows the user select the manner in which a message will be displayed, for example, line scrolling or character scrolling.  The chronograph mode allows the user to operate the stop watch functions of the pager. And, the set default mode allows the user to set the default values 42 of the menu items 40.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flowchart representing the operation of the mode selection aspects of pager in accord with the preferred embodiment of the present invention. In the idle state 50, display 22 is displaying default information such as the time of day in graphic display area 26 and pager status display area 24. In alternate embodiments the idle state display may be a set of dashes or a blank display in order to conserve additional power. This display is maintained until a first operation by the user of pressing<br>
mode switch 28, step 52. In step 54, the highest priority menu item is selected.  Referring to FIG. 2, column 46 shows that the "read messages" menu item has the highest priority, a priority of one.  Thus, the first menu item is selected in response to its priority. Then, step 56 displays in display area 26 the symbol corresponding to the selected menu item.  Referring to column 40, the symbol is the text "READ MESSAGES", alternately, a foreign language equivalents or icon could be displayed. Steps 60 and 62 wait for subsequent operations by the user of either pressing the select switch 30 or the mode switch 28.  Note that if neither of the switches are pressed after a predetermined time, the program returns to step 50 (not shown). If the mode switch is pressed, step 64 selects the next highest priority menu item, and step 56 displays its corresponding symbol. Referring to FIG. 2, the "protect messages" mode has the next highest priority of two. Then the graphic display area 26 will change from "READ MESSAGES" to "PROTECT MESSAGES". By these steps, a user is able to scroll down the list of menu items of column 40 in sequence with each press of the mode switch, the sequence of menu items is determined by the priority rating in column 46.  Note, the sequence loops back to the highest priority menu item after the lowest priority menu item is displayed (not shown).<br>
If the user presses the select switch 30, step 60 of FIG 3, then the frequency, column 44, of the mode corresponding to the displayed menu item will be incremented.  This corresponds to monitoring the selection of by the user of the plurality of operating modes. Note, if a frequency counter overflows, all counters can adjusted by dividing the values in the frequency counters by two (not shown).  Then step 68 re-prioritizes the menu items base upon the frequency of selection of each menu item, wherein the highest frequency of selection receives the highest priority and the lowest frequency of selection receives the lowest priority. If however any two frequencies are substantially equal, step 70, then step 72 re-prioritizes the substantially equal menu items according to the default values.  Substantially equal could be any value and may include a menu items having frequencies within 5% of each other.  Alternately, a hysterisis variable could be included to prevent menu items having substantially equal frequencies and selected at substantially equal rates from switching priority levels each time one or the other is selected.  After<br>
re-prioritization, step 74 changes the operating mode of the pager to correspond to the menu item which was displayed when the select button was pressed at step 60. Then, step 76 performs the selected mode.<br>
The re-prioritization aspects of the invention with respect to step 68 have the advantage of placing the menu items of the most frequently selected modes at the top of the list of menu items. Thus, the user is presented first with the menu items which the user is most likely to want to invoke.  For example, the user of the pager having a priority according to FIG. 2 frequently reads, protects and erases messages and sets the alert volume.  This reflects someone who would use a pager primarily for its messaging characteristics. Note, this user less frequently uses the alarm clock functions and infrequently uses the chronograph functions.   Thus, an new and unused pager begins with a default sequence of menu items, and after a time, the pager monitors the user's mode selection habits and presents the menu items in a sequence customized to the particular user. Other users may have more use for the alarm functions while still others may have more use for the chronograph functions.  After a time, each of these users will have a customized menu selection sequence with either the alarm or chronograph functions occurring earlier in the menu selection sequence.<br>
The re-prioritization aspects with respect to steps 70 and 72 resolve the problem of prioritizing menu items having a substantially equal frequency. For example and with reference to FIG. 2, while the frequency of the "erase messages" is slightly higher than the frequency of the "read messages", their frequencies are nevertheless substantially equal because they are within five percent of each other.  Consequently, the default column gives the "read messages" a higher priority even though its frequency is the lower of the two. Thus, the priority of these two is a function of both the frequency and the default columns.  Furthermore, step 70 and 72 can prevent rapid changing of the sequence menu items which have substantially the same frequency and are selected at substantially the same rate.  This may be accomplished with the aforementioned hysteresis.<br>
Still further, when a user receives a new pager, it will be programmed with a predetermined default list, column 42.  Also, the frequencies of the menu items, colunvn 44, may be set to zero, or to<br>
predetermined initial values.  If predetermined initial values were used, the frequency of the lowest default menu item (set default) could be set to five, with frequency increasing by five with each increasing default, thus giving the highest value default (read messages) an initial frequency setting of eighty.  The predetermined initial values may be factory set or reset by a user initialed operation.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a flowchart of the user selectable set default operation in accord with the preferred embodiment of the present invention.   The flow chart is entered at step 80, from step 76 of FIG. 2, if this mode is selected. Step 82 then selects the highest priority menu item and step 84 displays the symbol corresponding to the selected menu item. If select is pressed, step 86, then the default value of the selected menu item is decremented, step 88, and default value of the non-selected menu item is incremented.  This has the effect of advancing a selected menu item up the default list. If the mode switch is pressed, step 92, then the next highest priority menu item is selected, step 94. Step 96 exits if there have been no switch presses within a predetermined time, alternately step 84 displays the selected menu item.<br>
The flowchart of FIG. 4 shows how a user may set the default value of each menu item.  In an alternate embodiment where the frequency column 44, and the frequency re-prioritization aspects steps 66 and 68 are eliminated, the flowchart of FIG. 4 gives the advantage of allowing the user to completely select the sequence of menu items displayed on the pager.<br>
FIG. 5 shows a front view of a pager 20 operating in accord with an alternate embodiment of the present invention.  Items 20, 22, 28 and 30 have the same function as identically numbered items of FIG. 1.  Basically, graphic display area 126 corresponds to display area 26 of FIG. 1 but it has been expanded to include substantially all of LCD 22. Furthermore, areas of twelve icons, I-l to 1-12 are identified within display area 22.  The twelve icons correspond to menu items.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a table of menu items in accord with the alternate embodiment of the present invention.   Column 140 is a list of menu items from which the user may select an operating mode of the pager.  Column 142 represents the default priority assigned to each menu item which indicates the initial order of the menu item as well as identifying an icon<br>
indicative of the menu item.  For example 1-4 of FIG. 5 correspond to a icon of priority default 4, column 142, which is the set alert volume nienu item. The icon corresponding to the set alert volume could be a transducer with lines indicating variable volume levels.   Similarly, other menu items could have other icons commonly understood to represent the corresponding operating mode.  Coluntn 144 correspond to column 44 of FIG. 2 and represents the number of times a user has selected a particular operating mode of the pager.  Column 146 corresponds to column 46 of FIG. 2 and represents the priority of the menu item as it will be displayed in display area 26.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flowchart representing the operation of the mode selection aspects of pager in accord with the alternate embodiment of the present invention. Steps 50 to 52 and 60 to 76 correspond to identically numbered steps of FIG. 3. The operation is different with respect to placing icons within display area 126. Step 154 displays all icon symbols according to the priority of the corresponding menu item.  Then step 156 selects the highest priority menu item.  Step 158 highlights the selected menu item.  This may be done by underlining of flashing the selected menu item.  Similar to the flowchart of FIG. 3, menu items are highlighted by pressing of the mode switch 28, and modes are selected and re-prioritized by pressing the select switch 30.<br>
The alternate embodiment has the advantage of displaying a menu of a multiplicity of icons for mode selection of the pager, wherein the sequence of menu items is automatically custom.ized based upon the usage habits of the user.  For example, the menu item icon corresponding to the most frequently selected mode (read messages) is in the upper left portion of display area 126, with the next highest priority menu item icon (protect messages) immediately to its right, and so on in sequence until the lowest priority menu item (chronograph) is in the lower left portion of the display area 126.<br>
Thus, what is provided is a plurality of methods for automatically adjusting the sequence of menu items on an electronic device based upon the way the user uses the device.<br><br><br><br><br>
