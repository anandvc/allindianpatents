				<td>The present application is a divisional application of 2380/DEL/95.<br>
The present invention relates to intermediate compounds for the preparation of estrogen agonists/antagonists.<br>
BACKGROUND OE-THE INVENTION <br>
The  value  of naturally occurring  estrogens  and  synthetic  compositions demonstrating "estrogenic" activity has been in their medical and therapeutic uses. A traditional listing of the therapeutic applications for estrogens alone or in combination with other active agents includes: oral contraception; relief for the symptoms of menopause; prevention of threatened or habitual abortion; relief of dysmenorrhea; relief of dysfunctional uterine bleeding; an aid in ovarian development; treatment of acne; diminution of excessive growth of body hair in women (hirsutism); the prevention of cardiovascular disease; treatment of osteoporosis; treatment of prostatic carcinoma; and suppression of post-partum lactation [Goodman and Gilman, The Pharmacological Basis Of Therapeutics (Seventh Edition) Macmillan Publishing Company, 1985, pages 1421-1423].     Accordingly,  there  has  been  increasing  interest in  finding  newly synthesized compositions and new uses forpreviously known compounds which are demonstrably estrogenic, this is, able to mimic the action of estrogen in estrogen responsive tissue.<br>
From the viewpoint of pharmacologists interested in developing new drugs useful for the treatment of human diseases and specific pathological conditions, it is most important to procure compounds with some demonstrable estrogen-like function but which are devoid of proliferative side-effects. Exemplifying this latter view, osteoporosis, a disease in which bone becomes increasingly more fragile, is greatly ameliorated by the use of fully active estrogens;   however, due to the recognized increased risk of uterine cancer in patients chronically treated with active estrogens, it is not clinically advisable to treat osteoporosis in intact women with fully active estrogens for prolonged periods. Accordingly estrogen agonists are the primary interest and focus.<br>
Osteoporosis  is a systemic skeletal disease, characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. In the U.S., the condition affects more that 25 million people and causes more than 1.3 million fractures each year, including 500,000 spine, 250,000 hip and 240,000 wrist fractures annually. These cost the nation over $10 billion.  Hip<br>
fractures are the most serious, with 5-20% of patients dying within one year, and over 50% of survivors being incapacitated.<br>
The elderly are at greatest risk of osteoporosis, and the problem is therefore predicted to increase significantly with the aging of the population. Worldwide fracture incidence is forecast to increase three-fold over the next 60 years, and one study estimates that there will be 4.5 million hip fractures worldwide in 2050.<br>
Women are at greater risk of osteoporosis than men. Women experience a sharp acceleration of bone loss during the five years following menopause. Other factors that increase the risk include smoking, alcohol abuse, a sedentary lifestyle and low calcium intake.<br>
Estrogen is the agent of choice in preventing osteoporosis or post menopausal bone loss in women; it is the only treatment which unequivocally reduces fractures. However, estrogen stimulates the uterus and is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Although the risk of endometrial cancer is thought to be reduced by a concurrent use of a progestogen, there is still concern about possible increased risk of breast cancer with the use of estrogen.<br>
Black, et al. in EP 0605193A1 report that estrogen, particularly when taken orally, lowers plasma levels of LDL and raises those of the beneficial high density lipoproteins (HDL's).   Long-term estrogen therapy, however, has been implicated in a variety of disorders, including an increase in the risk of uterine cancer and possibly breast cancer, causing many women to avoid this treatment.    Recently suggested therapeutic regimens, which seek to lessen the cancer risk, such as administering combinations   of   progestogen   and   estrogen,   cause   the   patient   to   experience unacceptable bleeding. Furthermore, combining progesterone with estrogen seems to blunt the serum cholesterol lowering effects of estrogen.   The significant undesirable effects associated with estrogen therapy support the need to develop alternative therapies for hypercholesterolemia that have the desirable effect on serum LDL but do not cause undesirable effects.<br>
There is a need for improved estrogen agonists which exert selective effects on different tissues in the body. Tamoxifen, 1-(4-l3-dimethylaminoethoxyphenyl)-1,2-diphenyl-but-1-ene, is an antiestrogen which has a palliative effect on breast cancer, but is reported to have estrogenic activity in the uterus. Gill-Sharma, et al., J. Reproduction<br><br>
and Fertility (1993) 99, 395, disclose that tamoxifen at 200 and 400 mg/kg/day reduces the weights of the testes and secondary sex organs in male rats.<br>
Recently it has been reported (Osteoporosis Conference Scrip No. 1812/13 April 16/20, 1993, p. 29) that raloxifene, 6-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-[4-(2-piperidinoethoxy) benzoyl] benzo[b] thiophene, mimics the favorable action of estrogen on bone and lipids but, unlike estrogen, has minimal uterine stimulatory effect. (Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 10(1). 1987 p 31-36 Jordan, V.C. et al.).<br>
Neubauer, et al., The Prostate 23:245 (1993) teach that raloxifene treatment of male rats produced regression of the ventral prostate.<br>
Raloxifene and related compounds are described as antiestrogen and antiandrogenic materials which are effective in the treatment of certain mammary and prostate cancers. See United States Patent 4,418,068 and Charles D. Jones, et al., J_. Med. Chem. 1984. 27, 1057-1066.<br>
Jones, et al in U.S. Patent 4,133,814 describe derivatives of 2-phenyl-3-aroyl-benzothiophene and 2-phenyl-3-aroylbenzothiophene-1-oxides which are useful as antifertility agents as well as suppressing the growth of mammary tumors.<br>
Lednicer, et al., J. Med. Chem., 12. 881 (1969) described estrogen antagonists of the structure<br>
(Figure Remove) wherein R2 is phenyl or cyclopentyl and R3 is H,<br>
Benzene, et al., J. Med. Chem., 10, 138 (1967) prepared a series of tetrahydronaphthalenes intended to achieve separation of estrogenic, antifertility and hypocholesterolemic activities. These structures are the general formula<br>
(Figure Remove) wherein R1 is H or OCH3; R2 is H, OH, OCH3, OPO(OC2H5)2, OCH2CH2N(C2H5)2, OCH2COOH or OCH(CH3) COOH.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,234,090 refers to compounds which have estrogenic and antifungal properties of the formula<br>
(Figure Remove) in which Ph is a 1,2-phenylene radical, Ar is a monocyclic carbocyclic aryl group substituted by tertiary amino-lower alkyl-oxy, in which tertiary amino is separated from oxy by at least two carbon atoms, R is hydrogen, an aliphatic radical, a carbocyclic aryl radical, a carbocyclic aryl-aliphatic radical, a heterocyclic aryl radical or a heterocyclic aryl aliphatic radical, the group of the formula -(CnH2n.2)- stands for an unbranched alkylene radical having from three to five carbon atoms and carrying the groups Ar and R, salts, N-oxides, salts of N-oxides or quaternary ammonium compounds thereof, as well as procedure for the preparation of such compounds.<br>
U.S.    Patent    No.    3,277,106    refers    to    basic    ethers    with    estrogenic, hypocholesterolemic and antifertility effects which are of the formula<br>
(Figure Remove) in which Ph is a 1,2-phenylene radical, Ar is a monocyclic aryl radical substituted by at least one amino-lower alkyl-oxy group in which the nitrogen atom is separated from the oxygen atom by at least two carbon atoms, R is an aryl radical, and the portion -(CnH2n.2)- stands for lower alkylene forming with Ph a six- or seven-membered ring, two of the ring carbon atoms thereof carry the groups Ar and R, salts, N-oxides, salts of N-oxides and quaternary ammonium compounds thereof.<br>
Lednicer, et al., in J. Med. Chem. 10, 78 (1967) and in United States Patent No. 3,274,213 refer to compounds of the formula<br>
(Figure Remove) wherein R, and R2 are selected from the class consisting of lower alkyl and lower alkyl linked together to form a 5 to 7 ring member saturated heterocyclic radical.<br>

The remedies for prostatic diseases, breast cancer, obesity, cardiovascular disease, hypercholesterolemia and osteoporosis of this invention can be prepared by the methods commonly employed using conventional, organic or inorganic additives, such as an excipient (e.g., sucrose, starch, mannitol, sorbitol, lactose, glucose, cellulose, talc, calcium phosphate or calcium carbonate), a binder (e.g., cellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, polypropylpyrrolidone, polyvinylprrolidone, gelatin, gum arabic, polyethyleneglycol, sucrose or starch), a disintegrator (e.g., starch, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylstarch, low substituted hydroxypropylcellulose, sodium   bicarbonate,   calcium   phosphate   or  calcium   citrate),   a   lubricant   (e.g., magnesium stearate, light anhydrous silicic acid, talc or sodium lauryl sulfate), a flavoring agent (e.g., citric acid, menthol, glycine or orange powder), a preservative (e.g., sodium benzoate, sodium bisulfite, methylparaben or propylparaben), a stabilizer (e.g.,   citric   acid,   sodium   citrate   or   acetic   acid),   a   suspending   agent   (e.g., methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone or aluminum stearate), a dispersing agent (e.g., hydroxypropylmethylcellulose), a diluent (e.g., water), and base wax (e.g., cocoa butter, white petrolatum or polyethylene glycol).   The amount of the active ingredient in the medical composition may be at a level that will exercise the desired therapeutical effect; for example, about 0.1 mg to 50 mg in unit dosage for both oral and parenteral administration.<br>
The active ingredient may be usually administered once to four times a day with a unit dosage of 0.1 mg to 50 mg in human patients, but the above dosage may be properly varied depending on the age, body weight and medical condition of the patient<br><br>
and the type of administration.   A preferred dose is 0.25 mg to 25 mg in human patients.   One dose per day is preferred.<br>
Compounds of this invention are readily prepared by the reactions illustrated in the schemes below.<br>
Certain compounds of formula I are conveniently prepared from an unsaturated intermediate<br><br>
(Figure Remove) by hydrogenation with a noble metal catalyst in a reaction inert solvent. Pressure and temperatures are not critical and hydrogenation is normally accomplished in a few hours at room temperatures at 20-80 psi hydrogen pressure.<br>
The hydrogenated product is isolated, purified if desired, and the ether group is cleaved with an acidic catalyst in a reaction inert solvent at a temperature between 0°C to 100°C depending on the acidic catalyst used . Hydrogen bromide at elevated temperatures, boron tribromide and aluminum chloride at 0°C to ambient temperature have been found to be effective for this reaction.<br>
The product, Formula I is isolated and purified by standard procedures.<br>
Intermediates of Formula II where A is CH2, and B, D and E are CH are described in U.S. patent 3,274,213; J. Med. Chem 10, 78 (1967); J. Med. Chem 10, 138 (1967); and J. Med. Chem. 12, 881 (1969), the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. They can also be prepared by procedures described below.<br>
The preparation of the compounds of Formula I where e=1, A=CH2, Z1=OCH2CH2, G= cycloalkylamine, B=CH is shown in Scheme 1. Compounds 1-2, where D and E are CH are made by alkylation of 4-bromophenol with the corresponding N-chloroethylamine using potassium carbonate as base in a polar aprotic solvent like dimethylformamide at elevated temperatures. A preferred temperature is 100°C. Compounds 1-2 where D or E or both are N are synthesized<br><br>
using a nucleophilic displacement reaction performed on dibromides (1-1) using hydroxy ethyl cycloalkylamines under phase transfer conditions to afford bromo amines (1-2).    Synthesis, 77, 573 (1980).    Following halogen metal exchange using n-butyllithium or magnesium metal, bromo amines (1-2) yield the corresponding lithium or magnesium reagents which are allowed to react at low temperature in the presence of cesium chloride preferably (without cesium chloride the reaction also proceeds) with 6-methoxy-1 -tetralone to afford either carbinols (1-3) or styrenes (1-4) after acidic workup. Treatment of either carbinols (1-3) or styrenes (1-4) with a brominating agent such as pyridinium bromide perbromide affords bromo styrenes (1-5). Aryl or heteroaryl zinc chlorides or aryl or heteroaryl boronic acids react with bromides (1-5) in the presence of a palladium metal catalyst like tetrakis triphenyl phosphine palladium (0) to yield diaryl styrenes (1-6).   [Pure &amp; Applied Chem. 63, 419,(1991) and Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 61, 3008-3010, (1988)] To prepare the preferred compounds the substituted phenyl zinc chlorides or substituted phenylboronic acids are used in this reaction. The aryl zinc chlorides are prepared by quench of the corresponding lithium reagent with anhydrous zinc chloride.  The aryl boronic acids, that are not commercially available, are prepared by quenching the corresponding aryl lithium reagent with trialkyl borate, preferably the trimethyl or triisopropyl borate, followed by aqueous acid workup. Acta Chemica Scan. 47, 221-230 (1993).   The lithium reagents that are not commercially available are prepared by halogen metal exchange of the corresponding bromide or halide with n-butyl or t-butyllithium.   Alternately, the lithium reagent is prepared by heteroatom facilitated lithiations as described in Organic Reactions, Volume 27, Chapter 1.  Catalytic hydrogenation of 1-6 in the presence of palladium hydroxide on charcoal, for example, affords the corresponding dihydro methoxy intermediates which were subsequently demethylated using boron tribromide at 0°C in methylene chloride or 48% hydrogen bromide in acetic acid at 80-100°C to afford target structures (1-7). These compounds are racemic and can be resolved into the enantiomers via high pressure liquid chromatography using a column with a chiral stationary phase like the Chiralcel   OD  columns.     Alternately  optical   resolution   can   be   carried   out   by recrystaliization of the diastereomeric salts formed with optically pure acids like 1,1'-binapthyl-2,2'-diyl hydrogen phosphate (see Example 8).<br>
The cis compounds (1-7) can be isomerized to the trans compounds on treatment with base (see Example 2).<br><br>
When D and/or E is nitrogen the intermediates (Formula II) and compounds of Formula I may be prepared from the corresponding dihalopyridines or pyrimidines as illustrated in Scheme 1 and as fully described for 6-phenyl-5-[6-(2-pyrrolidin-1 -yl-ethoxy) pyridin-3-yl]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol in Example 6.<br>
The methyl ether of the compound of Formula I where e=1, A=CH2, Z'=OCH2CH2, G= pyrrolidine, D,E, B=CH, Y=Ph can also be conveniently prepared by a first step of hydrogenation of nafoxidine (Upjohn &amp; Co., 700 Portage Road, Kalamazoo, Ml 49001) in a reaction inert solvent in the presence of a nobel metal catalyst. Pressure and temperature are not critical; the reaction is conveniently run in ethanol at room temperature for approximately 20 hours at 50 psi.<br>
The second step is cleavage of the methoxy group which is accomplished conveniently at room temperature with an acidic catalyst such as boron tribromide in a reaction inert solvent or at 80-100°C with hydrogen bromide in acetic acid. The product is then isolated by conventional methods and converted to an acid salt if desired.<br>
(Figure Remove) Compounds of formula I wherein B is nitrogen are prepared by the procedures illustrated in Scheme 2 and 3 and Examples 3-5 and 10-12.<br>
The synthesis of compounds of Formula I where B=N is shown in Scheme 2. Aryl acid chlorides (2-1) on treatment with primary amines afford aryl secondary amides (2-2), which are reduced with lithium aluminum hydride in ethereal solvents to yield secondary amines (2-3). Subsequent acylation of (2-3) with aroyl acid chlorides leads to tertiary amides (2-4), which are cyclized in hot phosphorus oxychloride to yield dihydro isoquinolinium salts (2-5). Reduction with sodium borohydride to alkoxytetrahydro isoquinolines; followed by boron tribromide demethylation in methylene chloride affords the target structures.<br>
(Figure Remove) The synthesis of the compounds of Formula I where B=N is also described below in Scheme 3. Secondary amines (3-1) on acylation with benzyloxyaroyi chlorides (3-2) afford tertiary amides (3-3) which on cyclization with hot phosphorous oxychloride yield dihydro isoquinoline salts (3-4). Sodium borohydride reduction of (3-4) followed by debenzylation with aqueous hydrochloric acid affords isoquinolines (3-5), which are<br><br>
alkylated with the appropriately functionalized chlorides and demethylated with boron tribromide to yield the desired target structures.<br>
(Figure Remove) The   compounds   of  this   invention   are  valuable   estrogen   agonists   and pharmaceutical agents or intermediates thereto.  Those which are estrogen agonists are useful for oral contraception; relief for the symptoms of menopause; prevention of threatened or habitual abortion; relief of dysmenorrhea; relief of dysfunctional uterine bleeding; relief of endometriosis; an aid in ovarian development; treatment of acne; diminution of excessive growth of body hair in women (hirsutism); the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease; prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis; prevention and treatment of osteoporosis; treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic carcinoma obesity; and suppression of post-partum lactation. These agents also have a beneficial effect on plasma lipid levels and as such are useful in treating and preventing hypercholesterolemia.<br>
While the compounds of this invention are estrogen agonists in bone, they are also antiestrogens in breast tissue and as such would be useful in the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. Control and Prevention of Endometriosis<br>
The protocol for surgically inducing endometriosis is identical to that described by Jones, Acta Endoerinol (Copenh) 106:282-8. Adult Charles River Sprague-Dawley CD® female rats (200-240 g) are used. An oblique ventral incision is made through the skin and musculature of the body wall. A segment of the right uterine horn is excised, the myometrium is separated from the endometrium, and the segment is cut longitudinally. A 5x5 mm section of the endometrium, with the epithelial lining appoted to the body wall, is sutured at its four corners to the muscle using polyester braid (Ethiflex, 7-0®). The criterion of a viable graft is the accumulation of fluid similar to that which occurs in the uterus as a result of oestrogen stimulation.<br>
Three weeks after transplantation of the endometrial tissue (+3 weeks) the animals are laparotomized, the volume of the explant (length x width x height) in mm was measured with calipers, and treatment is begun. The animals are injected sc for 3 weeks with 10 to 1000 //g/kg/day of a compound of Formula I. Animals bearing endometrial explants are injected sc with 0.1 ml/day of corn oil for 3 weeks served as controls. At the end of 3 week treatment period (+6 weeks), the animals are laparotomized and the volume of the explant determined. Eight weeks after cessation of treatment (+14 weeks) the animals are sacrificed; the explant are measured again. Statistical analysis of the explant volume is by an analysis of variance.<br><br>
Effect on Prostate Weight<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats, three months of age are administered by subcutaneous injection either vehicle (10% ethanol in water), estradiol (30//g/kg), testosterone (1 mg/kg) or a compound of formula I daily for 14 days (n=6/group). After i 14 days the animals are sacrificed, the prostate is removed and the wet prostate weight is determined. Mean weight is determined and statistical significance (p

Bone mineral density, a measure of bone mineral content, accounts for greater than 80% of a bone's strength.  Loss of bone mineral density with age and/or disease reduces a bone's strength and renders it more prone to fracture. Bone mineral content is accurately measured in people and animals by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) such that changes as little as 1% can be quantified.  We have utilized DEXA to evaluate changes in bone mineral density due to estrogen deficiency following ovariectomy (surgical removal of ovaries) and treatment with vehicle, estradiol (E2), keoxifen (raloxifen), or other estrogen agonists. The purpose of these studies is to evaluate the ability of the compounds of this invention to prevent estrogen deficiency bone loss as measured by DEXA.<br>
Female (S-D) rats 4-6 months of age undergo bilateral ovariectomy or sham surgery and allowed to recover from anesthesia. Rats are treated by s.c. injection or oral gavage with various doses (10-1000 //g/kg/day, for example) of compound of Formula I daily for 28 days. All compounds are weighed and dissolved in 10% ethanol in sterile saline. After 28 days the rats are killed and femora removed and defleshed. The femoral are positioned on a Hologic QDR1000W (Hologic, Inc. Waltham, MA) and bone mineral density is determined in the distal portion of the femur at a site from 1cm to 2cm from the distal end of the femur using the high resolution software supplied by Hologic. Bone mineral density is determined by dividing the bone mineral content by the bone area of the distal femur. Each group contains at least 6 animals. Mean bone mineral density is obtained for each animal and statistical differences (p

In vitro estrogen receptor binding assay<br>
An in vitro estrogen receptor binding assay, which measures the ability of the compounds of the present invention to displace [3H]-estradiol from human estrogen receptor obtained by recombinant methods in yeast, is used to determine the estrogen receptor binding affinity of the compounds of this invention. The materials used in this assay are: (1) Assay buffer, TD-0.3 (containing 10 nM Tris, pH 7.6, 0.3 M potassium chloride and 5 mM DTT, pH 7.6); (2) The radioligand used is [3H]-estradiol obtained from New England Nuclear; (3) the cold ligand used is estradiol obtained from Sigma (4) recombinant human estrogen receptor, hER.<br>
A solution of the compound being tested is prepared in TD-0.3 with 4% DMSO and 16% ethanol. The tritiated estradiol is dissolved in TD-0.3 such that the final concentration in the assay was 5nM. The hER is also diluted with TD-0.3 such that 4-10<br>
//g of total protein was in each assay well.   Using microtitre plates, each incubate received 50 ul of cold estradiol (nonspecific binding) or the compound solution, 20 uL<br>
of the tritiated estradiol and 30 ul of hER solutions.   Each plate contains in triplicate total binding and varying concentrations of the compound.  The plates are incubated overnight at 4°C. The binding reaction is then terminated by the addition and mixing of 100 ml of 3% hydroxylapatite in 10 mM tris, pH 7.6 and incubation for 15 minutes at 4°C.  The mixtures is centrifuged and the pellet washed four times with 1% Triton-X100 in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6.  The hydroxylapatite pellets are suspended in Ecoscint A and radioactivity is assessed using beta scintigraphy.   The mean of all triplicate data points (counts per minute, cpm's) is determined.   Specific binding is calculated by subtracting nonspecific cpm's (defined as counts that remain following separation of reaction mixture containing recombinant receptor,   radioligand, and excess unlabeled ligand) from total bound cpm's (defined as counts that remain following the separation of reaction mixture containing only recombinant receptor, radioligand).   Compound potency is determined by means of IC50 determinations (the concentration of a compound needed to inhibition 50% of the of the total specific tritiated estradiol bound). Specific binding in the presence of varying concentrations of compound is determined and calculated as percent specific binding of total specific radioligand bound. Data are plotted   as   percent   inhibition   by   compound   (linear   scale)   versus   compound concentration (log scale).<br><br>
Effect on total cholesterol levels<br>
The effect of the compounds of the present invention on plasma levels of total cholesterol is measured in the following way. Blood samples are collected via cardiac puncture from anesthetized female (S-D) rats 4-6 months of age that are bilaterally ovariectomized and treated with the compound (10-1000 //g/kg/day, for example, sc or orally for 28 days or with vehicle for the same time), or sham operated.  The blood is placed in a tube containing 30//L of 5% EDTA (10//L EDTA/1 mL of blood).   After centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes at 20°C the plasma is removed and stored at -20°C unit assay.   The total cholesterol is assayed using a standard enzymatic determination kit from Sigma Diagnostics (Procedure No. 352).  Effect on obesity<br>
Sprague-Dawley female rats at 10 months of age, weighing approximately 450 grams, are sham-operated (sham) or ovariectomized (OVX) and treated orally with vehicle, 17a ethynyl estradiol at 30//g/kg/day or a compound of formula I at 10-1000<br>
//g/kg/day for 8 weeks. There are 6 to 7 rats in each sub group. On the last day of the study,   body  composition   of  all   rats   is   determined   using   dual   energy  x-ray<br>
abosorptiometry (Hologic QDR-1000/W) equipped with whole body scan software which shows the proportions of fat body mass and lean body mass.<br>
A decrease in fat body mass indicates that the estrogen agonists of formula I are useful in preventing and treating obesity.<br>
Pharmaceutical chemists will easily recognize that physiologically active compounds which have accessible hydroxy groups are frequently administered in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable esters. The literature concerning such compounds, such as estradiol, provides a great number of instances of such esters. The compounds of this invention are no exception in this respect, and can be effectively administered as an ester, formed on the hydroxy groups, just as one skilled in pharmaceutical chemistry would expect. While the mechanism has not yet been investigated, it is believed that esters are metabolically cleaved in the body, and that the actual drug, which such form is administered, is the hydroxy compound itself. It is possible, as has long been known in pharmaceutical chemistry, to adjust the rate or duration of action of the compound by appropriate choices of ester groups.<br>
Certain ester groups are preferred as constituents of the compounds of this invention. The compounds of formula I may contain ester groups at various portions as defined herein above, where these groups are represented as -COOR9. R9 is C,-C14<br><br>
alkyl, C,-C3 chloroalkyl, CrC3 fluoroalkyl, C5-C7 cycloalkyl, CrC4 alkoxy, phenyl, or phenyl mono- or disubstituted with C,^ alkyl, C,-C4 alkoxy, hydroxy, nitro, chloro, fluoro or tri(chloro or fluoro)methyl.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of this invention may be formed of the compound itself, or of any of its esters, and include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts which are often used in pharmaceutical chemistry. For example, salts may be formed with inorganic or organic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfonic acids including such agents as naphthalenesulfonic, methanesulfonic and toluenesulfonic acids, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, tartaric acid, pyrosulfuric acid, metaphosphoric acid, succinic acid,  formic acid,  phthalic acid,  lactic acid  and the  like,  most preferable with hydrochloric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, maleic acid, acetic acid and propionic acid. It is usually preferred to administer a compound of this invention in the form of an acid addition salt, as it is customary in the administration of Pharmaceuticals bearing a basic group such as the pyrrolidino ring.<br>
The compounds of this invention, as discussed above, are very often administered in the form of acid addition salts. The salts are conveniently formed, as is usual in organic chemistry, by reacting the compound of this invention with a suitable acid, such as have been described above. The salts are quickly formed in high yields at moderate temperatures, and often are prepared by merely isolating the compound from a suitable acidic wash as the final step of the synthesis. The salt-forming acid is dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent, or aqueous organic solvent, such as an alkanol, ketone or ester. On the other hand, if the compound of this invention is desired in the free base form, it is isolated from a basic final wash step, according to the usual practice. A preferred technique for preparing hydrochlorides is to dissolve the free base in a suitable solvent and dry the solution thoroughly, as over molecular sieves, before bubbling hydrogen chloride gas through it.<br>
The dose of a compound of this invention to be administered to a human is rather widely variable and subject to the judgement of the attending physician. It should be noted that it may be necessary to adjust the dose of a compound when it is administered in the form of a salt, such as a laureate, the salt forming moiety of which has an appreciable molecular weight. The general range of effective administration rates of the compounds is from about 0.05 mg/day to about 50 mg/day.<br><br>
A preferred rate range is from about 0.25 mg/day to 25 mg/day. Of course, it is often practical to administer the daily dose of compound in portions, at various hours of the day. However, in any given case, the amount of compound administered will depend on such factors as the solubility of the active component, the formulation used and the route of administration.<br>
The route of administration of the compounds of this invention is not critical. The compounds are known to be absorbed from the alimentary tract, and so it is usually preferred to administer a compound orally for reasons of convenience. However, the compounds may equally effectively be administered percutaneously, or as suppositories for absorption by the rectum, if desired in a given instance.<br>
The compounds of this invention are usually administered as pharmaceutical compositions which are important and novel embodiments of the invention because of the presence of the compounds. All of the usual types of compositions may be used, including tablets, chewable tablets, capsules, solutions, parenteral solutions, troches, suppositories and suspensions. Compositions are formulated to contain a daily dose, or a convenient fraction of daily dose, in a dosage unit, which may be a single tablet or capsule or convenient volume of a liquid.<br>
Any of the compounds may be readily formulated as tablets, capsules and the like; it is preferable to prepare solutions from water-soluble salts, such as the hydrochloride salt.<br>
In general, all of the compositions are prepared according to methods usual in pharmaceutical chemistry.<br>
Capsules are prepared by mixing the compound with a suitable diluent and filling the proper amount of the mixture in capsules.  The usual diluents include inert powdered substances such as starch of many different kinds, powdered cellulose, especially crystalline and microcrystalline cellulose, sugars such as fructose, rnannitol and sucrose, grain flours and similar edible powders.<br>
Tablets are prepared by direct compression, by wet granulation, or by dry granulation. Their formulations usually incorporate diluents, binders, lubricants and disintegrators as well as the compound. Typical diluents include, for example, various types of starch, lactose, rnannitol, kaolin, calcium phosphate or sulfate, inorganic salts such as sodium chloride and powdered sugar. Powdered cellulose derivatives are also useful. Typical tablet binders are substances such as starch, gelatin and sugars such<br><br>
as lactose, fructose, glucose and the like. Natural and synthetic gums are also convenient, including acacia, alginates, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine and the like. Polyethylene glycol, ethylcellulose and waxes can also serve as binders.<br>
A lubricant is necessary in a tablet formulation to prevent the tablet and punches from sticking in the die. The lubricant is chosen from such slippery solids as talc, magnesium and calcium stearate, stearic acid and hydrogenated vegetable oils.<br>
Tablet disintegrators are substances which swell when wetted to break up the tablet and release the compound. They include starches, clays, celluloses, algins and gums. More particularly, corn and potato starches, methylcellulose, agar, bentonite, wood cellulose, powdered natural sponge, cation-exchange resins, alginic acid, guar gum, citrus pulp and carboxymethylcellulose, for example, may be used as well as sodium lauryl sulfate.<br>
Tablets are often coated with sugar as a flavor and sealant, or with film-forming protecting agents to modify the dissolution properties of the tablet. The compounds may also be formulated as chewable tablets, by using large amounts of pleasant-tasting substances such as mannitol in the formulation, as is now well-established in the art. When it is desired to administer a compound as a suppository, the typical bases may be used. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, which may be modified by addition of waxes to raise its melting point slightly. Water-miscible suppository bases comprising, particularly, polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights are in wide use.<br>
The effect of the compounds may be delayed or prolonged by proper formulation. For example, a slowly soluble pellet of the compound may be prepared and incorporated in a tablet or capsule. The technique may be improved by making pellets of several different dissolution rates and filling capsules with a mixture of the pellets. Tablets or capsules may be coated with a film which resists dissolution for a predictable period of time. Even the parenteral preparations may be made long-acting, by dissolving or suspending the compound in oily or emulsified vehicles which allow it to disperse only slowly in the serum.<br>
The following examples will serve to illustrate, but do not limit, the invention which is defined by the claims.<br><br>

1 g of 1-[4'-piperidino ethoxy phenyl]-2-[4"-fluoro phenyl]-6-methoxy-3,4-dihydronaphthalene (which can be made as in Example 1 but replacing phenylboronic acid in Step C with 4-fluorophenylboronic acid) in 35 ml acetic acid was added palladium hydroxide on carbon (20%, 1g)(flame dried irvvacuo).  The mixture was hydrogenated on a Parr shaker at 50°C and 50 psi for 4 hours. Filtration through Celite and concentration yielded 1.2 g of crude reaction product which was used without further purification in the next step.<br><br>
1H-NMR (250 MHz, CDCI3): 6 1.9 (m), 3.1 (m), 3.25 (m), 3.8 (s, 3H), 4.2 (d, 1H), 4.25 (bd), 6.35 (d, 2H), 6.5 (d, 2H), 6.65 (m), 6.75 (m), 6.8-6.88 (m). m/2460 (M+1)<br>
Step B<br>
A solution of cis-1-[4'-piperidinoethoxy phenyl]-2-[4"-fluoro phenyl]-6-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro naphthalene-1-yl] phenoxy}-ethyl)-piperidine (540 mg, 1.17 mmol) in anhydrous CH2CI2 was cooled to 0°C followed by the addition of BBr3 [5.8 ml (1 M solution in CH2CI2), 5.88 mmol] dropwise.  The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for another hour. After the reaction was complete, the reaction was cooled back to 0°C and aqueous NaHCO3 was carefully added. The aqueous layer was extracted with CH2CI2 (3x).  The organic layer was dried over MgS04, filtered and concentrated. The crude product was radially chromatographed (solvent 4:1 ether /hexane, 1% triethylamine) to provide the deprotected product. The HCI salt product was form with 1M HCI/Ether solution followed by trituration with EtOAc/THF to provide 126 mg of product.   'H NMR (250MHz, CDCI3): 6 6.80 (m,4H), 6.63 (m, 4H), 6.50 (dd, 1H), 6.40 (d, 2H), 4.22 (dd, 3H), 3.72 (m, 2H), 3,48 (dd, 2H), 3.0 (bm, 2H), 1.83 (m, 9H).    m/z 446 (M + 1)<br>
EXAMPLE 8 (-)Cis-6-phenvl-5-r4-(2-pvrrolidin-1-yl-ethoxv)phenvn-<br>
5.6.7.8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol<br>
The racemic compound of Example 1 (3 g) was subjected to enantiomeric separation on a 5 cm x 5 cm Chiralcell OD column employing 99.95% (5% EtOH/95% heptane)/0.05% diethylamine as the element to afford 1 g of a fast eluting (+) enantiomer and 1 g of a slow (-) eluting enantiomer, both of which possessed identical NMR, MS and TLC behavior as the racemate.  Alternatively, a crystallization procedure using R-binap phosphoric acid can be employed to effect resolution. In 20 ml of methanol and 20 ml of methylene chloride was added 7.6g (0.0184 mol) of the product of Example 1 and 6.4g (0.0184 mol) of R-(-)-1, 1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-diyl hydrogen phosphate.  After solution was complete, evaporation of solvent followed by trituration with ether afforded 14.2g of racemic salt. This solid was slurried in 500 ml of dioxane and 25 ml of methanol and the resulting mixture was heated until the initial solid dissolved.  On standing for 1 hour, a white precipitate formed (6.8 g) which was collected and which HPLC (using the conditions above) indicated to be<br><br><br>
approximately 73% enantiomerically pure.  This material was slurried in 250 ml of absolute ethanol and heated until solution was achieved, at which time the solution was allowed to stand at room temperature overnight.  The collected crystals were washed with cold ethanol followed by ether to afford 3.1 g of 98% enantiomerically pure salt; a second crop of 588 mg was also obtained.  Partitioning between 1 : 2 methanol/methylene chloride and 1% aqueous sodium hydroxide afforded the corresponding free base which was converted to the hydrochloride salt (HCI in dioxane).  Recrystallization from acetonitrile/methylene chloride afforded the levorotatory preferred enantiomer hydrochloride corresponding to Example 1.    [crD -330.6 (c=0.05,CH2CI2];  mp 260-263°C.<br>
