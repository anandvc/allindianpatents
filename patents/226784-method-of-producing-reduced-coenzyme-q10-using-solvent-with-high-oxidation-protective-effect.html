METHOD OF PRODUCING REDUCED COENZYME Q10 USING SOLVENT WITH HIGH<br>
OXIDATION-PROTECTIVE EFFECT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method of synthesizing<br>
and a method of crystallizing reduced coenzyme Q10. Reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 shows a higher level of oral absorbability as<br>
compared with oxidized coenzyme Q10 and is a compound useful<br>
as an ingredient in good foods, functional nutritive foods,<br>
specific health foods, nutritional supplements, nutrients,<br>
drinks, feeds, animal drugs, cosmetics, medicines, remedies,<br>
preventive drugs, etc.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Oxidized coenzyme Q10, which is a benzoquinone derivative<br>
widely distributed in the biological world, is also called<br>
vitamin Q because of its vitamin-like function and is an<br>
ingredient acting as a nutrient in restoring the cell activity<br>
that has been weakened to its healthy condition and rejuvenating<br>
the body. On the other hand, reduced coenzyme Q10, which is<br>
derived from oxidized coenzyme Q10 by two-electron reduction,<br>
is as white crystals as compared with oxidized coenzyme Q10 being<br>
as orange-colored crystals. Reduced coenzyme Q10 and oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q10 are known to be localized in the mitochondrion,<br>
lysosome, Golgi body, microsome, peroxisome, and cell membrane,<br>
among others, and involved, as constituents of the electron<br>
transport system, in ATP production and activation, in vivo<br>
antioxidant activity, and membrane stabilization; they are thus<br>
substances indispensable for body function maintenance.<br>
It is known that reduced coenzyme Q10 can be prepared by<br>
producing coenzyme Q10 in the conventional manner, for example<br>
by synthesis, fermentation, or extraction from natural products,<br>
and concentrating a reduced coenzyme Q10-containing eluate<br><br>
fraction resulting from chromatography (JP-A-10-109933). On<br>
that occasion, as described in the above-cited publication, the<br>
chromatographic concentration may be carried cut after<br>
reduction of oxidized coenzyme Q10 contained in the reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 with a conventional reducing agent such as sodium<br>
borohydride or sodium dithionite (sodium hyposulfite), or<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 may be prepared by reacting the reducing<br>
agent mentioned above with an existing highly pure grade of<br>
coenzyme Q10 (oxidized form). However, the thus-obtained<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 cannot always be in a highly pure state<br>
but tends to occur as a low-purity crystalline, semisolid, or<br>
oily product containing such impurities as oxidized coenzyme<br>
Q10.<br>
JP-A-57-70834 discloses an example in which reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 was synthesized by dissolving coenzyme Q10 in hexane<br>
and adding an aqueous solution of sodium hydrosulfite (sodium<br>
hyposulfite) to the solution, followed by stirring. However,<br>
sodium dithionite was used as a reducing agent in an amount<br>
as large as twice the weight of coenzyme Q10. Thus, such method<br>
of synthesis has problems from the economical viewpoint as well<br>
as complexity viewpoint of the subsequent purification<br>
procedure.<br>
Reduced coenzyme Q10 is readily oxidized to oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q10 by molecular oxygen. On a commercial<br>
production scale, complete oxygen elimination is very<br>
difficult to achieve and, furthermore, fairly long periods<br>
of time are required for individual operations, unlike<br>
laboratory scale production, so that residual oxygen exerts<br>
a great adverse effect. The oxidation in question is<br>
directly connected with such yield and quality problems as<br>
the formation of hardly eliminable oxidized coenzyme Q10<br>
and adulteration of the product therewith. For obtaining<br>
highly pure reduced coenzyme Q10 in the form of crystals,<br>
it is important to adequately protect, the reduced form from<br>
the oxidation mentioned above.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the foregoing, the present invention has an<br>
object to provide a convenient and efficient method of<br>
synthesizing and of crystallizing high-quality reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10. Furthermore, the present invention has another<br>
object to provide an outstanding method for obtaining<br>
high-quality reduced coenzyme Q10 in the form of crystals which<br>
is suited for the production thereof on a commercial scale.<br>
The present inventors made intensive investigations, and<br>
as a result, found that when placed in a specific solvent,<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 is favorably protected from oxidation by<br>
molecular oxygen and, based on this finding, they have completed<br>
the present invention.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a method of<br>
producing reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
which comprises using at least one species selected from<br>
among hydrocarbons exclusive of hexane, fatty acid esters,<br>
ethers and nitriles as a solvent in synthesizing reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 by reduction of oxidized coenzyme Q10<br>
The invention also provides a method for producing<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
which comprises using a hydrocarbon as a solvent in a<br>
deoxygenated atmosphere in synthesizing reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
by reduction of oxidized coenzyme Q10.<br>
The invention further provides a method for crystallizing<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10,<br>
which comprises crystallizing the reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
using, as a solvent, at least one species selected from the group<br>
consisting of hydrocarbons, fatty acid esters, ethers and<br>
nitriles.<br>
The invention further provides a method for stabilizing<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
which comprises handling reduced coenzyme Q10 in the form<br>
of a solution in at least one solvent selected from among<br>
hydrocarbons, fatty acid esters, ethers and nitriles to thereby<br><br>
protect the reduced coenzyme Q10 from oxidation by molecular<br>
oxygen.<br>
The invention still further provides a reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10 crystal with a reduced coenzyme Q10/oxidized coenzyme Q10<br>
weight ratio of not lower than 96/4.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it is possible,<br>
in synthesizing reduced coenzyme Q10 by reduction of oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q10, to favorably protect the reduced coenzyme Q10 from<br>
oxidation by molecular oxygen and, thus, it is possible to<br>
synthesize high-quality reduced coenzyme Q10 in such a condition<br>
that the formation of oxidized coenzyme Q10 as a byproduct is<br>
minimized. Furthermore, the method of crystallizing reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 of the present invention makes it possible to<br>
favorably protect reduced coenzyme Q10 from oxidation by<br>
molecular oxygen and, thus it is possible to convert the same<br>
into a crystalline state in such a condition that the formation<br>
of oxidized coenzyme Q10 as a byproduct is minimized and thereby<br>
obtain high-quality crystalline coenzyme Q10.<br>
DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the following, the present invention is described in<br>
detail.<br>
In accordance with the invention, a solvent highly<br>
effective in protecting reduced coenzyme Q10 from the<br>
above-mentioned oxidation, namely at least one species selected<br>
from among hydrocarbons, fatty acid esters, ethers, and<br>
nitriles is used for synthesizing high-quality reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10 and for crystallizing the same and, further, for handling<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 stably, while inhibiting the oxidation of<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 to oxidized coenzyme Q10 by molecular oxygen.<br>

oxidation by molecular oxygen in a state dissolved or suspended<br>
in the solvents mentioned above rather in a crystalline state.<br>

and isobutyronitrile, and most preferred is acetonitrile.<br>
In selecting the solvent to be used from among the solvents<br>
mentioned above, such properties as boiling point and viscosity<br>
are preferably taken into consideration; for example, the<br>
solvent should have a boiling point which allows appropriate<br>
warming for increasing the solubility and facilitates a solvent<br>
removal from wet masses by drying and solvent recovery from<br>
crystallization filtrates (about 30 to 150°C at 1 atm), a<br>
melting point such that solidification hardly occurs in<br>
handling at room temperature as well as upon cooling to room<br>
temperature or below (not higher than about 20°C, preferably<br>
not higher than about 10°C, still more preferably not higher<br>
than about 0°C) , and a low viscosity (not higher than about 10<br>
cp at 20°C) . From the industrial operation viewpoint, a solvent<br>
which is scarcely volatile at ordinary temperature is<br><br>
preferred; for example, one having a boiling point of not lower<br>
than about 80°C is preferred, and one having a boiling point<br>
of not lower than about 90°C is more preferred.<br>
Reduced coenzyme Q10, when in a dissolved state, tends<br>
to become more resistant to oxidation as the concentration<br>
thereof increases. Reduced coenzyme Q10 is highly soluble in<br>
the solvents mentioned above and, in this respect, too, the<br>
above solvents are suitable for the protection from oxidation.<br>
The concentration of reduced coenzyme Q10 which is preferred<br>
from the viewpoint of protection thereof from oxidation may vary<br>
depending on the solvent species, among others, hence cannot<br>
be absolutely specified. Generally, however, the<br>
concentration of reduced coenzyme Q10 in the above solvents is<br>
generally not lower than 1 w/w%, preferably not lower than 2<br>
w/w% . The upper limit is not particularly restricted but, from<br>
the practical operability viewpoint, it is 400 w/w% or below,<br>
preferably 200 w/w% or below, more preferably 100 w/w% or below,<br>
still more preferably 50 w/w% or below.<br>
Furthermore, the solubility of reduced coenzyme Q10 in<br>
the solvents mentioned above shows a favorable temperature<br>
dependency. Therefore, the use of the above solvents is<br>
suitable also for favorably reducing the amount of reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 in solution and converting (crystallizing) the same<br>
into a crystalline state.<br>
Thus, when such a solvent as mentioned above is used, it<br>
is possible to minimize the undesirable oxygen-involving side<br>
reaction in the step of reduction reaction of oxidized coenzyme<br>
Q10 and/or crystallization of reduced coenzyme Q10. In addition,<br>
when reduced coenzyme Q10 is handled in the form of a solution<br>
in any of the solvents mentioned above, the reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10 is protected from oxidation by molecular oxygen and is thus<br>
stabilized, so that such handling operations as extraction and<br>
washing (extraction using any of the above solvents as added<br>
from the outside and washing with water), concentration<br>
(including solvent substitution by adding another solvent while<br><br>
concentrating) and column chromatography may be carried out<br>
successfully. In the practice of the invention, it is of course<br>
preferred that the series of operations from the reduction<br>
reaction of oxidized coenzyme Q10 to the crystallization<br>
(purification by crystallization) of reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
(inclusive of extraction of reduced coenzyme Q10, washing the<br>
extract with water, and so forth, where necessary) be carried<br>
out using the solvent or solvents mentioned above.<br>
In the practice of the invention, the above solvents may<br>
be used in combination with another solvent, if necessary,<br>
within such an amount that the latter does not produce some or<br>
other adverse effect. For example, an appropriate amount of<br>
another solvent may be added to the above solvents in order to<br>
improve the solubility of oxidized coenzyme Q10 and/or reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10, the solubility of the reducing agent, the rate<br>
of reaction and the like in the reduction reaction and, in the<br>
crystallization of reduced coenzyme Q10, to improve the<br>
solubility of reduced coenzyme Q10 as well as the<br>
crystallization concentration, crystallization temperature,<br>
yield, slurry properties, crystal properties, and the like.<br>
Such other solvent is not particularly restricted but<br>

Further preferred are methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol and<br>
2-propanol, particularly preferred are ethanol, 1-propanol and<br>
2-propanol, and most preferred is ethanol.<br>
As the dihydric alcohol, there may be mentioned, for<br>
example, 1,2-ethanediol, 1,2-propandiol, 1,3-propandiol,<br>
1,2-butanediol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol,<br>

preferred is 1,2-ethanediol.<br>
As the trihydric alcohol, glycerol, etc. may be<br>
preferably used, for example.<br>
As fatty acids, there may be mentioned, for example,<br><br>
formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, etc. Preferred are<br>
formic acid and acetic acid, and most preferred is acetic acid.<br>
The ketones are not particularly restricted, and ones<br>
having 3 to 6 carbon atoms are preferably used. As specific<br>
examples, there may be mentioned, for example, acetone, methyl<br>
ethyl ketone, methyl butyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, etc.<br>
Preferred are acetone and methyl ethyl ketone, and most<br>
preferred is acetone.<br>
As the nitrogen compounds, there may be mentioned, for<br>
example, nitromethane, triethylamine, pyridine, formamide,<br>
N-methylformamide, N, N-dimethylformamide,<br>
N,N-dimethylacetoamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, etc.<br>
As the sulfur compounds, there may be mentioned, for<br>
example, dimethyl sulfoxide, sulfolane, etc.<br>
It is recommended that the above-mentioned other solvent<br>
is used, together with at least one solvent selected from among<br>
hydrocarbons, fatty acid esters, ethers, and nitriles, in an<br>
adequate proportion depending on the solvent characteristics<br>
thereof, including the known physical properties thereof, such<br>
as melting point, boiling point, vapor pressure characteristics,<br>
and phase transition, and the above-mentioned solvent amount<br>
and, further, on the effect to the solubility of oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q10, reduced coenzyme Q10 and/or the reducing agent.<br>
Although the other solvent may be used within an amount<br>
causing no adverse effect, without any other particular<br>
restriction, it is preferred from the viewpoint of oxidation-<br>
protective effect and/or crystallization yield (to be mentioned<br>
later herein) , among others, that the above-mentioned solvent<br>
with high oxidation-protective effect (at least one species<br>
selected from among hydrocarbons, fatty acid esters, ethers,<br>
and nitriles) is present in a larger proportion. It is more<br>
preferred to use a solvent whose substantial main ingredient<br>
is a solvent with high oxidation-protective effect.<br>
In cases where the system comprises a homogeneous solvent<br>
phase, at least one solvent selected from among hydrocarbons,<br><br>
fatty acid esters, ethers, and nitriles is preferably used as<br>
the reaction solvent or crystallization solvent or as the main<br>
ingredient of the solvent for handling in the concentration,<br>
extraction, column chromatography and/or other operations. In<br>
cases where the system forms different solvent phases, it is<br>
a preferred embodiment that the main ingredient of the solvent<br>
phase having larger solubility of reduced coenzyme Q10 (in the<br>
case of a mixed solvent system composed of water and an organic<br>
solvent low in miscibility with water, for instance, reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 is scarcely soluble in the aqueous phase but soluble<br>
in the organic solvent phase low in miscibility with water) is<br>
at least one solvent selected from among hydrocarbons, fatty<br>
acid esters, ethers, and nitriles.<br>
From such viewpoint, the other solvent is used generally<br>
in a volume ratio of lower than about 0.3, preferably lower than<br>
about 0.2, more preferably lower than about 0.1, and still more<br>
preferably lower than about 0.05, relative to the whole solvent<br>
amount in the case of homogeneous systems or, in the case of<br>
heterogeneous systems, to the volume of the solvent having<br>
larger solubility of reduced coenzyme Q10. Needless to say, the<br>
lower limit is 0 (zero).<br>
Among the other solvents specifically given hereinabove,<br>
alcohols and/or water are most preferably used either singly<br>
or in combination from the reaction rate and yield improvement<br>
viewpoint in the reduction reaction of oxidized coenzyme Q10.<br>
In the step of crystallizing reduced coenzyme Q10, water can<br>
be preferably used from the viewpoint of improvement in slurry<br>
characteristics such as fluidity.<br>
Now, a method of producing reduced coenzyme Q10 by reducing<br>
oxidized coenzyme Q10 is described.<br>
The oxidized coenzyme Q10 to be used in the practice of<br>
the invention may be one prepared by synthesis, fermentation,<br>
or extraction from a natural product, for instance, as mentioned<br>
hereinabove, or may be an existing high-purity grade of coenzyme<br>
Q10. It may consist of oxidized coenzyme Q10 alone or may be<br><br>
a mixture of oxidized coenzyme Q10 and reduced coenzyme Q10.<br>
In the practice of the invention, the reduction of<br>
oxidized coenzyme Q10 is carried out using, as a solvent, the<br>
above-mentioned solvent with high oxidation-protective effect,<br>
namely at least one species selected from among hydrocarbons,<br>
fatty acid esters, ethers, and nitriles, and, as the reducing<br>
agent, a metal hydride compound, iron (metallic iron or iron<br>
in a salt form), zinc (metallic zinc), dithionous acid or<br>
a salt thereof, or ascorbic acid or a related compound thereof,<br>
for instance.<br>
The metal hydride compound is not particularly restricted<br>
but includes, among others, sodium borohydride and lithium<br>
aluminum hydride. The amount to be used of the metal hydride<br>
compound may vary depending on the species thereof, hence cannot<br>
be absolutely specified. generally, however, the reduction<br>
can be favorably carried out by using it in an amount of 1 to<br>
3 times the theoretical hydrogen equivalent.<br>
The reduction using iron or zinc is generally carried out<br>
using an acid. The acid is not particularly restricted but<br>
includes, among others, fatty acids such as acetic acid,<br>
sulfonic acids such as methanesulfonic acid, and inorganic<br>
acids such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid. Inorganic<br>
acids are preferred, and sulfuric acid is more preferred.<br>
The amount of iron to be used is not particularly<br>
restricted but, for example, an amount o± about 1/5 by weight<br>
or larger based on the charged weight of oxidized coenzyme Q10<br>
is appropriate for carrying out the reaction. The upper limit is not<br>
particularly restricted but,from the economical viewpoint, it is<br>
about twice the weight of the above charged weight or lower. Iron<br>
may be used not only in the form of metallic iron but also in the<br>
form of a salt, for example iron (II)sulfate, etc.<br>
The amount of zinc to be used is not particularly<br>
restricted but, for example, an amount of about 1/10 by weight<br>
or larger based on the charged weight of oxidized coenzyne Q10<br><br>
is appropriate for carrying out the reaction. The upper limit is<br>
not particularly restricted but, from the economic viewpoint, it<br>
is about twice the weight of the above charged weight or lower.<br>
The dithionous acid or a salt thereof is not<br>
particularly restricted but a salt form of dithionous acid<br>
is generally used. The salt of dithionous acid is not<br>
particularly restricted but includes, as preferred species,<br>
alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts, ammonium salt<br>
and the like. Alkali metal salts such as the lithium salt,<br>
sodium salt, and potassium salt are more preferred, and the<br>
sodium salt is most preferred. The amount to be used of the<br>
dithionous acid or salt is not particularly restricted but<br>
it is generally not smaller than about 1/5 by weight, preferably<br>
not smaller than about 2/5 by weight, and more preferably not<br>
smaller than about 3/5 by weight, based on the charged weight<br>
of oxidized coenzyme Q10. Larger amounts may be used without<br>
causing any particular trouble. From the economical viewpoint,<br>
however, the amount to be employed is not larger than about twice<br>
the weight of the above-mentioned charged weight, preferably<br>
not larger than the charged weight. Thus, the reaction can be<br>
more favorably carried out with employing an amount within the<br>
range of about 2/5 by weight of the above-mentioned charge to<br>
a weight roughly equal to that of the charged weight.<br>
The ascorbic acid or related compounds thereof are not<br>
particularly restricted, and include, for example, not only<br>
ascorbic acid, but also rhamno-ascorbic acid, arabo-ascorbic<br>
acid, gluco-ascorbic acid, fuco-ascorbic acid,<br>
glucohepto-ascorbic acid, xylo-ascorbic acid,<br>
galacto-ascorbic acid, gulo-ascorbic acid, allo-ascorbic acid,<br>
erythro-ascorbic acid, 6-desoxyascorbic acid, and the like<br>
ascorbic acid derivatives, and may be ester forms or salts of<br>
these. Furthermore, these may be L-form, D-form or racemic form.<br>
More specifically, there may be mentioned, for example,<br>
L-ascorbic acid, L-ascorbyl palmitate, L-ascorbyl stearate,<br>
D-arabo-ascorbic acid, etc. In producing the reduced coenzyme<br><br>
Q10, any of the above-mentioned ascorbic acid and related<br>
compounds thereof may be suitably used. However, the<br>
water-soluble ones are suitably used in particular among the<br>
above-mentioned ascorbic acid or related compounds thereof in<br>
view of separatability with the generated reduced coenzyme Q10,<br>
etc. And most preferred is a free form of L-ascorbic acid,<br>
D-arabo-ascorbic acid, and the like in view of the ready<br>
availability, price, etc.<br>
The amount to be used of the ascorbic acid or a related<br>
compound thereof mentioned above is not particularly restricted<br>
but may be an amount effective in converting oxidized coenzyme<br>
Q10 to reduced coenzyme Q10. Generally it is not smaller than<br>
1 mole, preferably not smaller than 1.2 moles, per mole of<br>
oxidized coenzyme Q10. The upper limit is not particularly-<br>
restricted but, from the economical viewpoint, it is generally<br>
not higher than 10 moles, preferably not higher than 5 moles,<br>
and more preferably not higher than 3 moles, per mole of the<br>
oxidized coenzyme Q10 •<br>
Among the reducing agent species mentioned above, zinc,<br>
dithionous acid and salts thereof, and ascorbic acid and<br>
related compounds thereof are preferred from the viewpoint of<br>
reducing ability, yield and/or quality, among others, and, in<br>
particular, dithionous acid (specifically dithionous<br>
acid salts) and ascorbic acid or related compounds thereof are<br>
preferred.<br>
In carrying out the reduction reaction, an alcohol and/or<br>
water are/is suitably used singly or in combination, as<br>
mentioned above. Water is preferred in particular when iron,<br>
zinc, or dithionous acid or a salt thereof is used as the<br>
reducing agent. When a metal hydride compound or ascorbic acid<br>
or a related compound thereof is used as the reducing agent,<br>
an alcohol can be used in combination. The combined use of water<br>
and an alcohol exhibits the characteristics of both water and<br>
the alcohol and contributes to improvements in reaction rate<br>
and yield, among others.<br><br>
In the following, a preferred method of reduction is<br>
described in detail.<br>
The reduction using dithionous acid or a salt thereof<br>
is preferably carried out using water in combination, namely<br>
in a mixed solvent system composed of at least one organic<br>
solvent selected from among the above-mentioned hydrocarbons,<br>
fatty acid esters, ethers, and nitriles, with water. On that<br>
occasion, the reaction is preferably carried out generally at<br>
a pH of not higher than 7, preferably at pH 3 to 7, mere preferably<br>
at pH 3 to 6, from the viewpoint of yield, etc. The pH can be<br>
adjusted using an acid (e.g. an inorganic acid sucn as<br>
hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid) or a base (e.g. an alkali<br>
metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide).<br>
In the reduction using dithionous acid or a salt<br>
thereof, the amount of water is not particularly restricted but<br>
may be an amount of water such that an appropriate amount of<br>
the reducing agent, namely dithionous acid or a salt: thereof,<br>
can be dissolved therein. Thus, for example, it is advisable<br>
that the amount of the dithionous acid or a salt be adjusted<br>
generally to not more than 30 w/w%, and preferably not more than<br>
20 w/w%, relative to the weight of water. From the productivity<br>
viewpoint, among others, it is advisable that the amount be<br>
adjusted generally to not less than 1 w/w%, preferably not less<br>
than 5 w/w%, and more preferably not less than 10 w/w%.<br>
The reduction using the ascorbic acid or a related<br>
compound thereof mentioned above is preferably carried out<br>
using a solvent especially highly miscible with water as<br>
selected from among the above-mentioned hydrocarbons, fatty<br>
acid esters, ethers, and nitriles, in particular at least one<br>
species selected from among ethers and nitriles, which are<br>
highly miscible with water, and more specifically<br>
tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, acetonitrile or the like. An<br>
alcohol may also be used as another solvent. Furthermore, from<br>
the viewpoint of reaction promotion (e.g. reaction temperature<br>
lowering or reaction time shortening) in the production of<br><br>
reduced coenzyme Q10, it is also possible to carry out the<br>
reduction in the presence of an additive having a reaction<br>
promoting effect, such as a basic substance or a<br>
hydrogensulfite.<br>
The basic compound is not particularly restricted but may<br>
be either an inorganic compound or an organic compound. The<br>
inorganic compound is not particularly restricted but includes,<br>
among others, the hydroxides, carbonates, and<br>
hydrogencarbonates of metals (preferably alkali metals,<br>
alkaline earth metals, and the like) , and ammonia. As typical<br>
examples thereof, there may be mentioned alkali metal<br>
hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, alkali metal carbonates<br>
such as sodium carbonate, alkali metal hydrogencarbonates such<br>
as sodium hydrogencarbonate, and alkaline earth metal<br>
carbonates such as magnesium carbonate. The organic compound<br>
is not particularly restricted but includes, among others,<br>
amines such as triethylamine. Among the basic substances<br>
specifically mentioned above, weakly basic substances (weak<br>
bases or weak alkalis) such as the carbonates and<br>
hydrogencarbonates of metals (preferably alkali metals,<br>
alkaline earth metals, etc.), ammonia, and like inorganic<br>
compounds; amines such as triethylamine, and like organic<br>
compounds are preferably used. More preferred are the weakly<br>
basic inorganic compounds mentioned above.<br>
Preferred as the hydrogensulfite are, for example, alkali<br>
metal hydrogensulfites such as sodium, hydrogensulfite.<br>
The amount of the additive mentioned above is not<br>
particularly restricted but may be such that the reaction<br>
promoting effect of the additive can be produced to a desired<br>
extent (effective amount). From the economical viewpoint,<br>
however, the amount is generally not more than 2 0 moles,<br>
preferably not more than 10 moles, more preferably not more than<br>
5 moles, and still more preferably not more than 2 moles, per<br>
mole of the ascorbic acid or a related compound thereof. The<br>
lower limit is not particularly restricted but, generally, it<br><br>
is not less than 0.01 mcies, preferably not less than 0.05 moles,<br>
more preferably not less than 0.1 moles, and still more<br>
preferably not less than 0.2 moles, per mole of the ascorbic acid<br>
or a related compound thereof.<br>
In the practice of the invention, the reduction reaction<br>
is preferably carried out under forced flowing. The power<br>
required for stirring to cause such flowing per unit volume is<br>
generally not less than about 0.01 kW/m3, preferably not less<br>
than about 0.1 kW/m3, and more preferably rot less than about<br>
0.3 kW/m3. The above forced flowing is generally caused by the<br>
turning of a stirring blade(s). The use of a stirring blade(s)<br>
is not always necessary if the above flowing can be otherwise<br>
obtained. For example a method based on Liquid circulation may<br>
be utilized.<br>
The reduction temperature may vary depending on the<br>
reducing agent species and/or amount, hence cannot be<br>
absolutely specified. In the reduction using dithionous<br>
acid or a salt thereof, for instance, the reduction is generally<br>
carried out at 100°C or below, preferably at 80°C or below, more<br>
preferably at 60°C or below. The lower limit is the<br>
solidification temperature of the system. Thus, the reduction<br>
can be favorably carried out generally at about 0 to 100°C,<br>
preferably at about 0 to 80°C, more preferably at about 0 to<br>
60°C. In the reduction using ascorbic acid or a related<br>
compound thereof, the reduction is carried out generally at 30°C<br>
or higher, preferably at 40°C or higher, more preferably at 50°C<br>
or higher. The upper limit is the boiling point of the system.<br>
Thus, the reduction can be favorably carried out generally at<br>
about 30 to 150°C, preferably about 40 tc 120°C, more preferably<br>
at about 50 to 100oC.<br>
The reaction concentration is not particularly<br>
restricted but the weigh- of oxidized coenzyme Q10 relative to<br>
the solvent weight is generally not less than about 1 w/w%,<br>
preferably not less than 3 w/w %, more preferably not less than<br>
10 w/w%, and still more preferably not less than 15 w/w%. The<br><br>
upper limit is not particularly restricted but generally is net<br>
higher than about 60 w/w%, preferably not higher than 50 w/w%,<br>
more preferably not higher than 40 w/w%, and still more<br>
preferably not higher than 30 w/w%. Thus, the reaction can be<br>
favorably carried out at a reaction concentration of about 1<br>
to 60 w/w%, preferably about 3 to 50 w/w%, and more preferably<br>
about 10 to 40 w/w%.<br>
The reduction reaction time may vary depending on the<br>
reducing agent species and/or the amount thereof, hence cannot<br>
be absolutely specified. Generally, however, the reaction can<br>
be driven to completion wmhin 4 8 hours, preferably within 2 4<br>
hours, more preferably within 10 hours, and still more<br>
preferably within 5 hours.<br>
It is exceedingly preferable to carry out the reduction<br>
reaction in a deoxidized atmospnere. Surprisingly, It was<br>
found that, in the reduction reaction using dithionous acid<br>
or a salt thereof, in particular, such atmosphere greatly<br>
contributes to an improvement in reduction reaction yield and<br>
a reduction in reducing agent amount. The deoxidized<br>
atmosphere can be attained by substitution with an inert gas,<br>
pressure reduction, boiling, or a combination of these. It is<br>
preferable to carry out at least the substitution with an inert<br>
gas, namely to use an inert gas atmosphere. As the inert gas,<br>
there may be mentioned, for example, nitrogen gas, helium gas,<br>
argon gas, hydrogen gas, and carbon dioxide gas. Nitrogen gas<br>
is preferred, however.<br>
An organic phase containing the product reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10 is recovered from the thus-obtained reduction reaction<br>
mixture and, if necessary (preferably), the organic phase is<br>
further washed repeatedly using water, an aqueous solution of<br>
sodium chloride, or the like to achieve complete contaminant<br>
elimination and, then, it can be subjected to crystallization.<br>
When the dithionous acid or a salt thereof mentioned above, such<br>
as sodium dithionite, in particular, is _sed as the<br>
reducing agent, it is desirable to repeat washing with water<br><br>
so that contaminants derived from the dithionous acid or salt<br>
thereof may be removed completely and/or the pH of the aqueous<br>
phase may be stabilized.<br>
When oxidized coenzyme Q10 is reduced with ascorbic acid<br>
or a related compound thereof using the above-mentioned highly<br>
water-miscible solvent, in particular at least one species<br>
selected from among those ethers and nitriles which are highly<br>
miscible with water (e.g. tetrahydrofuran, dioxane,<br>
acetonitrile, etc.), it is a very convenient and efficient<br>
procedure to crystallize reduced coenzyme Q10 directly from the<br>
reduction reaction mixture (direct isolation method (one-pot<br>
method)).<br>
The above treatment following the reduction reaction is<br>
preferably carried out in a deoxidized atmosphere and, thereby,<br>
che oxidation-protective effect can be furtner increased.<br>
The crystallization of reduced coenzyme Q10 is now<br>
described.<br>
The reduced coenzyme Q10 to be subjected to<br>
crystallization can be obtained in the conventional manner, for<br>
example, by synthesis, fermentation, or extraction from a<br>
natural source. Preferred is the product obtained by reduction<br>
of oxidized coenzyme Q10 contained in reduced coenzyme Q10, or<br>
reduction of oxidized coenzyme Q10 More preferred :..s the<br>
product obtained by carrying out the reduction reaction in<br>
accordance with the present invention, as described above.<br>
While the method of crystallization according to the<br>
invention can be applied also to products containing oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q10 in relatively large amounts, the method is<br>
particularly effective in crystallizing high-purity reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 prepared by the reduction method described above.<br>
In the practice of the invention, it is very effective to purify<br>
and crystallize reduced coenzyme Q10 with simultaneous removal<br>
of impurities contained in the reaction mixture or extract<br>
obtained in the conventional manner or produced by the<br>
above-mentioned reduction method or the like. More<br><br>
specifically, reduced coenzyme Q10 can be crystallized from the<br>
reduction reaction mixture obtained by the reduction method<br>
mentioned above, or a solution obtained by collecting the<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10-containing organic phase from the above<br>
reaction mixture, if necessary followed by washing of the<br>
organic phase. On that occasion, the impurities should<br>
preferably be eliminated into the mother liquor. This makes<br>
it possible to remove coexisting impurities, in particular<br>
analogous compounds having a similar structure and generally<br>
not always easy to remove (specifically, reduced coenzyme Q9,<br>
reduced coenzyme Q8, reduced coenzyme Q7, etc.). Needless to<br>
say, it is possible to utilize the method as a method of<br>
recrystallizing reduced coenzyme Q10 crystals obtained<br>
beforehand by purification and crystallization.<br>
The crystallization of reduced Q10 is carried out using,<br>
as the solvent, at least one species selected from among the<br>
above-mentioned hydrocarbons, fatty acid esters, ethers, and<br>
nitriles. Among them, hydrocarbons are preferred, aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons are more preferred,<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons are still more preferred, and the<br>
above-mentioned pentanes, hexanes, heptanes and octanes are<br>
most preferred. From the viewpoint of crystallization yield<br>
and/or unnecessariness of excessive cooling in crystallization,<br>
among others, acyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons are particularly<br>
preferred among the aliphatic hydrocarbons.<br>
The method of crystallization is not particularly<br>
restricted but the crystallization can be carried out by<br>
utilizing a conventional crystallization method, namely at<br>
least one of the cooling crystallization, concentration<br>
crystallization, solvent substitution crystallization and<br>
other methods. In particular, the cooling crystallization<br>
method, or a combination of the cooling crystallization method<br>
with some other method of crystallization is preferred.<br>
The cooling temperature in the step of crystallization<br>
is an important factor and, from the yield viewpoint, among<br><br>
others, it is generally not higher than 20°C, preferably not<br>
higher than 10°C, more preferably not higher than 5°C. The<br>
lower limit is the solidification temperature of the system.<br>
Thus, the crystallization can be advantageously carried out<br>
generally at a cooling temperature of about -30°C to +10°C,<br>
preferably about -20°C to +10°C, more preferably about -10°C<br>
to +5°C.<br>
In the process of crystallization, the amount of crystals<br>
crystallizing out per unit time may be controlled to minimize<br>
the immixture of various impurities into the obtained reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10, or to obtain a slurry with good characteristics.<br>
A preferred rate of crystallization per unit time is, for<br>
example, not higher than the rate of crystallization which<br>
causes crystallization of about 50%, per unit time, of the whole<br>
amount of crystals to be obtained (i.e. at most 50%/hour),<br>
preferably not higher than the rate of crystallization which<br>
causes crystallization of about 25%, per unit time, of the whole<br>
amount of crystals to be obtained (i.e. at most 25%/hour) . The<br>
rate of cooling in the crystallization by cooling is generally<br>
not higher than about 40°C/hour, and preferably not higher than<br>
about 20°C/hour.<br>
The crystallization concentration is also an important<br>
factor and, when expressed in terms of the weight of reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 relative to the weight of the crystallization<br>
solvent at the time of completion of crystallization, it is not<br>
higher than about 15 w/w%, preferably not higher than about 13<br>
w/w%, more preferably not higher than 10 w/w%. The preferred<br>
crystallization concentration may vary depending on the solvent<br>
species employed and, for attaining satisfactory<br>
crystallization results using an aliphatic hydrocarbon or a<br>
solvent whose main ingredient is an aliphatic hydrocarbon, the<br>
crystallization concentration is not higher than about 13 w/w%,<br>
preferably not higher than about 10 w/w%, more preferably not<br>
higher than about 8 w/w% and, in the case of an acyclic aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon, which is most preferred, or a solvent whose main<br><br>
ingredient is an acyclic aliphatic hydrocarbon, the<br>
crystallization concentration is not higher than about 10 w/w%,<br>
preferably not higher than about 8 w/w%, and more preferably<br>
not higher than about 7 w/w%. By maintaining such a<br>
concentration as mentioned above, it becomes possible to carry<br>
out the crystallization favorably in a manner adapted to the<br>
operability on an industrial scale. The lower limit to the<br>
crystallization concentration is not particularly restricted<br>
but, from the productivity viewpoint, it is generally not lower<br>
than about 1 w/w%, preferably not lower than about 2 w/w%.<br>
The crystallization is preferably carried out under<br>
forced flowing. For preventing the state of supersaturation<br>
from occurring and thereby allowing the nucleation and crystal<br>
growth to proceed smoothly and, furthermore, from the viewpoint<br>
of obtaining high-quality products, the flowing is generally<br>
brought about by a stirring power per unit volume of not weaker<br>
than about 0 . 01 kW/m3, preferably not weaker than about 0 .1 kW/m3,<br>
and more preferably not weaker than about 0.3 kW/m3. The forced<br>
flowing is generally provided by the turning of a stirring<br>
blade (s) . However, the use of a stirring blade (s) is not always<br>
necessary if the above flowing can be otherwise obtained. For<br>
example, it is possible to utilize a method based on liquid<br>
circulation.<br>
In carrying out the crystallization, seed crystals are<br>
preferably added so that the state of supersaturation may be<br>
prevented from occurring and the nucleation and crystal growth<br>
may be allowed to proceed smoothly.<br>
In carrying out the crystallization according to the<br>
invention, such another auxiliary solvent as mentioned above<br>
may be used, according to need, in combination with the<br>
above-mentioned solvent having a high protective effect against<br>
oxidation if the other solvent will not produce any adverse<br>
effect. While an appropriate amount of such other auxiliary<br>
solvent may be added to the solvent mentioned above for<br>
improving the solubility of reduced coenzyme Q10 as well as the<br><br>
crystallization concentration, crystallization temperature,<br>
yield, slurry characteristics, and crystal characteristics,<br>
among others, the use of such a mixed solvent may result in a<br>
drastic increase in solubility, whereby the crystallization<br>
yield rather tends to decrease in some instances. Therefore,<br>
from the viewpoint of oxidation-protective effect and/or<br>
crystallization yield, among others, a solvent, whose<br>
substantial main ingredient is the solvent mentioned above, is<br>
preferably used. Thus, when the solvent is used in admixture<br>
with another solvent, the proportion (ratio by volume) of the<br>
other solvent is not particularly restricted but generally is<br>
not higher than about 0.3, preferably not higher than about 0.2,<br>
more preferably not higher than about 0.1, and still more<br>
preferably not higher than about 0.05. Needless to say, the<br>
lower limit is 0 (zero) . As mentioned hereinabove, the volume<br>
ratio is the proportion of the volume of the other solvent to<br>
the whole solvent volume in the case of homogeneous systems and,<br>
in the case of heterogeneous systems, the proportion of the<br>
volume of the other solvent (s) to the volume of the solvent phase<br>
in which reduced coenzyme Q10 is well soluble.<br>
When water is used combinedly as the other auxiliary<br>
solvent, however, water can show its characteristics and can<br>
contribute to improvements in slurry characteristics, for<br>
instance. The amount of water in the crystallization of reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 influences on the slurry concentration of reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 crystallized out and/or on the slurry<br>
characteristics. As the amount of water increases, the slurry<br>
concentration decreases and the fluidity generally increases.<br>
On the other hand, the decrease in slurry concentration as a<br>
whole leads to a decrease in productivity. The amount of water<br>
is not particularly restricted but, taking the above factors<br>
into consideration, it may be varied so that it may be adjusted<br>
to and maintained in an appropriate range.<br>
The other auxiliary solvent mentioned above may be added<br>
prior to or during the crystallization process or after<br><br>
stabilization of the amount of the precipitated crystals.<br>
The thus-obtained crystals of reduced coenzyme Q10 can<br>
be recovered as a wet product, for example, by such a<br>
solid-liquid separation technique as centrifugation, pressure<br>
filtration, or vacuum filtration, if necessary followed by cake<br>
washing. They can be recovered also as a dry product by further<br>
charging the wet product in a reduced pressure drier (vacuum<br>
drier) internally purged with an inert gas and drying the same<br>
under reduced pressure. The recovery in a dry form is<br>
preferred.<br>
When the crystallization is carried out in a deoxidized<br>
atmosphere, the protective effect against oxidation can be<br>
further increased. The deoxidized atmosphere can be attained<br>
by inert gas substitution, pressure reduction, boiling, or a<br>
combination of these. It is preferable to carry out at least<br>
the substitution with an inert gas, namely to use an inert gas<br>
atmosphere. As the inert gas, there may be mentioned, for<br>
example, nitrogen gas, helium gas, argon gas, hydrogen gas, and<br>
carbon dioxide gas. Nitrogen gas is preferred, however.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, high-quality<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 can be synthesized and crystallized in a<br>
convenient and efficiency manner. The crystals of reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 as obtained in accordance with the present<br>
invention are of very high quality and can be expected to have<br>
a reduced coenzyme Q10/oxidized coenzyme Q10 weight ratio of not<br>
lower than 96/4, preferably not lower than 98/2, more preferably<br>
not lower than 99/1.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The following examples illustrate the present invention<br>
in further detail. These examples are, however, by no means<br>
limitative of the scope of the present invention. In the<br>
examples, the purity of reduced coenzyme Q10 and the reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10/oxidized coenzyme Q10 weight ratio were determined<br>
by the HPLC analysis specified below. The reduced coenzyme Q10<br><br>
purity values as determined, however, are by no means indicative<br>
of the limit purity value attainable in accordance with the<br>
present invention. Likewise, the reduced ccenzyme<br>
Q10/oxidized coenzyme Q10 weight ratio values obtained never<br>
indicate the upper limit to that ratio.<br>
