				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invented in general relates to handling the Number storage list overflow in the mobile phones. Particularly this invention encompasses controlling to handle the overflow and then its management based upon the pre-defined method.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In a mobile phone when the number storage list overflows then the number will be deleted from the list based on the FIFO Policy. User cannot set the policy for the deletion of the number. Also once the number is deleted it cannot be recovered back as there is no arrangement for the recovery of the numbers from the recycle bin.<br>
In current mobile phone storage overflow handling, if the new entry is to be added in the Dialed/ Missed / Received call storage list, it checks for the overflow of the list. If the list is full then it deletes the entry from the particular list and adds the new entry to it.<br>
The current mobile phone storage overflow handling has the following limitations;<br>
a.	Number will be deleted from the storage directly using FIFO policy.<br>
b.	Number once deleted cannot be recovered.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the invention is to handle the storage list overflow in the mobile phones with the policies set by the user. The invented method also allows user to select the policy for the handling the storage list overflow. The invented method also provides recycle bin for mobile phone storage list to recover the deleted entry.<br>
Handling of the storage list overflow in the mobile phone is the mechanism by which user can decide the policy by which the old entry should be selected for deletion while adding the new entry. It also provides the mechanism by which user can select the policy for each of the storage list or common policy to all. This invention also covers the recovery of the deleted item by means of Recycle Bin. This invention is applicable to all the storage list of the mobile phones i.e. Dialed Call List, Missed Call List, Received Call List<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method for handling number storage list overflow in mobile phones comprising:<br>
(a)	configuring a policy for storage list overflows;<br>
(b)	applying policy while handling the overflows;<br>
(c)	maintaining the recycle bin to store deleted list; and<br>
(d)	recovering the deleted numbers from the said list in recycle bin.<br><br>
The user sets the policy for handling the overflow which allows user to set the policies for per storage list or common for all settings. The policies the user selects are FIFO and DABN. The entry for deletion is chosen based on the policy selected by the user for the particular storage list. If the policy selected is FIFO then it selects the first entry, which is arrived in the queue for the deletion and once the entry is selected for deletion the entry is added to the Recycle Bin. If the policy is set to DABN then the entry is selected from the storage list in such a way that the entry has the Address Book entry present for the number and the said entry is the first entry in all such entries. If no entry is present, which has the address book entry present for the same then the regular FIFO policy is applied or if any other policy option is set then the selection for the entry deletion happen as per the said other policy. Recycle bin is maintained common for all stored lists or made separate for each of the list and if the recycle bin is full then the deletion of the entry from the recycle bin happens based on the FIFO Policy. The Recycle Bin maintains the folders for separate stored list or maintains all the deleted entries at one folder. If all entries are maintained in one place then the entries has the details of which stored list it represents.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from a reading of the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 explains the steps involved in the configurations of the policies for handling the overflow in the storage list.<br>
Figure 2 explains the handling of the overflow in the stored list based on the different policies.<br>
Figure 3 explains selection of entry to be deleted if the policy is set as FIFO.<br>
Figure 4 explains the selection of the entry to be deleted if the policy set is DABN<br>
Figure 5 explains deletion of the entry from the stored list if new entry is to be added in the overflow handling case and the entry is to be added in the Recycle Bin.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the<br><br>
claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Mobile phones have the limitation on the number of entries to be present in each of the number storage lists. When the new entry is to be added in the any number storage list i.e. in Received / Dialed / Missed Call list it need to be checked for the available number of entries present in each storage list. If the list is full then to add new entry it is needed to delete the entry from the existing storage list. Invention deals with the policy of such deletion and the setting of such policies. Once the entry is deleted from the particular storage list, it will be added in the recycle bin for facilitate the user to retrieve it. Following section covers each of the activities in more detail.<br>
Policy Configuration for Storage List overflows<br>
This mechanism facilitates the user to set the policy for handling the overflow. Mechanism also allows user to set the policies for per storage list or common for all. The policies the user can select are FIFO and DABN (Deletion of Address Book Number).<br>
Applying Policy while handling the overflow<br>
If the mobile phone has to add the entry in the Received/ Dialed / Missed storage list based on the call it checks for the overflow. If the list is full then it need to<br><br>
delete one entry from the respective storage list to add new entry. The deletion entry is chosen based on the policy selected by the user for the particular storage list. If the policy selected is FIFO then it selects the first entry, which is arrived in the queue for the deletion. Once the entry is selected for the selection the entry will be added to the Recycle Bin. If the policy is set to DABN (Deletion of Address Book Number) then the entry will be selected from the storage list such a way that the entry will have the Address Book entry present for the number and it is the first entry in all such entries. If no entry is present, which has the address book entry present for the same then the regular FIFO policy will be applied. If any other policy option is set then the selection for the entry deletion should happen accordingly.<br>
If the recycle bin is full then the entry need to be deleted to add the new entry in the Recycle Bin. Selection of this entry will be done based on the FIFO policy.<br>
Maintaining the Recycle Bin<br>
Recycle Bin can be maintained common for all stored lists or can be made separate for each of the list. If the Recycle Bin is full then the deletion of the entry from the Recycle Bin will happen based on the FIFO Policy.<br>
Recovery of the deleted number<br>
User can check the deleted entry in the Recycle bin using the 'Recycle Bin*. If the Recycle Bin can maintain the folders for separate stored list or it can maintain all the deleted entries at one folder. If the all entries are maintained in one place then<br><br>
the entry will have the details which stored list it represents.<br>
Figure 1 explains the steps involved in the configurations of the policies for<br>
handling the overflow in the storage list.<br>
Here the call can be a Dialed / Missed / Received call.<br>
Check is made to verify that the list overflows.<br>
If the list overflows delete the entry from the storage List on FIFO basis.<br>
Figure 2 explains the handling of the overflow in the stored list based on the<br>
different policies.<br>
Here the user sets the overflow handling policy.<br>
The mobile devise saves the policy for further use.<br>
Figure 3 explains selection of entry to be deleted if the policy is set as FIFO.<br>
Here the call can be a Dialed / Missed / Received call.<br>
Check is made to verify that the list overflows.<br>
If the list overflows the policy settings are checked.<br>
If the Deletion Policy is FIFO, choose number present in rear of a queue for<br>
deletion.<br>
Figure 4 explains the selection of the entry to be deleted if the policy set is DABN Here the call can be a Dialed / Missed / Received call. Check is made to verify that the list overflows. If the list overflows the policy settings are checked.<br><br>
If the Deletion Policy is DABN, Choose the number in the list such that it is present in the address book and holds last position among such numbers. If the number is not found then choose the number based on FIFO policy.<br>
Figure 5 explains deletion of the entry from the stored list if new entry is to be<br>
added in the overflow handling case and the entry is to be added in the Recycle<br>
Bin.<br>
Here the call can be a Dialed / Missed / Received call.<br>
Check is made in storage to verify that the list overflows.<br>
If the list overflows the policy settings are checked.<br>
If the Recycle Bin is full delete the number from rear of a queue and add the<br>
number in the front of the Recycle Bin queue.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br><br>
Although the present invention has been fully descnbed in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br>
