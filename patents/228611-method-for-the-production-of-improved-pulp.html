METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION OF IMPROVED PULP<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to compositions and methods for the production of<br>
enhanced pulp in chemical pulping processes. More particularly, this invention relates to compositions and methods for producing enhanced pulp in the Kraft pulp process. This invention further relates to compositions and methods for improving the pulp production rate in chemical pulping processes.<br>
Worldwide, pulp making is carried out on a large scale. Accordingly, it is highly desirable that such pulp making operations be carried out in a cost effective, efficient operation with minimum equipment downtime and with minimum periods of reduced process equipment operating efficiency. It is further desired to produce wood pulp of high strength, quality and high yield.<br>
The basic steps in industrial pulp making are to convert plant fiber into chips, convert chips into pulp, (optionally) bleach the pulp, wash the pulp, and transform the pulp into suitable paper which can be used in paper products such as writing paper, newsprint and paper for documents.<br>
Typically, several chemical pulping processes are used in industrial pulp making operations. Well known industrial alkaline chemical pulping processes include the Kraft (or sulfate), soda and alkaline sulfite processes. The Kraft process makes the strongest fibers of any pulp making process and is the most commonly used pulp making process in part due to its efficient recovery process for the cooking chemicals. Nevertheless some degree of degradation of the cellulose fibers occurs under conditions of the Kraft cook leading to shorter fibers and higher amounts of dissolved cellulose.<br>
While the present invention has applicability to any of the above alkaline chemical pulping processes, it is particularly useful with the Kraft process and, as such, the Kraft process is described in more detail below.<br>
Initially, suitable trees are harvested, debarked and then chipped into suitable size flakes or chips. These wood chips are sorted with the small and the large chips being removed. The remaining suitable wood chips are then charged to a digester (which is a vessel or tank for holding the chips and an aqueous digesting composition and which can be operated in either a batch or continuous mode as desired).<br><br>
Illustratively, in a batch type digester, wood chips and a mixture of "weak black liquor," the spent liquor from a previous digester cook, and "white liquor," a solution of sodium Hydroxide and sodium sulfide, that is either fresh or from the chemical recovery plant, is pumped into the digester. In the cooking process, lignin, which binds the wood fiber together, is dissolved in the white liquor forming pulp and black liquor.<br>
The digester is sealed and the digester composition is heated to a suitable cook temperature, e.g. temperatures up to about ISO'^C, under high pressure.   After an allotted cooking time at a particular temperature and pressure (H-factor) in the digester, the digester contents (pulp and black liquor) are transferred to a holding tank. The pulp in the holding tank is transferred to the brown stock washers while the liquid (black liquor formed in the digester) is sent to the black liquor recovery area. The black liquor is evaporated to a high solids content, usually 60-80% solids. Most commercial paper mills use multiple effect evaporators (MEE) as the black liquor evaporators. These evaporators generally range from four to eight effects in length.<br>
The Kraft cook is highly alkaline, usually having a pH of 10 to 14, more particularly 12 to 14. The digester composition contains a large amount of sodium sulfide, which is used as an accelerant to increase the delignification rate of the cook. This works to release most of the lignin in the wood chips and thus the cellulose and part of the heraicellulose become available as pulp.<br>
In practice, the pulping process and subsequent bleaching processes are separate operations. There are several bleaching sequences that are used commercially. Chlorine, chlorine dioxide, sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, oxygen, ozone and mixtures thereof are employed in many bleaching processes. In one typical bleaching process, pulp recovered from the digester process is treated with the following steps: (a) chlorine dioxide, (b) caustic extraction, (c) chlorine dioxide, (d) caustic extraction, and (e) chlorine dioxide to reach the final pulp brightness. It is highly desirable to generate pulps, including Kraft pulps, with lower overall lignin content as these pulps require less bleaching chemical and thus generate less pollutant, especially absorbable organic halide (AOX) levels.<br>
One approach to generate Kraft pulps with low lignin content is by using an extended delignification process. Extended delignification processes require<br><br>
extensive equipment changes (additional cooking vessels) and may result in higher facility energy requirements. Additionally^ a major concern with extended delignification is to achieve decreased lignin content while minimizing cellulose damage. Cellulose damage is reflected in lower pulp viscosity and lower pulp strength.<br>
Thus, preparation of pulp having decreased lignin content, i.e. lower Kappa number, with lower bleaching chemical requirements in the overall pulping operation is highly desired. Furthermore, preparation of pulp having improved strength properties is also highly desired. In addition, obtaining higher yields in the pulping process is highly desired as this could increase production and/or lower pulp production costs. Alternatively, preparation of pulp at an accelerated rate, e.g. reducing the digester cycle time in a batch digester, is desired even if the pulp properties remained constant. Compositions for use in chemical pulping processes and an improved chemical pulping process that can achieve one or more of the above improvements would be extremely valuable to the industry.<br>
Compositions for use in chemical pulping processes and an improved chemical pulping process have now been discovered that achieve one or more of the desired pulp property or process throughput improvements.<br>

A second embodiment of the invention relates to a method for improving properties of pulp produced, reducing the digester cycle time, or reducing the pulping or bleaching chemicals required in alkaline chemical pulping processes comprising adding an effective amount of at least one compound to the alkaline aqueous mixture in the digester of the chemical pulping process, wherein the at least one compound is as described above.<br>
Optionally, other additives can be added with the compounds of the invention to the alkaline aqueous mixture in the digester. Typical additives include, but are not limited to, conventional additives known for use in the digester of a chemical pulping process. An example of a suitable additive that can be optionally added is anthroquinone.<br>
In the practice of the method of this invention in a chemical pulping process, e.g. a Kraft process, the aqueous composition of the invention is admixed with an alkaline, aqueous composition in the digester. The aqueous composition of the invention can be added to the digester using any conventional means known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In addition, the aqueous composition of the invention can be added direcdy to the digester composition or it can be introduced into one of the aqueous feed compositions being charged to the digester prior to charging of that aqueous feed composition. The pH in the digester of an alkaline chemical pulping process is at least 9. In the case of a Kraft process, the pH in the digester is preferably about 10 to about 14, and more preferably about 12 to about 14. The temperature in the digester is typically in the range of about llO^'C to about 180°C, preferably about<br><br>
150°C to about ITS'^C. The aqueous composition of the invention can be added in a batch digester in any conventional manner known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, in a batch digester operation, the addition of the aqueous composition of the invention can be a bulk addition at the beginning of the digester cook cycle or during the digester cook cycle, or it can be added in multiple charges throughout the digestion cycle or continuously throughout the digester cook cycle. It is currently preferred to add the aqueous composition of the invention as a bulk charge at or near the beginning of the digester cook cycle. In the case of a continuous digester operation, the addition of the aqueous composition of the invention will typically be added continuously to maintain the effective concentration of the compounds of the invention.<br>
The pulp that is recovered from the digester and washed can optionally be bleached using any conventional bleaching sequence depending on the desired end use of the pulp. Several bleaching sequences are used commercially in conjunction with chemical pulping processes. When bleaching is used, a majority of pulp mills use a 5-stage bleaching sequence. A common such bleaching sequence is the DEDED sequence. However, with the trend to reduce chlorine containing bleach steps, some pulp mills have moved to a bleaching sequence similar to DEopD or DEopP. A less common bleaching sequence is the OPD sequence. The definitions for the letters used in the bleaching sequences are: D = chlorine dioxide (CIO2) C = chlorine (CI2) O = oxygen (O2) P = hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) E = alkaline extraction<br>
Eop = alkaline extraction reinforced with oxygen and hydrogen peroxide H = sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) Z = ozone (O3)<br>
Bleaching processes are well known in the art and one of ordinary skill in the art will be able to practice any conventional bleaching sequence using pulp prepared using the process of the invention.<br><br>
The use of the compounds of the invention in the process of the invention enable production of pulp with brightness comparable to pulp produced without use of the compounds of the invention but with a reduction in the amount of bleaching chemicals used or reduction in the number of bleaching steps. In the alternative, the use of the compounds of the invention in the process of the invention enable production of pulp with improved brightness compared to pulp produced without use of the compounds of the invention.<br>
Viscosity is a measurement which relates viscosity of dissolved pulp to its strength properties. Mills use it as a way to test pulp properties quickly. Viscosity is related to the degree of cellulose polymerization and amount of lignin and hemicellulose attached to the fiber. Generally, as cellulose chains are broken and the lignin is removed, the viscosity decreases. The amount of damage to the fiber during the Kraft cook can be seen in the viscosity test. The compounds of the invention have been demonstrated in the examples herein to be good protectors of fiber strength during the Kraft cook. The benefits of achieving a higher viscosity at a given kappa number include the ability to cook a pulp longer and maintain a similar strength property or the ability to use more severe bleaching conditions to get a brighter pulp or use a process that is less expensive in chemical cost such as oxygen bleaching.<br>
A small increase in yield of the pulp can result in a huge savings to the pulp mill. A yield increase means more pulp for the same amount of wood chips. This would also have the impact of lowering solids in the black liquor recovery area. Since many pulp mills are bottlenecked in the black liquor recovery area, this would allow some pulp mills to raise production without spending capital for additional equipment.<br>
The use of the compounds of the invention generally result in decreasing the kappa number, so the pulp mill would have the ability to decrease the cook time or cook temperature (i.e. H-factor). Decreasing the Kraft cook temperature would result in less carbohydrate degradation. This would typically increase strength properties, viscosity and yield. Decreasing the cook time would allow a pulp mill to increase the number of Kraft cooks done in a day, i.e. increase the pulp production rate.<br>
A third embodiment of the invention relates to the improved bleached and unbleached pulps prepared by the process of the invention.<br><br>
One of ordinary skill in the art using this invention will be able to readily select an appropriate compound of the invention and concentration for addition to the digester to achieve the desired pulp property improvement or reduction in digester cycle time based on the disclosure of this specification. It will be apparent to those of skill in the art after reading this specification that many factors, including those of the type which have been mentioned herein, will determine the amount of the compounds of the invention needed to achieve the desired results. The determination of these amounts is within the ordinary skill of the artisan in this field without undue experimentation considering the direction provided herein.<br>
The invention is further described in the following Examples which arc not intended to limit or restrict the invention. Unless otherwise indicated all quantities are expressed by weight.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
A Kraft cook test was employed in the following examples and illustrates the<br>
use of the process of this invention to determine the effect of the compositions of this invention as a pulp modifier in a Kraft cook. The general procedure described below was followed. Additionally, the tests were generally carried out at various concentrations as active acid based on the amount of wood chips (oven-dry basis) charged to the digester, for each inventive compound tested, and also with no added compound present.<br>
As used herein, the active acid level is that amount of free acid which is equimolar to the amount of phosphonate or carboxylate that was actually added to the digester. Unless otherwise specified, use of "%" is on a weight basis.<br>
KRAFT COOK TEST<br>
The Kraft Cook Test used herein was developed to gauge the performance of<br>
the compositions of this invention in a simulated Kraft digester composition. The test was a standard Kraft cook in a model MK 610 Systems Inc. minimill laboratory digester. The digester aqueous composition temperature was ramped from ambient temperature to 170°C in about 45 minutes and then maintained at ITO^'C for the remainder of the test. Aspen or red pine wood chips were obtained from a pulp mill in the Upper Midwestern United States. Pulping conditions were: a 4:1 liquor to wood ratio, 16-20% AA (active alkali) and 25% sulfidity. The H-factor (length of<br><br>
cook) was varied in the cooks. The amount of phosphonate or carboxylate used was also varied.<br>
Drying of wood chips:<br>
Aspen or pine wood chips that remained on a Vi-inch round-holed mesh screen were utilized in the test, while removing knots and oversize chips.<br>
Some of the wood chips were air dried overnight by laying them out on a counter. Wood chips not air dried were stored in a cold room at 13°C and used before they began to show signs of decay.<br>
Preparation of White Liquor/Charge of Digester:<br>
A liquor to wood ratio of 4:1 was prepared with 16-20% active alkali, having a 25% sulfidity.<br>
The charge of phosphonate or carboxylate employed was based upon the weight of wood chips (oven-dry basis) charged to the digester to give the desired equivalent wt. % of active acid in the digester.<br>
White liquor was prepared according to the following procedure (for most runs), although some Kraft cooks used different AA. For an 18% AA, 25% sulfidity: 62 g caustic and 61g sodium sulfide nonahydrate were added to 500 mL water. After all chemicals were dissolved, the final dilution was added, which depended on the moisture content of the wood chips.<br>
350 grams (OD weight) of wood chips, prepared as described above, were added to the wood chip holder. White liquor (IL) and wood chips were transferred to the digester and the initial temperature and time recorded.<br>
Each Kraft cook test example below was carried out according to the general procedure recited above. In most examples, the phosphonates and/or carboxylates were tested at various concentration levels. All levels are given in weight percent phosphonate or carboxylate on an active acid basis per weight wood chips (oven-dry basis).<br>
The phosphonates used individually and in blends in the examples were obtained from Solutia Inc. (St. Louis, MO). DTPA was obtained from Dow Chemical (Versenex 80^^), caustic, sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide were from Mallinckrodt, sodium sulfide nonahydrate from EM Science, potassium chlorate and<br><br>
oxalic acid from Fisher Scientific, sodium thiosulfate from J.T. Baker, and the oxygen cylinders from Twin City Oxygen.<br>
Pulp Property Testing: The pulp properties of most interest in the industry are the kappa number (related to lignin content in the pulp), pulp brightness, screened yield, reject amount, and pulp strength properties.<br>
Test procedures: Kappa number (TAPPI test method T236)<br>
Screened yield (amount of oven dried ("OD") wood puip passing through a 0.015 inch screen/total amount of OD starting pulp)<br>
Reject rate (amount of OD wood pulp retained on a 0.015 inch screen/total amount of OD starting pulp)<br>
ISO brightness (TAPPI test method T525) Viscosity (TAPPI test method T230) Tensile strength (TAPPI test method T494) Burst strength (TAPPI test method T403) Tear strength (TAPPI test method T414) Handsheet making (TAPPI test method T220)<br>
PULP BLEACHING:<br>
Several bleaching sequences were conducted to determine the bleaching response with the pulp treated according to the process of the invention compared to pulps prepared with no added compounds of the invention. The conditions used in the various bleach sequences were common for the paper industry.<br>
Bleach procedures:<br>
Pulp was prepared using the procedures described in the Kraft Cook Test section above. The pulp was thoroughly washed, so no carryover of the black liquor and/or compounds of the invention occurred.<br>
The following bleach sequences were tested,<br>
DEDED - Most pulp mills use a 5-stage bleaching sequence, a common one being the DEDED sequence. Pulp (30g, OD wt. basis) was bleached in doubled<br><br>
plastic bags at 10% consistency at KTC using a hot water bath. Chemical dosage was varied depending on the stage. Bleaching times for Do, Ei, Di, E2, and D2 were 150, 60, 90, 60 and 90 minutes, respectively. Residual chlorine dioxide was tested after each D stage. The pH exiting each bleach stage was also measured.<br>
DEopD - With the trend to reduce chlorine-containing bleaches, some mills have moved to a bleaching sequence similar to DEopD. Pulp (60g, OD wt. basis) was bleached in plastic bags for the D stages and used a Mark IV Quantum mixer or LSI200 Chemineer reactor for the Eop stage. The D stages were bleached at 70"C, whereas the Eop stage was at 90"C. The consistency was 10% for all three stages. The D stages had different amounts of chemical charge. The Eop stage used 1% peroxide, 3% caustic, 0.1% magnesium sulfate, and 30,40 or 100 psi oxygen gas. The pulp in the Eop stage was mixed for 4 seconds every 12 seconds. End pH, residuals and brightness were taken after every stage.<br>
DEopP - The D, Eop, and P stages used 60, 240, and 30 g pulp (OD wt, basis), respectively. The bleaching times were 90, 60 and 120 minutes, respectively. The bleaching temperatures were 70, 90 and 85-87^C, respectively. The D stage used 1% chlorine dioxide on pulp. The Eop stage used 1% peroxide, 3% caustic, 0.1% magnesium sulfate, and 30, 40 or 100 psi oxygen gas. This stage used both a Mark IV Quantum mixer and LSI200 Chemineer reactor for the bleaching. The P stage used 1% peroxide. 2% caustic, 0.1% magnesium sulfate, and 1.5% sodium silicate based on OD pulp. Residuals, end pH, and brighmess were determined after each stage.<br>
OPD - The O, P and D stages all used 60g pulp (OD wt, basis). The O stage used 2.5% caustic, 0.1% magnesium oxide, 90psi oxygen gas, 10 or 15% consistency, 45 minute retention time, and 90°C in a Mark FV Quantum mixer. The P stage used 2% caustic, 0.1% magnesium sulfate, 1.5% sodium silicate, 1.2% peroxide, 10% consistency, and 120 minutes at 85-88^C. The D stage used 0.8% chlorine dioxide, 0.3% caustic per 1% chlorine dioxide, and 90 minutes at 70°C. Residuals, end pH, and brightness were determined after each stage.<br>
Bleached Pulp Property Testing: In addition to the pulp tests described above, chlorine dioxide and hydrogen peroxide residual levels were determined by iodine back titration.<br><br>

concentrations. The pulp was recovered and tested and the results presented in Table<br>

The data in Table 3 demonstrates that the phosphonates of the invention<br>
produce pulp with lower kappa number, higher brightness and/or equivalent or<br>
improved strength properties.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 A series of Kraft cooks were performed on undried hardwood (aspen) wood<br>
chips according to the procedure described in the Pulping Description section of the<br>
Examples using either no phosphonate (control) or using inventive compounds<br>
Dequest 2066 or DTPA at various concentrations. The pulp was recovered and tested<br>
and the results presented in Table 4.<br>
The data in Table 4 demonstrates that Dequest 2066 and DTPA at effective<br>
concentrations produce pulp with lower kappa number, higher brightness and<br>
equivalent or improved strength properties.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 3 A series of Kraft cooks were performed on undried softwood (pine) wood<br>
chips according to the procedure described in the Pulping Description section of the<br>
Examples using either no phosphonate (control) or using inventive compounds<br>
Dequest 2066 or DTPA at various concentrations. The pulp was recovered and tested<br>
and the results presented in Table 5.<br>
The data in Table 5 demonstrates that DTPA and selected phosphonates of the<br>
invention produce pulp from softwood with lower kappa number, higher brightness or<br>
improved burst index. Generally, DTPA and all of the phosphonates tested produced<br>
pulp having higher burst index. Dequest products 2006,2016, 2060S, 6004 and 7000<br>
produced pulp having higher brightness, and Dequest products 2006,2016,2060S,<br>
6004 and 7000, and compound 4NHMP produced pulp with lower kappa number.<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
A series of Kraft cooks were performed on undried softwood (pine) wood<br>
chips according to the procedure described in the Pulping Description section of the Examples using either no phosphonate (control) or using inventive compounds Dequest products 2006 and 2054 at various concentrations. The pulp was recovered and tested and the results presented in Table 6.<br>
The data in Table 6 demonstrates that selected phosphonates of the invention produce pulp from softwood with lower kappa number and/or improved strength. Dequest product 2006 generally produced pulp having lower kappa number and improved strength, and Dequest product 2054 generally produced pulp with improved strength.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Kraft cooks were performed on undried hardwood (aspen) and softwood (pine)<br>
wood chips according to the procedure described in the Pulping Description section of the Examples using either no phosphonate (control) or using inventive compound Dequest 2066 or 2006 at 0.2 wt. % (as active acid based on the weight of wood chips (dry basis) charged to the digester). The pulp was recovered and tested and the results presented in Table 7.<br>
The data in Table 7 demonstrates that (at constant H-factor) a reduced amount of white liquor, i.e. alkali, can be used to achieve the same level of cook when using the phosphonate of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
A series of Kraft cooks were performed on undried hardwood (aspen) wood<br>
chips according to the procedure described in the Pulping Description section of the Examples using either no phosphonate (control) or using inventive compounds Dequest 2016 or 2066, or DTPA at various concentrations to test the effect of H-factor. The pulp was recovered and tested and the results presented in Table 8.<br>
The data in Table 8 demonstrates that Dequest 2016 and 2066, and DTPA at effective concentrations produce pulp with lower kappa number and higher brightness. Dequest 2016 and 2066 generally produce pulp with higher viscosity, with the effect with Dequest 2066 being more pronounced. As H-factor is reduced, e.g. at H-factors HF705 and HF558, the % reject is significantly less for pulps produced using Dequest 2016 and 2066, and DTPA.<br>
EXAMPLE? The pulps from the series of Kraft cooks performed in Example 6 were tested<br>
for pulp strength and the results presented in Table 9.<br>
The data in Table 9 demonstrates that Dequest 2016 and 2066 produce pulp<br>
with better overall strength properties, while DTPA produces pulp with comparable<br>
strength properties. These results are in addition to the improvement in pulp<br>
properties shown in Table 9.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLES The pulps from the series of Kraft cooks performed in Example 6 were tested<br>
for pulp fiber classification using both the Bauer-McNett and Kajaani methods and<br>
the results presented in Tables 10 and 11, respectively.<br>
In the Bauer-McNett method, the larger the number, the smaller the mesh opening and the reported values is the % of fibers that are retained at that screen size. For example, R14 means that the mesh has 14 openings per square inch. PlOO means the amount of fibers passing through the RlOO mesh screen. The data indicate that the pulps prepared according to the invention have slightly lower percentages of the fibers as medium and long fibers. This suggests that increased yield maintains shorter fibers in the recovered product.<br>
The data in Tables 10 and 11 demonstrate the impact of treating the pulp with these products in the digester. As can be seen after final pulp bleaching, the fiber length was not negatively impacted by treatment with the compounds of the invention in the digester. The W weighted average fiber length data in Table 11 is more useful for fiber length when making this comparison. As Dequest 2010 charge is increased, both fiber length and coarseness decrease slightly compared to the control, indicating more intense cooking of the fiber or more of the material attached to the fiber is being removed.<br>

A series of Kraft cooks were performed on undried hardwood (aspen) wood<br>
chips according to the procedure described in the Pulping Description section of the Examples using either no phosphonate (control) or using inventive phosphonate blends at various concentrations . The pulp was recovered and tested and the results presented in Table 12.<br>
The data in Table 12 demonstrates that the Dequest blends all produced pulps with lower kappa number and higher brightness. The Dequest blends also produced pulp with comparable or higher yields. In addition, the Dequest blends generally had lower % reject than the control.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

A series of Kraft cooks were performed on undried hardwood (aspen) wood<br>
chips according to the procedure described in the Pulping Description section of the Examples using either no phosphonate (control) or using Dequest 2046 at 0.2 wt. % concentration. The pulp was recovered and tested and the results presented in Table 13.<br>
The data in Table 13 demonstrates that Dequest 2046 produced pulps with lower kappa number and higher brightness. Dequest 2046 also produced pulp with comparable or higher yield depending on the H-factor used, [n addition, Dequest 2046 had lower % reject than the control.<br>

The pulp was recovered and tested and the results presented in Table 14.<br>
The data in Table 14 demonstrates that compound 4NHMP and Blend 83B produced pulps with higher brightness. Compound 4NHMP and Blend 83B also produced pulp with comparable or higher tensile strength depending on the H-factor used. TABLE 13: Hardwood (Aspen) Kraft Pulp Cooks Using Dequest 2046<br><br><br>

EXAMPLE 32 Multiple Kraft cooks were performed in a custom-made laboratory-scale<br>
multiple digester equipment and the results presented in Table 35. The digester<br>
equipment consisted of seven Parr bomb reactors (approx. 1 L) in a carousel that were<br>
rotated through a temperature-controlled oil bath. Aspen wood chips and white liquor<br>
used in the Kraft cooks were obtained from a commercial pulp mill located in the<br>
Upper Midwestern United States. The wood chips used were hand picked to reduce<br>
variability. Pulping conditions were: liquorrwood weight ratio of 4:1, 16% active<br>
alkali and 26.7% sulfidity. The digester temperature was ramped from ambient<br>
temperature to 170°C in approximately 72 minutes. The H-factor was varied in the<br>
cooks conducted.<br>
Yield was determined as follows. Pulps were completely transferred from the Parr bomb reactors to individual containers. The pulps were disintegrated for one minute and filtered to remove liquid, followed by air drying in a ventilated hood in aluminum trays overnight. Total yield of solids from the above air-dried pulps was determined by the formula: Total Yield = (total solid weight of air-dried pulp recovered* 100)/(weight of OD wood chip used).<br>
Reject was determined as follows. Pulps were screened using a vibrating screener with a 200 mesh screen, and the total material retained on the screen was weighed after drying in an oven overnight. Reject % was determined by the formula: Reject % = (weight OD retained material* 100)/(weight of OD wood chip used).<br>
The data in Table 35 demonstrate that the use of Dequest 2016 and Dequest 2066 in the Kraft cooks resulted in increased yields compared to the control without phosphonate.<br>
