Method for increasing the capacity of an installation used<br>
to carry out an industrial process<br>
The invention relates to a method for increasing the<br>
capacity of an installation used to carry out an industrial<br>
process.<br>
An increase of a few percentage points in the capacity of an<br>
installation for carrying out an industrial process results<br>
as a rule in a disproportionately high improvement in<br>
profits for the operator of the installation. This type of<br>
industrial process can typically be a process with<br>
production lines which run through the installation, such as<br>
lines for the manufacture of paper, textiles, plastics or<br>
metal foils. With such processes the capacity of the process<br>
is determined by the speed of the track, e.g. measured in<br>
meters per second.<br>
When a machine part for a machine contained in the<br>
installation pr a complete part of the installation is<br>
designed for such an installation, this is mostly done on<br>
the basis of similar machines or parts of the installation,<br>
taking into account a certain amount of capacity reserve.<br>
However, under the operating conditions which actually occur<br>
in the installation, the loads imposed on the machine or the<br>
parts of the installation are mostly different to those in<br>
previously known installations. It is thus not possible to<br>
say with any certainty in what way it is possible to<br>
increase the capacity of an installation without overloading<br>
one or more parts of the installation.<br>
Previous measures for increasing the capacity in such<br>
installations, especially in complex installations such as<br><br>
installations for carrying out continuous processes for<br>
manufacturing of goods on a production line have also<br>
generally lacked long-term sustainability.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to specify<br>
a method which allows the capacity of an installation to be<br>
increased in a sustained and economical manner.<br>
This object is achieved in accordance with the invention by<br>
a method in accordance with claim 1. Advantageous<br>
embodiments of the method are the object of subclaims 2 to 9<br>
 in each case.<br>
The invention in this case is based on the knowledge that<br>
previous measures for increasing the capacity in<br>
installations has always only been based on considering<br>
particular points in the installation and has therefore as a<br>
rule ignored long-term sustainability. The determination of<br>
the process variables relevant to the capacity of the<br>
installation envisaged by the invention and the recording of<br>
these variables under changing operating conditions<br>
guarantees that all aspects of the influencing factors<br>
restricting the capacity of the installation will be taken<br>
into consideration. Changing operating conditions here are<br>
taken to mean the operating conditions occurring during<br>
regular operation of the installation, i.e. in the case of a<br>
paper machine the operation of the machine with paper of<br>
different qualities and types for example. This avoids<br>
looking at only a few specific individual aspects of the<br>
installation such as the drive system, under a number of<br>
specific operating conditions, but not taking into account<br>
other factors and operating conditions which dictate the<br>
capacity. As a result this makes not just a short-term<br>
increase, but a sustained increase in capacity possible.<br><br>
The smallest control reserve of the control loops determines<br>
the increase in capacity which can be obtained without any<br>
further measures. This guarantees that first of all the<br>
existing capacity reserves that can be secured are checked<br>
and these reserves are secured if necessary. This represents<br>
the increase in capacity that can be most easily achieved<br>
from the economic standpoint.<br>
If the aim is to use additional measures to obtain an<br>
increase in capacity which goes beyond the existing capacity<br>
reserve, this can be done by defining a capacity increase<br>
target for the installation, determining the necessary<br>
control reserves in the control loops for the desired<br>
increase in capacity and determining the control loops with<br>
a control reserve which is too low for the desired capacity<br>
increase.<br>
From the number of control loops with control reserves which<br>
are too low it is already evident v/hat effort will be needed<br>
for further investigations and possibly also for the<br>
implementation of measures for increasing capacity. With a<br>
large number of control loops a decision can be taken under<br>
some circumstances to define a smaller increase in capacity,<br>
so that further investigations are only required for the<br>
correspondingly smaller number of control loops.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention<br>
further steps include a technical and/or technological<br>
investigation of the control loops with a control reserve<br>
which is too small and formulation of measures for producing<br>
the control reserves needed in each case by relieving the<br>
load on the relevant control loops and/or by replacing<br>
components in the relevant control loops by higher-<br>
performance components<br><br>
These measures can finally be evaluated from a technical and<br>
or commercial standpoint. On the basis of this evaluation<br>
the decision process for the implementation of the<br>
improvement measures can be simplified and a solution found<br>
which is the optimum solution for the operator of the<br>
installation from the cost/benefits standpoint.<br>
Overall the sequence of the above steps ensures that<br>
priority is given to dealing with the points for which there<br>
is the greatest potential for improvement or for which the<br>
cost effectiveness of a conversion is the greatest. At the<br>
same time this process allows available capacity reserves to<br>
be secured in the most economical way even in a highly-<br>
complex installation.<br>
The method in accordance with the invention is especially<br>
suitable for increasing the capacity in an installation for<br>
executing a continuous process, especially a process for<br>
manufacturing,goods on production lines, e.g. paper,<br>
textiles, plastic or metal foils, for which the capacity is<br>
determined by the speed of the production line.<br>
The invention as well as a further advantageous embodiments<br>
of the invention in accordance with the features of the<br>
subclaims are explained in more detail below with reference<br>
to exemplary embodiments in the figures. The accompanying Figures show:<br>
FIG 1 a recording of process variables in an installation<br>
for manufacturing paper,<br>
FIG 2 a representation of an inventive process sequence<br>
depicted as a flowchart,<br>
FIG 3 a basic diagram for determining the process<br>
variables relevant for the capacity of an<br><br>
installation,<br>
FIG 4 a diagram of the process variables relevant for a<br>
paper machine,<br>
FIG 5 a machine velocity/moment diagram for determining<br>
the control reserve for a drive motor and<br>
FIG 6 a determination of the control reserve for the drive<br>
motor of FIG 5.<br>
FIG 1 shows an installation 1 for manufacturing paper. The<br>
installation 1 comprises a wide diversity of installation<br>
parts which are needed for the different steps in the<br>
production process for paper, for example a material<br>
preparation system la, a paper machine'1b, a roller/calendar<br>
1c, roll cutter 1d and cross cutter 1e. The paper runs as a<br>
production line 8 through major parts of the installation 1.<br>
The installation 1 features a plurality of drive components<br>
11, automation components 12 and energy supply components 13<br>
for driving, supplying power to and controlling the<br>
different components in the production process.<br>
A device 2 is used to determine the control reserves in the<br>
installation 1. The device 2 features a recording unit 3, an<br>
evaluation unit 4, an input unit 7 and an output unit 5.<br>
The recording unit 3 is used for recording process variables<br>
P1 ...P10 of the paper production process on the<br>
installation 1. This can for example involve measurement<br>
signals which are recorded using signal generators already<br>
present and/or to be provided in the installation 1.<br>
The process variables can originate from a wide diversity of<br>
sources of the processor and be present in any form,<br><br>
including different forms, e.g. analog, binary, numeric<br>
and/or as a changeable physical variable. The evaluation<br>
unit 4 is used for determining the control reserves in the<br>
control loops of the installation 1. To this end a large<br>
number of characteristic capacity curves for a plurality of<br>
components, especially standard components occurring in the<br>
installation are stored in a memory of the evaluation unit<br>
4. The output unit 5 can be used to present the control<br>
reserves for display. Furthermore the device 2 features an<br>
input unit 7 for entering a desired capacity increase into<br>
the installation 1.<br>
In FIG 2 the method in accordance with the invention is<br>
explained on the basis of a flowchart. The procedure is<br>
advantageously carried out by a service provider who has the<br>
appropriate know-how and technical facilities to do so.<br>
In a first step 31 - as explained in detail in FIG 3 and 4 -<br>
the process variables relevant for a capacity of the<br>
installation are determined. In a second step 32 these<br>
process variables are recorded under changing operating<br>
conditions of the installation, and in a third step 33 - as<br>
illustrated by the examples in FIG 5 and 6 - a smallest<br>
control reserve of the control loops of the installation is<br>
determined on the basis of the recorded process variables.<br>
This control reserve can be used to increase the capacity of<br>
the installation without any appreciable investment outlay.<br>
In a step 33a a check is therefore made as to whether an<br>
increase in capacity beyond this smallest control reserve is<br>
desired. If this is not required, the procedure can be ended<br>
in step 39b, by securing the available capacity reserve.<br>
If an increase in the capacity of the installation which<br>
exceeds the reserve is required, in a further procedural<br><br>
step 34 such a desired capacity increase of the installation<br>
can be defined. In a further step 35 the control reserves<br>
necessary for the desired increase in capacity are<br>
determined in the control loops of the installation and in a<br>
further step 36 the control loops with a control reserve<br>
which is too small for the desired capacity increase are<br>
determined.<br>
For the control loops with a control reserve which is too<br>
small, technical and/or technological investigations of the<br>
control loops can be performed in a further step 37 to<br>
establish the control reserves needed in each case by<br>
relieving the load on the relevant control loops and/or<br>
through replacing components in the relevant control loops<br>
by more powerful components. In a further step 38 a<br>
technical and/or commercial evaluation of these measures can<br>
be undertaken, on the basis of which a final implementation<br>
of the measures is undertaken in step 39a.<br>
The process variables relevant for the capacity of an<br>
installation can be easily established in this way by<br>
applying in the more general sense the method of "cutting<br>
free" known per se from technical mechanics.<br>
This is done in a first step by determining a process<br>
variable representing the capacity of the installation. in<br>
the case of an installation for paper production this might<br>
typically be the speed of the paper in the installation<br>
In a next step, as basically shown in FIG 3, a core process<br>
6 of the installation is defined and all interfaces 21 - 25<br>
of the core process 6 to the ancillary processes 41 - 45<br>
surrounding it (e.g. ancillary processes for energy, water<br>
and compressed air supply) are determined and investigated<br>
for their effect in relation to this representational<br><br>
process variable. This can be done by measuring the physical<br>
effects (e.g. forces, currents, fields, throughflows,<br>
pressures) at these interfaces. These physical effects of<br>
process variables can be measured by signal generators<br>
already present and/or to be provided, which if necessary<br>
must be accommodated at the interfaces.<br>
If there is a effect relationship with the representational<br>
process variable at an interface, a process variable which<br>
is relevant to the capacity of the installation is present<br>
at this interface and a more precise technical investigation<br>
is undertaken for the components of the ancillary process to<br>
determine the control reserve. The interfaces which do not<br>
have an effect relationship are not considered any further<br>
and instead the interfaces the interfaces are drawn closer<br>
to the core process or moved to within the core process and<br>
an investigation is conducted at these new interfaces for an<br>
effect relationship with the representational process<br>
variable. In this case too interfaces with an effect<br>
relationship to the representational process variable are<br>
identified as relevant process variables for which in<br>
further steps more precise technical investigations for<br>
determining the control reserves are to be performed.<br>
Such a systematic, step-by-step "drawing closer" of the<br>
interfaces of the ancillary process into the core process<br>
ensures that all of the process variables relevant for<br>
determining the capacity of the installation are determined<br>
not only in the area of the core process but also in the<br>
area of the ancillary processes.<br>
In the case of an installation for paper production the<br>
subprocess running on the paper machine can be defined as<br>
the core process for example. Interfaces to ancillary<br><br>
processes with effect relationships to the speed of the<br>
paper passing through the installation are then to be found<br>
in the area of material and energy flows, for example for<br>
feeding energy, steam, water, fibers, chemicals and<br>
additives as well as for removal of water, condensate and<br>
waste heat. The relevant process variables in the area of<br>
the ancillary processes are thus in this case - as shown in<br>
FIG 4 - the supply of energy 51 (e.g. measured as power P),<br>
the supply of steam 52 (measured as volume per unit of<br>
time), the supply of water 53 (measured as volume per unit<br>
of time) the supply of fibers 54 (measured as mass per unit<br>
of time), the supply of chemicals 55 (measured as mass per<br>
unit of time) the removal of water 56 (measured as volume<br>
per unit of time), the removal of condensate 57 (measured as<br>
volume per unit of time) and the removal of waste heat 58<br>
(measured as power P). These relevant process variables can<br>
only be recorded under changing operating conditions of the<br>
installation, e.g. for different qualities and types of<br>
paper, and - as explained below - the control reserves in<br>
the control loops of the installation for paper production<br>
determined.<br>
An advantageous procedure for determining the control<br>
reserve for an electric motor for driving a paper machine of<br>
installation 1 in accordance with FIG. 1 will be explained<br>
with the aid of FIG 5 and FIG. 6. The procedure is basically<br>
also applicable to other control loops of the installation<br>
(e.g. steam, vacuum, coating).<br>
At a defined velocity v of the paper in the paper machine a<br>
defined load (moment) M is present at the electric motor.<br>
This operating point defines a specific class K in the<br>
speed/load plane v/M shown in FIG 4. For each class K the<br>
time (duration) T is counted in which the motor is operated<br><br>
in this class and shown in a plane perpendicular to the v/M<br>
plane. The classes K with the longest times can thus be<br>
determined. These can subsequently be approximately<br>
described by a linear relationship between moment M and<br>
machine velocity v described and represented by a straight<br>
line gradient G. Basically the relationship between moment M<br>
and machine velocity v can naturally also be described<br>
through complex functions.<br>
The diagram in FIG 6 shows the moment M of the motor over<br>
the velocity v of the machine, with these two parameters<br>
being approximated by a linear relationship in accordance<br>
with FIG. 4 represented by the straight line gradient G.<br>
With a speed-regulated drive the maximum power of a motor or<br>
a converter (depending on which is the smaller) is a<br>
hyperbolic curve HK in the velocity/moment plane v/M. The<br>
distance RV of this hyperbolic curve HK to the straight line<br>
gradient G is a measure for the control reserve and thereby<br>
for the maximum possible increase in speed.<br>
In the case of determination of the control reserve for<br>
example with regard to the positioning of a vacuum or steam<br>
control valve, velocity and load of an ancillary drive, of<br>
fluid streams etc. the machine velocity can also be plotted<br>
by the position of the valve, the speed of the ancillary<br>
drive or the fluid stream instead of via the load, the<br>
duration determined and the approximately linear or complex<br>
relationship with the velocity v determined.<br>
The processes to be considered in the case of an<br>
installation with a continuous production process, e.g. an<br>
installation for paper production, are as a rule not very<br>
dynamic. The dynamic components in the process variables are<br>
not even of primary interest for the determination of the<br><br>
control reserves. Of greater interest instead is the average<br>
long-term behavior of the process variables. The process<br>
variables are therefore preferably filtered (appr. 2 s) and<br>
only sampled appr. every 5s.<br>
Preferably an online evaluation of the recorded data with<br>
subsequent data compression is undertaken for a subsequent<br>
offline evaluation of the recorded data.<br><br>
