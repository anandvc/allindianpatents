WE CLAIM<br>
1.	Cooling  device  for  a  quenching  operation<br>
during the continuous annealing treatment of a flat product in<br>
the form of a metal strip (2), preferably a steel strip, said<br>
device:<br>
-	being  located  in  an  essentially  vertical,  ascending  or<br>
descending path;<br>
-	comprising an overflow weir (4) in which a series of tubes (1)<br>
are completely immersed and stacked more or less vertically<br>
and symmetrically along each side of the strip (2) and which<br>
each eject onto the strip a cooling fluid in the form of<br>
essentially horizontal turbulent jets through a slit or a<br>
series of holes;<br>
-	being provided in its lower part with a sealing means (3);<br>
wherein any two successive tubes (1) located on a same side of<br>
the strip (2) are separated by a gap (B) that is identical for<br>
all tubes (1), chosen at a given value of specific flow rate of<br>
the cooling fluid, expressed in cubic metres per hour and per<br>
square metre of a surface of the strip so as to minimise the<br>
loss of flow in the evacuation passages corresponding to said<br>
gap (B) .<br>
2.	Device as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the<br>
wall of the overflow weir (4), located at the back of the tubes<br>
(1), has a width at least equal to that of the tubes (1) and the horizontal distance of this wall relative to the back of the tubes (1) is selected so that the loss of flow caused by the presence of the overflow weir (4) is less than 5% of the loss of flow caused by the gaps (B) between two successive tubes (1).<br>
3.	Device as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2,<br>
wherein the specific flow rate of the cooling fluid is between<br>
250 and 1,000m3 per hour, per m2 and per surface of the strip.<br>
4.	Device as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein<br>
the loss of flow caused by the gaps (B) is less than a 150mm<br>
column of water.<br><br>
5.	Device as claimed in any one of the preceding<br>
claims, wherein the distance (A) between the end of each tube<br>
(1) and the strip (2) is identical for all tubes and is between<br>
20mm and 200mm.<br>
6.	Device as claimed in any one of the preceding<br>
claims, wherein said tubes (1) have a rectangular section.<br>
7.	Device as claimed in any one of the preceding<br>
claims, wherein said sealing means (3)  comprises a lock with<br>
pairs of rollers that allow both the passage of the strip (2)<br>
and the creation of a loss of flow limiting to a minimum value<br>
the leaks from the overflow weir (4) downwards, and a means for<br>
injecting a fluid between said pairs of rollers, with control of<br>
the pressure and/or temperature.<br>
8.	Device as claimed in any one of the preceding<br>
claims, wherein the upper tube (1) is provided with a block (5)<br>
whose height is at least equal to the total of the thickness of<br>
the films of water (H) in the overflow weir and of the height of<br>
the column of water  (AH)  corresponding to the loss of flow<br>
between the tubes at maximum flow rate.<br>
9.	Quenching  method  during  the  continuous<br>
annealing treatment of a flat product in the form of a metal<br>
strip,  preferably  a  steel  strip,  implementing  a  device  as<br>
claimed in any one of the preceding claims,  to achieve a<br>
specific cooling power between l,OOOkW/m2 and 10,OOOkW/m2 per<br>
surface of metal product.<br>
10.	Method as claimed in Claim 9, the temperature<br>
of the strip upon entry in the device is between 350°C and 750°C<br>
and the  temperature  upon  exit  is  between  50°C  and  450°C,<br>
preferably between 50°C and 100°C or between 350°C and 450°C.<br>
11.	Cooling  device  for  a  quenching  operation<br>
substantially as herein described with reference to and as<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
12. Quenching method during the continuous annealing treatment substantially as herein described with reference to and as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br></td>
