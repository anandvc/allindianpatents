It has been found that compounds of formula I are useful as lipid modulators<br>
and insulin sensitizers. In particular, compounds of formula I are PPAR activators.<br>
Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPARs) are members of the<br>
nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. The PPARs are ligand-activated transcription<br>
factors that regulate gene expression and control multiple metabolic pathways. Three<br>
subtypes have been described which are PPARa, PPAR5 (also known as PPARP),<br>
and PPARy. PPAR8 is ubiquitously expressed. PPARa is predominantly expressed in<br>
the liver, kidney and heart. There are at least two major isoforms of PPARy. PPARy 1<br>
is expressed in most tissues, and the longer isoform, PPARy2 is almost exclusively<br>
expressed in adipose tissue. The PPARs modulate a variety of physiological responses<br>
including regulation of glucose- and lipid- homeostasis and metabolism, energy<br>
balance, cell differentiation, inflammation and cardiovascular events.<br>
Approximately half of all patients with coronary artery disease have low<br>
concentrations of plasma HDL cholesterol. The atheroprotective function of HDL was<br>
first highlighted almost 25 years ago and stimulated exploration of the genetic and<br>
environmental factors that influence HDL levels. The protective function of HDL<br>
comes from its role in a process termed reverse cholesterol transport. HDL mediates<br>
the removal of cholesterol from cells in peripheral tissues including those in the<br>
atherosclerotic lesions of the arterial wall. HDL then delivers its cholesterol to the<br>
liver and sterol-metabolizing organs for conversion to bile and elimination. Data from<br>
the Framingham study showed that HDL-C levels are predictive of coronary artery<br>
disease risk independently of LDL-C levels. The estimated age-adjusted prevalence<br>
among Americans age 20 and older who have HDL-C of less than 35 mg/dl is 16%<br>
(males) and 5.7% (females). A substantial increase of HDL-C is currently achieved by<br>
treatment with niacin in various formulations. However, the substantial side-effects<br>
limit the therapeutic potential of this approach.<br>
As many as 90% of the 14 million diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients in the US<br>
are overweight or obese, and a high proportion of type 2 diabetic patients have<br>
abnormal concentrations of lipoproteins. The prevalence of total cholesterol &gt; 240<br>
mg/dl is 37% in diabetic men and 44% in women. The respective rates for LDL-C &gt;<br>
160 mg/dl are 31% and 44%, respectively, and for HDL-C 
respectively. Diabetes is a disease in which a patient's ability to control glucose levels<br>
in blood is decreased because of partial impairment in response to the action of<br>
insulin. Type II diabetes (T2D) is also called non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus<br>
(NIDDM) and afflicts 80-90 % of all diabetic patients in developed countries. In T2D,<br>
the pancreatic Islets of Langerhans continue to produce insulin. However, the target<br>
organs for insulin action, mainly muscle, liver and adipose tissue, exhibit a profound<br>
resistance to insulin stimulation. The body continues to compensate by producing<br>
unphysiologically high levels of insulin, which ultimately decreases in later stage of<br>
disease, due to exhaustion and failure of pancreatic insulin-producing capacity. Thus<br>
T2D is a cardiovascular-metabolic syndrome associated with multiple comorbidities<br>
including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and<br>
inflammatory atherosclerosis.<br>
First line treatment for dyslipidemia and diabetes generally involves a low-fat<br>
and low-glucose diet, exercise and weight loss. However, compliance can be<br>
moderate, and as the disease progresses, treatment of the various metabolic<br>
deficiencies becomes necessary with e.g. lipid-modulating agents such as statins and<br>
fibrates for dyslipidemia and hypoglycemic drugs, e.g. sulfonylureas or metformin for<br>
insulin resistance. A promising new class of drugs has recently been introduced that<br>
resensitizes patients to their own insulin (insulin sensitizers), thereby restoring blood<br>
glucose and triglyceride levels to normal, and in many cases, obviating or reducing the<br>
requirement for exogenous insulin. Pioglitazone (Actosâ„¢) and rosiglitazone<br>
(Avandiaâ„¢) belong to the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of PPARy-agonists and were<br>
the first in their class to be approved for NIDDM in several countries. These<br>
compounds, however, suffer from side effects, including rare but severe liver toxicity<br>
(as seen with troglitazone). They also increase body weight in patients. Therefore,<br>
new, more efficacious drugs with greater safety and lower side effects are urgently<br>
needed. Recent studies provide evidence that agonism of PPAR8 would result in<br>
compounds with enhanced therapeutic potential, i. e. such compounds should improve<br>
the lipid profile, with a superior effect on HDL-C raising compared to current<br>
treatments and with additional positive effects on normalization of insulin-levels<br>
(Oliver et al; Proc Nat Acad Sci USA 2001; 98: 5306-11). Recent observations also<br>
suggest that there is a independent PPARcc mediated effect on insulin-sensitzation in<br>
addition to its well known role in reducing triglycerides (Guerre-Millo et al; J Biol<br>
Chem 2000; 275: 16638-16642). Thus selective PPAR8 agonists or PPAR8 agonists<br>
with additional PPARoc activity may show superior therapeutic efficacy without the<br>
side-effects such as the weight gain seen with PPARy agonists.<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention exceed the compounds known in<br>
the art, inasmuch as they bind to and selectively activate PPAR8 or coactivate PPARS<br>
and PPARcc simultaneously and very efficiently, and with much improved<br>
pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, these compounds combine the antidyslipidemic<br>
and anti-glycemic effects of PPARS and PPARa activation with no<br>
effect on PPARy. Consequently, HDL cholesterol is increased, triglycerides lowered<br>
(=improved lipid profile) and plasma glucose and insulin are reduced (=insulin<br>
sensitization). In addition, such compounds may also lower LDL cholesterol, decrease<br>
blood pressure and counteract inflammatory atherosclerosis. Furthermore, such<br>
compounds may also be useful for treating inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid<br>
arthritis, osteoarthritis, and psoriasis. Since multiple facets of combined dyslipidemia<br>
and the T2D disease syndrome are addressed by PPAR8-selective agonists and<br>
PPAR8 and a coagonists, they are expected to have an enhanced therapeutic potential<br>
compared to the compounds already known in the art.<br>
The compounds of the present invention further exhibit improved<br>
pharmacological properties compared to known compounds.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) can be manufactured by the methods given<br>
below, by the methods given in the examples or by analogous methods. Appropriate<br>
reaction conditions for the individual reaction steps are known to a person skilled in<br>
the art. Starting materials are either commercially available or can be prepared by<br>
methods analogous to the methods given below, by methods described in references<br>
cited in the text or in the examples, or by methods known in the art.<br>
The synthesis of compounds with the general structure I of the present<br>
invention, particularly compounds according to formula la (scheme 1) with X equal to<br>
oxygen can be accomplished according to scheme 1.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
6-Hydroxyindoles 1 and the regioisomeric 4-, 5- and 7-hydroxyindoles are<br>
commercially available, known or can be synthesized by methods known in the art.<br>
The hydroxy function of compounds 1 can be protected by methods described in the<br>
literature, e. g. by treating them with tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride in the presence of<br>
imidazole, preferably at room temperature in solvents like N,N-dimethylformamide, to<br>
obtain the corresponding tert-butyldimethylsilyl ethers 2 (step a). N-Alkylation of<br>
intermediates 2 with carboxylic acid esters 3, where R15 can be equal to e. g. chlorine,<br>
bromine, triflate, or another leaving group, delivers indoles 4 and can be performed by<br>
standard technology; e. g. in the presence of K^COs or CS2CO3 at temperatures<br>
between 10 Â°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent in a solvent like acetonitrile<br>
or acetone or in the presence of sodium hydride at temperatures between -10 Â°C and<br>
50 Â°C in a solvent like N,N-dimethylformamide (step b). Ester derivatives 3 are<br>
commercially available or can be synthesized by methods known in the art.<br>
Deprotection of indoles 4 by methods described in the literature, e. g. by treatment<br>
with tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride at temperatures between -15 Â°C and ambient<br>
temperature in a solvent like tetrahydrofuran, provided that the protection group is a<br>
silyl ether, gives hydroxyindoles 5 (step c). Alkyne compounds 6 (prepared as outlined<br>
in schemes 5 to 7) are condensed with hydroxyindoles 5 according to well known<br>
procedures: if R14 represents a hydroxy group e. g. via Mitsunobu-reaction, with<br>
triphenylphosphine and di-tert-butyl-, diisopropyl- or diethyl-azodicarboxylate as<br>
reagents, or by using tributylphosphine and N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl azodicarboxamide;<br>
this transformation is preferably carried out in a solvent like toluene, dichloromethane<br>
or tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature. Alternatively, if R14 represents a halide,<br>
mesylate or tosylate moiety, alkyne compounds 6 can be reacted with hydroxyindoles<br>
5 in solvents like N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, acetone or methyl-ethyl<br>
ketone in the presence of a base like cesium or potassium carbonate in a temperature<br>
ranging from room temperature to 140 Â°C, preferably around 50 Â°C, to yield ether<br>
compounds la (step d). Alkynes 6 with R14 = OH can also be transformed in situ to<br>
the corresponding triflates by treatment with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride / 2,6-<br>
di-tert-butylpyridine in dichloromethane at 0 Â°C to room temperature. The triflates are<br>
then reacted with hydroxyindoles 5 in solvents like N,N-dimethylformamide,<br>
dimethylsulfoxide, acetonitrile, acetone or methyl-ethyl ketone in the presence of a<br>
base like cesium or potassium carbonate at a temperature ranging from room<br>
temperature to 140 Â°C, preferably around 50 Â°C to yield ether compounds la (step d).<br>
Carboxylic acid esters la can alternatively be synthesized via regioselective<br>
condensation of alkynes 6 with hydroxyindoles 1 under the conditions given in step d<br>
(step e) and subsequent N-alkylation of the obtained ethers 7 with alkylating reagents<br>
3 as described for the synthesis of esters 4 in step b (step f). In addition, indoles 7 or<br>
esters la with R12 equal to hydrogen can be subjected to Sonogashira coupling<br>
conditions (e.g. see descriptions in schemes 5 and 6 or Natchus, Michael G.;<br>
Bookland, Roger G.; Laufersweiler, Matthew J.; Pikul, Staszek; Almstead, Neil G.;<br>
De, Biswanath; Janusz, Michael J.; Hsieh, Lily C.; Gu, Fei; Pokross, Matthew E.;<br>
Patel, Vikram S.; Garver, Susan M.; Peng, Sean X.; Branch, Todd M.; King, Selane<br>
L.; Baker, Timothy R.; Foltz, David J.; Mieling, Glen E. Journal of Medicinal<br>
Chemistry (2001), 44(7), 1060-1071) to give alkynes 7 with R12 * H or the final<br>
compounds la, respectively. Esters of formula la can optionally be hydrolyzed<br>
according to standard procedures, e. g. by treatment with an alkali hydroxide like<br>
LiOH or NaOH in a polar solvent mixture like tetrahydrofuran/ ethanol/ water leading<br>
to carboxylic acids la. If the alkyne compounds 6 (prepared as described in schemes 5<br>
to 7) and/or the hydroxyindoles 5 contain chiral centers, ester compounds la and<br>
carboxylic acids la can be obtained as mixtures of diastereomers or enantiomers,<br>
which can be separated by methods well known in the art, e. g. (chiral) HPLC or<br>
crystallization.<br>
An analogous reaction scheme with the same reaction sequences applies for the<br>
isomeric compound series leading to compounds of general formula I, particularly<br>
compounds according to formula Ib:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The synthesis of compounds with the general structure I, particularly<br>
compounds with X equal to S can be accomplished in close analogy to the synthesis of<br>
the corresponding analogues with X equal to oxygen. Suitable sulfur containing<br>
intermediates are known, can be prepared by methods known in the art (compare e. g.<br>
M. Matsumoto, N. Watanabe, Heterocycles 1987, 26, 913-916 or E. Piers, V. B.<br>
Haarstadt, R. J. Cushley, R. K. Brown, Canadian Journal of Chemistry 1962, 40, 511-<br>
517) or can be prepared from suitable intermediates carrying an aromatic hydroxy<br>
function. In such intermediates, optionally carrying one or more protective functions,<br>
the aromatic OH group can be replaced by the corresponding aromatic SH function by<br>
methods known in the art. For example by a three step sequence as described in J.<br>
Labelled Compounds &amp; Radiopharmaceuticals 43(7), 683-691, (2000): i)<br>
transformation of the aromatic hydroxy moiety into its trifluoromethanesulfonate<br>
(triflic anhydride, triethylamine, dichloromethane, at low temperature, preferably<br>
around -30 Â°C); ii) treatment of the triflate with triisopropylsilanethiolate,<br>
tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(0) in solvent mixtures like toluene and<br>
tetrahydrofuran in a temperature range between 60 Â°C and 150 Â°C; iii) treatment of the<br>
silyl sulfide with hydrogen chloride in methanol preferably around 0 Â°C to liberate the<br>
aromatic SH moiety.<br>
The synthesis of compounds with the general structure I, particularly<br>
compounds according to formula Ic, with X equal to nitrogen, can be accomplished<br>
according to scheme 2.<br>
Scheme 2<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
6-Aminoindoles 1 and the regioisomeric 4-, 5- and 7-aminoindoles are<br>
commercially available, known or can be synthesized by methods known in the art, e.<br>
g. starting from the analogous hydroxyindoles. In such intermediates, optionally<br>
carrying one or more protective functions, the aromatic hydroxy group can be replaced<br>
by an amino function, e. g. by applying the following three step sequence described in<br>
Tetrahedron Letters 43(42), 7617-7619(2002): i) transformation of the hydroxyindole<br>
moiety into its trifluoro-methanesulfonate (triflic anhydride, 2,6-lutidine, 4-<br>
dimethylaminopyridine, dichloromethane, 0 Â°C to room temperature; ii) treatment of<br>
the triflate with benzophenone imine, di-palladium-tris(dibenzylideneacetone)<br>
complex, S-(-)-2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-l,l'-binaphthyl, cesium carbonate,<br>
toluene, in a Schlenk tube at temperatures around 120 Â°C; iii) treatment with catalytic<br>
amounts of hydrochloric acid in wet tetrahydrofuran preferably at room temperature to<br>
liberate the aromatic NH2 moiety. This amino function of compounds 1 can be<br>
protected by methods described in the literature, e. g. by treatment with di-tert-butyl<br>
dicarbonate optionally in the presence of a base like e. g. triethylamine, preferably at<br>
ambient temperature in solvents like methanol, tetrahydrofuran or dichloromethane, to<br>
yield indoles 2 (step a). Alkylation of intermediates 2 at the nitrogen in position 1 with<br>
carboxylic acid ester 3, where R15 can be equal to e. g. chlorine, bromine, triflate or<br>
another leaving group, delivers indoles 4 and can be performed by standard<br>
technology; e. g. in the presence of K^COs or CS2CO3 at temperatures between 10 Â°C<br>
and the reflux temperature of the solvent in a solvent like acetonitrile, acetone or N,Ndimethylformamide<br>
(step b). Removal of the protecting group under standard<br>
conditions, e. g. by using hydrochloric acid in ethyl acetate, preferably at temperatures<br>
between 0 Â°C and ambient temperature, affords amines 5 with R13 being equal to<br>
hydrogen (step c). Intermediates 4 can optionally be alkylated at the nitrogen in 6-<br>
position using sodium hydride and a reactive alkyl halogenide/mesylate or triflate to<br>
give compounds 6 (step d) which can be deprotected as described in step c to obtain<br>
amines 5 with R13 * hydrogen (step e). Reaction of aminoindoles 5 with alkynes 7<br>
(prepared as outlined in schemes 5 to 7) using sodium hydride or sodium, potassium<br>
or cesium carbonate in N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide,<br>
dimethylacetamide or tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature ranging from 0 Â°C to 140 Â°C,<br>
preferably at ambient temperature, leads to compounds Ic (step f). Alternatively,<br>
alkynes 7 with R14 = OH can be transformed in situ to the coresponding triflates by<br>
treatment with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride/2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine in<br>
dichloromethane at 0 Â°C. These triflates are then reacted with amines 5 in the presence<br>
of a base such as sodium hydride in solvents like nitromethane at temperatures<br>
between ambient temperature and 60 Â°C to yield compounds Ic [following a<br>
procedure from Belostotskii, Anatoly M., Hassner, A., Tetrahedron Lett. 1994,<br>
35(28), 5075-6] (step f). Further, steps d and f can be exchanged to synthesize<br>
compounds Ic with R13 * hydrogen and steps f and c can be exchanged in order to<br>
synthesize compounds Ic with R13 being equal to hydrogen. In addition, secondary<br>
amines Ic (R13 = H) can be reductively methylated with an aqueous solution of<br>
NaH^POs and formaldehyde at temperatures between ambient temperature and 65 Â°C<br>
[Loibner, H., Pruckner, A., Stuetz, A., Tetrahedron Lett. 1984, 25, 2535-2536] to give<br>
compounds Ic with R13 = Me. Alternatively, esters Ic with R12 equal to hydrogen can<br>
be subjected to Sonogashira coupling conditions (e.g. see descriptions in schemes 5<br>
and 6 or Natchus, Michael G.; Bookland, Roger G.; Laufersweiler, Matthew J.; Pikul,<br>
Staszek; Almstead, Neil G.; De, Biswanath; Janusz, Michael J.; Hsieh, Lily C.; Gu,<br>
Fei; Pokross, Matthew E.; Patel, Vikram S.; Garver, Susan M.; Peng, Sean X.;<br>
Branch, Todd M.; King, Selane L.; Baker, Timothy R.; Foltz, David J.; Mieling, Glen<br>
E. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry (2001), 44(7), 1060-1071) to give the final<br>
compounds Ic. Esters Ic can further be synthesized starting from aminoindoles 1 -<br>
optionally using one or more protecting groups - applying the following reaction<br>
sequence: i) protection of the amino group as described in step a; ii) protecting group<br>
manipulations and introduction of R13 as described in steps c, d and e; iii) reaction<br>
with building blocks 7 as described in step f (if R13 is equal to hydrogen steps i) and<br>
ii) can be left out); iv) alkylation at the indole IN-atom with carboxylic acid esters 3<br>
as described in step b. Esters of formula Ic can optionally be hydrolyzed according to<br>
standard procedures, e. g. by treatment with an alkali hydroxide like LiOH or NaOH<br>
in a polar solvent mixture like tetrahydrofuran/ethanol/water leading to carboxylic<br>
acids Ic. If alkyne compounds 7 (prepared as described in schemes 5 to 7) and/or<br>
aminoindoles 5 contain chiral centers, ester compounds Ic and carboxylic acids Ic can<br>
be obtained as mixtures of diastereomers or enantiomers, which can be separated by<br>
methods well known in the art, e. g. (chiral) HPLC or crystallization. Racemic<br>
compounds can e. g. be separated into their antipodes via diastereomeric salts by<br>
crystallization with optically pure amines such as e. g. (R) or (S)-l-phenyl-ethylamine,<br>
(R) or (S)-l-naphthalen-l-yl-ethylamine, brucine, quinine or quinidine or by<br>
separation of the antipodes by specific chromatographic methods using either a chiral<br>
adsorbens or a chiral eluent.<br>

The synthesis of compounds with the general structure I, particularly<br>
compounds according to formula le and If, with X equal to (CH2)PNR13CO, or<br>
(CH2)PCONR13 can be accomplished according to scheme 3.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Nitriles 1 and aldehydes 2 can be prepared from the corresponding cyano- or<br>
formyl-indoles (which are known, commercially available or can be prepared by<br>
methods known in the art) by reaction with esters having a leaving group in the alpha<br>
position (compounds 3 in schemes 1 and 2) in the presence of a base like potassium or<br>
cesium carbonate in solvents like acetone, methyl-ethyl ketone, acetonitrile or N,Ndimethylformamide<br>
in a temperature range between room temperature and 140 Â°C.<br>
Hydrogenation of nitrile compounds 1, e. g. using catalytic amounts of platinum<br>
dioxide in a mixture of ethanol and chloroform, leads to compounds 3 with p = 1 (step<br>
a). The preparation of compounds 3 with p = 0 has been described in scheme 2<br>
(compounds 5, scheme 2). Compounds 3 with p = 2 can be prepared from compounds<br>
2 in a two step procedure: i) treatment with nitro-methane and ammonium acetate at a<br>
temperature around 110 Â°C to form the corresponding nitro styrene compounds; ii)<br>
reduction to the aminoethyl-substituted indoles by methods known in the art (step b).<br>
In order to introduce substituents R13 * H, e. g. BOC-protection of compounds 3,<br>
followed by alkylation and subsequent removal of the BOC group can be performed<br>
similarly as described in scheme 2.<br>
Compounds 4 with p = 0 can be prepared by oxidizing aldehydes 2 under<br>
standard conditions to aromatic acids 4 (e. g. with sodium chlorite, sodium<br>
dihydrogen-phosphate in a mixture of tert-butanol and water and in the presence of 3-<br>
methyl-2-butene at temperatures around room temperature) (step c). Alternatively,<br>
acids 4 with p = 0 can be synthesized from lH-indole-7-carboxylic acid derivatives<br>
(which are known, commercially available or can be prepared by methods known in<br>
the art) by reacting them with esters having a leaving group in the alpha position<br>
(compounds 3 in schemes 1 and 2) - optionally using one or more protecting groups -<br>
in the presence of a base like potassium or cesium carbonate in solvents like acetone,<br>
methyl-ethyl ketone, acetonitrile or N,N-dimethylformamide in a temperature range<br>
between room temperature and 140 Â°C. Compounds 4 with p = 1 can be prepared from<br>
compounds 2 by a Wittig reaction using (methoxymethyl)-triphenylphosphonium<br>
chloride as reagent, transformation of the resulting enol ethers to the corresponding<br>
aldehydes and subsequent oxidation to the acids 4 (step c). Compounds 4 with p = 2<br>
can be prepared from compounds 2 e. g. by a Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction<br>
using dimethyl(benzyloxy-carbonyl)methyl phosphonate, followed by selective<br>
reduction of the double bond and cleavage of the ester function applying methods well<br>
known in the art (step c). Condensation of amines 3 or acids 4 with acids 5 or amines<br>
6 (prepared as outlined in schemes 5 to 7) can be performed applying standard<br>
literature procedures for amide formation, such as the use of N-(3-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethyl-carbodiimide-hydrochloride and 4-dimethylaminopyridine<br>
in dichloromethane at temperatures between 0 Â°C and room temperature<br>
yielding compounds le (step d) or If (step e). Alternatively, amines 3 or acids 4 can be<br>
condensed with alkynes 5 or 6 with R12 = H (prepared as outlined in schemes 5 to 7)<br>
to give alkynes le (R12 = H) (step d) or If (R12 = H) (step e). Intermediates le (R12 =<br>
H) or If (R12 = H) can further be processed via Sonogashira coupling as described in<br>
schemes 5 and 6 to the final compounds le or If [e.g. see description in schemes 5 and<br>
6 or Natchus, Michael G.; Bookland, Roger G.; Laufersweiler, Matthew J.; Pikul,<br>

Branch, Todd M.; King, Selane L.; Baker, Timothy R.; Foltz, David J.; Mieling, Glen<br>
E. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry (2001), 44(7), 1060-1071]. Esters le and If can<br>
alternatively be synthesized starting from cyano-lH-indoles instead of starting from<br>
nitriles 1 or starting from formyl-lH-indoles instead of starting from aldehydes 2<br>
applying the synthetic routes described in scheme 3, optionally using protecting<br>
groups (compare e. g. US 4378368; cyano- and formyl-indoles are known,<br>
commercially available or can be prepared by methods known in the art). Using this<br>
synthetic strategy, the reaction with esters having a leaving group in the alpha position<br>
(compounds 3 in schemes 1 and 2) in the presence of a base like potassium or cesium<br>
carbonate in solvents like acetone, methyl-ethyl ketone, acetonitrile or N,Ndimethylformamide<br>
in a temperature range between room temperature and 140 Â°C is<br>
carried out after the amide bond formation steps d or e, to obtain the final compounds<br>
le or If, respectively. Esters of formula le or If can optionally be hydrolyzed<br>
according to standard procedures, e. g. by treatment with an alkali hydroxide like<br>
LiOH or NaOH in a polar solvent mixture like tetrahydrofuran/ethanol/water, giving<br>
carboxylic acids le or If. If the alkyne compounds 5 and 6 (prepared as described in<br>
schemes 5 to 7) and/or the indoles 3 and 4 contain chiral centers, ester compounds le<br>
and If and carboxylic acids le and If can be obtained as mixtures of diastereomers or<br>
enantiomers, which can be separated by methods well known in the art, e. g. (chiral)<br>
HPLC or crystallization.<br>
An analogous reaction scheme with the same reaction sequences applies for the<br>
isomeric compound series leading to compounds of general formula I, particularly<br>
compounds according to formula Ig and Ih:<br>

6-Hydroxyindoles 1 (scheme 1) and O-protected 6-hydroxyindoles 2 (scheme 1)<br>
as well as their regioisomeric 4-, 5- and 7-hydroxyindole analogues are known or can<br>
be synthesized by methods known in the art. Examples for possible syntheses of these<br>
key intermediates (compounds 6 and 7 in scheme 4) are given in scheme 4 for R8 in I<br>
being equal to hydroxy or protected hydroxy. Analogous key intermediates where R6,<br>
R7 or R9 is equal to hydroxy or hydroxy carrying a protecting group can be<br>
synthesized applying the same reaction sequence.<br>
Scheme 4<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Introduction of a protecting group at the nitrogen atom of indoles 1 can be<br>
performed under standard conditions, e. g. by deprotonation with a base like nbutyllithium,<br>
preferably at -78 Â°C, and subsequent addition of e. g. tertbutyldimethylsilyl<br>
chloride at temperatures between -78 Â°C and ambient temperature<br>
in solvents like tetrahydrofuran (step a). Halogenation of protected indoles 2, e. g.<br>
through reaction with N-halosuccinimides at temperatures between -78 Â°C and<br>
ambient temperature in solvents like tetrahydrofuran delivers 3-halo indoles 3 (step b).<br>
Compounds 3 can - following halogen metal exchange, preferably with tertbutyllithium<br>
at -78 Â°C in solvents like tetrahydrofuran - be reacted with alkylating<br>
reagents 4 with Y e. g. being a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom, preferably with alkyl<br>
iodides, at temperatures between -78 Â°C and ambient temperature in solvents like<br>
tetrahydrofuran, to form indoles 5 bearing a substituent in position 3 (step c). NDeprotection<br>
or simultaneous N- and O-deprotection of compounds 5 leading to<br>
building blocks 6 can be performed by methods described in the literature, e. g. by<br>
treatment with tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride at temperatures between -15 Â°C and<br>
ambient temperature in a solvent like tetrahydrofuran, provided that the protecting<br>
groups are silyl ethers and/or silylated indoles (step d).<br>
Building blocks 7 carrying a chlorine, bromine or iodine substituent in position<br>
3 can be synthesized by halogenation of indoles 1, optionally carrying a protecting<br>
group at the hydroxy function, e. g. by reaction with N-chlorosuccinimide at<br>
temperatures between -15 Â°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent in solvents like<br>
dichloromethane or chloroform (step e). Alternatively, the same halo-indoles 7 can be<br>
obtained via N-deprotection or N- and O-deprotection of indoles 3 as described in step<br>
d (step f).<br>
Using appropriate protecting groups, the synthesis of hydroxyindole derivatives<br>
6 and 7 described in scheme 4 can be transferred to the synthesis of the corresponding<br>
4-, 5-, 6- or 7-thioindole or 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7- aminoindole analogues, respectively.<br>
Schemes 5 to 7 describe the synthesis of alkyne building blocks 6 (scheme 1),<br>
identical to compounds 7 (scheme 2), and acid- 5 and amine-building blocks 6<br>
(scheme 3).<br>
Scheme 5<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Hydroxy alkynes 1 (R14 = OH) or amino alkynes 1 (R14 = NHR13 or N-protected<br>
NR13) or alkyne esters 1 (R14 = COOalkyl) are known or can be prepared by methods<br>
known in the art. Alkynes 1 undergo palladium- and copper mediated coupling<br>
reactions with halo aryls or halo heteroaryls to give alkynes 2 (step a) wherein R12 is<br>
aryl or heteroaryl. These Sonogashira couplings are preferably performed using<br>
catalytic amounts of Pd(PPh3VCuI at 45 Â°C to 80 Â°C in piperidine, in analogy to a<br>
literature procedure [Stara, Irena G.; Stary, Ivo; Kollarovic, Adrian; Teply, Filip;<br>

in acetonitrile or THF [Thorand, Stephan; Krause, Norbert Journal of Organic<br>
Chemistry (1998), 63(23), 8551-8553] (step a). Finally, alcohols 2 (R14 = OH) of<br>
scheme 5 can be converted into compounds of formula 3 (R14 = OMesylate, O/?-<br>
Tosylate, Halide or Triflate), e. g. by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride or ptoluenesulfonyl<br>
chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of a base like<br>
triethylamine preferably in a temperature range between -20 Â°C and room temperature<br>
or by treatment with thionyl chloride in dichloromethane at 0 Â°C to room temperature<br>
or by reaction with carbon tetrachloride or carbon tetrabromide and<br>
triphenylphosphine in solvents like tetrahydrofuran, preferably in a temperature range<br>
between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents or by treatment<br>
with triflic anhydride, 2,6-lutidine and 4-dimethylaminopyridine in dichloromethane<br>
between -30 Â°C and room temperature; thus yielding compounds of formula 3 as<br>
methane-sulfonates, p-toluene sulfonates, chlorides, bromides or triflates, respectively<br>
(step b). Deprotection of esters 2 (R14 = COOalkyl) or amines 2 (R14 = N-protected<br>
NR13) yields acids 3 (R14 = COOH) or amines 3 (R14 = NHR13) and can be<br>
accomplished using procedures well known in the art (step b). All reactions described<br>
in scheme 5 are compatible with terminal alkynes, therefore in scheme 5 R12 can also<br>
be a hydrogen atom.<br>
Scheme 6<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Alpha mono- or di-substituted esters 2 (R10 and/or R'1 * H) can be synthesized<br>
via treatment of esters 1 (R16 * H) with a base like LDA or HMDS in solvents like<br>
tetrahydrofuran or 1,2-dimethoxyethane, followed by addition of one or sequentially<br>
two different alkyl halides and one alkyne halide (o &gt; 0) - optionally carrying a<br>
protecting group - at temperatures between -78 Â°C and room temperature, optionally<br>
using DMPU or HMPA as cosolvents (step a). To synthesize alkynes 2 with o being 0,<br>
3-butynoic acid derivatives - optionally carrying a protecting group - can be alkylated<br>
at the alpha carbon atom with R10- and/or R1'-alkyl halides by methods known in the<br>
art. Deprotection if necessary, applying methods known to a person skilled in the art,<br>
and Sonogashira coupling as described in step a of scheme 5 provides alkynes 3 (step<br>
b). Alternatively, compounds 3 can be synthesized by reacting enolates of compounds<br>
1 with compounds 3 of scheme 5 with R14 being a leaving group, e. g. a halide.<br>
Hydrolysis of esters 3 gives access to acids 3 (R16 = H; acid building block 5 used in<br>
scheme 3). Compounds 3 can be chiral and can optionally be separated into optically<br>
pure antipodes by methods well known in the art, e. g. by chromatography on a chiral<br>
HPLC column, or if R16 is equal to hydrogen by derivatization with an optically pure<br>
alcohol to form esters, which can be separated by conventional HPLC chromatography<br>
and then converted back to the enantiomerically pure acid. In addition, compounds 1<br>
can be converted into chiral amides which can be used for asymmetric alkylation<br>
reactions being well known to a person skilled in the art. Esters 3 can be reduced with<br>
lithiumaluminium hydride at temperatures ranging from -78 Â°C to 0 Â°C, preferable at -<br>
20 Â°C in solvents like THF to give alcohols 4 (R10&gt; = R11' = H) (step c). Esters 3 (R16 *<br>
H) can further be converted into tertiary alcohols 4 with R10 = R1' through reaction<br>
with alkyl organometallic reagents, preferably using alkyl Grignard compounds in a<br>
solvent like tetrahydrofuran or ether, preferably between -15 Â°C and the reflux<br>
temperature of the solvent (step c); R10 and R11 represent substituents as defined<br>
herein before for R10 and R11. Alcohols 4 with R10 not equal to R11 can be prepared<br>
by a sequential procedure: i) saponification of esters 3 to the corresponding acids; ii)<br>
treatment with R10 Li, optionally in the presence of a Cu(I) salt, in ether or<br>
tetrahydrofuran to yield alkyl ketones -COR10; iii) subsequent reaction with R11 Li or<br>
lithium aluminium hydride in ether or tetrahydrofuran (step c). In addition, esters 3<br>
can be converted to secondary alcohols 4 (R10 * H; R11 = H) by a two step procedure:<br>
i) reduction to the corresponding aldehydes by methods known in the art, e. g. by<br>
treatment with diisobutylaluminium hydride at temperatures preferably around -70 Â°C;<br>
ii) conversion of the aldehydes to the corresponding secondary alcohols 4 through<br>
reaction with alkyl organometallic compounds, preferably under the conditions given<br>
for the transformation of esters 3 to tertiary alcohols 4 described above (step c); this<br>
step can optionally be carried out in enantioselective or diastereoselective fashion<br>
using methods well known to a person skilled in the art. Alternatively, alkynes 2 can<br>
first be reduced with lithiumaluminium hydride to form alcohols 5 (step d), which<br>
undergo Sonogashira coupling reactions as discribed in step a of scheme 5 to yield<br>
building blocks 4 (step e). Alcohols 4 and 5 can be converted to the activated building<br>
blocks of formula 6 (R16 = OMesylate, Op-Tosylate, Halide or Triflate), e. g. by<br>
treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride or p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in<br>
dichloromethane in the presence of a base like triethylamine or pyridine, preferably in<br>
a temperature range between -20 Â°C and room temperature possibly followed by<br>
Finkelstein reaction with sodium iodide in 2-butanone at reflux temperature or by<br>
treatment with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride/2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine in CHaCb<br>
at 0 Â°C to give compounds 6 as methane-sulfonates, p-toluene-sulfonates, iodides or<br>
inflates, respectively (step f). Compounds of formula 6 can further be converted to<br>
amines 7 in solvents like DMA, DMF or dichloromethane via treatment with amines<br>
R13NH2 optionally using a protecting group and an additional base e. g. sodium<br>
hydride if BOC-protected amines are used (step g). All reactions described in scheme<br>
6 are compatible with terminal alkynes, therefore in scheme 6 R12 can also be a<br>
hydrogen atom.<br>
Scheme 7<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Alcohols 1 (alcohols 2 in scheme 5 and alcohols 4 in scheme 6) comprising a<br>
chain length m, n and o can be converted into analogues with a chain length ofm+l or<br>
n+1 carbon atoms by methods well known in the art, e. g. by conversion of the<br>
primary hydroxy group of 1 into a suitable leaving group, e. g. a halide 2 (step a),<br>
followed by reaction with cyanide to form nitriles 3 (step b) and saponification to<br>
yield acids 4 (step c). Acids 4 can be further transformed into primary alcohols 5 (R10<br>
= R11 = H), e. g. via esterification and subsequent lithiumaluminium hydride<br>
reduction (step d). Optionally, alcohols 5 can be elongated to a chain length of n+1<br>
carbon atoms by repeating the reaction sequence described for the synthesis of<br>
alcohols 5 from alcohols 1. Alcohol compounds 5 containing one or more chiral<br>
centers can optionally be separated into optically pure enantiomers or diastereomers<br>
by methods well known in the art, e. g. via HPLC chromatography, chromatography<br>
on a chiral HPLC column, or by derivatization with an optically pure acid to form<br>
esters, which can be separated by conventional HPLC chromatography. Alpha monoor<br>
di-substituted acids 6 (R10 and/or R11 * H) can be synthesized via transforming<br>
acids 4 into the corresponding esters, treating them with a base like LDA or HMDS in<br>
solvents like tetrahydrofuran or 1,2-dimethoxyethane, followed by addition of one or<br>
sequentially two different alkyl halides, a reaction preferably performed between<br>
-78 Â°C and room temperature followed by ester hydrolysis to obtain acids 6 (step e).<br>
The corresponding esters of acids 6 can serve as starting materials for the introduction<br>
of additional substituents R10 and R11 as described in step c of scheme 6.<br>
Compounds 6 can contain one or more stereocenters and can optionally be<br>
separated into optically pure enantiomers or diastereomers by methods well known in<br>
the art, e. g. by (chiral) HPLC chromatography, or by derivatization with an optically<br>
pure alcohol to form esters, which can be separated by conventional HPLC<br>
chromatography and then converted back to the enantiomerically pure acids 6. In<br>
addition, compounds 4 can be converted into chiral amides which can be used for<br>
asymmetric alkylation reactions being well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
Esterification of acids 6 and subsequent lithiumaluminium hydride reduction gives<br>
alcohols 5 (step f). Alcohols 5 can be converted to activated building blocks of<br>
formula 7 (R16 = OMesylate, Op-Tosylate, Halide or Triflate), e. g. by treatment with<br>
methanesulfonyl chloride or p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the<br>
presence of a base like triethylamine or pyridine preferably in a temperature range<br>
between -20 Â°C and room temperature, optionally followed by Finkelstein reaction<br>
with sodium iodide in 2-butanone at reflux temperature or by treatment with<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride/2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine in C^Ch at 0 Â°C to give<br>
compounds 7 as methane-sulfonates, p-toluene-sulfonates, iodides or triflates,<br>
respectively (step g). Compounds of formula 7 can further be converted to amines 8 in<br>
solvents like DMA, DMF or dichloromethane via treatment with amines R13NH2<br>
optionally using a protecting group strategy (step h). Amines 8 can also be synthesized<br>
from acids 4 or 6 via formation of the corresponding amide which is subsequently<br>
reduced using methods well known to a person skilled in the art (step i). All reactions<br>
described in scheme 7 are compatible with terminal alkynes (R12 = H) except for step<br>
e where terminal alkynes need to be protected applying methods well known in the art,<br>
e. g. the use of a trimethylsilyl protection group.<br>
The following tests were carried out in order to determine the activity of the<br>
compounds of formula (I).<br>

Full-length cDNA clones for humans PPAR6 and PPARcc and mouse PPARy<br>
were obtained by RT-PCR from human adipose and mouse liver cRNA, respectively,<br>
cloned into plasmid vectors and verified by DNA sequencing. Bacterial and<br>
mammalian expression vectors were constructed to produce glutathione-s-transferase<br>
(GST) and Gal4 DNA binding domain proteins fused to the ligand binding domains<br>
(LBD) of PPAR8 (aa 139 to 442), PPARy (aa 174 to 476) and PPARcc (aa 167 to<br>
469). To accomplish this, the portions of the cloned sequences encoding the LBDs<br>
were amplified from the full-length clones by PCR and then subcloned into the<br>
plasmid vectors. Final clones were verified by DNA sequence analysis.<br>
Induction, expression, and purification of GST-LBD fusion proteins were<br>
performed in E. coli strain BL21(pLysS) cells by standard methods (Ref: Current<br>

Radioligand Binding Assay<br>
PPAR8 receptor binding was assayed in HNM10 (50mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM<br>
NaCl, 5mM MgCl2, 0.15 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA and 15 mM DTT). For each 96<br>

radioligand, e.g. 20000 dpm {2-methyl-4-[4-methyl-2-(4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-<br>
thiazol-5-yl-ditritiomethylsulfanyl]-phenoxy}-acetic acid, was bound to 10 ug SPA<br>
beads (PharmaciaAmersham) in a final volume of 50 ju.1 by shaking. The resulting<br>
slurry was incubated for Ih at RT and centrifuged for 2 min at 1300g. The supernatant<br>

receptor-coated beads was resuspended in 50 ul of HNM. Radioligand was added and<br>
the reaction incubated at RT for Ih and scintillation proximity counting performed in<br>
the presence of test compounds was determined. All binding assays were performed in<br>
96 well plates and the amount of bound ligand was measured on a Packard TopCount<br>
using OptiPlates (Packard). Dose response curves were done in triplicates within a<br>
range of concentration from 10"'Â° M to 10"4 M.<br>
PPARa receptor binding was assayed in TKE50 (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50<br>
mM KC1, 2mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA and 10 mM DTT). For each 96<br>

were added, the reaction incubated at RT for Ih and scintillation proximity counting<br>
performed. All binding assays were performed in 96 well plates and the amount of<br>
bound ligand measured on a Packard TopCount using OptiPlates (Packard).<br>
Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10"4 M unlabelled compound.<br>
Dose response curves were done in triplicates within a range of concentration from 10"<br>

PPARy receptor binding was assayed in TKE50 (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM<br>
KC1, 2mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA and 10 mM DTT). For each 96 well<br>

Luciferase Transcriptional Reporter Gene Assays<br>
Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21 ATCC CCL10) were grown in DMEM<br>
medium containing 10% FBS at 37 Â°C in a 95%O2:5%CO2 atmosphere. Cells were<br>
seeded in 6 well plates at a density of 10s Cells/well and then batch-transfected with<br>
either the pFA-PPAR5-LBD, pFA-PPARy-LBD or pFA-PPARa-LBD expression<br>
plasm ids plus a reporter plasmid. Transfection was accomplished with the Fugene 6<br>
reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the suggested protocol. Six<br>
hours following transfection, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and seeded in<br>
96 well plates at a density of 104 cells/well. After 24 hours to allow attachment of<br>
cells, the medium was removed and replaced with 100 ul of phenol red-free medium<br>
containing the test substances or control ligands (final DMSO concentration: 0.1%).<br>
Following incubation of the cells for 24 hours with substances, 50 uJ of the<br>
supernatant was discarded and then 50 ^1 of Luciferase Constant-Light Reagent<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and<br>
esters can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for<br>
enteral, parenteral or topical administration. They can be administered, for example,<br>
perorally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, drage"es, hard and soft gelatine<br>
capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of<br>
suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or infusion solutions,<br>
or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner<br>
which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described<br>
compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable, into a galenical<br>
administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically<br>
compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical<br>
adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also<br>
organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives<br>
thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated<br>
tablets, drag6es and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine<br>
capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid<br>
polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers are, however,<br>
required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the<br>
production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert<br>
sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example,<br>
water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for<br>
suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or<br>
liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semisynthetic<br>
and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins,<br>
liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistencyimproving<br>
agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure,<br>
buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come<br>
into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula (I) can vary within wide limits<br>
depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the<br>
patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual<br>
requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 mg to<br>
about 1000 mg, especially about 1 mg to about 100 mg, comes into consideration.<br>
Depending on the dosage it is convenient to administer the daily dosage in several<br>
dosage units.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 0.1-500 mg,<br>
preferably 0.5-100 mg, of a compound of formula (I).<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the present invention in more detail.<br>
