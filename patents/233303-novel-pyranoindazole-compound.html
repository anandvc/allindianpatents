				<td>This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/295,429 filed June 1,2001, and is incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <br>
The present invention relates to various pyranoindazoles. These novel compounds* are useful for lowering and controlling normal or elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and for treating glaucoma.<br>
The disease state referred to as glaucoma is characterized by a permanent, loss of visual function due to irreversible damage to the optic nerve. The several morphologically or functionally distinct types of glaucoma are typically characterized by elevated IOP, which is considered to be causally related to the pathological course of the disease.    Ocular hypertension is a condition wherein intraocular pressure is elevated but no apparent loss of visual function has occurred; such patients are considered to be at high risk for the eventual development of the visual  loss associated with glaucoma.     If glaucoma or.-ocular hypertension is detected early and treated promptly with medications that effectively reduce elevated intraocular pressure, loss of visual function or its progressive deterioration can generally be ameliorated. Drug therapies that have proven to be effective for the reduction of intraocular pressure include both agents that decrease aqueous humor production and agents that increase the outflow facility. Such therapies are in general administered by one of two possible routes, topically (direct application to the eye) or orally.<br>
There are some individuals who do not respond well when treated with certain existing glaucoma therapies. There is, therefore, a need for other topical therapeutic agents that control IOP.<br>
Serotonergic 5-HTIA agonists have been reported as being neuroprotective in animal models and many of these agents have been evaluated for the treatment of acute stroke among other indications. This class of compounds has been mentioned for the treatment of glaucoma (lowering and controlling IOP), see e.g., WO 98/18458 (DeSantis, et al.) and EP 0771563A2 (Mano, et al.). Osborne, et al. (Ophthalmologica, Vol. 210:308-314, 1996) teach that 8-hydroxydipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (a 5-HTIA agonist) reduces IOP in rabbits. Wang, et al. (Current Eye Research, Vol. 16(8):769-775, August 1997, and IVOS, Vol. 39(4), S488, March, 1998) indicate that 5-methylurapidiI, an ctu antagonist and 5-HTIA agonist lowers IOP in the monkey, but due to its aiA receptor activity. Also, 5-HTIA • antagonists are disclosed as being useful for the treatment of glaucoma (elevated IOP) (e.g., WO 92/0338, McLees). Furthermore, DeSai, et al. (WO 97/35579) and Macor, et al. (U.S. 5,578,612) relate to the use of 5-HTi and 5-HTi-iike agonists for the treatment of glaucoma (elevated IOP). These anti-migraine compounds, e.g., sumatriptan and naratriptan and related compounds, are 5-HTIBJW agonists.<br>
It has been found that serotonergic compounds which possess agonist activity at 5-HT2 receptors effectively lower and control normal and elevated IOP .and are useful for treating glaucoma, see commonly owned co-pending application, PCT/US99/19888, incorporated in its entirety by reference herein. Compounds that act as agonists at 5-HT2 receptors are well known and have shown a variety of utilities, primarily for disorders or conditions associated with the central nervous system (CNS). U.S. Patent No. 5,494,928 relates to certain 2-(indol-l-yl)-ethylamine derivatives that are 5-HT2C agonists for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder and other CNS derived personality disorders. U.S. Patent No. 5,571,833 relates to tryptamine derivatives that are 5-HT2 agonists for the. treatment of portal hypertension and migraine. U.S. Patent No. 5,874,477 relates to a method for treating malaria using 5-HT2A/2C agonists. U.S. Patent No. 5,902,815 relates to<br>
the use of 5-HT2A agonists to prevent adverse effects of NMD A receptor hypo-function. WO 98/31354 relates to 5-HT2B agonists for the treatment of depression and .other CNS conditions. WO 00/12475 relates to indoline derivatives and WO 00/12510 and WO-00/44753 relate to certain indole derivatives as 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptor agonists for the treatment of a variety of disorders of the central nervous system, but especially for the treatment of obesity. WO 00/35922 relates to certain pyrazino[l,2-a]quinoxaline derivates as 5-HT2C agonists for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, eating disorders, and other disorders involving the CftS. WO 00/77002 and WO 00/77010 relate to certain substituted tetracyclic pyrido[4,3-6]indoles as 5-HT2C agonists with utility for the treatment of central nervous system disorders including obesity, anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, cephalic pain, and social phobias among others. Agonist response at the 5-HT2A receptor is reported to be the primary activity responsible for hallucinogenic activity, with some lesser involvement of the 5-HT2C receptor possible [Psychopharmacology, Vol. 121:357,1995].<br>
Few foran or pyran containing fused indazoles have been reported. The chemical synthesis of 7-methyl- and l,7-dimethyl-lH-furo[2,3-g]indazole [Gazz. Chim Ital. 106, 1083   (1976)]   as  well   as  that  of 3-methyl-  and   l-(4-aminophenyl)-3-methyl-lH-benzo[b]furo[2,3-g-]indazole [An. Asoc. Quint. Argent. 59, 69 (1971)] has been reported without discussion of their utility.    European Patent Application EP 990,650 (Intnl. Publication Number WO 98/56768) relates to substituted 2-(furo[2,3~g]indazol-1-yl)-ethylamines,   such   as   (S)-2-(furo[2,3-g]indazol-l-yl)-l-methylethylatnine,. which  are reported to have high selectivity and affinity for 5-HT2C receptors and are potentially useful for treating a variety of central nervous system disorders. The chemical synthesis of 9-methy'l-lH-   pyrano[2,3-g]indazol-7-one   and   the   corresponding   non-methylated compound was reported [Indian J. Chem. 26B, 436 (1987)] with no mention of utility.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,561,150 and 5,646,173 relate to certain tricyclic pyrazole derivative compounds which are identified as being 5-HT2C agonists for the treatment of CNS diseases and are primarily directed to lipophilic analogs that have a high,probability of. entering the brain. Similarly, WO 98/56768 relates to tricyclic 5-HBc agonists for the treatment of CNS diseases. All the patents and publications mentioned above and throughout are incorporated in their entirety by reference herein.<br>
5-Hyroxytryptamine (serotonin) does not cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain. However, in order to increase brain serotonin levels the administration of 5-hydroxy-tryptophan can be employed. The transport of 5-hydroxy-tryptophan into the brain readily occurs, and once in the brain 5-hydroxy-tryptophan is rapidly decarboxylated to provide serotonin.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need to provide  new  compounds which avoid the disadvantages described above and which provide increased chemical stability and a desired length of therapeutic activity, for instance, in decreasing intraocular pressure and treating glaucoma.

Certain compounds of Formula I can contain one or more chiral.centers. The present invention contemplates all enantiofners, diastereomers, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In the above definitions, the total number of carbon atoms in a substituent group is indicated by the Ci-j prefix where the numbers i and j define the number of carbon atoms. This definition includes straight chain, branched chain, and cyclic alkyl or (cyclic alyky). alkyl groups. A substituent may be present either singly or multiply when incorporated into the indicated structural unit. For example, the substituent halogen, which means fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, would indicate that the unit to which it is attached may be substituted with one or more halogen atoms, which may be the same or different.<br>
SYNTHESIS<br>
The compounds of Formula I can be prepared by using one of several synthetic<br>
procedures. For example, l-(2-aminopropyl)-l&gt;7,859-tetrahydro-pyrano[2,3-g]tndazol-8-ols can be prepared from an appropriately protected l-(6-hydroxyindazol-l-yl)-propan-2-ol 1 as outlined in Scheme 1. Pg denotes a suitable protective group to assure that a particular atom is not modified during the indicated chemical reaction.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
(Scheme Removed)  <br>
Other compounds of Formula I can be prepared from 12 through selected functional group transformations well known in the art. For example, initial protection of the primary amine group followed by activation of the hydroxyl group by formation of a sulfonate ester, e.g. methanesulfonyl, and subsequent reactiori with a desired nucleophile such as alkylamines, dialkylamines, aryl or alkylthiols, and the like, will provide compounds 14 of Formula I. Furthermore, direct oxidation of 13 with a suitable oxidizing agent, for example, a hypervalent iodine reagent, such as o-iodoxybenzoic acid [J. Org Chem. 60, 7272 (1995)], provides the ketone 16, which can be functionalized to provide yet other<br>
compounds of Formula I, such as 17, via reductive alkylation, and 15, via Grignard addition.<br>
Scheme 2<br>
(Scheme Removed)  <br>
Alternately, compounds of Formula I can' be prepared from appropriately substituted 5-propargyloxy-indazoles (19) via initial Claisen rearrangement reactions [Tetrahedron Lett. 33,2179 (1992), ibid. 35,45 (1994), ibid'. 41, 3541 (2000)] to give the intermediate substituted pyrano[2,3-g]indazoles 20 (Scheme 3). Further synthetic manipulation of 20, for example, as outlined in Schemes 3-5, using,well-known functional group transformations provides yet other desirable compounds'of Formula I.   <br>
Scheme 3    (Scheme Removed)  4<br>
The l-(hydroxyalkyl)-indazoles of interest for the preparation of compounds of Formula I can be prepared as outlined in Scheme 6 and in co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 60/295,427, incorporated in its entirety by reference herein. Reaction of the activated fluorophenol 30 with the appropriate amino alcohol 31, which, when A is nitrile, is reduced to provide the corresponding aldehyde 32. Nitrosation to provide 33 followed by reductive cyclization provides the l-(hydroxyalkyl)-indazoles 34.<br><br>
Scheme 6   <br>
(Scheme Removed)  <br>
Intermediate pyranoindazoles 34 can also be prepared by alkylation. of the appropriate 0-protected 6-hydroxy-indazole (35), where suitable 0-protective groups are e.g. methyl or benzyl, by methods well known in the art and described in Scheme 7 [U.S. Patent 5,494,928 (1997), WO98/30548 (1998)], with the desired epoxide, e.g. propylene oxide. Alternately, it can be advantageous for the preparation of certain compounds to alkylate 35 using chloroacetone followed by reduction, e.g. with NaBH4, of the intermediate ketone to obtain the intermediate 34.<br>
Scheme 7<br>
(Scheme Removed)  <br>
It can be advantageous to prepare certain compounds of Formula I from a suitably<br>
substituted l,7,8,9-tetrahydro-pyrano[253-g]indazole, such as 36 as outlined in Scheme 8.<br>
For example, alkylation of 36 according to the conditions described for Scheme 4 above,<br>

METHOD 1<br>
5-H' 12 Receptor "Binding Assay To determine the affinities of serotonergic compounds at the 5-HT2 receptors, their<br>
ability to compete for the binding of the agonist radioligand [,25I]DOI to brain 5-HT2<br>
receptors is determined as described below with minor modification of the literature<br>
procedure [Neuropharmacology, 26, 1803 (1987)]. Aliquots of post mortem rat or human<br>
cerebral cortex homogenates (400 µL) dispersed in 50 mMTrisHCl buffer (pH 7.4) are<br>
incubated with [125I]DOI (80 pM final) in the absence or presence of methiothepin (10 µM<br>
final) to define total and non-specific binding, respectively, in a total volume of 0.5 mL.<br>
The assay mixture is incubated for 1 hour at 23°C in polypropylene tubes and the assays<br>
terminated by rapid vacuum filtration over Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters previously<br>
soaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine using ice-cold buffer. Test compounds (at different<br>
concentrations) are substituted for methiothepin. Filter-bound radioactivity is determined<br>
by scintillation spectrometry on a beta counter. The data are analyzed using a non-linear,<br>

METHOD 2 5-HT2 functional Assay: [Ca 2+]i Mobilization<br>
The receptor-mediated mobilization on intracellular calcium ([Ca +]i) was studied. using the Fluorescence Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) instrument. Rat vascular smooth muscle cells, A7r5, were grown in a normal media of DMEM / 10% FBS and 10 µg/mL gentamycin. Confluent cell monolayers were trypsinized, pelleted, and re-suspended in normal media. Cells were seeded in a 50 µL volume at a density of 20,000 cells / well in a black wall, 96-well tissue culture plate and grown for 2 days.<br>
On the day of the experiment, one vial of FLIPR Calcium Assay Kit dye was re-suspended in 50 mL of a FLIPR buffer consisting of Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS), 20 mM HEPES, and 2.5 mM probenecid, pH 7.4. Cells were loaded with the calcium-sensitive dye by addition of an equal volume (50 uL) to each well of the 96-well plate and incubated with dye for lh at 23°C.<br>
Typically, test compounds were stored at 25 µM in 50% DMSO/50% Ethanol solvent. Compounds were diluted 1:50 in 20% DMSO/20% Ethanol. For "hit" screening, compounds were further diluted 1:10 in FLIPR buffer and tested at a final concentration of 10 ╡M. For dose-response experiments,' compounds were diluted 1:50 in FLIPR buffer and serially diluted 1:10 to give a 5- or 8- point dose-response curve.<br>
The compound plate and cell plate were placed in the FLIPR instrument At the beginning of an experimental run, a signal test was performed to check the' basal fluorescence signal from the dye-loaded cells and the uniformity of.the signal across the plate. The basal fluorescence was adjusted between 8000-12000 counts by modifying the exposure time, the camera F-stop, or the laser power. Instrument settings for a typical assay were the following: laser power 0.3-0.6 W, camera F-stop F/2, and exposure time 0.4 sec. Analiquot (25 uL) of the test compound was added to the existing 100 µL dye-loaded<br>
cells at a dispensing speed of 50 µL/sec. Fluorescence data were collected in re'al-timeat 1.0 sec intervals for the first 60 sees and at 6.0 sec intervals for an additional 120 sees. Responses were measured as peak fluorescence intensity minus basal and where, appropriate were expressed as a percentage of a maximum 5-HT-induced response. When the compounds were tested as antagonists against 10 µM 5-HT, they were incubated with the cells for 15 minutes prior to the addition of 5-HT.<br>
The above procedures were used to generate the data shown in Table 1.<br>
