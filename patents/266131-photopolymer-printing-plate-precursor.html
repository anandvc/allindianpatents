Photopolymer printing plate precursor<br>
 FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a photopolymer printing plate precursor comprising a photosensitive coating on a support, wherein said photosensitive coating comprises a composition that is photopolymerizable upon absorption of light, said composition comprising a binder, a polymerizable compound, a sensitizer and a photo initiator.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of making a lithographic printing plate therewith.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In lithographic printing, a so-called printing master such as a printing plate is mounted on a cylinder of the printing press. The master carries a lithographic image on its surface and a printed copy is obtained by applying ink to said image and then transferring the ink from the master onto a receiver material, which is typically paper. In conventional, so-called ""wet" lithographic printing, ink as well as an aqueous fountain solution (also called dampening liquid) are supplied to the lithographic image which consists of oleophilic (or hydrophobic, i.e. ink-accepting, water-repelling) areas as well as hydrophilic (or oleophobic, i.e. water-accepting, ink-repelling) areas. In so-called "driographic" printing, the lithographic image consists of ink-accepting and ink-adhesive (ink-repelling) areas and during driographic printing, only ink is supplied to the master. The lithographic image usually is made by exposing an image to a photopolymerizable composition coated on a support and developing said image. Such photopolymerizable compositions are well known in the art and are not only used for printing plate precursors, but also e.g. as photoresists for printed electronic circuits.<br><br>
Said photosensitive compositions usually comprise a polymeric binder, an unsaturated polymerizable compound and a photoinitiator and often are of low sensitivity, so that exposure has to be done by continuous high intensity lamps for seconds up to minutes.<br>
As an example such photopolymerizable compositions of low sensitivity are known from DE 2 064 080 OS, wherein the binder polymer comprises specific methacrylic acid / long chain alkyl methacrylic acid ester copolymers, that preferably have an acid number from 100 to 250• Such compositions are disclosed to enhance adhesion to metal supports of any kind, in particular to copper surfaces, and hardened layers comprising such copolymers are described to have a good resistance against developers.<br>
The photosensitive resin composition according to EP 398 325 A comprises as a binder a mixture of a hydrophobic polymer and a hydrophilic polymer, wherein the hydrophilic polymer comprises hydrophilic groups like carboxy groups and the hydrophobic polymer preferably comprises chlorine substituents and has a glass transition temperature (Tg) not higher than 5 °C. Said compositions are disclosed to be useful for the production of flexographic printing plates with good ink resistance.<br>
According to US 4,780,393 and US 4,940,647 the photopolymerizable compositions disclosed therein comprising a polymeric binder, a polymerizable compound, a photoinitiator and a loco dye, have advantages e.g. in sensitivity and contrast. In Example 1 are demonstrated in every case dry resist films and exposure is done by means of an iron doped 5 kW halide lampe at short distance.<br>
A photopolymerizable composition comprising a specific photoinitiator system and optionally a polymeric binder is disclosed in GB 1 576 217 to have good light-sensitivity in combination with a high cross-linking density. According to the examples exposure has to be done with high-energy lamps, e.g. a 8 kW ""Hencoop" spot arc lamp, for a coated copper circuit plate.<br><br><br><br>
transfer mechanism; (ii) UV/VIS photopolymer plates which contain a photopolymerizable composition that hardens upon exposure to light and (iii) thermal (including IR photopolymer, Novolak and latex-based) plates of which the imaging mechanism is triggered by heat or by light-to-heat conversion. Thermal plates are mainly sensitized for infrared lasers emitting at 830 nm or 1064 nm. Typical photopolymer plates are sensitized for visible light, mainly for exposure by an Ar laser (488 nm) or a FD-YAG laser (532 nm) . The wide-scale availability of low cost blue or violet laser diodes, originally developed for data storage by means of DVD, has enabled the production of plate-setters operating at shorter wavelength. More specifically, semiconductor lasers emitting from 350 to 4 50 nm have been realized using an Incan material.<br>
From EP 1 403 043 are known IR sensitive layers comprising a polyacrylic acid ester or polyacrylic acid amide binder having at least one free carboxylic acid group in each repeating unit. The binder is disclosed to be a homopolymer or a copolymer and preferably has a Tg from 70 to 300 °C. Similar binders are also disclosed in EP 1 403 042, EP 1 403 041 and EP 1 176 467.<br>
From EP 1 349 006 are known photopolymerizable compositions with high sensitivity for UV, violet and blue light, that comprise specific sensitizers, and wherein the binder used in the examples is a methacrylate/methacrylic acid copolymer having a Tg of over 100<br>
In known photopolymer plates, in particular in plates of high sensitivity, it has been observed, that the process of polymerization during exposure often comes to an end, before all of the exposed areas have enough resistance to not be dissolved by an aqueous developer. It has been found, that this point, where little or no further polymerisation occurs, can be overcome by a so called pre-heat step. The preheat step usually is done directly after light exposure, in particular when using visible or UV lasers, and typically consists of heating the printing plate precursor for 10 seconds to 1 minute to temperatures in the range of 90 ""C to 150 °C<br><br>
to promote polymerization before the development step. This step is unfavourable as it requires special equipment and extra time for the manufacturing process. In addition the pre-heat step may cause artefacts in the printed image like so called asteroids that can be avoided by the present invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a photopolymer printing plate precursor that can be exposed by a low intensity laser, and that has sufficient resistance of the image wise hardened composition, even if no pre-heat step is done between exposure and development, and that can be processed by alkaline developers without loosing parts of the image.<br>
Surprisingly the object of the present invention can be achieved by a photopolymer printing plate precursor with a photopolymerizable composition comprising at least one binder, a polymerizable compound, a sensitizer and a photoinitiator, wherein said binder is a copolymer that has a Tg of less than 70 °C and wherein 1 to 50 mol-% of the monomeric units of said copolymer contain at least one acidic group. The printing plate precursor of the present invention is a flexographic or lithographic printing plate precursor, the latter being highly preferred*<br>
In particular the object of the present invention can be achieved by a method of making a lithographic printing plate comprising the steps of providing a photopolymer printing plate precursor as defined in any of the preceding claims, exposing said printing plate precursor with a laser and processing the printing plate precursor in an aqueous alkaline developer.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the printing plate precursor and of the method of making a lithographic printing plate therewith are defined in the dependent claims.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a photopolymer printing plate precursor comprising a photosensitive coating on a support, wherein said photosensitive coating comprises a composition that is photopolymerizable upon absorption of light, said composition comprising at least one binder, a polymerizable compound, a sensitizer and a photoinitiator, characterized in that said binder is a copolymer that has a Tg of less than 70 '"C and wherein 1 to 50 mol-% of the monomeric units of said copolymer contain at least one acidic group.<br>
The glass transition temperature (Tg) according to the present invention is determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).<br>
Although the photopolymer printing plate precursor of the present invention can also advantageously be used for high-intensity exposure and also when using a pre-heat step, the advantages of the present invention are particularly pronounced for laser exposure with medium to low energy and no pre-heat step, in particular when using UV or visible light*<br>
Not knowing the underlying mechanism, the low Tg binder results in a lower overall Tg for the photolayer, which might allow easier diffusion of the initiating species and the propagating monomers through the photopolymer sing matrix, which results in a greater degree of polymerisation without the need to use pre-heat to raise the temperature of the photolayer above the Tg. Possibly, because irradiation with a visible laser produces little heat, the advantage of a low Tg binder may be more pronounced for visible light-sensitive systems than for IR sensitive systems in which heat is produced during irradiation.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the photopolymerizable composition is sensitive to wavelengths between 300 and 1200 nm, in particular between 300 and 600 nm, and particularly preferred between 350 and 450 nm. It is preferred, that the photopolymerizable composition has a high sensitivity, in<br><br>
particular that the minimum exposure necessary for image formation, measured on the surface of the plate, is 100 pJ/cm’ or less.<br>
The binder of the present invention can be selected from a wide series of organic copolymers as presently claimed. The copolymer can be polymerized from two, three, four or more different mixed monomers and preferably contains two or three different monomers. In the context of the present invention different monomers means monomers of different chemical structure. The different monomers can be distributed in the binder copolymer of the present invention in any way, e.g. randomly or as blocks. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the different monomers are distributed randomly and/or comprise blocks with an average length of less than 20 monomeric units.<br>
The binder of the present invention can also be a composition of different copolymers, as long as the average Tg of the composition is less than 70 °C  and 1 to 50 mol-% of the monomeric units in said composition contain at least one acidic group.<br>
The Tg of the binder according to the present invention preferably is less than 60 °C, in particular less than 50 °C and particularly preferred less than 30 °C,   However, this value is dependent on the amount of binder used in the photolayer. For example, when a larger amount of binder is used, it becomes more important that the Tg is low, than when a lower amount of binder is used, due to the fact that a small amount of binder will have less influence on, the overall Tg of the photolayer than a large amount of binder. The amount of binder(s) generally ranges from 10 to 90 % by weight, preferably 20 to 80 % by weight, relative to the total weight of the non-volatile components of the composition.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention from 2 to 30 mol-% and particularly preferred from 5 to 25 mol-% of the monomeric units of said copolymer contain at least one acidic group.<br>

Particularly preferred as binders of the present invention are copolymers comprising carboxylic acid groups as acidic group, in<br>

Among those are, for example, copolymers containing units of maleic anhydride and styrene, unsaturated ethers or esters or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons and the esterification products obtained from such copolymers.<br>
Further suitable binders are products obtainable from the reaction of hydroxyl’containing polymers with intramolecular dicarboxylic anhydrides, such as maleic anhydride or (meth)acrylic anhydride* Further useful binders are polymers in which groups with acidic hydrogen atoms are present, which have been modified by reaction of -CO2H, -OH or -NH2 groups with, for example isocyanate, hydroxy, carboxy or epoxy group containing compounds• Also suitable are polymers with aliphatic or aromatic hydroxyl groups, for example copolymers containing units of hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates, allyl alcohol, hydroxysty-rene or vinyl alcohol, as well as epoxy resins, provided they carry a sufficient number of free OH groups.<br>
The organic polymers used as binders have a typical mean molecular weight M„ between 600 and 2000000, preferably between 1000 and 500000. Preference is further given to polymers having an acid<br><br>

The following specific example is a prefered polymerizable compound:<br><br><br>
In order to achieve a high sensitivity, it is advantageous to add a radical chain transfer agent as described in EP 107 792 to the photopolymerizable composition of the present invention.

Particularly suitable predispersed phthalocyanine<br><br>
pigments are disclosed in DE 199 15 717 and DE 199 33 139, Preference is given to metal’free phthalocyanine pigments.<br>
In order to adjust the photopolymerizable composition according to the present invention to specific needs, thermal inhibitors or stabilizers for preventing thermal polymerization may be added. Furthermore additional hydrogen donors, dyes, colored or colorless pigments, color formers, indicators and plasticisers may be present. These additives are conveniently selected so that they absorb as little as possible in the actinic range of the image wise applied radiation *<br>
The photopolymerizable composition according to the present invention is applied to the support by processes which are known per se to the person skilled in the art* In general, the components of the photopolymerizable composition are dissolved or dispersed in an organic solvent or solvent mixture, the solution or dispersion is applied to the intended support by pouring on, spraying on, immersion, roll application or in a similar and the solvents are removed during the subsequent drying.<br>
The known supports can be used for the photopolymer printing plate of the present invention, like e. g, foils, tapes or plates made of metal or plastics and in the case of screen’printing also of Peron gauze. Preferred metals are aluminium, aluminium alloys, steel and zinc, aluminium and aluminium alloys being particularly preferred. Preferred plastics are polyester and cellulose acetates, polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) being particularly preferred,<br>
In most cases it is preferred, to treat the surface of the support mechanically and/or chemically and/or electrochemically to optimally adjust the adherence between the support and the photosensitive coating and/or to reduce the reflection of the image wise exposed radiation on the surface of the support (antihalation),<br>
The most preferred support to be used for the present invention is made of aluminium or an aluminium alloy, its surface is electrochemically roughened, thereafter anodized and optionally<br><br>
treated with a hydrophilizing agent like e. g. poly(vinylphosphonic<br>
acid)•<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention a protect :v/-layer (protective overcoat) is arranged on top of the photosensitive\-coating. Preferably the protective layer has a dry coating weight r-r less than 3*0 g/m2, in particular less than 2.5 g/m’, and particularly preferred from more than 0.25 g/m’ to less than 2,5<br>
g/m2.<br>
The protective overcoat preferably comprises at least one type(' of poly(vinyl alcohol), in particular a poly{vinyl alcohol) wherein the mean degree of saponification is less than 93 mol-%.<br>
The degree of saponification is related to the production of poly(vinyl alcohols). As the monomer of poly(vinyl alcohol), vinyl alcohol, is nonexistent, only indirect methods are available for the-production of poly(vinyl alcohol). The most important manufacturing process for poly(vinyl alcohol) is the polymerization of vinyl esters or ethers, with subsequent saponification or transesterification. The preferred starting material for the poly (vinyl alcohol) of the present invention is a vinyl alcohol esterified by a mono carboxylic acid and in particular vinyl acetate, but derivatives of vinyl acetate, vinyl esters of di carboxylic acids, vinyl ethers and the like can also be used. The degree of saponification as defined for the present invention is t.l,’ molar degree of hydrolysis irrespective of the process used for the hydrolysis. Pure poly(vinyl alcohol) has e. g, a degree of saponification of 100 mol-%, but commercial products often have a degree of saponification of 98 mol-%. The poly(vinyl alcohols) as used for the present invention contain mainly 1,3-diol units, but may also contain small amounts of 1,2-diol units. In the partially saponified poly (vinyl alcohols) the ester or the ether group can ]■..■. distributed statistically or block wise. Preferred partially saponified poly(vinyl alcohols) of the present invention have a viscosity of a 4 % aqueous solution at 20°C of 4 to 60 mPa's, preferably of 4 to 20 mPa»s and in particular of 4 to 10 mPa»s.<br><br>
Poly(vinyl alcohols) preferred for the present invention are commercially available e. g. under the tradename Mowiol, Those products are characterised by two appended numbers, meaning the viscosity and the degree of saponification. For example, Mowiol S -88 or Mowiol 8/88 mean a poly(vinyl alcohol) having as 4 % aqueous solution at 20°C a viscosity of ca 8 mPa»s and a degree of saponification of 88 mol-%. Although the use of only one type of poly(vinyl alcohol) is sufficient to achieve an advantage, it is preferred to use a mixture of two or more compounds, because this allows a more accurate adjustment and a better optimization of further properties of the printing plate precursor. Preferably poly(vinyl alcohols) differing in viscosity as defined above and/or in saponification degree are combined. Particularly preferred are mixture of poly(vinyl alcohols) that differ in viscosity of their A % aqueous solutions at 20'*C for at least 2 mPa»s or that differ in saponification degree for at least 5 mol-%. Most preferred are mixtures comprising at least 3 types of poly(vinyl alcohols), wherein at least two compounds differ in viscosity as defined above for at least 2 mPa»s and at least two compounds differ in saponification degree for at least 5 mol’%.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the overall mean saponification degree of all poly(vinyl alcohols) used in the protective layer has to be less than 93 mol-%. In a particular preferred embodimend of the present invention said overall mean saponification degree ranges from 71 mol-% to less titan 93 mol-% and in particular from 80 mol-% to 92,9 mol-%.<br>
As long as said mean overall saponification limit of 93 mol-v. is not reached, one of the poly(vinyl alcohols) used in a mixture can have a mean saponification degree of more than 93 mol-% and ev'-i: up to 100 mol-%.<br>
The overall mean saponification degree of the poly(vinyl alcohols) used in the protective overcoat of a printing plate precursor can be determined experimentally via ‘‘C-NMR. To measure the ‘‘C-NMR spectra, approximately 200 mg of the protective overcoat<br><br>
are dissolved in 1.0 ml DMSO and from this solution a 75 MHz ‘‘C-NMR spectrum is taken, whose resonances can easily be interpreted and allow to calculate the degree of saponification. Such values are listed in the Examples, in Table 3, as experimental values. A good correlation is obtained between said experimental values and the values known from the product specification of the poly(vinyl alcohols), The latter values are hereinafter called theoretical values of the mean saponification degree and can easily be calculated, when mixture of poly(vinyl alcohols) are used.<br>
Preferably poly(vinyl alcohol)s are used for the present invention in 50 to 99,9 weight percent (wt.%) relative to the total weight of the non-volatile compounds of the protective overcoat.<br>
Apart from poly(vinyl alcohol)s other water soluble polymers can be added to the layer such as poly(vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(ethylene oxide), gelatin, gum arable, oxygen binding polymers with aliphatic amine groups known from EP 352 630 Bl, methyl vinylether/maleic anhydride copolymers, poly(carboxylic acids), copolymers of ethylene oxide and poly(vinyl alcohol), carbon hydrates, hydroxy ethyl cellulose, acidic cellulose, cellulose, poly(arylic acid)and mixtures of these polymers.<br>
Preferably the poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) is only used in small quantities compared to the poly(vinyl alcohol). In a preferred embodiment of the present invention poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) is used from 0 to 10 parts by weight of the poly(vinyl alcohol) used, from 0 to 3 parts by weight being particularly preferred. Most preferred no poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)compounds are used.<br>
In addition to the poly(vinyl alcohol) of the present invention and the optional water soluble polymers disclosed above, the known ingredients of protective layers can be used.<br>
Examples of known ingredients suitable for the protective layer of the present invention are surface wetting agents, coloring agents,   complexants, polyethylenimines and biocides.<br>
The protective layer has to be transparent for actinic light. Preferably it is homogeneous, substantially impermeable to oxygen.<br><br>
waterpermeable, and can be washed off preferably with the conventional developer solutions used to form a printing relief after imagewise exposure of the photosensitive layer. Said photosensitive layer is removed imagewise, whereas the protective layer is removable over the entire area of the element created. The wash-off of the protective layer can be done in a separate step, but can be done during the development step as well.<br>
The dry coating weight of the protective overcoat can be measured by the following procedure. A plate is exposed for 4 hours to daylight. Next the plate is pre-heated between 104""C and 127°C (temperature measured via a thermostrip (THERMAX commercially available from TMC) at the back of the plate). The plate is cut to a size of 100 mm X 100 mm and weighted on an analytical balance with 0,01 mg accuracy (=Weight A). Next the protective overcoat is washed off with water (25°C) for 2 minutes. Than the plate is rinsed with demineralised water and dried in an oven at 100°C. After drying the plate is allowed to cool down to room temperature, and the weight is determined using the same analytical balance as described earlier (=Weight B), The dry coating weight in g/m’ of the protective overcoat is calculated using the formula below ;<br>
Dry coating weight (g/m’)= 100 X (Weight A - Weight B)<br>
The protective layer can be coated on the photosensitive layer with known techniques and the coating solution preferably contains water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent. To allow a better wetting, the coating solution preferably contains, related to the solid content, up to 10 wt.%, and particular preferred up to 5 wt,% of a surface active agent. Suitable representatives of surface active agents comprise anionic, cationic and nonionic surface active agents like sodium alkylsulfates and -sulfonates having 12 to 18 carbon atoms, an example of which is sodium dodecylsulfate, N-cetyl-and C-cetyl betaine, alkylaminocarboxylate and -dicarboxylate, and polyethylene glycols with a mean molar weight up to 400.<br><br>
In addition, further functions can be added to the protective layer. For example, it can be possible to improve the safelight suitability without decreasing the sensitivity of the layer by adding a coloring agent, e, g, a water-soluble dye, that has excellent transmission to the light having a wavelength of 300 to 450 nm and that absorbs the light having a wavelength of 500 nm or more. This principle can easily be varied for different wavelengths to adjust the effective spectral sensitivity distribution of the printing plate precursor as needed,<br>
The present invention also relates to a method of making a lithographic printing plate comprising the steps of providing a photopolymer printing plate precursor as defined above, exposing said printing plate precursor, and processing the printing plate precursor in an aqueous alkaline developer.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method of the present invention the exposure is done with a laser having an emission wavelength in the range from 300 to 1200 nm, in particular in the range from 300 to 600 nm, and particularly preferred in the range from 350 to 450 nm, and the exposure preferably is carried out at an energy density, measured on the surface of the plate, of 100 pj/cm’ or less.<br>
The processing of the printing plate precursor of the present invention is done in the usual manner. After image-wise exposure a pre-heat step can be performed to improve the crosslinking of the photosensitive layer, but preferably no pre-heat step is carried out. Then usually follows the development step, wherein the optional overcoat layer and the unexposed part of the photosensitive layer are removed. The removal (wash-off) of the overcoat layer and the development of the photosensitive layer can be done in two separate steps in this order, but can also be done in one step simultaneously* Preferably the overcoat layer is washed-off with water before the development step. The wash-off can be done with cold water, but it is preferred to use hot water to accelerate the process. What remains on the support after the development step are<br><br>
the exposed and thereby photopolymerized parts of the photosensitive layer. The developer solution used for the development of the exposed printing plate precursors of the present invention preferably is an aqueous alkaline solution having a pH of at least 11; a pH from 11,5 to 13.5 being particularly preferred. The developer solution can contain a small percentage, preferably less than 5 wt.%, of an organic, water-miscible solvent. To adjust the pH of the solution, an alkali hydroxide is preferably used.<br>
Examples of preferred, additional ingredients of the developer solution comprise alone or in combination alkali phosphates, alkali carbonates, alkali bicarbonates, an organic amine compound, alkali silicates, buffering agents, complexants, defoamers, surface active agents and dyes, but the suitable ingredients are not limited to the preferred examples and further ingredients can be used.<br>
The method of development employed is not particularly limited, and may be conducted by soaking and shaking the plate in a developer, physically removing non-image portions while being dissolved in a developer by means of e. g. a brush, or spraying a developer onto the plate so as to remove non-image portions. The time for development is selected depending upon the above method used so that the non-image portions can adequately by removed, and is optionally selected within a range of 5 seconds to 10 minutes.<br>
After the development, the plate my be subjected to a hydrophilic treatment by means of, e. g., gum arable optionally applied to the printing plate as the case requires (gumming step).<br><br>
Examples<br>
A. Violet sensitive printing plate precursor<br>
A composition was prepared (pw = parts per weight; wt-% = weight percentage) by mixing the components as specified in table 1. A composition such as this was divided equally into portions of 24,61 g, and to each portion was added 1.608 g of a 33,0 wt.% solution in 2-butanone of the binder according to table 2, The resulting composition was coated on an electrochemically roughened and anodically oxidized aluminum sheet, the surface of which had been rendered hydrophilic by treatment with an aqueous solution of polyvinyl phosphonic acid (oxide weight 3 g/m’) and was dried for 1 minute at 120 °C   (circulation oven) .   The resulting thickness of the layer was 1.5 g/m’*<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The so-formed protective overcoat had a dry thickness of 2.0 g/m’,<br>
The imaging was carried out with a Polaris violet platesetter device (flat bed system) equipped with a violet laser diode emitting between 392 and 417 nm. The following imaging conditions were used:<br>
Scanning speed : 600 or 1000 m/sec<br>
Variable image plane power : 0 to 25 mW<br>
Spot diameter : 20 p.m<br>
Address ability : 1270 dpi After imaging the plate was processed in an Agfa VSP85 processor at a speed of 1.2 m/min. Before the processing the plate was optionally heated by passing through the pre-heat section of the processor at 110°C (pre-’heat step) , next the protective overcoat was washed off and the photolayer was processed in a water based alkaline developer (Agfa PD91) at 28 °C. After a water rinsing and gumming step the printing plate was ready, A 13-step exposure wedge<br><br>
with density increments of 0.15 was used to determine sensitivity of<br>
the plate.<br>
The results of the exposure tests are shown in table 4 as the sum of the density of the UGRA step wedges measured by a Greta Maspeth D19C densitometer (cyan setting). One fully hardened step = 1,00* Higher values indicate higher sensitivity of the plate.<br><br>
It can be clearly seen that binders with a Tg below 70*’C give rise to the formation of a good image without the need for a preheat step. The image is even stronger when a higher laser energy is used.<br><br>
B, IR sensitive (thermal) printing plate precursor<br>
A composition was prepared (pw = parts per weight; wt-% = weight percentage) by mixing the components as specified in table 5. A composition such as this was divided into two portions of 78.84 g, and to each portion was added 8.61 g of a 33,0wt,% solution in methylethyl ketone of the binder according to table 2. The resulting composition was coated on an electrochemically roughened and anodically oxidized aluminum sheet, the surface of which has been rendered hydrophilic by treatment with an aqueous solution of polyvinyl phosphonic acid (oxide weight 3 g/m’) and was dried for 1 minute at 120 *’C (circulation oven) .   The resulting thickness of the layer was 1.5 g/m’.<br><br><br>
On top of the photosensitive layer a solution in water with the composition as defined in table 3 was coated and was dried at llO’C for 2 minutes.<br>
The so-formed protective overcoat had a dry thickness of 2.0 g/m’ .<br>
The imaging was carried out with a Creo X36 platesetter equipped with an IR laser diode emitting at 830 nm. The energy received by the plate was varied between 35 and 200 mJ/cm2 and the sensitivity of the plate was defined by the energy at which 53% solid density was obtained on a 50% screen.<br>
After imaging the plate was processed in an Agfa VSP85 processor at a speed of 1.2 m/min. Before the processing the plate was optionally heated by passing through the pre-heat section of the processor at llC’C (pre-heat step), next the protective overcoat was washed off and the photolayer was processed in a water based alkaline developer (Agfa PD91) at 28 °C, After a water rinsing and gumming step the printing plate was ready.<br><br>
The results are shown in Table 6 and the sensitivities were measured by the energy at which 53% solid density was achieved on a 50% screen.<br><br><br>
The results clearly show an improvement in sensitivity when the low Tg binder is used relative to the standard binder 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
