NEW PYRIDAZIN-3(2H)-0NE DERIVATIVES<br>
The present invention relates to new therapeutically useful pyridazin-3(2n)-one derivatives, to processes for their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. These compounds sre potent and selective inhibitors of<br>
chosphodiesterase - (FCE4) and are :hus useful in the treatment, prevention or suppression of pathological conditions, diseases and disorders known io be susceptible of being improved cy inhibition*of PDE4.<br>
Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) comprise a superfamily of enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis and inactivaticn of the second messengers cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAfvlP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Eleven different PDE families have been identified-to date (PDE1 to PDE11) which differ in substrate preference, catalytic activity, sensitivity to endogenous activators and inhibitors, and encoding genes.-<br>
The PDE4 isoenzyme family exhibits a high affinity for cyclic AMP but has weak affinity for cyclic GMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels-caused by PDE4 inhibition are associated with the suppression of cell activation in a wide range of inflammatory and immune cells, including lymphocytes, macrophages, basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils. Moreover, PDE4 inhibition decreases the release of the cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor a (TNFa). The biology cf PDE4 is described in several recent reviews, for example M. D. Houslay, Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. MoL Bid. 2001, 59, 249-315; J. E. Souness et aL Immunopharmacol. 2000 47, 127-162; or M. Conti and S. L. Jin, Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. MoL Biol. 1999, 63, 1-33.<br>
in view of these physiological effects, PDE4 inhibitors of varied chemical structures have been recentlty disclosed for the treatment or prevention of chronic and acute inflammatory diseases and of ether pathological conditions, diseases and disorders known to be susceptible to amelioration by inhibition of PDE4. See, for example, US 5449636, US 5710170, WO 93/45268, WO 99/06404, WO 01/57025, WO 01/57036, WO 01/46184, WO 97/05105, WO 96/40636, JJS 5785354, US 5773467, US*5753666, US 5728712, US 5693659, US 5379696, US 5596013, US 5541219, US 5508300, US 5502072 or H. J. Dyke and J. G. Montana, Exp. Opin. invest Drugs 1999, 8, 1301-1325.<br><br>
A few compounds having the capacity to selectively inhibit phosphodiesterase 4 are in active development. Examples of these compounds are cipamfylline (European Patent number 0 389 282 B1), arofyline (European patent number 0 435 811 Bl), cilomilast, roflumilast (European Patent number I 706 513 B1), mesopram (European Patent number 0 859 766 B1) and pumafentrre (PCT Patent application number 98/21208 A1).<br>
We have now found that a novel series of pyridazin-3(2h')-one derivatives are potent and selective inhibitors of PDE4 and are therefore useful in the treatment or prevention of these pathological conditions, diseases and disorders, in particular asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis or irritable bowel disease.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be used in combination with other drugs known to be effective in the treatment of these diseases. For example, they can be used in combination with steroids or immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporin A, rapamycin orT-cell receptor blockers, in this case the administration of-; the compounds allows a reduction of the dosage of the other drugs, thus preventing the appearance of the undesired side effects associated with both steroids and immunosuppressants.<br>
Like other PDE4 inhibitors (see references above) the compounds of the invention can also be used for blocking the ulcerogenic effects induced by a variety of etiological agents, such as antiinflammatory drugs (steroidal or non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents), stress, ammonia, ethanol and concentrated acids. They can be used aione or in combination with antacids and/or antisecretory drugs in the preventive and/or curative treatment of gastrointestinal pathologies like drug-induced ulcers, peptic ulcers, H. Pylori-related ulcers, esophagitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease.<br>
They can also tje used in the treatment of pathological situations where damage to the cells or tissues is produced through conditions like anoxia or the production of an excess of free radicals. Examples of such beneficial effects are the protection of cardiac tissue after coronary artery occlusion or the prolongation of cell and tissue viability when the compounds of the invention are added to preserving solutions<br><br>
intended for storage of transplant organs cr fluids such as blood or sperm. ; hey are also of benefit on tissue -epair and wcunc healing.<br>

PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIVITY<br>
PDE4 Assay Procedure<br>
Compounds to be tested were resuspended in DMSO at a stock concentration of 1 mM. The compounds were tested at different concentrations varying from 10 u.M to 10 pM to calculate an IC50. These dilutions were done in 96-well plates. In some oases, plates containing diluted compounds were frozen before being assayed. In these cases, the plates were thawed at room temperature and stirred for 15 minutes.<br>
Ten microliters of the diluted compounds were poured into a low binding" assay plate. Eighty microliters of reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 3.3 mM MgCI2, 1.7 mM EGTA, and 15 nM [3H]-cAMP were added to each well. The reaction was initiated by adding ten microliters of a solution containing PDE4. The plate was then incubated under stirring fori hour at room temperature. After incubation the reaction was stopped with 50 microlitres of SPA beads, and the reaction was allowed to incubate for another 20 minutes at room temperature before measuring radioactivity using standard instrumentation.<br><br>
i he reaction mixture was prepared by adding 90 ml of H:0 to :0 mi of 10X assay buffer (500 mM Tris cH 7.5. 53 mM MgCk 17 mivl EGTA), and 40 micrciitres ■ .-C.YLL [3H]-cAMP. SPA beacs soL::cn was prepared by accing 500 mc to 23 mi H:0 for a final concentration of 20 mc.mi beacs and 13 mM z:nc suiphare.<br>
The results are shown, in Tazie 1.<br><br>
It can be seen from Table 1 that the compounds of fcnmcia (I) are potent _ inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE 4). Preferred pyridazin-3(2/-/)-one derivatives of the invention possess an IC=:. value for the inhibition of PDE4 (determined as defined above) of less than 100 niM, preferably less than 50 nM and mcsr preferably less than<br><br>
30 nM. The compounds are also caoable of blocking the production of some proinflammatory cytokines such as. for example, TNFa.<br>
Thus, they can be usee "n the treatment of allergic, inflammatory and immunological diseases, as '.veil as :~ose diseases or conditions -vhere the bicckade of pro-inflammatory cytokines or tre se.active inhibition of PDE 4 cculd be of benefit. These disease states include aszr^.a. chronic obstructive pulmonary cisease, anergic rhinitis, rheumatoid arthritis, cstecarnritis. osteoporosis, bone-fematien disorders, glomeruloneohritis. multiple sclerosis, ankylosing spondylitis, Graves ephtaimepathy, myasthenia gravis, ciabetes :nsicicus. graft rejection, gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel disease, ulcerative cc'ltis or Crohn disease, septic shock, aduit distress respiratory syndrome, and skin diseases'such as atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, acute dermatomyosuis and psoriasis. They can also be used as improvers of cerebrovascular function as v/ell as in the treatment of other CNS related diseases such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease/depression, and as nootropic agents.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are also of benefit when administered in combination with other drugs such as steroids and immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporin A, rapamycin or T-ceii receptor blockers. In this case the administration of the compounds allows a reduction of the dosage of the other drugs, thus preventing the appearance of the undesired side" effects associated with both steroids and immunosuppressants.<br>
Like other PDE4 inhibitors (see references above) the compounds of the invention can also be used for blocking, after preventive and/or curative treatment, the erosive and ulcerogenic effects induced by a variety of etiological agents, such as antiinflammatory drugs (steroidal or non-steroidal antiinflammatony agents), stress, ammonia, ethanoi and concentrated acids.<br>
They can be used alone or in combination with antacids and/or antisecretory drugs in the preventive and/or curative treatment of gastrointestinal pathologies like ■ drug-induced ulcers, peptic ulcers, H. Pylori-related ulcers, esophagitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease.<br><br>
They can also be used in the treatment of pathological situations where damage to the cells or tissues is produced through conditions like anoxia or the production c" =-, excess of free-radicals. Examples cf such beneficial effects are the protection of :ardiac 'issue after coronary artery occlusion or the prolongation of cell and tissue viability when the compounds of the invention are acced to preser/ing solutions Intended for storage of transplant organs or fluids such as blood or sperm. They are aiso of benefit on tissue repair and wound healing. '<br>
