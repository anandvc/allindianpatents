				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an axial flow seed thresher, specifically but without implying any limitation thereto for pulse and oil seed crops.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
After harvesting a crop in any known manner, the seed is separated from the trash by threshing by a seed thresher. The seed threshers known in art operate at high speed and result in higher breakage and splitting of seeds. The seed breakage goes upto 20-25 percent in crops such as Soybean, Greengram in case of existing speed threshers. Another limitation of the existing speed threshers is that crops with high moisture content cannot be threshed with the existing speed threshers. There is no provision for changing concave and concave clearances for threshing different crops which causes breakage of grains and leads to higher content of foreign material and straw. Another drawback is that workers sustain injuries on their hands during feeding crops, particularly crops<br>
like guar, moong, urd, arher etc. as the operator has to manually push the infeed.<br>
Sharma and Devnani (1978) developed a multi crop rasp bar thresher with adjustable clearance and a cylinder beater. The visible grain damage was found to be between 1 to 2% at concave clearances between 4mm to 8mm and a cylinder speed of 6.8m per sec. Sharma and Devnani have reported that though threshing efficiency increased with the increase in the cylinder tip speed but decreased with increase in concave clearance. The visible and internal seed damage increased with the increase in cylinder tip speed and decrease in concave clearance. Although at higher speeds the visible seed damage was within 5 percent yet the internal seed damage was very high. However, the breakage could not be achieved less than 1.0%.<br>
Kamle and Panwar (1984) developed an experimental thresher with provisions for changing threshing cylinder, peripheral speed of cylinder and concave clearance. At peripheral speed between 7 to 13 ms-1, concave clearance between 5mm to 15mm, cylinder type of spike tooth,<br>
rasp bar, round bar, threshing efficiency was between 89 to 99% but the grain damage was very high.<br>
Singhal and thierstem (1987) developed an axial flow thresher with multi-crop potential. At optimum conditions, the threshingefficiency and cleaning efficiency was 95% but breakage was around 2% and unthreshed seeds were not exceeding 5%. Bansal et al reported that for axial flow thresher, mechanical efficiency depended upon moisture content, feeding rate and speed of threshing cylinder. The seed loss could be brought out to less than 1.0% at moisture content of35% and cylinder speed of 6.5 to 7.2 m/sec. with feed rate of 20kg/hour. However the limitation was that the seed thresher could be used only for sunflower crop.<br>
Garg et al developed and evaluated an axial flow thresher for threshing sunflower crop. The threshing efficiency was more than 99% and grain loss was less than 1%. However the limitation was that it was only for sunflower crop.<br>
OBJECTS OF PRESENT INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an axial flow seed thresher.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an axial flow seed thresher wherein crop can be threshed even at higher seed moisture content.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an axial flow seed thresher wherein seed damage is about 1% which results in higher seed recovery whereas the seed damage in existing seed threshers is more than 10%.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an axial flow seed thresher which has higher output resulting in low operating cost.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide an axial flow seed thresher which has relatively less energy requirement.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide an axial flow seed thresher which incorporates a mechanical feeding mechanism thereby resulting in less fatigue to labour during feeding to crop.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide an axial flow seed thresher wherein cylinder speed and aspirator speed are independent and easy to change, depending upon the crop type and conditions whereas in existing machines. There is no provision to adjust these machine variables.<br>
Even further object of the present invention is to provide a co-axial flow seed thresher wherein it is easy to change concave clearance, sieve clearance and slope of sieves.<br>

The axial flow seed thresher of the present invention was tested for its performance evaluation in green gram, black gram, soybean, chickpea, pigeonpea, raya and mustard crop.<br>
Test conditions for performance evaluation of axial flow thresher<br>
Test conditions are given in Table-1. Test performance data are reported in Tables 2-8. Optimization of parameters are prescribed in Table-9.<br>
Test conditions for performance evaluation of axial flow thresher<br>
An axial flow seed thresher tested for its performance evaluation in Green gram, Black gram, Soybean, Raya, Chickpea, Sunflower and Piegeonpea. The test conditions of crop and machine are reported in Table-1. The performance results are reported in table 2 to 9.<br>
Greengram:<br>
Results reported in Table-2 revealed that the minimum seed damage (1.10%) was observed with the use of lower cylinder speed (9.5 m/s) and concave clearance of 15mm at high moisture content (14.0%), which could be attributed due to the reduced impact force to detach the seed from the pod. The higher seed damage (6.26%) at higher speed (17.6 m/s) and low seed moisture content (10%) was observed. It may be due to increased effect of impact and rubbing forces at higher speed. The seed damaged increased from 1.10 to 6.26 percent with the increase in cylinder speed 9.5 to 17.6 m/s and decrease in moisture content from 14 to 10 percent. The frequent chocking in feeding and threshing unit was observed while threshing in greengram crop at seed moisture content of 14 percent.<br>
The threshing efficiency increased with increase in cylinder speed across the studied seed moisture content and cylinder speed. The threshing efficiency was considerably low at lower speed and high seed moisture content. The threshing efficiency was found to be maximum (99%) at cylinder speed of 17.6 m/s and seed moisture content of 10% while it was minimum (94.3%) with the use of cylinder speed of 9.5 m/s at seed moisture content of 14.0% and higher concave clearance of 15mm. The<br>
threshing efficiency increased from 94.3 to 99.5 percent with the increase of cylinder speed from 9.5 to 17.6 m/s and decrease of seed moisture content from 14 to 10 percent and concave clearance from 15 to 5 mm.<br>
The maximum cleaning efficiency (93.2%) was observed at cylinder speed of 17.6 m/s and seed moisture content of 10 percent. It decreases to minimum (82.9%) at 14% seed moisture content and cylinder speed of 9.5 m/s. At low seed moisture content the pods were dried and terminal velocity of straw was much lower than that of seed. Thus, it was easy to separate straw from seed making cleaning efficiency higher.<br>
The seed germination was maximum (92%) when crop was threshed at lower speed (9.5 m/s) with higher concave clearance of 15mm at seed moisture content of 10 to 12 percent. The germination was above the minimum seed certification standard i.e. 75 percent in all the treatments. It may be due to less effect of impact and rubbing forces.<br>
In Greengram, the optimum combinations of operating parameters to have minimum seed injury were identified (Table-9). It is clear from the date that at 10 to 12 percent seed moisture content, cylinder speed should be 9.5 m/s with 10-15mm concave clearance while at 14 percent seed moisture content, cylinder speed should be kept 12.2 m/s with concave clearance of 10mm. The average output of thresher was 4.0 q/h while the cost of threshing was Rs. 60/- per quintal.<br>
Blackgram:<br>
Results reported in Table-3 revealed that the minimum seed damage (1.5%) was observed with the use of cylinder speed (9.5 to 12.2 m/s) and<br>
concave clearance of 15 mm at high moisture content (13.4%), which could be attributed due to the reduced impact force to detach the seed from the pod. The higher seed damage (7.80%) at higher speed (17.6 m/s) and low seed moisture content (10.3%) was observed. The seed damaged increased from 1.5 to 7.8 percent with the increase in cylinder speed 9.5 to 17.6 m/s and decrease in moisture content from 13.4 to 10.3 percent.<br>
The threshing efficiency was considerably low at lower speed and high seed moisture content. The threshing efficiency was found to be maximum (99.6%) at cylinder speed of 17.6 m/s and seed moisture content of 10.3% while it was minimum (93.2%) with the use of cylinder speed of 9.5 m/s at seed moisture content of 13.4% and higher concave clearance of 15mm. The threshing efficiency increased from 93.2 to 99.6 percent with the increase of cylinder speed from 9.5 to 17.6 m/s and decrease of seed moisture content from 13.4 to 10.3 percent and concave clearance from 15 to 5 mm.<br>
The maximum cleaning efficiency (90%) was observed at cylinder speed of 12.2 to 17.6 m/s and seed moisture content of 10.3 to 13.4 percent. It decreased to minimum (83%) at 13.4% seed moisture content and cylinder speed of 9.5 m/s. At low seed moisture content the pods were dried and terminal velocity of straw was much lower than that of seed. Thus, it was easy to separate straw from seeds making cleaning efficiency higher.<br>
The seed germination was maximum (92%) when crop was threshed at lower speed (9.5 m/s) with higher concave clearance of 15mm at seed moisture content of 10.3 to 11.4 percent. The germination was above the minimum seed certification standard i.e. 75 percent in all the treatments. It may be due to less effect of impact and rubbing forces.<br>
In blackgram, the optimum combination of operating parameters to have minimum seed injury were identified (Table-9). It is clear from the table that at 13.4 percent seed moisture content, cylinder speed should be 12.2 m/s with 10mm concave clearance while at 10.3 to 11.4 percent seed moisture content, cylinder speed should be kept 9.5 m/s with concave clearance of 15mm. At 10.3 percent seed moisture content, the visible seed damage was higher (3.1%) while at 11.4 to 13.4 percent seed moisture content the breakage was with in the range of 1.5 percent. It is therefore recommended that the blackgram crop should be threshed between 13.4 to 11.4 percent seed moisture content. The average output of thresher was 4.8 q/h while the cost of threshing was Rs. 50 per quintal.<br>
Soybean:<br>
Results reported in Table-4 revealed that the minimum seed damage (0.15%) was observed with the use of cylinder speed (8.2 m/s) and concave clearance of 15 mm at high seed moisture content (14%), which could be attributed due to the reduced impact force to detach the seed from the pod. The higher seed damage (6.45%) at higher speed (14.7 m/s) and low seed moisture content (10%) was observed. The seed damaged increased from 0.15 to 6.45 percent with the increase in cylinder speed 8.2 to 14.7 m/s and decrease in moisture content from 14 to 10 percent.<br>
The threshing efficiency was considerably low at lower speed and high seed moisture content. The threshing efficiency was found to be maximum (99.4%) at cylinder speed of 14.7 m/s and seed moisture content of 10% while it was minimum (94.7%) with the use of cylinder speed of 11.0 m/s at seed moisture content of 14% and higher concave<br>
clearance of 15mm. The threshing efficiency increased from 94.3 to 99.4 percent with the increase of cylinder speed from 8.2 to 14.7 m/s and decrease of seed moisture content from 14 to 10 percent and concave clearance from 15 to 5 mm.<br>
The maximum cleaning efficiency (90%) was observed at cylinder speed of 11 to 14.7 m/s and seed moisture content of 10 percent. It decreased to minimum (84.5%) at 14% seed moisture content and cylinder speed of 8.2 m/s with concave clearance of 15mm. The seed germination was maximum (90%) when crop was threshed at lower speed (8.2 m/s) with the concave clearance of 10 to 15mm at seed moisture content of 14 percent. The germination was above the minimum seed certification standard i.e. 75 percent in all the treatments. It may be due to less effect of impact and rubbing forces.<br>
In soybean, the optimum combinations of operating parameters to have minimum seed injury were identified (Table-9). It is clear from the table that at seed moisture contents of 10 to 12 percent the cylinder speed and concave clearance should be 8.2 m/s and 15mm respectively. The average output of thresher was 5.0 q/h while the cost of threshing was Rs. 48 per quintal.<br>
Raya:<br>
Results reported in Table-5 revealed that the minimum seed damage (2.02%) was observed with the use of cylinder speed (9.5 m/s) and concave clearance of 15 mm at high seed moisture content (14.8%), which could be attributed due to the reduced impact force to detach the seed from the pod. The higher seed damage (6.72%) at higher speed (17.5 m/s) and low seed moisture content (9.2%) was observed. The seed damaged increased from 2.02 to 6.72 percent with the increase in<br>
cylinder speed 9.5 to 17.5 m/s and decrease in moisture content from 14.8 to 9.2 percent.<br>
