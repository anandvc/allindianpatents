The following specification particularly  describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
1<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a thin film for an optical information recording medium (especially used as a protective film) that has stable film amorphous nature, realizes high deposition speed, is superior in adhesiveness and mechanical properties with the recording layer, has a high transmission factor, and is composed with a non-sulfide system, whereby the deterioration of the adjacent reflective layer and recording layer can be suppressed. The present invention also relates to a manufacturing method of such a thin film, and a sputtering target for use therein.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Conventionally, ZnS-Si02 generally and primarily used as a protective layer of a phase change optical information recording medium has superior characteristics such as in optical characteristics, heat characteristics, and adhesiveness with the recording layer, and is being widely used.<br>
Nevertheless, rewritable DVDs in the present day as represented by Blue-Ray disks are strongly demanded of more write cycles, greater capacity, and faster recording.<br>
As one reason for deterioration in the write cycles of an optical information recording medium, there is the diffusion of a sulfur constituent from the ZnS-Si02 to the recording layer material disposed in between the protective layers formed from ZnS-Si02.<br>
Further, although pure Ag or Ag alloy having high thermal conduction properties with a high reflection ratio is being used as the reflective layer material for realizing high capacity and high-speed recording, this kind of reflective layer is also disposed to come in contact with the protective layer material of ZnS-Si02.<br>
Therefore, in this case also, as a result of diffusion of the sulfur constituent from the ZnS-SiO2, the pure Ag or Ag alloy reflective layer material is subject to corrosive degradation, and would cause the characteristic degradation in the reflection ratio of the optical information recording medium.<br>
As a measure for preventing the diffusion of such sulfur constituent, attempts have been made to provide an intermediate layer having nitrides or carbides as its primary component between the reflective layer and protective layer, and between the recording layer and protective layer. Nevertheless, this results in an increased number of layers, and there is a problem in that throughput will deteriorate and<br>
2<br><br>
costs will increase.<br>
In order to overcome the foregoing problems, there is a pressing need to substitute the protective layer material with an oxide material that does not contain sulfides, or discover a material having optical characteristics and amorphous stability that are equivalent to or better than ZnS-Si02.<br>
Further, since a ceramic target of ZnS-Si02 or the like has high bulk electric resistance, it is not possible to perform deposition with a DC sputtering device, and a radio frequency sputtering (RF) device is generally used.<br>
In reality, not only is this radio frequency sputtering (RF) device an expensive device, it has numerous drawbacks in that the sputtering efficiency is inferior, power consumption is significant, control is difficult, and deposition speed is slow.<br>
Moreover, when high power is applied to increase the deposition speed, there is a problem in that the substrate temperature will rise, and a polycarbonate substrate would deform.<br>
In light of the above, a transparent conductive material that does not use ZnS; in other words, that does not contain a sulfur constituent has been proposed (refer to Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 2).<br>
Nevertheless, Patent Document 1 has a problem in that it contains areas where the optical characteristics and amorphous nature are inferior, and Patent Document 2 has a problem in that it contains areas where sufficient deposition speed cannot be obtained, and where the amorphous nature is inferior. [Patent Document 1] Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2000-256059 [Patent Document 2] Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2000-256061<br>
SUMMARY<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a thin film for an optical information recording medium (especially used as a protective film) that has stable film amorphous nature, realizes high deposition speed, is superior in adhesiveness and mechanical properties with the recording layer, has a high transmission factor, and is composed with a non-sulfide system, whereby the deterioration of the adjacent reflective layer and recording layer can be suppressed. The present invention also provides a manufacturing method of such a thin film, and a sputtering target for use therein. As a result, the present invention is able to improve the performance of the optical information recording medium, and to considerably<br>
3<br><br>
improve the productivity thereof.<br>
In order to overcome the foregoing problems, as a result of intense study, the present inventors discovered that, by substituting the conventional protective layer material ZnS-Si02 with an oxide material presented below that does not contain sulfides, it is possible to ensure optical characteristics and amorphous stability that are equivalent to ZnS-Si02, and it is further possible to realize high-speed deposition while improving the characteristics of the optical information recording medium and improving the productivity.<br>
Based on the foregoing discovery, the present invention provides 1) a sputtering target formed from a material obtained by adding any one or both of Ta and Y elements to an In203-Zn0-Sn02 system compound oxide having Sn02 as its primary component, 2) the sputtering target according to 1) above, wherein when any one or both of Ta and Y elements are A, the sputtering target is formed from oxide composed with the respective element ratios being ln/(ln + Zn + Sn + A) = 0.005 to 0.41, Zn/(ln + Zn + Sn + A) = 0.03 to 0.45, Sn/(ln + Zn + Sn + A) = 0.13 to 0.82, and A/(ln + Zn + Sn + A) = 0.08 to 0.66, and 3) the sputtering target according to 1) or 2) above, wherein when any one or both of Ta and Y elements are A, the sputtering target is formed from oxide composed with (Sn + A)/(ln + Zn + Sn + A) = 0.45 to 0.92.<br>
Further, the present invention also provides 4) the sputtering target according to any one of 1) to 3) above, wherein the relative density is 90% or higher, 5) an optical information recording medium, wherein the sputtering target according to any one of 1) to 4) above is used at least as a thin film in forming a part of an optical information recording medium structure, and a manufacturing method thereof, and 6) an optical information recording medium, wherein the sputtering target according to any one of 1) to 5) above is used at least as a thin film in forming a part of an optical information recording medium structure and disposed adjacent to a recording layer or a reflective layer, and a manufacturing method thereof.<br>
Effect of the Invention<br>
As a result of the above, by substituting the protective layer material ZnS-S1O2 with an oxide material that does not contain sulfides, the deterioration of the adjacent reflective layer and recording layer caused by sulfur can be suppressed, it<br>
4<br><br>
is possible to provide to a thin film for an optical information recording medium (especially used as a protective film) that has superior characteristics such as having optical characteristics and amorphous stability that are equivalent to or better than ZnS-Si02, realizing high deposition speed, being superior in adhesiveness and mechanical properties with the recording layer, and having a high transmission factor, as well as a manufacturing method of such a thin film, and a sputtering target for use therein.<br>
Further, by using this material, a superior effect is yielded in that it is possible to improve the performance of the optical information recording medium, and considerably improve the productivity thereof.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The sputtering target of the present invention is formed from a material obtained by adding any one or both of Ta and Y elements to an In203-Zn0-Sn02 system compound oxide having SnO2 as its primary component.<br>
It has been discovered that this material has stable optical characteristics and amorphous nature of the film, is suitable as a protective layer material of a phase change optical recording medium, and the sputtering deposition speed is also high.<br>
As a result of further adding an adequate amount of Ta205, Y203 to this material, the amorphous nature can be stabilized and the transmission factor can be improved even further, and, therefore, this is suitable as a protective layer material for a phase change recording medium or a blue laser phase change recording medium with a fast rewriting speed.<br>
Further, in particular, when any one or both of Ta and Y elements are A, it is desirable that the sputtering target of the present invention is formed from oxide composed with the respective element ratios being ln/(ln + Zn + Sn + A) = 0.005 to 0.41, Zn/(ln + Zn + Sn + A) = 0.03 to 0.45, Sn/(ln + Zn + Sn + A) = 0.13 to 0.82, and A/(ln + Zn + Sn + A) = 0.08 to 0.66. This is a range where the amorphous stability can be maintained and the optical characteristics are favorable. When deviating from the foregoing numerical range, the foregoing characteristics tend to become inferior.<br>
Further, when any one or both of Ta and Y elements are A, it is possible that the sputtering target of the present invention is formed from oxide composed with (Sn + A)/(ln + Zn + Sn + A) = 0.45 to 0.92.   As a result, it is possible to further improve<br>
5<br><br>
the optical characteristics and deposition speed.<br>
Further, the sputtering target of the present invention is able to achieve a relative density of 90% or higher. The improvement in density yields an effect of improving the uniformity of the sputtered film and inhibiting the generation of particles during sputtering.<br>
The sputtering target described above can be used to form a thin film in a part of an optical information recording medium structure to provide an optical information recording medium. Further, using the foregoing sputtering target, an optical information recording medium that is a thin film in a part of an optical information recording medium structure and is disposed adjacent to a recording layer or a reflective layer can be made.<br>
As a result of forming a material having as its primary component SnO2 composed from the oxides of ln203 and ZnO and Sn02, conductivity can be retained, and, as a result, it is possible to use direct current sputtering (DC sputtering) to form a thin film depending on the selected material.<br>
In comparison to RF sputtering, DC sputtering is superior in that the deposition speed is high, and sputtering efficiency is favorable. Further, a DC sputtering device has advantages in that it is inexpensive, easy to control, and requires less power.<br>
Further, since it will be possible to thinly form the film thickness of the protective film itself by adjusting the optical characteristics, it will be possible to exhibit further effects of improving the productivity and preventing the heating of the substrate.<br>
Moreover, the thin film formed using the sputtering target of the present invention forms a part of the optical information recording medium structure and is disposed adjacent to the recording layer or reflective layer, but as described above, since ZnS is not used, there is no contamination by S, there is no diffusion of the sulfur constituent to the recording layer material disposed between the protective layers, and there is a significant effect in that the deterioration of the recording layer can be prevented thereby.<br>
Further, when using pure Ag or Ag alloy having high thermal conduction properties at a high reflection ratio as material of adjacent reflective layer for realizing high capacity and high-speed recording, diffusion of the sulfur constituent to such adjacent reflective layers will not occur, and a superior effect is yielded in<br>
6<br><br>
that the cause of the reflective layer material being subject to corrosive degradation and causing characteristic degradation in the reflection ratio of the optical information recording medium can be cleared out.<br>
The sputtering target of the present invention can be manufactured by subjecting the oxide powder of the respective constituent elements, in which the average grain size is 5pm or less, to pressureless sintering or high temperature pressure sintering. It is thereby possible to obtain a sputtering target having a relative density of 90% or higher. In such a case, it is desirable to calcinate the oxide powder having tin oxide as its primary component at a temperature of 800 to 1300X before sintering. After this calcination, the resultant powder is pulverized to 3pm or less and used as the raw material for sintering.<br>
Further, by using the sputtering target of the present invention, a significant effect is yielded in that it is possible to improve the productivity, obtain a high-quality material, and stably manufacture an optical recording medium having an optical disk protective film at low costs.<br>
Improvement in the density of the sputtering target of the present invention reduces holes and miniaturizes crystal grains, and enables the sputtered face of the target to become uniform and smooth. As a result, a significant result is yielded in that particles and nodules generated during sputtering can be reduced, the target life can be extended, and the mass productivity can be improved with minimal variation in the quality. Examples<br>
Examples and Comparative Examples of the present invention are now explained. These Examples are merely illustrative, and the present invention shall in no way be limited thereby. In other words, the present invention shall only be limited by the scope of the present invention, and shall include the various modifications other than the Examples of this invention. (Examples 1 to 6)<br>
ln2O3 powder, Sn02 powder, Ta205 powder, Y2O3 powder equivalent of 4N and 5pm or less and ZnO powder equivalent of 4N and an average grain size of 5pm or less were prepared, and these powders were mixed to achieve the composition shown in Table 1 and Table 2, subject to wet blending, dried, and thereafter calcinated at 1100°C.<br>
Further, after subjecting the calcinated powder to wet pulverization up to an<br>

Amorphous nature was represented with the maximum peak strength against an undeposited glass substrate in a range of 20 = 20-60° in the XRD measurement of the deposition sample subject to anneal processing (600°C * 30min, Ar atmosphere).<br><br>
The foregoing 6-inchq&gt;size target subject to finish processing was used to<br>
perform sputtering. The sputtering conditions were DC sputtering, RF sputtering, sputtering power of 1000W, and Ar gas pressure of 0.5Pa, and deposition was performed at a target film thickness of 1500A.<br>
Results of the measured transmission factor (wavelength 633nm)%, refractive index (wavelength 633nm), amorphous nature (represented with the maximum peak strength against an undeposited glass substrate in a range of 20 = 20-60° in the XRD<br>
measurement (Cu-Ka, 40kV, 30mA) of the deposition sample subject to anneal<br>
processing (600°C * 30min, Ar atmosphere), as well as the sputtering method and deposition speed (A/sec) of the deposition sample are shown in Table 1 and Table 2.<br>
As a result of the above, the sputtering target of Examples 1 to 6 achieved a relative density of 90 to 98%, and stable DC sputtering or RF sputtering could be performed. In addition, the deposition speed achieved 1.8 to 4.5A/sec, and showed extremely favorable sputtering performance.<br>
The transmission factor of the sputtered film achieved 95 to 98% (633nm), the refractive index was 2.0 to 2.2, no specific crystal peak could be observed, and possessed a stable amorphous nature (1.0 to 1.3).<br>
Since the targets of the Examples do not use ZnS, there is no characteristic degradation in the optical information recording medium caused by the diffusion or contamination of sulfur. Further, in comparison to the Comparative Examples described later, the transmission factor, refractive index, amorphous stability, target density, and deposition speed of the deposition sample all showed favorable numerical values, and DC sputtering could be performed depending on the selected component composition. (Comparative Examples 1 to 5)<br>
As shown in Table 1 and Table 2, materials having components and compositions of raw material powder that are different from the conditions of the present invention were prepared, and, particularly in Comparative Example 5, ZnS raw material powder was prepared, and targets were prepared with these materials under the same conditions as the Examples, and such targets were used to form a sputtered film. The results are similarly shown in Table 1 and Table 2.<br>
With respect to the components and compositions of the Comparative<br>
12<br><br>
Examples that deviate from the composition ratio of the present invention; for instance regarding Comparative Example 1, although the deposition speed was fast since the Sn oxide content was high and the Ta oxide content was low, the transmission factor was 82%, the refractive index was 2.3 and the amorphous nature was 2.0 and showed inferior results.<br>
With Comparative Example 2, since the Zn oxide content was low and the Ta oxide content was high, the amorphous nature deteriorated, and the deposition speed was 0.5A/sec and showed significantly inferior results.<br>
With Comparative Example 3, since the In oxide content was high and the Y oxide content was low, the transmission factor was inferior at 89, and the amorphous nature was also inferior at 3.1.<br>
With Comparative Example 4, since the ZnO content was high and the Sn02 was low, the amorphous nature deteriorated, and the deposition speed was 0.4A/sec and showed significantly inferior results.<br>
Further, Comparative Example 5 in particular contained large amounts of ZnS, and resulted in a material with risk of being contamination with sulfur.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
Since the thin film formed by using a sputtering target of the present invention forms a part of the structure of the optical information recording medium and does not use ZnS, it yields a significant effect in that diffusion of the sulfur constituent to the recording layer material will not occur, and deterioration of the recording layer can be prevented thereby. Further, when using pure Ag or Ag alloy having high thermal conduction properties at a high reflection ratio as material of adjacent reflective layers, diffusion of the sulfur constituent to such reflective layers will not occur, and a superior effect is yielded in that the cause of the reflective layer being subject to corrosive degradation and causing characteristic degradation can be cleared out.<br>
Further, in addition to the amorphous nature becoming stabilized, the target will be provided with conductivity, and stable DC sputtering will be enabled depending on the material by making the relative density a high density of 90% or higher. Moreover, there is a significant effect in that the controllability of sputtering, which is a feature of this DC sputtering, can be facilitated, the deposition speed can be increased, and the sputtering efficiency can also be improved.  Further still, there<br>
13<br><br>
is significant effect in that it is possible to reduce the particles (dust) or nodules arising during sputtering upon performing deposition, improve the mass productivity with little variation in quality, and stably manufacture an optical recording medium having an optical disk protective film at low costs.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
A sputtering target formed from a material obtained by adding any one or both of Ta and Y elements to an In203-Zn0-Sn02 compound oxide having Sn02 as its primary component. The present invention relates to a thin film for an optical information recording medium (especially used as a protective film) that has stable film amorphous nature, realizes high deposition speed, is superior in adhesiveness and mechanical properties with the recording layer, has a high transmission factor, and is composed with a non-sulfide system, whereby the deterioration of the adjacent reflective layer and recording layer can be suppressed. The present invention also relates to a manufacturing method of such a thin film, and a sputtering target for use therein. Accordingly, in addition to improving the performance of the optical information recording medium, the productivity can also be considerably improved.<br></td>
