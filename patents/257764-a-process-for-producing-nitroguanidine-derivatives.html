TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for producing nitroguanidine derivatives having an insecticidal activity.<br>
BACKGROUND ART [0002]<br>
Nitroguanidine derivatives having an insecticidal activity and a process for producing the same have been disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 1990-288860, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 1991-157308, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 1991-291267 and Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 1995-179448. However, for example, as typically described in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 1995-179448 and the like, the problem occurs in the production method that exchange reactions between isothiourea derivatives and amines are frequent, thereby releasing mercaptans as by-products having a strong distasteful odor.  As an alternative method, in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 1998-120666, there has been a disclosed process for producing guanidine derivatives represented by the following general formula (B) having an insecticidal activity, in which isourea compounds represented by the following general formula (A) or a salt thereof and amines or a salt thereof<br>
are reacted, [0003]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
[0004]<br>
wherein, in the formula, R1 represents a hydrocarbon group which may be substituted; R2 represents hydrogen or a hydrocarbon group which may be substituted; Q represents a heterocyclic group which may be substituted; and X represents an electron-withdrawing group,<br>
[0005]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
[0006]<br>
wherein, in the formula, R3 represents an amino group which may. be substituted; and R2, Q and X represent the same as those described above.<br>
However, according to this method, there is a problem in that expensive isourea compounds represented by the general formula (A) must be employed as intermediates in order to produce guanidine derivatives represented by the general formula (B) having an insecticidal activity, thus increasing the production cost.<br>
[0007]<br>
As an alternative method, in Japanese Patent Laid-open No.<br>
2000-103776, there has been disclosed a process for producing guanidine derivatives having an insecticidal activity, in which inexpensive nitroisourea derivatives or a salt thereof and amines or a salt thereof are reacted. [0008]<br>
However, there were some problems to be solved for industrial application such that the stability of the nitroisourea derivatives are low, by-products are generated in large quantities in the reaction and the like. [0009]<br>

[0022]<br>
The process for producing nitroguanidine derivatives of the present invention or a salt thereof is a process for producing . nitroguanidine derivatives represented by the following general formula (3) or a salt thereof, in which nitroisourea derivatives: represented by the following general formula (1) or a salt thereof; and compounds represented by the following general formula (2) or a salt thereof are reacted in the presence of a base in an aqueous solution wherein an inorganic salt is dissolved at not less than 50% of its saturated solubility,<br>
[0023]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
[0024]<br>
wherein, in the formula, R1 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a benzyl group; R2 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and R3 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms,<br>
[0025]<br>

 [0026]<br>
wherein, in the formula, R4, R5 and R6 each independently represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon<br>
atoms; and Q represents a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic group which contains at least one each of a nitrogen atom, an oxygen atom and a sulfur atom and may be substituted with a halogen atom (The heterocyclic group herein represents a pyridyl group, a pyridine-N-oxide group, a pyrimidinyl group, a pyridazyl group, a furyl group, a tetrahydrofuryl group, a thienyl group, a tetrahydrothienyl group, a tetrahydropyranyl group, an oxazolyl group, an isoxazolyl group, an oxadiazolyl group, a thiazolyl group, an isothiazolyl group, a thiadiazolyl group, a pyrrole group, an imidazolyl group, a triazolyl group, a pyrazolyl group or a tetrazolyl group.), [0027]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0028]<br>
wherein, in the formula, R2 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; R3, R4, R5 and R6 each independently represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and Q represents a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic group which contains at least one each of a nitrogen atom, an oxygen atom and a sulfur atom and may be substituted with a halogen atom (The heterocyclic group herein represents the same as those described above).<br>
[0029]<br>
The method of the present invention makes it possible to suppress the decomposition of the starting material by carrying out the reaction in an aqueous solution wherein an inorganic salt is<br>
dissolved at not less than 50% of its saturated solubility, and further to suppress the generation of by-products such as nitroisourea derivatives represented by the following general formula (4) or the like by carrying out the reaction in the presence of a base, [0030]<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0033]<br>
wherein, in the formula, R1 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; R4, R5 and R6 each independently represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and Q represents a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic group which contains at least one each of a nitrogen atom, an oxygen atom and a sulfur atom and may be substituted with a halogen atom (The heterocyclic group herein represents the same as those described above).<br>
[0034]<br>
This enables the process of the present invention to obtain desired nitroguanidine derivatives or a salt thereof in a high yield as compared to the prior art, and at the same time to reduce a purification load.  In this way, the production method of the present invention is excellent in the productivity, environmental sustainability and economical efficiency, and is useful as an industrial production method.<br>
[0035]<br>
The salt of the compound (3), the compound (1) and the amine derivatives (2) may be a salt which can be industrially allowable, and examples thereof include salts of inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, perchloric acid and the like; and salts of<br>
organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, benzoic acid, picric acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and the like.  Of these salts, preferably used are hydrochloride and sulfate.<br>
[0036]<br>
Specifically, the reaction can be performed in accordance with the following method.  The amine derivatives (2) are known compounds, and can be produced, for example, by a method described in DE 3727126A, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 1993-286936, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 1995-179448, EP 446913A, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 1992-21674 or the like.<br>
[0037]<br>
The amine derivatives (2) or a salt thereof are used in an amount of from 0.8 to 10 mole equivalents and preferably from 0.9 to 1.5 mole equivalents, based on the compound (1) or a salt thereof. By carrying out the reaction within the above range, the generation of by-products can be effectively suppressed, and at the same time the reaction of the amine derivatives (2) or a salt thereof and the compound (1) or a salt thereof can be selectively carried out. Thus, the guanidine derivatives can be obtained in a high yield.<br>
[0038]<br>
By carrying out the reaction in the presence of a base, side reaction with amino group can be suppressed and the reaction selectivity can be enhanced. As such a basic substance, there can be used, for example, inorganic bases such as alkali metal carbonate (such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or the<br><br>
like), alkali metal hydroxide (such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or the like), and alkaline earth metal hydroxide (such as calcium hydroxide or the like). In the present invention, one or more kinds of these substances can be selected and used. These bases can be properly selected in the range of 0.05 to 5 mole equivalents, based on the compound (1) and used.<br>
[0039]<br>
By carrying out the reaction in suspension of the compound (1) and an aqueous solution wherein an inorganic salt is dissolved at not less than 50% of its saturated solubility, the decomposition of the compound (1) can be suppressed and the reaction yield can be enhanced. The amount of the inorganic salt can be properly selected in the range of 50 to 100% of its saturated solubility, but it is preferably selected in the range of 70 to 100% of its saturated solubility from the viewpoint of the above effects. Incidentally, the saturated solubility of the inorganic salt is a value at a water temperature at the time of the reaction of the compound (1) and the compound (2).<br>
[0040]<br>
The inorganic salts reduce the solubility of the compound (1) and at the same time serves as a freezing mixture. It is considered that the reaction makes it possible to suppress the decomposition of the compound (1) and also to enhance the reaction selectivity when the initial reaction temperature is as low as possible. The present inventors have conducted an extensive study on the basis of such knowledge and as a result, have found that these effects can be achieved when the concentration of the inorganic salt is<br>
not less than 50% of its saturated solubility.<br>
[0041]<br>
As such an inorganic salt, there can be used lithium salts such as lithium chloride, lithium bromide, lithium iodide, lithium nitrate, lithium sulfate and the like; sodium salts such as sodium chloride, sodium bromide, sodium iodide, sodium nitrate, sodium sulfate and the like; potassium salts such as potassium chloride, potassium bromide, potassium iodide, potassium nitrate, potassium sulfate, potassium phosphate and the like; magnesium salts such as magnesium chloride, magnesium bromide, magnesium iodide, magnesium nitrate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium phosphate and the like; and calcium salts such as calcium chloride, calcium bromide, calcium iodide, calcium nitrate, calcium sulfate, calcium phosphate and the like. In the present invention, one or more kinds of these salts can be selected and used.<br>
[0042]<br>
The amount of the inorganic salt is properly selected in the range of 50 to 100% of its saturated solubility.  Herein, the saturated solubility is defined as a relative value of the concentration of the inorganic salt that is actually dissolved on the assumption that the saturated solubility of inorganic salt in water is 100%. For example, since the concentration of a saturated sodium chloride solution at 20 degree centigrade is about 26.4 weight %, the saturated solubility of 50 to 100% of sodium chloride at 20 degree centigrade means a concentration of 13.2 to 26.4 weight %.<br>
[0043]<br>
The reaction temperature is usually in the range of -30 to 100 degree centigrade and preferably in the range of -20 to 50 degree centigrade. The reaction time is usually in the range of 10 minutes to 50 hours and preferably in the range of 1 to 25 hours.<br>
[0044]<br>
In the present invention, it is preferable that Ri and R2 are each independently an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, R3 is a hydrogen atom, and R4, R5 and R6 are each independently a hydrogen atom. Of these, Q is preferably a 2-chloro-5-thiazolyl group, a 2-chloro-5-pyridinyl group or a 3-tetrahydrofuranyl group because of its excellent insecticidal activity.<br>

Example 4<br>
[0053]<br>
Preparation of 1-[(2-chloro-5-pyridyl)methyl]-3-methyl-2-nitroguanidine (Compound (3))<br>
1.3 g of sodium chloride and 4.65 g of water were mixed, and the resulting mixture was cooled to -10 degree centigrade. N,O-dimethyl-N'-nitroisourea (4.5 g, 0.03 mole) was introduced into the above solution, and 0.58 g (4.64 mmole) of 32% NaOH was further added to the suspention and stirred.  Thereafter, [(2-chloro-5-pyridyl)methyl]amine (4.93 g, 0.03 mole) was introduced dropwise to the suspension.  Sodium chloride was dissolved in water with 78% of the saturated solubility at a water<br>
temperature of -10 degree centigrade.  The solution was stirred at -10 degree centigrade for 4 hours and then heated to 20 degree centigrade, and further stirred for 6 hours.  Then, 35% hydrochloric acid (0.7 g, 6.71 mmole) was added to the suspension so that the pH became not more than 4 . The resulting solution was extracted with ethyl acetate and concentrated under a reduced pressure, and then recrystallized.  Thus, 6.5 g of a 1-[(2-chloro-5-pyridyl)methyl]-3-methyl-2-nitroguanidine was obtained.  The isolated yield at this time was 81%.<br>
[0054]<br>
1H-NMR(DMSO-d6,ppm):2.85(3H,br-s),4.44(2H,d,J=5.4Hz),7.51(1H ,d,J=8.3Hz),7.72(lH,br-s),7.8 0(1H,dd,J=8.3, 2.4Hz),8.37(1H,d,J= 2.4Hz),9.19(lH,br-s)<br>
Example 5<br>
[0055]<br>
Preparation of <br>
l-methyl-2-nitro-3-[(3-trahydrofuryl)methyl]guanidine (Compound (3))<br>
18.75 g of sodium chloride, 115.0 g of water, 3.01 g (0.07 mole) of 96% NaOH and [(3-tetrahydrofuryl)methyl]amine (39.9 g, 0.39 mole) were mixed, and the resulting mixture was cooled to -10 degree centigrade. N,0-dimethyl-N'-nitroisourea (49.2 g, 0.37 mole) was introduced into the above solution. Sodium chloride was dissolved in water with 53% of the saturated solubility at a water temperature of -10 degree centigrade. The solution was stirred at -10 degree centigrade for 4 hours, heated to 0 degree centigrade, and further stirred for 19 hours.  Then, 35% hydrochloric acid (13.1 g, 0.13<br>
mole) was added to the suspension so that the pH became not more than 4. The suspension was heated and dissolved for carrying out recrystallization. The precipitated crystal was filtered, and the filtered crystal was washed with cold water and then dried. 59 g of a l-methyl-2-nitro-3-[(3-tetrahydrofuryl)methyl]guanidine with a purity of 99% was obtained. The isolated yield at this time was 78%.<br>
[0056]<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
To a solution obtained by mixing 7.2 g of sodium chloride and 53.8 g of water was added N,O-dimethyl-N'-nitroisourea (49.2 g, 0.37 mole).  The above suspension was cooled to -10 degree centigrade and as a result, it was solidified. In addition, sodium; chloride was dissolved in water with 45% of the saturated solubility at a water temperature of -10 degree centigrade.<br>
[0057]<br>
Comparative Example 4<br>
To a solution of 1.0 g of N, O-dimethyl-N'-nitroisourea and 10 ml of methanol was added 0.91 g of<br>
[(3-tetrahydrofuryl)methyl]amine, and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours.  Then, an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution (4M) was added to the solution and subsequently extracted with ethyl acetate.<br>
In Comparative Example 2, 2-nitro-l,3-bis(tetrahydro-3-furylmethyl)guanidine of a by-product was generated in an amount of 5 mole%, based on 100 mole% of the starting material, which was difficult to be removed.  On;<br>
the other hand, since the reaction highly selectively proceeded in a high yield by the method described in Example 2, the amount of 2-nitro-l,3-bis(tetrahydro-3-furylmethyl)guanidine as a by-product was less than 1 mole%, thus greatly reducing the amount of the by-product.  That is, according to the present invention, it is possible to reduce the load when the desired compound of l-methyl-2-nitro-3-(tetrahydro-3-furylmethyl)guanidine is purified.  Thus, the method is useful as an industrial production method.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
