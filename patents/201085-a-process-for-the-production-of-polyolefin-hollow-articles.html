				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to the production of polyolefin hollow articles by the roto-mol-ding process, the processing stabilizer combination described hereinbelow being used.<br>
The rotomolding or rotational molding/casting process is used for the production of fairly large plastic hollow articles which may be reinforced with glass fibres (Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, Wiley Interscience, 1988, Vol. 14, pages 659-670). In principle, this process is carried out as follows: The plastic material is filled into one half of the mold which is then closed with the other half and heated in an oven such that the fused plastic material spreads to the walls of the mold when rotated around different axes. The hollow article is obtained after cooling. In this manner it is possible to produce, for example, storage and truck tanks from HD polyethylene. The process normally requires temperatures in the range above 300°C, sometimes even above 400°C. The requirements placed on the stabilizers are therefore different from and more stringent than those, for example, of the extrusion process where the temperatures are normally not much above 280°C.<br>
The use of stabilizer combinations of phosphites or phosphonites with sterically hindered phenols and/or sterically hindered amines (HALS) in polyolefins is known [see, inter alia, R. Gachter, H. Muller, "Plastics Additives Handbook", Hanser Publishers, pages 40-71 (1990)].<br>
Hydroxylamine derivatives, such as N,N,-dialkylhydroxylamines and N,N-dibenzylhydroxyl-amine, are well known as useful stabilizers for a variety of polymeric substrates as is taught for example in U.S. Patent Nos. 4.590,231, 4,668,721, 4,782,105 and 4,876,300, the relevant parts of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,649,221, 4,691,015 and 4,703,073 teach the use of polyhydroxylamine compounds, hydroxylamines derived from hindered amines and alkylated N,N-dibenzyl-^ hydroxylamine derivatives, respectively, with one or more compounds selected from the group of phenolic antioxidants, hindered amine light stabilizers, alkylated hydroxybenzoate light stabilizers, ultraviolet light absorbers, organic phosphorus compounds, alkaline metal salts of fatty acids and thiosynergists towards stabilizing polyolefins.<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,782,105 discloses the use of long chain N.N-dialkylhydroxylamines for the stabilization of poly(arylene sulfides) and unsaturated elastomers. Examples are shown where long chain N,N-dialkylhydroxylamines are used together with phosphite stabilizers in styrene/butadiene copolymer.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,876,300 discloses the use of long chain N,N-dialkylhydroxylamines as process stabilizers for polyolefin compositions. Examples are shown where long chain N,N-dialkylhydroxylamines are used together with phosphite stabilizers and also where they are used together with hindered amine stabilizers.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,590,231 and 4,668,721 disclose the use of N,N-dibenzylhydroxylamine or other hydroxylamine derivatives together with metal salts of fatty acids and phenolic antioxidants for the stabilization of polyolefin compositions. The compositions may also contain organic phosphorus compounds or hindered amine stabilizers.<br>
U.S, Patent No. 5,013,510 teaches a process for the preparation of long-chain N,N-dialkyl-hydroxylamines by direct oxidation. It is mentioned that the long-chain N,N-dialkylhydroxyl-amines are effective towards stabilizing polyolefin compositions.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,596,033 discloses the stabilization of polypropylene fiber with a binary system of select hindered amines with the N,N-dialkylhydroxylamine produced by the direct oxidation of N,N-di(hydrogenated tallow)amine.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,149,774 discloses the use of hydroxylamine derivatives towards reducing color formation during the recycling of already discolored polyolefin resins.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5.844,029 and 5,880,191 disclose the use of saturated hydrocarbon amine oxides towards the stabilization of thermoplastic resins. It is disclosed that the thermoplastic compositions may further contain a stabilizer or mixture of stabilizers selected from phenolic antioxidants, hindered amine light stabilizers, ultraviolet light absorbers, organic phosphorus compounds, alkaline metal salts of fatty acids and thiosynergists. The co-use of amine oxides with other stabilizers towards stabilizing polyolefins is not exemplified.<br><br>
It has now been found that the combination of hydroxylamine derivatives, together with organic phosphites or phosphonites and hindered amine stabilizers results in excellent stabiliza-tion in the rotomolding process. The hollow articles prepared according to the present invention exhibit excellent initial color and gas fading resistance.<br>
Accordingly, this invention relates to a novel process for the production of polyolefin hollow articles, which comprises charging the polyolefin with a stabilizer combination, comprising<br>
(a)	at least one compound from the group of the organic phosphites and phosphonites,<br>
(b)	one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of<br>

100 parts medium density polyethylene, copolymerized with hexene (Novapol® TR-0735, nominal melt index 6.8 g/10 min., density 0.935 g/cm3) are dry blended with 0.050 parts of calcium stearate and a combination of additional stabilizers (see below). The mixtures are melt compounded into pellets at 232°C in a Superior/MPM extruder using a 24:1 UD screw with Maddock mixing head at 100 rpm. The compounded pellets are ground to a uniform particle size (150-500 µm) prior to the rotational molding process. This grinding step increases the surface area of the particles leading to a faster heat absorption, and thus reducing overall energy consumption. The rotational molding process is performed in a laboratory scale equipment FSP M20 "Clamshell". The ground resin is placed in a cast aluminum mold, which is rotated biaxially in a gas fired oven. Hot air is circulated by blowers in the chamber while the temperature is increased to 288°C within 4 minutes. This temperature is maintained for a specific time (see Tables below). Subsequently, the oven is opened and while still rotating, the moid is cooled with forced air circulation for 7 minutes, followed by water spray mist for 7 minutes, and an additional air cooling step for 2 minutes. Throughout the entire heating and cooling cycles, the speed of the major axis is maintained at 6 rpm with a 4.5 : 1 ratio of rotation. After the cooling cycles, the mold is opened and the hollow object removed.<br>
