				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention generally relates to building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) buildings. More particularly, the invention relates to a Light Management system in a BIPV building.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Most of the prior art Light Management systems operating based on natural lights, use the glass windows in the house with sun films of varying transmission. Although, these prior art light Management systems are the cheapest one, but these systems provide light only for certain duration of the day depending on the availability of natural light including direction of the house, it is built-in. Further, such systems reduce comfort level due to the natural light-introducing glare during some part of the day.<br>
To improve the comfort-level with natural lighting, the prior art disclose several sophisticated optical systems such as i) Natural lightings using concentrators, PV Cells, mirrors and fibers (US2008023060 (A1) also published as WO2005124875 (A1)) or ii) a modular natural lighting system having a microprocessor controlled heliostat which collects the sunlight and direct it to the mirrors inside the building for illumination (US4349245 (A)). Additionally, JP6322958A discloses an invention, in which the natural light is collected from the side of the terrace of the building and directed inside the building through the light ducts.<br>
 <br>
Admittedly, most of the sophisticated natural lighting systems of the prior art provide acceptable level of interior illumination. However, these known systems failed to fetch wide acceptance due to high cost, or due to their inability to provide light throughout the day. In other words, these systems provide light only during some part of they day.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a Light Management system for BIPV-building, which eliminates the disadvantages of prior art.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a Light Management system for BIPV-building, which provides glare-free natural light into the building throughout the day in various seasons.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to propose a Light Management system for BIPV-building, which is simple and less expensive.<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose a Light Management system for BIPV-building, which substantially reduces the energy consumption of the building.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a 'light management system' adaptable to<br>
 <br>
Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) buildings. According to the invention, a plurality of Semi transparent solar laminates are incorporated in the Building. These laminates are disposed on the roof of the building. The laminates generate electric energy and allows ingress of partial sunlight in the building. A plurality of light diffusers are provided below the laminates which constitute a false roofing, and which allow transmission of the diffused light in the building. In the southern side of the building, a plurality of titled windows with semi transparent laminates are incorporated, which generates electric power, and further allow ingress of the sunlight inside the building. In addition, the Eastern, Western and Northern side walls of the building are provided with glass windows to allow transmission of sufficient light in the building.<br>
The light management system disclosed herein can be adapted for PV designing and making of building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) buildings. The inventive system provides a simple alternative to the expensive and known light management systems for BIPV that normally forms a part of the building. The innovative system results in saving of a large sum of money in the energy bill of the building. With this system, optimum light can by obtained for the BIPV using semi transparent solar laminates, titled windows and light diffusers in the false roofing. This system is an essential step towards BIPV design.<br>
AN EXAMPLE ON PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION<br>
A BIPV room has been designed and constructed at BHEL-ASSCP, Gurgaon,<br>
 <br>
based on the inventive light management system. The room has been designed to function as a small office such that the solar module laminates generates sufficient power to meet its energy needs. The room is provided with titled windows having solar laminates to get better performance. This BIPV room has most of the green house effect including an efficient lighting arrangement. Semi transparent solar laminates are installed in the roof with light diffusers in the false roofing to provide an uniform natural light in the room. LED based lights are provided in the room, staircase, pathway, etc. with suitable sensor (like, dusk to down switches) in select areas. Light management system maintains a proper lighting in the room during the different seasons, and the room requires minimum electric power to maintain optimum light.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure - 1A shows an isometric view of a BIPV building incorporating the Light Management system of the invention.<br>
Figure - 1B shows a side view of the BIPV building of Figure - 1A.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As shown in figures 1A and 1B, the light management system for the BIPV building works on the principle of allowing appropriate amount of natural sunlight entry in to the building. In the present embodiment, a building (5) has<br>
 <br>
been designed and constructed, by adapting the innovative light management system, which has a combination of opaque and semitransparent solar PV laminates (1) of 70 and 150 watt incorporated in the roof and windows. The solar laminates (1) function as the roof of the building (5) and generates electric power and transmit partial sun light inside the building (5). A plurality of Light diffuser (3) are incorporated in a false ceiling (2) of the building (5). These light diffusers (3) allow the sunlight coming through the solar laminates (1) and spread inside the rooms of the building (5).<br>
The Semi transparent solar laminates (1) are also incorporated on several titled windows in the south side wall of the building (5) to convert the windows as semitransparent windows, which allow natural sunlight inside the building (5), and also generate electric power. The south side of the building (5) is isolated with a glass partition (4). The south side of the partition (4) is enabled to generate green house effect.<br>
LED based lights of 5 W and 12 W using white LEDs have been incorporated at appropriate positions for optimum illumination and are powered through the solar PV laminates (1) installed in the BIPV (5). It has been observed that during the sunny days, the light levels in the building (5) have been quite adequate for office and other skilled work.<br>
 <br>
