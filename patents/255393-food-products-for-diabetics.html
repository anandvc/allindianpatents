				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of functional fds and clinical fds.<br>
More specifically, the present invention provides novel fd products with a<br>
balanced and functional fat content, aimed for the diabetic and diabetic-prone<br>
populations.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
All publications mentioned throughout this application are fully incorporated<br>
herein by reference, including all references cited therein.<br>
Diabetes mellitus Type 2, is a multiple aetiology metabolic disorder,<br>
characterized by chronic hyperglycemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat<br>
and protein metabolism, resulting from a partial or absolute deficiency of<br>
insulin. A deficiency of insulin in the body results in diabetes mellitus.<br>
Diabetes is a common disease and according to the Center for Disease Control<br>
and Prevention (CDC) survey in 22, 6.3% of the American population suffers<br>
from diabetes (21.1% out of the adult population). About 1.3 million new cases<br>
(aged above 2 years) are reported each year and it is estimated that only about<br>
half the people who currently have diabetes are diagnosed.<br>
The effects of diabetes mellitus include long-term damage, dysfunction and<br>
failure of various organs. Often, diabetes symptoms are not as severe; however<br>
long-term hyperglycemia results in cardiovascular disease (CVD, see below),<br>
retinopathy (blindness), nephropathy (renal failure) and/or neuropathy (ft<br>
ulcers, amputation etc.). Accelerated decline of cognitive function and other<br>
brain functions or tissues damage is often induced by or accompanied to diabetes<br>
mellitus.<br>
The metabolic abnormalities in Type 2 diabetes mellitus, which result from<br>
primarily insulin resistance in liver, muscle, and adipose tissues, lead to an<br>
increase in the bled sugar and hyperinsulinemia (high insulin bled level).<br>
Insulin resistance also leads to a disturbance of virtually all the regular<br>
cardiovascular-associated risk factors, bled pressure and lipoproteins in<br>
particular, which will increase atherosclerosis (a process based on fat<br>
metabolism abnormality) incidence. The high insulin levels seen in insulin<br>
resistance may also directly promote the development of atherosclerosis.<br>
Accumulation of fat in the abdominal area, particularly in the visceral fat<br>
compartment, is associated with the development of insulin resistance and<br>
increased risk to display complications such as diabetes mellitus. The<br>
relationship between fatty acid content of triglyceride (TAG), visceral adipose<br>
tissue accumulation, and metabolic components of the insulin resistance<br>
syndrome have been extensively investigated [Tremblay, A. J. et al. (24)<br>
Metabolism 53, 31-317].<br>
The adipose tissue is not simply an energy storage organ but also a secretory<br>
organ. The regulatory substances produced by adipocytes, which include leptin,<br>
resistin, and adiponectin, may contribute to the development of insulin<br>
resistance. Furthermore, the elevated level of free fatty acids occurring in<br>
obesity, had been implicated in the development of insulin resistance [Grundy<br>
SM. (24) J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 89(6):2595-26]&gt;<br>
Diabetes patients are three to five times more likely to have coronary heart<br>
disease (CHD) and stroke than non-diabetic patients. In fact, heart disease is the<br>
leading cause of diabetes-related deaths.<br>
Numerous studies have shown that oxidative stress may also play a major<br>
pathophysiological link between CVD and Type 2 diabetes [Baynes J. W. and<br>
Thorpe S. R. (1999) Diabetes 48:1-9]. Oxidative stress, a relative increase in free<br>
radicals, is a direct consequence of hyperglycemia. Reactive oxygen molecules<br>
created by this metabolic imbalance activate monocytes and maerophages<br>
triggering the proliferation of vascular smth muscle cells and an overall<br>
diabetic angiopathy. One of the main outcomes of this process is the generation<br>
of high levels of oxidized-LDL species, which are taken in by maerophages<br>
through scavenger receptors (and not native LDL receptors), to give rise to foam<br>
cells, the hallmark of early atherosclerosis [Griendling, K.K. and FitzGerald,<br>
GA (23) Circulation 18(17): 234-4].<br>
The dysh'pidemia associated with insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes is<br>
characterized by elevated triglycerides, low levels of HDL cholesterol, an<br>
increase in the proportion of small, dense, and potentially more atherogenic LDL<br>
cholesterol particles. These abnormalities are present for years before diabetes<br>
mellitus is diagnosed clinically. Elevated triglyceride levels, reduced HDL<br>
cholesterol, and increased atherogenic LDL cholesterol levels are all risk factors<br>
forCVD.<br>
Several population based studies have shown that Type 2 diabetes also increases<br>
the risk of dementia. Cognitive decline is an intermediate stage between normal<br>
ageing and dementia. As dementia may be most effectively delayed in its initial<br>
stages, identifying diabetes as a modifiable risk factor for early cognitive decline<br>
could be of major importance. Eecently, a large study focused on elderly women<br>
with Type 2 diabetes described increased odds of pr cognitive function and<br>
substantial cognitive decline in these patients, compared with women without<br>
diabetes [Logroscmo et al, (24) BMJ. 328:548-553].<br>
Fatty acid differences, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been shown<br>
in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients as compared with normal agematched<br>
individuals. Furthermore, low serum DHA is a significant risk factor<br>
for the development of AD. It was recently argued by Muskiet and colleagues<br>
[Muskiet F.A, et al. (24) J Nutr. 134:183-6] that DHA is in fact an essential<br>
fatty acid, also in light of its relation to cognitive functions. Indeed, other<br>
investigators stated that dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids and weekly<br>
consumption offish may reduce the risk of incident Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Diabetes impairs essential fatty acid metabolism by decreasing activities of A6<br>
and A5 desaturases, enzymes that convert dietary linoleic acid and alphalinolenic<br>
acid to long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUPA), including<br>
gamma-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and<br>
DHA. As a result, AA and DHA levels are reduced in membrane phospholipids of<br>
several tissues, including erythrocyte and sciatic nerve. It was demonstrated<br>
recently that dietary supplementation with fish oil, containing EPA and DHA,<br>
partially prevented the diabetes-induced decrease in nerve conduction velocity, a<br>
physiological marker of diabetic neuropathy. This was further correlated hi a<br>
recent report that presented evidence for a marked neuro-protective effect of<br>
DHA on diabetic neuropathy. Furthermore, there are several reports describing<br>
the beneficial effects of fish oil-derived omega-3 fatty acids supplementation on<br>
serum triglycerides, HDL, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes, which<br>
may lead to decreased rate of occurrence of vascular complications and minimize<br>
the cognitive decline in diabetes.<br>
The importance of prevention of diabetes in high-risk individuals is highlighted<br>
by the substantial and worldwide increase in the prevalence of diabetes in recent<br>
years. Genetic susceptibility appears to play a powerful role in the occurrence of<br>
Type 2 diabetes in certain populations. However, given that population gene<br>
pls shift quite slowly, the current epidemic likely reflects marked changes in<br>
lifestyle that are characterized by decreased physical activity and increased<br>
energy consumption. Weight reduction, exercise, and dietary modifications often<br>
correct the hyperglycemia of Type 2 diabetes. Therefore, changes in the<br>
population habits, including nutrition habits, may decrease the risk of<br>
developing diabetes and diabetes complications.<br>
Diabetes patients are first of all treated, mostly through medication, in regard to<br>
their hyperglycemia and glucose control. This is aimed to prevent long-term<br>
complications. As mentioned above, the long-standing elevation of bld glucose<br>
causes chronic complications of diabetes-premature atherosclerosis, retinopathy,<br>
nephropathy, and neuropathy.<br>
In some cases their cardiovascular health is addressed, again mainly through<br>
medications, in regard to their hyperlipidemia, mainly hypercholesterolemia.<br>
little or no treatment is provided for their hypertriglyceridemia. An important<br>
risk factor, associated and even induced with their metabolic disorder is bld<br>
oxidative stress. This risk factor leads to atherosclerosis, and together with<br>
hyperlipidemia, it is one of the main causes of mortality of cardiovascular<br>
disorders among diabetes patients.<br>
Diabetic patients are recommended to modify nutrient intake and lifestyle as<br>
appropriate for the prevention and treatment of obesity, dyslipidemia,<br>
cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and nephropathy. The American Diabetes<br>
Association has recently published goals of medical nutrition therapy aimed to<br>
attain optimal metabolic outcomes including bld glucose, lipid profile and<br>
bld pressure in order to prevent and treat the chronic complications of diabetes<br>
[Franz MJ, Et al, Diabetes Care 25:148-198, 22; American Diabetes<br>
Association Position Statements "Nutrition Principles and Recommendations in<br>
Diabetes " (24]. Nevertheless, diabetics are typically treated only in regard to<br>
glucose control and their hyperglycemia through strict diets. These diets are<br>
mainly designed to lower the amount of dietary glucose to a minimum. In most<br>
cases, these diets are not designed to promote heart health, let alone fight the<br>
main cardiovascular risk factors.<br>
Diabetes patients are offered unique fd products, especially designed to<br>
accommodate their unique dietary requirements in regard to minimal glucose<br>
levels. However, in most cases, these fd products are rich in lipids, and<br>
especially triglycerides, in the form of oils and fats. These fats are added in order<br>
to compensate the lack of glucose and the pr sensorial properties of the<br>
resulting fds. Although this addition indeed yields sensorial desirable fd<br>
articles, they have severe adverse effects on the diabetes patients who should<br>
fear fat-rich products almost as much as glucose-rich products.<br>
Furthermore, due to fd technology reasons, many of the fats and oils used in<br>
fd products for diabetics are actually saturated fats which enhance even more<br>
the risk of the acute cardiovascular disorders of diabetics. Moreover, in many<br>
cases, fd products for diabetics consist of higher levels of fats than their<br>
counterpart, "regular" fd products. This difference in fat levels can reach up to<br>
6% additional fats in diabetics' specialty fds.<br>
Therefore, there is a great need in the market for specialised fd aimed at the<br>
diabetic population, in which all its content, and not only the glucose component,<br>
will be beneficial for said population. It is important to provide diabetics, or<br>
individuals prone to diabetes, with fds wherein the fat content is appropriate<br>
for their needs. Said specialized fd products shall be fat balanced, and its fat<br>
content shall even be beneficial to diabetics or people prone to diabetes.<br>
Furthermore, it will be beneficial if diabetics will be able to consume through<br>
their specialized daily nutrition additional ingredients that may have a<br>
protecting health effect and even a pro-active beneficial health effect, especially<br>
on their cardiovascular condition and/or on different risk factors leading to the<br>
development or progress of CVD.<br>
Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a fd product or article<br>
with low glucose levels or glucose free and a balanced lipid profile, this fd also<br>
comprising at least one diabetes-proactive dietary or pharmaceutical substance,<br>
it does not contain significantly high levels of fats and oils and, most<br>
importantly, comprises minimal amounts of saturated fats, substantially lower<br>
than the amounts currently used in diabetics fds available on the market.<br>
Other uses and objects of the invention will become clear as the description<br>
proceeds.<br>
Despite the understanding of nutrition and medical experts of the specific health<br>
needs of diabetics, especially their cardiovascular needs, and despite the<br>
progress in fd technology that may enable the use of healthier oils and fats<br>
and at smaller amounts, no one has yet combined the three (nutrition, medicine,<br>
fd technology) to yield fds such as presented by the inventors. Furthermore,<br>
no diabetic fd product has introduced a pro-active approach to address such<br>
cardiovascular needs.<br>
Although the cardiovascular health needs of diabetics are perhaps the most<br>
extreme, other populations can consume and benefit from the fd products of<br>
the invention. Such populations also include pre-diabetics which are prone or are<br>
at high risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Prediabetics<br>
may be individuals with high risk to develop Type 2 diabetes in light of<br>
different conditions including genetic background, over-weight, obesity and<br>
especially abdominal obesity, specific ethnicity, previously identified as impaired<br>
fasting glucose (EPG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), hypertension,<br>
dyslipidemia, history of gestational diabetes, as well as elderly individuals.<br>
Several of the risk factors may exist simultaneously, dramatically elevating the<br>
risk to develop a diabetic condition.<br>
Other populations that may benefit from the fd products of the invention are<br>
individuals diagnosed with the metabolic syndrome or Syndrome X, which is<br>
characterized by glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinaemia, dyslipidemia,<br>
hypertension, visceral obesity, hypercoagulability, and proinflammatory state.<br>
All the above mentioned symptoms define a cluster of CVD risk factors.<br>
Similarly, CVD patients, including patients who already suffered a<br>
cardiovascular event, as well as individuals which are at high risk or prone to<br>
develop CVD due to metabolic syndrome, obesity, over weight, hypertension,<br>
dyslipidemia, etc., may benefit. Other populations with different metabolic<br>
disorders may also benefit from the fd products of the invention since most<br>
metabolic disorders may lead to cardiovascular health problems and the<br>
subsequent adverse effects and symptoms. Health conscious populations who<br>
wish to consume balanced diets, especially from a fat content point of view, also<br>
having pro-active effects in the prevention or inhibition of CVD and metabolic<br>
»<br>
disorders, especially diabetes or diabetes-prone subjects may also benefit from<br>
the fd products of the invention.<br>
Recent studies have highlighted the potential for intervention in IGT subjects to<br>
reduce progression to Type 2 diabetes. For example, the Diabetes Prevention<br>
Program in the United States [The Diabetes Prevention Program (1999) Diabetes<br>
Care 22:623-634] had proved that lifestyle intervention (targeting diet and<br>
exercise) over a period of three years, reduced the risk of progressing from IGT<br>
to diabetes by 58%, whereas the oral hypoglycemic drug, metformin, reduced the<br>
risk by only 31% [Larkin, M. (21) Lancet. 358(9281):565]. Another large-scale<br>
study conducted by a Finnish diabetes prevention organization [Sarkkinen E. et<br>
aJ.,(1996) Eur J Clin Nutr 5(9):592-8] proved that non-pharmacological lifestyle<br>
intervention at people with high risk to develop type 2 diabetes prevents or at<br>
least postpones the onset of the disease.<br>
In other studies, it was shown that the approach aimed at high-risk individuals<br>
(for example, those with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)) may not be sufficient in<br>
preventing all the cases of Type 2 diabetes. Data from the UKPDS indicate that<br>
pancreatic p-cell function is already substantially reduced at the time of clinical<br>
diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes [UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Group<br>
(1998) Lancet 352(9131):837-853; U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study Group (1995)<br>
Diabetes 44(11): 1249-1258]. Consequently, therapeutic interventions with<br>
hypoglycemic drugs or with functional/medical nutrition products should be<br>
considered for prevention as well.<br>
Current special fds for diabetics are also being consumed by populations<br>
merely seeking weight loss/control, not necessarily required from a medical or<br>
health risk point of view. These populations mistakenly interpret the no<br>
glucose/sugar labels of such products as being weight loss/control fds in the<br>
sense of low fat and/or low calorie. As mentioned above, most if not all currently<br>
available fd products designed and/or recommended for the diabetic population<br>
actually have higher levels of fat, and even saturated fats, as well as high caloric<br>
content. In many cases, such a specialized fd product has a higher fat content<br>
and/or caloric content than the corresponding "regular" fd product (see<br>
examples). Therefore, populations seeking weight loss/control fds, as described<br>
above, can also benefit from the fd products of the invention which have a<br>
balanced and even low fat content, lower levels of saturated and other unhealthy<br>
fats, as well as optionally including ingredients which can improve<br>
health, as described in the invention.<br>
Surprisingly, the fd products of the invention may also have a preventive<br>
effect in regard to the development of Type 2 diabetes. Consumption of the fd<br>
products, having said balanced fat content, low levels of glucose, and optionally<br>
at least one active ingredient can prevent or inhibit the onset of diabetes. A diet<br>
based on the fd products of the invention or rich with such fd products can<br>
control glucose metabolism and even insulin secretion. Consumption of such a<br>
diet can decrease the propagation of pancreatic P cells deterioration process and<br>
might even lead to a reduction or reversion of insulin resistance. Diets based on<br>
the fd products of the invention may stabilize the glycemic state, control the<br>
insulin secretion, and furthermore reduce the accumulation of visceral fat.<br>
Abdominal fat. accumulation is considered to be the underlying process<br>
accompanies the progression of Type 2 diabetes; therefore reduction of fat<br>
accumulation in the abdomen may prevent or postpone the diabetes onset and<br>
progression.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In view of the pressing demand of the diabetic and diabetic-prone populations for<br>
specialized fd articles which are truly appropriate for their needs, as well as<br>
fin- health solutions addressing their unattended health risk factors, the present<br>
inventors have developed a novel fd product platform.<br>
Thus, in a first aspect, the present invention relates to a fd product or article,<br>
which has a low glucose content or is preferably glucose free, characterized in<br>
that its fat content is balanced, based on small amounts of non saturated oils<br>
and fats, and that it comprises at least one diabetes-proactive dietary or<br>
pharmaceutical substance for addressing health needs of diabetics, including,<br>
conditions leading to diabetes and diabetic complications, or for preventing onset<br>
of diabetes in healthy individuals or individuals prone to diabetes.<br>
A "diabetes-proactive dietary substance" as used herein, is any nutritional or<br>
dietary substance which can be consumed on a daily basis, provided as a day-today<br>
fd supply, without having any adverse effect that may compromise the<br>
health condition of a diabetic individual, aggravate or induce any risk condition<br>
related to diabetes, and does not promote the onset of diabetes in diabetic prone<br>
individuals, and this term also encompasses Pharmaceuticals and drugs.<br>
The "diabetes-proactive dietary product" is characterized by having low or no<br>
glucose content, a balanced fat content, preferably low levels of saturated fats or<br>
any other harmful fats, such as trans fats, together with the proactive<br>
ingredient.<br>
The proactive health benefit is achieved by being capable of improving or<br>
preventing dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, oxidative<br>
stress, high insulin bld levels, abdominal obesity, or other risk factors related<br>
to CYD, usually present in diabetic and diabetes-prone individuals.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the diabetes-proactive dietary substance is a mixture<br>
of phytosterol and/or phytostanol ester(s) (PS-E) with l,3-diglyceride(s) (DAG),<br>
optionally dispersed or dissolved in an edible oil or fat. Some favored mixtures<br>
may combine PS-E(s) and DAG(s), preferably with a higher phytosterols esters<br>
content relatively to DAG.<br>
Furthermore, said fd product may contain pharmaceutical active ingredients<br>
for addressing health needs of diabetics or for preventing onset of diabetes in<br>
healthy individuals or individuals prone to diabetes. In a preferred embodiment<br>
said pharmaceutical active ingredient aims to lower cardiovascular risk factors,<br>
such as dyslipidemia and/or abnormal lipid profile (for example high cholesterol<br>
bld level), frequent in diabetics or diabetic-prone individuals.<br>
Some of the preferred pharmaceutical active ingredients may include, but are<br>
not restricted to, statins, bile acid sequestrants and ezetimibe, which are<br>
effective in lowering LDL amounts by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis,<br>
preventing re-absorption of bile acids or by preventing absorption of dietary and<br>
biliary cholesterol together. Any other drug capable of controlling the lipids<br>
profile or other biomarker associated with cardiovascular diseases may be<br>
considered.<br>
The fd product of the invention contains at least one dietary active ingredient<br>
and/or at least one pharmaceutically active ingredient which may confer an<br>
additive health benefit or alternatively a synergistic health benefit.<br>
Basically, the market and producers of special fds for diabetics concentrate on<br>
fd products which are traditionally rich in sugar or sweet fds, such as<br>
candies, chocolate, ckies, fruit jams, cakes, etc. In these products the emphasis<br>
is on taking out the sugar without taking out the sensorial quality the consumer<br>
expects from such indulgence fds. This again emphasizes how the impact of<br>
nutrition on the diabetics1 health needs, especially those needs which are not<br>
directly related to their insulin resistance is basically overlked and/or ignored.<br>
Thus, it is the purpose of this invention to relate to the full scope of fd products<br>
consumed by individuals and making them more appropriate to consumption by<br>
diabetics or diabetes-prone individuals. In a specific embodiment the invention<br>
relates to fd products which are traditionally produced with high levels of fat,<br>
and especially saturated fat, and do not contain any proactive ingredients to<br>
address the CVD risk factors of diabetics, some of which are thriving because of<br>
pr nutrition. It should be emphasized that many fd products nowadays are<br>
indeed designed with low fat content and even with low caloric values with the<br>
aid of non-sugar carbohydrates, artificial sweeteners, and other fd additives,<br>
in response to the demand for fd products that would not contribute to weight<br>
gain and obesity. Nevertheless, these usually have a high percentage of<br>
saturated fat from the total fat content of the fd product and additionally they<br>
do not proactively contribute to the various health risk factors related to<br>
diabetics or which are more pronounced in diabetes patients or which are more<br>
crucial to pre-diabetics.<br>
By low glucose content as used herein is meant a glucose content of between  up<br>
to 6% glucose, preferably from  up to .5%, most preferably below .1%.<br>
By balanced fat content as used herein is meant is meant a fat or oil content of<br>
less than about 1%. Generally, the fat content of the fd product will, be<br>
similar or preferably lower than the fat content found in the corresponding fd<br>
product, which is not special for the diabetic or pre-diabetic population.<br>
Furthermore, the fat content should be comprised of little or no saturated fats,<br>
preferably less than about 25% of the total fat, more preferably below 1%.<br>
Moreover, the fat component of the diet may particularly comprise<br>
monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids, preferably more than about<br>
2%, more preferably above 3%, even more preferably, above 4% of the total<br>
fatty acid moieties.<br>
Most importantly, the lipid profiles of the fd article of the invention consist of<br>
minimal amounts of saturated fats, and certainly considerably lower than the<br>
amounts currently used in fd articles for diabetics, which are, for example, up<br>
to 5, and even up to 75% of the total fat. This can be achieved through modern<br>
fd technology methodologies and additives that enable to reduce the levels of<br>
saturated fats, usually needed from technical or texture reasons.<br>
The fd products of the invention may include a variety of dietary active<br>
ingredients. Preferably, said ingredients contribute health benefits related to<br>
cardiovascular health or addressing risk factors of CVD in general, are also<br>
considered functionally active in the treatment and/or prevention of CVD in<br>
diabetic or diabetic-prone individuals.<br>
Phytosterol and/or phytostanols are phyto-derivatives of cholesterol clinically<br>
demonstrated to reduce bld cholesterol levels. Although they are structurally<br>
similar to cholesterol, they are not synthesized by the human body; they are very<br>
prly absorbed by the human intestine and tend to decrease the absorption of<br>
both dietary and endogenously derived cholesterol in the intestine.<br>
Phytosterols and/or phytostanols also include a variety of derivatives, such as<br>
fatty acid esters, as well as other ester derivatives. These ingredients have been<br>
shown to confer their health benefits at different daily intake levels. Current<br>
recommendations regarding the supplementation of phytosterols or their<br>
derivatives state an intake of ,8g of phytosterols, and higher levels of the stanol<br>
derivatives. Intake levels of different sterol derivatives are calculated<br>
accordingly. Phytosterols and/or phytostanols are generally produced from<br>
soybean or wd and other sources are available [Law M. (2) BMJ 32;861-<br>
Diglycerides (DAG) are mono-hydrolyzed derivatives of triglycerides, also known<br>
as oils and fats. DAG, mainly 1,3-diglycerides, as compared to TAG, have been<br>
previously shown to lower fasting and postprandial serum TAG concentrations<br>
in humans and in animal model. When consumed in large amounts, DAG lowers<br>
body weight, total fat and abdominal fat stores. Therefore consumption of DAG<br>
should be considered for treating obesity [Tada, N. (24) Curr Opin Clin Nutr<br>
Metab Care 7, 145-149].<br>
DAGs have been marketed as fd products only as cking oil and certainly<br>
were not used in the nutrition of diabetics. DAG have been shown to conifer their<br>
health benefits mainly in cases where they were used to replace most or all of<br>
the daily dietary fat intake of individuals. In most cases, levels above lOg/day<br>
and even higher than 4g/day were used. Much lower levels of DAG have been<br>
shown to confer different CVD related benefits in specific combinations with<br>
fatty acid esters of phytosterols (see below). The fd products of the invention<br>
may indeed utilize DAGs to replace part of their fat content and even up to<br>
replacing the whole fat fraction,<br>
Specific phytosterol esters and DAGs combinations optionally dissolved or<br>
dispersed in oils and/or fats, and their attributes have been described in detail in<br>
co-pending co-owned WO 1/7583 and WO 3/6444 In brief, these<br>
formulations comprise a combination of DAG, mainly l,3-DAG(s) and<br>
phytosterol and/or phytostanol ester(s) (PSE) dissolved or dispersed in an edible<br>
oil and/or fat. Preferably said oil is olive oil, canola oil or fish oil. This<br>
composition has been shown to reduce bld cholesterol and triglycerides levels<br>
and assist in preventing or treating bld oxidative stress, thus inhibiting the<br>
atherosclerosis cascade. Furthermore, this composition has been shown to<br>
maintain and preserve the body's natural defense mechanisms, such as the<br>
paraoxonase 1 (PONl) enzyme, whose activity is dramatically reduced when oils<br>
and fats are consumed in the diet. Moreover, equal amounts of these phytosterolesters<br>
and DAG in fats and oils maintained normal activity levels of PONl in<br>
ApoE° knockout mice (WO 24/6915). These combinations of phytosterol<br>
esters and DAG can be easily used to replace part, most, or all of the fat content<br>
of the fd products of the invention. The level of the phytosterol esters and DAG<br>
combination in each fd item of the invention can be controlled to provide<br>
phytosterol esters levels according to current recommended daily allowances<br>
(EDA) in such a way that, at least, the full RDA can be achieved through the<br>
consumption of several servings of a specific fd product, through the<br>
consumption of a single serving of different fd products all containing the<br>
phytosterol esters/DAG combinations or in a single serving of a specific fd<br>
product.<br>
It has now been surprising found that these combinations are also beneficiary for<br>
diabetics or pre-diabetics, as will be shown in the examples below.<br>
Omega-3 fatty acids, such as alpha-linolenic (18:3) acid and especially<br>
docosahexaenoic acid (22:6, DHA) and eicoeapentaenoic acid (2:5, EPA) have<br>
been shown to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. These fatty acids,<br>
produced from different marine animals and organisms, particularly from cold<br>
water fish, as well as from different microbial and algal sources, have been<br>
shown to lower bld triglycerides levels and render anti-inflammatory,<br>
antithrombotic and immunomodulatory effects.<br>
Omega-3 linolenic acid, such as found in flax seed oil, has also been shown to<br>
have beneficial effects on lowering the risk of MI and fatal ischemic heart<br>
disease in women and in men. Long chain omega-3 fatty acids (DHA, EPA) have<br>
been shown to exert beneficial effects and current recommended intakes are<br>
above 65mg/day and even higher.<br>
The omega-3 fatty acids and especially their long-chain polyunsaturated<br>
members (DHA and EPA) suffer from stability problems in light of their<br>
oxidation sensitivity. The same oxidation problem is also related to organoleptic<br>
problems in which products containing said fatty acid suffer from "fish-like" odor<br>
and taste. Although the algal and microbial omega-3 LC-PUFA have somewhat<br>
enhanced stability and lesser organoleptic problems, these also are not easy to<br>
use in fd products. Recently different methods have been devised to overcome<br>
the above problems. These include encapsulation of the omega-3 fatty acids in<br>
different fd compatible matrices, as well as the use of special purification and<br>
distillation techniques and special antioxidants or antioxidants mixtures. Thus,<br>
the fd products of the invention may be designed to include these beneficial<br>
dietary ingredients at adequate levels in a variety of daily fd products.<br>
Oxidative stress and other adverse effects related to oxidative damage have been<br>
shown to be controlled, at least to some extent, by different dietary ingredients<br>
with an anti-oxidation capacity. These can include plant extracts such as<br>
rosemary extract, lycopene, zeaxanthin, polyphenols (such as hydroxytyrosol<br>
found in olive oil, grapes, pomegranates, etc.), vitamins (tocopherols and<br>
especially vitamin E, ascorbic acid), minerals (Zinc, Selenium or Calcium),<br>
coenzyme Qio and beta carotene. All these ingredients, as well as other antioxidants,<br>
have been extensively investigated and shown to have beneficial effects<br>
on the health of individuals.<br>
These antioxidants have also been used as dietary supplements. A few of these,<br>
especially vitamin E and ascorbic acid derivatives have been used at low levels<br>
(lower than .2%wt) in fds aa fd antioxidants and in some cases at even<br>
higher levels in order to deliver said antioxidants to exert their beneficial<br>
activity on the fd consumers. No attempts have been made to use antioxidants<br>
in specialty diabetic fd products as part of a diabetic functional fd<br>
methodology addressing their CVD health problems, as suggested herein.<br>
A variety of herbal or plant extracts, such as soy proteins, isoflavones,<br>
carotenoids (beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin) and garlic extracts have been<br>
shown to beneficially influence different CVD risk factors such as high bld<br>
cholesterol level, high bld triglycerides level. No attempts have been made to<br>
use such plant extracts in specialty diabetic fd products as part of a diabetic<br>
functional fd methodology addressing their CVD health problems, as<br>
suggested herein.<br>
Other ingredients or combinations of ingredients have also been shown to have<br>
beneficial effects and can be used as dietary ingredients in the fd products of<br>
the invention. For example, a combination of vitamin Be, vitamin Biz, and folic<br>
acid has been shown to lower bld level of homocysteine, high levels of the<br>
latter have been recognized as a CVD risk factor or bio-marker.<br>
Additionally some dietary active ingredients with CVD related benefits have<br>
been shown to act synergistically to further reduce the risk of CVD. Such a<br>
combination includes bld cholesterols lowering ingredient phytosterols and soy<br>
proteins.<br>
In one embodiment of the fd article of the invention, said article is functional<br>
in the treatment and/or prevention of CVD risk factors, such as hyperlipidemia,<br>
which may be hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia, oxidative<br>
stress and atherosclerosis, particularly in diabetic or diabetes-prone individuals.<br>
Thus, the fd article of the invention is geared to offer preventive or therapeutic<br>
health benefits, especially with regards to the cardiovascular health of subjects<br>
suffering from or prone to diabetes. As mentioned above, diabetes-prone subjects<br>
are individuals that fulfill at least one of the following criteria: (a) have a family<br>
history of diabetes mellitus (parents or siblings); (b) are obese; (c) belong to a<br>
race or ethnicity which have a higher incidence of diabetes, for example African<br>
American, Hispanic, Native American, etc.; (d) are 45 years old or older; (e) were<br>
previously identified with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose<br>
tolerance (IGT); (f) have hyperinsulinaemia; (g) have hypertension, Le. bld<br>
pressure above 14/9 mm Hg; (h) have dyslipidemia: HDL lower than 35 mg/dL<br>
and/or triglycerides above 25 mg/dL; (i) have a history of gestational diabetes or<br>
delivery of babies weighting above 4.1 kg.<br>
A subject will be considered diabetic if his fasting plasma glucose is 126 mg/dl or<br>
over. Normal range of fasting plasma glucose is 6 -19 mg/dl.<br>
In another embodiment of the fd article of the invention, said article further<br>
comprises at least one active agent which is functional in the treatment and/or<br>
prevention of CVD risk factors, such as hyperlipidemia including<br>
hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia, metabolic disorders such as<br>
metabolic syndrome and obesity also considered diabetes related risk factors,<br>
oxidative stress and atherosclerosis. Said active agent may replace some or<br>
preferably all the fat constituents of the fd product described in the invention.<br>
The fd product described herein should be considered beneficial to any<br>
condition that renders a subject, especially a diabetic or a per-diabetic<br>
individual, prone to acute CVD.<br>
As herein described, said active agent is any one of phytosterols and/or<br>
phytostanols esters and their derivatives, diglycerides (DAG), combinations of<br>
phytosterol esters and DAG (specifically combinations having phytosterol-esters<br>
levels higher than DAG levels, optionally dissolved or dispersed in an oil and/or<br>
fat), anti-osidants, natural herb and plant extracts (for example garlic extract,<br>
soy protein, soy isoflavones, or lycopene), omega-3 fatty acids, as well as other<br>
dietary ingredients or any combination thereof<br>
The anti-oxidant may include natural or synthetic anti-oxidants, such as<br>
polyphenols, vitamins, especially tocopherols, or minerals, such as zinc and<br>
selenium, known to exert positive and healthy effects on heart-health of the<br>
general population.<br>
In addition, said active agent may include omega-3 lipids, in the form of free<br>
fatty acids, ethyl-esters, triglycerides, phospholipids or any other derivative or<br>
delivery platform, chemical or technical. These lipids have been shown to<br>
positively affect general heart-health indications in the general population as<br>
well as CVD prone population.<br>
As mentioned above, the active ingredients can also be pharmaceutical in<br>
nature, such as statins, bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe, bld diluting agents,<br>
and bld pressure lowering agents.<br>
In one embodiment the active agent comprised in the fd product of the<br>
invention may be any ingredient functional in reducing at least one of the<br>
following parameters: total cholesterol serum level, non-HDL cholesterol serum<br>
level, total cholesterol/HDL ratio and triglycerides serum level in an overweight<br>
and/or obese and/or diabetic subject and/or diabetic-prone subject, as illustrated<br>
in Examples 1 and 2, Figures 16.<br>
High cholesterol in the bld is a major risk factor for heart and bld vessel<br>
diseases such as atherosclerosis and stroke. The term "total cholesterol" relates<br>
to three major kinds of cholesterol: High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), Low<br>
Density Lipoprotein (LDL), and Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL). Bld<br>
total cholesterol values less than 2 mg/dL, and LDL Cholesterol of 1 mg/dL<br>
or less are considered optimal by the National Heart, Lung, and Bld Institute.<br>
Excessive amount of LDL cholesterol in bld is deposited in the arteries,<br>
therefore, LDL level of less than 13mg/dL is recommended and lmg/dL is<br>
considered optimal. LDL amount is commonly estimated by calculating its part<br>
from the total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides results ("LDL Gale") or by a<br>
directly measurement.<br>
HDL cholesterol is considered to be protective against heart disease by helping<br>
removing excess cholesterol deposited in the arteries. High HDL levels are<br>
associated with low incidence of coronary heart disease. Bld values of 35<br>
mg/dL and higher are recommended.<br>
The total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio is a number that is helpful in<br>
predicting atherosclerosis and is validated as a powerful predictor for myocardial<br>
infraction (MI). The number is obtained by dividing total cholesterol by HDL<br>
cholesterol. (High ratios indicate higher risks of heart attacks, low ratios<br>
indicate lower risk). An average ratio is about 4.5 and a preferred ratio would be<br>
2 or 3 or less than 4.<br>
Triglycerides are the major storage form of fat in the body. In some people,<br>
abnormally high bld triglyceride levels (hypertriglyceridemia) are inherited,<br>
but it is often caused by non-genetic factors such as obesity, excessive alcohol<br>
intake, diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, and estrogen containing medications<br>
such as birth control pills.<br>
High levels of triglycerides increase the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) by<br>
speeding up plaque build-up on arteries (atherogenesis) and increasing the risk<br>
for thrombosis, which may lead to myocardial infarction. Desired triglycerides<br>
bld level range from 15-2rng/dL.<br>
High levels of triglycerides should be treated aggressively with, low fat diets and,<br>
if needed, medications. The first step in treating hypertriglyceridemia is a low<br>
fat diet with a limited amount of sweets, regular aerobic exercise, loss of excess<br>
weight, reduction of alcohol consumption, and stopping cigarette smoking. In<br>
patients with diabetes mellitus, meticulous control of elevated bld glucose is<br>
also important. Therefore, the consumption of the nutritional product of the<br>
invention would be considered highly beneficiary.<br>
If necessary, additional pharmaceutical agents such as fibrates (for example<br>
gemfibrozil), nicotinic acid, and statin derivatives can be added to the nutritional<br>
product. Said pharmaceutical agents, also may affect the overall lipid profile:<br>
Lopid not only decreases triglyceride levels but also increases HDL cholesterol<br>
levels and LDL cholesterol particle size; nieotinic acid lowers triglyceride levels,<br>
increases HDL cholesterol levels and the size of LDL cholesterol particles, as<br>
well as lowers the levels of Lp (a) cholesterol; statins are effective in decreasing<br>
triglyceride as well as LDL cholesterol levels and in elevating HDL cholesterol<br>
levels.<br>
The fd product of the invention is also functional in reducing the body weight<br>
and/or the serum insulin level in an obese and/or diabetic subject as illustrated<br>
in Example 2 and Figure 11.<br>
Insulin is a peptide hormone that enables the body to metabolize and utilize<br>
bld glucose by permitting the cells glucose uptake and lowering its<br>
concentration in bld. Inside the cell, glucose is either used for energy or stored<br>
in the form fat. Insulin drives to use more carbohydrate, and less fat, promoting<br>
to fat metabolic imbalance and obesity, considered risk conditions to develop<br>
diabetes and CVD, Therefore, it is desirable to control the bld insulin level<br>
whenever it overpasses normal values. Normal fasting insulin values range 5-2<br>
mcU/mL (micro unit per milliliter).<br>
Particularly, said fd product is functional in ameliorating hyperinsulinemia<br>
(reducing the serum insulin level) in an insulin-resistant subject. High insulin<br>
bld level could be used as an indicator for insulin resistance, one of the main<br>
leading conditions for developing Type 2 diabetes, and usually occurring in<br>
individuals suffering from hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and obesity.<br>
Usually, the glucose/insulin ratio (6/1 ratio) index is used for the diagnosis of<br>
insulin resistance, which low values depict higher degree of insulin resistance. A<br>
desired G/I ratio will be of less than 4.5.<br>
Since the fd product of the invention reduces the serum insulin level,<br>
measurement of the G/I ratio may be used as a simple test for evaluating the<br>
therapeutical effectiveness of the said fd product<br>
In a more particular case, said fd product is effective in ameliorating<br>
hyperinsulinema or preventing progression of insulin resistance in an obese<br>
subject prone to develop diabetes. Physical activity and weight loss help the body<br>
the better respond to insulin and overcome insulin resistance. Body weight<br>
reduction accomplished by consuming the nutritional product of the invention<br>
and being physically active, may prevent the evolution of the insulin resistance<br>
condition into developing Type 2 diabetes.<br>
By changing nutritional habits and lsing weight it is possible to return prediabetic<br>
individuals to normal bld glucose levels and reduced the risk of<br>
diabetes by 58 percent.<br>
In another embodiment, the fd product of the invention is functional in<br>
reducing the body weight, inhibiting body weight gain and reducing insulin<br>
resistance in obese, subjects with metabolic imbalances such as diabetes or<br>
metabolic syndrome, or in an individual prone to develop diabetes or obesity.<br>
Furthermore, these active ingredients may assist to suppress WAT<br>
accumulation, remodel body fat distribution and reduce visceral fat weight, by<br>
shifting fats accumulation, from the visceral tissues to the peripheral tissues,<br>
resulting in prevention or inhibition of metabolic syndromes in obese,<br>
overweight, diabetic, pre-diabetic, or in an individual prone to diabetes or obesty,<br>
or by simply ameliorating diabetic patients' conditions.<br>
Dietary ingredients that address weight gain and management as well as fat<br>
distribution include diglycerides (DAG). Replacement of daily fat intake with<br>
DAG has been shown to promote weight loss. Additionally, conjugated linolenic<br>
acid (CLA) has also been extensively researched and connected to health benefits<br>
related to weight management. Recently, novel triglycerides alkyl substituted at<br>
the alpha position of their fatty acids have been shown to inhibit digestion<br>
Upases and promote satiation feeling resulting in overall weight loss. Such<br>
dietary ingredients, as well as other ingredients addressing weight gain, weight<br>
management and controlling fat distribution are all within the scope of this<br>
invention.<br>
Untreated diabetes might evolve to develop a variety of secondary disease<br>
complications. The fd product of the invention is intended to be use for<br>
reducing the risk of life threatening long term diabetes complications and<br>
ameliorate the deterioration of life quality in an obese and/or diabetic subject.<br>
Diabetes complications are classified in three major categories macrovascular,<br>
microvascular and of neurological origin. People with diabetes usually develop<br>
heart and bld vessel disease. Diabetes carries an increased risk for heart<br>
attack, stroke, and complications related to pr circulation.<br>
Other diabetes complications may include kidney diseases, eye problems that<br>
may lead to blindness, diabetic neuropathy and nerve damage, many different<br>
ft problems resulting from nerve damage or pr bld flow that may conduct<br>
to amputations, skin disorders which sometimes is the first sign that a person<br>
has diabetes, gastroparesis and depression.<br>
Therefore, the fd product of the invention should be considered to be used for<br>
the treatment and/or prevention of any one of the diabetes complications<br>
selected from the group of retinopathy, nephropathy, diseases of the large<br>
vessels supplying the legs (lower extremity arterial disease), coronary heart or<br>
artery diseases, cerebrovascular diseases and disturbed neural function<br>
afflictions, or any other condition which may lead to blindness, end-stage kidney<br>
disease (ESED) and amputations, myocardial infractions, stroke or any other<br>
complication mentioned above.<br>
In an additional embodiment, the fd product of the invention further<br>
comprises active agents, dietary or pharmaceutical ingredients, for addressing<br>
other diabetes related problems. The active agent of said fd product which is<br>
functional in the prevention and/or treatment of acute cognitive decline is any<br>
one of phosphatidylserine, ginko biloba, brahmi (Bacopa monneri), and omega-3<br>
containing fat and said acute cognitive decline may be associated or induced by<br>
diabetes.<br>
Several cognitive related dietary ingredients can be used in the fd products of<br>
the invention. Phosphatidylserine, a major brain phospholipid mainly produced<br>
from soy phospholipids, has been previously and extensively shown to improve<br>
memory and other cognitive functions in the elderly and in younger populations.<br>
Several herbal extracts, such as ginko biloba, have also been claimed to have<br>
similar cognitive benefits. Omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, which both<br>
have been connected to the promotion of heart health, have also benefits on<br>
cognitive functions. Antioxidants are connected to brain health since many<br>
cognitive decline processes are the result of oxidative damage to brain cells and<br>
tissues.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the fd product further comprises<br>
active agents which are functional in the prevention and/or treatment of acute<br>
eye conditions associated with Type 2 diabetes, wherein said active agents are<br>
vitamins, antioxidants, and other natural eye-health promoting ingredients or<br>
extracts.<br>
The amount of the dietary or pharmaceutical ingredients which proactively<br>
promote the health of the heart, brain, and eye, that is in the fd products of<br>
the invention can be based on their specific RDAs or other recommendations of<br>
different organizations or based on the results of related clinical trials. Each<br>
ingredient can be given at its full RDA per serving or alternatively only part of<br>
the RDA can be given in each serving, depending on the variety of fds or<br>
sources available for daily consumption that deliver the same ingredient or the<br>
average number of servings usually consumed from the specific fd product.<br>
The guiding rule of the invention is that the active ingredient could be consumed<br>
at an adequate level to exert its beneficial health effects through one or more<br>
fd products and/or servings, either once a day or through different meals<br>
during the day. At least 5% of the recommended, official or non-official, daily<br>
intake of said ingredients should be provided by the fd products of the<br>
invention.<br>
The active dietary or pharmaceutical ingredients may be added at any stage<br>
during the fd product preparation or processing and either through its major<br>
mass or through fillings, coatings, etc.<br>
The active dietary or pharmaceutical ingredients may also exert technical or<br>
functional properties to the fd product, such as related to texture, stability,<br>
shelf-life, organoleptic and sensorial qualities and appearance.<br>
As described herein, the Ibod product of tibe invention is preferably for use by<br>
any subject either suffering from diabetes or prone to become diabetic. Such fd<br>
articles can be consumed by diabetics, as part of their unique diets, for treating<br>
or addressing their cardiovascular risk factors. Optionally these fds can be<br>
used by pre-diabetic individuals in order to prevent or inhibit the manifestation<br>
of diabetes.<br>

Examples<br>
In vivo experiments<br>
The effect of different dietary functional oils and lipids on CVD was estimated by<br>
measuring some parameters known as CVD risk factors (body and fat weight,<br>
bld lipid levels, glucose and insulin bld levels) in Psammomys obesus, an<br>
experimental animal model for nutrition-dependent type 2 diabetes.<br>
Psammomys obesus, an Israeli sand rat, is a herbaceous gerbil that when<br>
maintained in captivity and given free access to non-purified high energy (HE)<br>
rodent diet tends to display heterogeneous glucose and insulin levels, ranging<br>
from normoglyeemia and normoinsulinemia to obese diabetic animals with<br>
progressive hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. The course of the obesity and<br>
diabetes developed in these animals can be characterized in four phenotypic<br>
states: normoinsulinemia and normoglycemia (State A), hyperinsulinemia but<br>
normoglycemia (State B), hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia (State C), and<br>
hypoinsulinemia and severe hyperglycemia as a result of p-cell degranulation,<br>
and markedly reduced pancreatic insulin content (State D). The Psammomys<br>
obesus gerbil animal model has been shown in numerous studies to be an ideal<br>
natural model of Type 2 diabetes disease in humans because it demonstrates an<br>
increased tendency to develop diet-induced diabetes, which is associated with<br>
moderate obesity. This model has been used also to study the prediabetic state,<br>
in order to determine the development of metabolic changes such as<br>
hyperinsulinemia , hyperglycemia, and obesity, leading to diabetes [Zimmet P.<br>
(21) Nature 414:782-7, review by Ziv E. and Kalman R. (21), In Animal<br>
models of diabetes, eds. Sima and Shafrir, Harwd academic publishers, 327-<br>
342]].<br>
In humans, as well as in the Psammomys obesus model, diabetes is associated<br>
with obesity and nutritional values and characteristics of their diets are of<br>
importance in the onset and evolution of the disease (Shafrir E. and Gutman A.<br>
(1993) JBasic din Physiol Pharmacol 4: 83-99; Kalman R, et al (1993) JBasic<br>
Clin Physiol Pharmacol. 4: 57-68). The selection of the Psammomys obesus as<br>
the present experimental model, contributes to the understanding of the role<br>
that dietary functional oils and lipids play in the development and/or treatment<br>
of obesity and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.<br>
The gerbil experimental model is known to be slightly superior for assessing<br>
bld lipid-lowering effects as compared to hamster models. Rats and mice are<br>
considered inappropriate because their plasma and liver cholesterol is relatively<br>
less responsive to dietary cholesterol challenge. In the Psammomys obesus model<br>
a sequential transition from normal to impaired insulin sensitivity accompanied<br>
by increased adiposity prior to insulin resistance and obesity occurs in a manner<br>
similar to that observed in the human Type 2 diabetes susceptible populations.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
The animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use<br>
Committee of Hebrew University and the Hadassah Medical Organization,<br>
Animals: Male Psammomys obesus gerbils (age 2.-3.5 months) obtained from<br>
Harlan Laboratories Ltd. (Jerusalem, Israel) were grown at the Hebrew<br>
University facilities. After weaning period, Psammomys obesus were maintained<br>
on a low-energy diet containing 2.88 kcal/g (Koffolk Ltd., Petach Tikva, Israel)<br>
prior to diabetes induction.<br>
Experimental model -1<br>
Psammomys obesus were switched to a high energy diet containing 2.93 kcal/g<br>
(Tekled Global, Madison, Wis., USA) for 4 weeks, and the animals that<br>
developed diabetes (~7% of the animals in the Psammomys obesus colony) were<br>
selected for the feeding intervention study. Animals were considered diabetic if<br>
their non-fasting bld glucose was greater than 18 mg/dL.<br>
Diabetic gerbils were randomly assigned to groups (8-1 animals per group) and<br>
fed for another 3.5 weeks with the different high energy experimental diets, as<br>
specified in Table 2. The high fat diets supplied differ in their fat content. Water<br>
and fd were supplied ad libitum; Psammomys obesus bld glucose<br>
concentrations and body weights were monitored every other day. By the end of<br>
the experiment, the gerbils were anesthetized with ketamine (Ketalar; Parke-<br>
Davis &amp; Co., Gwent, United Kingdom) and exsanguinated by cardiac puncture.<br>
Bld samples were collected into an EDTA-wetted syringe and used for<br>
biochemical analyses.<br>
Experimental model - II<br>
Sixty adult male Psammomys obesus gerbils were randomly assigned to 2 high<br>
energy diets containing 2.93 kcal/g (n=3), that differed only in the fats and<br>
lipids content; either Harlan-high energy diet (Tekled Global, Madison, Wis.,<br>
USA) or diet C (Table 2). Water and fd were supplied ad libitum for 4.5 weeks;<br>
body weights and bld glucose concentrations were monitored every other day.<br>
After 4.5 wk of feeding with the experimental diets, gerbils were deprived of fd<br>
overnight (16 h) and anesthetized with ketamine (Ketalar; Parke-Davis &amp; Co.,<br>
Gwent, United Kingdom) and exsanguinated by cardiac puncture, and bld<br>
samples were collected into an EDTA-wetted syringe. The liver and the<br>
epididymis fiat were excised and weighed. Bld taken from the heart was used<br>
for biochemical analyses.<br>
Glucose analysis Bld glucose concentration was determined by the enzymatic<br>
glucose analyzer, Glucometer Elite (Bayer, Elkhart, Indiana., USA) on bld<br>
samples taken from the tail vein.<br>
Lipid analysis Plasma samples obtained from EDTA-treated bld samples<br>
(separated at 12, x g for 15 min) were analyzed for total cholesterol, total<br>
triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol levels by colorimefcric methods (Boehringer<br>
Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). LDL-cholesterol level was calculated using<br>
the Friedewald equation.<br>
Insulin analysis Insulin levels were assessed by radioimmunoassay using a<br>
human primary antibody (Phadesph; Kabi Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala,<br>
Sweden).<br>
Statistical Analysis Data was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance<br>
(ANOVA) to assess the differences among the experimental groups. Differences<br>
between mean values were evaluated by the Student's two tailed i-test.<br>
Nutritional Diets Standard milling procedures were used to incorporate<br>
different treatment oils (custom-made manufactured by Harlan Telded Ltd,<br>
USA) into standard gerbil chow. The 218SC+F high-energy diet was used as a<br>
control (Tekled Global, Madison, Wis., USA),<br>
The composition of the custom-made diets was similar with respect to the fd<br>
and nutrient content. All diets were made from the same basal mix while the<br>
variable component was the supplemented fats. This basal mix was a slightly<br>
concentrated version of 218SO+F without a fat source. When the fat source and<br>
cholesterol were added, the finished products were very similar to the original<br>
218SC+F, with the exception of the fat and cholesterol components.<br>
Diets were prepared according to the scheme below:<br>
1. HSFA= Highly enriched with saturated fatty acids oil<br>
2. HMUFA= Highly enriched with mono-unaturated fatty acids oil, i.e.<br>
HOSO<br>
3. Contain 2% (w/w) plant sterols esterified to indicated base oil<br>
derived fatty acids and 15% (w/w) dietary diacylglycerol presenting<br>
similar fatty acids composition as base oil<br>
4 Dietary plant sterol to cholesterol ratio of 5:1<br>
37<br>
Example 1 - Effect of mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acid diets on diabetic<br>
gerbils' bld lipids content<br>
The present experiment studies the effect of consumption of Diet A (PS-E +<br>
DAG, comprising soy sterols esters with HOSO oil (PS-E) and diacylglycerols<br>
derived from HOSO oil (DAG)) and Diet B (PS-E + DAG, comprising soy sterol<br>
esters with flaxseed oil (PS-E) and diacylglycerols derived from flax seed oil<br>
(DAG), having high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids) on the profiles of<br>
plasma lipids.<br>
Diabetic male Psammomys obesus gerbils were assigned randomly to the<br>
indicated diet groups (8-1 gerbils each) for 3.5 weeks feeding period (as<br>
presented in Table 1 and Table 2). By the end of the experimental feeding period,<br>
bld samples were collected for plasma lipids analyses.<br>
The total cholesterol plasma level in the different diet groups significantly varied<br>
as illustrated in Figure 1. A striking difference can be observed among the<br>
controls and the diet-treated groups (diets A and B), yet all animals maintained<br>
similar basal levels of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia symptoms. Diabetic<br>
HMUFA-fed and HSFA-fed Psammomys obesus showed similar total cholesterol<br>
concentrations in plasma (P-value=.24), while the other Psammomys obesus<br>
groups which were fed with diet A and diet B had a substantial and significant<br>
reduction in the levels of total cholesterol (35% and 42%, respectively; Pvalue=<br>
.31, .28) relative to saturated fat fed gerbils.<br>
The high statistical significance of these results (shown by ANOVA, Pvalue=<br>
.3) suggest that both preparations A and B, induce a very potent<br>
hypocholesterolemic effect. Similar results (~43% reduction) of plasma total<br>
cholesterol reduction were reported for male Mongolian gerbils (Meriones<br>
unquiculatus) frequently fed with 6:1 phytosterol to dietary cholesterol for four<br>
weeks [Hayes et al. (22) J. Nutr. 132:19834988].<br>
38<br>
Similarly, as shown in Figure 2, consumption of either diet A or diet B induced a<br>
remarkable and significant reduction in the level of plasma non-HDL cholesterol<br>
(47% and 59%, respectively; P-value=,22, .19) relatively to diabetic gerbils<br>
fed with HSFA diet. In the HSFA and HMUFA diet consumption groups<br>
(controls), similar non-HDL cholesterol concentrations were measured (Pvalue=<br>
.22). ANOVA comparison between these diets matrices suggested a<br>
highly significant difference (P-value=O.OQl).<br>
Non-HDL-C serum level is considered a strong predictor of future risk for<br>
cardiovascular comph'cation among patients which not necessarily exhibit any<br>
vascular disease symptom. Non-HDL-C was recently recommended by the<br>
National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel IH as a<br>
secondary treatment target (after LDL-C) in patients with elevated triglycerides.<br>
Both Figure 1 and Figure 2 highlight the prominent hypocholesterolemic effect<br>
of either preparation A or preparation B of the invention inasmuch as both<br>
resulted in reduced total and non-HDL cholesterol plasma levels; in comparison<br>
to consumption of diets based on either saturated fatty acids or high oleic<br>
sunflower oils. Contrarily, no significant difference was observed in the plasma<br>
HDLrcholesterol level of any of the gerbils tested groups (ANOVA P-Value=.11).<br>
The calculated total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ratio (Total/HDL) illustrated<br>
in Figure 3 and further statistically analyzed (ANOVA P=.5) showed a<br>
significant difference between the different dietary treatment groups. The<br>
Total/HDL ratio in the HMUFA diet consumption group was comparable to the<br>
ratio seen in the HSFA-fed obese diabetic Psammomys obesus (P-value=.14). In<br>
spite of these results, when diet A or diet B of the invention were provided to<br>
these sand rats, a remarkable and significant decreased (23%; P-Value.12,<br>
and 27%; P-Value.7) in the Total/HDL cholesterol ratio was measured<br>
relatively to the control group (HSFA-fed group).<br>
39<br>
In Type 2 diabetic patients dyslipideraia is manifested by elevated triglycerides<br>
level and reduced HDL cholesterol level. Usually, the LDL cholesterol amount<br>
does not significantly differ in Type 2 diabetic patients and non-diabetic<br>
individuals, but some LDL appears as a denser particle form (apolipoprotein B)<br>
which may increase the atherogenic risk despite the total and LDL cholesterol<br>
normal values.<br>
In some cases, diabetic patients may have elevated levels of non-HDL cholesterol<br>
(LDL plus VLDL cholesterol). The ability of the nutritional components of diets<br>
A and B to reduce the non-HDL level in such a short period of time is of major<br>
relevance in reducing the risk, preventing and treating CVD. The use of the A<br>
and B fd diet matrices should be considered as highly beneficial for<br>
dyslipidemia and LDL-cholesterol related atherogenicity treatment, together or<br>
independently of other conventional pharmaceutical drug treatments.<br>
The dietary treatment of obese diabetic Psammomys obesus either with diet A<br>
(soy sterols esterified to long chain monounsaturated fatty acids in a<br>
diacylglycerol HOSO matrix) or diet B (soy sterols esterified to long chain<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acids in a diacylglycerol flax seed oil matrix) resulted in a<br>
significant reduction of the total cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol values,<br>
despite said diets were supplemented with cholesterol. These results reveal a<br>
new non-pharmaceutical, non-synthetic ajnd not-needing physical intervention<br>
tactic for changing the body lipid management in a short period of time, by a<br>
simple nutritional habit adjustment which could be of benefit to any diabetic,<br>
obese, or subject at risk of developing any high cholesterol-related complication.<br>
The success efficiency of the nutritional product of the invention is based on the<br>
its special composition of low or glucose free content, balance fat content and the<br>
addition of a proactive agent (pharmaceutical or nutritional) for addressing the<br>
needs of diabetics or diabetic-prone individuals. Although, each one of the<br>
separated components may have some mild influence on the lipid profile, the<br>
synergistic activity of the components, as well as their relative ratios in the fd<br>
4<br>
product of the present invention are the reasons for making this product so<br>
effective in the treatment of lipid imbalanced conditions associated with<br>
diabetes.<br>
Example 2 Effect of monounsaturated fatty acids diet on "pre-diabetic" gerbils<br>
Pre-diabetic individuals may exhibit high total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and<br>
triglycerides levels but low HDL cholesterol level as compared to non-diabetic<br>
individuals. This experiment comes to evaluate the effect of diet C, a cholesterol<br>
free diet, on the lipids bld level and lipids management in diabetic prone<br>
gerbils.<br>
Sixty adult male Psammomys obesus gerbils were randomly assigned to two<br>
different high energy diets (n=3), which contained 2.93 kcal/g and only differed<br>
in their fat and lipids content. The effect of diet C (Table 2) was compared to the<br>
effect of the basic Harlan-high energy diet (Tekled Global, Madison, Wis., USA).<br>
After 4.5 weeks of experimental diet feeding, the gerbils were deprived of fd<br>
overnight (16 h) and sacrificed. The liver and epididymal fat were harvested and<br>
weighed. Collected bld samples were used for biochemical analyses.<br>
The effect of diet G on the development of obesity and diabetes in Psammomys<br>
obesus (an experimental model of nutritionally induced diabetes type 2), was<br>
compared to the rodent standard high energy (HE) diet<br>
According to pervious publications [Ziv and Kalman (21), in Animal Models of<br>
Diabetes, eds. Sima and Shafrir, Harwd academic publishers, 327-342;<br>
Kalman R. et at (1993) J Basic Clin Physiol Pharmacol. 4: 57-68],<br>
hyperglycemia is developed relatively fast, within 7-14 days of HE diet intake.<br>
Usually, gerbils will die after 4-7 days of HE diet, as consequence of p-cell<br>
function loss (phase D). In our study, by the end of the feeding period there was<br>
a slightly lower percentage, however typical, of diabetic animals in the diet C-fed<br>
41<br>
group (73.3%) compared with HE diet (8.%). This indication was further<br>
correlated with higher survival rate of the Psamrnomys obesus that consumed<br>
diet C (97%), whereas gerbils consecutively fed with HE diet demonstrated a<br>
somewhat lower survival rate (87%) by the day the animals were sacrificed, 4.5<br>
weeks after the beginning of the feeding experiment.<br>
Consumption of diet C induced a major reduction of the total cholesterol level,<br>
compared with HE diet (23% decrease with P-value=.55 as seen in Figure 4). A<br>
more prominent and statistically significant reduction was observed in the non-<br>
HDL cholesterol level (41% decrease with P-value=.26 as seen in Figure 5).<br>
A small though highly significant reduction in the total cholesterol/HDL ratio<br>
was observed among gerbils fed with diet C ae compared to HE fed gerbils (7%<br>
decrease with P-value=.12 as seen in Figure 6). This diminution could not be<br>
attributed to a parallel reduction in the HDL cholesterol level, since only a mild<br>
tendency was perceived when these two diets were compared (P-value=.1).<br>
As both diet C and HE contained no dietary cholesterol supplementation, it can<br>
be concluded that the efficacy of specialty fd products containing proactive<br>
ingredients such as preparation A (see Example 17) is manifested by actually<br>
lowering total cholesterol both dietary and endogenous cholesterol, and<br>
especially LDL-cholesteroI.<br>
The dietary diacylglycerol content in diet C had no effect on the gerbils'<br>
triglycerides plasma level, as it was expected accordingly to previous reports<br>
[Murase et al (21) J. Lipid Res. 42:372-378; Murase et al. (22) J. Lipid Res.<br>
43:1312-1319].<br>
Obesity and the metabolic disorder, which are recognized as risk factors for noninsulin<br>
dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and insulin resistance<br>
(Matsuzawa et al. (1995) Ann N Y Acad Sci 748:399-46], are identified as being<br>
the outcome of a disequilibrium between energy uptake and energy expenditure.<br>
42<br>
Increased body fat mass is frequently accompanied by elevated circulating free<br>
fatty acids, insulin, tumor necrosis factor-a, and leptin, suggesting that these<br>
molecules may play important roles in the development of insulin resistance in<br>
obese individuals. In order to elucidate the connection between obesity and<br>
insulin resistance some of the following anthropometric parameters were<br>
evaluated.<br>
Consumption of diet C resulted in a marked reduced endpoint bodyweight as<br>
compared to HE fed gerbfls (8,3% decrease with P-value=.11 as seen in Figure<br>
7). Also, the epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) weight, but not the liver<br>
weight (P-value=.41), was remarkably reduced in diet C fed gerbils as compared<br>
to the HE control group (2% decrease with P-value=.11 as seen in Figure 8).<br>
A highly significant correlation of reduced relative size of organs expressed by<br>
the epididymal WAT to liver weight ratio is illustrated in Figure 9 (21%<br>
decrease, P-value=.25).<br>
According to these results, it can be concluded that fd products of the<br>
invention containing proactive ingredients such as preparation A not only affect<br>
the serum lipid profile but are also involved in the body fat accumulation and<br>
distribution.<br>
Diet C showed a significant effect on fasting plasma insulin levels as compared<br>
to the control HE group (42% decrease with P-value=.6 as seen in Figure<br>
1). Under fasting conditions, Psammomys obesus revealed a less pronounced<br>
hyperinsulinemia though the overall hyperglycemia remained similar (Pvalue=<br>
.26).<br>
As expressed in Figures 11 and 12, gerbils fed with diet C presented a lower<br>
serum insulin/bodyweight index and a lower serum insulin/bld glucose level<br>
index as compared to HE fed gerbils. Therefore, for similar bodyweight or<br>
glucose level, animals fed with diet C showed a lower plasma insulin level (88%<br>
decrease with P-value=O.l5 and 49% decrease with P-value=,15<br>
respectively).<br>
The importance of the fasting insulin reduction should be lked in the context<br>
of reduced fat tissue accumulation and combined roll in insulin resistance<br>
propagation. The capacity of diet C and correspondingly fd products containing<br>
preparation A to invert the metabolic unbalanced situation, has proven its<br>
beneficiary effects and effectiveness which should be applied for the prevention<br>
and treatment of diabetes-prone individuals, diabetic patients at different stages<br>
and other individuals suffering from other lipid unbalanced afflictions.<br>
The proposed simple care which can be achieved by the use of the fd products<br>
of the invention, such as products containing preparation A, is expected to be of<br>
great profit for inflicted individuals, since its beneficiary results are evident<br>
after a relatively short period.<br>
