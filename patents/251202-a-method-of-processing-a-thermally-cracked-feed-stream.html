				<td>The present invention relates to a method of processing a thermally cracked feed stream.<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the production of olefins and particularly to processing the cracking heater effluent to more effectively recover the product and process the by-products.<br>
In   the    production    of   ethylene    and    propylene   through   the pyrolysis    of    a    variety    of    feedstocks,    several    byproducts    and unsaturated  diolefins   and  acetylenes   are   created.     The  net  effluent from;   the   pyrolysis   heaters,    typically   referred   to    as   charge   gas, requires processing for the separation of the byproducts and removal of  the   diolefins   and   acetylenes   from   the   primary   olefin   products. Removal   of  the   C2   and   heavfer -diolefins   and   acetyienics  from  the cracked   gas   is   handled   through   a   combination   of   separation   via distillation and reaction via hydrcgenation.    Specifically for acetylene, separation   alone   would   result   in   excessive   loss   of   the   ethylene product   since    acetylene   and   ethylene   have   very   similar   relative volatility.    Currently., the distillation and hydrogenaticn taKe place  in several   distinct   process   steps   that   are   designed   to   separate   and hydrogenate     the     C2,     C3,     and    O     compounds     independently. Separation   of   the   different   hydrocarbons   before   hydrogenation   is currently required for achieving better control over the hydrogenation, prolonging catalyst life, and enhancing performance.<br>
One disadvantage of this, widely practiced conventional technology is the large energy consumption necessary to generate the high pressures and cryogenic temperatures required to separate first the hydrogen from the cracked gas and then subsequently the molecules of higher carbon number.    Additionally, the hydrogenation<br>
steps for each of the hydrocarbon groups require an independent reactor system consisting of several pieces of equipment driving up the capital investment and complexity of the plant.<br>
The invention outlined in the previous U.S.  Patent 5,679,241 proposes   the   one-step   conversion   of   all   C2   to   cb   and   heavier acetylenes and dienes without hydrogenation of the C2 or Cj olefins. It  is claimed  that this is possible with one catalytic distillation  unit capable of treating the hot, relatively low pressure charge gas before excessive   compression   and   cryogenic   cooling   is   performed.       In addition, if desired, this same one step process claims to be capable of hydrogenating the Co olefins to paraffins again without the loss of C2 or C3 olefins. The patent relates to a system that is described as being  capable  of  removing  70%   and  more  of the  hydrogen  in  the cracked   gas   prior   to   the   required   cryogenic   separation   by   the hydrogenation of the C2 to C4 acetylenes and dienes and the Ci and heavier   olefins   to   paraffins.      Removal   of   70%   or   more   of   the hydrogen improves the economicS'.through a significant lowering of the   energy   requirements   for   separation   of   the   C2   and   heavier components.   By reducing the hydrogen partial pressure, separation is achieved    at    lower    pressures    and    with    reduced    refrigeration. However, it has been shown that such extensive hydrogenation in a single step system cannot occur without substantial loss of ethylene and propylene to paraffins by hydrogenation.<br>
The  process  as  described  in  USP  5,679,241   has   significant limitations.   First,   in   the   operation   of   an   ethylene   plant,   the   C2 acetylene specifically must be  removed  via  hydrogenation  since  its removal   via   distillation   is   extremely   difficult   requiring    extensive equipment  and   energy  costs.     Since   acetylene  is  a  polymerization catalyst poison, it must be removed to low levels, often less than 1-2 ppm.   The ability to hydrogenate all of the C2 acetylene to that level in  a  single catalytic distillation column while observing  no  ethylene loss   or   preferably   a   gain   was   not  possible   at  reasonable   catalyst<br>
volumes   and   commercially   viable   operating   conditions.      Second, maintaining  performance  of the  process  during  either  a variation  in carbon  monoxide flow,  which  impacts catalyst  activity,   and/or the concentration of diene/acetylene in the feed was hard to manage and would prove difficult to achieve at commercial scale.   Third, methods of handling eventual catalyst deactivation were limited.'Since these units must operate for long periods of time between shutdowns, the only options were excessive catalyst or separate catalyst zones in the reaction column that can be isolated and the catalyst replaced while the other section remains in operation.    When using larger catalyst volumes,   it   is   known   that   it   is   necessary   to   operate   at   lower temperatures to avoid over-reaction while the catalyst is still active. This negatively impacts the economics by requiring some refrigeration to control operation at lower temperature and/or excessive recycles of cool liquid within the column.   Specifically pilot testing has shown that:<br>
a.	When    the    single    catalytic    distillation    column    was<br>
operated   to   remove   greater   than    95%    of   the    €2<br>
acetylene, the concurrent ethylene loss was above  1 %<br>
by weight.   This is undesirable economically.<br>
b.	When operating a single catalytic distillation column,  if<br>
the  hydrogenation  of  C4  olefins  is  greater  than   20%,<br>
significant ethylene loss is to be expected with presently<br>
available catalysts.<br>
c. in order to achieve minimal ethylene and propylene losses while operating a single catalytic distillation column and maintaining extremely high conversions and hydrogen removals, the design required excessive catalyst as evidenced by low productivity and operation at cooler temperatures requiring refrigeration.<br>
d.	A significant variation in catalyst activity will occur with<br>
variations  in the  carbon  monoxide  in the  feed.     Such<br>
variations if seen in a single step process, will result in<br>
loss   of   acetylene   removal   efficiency   and   subsequent<br>
products which do not meet specification.    This impact<br>
on performance due to the loss of catalytic activity via<br>
CO poisoning is equivalent to the impact on performance<br>
due to catalyst aging.<br>
e.	A   significant   variation   in   feedstock   to   the   ethylene<br>
cracking   heaters   will   result   in   substantial   changes   in<br>
both the acetylenes and dienes as well as the hydrogen<br>
flow.   As the ratio of hydrogen to reactants changes, a<br>
single  step  process  has  limited   ability   to   follow   such<br>
changes.    The  results  will  be  either a  breakthrough  of<br>
acetylene leading to offspec ethylene product or a high<br>
loss  of valuable   ethylene   and   propylene  due  to   over-<br>
reaction,     unless    th'e    system    has     substantial     and<br>
expensive    overdesign    which    could     be     utilized    to<br>
surmount these process changes.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the processing of the charge gas effluent from the pyrolysis of a variety of  feedstocks.    The primary objective is still to remove a significant fraction of the hydrogen in the effluent by hydrogenating the C2 to cg diolefins and acetylenes in the feed while achieving essentially total hydrogenation of the C2 acetylene without significant hydrogenation of  the  ethylene  and   propylene.     In  the  improved   process,  this  is achieved     even     with     disturbances     in     the     carbon     monoxide concentration, varying diene and acetylenic feed concentrations and catalyst deactivation as well as other foreseeable processing upsets. The   invention   relates   to   catalytic   distillation   with   improved   liquid<br>
recycle in combination with fixed bed hydrogenation reactor systems. Specifically,  the operating  conditions of the catalytic distillation  are maintained or adjusted to obtain the maximum hydrogenation of the acetylenes and dienes but without any loss of ethylene and propylene and preferably with an ethylene gain by C2 acetylene hydrogenation. Maintaining a stable high conversion of all of the C2 to Cb acetylenes and dienes with  100% conversion of the C2 acetylene (still without hydrogenating  the   ethylene   and   propylene)   under  varying   process conditions is made possible by the fixed bed hydrogenation system in which the remaining C2 acetylene is completely hydrogenated  again without significant ethylene or propylene hydrogenation.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
For a better understanding of the present invention, the prior art as represented by the process disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,679,241<br>
will  be  briefly described.    Figure   1   of the drawings of the  present invention  is  essentially a copy of a drawing  from that prior patent simplified   to   identify  only  those  features  relevant  to  the   present invention.      The   charge   gas   150   is   compressed   and   fed   to   the catalytic  distillation  column   156.     This   column,   as  in  the   present invention,    simultaneously    carries    out    a    catalytic    reaction    and distillation.    The column has a stripping section  1 58 below the feed and a rectifying/reaction section  160 above the feed containing the catalyst beds 166, 168 and 170.   Descending liquid is withdrawn as sidestreams through the intercondensers 180 and reinjected back into the column over the next lower catalyst bed.   A portion of the heat of reaction is removed by these'intercondensers.    A liquid recycle stream  260  from the  stripping   section  is  recycled  to  the  column overhead.    This recycle 260 may be a portion 262  of  the bottoms and/or a portion 264 from within the stripping section.<br>
The overhead from column 156 passes into condensers 186 and 1 80 and the partially condensed stream enters separation vessel 1 90. The product C2 to Cs vapor overhead 1 94, containing ethylene and propylene, then passes out to subsequent separation while the condensed hydrocarbons are utilized as reflux 196 for the column. Since the objective of the invention is to completely remove the acetylene impurities from ethylene with no loss of the ethylene entering the column, this must be accomplished in this single step operation (one catalytic distillation column). The overhead vapor stream passes into additional fractionation (not shown) where the individual carbon number fractions are isolated.<br>
The hydrogenation in catalytic distillation column 1 56 occurs in the liquid phase. The column is operated such that liquid phase composition is primarily Cs components. This minimizes the liquid phase concentration of the 'ethylene and propylene and thus minimizes their reaction. However, the concentration of these two valuable plefins in the liquid will not be zero. The C2 acetylenes and<br>
the gj acetylenes and diolefins are more reactive than their olefin counterpart. In the liquid phase, these are preferentially reacted to ethylene and propylene respectively. However, as the reaction moves to completion close to the desired 100% C2 acetylene conversion, there is no longer a significant concentration of more reactive C2 acetylene present in the liquid phase. Under these conditions, ethylene can react to form ethane (paraffin). This is the point where ethylene loss occurs.<br>
There are several options for reducing the reactivity in the catalyst beds of this upper portion of the catalytic distillation column. One option is to reduce the temperature. Reducing the temperature in one section is difficult in a single column concept because the distillation temperature is primarily controlled by the column pressure. To do this, a second column operating at a lower pressure would be required. A second option is to utilize a different catalyst in this upper section. This catalyst would be designed to more selectively . hydrogenate acetylenes and diolefins. Both of these options would however require higher volumes of catalyst within the column and thus increase the column size and cost. A third option is to utilize an intercooler as shown on the prior art.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2 that illustrates one embodiment of the  present  invention,  the  charge  gas   10  is  compressed   at   12  to between 150 and 250 psig and then fed to the catalytic distillation column 14.   The charge gas may or may not be preheated to match column temperatures.  The charge gas would typically  pass through one or more guard beds  15 to  remove such poisons as lead  (Pb), arsenic  (As)  and mercury (Hg).    These  are known catalyst  poisons and the guard beds would be employed in a known manner to protect the   catalytic   distillation   catalyst.   Entering   the   catalytic   distillation column,  the  8%  to  20%   by 'Weight  diene   and   acetylenic   feed  is hydrogenated in catalyst beds 16 and 18 located in the rectification section 20 of the column.   The catalytic beds could be of the same or<br>
different     catalytic     composition.	The     catalysts     are     known<br>
hydrogenation  catalysts  consisting  primarily  of  one  or  more   Group VIIIA  metals (Ni,  Pd, Pt) on a support.    Additives such as Ag or Au and/or   alkali   metals   are   typically   used   to   control   selectivity   and activity.      Specific   examples   of   selective   hydrogenation   catalysts particularly   suited   for   this   service   are   disclosed   in   U.S.   Patents 6,417,136;   5,587,348;   5,698,752  and   6,127,588.     The  catalytic systems  used  within   a  catalytic  distillation  column  can  consist  of either  a  single catalyst,  a catalyst with different  metal  loadings to adjust activity located in different portions of the column, or mixtures of  catalysts  of different metals located in different portions  of the column.    The hydrogenation occurs in the liquid phase in catalytic distillation fashion.   Although only two reactive catalytic beds 1 6 and 18   are  shown,  this  is  only  by   way  of  example   and  could   be   any number of beds depending on the requirements of any particular plant or  the   desire  to   adjust   catalyst   activity  through  the   use   of   more complex catalyst systems.   Fractio'nation internals 22 and 24, which may be trays or packing, are provided in the rectification section 20. Additional   fractionation   internals   could   be   located   between   the catalyst    beds    16   and    18.    The   stripping   section    26   contains fractionation internals 28.<br>
The overhead 42 from the column is cooled in the overhead condenser 44 with cooling water or with refrigeration as needed and the  resulting vapor and  liquid  are  separated  in the  reflux drum  46. The resulting liquid from reflux drum 46 is fed through line 48 back into the column as reflux.   Similar to the prior art, the overhead vapor 50 contains most of the cb and lighter compounds while the liquid phase   48   is   used  to   reflux  the  column.     The  vapor  overhead   50 however does not pass into subsequent fractionation but into a fixed bed reactor system consisting of one or more beds of catalyst with provision for heating and/or cooling the vapor feed.    Overhead 50 is first exchanged against final fixed bed reactor system effluent 74 to<br>
recover heat.  It then passes to heater 66 where the temperature of the  vapor  entering the first fixed  bed  reactor 68  is  controlled.     In reactor 68, some portion of the C2 acetylene as well as some portion of the Ca and heavier acetylenes and dienes that were not converted in the catalytic distillation column are hydrogenated.    The conditions and the number of fixed bed -reactors employed are such that the C2 acetylene  is  completely  removed  from   effluent  stream   74  with   no loss   of   ethylene   and   propylene   over  the   entire   system   (catalytic distillation plus fixed bed reactors).    The addition of the fixed bed reactor   system    to   the    catalytic    distillation    column    dramatically increases both the performance of the entire system and the ability of that    system    to    respond    to    process    variations    and    catalyst deactivation.<br>
The operating criteria for the rectification section of the catalytic distillation column is that conditions be created wherein the unsaturated hydrocarbons are hydrogenated to the extent possible without any hydrogenation .of. ethylene and propylene. This is accomplished by:<br>
Operating the column such that ethylene and propylene in the<br>
liquid phase is minimized, and<br>
Operating the catalytic distillation column such that there  are<br>
still unconverted Ci to Cs acetylenes and diolefins remaining in<br>
column overhead 50.<br>
In the catalytic distillation operation of the present invention, the distillation function is designed and operated to distill essentially all of the Co and lighter components as overhead and essentially all of the  Ce  and   heavier  components  as. bottoms.     Alternately,  the   split could be at the C-i carbon number where essentially all of the C4 and lighter components go overhead and the C5 and heavier components leave   as   bottoms.      In   order • to   selectively   hydrogenate   the   C2 acetylenes,   the  Ca  acetylenes  and  dienes,   and  the   Co   and   heavier acetylenes,    dienes    and    olefins    while    leaving    the    ethylene    and<br>
propylene un-hydrogenated, the rectification section 20 is operated such that there Is a substantial concentration gradient of C and.Cs materials relative to C2 and Cs materials in the liquid phase where the majority of the hydrogenation reaction occurs. This can be controlled by variation of reboiler duty and reflux rate to achieve the desired overhead and bottoms composition.<br>
The choice of operation of the catalytic distillation column as either a depentanizer or a debutanizer will be a function of both the composition of the feed and the desired hydrogenation requirements for the products. The preferred operating conditions for a depentanizer will be a pressure of between 75 and 350 psig and a catalyst bed temperature between 50 and 150 C. Similarly, the preferred operating conditions for a debutanizer column will be a pressure between 100 and 400 psig and a catalyst bed temperature between 30 and 130 C.<br>
In    addition    to    controlling    the    overall    fractionation,    the . temperature and composition profiles over the reactive sections can be controlled by adjusting the rates of heat removal over the column and by recirculation of liquid within and/or around the catalyst beds. As shown in Figure 2, trays 30 and 31  collect the descending liquid which is withdrawn as side streams 32 and 34.   These streams may or  may not pass through the  intercoolers  36  and  38  and  then  be reinjected back into the column through the distribution headers 40. This permits a portion of the heat of reaction to be removed in the intercoolers.   By arranging the intercoolers in this fashion, the cooling medium can be water while the cooling in the overhead condensers may need to be at least partly provided by mechanical refrigeration. Hence, the use of the intercoolers can significantly reduce the portion of the heat of reaction which needs to  be removed by mechanical refrigeration.<br>
The hydrogenation in the column 14 occurs in the liquid phase. The extent of the reaction is dependent upon the relative reactivity of<br>
the various components and the concentration of these components in the liquid phase at any particular point in the column.    The C2 and cd  acetylenes  and  dienes  are  far  more  reactive  than   ethylene  and propylene so that they react first and rapidly.    However, the relative reactivities  of  ethylene,   propylene  and  the  C^  and   heavier  olefins, dienes and acetylenes are very close.    In order to react a significant quantity of the Ci and heavier olefins, dienes and acetylenes without any significant loss of ethyiene and propylene, the concentration of the ethylene and propylene in the liquid phase must be minimized and the concentration and temperature profiles from top to bottom must be   controlled.     Since  this   stage  of  the  hydrogenation  occurs   in   a fractionation column, this control can be accomplished by adjusting the overhead reflux produced by the overhead condenser 44 and the side   stream   reflux   from   the   intercoolers   36   and   38.      The   liquid compositions   of   ethylene   and   propylene   can   be   kept   low   in   the reactive   zones  through   increases   in  the   flow   of  reflux   48   and/or . increased interbed cooling at 36 'and 38.<br>
in the catalytic distillation unit 14, the recycle and pumparound circuits have been modified from the prior art as illustrated in Figure 1.     That  prior  art   shows   simple   intercoolers   180   and   an   overall pumparound   line   260.      In   the   present   invention,   the   system   is modified to provide the flexibility to have both uncooled and cooled pumparounds in the catalyst zones 1 6 and 1 8 within the rectification section 20.    This improvement permits the desired temperature  and composition    control    with    minimal    disturbance    to    the    overall distillation.    This is accomplished by drawing off pumparound  liquid immediately below the catalyst beds.as stream 52 and/or 54 from withdrawal points 53 and 31 respectively and returning it through the pump   56   and  heat  exchanger  58  to  the  top  of  the  same  bed   as streams 60 and/or 62.    Alternatively, the liquid can be drawn from the  bottom  most catalyst bed  and  returned to the  highest  bed  via stream  62.     Cooling   at  58   can   be   used,   if   necessary,   to   provide<br>
combined composition adjustment and intercooling between reactive beds.     For  example,  while  withdrawal  intercooling  stream  34  from point 31, cooling that stream in exchanger 38 and returning the flow to   distribution   system  41   will   cool  the   liquid   but   not  change  the composition.      However,   withdrawing   the   same   liquid   from   31, passing it via line 54 through pump 56 to exchanger 58, cooling the liquid and returning it to liquid distributor 40 above the catalyst bed will change the composition profile within the column.    This design flexibility     can     be     used    to     maximize    the     efficiency     of    the hydrogenation.      In   this   fashion,   the   option   of   cooling   against   a warmer cooling medium available in the prior art is maintained with the modified pumparound/intercooler reducing the expensive low levei cooling required in the overhead system.    Further, the heat removed by   these   pumparound   streams   can   be   utilized   elsewhere   in   the ethylene plant to reduce energy consumption.   Another advantage of the   new   pumparound  scheme   is  that  it  allows  for   relatively   large .liquid     flow     without     affecting' 'the     overall     column     separation performance due to heavies in the overhead as in the prior art.   With the  large  liquid  flows,  the  pumparound  can  provide the  necessary liquid loading over the catalyst without the need for additional reflux. This   permits  operation  of the  catalytic  distillation  column   at  lower reflux    ratios    than    previously    possible    without    the    penalty    in distillation efficiency observed with the prior art.   Reflux ratios in the range   of  0.5   to   1.8   by  weight  are  satisfactory  for  producing  the necessary  catalyst liquid  wetting  where values  as  high  as  5   were required with the prior art.    In  addition to the obvious  reduction in energy  requirements,  higher hydrogen partial  pressures" due to  the lower reflux ratios will be available in the present invention resulting in lower required catalyst volumes.<br>
In a catalytic distillation column, it is critical to keep the catalyst wetted at all times to insure that the reaction occurs in the liquid phase. The selectivity of a catalytic distillation system relies in<br>
part on the reaction taking place in the liquid phase while certain components that the operator wishes to remain unreacted such as ethylene remain in the highest concentration in the vapor phase. Maintaining a certain liquid traffic down the column is critical to keeping the catalyst wetted. If the liquid traffic is greater than 800 Ib liquid/hr/ft2 of column cross-section, the catalyst will be highly wetted and reaction selectivity will be maintained.<br>
A secondary control varrable would be variation in the reflux with associated variation in reboiler duty. In this way, both catalyst bed temperature and composition may be altered to achieve the desired hydrogenation.<br>
Additionally, a variable feed location allowing for a main feed point below the stripping section 22 will provide some separation of any heavy components present in the feed before reaching both the catalyst bed 16 and the side stream 52 for the first pumparound. In this way, circulating the heavy, potentially fouling components over the catalyst bed is eliminated: In-addition, feed points above the first catalyst bed can be incorporated to allow for turndown operation and thus avoid the problems of excess catalyst and resultant selectivity loss under these lower flow conditions. The bottoms 63 from the column 14 are sent for further processing as desired.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the present invention includes the addition of a fixed bed trim reactor system providing further hydrogenation of stream 50. This system is typically two reactors with an intercooler but could be a series of reactors with intercoolers between successive reactors. The fixed bed reactor system provides four advantages:<br>
1. The catalytic distillation column no longer needs to operate for high levels of hydrogenation but can be operated for the maximum productivity from the catalyst, a net ethylene gain with high acetylene, methyl acetylene, and propadiene conversion while maintaining acetylene 62 specification.<br>
Changes in the catalytic distillation overhead concentration of<br>
acetylenics  and  dienes  resulting  from  catalyst  deactivation,   carbon<br>
monoxide     content     increase,     or     feedstock     change     can     be<br>
accommodated.<br>
Hydrogen removal can be maintained during temporary upsets<br>
and/or catalyst deactivation or poisoning thus stabilizing performance<br>
of  downstream  refrigeration  systems.     If the  quantity  of  hydrogen<br>
from    the    system    were   to   vary,   the   partial    pressures   of   the<br>
downstream   distillation   system   would   change   and   the   required<br>
quantity  of   refrigeration   would   vary.     This   would   create   process<br>
upsets and be very undesirable.<br>
Opportunity for catalyst regeneration by the use of spare fixed<br>
bed   reactors  thus   extending   onstream   operating   life  of  the   entire<br>
system.<br>
In addition to control of the temperature and composition profile over the column, it is important to operate with less than complete conversion of the acetylenes and dienes over the catalytic distillation column. By doing so, ethylene and propylene gains can be achieved. Further, this operation requires less catalyst than the full hydrogenation of the prior art thus maximizing catalytic distillation catalyst productivity. Operation with a fixed bed reactor system following the column allows this to occur.<br>
If the column were to be operated such that there is no more than approximately  1 % ethylene liquid concentration in the reactive beds,  hydrogenation in  excess of 95%  of the Ca to Cs and  heavier dienes can be achieved.   This results in 5000-7500 ppm dienes and acetylenics in the vapor stream 50 from the reflux drum 46 and a minimum ethylene loss of 1%.   To make 100% acetylene conversion, ethylene losses would even be higher.   This operation coincides to a hydrogen removal of approximately 30-35% depending upon the feed composition.   However, when the overall conversions of the C2 to Cs and heavier dienes and acetylenics are reduced to between 80 and<br>
95% resulting in 10,000 to 20,000 and typically 15,000 ppm Ci to Cs diene and acetylene in the outlet stream 50, ethylene gains can be achieved. Figure 3 is a plot of the dienes at the outlet in ppm versus the ethylene gain or loss in weight percent for a catalytic distillation unit (CDU) alone and for a CDU plus a fixed bed hydrogenation system. As can be seen from' Figure 3, allowing a certain quantity of highly reactive acetylenes and dienes to remain unreacted in the overhead from the catalytic distillation column, ethylene and propylene losses can be eliminated while still obtaining 100% conversion of acetylene overall.<br>
With fixed bed reactors located after the catalytic distillation column  14, C? acetylene breakthrough with  10,000 to 55,000 and typically 20,000 ppm combined Ca and heavier dienes and acetylenes can  be  tolerated  from  the  catalytic  distillation  column.     A  typical system with two fixed bed hydrogenation reactors with intercooling has been shown to hydrogenate 100% of the C2 acetylenes entering .the    fixed    bed   reactor   system •• .and    approximately   75%    of   the combined  Ca  and  heavier dienes  and  acetylenes  entering  the   fixed bed reactor system.    This  results in 2500 to  14,000  and typically only  5000  ppm  breakthrough  of  dienes   and  acetylenics  from  the combined system.   This represents approximately 97% hydrogenation of the total C2 and heavier acetylenes and diolefins in the feed.   Such operation allows for substantial overall ethylene gains of up to 0.5% with   70%   overall   acetylene   selectivity  toward   ethylene   at   100% acetylene  conversion.     This  is  a  substantial  improvement  over  the prior art.<br>
The specific hydrogenation reactivity of ethylene is just slightly lower than the specific reactivity of propadiene. Thus close observation of the Cs diene conversion provides a reliable indication of the stability of the ethylene, gain and can be used as a control point for the system. For the catalytic distillation system alone, when Ca diene conversion is between 40 and 60% and typically<br>
45%, ethylene losses are observed. However, when operating at conditions where the Ca diene conversion in the catalytic distillation column is between 10 and 35% and typically 20%, ethylene gains from 0.2% to 0.5 % are possible. With the present invention, the propadiene conversion can be increased substantially while still maintaining ethylene gain.<br>
During the normal operation of an ethylene unit, variations in the carbon monoxide content of charge gas 10 is experienced. In addition, feedstock quality or operating severity may be changed that will impact the acetyienic and diolefin content of charge gas. For a fixed catalyst volume in the catalytic distillation column, increases in carbon monoxide or inlet diene and acetyienic concentrations result in lower conversion and thus higher releases of these undesired products into stream 50. Compensation for such anticipated disturbances would be difficult with the prior art alone as shown in Figure 1. It would require increases in operating pressure or temperature impacting the performance of the entire fractionation system. In the improved process including a fixed bed reactor system, the temperature of the vapor 50 entering the fixed bed reactor system can be adjusted to either increase or decrease reactivity of the reactor system and thus follow changes in catalytic distillation reaction activity and maintain complete €2 acetylene removal and high hydrogen removal efficiency.<br>
Finally, a fixed bed hydrogenation reactor system is designed to include not only operating reactors but also spares. Catalyst deactivation wilt occur in both the fixed bed system and the catalytic distillation system. It is not possible to regenerate the catalytic distillation catalyst without shutting down the process or installing a parallel column. Both options are costly. However, a spare fixed bed vapor phase reactor is a relatively inexpensive option. By utilizing a fixed bed reactor system with a spare instead of the single column<br>
concept   of   the   prior   art,    onstream   life   of   the   process   can   be substantially improved.<br>
In the fixed  bed  hydrogenation system,  the  net overhead  50 from  the   catalytic .distillation   passes  through   the   cross   flow   heat exchanger 64 and inlet heater 66 into the first fixed bed reactor 68. The effluent from the first reactor 68 goes through the intercooler 70 to  the  second  fixed  bed  hydrogenation  in  reactor  72.     A  series  of fixed beds followed by intercoolers can be used in the same fashion in order to achieve the necessary heat transfer when required.    The effluent from the last reactor 72 then goes back through the cross flow heat exchanger 64 where heat is extracted and the feed 50 to the fixed bed reactors is heated.    The inlet temperature to the fixed bed reactors can be quickly changed to either increase or decrease the extent of hydrogenation in the fixed bed reactors.   Such control is necessary   to   successfully   handle   changes   in   carbon   monoxide   or diene and acetylene feed concentration.   Up to a maximum adiabatic temperature  rise  of  80°F  total  for  both  beds,   a  stable  fixed   bed operation with no ethylene loss is possible,   A typical adiabatic rise of 35°F    is    expected    for    normal    operation.        With    an    adiabatic temperature rise of 70 to 80 and typically 80°F, handling of 35000 to 58000 and typically 43000 ppm acetylenes and dienes from the catalytic  distillation results  in  9000 to  30000  and  typically   10000 ppm Cs and heavier dienes and acetylenics in the final product stream 74   while   maintaining   100%   C2   acetylene   conversion   primarily   to ethylene.<br>
In a similar fashion, the temperature control on the inlet to the fixed bed reactors can provide for compensation for catalyst deactivation providing the typical start-of-run and end-of-run operating temperatures to the fixed bed system. In the prior art, this could only be done by a temperature correction in the catalytic distillation column. This require's a pressure change in the column and thus the fractionation conditions will be altered. With both the<br>
catalytic distillation column and fixed bed reactor system of the present invention the catalytic distillation column can operate at constant fractionation conditions and lower temperature corrections for the fixed bed system will be required. This improves system stability and allows for longer life of the catalyst.<br>
Figure   4   presents   an   alternate   embodiment   of   the   present invention.   Instead of catalytic distillation column overhead stream 42 passing   to   exchanger   44   and   then   to   reflux   drum   44,   overhead stream 42 is passed directly to cross-flow exchanger 64 and into the fixed bed reactor system.    Following the fixed bed reactor system, the  effluent  is  cooled   at  65   and  the  reflux  48  for  the   column  is separated at 67 as a condensed liquid 69 and returned to the column. Since the stream  entering the fixed  bed  reactor system  still contains all of the reflux for the column, the operating temperature of the  fixed bed  reactors will  be  somewhat higher to insure complete vapor flow.    This will change the design catalyst activity and space , velocity to insure stable operation;    The advantage of this approach will   be   a   higher   mass   flow   of   hydrocarbon   that   will   minimize temperature  rise across the fixed beds,  a reduced hydrogen  partial pressure that will improve selectivity, and a higher space velocity that will both improve selectivity and decrease catalyst costs.<br>
Figure   5  illustrates  an   alternate  embodiment  of  the  present invention     incorporating     a     pre-reactor.     This     arrangement     is advantageous for bulk selective hydrogenation of feeds high in dienes and acetylenes. Following compression at 1 2 and possible treatment in  a guard  bed  (not shown), the vapor phase feedstock is  admixed with recirculation liquid 76 from the pump 56 of column 14 and the two phase mixture passed co-currently through a fixed  bed  reactor 78.      Hydrogenation   occurs   and   the   presence   of   liquid   serves   to control  the  temperature  rise  through  vaporization.     Hydrogenation reactor 78 can be designed as an operating reactor plus a spare to allow for extending the onstream operation of the system.   Following<br>
the pre-reactor, the liquid/vapor mixture can be either sent to the column directly as a mixed feed or separated in a separation drum and the liquid and vapor fed separately to the column. The latter is preferred since any oligomers formed in the initial hydrogenation will be in the liquid phase and can be fed to the column below the catalyst beds thus reducing fouling.<br>
Performing the fixed bed hydrogenations before the catalytic distillation column 14 will allow for possibly higher catalyst utilization without experiencing ethylene loss for that portion of the hydrogenation due to the large amount of preferentially absorbed dienes and acetylenes of higher reactivity available for hydrogenation. At higher catalyst utilization, lower catalyst volumes would be necessary making the process more economical. A catalytic distillation unit is still required following a pre-reactor to reach hydrogenation specifications. It is anticipated that a maximum of 50% and typically 20 % of the hydrogenation duty can be accomplished in the pre-reactor. '•<br>
Another advantage of a fixed bed hydrogenation reactor before the catalytic distillation column 1 4 is that the reactor can be used as a guard bed for catalyst poisons. The catalyst could either be nickel or palladium. Nickel catalyst for example would be able to catalyze the reaction of the sulfur compound thiophene with butadiene to form a heavy mercaptan. This mercaptan would then be removed in the stripping section 22 of column 14 and thus never contact the palladium catalyst. A still further advantage is that the external pre-reactor system could have a spare and thus allow for regeneration without the requirement for shutting the entire plant down for catalyst replacement.<br>
Alternately, as shown in Figure 6, the liquid 76 from pump 56 can flow downwards through th,e'fixed bed 78 and the vapor stream from the compressor 12 can flow upwards. Liquid from the bottom of tho fixed bed reactor 78 then flows-to a lower portion of column 14<br>
and vapor flows to a higher entry point. The advantage of this counter-current process sequence is that oligomers resulting from polymerization reactions of the unsaturated hydrocarbons are removed from the catalyst bed as formed and do not pass over the remaining portion of the catalyst bed. Also this liquid is sent to column 26 at a lower entry point, minimizing any potential contamination of the catalyst in column 14.<br>
Oligomers which can foul the catalytic distillation catalyst are easily separated and do not rise in the column to contaminate the catalyst. Further, as in the co-current flow option, the pre-reactor catalyst bed can have a spare, allowing for regeneration while the rest of the system is operating. The ability to easily regenerate on-line will increase system cycle lengths as the catalyst zone at the feed inlet is expected to have the highest fouling rate.<br>
To minimize fouling in the fixed bed pre-reactor, liquid flow rates need to be sufficient to minimize local hot spots due to the high . heat of hydrogenation and to wa-.sh any oligomers formed off the catalyst. The operation of these beds is preferably in the vapor continuous zone. For cracked gas feeds that exhibit extreme fouling tendencies, operating in the liquid continuous zone is also possible.<br>
Figure   7   illustrates   a   further   embodiment   of   the   present invention   which   incorporates   fixed   bed   reactors   within   the   liquid pumparound   or   intercooler   streams   that   are   withdrawn   from   the column   14.     The fixed  bed  hydrogenation  reactors  82  and  84  are placed in the side stream from collecting tray 30 and the side stream from collecting tray 31, respectively.    These fixed beds 82 and  84 are in addition to the reactive hydrogenation sections  1 6 and  1 8 in the   hydrogenation   sections   16   and   18   in  the   catalytic  distillation column   14.     A   mass  transfer  zone   85   in  the   form   of   structured packing or trays is also added above the withdrawal point and below the catalyst bed.   This zone allows for hydrogen to be saturated into<br>
the   liquid   phase   and   thus   provide   the   hydrogen   required   for  the hydrogenation of the acetylenes and dienes in the withdrawn liquid.<br>
The ability of the present invention to remove 30 to 40% of the hydrogen from the charge gas prior to chilling and condensation steps lowers the energy consumption and reduces capital cost. The ability to hydrogenate 100% of the acetylene irrespective of the carbon monoxide concentration without any C2 or Ca olefin losses was not possible with the prior art. The combined fixed bed and catalytic distillation steps provide superior handling of system upsets while maintaining stable diene/acetylene hydrogenation and hydrogen removal.<br>
Following are some examples which illustrate the present invention in its various embodiments as compared to the prior art. The following Table 1 sets forth the feed composition used for all the examples. Table 2 lists the results for each of the examples.<br>
Table 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
Example 1:<br>
This example represents prior art outlined in the previous U.S. Patent 5,679,241  (Figure 1) based on a one step catalytic distillation column operating with a reflux ratio of 4.4.   With a typical front end acetylene  hydrogenation catalyst containing  palladium levels  below 2000   ppm   and   operating   at   pressure   of   195   psig   and   average catalyst temperature of 230 °F C2 acetylene conversion reached 84% with 0%  ethyiene loss/gain.    At the reactor outlet there  were  370 ppm   of   C2   acetylene   and   a , total   of    19070   ppm   dienes   and acetylenics.      Total   acetyiene/diene   conversion   is   79.5%.       This example represents the case where the single column is operated for<br>
no ethylene loss.    As can be seen, there \s substantial breakthrough of C? acetylene.   This would produce off-spec ethylene product.<br>
Example 2<br>
This   example   also  represents  prior  art  and  is  based  on  the single catalytic distillation column of Example 1   with higher catalyst temperature and slightly lower reflux ratio of 4.1.   The hydrogenation severity   of   a   single   column   can   be   increased   to   reach   low   €2 acetylene levels.   This can be accomplished by raising temperature or increasing   catalyst   activity.     The   higher  temperature   operation   is intended to reduce acetylene content and thus achieve specification ethylene   product.       In   this   case   all   the   diene    and    acetylenic conversions are higher compared to Example 1, however there is also a 0.6% ethylene loss.    At the reactor outlet there were 240 ppm of C2 acetylene and a total of 12340 ppm dienes and acetyienics.   Total acetylene/diene conversion is 86.7%.   As can be seen, increased C2 . acetylene conversion is accompanied by increased ethylene loss that is economically undesirable.    Further, the ethylene product still does not meet the specification limits of 1-2 ppm.<br>
Example 3<br>
This example represents prior art and is based on the single catalytic   distillation   column   of    Example    1    with    higher    carbon monoxide  levels in the feed.     Carbon  monoxide  acts  as  a  catalyst poison    and    therefore    diene    and    acetylenic    conversions    were substantially reduced.   At carbon monoxide levels of 0.1 mol% in the feed (0.6% carbon monoxide to hydrogen ratio) the product had 460 ppm of  acetylene  and  33860 ppm  of total dienes  and   acetyienics. The lower catalyst activity resulting from the CO is reflected on the loss   of   catalyst   productivity   (0..12   to   0.09   Ibmol/hr-ft3   catalyst structure)  and the  lower overall  acetylene/diene conversion  (63.6% versus 79.5% for the base case).<br>
The response to this reduced activity would be to raise the temperature of the catalyst within the catalytic distillation column. This would require an increase in pressure beyond what is practical in an operating unit. Thus options to compensate for CO increases are limited for the prior art.<br>
Example 4<br>
This example represents the improved combined operation of the catalytic distillation column and a fixed bed reactor described in Figure 2. This combined operation is necessary in order to realize ethylene gains with 100% C2 acetylene conversion and 50% to 95% conversion of all other diene and acetylene compounds. Operation of the catalytic distillation column at 195 psig and average catalyst temperature of 230°F and 195 psig pressure resulted in 12,000 ppm by weight dienes and acetylenes in the catalytic distillation overhead which was then fed to the fixed bed hydrogenation reactor system.<br>
Operation of the fixed bed hydrogenation reactors at gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 1800 h'1 and inlet bed temperatures of 129°F was successful in converting 100% of the C2 acetylene and provide enough additional hydrogenation resulting in 50% overall Ca diene conversion (both catalytic and fixed bed hydrogenation), as well as 96.1% overall conversion of the dienes and acetylenes in the feed to the combined system. This resulted in 0 ppm of €2 acetylene and 3640 ppm Ca and heavier diene and acetylenes in the outlet. Specification ethylene product can be produced with very high overall conversion of the highly unsaturated species.<br>
Example 5<br>
This example represents the improved combined operation of the catalytic distillation column and a fixed bed reactor at high carbon monoxide levels in the feed. At carbon monoxide levels of 0.1 mol% in the feed with constant operating conditions for the catalytic<br>
ABBLUM/2GO<br>
distillation column, only the fixed bed inlet temperature needed to be adjusted in order to maintain product specifications. Specifically, with an increase in carbon monoxide from 0.05 to 0.1 mol%, an increase in the inlet fixed bed temperature from 129 to 140°F was sufficient to maintain the conversion of the C2 acetylene. Further, the Ca and heavier dienes and acetylenes were further hydrogenated resulting in 7740 ppm wt. totaMiene and acetylenes in the product.<br>
The    proposed    improvement   of   the   present   invention    will perform    100%    Ca   acetylene    hydrogenation   with    stable    90% + hydrogenation   of   the   Ca   to   Cs   and   heavier   acetylenes,    90% + hydrogenation   of  C4   and   Cs  dienes,   and   50%+   conversion   of   Ca diene in a feed stream without hydrogenating the C2 and Ca olefins. The resulting hydrogen removal with the present invention will remain steady   at   30   to   40   and   typically   30%   depending   on   the   feed composition.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
