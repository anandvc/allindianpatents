				<td>NOVEL COMPOUNDS, THEIR PREPARATION AND USE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, to the use of these compounds as pharmaceutical compositions, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds and to a method of treatment employing these compounds and compositions. More specifically, the compounds of the invention can be utilised in the treatment and/or prevention of conditions mediated by the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPAR), in particular the PPAR8 subtype.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the major cause of death in Type 2 diabetic and metabolic syndrome patients (i.e. patients that fall within the 'deadly quartet' category of impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridaemia and/or obesity).<br>
The hypolipidaemic fibrates and antidiabetic thiazolidinediones separately display moderately effective triglyceride-lowering activities although they are neither potent nor efficacious enough to be a single therapy of choice for the dyslipidaemia often observed in Type 2 diabetic or metabolic syndrome patients. The thiazolidinediones also potently lower circulating glucose levels of Type 2 diabetic animal models and humans. However, the fibrate class of compounds are without beneficial effects on glycaemia. Studies on the molecular actions of these compounds indicate that thiazolidinediones and fibrates exert their action by activating distinct transcription factors of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) family, resulting in increased and decreased expression of specific enzymes and apolipoproteins respectively, both key-players in regulation of plasma triglyceride content. Fibrates, on the one hand, are PPARa activators, acting primarily in the liver. Thiazolidinediones, on the other hand, are high affinity ligands for PPARy acting primarily on adipose tissue.<br>
Adipose tissue plays a central role in lipid homeostasis and the maintenance of energy balance in vertebrates. Adipocytes store energy in the form of triglycerides during periods of nutritional affluence and release it in the form of free fatty acids at times of nutritional deprivation. The development of white adipose tissue is the result of a continuous differentiation process throughout life. Much evidence points to the central role of PPARy activation in initiating and regulating this cell differentiation. Several highly specialised proteins are induced during adipocyte differentiation, most of them being involved in lipid storage and metabolism. The exact link from activation of PPARy to changes in glucose<br>
metabolism, most notably a decrease in insulin resistance in muscle, has not yet been clarified. A possible link is via free fatty acids such that activation of PPARy induces Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL), Fatty Acid Transport Protein (FATP) and Acyl-CoA Synthetase (ACS) in adipose tissue but not in muscle tissue. This, in turn, reduces the concentration of free fatty acids in plasma dramatically, and due to substrate competition at the cellular level, skeletal muscle and other tissues with high metabolic rates eventually switch from fatty acid oxidation to glucose oxidation with decreased insulin resistance as a consequence.<br>
PPARa is involved in stimulating p-oxidation of fatty acids. In rodents, a PPARa-mediated change in the expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism lies at the basis of the phenomenon of peroxisome proliferation, a pleiotropic cellular response, mainly limited to liver and kidney and which can lead to hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents. The phenomenon of peroxisome proliferation is not seen in man. In addition to its role in peroxisome proliferation in rodents, PPARa is also involved in the control of HDL cholesterol levels in rodents and humans. This effect is, at least partially, based on a PPARa-mediated transcriptional regulation of the major HDL apolipoproteins, apo A-l and apo A-ll. The hypotriglyceridemic action of fibrates and fatty acids also involves PPARa and can be summarised as follows: (I) an increased lipolysis and clearance of remnant particles, due to changes in lipoprotein lipase and apo C-III levels, (II) a stimulation of cellular fatty acid uptake and their subsequent conversion to acyl-CoA derivatives by the induction of fatty acid binding protein and acyl-CoA synthase, (III) an induction of fatty acid p-oxidation pathways, (IV) a reduction in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis, and finally (V) a decrease in VLDL production. Hence, both enhanced catabolism of triglyceride-rich particles as well as reduced secretion of VLDL particles constitutes mechanisms that contribute to the hypolipidemic effect of fibrates.<br>
PPAR8 activation was initially reported not to be involved in modulation of glucose or triglyceride levels. (Bergeret al.,y. Biol. Chem. ,1999, Vol 274, pp. 6718-6725). Later it has been shown that PPAR5 activation leads to increased levels of HDL cholesterol in dbldb mice (Leibowitz et al. FEBS letters 2000, 473, 333-336). Further, a PPAR5 agonist when dosed to insulin-resistant middle-aged obese rhesus monkeys caused a dramitic dose-dependent rise in serum HDL cholesterol while lowering the levels of small dense LDL, fasting triglycerides and fasting insulin (Oliver et al. PNAS 2001, 98, 5306-5311 ).The same paper also showed that PPAR5 activation increased the reverse cholesterol transporter ATP-binding cassette A1 and induced apolipoprotein A1-specific cholesterol efflux. The involvement of PPAR8 in fatty acid oxidation in muscles was further substantiated in PPARa<br>
knock-out mice. Muoio et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 2002, 277, 26089-26097) showed that the high levels of PPAR5 in skeletal muscle can compensate for deficiency in PPARa. Taken together these observations suggest that PPAR8 activation is useful in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases and conditions including atherosclerosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and mixed dyslipidaemia (WO 01/00603).<br>
A number of PPAR5 compounds have been reported to be useful in the treatment of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia (WO 02/59098, WO 01/603, WO 01/25181, WO 02/14291, WO 01/79197, WO 99/4815, WO 97/28149, WO 98/27974, WO 97/28115, WO 97/27857, WO 97/28137, WO 97/27847).<br>
Glucose lowering as a single approach does not overcome the macrovascular complications associated with Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Novel treatments of Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome must therefore aim at lowering both the overt hy-pertriglyceridaemia associated with these syndromes as well as alleviation of hyperglycae-mia.<br>
This indicate that research for compounds displaying various degree of PPARa, PPARy and PPAR8 activation should lead to the discovery of efficacious triglyceride and/or cholesterol and/or glucose lowering drugs that have great potential in the treatment of diseases such as type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, syndrome X (including the metabolic syndrome, i.e. impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, hypertrigyceridaemia and/or obesity), cardiovascular diseases (including atherosclerosis) and hypercholesteremia.<br>

The stereoisomers of the compounds forming part of this invention may be prepared by using reactants in their single enantiomeric form; in the process wherever possible or by conducting the reaction in the presence of reagents or catalysts in their single enantiomer form or by resolving the mixture of stereoisomers by conventional methods. Some of the preferred methods include use of microbial resolution, enzymatic resolution, resolving the diastereomeric salts formed with chiral acids such as mandelic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, and the like wherever applicable or chiral bases such as brucine, (R)- or (S)-phenylethylamine, cinchona alkaloids and their derivatives and the like. Commonly used methods are compiled by Jaques et al in "Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolution" (Wiley Interscience, 1981). More specifically the compound of formula I may be converted to a 1:1 mixture of diastereomeric amides by treating with chiral amines, aminoacids,<br>
aminoalcohols derived from aminoacids; conventional reaction conditions may be employed<br>
to convert acid into an amide; the dia-stereomers may be separated either by fractional crystallization or chromatography and the stereoisomers of compound of formula I may be prepared by hydrolysing the pure diastereomeric amide.<br>
Various polymorphs of compound of general formula I forming part of this invention may be prepared by crystallization of compound of formula I under different conditions. For example, using different solvents commonly used or their mixtures for recrystallization; crystallizations at different temperatures; various modes of cooling, ranging from very fast to very slow cooling during crystallizations. Polymorphs may also be obtained by heating or melting the compound followed by gradual or fast cooling. The presence of polymorphs may be determined by solid probe nmr spectroscopy, ir spectfoscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction or such other techniques.<br>

PHARMACOLOGICAL METHODS<br>
In vitro PPARalpha, PPARgamma and PPARdelta activation activity<br>
The PPAR transient transactivation assays are based on transient transfection into human HEK293 cells of two plasmids encoding a chimeric test protein and a reporter protein respectively. The chimeric test protein is a fusion of the DMA binding domain (DBD) from the yeast GAL4 transcription factor to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the human PPAR proteins. The PPAR-LBD moiety harbored in addition to the ligand binding pocket also the native activation domain (activating function 2 = AF2) allowing the fusion protein to function as a PPAR ligand dependent transcription factor. The GAL4 DBD will direct the chimeric protein to bind only to Gal4 enhancers (of which none existed in HEK293 cells). The reporter plas-mid contained a Gal4 enhancer driving the expression of the firefly luciferase protein. After transfection, HEK293 cells expressed the GAL4-DBD-PPAR-LBD fusion protein. The fusion protein will in turn bind to the Gal4 enhancer controlling the luciferase expression, and do nothing in the absence of ligand. Upon addition to the cells of a PPAR ligand luciferase protein will be produced in amounts corresponding to the activation of the PPAR protein. The<br>
amount of luciferase protein is measured by light emission after addition of the appropriate substrate.<br>
CELL CULTURE AND TRANSFECTION<br>
HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM + 10% PCS. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates the day before transfection to give a confluency of 50-80 % at transfection. A total of 0,8 µg DNA containing 0,64 µg pMα/yLBD, 0,1 µg pCMVpGal, 0,08 µg pGL2(Gal4)5 and 0,02 µg pADVANTAGE was transfected per well using FuGene transfection reagent according to the manufacturers instructions (Roche). Cells were allowed to express protein for 48 h followed by addition of compound.<br>
Plasmids:     Human PPAR µ,  and 8 was obtained by PCR amplification using cDNA synthesized by reverse transcription of mRNA from human liver, adipose tissue and plancenta respectively. Amplified cDNAs were cloned into pCR2.1 and sequenced. The ligand binding domain (LBD) of each PPAR isoform was generated by PCR (PPARa: aa 167 - C-terminus; PPARy: aa 165 - C-terminus; PPAR8: aa 128 - C-terminus) and fused to the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 by subcloning fragments in frame into the vector pM1 (Sadowski et al. (1992), Gene 118, 137) generating the plasmids pMlaLBD, pMlyLBD and pM18. Ensuing fusions were verified by sequencing. The reporter was constructed by inserting an oligonucleotide encoding five repeats of the GAL4 recognition se-<br>
quence (5 x CGGAGTACTGTCCTCCG(AG)) (Webster et al. (1988), Nucleic Acids Res. 16, 8192) into the vector pGL2 promoter (Promega) generating the plasmid pGL2(GAL4)5. pCMVpGal was purchased from Clontech and pADVANTAGE was purchased from Promega.<br>
IN VITRO TRANSACTIVATION ASSAY<br>
Compounds:   All compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted 1:1000 upon addition to the cells. Compounds were tested in quadruple in concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 300 µM. Cells were treated with compound for 24 h followed by luciferase assay. Each compound was tested in at least two separate experiments.<br>
Luciferase assay:   Medium including test compound was aspirated and 100 nl PBS incl. 1mM Mg++ and Ca++ was added to each well. The luciferase assay was performed using the LucLite kit according to the manufacturers instructions (Packard Instruments). Light emission was quantified by counting on a Packard LumiCounter. To measure ß-galactosidase activity 25 µl supernatant from each transfection lysate was transferred to a new microplate. ß-galactosidase assays were performed in the microwell plates using a kit from Promega and read in a Labsystems Ascent Multiscan reader. The ß-galactosidase data were used to normalize (transfection efficiency, cell growth etc.) the luciferase data.<br>
STATISTICAL METHODS<br>
The activity of a compound is calculated as fold induction compared to an untreated sample. For each compound the efficacy (maximal activity) is given as a relative activity compared to Wy 14,643 for PPARa, Rosiglitazone for PPARy and Carbacyclin for PPAR6. The EC50 is the concentration giving 50% of maximal observed activity. EC50 values were calculated via non-linear regression using GraphPad PRISM 3.02 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Ca). The results were expressed as means + SD.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
