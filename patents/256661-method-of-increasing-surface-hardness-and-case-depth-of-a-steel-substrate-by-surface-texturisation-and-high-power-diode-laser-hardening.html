				<td>TITLE: "A METHOD OF ENHANCING LASER ABSORPTION ON STEEL<br>
SUBSTRATE THEREBY ACHIEVING BETTER PROPERTIES OF HARDENED<br>
CASE"<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the field of hardening of steel surface in general and to a<br>
method of increasing surface hardness and case depth of a steel substrate by<br>
surface texturisation followed by hardening through high power diode laser, in<br>
particular.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The process of laser interaction with the base material is strongly dependent on<br>
the texture of the surface. When the laser light beam falls on the sample surface,<br>
part of the light photons are absorbed by the initial layers and heat gets<br>
adiabatically transferred to the bulk whereas the rest of the photons are reflected<br>
from the surface. The temperature attained at the surface depends on the sweep<br>
rate of the laser beam and the conductivity of the medium. Since the laser light<br>
beam is very focused and intense, it causes the temperature to rise rapidly<br>
beyond austenitic phase start temperature (Ac1), where the steel undergoes<br>
phase change. As the beam moves further, the rapid heating is followed by rapid<br><br>
cooling by means of extraction of heat into the bulk, thereby causing<br>
microstructure changes in the heat affected layers of the substrate. The beam<br>
absorption depends strongly on the surface texture. In order to enhance<br>
absorption, reflectivity has to be minimized.<br>
One method adopted to increase absorption using carbon dioxide lasers is<br>
reported in US Patent 4313771. The work piece intended for laser hardening in<br>
first treated with a solution to cause blackening of its surface and subsequently<br>
subjected to a laser beam.<br>
Another method adopted to increase absorption is reported in US Pater.t<br>
4414038. This involves directing a laser beam at the surface to be treated, such<br>
as a metallic surface which is likely to reflect a large percentage of its incident<br>
energy at an oblique incidence. In case of steel, the absorption is markedly<br>
increased at angles of incidence greater than 45Â° and just short of glancing<br>
angle.<br>
Laser hardening is typically carried out on as-machined samples that are cleaned<br>
with a solvent to remove fine dust, grease, etc. prior to the process. The<br>
deficiency of the present process is relatively poor absorption of the laser beam<br>
due to higher reflectivity from the metallic surface resulting in more power<br>
consumption, lower hardness, and lesser case depth.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
To overcome the drawbacks of the prior art, the following innovative remedial<br>
actions were undertaken to improve it;<br>
The method of invention requires texturing by hard fine shots impinging on the<br>
martensitic steel substrate under pressure to create controlled roughness close<br>
to the desired values. The surface finish of sample was measured before and<br>
after texturing.<br>
Using low power the resultant laser hardened surface after application of the<br>
inventive method of surface texturisation followed by hardening using high<br>
power diode laser, has a higher hardness value with increased case depth in<br>
comparison to the untreated laser hardened surface and is shown with graphs in<br>
Fig. 3, where (A) represents before i.e., untreated laser hardened surface and<br>
(B) represents after surface finish and treated with laser.<br>
A surface treatment (described below) prior to laser treatment is found to be<br>
extremely important to attain the eventual quality of the hardened surface. It<br>
helps in increasing the case depth significantly as well as minimizes the problems<br>
of lens damage due to fine smoke/dust that emanates from a rough surface. The<br>
combination of the initial surface treatment and high power diode laser<br><br>
hardening results in excellent hardness, enhanced case depths, excellent liquid<br>
impingement erosion properties and increased efficiency of laser operation.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
The invention will now be described with the help of accompanying drawings<br>
which depict an exemplary embodiment of invention. However, there can be<br>
other embodiments all of which are deemed covered by the description.<br>
Fig. 1: Shows surface texture of X20Cr13 steel sample before surface texturing<br>
Fig. 2: Shows surface texture of X20Cr13 after surface texturing.<br>
Fig. 3: A graph showing case depth Vs. hardness, before and after surface<br>
finish.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Surface Texturing<br>
The surface texturing step carried out prior to the laser hardening process so as<br>
to attain a desired surface roughness is a novel concept and it results in<br>
substantial improvement in properties. It is carried out to increase the absorption<br><br>
of laser radiation more effectively on the substrate surface. The hardness gets<br>
improved by around 25%, case depth becomes doubled and power consumption<br>
of the laser is reduced by 5%.<br>
This texturing was carried out by hard fine shots impinging on the martensitic<br>
steel substrate at sufficient pressure to create controlled roughness close to the<br>
desired values (Ra upto 
measured before and after texturing. These are given in Figures 1 and 2. From<br>
the Figures, it can be seen that their finish appears ideal for trapping the laser<br>
light and thus minimizing reflectivity losses.<br>
High Power Diode Laser (HPDL) surface treatment<br>
Droplet erosion samples of the material typically used in lower rating steam<br>
turbines were fabricated along with a fixture to hold and rotate them while<br>
carrying out HPDL surface treatment. Each sample was fixed in self-centred<br>
three jaw chuck at one end and supported on a fixture on the other side. The<br>
fixture has a rotating seal, so that the samples can rotate freely and air used for<br>
cooling the samples does not leak. In order to make the surface free from dust<br>
and oil, the samples were thoroughly cleaned using acetone before the start of<br>
the experiment. Rapid cooling of the sample was carried out during HPDL<br>
treatment by introducing compressed air having high volumetric flow rate<br>
through the central hole.<br><br>
The laser treatment was carried out on the sample surface using a Robotic High<br>
Power Diode Laser System. Laser beam power was controlled in a closed loop by<br>
a pyrometer system and a uniform surface temperature was maintained during<br>
the process. Uniform compressed air cooling of the sample was maintained<br>
throughout the HPDL treatment process.<br>
Droplet erosion testing of HPDL surface treated samples<br>
The test facility consists of a large diameter chamber and a round stainless steel<br>
disc where the test samples are positioned on the periphery of the disk. The disc<br>
is rotated at a high rpm to provide the test sample with tangential velocity of<br>
~150 m/s. Two water jets impinge on the cylindrical test samples and cause<br>
impingement erosion. The cylindrical specimens were selected because the<br>
impingement erosion on actual steam turbine blades occurs at the leading edge,<br>
which also has similar leading edge radius. A precision balance was used for<br>
measuring the mass loss after testing. Depending upon energy and mass fluxes,<br>
the test duration was selected such that steady state erosion is achieved in<br>
limited cycles. The accuracy and ability to repeat of the test have been<br>
established on Martensitic steel sample which is taken as a reference material.<br>
The extent of erosion damage is calculated from the mass loss and density data<br>
of the material.<br><br>
Hardness<br>
The hardness of the surface textured and laser treated samples are found to be<br>
much superior than that by conventional laser treated samples. The depth of the<br>
hardened case is also much higher at over 1000 micron. The resultant laser<br>
hardened surface has a higher hardness value (~650 HV 100) as compared to<br>
the hardness achieved from untreated laser hardened surface (~500 HV100) at a<br>
lower power density by upto 5%, for attaining the same surface temperature as<br>
compared to an untreated laser hardened surface, due to enhance absorption<br>
and reduced reflectivity<br><br>
