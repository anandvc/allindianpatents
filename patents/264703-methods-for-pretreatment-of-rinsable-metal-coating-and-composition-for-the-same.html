				<td>RINSABLE METAL PRETREATMENT METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to non-chrome containing coatings for metals. More particularly, the present invention relates to rinsable, non-chromate, non-metal phosphate coatings for steel, zinc coated steel, and aluminum surfaces to improve the adhesion of siccative coatings to the surface and provide enhanced corrosion protection.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is well known to those skilled in the art to employ a chromate or phosphate conversion or passivation coating on the surface of metals to impart improved corrosion resistance of bare and painted metal, improve adhesion of coatings, and for aesthetic purposes. For example, see Corrosion, L.L. Sheir, R.A. Jarman, G.T. Burstein, Eds. (3rd Edition, Butterworth-Heinemann Ltd, Oxford, 1994), Volume 2, chapter 15.3.<br>
Growing concerns exist regarding the toxicity profile of chromium and the pollution effect of chromates, phosphates and other heavy metals discharged into rivers and waterways by such processes. Because of the high solubility and the strongly oxidizing character of hexavalent chromium ions, conventional chromate conversion processes require extensive water treatment procedures to control their discharge. Phosphate processes also require waste treatment procedures prior to discharge. In addition, the disposal of the solid sludge from such waste treatment procedures is a significant problem.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need in the art to provide an effective non-chromate, non metal phosphate, or reduced phosphate based treatment to inhibit metal surface corrosion and enhance adhesion of paint or other coatings that may be applied to the surface.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Acidic, aqueous solutions or dispersions are provided for contact with the requisite metal surfaces such as steel, zinc coated steel, and aluminum surfaces. The solutions and dispersions are. chromate free and provide enhanced corrosion protection and adherence of siccative coatings on the metal surface. These siccative coatings typically include paints, lacquers, inks, varnishes, resins, etc.<br>
The methods of the invention comprise contacting the requisite metal surface with an effective amount of an acidic aqueous composition or dispersion to enhance corrosion protection and adherence of siccative coatings. The chromate and inorganic phosphate free composition or dispersion comprise (a) a material or materials including a Group IV B element; (b) a fluoride source; and (c) phosphonic acid or phosphonate. After contact of the surface with the above composition or dispersion, the coating may be rinsed and dried in place. The surface is then ready for application of a paint, lacquer, varnish, resin, or other siccative coating thereto.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The inventors have found that an improved, non-chromate conversion or passivation coating can be provided on metal surfaces, particularly steel surfaces, zinc coated steel and aluminum surfaces. The acidic aqueous compositions or dispersions comprise (a) a material or materials comprising one or more elements selected from the Group IV B elements as set forth in the CAS version of the Periodic Table of Elements. Such elements comprise Zr, Ti, and Hf. Mixtures of these elements may be included. Zr and Ti containing materials are preferred. Exemplary Zr sources are adapted to provide Zr anions in an acidic medium and include a soluble fluozirconate, zirconium fluoride (ZrF/O, or water soluble zirconium salt such as zirconium nitrate or sulfate. Further, the zirconium source can comprise an ammonium or alkali zirconium salt. Zirconium oxides and Zr metal itself may be used provided it ionizes to Zr anion in an acidic medium. Most preferably, the Zr source comprises fluozirconic acid, H2ZrF6. Additionally, organic Zr containing compounds may be utilized provided they liberate Zr in the acidic aqueous medium.<br>
The Group IV B element may also comprise Ti. The preferred Ti source is but titanium fluorides such as TiF3 and TiF4 may also be mentioned. Nitrate, sulfate, ammonium or alkali titanium salts can also be used as well as Ti metal itself. Additionally, organic Ti compounds can be used if they liberate Ti in the acidic medium. Preliminary tests have included use of Ti(iv) isopropoxide as a Ti source component especially if it is reacted with an acidic solution such as<br>
The fluoride source (b) that is used as a component of the acidic treatment or composition may most preferably be the same fluozironic or fluotitiantic acid that may be employed to provide the Ti and/or Zr. It is most preferred that the treatment comprise H2ZrFe6and H2TiF6 which combination will adequately serve as a source of the Zr, Ti, and fluoride. Other suitable F sources include hydrofluoridic acid and salts thereof, alkali metal bifluorides, itySiFg and HBF*. Again, the source must be capable of liberating F in the medium. Most preferably, the combined Zr, Ti, and F sources liberate fluotitanate and fluozinconate, i.e., (TiFe)"2 and (ZrFg)"2, in the medium.<br>
The desirable fluoride concentration is that which will combine with the Zr and Ti to form a soluble complex therewith, for example, a fluozirconate and fluotitanate. Generally, at least about 4 moles of fluoride is provided per mole of Zr and Ti present. Zirconium and titanium may be present in the treatment medium in amounts up to slightly greater that their solubility limits.<br>
With regard to component (c) of the formulation, the phosphonic acids and phosphonates, these may be mentioned as including any compounds having the formula<br>

Preferably both linear EBO and cyclic EBO are present at once in the form of mixed solution. Based upon preliminary data, a mixture of linear EBO and cyclic EBO is preferred for use. These phosphonates may be prepared via the following preparatory route.<br>
Phosphonate Preparation: Linear EBO and Cyclic EBO Mixture (Group IV)<br>
To a glass reactor vessel equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, overhead condenser, and addition port are charged 70% aqueous phosphorous acid (2.00 mole) and 32% aqueous hydrochloric acid (0.33 mole). 90% actives paraformaldehyde<br>
(2.00 mole) is men added drop wise to the acid solution with mixing. After addition, the reactor contents are heated to 85±2°C under a nitrogen sparge and held for 30 minutes. The nitrogen sparge is then switched to a nitrogen blanket and 99% monoethanolamine (1.00 mole) is charged drop wise over a 1 to 2-hour period while maintaining a batch temperature of 85±2°C. After addition, the batch is heated to 93±29C and held for 8 hours. After the hold, the batch is cooled and adjusted to pH 9-10 by addition of 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide (3.73 mole). The batch temperature is then adjusted to 40±2°C and 35% aqueous hydrogen peroxide (1.07 mole) is charged drop wise over approximately a 1-hour period with cooling to maintain the batch temperature between 38-52°C. After addition, the batch is held at 50±2°C for 2 hours. The batch is then cooled to room temperature and collected. During the cool down, 50% aqueous gluconic acid (0.005 mole) is charged to the batch.<br>
The product as produced is characterized by 13P NMR as a nominal 1:1 molar ratio of the sodium salts of Linear EBO and Cyclic EBO and is referred collectively hereinafter as EBO. The material is also composed of traces of the sodium salts of residual phosphorous acid, oxidized byproduct phosphoric acid, and byproduct methylenediphosphonic acid. It is a preferred embodiment of the invention to utilize the product as produced without any purification.<br>
Other exemplary phosphonates may be prepared as follows:<br>
Phosphonate Preparation: 4-Bromobenzylphosphonic Acid (BBPA) (Group II)<br>
4-bromobenzyl bromide (4.4 g, 0.017 mol) was combined with the triethylphosphonate (3.5 g., 3.5 mL, 0.021 mol) and heated at 130°C for 12 hours. The reaction was cooled to room temperature and stored in the dark. The intermediate was dissolved in 20 mL MeCN and treated with solid KI (8.7 g, 0.0525 mol) followed by Me3SiCl (5.63 g, 6.6 mL, 0.105 mol). The reaction was stirred for 6 hours at 60°C and cooled to room temperature. The solid KC1 was filtered, and the residue was evaporated to dryness. The residue was taken in 10 mL distilled water.<br>
The amber oil precipitated in 5 minutes. The solid was fileted and washed with cold hexanes. This gave 3.02 g (70%) of the product as a white-gray powder.<br>
Phosphonate Preparation: 4-tert-Butylbenzylphosphonic Acid (TBBPA) (Group II)<br>
4-tert-butylbenzyl bromide (0.91 g, 4.0 mmol) was combined with the triethylphosphonate (0.798 g, 0.836 mL, 4.8 mmol) and heated at 130°C for 24 hours. The reaction was cooled to room temperature and stored in the dark. The intermediate was then dissolved in 5 mL MeCN and treated with solid KI (1.92 g, 11.62 mmol) followed by Me3SiCl (1.27 g, 1.47 mL, 11.62 mmol). The reaction was stirred for 12 hours at 60°C and cooled to room temperature. The solid KC1 was filtered, and the residue was evaporated to dryness. The residue was taken in 5 mL distilled water. The amber oil precipitated in 5 minutes. The solid was filtered and washed with cold hexanes. This gave 0.80 g (90%) of the product as a white-amber powder.<br>
The other substituted benzyl phosphonates of class II are similarly prepared. That is, the corresponding benzyl bromide is used as the starting reactant and then reacted with triethylphosphonate to form the desired substituted benzylphosphonate ester. The ester may be converted to the acid form via conventional techniques or used in its so produced ester form.<br>
All of the other specifically enumerated phosophonates are commercially available.<br>
Additionally, a silane (d) may be included in the acidic treatment composition. Representative silanes include, but are not limited to, alkoxysilane, aminosilane, ureidosilane, glycidoxysilane, or mixtures thereof. Preferred alkoxysilanes and aminosilanes are taught in U.S. Patent 6,203,854. At present, most preferred is ureidopropyltrimethoxy silane available from GE Silicones- OSI under the designation Silquest A 1524.<br>
