Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to adhesive compositions for rubber and fiber which improve the adhesiveness between rubber and synthetic fibers, rubber-reinforcing synthetic fibers coated with the adhesive composition thereby having improved adhesiveness to rubber, and fiber-reinforced rubber structures comprising the rubber-reinforcing synthetic fibers coated with the adhesives.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Synthetic fibers are commonly used as reinforcing materials for rubber structures such as tires, belts, hoses, etc. The synthetic fibers used include polyester fibers such as polyethylene terephthalate fibers, polyamide fibers such as typically nylon 6 fibers and nylon 66 fibers, aromatic polyamide fibers, polyvinyl alcohol fibers, etc. However, since such synthetic fibers have poor adhesiveness to rubber, various means have heretofore been proposed of improving the adhesiveness of synthetic fibers to rubber by coating the surfaces of synthetic fibers with an adhesive agent comprising an epoxy compound, an isocyanate compound, a halogenated phenol compound or the like.<br>
An example of a typical adhesive agent for polyester fibers is a mixture prepared by mixing a reaction product of a halogenated phenol such as 2,6-bis(2',4'-dihydroxyphenylmethyl)-4-chlorophenol and resorcinol-formaldehyde with a liquid comprising a precondensate of resorcinol-formaldehyde and rubber latex (RPL) (see Japanese Patent Publication No. 46-11251). However, a fairly large amount of this adhesive agent must be applied to polyester fibers, and the fibers must be heat-treated at high temperatures in order to provide sufficient adhesive strength (drawing strength). The fibers treated under such severe conditions exhibit an increased initial adhesive<br><br>
strength (drawing strength) in ordinary temperature conditions, but the adhesion of rubber to the cleaved fiber plies is retarded.<br>
A two-step method of applying adhesive agents to polyester fibers is known, in which polyesters are treated with a first treating liquid comprising a mixture of an epoxy compound, a blocked isocyanate and bentonite and then treated with a second treating liquid comprising RFL and an ethylene-urea compound (for example, see Japanese Patent Publication No. 57-29586). However, this method results in polyester fibers having adhesive strength (drawing strength) with low heat resistance. Additionally, the stability of the first treating liquid is poor since the bentonite in the liquid has a high true specific gravity and a large particle size, and therefore is not viscous and is easily precipitated.<br>
Another method is known in which polyester fibers are treated with a first treating liquid comprising a mixture of an epoxy compound, a blocked isocyanate and a latex, and then treated with a second treatmg liquid comprising RFL (for example, see Japanese Patent Publication No. 60-24226). The polyester fibers treated by this method have a relatively high initial adhesive strength (drawing strength) and the adhesion of rubber to the cleaved fiber plies is enhanced. However, the treated polyester fiber cords become hard and the mechanical strength of the cords is lowered, whereby not only is the difficulty in shaping and working the cords increased, but also the fatigue resistance of the cords is lowered.<br>
As typical examples of means of improving the adhesiveness of polyamide fibers to rubber, there is known a method for producing ultra-high-strength nylon tire-reinforcmg cords which involves dipping tire-reinforcing cords comprising ultra-high-strength nylon 6 or nylon 66 fibers having a single yam denier of 4.5 d or less and a raw yam strength of 12 g/d or more, in a liquid comprising a resorcinol-formaldehyde precondensate and a rubber latex, while the cord strength is controlled to be 0.5 g/d or<br><br>
more (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 63-175179), and also a method for producing rubber-reinforcing polyamide fibers by heat-treating twisted cords comprising nylon 66 fibers having a raw yarn strength of 12 g/d or more under tension at particular temperatures, followed by dipping them in a dipping liquid comprising a vinylpyridine-styrene-butadiene copolymer rubber latex where the proportion of vinylpyridine is specifically defined relative to the total weight of the latex, whereby the decrease in the strength of the thus-treated cords is prevented (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 1-174628). However, the rubber-reinforcing polyamide fibers obtained according to these methods have various problems inhibiting their practical use: the fibers require a single yarn denier of 4.5 d or less, dipping steps must be applied to the fibers, the improvement in the adhesiveness of the fibers to rubber is still unsatisfactory, and the use of the treated fiber cords is limited.<br>
One example of known techniques for improving the adhesiveness of aromatic polyamide fibers to rubber involves dipping an aromatic polyamide fiber material in a first treating liquid comprising a polyepoxy compound having a hydroxyl group(s) and an epoxy compound having unsamrated bond(s), followed by a heat treatment and thereafter a treatment with a second treating liquid of a resorcinol-formaldehyde-rubber latex (RFL) (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 61-126142). However, the adhesiveness between rubber and the aromatic polyamide fibers obtained is still inferior to that between nylon fibers or polyester fibers and rubber.<br>
Another known method involves treating aromatic polyamide fibers with a first treating liquid comprising a polyepoxy compound, a blocked isocyanate compound and a rubber latex compound, followed by treatment with a second treating liquid comprising a resorcinol-formaldehyde-rubber latex (RFL) and a particular chlorophenol compound (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 3-40875). The aromatic polyamide fibers obtained  <br><br>
by this method exhibit adhesiveness to rubber comparable to the adhesiveness of nylon or polyester fibers to rubber, but the method still requires that large amounts of the adhesive composition be applied to the fibers in order to attain satisfactory adhesiveness. Therefore, the costs associated with the adhesive compositions are high.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide adhesive compositions which make synthetic fibers highly adhesive to rubber even when a reduced amount of the composition is applied to the fibers.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide rubber reinforcing synthetic fibers having improved adhesiveness to rubber, and in particular, improved initial adhesive strength (drawing strengdi) to rubber and improved adhesiveness to rubber at the cleaved fiber plies, without repressing the intrinsic characteristics of the synthetic fibers themselves.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide fiber-reinforced rubber structures where the rubber has been reinforced by synthetic fibers having improved adhesiveness to rubber.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an adhesive composition for adhering rubber and synthetic fiber, said adhesive composition comprising an adhesive matrix and a silicate compound, wherein said silicate compound comprises silicon and magnesium at a ratio by weight of silicon/magnesium of from about 1/0.1 to 1/1.0, and wherein a 1% aqueous dispersion of said silicate compound has a transmittance of at least about 50% and/or a 2% aqueous dispersion of said silicate compound has a thixotropy index of about 2.0 to 10.0.<br><br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides rubber-reinforcing synthetic fibers having improved adhesiveness to rubber characterized in that the surfaces of the synthetic fibers are coated with the above-mentioned adhesive composition.<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention provides fiber-reinforced rubber structures characterized in that the rubber in the rubber structures are reinforced by rubber-reinforcing synthetic fibers having unproved adhesiveness to rubber.<br>
The silicate compound of the adhesive composition comprises silicon and magnesium at a weight ratio (Si/Mg) of from 1/0.1 to 1/1.0 and is characterized in that the transmittance (T) of the 1 % aqueous dispersion of the silicate compound is about 50% or more and/or that the thixotropy index of the 1 % aqueous dispersion thereof is from about 2.0 to 10.0. The most preferred example of the silicate compound is a synthetic clay smectite.<br>
It is preferable that the adhesive matrix component of the adhesive composition consists essentially of a resorcinol-formaldehyde-rubber latex, or of at least one compound selected from a polyepoxide compound, a blocked polyisocyanate compound, an ethylene-urea compound and rubber latex. In addition, it is preferable that the amount of the silicate compound to be added to the adhesive matrix component is from about 1 to 15% by weight of the adhesive matrix component.<br>
It is also preferable that when the synthetic fibers are polyester fiber cords, the amount of the adhesive composition coating the fiber cords is from about 2.0 to 4.0 % by weight relative to the weight of the fibers, the cord hardness is from about 5 to 20 g/cord and the drawing T-adhesive strength of one cord is from about 5.8 to 7.5 g/d; that when the synthetic fibers are polyamide fiber cords, the amount of the adhesive composition coating the fiber cords is from about 2.0 to 5.0 % by weight relative to the weight of the fibers, the cord hardness is from about 5 to 20 g/cord and the drawing T-<br><br>
adhesive strength of one cord is from about 5.5 to 7.5 g/d; that when the synthetic fibers are aromatic polyamide fiber cords, the amount of the adhesive composition coating the fiber cords is from about 3.0 to 5.0 % by weight relative to the weight of the fibers, the cord hardness is from about 5 to 20 g/cord and the drawing T-adhesive strength of one cord is from about 5.5 to 7.5 g/d; and that when the synthetic fibers are polyvinyl alcohol fiber cords, the amount of the adhesive composition coating the fiber cords is from about 2.0 to 5.0 % by weight relative to the weight of the fibers, the cord hardness is from about 5 to 20 g/cord and the drawing T-adhesive strength of one cord is from about 5.5 to 7.5 g/d.<br>
In addition, it is preferable that the synthetic fiber cords have both a primary twist and a final twist, with the twist coefficient for the final twist being from about 900 to 1800 and the twist coefficient for the primary twist being from about 1300 to 2500.<br>
The fiber-reinforced rubber structures of the invention include, for example, tires, belts, hoses, etc.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention will now be described in detail, with the adhesive compositions of the invention first being described.<br>
The silicate compound incorporated into the adhesive matrix component to form the adhesive composition of the present invention is an inorganic compound which comprises silicon and magnesium, while optionally containing sodium, lithium, fluorine and/or aluminum. In general, the silicate compound is a synthetic inorganic compound which is referred to as a smectite.<br>
It is preferable that the transmittance (T) of the 1 % aqueous dispersion of the silicate compound be about 50% or more, more preferably about 70% or more.<br><br>
It is also preferable that the thixotropy index of the 2% aqueous dispersion of the silicate compound be from about 2.0 to 10.0, more preferably from about 3.0 to 9.0, and that the specific surface area of the silicate compound is from about 100 to 500 m2/g, more preferably from about 150 to 400 m2/g.<br>
The transmittance (T), the thixotropy index and the specific surface area referred to herein are values obtained according to the methods mentioned below. Transmittance (T):<br>
A 1 % aqueous dispersion of a silicate compound is well stirred and then kept static for one full day.   After having confirmed that the dispersion has no precipitate, the dispersion is put in a cell having a length of 10 mm, and the transmittance therethrough at 500 nm is measured with a spectrophotometer (U-3000 Model, produced by Hitachi). Thixotropy Index (TI):<br>
A 2 % aqueous dispersion of a silicate compound is well stirred then kept static for one full day. After having confirmed that the dispersion has no precipitate, the viscosity of the dispersion is measured with a viscometer (B Model, produced by Shibaura System). The rotor used is a No. 3 Rotor. The rotor is rotated for one minute at 6 rpm and 60 rpm but is stopped for 2 minutes just before the measurement.<br>
TI = (viscosity at 6 rpm)/(viscosity at 60 rpm) Specific Surface Area:<br>
A specific surface area meter (Quantasorb, produced by Yuasa Ionics), is used. The cell for the device is weighed and then approximately half-filled with the silicate compound to be measured (about 0.15 g). The cell is then weighed and measured with the meter according to a conventional method. The specific surface area of the compound is calculated as follows:<br>
Specific Surface Area (m2/g) = (A/AC) x (V x 2.81/amount of samole (g))<br><br>
A: the value indicated by the integrating meter after the cell has been taken out of liquid nitrogen and dipped in water at room temperature.<br>
AC: the value indicated by the integrating meter after pure liquid nitrogen gas has been introduced.<br>
V:   A/1300.<br>
The silicate compound, especially the synthetic smectite, provides a thixotropic water dispersion having a stable viscosity and while also enlarging its specific surface area.<br>
Thus, the silicate compound acts as a penetration inhibitor and as a softening agent. Therefore, even when a reduced amount of the adhesive composition is applied to synthetic fibers, not only is the adhesion stability of the fibers to rubber improved, but also the treated fiber cords are softened, and deterioration of cord strength is effectively prevented.<br>
Specifically, since the silicate compound has many hydroxyl groups on its surface, it absorbs the water molecules in the adhesive composition and penetrates through fiber cords whereby the penetration of the adhesive matrix component comprising an epoxy compound, isocyanate compound, rubber latex, etc., into the depths of fiber cords is retarded. Therefore, when the fiber cords to which the adhesive compositions has been applied are subjected to a heat treatment, the adhesive matrix component is solidified on the surface layer of each fiber cord, while the silicate compound is substantially left m the depths of the fiber cord. As a result, the degrees of freedom of the individual yams in the depths of the cord are enlarged, the softness of die fiber cords is improved, and the high strength of the fiber cords themselves is mamtained.<br>
In addition, the adhesive matrix component, particularly when it is rubber latex, avoids coagulation from the addition of the silicate compound to the composition, and<br><br>
therefore the adhesive matrix component is uniformly mixed and stabilized in the composition and can adhere uniformly onto the surfaces of the fibers with high coagulating strength. For these reasons, the fibers coated with even a small amount of the adhesive composition of the present invention exhibit excellent adhesiveness to rubber.<br>
The silicate compound is incorporated into a treating liquid with a one-bath adhesive formulation (hereinafter referred to as treating liquid A) or mto a treating liquid with a two-bath adhesive formulation (hereinafter referred to as treating liquid B).<br>
The treating liquid A with a one-bath adhesive formulation is an adhesive composition where the adhesive matrix component consists essentially of a resorcinol-formaldehyde-rubber latex, and is applied to synthetic fiber cords in one step.<br>
The resorcinol-formaldehyde-rubber latex is a mixUire comprising a precondensate of resorcinol-formaldehyde and a rubber latex and is generally referred to as RFL.<br>
The precondensate of resorcinol and formalin in the RFL is obtained in the presence of an alkaline catalyst, and it is preferable that the molar ratio of resorcinol to formalin is from about 1/0.3 to 1/3.0, more preferably from about 1/0.75 to 1/1.50.<br>
It is preferable that the RFL is a mixture of a precondensate obtained by the reaction of a compound of the following general formula (I) and formalin at a weight ratio of from about 1/10 to 10/10 in the presence of an alkaline catalyst, with a rubber latex mixture obtained by mixing a rubber latex and aqueous ammonia at a weight ratio of from about 10/0.1 to 20/1, at a weight ratio of from about 1/8 to 1/4 in terms of the solid contents.<br><br><br>
wherein n represents 0 or an integer from 1 to 15.<br>
As the compound of formula (I), a novolak-type resin obtained by reacting dihydroxybenzene and formaldehyde in the absence of a catalyst or presence of an acidic catalyst may be used. Specifically, a condensate is obtained by condensing one mol of resorcinol and 0.70 mols of formaldehyde (for example, Sumikanol-700 (trade namt) produced by Sumitomo Chemical).<br>
Where the novolak-type condensate of resorcinol and formalin is used in the RFL, it is preferable that the condensate be dissolved in an aqueous dispersion of an alkaline catalyst, to which formalin is added, so as to have the same molar ratio as that of the resorcinol-formalin precondensate.<br>
The rubber latex used in the RFL may be a natural rubber latex, a styrene-butadiene rubber latex, an acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber latex, a chloroprene rubber latex, a vinylpyridine-styrene-butadiene rubber latex, etc. These can be used either singly or as mixtures. In particular, when a vinylpyridine-styrene-butadiene latex is used along with other rubber latexes, it is preferable that the ratio of the vinylpyridine-styrene-butadiene latex to the other rubber latexes is about 70 % by weight or less.<br>
It is preferable that the treating liquid A is used as a solution or dispersion having a total solid concentration of the adhesive matrix component of from about 5 to 20%, more preferably from about 8 to 16%. The treating liquid A is preferably applied to poly amide fibers and polyester fibers, particularly high-strength nylon 66 fiber cords.<br>
The treating liquid B with a two-bath adhesive formulation is an adhesive composition where the adhesive matrix component consists essentially of at least one compound selected from polyepoxide compound, blocked polyisocyanate compounds and ethylene-urea compounds. Treating liquid B is applied to synthetic fiber cords, which are<br><br>
thereafter treated with a second treating liquid comprising RFL as the essential adhesive matrix component (hereinafter referred to as treating liquid C).<br>
The polyepoxide compound suitable for liquid B is a compound having two or more epoxy groups in one molecule and includes, for example, reaction products of polyalcohols, such as glycerol, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, ethylene glycol, polyediylene glycol, propylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, etc., and halogen-containing epoxides such as epichlorohydrine, etc.; reaction products of polyphenols, such as resorckiol, bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)dimethylmethane, phenol-formaldehyde resins, resorcinol-formaldehyde resins, etc., and halogen-containing epoxides such as those mentioned above; and polyepoxide compounds obtained by oxidizing the unsaturated bond part of bis-(3,4-epoxy-6-methyl-dicyclohexylmethyl)adipate,3,4-epoxycyclohexene-epoxide,etc.<br>
Of these polyepoxide compounds, preferred are reaction products of polyalcohols and epichlorohydrine (polyglycidyl ether compounds of polyalcohols).<br>
The blocked polyisocyanate compound suitable for treating liquid B is a compound capable of releasing the blocking agent under heat to give an active isocyanate compound and includes, for example, reaction products of polyisocyanate compounds such as tolylene diisocyanate, metaphenylene diisocyanate, diphenyhnethane diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, triphenylmethane triisocyanate, etc., and a blocking agent selected from phenols such as phenol, cresol, resorcinol, etc., lactams such as e-caprolactam, valerolactam, etc., oximes such as acetoxime, methyl, ethyl ketone oxime, cyclohexane oxime, etc., ethyleneimine, etc.<br>
Of these blocked polyisocyanate compounds, preferred are e-caprolactam-blocked aromatic polyisocyanate compounds.<br>
The ethylene-urea compound suitable for treating liquid B is such that the ethyleneimine ring in the compound is cleaved under heat and the thus-cleaved product<br><br>
acts to improve the adhesiveness of the fibers coated with the adhesive composition. As typical examples of the compound, mentioned are reaction products of aromatic or aliphatic isocyanates such as hexamethylene diisocyanate, tolylene diisocyanate, diphenylmethane diisocyanate, triphenylmethane triisocyanate, etc., and ethyleneimine, etc.<br>
Of these ethylene-urea compounds, preferred are aromatic ethylene-urea compounds such as diphenylmethane-diethylene-urea.<br>
Treating liquid B may contain the blocked polyisocyanate compounds and/or the ethylene-urea compounds.<br>
The choice of a rubber latex as an optional component in treating liquid B depends on the rubber to be reinforced by the fibers coated with the adhesive composition and includes, for example, vinylpyridine-styrene-butadiene copolymer latexes, styrene-butadiene-type rubber latexes, acrylonitrile-butadiene-type rubber latexes, chloroprene-type rubber latexes, chlorosulfonated polyethylene latexes, acrylate-type rubber latexes, natural rubber latexes, etc.<br>
The proportions of the poly epoxide compound, the blocked polyisocyanate compound and/or ethylene-urea compound (considered as one weight component), and the rubber latex which are in the treating liquid B are preferably from about 10 to 25% by weight, from about 20 to 35% by weight and from about 0 to 70% by weight, respectively, more preferably from about 10 to 20% by weight, from about 20 to 30% by weight and from about 0 to 70% by weight, respectively.<br>
If the proportions of the polyepoxide compound and the blocked polyisocyanate compound and/or ethylene-urea compound are smaller than those falling within the above-mentioned ranges, the initial adhesive strength of the synthetic fibers treated with the adhesive composition is lowered.<br><br>
It is preferable that the treating liquid B is used as a solution or dispersion having a total solid concentration of the adhesive matrix component of from about 2 to 10%, preferably from about 4 to 7%. Treating liquid B is preferably applied to polyester fibers and aromatic polyamide fibers of synthetic fibers.<br>
Treating liquid C (second treating liquid) that is applied to the synthetic fibers treated with treating liquid B preferably comprises a mixture of RFL and an ethylene-urea compound. The rubber latex in the RFL may be, for example, vinylpyridine-styrene-butadiene copolymer latexes, styrene-butadiene-type rubber latexes, acrylonitrile-butadiene-type rubber latexes, chloroprene-type rubber latexes, chlorosulfonated polyethylene latexes, acrylate-type rubber latexes, natural rubber latexes, etc.<br>
The ethylene-urea compound in the treating liquid C may be, for example, reaction products of aromatic or aliphatic isocyanates such as hexamethylene diisocyanate, tolylene diisocyanate, diphenylraethane diisocyanate, triphenylmethane triisocynante, etc., and ethyleneimine, like in the treating liquid B.<br>
The amount of the ethylene-urea compound added to the treating liquid C in order to improve the adhesiveness of the adhesive composition is preferably from about 3 to 30% by weight, especially preferably from about 10 to 20% by weight, relative to RFL. If the amount of the ethylene-urea compound in treating liquid C is smaller than about 3 % by weight, the effect of the compound of improving the adhesiveness of the adhesive composition is unsatisfactory. However, even if the ethylene-urea compound is added in an amount larger than about 30% by weight, no further improvement in the adhesiveness of the adhesive composition is realized, and the addition of such a Large amount of the ethylene-urea compound can produce negative effects such as a reduction in the mechanical strength of the cured fibers.<br><br>
It is preferable that treating liquid C is used as a solution or dispersion having a total solid concentration in the adhesive matrix component of from about 5 to 20%, preferably from about 7 to 15%.<br>
The silicate compound is added to the treating liquid A or B in an amount from about 1 to 15% by weight relative to the adhesive matrix component in the liquid. Preferably, the amount of the silicate compound added to the treating liquid A is from about 2.0 to 5.0% by weight, whereas the amount added to treating liquid B is from about 3 to 10% by weight. If the amount of the silicate compound in the treating liquid is smaller than about 1.0% by weight, reduction in the mechanical strength of the fiber cords treated with the liquid will not be prevented. If, however, the quantity of the silicate compound is larger than about 15.0% by weight, the adhesiveness of the treated fiber cords to rubber is often lowered.<br>
The rubber-reinforcing synthetic fibers of the present invention will now be described.<br>
The rubber-reinforcing synthetic fibers as referred to herein may be in the form of filament yams, cords, woven structures, woven fabrics, etc. comprising synthetic fibers, such as polyamide fibers, polyester fibers, aromatic polyamide fibers, polyvinyl alcohol fibers, etc., and are characterized in that their surfaces have been coated with the above-mentioned adhesive composition. Preferred are cords of such fibers having both a primary twist and a fmal twist in the opposite direction at a twist coefficient of from about 1500 to 2300, more preferably from 1600 to 2000.<br>
The polyester fibers are preferably made from polyethylene terephthalate or a high-molecular linear polyester consisting essentially of ethylene terephthalate units.<br>
The polyamide fibers are preferably made from nylon 6 or nylon 66. Preferred are ultra-high-strength nylon 66 cords made of fibers of high-molecular nylon 66 having<br><br>
a relative viscosity (relative to sulfuric acid) of about 3.0 or more, more preferably about 3.5 or more, and containing an antioxidant comprising a copper compound by which the durability of the cords against the deterioration by heat, light and oxygen is improved.<br>
The aromatic polyamide fibers are preferably made from poly-p-phenylene-terephthalamide, poly-p-phenylene-3,4'-diphenyleter-terephthalamide, and copolymers consisting essentially of these.<br>
The polyvinyl alcohol fibers are preferably made of polyvmyl alcohol having a degree of polymerization of about 500 or more, more preferably about 2000 or more.<br>
The rubber-reinforcing synthetic fibers of the present invention can be produced by treating synthetic fibers with the above-mentioned one-bath or two-bath treating liquid comprising the adhesive composition of the invention.<br>
The one-bath adhesive formulation mentioned above is preferably applied to polyamide fibers, polyester fibers and polyvinyl alcohol fibers, more preferably to ultra-high-strength nylon 66 fibers. These fibers are processed into rubber-reinforcing synthetic fibers:   an example of such a process will be described below.<br>
Non-treated fiber cords are directly, or after having been woven into cord fabrics, fed to a dipping step where the treating liquid A mentioned above is applied to the non-treated fiber cords or cord fabrics.<br>
The 'treating liquid A is applied to the non-treated fiber cords by any conventional dipping, coating and spraying method, and it is preferable that the cord tension maintained during the process is from about 0.05 to 0.20 g/d.<br>
It is preferable that the quantity of treating liquid A to be adhered to polyamide fiber cords is from about 2.0 to 5.0% by weight, more preferably from about 2.5 to 4.0% by weight, in terms of the solid content in the liquid, and that the quantity of treating liquid A to polyvinyl alcohol fiber cords is from about 2.0 to 5.0% by weight.<br><br>
especially preferably from about 2.5 to 4.0% by weight. The amount of treating liquid A adhered to the fiber cords can be controlled by varying the concentration of the dipping liquid, the amount of the silicate compound in the liquid A, and the conditions for wiping the dipped cords.<br>
After treating liquid A has been applied to the fiber cords, the thus-dipped cord are dried at 100 to 160°C for 60 to 120 seconds, and then heat-treated under tension at 210 to 250°C for 30 to 60 seconds in a hot-stretching zone. The cord tension during the process is such that the intermediate elongation and the thermal shrinkage of the cord matches have predetermined values. It is desirable that the conditions for the thermal relaxation treatment and the time for the treatment in the next normalizing zone are the same as those in the previous hot-stretching zone.<br>
The two-bath adhesive formulation mentioned above is applied to polyester fibers and aromatic polyamide fibers. These fibers can be processed into rubber-reinforcing synthetic fibers.   An example of such a process is described below.<br>
First, treating liquid B is applied to fiber cords, which are then dried at 70 to 150°C and thereafter heat-treated at 200 to 255°C.<br>
Next, treating liquid C is applied to the fiber cords, which are again dried at 70 to 150°C and thereafter heat-treated at 200 to 255°C.<br>
The amount of treating liquid B adhered to the synthetic fiber cords is preferably from about 1.0 to 2.0% by weight, more preferably from about 1.2 to 1.7% by weight, in terms of the solid content of the liquid, for polyester fibers; and is preferably from about 1.0 to 3.0% by weight, more preferably from about 1.2 to 2.0% by weight for aromatic polyamide fibers.<br>
The thus-obtained rubber-reinforcing synthetic fibers of the present invention have a cord hardness of from about 5 to'20 g/cord and have a drawing T-adhesive strerigth of<br><br>
one cord of from about 5.5 to 7.5 g/d. Even though the amount of the adhesive composition adhered to the fibers is small, the adhesiveness of the fibers to rubber is extremely high.<br>
' Therefore, the rubber-reinforcing synthetic fibers of the present invention can be formed into soft and high-grade cords having excellent adhesiveness (drawing strength) to rubber and having excellent fatigue resistance. The cords are useful as reinforcing materials for rubber products such as tires, belts, hoses, etc.<br>
In particular, the dipped polyamide fiber cords have a high mechanical strength and have high adhesiveness to rubber and, in addition, the high mechanical strength of the cords is v^^ell maintained even after the cords are combined with rubber and subjected to vulcanization. Therefore, the dipped polyamide fiber cords may be formed into high-strength vulcanized cords. Where the high-strength vulcanized cords are used as reinforcing materials for tires, the number of the cords in one tire may be advantageously reduced. Where these are woven into cord fabrics, the number of the plies in one cord fabric may be advantageously reduced.<br>
Since the fiber cords treated with the adhesive composition of the present invention may have a reduced fineness (size), the fiber cords treated with the adhesive composition can have a reduced weight without lowering their rubber-reinforcing function. Therefore, the rubber-reinforcing fiber cords of the present invention enable the realization of lightweight fiber-reinforced rubber structures.<br>
The fiber-reinforced rubber stnicmres of the present invention are characterized in that the rubber in rubber structures have been reinforced by the rubber-reinforcing synthetic fibers mentioned above. These stnicmres exhibit high-grade characteristics such as being soft and having unproved adhesiveness (drawing strength) between the fibers and<br><br>
rubber therein and improved fatigue resistance. Therefore, these fiber-reinforced rubber structures are extremely useful as tires, belts, hoses, etc.<br>
The present invention is described in more detail by means of the following examples, which, however, are not intended to restrict the scope of the present invention defined in the appended claims. In the following examples and comparative examples, the data of the samples were obtained according to the methods mentioned below.<br>
(1)	T-adhesive Strength:<br>
According to the adhesive strength-A method of JIS L-1017 (1983), a treated cord is embedded in non-vulcanized rubber and subjected to pressure vulcanization at 150°C for 30 minutes. After cooling, the cord is drawn out of the rubber block at a speed of 30 cm/min, whereupon the drawing load per cm is divided by the fineness of the cord. The thus-obtained value is represented in the units g/d. The fineness is measured according to JIS L-1017 (1983). For polyester fiber cords and poly amide fiber cords, the fineness is based on the corrected weight, which is referred to as a conditioned fineness (size). For aromatic polyamide fiber cords, the fineness is based on the bone dry weight, which is referred to as an absolute dry fineness (size).<br>
(2)	Cord Hardness:<br>
A treated cord is straightened and cut mto 2 cm lengths. A cut cord is put on the bridge of a Tensilon tensile tester (1 cm distance; ø = 0.6 mm), and a hook bar ø =<br>
 0.6 mm) which is perpendicular to the cord is applied to the center of the cord and pulled down at a speed of 2 cm/min, whereupon the maximum stress value is obtained.   The<br>
thus-obtained value is referred to as the cord hardness.<br>
(3)	Fatigue Resistance (in terms of disc fatigue by the Goodrich method):<br>
According to JIS L-1017 (1983), a rubber block having polyester<br>
therein is fixed around two discs, which are inclined to have a degree <br><br>
5% and a degree of compression of 20%.   Under this condition, the rubber block is repeatedly fatigued at 1705 rpm for 48 hours.   After this, the percentage (%) strength retention of the rubber block is measured.    The rubber compound used is a non-vulcanized rubber for ordinary carcass consisting essentially of natural rubber. (4) Amount of Resin Adhered:<br>
The amount of the resin adhered to polyester fibers, polyamide fibers, aromatic polyamide fibers or polyvinyl alcohol fibers is obtained according to the weight method of JIS 1-1017(1983).<br>

To 100 parts by weight of the thus-obtained RFL, there was added any of the above-mentioned silicate compounds (2% by weight) at the proportion indicated in Table 9 (Examples 26 to 30).<br>
For comparison, two other treating liquids were prepared in the same manner as above, except that a 2 wt% aqueous solution of the above-mentioned silicate compound E was used in place of the silicate compounds A to D, or no silicate compound was added (Comparative Examples 16 and 17).<br>

As is obvious from the results in Tables 2 to 9, the rubber-reinforcing synthetic fibers treated with the adhesive composition of the present invention have well-balanced characteristics in terms of initial adhesive strength, cord hardness and strength retained after being fatigued. Therefore, by applying the fibers to a rubber matrix, it is possible to obtain high-grade fiber-reinforced rubber structures.<br>
As has been described in detail herein, the adhesive composition of the present invention makes synthetic fibers highly adhesive to rubber even when a reduced amount of the composition is applied to the fibers. Therefore, the present invention enables the production of fiber-reinforced rubber structures at significantly reduced costs.<br>
In addition, since the rubber-reinforcing synthetic fibers of the present invention have improved adhesiveness to rubber, and more particularly, improved adhesive strength (drawing strength) to rubber, while still possessing the desirable intrinsic characteristics of the synthetic fibers themselves, it is possible according to the present invention to obtain high-grade, fiber-reinforced rubber structures which are useful as tires, belts, hoses, etc.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention defined in the appended claims.<br><br><br>
