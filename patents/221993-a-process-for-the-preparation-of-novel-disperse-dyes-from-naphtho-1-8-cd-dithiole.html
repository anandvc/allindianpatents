				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of novel disperse dyes from Naptho [1,8-cd] dithiole. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of novel disperse monoazo dyes from Naptho [1,8-cd] dhhiole as the coupling component in excellent yields. The dyeing characteristics of the monoazo disperse dyes derived from it have also been evaluated.<br>
Substituted "naphtho [1,8-cd] dithiole has been used as an antiviral agent (Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho Jp. 0803,039, CA 124, 220499q, 1996). It also has been used for the protection of aldehydes and ketones (Compt. Rend, 152, 92-94, 1911. Fr). These protected aldehydes and ketones can be easily deprotected to regenerate them in high yields without the use of either the unpleasant smelling alkylthiols, or heavy metals or strong acids. Recently H has been found that naphtho [1,8-cd] dithiole has the capability to form redox active self-assembled monolayer on gold (Langmuir 13, 866-869, 1997)<br>
Like aromatic sulfides in general, naphthof 1,8-cd] dithiole is a bright red<br>
crystalline substance and possesses an anomalously deep color for such a simply constructed compound [Ref: (1) H.S. Desai and B.D. Tilak, J.Sci fad. Res. (India) 19B,<br>
390 1960); Compt. Rend 152 92-94 (Fr) (1911); W.B. Price and S. Smiles, JCS 2372,<br>
•<br>
(1928)]. Attempts to explain this effect theoretically by means of the dipole moment method or UV and IR spectroscopy [Ref. H.S. Desai and B.D. Tilak, J.Sci Ind. Res. (India) 19B, 390 (I960)] led to the conclusion that a necessary condition for the deep color of this compound is the coplanarity of the S-S group and the 7t electron system of the naphthalene. A consequence of this could be 3p-3d overlap of the unshared electrons of the adjacent sulfur atoms or interaction of the 3p electrons of one sulphur atom with the 3d orbital of the adjacent sulfur atom. Data from the quantum chemical character also<br><br>
indicate strong delocalization of the 3p electrons of the S-S group and the formation of a general n electron system.<br>
Disperse dyes are colorants with low water solubility which in then* disperse colloidal form are suitable for dyeing and printing hydrophobic fibres and fabrics. Since 1950, the production of disperse dyes has increased sharply, closely following the growth<br>
i' -.<br>
in the worldwide production of synthetic fibres especially polyester. Furthermore, new dyeing processes necessitated the development of special disperse dyes. When the dye is applied from aqueous medium it is absorbed from the molecularly disposed aqueous solution onto the fibre surface and diffuses into the interior of the fibre. Differences in geometry and polarity of the dyes can have a marked effect on the absorption characteristics of dyes Although a variety of methods are known to be used for the preparation of Naptho[l,8-cd] dithiole, there is no study of disperse dyes derived from Naptho[l,8-cd]dithiole and their dyeing characteristics on fiber. This may be attributed to<br>
t<br>
the complex preparatory methods that are reported for naptho[l,8-cd]dithiole yielding the latter in very poor yields.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of<br>
*<br>
new disperse dyes from Naptho[l,8-cd]dithiole having good light and sublimation fastness properties and their study as potential disperse dyes for polyester fiber<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>

In one of the embodiment of the present invention, the substituted aromatic amine used is selected from the group consisting of substituted cyano phenyl amine such as 4-cyano phenyl amine, substituted cyano nitro phenyl amine such as 2-cyano-4-nitro phenyl amine, substituted alkoxy nitro phenyl such as 4-methoxy-2 nitro phenyl, substituted helo phenyl amine selected from 3-chloro-4-flouro phenyl amine, 2-<br>
i<br>
flour.0 phenyl amine and 2,4 dichloro phenyl amine, substituted alkyl nitro phenyl amine such 4 methyl-3<br>

selected from the group consisting of sodium nitrite, potassium nitrite and lithium nitrite preferably<br>
sodium nitrite.<br>

After addition, the mixture was stirred for 15 min. more and checked for excess of nitrous acid using starch iodide paper. The excess of nitrous acid was destroyed by the addition of urea.<br>
Naptho [1,8-cd] dithiole (1.9 g 0.01 mole) was heated hi 30 ml glacial acetic acid until it dissolved completely and then the solution was cooled to 5°C. The above diazo solution was then added slowly to this solution under stirring and kept at 10°C for 30 min. The pH was brought to 5 by addition of sodium acetate. The ice bath was removed, the mixture allowed to come to room temperature and stirred further for 2 hr. It was poured into ice water (100 ml) and extracted with ethyl acetate (4 x 25 ml). The organic layer was washed with water and dried over sodium sulphate. Solvent was removed from<br>

The dyes prepared by the present invention maybe applied on polyester fibre by the process mentioned below.<br>
Dispersions of the dyes were prepared by milling 1 g of the dye, 1 g of Tamol NNO (dispersing agent) in water 25 ml in a glass tube containing steel rods for 48 h. The 1% dispersion of these dyes were used as stock solution for dyeing polyester fiber.<br>
The dye bath was set with 1% dispersion, 5% unisperse P ( a heat resistant leveling agent) and 1% acetic acid keeping the material liquor ratio 1 : 100. The material was entered at 60°C and the temperature raised to 130°C in 30 min. The dyeing was continued at 130°C for one more hour. After cooling the dyeings were taken out and given treatment with mixed solutions of sodium bisulfite 2% w/v and sodium hydroxide<br>
4% w7v at 70°C for 15 min. Finally, the dyeings were rinsed well with water and dried at 60°C.<br>
t The dyed polyester fiber was tested for sublimation and light fastness properties and were found to be promising. In particular,the dyes imparting blue-green and violet shades (Examples 1&amp;2) exhibited very good light and sublimation fastness properties. Overall, all the dyes showed very good sublimation fastness properties whereas, light fastness varied from moderate to very good. The fastness properties can be further improved by applying the dyes using thermo-fixation process instead of high temperature high pressure dyeing technique used in the present disclosure.<br>

7)	The reaction is very clean and work up involves minimum effort.<br>
8)	The dyes obtained from naptho [1,8-cd] dithiole as coupling component imparted<br>
bright blue to blue-green shades  on  polyester with very good light and<br>
sublimation fastness properties.<br>
9)	The azo dyes containing other substituents like nitro group can be used as a<br>
starting material for the synthesis of cationic dyes.<br>
10)	Naptho [1,8-cd] dithiole enters   readily into the azo coupling reaction not only<br>
with such active diazonium ions as nitro and dinitro benzene diazonium salt but<br>
also with unsubstituted benzene diazonium ion.<br>
11)	The high polarisability of the chromophoric  systems make them potential<br>
molecules for having non-linear optical (NLO) properties and as organic semi<br>
conductors.<br>
12)	The dyes may also find use as speciality colorants for plastics.<br><br><br><br><br>
