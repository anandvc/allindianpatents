PROCESS  FOR THE PREPARATION  OF  LINEAR  LOW  MOELCULAR WEIGHT  ALPHA/ OLEFINS BY THE OLIGOMERIZATION OF ETHYLENE   <br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of linear low molecular weight alpha olefins by the oligomerization of ethylene. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the oligomerization of ethylene to obtain low molecular weight alpha olefins, such as C4 to C24, preferably, C4 to C18 alpha olefins, using an improved catalyst system comprising of a zirconium alkoxide, alkylaluminum halide/alkylaluminums. Background of the invention<br>
Low molecular weight alpha olefins can be synthesised by polymerisation of ethylene. It is known in the art that this process produces even carbon numbered olefins having 4 to 50 carbon atoms and terminal double bonds. In some cases branched olefins are also produced.<br>
Present commercial processes for making C4 to C20 linear alpha olefins are based on Ziegler high pressure growth reaction on aluminum triethyl (Ethyl process, US patent 3906053, 1975) followed by low pressure displacement or non-Ziegler route. The Gulf process uses a one step catalytic reaction, wherein chain growth and elimination occur simultaneously in the same reactor (DE 1443927, 1961). In the non-Ziegler route, organo-nickel complexes in combination with a modifier is employed for SHOP process (US Patents 3676523, 1972; 3726938, 1973; 3825615, 1974; European Patent 177999, 1986). ZrCl4 - ETAI2CI3 - Thiophene catalyst has been employed in the Idemitsu process (European Patent 241956, 1987; Japanese Patent 6259225, 1987).<br>
The use of Ti(OR)4 (R = Cresyl) - EtAl2Cl3 - PPh3 to obtain better control over distribution of alpha olefins is described in Indian Patent 182153 (1999) and in European Patent 0722922 (1999). The Exxon process (US Patents 4409414, 1983 and 4486615, 1984) has shown that at least 90 mole % linear alpha olefins having average molecular weight ranging from 70 to 700 can be obtained from oligomerising ethylene in the presence of AlEt2Cl-AlEtCl2-TiCl4-t-BuOH and AlEt2Cl-AlEtCl2-ZrCl4-n-BuOH catalyst systems.<br>
UOP has a process for oligomerization of ethylene, using nickel based catalyst in sulfolane solvent (US Patent 4689437, 1987). The purity and distribution of alpha olefins are increased by adding 1 to 6 wt % water as an additive.<br><br><br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The primary object of the invention is to provide a process for producing linear alpha olefins of low molecular weight form ethylene.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an eco-friendly process for the preparation of low molecular weight linear alpha olefins by ethylene oligomerization.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide a process for preparing linear low molecular weight alpha olefins from ethylene using a catalyst system which has a lower deactivation rate. Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of linear low molecular  weight  alpha  olefins  from  ethylene  in  the  presence  of an  inert  and<br>
t.<br>
ecofriendly solvent using an multicomponent catalyst.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of low molecular weight linear alpha olefins having 4 to 26 carbon atoms, said process comprising oligomerising ethylene in an inert aliphatic or aromatic solvent in the presence of a catalyst comprising zirconium component selected from the group consisting of zirconium alkoxide and zirconium aryloxide, and an alkyl aluminum and/or alkyl aluminum halide component.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the process is carried out under a continuous supply of ethylene and agitation.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the process is performed in semi-continuous mode with ethylene being fed continuously during each period of the process.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the catalyst system comprises of at<br>
least two components, the first component comprising of zirconium (IV)<br>
alkoxide/carboxy late	and	the	second	component	comprising<br>
triethylaluminum/ethylaluminum sesquichloride.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the catalyst if of the formula Zr(OR)4-Et3Al/Et3Al2Cl3 wherein R is alkyl or aryl.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, Et3Al/Et3AhCl3 is reacted with Zr(OR)4in the mole ratio of 10:1 to 60:1.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the ratio of zirccinium alkoxide to the_ free alcohol in the system is in the range of 1:0.33 to 1:2:3.<br><br><br>
	In a further embodiment of the invention, when Et3Al and Et3Al2Cl3 are used,<br>
the EtaAl diluted in solvent is initially charged into the reactor and then Et3Al2 Cl3 and other catalyst components are added therein.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the ethylene pressure is in the range of 18 to 38 kg/cm2.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the temperature of the reaction is in the range of 80°C to 140°C.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the process is carried out for a time period in the range of 1 hour to 3 hours.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the solvent used is selected from cyclohexane and toluene.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the reaction is carried out at an agitator speed of 300 to 1000 rpm.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the zirconium component is selected from the group consisting of zirconium tetra cresylate,  zirconium tetra dimethyl phenolate, zirconium tetra n-butoxide, zirconium tetra iso-propoxide, zirconium tetra n-propoxide, zirconium tetra butyrate and zirconium tetra isobutyrate. Detailed description of the invention<br>
The zirconium (IV) component of the catalyst is represented by the formula Zr(OR)4 wherein R is alkyl or aryl. Zirconium (IV) butoxide and zirconium (IV) isopropoxides are preferred. The amount of free alcohol present in the Zr(OR)4 is critical. Zirconium (IV) carboxylate includes zirconium (IV) octoate. However, a non-limiting list of Zr(OR)4 includes zirconium (IV) cresylate, zirconium (IV) 2,6 - dimethyl phenoxide and the like. The preferred second catalyst component is ethylaluminum sesquichloride or a mixture of triethylaluminum and ethylaluminum sesquichloride system.<br>
The molar ratios of the components of the catalyst used in the invention has a bearing on the production of linear oligomers. It is observed that for the catalyst system used herein, the ratio of Zr(0R)4 to ethylaluminum sesquichloride or triethylaluminum/ethylaluminum sesquichloride is between 1:10 to 1:60. The ratio of Zr(OR)4 to free alcohol present in the system is also critical and is ideally between 1:0.33 to l:1.3/in the absence of free alcohol, Zr(0R)4 has a tendency to oligomerize itself to give an inorganic oligomer which has no activity for the present invention.<br><br>
The oligomerization is preferably carried out at a temperature in the range of 65 - 180°C, the most preferred range being 80 - 140°C. While the conversion of ethylene is low at a reaction temperature below 80°, elevation in temperature leads to lower productivity of the catalyst.<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out at a time range of 1 hour to 3 hours, and the preferred agitator speed is in the range of 300 to 1000 rpm, more preferably 500 to 750 rpm. The active catalyst used in the invention is made by mixing Zr(OR)4 and ethylaluminum sesquichloride. Preferably, the sequence of mixing is by initially adding triethylaluminum and solvent into the reactor followed by Zr(OR)4 and ethylaluminum sesquichloride in that order.<br>
The oligomeric products made by the present invention comprise of C4 to C24<br>
alpha olefins. The oligomerization product is isolated using a catalyst quenching<br>
procedure comprising adding aqueous alkali or sodium bicarbonate solution followed<br>
by water wash and final recovery by distillation.	, ^<br>
The process of the present invention is described further hereinbelow with reference to the following examples, which are merely illustrative and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.<br><br><br>
