The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
1<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to pallets used for materials / goods transportation and storage in various industrial areas, more particularly this invention talks about the metal pallet, wherein thin metal sheet is used in the form of corrugation profile. Further the pallet designed from corrugated sheet metal profile has least number of sub-components, low weight because of it's unique construction, hence results in increased service life, load carrying capacity, durability, operational flexibility with minimum maintenance.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The "Industrial pallets" used for the transportation, material handling, loading / unloading, also for the storage of materials / goods are mainly made of wooden pieces, which are nailed together to form a platform like structure in its upper and lower side and having recesses for receiving lifting forks of a pallet truck, tractor, forklift or like vehicles equipped with lifting forks either in two opposite sides or all in 4 sides to facilitate as '2-way' or '4-way' pallet. Because of low mechanical strength, tendency to absorb water, non-availability of wooden material, these wooden pallets have limited applications. Also these wooden pallets are too heavy for given load carrying capacity, having high initial investment and maintenance cost, not durable (user friendly) because of breakage wooden planks (pieces), heavy weight, nailing joints at corners and more co-efficient of friction results in more dragging / pulling force while loading / unloading the components. Therefore In current scenario most of the industrial pallet manufacturers are shifting to other alternatives to wood.<br>
To changeover from these wooden pallets, which are not environment friendly and having various problems as mentioned above, few pallet manufactures have introduced industrial pallets with different materials like steel, sheet metal, plastic, fiber, corrugated paper, corrugated metal sheet etc. The corrugated metal sheet pallets becomes popular because of their high strengths, low cost, long life, low initial investment and maintenance cost advantages for<br>
2<br><br>
given load carrying capacity. Therefore some of the industrial pallet users and manufactures are switching over to this sheet metal corrugated pallets.<br>
The patents available in the area of metal sheet corrugated pallets are explained below in view of their construction, functions and limitations :-<br>
Pallet according to US patent 4326467 wherein, sheet metal corrugation is provided in 'U' or trapezoidal or box type pattern, slots are provided on top platform for assembling side beam-ends and not having supporting beam at center. Hence this pallet design will have more deflection at the center thereby results in distortion and reduction in load carrying capacity for a given metal sheet thickness. Any small error while assembling the side beam ends in the slots provided on the top platform can result in non-uniform side beam load distribution. Also the box or trapezoidal corrugation design will cause high stress concentration at the sharp corners which will minimize pallet life and increase maintenance.<br>
Pallet design according to US patent 4424752 wherein, no central support's, cross ties (toppling arresters) are provided. Also the recesses for inserting lifting forks are provided in between side beams, which are parallel to metal sheet corrugation pattern. Hence this pallet design will have more deflection at platform center area resulting distortion and reduction in load carrying capacity for given metal sheet thickness. Also in case of uneven material loading / distribution there is possibility of pallet tilting, which can results in severe damage / accidents. Further in case of fork insertion in transverse direction (parallel to corrugation profile), reduces load carrying capacity and can cause the accident because of excess loading.<br>
Pallet design according to WO 9219905 wherein, like US patent 4424752 no central support is provided and recesses for lifting forks insertion are from side beams because of which the load carrying capacity will be minimum for given metal sheet thickness and further increases the possibility of accidents in case of lifting forks inserted from transverse direction i.e. parallel to platform, sheet metal corrugation profile.<br>

So it is the requirement of industrial pallet design which will have unique corrugation profile, support beam(s) to increase load carrying capacity for given metal sheet thickness, cross ties from both the side of support beam(s) to increase rigidity and eliminate risk of pallet tilting when partially loaded. Apart from this, 2-way pallet design will eliminate the possibility of fork insertion in transverse direction, which will helps in avoiding severe damage / accidents.<br>
In addition to above requirement there is need of double sided pallet which will increases operation flexibility during stacking and eliminate various warehouse storage and handling problems.<br>

Detailed description of the preferred embodiments<br>
The single sided pallet according to present invention shown in figure 1 and 2 comprises metal sheet (1) with substantially semi-circular / sinusoidal or like corrugation pattern (2). The metal sheet (1) forms a platform (3) acting as a material / goods carriage media and supported on box shaped or more correctly 'U' shape beams (4) on either side, which are integral with the parent platform structure (3) and extent perpendicularly relative to metal sheet corrugation (2). Channel with 'IT or similar profile (18) is provided at both the extreme ends of platform (3) and parallel to their corrugation profile (2). Additional support beam(s) (5) is provided preferably at the center of the side beams (4) throughout the depth of platform (3) and at right angle to corrugation profile (2). Adequate number of cross ties (6) are provided on either side of support beam(s) (5), which connects the side beams (4), support beam(s) (5) and platform (3). The recessed (7) being form due to the construction of cross ties (6) results in access for insertion of lifting fork of pallet trucks, forklifts, tractor or like vehicles from two opposite sides of platform (3)<br>
Thin metal sheet (1) with semi-circular / sinusoidal or like corrugation pattern (2) is used to form a platform (3) and integral side beams (4), gives an added strength, load carrying capacity for given metal sheet thickness. Side beams (4), which are extensions of platform (3), are form by bending corrugated platform (3) at about 90° at three edges (8, 9 and 10) from both the end of platform (3). The pallet load carrying capacity, metal sheet thickness and material<br>
6<br><br>
handling equipment's (lifting forks) decide distance between these bending edges (8, 9 and 10). Inner free ends (11) of side beams (4) are partially extended towards bottom of platform (3) and fixed to one side of cross ties (12) with proper male and female alignment of there corrugation pattern (2). A thin channel of substantially 'U' or similar shape is fixed parallel to corrugation pattern (2) at the front and rear the front and rear lips (21 and 22) of platform (3) to protect platform<br>
(3)	against hetting of lifting forks and to avoid sharp edges.<br>
Support beam(s) (5) is separate piece form from the same design of metal sheet corrugation (2) and is folded at 4 edges (22, 23, 24 and 25) in a "HAT" shaped profile. This support beam(s) is fixed to the bottom side of platform (3) and preferably located at the center of side beam (4). The assembly of support beam(s) (5) and platform (3) is made with proper alignment of male and female part of their metal sheet corrugation (2). The bottom of support beam(s) (5) is preferably 'U' shaped with upper flanges (14) extends towards both side beam<br>
(4)	to facilitate welding or alike joints in between platform (3) and support<br>
beam(s) (5). The provision of this support beam(s) (5) reduces the platform<br>
deflection at center and improves load carrying capacity of the pallet.<br>
Cross ties (6) are made out of corrugated metal sheet with atleast two corrugation profile. These cross ties are fixed at the bottom side of platform (3) preferably at the corners and center and either side of support beam(s) (5). The cross ties (6) connects support beam(s) (5) and side beam (4) there by generating openings (7) for inserting lifting forks. One end (13) of cross ties (6) is fixed to the vertical face of support beam(s) (5), whereas the other end (12) is fix to the vertical face of side beam free end (10) and bottom of platform (3). The flange (15) of cross ties (6) extends towards the external wall (28) of side beam (4), thereby facilitate welding joint between platform (3) and cross ties (6). The cross ties enhance the pallet rigidity and also acts as a toppling arrestors, thereby preventing pallet lifting when partially loaded.<br>
The cross ties (6) are bended at its both the ends (26, 27) parallel to the corrugation as shown in figure 6 to avoid sharp edges and protect cross ties (6) against hetting of lifting forks.<br>
7<br><br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is shown in figure 4 and 5, wherein a double sided pallet is illustrated with semi-circular / sinusoidal or similar type corrugation pattern (2). The metal sheet (32) forms a platform (33), which act as a material / goods carriage media and supported on box shaped or more correctly 'IT shaped beams (34) on either side, which are integral part of platform (33) and extends perpendicularly relative to metal sheet corrugation (2). Another metal sheet (35) with similar constructions is fixed to the metal sheet (32) from bottom side and in opposite direction to facilitate double sided pallet. Thin channel with substantially 'U' or similar profile (18) as shown in figure 7, is provided at the extreme ends (21 and 22) of platform (3 &amp; 33) and parallel to their corrugation profile (2). Adequate numbers of support members' (31) are provided in between metal sheet (32 and 35) to provide additional support and rigidity.<br>
This metal sheets (32 and 35) with semi-circular / sinusoidal or like corrugation pattern (2) is used to form platform (33) and integral beam (34) on either side. These side beams (34) are the extension of platform (33) and formed by bending corrugated platform (33) at about 90° at three edges (36, 37 and 38). Distance between these bending edges (36,37, and 38) is decided based on the pallet load carrying capacity, metal sheet (33 and 35) thickness and material handling equipment / attachments (lifting forks). Inner free ends (39) of side beams (34) are preferably extended towards the bottom side of platform (33) and fixed to the upper and lower side (40) of support member (31) with proper male and female alignment of their corrugation pattern (2). Referring to figure 7 a thin channel (18) of substantially 'IT or similar shape are fixed, parallel to corrugation pattern (2) at the front and rear lips (21 and 22) of platform (33) to protect it against hitting of lifting forks and to avoid sharp edges.<br>
The support member's (31) are separate pieces formed from the similar design of corrugation profile (2) and are preferably in 'C or similar shape. These support members may be provided at various places in between metal sheet (32 and 35) to facilitate support beam(s) (41) and assembly of metal sheet (32 and 35). Each upper and lower flange (42) of this support member's (31) are fixed to the respective platform (33) of metal sheet (32 and 35), with proper male and<br>
8<br><br>
female alignment of corrugation profile (2), thereby by forms support beam(s) and recesses (7). The support member (36) provided nearby side beam (34), wherein inner upper and lower portion is fixed to the inner free end (39) of respective metal sheet (32 and 35)<br>
Hollow ends (29) of side beams (4 and 34) and support beam(s) (5 and 41) can be sealed with a suitable plate (not shown), which will act as a gusset plate, improves rigidity at all ends (29) and also improve the aesthetics of both double and single sided pallet.<br>
Thus according to the present invention a sheet metal single sided and double sided pallet is designed, which inspite of its low weight, minimum number of sub-components has extraordinary goods / material carrying capacity for given metal sheet thickness, additional strength and rigidity, long service life and which can be manufactured in a simple and rational way. The double-sided pallet improves operational flexibility and eliminates various warehouse problems.<br>
As various changes could be made in the above construction without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description and shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.<br>
