SURFACE-TREATED METALLIC SUBSTRATE OBTAINED BY SAID MANUFACTURING<br>
METHOD, AND METALLIC SUBSTRATE TREATMENT METHOD AND METALLIC<br>
SUBSTRATE TREATED BY SAID METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a surface-treated metal substrate, a surface-treated metal substrate obtained by the process, and a process for treating a metal substrate, and a metal substrate treated by the process.<br>
BACKGROUND ART [0002]<br>
Conventionally, in the industrial coating line, a chromate treatment, a zinc phosphate treatment, and the like are used as an undercoating treatment, to improve the corrosion resistance and adhesion of metal substrates. However, these methods are problematic as they involve environmentally harmful components, generate waste sludge etc. Therefore, as a replacement for the chromate treatment and the zinc phosphate treatment, methods using a chemical conversion treatment composition containing a titanium compound or a zirconium compound have been put into practical use. [0003]<br>
In these surface treatment methods, zirconium/titanium hydroxide, zirconium/titanium fluoride, and the like are deposited on the surface of a metal substrate, which allows the production of a film that is highly protective against corrosion-causing substances. However, metal ions that are eluted from the metal substrate problematically cause a bath containing a chemical conversion treatment composition to become unstable; and further, in order to achieve adequate corrosion resistance after coating, a relatively long treatment time is required, the bath<br>
temperature for surface treatment must be kept at relatively high temperatures, etc., which hinders improvement in energy-conservation and productivity. [0004]<br>
Known chemical conversion treatments using a zirconium compound-containing chemical conversion treatment composition include a metal surface treatment method comprising the step of forming a chemical conversion coating on the surface of a metal article to be treated, by a chemical conversion treatment reaction using a chemical conversion treatment composition containing a zirconium-containing compound and a fluorine-containing compound, the method being characterized in that the chemical conversion treatment reaction is conducted through a cathodic electrolysis treatment (see, for example, Patent Document 1). Known methods of a zinc or zinc-based alloy-plated steel surface treatment include those comprising the step of forming a chemical conversion coating on the surface of a metal article to be treated, by a chemical conversion treatment reaction using a chemical conversion treatment composition that contains at least one member selected from the group consisting of zirconium-containing compounds, fluorine-containing compounds, aluminum ions, vanadium ions, and magnesium ions, the method being characterized in that the chemical conversion treatment reaction is conducted through cathodic electrolysis treatment (see, for example, Patent Document 2). [0005]<br>
However, the surface treatment methods disclosed in Patent Documents 1 and 2 have problems in that uniform chemical conversion coatings are difficult to form, and that films obtained by coating with these coating compositions exhibit neither adequate corrosion resistance nor adequate finish. [0006]<br>
Patent Document 3 teaches an electrodeposition coating method in which a coating film defect referred to as "gas pin holes" can be controlled by superposing a pulse voltage. Patent<br>
Document 3, however, is directed to coating with an electrodeposition coating composition; in contrast, the present application relates to a metal substrate treatment process in which the surface of a metal substrate is treated using a specific treatment composition. Accordingly, the compositions and effects are completely different therebetween.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing a metal substrate that is excellent in corrosion resistance and finish after coating, and a surface-treated metal substrate obtained by the process; and a surface-treatment process that is capable of providing a metal substrate of superior corrosion resistance and finish after coating, and a metal substrate surface-treated by the process.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS [0008]<br>
The present inventors conducted extensive research. As a result, they found that the above object can be achieved by immersing a metal substrate for use as a cathode in a specific treatment composition (I), and applying an electric current thereto for 10 to 600 seconds by superposing an AC voltage (Va) with a frequency of 0.1 to 1,000 Hz and a peak-to-peak voltage of 1 to 40 V onto a 1 to 50 V DC voltage (Vd). The present invention was thus accomplished.<br>
[0009]<br>
Specifically, the present invention is as follows:<br>
1.	A process for producing a surface-treated metal substrate,<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
immersing a metal substrate as a cathode in a treatment composition (I) described below, and<br>
applying electric current for 10 to 600 seconds by superposing an AC voltage (Va) with a frequency of 0.1 to 1,000 Hz and a peak-to-peak voltage of 1 to 40 V onto a 1 to 50 V DC voltage (Vd),<br>
the treatment composition (I) comprising water and a metal compound component (A) comprising one or more compound of at least one metal (a), wherein the metal (a) is selected from the group consisting of zirconium, titanium, cobalt, vanadium, tungsten, molybdenum, copper, zinc, indium, bismuth, yttrium, iron, nickel, manganese, gallium, silver, and lanthanide metals, the metal compound component (A) being contained in an amount of 5 to 20,000 ppm, calculated as a total quantity of metal, on a mass basis.<br>
2.	The process according to Item 1, wherein the waveform of the AC voltage (Va) is rectangular.<br>
3.	The process according to Item 1 or 2, wherein the duty cycle of the AC voltage (Va) is 0.1 to 0.9.<br>
4.	A surface-treated metal substrate obtained by the process according to any one of Items 1 to 3.<br>
5.	A process for surface-treatment of a metal substrate<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
immersing a metal substrate as a cathode in a treatment composition (I) described below, and<br>
applying electric current thereto for 10 to 600 seconds by superposing an AC voltage (Va) with a frequency of 0.1 to 1,000<br>
Hz and a peak-to-peak voltage of 1 to 40 V onto a 1 to 50 V DC voltage (VD),<br>
the treatment composition (I) comprising water and a metal compound component (A) comprising one or more compound of at least one metal (a), wherein the metal (a) is selected from the group consisting of zirconium, titanium, cobalt, vanadium, tungsten, molybdenum, copper, zinc, indium, bismuth, yttrium, iron, nickel, manganese, gallium, silver, and lanthanide metals,<br>
the metal compound component (A) being contained in an amount of 5 to 20,000 ppm, calculated as a total quantity of metal, on a mass basis.<br>
6.	A metal substrate surface-treated by the process according to Item 5.<br>
7.	A coated article, which comprises the substrate according to Item 4 or 6.<br>
Effects of the Invention [0010]<br>
The surface-treated metal substrate production process and the metal substrate surface treatment process according to the present invention provide the following effects.<br>
(1)	A surface-treated metal substrate having superior corrosion resistance and finish after coating can be obtained in a short period of treatment, compared to an electrolytic treatment using a conventional cathode electrolytic method (direct-current electrolytic method). Accordingly, productivity is improved (improvement of takt time).<br>
(2)	In the production process and the treatment process of the present invention, when an AC voltage (Va) is applied onto the metal substrate under cathode bias (also referred to as an "offset voltage" and corresponding to a DC voltage (Vd)), the surface of the metal substrate is activated, which allows uniform formation of treated film generated by an electrolytic treatment.<br>
Accordingly, coated articles obtained by applying a coating composition on a metal substrate with a uniform treated film have superior corrosion resistance and finish.<br>
(3)	The resulting treated film is a uniform, high-dense<br>
film (several tens or hundreds of nm) with few cracks. Since this<br>
film can block corrosion-promoting substances (e.g., 02, CI", Na+),<br>
corrosion of the metal substrate under the coating film can be<br>
inhibited.<br>
(4)	By carrying out an electrolytic treatment using AC<br>
voltage, only a metal component that is capable of forming an<br>
oxide film (for example, fluorozirconium complex ion) can be<br>
deposited on a cathode (selective deposition of a metal component<br>
is possible). For this reason, it is considered that a film<br>
containing a high-purity metal oxide is formed on the metal<br>
substrate.<br>
[0011]<br>
The production process of the film of the present invention will be explained in detail below.<br>

The preferable combination of metal used in the metal compound component (A) is not limited, but a zirconium compound and a yttrium compound, or a zirconium compound and an aluminum compound are preferably used. [0048]<br>
The pH of the treatment composition (I) is preferably 2.5 to 8.0, more preferably 3.0 to 7.5, and even more preferably 3.5 to 7.0. The bath temperature of the treatment composition (I) is usually 5°C to 45°C, preferably 10°C to 40°C, and more<br>
preferably 20°C to 35°C. [0049]<br>
The film comprising the treatment composition (I) mainly comprises metal oxide, metal fluoride, or metal hydroxide. [0050] 1. 3 Surface-treated metal substrate production process<br>
The surface-treated metal substrate production process of the present invention comprises the steps of immersing a metal substrate for use as a cathode in the above mentioned treatment composition (I), and applying electric current for 10 to 600 seconds by superposing an AC voltage (Va) with a frequency of 0.1 to 1,000 Hz and a peak-to-peak voltage of 1 to 40 V onto a 1 to 50 V DC voltage (Vd). [0051]<br>
The DC voltage (Vd) is 1 to 50 V, preferably 5 to 40 V. When the DC voltage is less than 1 V, a film is unlikely to be formed, whereas when the DC voltage is more than 50 V, a film that is not uniform is likely to be formed. [0052]<br>
The frequency of the AC voltage (Va) is 0.1 to 1,000 Hz, preferably 0.5 to 500 Hz, more preferably 1 to 400 Hz, and even more preferably 1 to 100 Hz. When the frequency is less than 0.1 Hz, the amount of a film deposited on the metal substrate is likely to decrease, whereas when the frequency is more than 1,000 Hz, a film is unlikely to be formed. [0053]<br>
The peak-to-peak voltage of the AC voltage (Va) is 1 to 40 V, preferably 5 to 30 V, and more preferably 5 to 20 V. When the peak-to-peak voltage is less than 1 V, the amount of a film deposited on the metal substrate is likely to decrease, whereas when the peak-to-peak voltage is more than 40 V, a film that is not uniform is likely to be formed. [0054]<br>
The duty cycle (x (pulse duration)/T (period)) of the AC voltage (Va) is preferably 0.1 to 0.9, and more preferably 0.3<br>
to 0.7. When the duty ratio is within the above range, a more highly dense film can be formed and is thus preferable. [0055]<br>
The duration for applying an electric current is 10 to 600 seconds, preferably 30 to 120 seconds. When the duration for applying an electric current is less than 10 seconds, the amount of a film deposited on the metal substrate is likely to decrease, whereas when the duration for applying an electric current is more than 600 seconds, a film that is not uniform is likely to be formed. [0056]<br>
According to the production process of the present invention, a film that is about 1 to about 300 mg/m2 (on a metal basis) can be formed on the metal substrate. From the standpoint of coating cost, and corrosion resistance and finish of the film after coating, it is preferable to set the deposition content to about 25 to about 150 mg/m2 (on a metal basis), and more preferably about 40 to about 120 mg/m2 (on a metal basis) , by suitably adjusting the duration for applying an electric current. [0057]<br>
With or without washing with water, the resulting film is subjected to setting at room temperature (less than 40°C) for 10 seconds to 600 minutes, or dried by heating at 40°C to 180°C for 1 minute to 40 minutes. The film of the present invention is thus prepared. [0058]<br>
In the present invention, by superposing an AC voltage (Va) with a frequency of 0.1 to 1,000 Hz and a peak-to-peak voltage of 1 to 40 V onto a 1 to 50 V DC voltage (Vd), a metal substrate of superior corrosion resistance and finish after coating can be obtained in a short period of treatment, compared to an electrolytic treatment using a conventional cathode electrolytic method (direct-current electrolytic method). This is because when an AC voltage (Va) is applied to the metal substrate under cathode bias, the surface of the metal substrate is<br>
activated, which allows a film obtained by electrolytic treatment using the treatment composition (I) to be uniformly formed on the metal substrate. Consequently, coated articles obtained by applying a coating composition on the metal substrate on which the treated film has been formed are excellent in corrosion resistance and finish. [0059]<br>
Further, the film obtained from the treatment composition (I) is a uniform, high-dense film (several tens or hundreds of run) with few cracks. Such a film is considered to contribute to inhibiting the corrosion of the metal substrate under the coating film because it blocks corrosion-promoting substances (e.g., O2, Cl~, Na+) . [0060] 1.4 Others<br>
From the standpoint of corrosion resistance, the surface-treated metal substrate obtained by the process of the invention preferably includes an additional coating film on the film obtained from the treatment composition (I). [0061]<br>
The coating composition used herein is not particularly limited, and may be an organic-solvent coating composition, an aqueous coating composition, a powder coating composition, etc. [0062]<br>
Preferable examples of coating compositions include commercially available coating compositions. Such compositions generally include a resin, a curing agent, a curing catalyst, and, if necessary, a surfactant, a surface-adjusting agent, and other additives. [0063]<br>
Examples of resins for use in the coating composition include epoxy resins, acrylic resins, polyester resins, alkyd resins, silicone resins, fluororesins, etc. [0064]<br>

Of these, it is preferable to use conventionally known cationic electrodeposition coating compositions that contain an amine-added epoxy resin, as compositions that generate a film excellent corrosion resistance and finish, which are the same as the goal of the invention. [0066]<br>
Hereinbelow, cationic electrodeposition coating compositions that contain an amine-added epoxy resin are detailed. [0067]<br>
Examples of such amine-added epoxy resins include polyamine resins that are generally used in an electrode coating composition, such as<br>
(i) an adduct of a polyepoxide compound with a primary mono- or polyamine, a secondary mono- or polyamine, or a primary/secondary mixed polyamine (see, for example, the description of U.S. Patent No. 3,984,299);<br>
(ii) an adduct of a polyepoxide compound with a secondary mono- or polyamine having a ketiminized primary amino group (see, for example, the description of U.S. Patent No. 4,017,438); and<br>
(iii) a reaction product obtained by etherification of a polyepoxide compound with a hydroxy compound having a ketiminized primary amino group (see, for example, Japanese Patent Publication No. S59-43013). [0068]<br>
The amine value of the amine-added epoxy resin is not particularly limited, but is preferably 30 to 70 mgKOH/g, and more preferably 40 to 70 mgKOH/g. The number average molecular weight of amine-added epoxy resin is preferably 1,000 to 10,000, and more preferably 2,000 to 5,000.<br>
[0069]<br>
In addition to the amine-added epoxy resin, the cationic electrodeposition coating composition may contain a curing agent, a curing catalyst, and various additives.<br>
[0070]<br>
Examples of curing agents for use in the cationic electrodeposition coating composition include blocked polyisocyanate compounds, such as aromatic, aliphatic, or alicyclic polyisocyanate compounds.<br>
[0071]<br>
Specific examples of aromatic polyisocyanate compounds include 1,3- or 1,4-phenylene diisocyanate, 2,4- or 2,6-tolylene diisocyanate (TDI), crude TDI, 2,4'- or 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), 4,4'-diisocyanatobiphenyl, 3,3'-dimethyl-4,4'-diisocyanatobiphenyl, 3,3'-dimethyl-4,4'-diisocyanatodiphenylmethane, crude MDI<br>

[0072]<br>
Usable aliphatic polyisocyanate compounds include, for example, ethylene diisocyanate, tetramethylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), p-xylene diisocyanate (XDI), dodecamethylene diisocyanate, 1,6,11-undecane triisocyanate, 2,2,4-trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate, lysine diisocyanate, 2,6-diisocyanatomethyl caproate, bis(2-isocyanatoethyl)fumarate, bis(2-isocyanatoethyl)carbonate, 2-isocyanatoethyl-2,6-diisocyanato hexanoate, etc.<br>
[0073]<br>

[0074]<br>
A blocking agent is added to the polyisocyanate compounds to block the isocyanate groups in the compounds. Examples of blocking agents include lactam compounds such as s-caprolactam, etc.; oxime compounds such as methyl ethyl ketoxime, cyclohexanoxime, etc.; aromatic alkylalcohols such as phenylcarbinol, methylphenylcarbinol, etc.; ether alcohol compounds such as ethylene glycol monobutyl ether etc. [0075]<br>
The amount of the curing agent is not limited and can be suitably determined based on the composition of the coating composition. The curing agent is preferably added in an amount of 10 to 70 parts by mass, more preferably 25 to 50 parts by mass, per 100 parts by mass of amine-added epoxy resin. [0076]<br>
The neutralization and aqueous dispersion of amine-added epoxy resin are generally performed by adding a curing agent such as a blocked polyisocyanate compound etc., a surfactant, a surface-adjusting agent, a curing catalyst, and other additives, and then neutralizing them with aliphatic carboxylic acids including water-soluble organic acids such as acetic acid, formic acid, lactic acid, etc. An emulsion is thus obtained. [0077]<br>
The cationic electrodeposition coating composition is obtained by adding to the emulsion, a pigment dispersion paste, and optionally, an additive and a neutralizer; diluting with deionized water or the like; and then adjusting the bath solid concentration to about 5 to 40 mass%, preferably 10 to 25 mass%, and adjusting the pH to about 1.0 to 9.0, preferably 3.0 to 7.0. [0078]<br>
Such a pigment dispersion paste can be produced by adding a resin for dispersion and deionized water together with a pigment and an organic tin compound as a curing catalyst, and by dispersing them using a ball mill, sand mill, etc. If necessary, the pigment dispersion paste may contain a neutralizer.<br>
[0079]<br>
Examples of pigments include organic or inorganic coloring pigments; extender pigments, such as kaolin, baryta powder, precipitated barium sulfate, barium carbonate, calcium carbonate, gypsum, clay, silica, white carbon, diatomaceous earth, talc, magnesium carbonate, alumina white, gloss white, mica powder, etc.; and rust preventive pigments, such as aluminum tripolyphosphate, zinc tripolyphosphate, zinc white, inorganic bismuth, organic bismuth, etc. Examples of organic tin compounds include dibutyltin oxide (DBTO), dioctyltin oxide (DOTO), etc. [0080]<br>
Examples of resins for dispersion include tertiary amine epoxy resins, quaternary ammonium salt epoxy resins, tertiary amine acrylic resins, and the like. [0081]<br>
In the process of the present invention, since the film obtained from the treatment composition (I) can prevent the corrosion of the metal substrate under the coating film, corrosion resistance is ensured even when a reduced amount of rust preventive pigment or curing catalyst is used, or the use thereof is omitted. Accordingly, this process is effective in reducing the cost of coated articles. [0082]<br>
Therefore, if a rust preventive pigment is added, the amount thereof is preferably 30 parts by mass or less, more preferably 0.1 to 30 parts by mass, and even more preferably 1 to 10 parts by mass, per 100 parts by mass of amine-added epoxy resin. The curing catalyst is preferably added in an amount of 20 parts by mass, more preferably 0.01 to 20 parts by mass, and even more preferably 0.1 to 10 parts by mass, per 100 parts by mass of amine-added epoxy resin. [0083]<br>

[0084]<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention, i.e., an embodiment of performing electrodeposition coating using a cationic electrodeposition coating composition as a coating composition will be explained below.<br>
[0085]<br>
A coating film may be formed on the film obtained from the treatment composition (I) by immersing the metal substrate that contains the film obtained from the treatment composition<br>
(I) in an electrodeposition bath filled with a cationic electrodeposition coating composition, and applying an electric current at a voltage of 50 to 400 V, preferably 100 to 370 V, more preferably 150 to 350 V, for 60 to 600 seconds, preferably 120 to 480 seconds, and more preferably 150 to 360 sec. Applying an electric current in the above-mentioned range is preferable in view of the finish and throwing power.<br>
[0086]<br>
An electric current is applied to the bath containing the cationic electrodeposition coating composition under the following conditions: an inter-electrode distance of 0.1 to 5 m, preferably 0.1 to 3 m, and more preferably 0.15 to 1 m, and an anode/cathode ratio of 1/8 to 2/1, and preferably 1/5 to 1/2.<br>
[0087]<br>
The bath temperature of the cationic electrodeposition coating composition is usually in the range of 5°C to 45°C, preferably 10°C to 40°C, and more preferably 20°C to 35°C.<br>
[0088]<br>
After the electrodeposition coating, in order to remove an excess of the cationic electrodeposition coating composition, washing is thoroughly performed using water, such as ultrafiltrate (UF filtrate), reverse osmosis permeate (RO water), industrial water, pure water, or the like so that no cationic electrodeposition coating composition is left on the surface of<br>
coated article.<br>
[0089]<br>
The baking temperature of the coating film on the surface of the article to be coated is 100°C to 200°C, and preferably 120°C to 180°C. The baking time is about 5 to about 90 minutes, and preferably about 10 to about 50 minutes. [0090]<br>
The thickness of the dried coating film is preferably 0.1 to 50 µm,   and more preferably 1 to 30 µm. [0091]<br>
2.	Metal substrate treatment process<br>
The present invention relates to a metal substrate treatment process comprising immersing a metal substrate as a cathode in a treatment composition (I), and applying an electric current for 10 to 600 seconds by superposing an AC voltage (Va) with a frequency of 0.1 to 1000 Hz and a peak-to-peak voltage of 1 to 40 V onto a 1 to 50 DC voltage (Vd). [0092]<br>
Regarding the substrate, treatment composition (I), DC voltage, AC voltage, electric current-application time, etc., any of those described above can be employed. [0093]<br>
Since the metal substrate that is treated by the metal substrate treatment process of the present invention includes the film obtained from the treatment composition (I), it is excellent in corrosion resistance and finish. Coated articles comprising such a metal substrate also have excellent corrosion resistance and finish. [0094]<br>
3.	Coated article containing a metal substrate<br>
Since the thus-obtained metal substrate of the present invention contains the film obtained from the treatment composition (I) , it has excellent corrosion resistance and finish. A coated article that comprises such a metal substrate also has excellent corrosion resistance and finish. Examples of coated articles include building materials, electric products, office<br>
equipment, automobile bodies and parts, etc.<br>
