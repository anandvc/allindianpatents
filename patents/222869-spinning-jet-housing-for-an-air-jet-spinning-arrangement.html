				<td>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Spinning jet housing for an airjet spinning arrangement<br>
T<br>
he present invention relates to a spinning jet housing for an airjet<br>
spinning arrangement for producing a spun thread from a staple fibre<br>
strand, comprising a flow channel which is enclosed by a tube-like wall,<br>
which in turn is penetrated by injector channels having a closed cross<br>
section.<br>
A spinning jet housing of this type is prior art in, for example, US patent<br>
44 80 435 or in German published patent application 37 32 708.<br>
The injector channels provided herefore have a very small cross section<br>
and must be exactly positioned so that a vortex current provided for the<br>
spinning process can be generated. In the spinning jet housing in US<br>
patent 44 80 435, the injector channels are drilled, whereby, in order to<br>
keep the bore hole as short as possible, an insert is applied to the area of<br>
the injector channels, which permits the drilling of particularly small<br>
diameters. The spinning jet housing in German published patent<br>
application 37 32 708, in contrast, is designed as a two-part component,<br>
whereby in one part-housing an injector slit is worked in, which is open<br>
on one side and subsequently completes the closed injector channel by<br>
means of using the other part-housing as a cover. In common with both<br>
varieties is that the injector channels are applied subsequently to the<br>
spinning jet housing, which naturally leads to difficulties in reproducing<br>
the exactness of the positioning.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to manufacture the injector<br>
channels of the spinning jet housing in a simple and cost-effective way<br>
and in particular to ensure exact reproducibility.<br>
This object is achieved according to the present invention in that the<br>
spinning jet housing, including the flow channel and the injector<br>
channels, is a one-piece component formed without cutting action.<br>
Spinning airjet housing of the type according to the present invention<br>
can, in principle, be manufactured using all possible types of pressure<br>
diecasting and injection moulding processes. It is however, expedient to<br>
manufacture the spinning jet housing from oxide ceramics as this is a<br>
part subject to wear. By means of<br>
correspondingly formed core inserts, the necessary hollow spaces, first<br>
and foremost the flow channel and the injector channels, can be formed<br>
in the known way at the stage of manufacture. As all the spinning jet<br>
housings are made from one and the same tool, the exactness of the<br>
dimensions and thus the reproducibility thereof is ensured for mass<br>
production, in particular in the case of the injector channels.<br>
The manufacture of the spinning jet housing as a one-piece component<br>
formed without cutting action permits a variety of designs of the injector<br>
channels for different airjet spinning arrangements. For example, injector<br>
channels can be arranged inclined in running direction of the staple fibre<br>
strand, while alternatively the injector channels can, of course, lie in a<br>
radial plane in relation to the running direction of the staple fibre strand.<br>
In the latter case it is advantageous when the mouthpieces of the injector<br>
channels are aligned towards a conical ring surface surrounding the<br>
staple fibre strand, said conical ring surface being inclined in running<br>
direction of the staple fibres strand and being formed in one piece with<br>
the spinning jet housing. This causes the compressed air currents, which<br>
generate the vortex airflow, to be deflected from the radial direction to the<br>
running direction of the staple fibre strand.<br>
Not only the necessary channels can be inserted, but also further<br>
important, functional components can be directly formed into the<br>
spinning jet housing according to the present invention. It is thus<br>
possible that the flow channel for the staple fibre strand comprises a feed<br>
channel, which is bordered eccentrically on one longitudinal side by a<br>
fibre guiding surface which is formed in one piece with the spinning jet<br>
housing. A fibre guiding surface of this type can comprise a known way a<br>
deflecting edge which acts as a twist block.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
These and further objects, features and advantages of the present<br>
invention will become more readily apparent from the following detailed<br>
description thereof when taken in conjunction with the accompanying<br>
drawings wherein.<br>
Figure 1 is a greatly enlarged depiction of an axial intersection of an<br>
airjet spinning arrangement comprising a spinning jet housing.<br>
Figure 2 is a section along the intersectional surface II-II of Figure 1 of<br>
the spinning jet housing only.<br>
Figure 3 is an intersection of a spinning jet housing similar to Figure 1<br>
whereby the injector channels have a different design.<br>
Figure 1 shows an airjet spinning arrangement, with which a staple fibre<br>
strand 2 fed in running direction A through a feed channel 1 is imparted<br>
a twist in a vortex chamber 3, so that a spun thread 4 is formed, which<br>
is then withdrawn through a yarn withdrawal channel 5 in withdrawal<br>
direction B. The staple fibre strand 2 can come from a drafting unit or<br>
another drafting aggregate. A fluid device generates a vortex current in<br>
the vortex chamber 3 by means of blowing in compressed air through<br>
injector channels 6 which project with their mouthpieces tangentially<br>
into the vortex chamber 3. The compressed air exiting out of the<br>
mouthpieces 7 of the injector channels 6 is drawn off by an air<br>
evacuation channel 8, whereby this has a ring-shaped cross section<br>
arranged around a spindle-shaped stationary component 9 surrounding<br>
the yarn withdrawal channel 5. The feed channel 1 forms, together with<br>
the air evacuation channel 8, a flow channel which is surrounded by a<br>
tube-shaped wall 10, which is in turn penetrated by the injector<br>
channels 6.<br>
Downstream of the exit opening 11 of the feed channel 1, a twist block in<br>
the form of a deflecting edge 12 of a fibre guiding surface 13 is arranged,<br>
which is arranged to a longitudinal side of the feed channel 1<br>
eccentrically to the yarn withdrawal channel 5. The deflecting edge 12 is<br>
located directly upstream of the entry opening 14 of the yarn withdrawal<br>
channel 5.<br>
In the airjet spinning arrangement, the fibres to be spun are held on the<br>
one hand in the staple fibre strand and in this form are fed from the exit<br>
opening 11 of the feed channel 1 essentially without any spinning twist<br>
into the yarn withdrawal channel 5. On the other hand the fibres are<br>
subject to the effect of the vortex current in the area between the feed<br>
channel 1 and the yarn withdrawal channel 5, which vortex current<br>
drives the fibres, or at least their end areas, radially away from the entry<br>
opening 14 of the yarn withdrawal channel 5. The threads 4 produced in<br>
the above described process have therefore a core with fibres without any<br>
significant twist extending essentially in thread longitudinal direction,<br>
and an outer area, in which the fibres or the fibre areas are wound<br>
around the core.<br>
Based on an idealized process for the purposes of greater clarity, the<br>
thread structure comes about in that the front ends of fibres, in<br>
particular those, whose following-on areas are still held upstream in the<br>
feed channel 1, land essentially<br>
directly in the yarn withdrawal channel 5, while, however, following-on<br>
fibre areas, in particular when they are no longer held in the entry area<br>
of the feed channel 1, are pulled out of the staple fibre strand 2 by the<br>
vortex formation, and wound around the forming thread 4.<br>
In any case, fibres are simultaneously bound in the forming thread 4,<br>
whereby they are pulled through the yarn withdrawal channel 5, and are<br>
also subject to the vortex current which accelerates the fibres<br>
centrifugally, that is, away from the entry opening 14 of the yarn<br>
withdrawal channel 5, and pulls them into the air evacuation channel 8.<br>
The fibre areas pulled out of the staple fibre strand 2 by the vortex<br>
current form a fibre vortex which runs into the entry opening 14 of the<br>
yarn withdrawal channel 5, the longer parts of said fibre vortex winding<br>
themselves spiral-like around the outside of the spindle-like component<br>
9 and being pulled in this spiral form against the forces of the current in<br>
the air evacuation channel 8 towards the entry opening 14 of the yarn<br>
withdrawal channel 5.<br>
With the aid of Figure 2 in addition to Figure 1, the injector channels 6<br>
are described in more detail below.<br>
According to the embodiment shown in the above mentioned Figures,<br>
there are four injector channels 6 overall per airjet spinning<br>
arrangement, each of which is provided with a mouthpiece 7, which is,<br>
as can best be seen in Figure 2, tangentially directed in the vortex<br>
chamber 3. These injector channels 6 are arranged in a spinning jet<br>
housing 15 in a way described below, said injector channels 6 having a<br>
closed cross section. The injector channels 6 extend in a plane radial to<br>
the running direction A of the staple fibre strand 2.<br>
An annular space 16 radially surrounding the spinning jet housing 15 is<br>
connected to a vacuum source in a way not shown. The compressed air<br>
gets from the annular space 16 to the individual injector channels 6 via<br>
axial recesses 17 provided in the outer contour of the spinning jet<br>
housing 15. The annular space 16 is sealed off from the outside by a wall<br>
of a housing 18.<br>
Directly downstream of the mouthpieces 7 of the injector channels 6 a<br>
conical ring surface 19 inclined in the running direction A of the staple<br>
fibre strand 2 is provided. Although the injector channels 6 lie in a radial<br>
plane, the compressed air existing out of the mouthpieces 7 is deflected<br>
by the ring surface 19 in running direction A of the<br>
staple fibre strand 2. The conical ring surface 19 surrounds the staple<br>
fibre strand 2, whereby the mouthpieces 7 are aligned tangentially<br>
towards the ring surface 19.<br>
In order to be able to manufacture the individual functional elements<br>
very exactly and repeatedly, in particular the injector channels 6 with<br>
their small cross sections, it is provided according to the present<br>
invention that the spinning jet housing 15, including the flow channel 1,<br>
8 and the injector channels 6, is a one-piece component formed without<br>
cutting action in addition, the conical ring surface 19 and the fibre<br>
guiding surface 13 with the deflecting edge 12 are also formed in one<br>
piece. Because of the danger of wear, the spinning jet housing is made<br>
from oxide ceramics, for example, aluminium oxide.<br>
The embodiment shown in Figure 3 has a- somewhat differently designed<br>
air jet spinning arrangement, whereby those components which are<br>
identical to those in Figures 1 and 2, are provided with the same<br>
reference numbers. A repeat description can therefore be omitted.<br>
Deviating from the embodiment shown in Figures 1 and 2, injector<br>
channels 20 are provided in the embodiment according to Figure 3 which<br>
are inclined in the running direction A of the staple fibre strand 2. The<br>
mouthpieces 21 of the injector channels 20 are again directed<br>
tangentially in the vortex chamber 3. In this embodiment a spinning jet<br>
housing 22 is also provided which is a one-piece component formed<br>
without cutting action. The injector channels 20 begin again in an<br>
annular space 23, which is connected to a source for compressed air (not<br>
shown) and from which the compressed air is fed via recesses 24 to the<br>
injector channels 20. The annular space 23 is covered on the outside by<br>
a housing 25.<br>
