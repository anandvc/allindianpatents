				<td>Red reactiye dyes, their preparation and their use<br>
The present invention relates to novel reactive dyes, to a process for their preparation and to their use in the dyeing or printing of textile fibre matenals<br>
The practice of dyeing using reactive dyes has recently led to higher demands being made on the quality of the dyeings and the economic efficiency of the dyeing process. As a result, there continues to ise a need for novel reactive dyes having improved properties, especially in respect of their application<br>
Dyeing nowadays requires reactive dyes that have sufficient substantivity and at the same time have good ease of washing off of unfixed dye They should also have a good colour yield and high reactivity, the objective being to provide especially dyeings havirig high degrees of fixing and good fastness properties The known dyes do not satisfy those requirements in all properties<br>
The dyes known from US-A-5,599,911 still have certain disadvantages in terms of the required properties<br>
The problem underlying the present invention is accordingly to find, for the dyeing and printing of fibre materials, novel improved reactive dyes having the qualities charactensed above to a high degree. The novel dyes should especially be distinguished by high fixing yields and high fibre-dye binding stabilities The dyes should also yield dyeings having good allround fatness properties, for example fastness to light and to wetting<br>

The reactive dyes of formula (1) contain sulfo groups, which are each either in the form of the free sulfo acid or, preferably, In the form of a salt thereof, for example a sodium, lithium, potassium or ammonium salt, or a salt of an organic amine, for example a triethanol-ammonium salt.<br>
TTie reactive dyes of formula (1) may comprise further additives, for example sodium chloride or dextrin<br>
The reactive dyes of formula (1) according to the invention may optionally concise further adjuvants which, for examjf^e, improve handling or increase storage stability, such as, for example, buffers, dispersants or anti-dusts. Such adjuvants are known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
The dyes of formula (1) according to the invention are suitable for dyeing and printing an extremely wide variety of materials, such as hydroxyl-grouß-containing or nitrc^en-containing frtjre materials. Examples that may be mentioned are silk, leather, wool, polyamide fibres and polyurethanes, and especially cellulosic fibre materials of all kinds. Such cellulosic fibre n^terials &amp;re, for examfie, natural cellulosic fibres, such as cotton, linen and hemp, and also cellulose and regenerated cellulose. The dyes according to the invention are sAso suitable for dyeing or printing l^cfc'oxyl-grouß-containing fibres present in blend fabncs, e.g. trfends of<br>
cotton with polyester fibres or polyamide fibres. The dyes according to the invention are especially suitable for dyeing or printing celluiosic, especially cotton-containing, fibre materials. They can furthermore be used in the dyeing or printing of natural or synthetic polyamide fibre materials<br>
The presait invention accordingly relates also to the use of the dyes of formula (1) according to the invention in the dyeing or printing of hydroxyl-grouß-containing or nitrogen-containing, especially celluiosic, fibre materials<br>
The dyes of formula (1) according to the invention can be applied to the fibre matenal and fixed to the fibre in a variety of ways, especially in the form of aqueous dye solutions and print pastes. They are suitable both for the exhaust method and for dyeing in accordance with the pad-dyeing method, according to which the goods are impregnated  with aqueous, optionally salt-contati^ng, dye solutions and, after treatment with alkali or in tte presence of alkali, the dyes are fixed, where appropnate with the action of heat or by stonrag for several hours at room temperature. After fixing, the dyeings or pnnts are rinsed thoroughly with cold and hot water, optjor&gt;aHy with the addition of an agent that has a dispersing action and promotes the diffusion of unfixed dye<br>
The dyes accordir^ to the invention are distinguished by high reactivity, good fixing ability £Mid a very good buiid-up behaviour. They can accordingly be used in accordance with the ffichaust dyeing method at low dyeing temperatures and require only short st^iming times in the pad-steam m^hod. The degrees of fixing are high and unfixed dye can be washed off easily, the difference between the degree of exhaust and the degree of fixing being remarkaWy small, that is to say the soaping loss being very low The dyes according to the invention are also suitable especially for printing, more especially on cotton, twt are equally suitable also for pnnttng nitrogen-containing fibres, for example wool or silk or blend fabrics that comprise wool or silk<br>
The dyeings and prints produced using the dyes according to the invention have a high tinctorial strength and a high fil»re-to-dye binding stability in both the acidic and the alkaline range, and furthermore have good fastness to light and very good wet-fastness prof^rties, such as fastness to washing, to water, to sea water, to cross-dyeing and to perspiration, as<br>
well as good fastness to pleating, to ironing and to rubbing The dyeings obtained exhibit fibre levelness and surface levelness<br>
The dyes of formula (1) according to the invention are also suitable as colorants for use in recording systems. Suitable recording systems are, for example, commercially available ink-jet printers for paper or textile printing, or wnting instruments, such as fountain pens or ballpoint pens, and especially ink-jet printers For that purpose, the dyes accwding to the invention are first of ail brought into a form suitable for use in recording systems. A suitable form is, for exampte, an aqueous ink, which comprises the dyes according to tie invention as colorants. The inks can be prepared in customary manner by mixing together the individual components in the desired amount of water<br>

The inks preferably have a total content of dyes of from 1 to 35 % by weight, especially from 1 to 30 % by weight and preferably from 1 to 20 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink. The preferred tower limit in this case is a limit of 1.5 % by weight, preferably 2 % by weight and especially 3 % by weight<br>
The inks may compsise water-mlscible organic solvents, for example C1-C4alcohols, e g. nrwBthanol, ethanol, n-prqjanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol or iso-butanol, amides, e.g. dimethytformamide or dimethylacetamide, ketones or kelone alcohols, e.g. acetone or diacetone ala)hol; ethers, e g. tetrahydrofuran or dioxane. nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ajmfwunds, e.g N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone or 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidone, polyaU$ylene glycols, e.g. polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol, C2-C6alkylene glycols and ttwoglycols, e.g ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butytene glycol, triethylene glycol, thtoctigiycol, hexylene glycol and diethylene glycol, other polyols, e.g gfycerol or 1,2,6-haxanetriol; and C1-C4alkyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols, e.g. 2-methoxy-etianol, 2-(2-meth0xyethoxy)ethanol, 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethanol, 2-[2-(2-methoxy-e^oxy)ethoxy]ethanoi or 2-[2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethanol; preferably N-methyi-2-pyrrolidone, diethylene glycol, glycerol or especially 1,2-propylene glycol, usually in an amount of from 2 to ^ % by weight, especially from 5 to 30 % by weight and preferably from 10 to 25 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink.<br>

The inks may comprise  thickeners of natural or synthetic origin, inter alia for the purpose of adjusting the viscosity.<br>
Examples of thickenws that may be mentioned include commercially available alginate thickeners, starch ethers or tocust bean flour ethers, especially sodium alginate on its own or in admixture with modified  cellutose, e.g methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, carljoxymethyi cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellutose, methyl hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose or hydroxypropyl meth^ cellulose, especially with preferably from 20 to 25 % by weight carboxymethyl celtolose. Synthetic thickeners that may be mentioned are, for example, those based on poly(metti)acrylic acids or poly(meth)acrylamides and also polyalkylene glycols having a molecular weigtit of, for example, from 2000 to 20 000, such as, for example.<br>
polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol or mixed polyalkylene glycols of etl^lene oxide and propylene oxide.<br>
The inks comprise such thickeners, for example, in an amount of from 0 01 to 2 % by weight, especially from 0.01 to 1 % by weight and preferably from 0 01 to 0 5 % by we^ht, based on the total weight of the ink<br>
The inks may also comprise buffer substances, e.g. borax, borates, phosphates, poly-phosphates or citraies. Examples that may be mentioned include borax, sodium borate, sodium tefraborate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium pentapolyphosphate and sodium citrate. They are used especially in amounts of from 0.1 to 3 % by weight, preferably from 0 1 to 1 % by weight, based on the total  weight of the ink, in order to establish a pH value of, for example, from 4 to 9, especially from 5 to 8.5<br>
As further additives, the inks may compnse surfactants or humectants<br>
Suitable surfactants include commercially available anionic or non-ionic surfactants As humectants in the inks according to the invention there come into consideration, for example, wea or a mixture of sodium lactate (advantageously in the form of a 50 % to SO % aqueous solution) and glycerol and/or propylene glycol in amounts of preferably from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, especially from 2 to 30 % by weight<br>
Preference is given to Inks having a viscosity of from 1 to 40 mPa s, especially from 1 to 20 mPas and more especially from 1 to 10 mPa s<br>

isothiazolin-3-one, iodine compounds, nitnles, phenols, haloalkylthio compounds or pyridine derivatives, especially 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one or 2-n-octyl-isothiazolin-3-or*e A suitable preservative is, for example, a 20 % by weight solution of 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one in dipropylene glycol (Proxel® GXL).<br>
The inks may also comprise further additives, such as fluorinated polymers or telomers, for example polyethoxyperfluoroalcohols (Forafac® or Zonyl® products) in an amount of, for example, from 0.01 to 1 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink<br>
In the case of the ink-jet pnnting method, individual droplets of ink are sprayed onto a substrate from a nozzle in a controlled manner. It is mainly the continuous ink-|et method and the droß-on-demand method that are used for that purpose. In the case of the continuous ink-jet method, the droplets are produced continuously, droplets not required for the printing operation being discharged into a receptacle and recycled. In the case of the drop-on-ctemand method, on the other hand, droplets are generated as desired and used for printing, that is to say, droplets are generated only when required for the pnnting operation The production of the droplets can be effected, for example, by means of a piezo ink-jet head or by thermal energy (bubble jet). Preference is given to printing by means of a piezo ink-jet head and to printing according to the continuous ink-jet method<br>
The present inventfon accordingly relates also to aqueous inks that comprise the dyes of formula (1) according to the invention and to the use of such inks in an ink-jet pnnting method for printing a variety of substrates, especially textile fibre materials, the definitions and preferences indkated above applying to the dyes, the inks and the substrates.<br>

(Tabble Removed)<br>
Table 2 shows that build-up of the dyestuff of formula (101) according to Example 1 is superior to the build-up properttes of the dyestuff of formula (110) known in the art. Furthermore, washing-off properties of the dyestuff of formula (101) according to the present invention are improved with respect to the dyestuff of formula (110).<br>
Degree of fixation of the dyestuff of formula (101) according to the present invenntion is 75%, whereas the dyestuff  of formula (110) known in the art shows a degree of fixation of only 66%.<br>
Dyeing procedure ll<br>
100 parts of cotton fabric are introduced at 70°C into 1500 parts of a dye bath containing 20 g/l of sodium chloride and 2 parts of the reactive dye obtained according to Example 1. After 45 minutes at 70°C, 5 g/l of calcined soda and after additional 10 minutes 2 ml/I NaOH (36°Be) are added. Dyeing is continued for a further 45 minutes at that temperature. The dyed goods are then rinsed, soaped at the boil for a quarter of an hour with a non-ionic detergent, rinsed again and dried<br>
As an alternative to the above procedure, the dyeing can be carned out at 80°Cinstead of at 70°C<br>
Dyeing procedure III<br>
0.1 part of the dye according to Example 1 is dissolved in 200 parts of water, and 0.5 part of sodium sulfate, 0 1 part of a leveling agent (based on the condensation produet of a higher aliphatic amine and ethylene oxide) and also 0 5 part of sodium acetate are added. The pH is then adjusted to a value of 5.5 using acetic acid (80 %). The dye bath is heated at 50°C for 10 minutes and then 10 parts of a woollen fabnc are added Heating is then carried out in the course of approximately 50 minutes to a temperature of 100°C and dyeing is carried out at that temperature for 60 minutes, after which the dye bath is allowed to cool to 90°C and the dyed goods are removed. The woollen fabnc is washed with hot and cold water and is then spun and dried<br>
Pnnting procedure I<br>
3 parts of the dye obtained according to Example 1 are spnnkled, with rapid stirring, into<br>
100 parts of a stock thickener containing 50 parts of 5 % sodium alginate thickener,<br>
27.8 parts of water, 20 parts of urea, 1 part of sodium m-nitrobenzenesulfonate and 1.2 parts<br>
of sodium hydrogen carbonate The pnnt paste so obtained is used to print a cotton fabric,<br>
and the resulting printed matenal is dried and steamed in saturated steam for 2 minutes at<br>
102°C. The printed fabric is then nnsed, if desired soaped at the boil and rinsed again, and<br>
subsequently dried.<br>
Printing procedure II<br>
(a)	Mercensed cotton satin is pad-dyed with a liquor containing 30 g/1 of sodium carnonate and 50 g/1 of urea (70 % tiquor pick-up) and dried<br>
