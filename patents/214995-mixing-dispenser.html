				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a dispenser in the form of an additive<br>
releasing container. The additive releasing container may be a<br>
bottle which provides a means for separately retaining a fluid<br>
and an additive (possibly in the form of a tablet such as a<br>
vitamin tablet or pharmaceutical preparation) and also a means<br>
for releasing the tablet into the fluid held in the bottle. The<br>
additive releasing bottle would include a means to enable the<br>
combined fluid and additive to be removed from the bottle,<br>
perhaps a little at a time with the bottle being reseated<br>
between dispensed amounts. The container mioht<br>
alternatively be used to dispense a powder into a powder.<br>
The actual substances to be mixed are not limited to just the<br>
above examples, however.<br>
MIXING DISPENSER<br>
TITLE<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
When the dispenser is in the form of a liquid containing bottle, bottle caps, designed<br>
to retain an additive such as a powder or tablet or liquid and to subsequently release<br>
the additive into an attached bottle upon manipulation by a user, are known in the<br>
pharmaceutical industry and more recently in the sports drinks industry. Examples of<br>
such discharge caps are disclosed in WO98/40289, WO00/27717, WO98/00348 and<br>
WO93/14990. Many of the prior art mechanisms are cumbersome and their size can<br>
cause difficulties in the packaging, transportation and display of bottles. Their bulk<br>
may also detract from the appearance of the product which is of importance in<br>
relation to certain products such as sports drinks. Others may be complex and<br>
difficult or costly to manufacture.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention resides in a dispenser comprising :<br>
a container having a first aperture therein and<br>
a first closure means for sealingly closing the first aperture<br>
wherein the container has :<br>
a second aperture,<br>
and a second closure means for closing said second aperture,<br>
said second closure means having :<br>
a pressing means operable to press inwardly towards said<br>
second aperture,<br>
a blister pack,<br>
locating means locating said blister pack to span across said second aperture,<br>
sealing means sufficient to ensure the second aperture is sealingly closable<br>
against leakage of the intended contents of the dispenser,<br>
the construction and arrangement being such that in end use the container holds a<br>
first substance and the blister pack holds a second substance and when the<br>
pressing means is pushed the blister pack is ruptured causing the second substance<br>
therein to mix with the first substance in the container through said second aperture,<br>
wherein said first aperture is configured to distribute the mixture.<br>
Preferably only a peripheral annulus of the blister pack is engaged by said locating<br>
means and the blister pack, in conjunction with<br>
said sealing means sealingly closes directly against the periphery of<br>
said second aperture whether the blister pack is ruptured or not.<br>
Alternatively the blister pack is held by said locating means in a<br>
suitable position within said second closure means to span across said<br>
second aperture but not to effect sealing closure of it and other parts<br>
of said second closure means acting in conjunction with said sealing<br>
means sealingly close the second aperture.<br>
Preferably the second aperture is at the base of the container.<br>
Preferably the pressing means is in the form of a flexible<br>
diaphragm which is an integral part of the second closure<br>
means.<br>
Prefeably the second closure means includes security means<br>
preventing the second closure means from being removed<br>
from said container once fully fitted.<br>
Preferably said second closure means is able to be partially<br>
fitted to said container in a manner enabling its subsequent<br>
removal to allow a blister pack to be added prior to fully fitting<br>
the said second closure means and prior to inserting the<br>
requisite substance into said container.<br>
Alternatively said second closure means may removably and<br>
sealingly close said second aperture even when partially fitted<br>
thus allowing the requisite substance to be inserted in said<br>
container prior to the placement of said blister pack.<br>
Preferably the second closure means is substantially in the<br>
form of a cup adapted to form the base of the dispenser and<br>
to shield said pressing means from inadvertant pressing, at<br>
least under the weight of the dispenser.<br>
Preferably said second closure means has a cylindrical skirt<br>
with a female thread adapted to mate with a corresponding<br>
male thread on a cylindrical wall forming part of the base of<br>
said container.<br>
Preferably said cylindrical skirt and cylindrical wall have<br>
mateable saw teeth so that when threaded sufficiently<br>
together the respective teeth progressively mutually engage<br>
and prevent counter-rotation.<br>
Alternatively or additionally the skirt and wall are welded or<br>
glued together.<br>
Preferably the blister pack contains a solid tablet.<br>
Preferably only the side of the blister pack facing inwards is<br>
rupturable and the other side is flexible but not able to be<br>
ruptured by operation of the pressing means.<br>
Preferably the inner facing side is a metal foil.<br>
Preferably the sealing means is an annulus of compressible<br>
sealing material.<br>
The second closure and container may be marketed empty and<br>
separately from the additive blister packs which might be user<br>
installed.<br>
One or both of the second closure and container might be reusable to<br>
some extent. Or the additive blister might be installed prior to sale<br>
which would be the case if the contents to be held in the container<br>
were not easily available to the end user, or for user convenience.<br>
Once the blister pack is installed, however, the arrangement usually<br>
desired is that the second closure becomes no longer removable from<br>
the container. This can be achieved by the use of one-way thread<br>
engagement or by ultrasonic welding etc.<br>
The container and first and second closure and blister might be<br>
heatable or coolable if required.<br>
ACCOMPANYING <br>
DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING<br>
The drawing shows a partial central longitudinal cross-sectional view<br>
of one type of dispenser according to the present invention in the form<br>
of a cylindrical bottle-shaped container, the baser of which is provided<br>
by the second closure means which is shown in place with a blister<br>
pack installed (the blister pack not being cross-sectioned).<br>
PREFERRED MODE<br>
The dispenser such as 1 may be provided with a container such as 2<br>
in any shape for example, spherical or cuboidal. The container would<br>
have a first aperture (not shown) therein and a first closure means (not<br>
shown) for sealingly closing the first aperture, said first closure means<br>
being openable to enable the contents of the container to be<br>
dispensed therefrom in use. Such a description encompasses most<br>
types of dispenser in various shapes.<br>
The characteristic of the dispenser of this invention, however, is that<br>
the container has a second aperture such as 3 in Figure 1. The<br>
second aperture may be located at any convenient place on the<br>
container, e.g. on the side wall, but for many uses the appropriate<br>
position is at the base with the aperture facing downwards.<br>
A second closure means 4 is provided for closing the second aperture<br>
3.<br>
The second closure means includes<br>
• a pressing means 6 operable to press inwardly towards the second<br>
aperture 3,<br>
- a blister pack 6 and locating means locating the blister pack to<br>
span<br>
across the second aperture 3.<br>
The locating means in Figure 1 comprise the shoulder 8 on which an<br>
annular seal 7 rests and upon which in turn rests the blister pack, and<br>
the internal skirt 9. There is an additional annular sealing ring 10 and<br>
the sandwich of the sealing rings 7 and 10 and the blister pack 6 are<br>
in practice compressed between the shoulder 8 and the periphery 18<br>
of the second aperture 3. Figure 1 shows the assembly<br>
uncompressed for clarity of illustration. The annular sealing means<br>
are in some circumstances optional. One of them might be omitted or<br>
both might be omitted in a circumstance where the contents of the<br>
container would be at no risk of leakage out of the container because<br>
of their nature, a sufficient sealing means being provided by other<br>
parts of the second closure means, as will be described. For example,<br>
the container may contain just a powder rather than a liquid and a<br>
rapid sealing may not be necessary.<br>
In the arrangement just described, the blister pack is described<br>
spanning across the second aperture 3 and also sealing across the<br>
second aperture. However the location means might simply hold the<br>
blister pack in a similar position but without there being any sealing<br>
across the second aperture 3 effected at all so that at all times the<br>
blister pack would be immersed in the contents of the container but<br>
would still be held in an appropriate position to be ruptured.<br>
Rupturing is effected by pushing the pressing means 5 inwardly<br>
towards the second aperture. The blister pack is preferably provided<br>
with only one side rupturable, that being the side 11 facing inwards<br>
towards the second aperture 3 and that side is preferably a metal foil<br>
such as a thin aluminium foil. The opposite side 12 is preferably a<br>
flexible plastics material.<br>
The blister pack Is suitably formed in a shape having regard to its<br>
contents such that pressure exerted through the pressing means 5 will<br>
be transmitted through the side 12 and through the contents of the<br>
blister pack to cause rupturing of the side 11 and release of the blister<br>
pack contents into the container. The easiest way to ensure the<br>
release of the blister pack contents is to compress them into a tablet<br>
where release in that form would be satisfactory for the purposes of<br>
the dispenser.<br>
Preferably the pressing means 5 is integrally formed as a flexible<br>
diaphragm portion of the second closure means. However, there could<br>
be a separate part perhaps snap fitted into place or screwed into place<br>
and a suitable construction is illustrated in the first filed application -<br>
(No. 523406) from which priority is claimed for this invention. The<br>
integral construction however has obvious advantages, especially if<br>
the blister pack 6 itself is not to form the seal across the second<br>
aperture 3. Where the blister pack is such that, whether ruptured or<br>
not, ft, in conjunction with the sealing means annular rings 7 and 10,<br>
always maintains a sealing closure across the second aperture, then<br>
the other components of the second closure means merely have to<br>
hold the blister pack in secure sealing engagement with the container<br>
and do not themselves need to effect the seal across the second<br>
aperture.<br>
Because of the possible uses of the container according to the present<br>
invention, it might be appropriate in some circumstances to ensure<br>
that the second seating means was able to be partially or fully fitted to<br>
the container. For example, there might be an application where it<br>
was undesirable to fit the blister pack and contents until immediately<br>
prior to the requisite mixing of the contents of the container. In such<br>
a situation, the second closure means may be required to be partially<br>
fitted without the blister pack to effect an adequate seal, e.g. by<br>
annular sealing rings 7 and 10 with the container, which would be<br>
inverted when the blister pack was to be added, the second closure<br>
means removed, the blister pack inserted with the seals suitably<br>
placed, and then the second closure means fully fitted to the<br>
container.<br>
In a case where the second closure means was in the form of a cup<br>
,as illustrated, with the cylindrical skirt 13, projecting downwardly<br>
sufficiently to shield the pressing means 5 from inadvertent pressing,<br>
the skirt might have a female thread 14 which mated with a<br>
corresponding male thread 16 on a cylindrical wall 16 forming part of<br>
the base of the container 2. Partial fitting may be assisted by careful<br>
control of the height of the inner skirt 9 in conjunction with the<br>
thickness of the sealing rings 7 and 10 so that they were not<br>
overcompressed during a partial fitting, but subsequently, when full<br>
fitting was required, further rotation of the second closure means 4<br>
with respect to the container 2 would enable the skirt 9 to bo<br>
deformed somewhat and mateable ramped teeth (not shown) provided<br>
at 17 in the top edge of the second closure means and a downwards-<br>
facing part of the container wall 16 would progressively mutually<br>
engage and prevent counter-rotation. The first closure means might<br>
be similarly provided where such security was necessary. Then<br>
rupturing of the blister pack which might result in a poisonous mixture,<br>
could take place-at a time and location where the used dispenser<br>
could be safely disposed of, while the results of mixing the two<br>
substances could be observed. The sort of usages envisaged in an<br>
application like that might be chemical or medical tests.<br>
In another application, the blister pack might be fitted initially when<br>
the dispenser was sold and to ensure that it was not removed from<br>
the container the second closure means might even be welded or<br>
glued to the container when fully fitted.<br>
In another application, the dispenser might be Intended to be re-usable<br>
and might be provided with or without any installed blister pack, but<br>
the user could install a blister pack of choice prior to filling the<br>
container with, say, water. The blister pack might contain some form<br>
of dietary supplement mixable with water but which should only be<br>
mixed immediately prior to use.<br>
In yet another application, the dispenser might be provided with<br>
another closure means identical to the second closure means for<br>
closing a different aperture in the container. That aperture might be.<br>
the first aperture and thus it might be possible to have a bottle, say,<br>
with a liquid in it, into which two different substances could be<br>
released into the liquid simultaneously or one after the other by<br>
utilising the present invention. Obviously, that concept could be<br>
extended to any number of apertures and closures.<br>
The essential advantage of the present invention is the very simple<br>
means by which provision is made for the separation of two<br>
substances and their subsequent mixing within the dispenser.<br>
The arrangement allows the use of a simple first closure means for the<br>
first aperture, such as a standard sipper top. The complications<br>
inherent in the closures discussed in the background section of this<br>
specification are entirely avoided.<br>
The term "blister pack" is intended to cover any type of envelope<br>
sandwiching a substance between two layers.<br>
