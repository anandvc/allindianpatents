				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
HOUSING FOR THE SILO COMBUSTION CHAMBER OF A GAS TURBINE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to the technical field of gas turbines. It concerns a housing for a silo combustion chamber disposed perpendicularly on a gas turbine according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
In gas turbines which, instead of the conventional annular combustion chambers arranged concentrically to the turbine axis, have a silo combustion chamber which projects perpendicularly above the horizontal gas turbine (see, e.g., US-A-5, 680, 753) , the silo combustion system and the fuel distribution system connected thereto are surrounded by a largely closed housing which is constructed on a platform- above the gas turbine.<br>
A known housing used by the applicant is reproduced in figs 1-3 in various perspective and side views. The rectangular housing 10 surrounds the silo combustion chamber 23 (depicted by broken lines in fig. 3a) disposed above the gas turbine 22. The housing 10 is constructed on a first platform 12 which is arranged on posts 11 above the gas turbine 22. The first platform 12 can be reached by a respective ladder 15 or 16 on opposite sides. The supporting structure of the housing 10 is a latticed basic steel construction frame 14 (figs 1, 3), on which a plurality of panels 20 are attached and fitted. Inside the basic steel construction frame 14, a second platform 13 is put in above the first platform 12, and this second platform<br><br>
13 can be reached by a further ladder from the first platform. Furthermore, the electrical equipment required for the plant is fastened to the basic steel construction frame 14, as is ventilation 18 which forces exhaust air outward from the housing 10 via an exhaust air duct 19.<br>
In the housing 10, a plurality of doors 21 are provided at the level of the first platform 12. A controller 17 is accommodated in a switchbox outside the housing 10.<br>
The known housing 10 is bolted in its entirety, such that it can only be assembled and dismantled with considerable effort. So that the combustion chamber cover 24 terminating at the top can be lifted without dismantling the housing 10 during maintenance of the silo combustion chamber 23 (see the two positions of the combustion chamber cover in fig. 3a), the housing 10 is of comparatively tall construction.<br>
The known combustion chamber housings for gas turbines having silo combustion chambers can therefore be characterized as follows:<br>
steel construction with attached panels<br>
panels are fitted individually on the steel<br>
construction<br>
electrical  equipment  fitted  on  the  steel<br>
construction<br>
tall  housing  on  account  of  lifting  of<br>
combustion chamber cover for maintenance<br>
Due to this type of housing, maneuvering of large components in the gas turbine hall is greatly restricted. In addition, during inspections or in the event of unscheduled opening of the gas turbine, the design of the housing compels the operator of the gas turbine to completely dismantle the housing in a complicated manner.<br><br>
In order to permit simple and rapid assembly and dismantling of the housing of the silo combustion chamber and the maximum possible size of the parts which are to be transported in the gas turbine hall, it is necessary to redefine the design of the housing of the silo combustion chamber from scratch.<br>
When redefining the combustion chamber housing, if possible the following points should be taken into account:<br>
The housing is to be dimensioned to be as<br>
small  as  possible  in  order  to  ensure  the<br>
highest possible  crane availability  in the<br>
gas turbine hall.<br>
All  the housing parts are to be  conceived<br>
such as to be as light as possible in order<br>
to  be  able  to  ensure  quick  and  simple<br>
handling.<br>
The housing should be capable of being split<br>
up into individual parts that are as large as<br>
possible in order to keep the number of crane<br>
trips  during  assembly  and  dismantling  as<br>
small as possible.<br>
If possible, the housing is to be capable of<br>
being dismantled without auxiliary tools.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a housing for a silo combustion chamber of a gas turbine, which housing avoids the disadvantages of the known housings and with which the requirements stated above can be met in a simple manner.<br>
The object is achieved by all the features of claim 1 in their entirety. Characteristics of the invention is the fact that the wall and ceiling panels form a self-<br><br>
supporting hood by being rigidly connected to one another. Due to the self-supporting properties of the hood, the conventional basic steel construction frame can largely be dispensed with, which simplifies and speeds up the assembly and dismantling of the housing. In particular, it is possible to lift the hood as an entity in order to obtain access to the combustion chamber.<br>
A configuration of the invention is characterized in that the wall and ceiling panels each have an integrated steel construction, the integrated steel construction comprising a frame for the respective panel . The integrated steel constructions of the individual panels not only give the panels themselves mechanical stability but form overall, after the connection of the individual panels to form the hood, an assembled steel construction which gives the entire hood the requisite stability. In this case, the wall and ceiling panels are each preferably of rectangular design.<br>
The assembly and dismantling are especially simple and flexible if, according to another configuration, the rigid connection between the ceiling and/or wall panels is designed to be releasable, if quick-release locks are provided for the releasable connection between the ceiling and/or wall panels, and if the quick-release locks are arranged on the frames of the panels. The quick-release locks each preferably comprise a clamping hook, which can be actuated by means of a pivotally mounted clamping lever, on the frame of the one panel and a pin on the frame of the other panel, the clamping hook engaging behind said pin during the clamping of the connection.<br>
The connection of the panels is further improved and stabilized if a U profile running in the longitudinal<br><br>
direction is arranged for connecting two panels within the frame of the one panel, which U profile accommodates a rectangular profile arranged on the frame of the other panel, running in the longitudinal direction and adapted in width.<br>
In addition, braces extending diagonally for the support can be arranged between panels connected to one another at right angles.<br>
Means for lifting the panels or the hood, in particular in the form of eyelet bolts, can also be advantageously provided on the panels or the hood.<br>
A further configuration of the invention is characterized in that the housing sits on a first platform which is arranged on posts above the gas turbine and has a first opening for the silo combustion chamber, and in that a second platform designed as an independent stand inside the housing is set up inside the hood on the first platform, said second platform, having a second opening for the silo combustion chamber. In this case, the second platform is preferably split into two parts for quicker fitting and removal. In addition, a guard rail can be fitted on the second platform for increasing the safety during assembly and dismantling. The second platform preferably also serves as a support for electrical installations.<br>
Another configuration of the invention is distinguished by the fact that the ceiling panels of the hood form a roof, and in that at least one opening which allows access to the interior of the housing is provided in the roof.<br>
A ventilation device can be provided for the venting of the  housing,  said ventilation device  being  arranged<br><br>
separately from the housing and being connected to the housing via an exhaust air duct. In this case, the exhaust air duct is advantageously equipped with quick-locking mechanisms for quicker fitting and removal.<br>

fig. 10 shows, in a simplified horizontal sectional illustration, the envelope, formed from the wall panels by means of the quick-release locks, of the housing according to fig. 4.<br>
WAYS OF IMPLEMENTING THE INVENTION<br>
The combustion chamber housing redefined according to the invention can be described in the following words:<br>
Panel design<br>
Instead of chi panels being attached to a heavy steel construction for forming a wall, the lighter steel construction in the revised construction is integrated in the individual panels. The individual assembled panels therefore form stable side walls and the roof. The  wall  parts  and  the  roof  are  constructed  and<br><br>
connected to one another using quick-release locks.<br>
Internal platforms<br>
In order to be able to maintain the silo combustion chamber in an optimum manner, a (second) platform is constructed inside the combustion chamber housing. In the combustion chamber housing known from the prior art, this platform is connected in terms of forces to the steel construction. Since this steel construction is now omitted, the platform. is set up as an independent stand inside the combustion chamber housing. So that quick removal and fitting are ensured, the platform is split in two.<br>
In addition, the platform serves as a support for all the electrical installations which have hitherto been fitted directly on the combustion chamber housing. In order to ensure working safety during dismantling and assembly, a guard rail is fitted on the platform, such that no-one can fall down when side walls are removed.<br>
Roof<br>
The roof of the housing has two access openings. A smaller opening above the FDS ladder (FDS = Fuel Distribution System) permits entry to an attaching device. A larger opening allows entry to the FDS, such that the FDS can be inspected during operation without having to dismantle the top part of the combustion chamber housing.<br>
Ventilation system<br>
Since the combustion chamber housing no longer has any basic steel construction frame, the ventilation can no longer be fitted laterally on the combustion chamber housing. In order to be able to ensure great ease of<br><br>
maintenance, the fans are re-installed at the base or at the outlet of the exhaust air duct. The exhaust air duct is likewise equipped with quick-locking mechanisms, such that no Tool has to be used for removing and fitting it and thus rapid work is ensured.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of a housing according to the invention is reproduced in figs 4 to 10.<br>
In a manner known per se, the housing 30 of fig. 4 is constructed on a bottom first platform 27 (fig. 5), which is disposed on posts 11 and has an opening 33 for the silo combustion chamber. Set up on the first platform 27 is an independent second platform 28 (fig. 6) , which is disposed on posts 29 and likewise has an opening 34 for the silo combustion chamber. The second platform 28 is surrounded by a guard rail 31. As can be seen in fig. 6c, the platform 28 consists of two parts 28a and 28b. A respective ladder 15 or 32 is provided in order to reach the first and second platform 27 or 28.<br>
Erected on the two platforms 27 and 28, the housing 30 is completed by a plurality of inherently stable wall panels 25 and ceiling panels 26 which are releasable connected to one another by quick-release locks (35 in figs 7-10) and form a self-supporting hood (fig. 9). As can be seen especially clearly in figs 7 and 8, the wall panels 25 or 25a, b and ceiling panels 26 each have a frame-like integrated steel construction 37, 38 which consists of a square profile and/or a U profile 42. Arranged on the square profile is a rectangular profile 43 which interacts with the U profile 42 of the adjacent panel and is matched to the latter in width. The quick-release locks 35 each have a clamping hook 41, which is actuated by means of a pivotal clamping lever 40 and acts on the adjacent panel behind a pin 39. The pin 39 is fastened to the outer side of the U<br><br>
profile 42 of a panel. The clamping lever 40 and clamping hook 41 are fastened to the square profile of the other panel, said square profile plunging with the rectangular profile 43 into the U profile 42.<br>
Eyelet bolts 44 (fig. 8, fig. 9), by means of which the panels or the entire hood can be lifted by the crane, are screwed in place on the top side of the panels 25 and 26. According to fig. 4, the roof of the housing 30 has two openings 45 and 4 6 which permit access to the interior of the housing 30 from above, the larger opening 45 permitting entry to the fuel distribution system FDS, whereas the smaller opening 46 allows entry to an attaching device.<br>
A ventilation device 47 is placed separately from the housing 30 and is connected to the housing via an exhaust air duct 19, which can be fitted and removed by means of quick-locking mechanisms.<br>
On the whole, the following differences between the conventional solution and the novel solution are obtained:<br><br><br><br><br>
