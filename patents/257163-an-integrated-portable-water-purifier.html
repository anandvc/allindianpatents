AN INTEGRATED PORTABLE WATER PURIFIER<br>
THE FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an integrated portable water purifier. The water purifier uses advanced microprocessor based technology. The present invention also relates to a method for purifying water, by filtration through adsorption media to remove harmful chemicals followed by ultraviolet treatment to disinfect the water.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Various residential water purification systems are known to people for many years. Many self-contained water treatment systems use at least one harmful chemical for disinfecting water. In most of the conventional water purification systems, the water is treated for microbiological content by leaching chemicals such as chlorine, iodine or silver salts into the treated water. In some cases there may not be any treatment process for microbiological content as these filters are simple dust or sediment removal filters.<br>
Most of the known water purification systems lack in proper measurement or indication of water quality to the end user. Also many of the water purification systems are designed to purify the water only once for biological content. As it is well known that the treatment of the water for biological content is performed either by addition of halogens such as chlorine and iodine or salts of precious metals such as silver. These chemicals leach and add to the drinking water which when consumed can result in health problems. Also, these chemicals are active in water for limited time and can protect the water only for a short duration. It is scientifically proved that there is always a possibility for microbial re-growth if there is no periodic microbiological treatment of water.<br><br>
Conventional water treatment systems with UV lamps are bulky and are fixed in line with water piping. These in line UV disinfections system are not portable. Also these systems are energy intensive, as they need continuous power requirement at high intensity irrespective of varying water flows. Therefore, there is a need for a water purifier, which is compact, portable and energy non-intensive with desired end result.<br>
The drinking water supplied to homes or commercial institutions comes in contact with many water body surfaces and travel miles of pipe length before it gets into the drinking water glass. The recent study indicates that the water leaving at treatment plant is not the same quality as the water at its final destination. The water in pipeline gets contaminated by the scales and films deposited in pipeline. The water at the point of use is contaminated through many sources, which are not visible to naked eye. Even the water treated at the entry of a system may also get contaminated before it is ready for drinking. Therefore, there is a need for an instantaneous water purification system for producing water free of chemical impurities and microbes while keeping the water always fresh, before the water gets consumed. It is also important that the water purifier should be insoluble and do not leach any chemicals such as precious metals salts as these are hazardous. to health if the limits are exceeded.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a water purifier, which effectively removes the contaminants found in drinking water and overcomes many disadvantages stated above. Another object of the present invention is to provide a water purifier, which is portable. A further object of the present invention is to provide the user with a displaying means to indicate the water purity based on predefine adsorption residence time. The required residence time can be adjusted and programmed to meet the specific contamination present in the water and the adsorbent combination can be used in cartridge.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows the integrated portable water purifier with a raw water chamber (1) for receiving water to be purified and a treated water chamber (2) for receiving treated water through a filter cartridge (20).<br>
Untreated water is filled into the raw water chamber (1). The raw water chamber (1) has a bottom opening (15) for fitting the filter cartridge (20) as shown in figure 2. The opening (15) in the raw water chamber (2) is provided with a locking mechanism (16) for preventing the filter cartridge (20) from rotational and vertical movement. The raw water chamber (1) is covered with a lid (11). The water gets filtered into the treated water chamber (2) through the filter cartridge (20) by gravity.<br>
Figure 3 shows the filter cartridge (20) with a conical upper portion (3) provided with a mesh cover for removing dust and suspended particles. A flat middle portion (4), which is a fine mesh filter located just below the conical upper portion (3) for removing additional suspended and dust particles. A lower portion (5) is having an insoluble granular purifier placed inside a conical vessel for filtering the water.<br>
The water to be purified from the raw water chamber (1) comes in contact with high surface area of conical mesh filter (3) where particulate and other suspended material present in the water are separated. The filter cartridge middle portion (4) just below the conical filter (3) further prevents the suspended particulate material into the<br><br>
treated water chamber. Also, the middle filter mesh (4) holds filter media of the cartridge and works as a top seal. The bottom portion of the filter (5) cartridge has an adsorption cum absorption media for purifying the water for undesired chemicals at molecular level. The bottom portion of the filter cartridge is perforated and has a mesh to hold the adsorbent in the cartridge. The water from the middle portion comes in contact with the adsorbent of the bottom portion of the filter cartridge where the cbntaminants are separated by physical and chemical adsorption process. Also, since the filter cartridge is suspended into treated water chamber (2) the water is constantly being purified. Once the filter cartridge is saturated with contaminants, it is replaced. The life and usage is also monitored and controlled by the microprocessor based controller (6).<br>
The adsorption filter media is selected from insoluble granular purifying agents such as activated carbon, activated aluminum, synthetic zeolites, silica gel, metal oxides such as zirconium or titanium oxide, and strong base anion resin, and mixtures thereof. This filter media used reduces the impurities such as toxic organic chemicals, chlorine, fluoride, heavy metals such as lead, mercury, chromium, arsenic etc. The filter media is nontoxic, insoluble and chemically and biologically stable. The filter media used has a very high kinetic and equilibrium affinity towards various contaminants. In view of its stability, the media is reused until the surface area and pore volume is saturated with contaminants.<br>
Through the filter cartridge (20), the water flows from the raw water chamber (1) and gets collected in the treated water chamber (2). Once the filtered water, in the treated water chamber reaches a certain level, a sensor (7) generates signal for irradiating with germicidal UV light by a UV lamp (8) to sterilize the water. After sterilizing the water, and based on feedback received from sensor (7) the displaying means will display the quality of the water in the treated water chamber. The conductivity cum<br><br>
level sensor (7) is located at required height from the bottom of the treated water chamber. The sensor (7) is located at a height proportional to the minimum volume of the water present in the treated water chamber. The sensor (7) is connected to the microprocessor based controller. The UV lamp (8) is located just below controller touching the water present in the treated water chamber. The lamp is lighted based on the presence of water and preprogrammed time intervals.<br>
Figure 5 shows a safety cover (14), which surrounds enclosing the UV lamp (8) to protect the user from getting exposed to any traces of UV rays. The lamp cover (14) is provided to give maximum protection and effective utilization of UV rays. The lamp cover (14) is preferably made of stainless steel with required curvature to maximize the UV ray utilization within the water. The lamp cover (14) is configured to effectively utilize the germicidal rays while protecting the user from exposure to UV light. The UV lamp cover (14) is fixed tightly to a lamp holder.<br>
The microprocessor based controller (6) as shown in Fig 4 is connected to a printed circuit board (17), battery (18), UV lamp (8) and sensor (7). The controller is provided with a box cover (19). The microprocessor is preprogrammed and configured to meet the water purification functionality. It takes the input from sensor and provides the output to displaying means. In addition, the controller will also monitor the voltage level of rechargeable battery and gives signal to the end user if the battery charge is low. The program logic is developed to handle all exceptions and errors during the normal function of the system.<br>
A timer is provided to measure and count the life of the cartridge and to display to the end user for replacement of cartridge within the stipulated time. All the electronic components are integrated and housed on* the printed circuit board (17). The printed circuit board (17), battery and UV lamp are made waterproof and housed within the controller in a suitable water sealed container.<br><br>
Preferably a handle (10) may be provided to make the water purifier portable and handy. The handle helps in easy handling of the filter. Figure 6 shows the water purifier with a flap (12) .through which the treated water is poured out.<br>
Two side holes have been provided to the container for providing a reset switch (13) and a re-charger socket (21). These are connected to the controller and access has been extended from main container through these two holes. If this main container is made of transparent material, the displaying means (9) connected to the controller will be visible to the user from the outside. The control box is hooked up from the handle top (22) and is extended into the main container.<br>
