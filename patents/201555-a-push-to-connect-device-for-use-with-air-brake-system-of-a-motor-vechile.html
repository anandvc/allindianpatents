				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a push-to-connect device for use with the air brake system of a motor vehicle, for providing an airtight connection between the ports of the various elements such as valves, actuators, compressors in the air brake system layout. The device is also intended to provide quick and easy connection and disconnection between such ports.<br>
Pttsh-to-connect devicetj are known to the art, but the device proposed herein has advantages over the known device?? a« set out hsreinafter.<br>
The push-to-connect device for use with the air brake system of a motor vehicle, according to this invention, comprises a fu'st assembly consisting of a tube; an insert provided with n t peripheral groove, said insert being nccommodated in the tube; a second assembly comprising a port member; a flexible retainer member seated within the port member and fastened in place therein, said retainer member having a plurality of ferrules on its periphery, whereby whenever the insert of the first assembly i^ pushed into the port member of the second assembly, the ferrules engage with the said r. groove in a snap-fit to connect the two assemblies together.<br><br>
The device proposed herein will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example, and not by way of lim itatiou, one of possible embodiments of this invention. In the drawings<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates an exploded view of the embodiment<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates an assembled view of the embodiment<br>
and<br>
Fig.3 illustrates a separate view of the retainer member.<br>
The embodiment will be seen to comprise a tube S and an insert H provided with a peripheral groove V. The insert H is accommodated in the tube S. A sealing ring E provided on the insert H prevents entry of dust into the valve ports through the clearance between the insert H and the uut Q. Ih'm arraQgement forms the first assembly.<br>
A flexible retainer member F is seated on a step K wi&amp;in the port member T and fastened in place therein by a nut G screwed to the mouth B of the port member T, thereby completing the groove for seating the sealing ring I.<br>
The arrangement just described constitutes the second assembly.<br><br>
The retainer member F has ft plurality oi ferniies D on its periphery, whereby whenever the insert H of the first assembly is pushed into the port member of the second assembly, the ferrules engage with th6 said groove V m a snap-fit to connect the two assemblies together.<br>
A second sealing ring I is provided within the port member T below the retainer member F. This sealing ring ensures air-tightness between the port member T and the insert H.<br>
To disconnect tho ilrs&gt;t and second assemblies from each other the nut G is unscrewed to detach the first assembly from the second a^sewbly.<br>
The retainer member has cut-away portions at J which enable the said member to contract and expand, flexibly, during inserticm »Tif'. mnoval from <hc port meinber t.></hc>
The land Y provided on the retainer member F helps to position thfi ^aid tn^mber F within the port member and also completes the .9,roove for seating the sealing ring I, ensuring air tightness between the insert and the port member.<br>
It will be seen from the foregoing description that<br><br>
*the   Revive proponed herein in eiuy to asHQmbla ind<br>
dismaitle.<br>
*tlil cnt-swiy poitioas of the retainer member enable the<br>
said member to flex roificietttly during assembly and<br>
^<br>
*The slit W in the retainer member renders it re-nssble. *time and effort reqnired for fittmg airline conneetions are snbstantially reduced.<br>
From the foregoing description it will also be sppreciated thit varioBs other embodiments of the device proposed herein are possible without departmg from the scope and ambit of diis invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
LA push-to-connect device for use with the air brake system of a motor vehicle comprising a first assembly consisting of a tube; an insert provided ,with a peripheral groove, said insert being accommodated in the tobe; a second assembly comprismg a port member; a f1exible retainer member seated within the port member and fastened in place therein, said retainer member having a phirality of fermles on its periphery, whereby whenever the fflsert of the first assembly is poshed into the port member of the second assembly, the femilos engage with the said groove in a snap-fit to connect the two assemblies together.<br>
2.	A push-to-conn^ct device as claimed m .Claim 1 wherein the insert is provided with a first sealing ring for preventing dust entry.<br>
3.	A push-to-connect device as claimed in Clahn 1 or Claim 2 wherein a second sealmg ring is provided w^in the port member, below the retainer member for enroring atr-tightness between the ioe^it ttid the pott n ember.<br><br>
r<br>
4.	A pttsh-to-coDBect device as claimed in ny one of<br>
(he preceding Claims wherein tfie retamer member is<br>
sealed on a step within the port member, thereby<br>
completing the groove for the second sealing rmg.<br>
5.	A pnsh-to-oonnect device as claimed in any one of ttia preceding Claims wherein the retainer member is fastened in place inside the port member by anut<br>
6.	A pnsh-to-conneot device as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims wherein the retainer member has caUtiwvf portions.<br>
.   7. A pnsh'to-connoct device as claimed in any one of the<br>
preceding Claims wherem the retainer member is<br>
provided with a slit	^<br>
i<br>
8.	A pnsh-to-connect device as claimed in any one of the<br>
preceding Claims wherein die retainer member is<br>
provided with a land.<br>
9.	A push-to-connect device for use with the air braking system of a motor vehicle snbstantially as herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
