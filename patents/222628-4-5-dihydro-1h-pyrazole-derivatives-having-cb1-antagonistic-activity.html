4,5-Dihvdro-1H-pyrazote derivatives having CB^antaqonistic activity<br>
The present invention relates to a group of novel enantiomers of 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole derivatives having S configuration at the 4-position of their 4,5-dihydropyrazole ring, to methods for the preparation of these compounds, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more of these compounds as an active component.<br>
The above mentioned (4S)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazoles are potent Cannabis-1 (CB,) receptor antagonists with utility for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders.<br>
Cannabinoids are present in the Indian hemp Cannabis Sativa L and have been used as medicinal agents for centuries (Mechoulam, R.; Feigenbaum, J.J. Prog. Med. Chem. 1987, 24, 159). However, only within the past ten years the research in the cannabinoid area has revealed pivotal information on cannabinoid receptors and their (endogenous) agonists and antagonists. The discovery and the subsequent cloning of two different subtypes of Cannabinoid receptors (CB, and CB2) stimulated the search for novel cannabinoid receptor antagonists (Munro, S.; Thomas, K.L; Abu-Shaarf M. Nature 1993, 365, 61. Matsuda, LA.; Bonner, T.I. Cannabinoid Receptors, Pertwee, R.G. Ed. 1995, 117, Academic Press. London). In addition, pharmaceutical companies became interested in the development of cannabinoid drugs for the treatment of diseases connected with disorders of the cannabinoid system. The wide distribution of CB1 receptors in the brain, in combination with the strictly peripheral localisation of the CB2 receptor, makes the CB, receptor a very interesting molecular target for CNS-directed drug discovery in the areas of both psychiatric and neurotogica! disorders (Consroe, P. Neurobiology of Disease 1998, 5, 534. Pop, E. Curr. Opin. In CPNS Investigational Drugs 1999, 1, 587. Greenberg, DA Drug News Perspect. 1999, 12, 458). Hitherto, three types of distinct CBt receptor antagonists are known. Sanofi disclosed their diarylpyrazoie congeners as selective CB, receptor antagonists. A representative example is SR-141716A, which is currently undergoing Phase II clinical development for psychotic disorders (Dutta, A.K.; Sard. H.; Ryan, W.; Razdan, R.K.; Compton, D.R.; Martin, B.R. Med. Chem. Res. 1994. 5. 54. Lan, R.; Liu. Q.; Fan, P.; Lin, S.; Fernando, S.R.; McCallion, D.; Pertwee, R.; Makriyannis, A. J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 769. Nakamura-Palacios, E.M.; Moerschbaecher, J.M.; Barker, L.A. CNS Drug Rev. 1999, 5, 43). Aminoalkylindoles have been disclosed as CB, receptor antagonists. A representative example is lodopravadoline (AM-630), which was introduced in<br><br>
1995. AM-630 is a CBt receptor antagonist, but sometimes behaves as a weak partial agonist (Hosohata, K.; Quock, R.M.; Hosohata, Y.; Burkey, T.H.; Makriyannis, A.; Consroe, P.; Roeske, W.R.; Yamamura, H.I. Life Sc. 1997, 61, PL115). More recently, researchers from Eli Lilly described aryl-aroyl substituted benzofurans as selective CB, receptor antagonists (e.g. LY-320135) (Felder, C.C.; Joyce, K.E.; Briley, E.J.; Glass, M.; Mackie, K.P.; Fahey, K.J.; Cullinan, G.J.; Hunden, D.C.; Johnson, D.W.; Chaney, M.O.; Koppel, G.A.; Brownstein, M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998, 284, 291). Recently, 3-alkyl-5,5'-diphenylimidazolidinediones were described as cannabinoid receptor ligands, which were indicated to be cannabinoid antagonists (Kanyonyo, M.; Govaerts, S.J.; Hermans, E.; Poupaert, J.H., Lambert, D.M. Biorg. Med.Chem. Lett. 1999, 9, 2233). Interestingly, many CBt receptor antagonists have been reported to behave as inverse agonists in vitro (Landsman, R.S.; Burkey, T.H.; Consroe, P.; Roeske, W.R.; Yamamura, H.I. Eur. J. Pharmacol 1997, 334, R1). Recent reviews provide a nice overview of the current status in the cannabinoid research area (Mechoulam, R.; Hanus, L.; Fride, E. Prog. Med. Chem. 1998, 35, 199. Lambert, D.M. Curr. Med, Chem. 1999, 6, 635. Mechoulam, R; Fride, E.; Di Marzo, V. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998, 359,1).<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that the novel enantiomers of 4,5-dthydro-1H-pyrazole derivatives having S configuration at the 4-position of their 4,5-dihydro pyrazole ring of the formula (I), prodrugs thereof, tautomers thereof and salts thereof <br>
wherein<br>
-	R and R, are the same or different and represent 3-pyridyl or 4-pyridyl, or phenyl which may be substituted with halogen or methoxy,<br>
-	R2 and R3 are the same or different and represent hydrogen, alkyl (1-3 C) or dimethylamino<br>
-	R4 represents phenyl which may be substituted with 1, 2 or 3 substituents selected from the group halogen, trifluoromethyl, methoxy and alkyl (1-3 C)<br><br>
are much more potent and selective antagonists of the cannabis CB1rreceptor than the correspondence R~enantiomer.<br>
Due to the potent CB1} antagonistic activity the compounds according to the invention are suitable for use in the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as psychosis, anxiety, depression, attention deficits, memory disorders and appetite disorders, obesity, neurological disorders such as dementia, distonia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, Tourette's syndrome, cerebral ischaemia, as well as for the treatment of pain disorders and other CNS-diseases involving cannabinoid neurotransmission, and in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and cardiovascular disorders.<br>
The affinity of the compounds of the invention for cannabinoid CB1, receptors was determined using membrane preparations of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in which the human cannabis CB1, receptor is stably transfected in conjunction with [3H]CP-55,940 as radioligand. After incubation of a freshly prepared cell membrane preparation with the [3H]-ligand, with or without addition of compounds of the invention, separation of bound and free ligand was performed by filtration over glassfiber filters. Radioactivity on the filter was measured by liquid scintillation counting.<br>
The cannabinoid CB1t antagonistic activity of compounds of the invention was determined by functional studies using CHO cells in which human cannabinoid CB1, receptors are stably expressed. Adenylyl cyclase was stimulated using forskolin and measured by quantifying the amount of accumulated cyclic AMP. Concomitant activation of CB1T receptors by CB1, receptor agonists (e.g. CP-55f940 or (R)-WIN-55,212-2) can attenuate the forskolin-induced accumulation of cAMP in a concentration-dependent manner. This CB1, receptor-mediated response can be antagonised by CB1, receptor antagonists such as the compounds of the invention.<br>
The invention relates both to the E isomer, Z isomer and E/Z mixtures of compounds having formula (I).<br>
The compounds can be brought into forms suitable for administration by means of usual processes using auxiliary substances and/or liquid or solid carrier materials.<br><br>
The compounds of the invention having formula (III) (vide infra) can be obtained according to methods known, for example: a) EP 0021506; b) DE 2529689.<br>

Part A: A stirred mixture of 3-(4K^Iorophenyf&gt;-4.5-dihydro-4-phenyl-1H-pyrazole (5.13 gram, 20.0 mmol), 2-methyl-2-thiopseudourea hydroiodide (5.00 gram, 23.0 mmol) and pyridine (10 ml) is heated at 110 °C for 1 hour. After one night standing at room temperature diethyl ether is added and the precipitate is collected by filtration. This precipitate is washed three times with diethyl ether portions to afford a solid (9 gram). Melting point: -230 °C. This solid is dissolved in methanol (20 ml). To the resulting solution is successively added a 2N sodium hydroxide solution (12 ml) and water (200 ml). The formed precipitate is collected by filtration, washed two times with diethyl ether and successively with diisopropyl ether. The resulting solid is dried in vacuo to yield 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-4»5-dihydro-4-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamidine (5.1 gram, 88 % yield). Melting point: 187-189 °C.<br>
Part B: To a stirred mixture of 3-(4-chIorophenyl)-4f5-dihydro-4-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-1 -carboxamidine (0.50 gram, 1.68 mmol) and 4-fluorophenylsulfonyi<br><br>
chloride (0.34 gram, 1.75 mmol) in acetonitrile (10 ml) is added N,N-dimethyl-4-aminopyridine (0.020 gram, 0.175 mmol) and triethylamine (1 ml). The resulting solution is stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. After addition of a 2N sodium hydroxide solution and extraction with ethylacetate (400 ml), the ethylacetate layer is concentrated in vacuo. The resulting crude residue is further purified by means of flash chromatography (petroleum ether/diethyl ether =1/1 (v/v), followed by ethylacetate). Subsequent concentration in vacuo affords solid 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-N-((4-fluorophenyl)sulfonyl)-4-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamidine (0.55 gram, 72 % yield). Melting point: 214-215 °C<br>
