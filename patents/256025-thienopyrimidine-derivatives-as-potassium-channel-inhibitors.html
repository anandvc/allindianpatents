				<td>THIENOPYRIMIDINE DERIYATIVKfi AS POTASSIDM CHANNEL INHIBITORS<br>
The present invention relates. to tnienopyrimidine compounds which are potassium channel inhibitors. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds and their use in the treatment of arrhythmia are also provided.<br>
Ion channels are proteins that spân the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and provide an aqueous pathway through which specific ions such as Na4", K1", Ca2"1" and CI' can pass (Herbert, 1998). Potassium channels represent the largest and most diverse sub-group of ion channels and they play a central role in rcgulating the membrane potenţial and controlling ccllular excitability (Armstrong &amp; Htlle, 1998). Potassium channels have been categorized into gene families based on their amino acid sequence and their biophysical properties (for nomenclature see Gutman et al., 2003).<br>
Compounds which modulate potassium channels have multiple therapeutic applications in several disease arcaş including cardiovascular, neuronal, auditory, renal, metabolic and cell proliferation (Shieh et al., 2000; Ford et al., 2002). More specifically potassium channels such as Kv4.3, Kir2.1, hERG, KCNQl/minK, and Kvl.5 are involved in the repolarisation phase of the action potenţial in cardiac myocytes. These potassium channels subtypes have been associated with cardiovascular diseases and disorders including long QT syndrome, hypertrophy, ventricular fibrillation, and atrial fibrillation, all of which can căuşe cardiac failure and fatality (Marban, 2002).<br>
The human delayed rcctifier voltage gated potassium channel subunit, Kvl.5, is exclusively expressed in atrial myocytes and is believed to offer therapeutic opportunities for the management of atrial fibrillation for several different reasons (see review of Brendel and Peukert, 2002): (i) There is evidence that Kvl.5 underlies the cardiac ultrarapid delayed rectifier (Kv^) physiological current in humans due to similar biophysical and phannacological properties (Wang et al, 1993; and Fedida et al., 1993). This nas been supported with antisense oligonucleotides to Kvl.5 which have been shown to reduce Kv(Urj amplitude in human atrial myocytes (Feng et al., 1997). (ii)<br>
electrophysiological recordings have demonstrated tfaat Kv(ttr) is selectively expressed in atiial myocytes, and therefbre avoids inducing potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia through interfering with ventricular repolarisation (Amos et al., 1996; Li et al., 1996; and Nattel, 2002). (iii) Inhibiting Kv(ur) in atrial fibriUation-type human atrial myocytes prolonged the action potenţial duration compared to normal healthy human atrial myocytes (Courtemanche et al, 1999). (iv) Prolonging the action potenţial duration by selectively inhibiting Kvl.S could present safer pharmacological interventions for protecting against atrial re-entrant arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter compared to tradiţional class m ana'arrythmics, by prolonging the atrial refractory period while leaving ventricular refractorincss unaltered (Nattel et ai., 1999, Knobloch et al., 2002; and Wirth et al., 2003). Class m antian^mniics have been widely reported as a preferred method for treating cardiac arrhythmias (Cdatsky et al, 1990).<br>
Tradiţional and novei clus OI antiarrythmic potassium channel blockers have been reported to have • mectuaism of action by directly modulating Kvl.S or Kv(Dr). The known class m antiarrythmics ambasilide (Feng et al. , 1997), quinidine (Wang et al., 1995), clofiliura (Malayev et al., 1995) and bertosamil (Godreau et al., 2002) have all been reported as potassium channel blockers of Kv(Ur) in human atrial myocytes. The novei benzopynn derivative, NDM42, blocks Kvl.S channels, prolongs the atrial refractory period and terminatos atrial fibrillation and flutter in in vivo canine models (Matsuda et al., 2001), and S9947 inhibited Kvl.S stably expressed in both Xenopus oocytes and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and KV(ur) in native rât and human cardiac myocytes (Bachmann et al, 2001). Elsewhere, other novei potassium channel modulators which target Kvl.S or Kv(ur) have been described for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, these include biphenyls (Peukert et al 2003), thiophene carboxylic acid amides (WO0248131), bisaryl derivatives (WO0244137, WO0246162), carbonamide derivatives (WO0100573, WO0125189) anthranillic acid amides (WO2002100825, WO02088073, WO02087568), dihydropyrimidines (WO0140231), cycloakyl derivatives (WO03063797), indane derivatives (WO0146155 WO9804521), tetralin benzocycloheptane derivatives (WO9937607), thiazolidone and metathiazanone derivatives (WO9962891), benzamide derivatives (WO0025774), isoquinoline<br>
derivatives (WO0224655), pyridazinone derivatives (WO9818475 WO9818476), chroman derivatives (WO9804542), betvzopyran derivatives (WO0121610, WO03000675, WO0121609, WO0125224, WO02064581), benzoxazine derivatives (WO0012492), and the novei compound A1998 purified from Ocean material (Xu &amp; Xu, 2000).<br>
Thienopyrimidines have been rcported to be useful as anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, anti-osteoporosis and and-microbial agents amongst others. Although also reporteri as cardiovascular agents (acting through modulation of the phosphodiesterase group of enzymes or through modulation of the sodium/proton exchange system), thienopyrimidines have not previously been reported as useful agents for modulating ion channels.<br>
Thieno[2,3-<fl-pyrimidines substituted in the with an optionally benzylamine or phenethylamine moiety and a methyl group may serve as anti-inflammatory anti-osteoporosis agents et al. such compounds were shown to modulate activity of severa cell types including leukocytes which originate from hematopoietic precursor cells bone marrow. increased can lead various inflammatory diseases therefore cytotoxic could function drugs. are thought suppress cellular by binding integrins on surface preventing downstream signalling events. thieno heteroarylthiols aryl thiols arylmethyl heteroarylamines hydroxyl chloro groups also be useful this series inhibit induced expression adhesion molecules luminai vascular endothelial thus at site inflammation.></fl-pyrimidines>

After the 10 minute incubation, 50/il of modified EBSS which contained 145mM KCI, 2mM CaCl2, ImM MgSO4, lOmM HEPES, SmM glucose, pH 7.4, 290-300 mOsm, was added, and the cells were incubated for a further 10 minutes at room temperature. The high KCI EBSS was used to depolarise cells to a membrane potenţial that would activate Kvl.5 channels. After the final incubation 80fil/100ul of the reaction from each well was transferred to equivalent wells in a Packard "Optiplate" white % well plate and counted in a Packard TopCount liquid scintillation counter by Cerenkov emission. Percentage inhibition 86Rb+ efflux through Kvl.5 was calculated by normalisation to. 2.5mM 4 amino-pyridine control block of Kvl.5. Alternatively cells were loaded with 85Rb+ and quantified by atomic absorption spectroscopy. ÎCso determinations were derived from 10 point concentration response curves n=2 using the<br><br>

Kvl.5 Autopatch Electrophysiology Method<br>
The externai bathing solution contained (in mM): 150 NaCl, 10 KC1, 100 Potassium Gluconate, 3 MgCfe, l CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Patch pipettes were filled with an electrode solution of composition (in mM): 160 KC1,0.5 MgCfc, 10 HEPES, l EGTA, pH 7.4 with KOH.<br>
Compounds were dissolved in DMSO (100 %) and made up in the externai bather at a concentration of lyM. AII experimente were conducted at room temperature (22-24°C).<br>
A cell suspension (10 ml), with a density of 100,000 cells/ml, was aliquoted into a 15ral centrifuge tube and transferred to an incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) for approximately one hour before use. Foilowing 60 min incubation, a tube was taken and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 4 mins at room temperature. 9.5 ml supernatant was thence discarded, leaving a cell pellet at the bottom of the tube. The pellet was then resuspended using 100 ui of cold (4 °C), filtered (0.22 ujtn), 0.2 % BSA/bathcr solution (0.02g BSA/lOml bather). The bottom of the tube was manually agitated gently until the solution became cloudy with cells. The 100 ui cell resuspension solution was then stored on the bench at 4 °C (using a Peltier-based temperature control device) undi used.<br>
A length of capillary glass (1B150F-4, WPI) was dipped into the cell suspension solution, such that - 3 cm column of fluid was taken up by capillary action. A Ag/AgCl wire was dropped into the non-dipped end of the capillary also. The outside of the solution-filled end of the capillary was then dried and the capillary was loaded into the AutoPatch™. Borosilicate glass patch pipettes (from l.Smm OD, thin-walled filamented, GC150-TF capillary glass, Harvard) were pulled using a DMZ pipette puller (Zeitz Instruments), and were back-filled using the internai pipette solution, being careful that no bubbles remain at the tip or in the body of the pipette. Patch pipettes typically hâd resistances of 2.3-3.5 M&amp;. Once filled, the pipette tip and a proportion of the shaft (~ 15 mm) were dipped into Sigmacote (Sigma). The recording pipette was then loaded into the AutoPatch™.<br><br>
Automated patch-clamping was initiated by the operator, but thereafter AutoPatch.exe continued the experiment providing that pre-set conditions and criteria were satisfied.<br>
Whole cell patch-clamp recoidings were made using the AutoPatch™ rig, which incorporated an EPC9 amplifier (HEKA, Germany) under control of Puise software (v8.54, HEKA, Germany), a motion controller with 2 translators (Newport, UK), valve controller (VF1) and a c-level suction device all at room temperature (22-24°C). This equipment was completely under the control of AutoPatch.exe and operator intervention was only made when there was a requirement to refill the drug reservoirs or to prevent the loss of a cell due to a technical error. Cells with an Rseries greater than 18 MQ were discounted from the experiment.<br>
Qualification stages prior to perfusion and drug application ensured that the observed current met the criteria for the experiment Only those cells with an /K &gt; 500 pA were used for experimente. Cells were continuously perfused with externai solution at a flow rate of 1.8-2 ml/minute. The perfusion chamber hâd a working volume of 80-85fJl and allowed for rapid exchange of drug solutions. Online analysis of the HKV1.5 current during the application of compounds was performed by the AutoPatch™ software. Voltage-step protocols and analysis of data was performed as described for convenţional electrophysiology.<br>
Electrophysiology voltage-step protocols and analysis of data was performed as follows. Data was sampled at SkHz, and filtered with a -3 dB bandwidth of 2.5kHz. Cells were held at a voltage of -80mV. Currents were evoked to a voltage step for lOOOms in duraţion at OmV every 5s. Currents were analysed using Pulsefit software (v8.54, HEKA, Germany), with the total charge measured during the whole of the voltage step. All other plots were produced using Igor Pro (WaveMetrics).<br>
