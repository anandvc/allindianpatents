				<td>APPARATUS FOR SYNTHESIZING AN OXIDANT<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to an apparatus for the preparation of an<br>
oxidant in solution. More specifically, the present invention relates to an apparatus for the<br>
synthesis of ferrate.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002] Ferrate is a strong oxidant that can react with a variety of inorganic or<br>
organic reducing agents and substrates (R. L. Bartzatt, J. Carr, Trans. Met. Chem., Vol. 11<br>
(11), pp. 414-416 (1986); T. J. Audette, J. Quail, and P. Smith, J. Terr. Lett., Vol. 2, pp.<br>
279-282 (1971); D. Darling, V. Kumari, and J. BeMiller, J. Terr. Lett., Vol. 40, p. 4143<br>
(1972); and R. K. Murmann and H. J. Goff, J. Am. Chem. Soc, Vol. 93, p. 6058-6065<br>
(1971)). Ferrate can act as a selective oxidant for synthetic organic studies and is capable<br>
of oxidizing/removing a variety of organic and inorganic compounds from, and of<br>
destroying many contaminants in, aqueous and non-aqueous media.<br>
[0003] Ferrate is of particular interest to water treatment because it provides a<br>
suitable mechanism for self-removal of ferrate from solution. In all oxidation reactions, the<br>
final iron product is the non-toxic ferric ion which forms hydroxide oligomers. Eventually<br>
flocculation and settling occur which remove suspended particulate matter.<br>
[0004] The use of ferrate may therefore provide a safe, convenient, versatile and<br>
cost effective alternative to current approaches for water, wastewater, and sludge treatment. .<br>
In this regard, ferrate is an environmentally friendly oxidant that represents a viable<br>
substitute for other oxidants, particularly chromate and chlorine, which are of<br>
environmental concern. Ferric oxide, typically known as rust, is the iron product of ferrate<br>
reduction. Therefore, ferrate has the distinction of being an "environmentally safe" oxidant.<br>
Although the oxidation reactions with ferrate appear similar to those known for MnO4 and<br>
CrO42-, ferrate exhibits greater functional group selectivity with higher rate of reactivity in<br>
its oxidations and generally reacts to produce a cleaner reaction products.<br>
[0005] U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0155044A1, published<br>
October 24, 2002, and entitled "METHODS OF SYNTHESIZING AN OXIDANT AND<br>
APPLICATIONS THEREOF," describes a process by which ferrate is produced and<br>
methods of using ferrate. The Publication also describes generally devices that can be used<br><br>
for the synthesis of ferrate. However, there exists a need in the art for an efficient device<br>
for the synthesis of ferrate at a site proximal to the site of use.<br>
i<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0006] Disclosed herein is a device for the preparation, and more specifically,<br>
the synthesis of ferrate. In one embodiment, the device comprises at least one container to<br>
hold starting materials; a measuring unit to measure an amount of said starting materials; a<br>
mixer to mix said measured amount of said starting materials; a reaction chamber, wherein<br>
said mixed starting materials react to produce ferrate; and a drain through which said ferrate<br>
may be obtained; wherein said drain is preferably located at a site proximal to the site of<br>
use of said ferrate.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
[0013] A device for the synthesis of ferrate is disclosed. The device is capable<br>
of producing ferrate and may be optimized to perform the processes and methods set forth<br>
in the U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0155044A1, published October 24,<br>
2002, and entitled "METHODS OF SYNTHESIZING AN OXIDANT AND<br>
APPLICATIONS THEREOF," which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its<br>
entirety, including any drawings.<br>
[0014] In certain embodiments, the disclosed device is located at a generation<br>
site, which is proximal to a site of use. As used herein, the terms "site of generation" or<br>
"generation site" refer to the site where the device for the generation of ferrate is located.<br>
In one embodiment exemplified herein, the generation site includes a reaction chamber for<br>
the generation of ferrate. The terms "site of use," "use site," or "treatment site" refer to the<br><br>
site where the ferrate is contacted with the object it is to oxidize, synthesize, disinfect,<br>
clean, plate, encapsulate, adsorb, coprecipitate, or coagulate.<br>
[0015] The terms "close proximity" and "proximal" are generally used<br>
interchangeably herein. These terms are used to refer to the relative locations of the<br>
generation site and the use site. The two sites are proximal to each other when they are<br>
located when the two sites are within a distance that allows for the ferrate to travel the<br>
distance within a half-life of its decomposition. "Half-life" of a decomposition is<br>
understood to be the amount of time it takes for one half of the material present to undergo<br>
decomposition. The half-life for any given ferrate composition will depend on the<br>
conditions under which the ferrate is generated and/or stored. Thus, for example, the<br>
temperature, concentration of base, concentration of oxidizing agent, presence of<br>
impurities, or agitation will all tend to affect the half-life of the ferrate composition.<br>
However, the half-life can be readily measured by those having ordinary skill in the art<br>
using conventional techniques. Therefore, a generation site is "proximal" to a use site<br>
when the concentration of ferrate at the use site at the time of delivery is equal to or greater<br>
than one-half of the concentration of ferrate at the generation site. The distance between<br>
the generation site and the use site is defined in terms of the half-life and a length of time<br>
required for delivery, rather than simply in terms of physical displacement. Thus, the<br>
physical displacement between a generation site and use site that are in close proximity may<br>
vary depending on the half-life of the ferrate composition being delivered between the two<br>
sites and the rate at which the composition is delivered. Accordingly factors affecting both<br>
the rate of ferrate transfer and factors affecting the half-life will all affect the maximum<br>
physical displacement permissible for the two sites to remain in close proximity. Factors<br>
affecting the rate of ferrate transfer include, but are not limited to, the pressure generated by<br>
a pump used in the transfer, the temperature of the plumbing used in the transfer, and the<br>
size of the plumbing used in the transfer.<br>
[0016] In certain embodiments, the disclosed device creates a reaction mixture<br>
comprising an iron salt and an oxidizing agent. "Iron salt" or "salt of iron" refers to a<br>
compound that comprises an iron atom in an oxidation state other than zero. The iron salt<br>
used by the methods of the present invention may be produced in situ, i.e., by oxidizing<br>
elemental iron either chemically or electrochemically prior to its introduction into the<br>
mixing chamber or by performing the oxidation inside the mixing chamber. The iron atom<br>
in the iron salt will have an oxidation state greater than zero, preferably +2 or +3, though<br><br>
this oxidation state may be reached transiently as the iron atom is converted from its<br>
starting oxidation state to the final oxidation state of+4 or above.<br>
[0017] In certain embodiments the iron salt is in an aqueous solution. However,<br>
embodiments of the invention include those in which the iron salt is dissolved in a solvent<br>
other than water. Preferably, the solvent dissolving the iron salt is one which does not<br>
undergo oxidation in the presence of the oxidizing agent or ferrate. In some embodiments,<br>
the iron salt is provided in solid, crystalline, or powder form and is dissolved in the solution<br>
comprising the oxidizing agent. In other embodiments, both the oxidizing agent and the<br>
iron salt are provided in solid, crystalline, or powder form and water, or other solvent, is<br>
added to the mixture thereof.<br>
[0018] In certain embodiments, the iron salt may be selected from the group<br>
consisting of ferric nitrate, ferrous nitrate, ferric chloride, ferrous chloride, ferric bromide,<br>
ferrous bromide, ferric sulfate, ferrous sulfate, ferric phosphate, ferrous phosphate, ferric<br>
hydroxide, ferrous hydroxide, ferric oxides, ferrous oxides, ferric hydrogen carbonate,<br>
ferrous hydrogen carbonate, ferric carbonate, ferrous carbonate, and ferrous or ferric ion<br>
complexed with an organic compound, such as ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) or a<br>
polymer, or a combination thereof. All different forms of ferric and ferrous oxide are<br>
contemplated to be used with the methods of the present invention.<br>
[0019] An "oxidizing agent" is a chemical compound that oxidizes another<br>
compound, and itself is reduced. In certain embodiments, the oxidizing agent comprises at<br>
least one of the following: a hypohalite ion, a halite ion, a halate ion, a perhalate ion, ozone,<br>
OXONE®, halogen, a peroxide, a superoxide, a peracid, a salt of a peracid, and Caro's acid,<br>
or a combination thereof. Throughout the present specification, the term "OXONE®" refers<br>
to potassium peroxymonopersulfate or potassium monopersulfate, or a mixture thereof.<br>
[0020] Other embodiments include, but are not limited to, those in which the<br>
oxidizing agent comprises a hypohalite" ion selected from the group consisting of the<br>
hypochlorite ion, the hypobromite ion, and the hypoiodite ion. In other embodiments of the<br>
invention, the oxidizing agent comprises a halite ion selected from the group consisting of<br>
the chlorite ion, the bromite ion, and the iodite ion. In yet other embodiments of the<br>
invention, the oxidizing agent comprises a halate ion selected from the group consisting of<br>
the chlorate ion, the bromate ion, and the iodate ion. Certain other embodiments of the<br>
invention include those in which the oxidizing agent comprises a perhalate ion selected<br>
from the group consisting of the perchlorate ion, the perbromate ion, and the periodate ion.<br><br>
[0021] In certain embodiments, the method of producing ferrate further<br>
comprises adding a base to the mixture. The base may comprise a nitrogen base or an ion<br>
selected from the group consisting of hydroxide, oxide, sulfonate, sulfate, sulfite,<br>
hydrosulfide, phosphate, acetate, bicarbonate, and carbonate, or a combination thereof.<br>
"Nitrogen bases" are selected from acyclic and cyclic amines. Examples of nitrogen bases<br>
include, but are not limited to, ammonia, amide, methylamine, methylamide,<br>
trimethylamine, trimethylamide, triethylamine, triethylamide, aniline, pyrrolidine,<br>
piperidine, and pyridine, or salts thereof.<br>
[0022] In accordance with one embodiment, Figure 1 shows the system by<br>
which feedstock reagents are introduced into the device of the present invention. There are<br>
provided a plurality of containers 102 for storing the feedstock to be used in the synthesis of<br>
ferrate. Figure 1 shows one embodiment of the invention in which three containers 102 are<br>
needed, one for each of the iron salt, the oxidizing agent, and the base. However,<br>
embodiments of the invention in which more than three or less than three containers 102<br>
are used are also envisioned. For example, in some embodiments, no base is used and<br>
therefore only two containers 102 are needed. In other embodiments, the iron salt is added<br>
as a solid, and thus no container 102 for the iron salt is provided. Likewise, in some<br>
embodiments, additional reagents are used in the synthesis, and therefore, additional<br>
containers 102 are used.<br>
[0023] Each container 102 is attached to a hose or a pipe 108. Throughout the<br>
present specification, "hose" and "pipe" are used interchangeably. A "hose" or a "pipe" is a<br>
conduit through which material, such as the starting material or the reaction mixture or the<br>
product, flow from one part of the device to another part of the device. Hoses or pipes of<br>
the device of the present invention may be flexible or rigid and may be made of many<br>
materials known in the art, such as metals, for example aluminum, steel, brass, or the like,<br>
or polymers, such as plastic, PVC, TYGON®, or the like, or rubber.<br>
[0024] Hose 108 connects to a pump 104, which pumps the reagent out of<br>
container 102 and into the device of the present invention. Pump 104 may be a manual<br>
pump or an automated pump. In some embodiments, pump 104 is equipped with a<br>
flowmeter, which is capable of measuring the volume of fluid passing through it. In further<br>
embodiments, pump 104 is equipped with an electronic signaling device, which can either<br>
display the volume of fluid passed through it, or send the volume information to a processor<br><br>
in a control portion of the device, as described below. A variety of automated and manual<br>
pumps are known in the art and may be used with the device of the present invention.<br>
[0025] Hose 108 may be very short, such that pump 104 is attached to container<br>
102. In these embodiments, hose 108 goes down into container 102 to remove the material<br>
contained therein. In other embodiments, hose 108 is several inches or feet long such that<br>
pump 104 is located a distance away from container 102. Thus, in some embodiments,<br>
several pumps 104 may be located within one location in the device, each being connected<br>
to a container 102 through a hose 108. In other embodiments, each pump 104 is attached<br>
directly to a container 102.<br>
[0026] The fluid passing through pump 104 is delivered to the mixing chamber<br>
202 (Figure 2) through a hose 110. In some embodiments, a valve 106 may control the<br>
flow of fluid through hose 110. In other embodiments, no valve 106 is present along the<br>
path between pump 104 and the mixing chamber 202.<br>
[0027] Each container 102 may also be equipped with a hose 114 through which<br>
additional material could be introduced into container 102. Thus, in one embodiment in<br>
which the entirety of the device of the present invention is located inside of a box, the<br>
opening of hose 114 preferably protrudes out of the box to allow the operator of the device<br>
to add more starting material to each container 102 as the starting material is depleted<br>
through the use of the device.<br>
[0028] Additionally, each container 102 may comprise a drain 112, which<br>
preferably facilitates removal of the material from container 102. Preferably, the material<br>
thus removed is not substantially introduced into the device. The drain 112 may have a<br>
valve, which may be operated manually or automatically.<br>
[0029] Some embodiments of the present invention include those in which a<br>
measuring chamber is provided. The measuring chamber is depicted in Figure 2. In this<br>
embodiment, reagents are pumped out ofxontainers 102 by pumps 104, flow through pipes<br>
110 and optional valves 106, flow through pipes 208, and into a vessel 202. Vessel 202<br>
may have a number of openings 206 to allow for the material to enter the vessel. Openings<br>
206 may be at the top of vessel 202 or may be on the side of vessel 202. In some<br>
embodiments, openings 206 are at the bottom of vessel 202.<br>
[0030] In some embodiments, vessel 202 may have another opening 218, which<br>
is connected through a pipe or an air duct 220 to the outside. The pipe or air duct 220 may<br><br>
be fitted with a fan. The purpose of the opening 218 and its associated pipe or duct 220 is<br>
to remove any noxious fumes or odors from vessel 202 and its vicinity.<br>
[0031] In some embodiments, vessel 202 is located over a scale 204. As<br>
material is added to vessel 202, the scale 204 measures the weight of the material added.<br>
An operator may calculate how much starting material should be added for each particular<br>
synthesis based on various factors, including for example, the concentration of starting<br>
material. Scale 204 may have a display that indicates the weight of the material added.<br>
Scale 204 may also be directly or indirectly in electronic communication with pump 104,<br>
such that after a pre-determined weight of the starting has been delivered, pump 104 shuts<br>
off the flow of the starting material.<br>
[0032] In still other embodiments, scale 204 may be in direct or indirect<br>
electronic communication with any of valves 106 or 210 to shut off the flow of starting<br>
material into vessel 202. In other embodiments, the reading of scale 204 is done manually<br>
and when the operator determines that sufficient amount of the starting material has been<br>
delivered to vessel 202 the operator manually stops the flow of material into vessel 202.<br>
Vessel 202 may also be fitted with a valve 212, which can be used to drain vessel 202 if<br>
more than the required amount of material was added to vessel 202. Once sufficient<br>
material has been delivered to vessel 202, the material is then transferred downstream in the<br>
device of the present invention for mixing.<br>
[0033] In certain embodiments, when pump 104 is fitted with a flowmeter, there<br>
is no need for vessel 202 and scale 204. In these embodiments, the material flows directly<br>
from pump 104 through pipes 110 into the mixing or reaction chamber.<br>
[0034] Figure 3 depicts an embodiment of a mixing chamber 302. The starting<br>
material flow into chamber 302 through pipes 110 and optional valves 106. Chamber 302<br>
is fitted with a plurality of openings 310, the number of which depends on the number of<br>
starting reagents to be used. In some embodiments, chamber 302 may have a large number<br>
of openings 310 in order to provide the flexibility of adding as many reagents as is<br>
necessary. Any unused opening 310 may be closed off.<br>
[0035] As was the case with vessel 202, in some embodiments, vessel 302 may<br>
have another opening 312, which is connected through a pipe or an air duct 314 to the<br>
outside. The pipe or air duct 314 may be fitted with a fan. The fan may be the same or a<br>
different fan than the one connected to the pipe or air duct 220. The purpose of the opening<br><br>
312 and its associated pipe or duct 314 is to remove any noxious fumes or odors from<br>
vessel 302 and its vicinity.<br>
[0036] Vessel 302 may also be fitted with a mixer 304. Mixer 304 may be a<br>
mechanical mixer that mixes the material within vessel 302 by rotation. In other<br>
embodiments, mixer 304 is an agitator. In other embodiments, mixer 304 is an eductor. In<br>
further embodiments, mixer 304 is a tank mixing eductor, a turbulent flow nozzle, a static<br>
mixer, a diffuser, a disperser, or a venturi tube. Mechanical mixers are well known in the<br>
art and any mechanical mixer is within the scope of the present invention. In other<br>
embodiments, there is no mixer 304. Instead, vessel 302 may be equipped with a pump<br>
318, which removes material from vessel 302 at one point and reintroduces the material<br>
into vessel 302 at another point. There may be a valve upstream from pump 318, e.g.,<br>
valve 320, or downstream from pump 318, e.g., valve 322, in order to better control the<br>
flow of fluid through the pump. Other modes of mixing are also contemplated.<br>
[0037] In some embodiments, vessel 302 is fitted with a temperature control<br>
device. In one embodiment, the temperature control device is a jacket around vessel 302,<br>
through which a fluid, either liquid or gas, of a particular temperature flows and thereby<br>
heats or cools vessel 302 and the mixture contained therein. Other temperature adjustment<br>
devices currently known or later developed in the art are within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0038] Vessel 302 is fitted with a valve 308 through which the reaction mixture<br>
within vessel 302 may be discarded, if for any reason the reaction mixture is not needed.<br>
Otherwise, the reaction mixture can flow through pipe 324, which may optionally be fitted<br>
with a valve 306, into the reaction chamber.<br>
[0039] As used herein, the term "reaction mixture" refers to a mixture obtained<br>
after the starting material for the synthesis of ferrate are mixed together.<br>
[0040] In some embodiments', the device of the present invention does not have<br>
a mixing vessel 302. In these embodiments, the mixing chamber is a pipe. For example,<br>
pipes 110 come together to form pipe 324. The flow of material into pipe 324 causes the<br>
material to mix together. In some embodiments, the interior of pipe 324 may be fitted with<br>
materials that cause turbulence within pipe 324 in a greater degree that would occur in the<br>
absence of such materials. The added turbulence will cause the material within pipe 324 to<br>
mix together.<br><br>
[0041] Figure 4 depicts one embodiment of the reaction chamber. The reaction<br>
mixture enters the reaction chamber through pipe 324 and optional valve 306. A pump 404<br>
may be used in order to suck the reaction mixture into the reaction chamber. Once a<br>
sufficient quantity of the reaction mixture has entered the reaction chamber, valve 306 may<br>
be closed. Pump 404, then, circulates the reaction mixture through the reaction chamber.<br>
[0042] The reaction chamber comprises a reaction vessel 402. Vessel 402 is<br>
fitted with a plurality of openings 412, the number of which depends on the particular<br>
configuration of the device and the need for such openings. Vessel 402 comprises at least<br>
one opening 412. Any unused opening 310 may be closed off.<br>
[0043] As was the case with vessels 202 and 302, in some embodiments, vessel<br>
402 may have another opening 420, which is connected through a pipe or an air duct 422 to<br>
the outside. The pipe or air duct 422 may be fitted with a fan. The fan may be the same or<br>
a different fan than the one connected to the pipe or air duct 220 or 314. The purpose of the<br>
opening 420 and its associated pipe or duct 422 is to remove any noxious fumes or odors<br>
from vessel 402 and its vicinity.<br>
[0044] Vessel 402 may also be fitted with a mixer 410. Mixer 410 may be a<br>
mechanical mixer, as described above. Alternatively, vessel 402 may be fitted with a pump<br>
system analogous to pump 318 for mixing. In other embodiments, mixer 410 is an eductor,<br>
which causes the reaction mixture to mix as it passes therethrough.<br>
[0045] In one embodiment, valves 306 and 426 are opened, while valves 416,<br>
418, 428, and 408 remain closed. Once sufficient amount of the reaction mixture has<br>
entered vessel 402, valve 306 is closed and valve 408 is opened, while pump 404 is still<br>
functioning. Thus, the reaction mixture flows through valve 408, pump 404, valve 426<br>
opening 412, eductor 410, and into vessel 402, and then repeats the cycle once again. This<br>
loop may be referred to as the reaction loop. In some embodiments, there is a bypass loop<br>
that connects upstream from opening 412 to, downstream from valve 408. Once the bypass<br>
is employed, vessel 402 may be taken out of the reaction loop and the reaction loop may<br>
comprise a loop of pipes.<br>
[0046] In one embodiment, the reaction chamber is fitted with a measuring<br>
device 424, which can measure the concentration of certain ingredients in the reaction<br>
mixture. The measurement may be to detect the concentration of ferrate produced, the<br>
concentration of the starting materials, or the concentration of impurities in the solution, at<br>
any given moment. The measuring device 424 may be located anywhere in the device, for<br><br>
example, along the reaction loop, in the reaction vessel, at drain 432, or anywhere else in<br>
the device.<br>
[0047] The measurement may be automated or manual. In some embodiments,<br>
measuring device 424 may comprise a spectrophotometer. As the solution flows by the<br>
spectrophotometer, the instrument emits light of a particular wavelength that passes throu-gh<br>
a portion of the reaction mixture and is then detected by a detector. The detector th.en<br>
measures either the emittance or the absorbance of the solution at one or more particular<br>
wavelengths. These values are then compared to a known database. From that comparison,<br>
the concentration of a particular component within the solution can be calculated. The<br>
methods of calculating concentrations using a spectrophotometer are very well known, in<br>
the art. The spectrophotometer may be an IR, Raman, UV, or visible spectrophotometer, or<br>
any other spectrophotometer known in the art.<br>
[0048] In another embodiment, measuring device 424 may measure the<br>
oxidizing power of the solution as it flows through the device of the present invention. The<br>
oxidizing power may be measured, for example, chemically, as the solution reacts with a<br>
reducing agent, or electrochemically, as the solution is reduced by an electrical current.<br>
[0049] The concentration of one or more components can also be measured<br>
manually. In these embodiments, the operator removes a portion of the circulating solution<br>
and measures the concentration of a particular component. The concentration of the<br>
component is measured using techniques well known in the art.<br>
[0050] In certain embodiments, it is desirable to control the temperature of the<br>
reaction mixture. In these embodiments, valves 416 and 418 may be opened in order to<br>
loop the reaction mixture through a temperature control loop, depicted in Figure 5, during<br>
which the temperature of the mixture is either raised to a pre-determined value, lowered to<br>
a pre-determined value, or kept at a pre-determined value.<br>
[0051] In other embodiments, the temperature adjustment device heats or cools<br>
the air around the pipe or hose through which the reaction mixture flows, thereby heating or<br>
cooling the reaction mixture. In yet other embodiments, the temperature adjustment device<br>
is a jacket around the reaction chamber or the mixing chamber, through which a fluid,<br>
either liquid or gas, of a particular temperature flows and thereby heats or cools the reaction<br>
mixture. Other temperature adjustment devices currently known or later developed in the<br>
art are within the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
[0052] In one embodiment, shown in Figure 5, the temperature adjustment<br>
device may be a heat exchange device through which either cool or warm water circulates<br>
and thereby heats or cools the reaction mixture. When valves 416 and 418 are opened and<br>
valve 426 is closed, the temperature control unit becomes a part of the reaction loop. The<br>
reaction mixture flows through valve 416 and enters the heat exchange device 516 through<br>
the opening 508. There, depending on the temperature difference between the reaction<br>
mixture and the heat exchanger 516, the reaction mixture either heats up or cools down.<br>
The reaction mixture then exits the heat exchanger 516 through the opening 510 and flows<br>
through valve 418 to continue down the reaction loop.<br>
[0053] In this embodiment, the temperature control unit also, comprises a<br>
temperature adjuster 502, which can either cool or heat the fluid that flows through it.<br>
Water, air, or any other suitable fluid, enters the temperature adjuster 502 through pipe 514,<br>
once the valve 512 is opened. Once the temperature of the fluid inside the temperature<br>
adjuster 502 has reached a certain per-determined temperature, either by being cooled or<br>
warmed, the fluid is then directed to heat exchanger 516 through valve 518. The fluid<br>
enters heat exchanger 516 through opening 504 and then exits heat exchanger 516 through<br>
opening 506, whereupon it circulates back into heat adjuster 502.<br>
[0054] In certain embodiments, the temperature of the reaction mixture is<br>
adjusted automatically. For example, the device may have a thermometer or thermocouple<br>
430 along the reaction loop (see Figure 4). Thermometer 430 may be located anywhere<br>
along the reaction loop. The operator of the device can set the temperature to be at a<br>
desired, setting. When the temperature of the reaction mixture is not at the desired setting,<br>
the thermometer 430 can send a signal by which valves 415 and 416 are opened and valve<br>
426 is closed. The temperature adjuster 502 starts operating until such time that the<br>
temperature of the reaction mixture has reached the desired setting. At this point, either<br>
valves 415 and 416 are automatically closed and valve 426 opened, thereby removing the<br>
temperature control unit from the reaction loop, or the temperature control unit remains in<br>
the reaction loop in order to ensure that a constant temperature level is maintained<br>
throughout the operation.<br>
[0055] In other embodiments, valves 415 and 416 and the portion of the<br>
reaction loop comprising valve 426 do not exist. In these embodiments the temperature<br>
control unit is a permanent and integral part of the reaction loop. In these embodiments, if<br><br>
the temperature adjustment is achieved automatically, thermometer 430 starts temperature<br>
adjuster 502 when such a need arises.<br>
[0056] In other embodiments, the temperature may be adjusted manually, if<br>
desired. In these embodiments, the operator may monitor thermometer 430 and decicle<br>
whether temperature is to be adjusted. When such a need arises, the operator may manually<br>
direct the reaction mixture through the temperature control unit whereby the temperature is<br>
adjusted. Once the desired temperature is reached, the operator may manually stop any<br>
further change in the temperature.<br>
[0057] Once the concentration of ferrate within the reaction mixture, or the<br>
oxidizing power of the reaction mixture, has reached a suitable level, valve 428 is opened<br>
and at least a portion of the reaction mixture is drained from the reaction loop at opening<br>
432 (Figures 4 and 6). Thus, opening 432 of the device of the present invention is at a site<br>
proximal to the site of use.<br>
[0058] Figure 6 depicts an embodiment of the device of the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, the device is contained within a box or a cage 604, primarily for<br>
aesthetic purposes, such that the various pipes and hoses and containers are left unseen.<br>
Protruding from container 604 are the feeding pipes 114 for each of containers 102. Also<br>
protruding from container 604 are valve 428 and drain 432 from which the final product is<br>
obtained.<br>
[0059] Further, in this particular embodiment, the various drains described<br>
above, such as 112, 212, and 308, come together to form one main drain, which protrudes<br>
from container 604 (not shown in figure 6). Thus, if at any point during the operation of<br>
the device an unsuitable reaction mixture or starting material is to be discarded, the<br>
operator can do so without contaminating drain 432., In other embodiments, when<br>
contamination is not a concern, the discard drains mentioned herein feed into drain 432,<br>
such that there is only one drain out of container 604.<br>
[0060] As described above, some of the embodiments of the present invention<br>
relate to those in which the operation of the device of the present invention takes place<br>
automatically. For these embodiments, a control panel 602 is provided on the outside of<br>
container 604. Control panel 602 provides a means by which the operator inputs data for a<br>
control portion and receives data from the control portion. The control portion is where the<br>
automated aspects of the device are processed.<br><br>
[0061] Through various input devices on control panel 602, the operator can<br>
control certain parameters. For example, the operator can determine the amount of each of<br>
the starting materials to be used for a synthesis, the length of time the reaction mixture is to<br>
circulate in the reaction loop or sit in the reaction chamber, the final concentration of ferrate<br>
or the final oxidizing power of the reaction mixture prior to drainage, the temperature of the<br>
reaction mixture, or any other parameter that needs to be, or can be, controlled for the<br>
synthesis. The operator can also input the synthesis rate for ferrate. For example, based on<br>
a specific need, the operator can determine whether ferrate is to be synthesized<br>
continuously or in batches. If ferrate is to be synthesized continuously, the operator can<br>
determine the rate at which ferrate is obtained at drain 432. If ferrate is to be synthesized in<br>
batches, the operator can determine the number of batches and/or the time interval between<br>
the synthesis of each batch.<br>
[0062] In some embodiments, separate control portions may be provided. Thus,<br>
a first control portion may control the mixing process, while a second control portion may<br>
control the reaction process. In some embodiments, the separate control portions may be in<br>
communication with one another.<br>
[0063] In some embodiments, a separate control portion may be provided for<br>
each of the flow rate, temperature, pressure, and volume aspects of the production system.<br>
In some embodiments, each of the separate control portion are in communication with one<br>
another to control the entire system.<br>
[0064] The control portion can be manipulated through a variety of different<br>
user interfaces. The user interfaces can be a monitor, personal digital assistant (PDA) and<br>
the like. The user interface can be connected to the production system by wire, wireless<br>
communication, local area network (LAN), wide area network, a telephone connection, the<br>
Internet, modems, routers, and the like.<br>
[0065] The control portion may include at least one processor for receiving data<br>
and outputting commands. The control portion may include software and hardware. The<br>
control system may include A/D converters and D/A converters. The control portion may<br>
include data acquisition.<br>
[0066] The control portion may be pre-programmed to produce a desired result.<br>
In one embodiment, a user may input into the system the desired properties of the output,<br>
and the control potion controls the system components to produce the desired result.<br><br>
Alternatively, the user may input the quantities of solution components and temperatures to<br>
produce different outputs.<br>
[0067] As described above, the mixing portion and reaction portion may include<br>
sensors and valves. In some embodiments, the sensors and valves communicate with the<br>
control portion to produce a final product having certain desirable properties. In some<br>
embodiments, the sensor and valves may be pneumatic to control the system mechanically.<br>
In some embodiments, the sensors and valves may be electric. In some embodiments, the<br>
system may include combinations of pneumatic and electric sensors and valves.<br>
[0068] If more than one control portion is employed, each control portion may<br>
have a separate control panel 602. In other embodiments, the various input/output devices<br>
for the several control portions are contained within one control panel 602.<br>
[0069] In certain embodiments, the device of the present invention receives<br>
information about the state of the product that is being oxidized, for example, the effluent<br>
stream in a water treatment plant. The information may be inputted into the device<br>
manually by an operator, or automatically through sensors in the product stream. In either<br>
case, it is determined whether the product stream is being sufficiently affected by ferrate or<br>
not. If more ferrate is needed, that information is conveyed to the device of the present<br>
invention and more ferrate is produced. If too much ferrate is being introduced into the<br>
product stream, then the device of the present invention is made to produce less ferrate, or<br>
to cease production of ferrate.<br>
[0070] By "product stream" it is meant the substance which contains the object<br>
to be oxidized, synthesized, disinfected, cleaned, plated, encapsulated, adsorbed,<br>
coprecipitated, or coagulated.<br>
[0071] In some embodiments, two separate sensors determine the amount of<br>
ferrate needed for the particular product stream. One sensor may be located upstream from<br>
where ferrate is contacted with the product stream. Thus, for example, the upstream sensor<br>
may be located where the influent stream enters the site of use or upstream thereof. The<br>
upstream sensor determines the amount of ferrate needed for the particular conditions of the<br>
product stream.<br>
[0072] Another sensor may be located downstream from where ferrate is<br>
contacted with the product stream. Thus, for example, the downstream sensor may be<br>
located in the site of use or where the effluent stream exits the site of use, or downstream<br><br>
thereof. The downstream sensor determines whether the amount of ferrate introduced into<br>
the product stream was sufficient or not.<br>
[0073] In some embodiments, only one sensor is present, i.e., either the<br>
upstream or the downstream sensor. In other embodiments, there is no sensor.<br>
[0074] In some embodiments, the sensor is operated manually, for example, by<br>
an operator conducting a visual or chemical test of the product stream. In other<br>
embodiments, the sensor is operated automatically.<br>
[0075] In another aspect, the present invention relates to a device for the<br>
synthesis of ferrate, comprising at least one container capable of holding starting materials;<br>
means for measuring an amount of the starting materials; means for mixing the starting<br>
materials; a reaction chamber; and a drain; where the drain is located at a site proximal to<br>
the site of use of the ferrate.<br>
[0076] In yet another aspect, the present invention relates to a device for the<br>
synthesis of ferrate, comprising means for holding starting materials; means for measuring<br>
an amount of the starting materials; means for mixing the starting materials; means for<br>
reacting the starting materials to produce the ferrate; and means for removing the ferrate<br>
from the device; where the means for removing is located at a site proximal to the site of<br>
use of the ferrate.<br>
[0077] In some embodiments, "means for holding starting materials" includes,<br>
but is not limited to, a hopper, tank car, vessel, tank, pipe systems, drum, bucket, bag, or<br>
reservoir.<br>
[0078] In certain embodiments, "means for measuring an amount of the starting<br>
materials" includes, but is not limited to, a pressure sensor, volume sensor, graduated<br>
container, weight scale, optical concentration sensor, mass flow meter, or volume flow<br>
meter.<br>
[0079] In some embodiments, "means for mixing the starting materials",<br>
includes, but is not limited to, a rotor-stator, paddle, blade, agitator, disperser, stationary<br>
plate, stationary helix, turbine, pump, jet mixer, mixing valve, impeller, baffle, eductor,<br>
tank mixing eductor, turbulent flow nozzle, static mixer, diffuser, disperser, or venturi tube.<br>
[0080] In certain embodiments, "means for reacting the starting materials"<br>
includes, but is not limited to, a reaction vessel, which may include a hopper, tank car,<br>
vessel, tank, pipe systems, drum, bucket, bag, or reservoir, which in turn may comprise an<br>
evaporator, heat exchanger, compressor, condenser, cooling coil, heating coil, or boiler.<br><br><br>
[0081] In some embodiments, "means for removing the ferrate from the device"<br>
includes, but is not limited to, a pipe system, valve, tank, vessel, reservoir, bucket, pump, or<br>
drain.<br>
[0082] The foregoing description details certain embodiments of the invention.<br>
It will be appreciated, however, that no matter how detailed the foregoing appears in text,<br>
the invention can be practiced in many ways. As is also stated above, it should be noted<br>
that the use of particular terminology when describing certain features or aspects of the<br>
invention should not be taken to imply that the terminology is being re-defined herein to be<br>
restricted to including any specific characteristics of the features or aspects of the invention<br>
