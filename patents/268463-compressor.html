COMPRESSOR<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a compressor having an oil separator.<br>
Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2008-8259 discloses a vane rotor type compressor. The compressor has a housing having a cylinder (cylinder block) accommodated therein. The cylinder is connected at the opposite ends thereof to the front side block (front side plate) and the rear side block (rear side plate) and has therein a rotor having a plurality of vanes. Compression chambers are formed by these vanes and the opposite side blocks in the cylinder. The rotor and the vanes rotate to compress refrigerant gas in the compression chambers.<br>
The housing has a discharge chamber (discharge region) formed therein and into which compressed high-pressure refrigerant gas is discharged and a cyclone block (oil separator) is mounted to the rear side block for separating lubricating oil from the refrigerant gas. The cyclone block includes a main body having a cylindrical space formed therein (oil-separation chamber) and in which refrigerant gas is swiveled and which is surrounded by the cylindrical inner wall<br>
i<br>
surface of the main body and the bottom wall surface extending continuously from the cylindrical inner wall surface. The cyclone block further includes a cylindrical gas-discharge tube (oil-separation tube) disposed in the cylindrical space for causing the refrigerant gas introduced into the main body from an inlet to swirl in the cylinder block. The gas-discharge tube has at the top thereof an opening through which refrigerant gas having lubricating oil centrifugally separated is discharged out of the main body.<br>
The main body of the cyclone block has at the bottom thereof an oil discharge hole through which lubricating oil separated from refrigerant gas in the cylindrical space is discharged into the bottom of the discharge chamber (oil reservoir chamber).    The oil discharge hole Is formed In the main body of the<br><br><br>
Refrigerant gas introduced into the cylindrical space of the cyclone block flows helically down along the cylindrical inner wall surface of the main body. Lubricating oil is centrifuged from the refrigerant gas on the cylindrical inner wall surface of the main body, and the separated lubricating oil is sprayed on the bottom wall surface and flowed through the oil discharge hole to be discharged into the discharge chamber. The refrigerant gas from which lubricating oil is separated in the cylindrical space flows upwardly in the gas-discharge tube through the lower opening thereof and discharged into the discharge chamber through the upper opening thereof. Then, the refrigerant gas is discharged out of the vane rotary type compressor.<br>
In the vane rotary type compressor disclosed in the above Publication, when the refrigerant gas flowing at a high speed in the cylindrical space of the cyclone block is flowed through the oil discharge hole into the discharge chamber, the lubricating oil reserved in the discharge chamber is thrown up by the refrigerant gas flowing into the discharge chamber. As a result, the amount of the lubricating oil reserved in the discharge chamber is decreased, and the level of the lubricating oil in the discharge chamber is lowered, accordingly. If the level of the lubricating oil in the discharge chamber is varied by vibration of the compressor when the level of the lubricating oil is thus lowered, the refrigerant gas is flowed through the oil passage and then Into the compression chamber.    In order to forestall such<br><br>
situation, the volume of the cylindrical space of the cyclone block may be increased for reducing the flow speed of refrigerant gas in the cylindrical space of the cyclone block. However, if the volume of the cylindrical space of the cyclone block is increased, the cyclone block itself is made larger, which in turn increase the size of the body of the vane rotary type compressor.<br>
The present invention is dirpcted to providing a compressor which can prevent lubricating oil from being thrown up in the oil reservoir chamber without increasing the size of the compressor.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a comprasaor includes a housing, (t finitillon inomlifii, iin oil Hoparator and tm oil iiiHiovoIr i linmltfti Mm pHillllon member partitions a space within the housing Into a cunipteBsioii unit und a discharge region to which a refrigerant gas comprosHod hy tho compressor unit is discharged. The oil separator separates lubricating oil contained In refrigerant gas discharged from the compression unit and is aocommadHtml In llio discharge region. The oil separator includes a case, an oll-soparallon chamber, an oil-separation tube and an oil discharge hole. The case has a cylindrical shape. The oil-separation chamber is formed in the case. The oil-separation tube extends vertically at the top of the oil-separation chamber. The oil discharge hole is opened into the bottom of the oil-separation chamber at a first end of the oil discharge hole and opened to the outside of the case at a second end of the oil discharge hole. The oil reservoir chamber is formed in the discharge region outside the oil separator. An oil discharge passage is further provided for communicating the oil discharge hole to the oil reservoir chamber. A first end of the oil discharge passage is connected to the second end of the oil discharge hole. A second end of the oil discharge passage has a discharge port formed to be opened into the oil reservoir chamber and positioned above the level of the first end of the oil discharge hole. Part of the oil discharge passage extends upward along the vertical direction.<br>
Other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following will describe a compressor of the present Invention embodied in a vane type compressor of the first preferred embodiment of the present invention with reference to Figs. 1 through 3. In the following description, the front and rear of the vane type compressor are Indloatod hy ilio double-headed arrow Y1 in Fig. 1, and the top and bottom of the compressor Installed in a vehicle are indicated by the double-headed arrow Y2 in Fig. 1.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the vane type compressor 10 has a housing H including<br><br>
a rear housing 11 and a front housing 12 which is connected to one end surface or the front end surface of the rear housing 11. The rear housing 11 and the front housing 12 are fastened together by a plurality of bolts B, as shown in Fig. 3. The rear housing 11 has a cylinder block 13 accommodated therein and having a cylindrical outer peripheral surface and an elliptical inner peripheral surface, as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
The rear housing 11 has therein a front side plate 14 fixed on one end surface or the front end surface of the cylinder block 13 and a rear side plate 15 fixed on the other end surface or the rear end surface of the cylinder block 13 as a partition member. A discharge space DA is defined by the outer peripheral surface ofthe cylinder block 13, the inner peripheral surface ofthe rear housing 11 facing the outer peripheral suri'ace ofthe cylinder block 13 and first end surfaces 14A, 15A of the front and rear side plates 14, 15 facing the cylinder block 13. A part of the end surface of the front side plate 14 facing the cylinder block 13 is recessed forward thereby to form a back-pressure groove 14H, and a part ofthe end surface of the rear side plate 15 facing the cylinder block 13 is recessed rearward thereby to form a back-pressure groove 15H.<br>
A rotary shaft 17 extends through the cylinder block 13 and is rotatably supported by the front and rear side plates 14, 15. A cylindrical rotor 18 is fixedly mounted to the rotary shaft 17 for rotation therewith in the cylinder block 13. Referring to Fig. 2, the rotor 18 has a plurality of radial vane slots 18A formed therein for accommodating therein vanes 20 so as to allow the vanes 20 to move in and out of the vane slots 18A. Lubricating oil is supplied to the vane slots 18A. Each vane slot 18A is formed in the rotor 18 for communication at one end or the front end thereof with the back-presSure groove 14H ofthe front side plate 14 and at the other end or the rear end thereof with the back-pressure groove 15H of the rear side plate 15.<br>
In operation of the vane type compressor 10, when the rotor 18 is driven to rotate by the rotary shaft 17, each vane 20 is kept in contact at the outer end thereof with the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder block 13, so that compression<br><br>
chambers 21 are formed by the outer peripheral surface of tlie rotor 18, the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder block 13, two adJacetU vaiuas 20 and the front and rear Bide plates ^4, 15. In the vane type compreBsoi 10, the phaso in which the vuhinui (jf (lie (ioinfiroBnloii (liaiiihor 21 l» hotiid irit i«!»iHt=i«l lu m lOhlMnrd wi(h (htt rotational direction of the rotor 18 is the suction stroke and [\m pfiase in which the volume is being decreased is the compression slrokn "Iho imir hoiiBing 11, the cylinder block 13, the front and rear side plates 14,15, the rotary shaft 17, the rotor 18 and the vanes 20 form a compression unit C of Iho vanii lyp»» (lompiimsoi 10,<br>
The front housing 12 has ah inlet 24 formed therein at the top thereof, and a suction space SA in communication with the inlet 24, as shown in Fig. 1. The front side plate 14 has a pair of suction ports 14B formed in communication with the suction space SA. The cylinder block 13 has a pair of suction passages 13B extending through the cylinder block 13 in the axial direction thereof. In the suction stroke of the vane type compressor 10, the compression chambers 21 and the suction space SA are in communication with each other through the suction port 14B and the suction passage 138.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the cylinder block 13 is concaved or recessed on the opposite sides thereby to form the discharge chambers 13D. Thus, a pair of discharge chambers 13D is formed by the recesses in the outer periphery of the cylinder block 13, respectively, and forms a part of the discharge space DA.<br>
Each recess of the cylinder block 13 for the discharge chamber 13D has a stepped surface 13F extending radially inward from the outer peripheral surface of the cylinder block 13 and a fitting surface 13G extending to the outer peripheral surface of the cylinder block 13 in perpendicular relation to the stepped surface 13F. Thus, the discharge chamber 13D is'formed by the stepped surface 13F, the fitting surface 13G, the first end surfaces 14A, 15A of the front and rear side plates 14,15 and the inner peripheral surface of the rear housing 11. The discharge chamber 13D on the left side of Fig. 2 is formed such that the stepped surface 13F is located above the fitting surface 13G. The other discharge chamber 13D in the right side of Fig. 2 is formed such that its stepped surface 13F is positioned below the fitting<br><br>
surface 13G.<br>
A discharge hole 13A is formed in each fitting surface 13G of the cylinder block 13 for communication between the discharge chambers 13D (discharge space DA) and the compression chambers 21, respectively. The discharge hole 13A is openable by a discharge valve 22 mounted to the fitting surface 13G. The refrigerant gas compressed in the compression chamber 21 opens the discharge valve 22 and is discharged into the discharge chamber 13D (discharge space DA) through the discharge hole 13A.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a discharge region 30 is formed in the rear housing 11 by the rear side plate 15. That is, a space within the tear housing 11 is partitioned into the compression unit C and the discharge region 30 by the rear side plate 15. The discharge region 30 Is surrounded by the olher end surface or the second end iiiiilnco 1611 ot Ihe IHUI iiidt) pinte 15 tind llifi Innui rMiilttt «i u( llio roui hoiiHlny 'I The second end surface 15B is positioned on the opposUe tilde ot the rear side plate 15 from the first end surface 15A in the thickmiHS (llfoolion of Iho rear side plate 15.<br>
The rear side plate 15 has on the second end surface 15B thereof a thickened portion 15C protruding rearwardly and having a predetermined thickness, as shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 3, a pair of discharge passages 15E is formed in the thickened portion 15C. Each discharge passage 15E is formed by an elongated groove 15F formed in the rear end surface of the thickened portion 15C of the rear side plate 15 and a throttle 150 extending axially through the rear side plate 15 and connected to the elongated groove 15F at one end or the bottom end thereof. The throttle 15G has a circular cross-section. The throttle 15G is opened at one end or the front end thereof into the discharge chamber 13D for communication with the discharge space DA and opened at the other end or the rear end thereof into the bottom endbf the groove 15F.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the throttle 15G is formed in the rear side plate 15 so as to be positioned at the vertical center thereof and to face at the front end of the<br><br>
throttle 15G the discharge hole 13A (discharge chamber 13D). Thus, the throttle 15G is not provided in the bottom of the rear side plato 15. Refrigerant gas flowing from the discharge space DA into the discharge region 30 through the discharge passage 15E opened into the discharge chamber 13D is throttled at the throttle 15G of the discharge passage 15E, so that the pressure of the refrigerant gas is reduced. The discharge region 30 into which such refrigerant gas is flowed has a lower pressure than the discharge space DA and is positioned downstream of the discharge space DA with respect to the flow direction of refrigerant gas. An oil supply passage 15D is formed in the thickened portion 15C of the rear side plate 15 extending radially from the bottom end of the thickened portion 15C toward the rotary shaft 17 and then axially around the rotary shaft 17 toward the back-pressure<br>
groove 15H.<br>

' 't The vane type compressor 10 has an oil separator 40 formed In the<br>
discharge region 30 for separating lubricating oil contained in the refrigerant gas.<br>
The oil separator 40 has a low pressure which is substantially the same as the<br>
discharge region 30. An oil reservoir chamber 31 is formed in the discharge region<br>
30 outside the oil separator 40.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the oil separator 40 has a joint 41 with holes 41B through which bolts V are inserted. The oil separator 40 is fixedly connected to the thickened portion 15C of the rear side plate 15 by lightening the bolls V inserted through the hole 41B into the thickened portion 15C so that the discharge passages 15E are covered by the joint 41 of the oil separator 40<br>
Tliei oil BRpnrnlof 'lO further includoB «(3yllnrl»l(i0l omn AV,n\] nil nopnratinn chamber 43 and an oll-aeparatlon tube 44. iho cyllncJiicnl (JHSO 42 l» formed integrally with the joint 41 and extends vertically in the discharge region 30, The oil-separation chamber 43 Is formed in the case 42 Into a cylindrical shape with the bottom closed and an the top opened and extends vertlcnily In the oase 42, The oil-separation tube 44 is formed intp a cylindrical shape extending vertically and fixedly fitted to the oil-separation chamber 43 at the top thereof. The joint 41 has a pair of communication passages 41A opened at one end thereof so as to face the<br><br>
outer peripheral surface of the oil-separation tube 44 and in communication with the discharge passages 15E at the other end or the top end of the discharge passages 15E.<br>
The joint 41 has baffle plates 42D formed integrally therewith located on opposite sides of the case 42 and extending from the joint 41 outwardly downward away from the case 42, as shown in Fig. 3. The baffle plates 42D serves as an impinging member. The baffle plates 42D are disposed over the lubricating oil in the oil reservoir chamber 31. The oil separator 40 has a gas discharge port 42A at the top of the case 42, through which refrigerant gas flowing in the oil-separation tube 44 is discharged out of the vane type compressor 10, e.g. into the external refrigerant circuit in which the vane type compressor 10 is connected.<br>
The case 42 has at the bottom thereof an oil discharge hole 42B through which lubricating oil reserved in the oil-separation chamber 43 is discharged out thereof. One end or a first end of the oil discharge hole 42B is opened into the bottom of the oil-separation chamber 43, while the other end or a second end is positioned at substantially the same level as the bottom surface of the oil-separation chamber 43. The oil discharge hole 42B extends horizontally as indicated by its axis LI in Fig. 3.<br>
A metal wire mesh 46 is disposed in the case 42 at the bottom of the oil-separation chamber 43 as a mesh member. The metal wire mesh 46 is formed into a cylindrical shape to cover the whole inner peripheral surface of the case 42 at the bottom of the oil-separation chamber 43 and the opening of the oil discharge hole 428 at the first end thereof or oil-separation chamber 43. The metal wire mesh 46 is fixed to the oil-separation chamber 43 by any suitable means to prevent the metal wire mesh 46 from being rotated.<br>
A cylindrical passage forming member 45 is connected to a part of the side surface of the case 42 in the oil separator 40, extending vertically upward from the bottom end of the case 42. The passage forming member 45 is connected to the case 42 such that the top end of the passage forming member 45 is substantially on<br><br>
the same level as the bottom end of the oil-aeparatlon lutao AA<br>

The first passage 51 is formed in the oil discharge passage 50 to extend horizontally such that the axis L2 and the axis LI of the oil discharge hole 42B coincide with each other. The cross-sectional area of the first passage 51 is substantially the same as that of the oil discharge hole 428. The second passage<br>
52	is formed in the oil discharge passage 50 such that its axis L3 is perpendicular to<br>
the axis L2 of the first passage 51 and the axis L1 of the oil discharge hole 428.<br>
Thus, the second passage 52 extends upward in the vertical direction from the first<br>
passage 51.<br>
The second passage 52 has a discharge port 53 formed at the top end thereof or at the second end of the oil discharge passage 50 through which the lubricating oil in the oil-separation chamber 43 flows into the oil reservoir chamber 31. The second passage 52 of the oil discharge passage 50 extends vertically upward such that the discharge port 53 is positioned above the first end of the oil discharge hole 428.<br>
The part of the second passage 52 of the oil discharge passage 50 adjacent to the discharge port 53 thereof is tapered upward thereby to form a throttle 508. The oil discharge passage 50 is formed such that the discharge port<br>
53	is positioned adjacent to the baffle plate 42D. In other words, the oil discharge<br>
passage 50 (passage forming member 45) is formed adjacent to the baffle plate<br>
42D so that the refrigerant gas flowing out from the discharge port 53 impinges on<br><br>
the baffle plate 42D.<br>
The following will describe the operation of the vane type compressor 10. In operation of the vane type compressor 10, when the rotary shaft 17 is being driven thereby to rotate the rotor 18 and the vane 20, refrigerant gas is flowed from the suction space SA through the paired suction ports 14B and the suction passages 13B into the compression chamber 21 then in the suction stroke. The refrigerant gas flowed into the compression chamber 21 is compressed by reduction of the volume of the compression chamber 21 in the compression stroke. The compressed refrigerant gas is discharged from the compression chamber 21 into the discharge chamber 13D through the discharge hole 13A.<br>
The refrigerant gas discharged into the discharge ctiamber 13D is throttled by flowing through the throttle 15G and then flowed into the groove 15F. The refrigerant gas is flowed from the grpove 15F Into the oil separator 40 tlirough the coiitiniinloMlioii (uiHHaijn 'HA.

The refrigerant gas flowing toward the bottom of the oil-separation chamber 43 is whirled along the inner peripheral surface of the case 42 and the metal wire mesh 46, so that the lubricating oil is attached to the metal wire mesh 46. Thus, the lubricating oil is separated from the refrigerant gas, and the separated lubricating oil is dropped to the bottom of the oil-separation chamber 43. The refrigerant gas impinging on the metal wire mesh 46 reduces its whirling speed.<br>
The oil discharge passage SO in communication with the oil discharge hole<br><br>
42B is formed to extend horizontally from the oil discharge hole 428 and then upwardly vertically, so that the discharge port 53 is opened above the first end of the oil discharge hole 428. Therefore, lubrication oil is reserved in the bollom of the oil-separation chamber 43 and the oil discharge hole 42B. In this state, refrigerant gas is mixed with the lubrication oil in the bottom of the oil-separation chamber 43 and the oil discharge hole 428, so that the refrigerant gas is mixed in the lubricating oil in the form of a foam.<br>
The lubricating oil reserved in the bottom of the oil-separation chamber 43 is flowed through the metal wire mesh 46 and the oil discharge hole 42B into the first passage 51. By virtue of the throttling effect of the metal wire mesh 46, the foamed refrigerant gas in the lubricating oil does not pass through the metal wire mesh 46, so that the foamed refrigerant gas is separated from the lubricating oil. The lubricating oil is flowed horizontally along the axis L2 of the first passage 51, then vertically upwardly along the axis L3 of the second passage 52 and introduced to a position above the oil discharge hole 42B. Then, the lubricating oil is introduced into the oil resen/oir chamber 31 through the discharge port 53 of the oil discharge passage 50 and reserved in the oil reservoir chamber 31. When the lubricating oil is flowed through the discharge port 53, the foamed refrigerant gas in the lubricating oil is not able to pass through the throttle 50B. Thus, the purity of the lubricating oil flowed through the discharge port 53 may be improved.<br>
The refrigerant gas Impinging on the lubricating oil rosefvod In the bottom of the oil-separation chamber 43 is flowed horizontally through the oil discharge hole 42B and into the oil discharge passage 50. The refrigerant gas in the oil discharge passage 50 Is flowed horizontally through the first passage 51 and llowod vorllcelly llitouyh tim second pa8ft»Hi» fV^, m\ \\]t\\ Uiw Haw Hpoftd i»( tlu) refrigerant gas Is reduced gradually, Thus, the refriyoraiil UHB having a lower flow speed than the refrigerant gas flowed in the oil Bepnrntlon chamber 43 is discharged into the oil reservoir chamber 31. Because the discharge port 53 is opened upward, the refrigerant gas flowing from the dlschnroo port 53 hardly impinges directly on the lubricating oil reserved In the oil reservoir chamber 31. The baffle plate 42D is disposed in the oil reservoir chamber 31 in a direction in<br><br>
which refrigerant gas is flowed from the discharge port 53 such that the refrigerant gas flowing out from the discharge port 53 impinges on the baffle plate 42D. In this case, lubricating oil contained in the refrigerant gas is separated from the refrigerant gas and dropped to the oil reservoir chamber 31.<br>
The lubricating oil reserved in the oil reservoir chamber 31 is supplied through the oil supply passage 15D to the vane slots 18A and various sliding parts of the vane type compressor 10 for lubrication thereof.<br>
The first preferred embodiment of the present invention offers the following advantageous effects.<br>
(1) In the vane type compressor 10 including the oil-separation chamber 43 with the oil discharge hole 42B formed for discharging lubricating oil, the oil discharge passage 50 is formed by the first passage 51 and the second passage 52. The first passage 51 extends horizontally from the oil discharge hole 42B for communication with the second end of the oil discharge hole 42B and the second passage 52 extends vertically upwardly from the first passage 51. As compared to a case, for example, wherein the oil discharge passage 50 is not in communication with the oil discharge hole 428 and, therefore, the refrigerant gas flowing through the oil discharge hole 428 is directly discharged into the oil reservoir chamber 31 without flowing upward, the distance for which the refrigerant gas flows from the oil-separation chamber 43 to the oil reservoir chamber 31 of the first preferred embodiment is made longer by the length of the oil discharge passage 50. Thus, the flow speed of the refrigerant gas discharged into the oil reservoir chamber 31 is made lower than that of refrigerant gas flowing in the oil-separation chamber 43. The refrigerant gas discharged into the oil reservoir chamber 31 through the oil discharge hole 428, hardly causes the lubricating oil reserved in the oil reservoir chamber 31 to be thrown up, so that the level of the lubricating oil in the oil reservoir chamber 31 is prevented from being lowered. Therefore, the level of the lubricating oil in the oil resen/oir chamber 31 adjacent to the oil supply passage 15D may be kept so high that the oil supply passage 15D is sealed by the lubricating oil in the oil reservoir chamber 31 thereby to prevent the refrigerant gas<br><br>
from entering into the oil supply passage 15D. This may prevent the refrigerant gas from being supplied lo the vane slots 18A from Ihe oil supply passage 15D through the back-pressure grooves 14H, ^5h, and from flowing into the compression chambers 21 and the suction space SA<br>
99<br>
(/') Iho oil (iJHi liniilt! tMuisago 50 foimod in J|i»i "II tin|iii(*«ti&gt;i *U) mrliicHH Iho flow speed of the refrigerant gas as described obovH, HO lluil Hie flow B|ieod of the refrigerant gas need not be reduced in the oil-Reparnllnn chnml)r)r 43. Therefore, the case 42 of the oil separator 40 need not be mudo largo in volume for reducing the flow speed of refrigerant gas, and Iho liibrlcallnfj oil In tlin (ill roHervoir chamber 31 is prevented from being thrown up without making (he oil separator 40 and hence the vane type compressor 10 large in size.<br>
(3)	The oil discharge passage 50 includes the horizontal first passage 51 and the second passage 52 extending vertically upwardly from the first passage 51, and the discharge port 53 of the second passage 52 is located higher than the second end of the oil discharge hole 42B. With the oil discharge passage 50 in communication with the oil discharge hole 42B, the lubricating oil may be reserved in the oil-separation chamber 43 and the oil discharge hole 42B without allowing the lubricating oil in the oil-separation chamber 43 to flow directly Into the oil reservoir chamber 31. Therefore,'the oil discharge hole 428 is sealed by the lubricating oil, and the refrigerant gas in the oil-separation chamber 43 is prevented from impinging directly on the lubricating oil in the oil reservoir chamber 31. As a result, the lubricating oil in the oil reservoir chamber 31 Is prevented from being thrown up.<br>
(4)	The discharge port 53 of the oil discharge passage 50 is substantially on the same level as the bottom end of the oil-separation tube 44 of the oil separator 40. The refrigerant gas whirling in the oil-separation tube 44 on the upper side from the bottom end of the oil-separation tube 44 forces down the lubricating oil in the oil-separation chamber 43 below the oil-separation tube 44 and the lubricating oil may be reserved to a level at the bottom end of the oil-separation tube 44 in the oil-separation chamber 43.  Thus, positioning the discharge port 53 at the same<br><br>
level as the bottom end of the oil-separation tube 44, the lubricating oil may be reserved sufficiently in the oil-separation chamber 43.<br>
(5)	The passage forming member 45 is connected to tho case 42 such that<br>
the baffle plate 42D is positioned adjacent to the discharge port 53. The baffle plate<br>
42D is located at a position to which the refrigerant gas from the discharge port 53<br>
is flowed. The refrigerant gas flowing from the discharge port 53 is made to<br>
impinge on the baffle plate 42D, thereby separating the lubricating oil from the<br>
refrigerant gas. Thus, the efficiency of separating the lubricating oil from the<br>
refrigerant gas may be improved.<br>
(6)	The throttle 50B provided at the discharge port 53 of the oil discharge passage 50 separates the foamed refrigerant gas from the luhrlcatlng oil when it is flowed from the discharge port 53, so that lubricating oil having a relatively high purity or a relatively low content of refrigerant gas may he discharged from the discharge port 53.<br>
(7)	The metal wire mesh 46 disposed ol tho holldin of tim oil 8(3parallon chamber 43 so as to cover the oil discharge hole 420 roducoa llin flow speed of the refrigerant gas circulating In the oil-separation chamtjer 43, Thus, the flow speed of the refrigerant gas flowing through the oil discharge hale 4^0 nnd diHchnrged from the oil discharge passage 50 may befreduced.<br>
(8)	The metal wire mesh 46 separates the foamed refrigerant gas from the lubricating oil flowing from the oil-separation chamber 43 through the metal wire mesh 46. Thus, the lubricating oil flowed from the discharge port 53 has a relatively high purity or a relatively low content of the refrigerant gas.<br>
The following will describe the second preferred embodiment of a vane type compressor of the present invention with reference to Fig. 4. In the following description of the second preferred embodiment, the same reference numerals will be used to denote the same or similar elements or components and the description thereof will be omitted.<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the oil discharge hole 42B is formed in the case 42 of the oil separator 40. The vane type compressor 10 has an oil discharge passage 60 which is provided by a groove-shaped recess formed on the rear ond of the thickened portion 15C which is connected to the joint 41 and Is In communication with the second end of the oil discharge hole 42B. The oil discharge passage 60 is shielded by a metallic seal formed by the thickened portion 15C and the joint 41.<br>
The oil discharge passage 60 is formed such that the axis L4 of the oil discharge passage 60 extends vertically upward from one end or a first end thereof and then obliquely to the periphery of the joint 41 of the oil separator 40. The oil discharge passage 60 has at the other end or a second end thereof a discharge port 60A which is opened into the oil reservoir chamber 31 through the recess formed in the thickened portion 15C which is connected to the joint 41, The oil discharge passage 60 has at the second end thereof a throttle 60B. The oil discharge passage 60 is opened at a position adjacent to a boll B which is located such that refrigerant gas flowing out from the discharge port 60A impinges on the bolts B.<br>
Therefore, the second preferred embodiment has the following advantageous effects in addition to the effects (1) through (4) and (6) through (8) of the first preferred embodiment.<br>
^^<br>
(9)	Part of the rear end surface of the thickened portion 15C Is recessed and the thickened portion 15C and the joint 41 are connected with each other thereby to form the oil discharge passage 60. Thus, in making the rear side plate 15, the oil discharge passage 60 may be formed in the thickened portion 15C by casing. Thnroforo, the prodiiollon coat of the oil dlBchorijo PMBBHU*' f'f&gt; wv\ honoo of the vane type compressor 10 n»ay be reduced.<br>
(10)	The oil discharge passage 60 is provided by th» groove-shaped recess formed on the rear end surface of the thickened portion 15C such that refrigerant gas flowing out from the discharge port 60A of the oil discharge passage 00<br><br>
impinges on the bolts B. Thus, lubricating oil may be separutod fioni tfie refrigerant gas with increased efficiency.<br>
The following will be describe the third preferred embodiment of a vane type compressor according to the present invention with reference to Fig. 5. In the following description of the third preferred embodiment, the same reference numerals will be used to denote the same or similar elements or components and the description thereof will be omitted.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the oil separator 40 Is joined to the rear end surface of the thickened portion 15C through a gasket G. The oil discharge hole 42B is formed in the case 42 of the oil separator 40. An oil discharge passage 70 is formed between the rear end surface of the thickened portion 15C and the gasket G facing the thickened portion 15C for communication with the second end of the oil discharge hole 42B. In the other words, the oil discharge passage 70 is formed by connecting the thickened portion 15C to the oil separator 40 together through the gasket G. Part of the surface of the gasket G facing the thickened portion 15C has a groove-shaped recess thereby to form the oil discharge passage 70.<br>
The oil discharge passage 70 is formed such that the axis L5 extends vertically upward from one end or a first end thereof and then obliquely to the periphery of the joint 41 of the oil separator 40. The discharge port 70A formed in the oil discharge passage 70 at the other end or a second end thereof is opened into the oil reservoir chamber 31 through the recess formed on the surface the gasket G facing the rear end surface of the thickened portion 15C. The oil discharge passage 70 has at the second end thereof the throttle 70B formed therein. The second end of the oil discharge passage 70 is opened at a position adjacent to the bolt B such that the bolt B is located in a direction in which the refrigerant gas is flowed from the discharge port 70A.<br>
Therefore, the third preferred embodiment has the following advantageous effects in addition to the effects (1) through (4) and (6) through (8) of the first preferred embodiment.<br><br>
(11) The gasket G has a groove-shaped recess to form the oil discharge passage 70, The bolt B is located at a position to which the lofrlgernnt gas from the discharge port 70A is flowed. The refrigerant gas flowed from the discharge port 70A is made to collide witti the bolt B, thereby separating tlio lubricating oil from the refrigerant gas. Tlius, the efficiency of separating the lubricating oil from the mliiliomiit lias ni^iy IHI iMipioved.<br>
The gasket G is interposed between the rear end surface of the thickened portion 15C and the oil separator 40 for prevonting the rofrl(j(nani gas and the lubricating oil from being flowed from leaking out of the oil dlHoliargo passage 70. The oil discharge passage 70 is formed merely by making «ruueBS In the gasket G, thereby reducing the production cost of the oil discharge passage 70.<br>
