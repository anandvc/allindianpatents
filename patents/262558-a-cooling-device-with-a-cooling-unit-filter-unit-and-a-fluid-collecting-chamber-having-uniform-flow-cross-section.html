				<td>COOLING DEVICE WITH FILTER UNIT<br>
The invention relates to a cooling device with a cooling unit through which a fluid to be<br>
cooled, in particular hydraulic oil, can flow, and with a filter unit for filtration of the fluid, the filter<br>
unit extending on one longitudinal side of the cooling unit and a fluid collecting chamber being<br>
located between the filter unit and the cooling unit.<br>
These cooling devices (US-A-4 295 964, CH 533 246 A) can be used for a host of<br>
applications and are available in the most varied embodiments. The cooling device systems which<br>
have been readily available on the market to date, however, all consist predominantly of a filter unit<br>
which is flanged to the cooling unit, or of tank units which are connected to the cooling units, the<br>
respective tank unit then holding the filter element. The known cooling devices are therefore<br>
generally composed of several components, and the independent cooling unit can be connected by<br>
way of the corresponding piping to the independent filter unit as the cooling device is being<br>
produced. As a result of the indicated piping, in the transport of the fluid, flow-induced losses<br>
occur; this does not favor energy-efficient operation of the known cooling device. Nor can it be<br>
precluded that leaks may occur in the area of the piping. This adversely affects operating reliability.<br><br>
DE 196 35 777 A discloses a cooling device with a cooling unit through which a fluid to be<br>
cooled can flow and with a filter unit for filtration of the fluid, the cooling unit and the filter unit<br>
being integrally connected to one another and the filter unit together with the cooling unit being<br>
located in a device housing. This document also discloses using a plate-shaped finned radiator as the<br>
cooling unit and the filter element is held in a filter housing in the known solution such that it is an<br>
integral component of the device housing.<br>
US-A-5 159 821 moreover discloses a cooling device with a filter disk with a small structure<br>
in the axial direction as the filter element which, located in the device housing, also holds a plate-<br>
shaped finned radiator as the cooling unit. A drying medium extends in the fluid direction in front of<br>
the filter element within the device housing, the filter element disk which is connected upstream of<br>
the finned radiator on one of its longitudinal sides occupying only a small overall length there. In<br>
these known solutions as well, flow losses occur in the operation of the filter device; this can lead to<br>
low filter efficiency. To some extent, a used filter element can be replaced by a new element only<br>
with great difficultly.<br>
EP 1 261 809 B1 discloses a generic cooling device with a cooling unit through which a<br>
fluid to be cooled, especially hydraulic oil, can flow, and with a filter unit for filtration of the fluid,<br>
the cooling unit and the filter unit being integrally connected to one another, which together with the<br>
cooling unit is located in a device housing, the cooling unit as a plate-shaped finned radiator<br>
assuming the incipient cooling tasks. The filter unit is located in the flow direction of the fluid to be<br>
cooled upstream from the plate-shaped finned radiator; this has the advantage that potential fouling,<br>
when filtered out of the fluid flow, cannot adversely affect reliable operation of the cooling unit. In<br>
the known solution the filter unit extends essentially along one longitudinal side of the finned<br>
radiator, between the filter unit and the cooling unit a fluid collecting chamber being connected.<br>
This fluid collecting chamber has different cross sectional areas, in particular, the cross section<br>
widens in the direction of the bottom side of the cooling device so that unfavorable flow conditions<br><br>
can occur with cavity formation; this is disadvantageous for undisrupted, energy-saving operation of<br>
the known cooling device and it has been found in particular that at very low flow velocities of the<br>
fluid the distribution of the latter out of the fluid collecting chamber to the cooling unit leads to<br>
nonuniform distribution situations. This adversely affects effective cooling of the fluid. In addition,<br>
the known solution is expensive and complex to produce.<br>
Proceeding from this prior art, the object of this invention is to further improve the known<br>
cooling devices such that they enable altogether improved operation, especially also at low flow<br>
velocities. This object is achieved by a cooling device with the features of claim 1 in its entirety.<br>
In that, as specified in the characterizing partof claim 1, the fluid collecting chamber has a<br>
uniform flow cross section and is sealed relative to the filter unit at least partially by a concavely<br>
curved boundary wall, optimized fluid routing is achieved which leads to the velocity behavior<br>
becoming uniform while avoiding cavities and turbulence so that in this respect trouble-free,<br>
energy-efficient operation is possible with the cooling device according to the invention.<br>
In particular, the free fluid cross section in the fluid collecting chamber can be adapted to the<br>
free flow cross sections in the area of the filter unit, its preferably being provided that the fluid<br>
collecting chamber is made semicircular in cross section, the filter unit having a filter element which<br>
is held in a filter housing with a cylindrical installation space. Thus, the free flow cross sections can<br>
continue and remain within the filter housing in the fluid collecting chamber so that in spite of<br>
deflected flows in the area of the transition between the filter housing and the fluid collecting<br>
chamber, for the most part problem-free fluid transport is achieved.<br>
In one especially preferred embodiment of the cooling device according to the invention, it<br>
is provided that the fluid collecting chamber in the middle has another boundary wall which divides<br>
the fluid collecting chamber into two component spaces, of which one has a fluid connection to the<br><br>
filter housing and the other has an outlet for discharge of filtered and cooled fluid. As a result of the<br>
other boundary wall in the fluid collecting chamber the fluid flow can be divided, one component<br>
flow coming from the filter unit first being supplied to the part of the cooling unit, which flow, in<br>
the reverse direction and cooled by the other part of the cooling unit, re-enters the component space<br>
of the fluid collecting chamber bordered by the other boundary wall, in order from there to leave the<br>
cooling device filtered and cooled. This arrangement is especially favorable for fluid flows to be<br>
routed with a low speed. By division and due to separation via the respective boundary wall the<br>
cooling and transport performances can be "proportioned"; this cannot be achieved with the known,<br>
described solutions.<br>
Other advantageous embodiments of the cooling device according to the invention are the<br>
subject matter of the other dependent claims.<br>
The cooling device according to the invention will be detailed below using one embodiment<br>
as shown in the drawings. The figures are schematic and not to scale.<br>
FIG. 1	shows the cooling device as a whole, partially in a longitudinal section, partially in a<br>
perspective top view;<br>
FIG. 2	shows the structure of the filter housing and fluid collecting chamber located on the<br>
left viewed in the direction of looking at FIG. 1, without the filter element inserted.<br>
The cooling device shown in the figures has a cooling unit 10 through which a fluid to be<br>
cooled, in particular, hydraulic oil, can flow, and a filter unit 12 for filtration of this fluid. The<br>
cooling unit 10 is made as a plate-shaped.finned radiator, i.e., to guide the cooling air, the plate<br>
radiator has fins (not shown) which are folded up in a zig-zag shape and which between themselves<br><br>
border fluid routing channels 14 which are used to transport the fluid to be cooled. The direction of<br>
air routing through the cooling unit 10 runs perpendicular to the plane of FIG. 1 and the fluid<br>
transport direction transversely thereto, that is, within the plane of the figure. Furthermore, the<br>
stacked fluid routing channels 14 discharge on either side into the fluid collecting chambers 16, 18.<br>
The structure of these finned radiators is in general conventional, so that it will no longer be detailed<br>
here. The device housing of the cooling unit 10 can consist of an aluminum casting or the like; but it<br>
can also be composed in the conventional manner of sheet metal parts in a box shape and can be<br>
assembled to form the overall housing via weld connections. For the sake of simplicity, the upper<br>
and the lower end wall for the collecting chamber 16 are not shown.<br>
Viewed in the direction of looking at FIG. 1, the filter unit 12 extends on the left<br>
longitudinal side of the cooling unit 10 and the filter unit 12 has a filter housing 20 on a cylindrical<br>
installation space 22 which lies in the middle for holding a cylindrical filter element 24 of<br>
conventional design. This filter unit 24 is made of conventional filtration materials and consists, for<br>
example, of a pleated, hollow cylindrical, multilayer filter mat which surrounds a middle support<br>
tube which is not detailed. Viewed in the direction of looking at FIG. 1, the filter housing 20 in its<br>
upper end area has an inlet 26 for at least partially fouled and heated fluid. The fluid which has been<br>
supplied in this way via the inlet 26 flows through the filter element 24 from the outside to the<br>
inside and the filtered fluid is discharged in the middle from the filter element 24 through the<br>
bottom outlet opening 28 of a spacer layer 30. This spacer layer 30 is supported on a clip-like or<br>
cage-like holding unit 32 with individual holding rods 33, which in turn are supported on the bottom<br>
part 34 of the filter housing 20. This bottom part 34 can seal the filter unit 12 fluid-tight to the<br>
bottom, that is, on the bottom-side, but can also be used to hold a bypass valve which is not detailed<br>
in order for example to supply fouled fluid cleaned by the filter unit 12 not to the cooling unit 10 for<br>
cooling purposes, but to drain it out of the device; this can be advantageous, for example, when the<br>
temperature of the filtered fluid does not yet necessitate cooling or does so only partially.<br><br>
By means of the holding unit 32 and the spacer layer 30 it is possible to insert filter elements<br>
24, which are different in terms of overall length, into the same cooling device in order to perform<br>
various filtration tasks in practical applications. But preferably, as shown in FIG. 1, the overall<br>
length of the filter element 24 is chosen such that in the axial direction only roughly half of the<br>
installation space 22 of the filter housing 20 is used up so that in this respect underneath the filter<br>
element 24 a cylindrical holding space is formed which also contributes to making the fluid flow<br>
uniform in the filter housing 20 after filtration.<br>
As FIG. 1 furthermore shows, between the filter unit 12 and the cooling unit 10 is the first<br>
fluid collecting chamber 26 with an axial extension length which is adapted according to connection<br>
possibilities on the longitudinal side of the finned radiator as the cooling unit 10. This fluid<br>
collecting chamber 16 has a uniform flow cross section and is closed by a concavely curved<br>
boundary wall 36 relative to the filter unit 12. These conditions are especially clearly illustrated in<br>
FIG. 2. In this way, for the fluid collecting chamber 26 a type of semicircular tube is formed which<br>
with its flat connection cross section engages the face of the finned radiator.<br>
Preferably the other or the second fluid collecting chamber 18 on the opposite longitudinal<br>
side of the finned radiator has a comparable half tube structure; here, however, the possibility also<br>
exists of selecting a different, in particular, square cross section. Furthermore, it is provided that the<br>
fluid collecting chamber 18 continuously has connection possibilities to the fluid routing channels<br>
14 of the cooling unit 10. In the embodiment shown in the figures, the fluid collecting chamber 16 is<br>
divided roughly in the middle by another boundary wall 38 which divides the fluid collecting<br>
chamber 16 fluid- tight into two component spaces 40, 42.<br>
To supply the lower component space 40, a transverse passage site 44 is used, preferably in<br>
the form of a hole which connects the component space 40 to carry fluid to the interior of the filter<br>
housing 20, in particular to the installation space 22 for the filter element 24. Fluid which has been<br><br>
filtered in this way is thus fed into the component space 40 by way of the transverse passage site 44<br>
and then flows from left to right through the fluid routing channels 14, cooling being induced by the<br>
cooling unit 10 in its lower half area. The fluid or medium which has been cooled in this way then<br>
enters the other fluid collecting chamber 18, rises toward the top when viewed in the direction of<br>
looking at FIG. 1, and then crosses the fluid routing channels 14 from right to left in the upper area,<br>
in particular in the upper half of the cooling unit 10. The fluid medium which has then been<br>
completely cooled in this way enters the second or upper component space 42 and from there the<br>
fluid which has been filtered and cooled leaves the fluid device via the outlet 46 which has the same<br>
axial direction as the inlet 26 (compare the partial representation as shown in FIG. 2).<br>
The arrangement described in this way for the most part makes the fluid flow uniform both<br>
in the filter unit 12 and also in the cooling unit 10 and in the two fluid collecting chambers 16, 18. In<br>
particular, slowly flowing fluid can be filtered and cooled in this way without disruption, and due to<br>
the constantly maintained cross sectional characteristics energy-efficient filtering and cooling<br>
operation with the cooling device according to the invention are possible. As FIG. 2 shows in<br>
particular, the filter unit 12 with the fluid collecting chamber 16 can be produced in one piece, for<br>
example in the form of a diecasting, in order to connect the unit which has then been produced in<br>
this way fluid-tight to the remaining cooling unit 10 on its one face side by means of a conventional<br>
welding process. If the other boundary wall 38 is omitted, with the described cooling device<br>
according to the invention, even more quickly flowing media can be reliably managed, then<br>
preferably in the area of the second fluid collecting chamber 18 an outlet (not shown) having to be<br>
provided for discharging the filtered and cooled fluid. With the cooling device according to the<br>
invention a unit of very compact structure is formed which can be flexibly adapted to the different<br>
filtering and cooling tasks without the fundamental structure of the cooling device having to be<br>
changed; this helps to save money. Otherwise the cooling device according to the invention is easy<br>
to maintain and install; this in turn helps to save money.<br><br>
