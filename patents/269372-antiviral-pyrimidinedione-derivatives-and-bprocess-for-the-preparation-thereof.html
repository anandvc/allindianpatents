				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention  relates  to  novel  pyrimidinedione  derivatives  or pharmaceutically  acceptable  salts  thereof which  are  useful   as  antiviral agents, especially for treatment of AIDS, and process for the preparation thereof. Description of the prior art<br>
Nowadays, there are about 15 chemotherapeutic agents for AIDS which were approved by the FDA. It has been known that such chemotherapeutic agents have medical action mechanisms to inhibit replication of AIDS virus.<br>
However, they also have drug tolerance and undesirable side effects due to their toxicity. In order to solve these problems, many researches have been carried out to develope new antiviral chemotherapeutic agents with strong antiviral activity as well as lower toxicity.<br>
Much researches to develop new antiviral agents for treatment of AIDS have been focused on pyrimidinedione derivatives, and thus the present inventors have synthesized various new pyrimidinedione derivatives by introducing homocarbocyclic groups to the N-1 position of pyrimidinedione derivatives, which compounds were applied for patent (see, WO97/30979, US patent 5,922,727), and they continued synthesis and evaluation of new derivatives prepared by introducing new homocarbocyclic groups, aryl and heteroaryl substituents, alkyl and aryl carbonylmethyl groups to the pyrimidinedione derivatives and studied their pharmacological effects. As the result, the inventors have found that the newly synthesized derivatives by the present invention have unexpectedly strong anti-HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) activity as well as very low toxicity.<br>
Summary of the invention Accordingly,   an   object   of   the   present   invention   is   to   provide   new<br><br>
pyrimidinedione derivatives of the following formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which have strong antiviral activity against HIV.<br>

Activity and Toxicity<br>
Anti-HIV activity tests in vitro of the compounds according to the present invention were performed as described in J. Med. Chem, 34, 357, 1991. Inhibition by the compounds of virus-induced cytotoxic effect in MT-4 cells was measured as follows.<br>
MT-4 cells were suspended in culture media at 2.5xl05 cells/ml and infected with 1000 CCID50 ( 50% cell culture infective dose ) of HIV. Immediately after virus infection, 100//# of cell suspension was brought into each well of a flat-bottomed microtitray containing various concentrations of the test compounds. After 4 or 5 days incubation at 37°C, efficacy of the compounds was determined by the MTT method. Cytotoxicity of the compounds was assessed in parallel with their antiviral activity, based on viability of mock-infected host cells as determined by the MTT method.<br>
The results are shown in the following table.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
Usefulness of the invention<br>
The present compounds have strong anti-HIV activity as well as very low toxicity, and thus they are expected to be used as potent antiviral agents.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Y represents oxygen atom, sulfur atom or carbonyl,<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
2.	The compound of the general formula (I) as claimed in claim 1, wherein Rl is ethyl or isopropyl, and R2 and R3 are methyl.<br>
3.	A process for the preparation of a compound of the general formula (I) by reacting a compound of the formula (II) and a compound of the formula (III).<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein, Rl, R2, R3 and Y are as defined in claim 1, and Lie represents a conventional leaving group.<br>
4.	The process as claimed in claim 3, wherein the reaction is performed in a polar organic<br>
solvent in the presence of a base, at the temperature of 10 -100° C, for 1- 48 hours, and with<br>
the ratio of 1:0.8 -1:3 of the compound of the formula (II) and the compound of the formula<br>
(III).<br>
5.	The Compound as claimed in claim 1, as and when used for preparation of pharmaceutical compositions containing an antiviral compound of the general formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles.</td>
