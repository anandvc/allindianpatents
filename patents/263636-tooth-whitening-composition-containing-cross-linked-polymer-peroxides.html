				<td>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001]    This application claims priority to United States Provisional Application Serial No. 60/640,656, filed December 30,2004, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]    Stained, yellowed or discolored teeth are almost inevitable due to the absorbent nature of dental material. Everyday activities such as smoking or other oral use of tobacco products, and eating, chewing or drinking certain foods and beverages (in particular coffee, tea and red wine) cause undesirable staining of surfaces of teeth. Staining can also result from microbial activity, including that associated with dental plaque. Even with regular brushing and flossing, years of chromogen accumulation can impart noticeable tooth discoloration.<br>
[0003]    Professional dental treatments frequently include a tooth surface preparation such as acid etching followed by the application of highly concentrated bleaching solutions (e.g., up to 37% hydrogen peroxide) and/or the application of heat or light These procedures provide rapid results, but are expensive, and often require several trips to the dentist. In many cases, the patient's lips are uncomfortably retracted during the entire treatment and the patient is confined to sitting in the dental chair.<br>
[0004]    Alternatively, at home bleaching systems can be used. These systems have gained significant popularity in the past decade because of reduced cost, and increased convenience. Instead of time consuming and frequent trips to the dentist, the tooth whitener is purchased at a consumer retail store and may be used while performing other personal tasks or errands, relaxing or sleeping.<br>
[0005]    Current home treatment methods include abrasive toothpastes, toothpastes that produce oxides, whitening gels for use with a dental tray and whitening strips. The effectiveness of such techniques depends on a variety of factors including the type and intensity of the stain, the type of bleaching agent, contact time of the bleaching agent on the teeth, the amount of available bleaching active in the composition, the ability of the bleaching agent to penetrate the tooth enamel, and consumer compliance. Effectiveness is<br>
also dependant on the amount of bleaching active in the composition, the ability of the active to be released during use, and the stability of the active in the product. However, the effectiveness of many of these treatments is adversely affected because of deficiencies intone or more factors relating to the composition and consumer compliance.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]    The present invention provides oral care compositions that include a peroxide composite comprising a peroxide compound and a porous cross-linked polymer. An orally acceptable carrier may also be included.<br>
[0007]    In various embodiments, the polymer comprises a polymerized polyunsaturated monomer selected from the group consisting of polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, polyitaconates, and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the carrier comprises a film forming material. Methods are also provided for whitening a tooth surface, comprising applying a safe and effective amount of a peroxide composite comprising a peroxide compound and a porous cross-linked polymer.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008]    It has been discovered that compositions and methods of this invention may afford advantages over oral care compositions among known in the art, including one or more of enhanced whitening efficacy, provision of a higher available concentration of bleaching agent, tooth adherence in the presence of saliva without the use of a dental tray, and sustained and/or controlled release of the bleaching agent.<br>
[0009]    The present invention provides oral care compositions and methods for administration or application to, or use with, a human or other animal subject.<br>
[0010]    The present invention provides compositions comprising a peroxide composite. The peroxide composite is preferably present at a level of about 0.5% to about 60%, optionally about 1% to about 50%, optionally about 5% to about 40%, optionally about 10% to about 25%.<br>
[0011]    The peroxide composite may include a peroxide compound and a porous cross-linked polymer. As referred to herein, a "peroxide compound" is an oxidizing compound comprising a bivalent oxygen-oxygen group. Peroxide compounds include peroxides and hydroperoxides, such as hydrogen peroxide, peroxides of alkali and alkaline earth metals, organic peroxy compounds, peroxy acids, pharmaceutically-acceptable salts<br>
thereof, and mixtures thereof.   Peroxides of alkali and alkaline earth metals include lithium peroxide, potassium peroxide, sodium peroxide, magnesium peroxide, calcium peroxide, barium peroxide, and mixtures thereof. Organic peroxy compounds include carbamide peroxide (also known as urea hydrogen peroxide), glyceryl hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydrogen peroxides, dialkyl peroxides, alkyl peroxy acids, peroxy esters, diacyl peroxides, benzoyl peroxide, and monoperoxyphthalate, and mixtures thereof. Peroxy acids and their salts include organic peroxy acids such as alkyl peroxy acids, and monoperoxyphthalate and mixtures thereof, as well as inorganic peroxy acid salts such as persulfate, dipersulfate, percarbonate, perphosphate, perborate and persilicate salts of alkali and alkaline earth metals such as lithium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium and barium, and mixtures thereof. In various embodiments, the peroxide compound comprises hydrogen peroxide, urea peroxide, sodium percarbonate and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the peroxide compound comprises hydrogen peroxide. In one embodiment, the peroxide compound consists essentially of hydrogen peroxide.<br>
[0012]    The peroxide composite comprises a porous cross-linked polymer. As referred to herein, a "porous cross-linked polymer" is a particulate polymer material which is operable to sorb a peroxide compound. The term "sorb" refers to the "sorptive" (or "sorption") capability of the polymer particles to adsorb, absorb, complex, or otherwise retain a peroxide compound. As used herein, "porous" refers to the presence of voids or interstices between cross-linked polymers that increases the overall surface area of the polymer beyond a solely perimeter measurement. Without limiting the mechanism, function or utility of present invention, it is understood in some embodiments that the composite comprises polymeric particulates having a non-smooth surface and an irregular polymeric matrix in which the peroxide compound is retained. These chemical and physical characteristics of the particulate hinder the release of the peroxide compound from the polymer particulates, and in some embodiments provides sustained release of the peroxide compound.<br>
[0013]    In various embodiments, the polymer comprises porous particulates having a BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller method) pore volume of about 0.05 to about 0.3 cc/g, optionally about 0.1 to about 0.2 cc/g, optionally about 0.14 to about 0.16 cc/g.

In one embodiment, the carrier comprises a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) composition, including those that are well known in the art. Generally, silicone based PSA's are produced by condensing a silicone resin and an organosiloxane such as a polydiorganosilioxane. Suitable silicone polymers include the copolymer product of mixing a silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane such as polydimethyl siloxane with a silanol-containing silicone resin whereby the silanol groups of the polydiorganosiloxane undergo a condensation reaction with the silanol groups of the silicone resin so that the polydiorganosiloxane is lightly crosslinked by the silicone resin (that is, the polydiorganosiloxane chains are bonded together through the resin molecules to give chain branching and entanglement and/or a small amount of network character) to form the silicone<br>
pressure sensitive adhesive. A catalyst (for example, an alkaline material such as ammonia, ammonium hydroxide or ammonium carbonate) can be mixed with the silanol-terminated polydiorganosiloxane and the silicone resin to promote this crosslinking reaction. Copolymerizing the silicone resin with the silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane affords a self adhering and cohesive soft elastomer matrix. Modifying the silicone resin to polydiorganosiloxane ratio of the pressure sensitive adhesive will modify the tackiness of the oral care composition. For example PSAs are available from the Dow-Corning Corporation, Midland, Michigan, U.S.A., under the brand name BIO-PSA.

[0057]    The present invention provides methods for whitening a tooth surface using compositions according to the present invention. As referred to herein, "tooth" or "teeth" refers to natural teeth, dentures, dental plates, fillings, caps, crowns, bridges, dental implants, and the like, and any other hard surfaced dental prosthesis either permanently or temporarily fixed within the oral cavity. As used herein, "whitening" refers to a change in visual appearance of a tooth, preferably such that such that the tooth has an increase in whiteness. Increase in whiteness of a dental surface can be observed visually, for example<br>
with the aid of color comparison charts or gauges, or measured by colorimetry, using any suitable instrument such as a Minolta Chromameter, e.g., model CR-400 (Minolta Corp., Ramsey, NJ). The instrument can be programmed, for example, to measure Hunter Lab values or L*a*b* values according to the standard established by the International Committee of Illumination (CIE). The L*a*b* system provides a numerical representation of three-dimensional color space where L* represents a lightness axis, a* represents a red-green axis and b* represents a yellow-blue axis. The L* and b* axes are typically of greatest applicability to measurement of tooth whiteness. Increase in whiteness can be computed from differences in L*, a* and b* values before and after treatment, or between untreated and treated surfaces. A useful parameter is AE*, calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of differences in L*, a* and b* values, using the formula: AE* = [(AL*)2 + (Aa*)2 + (Ab*)2]l/2<br>
A higher value of AE* indicates greater increase in whiteness. In various embodiments, the method of the present invention can effect a AE* of at least about 1, or at least about 3, or at least about 5.<br>
[0058]    Accordingly, the present invention provides methods for whitening a tooth surface, comprising applying to the surface a safe and effective amount of a peroxide composite comprising a peroxide compound and a porous cross-linked polymer. Preferably the method comprises applying a composition of the present invention, comprising the peroxide composite and a carrier. As referred to herein, "applying" refers to any method by which the peroxide composite is placed in contact with the tooth surface. Such methods, in various embodiments, comprise direct application of a composition by such methods as rinsing, painting, and brushing. In various embodiments, application of the composition comprises the use of an application device which aids in maintaining contact of the composite to the tooth surface for sufficient time so as to allow whitening.<br>
[0059]    In one preferred embodiment, the whitening composition is applied using a "paint on" technique. A small application device, such as a brush or spatula is coated with a composition of this invention and the composition is then placed on a tooth surface. Preferably, the composition be spread evenly on such surfaces, in sufficient quantity to deliver a whitening amount of peroxide composite.<br>
 [0060]    The present invention also provides methods for effecting the controlled release of an oxidizing peroxide species onto a tooth surface, comprising contacting the surface with a peroxide composite of the present invention. As referred to herein, such controlled release in various embodiments comprises sustained release of the peroxide composite. Without limiting the mechanism, function or utility of present invention, in some embodiments contact with saliva causes the slow release of peroxide active from the cross-linked polymer matrix to the applied tooth site. The slow release provides enhanced whitening by providing a constant supply of an effective amount of peroxide over a prolonged period of time. Preferably, the composition is contacted with the tooth surface for at least about 30 seconds, optionally at least about 1 minute.<br>
[0061]    The present invention is further illustrated through the following non-limiting examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
[0062]     A composition of the present invention is made by combining the ingredients shown in Table I, below:(Table removed) <br>
[0063]    The composition is applied to the teeth of a human subject having stained teeth, resulting in perceptible whitening. The composition is determined to provide a AE value of about 5. Example 2<br>
[0064]        A composition of the present invention is made by combining the ingredients show in Table II, below:<br>
Table II(Table removed) <br>
Example 3<br>
[0065]        Compositions of the present invention are made by combining the ingredients of Table III, below<br>
Table III(Table removed) <br>
[0066J    The resulting composition is subjected to accelerated aging (105°F/120°F) for several weeks, and remains stable with more than 90% of the peroxide remaining. An in vitro hydrogen peroxide retention test is also conducted for the composition. The results of the test, set forth in the following table, show that the composition has a retention of hydrogen peroxide over time. (Table removed) <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
