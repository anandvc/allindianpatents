MITSUBISHI HEAVY INDUSTRIES, LTD., A JAPANESE CORPORATION, WHOSE ADDRESS IS 16-5, KONAN 2-CHOME, MINATO-KU, TOKYO 1088215, JAPAN.<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
 <br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method and to an apparatus for treating exhaust gas by removing nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and mercury from exhaust gas discharged from a combustion apparatus such as a boiler. BACKGROUND ART<br>
Among methods for treating exhaust gas in which N0X is removed from exhaust gas in a reduction denitration unit and then SO2 is removed in a wet desulfurization unit using an alkaline absorbing solution as an absorbent, there has been researched a method for treating metallic mercury and a mercury compound (hereinafter, collectively referred to as mercury, unless otherwise stated) in exhaust gas while performing denitration and desulfurization at the same time.<br>
Mercury in flue gas exists in forms of metallic mercury which are insoluble in water, and mercury chloride which is soluble in water. When in the form of metallic mercury, mercury is difficult to dissolve in water. When mercury is in the metallic form, the<br>
<br>
 <br>
efficiency of removing mercury by a wet desulfurization unit is decreased. Conversely, when mercury is in the form of HgCl or HgCl2, KgCl or HgCl2 in exhaust gas it may be dissolved in water through the gas-liquid contact in the wet desulfurization unit, and thereby mercury can be removed. In other words, if metallic mercury can be converted into mercury chloride in the presence of a catalyst such as a denitration catalyst, mercury can be removed in the desulfurization unit located downstream.<br>
An example of such a conventional method for treating exhaust gas utilizing this scheme will be described with reference to Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, a NH3 supply spot 20 and a supply spot 21 are provided in a flow path from a boiler 10 to a reduction denitration unit 60. At the NH3 supply spot 20, NH3 supplied from a NH3 tank 30 is injected into exhaust gas. At the supply spot 21, a mercury-chlorinating agent such as HC1 is injected into the exhaust gas from a tank 40 for supplying the mercury-chlorinating agent. The exhaust gas from the boiler 10 is introduced into the reduction denitration unit 60. In the reduction denitration unit 60, NH3 and N0X in the exhaust gas into which NH3 and HC1 are injected react with each other, and simultaneously metallic Hg is oxidized to HgCl2 in the presence of HC1. After passing through an air heater 70 and a heat collector 80, the soot and dust are removed in a dust collector 90. Then, SO2 and HgCl2 in the exhaust gas 'are simultaneously removed in a wet desulfurization unit 100. At this point, an<br>
 <br>
excessive amount of HC1 is contained in the exhaust gas having passed through the reduction denitration unit 60, but is never discharged from a stack, since HC1 is absorbed by an alkaline aqueous solution such as lime milk in the desulfurization Unit 100. Together with the above-described method, a system in which a chlorinating agent such as HC1 is sprayed upstream of a denitration catalyst to oxidize<br>
(chlorinate) mercury on the catalyst, and then the mercury is removed in a wet desulfurization unit located downstream thereof<br>
(see, for example,Patent Literature 1) hQS been proposed.<br>
Patent Literature 1:JP 10-230137 A<br>
DJ.SCLQSLLBLE   OF  T.HE  JNVENTJQN<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
However, there is a problem in that the chlorination reaction of mercury contained in the exhaust gas which takes place on the denitration catalyst is inhibited by incompletely combusted components (CO, HC) of coal or the like,  AS the incompletely combusted components hinders the mercury chlorination reaction, a larger amount of the mercury-chlorinating agent needs to be added in order to chlorinate mercury contained in the exhaust gas. Particularly, in a case of a coal with a low ci content, an excessive amount of a mercury-chlorinating agent sucl^ as HC1 must be supplied into the exhaust gas so as to maintain the rate of conversion to mercury chloride.  Moreover, in order to vaporize HC1, a high-temperature heat source, steam, or the like is needed.<br>
 <br>
Furthermore, in addition to NH3, which is considered hazardous in power plants, highly corrosive HC1 is used, which induces material corrosion, thereby presenting problems of increased utility and storage costs.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method and an apparatus for treating exhaust gas which are capable of reducing the amount of a highly corrosive mercury-halogenating agent such as a mercury-chlorinating agent to be added in an exhaust gas treatment with the mercury-removing efficiency maintained high. MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
In order to achieve the above-described object,- according to the present invention, a method for treating combustion exhaust gas from a boiler which contains N0X, S0X and mercury comprises the steps of: adding a mercury-halogenating agent and ammonia to the combustion exhaust gas; bringing the combustion exhaust gas which the mercury-halogenating agent and ammonia were added to into contact with a CO/HC oxidation catalyst; subjecting the combustion exhaust gas contacted with the CO/HC oxidation catalyst to reduction denitration in the presence  of  a solid catalyst, and oxidizing metallic mercury to halogenated mercury; and wet-desulfurizing the combustion exhaust gas subjected to the reduction denitration with an alkaline absorbing solution, and removing the halogenated mercury with the alkaline absorbing solution.<br>
 <br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, a method for treating combustion exhaust gas from a boiler which contains N0X, S0X, and mercury includes the steps of: bringing the combustion exhaust gas into contact with a CO/HC oxidation catalyst; adding a mercury-halogenating agent and ammonia to the combustion exhaust gas contacted with the CO/HC oxidation catalyst; subjecting the combustion exhaust gas, which the mercury-halogenating agent and ammonia have been added to, to reduction denitration simultaneously with oxidizing metallic mercury to halogenated mercury in the presence of a solid catalyst; and wet-desulfurizing the combustion exhaust gas subjected to the reduction denitration with an alkaline absorbing solution, and removing the halogenated mercury with the alkaline absorbing solution.<br>
The method for treating exhaust gas preferably further includes a step of bringing the exhaust gas into contact with a SO3 reduction catalyst after the addition of the<br>
mercury-chlorinating agent and ammonia but before the reduction denitration. Furthermore, the mercury-halogenating agent is preferably ammonium chloride or HC1. Moreover, it is preferable that the CO/HC oxidation catalyst is a catalyst comprising: at least one selected from the group consisting of Ti02, Si02, Zr02, AI2O3 and zeolite as a support; and at least one selected from the group consisting of Pt, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, Au, Ag, V, W, Mo, Ni, Co, Fe,<br>
 <br>
Cr, Cu and Mn as an active component, wherein the active component is supported on the support.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for treating combustion exhaust gas containing N0X, S0X and mercury comprises in sequence: a mercury-halogenating-agent injection unit for adding a mercury-halogenating agent to the combustion exhaust gas, and an ammonia injection unit for injecting ammonia into the combustion exhaust gas; a CO/HC oxidation catalyst for oxidizing an incompletely combusted component in the combustion -exbaust   gas;   a  reduction  denitration  unit   for subjecting  the combustion exhaust gas to reduction denitration in the presence of a solid catalyst; and a wet desulfurization unit for wet desulfurization with an alkaline absorbing solution.<br>
According to still another aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for treating combustion exhaust gas containing N0X, S0X and mercury comprises in sequence: a Co/HC oxidation catalyst for oxidizing an incompletely combusted component in the combustion exhaust gas; a mercury-halogenating-agent injection unit for adding a mercury-halogenating agent to the combustion exhaust gas, and an ammonia injection unit for injecting ammonia into the combustion exhaust gas; a reduction denitration unit for subjecting the combustion exhaust gas to reduction denitration in the presence of a solid catalyst; and a wet desulfurization unit for<br>
 <br>
wet-desulfurizing reduction-denitrated combustion exhaust gas with an alkaline absorbing solution. EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to a method for treating exhaust gas of the present invention, incompletely combusted components contained in the exhaust gas are removed with a CO/HC oxidation catalyst, and then the exhaust gas is subjected to reduction denitration in the presence of a solid catalyst.  Thereby, inhibition of the mercury halogenation reaction by CO and HC can be avoided, and the mercury halogenation reaction can be  efficiently carried out with a small amount of a mercury-halogenating agent.  This makes it possible to reduce the amount of highly corrosive HC1 used as the mercury-halogenating agent.  Thus, the concern about flue corrosion can be lessened.  Furthermore, it is made possible to suppress energy used for a heat source, steam, or the like needed to vaporize HC1. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

BEST	MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
One embodiment of an apparatus for treating exhaust gas according to the present invention will be described with reference<br>
 <br>
to the attached drawings.  It should be noted that the present invention is not limited to embodiments described below.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows one embodiment of the apparatus for treating exhaust gas. As shown in Fig. 1, the present apparatus comprises a boiler 10, a NH3 supply spot 20 where NH3 is injected, a mercury-halogenating-agent injection spot 21 where a mercury-halogenating agent is injected, a CO/HC oxidation catalyst 50, a denitration unit 60, an air heater 70, a heat collector 80, a dust collector 90, a desulfurization unit 100, a reheater 120, and a stack 130, which are sequentially provided in a flow path of exhaust gas.  To the NH3 supply spot 20, a NH3 tank 30 is connected. To the mercury-halogenating-agent injection spot 21, a mercury-halogenating-agent tank 40 is connected.  Between the mercury-halogenating-agent injection spot 21 and the mercury-halogenating-agent tank 40, a mercury-halogenating-agent flow-amount control valve 41 is provided which controls the flow amount of the mercury-halogenating agent.  Between the dust collector 90 and the desulfurization unit 100, a mercury-halogenating-agent monitor is provided which detects the concentration of the mercury-halogenating agent in the gas. Between the desulfurization unit 100 and the reheater 120, an Hg monitor is provided which detects the concentration of Hg in the gas.  A mercury-halogenating-agent supply-amount control unit is provided which receives detection data of the mercury- halogenating<br>
 <br>
agent monitor and the Hg monitor and which transmits, to the flow-amount control valve 41, the amount of the mercury-halogenating agent to be supplied.<br>
Fig. 1 shows that an exhaust gas to be treated in the present invention is an exhaust gas from the boiler 10 of thermal power plants, factories, or the like where fuels such as coal, heavy oil, and the like containing sulfur, mercury, anci the like are combusted. Besides, the exhaust gas may be an exhaust gas from furnaces of metal factories, petroleum refineries, petrochemical factories, and the like. Preferably,, the exhaust gas to be treated is an exhaust gas which has a low NOx concentration, contains carbon dioxide, oxygen, SOx, dust or water, and is discharged in a large amount.<br>
Ammonia is injected into the exhaust gas from the NH3 tank 30 in a conventional way. As NH3 injection means, one made of a NH3 injection pipe and multiple spray nozzles is used. As the injection method, a method in which NH3 is vaporized and diluted by adding air, inert gas, water vapor, or the like thereto, and is then injected, can be adopted. In this event, it is effective to arrange the nozzles so that the reducing agent can flow uniformly to the catalyst at the downstream side. In some cases, the multiple nozzles are arranged in a direction perpendicular to the gas flow.<br>
 <br>
An additive that produces a water-soluble metal compound is not limited only to the mercury-chlorinating agent.  Other than chlorine-based agents, halogens such as bromine and bromine compounds such as HBr, Br2, and CaBr2 can be used.  Thus, in the present invention, as the additive injected to oxidize mercury, bromine-based mercury-halogenating agents such as bromine, HBr, Br2, and CaBr2 can be used. Meanwhile, the mercury-halogenating agent in the mercury-halogenating-agent tank 40 refers to a chlorinating agent that produces HgCl2 and/or HgCl when mercury in the exhaust gas reacts with the mercury-chlorinating agent in the presence of a catalyst.  Examples thereof include HCl, ammonium chloride, chlorine, hypochlorous acid, ammonium hypochlorite, chlorous acid, ammonium chlorite, chloric acid, ammonium chlorate, perchloric acid, ammonium perchlorate, and amine salts or other salts of the above-described acids.<br>
The amount of the mercury-halogenating agent added into the exhaust gas may be a stoichiometric amount of poorly water-soluble mercury such as metallic mercury or slightly more than that amount. In a case in which coal or heavy oil is used as the fuel, the concentration of the mercury-halogenating agent added into the exhaust gas is 1000 ppm or less for the exhaust gas, and is actually approximately 10 to 500 ppm.<br>
 <br>
As a chemical agent for the addition when HC1 is used as the mercury-halogenating agent, hydrogen chloride or hydrochloric acid may be used. The concentration of hydrochloric acid is not particularly limited. For example, concentrated hydrochloric acid to approximately 5% diluted hydrochloric acid can be exemplified. As a unit for adding HC1 to the exhaust gas, a<br>
conventionally-available metering pump for liguid chemicals may be used. Alternatively, HC1 may be atomized in a way that HCl is sprayed or vaporized by using a spray grid or a vaporizer.  Meanwhile, when salts such as ammonium chloride are added, it is preferable to use an aqueous solution of the salt. Note that, in the case of a compound that evaporates (or may sublimate) in the exhaust gas, a compound which is in a solid state can be used.  Incidentally, the mercury-halogenating agent may be added before or after ammonia is added to the exhaust gas.<br>
As the CO/HC oxidation catalyst 50, a NH3 decomposition catalyst that is conventionally used (JP-A 2004-237244) can be employed. Specifically, examples of the CO/HC oxidation catalyst 50 include catalysts in which at least one selected from the group consisting of Pt, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, V, W, Mo, Ni, Co, Fe, Cr, Cu and Mn as an active component is supported on at least one selected from the group consisting of Ti02, Si02, Zr02/ A1203 and zeolite as a support. Here, from the viewpoint of durability to sulfur oxide contained in the exhaust gas, titanium oxide or silicon oxide is<br>
 <br>
particularly preferably used as the support.  Preferable activities are obtained from catalysts in  which oxides of noble metals such as Pt, Ru, Pd and Ir, vanadium, tungsten, molybdenum, or the like as the active metal species are supported on complex oxides containing Ti02 or Si02 as the support.<br>
In the present invention, in order to increase the specific surface area and solid acid amount of the CO/HC oxidation catalyst, Ti oxide in the form of a complex oxide can be used as the support. Examples of a metal forming the Ti complex oxide include silicon (Si) , zirconium (Zr] , aluminium (All , and tungsten (W) . Complex oxides of, for example, Ti and Si, Ti and Zr, Ti and Al, and Ti and W can be used. Since all of these complex oxides are less likely to form sulfate, the stable structure can be maintained. Thus, the specific surface area and the solid acid amount can be increased. Moreover, as necessary, complex oxides of a three-component system such as Ti and Si+Zr, Ti and Si+W, Ti and Si+Al, Ti and Zr+Al, and Ti and Zr+W can be used. In the CO/HC oxidation catalyst of the present invention, at least one selected from the group consisting of Pt, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, V, W, Mo, Ni, Co, Fe, Cr, Cu and Mn can be used as the active component supported on the support described above.<br>
The composition ratio of the catalyst used in the present invention is not particularly limited. As one preferable example,<br>
 <br>
when the active component is an oxide of base metal elements such as V, W, Mo, Ni, Co, Fe, Cr, Cu and Mn, the composition of the active component is 0.5 to 20 parts by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of a support consisting of one kind of the oxide or complex oxide; alternatively, when the active component is a noble metal element such as Pt, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, Au and Ag, the composition of the metal is preferably 0 . 01 to 2 parts by weight. More specifically, relative to 100 parts by weight of a Ti02 support, a composition with the active component of 0.02 parts by weight of Pt can be used (JP 2004-237244 A) . Alternatively, a dual function catalyst described in Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-215818 can be used in place of the NH3 decomposition catalyst.<br>
Moreover, any shape of the CO/HC oxidation catalyst 50 can be selected in accordance with the system configuration. Any integrally molded shape such as a pellet shape, plate shape, cylindrical shape, corrugated shape, and honeycomb shape can be adopted, for example.<br>
As a solid catalyst used in the denitration unit 60, one obtained by, for example, a catalyst in which metal oxides such as V, W and Mo are supported on a support such as titania, silica, zirconia, complex oxides of these, and/or zeolite can be used. Moreover, as the solid catalyst, a honeycomb-shaped catalyst, one<br>
 <br>
formed by layering such catalysts, one formed by packing granular catalysts, or the like is used.<br>
The desulfurization unit 100 may be a type generally used in a flue gas treatment such as a wet desulfurization unit or a desulfurization unit in which a cooling tower is provided upstream of an absorption tower. Thus, the desulfurization unit 100 is not particularly limited, and a generally available wet desulfurization unit can be used. Examples of the absorbing solution used in wet desulfurization include aqueous solutions of absorbents (alkaline absorbing solutionl such as calcium carbonate, calcium, oxide, calcium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and caustic soda.<br>
The heat collector 80 and the reheater 120 are each constituted of a gas heater having a system in which heat energy is exchanged with a heat medium being used as a medium of the gas heater. Here, it is only necessary that the heat collector 80 and the reheater 120 each decrease or increase the temperature of the exhaust gas. The heat collector 80 and the reheater 120 may be separate systems, or gas-gas heaters that directly exchange heat.<br>
According to the above-described configuration, first, NH3 and a mercury-halogenating agent, for example, HC1 respectively from the NH3 tank 30 and the mercury-halogenating-agent tank 40 are supplied into exhaust gas from the boiler 10.  Then, the exhaust<br>
 <br>
gas is introduced into the unit including the CO and a HC oxidation catalyst, and incompletely combusted components, CO and HC, in the exhaust gas are oxidized. Examples of the oxidation reaction are shown below. Note that HC in the exhaust gas exists in the state of HCHO, C2H4 or C6H6, for example.<br>
CO+l/202-*C02<br>
HC+02-*C02+H20<br>
The exhaust gas with the incompletely combusted components being oxidized is introduced into the denitration unit 60.  In the denitration unit 60, NH3 reacts with NOx, and simultaneously metallic Hg is oxidized to HgCl2 in the presence of HC1.  Examples of these reactions are shown below.<br>
4NO+4NH3+02-&gt;4N2+6H20<br>
Hg+2BCl+l/202-HgCl2+H20<br>
At this point, CO and HC contained in the exhaust gas inhibit the mercury oxidation reaction.<br>
HgCl2+C0+H20-Hg + 2HCl+C02 HgCl2+HC+H20+02-&gt;-Hg+2HCl+C02<br>
However, in the present invention, CO and HC in the exhaust gas are removed by the oxidation catalyst in advance.  Thus, inhibition of the mercury oxidation reaction in the denitration unit 60 can be suppressed.  Thereafter, the exhaust gas passes<br>
 <br>
through the air heater 70, the heat collector 80 and the dust collector 90, and the soot and dust are removed.  The exhaust gas with the soot and dust being removed therefrom is introduced into the desulfurization unit 100, and S02 as well as HgCl2 are simultaneously removed.  The exhaust gas treated with the desulfurization unit 100 is released to the air from the stack 130. In the reheater 120, the combustion exhaust gas whose temperature has been decreased is heated by heat energy collected by the heat collector 80 located upstream of the desulfurization unit 100. When the combustion exhaust gas is released, the gas is purified and then heated to be turned into high-temperature gas. Thereafter, the gas is discharged.<br>
As described above, according to one embodiment of the present invention, the CO/HC oxidation catalyst 50 is provided upstream of the denitration catalyst 60. Thereby, inhibition of the mercury oxidation reaction with the denitration catalyst caused by the incompletely combusted components (CO, EC) of coal or the like can be avoided. As a result, the mercury oxidation reaction by the mercury-halogenating agent can be efficiently promoted.<br>
In a conventional apparatus for treating exhaust gas, exhaust gas entering the denitration unit contains an excessive amount of mercury-halogenating agent for oxidizing mercury, which is added by an HCl/HBr spray unit, a NH4C1 supply unit, or the like.  In<br>
 <br>
particular, a large amount of a mercury-halogenating agent must be added to exhaust gas with a low CI content. For this reason, there has been a concern that highly corrosive HC1 may corrode the flue. However, according to the one embodiment of the present invention, the amount of a mercury-halogenating agent added to oxidize mercury contained in the exhaust gas can be suppressed to be an extremely small amount. As a result, the concern about the corrosion of the flue by highly corrosive HC1 can be ameliorated. Furthermore, it is possible to reduce the amount of HC1 added as the mercury-halogenating agent as well as the utility cost for a high-temperature heat source, steam, or the like to vaporize HC1.<br>
In addition, another embodiment of the present invention will be described. Fig. 2 shows this embodiment. The same constituents as those in Fig. 1 are denoted by the same reference numerals, and the description thereof will be omitted. As shown in Fig. 2, in this embodiment, the CO/HC oxidation catalyst 50 is provided upstream of the denitration unit 60 and before the NH3 and the mercury-halogenating-agent supply spots 20, 21.<br>
According to this configuration, incompletely combusted components in the exhaust gas discharged from the boiler 10 can be oxidized with the CO/HC oxidation catalyst 50 without being influenced from NH3 and a mercury-halogenating agent, for example, HC1, which are subsequently supplied.<br>
 <br>
Thus, the exhaust gas containing NH3 and HC1 which are subsequently supplied can be efficiently subjected to the oxidation reaction of mercury contained in the exhaust gas with the denitration catalyst.  Thereafter, the exhaust gas passes through the air heater 70 and the heat collector 80, and the soot and dust are removed by the dust collector 90.  After that, SO2 and HgCl2 in the exhaust gas are simultaneously removed in the wet desulfurization unit 100 in the same way as in the embodiment in Fig. 1.<br>
Note that, in the other embodiment of the present invention, there is a concern that the amount of SO3 in the exhaust gas increases. This is because of the arrangement of the CO/HC oxidation catalyst 50, which relatively increases the following reaction.<br>
S02+l/202-s-S03<br>
For this reason, although not shown in Fig. 2, a conventionally-used S03 reduction catalyst can be provided between the NH3 and mercury-halogenating-agent supply spots 20, 21 and the denitration catalyst 60. Thereby, after the oxidation treatment on CO and HC, without increasing the amount of S03 in the exhaust gas, the oxidation reaction of mercury contained in the exhaust-gas flow can be promoted on the denitration catalyst. Meanwhile, since the SO3 reduction catalyst can oxidize CO and HC, a catalyst having<br>
 <br>
a S03 reduction function can be used as the CO/HC oxidation catalyst 50 in Fig. 1. An example thereof includes a catalyst shown in JP 2006-136869 A. EXAMPLE<br>
A test was carried out for the mercury oxidation activity when the different concentrations of CO and HC (benzene) were added as shown in Tables 2 and 3 based on the test conditions in Table 1.<br>
Table 1<br>

Table 3<br>
<br>
condition	C6H6 [ppm]	Mercury Oxidation rate [%]<br>
1	0	95.5<br>

 <br>
In this test for the mercury oxidation activity, honeycomb-shaped solid catalysts (each with 6 holes * 7 holes, 500 mm long) were provided at three stages, and exhaust gas samples having compositions of 02 to NOx described in Table 1 were allowed to flow therethrough under the conditions in Tables 1 to 3. Note that, in the table, Ugs means superficial velocity, and AV means the amount of gas to be treated based on gas-contact area.<br>
When CO was 0 ppm (Condition 1), the mercury oxidation rate was 95.5%, whereas, when CO was 1QQ ppm (.Condition Z\ , the mercury oxidation rate was lowered to 92 . 0% . When CO was 500 ppm (Condition 3), the oxidation rate was further lowered to 77.0%. Meanwhile, when 5 ppm of benzene (C6H6) was added as an example of HC (Condition 4}, the mercury oxidation rate was lowered to 80.0%.<br>
Accordingly, it was found that, in a system in which the CO/HC oxidation catalyst is arranged upstream of the denitration catalyst to reduce the amount of CO and HC that reach the denitration catalyst, the denitration catalyst is capable of maintaining a highly efficient mercury oxidation rate, and the excessive supply of HC1 to increase the mercury oxidation rate can be avoided.<br>
