				<td>Security Element Having Liquid Crystal Layers<br>
The present invention relates to a security element, for security papers, value<br>
documents and the like, having two stacked layers composed of cholesteric<br>
liquid crystal material that each reflect, in a first viewing direction normal to<br>
their surface, selectively light from a first, longer-wave spectral range, and<br>
reflect, in a second viewing direction at an angle to the normal to their<br>
surface, selectively light from a second, shorter-wave spectral range.<br>
For protection, valuable articles such as branded articles and value<br>
documents are often furnished with security elements that permit the<br>
authenticity of the valuable article to be verified, and that simultaneously<br>
serve as protection against unauthorized reproduction. In many cases, the<br>
particular properties of liquid crystal materials are exploited for this<br>
purpose, and especially the viewing-angle-dependent color impression of<br>
liquid crystal layers, which is referred to in the following as a color-shift<br>
effect.<br>
Due to the physical properties, the color-shift effect of a single liquid crystal<br>
layer always causes a shift in the reflected light wavelength from a longer-<br>
wave range to a shorter-wave range when the liquid crystal layer is tilted out<br>
of the vertical viewing direction.<br>
To increase the spectrum of achievable color effects, it has thus been<br>
proposed to combine multiple liquid crystal layers having different color-<br>
shift effects. For example, publication EP 0 720 753 Bl describes a colored<br>
material having two stacked chiral liquid crystal polymer lamina, one lamina<br>
reflecting infrared light when viewed normal to its surface, and red light<br>
when viewed at an angle to the normal to its surface. The second lamina<br>
reflects blue light when viewed normal to its surface, and ultraviolet light<br>
when viewed at an angle to the normal to its surface.<br><br>
If such a layer arrangement is viewed normal to its main surface, it appears<br>
blue, since the first lamina reflects infrared light and thus appears<br>
transparent. In contrast, when viewed obliquely, the layer arrangement<br>
appears red, since then the second lamina reflects ultraviolet light and thus<br>
appears transparent. Overall, the layer arrangement thus displays a reverse<br>
color-shift effect compared with normal liquid crystal layers, from blue to<br>
red.<br>
However, what is problematic in many security elements having liquid<br>
crystal layers is that contrasting motif portions in which the brightness of<br>
different motif portions changes upon tilting, or the contrast ratios reverse,<br>
and in practice are sometimes difficult to perceive. Other embodiments in<br>
which liquid crystal layers are combined with conventional semitransparent<br>
ink layers require great effort for good depiction quality.<br>
Based on that, the object of the present invention is to avoid the<br>
disadvantages of the background art and especially to specify a security<br>
element of the kind cited above having a conspicuous visual tilt effect and<br>
high counterfeit security.<br>
This object is solved by the security element having the features of the main<br>
claim. A corresponding manufacturing method and a data carrier furnished<br>
with such a security element are specified in the coordinated claims.<br>
Developments of the present invention are the subject of the dependent<br>
claims.<br>
According to the present invention, in a generic security element, it is<br>
provided that<br><br>
a first of the two liquid crystal layers is present in the form of a motif<br>
to be depicted and reflects light from the green spectral range in the<br>
first viewing direction, and that<br>
the second of the two liquid crystal layers reflects light from the green<br>
spectral range in the second viewing direction.<br>
As explained in greater detail in the following, the inventive coordination of<br>
the color-shift effects of the liquid crystal layers with the dependence of the<br>
sensitivity of the human eye on the light wavelength facilitates a surprising<br>
and visually impressive tilt effect: When the security element is viewed from<br>
above, the motif to be depicted appears for a viewer with brightly shining<br>
green against a clearly contrasting background. If the viewer tilts the security<br>
element out of the vertical in an oblique viewing direction, then the motif<br>
disappears and a uniform green surface without perceptible contrast<br>
differences appears as the image impression.<br>
Here, in the context of the present invention, the green spectral range<br>
comprises all wavelengths that evoke in the viewer a substantially green<br>
color impression. The first layer is preferably developed such that it reflects<br>
in the first viewing direction light from the wavelength range between<br>
490 nm and 590 nm, particularly preferably between 520 nm and 570 ran.<br>
Similarly, the second layer is preferably developed such that it reflects in the<br>
second viewing direction light from the wavelength range between 490 nm<br>
and 590 nm, particularly preferably between 520 nm and 570 nm.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, the first layer is developed such that it<br>
reflects in the second viewing direction light from the blue or ultraviolet<br>
spectral range. The second layer advantageously reflects in the first viewing<br>
direction light from the red or infrared spectral range.<br><br>
Both layers are expediently arranged on a substrate, the first layer being<br>
arranged underneath the second layer in a first variant of the present<br>
invention. However, the sequence of the two liquid crystal layers plays no<br>
role for the effect according to the present invention, such that, alternatively,<br>
the first layer can also be arranged over the second layer.<br>
To increase the visual conspicuousness of the color-shift effects, the substrate<br>
preferably includes a light-absorbing background. The substrate can<br>
especially include a dark, for example black, background or, to be able to<br>
systematically influence the color impression of the liquid crystal layers, also<br>
a light-absorbing colored background.<br>
Also, a substrate having a light-diffractive background, especially having a<br>
diffractive black background, may be used since, through such a<br>
background, the color effect of the liquid crystals is likewise emphasized.<br>
Advantageously, at least one of the two liquid crystal layers is applied<br>
contiguously as a film coating and, if applicable, patterned in the form of a<br>
motif. Alternatively or additionally, at least one of the two liquid crystal<br>
layers is formed by imprinting liquid crystal pigments embedded in a binder<br>
matrix.<br>
According to an advantageous development, the security element includes at<br>
least one further security feature, especially a layer having magnetic,<br>
electrically conductive, phosphorescent, fluorescent or other luminescent<br>
feature substances, or a polarizing or phase-shifting layer. The further layer<br>
can be arranged over, under or between the two layers composed of liquid<br>
crystal material.<br><br>
To promote the alignment of the liquid crystal material, also an alignment<br>
layer can be provided between the two layers composed of liquid crystal<br>
material.<br>
It is also understood that the security elements according to the present<br>
invention are not limited to embodiments having two liquid crystal layers,<br>
but rather that also further liquid crystal layers can be provided to achieve<br>
additional effects or impacts.<br>
The present invention also comprises a method for manufacturing a security<br>
element, for security papers, value documents and the like, in which two<br>
layers composed of cholesteric liquid crystal material are stacked that each<br>
reflect, in a first viewing direction normal to their surface, selectively light<br>
from a first, longer-wave spectral range, and in a second viewing direction at<br>
an angle to the normal to their surface, selectively light from a second,<br>
shorter-wave spectral range, wherein, in the method,<br>
a first of the two layers is produced in the form of a motif to be<br>
depicted and is developed in such a way that it reflects light from the<br>
green spectral range in the first viewing direction, and<br>
the second of the two layers is developed in such a way that it reflects<br>
light from the green spectral range in the second viewing direction.<br>
The present invention further comprises a data carrier, especially a value<br>
document, such as a banknote, an identification card or the like, that is<br>
furnished with a security element of the kind described.<br><br>
At this point, it is to be noted that the concept according to the present<br>
invention can, in principle, also be realized in that, in a generic security<br>
element,<br>
a first of the two liquid crystal layers is present in the form of a motif<br>
to be depicted and reflects light from the green spectral range in the<br>
second viewing direction, and that<br>
the second of the two liquid crystal layers reflects light from the green<br>
spectral range in the first viewing direction.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment for this, the second layer is developed such<br>
that it reflects light from the blue or ultraviolet spectral range in the second<br>
viewing direction. The first layer reflects advantageously light from the red<br>
or infrared spectral range in the first viewing direction.<br>
As a result, in the above-described embodiment of the concept according to<br>
the present invention, the motif is not perceptible in top view (first viewing<br>
direction), since the second layer reflects light from the green spectral range<br>
in the first viewing direction, the first layer reflects light from the red or<br>
infrared spectral range in the first viewing direction, and the human eye is<br>
significantly more sensitive to green light. For the viewer, there thus appears<br>
in the first viewing direction a uniformly green surface without perceptible<br>
contrast differences, while when the security element is tilted out of the<br>
vertical in an oblique viewing direction, the green motif to be depicted<br>
appears against a contrasting blue background. Also in this embodiment, the<br>
effect according to the present invention is based on the coordination of the<br>
color-shift effects of the two liquid crystal layers with each other and with<br>
the spectral sensitivity of the human eye, which is explained in greater detail<br>
below.<br><br>
In practice, however, it has been shown that, in this alternative embodiment<br>
of the concept according to the present invention, the contrast differences do<br>
not show up quite as well for the viewer, which is why this alternative<br>
embodiment is presently not claimed.<br>
Moreover, it is to be noted that, for this presently not claimed embodiment of<br>
the security element, of course all features of the dependent claims can be<br>
combined analagously, as long as a feature combination is not logically<br>
precluded.<br>
The presently not claimed security element according to the described<br>
alternative embodiment can be manufactured through a generic method,<br>
provided that<br>
a first of the two layers is produced in the form of a motif to be<br>
depicted and is developed in such a way that it reflects light from the<br>
green spectral range in the second viewing direction, and<br>
the second of the two layers is developed in such a way that it reflects<br>
light from the green spectral range in the first viewing direction.<br>
Here, too, all features of the dependent method claims can be realized<br>
analogously, as long as the feature combination is not logically precluded.<br>
Further exemplary embodiments and advantages of the present invention<br>
are explained below by reference to the drawings, in which a depiction to<br>
scale and proportion was omitted in order to improve their clarity.<br>

to a further exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The invention will now be explained using a banknote as an example. For<br>
this, fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of a banknote 10 that is provided with<br><br>
an inventive security element 12 that exhibits a conspicuous visual tilt effect.<br>
When viewed from above, the security element 12 displays a high-contrast<br>
green motif against a red background that, when the security element is<br>
tilted out of the vertical, changes into a monochrome green surface without<br>
perceptible contrast differences.<br>
With reference to the cross section in fig. 2, the security element 12 exhibits<br>
an absorbing, especially black background 20 and, arranged on the black<br>
background 20, two layers 22, 24 composed of cholesteric liquid crystal<br>
material. Here, the first liquid crystal layer 22 is applied in the form of the<br>
desired motif, for example the crest motif shown in fig. 3(b). In the<br>
exemplary embodiment, the second liquid crystal layer 24 is arranged<br>
contiguously over the first liquid crystal layer 22. In other embodiments,<br>
however, also the second liquid crystal layer itself can be developed in the<br>
form of a motif, as long as it provides only a background for the motif of the<br>
first liquid crystal layer.<br>
In manufacturing the security element, the liquid crystal layers 22, 24 can<br>
first be applied contiguously as a film coating, at least the first liquid crystal<br>
layer 22 being patterned in the form of the motif to be depicted after<br>
application by known methods. Alternatively, the liquid crystal layers can<br>
also be produced by imprinting liquid crystal pigments embedded in a<br>
binder matrix. To promote the alignment of the cholesteric liquid crystal<br>
material, alignment layers can be provided between the background 20 and<br>
the first liquid crystal layer 22 and/or between the two liquid crystal layers<br>
22 and 24.<br>
At this point, let it be noted that the security element is not necessarily<br>
fabricated by applying the layers directly to a suitable data carrier. Rather, it<br>
is also possible to use a so-called transfer method, in which, for example, at<br><br>
least the two liquid crystal layers are applied to a suitable substrate, for<br>
example a foil, the layer then located on the outside is provided with an<br>
adhesive layer and, with the aid of the adhesive layer, the two layers are<br>
applied to an absorbing background to a data carrier. Thereafter, the foil is<br>
removed and the security element is arranged on a data carrier with the<br>
layer sequence shown in the figures. A number of suitable transfer methods<br>
with which a data carrier according to the present invention can be obtained<br>
are known to the person of skill in the art.<br>
Due to its crystal structure, the cholesteric liquid crystal layers 22, 24 each<br>
exhibit a defined color-shift effect, so each reflect, in a first viewing direction<br>
normal to their surface, selectively light from a first, longer-wave spectral<br>
range, and reflect in a second viewing direction, at an angle to the normal to<br>
their surface, selectively light from a second, shorter-wave spectral range.<br>
The effect according to the present invention is now based on the<br>
coordination of the color-shift effects of the two liquid crystal layers with<br>
each other and with the spectral sensitivity of the human eye. Here,<br>
advantage is taken of the fact that cholesteric liquid crystal layers reflect<br>
circularly polarized light in the corresponding relevant spectral range with a<br>
reflection factor of up to 50%. In the longer-wave range, the bands become<br>
wider and the extent of the reflection maximum decreases somewhat.<br>
Overall, however, the corresponding reflected light quantity in the optical<br>
range remains approximately the same.<br>
In contrast to this spectral uniformity, the human eye exhibits a pronounced<br>
maximum sensitivity in the green spectral range. According to the relative<br>
spectral sensitivity luminosity function V(\) of the eye of a standard<br>
observer, which was defined by the International Commission on<br>
Illumination (CIE), the light-adjusted eye exhibits a maximum sensitivity at a<br><br>
wavelength of 555 nm. At a wavelength of about 475 nm in the blue spectral<br>
range, or at a wavelength of about 650 nm in the red spectral range, the<br>
sensitivity of the eye in each case is already just 10% of the maximum<br>
sensitivity, and decreases further toward the edges of the visible spectral<br>
range. For the dark-adapted eye, the luminosity function V'(X) is shifted<br>
somewhat into the blue, and the maximum sensitivity there is 507 nm.<br>
To exploit this high green sensitivity of the eye to design a surprising visual<br>
tilt effect, according to the present invention, the second liquid crystal layer<br>
24 is developed in such a way that it exhibits a color-shift effect from red to<br>
green, so reflects, in the first viewing direction normal to its surface,<br>
selectively light 30 from the red spectral range (R in fig. 2), and in a second<br>
viewing direction at an angle to the normal to its surface, selectively light 32<br>
from the green spectral range (G).<br>
Here, according to the preceding embodiments, the green spectral range<br>
comprises all wavelengths that evoke in an average viewer a substantially<br>
green color impression, especially the wavelength range between 490 nm<br>
and 590 nm, and particularly preferably between 520 nm and 570 nm.<br>
Further, the first liquid crystal layer 22 that is applied as a motif is developed<br>
such that it exhibits a color-shift effect from green to blue, so reflects, in the<br>
first viewing direction normal to its surface, selectively light 34 from the<br>
green spectral range (G), and in a second viewing direction at an angle to the<br>
normal to its surface, selectively light 36 from the blue spectral range (B).<br>
When the security element 12 is viewed vertically from above, for the<br>
viewer, overall a high-contrast image impression results, as illustrated with<br>
reference to figures 2 and 3(a). In the background region 26, in which only<br>
the second liquid crystal layer 24 is present, the aggregate color impression<br><br>
40 is determined exclusively by the red light 30 reflected by the second liquid<br>
crystal layer 24 in the first viewing direction, such that the background 50 of<br>
the security element 12 appears red.<br>
In the motif region 28 in which the two liquid crystal layers 22 and 24<br>
overlap, the aggregate color impression 42 results from the superimposition<br>
of the red light 30 reflected by the second liquid crystal layer 24 and the<br>
green light 34 reflected by the first liquid crystal layer 22. Due to the<br>
significantly higher spectral sensitivity of the human eye for green light<br>
compared with red light, the green color impression of the first liquid crystal<br>
layer 22 dominates for the viewer, such that the interior of the crest motif 52<br>
appears in brightly shining green.<br>
When viewing the security element 12 vertically from above, the viewer thus<br>
perceives a clearly contrasting green crest motif 52 against a red background<br>
50, as depicted in fig. 3(b).<br>
If the viewer tilts the security element 12 in an oblique viewing direction,<br>
then the crest motif disappears and gives way to a substantially uniformly<br>
green surface without perceptible contrast differences, as illustrated with<br>
reference to figures 2 and 4(a).<br>
In the background region 26, in which only the second liquid crystal layer 24<br>
is present, the aggregate color impression 44 is again determined only by the<br>
green light 32 reflected by the second liquid crystal layer 24 in the viewing<br>
direction, so the background 54 of the security element 12 appears green<br>
when viewed obliquely.<br>
In the motif region 28 in which the two liquid crystal layers 22 and 24<br>
overlap, the aggregate color impression 46 results from the superimposition<br><br>
of the green light 32 reflected by the second liquid crystal layer 24 and the<br>
blue light 36 reflected by the first liquid crystal layer 22. Due to the<br>
significantly higher spectral sensitivity of the human eye for green light<br>
compared with blue light, the green color impression of the second liquid<br>
crystal layer 24 dominates for the viewer, such that the interior of the crest<br>
motif 56 likewise appears green.<br>
Thus, when the security element 12 is viewed obliquely from above, both the<br>
region of the crest motif 56 and the background region 54 appear green, such<br>
that the image motif disappears for the viewer for lack of contrast. The tilted<br>
security element 12 appears to the viewer as a uniformly green surface, as<br>
illustrated in fig. 4(b).<br>
The sequence of the two liquid crystal layers can also be reversed, as shown<br>
in fig. 5. In the security element 60, on an absorbing colored background 66 is<br>
first imprinted contiguously a layer 64, composed of cholesteric liquid<br>
crystal material that, like the second liquid crystal layer of the exemplary<br>
embodiment in figures 2 to 4, exhibits a color-shift effect from red to green.<br>
On this contiguous layer 64 is then imprinted a further layer 62 composed of<br>
cholesteric liquid crystal material in the form of the motif to be depicted. The<br>
further layer 62 exhibits, like the first liquid crystal layer of the exemplary<br>
embodiment in figures 2 to 4, a color-shift effect from green to blue. In the<br>
same way, as described above, also in this security element, the depicted<br>
motif stands out in high contrast in top view and disappears when the<br>
security element is tilted. In addition, the color impression in top view and<br>
when viewed obliquely can be influenced by the inherent color of the<br>
absorbing colored background 66.<br><br>
It is understood that the described liquid crystal layers can be combined with<br>
further layers that, for example, serve to protect the security element or one<br>
of its sublayers, to improve alignment or adhesion of the layers, or to further<br>
increase the counterfeit security.<br>
In fig. 6 is shown, by way of example, a security element 70 according to a<br>
further exemplary embodiment of the present invention, in which is applied,<br>
on a diffractive black background 72, a magnetic feature substance 74 in the<br>
form of a further motif, for example a machine-readable barcode. On this<br>
magnetic layer is then provided a layer sequence composed of two stacked<br>
liquid crystal layers 22, 24, as described for the exemplary embodiment in<br>
fig. 2. If appropriate, also alignment layers can be provided under the first<br>
and/or the second liquid crystal layer to facilitate or to improve the<br>
alignment of the liquid crystal material.<br>
As already mentioned, according to an alternative, presently not claimed<br>
variant of the present invention, the first liquid crystal layer (motif layer) can<br>
exhibit a color-shift effect from, for example, red (first viewing direction, top<br>
view) to green (second viewing direction) and the second liquid crystal layer<br>
a color-shift effect from green (first viewing direction) to, for example, blue<br>
(second viewing direction). In this variant, when the security element is<br>
viewed vertically from above, a substantially uniformly green area without<br>
perceptible contrast differences then results, while the viewer perceives,<br>
from an oblique viewing direction, the green motif against a blue<br>
background. In other words, the motif is perceptible for the viewer only<br>
when the security element is viewed at an oblique angle. With reference to<br>
this alternative, not presently claimed variant of the present invention, all<br>
details given in the description for the claimed variants apply analogously.<br>
This also applies to the illustration of the claimed variants in figures 1 to 6.<br><br>
