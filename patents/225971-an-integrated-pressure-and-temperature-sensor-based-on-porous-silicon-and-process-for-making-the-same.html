				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an integrated pressure and temperature sensor based on<br>
porous silicon and a process for making the same. More particularly, this invention pertains to<br>
the fabrication of a smart pressure and temperature sensor offering enhanced sensitivity and<br>
financial advantages, thereby ensuring their wide application in various process industries.<br>
Heretofore porous silicon has been used in mechanical sensors as a sacrificial layer since<br>
micro-machining technique offers benefits of surface micro-machining along with the<br>
capabilities of bulk micro-machining. Porous silicon has been used to create thick oxide layers<br>
which act as an insulation between two sensors fabricated on the substrate. In recent times it has<br>
also found use for fabrication of field emitter pressure sensor suitable for high pressure<br>
measurements. The main advantage of porous silicon for field emission application is that even<br>
flat porous silicon surfaces exhibit field emission properties. Thus porous silicon realized on<br>
silicon blunt emitters was found to induce a field emission multiplication.<br>
However, it has not hitherto been used as the active pressure and temperature sensing<br>
material in micro electro-mechanical systems (hereinafter referred to as 'MEMS' for the sake of<br>
brevity) pressure sensors.<br>
It has been observed that sensitivity of piezoresistive sensors fabricated by prior art<br>
procedures were lower by almost three times in comparison to the sensors of the subject<br>
invention. Sensitivity has been reported to increase considerably by designing a variable<br>
thickness diaphragm with a rim around it, commonly known as 'ribbed and bossed diaphragm'.<br>
In the low pressure range, diaphragm has to be made thin (say, of the order 2.5 ÔÅ≠m) to increase<br>
the sensitivity. Such reduction in thickness, however, increases non-linearity. To compensate for<br>
this non-linearity and also to increase the sensitivity, 'ribbed and bossed diaphragms' have been<br>
designed. But fabrication of such diaphragms is quite a complex procedure, and they find use in<br>
ultra low-pressure range, e.g of the order of 10'3 torr. On the other hand, if the sensitivity could<br>
be increased by some other means, then one could obviate reduction in thickness of the<br>
diaphragm to a very low level, even for measurement of low pressure. Consequently, fabrication<br>
of complex "ribbed and bossed" diaphragms would no longer be a necessity for low-pressure<br>
application, thereby making the sensor more cost-effective.<br><br>
The piezoresistive property of porous silicon has not been studied in extenso but for the<br>
observance of pressure induced phase transition therein, which indicates that porous silicon<br>
undergoes a change in band structure induced by pressure. The present invention is based on<br>
the response of porous silicon membrane towards pressure in view of the improvement in<br>
piezoresistive coefficient due to quantum confinement in the porous silicon structure. This<br>
concept is supported by the fact that porous silicon is a natural nanomaterial with silicon<br>
column confined between silicon dioxide and voids. It has also been observed that in<br>
nanocrystalline silicon the piezoresistive co-efficient increases to the tune of around 54.8% (T.<br>
Toriyama, S. Sugiyama, Sensors and Actuators, Vol. 108, 2003, pp. 244-249).<br>
The principal object of the present invention is to provide an integrated pressure and<br>
temperature sensor based on porous silicon which overcomes the disadvantages experienced<br>
hereinbefore in the industry.<br>
This invention has also for its object to provide a simple, low-cost pressure and<br>
temperature sensor based on porous silicon. According to this invention there is provided an<br>
integrated pressure and temperature sensor based on porous silicon comprising-<br>
(a)	p-type silicon as the principal component,<br>
(b)	silicon oxide layer serving as the protective mark on top of the silicon surface, and<br>
(c)	metal contacts for being attached/connected to the equipments for reading variations<br>
in parameters to be measured,<br>
characterised in that components (a), (b) and (c) are mounted on bulk silicon having<br>
porous silicon bodies with established metal contacts for observing variations in<br>
temperature and pressure.<br>
Usually for pressure sensors both the contracts are taken from the top surface on a different<br>
piezoresistor. In the present instance as porous silicon is highly resistive compared to that of<br>
bulk silicon, the current lines will effectively concentrate in the bulk silicon layer and the<br><br>
effect of porous silicon has the chance if being masked. Hence in such a configuration of metal<br>
contacts the bulk silicon parasites are likely to dominate. In order to study the response of porous<br>
silicon layer of different porosites and thickness on application of stress and to compare it with<br>
monocrystalline silicon, contacts have been taken from top surface of porous silicon layer and<br>
bottom surface of micromachined bulk silicon, whereby current lines are forced to pass through<br>
both porous silicon and silicon. Even though the bulk silicon layer acts as a parasitic component,<br>
still it is possible to get an estimate of the piezoresistive behaviour of porous silicon in this<br>
configuration of metal contacts.<br>
This invention also pertains to a process for making an integrated pressure and<br>
temperature sensor which comprises in combination the following steps :-<br>
(i) selecting a suitable p-type (100) silicon sample (1);<br>
(ii) oxidising the entire area by using a dry-wet-dry sequence to form an oxide layer<br>
(2) on top of the silicon surface (1);<br>
(iii) subjecting the sample from step (ii) to lithography by standard technique to<br>
expose a desired region for micromachining;<br>
(iv) micromachining the sample by using a wet etchant at room temperature to achieve<br>
desired thickness;<br>
(v) heating/filling the front region of the cell used in anodic etching with a mixture of<br>
HF and CH3OH, and immersing rear portion of said cell in KG solution thereby<br>
forming porous silicon;<br>
(vi) forming metal contacts (3) on top of porous silicon layer (4) by vacuum<br>
evaporation of aluminium and its subsequent heat treatment at around 500¬∞C for<br>
40-45 seconds and<br>
(vii) carrying out back contact metallisation either by nickel plating or by screen-<br>
printing with silver-aluminium paste followed by firing.<br>
The silicon wafer chosen as the starting material is a p-type nanocrystalline wafer (100)<br>
of resistivity of around 1-3 ohm-cm. After oxidation, the thickness of the oxide layer is around<br>
0.6 ÔÅ≠m. Lithography of the sample exposes areas of around 2mm x 2mm membrane.<br><br>
Micromachining is done in KOH solution to avoid development of microcracks in the<br>
diaphragm. Formation of porous silicon by anodic etching is conducted in a cell specially<br>
designed for the purpose, and the area of the porous silicon layer is around 2mm x 2mm. The<br>
wafers actually act as a seal between the front and rear regions of the cell. The metal contact area<br>
on porous silicon layer is optimally around 1mm x 1mm.<br>
It has been found that in the course of formation of porous silicon, if the current density<br>
exceeds the critical current density for pore formation, electropolishing sets in instead of<br>
electrochemical etching. However, the critical current density depends on the surface<br>
morphology, temperature of formation and the concentration of HF. It has been observed that the<br>
critical current density for 48% and 24% HF concentrations are around 1450 and 513 mA/cm2 for<br> oriented silicon wafer. The anodisation current density was varied from 10 to 50 mA/cm2<br>
and HF concentration in methanol was varied from 24% to 48%. The range of porosites and<br>
thickness of the porous silicon sample have been obtained as 48%-70%, and 5ÔÅ≠m to 20ÔÅ≠m<br>
respectively. Thus in the course of formation of porous silicon layer, the chance of<br>
electropolishing of the surface is negligible.<br>
Furthermore, the thickness of the layer of porous silicon has been restricted to 20ÔÅ≠m on a<br>
p-type wafer since it was found that with increasing thickness, porosity increases and fabrication<br>
of ohmic and stable metal contacts becomes difficult. Freestanding porous silicon layer was not<br>
fabricated purposely, since it would have been extremely difficult to handle such fragile<br>
structure. On the contrary, bulk silicon gives mechanical support to the structure.<br>
The foregoing process leads to a twin MEMS porous silicon/silicon heterojunction<br>
structure with an isolation layer in between to be used as an integrated pressure and temperature<br>
sensor. It is observed that the piezoresistive coefficient of the porous silicon/silicon MEMS<br>
structure improves by about 50% with 63% porosity and 20ÔÅ≠m thick porous silicon layer leading<br>
to almost three times increase in sensitivity of pressure sensor. The same structure also displays<br>
an enhanced temperature sensitivity (about 10 times) compared to that of conventional sensors.<br><br>
The sensors developed in accordance with this invention is also helpful for high pressure<br>
range where the thickness of the diaphragm has to be made considerably thick to withstand the<br>
fracture stress, often by sacrificing sensitivity. Optimization of the doping concentration of the<br>
piezoresistors to increase the sensitivity and the signal to noise ratio as mentioned herein<br>
effectively overcomes the difficulty of low sensitivity of high range pressure sensors. Thus the<br>
subject design produces a cost effective sensor where the thickness of the membrane needs to be<br>
reduced to achieve high sensitivity since the sensitivity is increased by an optimisation process<br>
requiring simple fabrication steps.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated with the help of drawings accompanying the<br>
provisional specification, wherein -<br>
Fig. 1 shows graphically the improvement in piezoresistive coefficient and consequent<br>
increase in sensitivity in nanostructured porous silicon pressure sensors over<br>
commercially available pressure sensors;<br>
Fig. 2 shows graphically the increased temperature sensitivity of the porous silicon-<br>
silicon heterojunction compared to that of a commercial piezoresistor, and<br>
Fig. 3 gives a schematic view of an integrated pressure and temperature sensor of this<br>
invention.<br>
In Fig. 1 there is depicted variation of fractional change in resistance of porous silicon<br>
layer of thickness 20uxn and different porosities. The diaphragm thickness is 100ÔÅ≠m. Fig. 2 of<br>
the drawings depicts variation of fractional change in current with temperature for (a) reverse<br>
biased porous silicon-silicon heterojunction and (b) commercial silicon piezoresistor.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3 of the drawings, (1) is the porous silicon for isolation, (2) is the oxide<br>
layer, (3) represents metal contacts, (4) shows bulk silicon and (5) stands for porous silicon for<br>
sensing temperature and pressure variation.<br>
The integrated pressure and temperature sensor of this invention offers a number of<br>
distinct advantages which are, inter alia, as follows :<br><br>
i)	enhanced sensitivity compared to that of a commercially available silicon sensor;<br>
ii)	reduction in the number of fabrication steps with consequent cost saving;<br>
iii)	precise monitoring of the temperature (due mainly to similar thermal mass of the<br>
pressure and the temperature sensor),<br>
iv)	precise temperature compensation, if and when necessary.<br>
v)	the sensors developed have simple structure and<br>
vi)	the sensors are applicable for all pressure ranges.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail with specific embodiments thereof, and<br>
illustrated by means of the drawings accompanying the provisional specification, it will be<br>
apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein<br>
without deviating or departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus the foregoing<br>
disclosure include within its ambit the obvious equivalents and substitutes as well.<br>
