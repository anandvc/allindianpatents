CATHODE FOR HYDROGEN GENERATION AND METHOD FOR<br>
PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a cathode for<br>
hydrogen generation used for electrolysis of water or an<br>
aqueous solution of an alkali metal compound, in<br>
particular, a cathode for hydrogen generation suitably<br>
used for electrolysis of salt by an ion-exchange membrane<br>
process.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
A cathode for hydrogen generation has been used in<br>
electrolysis in which water or an aqueous solution of an<br>
alkali metal compound (typically an alkali metal<br>
chloride) is electrolyzed to produce hydrogen, chlorine,<br>
caustic soda, and the like. The major problem in<br>
electrolysis is reduction of energy consumption, more<br>
specifically, reduction in electrolytic voltage. In<br>
recent years, as an electrolytic process for an aqueous<br>
solution of an alkali metal chloride such as salt water,<br>
an ion-exchange membrane process is common, and various<br>
studies have been carried out now. When electrolysis is<br>
carried out, as an electrolytic voltage, in addition to a<br>
voltage theoretically required for electrolysis of salt,<br>
an overvoltage due to anodic reaction (generation of<br>
chlorine), an overvoltage due to cathodic reaction<br>
(generation of hydrogen), a voltage by resistance of an<br>
ion-exchange membrane, and a voltage depending on an<br>
interelectrode distance between anode and cathode, are<br>
required. Among these voltages, regarding an overvoltage<br>
due to electrode reactions, as an anode for chlorine<br>
generation, a noble-metal-based electrode, so-called DSA<br>
(Dimensionally Stable Anode), has been developed, in<br>
which chlorine overvoltage has been greatly reduced even<br>
to 50 mV or lower. On the other hand, regarding a<br>
cathode associated with hydrogen generation, in recent<br>
years, a durable cathode having low hydrogen overvoltage<br>
has been demanded from the viewpoint of energy saving.<br>
In addition, it is known that when operation of an<br>
electrolyzer is stopped, the cathode is exposed to an<br>
oxidative atmosphere by the reverse current, and<br>
resistance to the oxidative deterioration due to this<br>
reverse current has been also demanded. In order to<br>
prevent the oxidative deterioration of the cathode, a<br>
step of passing weak protection current before stopping<br>
the operation of electrolyzer is employed. However, this<br>
method of stopping the operation of electrolyzer needs to<br>
be improved due to complicated operational procedures and<br>
cost increase in ancillary facilities, and the like.<br>
Therefore, a cathode, which can be stopped without<br>
passing protection current in stopping the operation of<br>
electrolyzer, has been demanded.<br>
[0003]<br>
As a cathode for hydrogen generation, soft steel,<br>
stainless steel and nickel has been used, and activation<br>
of the surface of these metals to reduce hydrogen<br>
overvoltage has been studied, and many patent<br>
applications filed. A typical catalyst layer of a<br>
hydrogen generation cathode includes nickel, nickel<br>
oxide, nickel-tin alloy, a combination of activated<br>
charcoal and oxides, ruthenium oxide, platinum, and the<br>
like. In addition, a method for producing a cathode for<br>
hydrogen generation may include alloy plating,<br>
dispersion/composite plating, thermal decomposition,<br>
thermal spraying, and combinations thereof, and the like.<br>
[0004]<br>
A cathode for hydrogen generation, in which a nickel<br>
oxide layer has been formed on a nickel base material by<br>
plasma spraying fine particles of granulated nickel<br>
oxide, has been developed and used (Non-Patent Document<br>
1). This cathode has a feature that is very resistant to<br>
the oxidative deterioration due to electric current<br>
because the catalyst itself is an oxide, and does not<br>
require a protection current when operation of the<br>
electrolyzer is stopped.<br>
[0005]<br>
As described in Non-Patent Document 2, dispersion<br>
plating in which Raney nickel and a hydrogen storing<br>
alloy are combined has been used. Raney nickel can<br>
realize a low hydrogen overvoltage because it has a very<br>
large effective area. Though Raney nickel has an<br>
oxidation-labile property, preventing oxidation caused by<br>
the reverse current generated when operation of the<br>
electrolyzer is stopped by introducing the hydrogen<br>
storing alloy has been carried out.<br>
[0006]<br>
As a cathode using a noble metal, a cathode composed<br>
of ruthenium oxide has been proposed, which has a very<br>
low hydrogen overvoltage as a cathode for hydrogen<br>
generation in an aqueous solution of an alkali metal.<br>
However, it is known that ruthenium oxide is subjected to<br>
an oxidative degradation by reverse current, and<br>
therefore, it is necessary that the protection current is<br>
passed when operation of the electrolyzer is stopped.<br>
[0007]<br>
Patent Document 1 describes that durability of an<br>
electrode can be improved by forming an electrode<br>
catalyst layer including mainly ruthenium on a metal base<br>
material, and further forming a porous protective layer<br>
having low activity on the surface thereof.<br>
[0008]<br>
Forming an electrode catalyst layer having a coating<br>
composed of ruthenium oxide, nickel and a rare earth<br>
metal having hydrogen storing ability, which was formed<br>
by thermal decomposition method, has been also proposed.<br>
By introducing the hydrogen storing alloy, preventing<br>
oxidation caused by the reverse current generated when<br>
operation of the electrolysis is stopped (Patent Document<br>
2).<br>
[0009]<br>
Since platinum is an electrochemically stable<br>
material having a low hydrogen overvoltage, a cathode<br>
having a low hydrogen overvoltage by supporting platinum<br>
in the catalyst layer has been proposed. However, a<br>
cathode for hydrogen generation using only platinum has a<br>
problem in durability because platinum physically drops<br>
off during electrolysis. Further, it is also a serious<br>
problem that the cathode is easily poisoned by Fe ion<br>
included in the electrolytic solution leading to a rise<br>
in electrolytic voltage.<br>
[0010]<br>
In Patent Document 3, a cathode for hydrogen<br>
generation composed of platinum and cerium oxide has been<br>
proposed. In Patent Document 4, a cathode for hydrogen<br>
generation composed of platinum-nickel alloy has been<br>
proposed. Both of these cathodes exhibit superior<br>
performances as a cathode for hydrogen generation in an<br>
aqueous solution of alkali metal, but further studies are<br>
being carried out in order to improve on the cost.<br>
[0011]<br>
In Patent Document 5, a cathode for hydrogen<br>
generation composed of platinum and iridium oxide has<br>
been proposed. However, because of a low degree in<br>
crystallinity of iridium oxide and insufficient<br>
durability against reverse current, this cathode for<br>
hydrogen generation has not been industrialized.<br>
[0012]<br>
As mentioned above, many approaches have been<br>
studied, and various cathodes for hydrogen generation<br>
have been proposed for the purpose of reducing power<br>
consumption. However, a cathode for hydrogen generation<br>
having a low hydrogen overvoltage and sufficient<br>
durability against the reverse current and Fe impurities<br>
in the electrolytic solution, and further resistance<br>
against the reverse current when electrolysis is stopped,<br>
has not yet been realized.<br>

SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0015]<br>
The problem of the present invention is to provide<br>
an excellent durable cathode for hydrogen generation,<br>
which has low hydrogen overvoltage and reduced drop-off<br>
of a catalyst layer against the reverse current generated<br>
when operation of the electrolyzer is stopped, and a<br>
method for producing the same.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>
[0016]<br>
The present inventors have intensively studied the<br>
above-described problem, and as a result, have found that<br>
iridium oxide is an electrochemically stable material<br>
which does not show dissolution nor any structural change<br>
in the voltage range from the hydrogen generation voltage<br>
to the oxygen generation voltage. In addition, the<br>
present inventors have also found that the physical<br>
dropping-off by electrolysis can be inhibited by using<br>
iridium oxide as a framework and supporting platinum<br>
thereon in comparison with the cathode for hydrogen<br>
generation using platinum alone, and further that the<br>
physical dropping-off can be further prevented by<br>
improving degree of crystallinity of iridium oxide as a<br>
framework. Further, the inventors have found that bond<br>
between iridium oxide particles as a framework can be<br>
strengthened by forming an alloy of iridium and platinum.<br>
Furthermore, the inventors have further found that a<br>
cathode for hydrogen generation formed by using the<br>
above-described materials has low hydrogen overvoltage,<br>
resistance against reverse current generated when<br>
operation of the electrolyzer is stopped and Fe ion<br>

MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0030]<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained<br>
in detail. The present invention provides a cathode for<br>
hydrogen generation having a conductive base material and<br>
a catalyst layer formed on the conductive base material,<br>
wherein the catalyst layer includes crystalline iridium<br>
oxide, platinum and iridium-platinum alloy.<br>
[0031]<br>
The catalyst layer included in the cathode for<br>
hydrogen generation of the present invention includes<br>
crystalline iridium oxide, platinum and iridium-platinum<br>
alloy. In the present invention, the catalyst layer<br>
means a layer which is formed on the conductive base<br>
material and has a function to reduce hydrogen<br>
overvoltage.<br>
[0032]<br>
To the cathode for hydrogen generation of the<br>
present invention, electric current is applied when the<br>
cathode is used for electrolysis of an alkali metal<br>
compound. When crystalline iridium oxide and platinum<br>
are present at electric current application, at least a<br>
part of these substances is alloyed by the electric<br>
current application. The iridium-platinum alloy, which<br>
is formed by alloying of crystalline iridium oxide and<br>
platinum, may be present in the catalyst layer at<br>
electric current application when the cathode for<br>
hydrogen generation is used (including the case when<br>
alloying is initiated by electric current application<br>
when the cathode is used). Therefore, the above-<br>
described iridium-platinum alloy may be formed in advance<br>
by electrolysis or the like of the catalyst layer when<br>
the cathode for hydrogen generation is produced, or may<br>
be formed at electrolysis of an alkali metal compound in<br>
use after production of the cathode for hydrogen<br>
generation, or may be both of them.<br>
[0033]<br>
In the catalyst layer of the cathode for hydrogen<br>
generation of the present invention, main catalyst<br>
components to reduce overvoltage are platinum and<br>
iridium-platinum alloy. The catalyst layer has a<br>
structure in which the framework is made of crystalline<br>
iridium oxide supporting platinum or forming iridium-<br>
platinum alloy thereon. Therefore, according to the<br>
present invention, even a catalyst having a large surface<br>
area and small amount of platinum, a low hydrogen<br>
overvoltage can be obtained. It should be noted that,<br>
presence of iridium-platinum alloy can be confirmed by a<br>
shift of the angle of diffraction peak of metal platinum<br>
toward a higher angle side in the X-ray diffraction<br>
measurement.<br>
[0034]<br>
Crystalline iridium oxide in the present invention<br>
means iridium oxide which gives a diffraction peak<br>
(diffraction line) having the full width at half maximum<br>
of 0.47° or less in an angular region including 20=34.70°,<br>
in the X-ray diffraction measurement using Cu-Ka line as<br>
a X-ray source. The full width at half maximum means, as<br>
well known to the person skilled in the art of the X-ray<br>
diffraction measurement technology, is a width between<br>
the angles at which diffraction intensities show a half<br>
value of the peak top in a X-ray diffraction peak. As<br>
the degree of crystallinity becomes higher, the X-ray<br>
diffraction peak becomes sharper and full width at half<br>
maximum becomes smaller. Contrary, as the degree of<br>
crystallinity becomes lower, full width at half maximum<br>
becomes larger.<br>
[0035]<br>
Platinum in the catalyst layer is preferably<br>
amorphous platinum. Electrolysis with the combination of<br>
crystalline iridium oxide and amorphous platinum<br>
successfully forms iridium-platinum alloy. It should be<br>
noted that, amorphous platinum means platinum which does<br>
not show any clear platinum peak in the X-ray<br>
diffraction.<br>
[0036]<br>
In the catalyst layer of the cathode for hydrogen<br>
generation of the present invention, since the framework<br>
is made of iridium oxide, weight reduction of the<br>
catalyst layer by electrolysis becomes less and<br>
resistance against the reverse current becomes higher as<br>
degree.of crystallinity of iridium oxide is higher. In<br>
crystalline iridium oxide, it is preferable that full<br>
width at half maximum in the X-ray diffraction peak of<br>
iridium oxide at 20=34.70° is 0.47° or less, because<br>
weight reduction of the catalyst layer by electrolysis is<br>
inhibited and resistance against the reverse current<br>
becomes high. In addition, when the full width at half<br>
maximum is 0.47° or less, surface area of iridium oxide<br>
becomes greater due to high degree of crystallinity of<br>
iridium oxide, leading to improved utilization efficiency<br>
of platinum. The lower limit of the above-described full<br>
width at half maximum is not particularly limited, but<br>
the above-described full width at half maximum is<br>
preferably 0.10° or more because iridium-platinum alloy is<br>
easily formed due to superior dispersing properties of<br>
iridium oxide and platinum.<br>
[0037]<br>
It should be noted that, the X-ray diffraction peak<br>
in the present description can be measured more<br>
specifically using the X-ray diffractometer (for example,<br>
Ultra X18, manufactured by Rigaku Corp.) by Cu-Koc line<br>
(?=1.54184 A) under the following conditions:<br>
acceleration voltage: 50 kV, acceleration current: 200<br>
mA, scanning axis: 20/8, step interval: 0.02°, scanning<br>
speed: 2.0° / minute, and measurement range: 20=20 to 60°.<br>
In addtion, the full width at half maximum can be<br>
calculated using the analysis software accompanying to<br>
the X-ray diffractometer.<br>
[0038]<br>
The ratio (Pt/(Ir+Pt)) of mole number of platinum<br>
element to total mole number of iridium element and the<br>
platinum element present in the catalyst layer is<br>
preferably 20 to 50% by atom. When the above-described<br>
ratio is 20% by atom or more, a much amount of iridium-<br>
platinum alloy is formed by electrolysis, and hence<br>
weight reduction of the catalyst layer by electrolysis<br>
can be more efficiently inhibited. In addition, when the<br>
above-described ratio is 50% by atom or less, an amount<br>
of crystalline iridium oxide as a framework can be<br>
sufficiently secured, and weight reduction of the<br>
catalyst layer by electrolysis can be more efficiently<br>
inhibited. The above-described ratio (Pt/(Ir+Pt)) is<br>
more preferably 20 to 45% by atom.<br>
[0039]<br>
The thickness of the catalyst layer is preferably<br>
0.5 to 5 µm, and more preferably 1 to 3 µm. As the<br>
thickness of the catalyst layer becomes thicker, a period<br>
during which overvoltage can be maintained at a low level<br>
becomes longer, but the above-described range is<br>
preferable from the viewpoint of the cost.<br>
[0040]<br>
As the conductive base material, for example,<br>
nickel, nickel alloy, stainless steel, and the like can<br>
be used. However, since Fe and Cr dissolve out when<br>
stainless steel is used in an agueous alkali solution<br>
having high concentration, and that electric conductivity<br>
of stainless steel is around 1/10 of that of nickel,<br>
nickel is preferable as the conductive base material.<br>
[0041]<br>
The shape of the conductive base material is not<br>
particularly limited, and an appropriate shape can be<br>
selected depending on the purpose, i.e., a porous plate,<br>
an expanded shape, and so-called a woven mesh which is<br>
made by weaving nickel wire, and the like are preferably<br>
used. As for the shape of the conductive base material,<br>
it is determined based on the distance between anode and<br>
cathode in the electrolyzer. If an anode and a cathode<br>
have a finite distance, a porous plate or an expanded<br>
form is used, and if a zero-gap electrolyzer in which an<br>
ion-exchange membrane and an electrode are in contact, a<br>
woven mesh of knitted thin wire and the like can be used.<br>
[0042]<br>
In the present invention, residual stress at the<br>
processing is preferably relaxed by annealing the<br>
conductive base material in an oxidative atmosphere. In<br>
addition, as for the surface of the conductive base<br>
material, in order to improve adhesion to the catalyst<br>
layer to be coated on the surface, preferably surface<br>
area is increased by forming irregularity using steel<br>
grid, alumina powder, or the like, thereafter subjecting<br>
to an acid treatment.<br>
[0043]<br><method for producing the cathode hydrogen></method>
generation&gt;<br>
The cathode for hydrogen generation of the present<br>
invention can be produced by any method in which a<br>
combination of crystalline iridium oxide and platinum,<br>
and/or iridium-platinum alloy which can be formed by<br>
alloying thereof can be formed on the conductive base<br>
material as the catalyst layer. Specifically, known<br>
various processes such as thermal decomposition process,<br>
electrolytic plating process, electroless plating<br>
process, dispersed plating process, vapor deposition<br>
process, plasma spraying process, and the like can be<br>
applied. Among them, thermal decomposition process is<br>
preferable form the viewpoint of industrial productivity<br>
and the like. Hereinafter, the preferable aspects, of<br>
producing the cathode for hydrogen generation of the<br>
present invention by the thermal decomposition process,<br>
will be explained.<br>
[0044]<br>
The present invention also provides a method for<br>
producing the above-described cathode for hydrogen<br>
generation of the present invention, comprising:<br>
a coating step to apply an application liquid<br>
including an iridium compound, a platinum compound, an<br>
organic acid having a valence of two or more, and an<br>
organic compound having two or more hydroxyl groups<br>
subjected to an esterification reaction with the organic<br>
acid, onto the conductive base material;<br>
a film-forming step to form a coated film by drying<br>
the application liquid; and<br>
a thermal decomposition step to heat the coated film<br>
to decompose thermally.<br>
[0045]<br>
In addition, the present invention also provides a<br>
method for producing the above-described cathode for<br>
hydrogen generation of the present invention, comprising:<br>
a coating step to apply an application liquid<br>
including an iridium compound and a platinum compound,<br>
onto the conductive base material;<br>
a film-forming step to form a coated film by drying<br>
the application liquid;<br>
a thermal decomposition step to heat the coated film<br>
to decompose thermally; and<br>
an electrolysis step to electrolyze the coated film<br>
after the thermal decomposition.<br>
[0046]<br>
The application liquid to be used in the method for<br>
producing the cathode for hydrogen generation of the<br>
present invention is typically a mixture of an iridium<br>
compound solution and a platinum compound solution. The<br>
iridium compound solution can be exemplified by a<br>
solution of chloride, ammine complex, nitrate, hydroxide<br>
salt, or the like of iridium. The platinum compound<br>
solution can be exemplified by a solution of chloride,<br>
ammine complex, nitrate, hydroxide salt, or the like of<br>
platinum. Each of the iridium compound and the platinum<br>
compound may be a combination of two or more compounds.<br>
The iridium compound solution is preferably an iridium<br>
chloride solution from the viewpoint that iridium<br>
concentration in the application liquid can be<br>
heightened, and the platinum compound solution is<br>
preferably a dinitrodiammineplatinum solution. In<br>
addition, the solvent solution may be water, an organic<br>
solvent, such as alcohol, or a mixture thereof.<br>
[0047]<br>
In the above-described application liquid, a ratio<br>
(Pt/(Ir+Pt)) of mole number of platinum element to total<br>
mole number of iridium element and said platinum element<br>
is preferably 20 to 50% by atom. When the above-<br>
described ratio is 20% by atom or more, a large amount of<br>
iridium-platinum alloy is formed by electrolysis, and<br>
hence weight reduction of the catalyst layer by<br>
electrolysis can be more efficiently inhibited. In<br>
addition, when the above-described ratio is 50% by atom<br>
or less, an amount of crystalline iridium oxide as a<br>
framework can be sufficiently secured, and weight<br>
reduction of the catalyst layer by electrolysis can be<br>
more efficiently inhibited. The above-described ratio<br>
(Pt/(Ir+Pt)) is more preferably 20 to 45% by atom.<br>
[0048]<br>
The total concentration of iridium element and<br>
platinum element present in the application liquid is not<br>
particularly limited, but preferably in a range of 10 to<br>
200 g/L, more preferably 50 to 120 g/L, in view of a<br>
coating thickness per one coating of the application<br>
liquid.<br>
[0049]<br>
Crystalline iridium oxide and platinum, or iridium-<br>
platinum alloy which is formed by alloying these<br>
substances in the catalyst layer can be obtained using<br>
the application liquid as mentioned above according to<br>
the following method (A) or method (B).<br>
[0050]<br>
Method (A)<br>
An application liquid including an iridium compound<br>
and a platinum compound is prepared, and the application<br>
liquid is coated on a conductive base material composed<br>
of, for example, nickel, nickel alloy, or the like.<br>
After a coated film is formed by drying, said coated film<br>
is thermally decomposed. This coated film after the<br>
thermal decomposition is made up crystalline iridium<br>
oxide and platinum (preferably amorphous platinum). By<br>
electrolyzing this coated film after thermal<br>
decomposition, the iridium-platinum alloy is formed, and<br>
therefore, the cathode for hydrogen generation, on which<br>
a catalyst layer including at least either of a<br>
combination of crystalline iridium oxide and platinum or<br>
iridium-platinum alloy has been formed, can be produced.<br>
The above-described electrolysis may be carried out upon<br>
producing the cathode for hydrogen generation or upon<br>
using the cathode for hydrogen generation, i.e., during<br>
the electrolysis for hydrogen generation.<br>
[0051]<br>
Method (B)<br>
The application liquid is prepared by adding an<br>
organic acid having a valence of two or more and an<br>
organic compound having two or more functional groups<br>
(specifically hydroxyl group) subjected to an<br>
esterification reaction with the organic acid, and this<br>
application liquid is applied onto a conductive base<br>
material composed of, for example, nickel, nickel alloy,<br>
or the like. After a coated film is formed by drying,<br>
the coated film is thermally decomposed. By these<br>
procedures, the cathode for hydrogen generation, on which<br>
a catalyst layer including at least either of a<br>
combination of crystalline iridium oxide and platinum or<br>
iridium - platinum alloy has been formed, can be<br>
produced.<br>
[0052]<br>
However, when an organic acid having a valence of<br>
two or more or an organic compound having two or more<br>
hydroxyl groups subjected to an esterification reaction<br>
with said organic acid is used alone, since an amount of<br>
the electrode coating (e.g. catalyst layer) is<br>
significantly reduced by the reverse current, the effect<br>
of the present invention tends to be decreased.<br>
Therefore, it is preferable to use an organic acid having<br>
a valence of two or more and an organic compound having<br>
two or more hydroxyl groups subjected to an<br>
esterification reaction with the organic acid, in<br>
combination.<br>
[0053]<br>
The organic acid having a valence of two or more,<br>
which can be used in the present invention, typically has<br>
a functional group which stabilizes a metal cation by<br>
forming a chelate complex with the metal cation. The<br>
functional group forming a chelate complex with a metal<br>
cation includes, for example, hydroxyl group, carboxyl<br>
group and amino group. On the other hand, the organic<br>
compound, which can be used in the present invention,<br>
having two or more hydroxyl groups subjected to an<br>
esterification reaction with the organic acid induces an<br>
esterification reaction with a functional group having<br>
acidic property in the organic acid, for example, a<br>
carboxyl group. In such way, an organic compound having<br>
two or more hydroxyl groups subjected to an<br>
esterification reaction with organic acid having a<br>
valence of two or more and an organic acid having a<br>
valence of two or more induce esterification reactions<br>
successively to form a polymer. It is considered that an<br>
iridium compound and a platinum compound which can be<br>
used in the present invention are chelate-coordinated,<br>
dispersed and stabilized in this polymer. By thermally<br>
decomposing the polymer including these highly dispersed<br>
and stabilized iridium compound and platinum compound,<br>
production of the electrode catalyst layer having stable<br>
crystalline structure including at least either of a<br>
combination of crystalline iridium oxide and platinum or<br>
iridium-platinum alloy can be realized. In this method,<br>
the iridium-platinum alloy is formed in the thermal<br>
decomposition step.<br>
[0054]<br>
In addition, when the application liquid including<br>
an organic acid having a valence of two or more and an<br>
organic compound having two or more hydroxyl groups<br>
subjected to an esterification reaction with said organic<br>
acid is used, types of the organic acid and the organic<br>
compound are not particularly limited, and any organic<br>
acid or organic compound having two or more hydroxyl<br>
groups subjected to an esterification reaction with the<br>
organic acid can be used.<br>
[0055]<br>
More specifically, the organic acid having a valence<br>
of two or more can be exemplified by, for example, citric<br>
acid, isocitric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid,<br>
ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid, glycerol, and the<br>
like.<br>
[0056]<br>
The hydroxyl group in the organic compound having<br>
two or more hydroxyl groups subjected to an<br>
esterification reaction with the organic acid having a<br>
valence of two or more may be any one of alcoholic<br>
hydroxyl group or phenolic hydroxyl group. More<br>
specifically, for example, alcohol having a valence of<br>
two or more, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol,<br>
propylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-butanediol, 1,3-<br>
butanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 2,3-butanediol, catechol,<br>
resorcinol, hydroquinone, and the like, can be<br>
exemplified.<br>
[0057]<br>
In order to sufficiently exert the effect of the<br>
present invention, the content of the organic acid having<br>
a valence of two or more in the application liquid is<br>
preferably in a range of 0.01 to 1.0 in molar ratio when<br>
total mole number of iridium and platinum is assumed to<br>
be 1. When the molar ratio is 0.01 or more, the effect<br>
of the present invention is superior, and when the molar<br>
ratio is 1.0 or less, decrease in physical strength due<br>
to many voids generated in the catalyst layer can be<br>
inhibited. The above-described molar ratio is more<br>
preferably in a range of 0.05 to 0.9, and further more<br>
preferably in a range of 0.1 to 0.8.<br>
[0058]<br>
Content of the organic compound having two or more<br>
hydroxyl groups subjected to an esterification reaction<br>
with the organic acid having a valence of two or more in<br>
the application liquid is preferably in a range of 0.01<br>
to 2.0 in molar ratio when total mole number of iridium<br>
element and platinum element is assumed to be 1. When<br>
the molar ratio is 0.01 or more, the effect of the<br>
present invention is superior, and when the molar ratio<br>
is 2.0 or less, decrease in physical strength due to many<br>
voids generated in the catalyst layer can be inhibited.<br>
The above-described molar ratio is more preferably in a<br>
range of 0.05 to 1.5, and further more preferably in a<br>
range of 0.1 to 1.0.<br>
[0059]<br>
By either of the above-described method (A) and<br>
method (B), the dropping-off of catalyst by electrolysis<br>
can be inhibited and high durability can be obtained,<br>
because bond between crystalline iridium oxide particles<br>
as a framework is strengthened by the formation of<br>
iridium-platinum alloy. In addition, by the formation of<br>
said alloy, the oxidative deterioration of the catalyst<br>
layer by the reverse current generated when operation of<br>
the electrolyzer is stopped can be avoided, and a cathode<br>
for hydrogen generation which has less dropping-off of<br>
catalyst and a high resistance against the reverse<br>
current can be obtained.<br>
[0060]<br>
Next, each step of the method for producing the<br>
cathode for hydrogen generation of the present invention<br>
will be further explained.<br>
[0061]<br>
[Coating step]<br>
In the coating step, the application liquid<br>
including an iridium compound and a platinum compound is<br>
applied onto the conductive base material. In one<br>
aspect, the application liquid includes an organic acid<br>
having a valence of two or more and an organic compound<br>
having two or more hydroxyl groups subjected to an<br>
esterification reaction with said organic acid. As a<br>
method for applying the application liquid onto the<br>
conductive base material, known various techniques can be<br>
employed. A dipping method in which the conductive base<br>
material is dipped into the application liquid, a method<br>
in which the application liquid is applied onto the<br>
conductive base material with a brush, a roll method in<br>
which the application liquid impregnated in a sponge roll<br>
is applied onto the conductive base material, an<br>
electrostatic coating method in which the application<br>
liquid and the conductive base material are charged<br>
oppositely to each other and the application liquid is<br>
atomized using spraying or the like, and the like are<br>
suitable. In particular, the roll method and the<br>
electrostatic coating method are suitably used from the<br>
viewpoints of productivity and capability for uniform<br>
coating of the catalyst layer.<br>
[0062]<br>
[Film-forming step]<br>
In the film-forming step, a coated film is formed by<br>
drying the above-described application liquid. Drying is<br>
preferably carried out at a temperature of 200°C or lower.<br>
When drying temperature exceeds 200°C, the resultant<br>
catalyst layer becomes porous because a solvent of the<br>
coated application liquid rapidly vaporizes, and the<br>
dropping-off during electrolysis tends to become<br>
significant. Drying time is not particularly limited,<br>
but preferably 5 to 30 minutes.<br>
[0063]<br>
[Thermal decomposition step]<br>
In the thermal decomposition step, the above-<br>
described coated film is heated and subjected to thermal<br>
decomposition (i.e. calcination). The thermal<br>
decomposition can be carried out using an electric<br>
furnace, for example, in an air atmosphere. Heating<br>
temperature is preferably 470°C or higher and 600°C or<br>
lower, more preferably 480°C or higher and 600°C or lower.<br>
For example, since the thermal decomposition temperature<br>
of iridium chloride of an example of the iridium compound<br>
which can be used in the present invention is around<br>
450°C, at a temperature of 450°C or lower, thermal<br>
decomposition does not proceed well, and the desired<br>
iridium oxide does not readily hardly form. Therefore,<br>
the heating temperature is preferably 470°C or higher. On<br>
the other hand, at a temperature over 600°C, for example,<br>
when a conductive base material composed of nickel or<br>
nickel alloy is used, the conductive base material tends<br>
to easily soften. Heating time may be any time so long<br>
as it is within the time in which thermal decomposition<br>
of the coated film is completed, and is preferably around<br>
1 to 60 minutes, and more preferably 5 to 30 minutes.<br>
[0064]<br>
In the present invention, it is preferable to repeat<br>
the cycle composed of the above-described coating step,<br>
film-forming step and thermal decomposition step two or<br>
more times. In this case, a more uniform catalyst layer<br>
can be formed in a desired thickness. In order to form<br>
the catalyst layer having a desired thickness, an amount<br>
of the application liquid per one application may be<br>
increased or concentrations of the iridium compound and<br>
the platinum compound may be heightened, but when an<br>
excession amount of coating per one application is<br>
employed, the catalyst layer sometimes cannot be formed<br>
uniformly due to possible unevenness. Therefore, it is<br>
preferable to repeat the application, drying and thermal<br>
decomposition two or more times. The number of repeating<br>
is preferably 3 to 20 times, and more preferably 5 to 15<br>
times.<br>
[0065]<br>
In the thermal decomposition step, after the above-<br>
described procedures up to the thermal decomposition are<br>
carried out to form the catalyst layer having a<br>
prescribed thickness, the coated film is preferably<br>
subjected to a post-heat treatment to complete the<br>
thermal decomposition of the coated film. By this<br>
treatment, the catalyst layer can be stabilized. The<br>
post-heat treatment may be carried out usually in air,<br>
but can be carried out in an inert gas atmosphere, if<br>
necessary. Temperature of the post-heat treatment is<br>
preferably in a range of 350°C to 600°C, and more<br>
preferably in a range of 400°C to 500°C. Alternatively,<br>
it may be the temperature similar to the temperature in<br>
the above-described thermal decomposition, i.e., 470 to<br>
600°C.<br>
[0066]<br>
When the post-heat treatment of the coated film is<br>
too short, further thermal decomposition of the coated<br>
film tends not to proceed well, and therefore the post-<br>
heat treatment is preferably longer. However, from the<br>
viewpoint of productivity, the post-heat treatment is<br>
preferably 20 minutes to 3 hours, and more preferably 30<br>
minutes to 2 hours.<br>
[0067]<br>
[Electrolysis step]<br>
In the electrolysis step, the coated film after the<br>
above-described post-heat treatment is electrolyzed. It<br>
should be noted that, when an application liquid<br>
including an organic acid having a valence of two or more<br>
and an organic compound having two or more hydroxyl<br>
groups subjected to an esterification reaction with the<br>
organic acid is used, this electrolysis step may not be<br>
necessarily carried out. The above-described<br>
electrolysis step may be carried out as electrolysis for<br>
an alkali metal compound at use of the cathode for<br>
hydrogen generation. When the electrolysis step is<br>
carried out in production of the cathode for hydrogen<br>
generation, specific procedures and conditions are<br>
exemplified by the conditions that electrolysis is<br>
carried out in aqueous caustic soda solution at a current<br>
density of 0.1 to 12 kA/m2, during which progression of<br>
hydrogen generation from the electrode can be observed.<br>
By this electrolysis, iridium-platinum alloy can be<br>
formed in the catalyst layer.<br>
[0068]<br>
By the procedures as mentioned above, the cathode<br>
for hydrogen generation, which is suitable for<br>
electrolytic use of an aqueous alkali metal chloride<br>
solution, and has a low hydrogen overvoltage, a high<br>
durability, and further superior resistance against the<br>
reverse current when operation of the electrolyzer is<br>
stopped, as well as superior resistance against Fe ion in<br>
the electrolytic solution, can be produced.<br>
[0069]<br>
[Electrolyzer for electrolysis]<br>
The present invention also provides an electrolyzer<br>
for electrolysis of water or an alkali metal compound (in<br>
particular, alkali metal chloride) equipped with the<br>
above-described cathode for hydrogen generation of the<br>
present invention. As a constitution of the electrolyzer<br>
for electrolysis, the common constitution to those<br>
skilled in the art can be employed. The electrolyzer for<br>
electrolysis is typically an electrolytic solution, a<br>
container holding the electrolytic solution, anode and<br>
cathode dipped in electrolytic solution, ion-exchange<br>
membrane separating anode chamber and cathode chamber, as<br>
well as power source connecting both electrodes, and as<br>
the cathode, the cathode for hydrogen generation of the<br>
present invention is used. As the electrolytic solution,<br>
for example, aqueous sodium chloride solution (salt<br>
water), potassium chloride, in the anode chamber, and<br>
aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, aqueous potassium<br>
hydroxide solution in the cathode chamber, or the like,<br>
can be used. As a material for the anode, for example,<br>
the material in which ruthenium oxide, iridium oxide and<br>
titanium oxide are formed on the titanium base material<br>
(so-called DSA), or the like can be used. As the ion-<br>
exchange membrane, for example, "Aciplex" (registered TM)<br>
F6801 (produced by Asahi Kasei Chemicals Corp.) or the<br>
like can be used. In the electrolyzer for electrolysis<br>
of the present invention, any device for preventing the<br>
reverse current is not required, because it is equipped<br>
with the cathode having superior resistance against the<br>
reverse current. Therefore, in the electrolyzer for<br>
electrolysis of the present invention, electrolysis is<br>
easy.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0070]<br>
The present invention will be further explained<br>
based on Examples, but the present invention is not<br>
limited to the Examples. Each evaluation was carried out<br>
according to the method described below.<br>
[0071]<br>
(Crystal structure)<br>
Measurement was carried out using an X-ray<br>
diffractometer (Ultra X18, manufactured by Rigaku Corp.)<br>
with Cu-Ka line (? = 1.54184 Å) under the following<br>
conditions: acceleration voltage: 50 kV, acceleration<br>
current: 200 mA, scanning axis: 2?/?, step interval:<br>
0.02°, scanning speed: 2.0°/minute, and measurement range:<br>
20=20 to 60°.<br>
[0072]<br>
In order to measure the degree of crystallinity of<br>
iridium oxide, a full width at half maximum was<br>
calculated from the diffraction peak of iridium oxide<br>
(IrO2) at 2?=34.70°. The value of full width at half<br>
maximum was calculated using the analysis software<br>
accompanying to the X-ray diffractometer.<br>
[0073]<br>
In addition, whether iridium-platinum alloy has been<br>
formed by the electrolysis or not was identified by<br>
confirming whether a peak shifted to a higher angle side<br>
from the diffraction position of metal platinum is<br>
present or not.<br>
[0074]<br>
(Salt electrolysis test by the ion-exchange membrane<br>
process)<br>
A salt electrolysis test by the ion-exchange<br>
membrane process was carried out using a small sized<br>
electrolysis cell, to measure hydrogen overvoltage and<br>
variation of mass between before and after the test. A<br>
test cathode was cut out in the size of 48 mm x 58 mm,<br>
two holes were made at two positions to fix the cathode<br>
on the small-sized electrolysis cell with nickel screw,<br>
and the test cathode was fixed on a nickel-made expanded<br>
base material. A PFA (tetrafluoroethylene<br>
perfluoroalkylvynyl ether copolymer) - covered platinum<br>
wire in which about 1 mm of the platinum part has been<br>
exposed was fixed in the side facing to the ion-exchange<br>
membrane of the cathode face to use as the standard<br>
electrode. As the anode, so-called DSA in which<br>
ruthenium oxide, iridium oxide and titanium oxide are<br>
formed on the titanium base material was used. The<br>
electrolysis was carried out in a state in which the<br>
anode cell and the cathode cell were separated by holding<br>
between the ion-exchange membrane by rubber gaskets made<br>
of EPDM (ethylene-propylene-diene). As the ion-exchange<br>
membrane, "Aciplex" (registered TM) F4203 (produced by<br>
Asahi Kasei Chemicals Corp.) was used. The anode and the<br>
ion-exchange membrane were closely stuck, but there was a<br>
space of 2 mm between the cathode and the ion-exchange<br>
membrane. Concentrations of the solutions in the anode<br>
and cathode tanks were adjusted so that the concentration<br>
of the salt water in the anode chamber became 205 g/L,<br>
and the concentration of sodium hydroxide in the cathode<br>
chamber became 32% by weight. In addition, temperatures<br>
in the anode and cathode tanks were adjusted so that the<br>
temperature in the electrolysis cell became 90°C.<br>
Electrolysis was carried out for 1 week while<br>
electrolytic current density was maintained constant at 4<br>
kA/m2. Hydrogen overvoltage was determined after 7 days<br>
from the initiation of electrolysis by a current<br>
interrupter method. Hydrogen overvoltage was measured<br>
using a current pulse generator (manufactured by Hokuto<br>
Denko Corp., HC114) as a rectifier for electrolysis, by<br>
blocking off the current instantaneously, observing the<br>
wave pattern by an analyzing recorder or the like, and<br>
removing the solution resistance between the reference<br>
electrode. Specifically, the hydrogen overvoltage was<br>
obtained by subtracting the voltage when current was<br>
blocked off instantaneously, which was a voltage based on<br>
structural resistance and solution resistance, from a<br>
voltage of the test cathode to the reference electrode at<br>
4 kA/m2.<br>
[0075]<br>
(Reverse current resistance test)<br>
Evaluation of the resistance against the reverse<br>
current was carried out according to the following<br>
procedures. The test cathode was cut out in 3 cm x 3 cm,<br>
and fixed to the electrolysis cell with screws made of<br>
nickel. After positive electrolysis was carried out in<br>
an aqueous solution of 32% by weight of sodium hydroxide<br>
at 60°C and an electrolytic current density of 8 kA/m2 for<br>
72 hours using a platinum plate as a counter electrode so<br>
that the test cathode generated hydrogen, reverse<br>
electrolysis was carried out at a current density of<br>
reverse current of 0.05 kA/m2 for 2 hours, and positive<br>
electrolysis was further carried out at an electrolytic<br>
current density of 8 kA/m2 for 24 hours. After the test,<br>
the test cathode was taken out, rinsed with pure water<br>
all day and night, and sufficiently dried at 50°C, then<br>
mass was measured. From the difference between this and<br>
mass of the cathode before the test, variation of mass<br>
between before and after the electrolysis was calculated.<br>
[0076]<br>
[Example 1]<br>
As the conductive base material, a woven mesh base<br>
material which was made by knitting a nickel fine wire<br>
having a diameter of 0.15 mm in a sieve mesh size of 40<br>
was used. The conductive base material was blasted with<br>
alumina powder having a weight average particle size of<br>
100 µm or less, then subjected to an acid treatment in 6N<br>
hydrochloric acid at room temperature for 5 minutes,<br>
followed by rinsing with water and drying.<br>
[0077]<br>
Subsequently, an application liquid was prepared by<br>
mixing a dinitrodiammineplatinum nitric acid solution<br>
(produced by Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K., platinum<br>
concentration: 100 g/L) and an iridium chloride solution<br>
(produced by Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K., iridium<br>
concentration: 100 g/L) so that a molar ratio of platinum<br>
to iridium became 0.27: 0.73.<br>
[0078]<br>
A vat including the application liquid was placed in<br>
the lowest part of the coating roll, and the application<br>
liquid was impregnated into the coating rolls made of<br>
EPDM. A roll was placed above the vat so that said roll<br>
and the application liquid were in contact at any time,<br>
and another roller made of PVC was further placed above<br>
the roll. In such way, the application liquid was coated<br>
on said conductive base material. Before the application<br>
liquid dried, the conductive base material was quickly<br>
passed between two sponge rolls made of EPDM to absorb<br>
and remove the accumulated application liquid in the<br>
intersections of the mesh of the conductive base<br>
material. Subsequently, after a coated film was formed<br>
by drying at 50°C for 10 minutes, the coated film was<br>
subjected to by calcination at 500°C for 10 minutes using<br>
a Muffle furnace (KM-600, manufactured by Advantech Co.,<br>
Ltd.) to thermally decompose the coated film. These<br>
procedures of coating, drying and thermal decomposition<br>
were repeated 12 times, respectively. Furthermore, the<br>
conductive base material was subjected to the post-heat<br>
treatment in an air atmosphere at 500°C for 1 hour, to<br>
prepare the test cathode.<br>
[0079]<br>
According to the methods described above, X-ray<br>
diffraction measurement, salt electrolysis test by the<br>
ion-exchange membrane process and reverse current<br>
resistance test were carried out. The X-ray diffraction<br>
patterns before the salt electrolysis test by the ion-<br>
exchange membrane process are shown in Fig. 1, and the X-<br>
ray diffraction patterns after the salt electrolysis test<br>
by the ion-exchange membrane process are shown in Fig. 2.<br>
The results of the salt electrolysis test by the ion-<br>
exchange membrane process are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0080]<br>
In the X-ray diffraction peaks (Fig. 1) before the<br>
electrolysis test, peak 1 of iridium oxide can be clearly<br>
observed whereas clear peak of metal platinum cannot be<br>
observed. From this, it can be understood that the<br>
catalyst layer before the electrolysis test is composed<br>
of crystalline iridium oxide and amorphous platinum. In<br>
addition, the full width at half maximum of the X-ray<br>
diffraction peak (20=34.70°) of iridium oxide was 0.38°.<br>
From the X-ray diffraction peaks (Fig. 2) of the catalyst<br>
layer before and after the electrolysis test, in the X-<br>
ray diffraction peaks after the electrolysis test, a<br>
diffraction peak of iridium-platinum alloy was observed<br>
at around 20=47°, that is the position shifted from angle<br>
2 of the diffraction peak of metal platinum toward the<br>
side of peak 3 of the diffraction peak of metal iridium,<br>
in other words, higher angle side. From this fact, it<br>
was found that iridium-platinum alloy was formed by the<br>
electrolysis.<br>
[0081]<br>
The results of the salt electrolysis test by the<br>
aforesaid ion-exchange membrane process are shown in<br>
Table 1. The hydrogen overvoltage at 4 kA/m2 was 89 mV,<br>
showing that a cathode having a low hydrogen overvoltage<br>
was obtained. As a result of the reverse current<br>
resistance test, weight loss of the cathode after the<br>
test in comparison with the one before the test was 4.0<br>
mg, showing that a cathode having a high resistance<br>
against the reverse current was obtained.<br>
[0082]<br>
Furthermore, using this test cathode, evaluation of<br>
resistance against Fe ion in the electrolytic solution<br>
was carried out. Evaluation of the resistance against Fe<br>
ion was carried out by measuring the interelectrode<br>
voltage between anode and cathode using a small-sized<br>
cell described below. The test cathode was cut out in a<br>
size of longitudinal side 95 mm x traversal side 110 mm,<br>
and the edge sections (about 2 mm width each) of 4 sides<br>
were subjected to folding at a right angle. A mat<br>
knitted with fine nickel wire was placed on an expanded<br>
metal current collector made of nickel fixed on the<br>
cathode cell, and the mat was covered with the above-<br>
described folded test cathode so that the folded parts<br>
came to the collector and mat side. Four corners of the<br>
test cathode were fixed to the collector with a string<br>
made of Teflon (registered TM). As an anode, a so-called<br>
DSA in which ruthenium oxide, iridium oxide and titanium<br>
oxide were formed on the titanium base material was used.<br>
Electrolysis was carried out in such state in which the<br>
anode cell and the cathode cell were separated by holding<br>
between an ion-exchange membrane by rubber gaskets made<br>
of EPDM (ethylene-propylene-diene). As an ion-exchange<br>
membrane, "Aciplex" (registered TM) F6801 (produced by<br>
Asahi Kasei Chemicals Corp.) was used. Electrolysis was<br>
carried out in a state in which the anode, the ion-<br>
exchange membrane and the cathode were closely stuck<br>
(zero-gap electrolysis). Concentrations of the solutions<br>
in the anode and cathode tanks were adjusted so that<br>
concentration of the salt water in the anode chamber<br>
became 205 g/L and concentration of sodium hydroxide in<br>
the cathode chamber became 32% by weight. In addition,<br>
the temperatures in the anode and cathode tanks were<br>
adjusted so that the temperature in the electrolysis cell<br>
became 90°C. After electrolysis was carried out at an<br>
electrolytic current density of 6 kA/m2 for 7 days,<br>
concentration of Fe ion in the cathode chamber was<br>
adjusted so as to become 1 ppm by adding ferric chloride<br>
into the cathode chamber, and electrolysis was continued<br>
for further 90 days. In order to compare the effect of<br>
Fe ion, electrolysis was carried out at the same time<br>
using another small-sized cell under the same conditions,<br>
except that ferric chloride was not added into the<br>
cathode chamber. Concentration of Fe ion in the cathode<br>
chamber when ferric chloride was not added was 0.1 ppm or<br>
less. Providing that the pair to pair voltage difference<br>
between both cells right before the addition of Fe ion<br>
was 0, the pair to pair voltage difference between both<br>
cells after continuation of electrolysis for 90 days was<br>
6 mV. From this result, it is clear that the test<br>
cathode was not influenced by Fe ion.<br>
[0083]<br>
[Example 2]<br>
An electrode was prepared and evaluated in the same<br>
way as in Example 1, except that an application liquid<br>
was prepared by mixing a dinitrodiammineplatinum nitric<br>
acid solution (produced by Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K.,<br>
platinum concentration: 100 g/L) and an iridium chloride<br>
solution (produced by Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K.,<br>
iridium concentration: 100 g/L) so that a molar ratio of<br>
platinum to iridium became 0.4: 0.6.<br>
[0084]<br>
In the X-ray diffraction peaks before the<br>
electrolysis test (Fig. 1), the peak of iridium oxide can<br>
be clearly observed whereas a clear peak of metal<br>
platinum cannot be observed. From this, it can be<br>
understood that the catalyst layer before the<br>
electrolysis test is composed of crystalline iridium<br>
oxide and amorphous platinum. In addition, the full<br>
width at half maximum of the X-ray diffraction peak<br>
(20=34.70°) of iridium oxide was 0.42°. Similarly to in<br>
Example 1, it can be understood that iridium-platinum<br>
alloy had been formed from the X-ray diffraction peaks<br>
after the electrolysis test.<br>
[0085]<br>
As shown in Table 1, as a result of the salt<br>
electrolysis test by the ion-exchange membrane process,<br>
the hydrogen overvoltage at 4 kA/m2 was 92 mV, showing<br>
that a cathode having a low hydrogen overvoltage was<br>
obtained. As a result of the reverse current resistance<br>
test, weight loss after the test in comparison with the<br>
one before the test was 4.7 mg, showing that a cathode<br>
having a high resistance against the reverse current was<br>
obtained.<br>
[0086]<br>
[Example 3]<br>
A cathode was prepared and evaluated in the same way<br>
as in Example 1, except that the cathode was subjected to<br>
the thermal decomposition at 470°C for 10 minutes, and<br>
further subjected to the post-heat treatment at 470°C for<br>
1 hour after the thermal decomposition.<br>
[0087]<br>
In the X-ray diffraction peak (Fig. 1) before the<br>
electrolysis test, the clear peak of iridium oxide can be<br>
observed whereas a clear peak of metal platinum cannot be<br>
observed. From this, it can be understood that the<br>
catalyst layer before the electrolysis test is composed<br>
of crystalline iridium oxide and amorphous platinum. In<br>
addition, full width at half maximum of the X-ray<br>
diffraction peak (26= 34.70°) of iridium oxide was 0.46°.<br>
Furthermore, similarly to as in Example 1, it can be<br>
understood that iridium-platinum alloy had been formed<br>
from the X-ray diffraction peaks after the electrolysis<br>
test.<br>
[0088]<br>
As shown in Table 1, as a result of the salt<br>
electrolysis test by the ion-exchange membrane process,<br>
the hydrogen overvoltage at 4 kA/m2 was 90 mV, and a<br>
cathode having a low hydrogen overvoltage was obtained.<br>
As a result of the reverse current resistance test,<br>
weight loss after the test in comparison with the one<br>
before the test was 4.8 mg, and a cathode having a high<br>
resistance against the reverse current was obtained.<br>
[0089]<br>
[Example 4]<br>
As a conductive base material, a woven mesh base<br>
material which was made by knitting a nickel fine wire<br>
having a diameter of 0.15 mm in sieve mesh size of 40<br>
mesh was used. The base material was blasted with<br>
alumina powder having a weight average particle size of<br>
100 µm or less. After that, the base material was<br>
subjected to etching by dipping into 6N hydrochloric acid<br>
for 5 minutes, followed by rinsing with water and drying.<br>
[0090]<br>
A solution was prepared using a chloroiridic acid<br>
solution (produced by Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K.) having<br>
an iridium concentration of 100 g/L and a<br>
dinitrodiammineplatinum nitric acid solution (produced by<br>
Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K.) having a platinum<br>
concentration of 100 g/L so that a molar ratio of iridium<br>
to platinum included in the application liquid became<br>
0.73:0.27. After that, when the total mole number of<br>
iridium and platinum was assumed to be 1, citric acid<br>
monohydrate of an amount corresponding to a molar ratio<br>
of 0.36 and ethylene glycol of an amount corresponding to<br>
0.72 were added thereto, respectively, to obtain an<br>
application liquid.<br>
[0091]<br>
A vat including the application liquid was placed in<br>
the lowest part of the coating roll, and the application<br>
liquid was impregnated into the coating rolls made of<br>
EPDM. A roll was placed above the vat so that said roll<br>
and the application liquid were in contact at any time,<br>
and another roller made of PVC was further placed above<br>
said roll. In such way, the application liquid was<br>
coated on the conductive base material. Before the<br>
application liquid dried, the conductive base material<br>
was quickly passed between two sponge rolls made of EPDM<br>
to absorb and remove the accumulated application liquid<br>
in the intersections of the mesh of the conductive base<br>
material. Subsequently, after a coated film was formed<br>
by drying at 150°C for 10 minutes, said coated film was<br>
subjected to heating at 500°C for 10 minutes using a<br>
Muffle furnace (KM-600, manufactured by Advantech Co.,<br>
Ltd.) to thermally decompose said coated film. These<br>
procedures of coating, drying and thermal decomposition<br>
were repeated 12 times, respectively. Furthermore, the<br>
conductive base material was subjected to the post-heat<br>
treatment in an air atmosphere at 500°C for 1 hour, to<br>
prepare the test cathode.<br>
[0092]<br>
The results of the salt electrolysis test by the<br>
ion-exchange membrane process using this cathode are<br>
shown in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, a cathode having<br>
a low hydrogen overvoltage was obtained.<br>
[0093]<br>
The X-ray diffraction pattern of the test cathode<br>
measured before the salt electrolysis test by the ion-<br>
exchange membrane process is shown in Fig. 3. A<br>
diffraction peak 4 of iridium-platinum alloy was observed<br>
around 20=47°, that is the position shifted from angle 2<br>
of the diffraction peak of metal platinum toward the side<br>
of peak 3 of the diffraction peak of metal iridium, that<br>
is, higher angle side. It can be understood that<br>
iridium-platinum alloy had been formed since before the<br>
energization in the cathode prepared in this Example. In<br>
addition, the full width at half maximum of the X-ray<br>
diffraction peak of iridium oxide (20=34.70°) was 0.37°.<br>
[0094]<br>
Next, the X-ray diffraction patterns of the test<br>
cathode measured after the salt electrolysis test by the<br>
ion-exchange membrane process are shown in Fig. 4 (a) and<br>
(b). The diffraction pattern (a) and (b) show those<br>
after electrolysing times of 170 hours and 550 hours,<br>
respectively. Regardless of the electrolyzing time,<br>
intensities of the diffraction lines of iridium oxide and<br>
intensities of the diffraction lines of iridium-platinum<br>
alloy did not change.<br>
[0095]<br>
As shown in Table 1, as a result of the salt<br>
electrolysis test by the ion-exchange membrane process,<br>
the hydrogen overvoltage at 4 kA/m2 was 91 mV, and a<br>
cathode having a low hydrogen overvoltage was obtained.<br>
As a result of the reverse current resistance test,<br>
weight loss after the test in comparison with the one<br>
before the test was 3.0 mg, and a cathode having a high<br>
resistance against the reverse current was obtained. In<br>
this Example, a cathode which has a low overvoltage and a<br>
stable crystalline structure of the catalyst layer even<br>
after a long period of energization was obtained.<br>
[0096]<br>
[Example 5]<br>
A solution was prepared using a chloroiridic acid<br>
solution having an iridium concentration of 100 g/L and a<br>
dinitrodiammineplatinum nitric acid solution having a<br>
platinum concentration of 100 g/L so that a molar ratio<br>
of iridium to platinum became 0.73:0.27. After that,<br>
citric acid in an amount corresponding to a molar ratio<br>
of 0.36 and ethylene glycol in an amount corresponding to<br>
a molar ratio of 0.72 were added thereto, respectively,<br>
when the total mole number of iridium and platinum was<br>
assumed to be 1. Using this solution as an application<br>
liquid, a Ni-woven mesh base material was coated with the<br>
application liquid, then dried at 150°C, followed by<br>
thermal decomposition at 500°C. After repeating the cycle<br>
of procedures composed of application, drying and thermal<br>
decomposition 12 times, the base material was subjected<br>
to heating in a nitrogen atmosphere at 500°C for 60<br>
minutes, to prepare a cathode. The results of the salt<br>
electrolysis test by the ion-exchange membrane process<br>
using this cathode are shown in Table 1. As shown in<br>
Table 1, a cathode having a low hydrogen overvoltage was<br>
obtained in this Example.<br>
[0097]<br>
The full width at half maximum of the X-ray<br>
diffraction peak of iridium oxide (29=34.70°) in the X-ray<br>
diffraction peak before the electrolysis test was 0.38°.<br>
Furthermore, similarly to in Example 4, it can be<br>
understood that iridium-platinum alloy had been formed<br>
from the X-ray diffraction peak before the electrolysis<br>
test.<br>
[0098]<br>
As shown in Table 1, as a result of the salt<br>
electrolysis test by the ion-exchange membrane process,<br>
the hydrogen overvoltage at 4 kA/m2 was 92 mV, and a<br>
cathode having a low hydrogen overvoltage was obtained.<br>
As a result of the reverse current resistance test,<br>
weight loss of the cathode after the test in comparison<br>
with the one before the test was 1.0 mg, andt a cathode<br>
having a high resistance against the reverse current was<br>
obtained.<br>
[0099]<br>
[Comparative Example 1]<br>
A cathode was prepared in the same way as in Example<br>
1, except that only chloroplatinic acid solution<br>
(produced by Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K., platinum<br>
concentration: 100 g/L) was used as an application<br>
liquid. By the above-described method, the salt<br>
electrolysis test by the ion-exchange membrane process<br>
was carried out. The results of the salt electrolysis<br>
test by the ion-exchange membrane process are shown in<br>
Table 2.<br>
[0100]<br>
As a result of the salt electrolysis test by the<br>
ion-exchange membrane process, the hydrogen overvoltage<br>
at 4 kA/m2 was 84 mV. As a result of the reverse current<br>
resistance test, weight loss of the cathode after the<br>
test in comparison with the one before the test was 7.5<br>
mg, which was great, and it was found that the resistance<br>
against the reverse current was not sufficient.<br>
[0101]<br>
[Comparative Example 2]<br>
A cathode was prepared and evaluated in the same way<br>
as in Example 1, except that only iridium chloride<br>
solution (produced by Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K.,<br>
iridium concentration: 100 g/L) was used as an<br>
application liquid.<br>
[0102]<br>
From the X-ray diffraction peaks (Fig. 5) before the<br>
thermal electrolysis test, the full width at half maximum<br>
of the X-ray diffraction peak of iridium oxide (20=34.70°)<br>
was 0.86°.<br>
[0103]<br>
As shown in Table 2, as a result of the salt<br>
electrolysis test by the ion-exchange membrane process,<br>
hydrogen overvoltage at 4 kA/m2 was 99 mV. As a result of<br>
the reverse current resistance test, weight loss of the<br>
cathode after the test in comparison with the one before<br>
the test was 10.6 mg. It was found that when the<br>
catalyst layer was made only with the iridium chloride<br>
solution, weight loss became great and the resistance<br>
against the reverse current was not sufficient because of<br>
the low degree in crystallinity of iridium oxide.<br>
[0104]<br>
[Comparative Example 3]<br>
A cathode was prepared and evaluated in the same way<br>
as in Example 1, except that temperatures of the thermal<br>
decomposition and the post-heat treatment were changed<br>
from 500°C to 400°C, respectively.<br>
[0105]<br>
From the X-ray diffraction peaks before the<br>
electrolysis test (Fig. 5), the full width at half<br>
maximum of the X-ray diffraction peak of iridium oxide<br>
(20-34.70°) was 0.82°.<br>
[0106]<br>
As shown in Table 2, as a result of the salt<br>
electrolysis test by the ion-exchange membrane process,<br>
hydrogen overvoltage at 4 kA/m2 was 8 9 mV. As a result of<br>
the reverse current resistance test, weight loss of the<br>
cathode after the test in comparison with the one before<br>
the test was 13.2 mg. It was found that weight loss was<br>
great and the resistance against the reverse current was<br>
not sufficient because of low degree of crystallinity of<br>
iridium oxide as a framework.<br>
[0107]<br>
[Comparative Example 4]<br>
A cathode was prepared and evaluated in the same way<br>
as in Example 1, except that temperatures of the thermal<br>
decomposition and the post-heat treatment were changed<br>
from 500°C to 450°C, respectively.<br>
[0108]<br>
From the X-ray diffraction peaks before the<br>
electrolysis test (Fig. 5), the full width at half<br>
maximum of the X-ray diffraction peak of iridium oxide<br>
(2?=34.70°) was 0.50°.<br>
[0109]<br>
As shown in Table 2, as a result of the salt<br>
electrolysis test by the ion-exchange membrane process,<br>
the hydrogen overvoltage at 4 kA/m2 was 89 mV. As a<br>
result of the reverse current resistance test, weight<br>
loss of the cathode after the test in comparison with the<br>
one before the test was 6.7 mg. It could be understood<br>
that weight loss was great and the resistance against the<br>
reverse current was not sufficient because of the low<br>
degree in crystallinity of iridium oxide as a framework.<br>
[0110]<br>
[Comparative Example 5]<br>
A cathode was prepared and evaluated in the same way<br>
as in Example 1, except that an application liquid was<br>
prepared by mixing a chloroplatinic acid solution<br>
(produced by Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K., platinum<br>
concentration: 100 g/L) and a iridium chloride solution<br>
(produced by Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K., iridium<br>
concentration: 100 g/L) so that a molar ratio of platinum<br>
to iridium became 0.39:0.61, and the thermal<br>
decomposition and the post-heat treatment after the<br>
thermal decomposition were carried out at 450°C for 10<br>
minutes and 450°C for 1 hour, respectively.<br>
[0111]<br>
From the X-ray diffraction peaks before the<br>
electrolysis test (Fig. 5) , the full width at half<br>
maximum of the X-ray diffraction peak of iridium oxide<br>
(29=34.70°) was 0.49°.<br>
[0112]<br>
As shown in Table 2, as a result of the salt<br>
electrolysis test by the ion-exchange membrane process,<br>
the hydrogen overvoltage at 4 kA/m2 was 90 mV. As a<br>
result of the reverse current resistance test, weight<br>
loss of the cathode after the test in comparison with the<br>
one before the test was 6.7 mg. It was found that weight<br>
loss was great and the resistance against the reverse<br>
current was not sufficient because of the low degree in<br>
crystallinity of iridium oxide as a framework.<br>
[0113]<br>
[Comparative Example 6]<br>
A cathode was prepared and evaluated in the same way<br>
as in Example 1, except that only ruthenium chloride<br>
solution (produced by Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K.,<br>
ruthenium concentration: 100 g/L) was used as an<br>
application liquid.<br>
[0114]<br>
As shown in Table 2, as a result of the salt<br>
electrolysis test by the ion-exchange membrane process,<br>
the hydrogen overvoltage at 4 kA/m2 was 82 mV. As a<br>
result of the reverse current resistance test, weight<br>
loss of the cathode after the test in comparison with the<br>
one before the test was 11.5 mg. It was found that when<br>
the catalyst layer was made only with a ruthenium<br>
chloride solution, weight loss was great and the<br>
resistance against the reverse current was not<br>
sufficient.<br>
[0115]<br>
[Example 6]<br>
A dinitrodiammineplatinum nitric acid solution<br>
(produced by Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K., platinum<br>
concentration: 100 g/L) and an iridium chloride solution<br>
(produced by Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K., platinum<br>
concentration: 100 g/L) were mixed together so that a<br>
molar ratio of platinum to iridium became 0.27:0.73.<br>
Cathode were prepared and evaluated in the same way as in<br>
Example 1, except that test cathodes having different<br>
masses of catalyst layer were made by varying the number<br>
of cycle composed of roll coating, drying and thermal<br>
decomposition. It should be noted that, similar to<br>
Example 1, it was found that iridium-platinum alloy<br>
formed from the X-ray diffraction peak after the<br>
electrolysis test.<br>
[0116]<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, it was found that the cathodes<br>
obtained in the present Example showed low hydrogen<br>
overvoltage even used amount of platinum is less. It<br>
should be noted that, in the plotting in Fig. 6, the<br>
horizontal axis represents a relative amount value when<br>
mass of platinum element in the catalyst in the rightmost<br>
plot in Fig. 6 in Example 6 is assumed to be 1, and the<br>
vertical axis represents a hydrogen overvoltage at a<br>
current density of 4 kA/m2. Starting from the right in<br>
Fig. 6, as relative amount values of platinum element in<br>
the catalyst, for Example 6, 1 (hydrogen overvoltage<br>
value: 83 mV), 0.75 (hydrogen overvoltage value: 87 mV) ,<br>
0.39 (hydrogen overvoltage value: 8 9 mV) , 0.30 (hydrogen<br>
overvoltage value: 90 mV), and 0.21 (hydrogen overvoltage<br>
value: 94 mV) are shown, and for Comparative Example 7 to<br>
be described later, 1.31 (hydrogen overvoltage value: 96<br>
mV), 0.8 6 (hydrogen overvoltage value: 90 mV), and 0.34<br>
(hydrogen overvoltage value: 121 mV) are shown, and for<br>
Comparative Example 8 to be described later, 1.2 9<br>
(hydrogen overvoltage value: 96 mV) , 1.01 (hydrogen<br>
overvoltage value: 95 mV) , 0.53 (hydrogen overvoltage<br>
value: 97 mV), and 0.26 (hydrogen overvoltage value: 145<br>
mV) are shown.<br>
[0117]<br>
[Comparative Example 7]<br>
As the conductive base material, a woven mesh base<br>
material which was made by knitting a nickel fine wire<br>
having a diameter of 0.15 mm in sieve mesh size of 40<br>
mesh was used. The base material was blasted with<br>
alumina powder having a weight average particle size of<br>
100 µm or less. After that, the base material was<br>
subjected to an acid treatment by dipping into 6N<br>
hydrochloric acid at room temperature for 5 minutes,<br>
followed by rinsing with water and drying.<br>
[0118]<br>
An application liquid was prepared by mixing a<br>
dinitrodiammineplatinum nitric acid solution (produced by<br>
Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K., platinum concentration: 100<br>
g/L) and nickel nitrate hexahydrate (produced by Tanaka<br>
Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K.) so that a molar ratio of platinum<br>

A vat including the application liquid was placed in<br>
the lowest part of the coating roll, and the application<br>
liquid was impregnated into the coating rolls made of<br>
EPDM. A roll was placed above the vat so that the roll<br>
and the application liquid were in contact at any time,<br>
and another roller made of PVC was further placed above<br>
said roll. In such way, the application liquid was<br>
coated on the conductive base material. Before the<br>
application liquid dried up, the conductive base material<br>
was quickly passed between two sponge rolls made of EPDM<br>
to absorb and remove the accumulated application liquid<br>
in the intersections of the mesh of the conductive base<br>
material. Subsequently, after a coated film was formed<br>
by drying at 80°C for 10 minutes, said coated film was<br>
subjected to calcination at 400°C for 10 minutes using a<br>
Muffle furnace (KM-600, manufactured by Advantech Co.,<br>
Ltd.) to thermally decompose said coated film. By varying<br>
the number of this cycle composed of roll coating, drying<br>
and thermal decomposition, test cathodes having different<br>
masses of catalyst layer were prepared.<br>
[0120]<br>
Subsequently, the cathodes were subjected to<br>
electrolytic reduction in an aqueous solution of 32% by<br>
weight caustic soda, at 88°C, and at a current density of<br>
1.0 kA/m2 for 5 minutes, and after that, salt electrolysis<br>
test was carried out.<br>
[0121]<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the cathodes obtained in present<br>
Comparative Example did not show a low hydrogen<br>
overvoltage when used amount of platinum is less. From<br>
this, it was found that the cathode for hydrogen<br>
generation of the present invention has a high platinum<br>
utilization efficiency.<br>
[0122]<br>
[Comparative Example 8]<br>
A cathode was prepared and evaluated in the same way<br>
as in Comparative Example 7, except that the calcination<br>
was carried out at 500°C.<br>
[0123]<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the cathodes obtained in this<br>
Comparative Example did not show a low hydrogen<br>
overvoltage when used amount of platinum is less. From<br>
this, it was found that the cathode for hydrogen<br>
generation of the present invention has a high platinum<br>
utilization efficiency.<br>
