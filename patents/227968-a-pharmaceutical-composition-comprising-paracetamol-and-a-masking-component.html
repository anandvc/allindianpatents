				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising paracetamol and a masking component.<br>
Paracetamol is a well known compound having pharmaceutical properties.  One of its best known modes of action is as an analgesic.  It is also known that paracetamol has an extremely bitter taste which can make it particularly unpleasant to take orally.<br>
Paracetamol based compositions are often used as "cold remedies".  Such compositions may not cure the underlying condition, but may treat or alleviate the symptoms of colds or influenza, including headaches, fever, rhinitis and general aches and pains.  An example of such a composition is "Lemsip" (trade mark) which is a lemon-flavoured powdered composition intended to be diluted with warm or hot water before use.  Such a composition is formulated with sweeteners such that the bitter taste of the paracetamol is masked.  In order to mask the bitter taste to an acceptable extent when the composition is diluted with about 150 ml water, a mixture of no less than three sweeteners has been found to be necessary.      These   sweeteners   are   sugar (sucrose), aspartame and saccharin.<br>
However, when the composition is diluted with lesser amounts of water, for example about 20 to 100 ml water, the sweeteners present in the composition make the composition overpoweringly sweet.  Reducing the amount of sweeteners can<br><br><br>
overcome this problem, but then the bitter taste of the paracetamol is insufficiently masked.  Thus ready-to-use formulations containing lesser amounts of water cannot be satisfactorily prepared.<br>
We have found that the bitter taste of paracetamol can be masked by using a combination of components.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising paracetamol and a masking component which reduces or masks   the bitter taste thereof which comprises at least two members chosen from the following groups i to vi:<br>
i.   pharmacologically acceptable magnesium salts, magnesium hydroxide and/or magnesium oxide;<br>
ii.  gingerin and/or ginger oil;<br>
iii. a delayed onset long lasting sweetener;<br>
iv.  soluble starch in a weight ratio of at least 1:15 with respect to the paracetamol;<br>
v.   an edible emulsifier having an HLB value of greater than 10; and<br>
vi.  glycine.<br>
  It has been found by the inventors that it is not possible to mask the taste or bitterness of paracetamol effectively,<br><br><br>
especially in liquid formulations comprising less than 100 ml water, by using a single masking agent. Instead it has been found that a combination of different masking agents is required. It has been found that even if one component is used in a concentrate such that it has its maximum effect in reducing the bitterness, the use of further components can surprisingly still reduce the bitterness taste further.<br>
Component i is a pharmacologically acceptable magnesium salt, magnesium oxide and/or magnesium hydroxide.  One or more magnesium salts, oxide or hydroxide may be used.  A pharmacologically acceptable salt is one which can safely be ingested in the amounts present in a dose of the composition.  Desirably the counter anion does not have an adverse masking effect.  Accordingly it is preferred to avoid the use of magnesium sulfate, although it may be used if the other components of the composition provide an adequate masking effect.  For example a mixture of magnesium chloride and magnesium sulfate may  be used.  It is also preferred to avoid using counter anions which have their own taste or which provide an undesired sensation such as bitterness or saltiness.  Examples of salts which are advantageously used are magnesium chloride, gluconate, hydroxide, carbonate and/or bicarbonate.<br>
Component ii is gingerin (also known as ginger oleoresin) or ginger oil (also known as gingerol).  These components are extracted from ginger, and are commercially available from, for example, Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd. Gingerin and gingerol may also be used together as a mixture.<br><br><br>
Component iii is a delayed onset long lasting sweetener. The term "delayed onset long lasting sweetener" is a term of art and  includes sweeteners which have a long-lasting action but which may not necessarily provide an initial burst of sweetness.  Examples of delayed onset long lasting sweeteners are Neohesperidine DC, Thaumatin and Glycyrrhizin, of which Thaumatin is preferred.  Thaumatin is available, for example, under the trade mark Talin.<br>
Component iv is soluble starch (also known as instant starch) .  Soluble starch is widely commercially available. An example of a suitable soluble starch is Ultratex 4 obtainable from National Starch.<br>
Component v is an edible emulsifier.  Such compounds are often used in, for example, the food manufacturing industry to emulsify ingredients.  Examples of edible emulsifiers are sugar esters, for example esters of sucrose, glucose, galactose or fructose, in particular with fatty acids (for example containing from 10 to 24 carbon atoms) and vegetable oils such as soya oil.  The edible emulsifiers have a high HLB value of greater than 10, preferably at least 12, more preferably at least 14, and generally yield stable milky dispersions to clear solutions in water.  Such emulsifiers are obtainable from, for example, Sistema B.V. Netherlands. Other useful emulsifiers are, for example, lecithin, glycerol mono stearate, diglycerin and the Polysorbate series such as Polysorbate 80.<br>
Component vi is glycine.  Glycine is widely available commercially, for example from Merck Ltd.<br><br><br>
vii.  a pharmacologically acceptable sodium salt.<br>
Component vii is a pharmacologically acceptable sodium salt. One or more sodium salts may be used.  A pharmacologically acceptable salt is one which can safely be ingested in the amounts present in a dose of the composition.  Desirably the counter anion does not have an adverse masking effect. Accordingly it is preferred to avoid the use of sodium sulfate, although it may be used if the other components of the composition provide an adequate masking effect.  It is also preferred to avoid using counter anions which have their own taste or which provide an undesired sensation such as bitterness or saltiness.  Examples of salts which are advantageously used are sodium acetate, carbonate, bicarbonate, citrate, gluconate, malate, lactate and chloride, propionate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, furmanate, tartrate and benzoate.<br>
The masking component comprises a mixture of the above individual components in amounts such that the bitter taste of paracetamol can be masked.  The amounts of the individual components, and the total amount of the components, can be determined easily by one skilled in the art using appropriate techniques.<br>
For example, a base composition comprising 650 mg paracetamol and 50 mg ascorbic acid in 40 ml water may be prepared, and, if desired, appropriate amounts of base components such as sweeteners and lemon flavour added.  The<br><br><br>
base composition is used as a control.  In order to test the effectiveness of a particular component, a measured amount of that component is added to the base formulation to prepare a first test formulation.  Further test formulations are then prepared in a similar way but containing different amounts of the component to be tested.  The test compositions are then assessed for masking of the bitter taste of the paracetamol, as compared with the control formulation, by a panel of testers, for example 3 or 4 testers .  From this test, appropriate amounts of individual components can be determined.  The teat can be modified appropriately for testing two or more compounds by first deciding on an appropriate amount of the first compound, and then repeating the test with the same amount of the first compound in the control formulation and all of the test formulations.  The amounts of each components will depend on various factors, including the possible presence of other masking components and the intended volume of dilution of the composition.<br>
The magnesium salt, hydroxide or oxide (i) is desirably present in a molar ratio of up to 0,01:1, calculated as magnesium atoms: paracetamol, preferably from 0.0001:1 to 0.01:1, more preferably from 0.001:1 to 0.01:1, most preferably from 0.001:1 to 0.005:1.<br>
The gingerin and/or gingerol (ii) is generally	used in an<br>
amount such that if it does not itself add any	taste to the<br>
composition, although it is possible to use it	in such an<br>
amount that the composition has a ginger taste	if desired.<br>
Generally the gingerin and/or gingerol is used	in a weight<br><br><br>
ratio of up to 1:10,000 gingerin and/or gingerol: paracetamol, preferably from 1:30,000 to 1:10,000, more preferably from 1:20,000 to 1:10,000.<br>
The delayed onset long lasting sweetener (iii) is generally used in a weight ratio of up to 1:100 with respect to the paracetamol, especially from 1:20,000 to 1:100, preferably from 1:10,000 to 1:100, and more preferably from 1:1,000 to 1:200.<br>
The soluble starch (iv) is used in a weight ratio of at least 1:15 with respect to the paracetamol and generally used in a weight ratio of up to 1:1 with respect to the paracetamol, especially from 1:10 to 1:1 and more especially from 1:10 to 1:2 .<br>
The edible emulsifier (v) is generally used in a weight ratio of up to 2:1 with respect to the paracetamol, especially from 1:40 to 2:1, preferably from 1:10 to 2:1, more preferably from 1:5 to 1:1, and even more preferably from 1:4 to 1:1.<br>
The glycine (vi) is generally used in a molar ratio of up to 2:1 with respect to the paracetamol, especially from 1:1 to 2:1, preferably from 1:4 to 1:1.<br>
The sodium salt (vii) in general is used in an amount such that it does not itself add any taste to the composition, especially if sodium chloride is used.  Desirably the sodium salt (vii) is present in a molar ratio of up to 1:1 calculated as sodium atoms: paracetamol, preferably from<br><br><br>
0.01:1 to 1:1, more preferably from 0.1:1 to 1:1 and most preferably from 0.3:1 to 0.7:1.<br>
The amount of the masking component containing the Individual masking compounds which is used will, of course, /ary depending on the individual compounds chosen.  As a guide, however, it is generally used in an amount of from .00001g to lg, preferably from 0.00006g to 0.6g, per gram of paracetamol.<br>
The masking component used in the present invention need anly contain two members selected from groups i to vi and optionally vii.  By this we mean that one member may be chosen from one of the groups and the other is chosen from any of the other groups, but not the same group.  It is, lowever, possible for more than one compound to be chosen Erom any group, so long as components from at least two different groups are chosen.  A single compound may act simultaneously as a compound from at least two different groups, for example a mixed salt containing both sodium and nagnesium ions.<br>
If members from two different groups are chosen, they may be ;hosen from, for example, groups i and ii; i and iii; i and iv; i and v; i and vi; ii and iii; ii and iv; ii and v; ii and vi; iii and iv; iii and v; iii and vi; iv and v; iv and ^i; and v and vi.<br>
If members from three different groups are chosen, they may oe chosen from, for example, groups i, ii and iii; i, ii and iv; i, ii and v; i, ii and vi; i, ii and vii; i, iii and iv;<br><br><br><br><br>
and vii; ii, iii, v, vi and vii; ii, iv, v, vi and vii; and iii, iv, v, vi and vii.<br>
If members from six different groups are chosen, they may be chosen from, for example, groups i, ii, iii, iv, v and vi; i, ii, iii, iv, v and vii; i, ii, iii, iv, vi and vii; i, ii, iii, v, vi and vii; i, ii, iv, v, vi and vii; i, iii, iv, v, vi and vii; and ii, iii, iv, v, vi and vii.<br>
It is also possible to have members chosen from all seven groups, namely groups i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi and vii.<br>
The composition may also comprise at least one other component if desired.  Thus it may, for example, comprise other active compounds such as ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, ketoprofen or pseudoephedrine hydrochloride; a flavouring agent such as lemon, berry, tutti frutti, pineapple, orange, menthol or mint flavour; dried fruit; sweeteners such as saccharin or the sodium salt thereof, a sugar such as sucrose or glucose or aspartame; components producing effervescence such as a mixture of an acid such as citric acid and a carbonate or bicarbonate such as sodium or potassium bicarbonate; colouring agents; preservatives; filler, pH adjusting agents such as acids, for example citric acid, and bases; pH buffers; solvents; and fillers. It should be understood that any of the additional components may also act as a component selected from groups i to vii as defined above.  Thus, for example, sodium bicarbonate can act both as a part of the effervescent producing component and as a member of group vii.<br><br><br>
The composition can be provided in any suitable form.  Thus, for example, it may be in the form of a solid such as a powder, granulate or tablet.  The solid form can simply be dissolved in water, generally warm or hot water, before use. Desirably the composition is dissolved in less than 100 ml water, preferably from 30 to 60 ml water, most preferably from 40 to 50 ml water.<br>
Preferably, however, the composition is sold in the form of a ready-to-use formulation which is already in aqueous form by dissolving or dispensing the abovementioned components in water.  Desirably the composition has a total volume of less than 100 ml, preferably less than 50 ml, more preferably from 30 to 50 ml and most preferably about 40 ml.  The aqueous composition may be sold in a package which is opened by a consumer shortly before use, and the composition heated, if desired, by the consumer.  Preferably, however, the composition is sold in a self-heating container which heats the composition to a desired temperature before use and without the consumer having to take any action apart from opening the container.  Such containers may be obtained from, for example, Thermotic Developments Ltd, UK; Chian s Forti 5.p.A., Italy; and Ontro Inc, USA.<br>
In order to prepare the compositions of the invention, the individual components may simply be mixed.  The order of mixing is not critical.  The masking component may, for example, be prepared separately and then added to the paracetamol, optionally in the presence of water and/or other components.  It is also possible, for example, to add the components of the masking component individually.<br><br><br>
The composition may be administered to a subject in need thereof or liable to be in need therefore in any effective amount.  Suitable doses of paracetamol are well known, for example, from 0.5g to lg per dose for an adult every 4 to 6 hours.<br>
The composition may be sold in bulk form. Desirably, however, the composition is in unit dosage form.<br>
The present invention also provides a composition as defined above for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy, preferably for use in a method of treatment of the symptoms of colds and influenza in humans.<br>
The present invention further provides the use of a masking component as defined above to reduce or mask the bitter taste of paracetamol.<br>
The present invention additionally provides the use of a masking component as defined above in the manufacture of a medicament comprising paracetamol for the treatment of the symptoms of colds and influenza in humans.<br>
The present invention yet further provides a method of treatment of the symptoms of colds and influenza, which comprises administering to a subject in need of such treatment an effective amount of a composition as defined above.<br><br><br>
Gingerin, ginger oil and starch have not previously been known to act as masking components for the bitterness of paracetamol.  Starch has not previously been known to act as<br>
masking component for bitterness of any component.<br>
Accordingly the present invention also provides the use of gingerin, ginger oil, soluble starch or a mixture thereof to reduce or mask or mask the bitter taste of paracetamol.  The present invention additionally provides the use of soluble starch to reduce or mask the bitter taste of a bitter tasting component.<br>
The present invention is now further described in the following Examples.<br><br><br><br>
Gingerin<br>
(0.1% in ethanol)	0.0400	g<br>
Magnesium gluconate	0.4000	g<br>
Thaumatin (0.1% soln)	0.3000	g<br>
Glycine	0.1600	g<br>
Soluble starch	0.1000	g<br>
The above composition was added to water to provide a solution having a total volume of 40 ml.  The composition was heated to 60°C and was found to have a pleasant taste with the bitterness of the paracetamol effectively masked.<br>
Control Example 1<br>
A control composition was prepared by mixing together the following components in the amounts indicated:<br>
Paracetamol	0.6500	g<br>
Ascorbic acid	0.0500	g<br>
Caster sugar	3.5000	g<br>
Citric acid	0.1868	g<br>
Sodium citrate	0.1332	g<br>
Lemon roller dried	0 . 0600	g<br>
Lemon flavour 1	0.2000	g<br>
Aspartame	0.0700	g<br>
Curcumin	0.0032	g<br>
The above composition was added to water to provide a solution having a total volume of 40ml.  The composition was heated to 60°C and was found to have a bitter taste.  Further control formulations were prepared in a similar manner<br><br><br>
except for varying the amount of paracetamol.  A composition containing 4 0% of the above amount of paracetamol was found to be only slightly bitter.  A composition containing 60% of the paracetamol was found to have about one third of the bitterness of the 100% control, and a composition containing 80% of the paracetamol was found to have about two thirds of the bitterness of the 100% control.  The bitterness is not directly proportional to the amount of paracetamol since the formulation already contains sodium citrate which acts to reduce some of the bitterness of the paracetamol.  It is only when the amount of paracetamol exceeds the inhibiting capacity of the sodium citrate that bitterness is perceived.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
To the formulation of Control Example 1 having a total<br>
volume of 4 0ml and containing 100% paracetamol were added various amounts of gingerin, ginger oil and soluble starch. The compositions were evaluated for bitterness masking using the scale defined in Control Example 1.<br><br><br><br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2<br>
To the formulation of Control Example 1 having a total volume of 4 0ml and containing 100% paracetamol were added various amounts of magnesium glucomate, Talin (Thaumatin), sucrose ester, glycine and sodium chloride.  The compositions were evaluated for bitterness masking using the scale defined in Control Example 1.<br><br><br>
&gt; Example 2<br>
To the formulation of Control Example 1 having a total volume of 4 0ml and containing 100% paracetamol were added<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
The best performing blend from Example 2 was found to be:<br>
Ginger oil (0.1% solution}	0.20%<br>
Starch	0.25%<br>
Magnesium gluconate	4.00%<br>
Talin (0.1% solution)	1.25%<br>
This blend was added to aqueous solutions or dispersions of other pharmaceutical compounds known to have a bitter taste, namely Diclofenac (0 . 017%), Naproxen ( 0.167%), and Ketoprofen (0.033%).  These were then assessed for bitterness against the corresponding formulations which did not contain this blend.<br>
There was found to be a marginal decrease in the bitterness of Diclofenac, and no change or even an increase in the bitterness of Naproxen and Ketoprofen.<br>
Example 3<br>
To the formulation of Control Example 1 having a total volume of 40ml and containing 100% paracetamol were individually added the following edible emulsifiers in amounts of O.lg per dose:<br>
Sodium steroyl-1-lactylate HLB10 Sucrose ester HLB 14 Polysrbate 80 HLB 15<br><br><br>
The formulations containing Polysorbate 80 or sucrose ester both had reduced bitterness, but there was no reduction in the bitterness of the formulation containing sodium steroyl-2-actylate, showing that a high HL.B value is necessary for masking the bitterness of paracetamol.<br><br><br>
