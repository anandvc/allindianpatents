				<td>A PROCESS FOR PREPARING AN IMPROVED GELATIN COMPOSITION<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing an improved synergistic composition of gelatin based preparation having resistance to pellicle formation and an improved dissolution, the invention also relates to the composition and its use for obtaining gelatin film, sheets, ribbons, soft and hard gelatin capsules, sugar-coated tablets and any other preparations involving gelatin resistant to pellicle formation.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Gelatin is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry. Unfortunately, it undergoes pellicle formation on storage or on exposure to chemical catalysts. The pellicle formation results in retardation in dissolution behavior in formulations containing gelatin in the outer layer (hard and soft gel capsules and sugar coated tablets) and due to it there is always a risk in marketed preparations failing in the dissolution tests.<br>
To stabilize the gelatin preparations and dosage forms against pellicle formation due to cross linking, there are different approaches: to utilize the fill which is devoid of detrimental cross linking influence on the film; using gelatin which is most resistant to cross linking; and/or using stabilizers in the capsule fill or in the film, thus minimizing the impact of environmental conditions or chemical catalysts especially carbonyl compounds and more specifically formaldehyde, on the dissolution of films, ribbons or sheets, sugar-coated tablets and release of contents from the filled soft or hard gelatin capsules. The present invention relates to the discovery that the pellicle formation in the gelatin preparations is reduced or eliminated by the incorporation of an effective cross linking-reducing amount of a combination of at least one amino acid and at least one carboxylic acid during the preparation of the film mass or solution, instead of incorporation of the same substances in the fill of hard gel capsules, which is a known prior art (Adesunloye and Stach, Drug. Dev. Ind. Pharm. 24(6), 493-500,1998; Adesunloye and Stach, Patent No. WO 9733568).<br><br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of casted gelatin preparation containing synergistic composition of gelatin having resistance to pellicle formation, improved dissolution,<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a gelatin film or any other gelatin preparation that incorporates gelatin in any other form to be used in food and pharmaceutical applications.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a gelatin film with reduced or devoid pellicle formation.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide the use of stabilizer in much less quantities in preparing the gelatin composition.<br>
Another objective of the present invention provides a gelatin film, dissolution of which remains within acceptable limits on exposure to accelerated conditions of temperature, humidity and/or light.<br>
Another objective of the present invention provides a synergistic formulation, which minimizes the interaction of stabilizers with other ingredients used for filling.<br>
Another objective of the present invention provides easy and economical process for the preparation of stable gelatin film.<br>
Another objective of the present invention provides improved dissolution for the gelatin film or any other form of gelatin.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for preparing an improved synergistic composition of gelatin based preparation having resistance to pellicle formation and an improved dissolution, the invention also relates to the composition and its use for obtaining gelatin film, sheets, ribbons, soft and hard gelatin capsules, sugar-coated tablets and any other preparations involving gelatin resistant to pellicle formation.<br>
Particularly this invention relates to a method of reducing pellicle formation in preparations made of gelatin film or those incorporating gelatin in any other form by incorporating an amino acid and a carboxylic acid into the gel mass or gelatin solution during its preparation.<br><br>
The inventive gelatin based preparations possess improved dissolution, relative to those, which do not contain either both or one among the amino acid and the carboxylic acid. The invention applies to all preparations where gelatin is the key or functional component, including films, sheets, ribbons, soft &amp; hard gelatin capsules, and sugarcoated tablets.<br>
LIMITATIONS OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
The prior art of stabilization of gelatin capsules through addition of stabilizers in the fill, however, is associated with several limitations, which are as follows:<br>
i. High concentration of glycine and citric acid is needed to build up the required concentration in the entire fill.<br>
ii. The portion of stabilizers in the fill in immediate contact with the inner surface of the capsules can be said to have a functional role, whereas the remaining portion in the core of the fill is not expected to help in stabilization.<br>
iii. The method cannot be applied to soft gelatin capsules, as both glycine and citric acid are insoluble in non-aqueous solvents and oils, which are used to dispense drugs in soft gel dosage forms. The prior art, therefore, finds major application to hard gelatin capsules only. In reverse, the crosslinking problem is more serious with soft gel capsules and unfortunately no example has been covered in the previous patent (Adesunloye and Stach, Patent No. WO 9733568) on how the prior art applies to filled soft gel capsules and sugar-coated tablets.<br>
iv. Further, the prior art cannot be used to stabilize other presentations of gelatin, like films, sheets and ribbons, where there is no encapsulation and no fill.<br>
v. Another disadvantage of the prior art is that concentration of stabilizers would vary with the type of drug and ingredients enclosed as a fill in the capsules. This is because drugs containing keto or aldehydic groups themselves act as catalysts towards crosslinking. The same is expected of other ingredients that form part of capsule fill. It is expected that the amino acid, which also contain primary amino group, may be neutralized or become less effective in presence of other additives requiring larger quantities of stabilizer combination in the fill.<br><br>

EXAMPLES Example 1 Process for the preparation of gelatin film.<br>
All the materials were weighed according to the formulae in Table 1 and transferred to 1000 ml round bottom flask, which was connected to a rotary film evaporator, with its bath filled with ice. The flask was stirred at a low speed under mild vacuum for 1 h. Chilling facilitated the swelling of gelatin mass and removal of the air bubbles. Subsequently, the ice was removed and the bath was filled with fresh water. The temperature was increased to 75°C and maintained under vacuum for 4 h under constant stirring to facilitate appropriate mixing of the ingredients. The mass thus prepared was transferred to a beaker and kept in a constant water bath at 60°C for 4 h to allow maturation and transfer of entrapped air to the surface. The film casting was done using laboratory coating device on a glass plate. After casting the plate was kept in the refrigerator for 12 h to allow hardening of the film. The hardened film was removed from the plate with the help of a spatula and stored under ambient conditions.<br>

The films prepared according to Example 1 were exposed to formaldehyde vapors in the range of 39p,g to 190u,g in squat bottles for 12 hours. The films were cut into rings of size of 11 rnm i.d. x 14mm o.d. and the dissolution time of the rings was determined in water and also in simulated gastric fluid, described in USP (USP 24/NF 19, United States<br><br>
Pharmacopeia! Convention, Rockville, MD, 1999, p. 2696, Venugopal and Singh. Pharm. Technol, Drug Delivery Supplement, 32-37, 2001). The dissolution studies were done in triplicate.<br>
The films prepared in Example 1 were stored in a photostability chamber controlled at 40°C and 75% relative humidity for 8 days (S. Singh, R. Manikandan, and S. Singh. Pharm. Technol., 24 (5), 58-72, 2000). The films were cut into rings of size of 11 mm i.d. x 14mm o.d and the dissolution time of the rings was determined in water and also in simulated gastric fluid, described in USP (USP 24/NF 19, United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Rockville, MD, 1999, p. 2696).

All the materials were weighed according to the formulae in Table 3 and transferred to 1000 ml round bottom flask, which was connected to a rotary film evaporator, with i:.s bath filled with ice. The flask was stirred at a low speed under mild vacuum for 1 h. Chilling facilitated the swelling of gelatin mass and removal of the air bubbles. Subsequently, the ice was removed and the bath was filled with fresh water. The<br><br>
temperature was increased to 75°C and maintained under vacuum for 4 h under constant stirring to facilitate appropriate mixing of the ingredients. The mass thus prepared was transferred to a beaker and kept in a constant water bath at 60°C for 4 h to allow maturation and transfer of entrapped air to the surface.

(Table Rewmove)The films prepared according to Example 2 were exposed to formaldehyde vapors in the range of 39u,g to 190u,g in squat bottles for 12 hours. The films were cut into rings of size of 11 mm i.d. x 14mm o.d. and the dissolution time of the rings was determined in water and also in simulated gastric fluid, described in USP (USP 24/NF 19, United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Rockville, MD, 1999, p. 2696).

Table 4: Effect of glycine and citric acid on dissolution time (minutes) of gelatin rings<br><br><br><br>
(Table Remove) <br>
(Table Remove)Gelatin films without glycine/citric acid (Table 2) show an increased mean dissolution time as compared to films containing the stabilizers (Table 4). Moreover, the mean dissolution times after exposure are within 30% of initial (without exposure) both in case of stability chamber and formaldehyde exposure at 78 ju,g (Table 4) for Formula E and much lower than the normal acceptable dissolution time of 45 min or even 20 min for some drug preparations.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
i. In the present invention an approach is provided for the stabilization of all kinds of preparations or formulations made out of gelatin film or mass. It is expected to be useful to prevent pellicle formation in gelatin films, sheets, ribbons, sugar-coated tablets and soft as well as hard gelatin capsules.<br>
ii. In the present invention the stabilizer added into the gelatin layer provides the intervention to pellicle formation or cross linking in a more efficient manner.<br>
iii.       In the present invention much lesser quantities of the stabilizer are needed.<br>
iv. In the present invention there is no requirement of differential amounts of stabilizer concentrations, which is the case when the stabilizer is added to the capsule fill. Incorporation of a specific amount of stabilizer in the gelatin layer, as shown above in the examples, takes care of all possible catalytic challenges, whether due to in-situ generated catalyst(s) or an external exposure to chemical catalysts.<br>
v. In the present invention the addition of stabilizers in the gelatin film neutralizes very effectively the pellicle formation and cross linking caused by exposure to accelerated conditions of temperature and/or humidity and/or light. The addition of stabilizers in the fill is not expected to give the same stabilizing effect because<br><br>
influence of environmental factors is an external surface phenomenon, and the same can be better tackled if the stabilizer combination is present in the film itself. vi. In the present invention, the chances of interaction of stabilizers with fill of the Formulations is minimized due to very low concentration of stabilizers and also the same would not happen unless there is leaching of stabilizers from the gelatin film, which is unlikely especially in solid dosage forms<br><br>
