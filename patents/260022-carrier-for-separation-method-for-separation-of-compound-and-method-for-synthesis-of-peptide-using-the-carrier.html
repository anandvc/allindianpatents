CARRIER FOR SEPARATION, METHOD FOR SEPARATION OF COMPOUND, AND<br>
METHOD FOR SYNTHESIS OF PEPTIDE USING THE CARRIER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a carrier for separation<br>
and a method for separating a compound, more specifically a<br>
carrier for separation which has both a property to reversibly<br>
change from a liquid phase state to a solid phase state and<br>
crystallize according to changes in the composition and/or<br>
temperature of the solution, and property to be selectively<br>
extracted in a specific phase and/or selectively crystallized<br>
in a specific phase according to changes in the composition<br>
and/or temperature of the solution, and a method for<br>
separating a compound using the carrier for separation.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Traditionally, in chemical processes, a method of<br>
separating a specific ingredient which has been dissolved in<br>
liquid as a solid has been widely used. This is because the<br>
solidification (crystallization) of only a specific ingredient<br>
enables separation and purification after the reaction..to..be.,<br>
performed readily. This method, for example, in sequential<br>
multi-step syntheses such as compound library synthesis or the<br>
like used in the recent development and research of drugs,<br>
etc. enables the solidified (crystallized) substance to be<br>
easily separated and purified by solidifying (crystallizing) a<br>
necessary or unnecessary compound after the completion of each<br><br>
2<br>
reaction. Therefore, complications in the separation and/or<br>
purification process which have traditionally caused problems<br>
can be resolved.<br>
Furthermore, a method of realizing the separation of a<br>
dissolved specific ingredient from other ingredients is also	.<br>
used by selectively dissolving the specific ingredient in a<br>
specific phase (selective partition) according to the phase<br>
separation of liquid. This method enables a specific<br>
ingredient to be separated without solidification<br>
(crystallization), thereby contributing to expediting and<br>
simplification of the process.<br>
Such a solidification (crystallization) of a specific<br>
ingredient dissolved in solution or a selective dissolution of<br>
a specific ingredient in a specific phase of liquid (selective<br>
partition) can be realized by fulfilling certain conditions<br>
with respect to chemical and physical properties of the<br>
compound and the relationship with a solvent.<br>
However, the conditions of solidification<br>
(crystallization) and selective dissolution (selective<br>
partition) must be empirically searched in most cases by trial<br>
and error. Especially, in sequential multi-step syntheses, it<br>
becomes necessary to examine the conditions of each step based<br>
on the specific property of a compound synthesized in each<br>
step, thereby having required tremendous amounts of money and<br>
time for the process development.<br>
Therefore, there has been proposed a carrier molecule<br>
having a linker capable of sensitively perceiving the<br><br>
3<br>
alteration of a solvent composition so as to reversibly change<br>
the soluble state and insoluble (crystallization) state, or<br>
selectively dissolving a specific dissolved ingredient into a<br>
specific phase in high concentration (selective partition)<br>
with the phase separation of the liquid. Such a carrier -■■-..<br>
molecule can bind various compounds via the linker. Therefore,<br>
the bound compound can easily change states with the carrier<br>
molecule from a soluble state to an insoluble<br>
(crystallization) state or vice versa. Alternatively, the<br>
compound bound to the carrier molecule can be selectively<br>
dissolved in high concentration in a specific phase of liquid<br>
separated into multiphase (selective partition).<br>
Furthermore, even when the chemical structure of a<br>
compound bound to such a carrier by the sequential multi-step<br>
reaction alters, the carrier molecule is capable of reversibly<br>
recreating the soluble state and insoluble (crystallized)<br>
state or dissolving in a specific phase of liquid separated<br>
into multiple phases selectively in high concentration<br>
(selective partition) under approximately the same conditions.<br>
Using such a carrier molecule capable of reversibly<br>
changing the soluble state and insoluble (crystallized) state<br>
or inducing the selective partition state, it is possible to<br>
selectively separate an objective compound for separation from<br>
a homogeneous solution state while utilizing general knowledge<br>
of the liquid phase reaction in organic chemistry. That is, it<br>
has become possible to separate a specific compound after the<br>
liquid phase reaction while leaving other soluble ingredients<br><br>
4<br>
in solution.<br>
Concerning a carrier capable of reversibly repeating the<br>
soluble state and insoluble state, for example, a method of<br>
using a polymer soluble in solvents such as poly(ethylene<br>
glycol) is known (see Non-patent Document 1) .<br>
Non-patent Document 1: "Liquid-phase combinatorial<br>
synthesis" Hyunsoo Han, Mary M. Wolfe, Sydney Brenner, and Kim<br>
D. Janda, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 92, pp. 6419-6423,<br>
July 1995 Chemistry.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
However, when a polymer such as poly(ethylene glycol)<br>
disclosed in Nonpatent Publication 1 is used as a carrier, it<br>
was difficult to evaluate a compound by structural analysis,<br>
etc. due to heterogeneity of the polymer while the compound is<br>
bound to the carrier. Furthermore, there were problems of<br>
complicated handling associated with difficulty in performing<br>
the anhydrous reaction because of the hydrophilicity of<br>
poly(ethylene glycol).<br>
Besides the use of a carrier molecule capable of<br>
reversibly changing the soluble state and insoluble<br>
(crystallized) state or inducing the selective partition<br>
state, various solid phase extraction methods using solid<br>
carrier particles are known as the different separation method<br>
of compound. In the solid phase extraction method, for<br>
example, by specifically binding a ligand molecule having a '<br><br>
5<br>
high affinity to a probe molecule, which has been previously<br>
chemically bound to the surface of solid phase carriers such<br>
as silica gel, porous polymer, alumina and active carbon, the<br>
ligand molecule is separated differentially from other<br>
molecules. By this method, it is easy to perform a process of<br>
separating a substance captured by solid phase from a<br>
substance remaining dissolved in a liquid phase, and<br>
furthermore, it is possible to handle many samples in a short<br>
time and also to obtain reproducible good data without<br>
requiring expert skill, so that the method can be easily<br>
standardized by automated devices, etc.<br>
However, in the solid phase extraction method using solid<br>
carrier particles, molecules other than the molecule<br>
specifically binding to ligand molecule may nonspecifically<br>
adsorb to the solid surface, causing the reduction of<br>
separation accuracy. Furthermore, in order to release the<br>
compound captured to the solid phase carrier surface again, it<br>
was required to perform specific treatments such as chemical<br>
treatment, biochemical treatment, light irradiation and<br>
application of electric stimuli. Therefore, even though it was<br>
easy to capture the objective compound from the liquid phase,<br>
a complicated process must have been further performed in the<br>
step of separating the objective compound from the solid<br>
phase.<br>
The present invention has been performed in view of the<br>
above-described problems, and an objective of this invention<br>
is to provide a carrier for separation and a method for<br><br>
6<br>
separation of a compound that enable a chemical reaction to be<br>
performed in a liquid phase, the specific compound to be<br>
separated from a liquid phase readily after the completion of<br>
the reaction, the separated compound to be evaluated by<br>
-■-- structural analysis or the like while the compound being bound<br>
to the carrier, and furthermore, the compound to be separated<br>
from the carrier readily.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
The present inventors have ardently performed research to<br>
solve the aforementioned problems. As a result, they have<br>
discovered that the abovementioned problems can be solved if a<br>
carrier for separation has a reaction site capable of binding<br>
to other compounds on a benzene ring, and a long-chain group<br>
having a specified number or more of carbon atoms at each of<br>
the ortho-position and the para-position of the reaction site<br>
through an oxygen atom, respectively, thereby achieving the<br>
present invention. More specifically, the present invention<br>
provides the following items.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, a<br>
carrier for separation is represented by the following formula<br>
(1) having a reaction site A capable of binding to another<br>
compound through any one of a carbon atom, oxygen atom, sulfur<br>
atom or an nitrogen atom so as to separate the other compound.<br><br><br>
7<br>
A is a reaction site having one or more atoms selected<br>
from the group consisting of carbon, oxygen, sulfur and<br>
nitrogen atoms; in which<br>
X, Y and Z are each independently selected from any one<br>
of the group consisting of a hydrogen, a halogen, a<br>
hydrocarbon group having a carbon number in the range of 1 to<br>
10 which may have a substituent, an acyl group having a carbon<br>
number in the range of 1 to 10 which may have a substituent,<br>
benzyl group and phenyl group; and<br>
Ri and R2 are groups, which may be identical or different,<br>
containing at least 1 of either a hydrocarbon group having a<br>
carbon number in the range of 14 to 60 which may be<br>
substituted or an acyl group having a carbon number in the<br>
range of 14 to 60 which may be substituted. )<br>
The carrier for separation according to the first aspect<br>
enables a chemical reaction to be performed in a liquid phase,<br>
a specific compound contained in a liquid phase after the<br>
completion of the reaction to be reacted with and bound to the<br>
reaction site A, and other compounds to be selectively<br>
separated from a liquid phase. Thus, the objective compound<br>
can be.efficiently separated in high purity.<br>
Furthermore, since the carrier for separation according<br>
to the first aspect is not a polymer but a simple compound, it<br>
enables the separated compound to be evaluated by structural<br>
analysis or the like, while the compound is bound to the<br>
carrier. Thus, the compound identification or the like can be<br>
performed without performing the separation process, so that<br><br>
8<br>
it is possible to shorten the time required for compound<br>
identification and realize the promotion of research.<br>
Furthermore, the carrier for separation according to the<br>
first aspect enables a compound reacted with and bound to the<br>
reaction -site-A to be separated from the carrier readily.<br>
Thus, the objective compound can be obtained efficiently in a<br>
shorter time compared with the case of performing traditional<br>
complicated processes such as chemical treatment, biochemical<br>
treatment, light irradiation and application of electric<br>
stimuli.<br>
Furthermore, the carrier for separation according to the<br>
first aspect can reversibly recreate the soluble state and<br>
insoluble (crystallized) state or dissolve in a specific phase<br>
of liquid separated into multi-phase selectively in high<br>
concentration under approximately the same conditions, even<br>
when the chemical structure of other compounds bound to the<br>
reaction site A changes by the sequential chemical reactions.<br>
Therefore, it is unnecessary to investigate separation<br>
conditions based on specific characteristics, etc. of<br>
respective compounds.<br>
Furthermore, the carrier for separation according to the<br>
first aspect includes at least of either a hydrocarbon group<br>
having a carbon number in the range of 14 to 60 or an acyl<br>
group having a carbon number in the range of 14 to 60 so as to<br>
contain a long-chain alkyl group. Thus, the carrier for<br>
separation according to the first aspect exhibits<br>
hydrophobicity and can dissolve into many organic solvents in<br><br>
9<br>
high concentration. Therefore, the carrier for separation<br>
according to the first aspect can be widely applied without<br>
selecting the type of liquid into which the objective compound<br>
is dissolved.<br>
The carbon number of the hydrocarbon.group is preferably<br>
in the range of 14 to 50, more preferably in the range of 16<br>
to 40, and most preferably in the range of 18 to 30. The<br>
carbon number of the acyl group is preferably in the range of<br>
14 to 50; more preferably in the range of 16 to 40, and most<br>
preferably in the range of 18 to 30. As long as the carbon<br>
number is within the above-described range, sufficient<br>
hydrophobicity can be exhibited, and the range of choice of<br>
organic solvents is wide.<br>
Furthermore, in the carrier for separation according to<br>
the first aspect, as shown in formula (1), X, Y and Z on the<br>
benzene ring are each independently selected from any one of<br>
the group consisting of a hydrogen, a halogen, a hydrocarbon<br>
group having a carbon number in the range of 1 to 10 which may<br>
have a substituent; an acyl group having a carbon number in<br>
the range of 1 to 10 which may have substituent; a benzyl<br>
group; and a phenyl group. Therefore, the carrier for<br>
separation according to the first aspect will be sufficiently<br>
effective as a carrier for separation even when it remains to<br>
have an unsubstituted hydrogen atom, but can be imparted with<br>
the required characteristics in accordance with the type of<br>
solvents and the type of compounds to be reacted with and<br>
bound thereto, and so on by introducing a halogen, a<br><br>
10<br>
hydrocarbon having a carbon number in the range of 1 to 10<br>
which may have substituent, an acyl group having a carbon<br>
number in the range of 1 to 10 which may have a substituent, a<br>
benzyl group, and phenyl group.<br>
In-the case of a hydrocarbon group which may have a-<br>
substituent, the carbon number is preferably in the range of 1<br>
to 8, and more preferably in the range of 1 to 6. Furthermore,<br>
in the case of an acyl group which may have a substituent, the<br>
carbon number is preferably in the range of 2 to 8, and more<br>
preferably in the range of 2 to 6. If the carbon number is<br>
within the above-described range, the carrier for separation<br>
of the first aspect can exhibit superior solubility toward<br>
many organic solvents.<br>
Since the carrier for separation of the first aspect has<br>
various effects as described above, it not only enables the<br>
process to be developed readily, but also enables, for<br>
example, the research and development of drugs, etc. by the<br>
compound library synthesis or the like to be promoted, so as<br>
to be able to eventually contribute to technical innovation in<br>
the biochemical industry and chemical industry.<br>
-According to a second aspect of the carrier for<br>
separation according to first aspect of the present invention,<br>
the carrier for separation is capable of reversibly changing<br>
from a liquid phase state to a solid phase state, and<br>
crystallizing or solidifying while the carrier being bound<br>
with the other compound according to changes in the<br>
composition and/or temperature of the solution into which the<br><br>
11<br>
carrier for separation dissolves or the liquid phase into<br>
which the carrier for separation melts.<br>
The carrier for separation according to the second aspect<br>
includes one of a hydrocarbon group having a carbon number in<br>
—	 the range of 14 to 60 • and- an acyl group having a carbon number.<br>
in the range of 14 to 60, so as to contain a long-chain alkyl<br>
group. Since a long-chain alkyl group shows hydrophobicity, it<br>
enables the carrier for separation to dissolve in many<br>
solvents and at the same time enables the carrier for<br>
separation to crystallize readily by adding a solvent of high<br>
polarity.<br>
Therefore, the carrier for separation according to the<br>
second aspect enables only the objective specific compound to<br>
be crystallized or solidified accompanied with the carrier,<br>
while ingredients other than the objective compound are left<br>
in a liquid phase by changing the composition and/or<br>
temperature of the solution into which the carrier dissolves<br>
or the liquid phase into which the carrier melts. The carrier<br>
for separation accompanied with another compound, either<br>
crystallized or solidified, can be easily separated from the<br>
liquid phase by filtration and so on, etc., so that a complex<br>
excision process can be avoided.<br>
The carrier for separation according to the second aspect<br>
enables the objective compound to be evaluated by structural<br>
analysis or the like without separating the objective compound<br>
from the carrier while the compound is bound to the carrier.<br>
Therefore, evaluation of a compound by structural analysis or<br><br>
12<br>
the like can be performed without going through the process of<br>
separating the compound from the carrier, so that in the<br>
research and development scene, the time required can be<br>
shortened so as to realize promotion thereof.<br>
According to a. third aspect of the carrier for separation	<br>
according to the first aspect, the carrier for separation is<br>
selectively extracted and/or selectively crystallized in a<br>
specific phase according to changes in the composition and/or<br>
temperature of a solution into which the carrier for<br>
separation dissolves, while the carrier is bound to the other<br>
compound,.<br>
The carrier for separation according to the third aspect<br>
is a carrier which enables the carrier to be selectively<br>
extracted (as a liquid) and/or selectively crystallized in a<br>
specific phase of multiple phases after binding the objective<br>
compound to the carrier while the compound is bound thereto.<br>
Thus, only the objective specific compound can be separated<br>
while ingredients soluble in another liquid phase than that of<br>
the objective compound are left in the other liquid phase, so<br>
that the complex excision process can be avoided.<br>
When the carrier for separation according to the third<br>
aspect is one selectively crystallized in a specific phase, it<br>
enables the structural analysis and so on, etc. to be<br>
performed as it is without separating the objective compound<br>
from the carrier so as to have the same effect as that of the<br>
above-described carrier of according to the second aspect.<br>
In a fourth aspect of the carrier for separation<br><br>
13<br>
according to the first aspect, the carrier for separation is<br>
capable of reversibly changing from a liquid phase state to a<br>
solid phase state according to changes in the composition<br>
and/or temperature of the solution in which the carrier for<br>
separation dissolves or the liquid phase in which the carrier .....<br>
for separation melts, and binding with the other compound in a<br>
solid phase state.<br>
The carrier for separation according to the fourth aspect<br>
is one which reversibly changes from a liquid state to a solid<br>
state according to changes in the composition and/or<br>
temperature of solution before binding another compound,<br>
subsequently capturing the other compound by binding it to the<br>
carrier for separation which has transformed to the solid<br>
phase state so as to perform the so-called solid phase<br>
extraction.<br>
Due to the solid state extraction, the carrier for<br>
separation according to the fourth aspect enables the process<br>
of separating the solid phase carrier which has captured a<br>
compound by binding thereto from the liquid phase to be<br>
readily performed, and subsequently enables the process for<br>
... separating the compound from the..carrier, to. be. also..simply<br>
carried out.<br>
In a fifth aspect of the present invention, a method for<br>
separation of a compound includes a dissolution process of<br>
dissolving the carrier for separation according to the first<br>
aspect in a soluble solvent to prepare a carrier solution; a<br>
first binding process of binding another compound to the<br><br>
14<br>
reaction site A of the carrier for separation; a<br>
crystallization process of crystallizing the carrier for<br>
separation while the other compound is bound to the carrier;<br>
or a selection process of selectively extracting and/or<br>
selectively crystallizing the carrier for separation into a<br>
specific phase while the other compound is bound to the<br>
carrier.<br>
The method of separating a compound according to the<br>
fifth aspect is a separation method of performing<br>
crystallization or extraction after binding the objective<br>
compound to a carrier using the carrier for separation of the<br>
present invention. The method of separating a compound<br>
according to the fifth aspect includes both a case of<br>
solidifying (crystallizing) the carrier in a single liquid<br>
phase, while the compound is bound to the carrier, and a case<br>
of selectively extracting (as a liquid) and/or selectively<br>
crystallizing the carrier into a specific phase among multiple<br>
liquid phases while the compound is bound thereto.<br>
The method of separating a compound according to the<br>
fifth aspect enables the specific compound to be selectively<br>
..crystallized .or..extracted. Therefore, only the specific<br>
objective compound can be separated while ingredient(s)<br>
soluble in the liquid phase other than the objective compound<br>
is/are left in the liquid phase, thereby avoiding complex<br>
separation processes.<br>
Furthermore, when the carrier is separated by<br>
crystallization by way of the separation method according to<br><br>
15<br>
the fifth aspect while the carrier is accompanied with the<br>
objective compound, structural analysis, etc. can be performed<br>
as it is without separating the objective compound from the<br>
carrier. Therefore, confirmation, etc. of the obtained<br>
compound can be performed without passing through the process<br>
of separating the compound after crystallization, so that in<br>
the research and development scene, the time required can be<br>
shortened so as to realize the promotion of research.<br>
Therefore, the method of separating compound according to<br>
the fifth aspect is able to become an innovative technique in<br>
the separation and purification of biochemical substances, the<br>
search for drug candidate substances, and the constitution of<br>
novel chemical synthetic reaction methods and peptide<br>
continuous synthesis method, etc.<br>
In a sixth aspect of the present invention, a method of<br>
separating a compound including a melting process of<br>
liquidizing the carrier for separation according to the first<br>
aspect by heating above the melting point thereof; a reaction<br>
process of binding another compound to the reaction site A of<br>
the liquidized carrier for separation by reacting therewith;<br>
and a solidification process of solidifying the carrier for	<br>
separation while the other compound is bound thereto.<br>
The method of separating a compound according to the<br>
sixth aspect is a separation method of liquidizing the carrier<br>
for separation itself of the present invention without using<br>
any solvent, and solidifying the carrier after binding the<br>
objective compound to the liquidized carrier for separation.<br><br>
16<br>
The method of separating a compound according to the<br>
sixth aspect enables the specific compound to be selectively<br>
bound thereto and separated therefrom. Since, in the method of<br>
separating a compound according to the sixth aspect, the<br>
carrier for separation is in a solid phase (solidified), only<br>

liquid phase, the reaction efficiency and volumetric<br>
efficiency are extremely high, so that even oligopeptides, the<br>
synthesis of which by the solid phase reaction method is<br>
difficult, can be synthesized. Furthermore, the carrier for<br>
separation in the state bound to oligopeptide contained in the<br>
liquid phase after the completion of reaction can be<br><br>

to bind to an amino acid. Thus, this carrier for separation<br>
can sequentially bind a plurality of amino acids via the<br>
atomic group A so as to synthesize oligopeptide. Furthermore,<br>
since the bond between this atomic group A and the<br>
oligopeptide is relatively easily cleaved, a solid phase<br>
reagent can be used when the oligopeptide is excised from the<br>
carrier for separation.<br>
This amino acid may be an amino acid having no protective<br>
group, or may be a protected amino acid having protective<br>
groups such as a Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) group and<br>
Cbz (benzyloxycarbonyl) group. Therefore, synthesized<br>
oligopeptides include, besides unmodified oligopeptides,<br><br>
26<br>
modified oligopeptides having the protective group of an amino<br>
acid side chain residue, amino protective group of terminal<br>
amino acid, and carboxyl protective group.<br>

(in the formula,<br>
A is a reaction site having more than 1 atom selected<br>

carbon number in the range of 14 to 60 which may be<br>
substituted or an acyl group having a carbon number in the<br>

Reaction site A<br>
The reaction site A to bind to other compound on the<br>
carrier for separation of the present invention includes at<br>
least one atom selected from the group consisting of a carbon<br>
atom, oxygen atom, sulfur atom and nitrogen atom, and may<br>

The size of the reaction site A is not particularly<br>
limited, and may be sufficient as long as the reaction site A,<br>
in its part, has a portion serving as a reaction site capable<br>
of binding to other compound. Furthermore, although the<br>
position in which the reaction site to bind to other compound<br>
is present in the reaction site A is not particularly limited,<br>
it is preferably present at the terminal end of the reaction<br>
site A to make the reaction proceed readily.<br>
The reaction site A binds to other compound through any<br>
one selected from the group consisting of a carbon atom,<br>

like becomes easy.<br>
The carrier for separation of the present invention is of<br>
a structure having long-chain groups Ri and R2 of more than a<br>

Furthermore, when the atomic group A has a reactive site<br>
to bind with the amino acid, Ri and R2, which may be the same<br>
or different, are groups containing more than 1 of either<br>
hydrocarbon group having a carbon number in the range of 14 to<br>
30 or an acyl group having a carbon number in the range of 14<br>
to 30. The carbon number of the hydrocarbon group is more<br>
preferably in the range of 18 to 22. The carbon number of the<br><br>
34<br>
acyl group is more preferably in the range of 18 to 22.<br>

present invention is not particularly limited. For example, a<br>
method is cited in which after a 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde<br>
derivative and alkyl bromide are heated in the presence of<br>
basic catalysts such as potassium carbonate to obtain an<br>
alkyletherified benzaldhyde derivative, the aldehyde is<br>
dissolved in a suitable solvent and reduced using reducing<br>

carrier is dissolved or a liquid phase in which the carrier<br>
melts so as to also have properties to bind to other compound<br>
after becoming a solid phase state.<br>
Method of Separating Compound<br>
Methods of separating a compound of the present invention<br>
include the following three methods:- (1) -a method of<br><br>
36<br>
performing crystallization and/or extraction after dissolving<br>
the carrier for separation of the present invention in a<br>
soluble solvent, and binding the objective specific compound<br>
to the carrier for separation; (2) a method in which, after<br>
melting the carrier, for separation of the present invention<br>
itself to a liquid phase and binding the objective specific<br>
compound to the carrier in a liquid phase, the carrier for<br>
separation bound to the compound is solidified; and (3) a<br>
method in which, after dissolving the carrier for separation<br>
of the present invention in a soluble solvent and subsequently<br>
crystallizing (solidifying) it, the objective specific<br>
compound is captured by binding to the crystallized carrier.<br>
Hereinafter, each method is separately explained.<br>
(1) (i) Method of performing crystallization and/or extraction<br>
after dissolving the carrier for separation of the present<br>
invention in a soluble solvent and binding the objective<br>
specific compound to the carrier for separation<br>
The method of separating a compound, in which the carrier<br>
for separation of the present invention is dissolved in a<br>
soluble solvent and first the objective compound is bound to<br>
the carrier for separation, includes: a dissolving process of<br>
dissolving the carrier for separation of the present invention<br>
in a soluble solvent to prepare a carrier solution; a first<br>
binding process of binding other compound to the reaction site<br>
A of the carrier for separation; a crystallization process of<br>
crystallizing the carrier bound to the other compound or a<br>
selection process of selectively-extracting and/or selectively<br><br>
37<br>
crystallizing the carrier for separation in a specific phase<br>
while the other compound being bound thereto.<br>
Dissolution Process<br>
The dissolution process of the present separation method<br>
is a process of dissolving the,carrier for separation of the...<br>
present invention in a soluble solvent to prepare a carrier<br>
solution. Soluble solvents used in the dissolution process are<br>
not particularly limited as long as they are capable of<br>
dissolving the carrier for separation of the present<br>
invention. For example, a halogenated hydrocarbon, linear<br>
ether, cyclic ether, cyclic or linear hydrocarbon having a<br>
number of carbon atoms in the range of 4 to 40 can be<br>
exemplified. More specifically, for example, dichloromethane,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, decalin, etc.<br>
can be exemplified. These solvents may be used by mixing one<br>
or more than 2 types thereof.<br>
Although the concentration of the carrier for separation<br>
of the present invention when dissolving it in a soluble<br>
solvent can be appropriately selected according to the<br>
properties of the solvent to be used, a carrier for separation<br>
and a compound to be bound to the crystallized carrier for<br>
separation, it is usually in the range of 0.01 to 0.5 g/ml.<br>
First Binding Process<br>
The binding process in the present separation method is a<br>
process of obtaining a complex compound of the carrier for<br>
separation and other compound by binding the other compound to<br>
the reaction site A of the carrier for separation. Binding<br><br>
38<br>
methods in the binding process are not particularly limited so<br>
far as they are methods of binding the other compound having a<br>
portion capable of reacting with the reaction site A to the<br>
reaction site A of the carrier for separation dissolved in a<br>
soluble solvent in the previous process, so that various<br>
chemical reactions in liquid phase can be used. For example,<br>
methods of binding by forming the ester bond and amide bond<br>
can be exemplified.<br>
Second Binding Process<br>
The present separation method may be a method including,<br>
after the above-described first binding process, a second<br>
binding process to further bind another compound to the other<br>
compound which has been bound to the reaction site A of the<br>
carrier for separation. In the present separation method, it<br>
is possible to bind a plurality of other compounds<br>
sequentially by chemical reactions to the reaction site A as a<br>
point of origin.<br>
Compounds used when performing the sequential chemical<br>
reactions are not particularly limited so far as they are<br>
compounds capable of reacting with and binding to the compound<br>
which has been already bound to the reaction site A of the<br>
carrier for separation as a point of origin. Furthermore, the<br>
sequential chemical reactions may be performed in the same<br>
liquid phase containing the carrier for separation which has<br>
already become a complex compound with other compounds or in a<br>
different liquid phase after once solidifying (crystallizing)<br>
to separate the carrier for separation which has become a<br><br>
39<br>
complex compound.<br>
Impurity Eliminating Process<br>
In the present separation method, it is preferable to<br>
include an impurity elimination process for eliminating<br>
-- impurities before performing the following crystallization<br>
process or selection process. In the following crystallization<br>
process or selection process, impurities contained in solution<br>
may be sometimes crystallized or extracted together with the<br>
carrier. Especially, when a means of distilling off all<br>
solvents is used as a crystallization process, impurities are<br>
precipitated together with crystals of the carrier for<br>
separation bound to the compound as the crystallization<br>
objective. Therefore, by previously eliminating impurities<br>
before performing the crystallization process or selection<br>
process, it is possible to raise the purity of the<br>
subsequently obtained crystals of the carrier for separation<br>
bound with the compound as the separation objective.<br>
Although methods of eliminating impurities are not<br>
particularly limited, for example, a method of washing a whole<br>
solution in which a complex compound of the compound as a<br>
separation objective and the carrier for separation is<br>
dissolved with a solvent can be exemplified.<br>
Crystallization Process<br>
The crystallization process in the present separation<br>
method is a process of crystallizing a compound bound to the<br>
carrier for separation in a first binding process, a previous<br>
process, or further in'a second binding process while the	<br><br>
40<br>
compound is accompanied with the carrier for separation.<br>
Although the crystallization process of the present separation<br>
method is not particularly limited, so far as it enables the<br>
crystallization of the compound as a separation objective<br>
while the compound is-bound to the carrier for separation, for...<br>
example, a means of changing the solution composition and/or<br>
the solution temperature can be preferably used.<br>
Selection Process<br>
The selection process of the present separation method is<br>
a process of selectively extracting (as a liquid) or<br>
selectively crystallizing a compound bound to the carrier for<br>
separation in a first binding process, a previous process, or<br>
further in a second binding process in a specific liquid phase<br>
while the compound is accompanied with the carrier. That is,<br>
in the separation method including the selection process, the<br>
liquid phase is in a state of multi-phase including more than<br>
two phases, so that the carrier for separation accompanied by<br>
a compound is selectively extracted (as a liquid) and/or<br>
crystallized in a specific liquid phase of multiple phases.<br>
Although the selection process in the present separation<br>
method is not particularly limited, so far as the selection<br>
process enables a specific compound, which becomes a<br>
separation objective, to be extracted and/or crystallized<br>
while the compound is bound to the carrier for separation, for<br>
example, a means of changing the solution composition and/or a<br>
means of changing the solution temperature can be preferably<br>
used.		<br><br>
41<br>
Means of Changing Composition<br>
A means of changing the solution composition preferably<br>
used in the crystallization process or selection process of<br>
the present separation method is not particularly limited so<br>
far as it enables the composition of the solution in which a<br>
complex of the compound as a separation objective and the<br>
carrier for separation is dissolved to be altered.<br>
In the present separation method, as a preferable means<br>
of changing the solution composition, for example, a means of<br>
further adding a solvent having a high affinity toward the<br>
soluble solvent used to dissolve the carrier for separation in<br>
the dissolution process is exemplified. When adding a solvent<br>
having a high affinity toward the soluble solvent, a liquid<br>
phase is maintained as a single phase without causing phase<br>
separation.<br>
A high-affinity solvent may be the same as or different<br>
from the solvent used as a soluble solvent. For example, when<br>
dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, etc. is used as the soluble<br>
solvent, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, methanol, etc. can<br>
be used.<br>
In the present separation method, as another preferable<br>
means of changing the solution composition, for example, a<br>
means of further adding a solvent having a low affinity toward<br>
the soluble solvent used to dissolve the carrier for<br>
separation in the dissolution process can be exemplified. When<br>
adding a solvent having low affinity toward the soluble<br>
solvent, the liquid causes phase separation into-a double<br><br>
42<br>
phase. Thereby, the carrier for separation itself or the<br>
carrier for separation bound with a compound is transferred<br>
selectively to a specific phase.<br>
For example, by dissolving the carrier for separation in<br>
cyclohexane, dissolving other compound and the other arbitrary<br>
reaction reagent or the like in dimethylformamide, and mixing<br>
the two solutions, and subsequently, after passing through a<br>
first binding process or furthermore a second binding process,<br>
by adding a small amount of an aqueous solution of propylene<br>
carbonate and ammonium salt corresponding to a low affinity<br>
solvent, the carrier for separation bound with the other<br>
compound can be selectively dissolved in the cyclohexane<br>
phase.<br>
Furthermore, as yet another preferable means of changing<br>
the solution composition, for example, a means of<br>
concentrating the solvent of a solution, in which the complex<br>
compound of the compound as a separation objective and the<br>
carrier for separation is dissolved, is exemplified. Herein,<br>
concentration refers to partial or complete distillation of<br>
the solvent. In addition, when the carrier for separation<br>
bound with a compound is crystallized by the complete<br>
distillation of the solvent, impurities and so on contained in<br>
the solution may be crystallized together, so that it is<br>
preferable to include a process of eliminating impurities<br>
before performing the crystallization process.<br>
Means of Changing Temperature<br>
A means of changing solution temperature preferably used<br><br>
43<br>
in the crystallization process or selection process of the<br>
present separation method is not particularly limited so far<br>
as they are means capable of changing the temperature of the<br>
solution in which the complex compound of the compound to be<br>
.the separation objective and the carrier for separation is<br>
dissolved. In the present separation method, for example, a<br>
means of cooling the solution can be exemplified. For example,<br>
when cyclohexane is used as a soluble solvent to dissolve the<br>
carrier for separation, the complex compound can be<br>
crystallized by cooling the solution to 5°C. In addition, when<br>
a means of cooling the solvent is used as a means of changing<br>
the solution temperature, it becomes possible to facilitate<br>
the crystal growth by adding crystallization nuclei such as<br>
ODS particles (silica gel to the surface of which octadecyl<br>
group being bound) and glass beads.<br>
Excision Process<br>
In the method of separating a compound of the present<br>
invention, it is preferable to include a process of separating<br>
the complex compound of a compound to be the separation<br>
objective and the carrier for separation obtained in the<br>
crystallization process or the selection process into the<br>
compound and the carrier for separation.<br>
Methods for separation into the compound and carrier for<br>
separation are not particularly limited so far as they are<br>
capable of cleaving the bond between the compound and the<br>
carrier for separation. For example, when a para-alkoxybenzyl<br>
bond is formed, it is possible to cleave the bond by the acid<br><br>
44<br>
treatment.<br>
(1) (ii) A method of performing crystallization and/or<br>
extraction after dissolving the carrier for separation of the<br>
present invention in a soluble solvent and sequentially<br>
binding amino acids to the carrier.<br>
The method for separation of a compound of the present<br>
invention can be utilized as a synthesis method of a peptide<br>
using amino acids as the other compound.<br>
The oligopeptide synthesis method of the present<br>
invention is a method including a dissolution process of<br>
dissolving the carrier for separation of the present invention<br>
in a soluble solvent to prepare a carrier solution; a binding<br>
process of obtaining the carrier for separation bound with an<br>
oligopeptide by binding an amino acid to the atomic group A of<br>
the carrier for separation, and sequentially binding other<br>
amino acids to the amino acid which has been bound to the<br>
carrier for separation; a crystallization process of<br>
crystallizing the carrier for separation while the<br>
oligopeptide is bound to the carrier for separation or a<br>
selection process of selectively extracting and/or selectively<br>
crystallizing the carrier for separation in a specific phase<br>
while the oligopeptide is bound to the carrier for separation;<br>
and an excision process of excising the oligopeptide from the<br>
carrier for separation bound with the oligopeptide after the<br>
crystallization process or the selection process.<br>
Except that amino acids as other compounds are<br>
sequentially bound to the carrier for separation"so as to make<br><br>
45<br>
the carrier for separation to hold a peptide, the present<br>
method is common to the method (1) (i), in which<br>
crystallization and/or extraction are performed after the<br>
carrier for separation of the present invention is dissolved<br>
in a soluble solvent and the objective specific compound is<br>
bound to the carrier for separation, with respect of the<br>
dissolution process, impurity elimination process, and<br>
selection process (a means of changing the solution<br>
composition, a means of changing the solution temperature).<br>
Regarding the processes, see the above descriptions.<br>
Binding Process<br>
In the binding process, after binding an amino acid to<br>
the atomic group A which is the reaction site of the carrier<br>
for separation to obtain a complex compound of the amino acid<br>
and the carrier for separation, other amino acids are<br>
sequentially bound to the amino acid which has been bound to<br>
the atomic group A so as to obtain a complex compound of<br>
oligopeptide and the carrier for separation. That is, in the<br>
binding process, a plurality of amino acids are sequentially<br>
bound in a desired order with the atomic group A as a point of<br>
origin to obtain a complex compound of oligopeptide and the<br>
carrier for separation. The sequential binding may be<br>
performed in the same liquid phase containing the carrier for<br>
separation which has become a complex compound with the amino<br>
acid or oligopeptide, or in a different liquid phase once<br>
after the carrier for separation which has become a complex<br>
compound is solidified (crystallized) and separated.<br><br>
46<br>
Although the amino acids to be bound in this binding<br>
process are not particularly limited, protected amino acids<br>
used in the conventional solid phase reaction method such as<br>
Fmoc-amino acids and Cbz-amino acids can be used. Furthermore,<br>
- the number of. amino acids, to ba. bound, to the carrier for<br>
separation is not particularly limited, but preferably is in<br>
the range of 2 to 5.<br>
Crystallization Process<br>
In the crystallization process, the oligopeptide which<br>
has been bound to the carrier for separation in the previous<br>
binding process is crystallized while the oligopeptide is<br>
accompanied by the carrier for separation. In this<br>
crystallization process, any means may be used as far as the<br>
carrier for separation can be crystallized while the carrier<br>
for separation is bound with oligopeptide such as, for<br>
example, a means of changing the solution composition and/or a<br>
means of changing the solution temperature can be preferably<br>
used. In addition, when crystallization is performed after<br>
deprotecting the amino acid, it is possible to make the<br>
complex compound to crystallize easily by adding a weak acid<br>
such as formic acid to form the salt.<br>
Excision Process<br>
In the excision process, the oligopeptide is excised from<br>
a complex compound of oligopeptide with the carrier for<br>
separation obtained in the crystallization process or<br>
selection process. In the excision process, although a soluble<br>
reagent such as trifluoroacetic acid may be used;- it is not<br><br>
47<br>
easy to separate the acid from the excised oligopeptide, so<br>
that a solid phase reagent is preferably used. Solid phase<br>
reagents used in the excision process are not particularly<br>
limited so far as they are capable of excising oligopeptide<br>
from the complex compound, so that, for example, a solid acid,<br>
solid base and solid reducing agent can be used. Among them,<br>
as the solid acid reagent, for example, an acidic ion-exchange<br>
resin, acidic metal oxide, acidic combined metal oxide, metal<br>
sulfate, metal phosphate, crystalline metalosilicate, zeolite,<br>
silica alumina, etc. can be exemplified. More specifically,<br>
for example, a zeolite catalyst and montmorillonite can be<br>
exemplified.<br>
(2) Method of solidifying the carrier for separation of the<br>
present invention after melting the carrier for separation<br>
itself to a liquid phase and binding a specific objective<br>
compound thereto in a liquid phase<br>
The separation method in which the carrier for separation<br>
itself of the present invention is melted to a liquid phase<br>
and reacted with a specific compound in the liquid phase<br>
includes a melting process of heating the carrier for<br>
separation of the present invention above the melting point to<br>
melt it to a liquid phase; a reaction process of reacting<br>
other compound with the reaction site A of the melted carrier<br>
for separation so as to bind the compound thereto; and a<br>
solidification process of solidifying the carrier for<br>
separation while the other compound is bound thereto.<br>
Melting Process	^ - ■<br><br>
48<br>
The melting process in the present separation method is<br>
not particularly limited so far as it is a process of heating<br>
the carrier for separation above the melting point to melt the<br>
carrier itself to a liquid phase.<br>
Reaction Process ................<br>
The reaction process in the present separation method is<br>
a method of binding other compound to the reaction site A of<br>
the carrier for separation to obtain the complex compound of<br>
the carrier for separation and the other compound. The binding<br>
method in the reaction process is not particularly limited so<br>
far as it is a method of binding the other compound having a<br>
part capable of reacting with the reaction site A of the<br>
carrier for separation which has been fluidized in the<br>
previous process, so that, similar to the above-described<br>
first binding process, various chemical reactions in a liquid<br>
phase can be used. For example, a method of binding by forming<br>
the ester bond and amide bond can be exemplified. Also in the<br>
reaction process, for the purpose of maintaining the liquid<br>
phase, it is preferable to maintain the reaction temperature<br>
higher than the melting point of the carrier for separation.<br>
Second Binding Process<br>
The present separation process may include, after the<br>
above-described reaction process, a second binding process of<br>
further binding another compound to the other compound which<br>
has been bound to the reaction site A of the carrier for<br>
separation. The second binding process can be performed under<br>
similar conditions as those of the above-described second<br><br>
49<br>
binding process.<br>
Impurity Eliminating Process<br>
Furthermore, in the present separation method, it is<br>
preferable to include an impurity eliminating process for<br>
eliminating impurities before performing the.following<br>
solidification process similar to the above-described<br>
separation method.<br>
Solidification Process<br>
The solidification process in the present separation<br>
method is process in which after implementing the reaction<br>
process or furthermore a second binding process to the melted<br>
and fluidized carrier for separation to bind the other<br>
compound, etc., the carrier for separation is solidified to a<br>
solid phase while these compounds are bound to the carrier for<br>
separation. Although the method of solid phase transition in<br>
the solidification process is not particularly limited, it is<br>
preferable to perform the solid phase transition by a means of<br>
adding a poor solvent, in which the solubility of the complex<br>
compound of a compound to be the separation objective and the<br>
carrier for separation is low, to the complex compound because<br>
of easy operation.<br>
Washing Process<br>
Although, in the present separation method, separation of<br>
the objective specific compound is completed by a solid phase<br>
obtained in the above-described solidification process, a<br>
washing process may be arbitrarily implemented. The washing<br>
" process is a process' of washing the solid carrier for<br><br>
50<br>
separation bound to the other compound with a poor solvent in<br>
which the solubility of this solid is low.<br>
Impurity Elimination Process<br>
In the present separation method, it is preferable to<br>
further include.the.impurity elimination process to eliminate<br>
impurities before performing the following extraction process<br>
similar to the above-described separation method.<br>
Extraction Process<br>
In the present separation method, it is preferable to<br>
include an extraction process of selectively extracting the<br>
complex compound of a compound to be the separation objective<br>
and the carrier for separation into a specific solvent after<br>
the abovementioned solidification process or washing process.<br>
Although the extraction process is not particularly limited,<br>
it is preferable to perform the extraction process by a means<br>
of adding a solvent capable of dissolving the complex compound<br>
of a compound to be the separation objective and the carrier<br>
for separation.<br>
Excision Process<br>
Furthermore, in the present separation method, it is<br>
preferable to include a process to separate the complex<br>
compound of a compound to be the separation objective and the<br>
carrier for separation into the compound and the carrier for<br>
separation after the above-described solidification process or<br>
extraction process, similar to the aforementioned separation<br>
method. When ending the operation with the solidification<br>
process, the excision process may be included after the<br><br>
51<br>
solidification process, and when implementing procedures up to<br>
the extraction process, the excision process may be included<br>
after the extraction process.<br>
(3) Method of binding and capturing the objective specific<br>
compound (with the carrier for separation) after dissolving<br>
the carrier for separation of the present invention in a<br>
soluble solvent and subsequently crystallizing (solidifying)<br>
the same<br>
The method for separation of a compound in which the<br>
carrier for separation of the present invention is dissolved<br>
in a soluble solvent and subsequently crystallized<br>
(solidified) before binding the objective compound to the<br>
carrier for separation includes: a dissolution process of<br>
dissolving the carrier for separation of the present invention<br>
in a soluble solvent to prepare a carrier solution; a<br>
crystallization process of crystallizing the carrier for<br>
separation; and a capturing process of capturing other<br>
compound by binding the other compound to the reaction site A<br>

The dissolution process in the present separation method<br>
can be performed by the same procedure as in the above-<br>
described dissolution process.<br>
Crystallization Process<br>
The crystallization process in the present separation<br>
method is a process of crystallizing (solidifying) the carrier<br>
for separation' itself. Although the crystallization process in<br><br>
52<br>
the present separation method is not particularly limited, so<br>
far as it is capable of crystallizing (solidifying) the<br>
carrier for separation, for example, a means of changing the<br>
composition of a solution in which the carrier for separation<br>
itself is dissolved and/or a means of changing the temperature<br>
of a solution in which the carrier for separation itself is<br>
dissolved can be preferably used.<br>
Impurity Eliminating Process<br>
Furthermore, in the present separation method, it is<br>
preferable to include an impurity eliminating process before<br>
implementing the following capturing process, similar to the<br>
above-described separation method.<br>
Capturing Process<br>
The capturing process in the present separation method is<br>
a process of binding a specific other compound having a part<br>
reactive to the reaction site A of the carrier for separation,<br>
which has been crystallized (solidified) in the previous<br>
process, to the reaction site A so as to obtain the complex<br>
compound of the carrier for separation and the other compound.<br>
The capturing process in the present separation method is not<br>
particularly limited, so far as it is a process (method) of<br>
binding the reaction site A and a specific other compound. For<br>
example, amide binding and ester binding can be exemplified.<br>
Excision Process<br>
Furthermore, in the present separation method, similar to<br>
the above-described separation method, it is preferable to<br>
include a process of separating the complex compound of a<br><br>
53<br>
compound to be the separation objective and the carrier for<br>
separation obtained in the capturing process into the compound<br>
and the carrier for separation.<br>
.EXAMPLES		<br>
Next, the present invention is further described in<br>
detail with reference to Examples, but it is not to be<br>
construed as being limited thereto.<br>
Example 1<br>
Synthesis of Carrier for Separation<br>
Hereinafter, a synthesis process chart of the carrier for<br>
separation of the present invention (compounds 2 and 5 in the<br>
figure) is shown. Numerals in the figures represent the<br>
compound numbers.<br><br>
Synthesis of 2,4-bisoctadecyloxyphenylmethanol (Compound 2)<br>
After 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (compound 1) (1 g (0.0072<br>
mol)) and octadecyl bromide (4.82 g (0.0145 mol)) were<br>
dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) (20 ml), potassium<br>
carbonate (5 g (0.0372 mol)) was added, and the resulting<br>
mixture was stirred under a- nitrogen atmosphere at 100°C- for 6 -<br><br>
54<br>
hours. The reaction liquid thus obtained was extracted with<br>
hexane (3 x 100 ml), and subsequently this hexane solution was<br>
concentrated under vacuum. Methanol (MeOH) (200 ml) was added<br>
to the residue, and crystals thus produced were separated by<br>
	 filtration. After crystals thus obtained were dissolved in<br>
tetrahydrofuran (THF) (80 ml) and methanol (MeOH) (30 ml),<br>
sodium borohydride (0.7 g (0.0184 mol)) was added to the<br>
solution under stirring in an ice bath, and after stirring<br>
further for 1 hour, acetone (20 ml) was added to the mixture<br>
to terminate the reaction. Subsequently, after concentration<br>
under vacuum, water (50 ml) was added to the residue. The<br>
reaction solution thus obtained was extracted with hexane (3 x<br>
100 ml), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the<br>
solvent was distilled off under vacuum. Furthermore, methanol<br>
(MeOH) (200 ml) was added to the residue, and crystals thus<br>
produced were separated by filtration to obtain the objective<br>
compound 2 (2,4-bisoctadecyloxyphenylmetanol). The yield was<br>
71%.<br>

temperature, it formed a two-layer solution, so that the upper<br>
layer solution containing Kb-Leu-Leu-Gly-Fmoc was recovered.<br>
After distilling off the solvent of this upper layer solution<br>
under vacuum slowly, methanol (300 ml) was added. Crystals<br>
thus obtained were filtered with a Kiriyama funnel to recover<br>
the objective compound Kb-Leu-Leu-Gly-Fmoc. The yield was 48%.<br>

As can be clearly seen from Example 8, the use of a<br>
carrier for separation represented by the above-described<br>
formula (2) enables Fmoc-tripeptide to be efficiently<br>
synthesized on the carrier for separation, and enables the<br>
carrier for separation bound to Fmoc-tripeptide to be<br>
separated. Especially, this Fmoc-tripeptide contains a Leu-Leu<br>
bond so as to be difficult to be synthesized by the solid<br>
phase reaction method. It is also possible to excise Fmoc-<br>
tripeptide from the carrier for separation by the treatment<br>
with a solid phase reagent.<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
Excision of Fmoc-dipeptide Bound to Another Carrier for<br>
Separation by Solid Phase Reagent<br>
3,4,5-Tris-octadecyloxybenzyl alcohol represented by the<br>
following formula (3) (hereinafter abbreviated as "Ka") was<br>
used as a carrier for separation to recover Ka-Gly-Ala-Fmoc<br>
similarly as in Example 1. To a solution of Ka-Gly-Ala-Fmoc<br>
(1160 mg (0.92 mmol)) dissolved in dichloromethane (25 ml) was<br>
added a solid acid reagent, (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., trade name:<br>
Montmorillonite K10) (1000 mg), and the mixture was stirred to<br><br>
71<br>
react at room temperature for 3.5 hours. After the reaction,<br>
methanol (60 ml) was added, and the solvent was distilled off<br>
slowly under vacuum. The obtained crystals and the solid acid<br>
reagent were filtered with a Kiriyama funnel to recover the<br>
filtrate. - Although the solvent of this filtrate was distilled<br>
off under vacuum and the residue was dried under vacuum, the<br>
objective compound Fmoc-Ala-Gly-OH could not be obtained.<br><br>
As can be clearly seen from comparative example 3, when<br>
the carrier for separation represented by the above-described<br>
formula (3) was used, Fmoc-dipeptide could not be obtained.<br>
This is apparently due to the bond between the carrier for<br>
separation Ka and dipeptide which is comparatively difficult<br>
to be cleaved, so that it was not cleaved by the solid acid<br>
reagent.<br>
Comparative Example 4<br>
Excision of Fmoc-dipeptide Bound to Solid Phase Carrier by<br>
Solid Phase Reagent<br>
Chloro-trityl(2-chloro)resin (Watanabe Chemical Industry)<br>
(hereinafter abbreviated as "CTC") (1.45 mmol) was used as a<br>
solid phase carrier, and CTC-Gly-Ala-Fmoc was synthesized by<br>
the solid phase reaction method. In addition, to a solution of<br>
CTC-Gly-Ala-Fmoc (580 mg, supported amount 0.84 mmol)<br>
dissolved in dichloromethane (25 ml) was added a solid acid<br>
reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., trade name: Montmorilloni-te K10)<br><br>
72<br>
(1000 mg), and the mixture was stirred to react at room<br>
temperature for 3.5 hours. After the reaction, methanol (60<br>
ml) was added, and the solvent was distilled off slowly under<br>
vacuum. The obtained crystals and the solid acid reagent were<br>
filtered with a Kiriyama funnel to recover the filtrate.<br>
Although the solvent of this filtrate was distilled off under<br>
vacuum and the residue was dried in vacuo, the objective<br>
compound Fmoc-Ala-Gly-OH could not be obtained.<br>
As can be clearly seen from comparative example 4, when<br>
the solid phase carrier was used, Fmoc-dipeptide could not be<br>
obtained. This is apparently due to the insolubility of both<br>
the solid phase carrier and solid acid reagent in the reaction<br>
solution, so that they have no chance to interact each other,<br>
resulting in failure of bond cleavage.<br>
Example 9<br>
Tripeptide Synthesis by Solid Phase Reaction Using Fmoc-<br>
dipeptide<br>
Tripeptide synthesis on solid phase carrier<br>
Similar to comparative example 4, CTC-phenylalanine<br>
(Phe)-H was synthesized by the solid phase reaction method<br>
using CTC as a solid phase carrier. Furthermore, similar to<br>
Example 7, Fmoc-Ala-Gly-OH was synthesized. Then, to<br>
dichloromethane (2 ml) were added CTC-Phe-H (110 mg (0.145<br>
mmol)), Fmoc-Ala-Gly-OH (160 mg (0.4 mmol)), HBTU (165 mg (0.4<br>
mmol)), HOBt (60 mg (0.4 mmol)), dimethylformamide (1 ml) and<br>
diisopropylethylamine (75 ul (0.4 mmol)), respectively, and<br>
the mixture was stirred to react at room temperature for 2<br><br>
73<br>
hours. After the reaction, the solid phase was washed with<br>
dimethylformamide (3 x 2 ml) , methanol (3 x 2 ml) and<br>
dichloromethane (3x2 ml), respectively. Subsequently, to the<br>
above solid phase was added the previously prepared Fmoc<br>
de-protection solution (dimethylformamide : piperidine : DBU =<br>
96 : 2 : 2) (2 ml), and the mixture was stirred to react at<br>
room temperature for 1 hour to obtain CTC-Phe-Gly-Ala-H.<br>
Excision of Tripeptide Bound to Solid Phase Carrier<br>
The above-obtained CTC-Phe-Gly-Ala-H was washed with<br>
dimethylformamide (3x2 ml), methanol (3x2 ml), and<br>
dichloromethane (3 x 2 ml), respectively. Subsequently, the<br>
previously prepared excision fluid (dichloromethane containing<br>
1% trichloroacetic acid) (20 ml) was added, and the resulting<br>
mixture was stirred to react for 30 minutes at room<br>
temperature. After the reaction, the solution was filtered<br>
through a Kiriyama funnel to recover the filtrate. The solvent<br>
of this filtrate was distilled off under vacuum, and the<br>
residue was dried in vacuo to obtain the objective compound H-<br>
Ala-Gly-Phe-OH. As a result of high-performance liquid<br>
chromatography, purity was 94%.<br>
As can be clearly seen from Example 9, the use of Fmoc-<br>
dipeptide synthesized using a carrier for separation<br>
represented by the above-described formula (2) as a material<br>
of the solid phase reaction method enables tripeptide to be<br>
synthesized in a fewer number of processes, rapidly, and in<br>
high purity.<br>
Comparative Example 5<br><br>

Tripeptide Synthesis by Solid Phase Reaction Method<br>
Tripeptide Synthesis on Solid Phase Carrier<br>
Similar to comparative example 4, CTC-Phe-H was<br>
synthesized by the solid phase reaction method using CTC as a<br>
solid phase carrier. Then, to dichloromethane (2 ml) were<br>
added CTC-Phe-H (110 mg (0.145 mmol)), Fmoc-Gly-OH (120 mg<br>
(0.4 mmol)), HBTU (165 mg (0.4 mmol)), HOBt (60 mg (0.4<br>
mmol)), dimethylformamide (1 ml) and diisopropylethylamine (75<br>
ul (0.4 mmol)), respectively, and the mixture was stirred to<br>
react at room temperature for 2 hours. After the reaction, the<br>
solid phase was washed with dimethylformamide (3 x 2-ml),<br>
methanol (3 x 2 ml) and dichloromethane (3 x 2 ml),<br>
respectively. Subsequently, to the solid phase was added the<br>
previously prepared Fmoc deprotection solution<br>
(dimethylformamide : piperidine : DBU = 96 : 2 : 2) (2 ml),<br>
and the mixture was stirred to react at room temperature for 1<br>
hour to obtain CTC-Phe-Gly-H. This CTC-Phe-Gly-H was dissolved<br>
in dichloromethane (2 ml), and Fmoc-Ala-OH-H20 (130 mg (0.4<br>
mmol)), HBTU (165 mg (0.4 mmol)), HOBt (60 mg (0.4 mmol)),<br>
dimethylformamide (1ml) and diisopropylethylamine (75 ul (0.4<br>
mmol)) were added, respectively, and the mixture was stirred<br>
to react at room temperature for 2 hours. After the reaction,<br>
the solid phase was washed with dimethylformamide (3 x 2 ml),<br>
methanol (3 x 2 ml), and dichloromethane (3 x 2 ml),<br>
respectively. Subsequently, to the solid phase was added the<br>
previously prepared Fmoc deprotection solution<br>
(dimethylformamide : piperidine : DBU = 96 : 2 : 2) (2 ml),<br><br>
75<br>
and the mixture was stirred to react at room temperature for 1<br>
hour to obtain CTC-Phe-Gly-Ala-H.<br>
Excision of Tripeptide Bound to Solid Phase Carrier<br>
The above-obtained CTC-Phe-Gly-Ala-H was washed with<br>
dimethylformamide (3 x 2 ml), methanol (3x2 ml), and<br>
dichloromethane (3x2 ml), respectively. Subsequently, the<br>
previously prepared excision solution (dichloromethane<br>
containing 1% trichloroacetic acid) (20 ml) was added, and the<br>
resulting mixture was stirred to react for 30 minutes at room<br>
temperature. After the reaction, the solution was filtered<br>
through a Kiriyama funnel to recover the filtrate. The solvent<br>
of this filtrate was distilled off under vacuum, and the<br>
residue was dried in vacuo to obtain the objective compound H-<br>
Ala-Gly-Phe-OH. As a result of high-performance liquid<br>
chromatography, purity was 8 8%.<br>
As can be clearly seen from comparative example 5, the<br>
tripeptide could be synthesized as usual by a conventional<br>
solid phase reaction method, but purity of the product was<br>
lower compared with Example 9. This is probably due to, for<br>
example, a partial failure of the reaction of CTC-Phe-H with<br>
Fmoc-Gly-OH and instead due to the reaction of CTC-Phe-H with<br>
the subsequently added Fmoc-Ala-OH-H20, resulting in the<br>
synthesis of a dipeptide, H-Ala-Phe-OH, or due to a partial<br>
failure of the reaction of CTC-Phe-Gly-H with Fmoc-Ala-OH-H20,<br>
resulting in the synthesis of a dipeptide, H-Gly-Phe-OH.<br>
