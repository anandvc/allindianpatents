				<td>EARRING FOR A PIERCED EAR<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention pertains to an earring connector and, more particularly, to<br>
a connector for an earring for a pierced ear that provides a secure and simple mounting.<br>
Pierced earrings in the prior art utilize a variety of connectors to secure the ear<br>
post or ear wire within the ear lobe of the wearer to prevent accidental dislodgment and loss. In<br>
a conventional circular or loop ear ring, the ring is provided with a gap to receive the ear lobe<br>
and the ear wire or post is mounted to one end of the ring, while the other free end is passed<br>
through the ear lobe and caused to engage the other end of the ring. One means of providing a<br>
secure connection is shown in U.S. Patent 260,692 in which the body of the ring opposite the<br>
gap is provided with a spring-biased hinge, allowing the two ring halves to pivot with respect to<br>
one another. The ear wire is secured to the end of one ring half and, as the ring halves are<br>
pivoted relative to one another, the ear wire moves away from the end of the other ring half for<br>
insertion through the ear lobe, after which the ring halves are pivoted back to the closed<br>
position with the ear wire secured in the end of the other ring half.<br>
Another loop earring connector is shown in U.S. Patent 3,208,239. One end of<br>
the ear wire is pivotally attached to one end of the ring for movement in an arc that coincides<br>
with the plane of the ring. After insertion of the free end of the ear wire through the ear lobe of<br>
the wearer, the wire is pivoted in the plane of the ear ring, permitting the free end of the ear<br>
wire to be received in a notch formed in the other end of the ring and held therein with a friction<br>
fit. Other variations of this type of connection, sometimes referred to as a V connection, are<br>
known in the prior art.<br>
A further variation in a connector for a circular or loop type pierced ear ring is<br>
shown in Patent No. 3,673,815. The earring in this patent is made from flat bar stock rolled to<br>
form a ring with spaced ends forming a gap that is spanned by the ear wire. One end of the ear<br>
wire is formed with a loop connected to one free end of the ring and the other end of the ear<br>
wire is inserted into a lateral slot formed in the other free end of the ring. The loose pivotal<br>
connection of the ear wire to the ring permits pivotal movement in many directions requiring<br>
the wearer to exercise considerable dexterity in aligning the ear wire with the connecting slot.<br>
German Patent No. 31731 disclosed a cuff link or button for clothes having an<br>
open loop-shaped body and a pivotally attached pin to close the open loop after attachment.<br>
However, the pin end is not secured.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an earring for a pierced ear. said earring<br>
comprising: a ring body having spaced opposing ends defining a gap sized to receive an ear lobe: an<br>
ear post having a length greater than the gap and having one end pivotallv attached to one opposing<br>
end of the ring bodv on a pivot positioned to permit movement of the opposite free end of the post<br>
toward and away from the other opposing end of the ring bodv. said movement being confined to an<br>
arc transverse to the plane of the body; and. a locking detent on the said other opposing end of the<br>
ring body sized to receive the free end of the post and to hold the free end with a resilient bias, said<br>
locking detent comprising an indentation formed in said other opposing end of the ring body, said<br>
indentation having an entrv slot engageable by the free end of the post in response to movement of<br>
said free end on said arc, said slot being dimensioned to cause a slight resilient deflection of said free<br>
end as said free end passes through said slot, said entry slot having a lead-in surface divergent in the<br>
direction of resilient deflection of said free end from the direction of movement on said arc. said<br>
lead-in surface being positioned to be engaged by said free end as said free end moves on said arc<br>
into said entry slot, and a locking recess in open communication with said slot and dimensioned to<br>
permit return of said free end from the deflected state to lock in said recess.<br>
The locking detent for the free end of the post comprises an indentation formed in one end of<br>
the ring bodv and includes an entrv slot that is engageable by the free end of the post in response to<br>
movement along the transverse arc. The slot is dimensioned to cause a slight resilient deflection of<br>
the free end of the post as it passes into the slot, and the indentation includes a locking recess that<br>
opens inward!) from the slot is dimensioned to permit return of the free end of the post from its<br>
deflected state to lock it in the recess. The entrv slot preferablv includes a lead-in surface that is<br><br>
divergent in the direction of deflection of the free end of the post from the direction of movement<br>
along the transverse arc. The indentation also preferably includes a transition surface between the slot<br>
and the locking recess that is divergent in the direction of resilient deflection of the free end of the<br>
post from the reverse direction of post movement on the transverse arc.<br>
The ear post preferably comprises a malleable metal wire having one end flattened for pivotal<br>
attachment to one end of the ring body. The pivotal attachment comprises a notch formed in one end<br>
of the ring body and defined by spaced end members, the notch being dimensioned to receive the<br>
flattened end of the post. Aligned holes are provided in the flattened post end and in the end<br>
members, and a pivot pin is received in the aligned holes and secured in the hole in at least one of the<br>
end members. The pin is preferably secured with an interference fit.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the ring body is generally annular in shape and the post is<br>
curved to conform generally to the annular shape of the body.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the earring connector the present invention is shown in use<br>
with a conventional circular body or simple loop-type earring 10. The body 11 of the earring<br>
has spaced opposed first and second ends 12 and 13, respectively, that define a gap 14 to<br>
accommodate the ear lobe of a wearer. Earring body 11 is closed by an ear wire or ear post 15<br>
that passes through a hole in the ear lobe of the wearer. Although the invention is shown and<br>
described with respect to a simple circular earring body 11, it should be understood that the<br>
invention is applicable to virtually any type of earring that includes a gap within which the ear<br>
lobe of a wearer is located.<br>
The ear post 15 is preferably formed from a piece of malleable metal wire, such<br>
as silver, commonly used for an ear wire or earring post. The first end 12 of the ear body 11 is<br>
provided with a notch 16 that extends through the end or a plane generally transverse to the<br>
plane of the ring body 11. One end of the ear post 15 is flattened and formed into a circular end<br>
17 that is subsequently pierced to provide a hole 18 for receipt of a pivot pin 20. The notch 16<br>
in the end 12 of the body is defined by a pair of spaced end members 21 which are also drilled<br>
or otherwise pierced to provide an aligned pair of pin holes 22. The pivot pin 20 is inserted<br>
through the aligned holes 18 and 22 and secured therein, preferably by providing an<br>
interference fit between one end of the pin and one or both pin holes 22. The hole 18 in the end<br>
of the post 15 is larger than the diameter of the pivot pin, allowing the post to pivot on the pin.<br>
However, a close tolerance is preferably provided between the end members 21 defining the<br>
notch 16 and the opposite faces of the circular end 17 of the post, such that pivotal movement of<br>
the post is substantially confined to a plane transverse to the plane of the ring body 11.<br>
The ear post 15 is preferably bent in a circular arc that corresponds generally to<br>
the shape and diameter of the ring body 11. The opposite free end 23 of the ear post 15 is not<br><br>
formed in any particular manner and may simply by cut with a flat, squared-off end. The post<br>
has a length greater than the gap 14 such that when the post is pivoted from the open Fig. 4<br>
position to the closed dotted line position, the free end 23 will engage the second end 13 of the<br>
ring body, The wearer inserts the free end 23 of the ear post through a hole pierced in the ear<br>
lobe and then simply pivots the ear post along its circular arc into locking engagement with the<br>
end 13 of the ring body 11. The special locking detent that receives and holds the free end 23<br>
of the post in a locked position will be described as follows.<br>
The second end 13 of the ring body is provided with a generally flat end face 24<br>
in which is cut or otherwise formed an indentation 25 that provides a locking detent for the post<br>
end 23. The indentation 25 includes an entry slot 26 that is slightly below the path of<br>
movement of the post end 23 as the post pivots from the open position to the closed position.<br>
The entry slot is provided with a lead-in surface 27 that is preferably rounded and diverges from<br>
the direction of post movement downward in the direction of the slot opening. The inherent<br>
resilience of the ear post 15, possibly aided by a slight play in the pivot joint, causes the post<br>
end 23 to deflect slightly downwardly (toward the center of the ring body 11) as the wearer<br>
forces the post into engagement with the end of the ring body. The indentation 25 also includes<br>
a locking recess 28 into which the post end moves as a result of resilient return of the post end<br>
23 from its slightly deflected state to lock the post in the closed position.<br>
The transition between the surface of the locking recess 28 and the entry slot 26<br>
is defined by a lead-out surface 30 that diverges in the same direction as the lead-in surface 27,<br>
the two surfaces 27 and 30 joining to define a locking lobe 31 that serves as a barrier to<br>
inadvertent opening of the locked ear post 15. This locking engagement is best shown in Figs.<br>
2 and 3. The wearer may open the earring for removal by forcing the ear post 15 to rotate in the<br>
reverse direction, whereby the inherent resilience of the post will cause the post end 23 to ride<br>
downwardly over the lead-out surface 30 and pass through the entry slot 26. Both attachment<br>
of the earring 10 to the ear and its removal are simple and, if necessary, may be accomplished<br>
using only one hand. Furthermore, pivotal movement of the ear post confined to the arc which<br>
is generally transverse to the plane of the earring causes the end of the ear post to engage the<br>
locking lobe 31 and to enter the entry slot 26 without any need for the wearer to carefully align<br>
mating parts. In other words, once the post has been inserted through the hole in the lobe of the<br>
wearer, it is only necessary to squeeze the post and the end 13 of the ring together to lock the<br>
post end 23 in the locking recess 28. Reverse movement for removal of the earring is equally<br>
simple and direct.<br><br>
I CLAIM :<br>
