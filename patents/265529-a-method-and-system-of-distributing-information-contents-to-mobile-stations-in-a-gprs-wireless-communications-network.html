				<td>METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR DISTRIBUTING MULTIMEDIA CONTENTS<br>
THROUGH A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK, PARTICULARLY A<br>
MOBILE TELEPHONY NETWORK<br>
The present invention generally relates to the field of telecommunications, and<br>
more particularly to wireless, mobile communications networks, such as mobile<br>
telephony networks. Specifically, the invention concerns the distribution of relevant<br>
amounts of data, such as multimedia information contents, to mobile user terminals (e.g.,<br>
mobile phones) through a wireless, mobile communications network.<br>
Mobile telephony networks were initially conceived for enabling voice<br>
communications, similarly to the wired, Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTNs),<br>
but between mobile users.<br>
Mobile telephony networks have experienced an enormous spread, especially after<br>
the introduction of second-generation mobile cellular networks, and particularly digital<br>
mobile cellular networks such as those complying with the Global System for Mobile<br>
communications (GSM) standard (and its United States and Japanese counterparts).<br>
The services offered by these cellular networks in addition to plain voice<br>
communications have rapidly increased in number and quality; just to cite a few<br>
examples, Short Messaging System (SMS) and Multimedia Messaging System (MMS)<br>
services, and Internet connectivity services have been made available in the last few<br>
years.<br>
However, these second-generation cellular networks, albeit satisfactory for voice<br>
communication, offer very poor data exchange capabilities.<br>
Similarly to the PSTNs, second-generation cellular networks are in fact switchedcircuit<br>
networks; this greatly limits the bandwidth that can be allocated for a given user.<br>
On the contrary, data communications networks such as computer networks and, among<br>
them, the Internet, adopt packet switching schemes, which allow much higher data<br>
transfer rates.<br>
Some solutions have been proposed to overcome the limitations of conventional,<br>
switched-circuit cellular networks such as the GSM networks, so as to enable users of<br>
mobile terminals efficiently exploiting services offered through the Internet.<br>
One of the solutions that have acquired a significant popularity is the General<br>
Packet Radio Service (shortly, GPRS). The GPRS is a digital mobile phone technology<br>
compatible with GSM networks (actually, built on the existing GSM network<br>
architecture) that enables data transfer at a speed higher than that allowed by pure GSM.<br>
Essentially, the GPRS can be viewed as a GSM add-up that supports and enables<br>
packet-based data communication.<br>
Although third-generation wireless communications systems such as those<br>
complying with the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) are more<br>
promising in terms of data transfer rates, the GPRS is a ready-at-hand solution for<br>
enhancing the data exchange capabilities of already existing GSM networks, and is<br>
therefore gaining an increasing popularity.<br>
In GPRS communications networks the information content is usually transferred<br>
in a point-to-point modality (unicasting), upon activation of a session between a GPRS<br>
mobile phone (or mobile station) and a service provider connected to a packet data<br>
network, e.g. a server connected to the Internet; the activation of such a session involves<br>
the setting up of logic connections between the server and the GPRS mobile phone.<br>
In such a point-to-point communication mode, the radio resources to be allocated<br>
for the exchange of data between the ground GPRS network and the GPRS mobile<br>
stations depend on the number of different mobile stations simultaneously exploiting the<br>
GPRS services, even if the same GPRS service is being exploited by two or more mobile<br>
station users at the same time. Clearly, this limits the possibility of simultaneously<br>
accessing available GPRS services by several users, unless the radio resources are<br>
overdimensioned.<br>
Thus, it would be desirable to have the possibility of delivering information<br>
contents related to a same GPRS service exploitable by two or more users at a time<br>
through a point-to-multipoint transmission mode, saving the amount of allocated<br>
resources.<br>
The problem of broadcasting relatively massive information contents, such as<br>
multimedia (audio and/or video) contents, to several mobile terminal users has already<br>
been faced in the art.<br>
In particular, the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) Technical<br>
Specification No. TS 23.246 ("Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS);<br>
Architecture and functional description"), v6.1.0, December 2003, whose teachings are<br>
herein incorporated by reference, describes the architectural solution and functionalities<br>
for MBMS.<br>
The above-referred Technical Specification deals with the "core network" aspects,<br>
and does not cover the physical, radio communications aspects involved in the<br>
implementation of a MBMS.<br>
Multicast transmission in GPRS networks is also dealt with in the International<br>
application No. WO 03/019840 A2. The method proposed in that document provides for<br>
routing through a cellular network only a single copy of multicast data to a plurality of<br>
mobile stations in a cell; a virtual subscriber mobile station is emulated, that subscribes to<br>
a multicast service and receives the multicast data for the cell. The real mobile stations<br>
that should receive the multicast data are instructed to listen to, and consequently tune to<br>
a channel assigned to the virtual subscriber.<br>
The Applicant observes that the implementation of the proposed method is not<br>
free of costs, because it involves modifying in a significant way the network apparatuses<br>
governing the radio communications. In particular, elements are needed to emulate the<br>
virtual mobile station.<br>
Furthermore, the Applicant observes that the proposed method shows an<br>
additional and more severe drawback: the different mobile stations in a cell that are<br>
exploiting a given multicast service are indistinguishable for the network apparatuses,<br>
which are thus impossibilitated to address information to a specific mobile station.<br>
In the Applicant opinion, this is a severe limitation, for example because it makes<br>
impossible to implement efficient policies of acknowledge/not-acknowledge of the<br>
distributed content.<br>
According to a submission recently made at the GERAN2 #18 Meeting, held in<br>
Phoenix, AZ, U.S.A. from March 22 to March 26, 2004 (the text of which can be<br>
downloaded from the Internet site<br>
ftp://ftp.3gpp.org/TSG GERAN/WG2_protocolaspects/GERAN218bis Phoenix/Docs/<br>
G2-040286, entitled "Common Feedback Channel for MBMS delivery", there is proposed<br>
to define a Common Feedback CHannel (CFCH) intended to be used as a feedback<br>
channel, where negative acknowledgments (nack) are sent as access bursts at precise<br>
times. More specifically, according to the proponents, feedback messages are sent by all<br>
interested Mobile Stations (MSs) as access bursts on the CFCH at a precise time: if a MS<br>
does not decode the RLC block transmitted at time t, it will send an access burst at time<br>
t+At; if a MS successfully decodes the RLC block transmitted at time t, nothing is<br>
transmitted on the feedback channel at time t+At.<br>
The consequence is that, if an access burst is detected at time t+At (the network<br>
could infer that one or more MSs have sent a nack from the increased received power on<br>
the feedback channel), the network realizes that the block transmitted at time t has not<br>
been received (at least) by one MS.<br>
The proponents observe that if several MS's send access bursts at the same time<br>
and they collide, there might be no problem since they all carry the same info (i.e. loss of<br>
block sent at time t). The information is not the content of the access burst, but the<br>
presence of the access burst itself.<br>
The Applicant however is of the opinion that this implementation of the feedback<br>
from the MSs is not suitable to implement efficient acknowledge/not-acknowledge<br>
policies. For example, this implementation does not allow to recognize if a series of nack<br>
responses may be ignored because it is coming from a mobile station located in a<br>
geographical area in which the signal reception is very poor. As another example, this<br>
implementation cannot allow a better tuning of some parameters of the mobile stations in<br>
order to increase the quality of the reception of the data contents, such as for example the<br>
Timing Advance of the mobile stations. It is also noticed that the proponents of the cited<br>
solution clearly state that their goal is not to realize a fully acknowledged protocol.<br>
The Applicant has faced the problem of implementing a MBMS service in which<br>
information may be specifically addressed to different mobile stations (for example an<br>
ack/nack request), and in which information from the mobile stations can be recognized<br>
and distinguished (for example, in order to get an ack/nack feedback), by suitable network<br>
equipment.<br>
The Applicant has found that the mobile stations in a cell that are exploiting a<br>
given multicast service, and thus would be indistinguishable for the network (because<br>
they share the same physical communication resources) can be rendered distinguishable<br>
from each other by defining a radio link identifier, preferably adapted to be included in a<br>
header of the radio blocks sent to the mobile stations for the multicast service, and<br>
communicating such an identifier to the mobile stations. This allows the implementation<br>
of, for example, more efficient data retransmission schemes.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there is therefore provided a<br>
method as set forth in appended claim 1, for distributing data packets to mobile stations<br>
through a wireless communications network.<br>
Summarizing, in a wireless communications network comprising a base station<br>
subsystem controlling at least one network cell, and in which the base station subsystem<br>
communicates with mobile stations in the cell through radio blocks, the method according<br>
to this aspect of the invention comprises:<br>
obtaining, starting from the data packets, radio blocks to be transmitted through<br>
the network cell;<br>
labeling said radio blocks with a first radio link identifier, identifying a logic<br>
connection between a mobile station and the base station subsystem;<br>
communicating the first radio link identifier to a first mobile station in the network<br>
cell; and<br>
in case at least one second mobile station in the network cell asks to receive the<br>
information contents, communicating thereto said first radio link identifier.<br>
The method further comprises having the first mobile station and the at least one<br>
second mobile station assigned respective second radio link identifiers, to be included in<br>
said radio blocks.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, said first radio link identifier<br>
comprises a Temporary Flow Identity (TFI) corresponding to a Temporary Block Flow<br>
(TBF) activated by the base station subsystem for delivering the information contents to<br>
the mobile stations.<br>
In particular, said second radio link identifiers are univocally assigned to each<br>
mobile station.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, said step of having the first and the at<br>
least one second mobile stations assigned respective second radio link identifiers includes<br>
assigning to the first and the at least one second mobile stations parameters useful for<br>
enabling a synchronization of the radio communication between the MS and the base<br>
station subsystem.<br>
Said step of having the first and the at least one second mobile stations assigned<br>
respective second radio link identifiers may be performed by the base station subsystem<br>
on request by the mobile stations, or automatically in reply to a service request from the<br>
mobile stations. In particular, this step may be performed before starting to transmitting<br>
the radio blocks and, even more particularly, it may be performed before or after said step<br>
of communicating said first radio link identifier to said first and said second mobile<br>
stations.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the method comprises having every mobile<br>
station in excess of a predetermined number assigned a common second radio link<br>
identifier.<br>
In particular, said step of having the first and the at least one second mobile<br>
stations assigned respective second radio link identifiers may comprise establishing a<br>
temporary communication uplink from the mobile stations to the base station subsystem.<br>
Preferably, the temporary communication uplink is released before transmitting through<br>
the network cell said radio blocks obtained from said data packets.<br>
Information can be addressed to a selected mobile station among the first and the<br>
at least one second mobile stations using the respective second radio link identifier; to this<br>
purpose, the second radio link identifier may be included in at least one radio block<br>
obtained from said data packets, particularly in a header portion thereof.<br>
In particular, said step of addressing information further comprises requesting the<br>
selected mobile station to provide an answer; said answer may requesting the mobile<br>
station to provide acknowledge information on the successful receipt of the radio blocks<br>
obtained from the data packets. In particular, said answer may be transmitted to the base<br>
station subsystem on a control channel associated with a channel on which the radio<br>
blocks are transmitted. The method may include retransmitting already transmitted radio<br>
blocks obtained from the data packets depending on the acknowledge information<br>
received from the mobile stations.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, a wireless communications<br>
network system as set forth in appended claim 20 is provided, for distributing information<br>
contents provided in data packets by an information content provider to mobile stations<br>
through a wireless communications network.<br>
Summarizing, the wireless communications network system comprises:<br>
a network base station subsystem enabling wireless communications with a<br>
plurality of mobile stations located in a network cell through radio blocks, the base station<br>
subsystem being adapted to receiving information contents in data packets, obtaining<br>
radio blocks from the data packets, labeling the radio blocks with a first radio link<br>
identifier to be communicated to a first mobile station in the network cell and to at least<br>
one second mobile station in the network cell asking to receive the information contents,<br>
transmitting the radio blocks.<br>
The base station subsystem is also adapted to assigning respective second radio<br>
link identifiers to the first mobile station and to the at least one second mobile station, the<br>
second radio link identifiers being adapted to be included in said radio blocks.<br>
In particular, said first radio link identifier comprises a Temporary Flow Identity<br>
(TFI) corresponding to a Temporary Block Flow (TBF) activated by the base station<br>
subsystem for delivering the information contents to the mobile stations.<br>
The base station subsystem may be adapted to univocally assigning said second<br>
radio link identifiers to each mobile station.<br>
The base station subsystem may be further adapted to assigning to the first and at<br>
least one second mobile stations parameters useful for enabling a synchronization of the<br>
radio communications between the mobile stations and the base station subsystem.<br>
The base station subsystem may be adapted to assigning the second radio link<br>
identifiers on request from the mobile stations, or automatically in reply to a service<br>
request from the mobile stations. In particular, the base station subsystem may be adapted<br>
to assigning the second radio link identifiers before starting the distribution of the<br>
information contents, in particular before or, alternatively, after communicating the first<br>
radio link identifier to the mobile stations.<br>
The base station subsystem may be adapted to assigning a common second radio<br>
link identifier to every mobile station in excess of a predetermined number.<br>
The base station subsystem may be further adapted to establishing a temporary<br>
communication uplink from the mobile stations to the base station subsystem before<br>
starting to transmitting the radio blocks.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the base station subsystem is adapted to<br>
addressing information to a mobile station among the first and the at least one second<br>
mobile stations using the respective second radio link identifiers; in particular, the second<br>
radio link identifier may be included in at least one of the radio blocks obtained from the<br>
data packets.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the base station subsystem is adapted to<br>
requesting the addressed mobile station to provide an answer, in particular, to provide<br>
acknowledge information on the successful receipt of the radio blocks obtained from said<br>
data packets. The base station subsystem may also be adapted to retransmitting already<br>
transmitted radio blocks obtained from said data packets, depending on the acknowledge<br>
information received from the mobile stations.<br>
In particular, said answer may be transmitted on a control channel associated with<br>
a channel on which the radio data blocks are transmitted.<br>
According to a third aspect of the present invention, a mobile station is provided<br>
as set forth in claim 38, for the use in a wireless communications network supporting the<br>
distribution to the mobile stations of information contents provided in data packets by an<br>
information content provider the information contents being transmitted to the mobile<br>
stations in radio blocks labeled by a first radio link identifier, particularly a Temporary<br>
Flow Identity (TFI) corresponding to a Temporary Block Flow (TBF) activated for<br>
delivering the information contents to the mobile stations, communicated by the base<br>
station subsystem to the mobile stations.<br>
Summarizing, the mobile station is adapted to:<br>
storing an own second radio link identifier assigned thereto;<br>
recognizing a received radio block as including a second radio link identifier;<br>
extracting from the received radio block the second radio link identifier; and<br>
comparing the extracted second radio link identifier with said own second radio<br>
link identifier.<br>
In particular, the mobile station may be further adapted to considering itself<br>
addressed by the network in case said extracted second radio link identifier matches the<br>
own second radio link identifier.<br>
In particular, the mobile station is further adapted to providing to the network<br>
information on the successful receipt of the radio blocks delivering the information<br>
contents when addressed through the personal second radio link identifier.<br>
Said first radio link identifier comprises a Temporary Flow Identity (TFI)<br>
corresponding to a Temporary Block Flow (TBF) activated for delivering the information<br>
contents to the mobile stations.<br>
These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be made<br>
apparent by the following detailed description of an embodiment thereof, provided merely<br>
by way of non-limitative example, description that will be conducted making reference to<br>
the attached drawings, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic view of a GPRS network supporting multicast services,<br>
adapted to implement a method according to an embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 schematically shows how data relating to a same GPRS service are<br>
distributed in multicast to several mobile stations in a cell at a time, without a waste of<br>
radio resources, in one embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic flowchart illustrating the operation of the GPRS network<br>
of Figure 1, in respect of a generic multicast service;<br>
Figure 4 A is an exploded, more detailed pictorial representation of the structure of<br>
a GPRS radio data block, evidencing how users of a same multicast service are rendered<br>
distinguishable and individually addressable by the network apparatuses, in an<br>
embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figure 4B shows a similar, exploded representation of the structure of a radio data<br>
block according to a EGRPS standard (for OMSK code schemes MCS1-MCS4);<br>
Figure 5 is a schematic flowchart illustrating a MS-selective data receipt<br>
acknoweldge/unacknowledge scheme according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention;<br>
Figure 6 schematically shows, in terms of functional blocks relevant to the<br>
understanding of the exemplary invention embodiment herein considered, a mobile<br>
station adapted to exploit a multicast GPRS service;<br>
Figure 7 is a pictorial representation of the MS-selective data receipt<br>
acknoweldge/unacknowledge scheme depicted in Figure 5;<br>
Figures 8A and 8B schematically show, in terms of exchanged messages, two<br>
alternative procedures for assigning resources to MSs when a multicast GPRS service<br>
starts to be delivered.<br>
With reference to the drawings and, particularly, to Figure 1, a cellular mobile<br>
communications network 100, particularly a GSM network, is schematically shown.<br>
The mobile communications network 100 comprises a plurality of Base Station<br>
Subsystems (BSSs), each one providing coverage for cellular communications in a<br>
respective geographic region.<br>
The generic BSS comprises a plurality of Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs), each<br>
one covering a respective geographic area within the region covered by the BSS; the<br>
number of BTSs in a BSS may be in the practice rather high but, for simplicity of the<br>
drawing, only four BTSs BTS1, BTS2, BTS3 and BTS4 (pictorially represented by an<br>
antenna) with an associated cell CELLl, CELL2, CELL3 and CELL4 (schematically<br>
depicted as an area surrounded by a dashed circle) are shown in Figure 1. The generic<br>
BTS communicates with users' Mobile Stations (MS), typically cellular phones, which<br>
are located in the BTS's cell, such as the MSs MSI and MS2 within the cell CELLl, the<br>
MS MS3 within the cell CELL2, the MS MS4 within the cell CELL3 and the MSs MSS,<br>
MS6 and MS7 within the cell CELL4.<br>
Typically, a plurality of BTSs are connected to a same Base Station Controller<br>
(BSC), a network unit that controls the BTSs; for example, all the BTSs of a same BSS<br>
are connected to a same BSC, such as, making reference to Figure 1, the BSC BSC1 to<br>
which the BTS BTS1 is connected, and the BSC BSC2 to which the other three BTS<br>
BTS2, BTS3 and BTS4 are connected. Roughly speaking, the BTSs handle the actual<br>
transmission/reception of signals to/from the MSs, whereas the BSCs instruct the<br>
different BTSs about which data have to be transmitted on specified physical, radio<br>
communication channels.<br>
Figure 1 schematically depicts network elements that, according to the GPRS<br>
standard, enable the MSs, connected to the cellular mobile communications network 100,<br>
to access an external packet-based data communications network (shortly, a packet data<br>
network) such as, for example, the Internet and/or an Intranet, more generally any data<br>
communications network in which data are exchanged in packets, i.e. according to a<br>
packet-switched scheme instead of a switched-circuit one, particularly but not limitatively<br>
any network adopting the Internet Protocol (IP). In the drawing, the external packet data<br>
network is shown only schematically, and it is identified globally by 105; hereinafter, it<br>
will be assumed that the external packet data network 105 is the Internet, but this is not to<br>
be intended as a limitation, being merely an example.<br>
Without entering into excessive details, known per-se in the art and not relevant to<br>
the understanding of the invention embodiment herein described, at least one Gateway<br>
GPRS Support Node (GGSN) GGSN is provided to act as an interface between the<br>
cellular network 100 and one or more external packet data network, such as the Internet<br>
105. The GGSN GGSN exchanges data packets, through a GPRS backbone network 110,<br>
with one or more Serving GPRS Support Nodes (SGSN), such as the two SGSNs SGSN1<br>
and SGSN2 shown in the drawing. The generic SGSN is associated with one or more<br>
respective BSSs, and routes the data packets received, through the GGSN (or one of the<br>
GGSNs, if more than one GGSN exist) and the GPRS backbone network, from the<br>
external packet-based communications network (or one of the external, packet-based<br>
communications networks), to the proper destination MS, located in the geographic area<br>
covered by the respective BSS (or by one of the respective BSSs); for example, the SGSN<br>
SGSN1 routes the data packets received, through the GGSN GGSN and the GPRS<br>
backbone network 110, from the external packet-based communications network 105 to<br>
the MS MSI and/or the MS MS2.<br>
In particular, the generic SGSN keeps track of the geographical location of the<br>
MSs, so as to know whereto the data packets are to be routed in order to be delivered to<br>
the intended destination MS. In particular, depending on the fact that the MS is actively<br>
exchanging data (a condition referred to as READY status) or not (a condition referred to<br>
as STAND-BY) the geographical location of which track is kept at the SGSN may be a<br>
specific network cell, or a larger area represented by a group of cells, referred to as a<br>
"routing area". In other words, the generic SGSN is aware of which cell/routing area the<br>
destination MS is currently located. It is observed that a single SGSN may communicate<br>
with a plurality of GGSN, for receiving data packets from different external packet data<br>
networks.<br>
In order to provide data packet-based communications services, each BSC is<br>
associated with a respective Packet Control Unit (PCU), not explicitly shown in the<br>
drawing because intended as part of the BSCs. The PCU behaves as an interface of the<br>
BSC to a packet-based data communications network 115 internal to the cellular network<br>
100 and connecting the BSC to a respective SGSN, such as the SGSN SGSN1 for the<br>
BSC BSC1 and the SGSN SGSN2 for the BSC BSC2. The PCU converts the data<br>
packets, received from the respective SGSN through the internal packet-based data<br>
communications network 115 and directed to the destination MS, into data streams<br>
adapted to being transmitted "over the air", by one of the BTSs, exploiting the radio<br>
resources of the network. Furthermore, data streams transmitted by the MS "over the air"<br>
and received by the BTS are converted into data packets formatted according to the<br>
protocol supported by the internal packet-based data communications network 115, for<br>
transmission to the respective SGSN, in the drawing the SGSN SGSN1 or SGSN2, and to<br>
the GGSN GGSN.<br>
Conventionally, the procedure for enabling the user of a generic MS supporting<br>
GPRS communications (a GPRS MS), for example the MS MSI in the cell CELLl, to<br>
exploit services provided by a service provider or content provider 120 (the server)<br>
accessible through the Internet 105 or, shortly stated, the fruition by a GPRS MS of a<br>
GPRS service essentially involves two steps: a first step (called Packet Data Protocol <br>
PDP - context activation) in which a logic connection (the PDF context) is created<br>
between the GPRS MS MSI and the server 120 providing the service contents; and a<br>
second step (called Temporary Block Flow - TBF - activation/release) in which the<br>
cellular network 100 assigns to the GPRS MS MSI prescribed physical communication<br>
resources, namely radio resources for transmission on the "over the air" radio link portion<br>
of the cellular network 100.<br>
In particular, without entering into excessive details well known to those skilled in<br>
the art, the GPRS MS MSI (after having registered at the SGSN serving the cell CELL1<br>
in which the GPRS MS MSI is located at that moment, in the example the SGSN<br>
SGSN1) sends to the SGSN SGSN1 a request for activation of a PDF context; the PDF<br>
context defines the packet data network to be used (in the example, the Internet 105), the<br>
GGSN to be used for accessing the Internet 105 (the GGSN GGSN in the present<br>
example), and other parameters.<br>
The PDF context request triggers a PDF context activation procedure in which the<br>
MS MSI, the SGSN SGSN1 and the GGSN GGSN exchange information useful to<br>
negotiate PDF context parameters.<br>
The PDF context activation procedure results in the definition of a data packets<br>
transfer path between the GGSN GGSN and the PCU servicing the BTS BTS1 that<br>
covers the cell CELL1 in which the MS MSI is located. A PDF context, i.e. a logic<br>
connection between the GPRS MS MSI and the server 120 is thus created.<br>
The activation of the PDF context does not involve per-se the allocation of<br>
physical communication resources of the cellular network 100, but merely establishes a<br>
logic connection between the GPRS MS and the server; thus, the PDF context, once<br>
activated, may be kept active for hours, in principle forever, even when there are no data<br>
to be exchanged between the server 120 and the GPRS MS MSI, until the GPRS MS<br>
MSI (or, possibly, the server 120) deactivates it.<br>
After the PDF context has been activated, the BSC BSC1 checks whether there are<br>
data received from the server 120 through the respective PCU to be transmitted to the<br>
GPRS MS MSI; in the affirmative case, i.e. when there are data to be exchanged between<br>
the server 120 and the GPRS MS MSI, a TBF is activated by the BSC BSC1.<br>
In greater detail, as mentioned in the foregoing, a generic GPRS MS can be in one<br>
of two states, referred to as a READY state and a STAND-BY state; if in STAND-BY, the<br>
competent SGSN is not aware of which cell the MS is in that moment located, but only of<br>
the routing area; a paging message is preliminary sent by the SGSN to the MSs within the<br>
routing area, the message including an identifier of the MS of interest; when the MS<br>
replies to the paging message, the SGSN becomes aware of the cell in which the MS is<br>
located, and can properly route the data packets towards the BSC servicing the MS.<br>
The activation of the TBF determines the allocation of physical radio<br>
communications resources of the cellular network 100, i.e. of a radio channel (an airlink<br>
channel), to the MS MSI for enabling the exchange of the data packets from the data<br>
transfer path (converted in a suitable data stream by the PCU) through the proper BSC<br>
and BTS BSCI and BTSl over the air to the MS MSI.<br>
When the data have been exchanged, the TBF is deactivated and the radio<br>
resources are released; provided the PDF context is not closed, the BSC BSCI waits for<br>
new data to be exchanged. Thus, differently from the PDF context, the TBF, i.e. the<br>
physical, radio communications resources of the GSM network 100 are kept allocated for<br>
the MS MSI only as long as there are data to be transmitted/received to/from it, and are<br>
released as soon as the data have been exchanged, keeping the radio resources free for<br>
other uses/users. In other words, a TBF is temporary and is maintained only for the<br>
duration of the data transfer.<br>
According to the GPRS standard, to each TBF an indicator is univocally assigned,<br>
called Temporary Flow Identity (TFI). Roughly speaking, the TFI is exploited for<br>
managing the scheduling of the data to be transmitted in downlink (i.e., from the BSC and<br>
BTS BSCI and BTSl to the destination MS MSI); different GPRS service users within a<br>
same cell are assigned different TFIs. The TFI allows discriminating between different<br>
entities at the Radio Link Control (RLC) layer, that is, a given TFI univocally addresses a<br>
respective RLC entity and is inserted in a header portion of all the RLC data blocks<br>
transmitted. Typically, the TFI is a five-bit binary number. When the TBF is activated, a<br>
TFI is assigned thereto and such a TFI is communicated to the destination MS MSI by<br>
means of the messages exchanged during the access procedure (through a so-called<br>
PACKET DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT message). The TFI is an identifier of the logic<br>
connection between the BSC and the MS.<br>
At the physical level, the GPRS is based on the physical layer of the GSM<br>
standard.<br>
As known in the art, the GSM standard provides, for the communications between<br>
the BTSs and the MSs, a plurality of radio channels having a bandwidth of 200 KHz,<br>
associated with a plurality of radio carriers; particularly, 124 radio carriers are provided,<br>
and a hybrid Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) / Time Division Multiple<br>
Access (TDMA) access scheme associates a number, e.g. eight, of time slots (physical<br>
channels) with each carrier.<br>
The transmission to/from a given MS takes place discontinuously, only within the<br>
time slot cyclically assigned to that MS; a cycle is the succession in time of all the eight<br>
time slots, and is referred to as a radio frame. Once the MS has been granted access to a<br>
given carrier the transmission and reception are accomplished in distinct time slots.<br>
The physical level used by the GPRS system is based on the GSM one,<br>
superimposing thereto a different logic structure. Control and data traffic "logical"<br>
channels are multiplexed in time and frequency division on a single GPRS physical<br>
channel, called Packet Data CHannel (PDCH).<br>
A PDCH corresponds to a physical GSM channel, and is defined, in the frequency<br>
domain, by a radio carrier number (one of the 124 carriers), and, in the time domain, by a<br>
timeslot number (one of the eight timeslots within that carrier). The timing and duration<br>
of the timeslots are identical to those defined for the GSM system.<br>
The control and data traffic GPRS logical channels are multiplexed in time so as<br>
to share the same PDCH at physical level.<br>
As pictorially shown in Figure 2, given a prescribed radio carrier ("CARRIER<br>
ith" in the drawing), which is one of 124 radio carriers of the GSM standard, the radio<br>
frames (each one including eight time slots TS1 to TS8) are grouped in groups of fiftytwo<br>
radio frames, so as to form a so-called multiframe, such as the multiframe MFRj<br>
depicted in the drawing. Each multiframe is subdivided into twelve frame blocks, such as<br>
the frame block FRB1 shown in the drawing, including each one four radio frames.<br>
Between adjacent triplets of frame blocks, an idle frame IFR is interposed, left<br>
deliberately free of data.<br>
The multiframe periodically repeats every fifty-two radio frames. The different<br>
GPRS control and data traffic logic channels are multiplexed together based on a<br>
subdivision (an operation referred to as segmentation) into blocks (Radio Data Blocks or<br>
RDBs) of the data (received in packets) to be transmitted. The radio data blocks are the<br>
basic transport structure of a GPRS logic channel: a given radio data block is thus<br>
univocally dedicated to a respective GPRS logic channel, being it a data traffic channel or<br>
a control channel. The assignment scheme of the radio data blocks to the different logic<br>
channels is transmitted, together with other control information, over a GPRS control<br>
logic channel PBCCH (Packet Broadcast Control CHannel), having a fixed position<br>
within the multiframe.<br>
As for voice communications, radio transmission takes place as a sequence of four<br>
"normal bursts", according to the GSM standard specification. Every radio data block,<br>
such as the radio data block RDBk shown in the drawing, is transmitted during four<br>
consecutive radio frames of the same PDCH, such as the frames FR1 to FR4 in the<br>
drawing, exploiting one (possibly more, depending on the radio resources allocated to that<br>
logic channel, and on the fact that the MS supports multislot communications, a feature<br>
referred to as the multislot class of the MS) time slot in each frame, such as the timeslot<br>
TS3 in the drawing.<br>
Still according to the GPRS standard, every radio data block includes a header<br>
portion containing the TFI that univocally identifies the TBF, in addition to other<br>
parameters. In this way, two or more traffic flows belonging to different users can be<br>
multiplexed on a same timeslot, or group of timeslots, in downlink or in uplink to or from<br>
the MSs.<br>
Each MS in a cell listens to every radio data block transmitted by the BTS on the<br>
group of timeslots assigned to the MS; however, an MS being destination of GPRS data,<br>
that is an MS such as the MS MSI having activated a PDP context, having been assigned<br>
a TBF, e.g. TBFi, and having been assigned and communicated a respective TFI, e.g.<br>
TFIj (in the practice, the above mentioned five-bit digital code) only captures those radio<br>
data blocks that, similarly to the radio data block RDBk in the drawing, are labeled by that<br>
TFI TFIi, i.e. by the TFI that has previously been communicated thereto, when the TBF<br>
was activated; all the other radio data blocks, not labeled by the correct TFI TFI(, are<br>
discarded by the MS MSI. The TFI is thus used by the MS substantially as a tuning<br>
information, which the MS uses for tuning onto the physical communication channel on<br>
which the GPRS data directed to the MS are transmitted.<br>
In a GPRS network not supporting multicast services, if a different MS in the<br>
same cell as the MS MSI, for example the MS MS2 shown in Figure 1, wishes to<br>
exploit, through the GPRS network, the same services made available by the server 120<br>
as those being already exploited by the MS MSI, a procedure identical to that described<br>
in the foregoing has to be performed, leading to the activation of another PDP context<br>
and, even worse, to the activation of different TBFs when data have to be exchanged with<br>
the MS MSI, i.e. to the allocation of additional radio resources different from those<br>
already allocated by the GSM network 100 for the MS MSI. This is clearly a waste of<br>
resources, especially when the services exploited are relatively heavy in terms of data to<br>
be downloaded to the MSs, such as in the case of delivery of multimedia contents, audio<br>
or video (e.g. real-time contents such as for example television programs) streaming, and<br>
the availability of GPRS services offered to the users may be severely limited, unless the<br>
GSM network infrastructure is greatly overdimensioned.<br>
In order to avoid such a waste of resources, the GPRS network is rendered capable<br>
of supporting multicast service data distribution, in the way described hereinbelow with<br>
the aid of the simplified flowchart 300 of Figure 3.<br>
In a way totally similar to the conventional procedure described above in respect<br>
of a generic GPRS service, when the user of a generic MS, e.g. the MS MSI, asks for a<br>
certain GPRS service which is offered in multicast (in the following simply referred to as<br>
a multicast service), the MS MSI activates a standard, unicast PDF context (hencetoforth<br>
referred to as the default PDF context) (block 305). The GSM/GPRS network component<br>
BSC1 assigns to the MS MSI the downlink (i.e., from the BCS/BTS to the MS) and<br>
uplink (i.e., from the MS to the BTS/BSC) data traffic radio channels, according to<br>
standard procedures carried out at the RLC/MAC levels.<br>
The MS MSI then retrieves the list of available multicast services from a<br>
dedicated server within the packet data network 105, for example (but not necessarily) the<br>
same server 120 offering the multicast services (block 310).<br>
Upon selection by the MS MSI of one of the available multicast services in the<br>
list of available services, for example the multicast service "A", for example a television<br>
(TV) service, the server 120 communicates to the MS MSI an identifier, which can be for<br>
example an Internet Protocol (IP) address, e.g. 244.x.y.z, assigned by the server 120 to the<br>
MS MSI (block 315); this same IP address may be used by the server 120 to identify a<br>
multicast group associated with the GPRS service "A", i.e. a group of MSs which have<br>
requested to exploit/are exploiting the multicast service "A"; such a group is<br>
schematically depicted in Figure 1 as a table 130, related to the multicast service "A" and<br>
intended to include information relating to the users Userl,..., User? that have requested<br>
to exploit/are exploiting the multicast service "A". The server 120 may assign to the<br>
multicast group 130 a Temporary Multicast Group Identity (TMGI), which is assigned to<br>
the multicast group temporarily as long as there is at least one MS in the multicast group.<br>
The MS MSI then sends an IGMP JOIN message (IGMP: Internet Group<br>
Management Protocol) over the default PDF context, to signal its interest in joining the<br>
multicast group related to the selected multicast service "A" (block 320). As known in the<br>
art, the Internet Group Management Protocol is the standard for IP multicasting in the<br>
Internet, used to establish host memberships in particular multicast groups on a single<br>
network.<br>
As a result, a multicast PDF context is set up by the competent GGSN GGSN<br>
(block 325), after having checked that one such multicast PDP context is not already<br>
active (decision block 323, exit branch N).<br>
In particular, the multicast PDP context may be set up following the guidelines for<br>
service activation defined in the already cited 3GPP Technical Specification No. TS<br>
23.246, v6.1.0.<br>
During multicast PDP context set up the GGSN GGSN performs a registration<br>
procedure to the server 120 (block 330). The server 120 gets information about the MS<br>
MSI and stores such information in the table 130 corresponding to the group for<br>
multicast service "A". The GGSN GGSN stores user information in a table (shown<br>
schematically in Figure 1 and identified therein as 135) related to the multicast service<br>
"A" (several of such tables may exist at the GGSN, one for each multicast service for<br>
which a multicast PDP context has been set up). Similarly, the competent SGSN SGSNl,<br>
responsible of the MS MSI, stores user information in a cell-related table (shown<br>
schematically in Figure 1 and identified therein by 140-1 (140-2 identifies an equivalent<br>
cell-related table at the SGSN SGSN2) related to the multicast service "A" (again, several<br>
of such tables may exist at the SGSN, one for each multicast service for which a multicast<br>
PDP context has been set up).<br>
The operations that allow the MS MSI joining the multicast group 130 are<br>
completed, and the default PDP context that was activated by the MS MSI is linked to the<br>
multicast PDP context.<br>
As a part of the operations that lead to the joining of the multicast group, the MS<br>
MSI selects a Network Service Access Point Identifier (NSAPI - an index to the PDP<br>
context that is using the services provided by the lower layer) having a predetermined<br>
value NSAPIjyi (see Figure 6), particularly an NSAPI value that has been reserved for<br>
multicast services.<br>
Let it now be supposed that another MS, for simplicity of description an MS<br>
located in the same cell as the MS MSI, for example the MS MS2, asks for a GPRS<br>
multicast service.<br>
Similarly to MS MSI, the MS MS2 activates a respective standard unicast PDP<br>
context (default PDP Context). The GSM/GPRS network component BSC1 assigns to the<br>
MS MS2 the downlink and uplink traffic radio channels, according to standard<br>
procedures at the RLC/MAC levels (block 305).<br>
As in the previous case, the MS MS2 retrieves from the server 120 the list of<br>
available GPRS multicast services, among which there is the multicast service "A", for<br>
which a multicast PDF context has already been set up (block 310). If the MS MS2<br>
selects the multicast service "A", the server 120 communicates to the MS MS2 the IP<br>
address 244.x.y.z of the corresponding multicast group (block 315).<br>
The MS MS2 then sends an IGMP JOIN message over its default PDP context, to<br>
signal the interest of the MS MS2 in the GPRS multicast service "A" (block 320).<br>
The GGSN GGSN recognizes that a multicast PDP context for the multicast<br>
service "A" is already active (decision block 323, exit branch Y); thus, the GGSN GGSN<br>
does not activate another multicast PDP context, but instead links the new MS MS2 to the<br>
multicast PDP context already existing for the service "A" (block 350). Exception made<br>
for the fact that another multicast PDP context is not activated in the GGSN GGSN,<br>
signaling towards the MS MS2 may occur substantially in the same way as described<br>
before, following the guidelines for service activation defined in 3GPP Technical<br>
Specification No. TS 23.246 v6.1.0.<br>
The GGSN GGSN stores information related to the new user in the table 135<br>
related to the multicast service "A". Similarly, the competent SGSN SGSN1, responsible<br>
of the MS MSI, stores user information in the cell-related table 140-1 related to the<br>
multicast service "A".<br>
The same acts may be performed in case other MSs asks to exploit the multicast<br>
service "A".<br>
After having activated the multicast PDP Context related to service "A" and until<br>
the start of the multicast session (i.e., the sending of the data related to service "A" from<br>
the server 120 to the MSs), the MSs can move, possibly many times, from the READY<br>
state to the STAND-BY state and back, depending on users' activities.<br>
The server 120 initiates the multicast session related to service "A" when it is<br>
ready to send data to the subscribers. A multicast session may be set up following the<br>
guidelines for session activation defined in the above-mentioned 3GPP Technical<br>
Specification No. TS 23.246 v6.1.0 (block 335).<br>
Once the multicast session has been set up, and the server 120 is ready to deliver<br>
the multicast service "A", after a preliminary procedure (that will be explained in the<br>
following) by which the users (e.g., the MSs MSI and MS2) that have registered for<br>
receiving the multicast service "A" are signaled about the imminent start, and the<br>
necessary radio resources are assigned thereto (block 337), the SGSN (e.g., SGSN1)<br>
starts forwarding to the BSC (in the example, the BSC BSC1) data traffic related to<br>
multicast service "A", on the basis of the information found in the respective cell-based<br>
table 140-1 (block 340). In particular, the SGSN SGSN1 receives data traffic from the<br>
GGSN GGSN through a GPRS Tunnel Protocol (GTP) tunnel whose Tunnel Endpoint<br>
IDentifier (TEID) corresponds to the multicast PDP context "A" (only one GTP tunnel,<br>
identified by a unique TEID, is created in respect of a given multicast service). The SGSN<br>
routes the traffic towards the proper (PCU of the) BSC based on a BSSGP Virtual<br>
Connection Identifier (BVCI) (in Figure 1, a BVCI BVCI1 identifies the cell CELL1<br>
under BSC BSC1, a BVCI BVCI2 identifies the cell CELL2 under BSC2, and BVCI<br>
BCI4 identifies the cell CELL4 under BSC2). The TMGI may be used for univocally<br>
identifying the traffic related to the multicast service throughout the network, including<br>
the BSCs and the MSs.<br>
For each network cell, common radio resources are exploited for delivering data<br>
traffic related to the multicast service "A" to all the various MSs of the group for the<br>
multicast service "A" that are located in that cell, and the respective radio parameters are<br>
communicated to the MSs. In particular, a common TFI is assigned by the network and<br>
communicated to the MSs, such as the TFI TFI) that is communicated to the MSs MSI<br>
and MS2 in cell CELL1. Furthermore, at least one common PDCH (preferably, a<br>
plurality of common PDCHs) is assigned by the network and communicated to the MSs.<br>
The data traffic received at the BSC BSC1 in respect of the multicast service "A" is thus<br>
delivered to the MSs MSI and MS2 (block 345).<br>
As mentioned before, the SGSN SGSN1 forwards the data traffic related to<br>
multicast service "A" on the basis of the information contained in the corresponding cellbased<br>
table 140-1, particularly the BVCI. The generic SGSN scans the respective cellrelated<br>
table corresponding to the multicast service "A", and forwards one traffic flow per<br>
each cell identified by the TMGI related to service "A"; for example, assuming that the<br>
MS MS3 in cell CELL2, and the user MSS in the cell CELL4, activated respective<br>
multicast PDP contexts for receiving the multicast service "A", the SGSN SGSN2<br>
forwards the traffic relating to such a service to these users on the shared connection; if<br>
other users in the respective cells, for example the user MS7 in the cell CELL4, ask to<br>
exploit the service "A", the respective SGSN, e.g. the SGSN SGSN2, does not forward<br>
additional traffic, and these other users, e.g. MS7, registered in the SGSN table under the<br>
same BVCI, receive the intended data traffic because they share the same TMGI and, in<br>
the respective cell (CELL4), the same downlink radio parameters PDCH(s) and TFT<br>
assigned for service "A".<br>
In the Applicant's opinion, it is important to guarantee an adequate perception of<br>
the service from the users' point of view. To this purpose, according to the Applicant it ic<br>
important that the network operation mode, at the RLC/MAC level, be an acknowledged<br>
one. This means that it is important for the network apparatuses to be able to establish if<br>
and to what extent the traffic related to the GPRS multicast services is properly received<br>
by the MSs of the users.<br>
The above-described method of implementing multicasting in the GPRS/GSM<br>
network is particularly effective, and avoids unnecessary duplication, i.e. waste, of<br>
network resources, both at the core GPRS network level (no proliferation of data traffic<br>
directed to users in a same cell) and at the physical, radio communication level (a same<br>
number of radio channels are occupied, irrespective of the number of users receiving a<br>
given service).<br>
However, as mentioned in the introductory part of the present description, a<br>
problem related to the above described implementation of multicasting in a GPRS<br>
network is that, being all the MSs in a given cell registered to a same multicast service<br>
multiplexed on the same PDCH(s) on the downlink and addressed via a same TFI, it is not<br>
possible for the network apparatuses to address information, on the downlink, towards a<br>
specific MS of the multicast service group using the TFI.<br>
This impossibility of individually addressing the MSs is, in the Applicant's<br>
opinion, a severe limitation, particularly in respect of the desire of implementing effective<br>
retransmission policies based on the acknowledgment/unacknowledgement of the data<br>
received by the users.<br>
It is observed that, actually, even in a multicast service delivery context such as<br>
the one described in the foregoing, each MS involved in the service might be individually<br>
identified, using an identifier called Temporary Logic Link Identifier (TLLI), which,<br>
roughly speaking, is an identifier of the logic connection established between that MS and<br>
the competent SGSN. The TLLI is communicated to the MS when the MS registers for<br>
the multicast service. In principle, the TLLI might be used for addressing specific<br>
information towards the MSs. However, the TLLI is typically a relatively long number,<br>
for example 32 bits (four bytes) according to the current standards, so that, using the<br>
TLLI for addressing the MSs at the radio link level would mean a great decrease of<br>
available bandwidth for the transmission of data related to the multicast service.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, in order to overcome this<br>
limitation, a further parameter identifying the logic connection between the BSC and the<br>
MS (other than the TFI, which is common for all the MSs involved in multicast service) is<br>
defined and assigned, preferably by the network, to the MSs of a multicast service group,<br>
for specifying and, for example, addressing information to a specific MS among those<br>
which, being located in a same cell, receive in multicast a same GPRS service. In<br>
particular, in order to communicate the further parameter to the MSs, the BSC may<br>
compile a cell-based table of the MSs that have requested a generic multicast service, e.g.<br>
the service "A" herein considered by way of example. Two exemplary tables are<br>
schematically shown in Figure 1, one for each BSC BSC1 and BSC2, and identified<br>
therein by 145-1 or 145-2. Hereinafter, the further parameter will be referred to for<br>
simplicity as the Mobile Flow Identity (MFI).<br>
According to an exemplary and not limitative embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a given MS in a cell that belongs to a multicast service group is addressed by<br>
the network apparatuses by including the respective MFI (preliminary communicated to<br>
the MS according to any one of the exemplary procedures that will be described later on)<br>
in downlink messages, for example within a message carrying the multicast service data.<br>
In particular, a dedicated field may be exploited, which is included, when needed by the<br>
network apparatuses, in a properly extended RLC header of a generic one of the<br>
RLC/MAC radio blocks.<br>
In greater detail, reference is made to Figure 4A, wherein a more detailed pictorial<br>
representation of the structure of a generic GPRS radio data block is provided, in an<br>
exploded view.<br>
The radio data block, globally identified by 400, includes a MAC header 405 and<br>
an RLC data block 407, comprised of an RLC header 410 and an RLC data portion 415,<br>
possibly terminating with one or more spare bits 420 (used, if necessary, as mere fillers<br>
for achieving the prescribed number of bits in the RLC data portion 415).<br>
The MAC header 405 typically includes a first field 425, a second field 430<br>
(Relative Reserved Block Period - RRBP), a third field 435 (Supplementary/Polling -<br>
S/P), and a fourth field 440 (Uplink State Flag - USF).<br>
The first field 425 contains information specifying the payload type, and allows<br>
identifying if the block is a data block (i.e., a block carrying data) or rather a control<br>
block (i.e., a block carrying control information sent by the network to the MS). The<br>
RRBP field 430, if active, is used by the network apparatuses to reserve a single data<br>
block in uplink in which the MS shall transmit a message of the type PACKET<br>
CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGMENT or PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK to the network;<br>
the value in the RRBP field 430 specifies after how many radio data blocks a given MS<br>
(addressed by the network as described in the following) has to reply. The S/P field 435 is<br>
used to indicate to the MSs that a response is required by the network (this field indicates<br>
whether the content of the field RRBP is valid or not). The USF field 440 is normally<br>
used on the PDCH to allow multiplexing of radio blocks from a number of MSs, and<br>
enables the coding of eight different USF states which are used to multiplex the uplink<br>
traffic. According to current standards, the MAC header has a fixed, constant length of<br>
eight bits.<br>
Differently, the RLC header 410 does not have a constant length, its length being<br>
variable depending on the number of Logic Link Control-Packet Data Units (LLC-PDUs)<br>
transported by the respective radio data block.<br>
The RLC header 410 comprises, in addition to other fields per-se known and not<br>
relevant to the understanding of the invention embodiment being described, a field 445<br>
(typically of five bits) containing the TFI labeling the specific radio data block 400, and<br>
one or more octets 450a,..., 450n starting with a Length Indicator (LI) field 455 (of six<br>
bits) that defines the length of a corresponding LLC-PDU in the RLC data portion 415, a<br>
field Extension (E) 460 (of one bit), indicating whether there follows an additional octet<br>
450a,..., 450n in the RLC header 410, and a field More (M) 465 (of one bit as well)<br>
indicating the presence of a further LLC-PDU in the Radio data block.<br>
It is observed that the above-described structure of the RLC header reflects the<br>
specifications for the current GPRS standard. In the current specifications for the<br>
Enhanced GPRS (EGPRS), also known as Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution<br>
(EDGE), using the 8PSK modulation technique to increase the data rate over that typical<br>
of plain GPRS, the structure of the radio data block is slightly different. For example, in<br>
Figure 4B an exploded view of a generic radio data block according to the EGPRS<br>
GMSK code schemes MCS1 to MCS4 is provided. In this case, the first field 425 of the<br>
MAC header 405 contains a part of the TFI (the remaining part being included in the field<br>
445 of the RLC header 410) the RLC data portion 415 of the radio data block 400<br>
includes octets 450a,..., 450n each of which includes a seven-bit Length Indicator (LI)<br>
field 455a, and a one-bit field 465a, equivalent to the E field 465 of Figure 4A. Similar<br>
structures may be found in the EGPRS OMSK code schemes MCS5 to MCS9.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the additional identifier<br>
parameter of the BSC-MS logic connection assigned by the network apparatuses for<br>
individually addressing the MSs of a same multicast group and located in a same network<br>
cell, i.e. the MFI, can be formed by a number of bits equal to or higher than those<br>
necessary for the TFI, but roughly of the same order as the TFI, i.e. typically about five<br>
bits, a number substantially lower than the number of bits used to code the TLLI. In<br>
preferred embodiments, the MFI is formed by a number of bits from five to seven.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the MFI is included in the<br>
RLC data portion 415 of a generic radio data block 400 transporting data related to the<br>
multicast service being distributed.<br>
In order to include the MFI, the RLC header of a radio data block is properly<br>
extended to obtain an extended RLC header. According to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the extension of the RLC header necessary for signaling to the MS that an MFI<br>
is included in the RLC header is accomplished by setting the LI field 455 in one of the<br>
octets 450a,..., 450n, to a predetermined value, for example LI = 55 in GPRS and LI - 75<br>
in EGPRS. The extended RLC header includes therefore an octet 450a,..., 450n with the<br>
Length Indicator field set to the prescribed value, plus the MFI.<br>
Concerning the way in which the MFI is assigned and communicated by the<br>
network to the MSs, some possible MFI assignment procedures are hereinafter described<br>
in detail, being however intended that these procedures are merely exemplary, and are not<br>
to be intended as limitative for the present invention.<br>
According to a first assignment procedure (Figure 8A), when the multicast<br>
session (hereinafter, the MBMS session) for the service "A" is going to start, the generic<br>
SGSN, e.g. the SGSN SGSN1, sends an MBMS SESSION START request to the BSSs<br>
under its responsibility, such as that including the BSC BSC1, based on the cell/routing<br>
area information that the SGSN retrieves from the respective table 140-1. This event<br>
triggers a sequence of procedures at the radio level, that will be described in the<br>
following.<br>
After the reception of the MBMS SESSION START request, for each MS involved<br>
in that MBMS session, a PACKET PAGING request is delivered by the BSC to the MSs.<br>
As mentioned in the foregoing, when the MBMS session is going to start a generic<br>
MS can be in STAND-BY or in READY state; the READY state is further characterized by<br>
two modes, called PACKET IDLE and PACKET TRANSFER: in the PACKET<br>
TRANSFER mode, the MS is exchanging data traffic, while the PACKET IDLE mode is<br>
entered when the data traffic exchange terminates; after a prescribed time interval, the MS<br>
moves into the STAND-BY state.<br>
As far as an MS in STAND-BY state or READY state and packet idle mode is<br>
concerned, the PACKET PAGING request is for example delivered on the Common<br>
Control CHannel (CCCH) (or, if available, on the Packet Common Control CHannel -<br>
PCCCH), and the PACKET PAGING request is followed by an MBMS NOTIFICATION<br>
message, including information related to the start of the requested MBMS service "A";<br>
upon reception, the MS sends to the BSC a CHANNEL request, for example on the<br>
Random Access CHannel (RACK) (alternatively, if the PCCCH is available, the MS maysend<br>
to the BSC a PACKET CHANNEL request on the Packet Random Access CHannel -<br>
PRACH), with paging response as an establishment cause. The BSC sends an<br>
IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT on the Access Grant CHannel (AGCH) (or, if PCCCH is<br>
available, a PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT on Packet Access Grant CHannel -<br>
PAGCH). The MS is thus assigned a temporary PDCH; on the assigned temporary<br>
PDCH, the MS sends the PACKET PAGING response, including its respective TLLI. The<br>
BSS delivers the message including the TLLI to the competent SGSN.<br>
Slightly differently, an MS in READY state and PACKET TRANSFER mode may<br>
already have an active downlink TBF or an active uplink TBF, or both. In this case, the<br>
MS can receive the PACKET PAGING request on, for example, the Packet Associated<br>
Control CHannel (PACCH), i.e. the dedicated control channel associated with the<br>
downlink PDCH assigned to the MS. The BSC also sends the MBMS NOTIFICATION<br>
message: if an uplink TBF is active, the MS sends the PACKET PAGING response,<br>
including the respective TLLI, which is delivered by the BSC to the SGSN. If an uplink<br>
TBF is not active, the MS can request a concurrent TBF within a first occurrence of a<br>
PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message related to the active service. The BSC sends<br>
a PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message or a PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE<br>
message to the MS on the PACCH, to assign a temporary PDCH. On the assigned<br>
temporary PDCH(s), the MS sends the PACKET PAGING response, including the<br>
respective TLLI, which is delivered by the BSC to the SGSN. The uplink TBF, already<br>
active in the former case or just established for delivering the PACKET PAGING response<br>
in the latter case, is kept alive by the MS, for example sending dummy RLC data blocks if<br>
necessary, until the MS receives an MBMS ASSIGNMENT message by the BSC.<br>
The MBMS ASSIGNMENT message can be sent by the BSC on different channels,<br>
depending on the state of the MSs. In particular, the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message can<br>
be sent, for example, on the CCCH (or on the PCCCH, if available) for all the MSs in<br>
STAND-BY state or in READY state and in PACKET IDLE mode, while for each MS in<br>
READY state and in PACKET TRANSFER mode the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message can<br>
be sent, for example, on the PACCH.<br>
By means of the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message, the BSC performs a resource<br>
allocation for allowing the MSs to exploit the MBMS service. In particular, the TFI and<br>
the downlink PDCH(s) related to the data transmission for the requested service "A" are<br>
included in the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message. Furthermore, a TBF starting time is also<br>
included in the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message, i.e. a parameter allowing the MSs<br>
determining the time delay between the resource allocation and the resource availability.<br>
In particular, the TBF starting time is set to a suitable value, sufficient for reasonably<br>
allowing the BSC to deliver the respective MFI parameter to the MSs, according to a<br>
procedure explained in the following, triggered by the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message<br>
itself.<br>
The MBMS ASSIGNMENT message may in principle be sent once; however,<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention, the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message<br>
is preferably sent more than once, particularly twice or more, more preferably five times,<br>
in order to overcome possible radio impairments leading to message loss on the MSs side<br>
(corresponding to a BLock Error Rate - BLER - equal to 80%).<br>
To get the MFI, on reception of the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message, each MS<br>
involved in the specified MBMS session that entered in STAND-BY state or in READY<br>
state and in PACKET IDLE mode before the reception of the message, performs a onephase<br>
access procedure on the CCCH (or on the PCCCH, if available), in order to get<br>
radio resources for a further uplink temporary TBF, e.g. via an IMMEDIATE<br>
ASSIGNMENT (PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT if PCCCH is available). On the<br>
assigned temporary uplink TBF (which is characterized by a respective TFI, hereinafter<br>
referred to as UPLINK_TFI), the MS sends dummy RLC data blocks, with an extended<br>
RLC header including its TLLI, for contention resolution and identification purposes, and<br>
furthermore including the TMGI of the service "A"; the RLC header extension may be<br>
accomplished by setting predefined values in the LI field of the RLC header (in one of the<br>
octets 450a,..., 450n of the RLC data block), such as, for example, LI = 56 in GPRS and<br>
LI = 76 in EGPRS. The extended RLC header will therefore include Length Indicator(s) +<br>
TLLI + TMGI.<br>
An MS, involved in the specified MBMS, which is in READY state and PACKET<br>
TRANSFER mode before the reception of the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message, on<br>
reception of such a message sends, on the already available uplink TBF (which is<br>
characterized by an UPLINK_TFI), and, RLC data blocks, possibly dummy, with the<br>
same extended RLC header as described above (including the MS's TLLI and the TMGI<br>
related to the service "A").<br>
As soon as the BSC receives from one of the MS the first correct RLC data block<br>
including the UPLINK_TFI plus the TLLI plus the TMGI, the BSC sends a PACKET<br>
UPLINK ACK/NACK message to that MS, addressing it via the UPLINKJTFI and a<br>
content-resolution TLLI (i.e., a TLLI selected by the BSC from all those received,<br>
according to a contention resolution procedure), further including in the message the<br>
TMGI received from the MS. With this message, the BSC communicates the assigned<br>
MFI to the MS. According to an embodiment of the present invention, together with the<br>
MFI, additional parameters used for synchronizing the radio transmission are sent with<br>
this message, for example a Timing Advance Index (TAI) and a Timing Advance<br>
Timeslot Number (TA_TN), used for allowing the MS to perform a Timing Advance<br>
(TA) procedure. Such additional parameters are individually assigned by the BSC to that<br>
specific MS, and for this reason will be referred to as MFI_TAI and MFI_TA_TN.<br>
Without entering into excessive details, known per-se, the TA procedure is a<br>
procedure by means of which the BSC gets information about the distance of a generic<br>
MS from the BTS, and thus of the propagation delay of the radio signal from the BTS to<br>
the MS, and communicates to the MS information adapted to let the MS synchronize with<br>
the transmission. The TAI is an index assigned by the BSC to the MS, while the TATN<br>
is a parameter specifying which timeslot carries the synchronization information; when<br>
the MS recognizes its own TAI in a received data block, it looks at the timeslot specified<br>
by the TA_TN parameter and gets the TA synchronization parameter.<br>
The fields that are sent by the BSC to the MS via the PACKET UPLINK<br>
ACK/NACKmessage, i.e. the TMGI, the MFI, the MFI_TAI, and the MFI_TA_TN are for<br>
example included in the message using padding bits.<br>
Once the MS has received from the BSC the PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK<br>
message including the triplet {MFI, MFI_TAI, MFI_TA_TN}, the MS starts a countdown<br>
procedure, at the end of which the temporary uplink TBF is released. The countdown<br>
procedure is directed to acknowledge the BSC about the correct reception of the triplet<br>
{MFI, MFIJTAI, MFI_TA_TN} by the MS, and, correspondingly, to make the MS aware<br>
of the fact that the BSC has acknowledged such correct reception. Roughly speaking, the<br>
countdown procedure may involve, from the MS side, sending to the BSC, for a<br>
prescribed number of times, e.g. 10 times, data blocks including the same parameters<br>
received from the BSC, i.e. the triplet {MFI, MFIJTAI, MFI_TA_TN}, which are<br>
interpreted by the BSC as a confirmation of the reception, and looking for a counter-reply<br>
from the BSC.<br>
In greater detail, the parameters sent from the MS to the BSC may be included in<br>
extension fields of the RLC data block header, the extension being accomplished setting<br>
the field LI in one of the octets 450a,..., 450n to a first predefined value (for example, LI<br>
= 55 for GPRS; LI = 75 for EGPRS) for including the MFI, and setting the field LI in<br>
another octet to another predefined value (for example, LI = 59 for GPRS and LI = 79 for<br>
EGPRS) for including the MFIJTAI and the MFI_TA_TN). If the BSC does not receive<br>
at least one of these RLC data blocks including the assigned {MFI, MFIJTAI,<br>
MFI_TA_TN} from the MS within a prescribed time interval, the BSC sends again the<br>
PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK message to the MS, with the same fields included in the<br>
first transmission, i.e. the BSC re-sends the triplet of parameters {MFI, MFI_TAI,<br>
MFI_TA_TN}.<br>
Once the uplink TBF has been released, both the MS and the BSC store the triplet<br>
{MFI, MFI_TAI, MFI_TA_TN} to be used by that MS and by the BSC during the<br>
MBMS session. In particular, the BSC stores, for each MS, the triplet {MFI, MFIJTAI,<br>
MFI_TA_TN} in a table (identified as 145-1 for the BSC BSC1, and 145-2 for the BSC<br>
BSC2 in Figure 1), in association with the TLLI of that MS.<br>
The procedure described above is repeated for all the MSs involved in a specified<br>
service, e.g. the service "A". With such procedure, the BSC becomes aware of the number<br>
of MSs involved in the reception of the service "A", and may address information to such<br>
MSs, exploiting the MFI identifier. For example, efficient ack/nack procedures may be set<br>
by the BSC.<br>
It is observed that, in practice, the values available for the parameter MFI are<br>
limited: for example, if the parameter MFI is represented by a five-bit digital code, thirtytwo<br>
values are available. In preferred embodiments, the procedure described above may<br>
be repeated until the last but one valid MFI value is available on the BSC side. Then, the<br>
last available MFI value is assigned to all the remaining MSs as a default, fake MFI<br>
(hereinafter MFI_fake), in the PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK message sent by the BSC<br>
to each of these MSs; however, differently from the messages sent to the previous MSs,<br>
within these messages the fields MFI_TAI and the MFI_TA_TN are not included.<br>
It is observed that the list of MSs which are addressed by the BSC does not<br>
necessarily remain the same for the whole MBMS session, and it can be modified during<br>
the MBMS session, with exits of some or all of the MSs previously present and entries of<br>
new MSs, for example chosen from the pool of MSs counted by the BSS and to which the<br>
MFI_fake was assigned. If, during the MBMS session, a triplet {MFI, MFI_TAI,<br>
MFI_TATN} is freed and becomes available on the BSC side for a new MS, the default<br>
parameter MFI_fake and the respective TLLI may be used by the BSC to address a<br>
specific MS, in order to assign thereto the available triplet {MFI, MFI_TAI,<br>
MFI_TA_TN}.<br>
Similarly to the previous MSs, once each MS exceeding the last but one valid MFI<br>
value available on the BSC side has received the PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK message<br>
including the parameter MFI_fake, it start the countdown procedure at the end of which<br>
the uplink TBF is released. The countdown procedure is accomplished as described in the<br>
foregoing: the MS includes the MFI_fake in all the following RLC data blocks sent to the<br>
BSC by way of reception confirmation, in order to notify the BSS of the correct reception<br>
of this field. The extension of the RLC data block header can be for example<br>
accomplished setting, in one of the RLC header octets, a predefined value, such as for<br>
example LI = 57 for GPRS and LI = 77 for EGPRS. If the BSC does not receive at least<br>
one RLC data block including the assigned default MFI_fake from the MS within a<br>
prescribed time limit, the BSC sends again the PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK message to<br>
the MS, with the same fields included in the case of the first transmission.<br>
Once the uplink TBF has been released, both the MS and the BSC store the<br>
MFI_fake. The BSC stores the MFI-fake in the respective table 145-1 or 145-2, in<br>
association with the TLLI of that MS.<br>
If a generic MS (with "real" MFI or with MFI_fake) does not succeed in releasing<br>
the uplink TBF before the MBMS session TBF starting time (i.e., before the MBMS<br>
resources become available), that MS switches anyway to the assigned PDCH(s) for the<br>
multicast service at the time specified by the TBF starting time.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the procedure hereinafter<br>
described is followed.<br>
For example, the uplink TBF couldn't be released because the MS did not<br>
received the expected PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK messages from the BSC before the<br>
TBF starting time, so that such MS did not receive a respective triplet {MFI, MFIJTAI,<br>
MFI_TA_TN}. In such case, if the MS succeeded in sending at least one RLC data block<br>
including the respective TLLI and the TMGI to the BSC, the MS assumes, by default, the<br>
MFI_fake. On the other hand, if the BSC has received from that MS at least one RLC data<br>
block including the TLLI and the TMGI, the BSC associates (in the table 145-1, or 145-<br>
2), by default, the MFI_fake to the TLLI of that MS, regardless of the fact that the BSS<br>
succeeded or not in sending a PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK message to that MS and, in<br>
case it succeeded, regardless of the fact that the PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK message<br>
included the triplet {MFI, MFIJTAI, MFI_TA_TN} or the default MFI_fake. In the other<br>
cases the BSC is not aware of this MS involved in the multicast service.<br>
Differently, if the MS has received from the BSC a PACKET UPLINK<br>
ACK/NACK message including the triplet {MFI, MFIJTAI, MFI_TA_TN} or the default<br>
MFI_fake before the TBF starting time, but the countdown procedure didn't complete<br>
properly, the MS anyway stores the MFI_fake, regardless of the fact that it succeeded or<br>
not in sending to the BSC at least one following RLC data block including the received<br>
triplet {MFI, MFIJTAI, MFI_TA_TN| or the default MFI_fake, respectively. On the<br>
other hand, the BSC associates (in the respective table 145-1 or 145-2) the default<br>
MFI_fake to the TLLI of that MS.<br>
Exemplarily, Figure 1 shows the table 145-1 held by the BSC BSC1, including<br>
the radio parameters of the downlink radio connections for the MSs MSI and MS2, in<br>
particular, the TFI identifying the radio data blocks through which the (E)GPRS multicast<br>
service is multicast in downlink through the cell CELL1, and, for each MS, the TLLI, in<br>
addition to further parameters, particularly the MFI for that MS, preferably the triplet<br>
{MFI, MFIJTAI, MFI TA_TN}, or the MFI_fake.<br>
29<br>
For the sake of completeness, it has to be observed that if an MS involved in the<br>
multicast service was not able to establish an uplink TBF after the reception of the MBMS<br>
ASSIGNMENT message from the BSC and before the TBF starting time, the MS may<br>
anyway switch to the assigned PDCH(s) for the multicast service at the time specified by<br>
the TBF starting time. In such case, such an MS does not have a triplet {MFI, MFIJTAI,<br>
MFI_TA_TN}, nor the default MFI_fake. Moreover, the BSC is not aware of this MS<br>
involved in the multicast service. However, such an MS may anyway enjoy the multicast<br>
service.<br>
In the MFI assignment procedure described above, the MFI (and the other<br>
parameters for TA update) are communicated by the BSC to the MSs on request of the<br>
latter ones, which, after receiving the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message from the BSC, have<br>
to send to the BSC a request message before the data traffic related to the multicast<br>
service starts to be delivered. Also, the BSC is substantially transparent to the initial<br>
PACKET PAGING response from the MSs, which is directed to the competent SGSN.<br>
An alternative MFI assignment procedure, in which the response to the PAGING<br>
is directly captured by the BSC, may be the following (Figure 8B).<br>
When the multicast session is going to start, the PACKET PAGING request to the<br>
MSs is triggered by the SGSN to the BSC(s). As far as an MS in STAND-BY state or in<br>
READY state and PACKET IDLE mode is concerned, on reception of the PACKET<br>
PAGING request, for example on the CCCH (or on the PCCCH if available), and of the<br>
MBMS NOTIFICATION message, that MS sends a CHANNEL Request on the RACK (or<br>
a PACKET CHANNEL request on the PRACH, if the PCCCH is available). The BSC<br>
sends an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT on the AGCH (or a PACKET UPLINK<br>
ASSIGNMENT on the PAGCH, if the PCCCH is available). On the assigned temporary<br>
PDCH, the MS sends to the BSC a MBMS SERVICE request, including in the message the<br>
respective TLLI and the TMGI identifying the multicast group. The temporary uplink<br>
TBF established for delivering the MBMS SERVICE request is kept alive by the MS,<br>
sending dummy RLC data blocks if necessary, until the MS receives from the BSC a<br>
PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK message including the MFI, preferably the triplet {MFI,<br>
MFIJTAI, MFI_TA_TN}, or the MFI_fake, assigned by the BSC to that specific MS.<br>
As far as an MS in READY state and PACKET TRANSFER mode is concerned,<br>
such an MS may already have an active downlink TBF or an active uplink TBF or both.<br>
The MS may receive the PACKET PAGING request on the downlink PACCH (the<br>
downlink packet control channel associated with the downlink PDCH of that MS). The<br>
BSC also sends the MBMS NOTIFICATION message. If an uplink TBF is already active,<br>
the MS sends the MBMS SERVICE request, including its TLLI and the TMGI, to the<br>
BSC. In the negative case, the MS can request a concurrent TBF within a first occurrence<br>
of a PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message related to the active service; the BSC<br>
sends a PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT or a PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE to<br>
the MS on the PACCH; on the assigned PDCH(s) the MS sends the MBMS SERVICE<br>
request, including its TLLI and the TMGI, to the BSC. The uplink TBF, already active in<br>
the former case or just established for delivering the MBMS SERVICE request in the latter<br>
case, is kept alive by the MS, sending dummy RLC data blocks if necessary, until the MS<br>
receives a PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK message including the triplet {MFI, MFIJTAI,<br>
MFI_TA_TN}, or the MFI_fake, assigned by the BSC to that specific MS.<br>
As soon as the BSC receives the MBMS SERVICE request from an MS, the BSC<br>
sends a PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK to that MS, addressing it via the respective<br>
UPLINK_TFI and the contention-resolution TLLI, and including the TMGI received from<br>
the MS, as well as 'the triplet {MFI, MFIJTAI, MFI_TA_TN} assigned by the BSS to that<br>
specific MS; these four additional fields (TMGI, MFI, MFIJTAI, MFI_TA_TN) may be<br>
included, for example, using padding bits inside the PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK<br>
message.<br>
Once the MS has received the PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK message including<br>
the triplet {MFI, MFI_TAI, MFI_TA_TN}, it starts the countdown procedure in order to<br>
release the uplink TBF. This is carried out as described in detail with reference to Figure<br>
8A.<br>
The above procedure is repeated for all the MSs involved in a specified multicast<br>
service, and at most until the last but one valid MFI value is available on the BSC side. If<br>
more MSs are involved, within a single cell, in the specified MBMS, the last available<br>
MFI value is assigned to all these MSs as a default MFIJake in the PACKET UPLINK<br>
ACK/NACK message sent to each of these MSs; these PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK<br>
messages do not include the MFI_TAI and the MFI_TA_TN fields. A similar countdown<br>
procedure is started by each MS that has received the MFI_fake.<br>
The BSC then sends the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message, including the TFI, the<br>
PDCH(s) and the TBF starting time of the service "A", for example on the CCCH (or on<br>
the PCCCH if available), for all the MSs in STANDBY state or in READY state and in<br>
PACKET IDLE mode, or on the PACCH for each MS in READY state and in PACKET<br>
TRANSFER mode. As explained before, the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message may be<br>
preferably sent more than once, for example for five times, in order to overcome potential<br>
radio impairments leading to message loss on the MSs side.<br>
If the uplink TBF used for delivering the MBMS SERVICE request is not released<br>
before the TBF starting time included in the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message, the MS<br>
anyway switches to the assigned PDCH(s) for the multicast service at the time specified<br>
by the TBF starting time. A procedure similar to that described with reference to Figure<br>
8A may be followed.<br>
It can be appreciated that in this alternative MFI assignment procedure, the MSs<br>
reply to the paging request by a MBMS SERVICE request, to which the BSC<br>
automatically replies communicating the MFI (and, preferably, the additional parameters<br>
MFIJTAI and MFI_TA_TN) to the MSs; this is done before the assignment of the<br>
resources for the multicast service. The MBMS SERVICE request stops at the BSC, so that<br>
the BSC may directly perform the count of the MSs involved in the multicast service "A".<br>
On the other hand, the SGSN is in this case not aware of which MSs of the multicast<br>
service group are at a given time actually exploiting the service.<br>
As a further alternative (Figure 8B, dash-and-dot line), once an MS has sent the<br>
MBMS SERVICE request, including its TLLI and the TMGI, to the BSC, the BSC<br>
additionally delivers the MBMS SER VICE request the competent SGSN, which is thus<br>
made aware of which MSs are exploiting the service.<br>
Any one of the above described procedures allows the BSC to perform both the<br>
counting and the individual addressing of the MSs involved in a specified multicast<br>
service, e.g. the service "A" (characterized by a TMGI TMGI-A). Thus, the BSC is<br>
aware of the number of users involved in the multicast service, and can selectively update<br>
the timing advance for the different MSs, in addition to implementing effective<br>
retransmissions policies. During the MBMS session, the MFI assigned and communicated<br>
to a given MS is used by the BSC to address information to that MS; similarly, the MS<br>
uses the MFI assigned and communicated thereto for allowing the BSC recognizing that<br>
MS among all the MSs involved in that MBMS session. During the MBMS session, the<br>
MFIJTAI and the MFI_TA_TN are used by the MS and by the BSC for the continuous<br>
TA update procedure. The TN specified by MFI_TA_TN identifies one PDCH belonging<br>
to the set of PDCHs allocated for that MBMS session. It is noticed that up to sixteen MSs<br>
may be addressed on the same PDCH, since up to sixteen MSs may adjust the TA on the<br>
same PDCH via MFI_TAI, with a standard continuous TA update procedure.<br>
Concerning the users to which the default MFI_fake has been assigned, the BSC<br>
can count the exceeding MSs, even if it can not individually address them, either for the<br>
retransmissions management or for TA update. However, even the mere counting of such<br>
MSs may be of help in order to correctly tune retransmission policies in an ack/nack<br>
procedure. For example, if continuous retransmission of radio data blocks is needed from<br>
an MS to which a "real" MFI value has been assigned, the BSC may recognize that the<br>
reception quality of such MS is very poor. For example, the MS may be located on the<br>
border of the cell, a fact that may be also checked from the values of the additional<br>
parameters MFIJTAI and MFI_TA_TN. Thus, the BSC may decide to "free" the already<br>
assigned MFI, e.g. by assigning to such MS the MFI_fake, and to assign the available<br>
MFI value to one of the MSs to which the MFI_fake was previously assigned (by<br>
addressing this MS using its TLLI), in order to gain efficiency of the retransmission<br>
policy.<br>
The provision of the parameter MFI in addition to the TFI gives rise to a global<br>
address parameter, or global identifier {TFI,MFI}, that allows the network apparatuses,<br>
namely the generic BSC, to address a specific MS among those involved in the multicast<br>
service "A" inside a specific network cell.<br>
The possibility of individually addressing the MSs in a cell even if they belong to<br>
a same multicast group opens the way to several different exploitations, and in particular<br>
enables the network to implement an efficient multicast data retransmission policy based<br>
on the ACKnowledgment/uNACKnowledgement (ACK/NACK) of the received data by<br>
the MSs.<br>
An ACK/NACK-based retransmission policy according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention will now be explained in detail, with the aid of the schematic flowchart<br>
of FigureS.<br>
In order to better understand the ACK/NACK-based retransmission policy,<br>
reference is made to Figure 6, schematically showing, in an extremely simplified way<br>
and in terms of functional blocks relevant to the understanding of the exemplary invention<br>
embodiment herein considered, a generic MS such as the MS MSI. As known, an MS<br>
comprises, in addition to specific elements allowing radio communications, a<br>
programmable data processing unit, particularly a microprocessor, with dynamic and non-<br>
volatile memory resources, and strictly interacting with a Subscriber Identity Module<br>
(SIM), which is a removable smart-card module having its own data processing and<br>
storage capabilities. It is intended that at least some of the functions that will be described<br>
are implemented in terms of software run by the data processing units of the MS and/or of<br>
the SIM.<br>
The MS MSI comprises a physical layer unit 605 handling the low-level (physical<br>
level) details of the radio communications, compliant to the GSM standard; this unit<br>
comprises in particular the transmitter/receiver circuits of the MS.<br>
The physical level unit 605 communicates with an RLC/MAC (Media Access<br>
Control) level unit 610, managing the communications at the immediately higher<br>
RLC/MAC level of the ISO OSI model, particularly controlling the access of the MS to<br>
the physical communication medium. In extremely simplified terms, sufficient for the<br>
purposes of the present description, the RLC/MAC level unit 610 receives the radio data<br>
blocks from physical level unit 605, and reconstructs the various GPRS logic channels<br>
mentioned in the foregoing. In particular, the RLC/MAC level unit compares (as<br>
schematized by the AND logic gate 615) the TFI labeling the received radio data blocks<br>
to the locally-stored tuning TFI TFIj, which the MS uses for establishing whether the<br>
radio data blocks are directed thereto, and are therefore to be captured and retained, or<br>
discarded. If the TFI labeling the received radio data blocks does not coincide with the<br>
tuning TFI TFI], the radio data blocks are discarded (as schematized by the switch 620<br>
open), otherwise they are captured, the data traffic channel is reconstructed, and the data<br>
are passed over to the higher levels of the OSI model 625, up to the OSI application layer.<br>
The received data relating to the GPRS service are then passed to an application<br>
software 630, such as a content viewer or an MP3 player or the like and, through the<br>
proper I/O peripheral (display, loudspeaker, headphones), are made available to the user<br>
(alternatively, or in combination, the data may be stored in a local storage of the MS, for a<br>
background fruition).<br>
As schematized by a switch 635, depending on whether or not the field S/P 435 in<br>
the received radio data block is set, and the LI field 455 (or 455a) in one of the octets<br>
450a,..., 450n is set to one of the predetermined values, the MFI is extracted from the<br>
received radio data block, and compared (as schematized by the AND logic gate 640) to a<br>
locally-stored, personal MFI MFIi, received from the BSC e.g. through one of the<br>
assignment procedures described above. In case of coincidence, an ACK/NACK manager<br>
640 manages the ACK/NACK operations.<br>
Back to the flowchart 500, at the start of the MBMS session the network<br>
apparatuses assign to each MS (belonging to a multicast service group) a respective MFI,<br>
as described in the foregoing, univocally identifying the MS. The generic MS thus knows<br>
which is the respective MFI that the network (namely, the BSC) has univocally assigned<br>
thereto.<br>
Let it now be assumed that the generic BSC of the network, for example the BSC<br>
BSC1, wants to address a specific one of the MSs under its responsibility, which are<br>
located in a same cell and are at the time receiving a same multicast service, in the<br>
example one among the MSs MSI and MS2 in the cell CELL1, e.g. the MS MS2, in<br>
respect of the service "A".<br>
The BSC BSC1 sets the LI field 455a in one of the octets 450a,..., 450n within the<br>
RLC header 410 of a generic RLC/MAC block 400, sent on the downlink to the<br>
predetermined value, e.g. 75), and sets the field MFI 470 with the desired MFI,<br>
corresponding to the MS to be addressed, retrieved from the table 145-1.<br>
Such a block 400 may for example be one of the radio data blocks delivering the<br>
data relating to the multicast service "A".<br>
Additionally, the BSC BSC1 sets the S/P field 435 and RRBP field 430 within the<br>
MAC header 405 of that RLC/MAC block 400.<br>
All these operations are schematized by action block 505 in the flowchart 500.<br>
In this way, the network apparatuses address the specific MS MS2, via the<br>
respective global identifier {TFI,MFI} in the radio data block RLC header 415, and<br>
instruct the addressed MS MS2 to send a PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message on<br>
the uplink to the BSC BSC1, at a time specified in the RRBP field 430.<br>
It is observed that the network ACK/NACK request period shall be properly<br>
selected, in order to avoid stall conditions of the transmit window on the BSC side. In<br>
particular, the request period depends on GPRS or EGPRS use, the number of PDCHs<br>
allocated to the MBMS session, the window size in case of EGPRS, the number of MSs<br>
involved in the MBMS session, the BS_CV_MAX and the RRBP values. With an<br>
appropriate selection of the parameters, it is possible to receive the PACKET DOWNLINK<br>
ACK/NACK message from the maximum number of MSs which can be multiplexed on a<br>
PDCH and controlled via the continuous TA update procedure, i.e. 16, still avoiding a<br>
stall condition of the transmit window on the BSS side. In such a way, all the MSs having<br>
been assigned a respective triplet {MFI, MFI_TAI, MFI_TA_TN} can periodically send<br>
the PACKETDOWNLINK ACK/NACK message.<br>
Back to the flowchart 500, the generic MS in the cell CELL1 reads the RLC<br>
header 410 of the radio data block 400 transmitted in the downlink, and extracts the TFI<br>
(block 510).<br>
The generic MS then checks whether the extracted TFI coincides with the one<br>
previously communicated thereto by the BSC (decision block 515).<br>
In the negative case (exit branch N of decision block 515), the MS discards the<br>
radio data block (block 520).<br>
In the affirmative case (exit branch Y of decision block 515) the MS checks<br>
(decision block 525) whether the S/P field 435 in the MAC header 405 is set, and the LI<br>
fields are set to the predetermined values (LI = 55 for GPRS or LI = 75 for EGPRS),<br>
indicating that the network is addressing a specific MS to request an ACK/NACK<br>
therefrom. In the negative case (exit branch N of decision block 525), the MS processes<br>
the received radio data block as usual, particularly for retrieving the RLC data (block<br>
530). In the affirmative case (exit branch Y of decision block 525), the MS reads the field<br>
MFI 470 (the presence of which is signaled to the MS by the fact that the fields LI in the<br>
RLC header store the predetermined value 55 (GPRS) or 75(EGPRS)), to retrieve the<br>
MFI value stored therein (block 535).<br>
The MS then checks whether the retrieved MFI coincides with the stored MFI,<br>
previously communicated to the MS by the BSC (decision block 540). In the negative<br>
case, the MS processes the received radio data block as usual (block 530), otherwise (exit<br>
branch Y of decision block 540) the MS understands that it has been addressed by the<br>
network and requested to perform an ACK/NACK of the received data.<br>
The MS MS2 addressed via the global identifier {TFI,MFI} in the way described<br>
above sends the PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message in the uplink radio block<br>
period specified by the value in the RRBP field 430 (block 545). The MS may include its<br>
MFI in the PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message using part of the padding bits of<br>
the message, in order to let the BSC detect the correct identity of the responding MS. For<br>
example, the PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACKmessage may be sent to the BSC on the<br>
uplink PACCH, common to all the MSs involved in the MBMS session, which is the<br>
associated control channel associated with the downlink PDCH(s) used to deliver the<br>
multicast service to the MSs.<br>
Without entering into details well known to the specialists, the PACKET<br>
DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message has a standard format and a predefined length<br>
(typically, 160 bit), and, among the other fields, includes the TFI of the sender MS, and<br>
an ACK/NACK description comprising a map of the received data blocks (the so-called<br>
Received Block Bitmap - RBB) useful to provide the BSC with an indication on the<br>
correct reception of the data blocks in a transmit window.<br>
The MS MS2 includes the personal MFI MFI2 in the PACKET DOWNLINK<br>
ACK/NACK message; in this way, when the BSC BSC1 receives the message, it is<br>
capable (referring to the table 145-1) to assess the correct identity of the responding MS<br>
MS2 among those of the multicast group within the same cell CELL1, sharing the same<br>
TFI TFIj. In particular, part of the so-called padding bits normally provided in the<br>
message (for achieving the predetermined message length of 160 bits) are exploited to<br>
include the MFI in the PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message (as schematically<br>
depicted in Figure 7).<br>
The BSC BSC1 processes (block 550) all the PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK<br>
messages received within a request period from all the MSs involved in a specific<br>
multicast service, and with an assigned individual triplet {MFI, MFI_TAI,<br>
MFI_TA_TN}, in the example the MSs MSI and MS2 as far as cell CELL1 is<br>
concerned, in respect of service "A" (a similar polling is performed on the MSs of other<br>
cells under the responsibility of the BSC).<br>
Based on the ACK/NACK messages received from the MSs, the BSC implements<br>
a retransmission policy of the data relating to the multicast service "A" to the MSs (block<br>
555).<br>
Several retransmission policies can be implemented at the BSC level, the specific<br>
nature of the retransmission policy being per-se not limitative of the present invention.<br>
In particular, and just by way of example, two types of retransmission policies are<br>
feasible, defined exhaustive and selective, respectively.<br>
In the exhaustive retransmission policy, all the radio data blocks referred to as not<br>
acknowledged (shortly, nacked) in the RBB of the ACK/NACK description in any<br>
received PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message are retransmitted. In such a case,<br>
the delay due to the retransmissions could be remarkable; it is therefore necessary to<br>
correctly evaluate the buffer size of the application software 630 resident in the MS and<br>
allowing the user to exploit the received service (e.g., a TV viewer, and/or music<br>
multimedia player), in order to avoid/minimize potential service interruptions.<br>
The procedures at the RLC level on the network side needs to be modified,<br>
compared to standard procedures, in order to periodically set the start of the transmit<br>
window corresponding to the least recent radio block not yet positively acknowledged<br>
among all the received PACKETDOWNLINK ACK/NACK messages, and not on a single<br>
PA CKETDO WNLINK ACK/NACK message basis.<br>
In the selective retransmission approach, the retransmission may be based on the<br>
overall number of nacked radio data blocks, on a threshold relevant to the percentage of<br>
MSs requesting the retransmission of a specific radio data block, and, possibly, on the<br>
MFIs of the MSs requesting the retransmissions (for example, in order to take into<br>
account for MSs possible located in areas of a cell of scarce coverage).<br>
The impact on procedures at the RLC level within the MSs is higher than in the<br>
previously discussed case, hi particular, in order to support such a retransmission scheme,<br>
the generic MS shall be capable of advancing the receive window even if that MS did not<br>
correctly receive the least recent radio block not yet received within a specified timeout;<br>
for example, the missing radio blocks should be replaced by all-zero fill bits payload<br>
radio blocks. The same impact applies also for all the MSs which are not included in the<br>
list of the individually addressable MSs, i.e. those which are not allowed to send PACKET<br>
DOWNLINK ACK/NACK messages (the MSs with the default MFI_fake assigned to all<br>
the MSs in excess of an upper limit, and the MSs the BSS is not aware of). For those MSs<br>
the same impact occurs also with an exhaustive algorithm (since the algorithm is<br>
exhaustive just for the addressed MSs). On the network side, the RLC-level procedures<br>
shall also be modified in order to periodically set the start of the transmit window<br>
corresponding to the least recent radio block not yet positively acknowledged that the<br>
BSC decides to take into account for retransmissions, based on the selective algorithm.<br>
Furthermore, the BSC may decide that an MS is no more to be taken into<br>
consideration for the retransmissions management; for example, the BSC may decide this<br>
based on the ACK/NACKs received from that MS, as previously explained. In this case,<br>
the BSC removes the MS from the list of the individually addressable MSs, for example<br>
changing the MS identifier from MFI to MFI_fake. To do this, the BSC for example<br>
identifies the MS by including the respective MFI in a RLC/MAC block, the RLC header<br>
of which is further extended to include the MFI_fake. The RLC header extension for<br>
including the MFI_fake may be performed setting the LI field in one of the octets 450a,...,<br>
450n to a predetermined value, e.g. LI = 57 (following the LI = 55 indicating the<br>
inclusion of the MFI) in GPRS and LI = 77 (following the LI = 75 indicating the<br>
inclusion of the MFI) in EGPRS. The extended RLC header includes therefore Length<br>
Indicators + MFI + MFI_fake.<br>
When the MS detects that its identifier has been changed from MFI to MFI_fake,<br>
the MS releases the MFI_TAI and MFI_TA_TN values, which become no more available<br>
any more for that MS.<br>
The BSC further associates the MFI_fake to the TLLI of that MS in the table 145-<br>
1 (or 145-2); the triplet {MFI, MFIJTAI, MFI_TA_TN} previously assigned to that MS<br>
is now available on the BSC side for a new MS.<br>
The MS removed from the list is from then on no more allowed to send PACKET<br>
DOWNLINK ACK/NACK messages in uplink, even in case the S/P and RRBP fields are<br>
set within the MAC header of the current RLC/MAC block.<br>
When a triplet {MFI, MFI_TAI, MFI_TA_TN} becomes available on the BSC<br>
side for a new MS, the BSC chooses, e.g. randomly, an MS characterized by its TLLI and<br>
with MFI_fake as a new entry in the list of the individually addressable MSs: the BSC<br>
identifies this MS with these two parameters in an RLC/MAC block, and changes the MS<br>
identifier from MFI_fake to MFI, adding the parameters MFI_TAI and MFI_TA_TN in<br>
the same RLC/MAC block. In order to achieve this, the MFI may be included by setting<br>
LI = 55 for GPRS and LI = 75 for EGPRS; the MFI_fake may be included by setting LI =<br>
57 for GPRS and LI = 77 for EGPRS; the TLLI may be included by setting LI = 58 for<br>
GPRS and LI = 78 for EGPRS; the MFIJTAI and the MFI_TA_TN may be included by<br>
setting LI = 59 for GPRS and LI = 79 for EGPRS. The extended RLC header includes<br>
therefore Length Indicators plus MFI plus MFI_fake plus TLLI plus MFI_TAI plus<br>
MFI_TA_TN.<br>
When the MS, receiving the RLC/MAC block, detects that its identifier has been<br>
changed from MFI_fake to MFI, the MS starts using the assigned MFI_TAI and<br>
MFI_TA_TN for TA update purposes. Furthermore, in the table 145-1 or 145-2, the BSC<br>
associates the triplet {MFI, MFIJTAI, MFI_TA_TN} to the TLLI of that MS.<br>
The MS is not allowed to send PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK messages in<br>
uplink, even in case the S/P and RRBP fields are set within the MAC header of the<br>
current RLC/MAC block, until a TA value is available on the MS side via the continuous<br>
TA update procedure.<br>
Therefore, the MSs having been assigned an individual triplet {MFI, MFI_TAI,<br>
MFI_TA_TN} perform the continuous TA update procedure and, whenever required,<br>
send PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK messages for the retransmissions management.<br>
The MSs counted by the BSC with the MFI_fake do not perform the continuous TA<br>
update procedure, and do not send PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK messages, but<br>
anyway take advantage of the retransmissions performed by the BSC on the basis of the<br>
PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK messages sent by the MSs included in the list of the<br>
individually addressable MSs. The MSs of which the BSC is not aware of (i.e. the MSs<br>
which were not able to establish an uplink TBF after the reception of the MBMS<br>
ASSIGNMENT message and before the TBF starting time, and the MSs from which the<br>
BSC has not received back at least one RLC data block including the respective TLLI<br>
plus TMGI, even if they were able to establish an uplink TBF) are in the same condition<br>
as the MSs counted by the BSC with the default MFI_fake. The difference is that for the<br>
MSs of which the BSS is not aware of there are no chances to be randomly selected for<br>
inclusion in the list of the addressed MSs, unlike the MSs counted by the BSC with the<br>
MFI_fake, which can become individually addressable once one or more triplet becomes<br>
available.<br>
Let it now be supposed that, at a given time, a MS asks for the GPRS multicast<br>
service "A", camping on a network cell (e.g., the cell CELLl) where contents related to<br>
multicast service "A" are already being distributed "over-the-air" (due to the fact that the<br>
session related to multicast service "A" is already running).<br>
The MS, after joining the correspondent multicast group (being linked to the<br>
corresponding multicast PDF Context), is assigned by the BSC the same physical<br>
communication resources as the other mobile stations already exploiting the same<br>
multicast service "A" in that network cell and, after releasing the radio communication<br>
resources that were associated to the standard PDF Context initially activated for that MS,<br>
starts exploiting the multicast service "A". For example, an MBMS ASSIGNMENT<br>
message may be used to deliver, to such MS, the TFI and the PDCH(s) needed for tuning<br>
on the multicast service, as well as the triplet {MFI, MFI_TAI, MFI_TA_TN} needed for<br>
managing the addressing procedures.<br>
Thanks to the invention embodiments described in the foregoing, GPRS service<br>
data can be distributed to, so as to be exploited by, a plurality of users at a same time,<br>
particularly users within the same cell of the cellular network, in a point-to-multipoint<br>
modality (i.e., in multicast), and the network resources, particularly the physical radio<br>
resources, to be allocated are not directly dependent on the number of users<br>
simultaneously exploiting the GPRS services. This is of great benefit especially in case of<br>
GPRS services relatively heavy from the viewpoint of the quantity of data to be<br>
transferred, such as in GPRS services involving the distribution of multimedia (audio<br>
and/or video) contents. Additionally, the possibility offered by the provision of the<br>
additional MS identifier, the MFI, of individually addressing the MSs even if, belonging<br>
to a same multicast service group, they share the same TFI, is extremely useful, allowing<br>
for example to implement highly efficient acknowledge/unacknowledge policies and thus<br>
improving the network quality of service level.<br>
It is also pointed out that more than one GPRS services can be distributed in<br>
multicast at a same time: in this case, two or more TFIs will be broadcasted over the cell<br>
broadcast channel, each one labeling radio data blocks of a respective TBF,<br>
corresponding to a respective pilot PDP context; also in this case, the possibility of<br>
individually addressing the MSs remains.<br>
The solution according to the embodiment of the invention herein described has<br>
the significant advantage of not necessitating massive modifications of the standard<br>
GSM/GPRS apparatuses, already deployed on field.<br>
Although the present invention has been disclosed and described by way of an<br>
embodiment, it is apparent to those skilled in the art that several modifications to the<br>
described embodiment, as well as other embodiments of the present invention are possible<br>
without departing from the scope thereof as defined in the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
