Medical implant comprising a secured bone screw<br>
With medical implants which are to be fastened to bone using a bone screw, it is often necessary to prevent backward migration of the screw from its assigned posi-ton, so that it cannot pose a danger to adjacent or-gans. It is not enough to secure the screws against turning in the direction of unscrewing (US-A-5275601) because, if their thread turns are engaged loosely in the bone substance, there is a danger of their moving back axially out of the bone and out of the implant without any appreciable turning. In the case of a bone screw for a bone plate, it is also known (US-A-2002/0022843, FR-A-2802082) to provide interacting thread turns on  the head of the screw and in the associated bore of the bone plate, said thread turns having a smaller pitch than the bone thread. In this way, the friction that counteracts turning-back of the screw is increased. Unscrewing the screw is in this way made difficult, but not prevented. Finally, it is known to secure the screws by providing the implant with covering arrangements which, after the screw has been screwed in, are placed over the screw head in order to prohibit its backward movement (WO 97/2052 6, WO 01/26567, WO 99/56653). Such covering arrangements, however, take up additional space, which can sometimes be undesirable.<br>
The invention is based on the object of preventing the axial outward migration of the screw from the implant in the case of a bone screw with securing means against backward movement.<br><br>
The solution according to the invention lies in the features of the claim. Accordingly, the invention provides that the bone screw is guided through a bore of the implant, which bore is provided with a thread matching the thread of the screw, that the screw shank between the screw head and the thread has an unthreaded portion whose length is at least as great as the length of the threaded bores, and that the implant and the screw are provided with means which inhibit reverse turning of the screw. When the screw is located in its assigned position, the unthreaded portion'of the screw shank lies in the threaded bore of the implant. The threads of the bore and of the screw do not engage in one another in this state. The securing of the screw against backward movement is achieved by the fact that the screw thread cannot pass axially through the threaded bore. The mutually adjoining, final turns of the bore thread and of the screw thread form axial abutments which prevent backward movement of the screw. Escape of the screw from the implant would then only be<br>
possible - .  if the screw thread were able to move by turning into the thread of the bore. This, however, is prevented by the barrier against backward turning.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below with reference to the drawings which depicts an advantageous illustrative embodiment. In the drawings:<br>
Fig, 1 shows a cross section through an endoprosthesis along line I-I in Figure 2,<br>
Fig. 2  shows a ventral view of the prosthesis,<br>
Fig. 3 shows a cross section along line III-III in Figure 2, and<br><br>
Fig. 4 shows a cross section through the bone screw used in the arrangement, looking toward the shank-side face of the screw head.<br>
An endoprosthesis is shown, with a plate 1 on the edge of which a flange 2 is arranged, s-aid flange having two bores 3 which are intended to receive bone screws 4, which in turn are intended to fasten the flange 2 on the surface of a bone. For anchoring in the bone, the bone screws have a thread 5 which, in the portion near the tip of the screw seen on the right in Figure 1, is only indicated by broken lines. At the other end, the shank of the screw 4 is provided with a head 6 which<br>
has surfaces for engagement of a screwing instrument, which surfaces, in the example shown, are designed as a hexagon socket 7. An unthreaded portion 10 is situated between the shank-side face 8 of the screw head 6 and the adjacent end 9 of the thread 5.<br>
The associated bore 3 can (but does not need to) have a seat 11 for completely or partially receiving the screw head 6, said seat 11 forming a face 12 for supporting the rear face 8 of the screw head 6. The bore portion between the face 12 and the rear face 13 of the flange 2 of the bore comprises a thread 14 which matches the thread 5 of the screw 4, The length of the threaded portion in the bore between the faces 12. and 13 is at most as great as the axial length of the unthreaded portion 10 of the screw and not much shorter. The diameter of the unthreaded portion 10 of the screws is not greater than the free core cross section in the bore 3. Accordingly, after the screw 4 has been fully ) screwed in, the screw thread 5 is free from the thread 14 of the bore 3. The screw can thus be turned freely, as is necessary in order to draw the flange 2 fully onto the surface of the bone by tightening the screw in the bone.<br><br>
The rear end 9 of the screw thread 5 and the adjoining end of the thread 14 in the bore 3 form abutments which prohibit an axial, non-rotational backward movement of the screw 4 out of the flange 2 of the implant. To ensure that backward turning is also prevented, the screw and the implant are provided with an arrangement preventing turning. This arrangement can be of any very simple kind known generally in the prior art for preventing backward turning of screws. For example, the screw head can be provided with serrations 15 on its shank-side face in order to interact with corresponding members of the flange 2 and thereby prevent backward turning. In the present example, the members preventing backward turning in Figure 3 are indicated in the form of a spring tongue 16 which protrudes resiliently from the base face 12 of the seat 11 of the flange, so that its edge can come into engagement with the serrations 15. The arrangement is configured in such a way that the screw can be turned only in the direction in which it is screwed into the bone. If an attempt is made to turn it in the direction of unscrewing, the end edge of the spring 16 comes into engagement with the teeth 15 and prevents further backward turning.<br>
The thread 14 in the bore 3 does not have to be particularly long. On the contrary, it can be extremely short- There does not even have to be a complete thread turn. It is enough, for example, to provide the suggestion of a thread turn in the form of a projection on one side of the bore, said projection being just large enough to prevent the axial passage of the threaded part of the screw.<br>
The device preventing backward turning should be active as soon as the screw 4 is situated with its unthreaded portion 10 in the bore 3. In this state, the screw head 6 must therefore be so close to the flange 2 that the<br><br>
end face of the lamella 16 engages in the serrations 15 of the screw head 6. This is ensured by the thread end 9 abutting against the last thread of the bore thread 14. In other words, the distance of the thread end 9 from the serrations 15 must be smaller than the distance of the rear end of the bore thread 14 from the end face of the spring tongue 16 when the latter is in its relaxed state protruding furthest forward. In this connection, it should be noted that the abutment of the thread ends on one another determines the relative position of the flange and of the screw only with an uncertainty of one thread height. The spring distance of the end face of the spring tongue 16 must therefore be greater than one thread lead. This condition can be made easier if the locking means (serrations and spring tongue) effecting the prevention of backward turning is provided not on the rear end face but on the circumfer-ential face of the screw head or in the transition area between the rear end face and the circumferential face.<br><br><br><br><br>
