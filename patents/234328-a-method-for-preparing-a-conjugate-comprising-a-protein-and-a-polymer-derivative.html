				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing a conjugate comprising a protein and a polymer derivative.<br>
The present invention further relates to conjugates of hydroxyalkyl starch and a granulocyte colony stimulating factor protein (G-CSF) wherein these conjugates are formed by a covalent linkage between the hydroxyalkyl starch or a derivative of the hydroxyalkyl starch and the protein. The present invention also relates to the method of producing these conjugates and the use of these conjugates.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is generally accepted that the stability of proteins can be improved and the immune response against these proteins is reduced when these proteins are coupled to polymeric molecules. WO 94/28024 discloses that physiologically active proteins modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) exhibit reduced immunogenicity and antigenicity and circulate in the bloodstream considerably longer than unconjugated proteins, i.e. have a reduced clearance rate.<br>
G-CSF is a 21 kDa glycoprotein stabilized by two intrachain disulfide bonds and containing a single 0-linked carbohydrate moiety. Mature G-CSF has 174 amino acids. In the animal body, G-CSF is synthesized by bone marrow stromal cells, macrophages and fibroblasts. It main function is to be a growth and differentiation factor for neutrophils and their precursor cells. However, it is also known in the art that G-CSF activates mature neutrophils. In addition, it stimulates growth/differentiation of various other haemopoietic progenitor cells (in synergy with additional haemopoietic growth factors) and promotes proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Clinically, G-CSF is administered for the treatment of deficiencies in neutrophil levels (caused, e.g. by aplastic anaemia, myelodysplasia, AIDS, or chemotherapy).<br>
WO 02/09766 discloses, among others, biocompatible protein-polymer compounds which are produced by conjugation of biologically active protein with a biocompatible polymer derivative. The biocompatible polymers used are highly reactive branched polymers, and the resulting conjugates contain a long linker between polymer derivative and protein. As<br><br>
biocompatible polymers, polymers of formula (P-OCH2CO-NH-CHR-CO~)n-L-Qic-A are described, wherein P and Q are polymeric residues and k may be 1 or 0. For P and Q,<br>
polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyoxyethylene, polytrimethylene glycol,<br>
polylactic acid and its derivatives, polyacrylic acid and its derivatives, polyamino acid,<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, polyurethane, polyphosphazene, poly(L-lysine), polyalkylene oxide,<br>
polyacryl amide and water soluble polymers such as dextran or polysaccharide are<br>
mentioned. As proteins, among others, alpha, beta and gamma interferons, blood factors,<br>
cytokines such as interleukins, G-CSF, GM-CSF are mentioned. In the examples of WO<br>
02/09766, only mono-, di- and tri-polyethyleneglycol derivatives are disclosed which are<br>
coupled exclusively to interferon and epidermal growth factor, and human growth<br>
hormone.<br>
WO 94/01483 discloses biocompatible polymer conjugates which are formed by covalently<br>
binding a biologically inactive polymer or polymer derivative to a pharmaceutically pure,<br>
synthetic hydrophilic polymer via specific types of chemical bonds. As naturally occuring<br>
polymers and derivatives thereof, polysaccharides such as hyaluronic acid, proteoglycans<br>
such as chondroitin sulfates A, B and C, chitin, heparin, heparin sulfate, dextrans such as<br>
cyclodextran, hydroxyethyl cellulose, cellulose ether and starch, lipids such as triglycerides<br>
and phospholipids are disclosed. As synthetic polymers, among others, polyethylene and<br>
derivatives thereof are described having an average molecular weight of from about 100 to<br>
about 100,000. As proteins linked to the polymer or the polymer derivative, cytokines and<br>
growth factors are described, including interferons, tumor necrosis factors, interleukins,<br>
colony stimulating factors, growth factors such as osteogenic factor extract, epidermal<br>
growth factor, transforming growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, acidic fibroblast<br>
growth factor and others are disclosed. In all working examples of WO 94/01483,<br>
polyethylene glycols derivatives are used as polymer.<br>
WO 96/11953 discloses N-terminally chemically modified protein compounds and<br>
methods of their production. Specifically, G-CSF compositions are described which result<br>
from coupling a water soluble polymer to the N terminus of G-CSF. In the context of WO<br>
96/11953, also consensus interferone N-terminally coupled to water soluble polymers are<br>
disclosed. While a wide variety of water polymers are listed in WO 96/11953 (e.g.<br>
copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, carboxymethyl cellulose, dextran,<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-l,3-dioxolane, poly-l,3,6-trioxane,<br>
ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, polyaminoacids (either homopolymers or random<br>
copolymers), poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol<br>
homopolymers, polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide copolymers or polyoxyethylated<br>
polyols), only PEGylated G-CSF or consensus IFN compositions are described in the<br>
working examples of WO 96/11953.<br>
US 6,555,660 B2 discloses polypeptide conjugates comprising a polypeptide exhibiting GCSF<br>
activity and having an amino acid sequence that differs from the amino acid sequence<br>
of human G-CSF in at least one specified introduced and/or removed amino acid residue,<br>
wherein the conjugate comprises an attachment group for a non-polypeptide moiety, and<br>
further comprises at least one non-polypeptide moiety attached to the attachment group of<br>
the polypeptide. The non-polypeptide moiety may be a polymer such as polyethylene<br>
glycol or an oligosaccharide. In US 6,555,660 B2, it is explicitly and unambiguously stated<br>
that PEG is by far the most preferred polymer molecule since it has only few reactive<br>
groups capable of cross-linking compared to porysaccharides such as dextran.<br>
WO 97/30148 relates to polypeptide conjugates with reduced allergenicity comprising a polymeric carrier molecule having two or more potypetide molecules coupled thereto.<br>
These conjugates are preferably part of compositions used in the personal care market.<br>
Said conjugates are produced by activating a polymeric carrier molecule, reacting two or more polypeptide molecules with the activated polymeric carrier molecule and blocking of<br>
residual active groups on the conjugate. As polymeric carrier moelcule, a vast variety is listed in WO 97/30148, including such different groups of compound like natural or<br>
synthetic homopolymers such as polyols, polyamines, polycarboxylic acids and<br>
heteropolymers comprising at least two different attachment groups. Examples are given, which comprise star PEGs, branched PEGs, polyvinyl alcohols, polycarboxylates, polyvinylpyrrolidones and poly-D,L-amino acids. Among others, also dextrans such as carboxymethyl dextran, celluloses such as hydroxyethyl cellulose or hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydrolysates of chitosan, starches such as hydroxyethyl starches or hydroxypropyl starches, glycogen, agarose, guar gum, inulin, pullulan, xanthan gum,<br>
carrageenin, pectin, alginic acid etc. are disclosed. As polypeptides, only some enzymes<br>
are explicitly disclosed.<br>
Baldwin, J.E, et al, Tetrahedron, vol. 27 (1981), pp. 1723 - 1726 describe the chemical modification of dextran and hydroxyethyl starch to give aldehyde substituted polymers which are allowed to react with hemoglobin to give soluble polymer-bound hemoglobins. These were shown to be capable of binding oxygen, but heart perfusion experiments clearly indicated that the polymer-bound hemoglobins were not suitable for use as blood substitutes.<br>
WO 99/49897 describes conjugates of hemoglobin formed by reacting olysaccharides<br>
such as dextrane or hydroxyethyl starch with amino groups of the hemoglobin. As<br>
functional groups of the polysaccharide, aldehyde groups produced by oxidative saccharide<br>
ring-opening are used. As preferred reducing agent used, borane dimethylamine is<br>
disclosed. Moreover, WO 99/49897 is exclusively limited to hemoglobin.<br>
WO 03/074087 relates to a method of coupling proteins to a starch-derived modified<br>
polysaccharide. The binding action between the protein and the polysaccharide,<br>
hydroxyalkyl starch, is a covalent linkage which is formed between the terminal aldehyde<br>
group or a functional group resulting from chemical modification of said terminal aldehyde<br>
group of the hydroxy alkyl starch molecule, and a functional group of the protein. As<br>
reactive group of the protein, amino groups, thio groups and carboxyl groups are disclosed,<br>
and aldehyde groups of the protein are not mentioned. Moreover, while a vast variety of<br>
possibilities of different linkages is given in the form of many lists, including different<br>
functional groups, theoretically suitable different linker molecules, and different chemical<br>
procedures, the working examples describe only two alternatives: first, an oxidized<br>
hydroxyethyl starch is used and coupled directly to proteins using<br>
ethyldimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide (EDC) activation, or a non-oxidized hydroxyethyl<br>
starch is used and coupled directly to a protein forming a Schiff s base which is<br>
subsequently reduced to the respective amine. Thus, the working examples of WO<br>
03/074087 neither disclose a single conjugate coupled via a thio group or a carboxy group<br>
of the protein, nor describe a conjugate comprising hydroxyethyl starch, the protein, and<br>
one or more linker molecules. Additionally, no G-CSF molecule is used in the working<br>
examples.<br>
Therefore, it was an object of the present invention to provide conjugates of hydroxyalkyl<br>
starch, preferably hydroxy ethyl starch, and G-CSF which are not yet described in the prior<br>
art. It is a further object of the present invention to provide methods of producing these conjugates.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to a method for preparing a conjugate comprising a<br>
protein and a polymer or a derivative thereof, wherein the polymer is a hydroxyalkyl starch<br>
(HAS) and the protein is a granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), the method<br>
comprising reacting at least one functional group A of the polymer or the derivative thereof<br>
with at least one functional group Z of the protein and thereby forming a covalent linkage,<br>
wherein Z is selected from the group consisting of an amino group, a thiol group, an<br>
aldehyde group and a keto group, and<br>
- wherein, in case Z is an aldehyde group or a keto group, A comprises an amino<br>
group forming said linkage with Z, or<br>
- wherein, in case Z is an amino group, A is selected from the group consisting of a<br>
reactive carboxy group and an aldehyde group, a keto group or a hemiacetal<br>
group,<br>
 wherein, in case A is an aldehyde group, a keto group or a hemiacetal group,<br>
the method further comprises introducing A in the polymer to give a polymer<br>
derivative<br>
by reacting the polymer with an at least bifunctional compound, one<br>
functional group of which reacts with the polymer and at least one other<br>
functional group of which is an aldehyde group, a keto group or a<br>
hemiacetal group, or is a functional group which is further chemically<br>
modified to give an aldehyde group, a keto group or a hemiacetal<br>
group, or<br>
by oxidizing the polymer to give at least one, in particular at least two<br>
aldehyde groups, or<br>
— wherein, in case A is a reactive carboxy group, the method further comprises<br>
introducing A in the polymer to give a polymer derivative<br>
by selectively oxidizing the polymer at its reducing end and activating<br>
the resulting carboxy group, or<br>
/=<br>
by reacting the polymer at its non-oxidized reducing end with a<br>
carbonic diester, or<br>
- wherein, in case Z is a thiol group, A comprises<br>
a maleimido group or<br>
— a halogenacetyl group<br>
forming said linkage with Z.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also relates to a conjugate as obtainable by a method as<br>
described above.<br>
The G-CSF can be produced by chemical synthetic procedures or can be of any human (see<br>
e.g. Burgess, A.W. et al. 1977, Stimulation by human placenta! conditioned medium of<br>
hemopoietic colony formation by human marrow cells, Blood 49 (1977), 573-583; Shah,<br>
R.G. et al. 1977, Characterization of colony-stimulating activity produced by human<br>
monocytes and r^ytohemaggtutiirin-stimiilated lymphocytes, Blood 50 (1977), 811) or<br>
another mammalian source mid can be obtained by purification from naturally occurring<br>
sources like human placenta, human blood or human urine. In addition, a lot of Epithelial<br>
i<br>
carcinomas, acute myeloid leukemia cells and various tumor cell lines (bladder<br>
carcinomas, medulloblastomas), are capable to express this factor.<br>
Furthermore, the expression G-CSF encompasses also a G-CSF variant wherein one or<br>
more amino acids (e.g. 1 to 25, preferably 1 to 10, more preferably 1 to 5, most preferred 1<br>
or 2) have been exchanged by another amino acid and which exhibits G-CSF activity (see<br>
e.g. Riedhaar-Olson, J.F. et al. 1996, Identification of residues critical to the activity of<br>
human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, Biochemistry 35:9034-9041 1996; U.S. Pat.<br>
Nos. 5,581476; 5,214,132; 5,362,853; 4,904,584). The measurement of G-CSF activity is<br>
described in the art (for measurement of G-CSF activity hi vitro see e.g. Shirafuji, N. et<br>
al.1989, A new bioassay for human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (hG-CSF) using<br>
murine myeloblastic NFS-60 cells as targets and estimation of its levels hi sera from<br>
normal healthy persons and patients with infectious and hematological disorders, Exp.<br>
Hematol. 1989, 17, 116-119; for measurement of G-CSF activity in vivo see e.g. Tanaka,<br>
H. et al. 1991,_Pharmacokinetics of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating<br>
factor conjugated to polyethylene glycol in rats, Cancer Research 51, 3710-3714,1991).<br>
Further publications where tests for the measurement of the activity of G-CSF are U.S. Pat.<br>
_ —7<br>
No. 6,555,660; Nohynek, G.J. et al.1997, Comparison of the potency of glycosylated and<br>
nonglycosylated recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors in neutropenic<br>
and nonneutropenic CD rats, Cancer Chemother Pharmacol (1997) 39;259-266.<br>
Preferably, the G-CSF is recombinantly produced. This includes prokaryotic or eukaryotic<br>
host expression of exogenous DNA sequences obtained by genomic or cDNA cloning or<br>
by DNA synthesis. Suitable prokaryotic hosts include various bacteria such as E. coli.<br>
Suitable eukaryotic hosts include yeast such as S. cerevisiae and mammalian cells such as<br>
Chinese hamster ovary cells and monkey cells.The recombinant production of a protein is known in the art. In general, this includes the transfection of host cells with an appropriate expression vector, the cultivation of the host<br>
cells under conditions which enable the production of the protein and the purification of<br>
the protein from the host cells. For detailed information see e.g. Souza, L.M.et al. 1986,<br>
Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: effects on normal and<br>
leukemic myeloid cells, Science 1986 232:61-65,1986; Nagata, S. et.al. 1986, Molecular<br>
cloning and expression of cDNA for human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, Nature<br>
319:415-418, 1986; Komatsu, Y. et al. 1987, Cloning of granulocyte colony-stimulating<br>
factor cDNA from human macrophages and its expression in Escherichia coli, Jpn J Cancer<br>
Res. 1987 78(11):! 179-1181.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the G-CSF has the amino acid sequence of human mature GCSF<br>
(see e.g.; Nagata, S. et. al.1986, Molecular cloning and expression of cDNA for<br>
human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, Nature 319:415-418, 1986 ), and may<br>
further contain a methionin at its amino terminus, which then results in a protein of 175<br>
amino acids. Furthermore, instead of the methionine, G-CSF may contain a serine or a<br>
threonine residue.<br>
The G-CSF used in the methods of the present invention and the conjugates according to<br>
the present invention may comprise one carbohydrate side chain attached to the G-CSF via<br>
O-linked glycosylation at the position Thr 133, i.e. the G-CSF is glycosylated (V. Gervais<br>
et aLJEur. J. Biochem. 1997, 247, 386-395). The structure of the carbohydrate side chain<br>
may be NeuNAc(alpha2-3)Gal(betal-3)[NeuNAc(alpha2-6)]GalNAc und (alpha2-<br>
3)Gal(betal-3)GalNAc (NeuNAc == N-acetylneuramic acid, GalNAc = Nacetylgalactosamine).<br>
Modification of G-CSF and other polypeptides so as to introduce at least one additional<br>
carbohydrate chain as compared to the native polypeptide has been suggested (U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,218,092). Depending on the host employed, the G-CSF expression product may be glycosylated with mammalian or other eukaryotic carbohydrates. Usually, when G-CSF is produced in eukaryotic cells, the protein is posttranslationally glycosylated. Consequently,<br>
the carbohydrate side chain may have been attached to the G-CSF during biosynthesis hi<br>
mammalian, especially human, insect or yeast cells.<br>
Recombinant human G-CSF (rhG-CSF) is generally used for treating various forms of<br>
leukopenia. Thus, commercial preparations of rhG-CSF are available under the names<br>
filgrastim (Gran® and Neupogen®), lenograstim (Neutrogin® and Granocyte®) and<br>
nartograstim (Neu-up
recombinant E. coli cells. Neutrogin® and Granocyte® are glycosylated and produced in<br>
recombinant CHO cells and Neu-up® is non-glycosylated with five amino acids<br>
substituted at the N-tenninal region of intact rhG-CSF produced in recombinant E. coli<br>
cells.<br>
As glycosylated protein, any glycosylated G-CSF such as Granocyte® may be employed.<br>
As non-glycosylated G-CSF, any non-glycosylated G-CSF such as Neupogen® may be employed in the methods and conjugate according to the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, at position -1, G-CSF may contain a methionine amino acid residue, a serine residue, or a threonine residue.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "hydroxyalkyl starch" (HAS) refers to a starch derivative which has been substituted by at least one hydroxyalkyl group. A<br>
preferred hydroxyalkyl starch of the present invention has a constitution according to<br>
formula (I) <br>
wherein the reducing end of the starch molecule is shown in the non-oxidized form and the<br>
terminal saccharide unit is shown in the acetal form which, depending on e.g. the solvent,<br>
may be in equilibrium with the aldehyde form.<br>
The term hydroxyalkyl starch as used in the present invention is not limited to compounds<br>
where the terminal carbohydrate moiety comprises hydroxyalkyl groups Ri, RI, and/or Ra<br>
as depicted, for the sake of brevity, hi formula (I), but also refers to compounds hi which at<br>
least one hydroxy group present anywhere, either in the terminal carbohydrate moiety<br>
and/or in the remaining part of the starch molecule, HAS*, is substituted by a hydroxyalkyl<br>
group R1,R2, or R3.<br>
Hydroxyalkyl starch comprising two or more different hydroxyalkyl groups are also<br>
possible.<br>
The at least one hydroxyalkyl group comprised hi HAS may contain two or more hydroxy<br>
groups. According to a preferred embodiment, the at least one hydroxyalkyl group<br>
comprised hi HAS contains one hydroxy group.<br>
The expression "hydroxyalkyl starch" also includes derivatives wherein the alkyl group is<br>
mono- or polysubstituted. hi this context, it is preferred that the alkyl group is substituted<br>
with a halogen, especially fluorine, or with an aryl group. Furthermore, the hydroxy group<br>
of a hydroxyalkyl group may be esterified or etherified.<br>
Furthermore, instead of alkyl, also linear or branched substituted or unsubstituted alkene<br>
groups may be used.<br>
Hydroxyalkyl starch is an ether derivative of starch. Besides of said ether derivatives, also<br>
other starch derivatives can be used in the context of the present invention. For example,<br>
derivatives are useful which comprise esterified hydroxy groups. These derivatives may be<br>
e.g. derivatives of unsubstituted mono- or dicarboxylic acids with 2-12 carbon atoms or of<br>
substituted derivatives thereof. Especially useful are derivatives of unsubstituted<br>
monocarboxylic acids with 2-6 carbon atoms, especially derivatives of acetic acid. In this<br>
context, acetyl starch, butyl starch and propyl starch are preferred.<br>
Furthermore, derivatives of unsubstituted dicarboxylic acids with. 2-6 carbon atoms are<br>
preferred.<br>
In the case of derivatives of dicarboxylic acids, it is useful that the second carboxy group<br>
of the dicarboxylic acid is also esterified. Furthermore, derivatives of monoalkyl esters of<br>
dicarboxylic acids are also suitable in the context of the present invention.<br>
For the substituted mono- or dicarboxylic acids, the substitute groups may be preferably<br>
the same as mentioned above for substituted alkyl residues.<br>
Techniques for the esterification of starch are known in the art (see e.g. KJemm D. et al,<br>
Comprehensive Cellulose Chemistry Vol. 2, 1998, Whiley-VCH, Weinheim, New York,<br>
especially chapter 4.4, Esterification of Cellulose (ISBN 3-527-29489-9).<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, hydroxyalkyl starch<br>
according to formula (I) is employed. In formula (I), the saccharide ring described<br>
explicitly and the residue denoted as HAS' together represent the preferred hydroxyalkyl<br>
starch molecule. The other saccharide ring structures comprised in HAS' may be the same<br>
as or different from the explicitly described saccharide ring.<br>
As far as the residues R], Ra and Ra according to formula (I) are concerned there are no<br>
specific limitations. According to a preferred embodiment, RI, R2 and Ra are independently<br>
hydrogen or a hydroxyalkyl group, a hydroxyaryl group, a hydroxyaralkyl group or a<br>
hydroxyalkaryl group having of from 2 to 10 carbon atoms in the respective alkyl residue.<br>
Hydrogen and hydroxyalkyl groups having of from 2 to 10 are preferred. More preferably,<br>
the hydroxyalkyl group has from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, more preferably from 2 to 4 carbon<br>
atoms, and even more preferably from 2 to 4 carbon atoms. "Hydroxyalkyl starch"<br>
therefore preferably comprises hydroxyethyl starch, hydroxypropyl starch and<br>
hydroxybutyl starch, wherein hydroxyethyl starch and hydroxypropyl starch are<br>
particularly preferred and hydroxyethyl starch is most preferred.<br>
The alkyl, aryl, aralkyl and/or alkaryl group may be linear or branched and suitably<br>
substituted.<br>
Therefore, the present invention also relates to a method as described above wherein R1, R2<br>

Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is most preferred for all embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to the method and the conjugate as described<br>
above, wherein the polymer is hydroxyethyl starch and the polymer derivative is a<br>
hydroxyethyl starch derivative.<br>
Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is a derivative of naturally occurring amylopectin and is<br>
degraded by alpha-amylase in the body. HES is a substituted derivative of the carbohydrate<br>
polymer amylopectin, which is present in corn starch at a concentration of up to 95 % by<br>
weight. HES exhibits advantageous biological properties and is used as a blood volume<br>
replacement agent and in hemodilution therapy in the clinics (Sommerrneyer et al., 1987,<br>
Kjarikenhauspharmazie, 8(8), 271-278; and Weidler et al., 1991, Arzneim.-<br>
Forschung/Drug Res., 41,494-498).<br>
Amyiopectin consists of glucose moieties, wherein in the main chain alpha- 1,4-glycosidic<br>
bonds are present and at the branching sites alpha- 1,6-glycosidic bonds are found. The<br>
physical-chemical properties of this molecule are mainly determined by the type of<br>
glycosidic bonds. Due to the nicked alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond, helical structures with<br>
about six glucose-monomers per turn are produced. The physico-chemical as well as the<br>
biochemical properties of the polymer can be modified via substitution. The introduction<br>
of a hydroxyethyl group can be achieved via alkaline hydroxyethylation. By adapting the<br>
reaction conditions it is possible to exploit the different reactivity of the respective hydroxy<br>
group in the unsubstituted glucose monomer with respect to a hydroxyethylation. Owing to<br>
this fact, the skilled person is able to influence the substitution pattern to a limited extent.<br>
HES is mainly characterized by the molecular weight distribution and the degree of<br>
substitution. There are two possibilities of describing the substitution degree:<br>
1. The degree can be described relatively to the portion of substituted glucose<br>
monomers with respect to all glucose moieties.<br>
2. The degree of substitution can be described as the molar substitution, wherein the<br>
number of hydroxyethyl groups per glucose moiety are described.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the degree of substitution, denoted as DS, relates to<br>
the molar substitution, as described above.<br>
HES solutions are present as polydisperse compositions, wherein each molecule differs<br>
from the other with respect to the polymerisation degree, the number and pattern of<br>
branching sites, and the substitution pattern. HES is therefore a mixture of compounds with<br>
different molecular weight. Consequently, a particular HES solution is determined by<br>
average molecular weight with the help of statistical means. In this context, Mn is<br>
calculated as the arithmetic mean depending on the number of molecules. Alternatively,<br>
Mw (or MW), the weight mean, represents a unit which depends on the mass of the HES.<br>
In the context of the present invention, hydroxyethyl starch may preferably have a mean<br>
molecular weight (weight mean) of from 1 to 300 kD. Hydroxyethyl starch can further<br>
exhibit a preferred molar degree of substitution of from 0.1 to 0.8 and a preferred ratio<br>
between €2: Ce substitution in the range of from 2 to 20 with respect to the hydroxyethyl<br>
groups.<br>
The term "mean molecular weight" as used in the context of the present invention relates to<br>
the weight as determined according to Sommermeyer et al., 1987, Krankenhauspharmazie,<br>
8(8), 271-278; and Weidler et al., 1991, Arzneim.-Forschung/Drug Res., 41,494-498.<br>

An example for HES with a mean molecular weight of about 130 kD is Voluven® from<br>
Fresenius. Voluven® is an artifical colloid, employed, e.g., for volume replacement used in<br>
the therapeutic indication for therapy and prophylaxis of hypovolaemia. The characteristics<br>

0.4 and a C2 . C6 ratio of about 9:1.<br>

0.6, 0.7 or 0.8 being more preferred, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 or 0.8 being even more<br>
preferred, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 or 0.8 being still more preferred and, e.g. 0.4 and 0.7 being<br>
particularly preferred.<br>
Particularly preferred combinations of molecular weight of the hydroxyalkyl starch,<br>

In different conjugates and/or different methods according to the present invention,<br>
different hydroxyalkyl starches, preferably different hydroxyethyl starches and/or different<br>
hydroxyalkyl starch mixtures, preferably different hydroxyethyl starch mixtures, may be<br>

According to one embodiment of the present invention, the functional group Z of the<br>
protein is an aldehyde group or a keto group. Therefore, the present invention relates to a<br>
method and conjugates as described above, wherein the functional group Z of the protein is<br>
an aldehyde group or a keto group.<br>
While there are no general restrictions as to the location of the aldehyde or keto group<br>
within the protein, the aldehyde or keto group is, according to a preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention, located in a carbohydrate side chain of the protein. Therefore, in the<br>
context of this embodiment, a glycosylated protein is employed.<br>
As glycosylated protein, any glycosylated G-CSF such as Granocyte® may be employed.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "carbohydrate side chain" refers to<br>
hydroxyaldehydes or hydroxyketones as well as to chemical modifications thereof (see<br>
R6mpp Chemielexikon, Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, Germany, 9th edition 1990, Volume 9,<br>
pages 2281-2285 and the literature cited therein). Furthermore, it also refers to derivatives<br>
of naturally occuring carbohydrate moieties like, galactose, N-acetylneuramic acid, and Nacetylgalactosamine)<br>
and the like. In case a mutant of G-CSF is employed being Nglycosylated,<br>
a carbohydrate moiety may be mannose.<br>
In an even more preferred embodiment, the aldehyde group or the keto group is part of a<br>
galactose residue of the carbohydrate side chain. This galactose residue can be made<br>
available for reaction with the functional group A comprised in the polymer or polymer<br>
derivative by removal of terminal sialic acids, followed by oxidation, as described<br>
hereinunder.<br>
hi a still further preferred embodiment, the polymer or polymer derivative comprising<br>
functional group A is linked to a sialic acid residue of the carbohydrate side chains,<br>
preferably the terminal sialic acid residue of the carbohydrate side chain.<br>
Oxidation of terminal carbohydrate moieties can be performed either chemically or<br>
enzymatically.<br>
Methods for the chemical oxidation of carbohydrate moieties of polypeptides are known in<br>
the art and include the treatment with periodate (Chamow et al., 1992, J. Biol. Chem., 267,<br>
15916-15922).<br>
By chemically oxidizing, it is in principle possible to oxidize any carbohydrate moiety,<br>
being terminally positioned or not. However, by choosing mild reaction conditions it is<br>
possible to preferably oxidize the terminal sialic acid of a carbohydrate side chain to give<br>
the aldehyde group or the keto group.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, said mild reaction conditions relate<br>
to reacting the protein with a suitable aqueous periodate solution, having a preferred<br>
periodate concentration in the range of from 1 to 50 mM, more perferably of from 1 to 25<br>
mM and especially perferably of from 1 to 10 mM such as about 1 mM, and at a preferred<br>
reaction temperature of from 0 to 40 °C and especially preferably of from 0 to 21 °C such<br>
as about 0 °C, and for a preferred reaction time of from 5 min to 5 h, more preferably from<br>
10 min to 2 h and especially preferably from 10 min. to 1 h such as about 1 h. The<br>
preferred molar ratio of periodate : protein is from 1:200 to 1:1 and more preferably from<br>
1:50 to 1:5. such as about 15 :1.<br>
Therefore, the present invention also relates to a method and a conjugate as described<br>
above, wherein, prior to the reaction of the protein and the polymer or polymer derivate, a<br>
glycosylated protein is reacted with a periodate solution to give a protein having an<br>
aldehyde group or a keto group located in the oxidized carbohydrate side chain.<br>
Alternatively, the carbohydrate side chain may be oxidized enzymatically. Enzymes for the<br>
oxidation of the individual carbohydrate side chain are known in the art, e.g. in the case of<br>
galactose the enzyme is galactose oxidase. If h is intended to oxidize terminal galactose<br>
moieties, it will be eventually necessary to remove terminal sialic acids (partially or<br>
completely) if the polypeptide has been produced in cells capable of attaching sialic acids<br>
to carbohydrate chains, e.g. in mammalian cells or in cells which have been genetically<br>
modified to be capable of attaching sialic acids to carbohydrate chains. Chemical or<br>
enzymatic methods for the removal of sialic acids are known in the art (Chaplin and<br>
Kennedy (eds.), 1996, Carbohydrate Analysis: a practical approach, especially Chapter 5<br>
Montreuill, Glycoproteins, pages 175-177; IRL Press Practical approach series (ISBN 0-<br>
947946-44-3)).<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the aldehyde group<br>
or keto group may be located at the N terminus of the protein and is accessible by suitable<br>
oxidation. Especially in the case that a hydroxy group containing amino acid is located at<br>
the N terminus of the protein, such as threonine or serine, oxidation of said N-terminal<br>
amino acid can be carried out leading to said keto group or an aldehyde group. Theronine,<br>
is the N terminal amino acid in human derived G-CSF. An additional N-terminal serine or<br>
threonkie may be introduced in any protein showing G-CSF like activity by molecular<br>
biological methods. This protein or the protein expressing the human amino acid sequence<br>
may be produced by expression in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells such as bacteria,<br>
mammalian, insect or yeast cells, and which may or may not be glycosylated. As method<br>
for the chemical oxidation of the suitable N-terminal amino acid, any conceivable method<br>
may be applied, with the oxidation with periodate being preferred.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, said mild reaction<br>
conditions relate to reacting the protein with a suitable aqueous periodate solution, having<br>
a preferred periodate concentration in the range of from 1 to 50 mM, more perferably of<br>
from 1 to 25 mM and especially perferably of from 1 to 10 mM such as about 1 mM, and<br>
at a preferred reaction temperature of from 0 to 40 °C and especially preferably of from 0<br>
to 21 °C such as about 0 °C, and for a preferred reaction time of from 5 min to 5 h, more<br>
preferably from 10 min to 2 h and especially preferably from 10 min. to 1 h such as about 1<br>
h. The preferred molar ratio of periodate: protein is from 1:200 to 1:1 and move preferably<br>
from 1:50 to 1:5. such as about IS: 1.<br>
Therefore, the present invention also relates to a method and a conjugate as described<br>
above, wherein the aldehyde group or the keto group is located in a carbohydrate side<br>
chain of the protein and/or at the N-terminal group of the protein.<br>
The oligosaccharide pattern of proteins produced in eukaryotic cells thus having been<br>
posttranslationally glycosylated, are not identical to the human derived proteins. Moreover,<br>
many glycosylated proteins do not have the desired number of terminal sialic acid residues<br>
masking a further carbohydrate moiety such as a galactose residue. Those further<br>
carbohydrate moieties such as a galactose residue, however, if not masked, are possibly<br>
responsible for disadvantages such as a shorter plasma half-life of the protein in possible<br>
uses of the protein as a medicament. It was surprisingly found that by providing a protein<br>
conjugate formed by a hydroxyalkyl starch polymer, preferably a hydroxyethyl starch<br>
polymer, which is covalently linked, e.g. via an oxime linkage as disclosed hereinunder, to<br>
a carbohydrate moiety of a carbohydrate side chain of the protein, either directly or via at<br>
least one linker compounds such as one or two linker compounds, it is possible to<br>
overcome at least the above mentioned disadvantage. Hence it is believed that by coupling<br>
a hydroxyalkyl starch polymer or derivative thereof, preferably a hydroxyethyl starch<br>
polymer or a derivative thereof, to at least one carbohydrate side chain of a glycosylated<br>
protein, the lack of suitable terminal carbohydrate residues located at a carbohydrate side<br>
chain is compensated. According to another aspect of the invention, providing the<br>
respective conjugate with a hydroxyalkyl starch polymer or derivative thereof, preferably a<br>
hydroxyethyl starch polymer or a derivative thereof, coupled to the oxidized carbohydrate<br>
moiety as described above, does not only compensate the disadvantage but provides a<br>
protein conjugate having better characteristics in the desired field of use than the respective<br>
naturally occuring protein. Therefore, the respective conjugates according to the invention<br>
have a compensational and even a synergistic effect on the protein. It also possible that<br>
even proteins which are identical to human proteins or which are human proteins do not<br>
have the desired number of suitable masking terminal carbohydrate residues such as silaic<br>
acid residues at naturally occuring carbohydrate moieties. In such cases, providing the<br>
respective conjugate with a hydroxyalkyl starch polymer or derivative thereof, preferably a<br>
hydroxyethyl starch polymer or a derivative thereof, coupled to the oxidized carbohydrate<br>
moiety as described above, does not only overcome and compensate a disadvantage of an<br>

GmbH, Rosbach-Rodheim, D; according to DE 196 28 705 Al.<br>
6.0 g (0.6 mmol) of oxo-HES 10/0.7 were dissolved in 20 ml anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide<br>
(DMSO, Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Taufkirchen, D)) and added dropwise<br>
under nitrogen to a solution of 6 ml (60 mmol) 1,4-diaminobutane in 11 ml anhydrous<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide and stirred at 40 °C for 19 h. The reaction mixture was added to a<br>
mixture of 80 ml ethanol and 80 ml acetone. The resulting precipitate was separated by<br>
centrifugation, washed with a mixture of 20 ml ethanol and 20 ml acetone and re-dissolved<br>
in 80 ml water. The solution was dialyzed for 4 days against water (SnakeSkin dialysis<br>
tubing, 3.5 kD cut off, Perbio Science Deutschland GmbH, Bonn, D) and subsequently<br>
lyophilized. The yield was 52 % (3.15 g) amino-HES 10/0.7.<br>
To 132 |ig amino-HES 10/0.7, dissolved in 100 ul sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, 0.15 M<br>
NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, pH 7.2), 10 ul of a solution of 17.5 mg/ml Nalpha(<br>
maleimidoacetoxy)succinimide ester (AMAS) in dry DMSO (both Fluka, SigmaAldrich<br>
Chemie GmbH, Taufkirchen, D) were added, and the clear solution was incubated<br>
for 80 min at 25 °C and subsequently for 20 min at 40 °C. The excess of AMAS was<br>
removed by centrifugal filtration with a VTVASPIN 0.5 ml concentrator, 5KD MWCO<br>
(VTVASCIENCE, Hannover, D) at 13,000 rpm, washed 2 times for 30 min with 450 ul of<br>
the phosphate buffer and once with 450 ul of a buffer B. To the residual solution, 10 u,g GCSF<br>
(Neupogen® from Amgen, Munchen, D, and Granocyte® from Aventis Pharma AG,<br>
Zurich, CH, respectively, 3 u,g/ul hi phosphate buffer) were added, and the mixture was<br>
incubated for 16h at 25 °C. The reaction mixture was analysed by gel electrophoresis after<br>
concentration in vacuo.<br>
The following methods were chosen:<br>
(x) G-CSF (Granocyte®) employing sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, 0.15 M NaCl, 50<br>
mM EDTA, pH 7.2) as buffer B.<br>
(xi) G-CSF (Neupogeo®) employing sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, 0.15 M NaCl, 50<br>
mM EDTA, pH 7.2) as buffer B.<br>
(xii) G-CSF (Granocyte®) employing a 1 : 1 (v/v) mixture of sodium phosphate buffer<br>
(0.1 M, 0.15 M NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, pH 7.2) and 8 M urea, 1 % SDS, pH 7.4 as<br>
buffer B.<br>
(xiii) G-CSF (Neupogen®) employing a 1 : 1 (v/v) mixture of sodium phosphate buffer<br>
(0.1 M, 0.15 M NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, pH 7.2) and 8 M urea, 1 % SDS, pH 7.4 as<br>
buffer B.<br>
(xiv) G-CSF (Granocyte®) employing 8 M urea, 1 % SDS, pH 7.4 as buffer B.<br>
(xv) G-CSF (Neupogen®) employing 8 M urea, 1 % SDS, pH 7.4 as buffer B.<br>
Example 4: Synthesis of G-CSF conjugates by reaction of hydroxyethyl<br>
starch having a reactive ester group with G-CSF<br>
Example 4.1:<br>
Oxo-HES 10/0.4 (MW = 10,559 D, DS = 0.4) was prepared by Supramol Parenteral<br>
Colloids GmbH, Rosbach-Rodheim, D; according to DE 196 28 705 Al. The degree of<br>
oxidation of oxo-HES was 95 %<br>
66 mg of oxo-HES 10/0.4 were dissolved in 0.5 ml anhydrous DMF. To this solution, 3.4<br>
mg of N,N'-disuccinimidyl carbonate were added, and the mixture was stirred for 2 h at<br>
room temperature. The resulting solution had a reactive HES concentration of 13 percent<br>
by weight.<br>
A solution of G-CSF (Strathmann Biotec AG, Hamburg, D), having a concentration of<br>
about 0.5 mg G-CSF/ml, was concentrated to a concentration of 10 rag/ml by<br>
ultracentrifugation at a cut-off of 10 kD using a cooling centrifuge.<br>
To 0.5 ml of this concentrated G-CSF solution, 180 ul of a sodium bicarbonate solution<br>
were added. Subsequently, 3 portions (100 ul each) of the reactive HES solution were<br>
added dropwise to the protein solution, until, after about 30 min., the reaction had come to<br>
an end. Thus, the overall molar ratio of reactive HES : G-CSF was 20 : 1. Then, the pH of<br>
the mixture was adjusted to 4.0 using 0.1 N HC1.<br>
A HPGPC analysis (High-Performance Gel Permeation Chromatography) gave a yield of<br>
about 70 %. This result is shown in Fig. 9.<br>
The mixture could be stored at 4 °C at a pH of 4.0 for 4 d and, according to HPGPC<br>
analyses, remained stable, i.e. unchanged.<br>
Downgrading the content of the mixture regarding reaction by-products such as nonreacted<br>
oxo-HES and free N-hydroxysuccinimide as well as solvent using a 10 kD<br>
ultrafiltration membrane in a cooling centrifuge was possible without difficulties. The<br>
results of this downgrading experiment is shown in Fig. 10.<br>
Example 4.2:<br>
Oxo-HES 10/0.4 (MW = 10,559 D, DS = 0.4) was prepared by Supramol Parenteral<br>
Colloids GmbH, Rosbach-Rodheim, D; according to DE 196 28 705 Al. The degree of<br>
oxidation of oxo-HES was 95 %<br>
400 mg of oxo-HES 10/0.4 were dissolved in 1 ml anhydrous DMF. To this solution, 21 mg<br>
of N,N'-disuccinimidyl carbonate were added, and the mixture was stirred for 2 h at room<br>
temperature. The resulting solution had a reactive HES concentration of 40 percent by<br>
weight.<br>
A solution of G-CSF (Strathmann Biotec AG, Hamburg, D), having a concentration of<br>
about 0.5 mg G-CSF/ml, was concentrated to a concentration of 10 mg/ml by<br>
ultracentrifugation at a cut-off of 10 kD using a cooling centrifuge.<br>
To 0.5 ml of this concentrated G-CSF solution, 180 ul of a sodium bicarbonate solution<br>
were added. Subsequently, 3 portions (100 ul each) of the reactive HES solution were<br>
added dropwise to the protein solution, until, after about 30 min., the reaction had come to<br>
an end. Thus, the overall molar ratio of reactive HES : G-CSF was about 50 : 1. Then, the<br>
pH of the mixture was adjusted to 4.0 using 0.1 N HC1.<br>
A HPGPC analysis (High-Performance Gel Permeation Chromatography) gave a yield of<br>
more than 95 %. No non-reacted G-CSF could be detected. This result is shown hi Fig. 11.<br>
The mixture was purified using uhrafihration technology without difficulties. The results<br>
of thes downgrading is shown in Fig. 12.<br>
Examples<br>
5.1. Purification<br>
Purified G-CSF having essentially the same characteristics as the commercial product<br>
Neupogen ® (Amgen) was obtained and one aliquot was kept unmodified as a control.<br>
5.2 Synthesis of conjugates of HES and G-CSF<br>
Conjugates were synthesized essentially as described in Example 4.2, but with Oxo-<br>
HES50/0.7 (sample code A60), or as described in Example 2.5 (sample code A32), and<br>
used for further buffer exchange and purification.<br>
5.3 Buffer exchange of G-CSF and HES-modified G-CSF samples before purification<br>
by anion-exchange chromatography<br>
HES-modified G-CSF samples or unmodified G-CSF (as a control) (0.5 - 5 mg protein )<br>
were subjected to buffer exchange using Vivaspin 6 Concentrator units ( 10.000 MWCO<br>
PES, Vivascience, Cat. Nr. VS0602). Samples were concentrated to 0.5-0.7 ml and were<br>
diluted to 5 ml with 10 mM Na-phosphate buffer pH 7.2. Each sample was subjected 3<br>
times to this concentration/buffer exchange cycle.<br>
5.4 Anion exchange chromatography of G-CSF and HES-modified forms thereof on a<br>
DEAE-Sepharose column<br>
G-CSF samples after HES-modification and, for comparison, samples of unmodified GCSF<br>
were purified and analyzed by anion exchange chromatography at room temperature<br>
by using an AKTA explorer 10 system as described. Aliquots of G-CSF either before or<br>
after HESylation were dialyzed by ultrafiltration against said buffer A (10 mM Naphosphate,<br>
pH 7.2) or were diluted with about 13 volumes of buffer A. The column<br>
containing 2 ml DEAE-Sepharose (DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B, Pharmacia Kat. Nr. 17-0710-<br>
01) was regenerated by applying 5.0 column volumes (CV) of 6.5 M guanidine/HCl, 5.0<br>
CV buffer A, 5.0 CV of buffer C (1.5 M NaCl in 10 mM Na-phosphate, pH 7.2) and then<br>
10 CV of buffer A. The samples (0.8 - 4.5 ml in 10 mM Na-phosphate buffer pH 7.2)<br>
were then injected by using a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Following washing of the sample<br>
loop with 10 ml (2 ml sample loop) or 20 ml (5 ml sample loop) buffer A, depending on<br>
the sample applied, the column was further washed with 0-22 CV of buffer A (flow rate =<br>
0.8 ml/min). Elution was performed by applying a linear gradient from 0-100% buffer B<br>
over 5 CV and an isocratic run with 2.5 CV of 100% buffer B using a flow rate of 0.6<br>
ml/min. The column was re-equilibrated with 5 CV of buffer A and was regenerated as<br>
detailed above by using a flow rate of 1 ml/min.<br>
If required, samples were concentrated using a Vivaspin concentrator and buffer exchange<br>
was performed as described above. Samples were stored at 0-8°C in 10 mM Na-Acetat<br>
buffer pH 4.0 before or after sterile filtration using a 0.2 ^m filtrations unit, Coming, Cat.<br>
No. 431215). The following samples were prepared for in-vitro bioassays and for further<br>
analytical analysis. Protein concentration was determined as described in section 6.1<br>
below:<br>
I. 0401-15/A33, 0.44 mg/ml, volume = 500 ^il<br>
G-CSF (E.coli)<br>

5.5. Further analysis of G-CSF samples<br>
Aliquots of the samples were analyzed for their protein content and for modifications,<br>
5.5(a) G-CSF protein quantitation by RP-HPLC<br>
G-CSF protein content of the samples was quantitated using the unmodified protein<br>
preparation (concentration : 0.453 mg/ml) as a standard.<br>
A Dionex HPLC system consisting of a pump P 680 A HPG, degassing unit Degasys DG<br>
1210, an autosainpler and injector ASI-100, a sample loop 250 ul, a thermostatted column<br>
department TCC 100 along with a W/Vis-Detektor UVD170U equipped with a Software<br>
Chromeleon Chromatography Management System was used. A precolumn CC 8/4<br>
Nucleosil 120-5 C4, Macherey-Nagel, Cat No. 721889, and a separation column 40 O4<br>
Nucleosil MPN, 5 urn, 125 x 4 mm RP-cohram (Macherey-Nagel, ordering No.7200<br>
45.40) were used. Solvent A was KfeO phis 0,06 % (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and solvent B<br>
was 90 % acetonhrile inHbO, containing 0,06 % (v/v)trifhK&gt;roacetic acid; flow rate was : 1<br>
ml/min. UV detection was at 214,221,260 and at 280 nm wavelength.<br>
Samples of approximately 10 - 20 ug were injected into a RP-HPLC column. The<br>
following gradient was used:<br>
0-5 min: 0-10 %B<br>
- 17 min: 10-45 %B<br>
- 35 min: 45-80 %B<br>
- 36 min: 80-100 %B<br>
- 38 min: 100 %B<br>
- 39 min: 10 %B<br>
- 45 min: 10 %B<br>
The resulting peak area at the elution position of the standard G-CSF preparation was used<br>
and compared to the reference standard by comparing the peak appearing at around 29min<br>
at 280 nm wavelength.<br>
5.5(b) Reduction + carboxamidomethylation of G-CSF protein<br>
Aliquots from the G-CSF protein samples were reduced and carboxamidomethylated as<br>
described elsewhere (Guillermina Fomo, Mariela Bollati Fogolin, Marcos Oggero,<br>
Ricardo Kratje, Marina Etcheverrigaray, Harald S. Conradt, Manfred Nimtz (2004) N- and<br>
0-linked carbohydrates and glycosylation site occupancy in recombinant human<br>
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor secreted by a Chinese hamster ovary<br>
cell line; European J. Biochem, 273(5), 907-919). Carboxamidomethylation leads to<br>
modified cystein residues. Endoproteinase Glu-C digestion of the carboxamidomethylated<br>
protein was performed in 25 mM NItiHCOa containing 1 M urea at pH 7,8 and using an<br>
enzyme /substrate ratio of 0.2:10 for 18 - 24 hours.<br>
5.5(c) Separation of Endo-Glu-C peptides by RP-HPLC<br>
The peptides generated by the Endo-Glu-C digestion were separated on a Dionex HPLC<br>
system consisting of a pump P 680 A HPG, degassing unit Degasys DG 1210, an<br>
autosampler and injector ASI-100, a sample loop 250 ul, a thermostatted column<br>
(Jepartment TCC 100 along with a UV/Vis-Detektor UVD170U equipped with a Software<br>
Chromeleon Chromatography Management System was used. A precolumn CC 8/4<br>
Nucleosil 120-5 C4, Macherey-Nagel, Cat. No. 721889, and a separation column 40 C-4<br>
Nucleosil MPN, 5 urn, 125 x 4 mm RP-cohann (Macherey-Nagel, ordering No.7200<br>
45.40) were used. Solvent A was H2O plus 0,06 % (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and solvent B<br>
was 90 % acetonitrile inHzO, containing 0,06 % (v/v)trifluoroacetic acid; flow rate was : 1<br>
ml/min. The following gradient was applied:<br>
0-5 min: 10%B<br>
- 17 min: 45 %B<br>
- 65 min: 100 %B<br>
- 67 min: 100 %B<br>
- 69 min: 10 %B<br>
- 75 min: 10 %B<br>
UV detection was at 214 ,221, 260 and at 280 nm wavelength. Peptides generated by the<br>
Endo-Glu-C digestion were separated (data not shown).<br>
5.5(d) Analysis of proteolyric peptides by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/<br>
lonization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI/TOF/TOF-MS)<br>
Mass spectrometry was used to detect the intact N-terminus of G-CSF's hi the different<br>
samples prepared. Samples (3-5 ug) resulting from Endoproteinase Glu-C digestions of<br>
reduced and carboxamidomethylated protein samples were used directly for MS-analysis<br>
(without the RP-HPLC of step 6.3) and purified using ZipTip pipette tips containing<br>
Cl 8 reversed-phase material according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing<br>
with 0.1%(v/v) formic acid, elution of peptides was performed with 10 ul 0.1% (v/v)<br>
formic acid in 60% (v/v) acetonitrile.<br>
Proteolytic (Endo-Glu-C ) peptide fragments were analyzed with a Bruker ULTRAFLEX<br>
time-of-flight (TOF/TOF) instrument in the linear positive ion mode using a matrix of<br>
22.4 mg 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid hi 400 ul acetonitrile and 600 ul 0.1%<br>
(v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in tbO; (glyco)-peptides were measured using a matrix of 19 mg<br>
a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid hi the same solvent mixture using the reflectron for<br>
enhanced resolution. Sample solutions of 1 ul and an approximate concentration of 1-10<br>
pmol-ul"1 were mixed with equal amounts of the respective matrix. This mixture was<br>
spotted onto a stainless steel target and dried at room temperature before analysis. Spectra<br>
were recorded in the mass range 900 - 5000 dalton. The following Table correlates the<br>
expected masses with the respective G-CSF peptides.<br>
Table: Theoretical (monoisotopic] masses of Endo-Glu-C peptides resulting from (Table Removed)<br>
Cystein residues were carboxamidomethylated; peptides marked as fat were detected in<br>
MALDI/TOF spectrum of the non modified G-CSF.<br>
The N-terminal Endo-Glu-C peptide (MTPLGPASSLPQSFLLKCLE; m/z 2189.1) comprising<br>
position 1 -20 of the protein was detected in MALDI/TOF-MS spectra of samples<br>
after proteolytic treatment of G-CSF with endoproteinase Glu-C as described above.<br>
5.6. Results<br>
5.6(a) Purification of G-CSF and HES modified variants<br>
A32, A60 and non modified G-CSF were subjected to purification using a DEAESepharose<br>
CL-6B column as described under A4.<br>
In the case of the unmodified sample 0401-15/A33, no significant absorption at 280 nm<br>
was detected in the flow-through and the protein eluted at a concentration of 40-50%<br>
buffer B (0.16-020 M NaCl) in a volume of 6 ml, with a specific peak area of 660 mAU x<br>
ml x mg"1 at 280 nm.<br>
The sample 0401-14/A32 (derived from 0401-15/A33; HESylation with AldehydoHES<br>
10/0.4) eluted over a large range of the gradient at a concentration of buffer B from 20-<br>
80% (0.08-0.32 M NaCl) in a volume of 12 ml. About 90% of the total peak area detected<br>
at 280 nm was found in the flow-through, containing about 50% of the total protein with an<br>
apparently slightly higher molecular mass when compared to the eluted protein, as detected<br>
by SDS-PAGE analysis as shown in Figure 13 above.<br>
The sample 0402-03/A60 (HESylated with HES 10/0.4, following the overall procedure of<br>
Example 4.2) eluted in a volume of 10.5 ml at a similar concentration of 20-80% buffer B.<br>
In this case, about 35% of the total peak area detected at 280 nm was found in the flowthrough,<br>
however, by SDS-PAGE analysis, no unbound protein was detected in this<br>
fraction. When compared to the specific peak area of sample 0401-15/A33, the protein<br>
content in the eluate of the sample 0402-03/A60 was 45% higher than the stated protein<br>
amount that was applied to the column.<br>
Recovery of proteins was calculated based on the peak area (A280 nm) of the eluting<br>
fractions compared to the non modified G-CSF protein.<br>
Table 1: Comparison of the peak areas at 280 nm detection<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
** RP-HPLC quantitation of the protein confirmed these results<br>
5.6(b) Analysis of proteins by peptide mapping and MALDI/TOF MS<br>
after treatment with endoproteinase Glu-C<br>
The N-terminal peptide resulting from endoproteinase Glu-C digestion of both the carboxamidomethylated<br>
unmodified G-CSF (Figure 14) and fee market product Neupogen (data<br>
not shown), was clearly detected by MALDI/TOF-MS (MFPLGPASSLPQSFLLKC*LE,<br>
m/z 2189.1; cystein carboxamidomethylated). This signal was absent in samples subjected<br>
to HES-modification by reductive animation (Figure 15) and in Neulasta (data not shown),<br>
indicating modification of mis peptide. In the case of HES-modified G-CSF, wherein<br>
modification was carried out by activated ester chemistry, the N-terminal peptide was<br>
detected at a relative signal intensity comparable to that of the non modified starting<br>
material A32 (Figure 16) indicating that HES modification of this derivatives has been<br>
achieved at different amino acid side chains.<br>
N-terminal sequencing of HES modified G-CSF (sample A3 3 and the market product<br>
Neulasta) revealed a blocked N-terminus suggesting that in fact the N-terminal methionine<br>
residue of this protein derivative is modified by HES derivative. Since the signal<br>
corresponding to the peptide comprising amino acid residues pos.35-47<br>
(KLCATYKLCHPEE; both cysteine residues carboxamidomethylated m/z 1648.78) was<br>
not detected in sample A60, it is concluded that one or both lysine residues (at pos 35 and<br>
pos 41) might be modified by HES.<br>

Example 6: In vitro results of the G-CSF-conjugate obtained in Examples<br>
2.5 and 4.2 and purified according to Example 5: Mitogenicity<br>
of G-CSF variants for mouse NFS-60 cells<br>
G-CSF is known for its specific effects on the proliferation, differentiation, an activation of<br>
hematopoietic cells of the neutrophilic granulocyte lineage. The mitogenic capacity of GCSF<br>
variants was tested using mouse NFS-60 cells (N. Shirafuji et al., Exp. Hematol.<br>
1989, 17, 116-119). Cells grown in RPMI medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco<br>
INVITROGEN GmbH, Karlsruhe, D) containing 5-10 % WEHI-3B (DSMZ,<br>
Braunschweig, D; cultivated as described by the DSMZ) conditioned medium as source of<br>
exogenous<br>
IL-3 were harvested by centrifugation, washed and aliquoted at 100,000 cells<br>
per well in a 24-well plate. Cells were allowed to adapt for 1 hour at 37 °C in RPMI<br>
medium without WEHI-3B conditioned media before G-CSF growth factors sample<br>
diluted in the same media were added. NFS-60 cells were exposed to purified G-CSF<br>
variants for 3 days at 37°C and than the cells were electronically counted (Casy TT Cell<br>
Counter, Scharfe System, Reutlingen, D). The results are summarised in Figure 12. As<br>
seen in Figure 12, the different G-CSF variants (0.5 - 50 pg/ml) were able to stimulate an<br>
increase hi the number of cells after 3 days compared to medium that did not contain added<br>
growth factors.<br>
Unmodified control proteins G-CSF/A33 and G-CSF/A58 stimulated cells at a very similar<br>
extend (ED50=5 - 10 pg/ml) while G-CSF conjugates G-CSF/A60 G-CSF/A32 and GCSF/<br>
A57 showed only a minor decrease in activity if compared to the unmodified version<br>
(ED50=10-25pg/ml).<br>

carbonate were added, and the mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The<br>
resulting solution had a reactive HES concentration of 40 percent by weight.<br>
A solution of G-CSF (Strathmann Biotec AG, Hamburg, D), having a concentration of<br>
about 0.5 mg G-CSF/ml, was concentrated to a concentration of 10 mg/ml by<br>
ultracentrifugation at a cut-off of 100 kD using a cooling centrifuge.<br>

were added. Subsequently, 3 portions (100 ul each) of the reactive HES solution were<br>
added dropwise to the protein solution, until, after about 30 min., the reaction had come to<br>
an end. Thus, the overall molar ratio of reactive HES : G-CSF was about 50 : 1. Then, the<br>
pH of the mixture was adjusted to 4.0 using 0.1 N HC1.<br>

Mitogenicity of G-CSF variants for mouse NFS-60 cells<br>
G-CSF is known for its specific effects on the proliferation, differentiation and activation<br>
of hematopoietic cells of the neutrophflic granulocyte lineage. The mitogenic capacity of<br>
G-CSF variants was tested using mouse NFS-60 cells (N. Shirafuji et al., Exp. Hematol.<br>
1989, 17, 116-119). Cells grown in RPM medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco<br>

Braunschweig, D; cultivated as described by the DSMZ) conditioned medium as source of<br>
exogenous IL-3 were harvested by centrifugation, washed and aliquoted at 100,000 cells<br>
per well in a 24-well plate. Cells were allowed to adapt for 1 hour at 37°C in RPMI<br>
medium without WEHI-3B conditioned media before G-CSF growth factor samples<br>
diluted in the same media were added. NFS-60 cells were exposed to purified G-CSF<br>
variants (purification according to examples 5.3, 5.4, protein quantification according to<br>
