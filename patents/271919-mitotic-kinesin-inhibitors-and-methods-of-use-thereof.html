	MITOTIC KINESIN INHIBITORS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]		Related Applications<br>
[0002]		The present application claims priority of U.S. Provisional Patent<br>
Application No. 60/620,048 filed October 19, 2004 and entitled MITOTIC KINESIN<br>
INHIBITORS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF, and also of a U.S. Non-provisional<br>
Patent Applciation filed October 17, 2005 also entitled MITOTIC KINESIN<br>
INHIBITORS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF naming the same co-inventors as the<br>
present application and designated Attorney Docket No. ARR013 CIP, both of which<br>
applications are incorporated herein in their entireties by this reference.<br>
[0003]		Field of the Invention<br>
[0004]		This invention relates to novel inhibitors of mitotic kinesins, in particular<br>
the mitotic kinesin KSP, pharmaceutical compositions containing the inhibitors, and<br>
methods for preparing these inhibitors. The compounds of this invention are useful for the<br>
treatment of diseases that can be treated by inhibiting mitosis, including cellular<br>
proliferative diseases, for example cancer, hyperplasias, restenosis, cardiac hypertrophy,<br>
immune disorders, fungal infections, and inflammation.<br>
[0005]		Description of the state of the art<br>
[0006]		ong the therapeutic agents used to treat cancer are the taxanes and vinca<br>
alkaloids, which act on microtubules. Microtubules are the primary structural elements of<br>
the mitotic spindle, which is responsible for distribution of replicate copies of the genome<br>
to each of the two daughter cells that result from cell division. It is presumed that<br>
disruption of mitotic spindle by these drugs results in inhibition of cancer cell division and<br>
induction of cancer cell death. However, microtubules form other types of cellular<br>
structures, including tracks for intracellular transport in nerve processes. Because drugs<br>
such as taxanes and vinca alkaloids do not specifically target mitotic spindles, they have<br>
side effects that limit their usefulness.<br>
[0007]		provements in the specificity of agents used to treat cancer is of<br>
considerable interest, in part because of the improved therapeutic benefits which would be<br>
realized if the side effects associated with administration of these agents could be reduced.<br>
\\\DE- 80248/0068- 245568 v2<br><br>
WO 2006/044825 	PCT/US2005/037305<br>
Traditionally, dramatic improvements in the treatment of cancer have been associated with<br>
identification of therapeutic agents acting through novel mechanisms. Examples include<br>
not only the taxanes, but also the camptothecin class of topoisomerase I inhibitors. From<br>
both of these perspectives, mitotic kinesins are attractive targets for new anti-cancer<br>
agents.<br>
[0008]		totic kinesins are enzymes essential for assembly and function of the<br>
mitotic spindle, but are not generally part of other microtubule structures such as nerve<br>
processes. Mitotic kinesins play essential roles during all phases of mitosis. These<br>
enzymes are "molecular motors" that transform energy released by hydrolysis of ATP into<br>
mechanical force, which drives the directional movement of cellular cargoes along<br>
microtubules. The catalytic domain sufficient for this task is a compact structure of<br>
approximately 340 amino acids. During mitosis, kinesins organize microtubules into the<br>
bipolar structure that is the mitotic spindle. Kinesins mediate movement of chromosomes<br>
along spindle microtubules, as well as structural changes in the mitotic spindle associated<br>
with specific phases of mitosis. Experimental perturbation of mitotic kinesin function<br>
causes malformation or dysfunction of the mitotic spindle, frequently resulting in cell<br>
cycle arrest and cell death.<br>
[0009]		ong the identified mitotic kinesins is kinesin spindle protein (KSP).<br>
KSP belongs to an evolutionarily conserved kinesin subfamily of plus end-directed<br>
microtubule motors that assemble into bipolar homotetramers consisting of antiparallel<br>
homodimers. During mitosis, KSP associates with microtubules of the mitotic spindle.<br>
Microinjection of antibodies directed against KSP into human cells prevents spindle pole<br>
separation during prometaphase, giving rise to monopolar spindles and causing mitotic<br>
arrest and induction of programmed cell death. KSP and related kinesins in other non-<br>
human organisms bundle antiparallel microtubules and slide them relative to one another,<br>
thus forcing the spindle poles apart. KSP may also mediate in anaphse B spindle<br>
elongation and focusing of microtubules at the spindle pole.<br>
[0010]		man KSP (also termed HsEg5) has been described (Blangy, et al., Cell,<br>

[00119]	It is to be understood that in instances where two or more radicals are used<br>
in succession to define a substituent attached to a structure, the first named radical is<br>
considered to be terminal and the last named radical is considered to be attached to the<br>
structure in question. Thus, for example, an arylalkyl radical is attached to the structure in<br>
question by the alkyl group.<br>
[00120]	The compounds of this invention may possess one or more asymmetric<br>
centers; such compounds can therefore be produced as individual (R)- or (S)-stereoisomers<br>
or as mixtures thereof. Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a<br>
particular compound in the specification and claims is intended to include both individual<br>
enantiomers, diastereomers mixtures, racemic or otherwise, thereof. Accordingly, this<br>
invention also includes all such isomers, including diastereomeric mixtures, pure<br>
diastereomers and pure enantiomers of the compounds of Formulas I-IV.<br>
[00121]	The term "enantiomer" refers to two stereoisomers of a compound which<br>
are non-superimposable mirror images of one another. The term "diastereomer" refers to a<br>
pair of optical isomers which are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have<br>
different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and<br>
reactivities.<br>
[00122]	The compounds of the present invention may also exist in different<br>
tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. The<br>
term "tautomer" or "tautomeric form" refers to structural isomers of different energies<br>
which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also<br>
known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such<br>
as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include<br>
interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.<br>
[00123]	In the structures shown herein, where the stereochemistry of any particular<br>
chiral atom is not specified, then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the<br>

compounds of the invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or<br>
dashed line representing a particular configuration, then that stereoisomer is so specified<br>
and defined.<br>
[00124]	In addition to compounds of Formulas I-IV, the invention also includes<br>
solvates, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of<br>
such compounds. The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" indicates that the substance<br>
or composition must be compatible chemically and/or toxicologically, with the other<br>
ingredients comprising a formulation, and/or the mammal being treated therewith.<br>
[00125]	The term "solvate" refers to an aggregate of a molecule with one or more<br>
solvent molecules.<br>
[00126]	A "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug" is a compound that may be<br>
converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to the specified compound or to<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of such compound. Prodrugs include compounds<br>
wherein an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or<br>
four) amino acid residues, is covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free<br>
amino, hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of a compound of the present invention. The<br>
amino acid residues include but are not limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids<br>
commonly designated by three letter symbols and also includes phosphoserine,<br>
phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine, 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, demosine,<br>
isodemosine, gamma-carboxyglutamate, hippuric acid, octahydroindole-2-carboxylic acid,<br>
statine, l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, penicillamine, ornithine, 3-<br>
methylhistidine, norvaline, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, cirtulline,<br>
homocysteine, homoserine, methyl-alanine, para-benzoylphenylalanine, phenylglycine,<br>
propargylglycine, sarcosine, methionine sulfone and tert-butylglycine. Particular<br>
examples of prodrugs of this invention include a compound of Formula I-IV covalently<br>
joined to a phosphate residue or a valine residue.<br>
[00127]	Additional types of prodrugs are also encompassed. For instance, free<br>
carboxyl groups can be derivatized as amides or alkyl esters. As another example,<br>
compounds of this invention comprising free hydroxy groups may be derivatized as<br>
prodrugs by converting the hydroxy group into groups such as, but not limited to,<br>
phosphate ester, hemisuccinate, dimethylaminoacetate, or<br>
phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyl groups, as outlined in Advanced Drug Delivery<br>
Reviews, 1996, 19, 115. Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups are also<br>
26<br>
\\\DE- 80248/0068- 245568 v2 <br>
WO 2006/044825 	PCT/US2005/037305<br>
included, as are carbonate prodrugs, sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups.<br>
Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and (acyloxy)ethyl ethers wherein<br>
the acyl group may be an alkyl ester, optionally substituted with groups including, but not<br>
limited to, ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is an<br>
amino acid ester as described above, are also encompassed. Prodrugs of this type are<br>
described in J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39, 10. More specific examples include replacement of<br>
the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as (Ci-C6)alkanoyloxymethyl,<br>
1 -((C i -C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, 1 -methyl-1 -((C i -C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl,<br>
(C i-C6)alkoxycarbonyloxym ethyl, N-(C i -C6)alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl,<br>
(Ci-Ce)alkanoyl, a-amino(C]-C4)alkanoyl5 arylacyl and a-aminoacyl, or a-aminoacyl-a-<br>
aminoacyl, where each a-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally<br>
occurring L-amino acids, P(O)(OH)2, -P(O)(O(Ci-C6)alkyl)2 or glycosyl (the radical<br>
resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate).<br>
[00128]	Free amines of compounds of this invention can also be derivatized as<br>
amides, sulfonamides or phosphonamides. All of these prodrug moieties may incorporate<br>
groups including, but not limited to, ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities. For<br>
example, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine<br>
group with a group such as R-carbonyl, RO-carbonyl, NRR'-carbonyl where R and R' are<br>
each independently (Ci-Cio)alkyl, (C3-C7)cycloalkyl, benzyl, or R-carbonyl is a natural a-<br>
aminoacyl or natural cc-aminoacyl-natural a-aminoacyl, -C(OH)C(O)OY wherein Y is H,<br>

the art.<br>
[00130]	A "pharmaceutically acceptable salt," unless otherwise indicated, includes<br>
salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the free acids and bases of the specified<br>
compound and that are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. A compound of the<br>
invention may possess a sufficiently acidic, a sufficiently basic, or both functional groups,<br>
and accordingly react with any of a number of inorganic or organic bases or acids to form<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include<br>
those salts prepared by reaction of the compounds of the present invention with a mineral<br>
or organic acid or an inorganic base, such salts including sulfates, pyrosulfates, bisulfates,<br>
sulfites, bisulfites, phosphates, monohydrogenphosphates, dihydrogenphosphates,<br>
metaphosphates, pyrophosphates, chlorides, bromides, iodides, acetates, propionates,<br>

butyn-l,4-dioates, hexyne-l,6-dioates, benzoates, chlorobenzoates, methylbenzoates,<br>
dinitrobenzoates, hydroxybenzoates, methoxybenzoates, phthalates, sulfonates,<br>
xylenesulfonates, phenylacetates, phenylpropionates, phenylbutyrates, citrates, lactates, y-<br>
hydroxybutyrates, glycollates, tartrates, methanesulfonates, propanesulfonates,<br>
naphthalene-1-sulfonates, naphthalene-2-sulfonates, and mandelates. Since a single<br>
compound of the present invention may include more than one acidic or basic moiety, the<br>
compounds of the present invention may include mono, di or tri-salts in a single<br>
compound.<br>
[00131]	If the inventive compound is a base, the desired pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art, for example,<br>
treatment of the free base with an acidic compound, for example an inorganic acid such as<br>
hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the<br>
like, or with an organic acid, such as acetic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, mandelic acid,<br>
fumaric acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, a<br>
pyranosidyl acid such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid such<br>
as citric acid or tartaric acid, an amino acid such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid, an<br>
aromatic acid such as benzoic acid or cinnamic acid, a sulfonic acid such as p-<br>
toluenesulfonic acid or ethanesulfonic acid, or the like.<br>

acid with an inorganic or organic base. Examples of suitable inorganic salts include those<br>
formed with alkali and alkaline earth metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, barium<br>
and calcium. Examples of suitable organic base salts include, for example, ammonium,<br>
dibenzylammonium, benzylammonium, 2-hydroxyethylammonium, bis(2-<br>
hydroxyethyl)ammonium, phenylethylbenzylamine, dibenzyl-ethylenediamine, and the<br>
like salts. Other salts of acidic moieties may include, for example, those salts formed with<br>
procaine, quinine and N-methylglucosamine, plus salts formed with basic amino acids<br>
such as glycine, ornithine, histidine, phenylglycine, lysine and arginine.<br>
[00133]	The present invention also embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of the<br>
present invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or<br>
more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from<br>
the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. All isotopes of any particular<br>
atom or element as specified is contemplated within the scope of the compounds of the<br>
invention, and their uses. Exemplary isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of<br>
the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur,<br>
fluorine, chlorine and iodine, such as 2H, 3H, "C, 13C, 14C, 13N, 15N, I5O, 17O, 180,32P, 33P,<br>
35S, 18F, 36C1, 123I and 125I. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present<br>
invention (e.g., those labeled with H and ' C) are useful in compound and/or substrate<br>
tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., 3H) and carbon-14 (i.e., 14C) isotopes are useful<br>
for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes<br>
such as deuterium (i.e., 2H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from<br>
greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage<br>
requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Positron emitting<br>
isotopes such as 15O, 13N, "C and 18F are useful for positron emission tomography (PET)<br>
studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds of the<br>
present invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those<br>
disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples herein below, by substituting an<br>
isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.<br>
[00134]	Also falling within the scope of this invention are metabolites of<br>
compounds of Formulas I-IV. A "metabolite" is a pharmacologically active product<br>
produced through metabolism in the body of a specified compound or salt thereof.<br>
Metabolites may result, for example, from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation,<br>
deamidation, esterification, deesterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the<br>

administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes metabolites of compounds<br>
of Formulas I-IV, including compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a<br>
compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a<br>
metabolic product thereof.<br>
[00135]	Metabolites typically are identified by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g., 14C<br>
or 3H) isotope of a compound of the invention, administering it parenterally in a detectable<br>
dose (e.g., greater than about 0.5 mg/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig,<br>
monkey, or to a human, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about<br>
30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or<br>
other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others<br>
are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the<br>
metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g., by<br>
MS, LC/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way<br>
as conventional drug metabolism studies well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Metabolites, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic<br>
assays for therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention.<br>
[00136]	The inventive compounds may be prepared using the reaction routes and<br>
synthesis schemes as described below, employing the techniques available in the art using<br>
starting materials that are readily available or can be synthesized using methods known in<br>
the art. Illustrations of the preparation of certain compounds of the present invention are<br>

Acid 1-1 can be coupled with tert-butyl carbazate using standard coupling procedures<br>
including, but not limited to, EDCI/HOBt, PyBOP, or DIC to produce intermediate 1-2.<br>
Removal of the terf-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group of 1-2 can be achieved by treatment with<br>
a variety of acids including, but not limited to, TFA and HCl/dioxane to give acid<br>
hydrazide 1-3. 1-3 can then be condensed with ketone 1-4 to provide intermediate 1-5<br>
utilizing a variety of acid catalysts. In one embodiment, compounds 1-3 and 1-4 are<br>
combined in ethanol with added acetic acid and heated at elevated temperature (95 °C) to<br>
provide compound 1-5. Oxadiazolines 1-6 can be prepared by combining 1-5 with the<br>
appropriate anhydride or acid chloride or carboxylic acid in the presence of a standard<br>
coupling agent. For example, oxadiazoline 1-6 can be prepared by treatment with excess<br>
anhydride at elevated temperatures in an appropriate organic solvent such as DCE.<br>
Alternatively, treatment of 1-5 with acid chloride and an appropriate base, such as pyridine<br>
or Et3N, in a variety of organic solvents such as DCM or DCE at room temperature affords<br>
oxadiazoline 1-6. Alternatively, 1-6 can be prepared through coupling with anhydrides, or<br>
through treatment of 1-5 with the appropriate carboxylic acid and AC2O in DCE at elevated<br>
temperature (80 °C). Oxadiazoline 1-6 can be obtained by treatment of 1-5 with a<br>
carboxylic acid and amide-coupling reagent, including but not limited to EDCI/HOBT or<br>
diethyl cyanophosphonate, and appropriate base, Et3N or DIEA, in a suitable organic<br>
solvent such as DCM, DCE, DMF, THF, or solvent mixture at room temperature or above.<br>
In certain embodiments, this coupling is accomplished with diethyl cyanophosphonate and<br>
TEA in DCE at elevated temperature (80 °C) to provide 1-6.<br>

II-4, II-5, H-6 and II-7. Thiohydrazide II-l (Takasugi, J. J.; Buckwalter, B. L., EP Patent<br>
No. 1004241) can be condensed with ketone H-2 in an appropriate organic solvent such as<br>
ethanol to give thiodiazoline II-3. In certain embodiments, the condensation can be<br>
catalyzed by acetic acid. Thiodiazoline II-3 can be functionalized to produce II-4 by<br>
standard coupling procedures including, but not limited to, EDCI/HOBt, PyBOP, HATU,<br>
or DIC and the appropriate carboxylic acid. Alternatively, compound II-4 can be prepared<br>
by treatment of II-3 with the appropriate acid chloride and amine base in a suitable<br>
organic solvent such as THF. A compound of formula H-5 can be prepared by reacting<br>
compound II-3 with the appropriate carbamyl chloride in the presence of an amine base.<br>
Alternatively, a compound of formula II-5 can be prepared by treatment of a compound of<br>
formula II-3 with the appropriate isocyanate in an appropriate organic solvent such as<br>
THF. Another method for preparing compound II-5 comprises subjecting the appropriate<br>
amine to a carbonylating reagent such as, but not limited to, triphosgene, diphosgene,<br>
phosgene or carbonyldiimidazole, followed by treatment with II-3. In certain<br>
embodiments, the amine can be treated with triphosgene, Et3N and catalytic DMAP<br>

followed by II-3 to give II-5. Similarly, compounds of formula II-6 can be prepared by<br>
subjecting II-3 to a chloroformate in the presence of an amine base. Chloroformates can<br>
be prepared by subjecting alcohols to a carbonylating reagent, as described above.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formulae II-5, II-6 and II-7 can be prepared by treating II-3<br>
with carbonyldiimidazole followed by addition of Mel to generate the stable<br>
methylimidazolium iodide salt. Addition of an amine, alcohol, hydroxylamine or<br>
alkoxylamine in the presence of EtsN to the methylimidazolium iodide salt generates the<br>
analogs of formulae II-5, II-6, and II-7, respectively. Derivatives of formulae II-5, II-6<br>
and II-7 can be prepared from an intermediate 4-nitrophenyl carboxylate. Thiadiazoline<br>
II-3 can be treated with 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate in the presence of a suitable base such<br>
as DIEA or Et3N in a suitable organic solvent such as DCE or DCM at room temperature.<br>
Addition of amine, alcohol, hydroxylamine or alkoxylamine in the presence of a suitable<br>
base such as DIEA or Et3N to the 4-nitrophenyl carboxylate in a suitable organic solvent<br>
such as DCE or THF at elevated temperature affords the analogs of formulae II-5, H-6,<br>

functional groups that require protection in the reaction sequences described. The choice<br>
of protecting group and the deprotection conditions will depend on the functional group<br>
and is well known to those skilled in the art. Examples of use of protecting groups are<br>
described in Scheme III. These examples are representative only are not meant to limit the<br>

[00140]	Scheme III shows a method of preparing compounds of Formulas III-4,<br>
III-5 and IH-6. Compounds III-l and III-2 can be prepared as described in Schemes I<br>
and II using the appropriate ketone containing an amino group either masked as an azide<br>
or protected as a t-butyl carbamate. Amine HI-3 can be generated from azide III-l by a<br>
variety of methods including, but not limited to, Staudinger reaction with Pr^P/water and<br>
hydrogenation in the presence of Pd/C under 1 atm H2. Amine IH-3 can also be prepared<br>
from t-butyl carbamate III-2 by standard acidic deprotection conditions including but not<br>
limited to TFA in DCM, HC1 in a suitable organic solvent such as dioxane or diethyl ether,<br>
and neat formic acid. Once unmasked amine IH-3 can be further functionalized.<br>
Derivatives III-4, wherein R2 and R3 are independently selected from alkyl, alkenyl,<br>
alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl and cycloalkynyl groups, can be made using standard<br>
reductive amination conditions. These conditions include but are not limited to treatment<br>
of amine IH-3 with the appropriate aldehyde or ketone in the presence of dehydrating<br>
agents such as MgSo4 followed by reduction with NaBFL}, Na(OAc)3BH or NaCNBF^ in<br>
a suitable organic solvent such as DCM, DCE, acetonitrile or THF. Alternatively, amine<br>
IH-3 can be treated with the appropriate aldehyde or ketone in the presence of acetic acid<br>

and reducing agent such as Na(OAc)3BH or NaCNBH3 in suitable organic solvents such as<br>
DCM, DCE, acetonitrile or THF. In certain embodiments, III-3 and the appropriate<br>
aldehyde or ketone are combined in acetonitrile and stirred for 1 hour. Acetic acid and<br>
Na(OAc)3BH are then added and the reaction mixture is heated at an elevated temperature<br>
(45 °C) to afford III-4. Analogs III-4 where R2 or R3 is -C(=O)R6, -SO2R6, -<br>
C(=O)NR4R5, -SO2NR4R5, amino acid, or polypeptide can be prepared by standard<br>
methods known to those skilled in the art. These include but are not limited to treatment<br>
of amine IH-3 with acid chloride, sulfamoyl chloride, sulfonyl chloride or isocyanate in<br>
the presence or absence of tertiary amine base, and treatment of IH-3 with carboxylic acid,<br>
amino acid or polypeptide in the presence of standard coupling reagents including, but not<br>
limited to, EDCI/HOBt, PyBOP, HATU, or DIC. Derivatives of the formula III-5 may<br>
also be prepared by subjecting III-2 to a base such as NaH, KH, LiHMDS, NaHMDS,<br>
K.HMDS or other suitable base and an appropriate alkylating agent which may include, but<br>
is not limited to, alkyl halides, (un)substituted benzyl halides, (un)substituted allyl halides,<br>
(un)substituted propargyl halides, sulfonate esters and sulfate esters in a suitable solvent<br>
such as DMF or THF to afford III-5. III-6 can be prepared from III-5 by standard acidic<br>
deprotection conditions including, but not limited to, TFA in DCM, HC1 in a suitable<br>
organic solvent such as dioxane or diethyl ether, and neat formic acid. In certain<br>
embodiments, III-2 is treated with NaH in DMF followed by iodomethane to afford III-5<br>
wherein R2 is methyl. Removal of the BOC group is can be achieved, for example, with<br>
TFA in DCM to provide III-6. Alternatively, HI-6 can be generated from IH-3 by<br>
treatment with a suitable alkylating agent and a suitable base which may include, but is not<br>
limited to, a tertiary amine, K2CO3, Na2CO3, CS2CO3, or CsOH in an appropriate solvent<br>
such as acetonitrile, DMF or THF to afford HI-6.<br>
[00141]	In any of the synthetic methods for preparing compounds of Formula I-IV,<br>
it may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and/or from<br>
starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and/or<br>
purified to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art.<br>
Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction, crystallization from a solvent or<br>
solvent mixture, distillation, sublimation, or chromatography. Chromatography can<br>
involve any number of methods including, for example: reverse-phase and normal phase;<br>
size exclusion; ion exchange; high, medium and low pressure liquid chromatography<br>

preparative thin or thick layer chromatography, as well as techniques of small scale thin<br>
layer and flash chromatography.<br>
[00142]	Another class of separation methods involves treatment of a reaction<br>
mixture with a reagent selected to bind to or render otherwise separable a desired product,<br>
unreacted starting material, reaction by product, or the like. Such reagents include<br>
adsorbents or absorbents such as activated carbon, molecular sieves, ion exchange media,<br>
or the like. Alternatively, the reagents can be acids in the case of a basic material, bases in<br>
the case of an acidic material, binding reagents such as antibodies, binding proteins,<br>
selective chelators such as crown ethers, liquid/liquid ion extraction reagents (LIX), or the<br>
like.<br>
[00143]	Selection of appropriate methods of separation depends on the nature of the<br>
materials involved. For example, boiling point and molecular weight in distillation and<br>
sublimation, presence or absence of polar functional groups in chromatography, stability<br>
of materials in acidic and basic media in multiphase extraction, and the like. One skilled<br>
in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.<br>
[00144]	Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual<br>
diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known<br>
to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization.<br>
Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a<br>
diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g.,<br>
chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the<br>
diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the<br>
corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of the present invention<br>
may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention.<br>
Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.<br>
[00145]	A single stereoisomer, e.g., an enantiomer, substantially free of its<br>
stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as<br>
formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S.<br>
"Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds," John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 1994;<br>
Lochmuller, C. H., J. Chromatogr., (1975), 113(3):283-302). Racemic mixtures of chiral<br>
compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method,<br>
including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and<br>
separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric<br>

compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and<br>
conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3) separation of the substantially pure or<br>
enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See: "Drug Stereochemistry,<br>
Analytical Methods and Pharmacology," Irving W. Wainer, Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc.,<br>
New York (1993).<br>
[00146]	Under method (1), diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of<br>
enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, a-<br>
methyl-P-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds<br>
bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric<br>
salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography.<br>
For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or<br>
sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid<br>
can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.<br>
[00147]	Alternatively, by method (2), the substrate to be resolved is reacted with<br>
one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (E. and Wilen, S.<br>
"Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds", John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1994, p. 322).<br>
Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with<br>
enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed<br>
by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer.<br>
A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters, such as a menthyl<br>
ester, e.g., (-)menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base, or Mosher ester, a-methoxy-<br>
a-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob III. J. Org. Chem., (1982) 47:4165), of the<br>
racemic mixture, and analyzing the *H NMR spectrum for the presence of the two<br>
atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric<br>
compounds can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase chromatography<br>
following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines (WO 96/15111).<br>
By method (3), a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by<br>
chromatography using a chiral stationary phase ("Chiral Liquid Chromatography" (1989)<br>
W. J. Lough, Ed., Chapman and Hall, New York; Okamoto, J. of Chromatogr., (1990)<br>
513:375-378). Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to<br>
distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms, such as optical rotation<br>
and circular dichroism.<br>

According to certain embodiments, this invention provides methods of blocking or<br>
inhibiting mitosis by administering an effective amount of a compound of Formula I-IV.<br>
As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, mitosis may be altered in a variety of<br>
ways; that is, one can affect mitosis either by increasing or decreasing the activity of a<br>
component in the mitotic pathway. Stated differently, mitosis may be affected (e.g.,<br>
disrupted) by disturbing equilibrium, either by inhibiting or activating certain components<br>
using the compounds of the present invention, for example, by modulating spindle<br>
function or blocking mitotic kinesin. Similar approaches may be used to alter meiosis.<br>
[00149]	In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention can be used to<br>
modulate mitotic spindle formation, thus causing prolonged cell cycle arrest in mitosis.<br>
By "modulate" herein is meant altering mitotic spindle formation, including increasing and<br>
decreasing spindle formation. By "mitotic spindle formation" herein is meant organization<br>
of microtubules into bipolar structures by mitotic kinesins. By "mitotic spindle<br>
dysfunction" herein is meant mitotic arrest and monopolar spindle formation.<br>
[00150]	In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention can be used to<br>
bind to and/or modulate the activity of a mitotic kinesin. In an embodiment, the mitotic<br>
kinesin is a member of the bimC subfamily of mitotic kinesins as described in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,284,480, which is incorporated herein by reference. In a further embodiment, the<br>
mitotic kinesin is human KSP, although the activity of mitotic kinesins from other<br>
organisms may also be modulated by the compounds of the present invention. In this<br>
context, modulate means either increasing or decreasing spindle pole separation, causing<br>
malformation, i.e., splaying, of mitotic spindle poles, or otherwise causing morphological<br>
perturbation of the mitotic spindle. Also included within the definition of KSP for these<br>
purposes are variants and/or fragments of KSP. In addition, other mitotic kinesins may be<br>
inhibited by the compounds of the present invention.<br>
[00151]	In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention can be used to<br>
treat abnormal or unwanted cell growth conditions, such as, but not limited to, cellular<br>
proliferative diseases, for example, cancer, hyperplasias, restenosis, cardiac hypertrophy,<br>
immune disorders, infectious disease, fungal or other eukaryote infections, inflammatory<br>
diseases, arthritis, graft rejection, inflammatory bowel disease, proliferation induced after<br>
medical procedures, including, but not limited to, surgery, angioplasty, and the like, by<br>
administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I-IV, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, metabolite or solvate thereof.<br>

WO 2006/044825 	PCT/US2005/037305<br>
[00152]	The terms "abnormal cell growth" and "hyperproliferative disorder" are<br>
used interchangeably in this application and, unless otherwise indicated, refer to cell<br>
growth that is independent of normal regulatory mechanisms (e.g., loss of contact<br>
inhibition). Examples of abnormal cell growth conditions include, but are not limited to,<br>
cancer, autoimmune disease, arthritis, graft rejection, inflammatory bowel disease, or<br>
proliferation induced after a medical procedure.<br>
[00153]	The phrase "therapeutically effective amount" means an amount of a<br>
compound of the present invention that (i) treats or prevents the particular disease,<br>
condition, or disorder, (ii) attenuates, ameliorates, or eliminates one or more symptoms of<br>
the particular disease, condition, or disorder, or (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or<br>
more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder described herein. In the<br>
case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of<br>
cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop)<br>
cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and<br>
preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and/or relieve to<br>
some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the<br>
drug may prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and/or<br>
cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can be measured, for example, by assessing the<br>
time to disease progression (TTP) and/or determining the response rate (RR).<br>
[00154]	It is appreciated that in some cases the cells may not be in a hyper- or<br>
hypoproliferation state (abnormal state) but still require treatment. For example, during<br>
wound healing, the cells may be proliferating "normally", but proliferation enhancement<br>
may be desired. Similarly, as discussed above, in the agriculture arena, cells may be in a<br>
"normal" state, but proliferation modulation may be desired to enhance a crop by directly<br>
enhancing growth of a crop, or by inhibiting the growth of a plant or organism which<br>
adversely affects the crop. Thus, in certain embodiments, the invention herein includes<br>
application to cells or individuals that are afflicted or may eventually become afflicted<br>
with any one of these disorders or states.<br>
[00155]	The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment<br>
of a hyperproliferative disorder in a mammal which comprises a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt,<br>
prodrug, metabolite or solvate thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In<br>

[00173]	Further provided is a compound of Formula I-IV for use as a medicament<br>
in the treatment of the diseases or conditions described above in a warm-blooded animal,<br>
such as a mammal, for example, a human, suffering from such disease or condition. Also<br>
provided is the use of a compound of Formula I-IV in the preparation of a medicament for<br>
the treatment of the diseases and conditions described above in a warm-blooded animal,<br>
such as a mammal, for example a human, suffering from such disorder.<br>
[00174]	The term "treating," as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, means<br>
reversing, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, or preventing the disorder or condition to<br>
which such term applies, or one or more symptoms of such disorder or condition. The<br>
term "treatment," as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, refers to the act of treating as<br>

mitigation of a disease condition in a mammal, such as a human, and includes, but is not<br>
limited to, modulating and/or inhibiting the disease condition, and/or alleviating the<br>
disease condition.<br>
[00175]	In treating a subject, it will be understood that the specific dosage level and<br>
frequency of dosage for any particular subject may be varied and will depend upon a<br>
variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound of Formula I-IV, the<br>
species, age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the subject, the mode and time of<br>
administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and severity of the particular<br>
condition, but can nevertheless be routinely determined by one skilled in the art.<br>
[00176]	The compounds of the invention may be administered by any route<br>
appropriate to the condition to be treated. Suitable routes include parenteral<br>
administration (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial,<br>
intradermal, intrathecal and epidural), transdermal, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal<br>
and sublingual), e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Other suitable rounds<br>
include vaginal, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, oral, and intranasal administration.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the invention may be administered topically (e.g., to the<br>
skin) for the treatment of a topical condition such as a fungal skin infection. It will be<br>
appreciated that the preferred route may vary with for example the condition of the<br>
recipient. Where the compound is administered orally, it may be formulated as a pill,<br>

capsule, tablet, etc. with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Where the<br>
compound is administered parenterally, it may be formulated with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable parenteral vehicle and in a unit dosage injectable form, as detailed below.<br>
[00177]	In order to use a compound of Formula I-IV or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt, solvate, metabolite or prodrug thereof for the therapeutic treatment<br>
(including prophylactic treatment) of mammals including humans, it is normally<br>
formulated in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice as a pharmaceutical<br>
composition. According to this aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical<br>
composition that comprises a compound of the Formula I-IV, or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt, solvate, metabolite or prodrug thereof, in association with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
[00178]	To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions according to this invention, a<br>
therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of Formula I-IV or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, metabolite or prodrug thereof (alone or together<br>
with an additional therapeutic agent as disclosed herein) is intimately admixed, for<br>
example, with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier according to conventional<br>
pharmaceutical compounding techniques to produce a dose. A carrier may take a wide<br>
variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral<br>
or parenteral. Examples of suitable carriers include any and all solvents, dispersion media,<br>
adjuvants, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying<br>
agents, sweeteners, stabilizers (to promote long term storage), emulsifiers, binding agents,<br>
thickening agents, salts, preservatives, solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial<br>
and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, flavoring agents, and<br>
miscellaneous materials such as buffers and absorbents that may be needed in order to<br>
prepare a particular therapeutic composition. The use of such media and agents with<br>
pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any<br>
conventional media or agent is incompatible with a compound of Formula I-IV, its use in<br>
the therapeutic compositions and preparations is contemplated. Supplementary active<br>
ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions and preparations as described<br>
herein.<br>
[00179]	The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable<br>
aqueous or oily suspension, which may be formulated according to known procedures<br>
using one or more of the appropriate dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents,<br>

which have been mentioned above. This suspension may be formulated according to the<br>
known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which<br>
have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile<br>
injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent,<br>
such as a solution in 1,3-butanediol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the<br>
acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and<br>
isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be<br>
employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be<br>
employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic<br>
acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables. Injectable solutions or<br>
microemulsions may be introduced into a patient's blood stream by local bolus injection.<br>
Alternatively, it may be advantageous to administer the solution or microemulsion in such<br>
a way as to maintain a constant circulating concentration of the instant compound. In<br>
order to maintain such a constant concentration, a continuous intravenous delivery device<br>
may be utilized. An example of such a device is the DeltecCADD-PLUS™ model 5400<br>
intravenous pump.<br>
[00180]	The compositions of the invention may also be in a form suitable for oral<br>
use (for example as tablets, lozenges, hard or soft capsules, aqueous or oily suspensions,<br>
emulsions, dispersible powders or granules, syrups or elixirs), for topical use (for example<br>
as creams, ointments, gels, or aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions), for administration<br>
by inhalation (for example as a finely divided powder or a liquid aerosol), for<br>
administration by insufflation (for example as a finely divided powder) or for parenteral<br>
administration (for example as a sterile aqueous or oily solution for intravenous,<br>
subcutaneous, or intramuscular dosing or as a suppository for rectal dosing). For example,<br>
compositions intended for oral use may contain, for example, one or more coloring,<br>
sweetening, flavoring and/or preservative agents.<br>
[00181]	Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients for a tablet formulation<br>
include, for example, inert diluents such as lactose, sodium carbonate, calcium phosphate<br>
or calcium carbonate, granulating and disintegrating agents such as corn starch or algenic<br>
acid; binding agents such as starch; lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic<br>
acid or talc; preservative agents such as ethyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, and anti-<br>
oxidants, such as ascorbic acid. Tablet formulations may be uncoated or coated either to<br>
modify their disintegration and the subsequent absorption of the active ingredient within<br>

using conventional coating agents and procedures well known in the art.<br>
[00182]	Compositions for oral use may be in the form of hard gelatin capsules in<br>
which the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium<br>
carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules in which the active<br>
ingredient is mixed with water or an oil such as peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
[00183]	Aqueous suspensions generally contain the active ingredient in finely<br>
powdered form together with one or more suspending agents, such as sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate,<br>
polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents such<br>
as lecithin or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids (for example<br>
polyoxethylene stearate), or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain<br>
aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of<br>
ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with<br>
partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene<br>
sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives<br>
(such as ethyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, anti-oxidants (such as ascorbic acid), coloring<br>
agents, flavoring agents, and/or sweetening agents (such as sucrose, saccharine or<br>
aspartame).<br>
[00184]	Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in<br>
a vegetable oil (such as arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil) or in a mineral oil<br>
(such as liquid paraffin). The oily suspensions may also contain a thickening agent such<br>
as beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set out above,<br>
and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These<br>
compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
[00185]	Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous<br>
suspension by the addition of water generally contain the active ingredient together with a<br>
dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable<br>
dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already<br>
mentioned above. Additional excipients such as sweetening, flavoring and coloring<br>
agents, may also be present.<br>

of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, such as olive oil or<br>
arachis oil, or a mineral oil, such as for example liquid paraffin or a mixture of any of<br>
these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be, for example, naturally-occurring gums such as<br>
gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides such as soya bean,<br>
lecithin, esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides (for<br>
example sorbitan monooleate) and condensation products of the said partial esters with<br>
ethylene oxide such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also<br>
contain sweetening, flavoring and preservative agents.<br>
[00187]	Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents such as<br>
glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol, aspartame or sucrose, and may also contain a<br>
demulcent, preservative, flavoring and/or coloring agent.<br>
[00188]	Suppository formulations may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient<br>
with a suitable non-irritating excipient that is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at<br>
the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Suitable<br>
excipients include, for example, cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br>
[00189]	Topical formulations, such as creams, ointments, gels and aqueous or oily<br>
solutions or suspensions, may generally be obtained by formulating an active ingredient<br>
with a conventional, topically acceptable, vehicle or diluent using conventional procedures<br>
well known in the art.<br>
[00190]	Compositions for administration by insufflation may be in the form of a<br>
finely divided powder containing particles of average diameter of, for example, 30 urn or<br>
much less, the powder itself comprising either active ingredient alone or diluted with one<br>
or more physiologically acceptable carriers such as lactose. The powder for insufflation is<br>
then conveniently retained in a capsule containing, for example, 1 to 50 mg of active<br>
ingredient for use with a turbo-inhaler device, such as is used for insufflation of the known<br>
agent sodium cromoglycate.<br>
[00191]	Compositions for administration by inhalation may be in the form of a<br>
conventional pressurized aerosol arranged to dispense the active ingredient either as an<br>
aerosol containing finely divided solid or liquid droplets. Conventional aerosol<br>
propellants such as volatile fluorinated hydrocarbons or hydrocarbons may be used and the<br>
aerosol device is conveniently arranged to dispense a metered quantity of active<br>
ingredient.<br>

are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.<br>
Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-<br>
dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.<br>
[00195]	The amount of a compound of this invention that is combined with one or<br>
more excipients to produce a single dosage form will necessarily vary depending upon the<br>
subject treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the<br>
disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. In certain<br>
embodiments, a suitable amount of a compound of Formula I-IV is administered to a<br>
mammal undergoing treatment for cancer. Administration in certain embodiments occurs<br>
in an amount between about 0.001 mg/kg of body weight to about 60 mg/kg of body<br>
weight per day. In another embodiment, administration occurs in an amount between 0.5<br>
mg/kg of body weight to about 40 mg/kg of body weight per day. In some instances,<br>
dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate,<br>
while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side<br>
effect, provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for<br>
administration throughout the day. For further information on routes of administration and<br>
dosage regimes, see Chapter 25.3 in Volume 5 of Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry<br>
(Corwin Hansch; Chairman of Editorial Board), Pergamon Press 1990, which is<br>
specifically incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[00196]	The size of the dose for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes of a<br>
compound of Formula I-IV will naturally vary according to the nature and severity of the<br>
conditions, the age and sex of the animal or patient and the route of administration,<br>
according to well known principles of medicine.<br>
[00197]	In another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture, or "kit",<br>
containing materials useful for the treatment of the disorders described above is provided.<br>

In certain embodiments, the kit comprises a container comprising a compound of Formula<br>
I-IV. In certain embodiments, the invention provides a kit for treating a hyperproliferative<br>
disorder. In another embodiment, the invention provides a kit for treating or preventing a<br>
fungal or other eukaryote infection. The kit may further comprise a label or package insert<br>
on or associated with the container. In certain embodiments, the label or package inserts<br>
indicates that the composition comprising a compound of Formula I-IV can be used, for<br>
example, to treat a hyperproliferative disorder or to treat a fungal or other eukaryote<br>
infection. The label or package insert may also indicate that the composition can be used<br>
to treat other disorders.<br>
[00198]	In certain embodiments, the kit further comprises a container. Suitable<br>
containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, blister pack, etc. The container<br>
may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds a<br>
compound of Formula I-IV or a pharmaceutical formulation thereof in an amount<br>
effective for treating the condition, and may have a sterile access port (for example, the<br>
container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a<br>
hypodermic injection needle).<br>
[00199]	Alternatively, or additionally, the kit may further comprise a second<br>
container comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for<br>
injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It<br>
may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint,<br>
including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.<br>
[00200]	The kit may further comprise directions for the administration of the<br>
compound of Formula I-IV and, if present, the second pharmaceutical formulation. For<br>
example, if the kit comprises a first composition comprising a compound of Formula I-IV<br>
and a second pharmaceutical formulation, the kit may further comprise directions for the<br>
simultaneous, sequential or separate administration of the first and second pharmaceutical<br>
compositions to a patient in need thereof.<br>
[00201]	According to certain embodiments, the kit may comprise (a) a first<br>
container with a compound of Formula I-IV contained therein; and optionally (b) a second<br>
container with a second pharmaceutical formulation contained therein, wherein the second<br>
pharmaceutical formulation comprises a second compound having, for example, anti-<br>
hyperproliferative or antifungal activity. Alternatively, or additionally, the kit may further<br>
comprise a third container comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer, such as<br>

bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and<br>
dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and<br>
user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.<br>
[00202]	In certain other embodiments wherein the kit comprises a pharmaceutical<br>
formulation of a compound of Formula I-IV and a second formulation comprising a<br>
second therapeutic agent, the kit may comprise a container for containing the separate<br>
formulations, such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet; however, the separate<br>
compositions may also be contained within a single, undivided container. Typically, the<br>
kit comprises directions for the administration of the separate components. The kit form is<br>
particularly advantageous when the separate components are administered in different<br>
dosage forms (e.g., oral and parenteral), are administered at different dosage intervals, or<br>
when titration of the individual components of the combination is desired by the<br>
prescribing physician.<br>
[00203]	In another embodiment, the kits are suitable for the delivery of solid oral<br>
forms of a compound of Formula I-IV, such as tablets or capsules. Such a kit includes, for<br>
example, a number of unit dosages. Such kits can include a card having the dosages<br>
oriented in the order of their intended use. An example of such a kit is a "blister pack".<br>
Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are widely used for packaging<br>
pharmaceutical unit dosage forms. If desired, a memory aid can be provided, for example<br>
in the form of numbers, letters, or other markings or with a calendar insert, designating the<br>
days in the treatment schedule in which the dosages can be administered.<br>
[00204]	Although the compounds of Formula I-IV are primarily of value as<br>
therapeutic agents for use in warm-blooded animals (including man), they are also useful<br>
whenever it is required to inhibit the effects of KSP kinesin. Thus, they are also useful as<br>
pharmacological standards in the development of new biological tests and in the search for<br>
new pharmacological agents.<br>
[00205]	Representative compounds of the present invention, which are<br>
encompassed by the present invention include, but are not limited to the compounds of the<br>
examples and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, metabolites or prodrugs<br>
thereof. The examples presented below are intended to illustrate particular embodiments<br>
of the invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of the specification or the claims<br>

Example 123<br>
[00382]	The activity of the compounds of the present invention may be determined<br>
by the following procedure. The assays were conducted at 30 °C in a Costar 3695 (96-<br>
well, polystyrene, /4-area, clear) plate in a final volume of 50 uL. Hydrolysis of ATP was<br>
monitored in a system that coupled the product ADP to the oxidation of NADH using<br>
pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. Assay mixtures contained the following: 20<br>
mM K+Pipes, pH 7.0, 0.01% Triton X-100, 2% DMSO, 25 mM KC1, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM<br>
DTT, 25 uM ATP, 1 mM phospho(enol)pyruvate, 200 uM NADH, 7.9 U/mL pyruvate<br>
kinase, 9 U/mL lactate dehydrogenase, 0.25 uM bovine microtubules, 20 uM paclitaxel<br>

and 20 nM Eg5. The concentration of inhibitor was typically varied over the range of 10-<br>
200,000 nM. The reaction was monitored kinetically in an absorbance-based plate reader<br>
for a period of 10 minutes. Velocities were estimated from linear fits to the progress<br>
curves and were expressed as POC (percent of uninhibited control wells). ICso's were<br>
estimated from the POC data using a standard 4-parameter logistical model and compared<br>
to a control inhibitor run in each plate. In this assay, compounds of the invention<br>
exhibited an IC50 of less than 50 uM.<br>
Example 124<br>
[00383]	The ability of the compounds of the present invention to inhibit cellular<br>
viability may be determined by the following procedure. Cells from a variety of<br>
established tumor cell lines, e.g., HeLa, were plated in Costar 3904 96-well plates, in<br>
growth medium for the cell line (for HeLa:DMEM high glucose, L-glutamine, 20 mM<br>
Hepes, 10% FBS), at a density that allowed for logarithmic growth over the 72 hour period<br>
of the assay (HeLa: 1000 cells/well), and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 overnight. The<br>
following day, one-tenth volume of a 10X concentration of compounds was added to the<br>
wells in an 11-point dilution series. The dilution series was composed of an initial 1:2<br>
dilution in DMSO, followed by a 1:20 dilution in growth medium, for a final DMSO<br>
concentration on cells of 0.5%. Control wells were treated with 0.5% DMSO. The typical<br>
range of dilution was 2.5 uM to 1 nM, which was expanded to 50 uM to 50 pM depending<br>
on the potency of the compound. Once compound was added to the cells, plates were<br>
incubated as above. After 72 hour incubation, 20 uL resazurin solution (Cell Titer Blue,<br>
Promega G8081) was added to all wells and the plates incubated for an additional 2 hours.<br>
Viable cells convert resazurin to resorufin, a fluorescent end product. The plate was read<br>
on a fluorescent plate reader at 560 nm excitation/590 nm emission. The fluorescent<br>
signal of the control wells was defined as 100% and the percent of control signal for each<br>
well of a dilution series for the compound was defined as: (fluorescent signal of treated<br>
well) X (average fluorescent signal of the control well)'1 X 100. The EC50 for inhibition of<br>
viability was determined from the inflection point of a standard 4-parameter logistical<br>
curve fitted to the values obtained. In this assay, the compounds of the invention exhibited<br>
an EC50 of less than 50 uM.<br>
