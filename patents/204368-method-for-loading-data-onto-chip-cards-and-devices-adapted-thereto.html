COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"METHOD FOR LOADING DATA ONTO CHIP CARDS AND DEVICES<br>
ADAPTED THERETO"<br><br>
SWISSCOM   MOBILE   AG A SWISS COMPANY of   Schwarztorstrasse   61,   CH-3050   Bern,<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to a method for loading data on chip cards and to devices adapted therefor.<br>
Present-day chip cards (smart cards) make possible the secure storage and processing of data. Through their structure having a monochip embedded in a substrate, they may be considered secure. Chip cards are utilized in various branches of industry for various functions, e.g. as SIM cards for identifying network subscribers, for instance SIM cards in a GSM network for identifying GSM subscribers, as cards having a debit function, e.g. for making telephone calls or getting gasoline, as cards having the function of electronic wallets which can be reloaded with sums of money, or as credential-cards for entrance or admission checks. Although all these solutions are proprietary, and no manufacturer-overlapping implementations are available, the technology and standardization work has currently progressed to the point where it is possible to expand the chip card in such a way that it may be considered an open, manufacturer-neutral platform. It is also conceivable to load one or more dedicated applications on the card, simultaneously or at different times, which can especially also intercommunicate. In addition, it is also possible to produce simultaneously chip cards having standardized interfaces with contacts and having contactless interfaces. Although such flexibility of interfaces and loadable applications is foreseeable, there is still a lack of flexibility as regards the loading of respective program applications and data, particularly data corresponding to sums of money.<br>
It is an object of this invention to propose a new and improved method of loading data on chip cards and devices adapted therefor, making it possible for chip cards to be flexibly loaded with program applications and data, particularly data corresponding to sums of money.<br>
According to the present invention, these goals are achieved particularly by means of the elements of the characterizing clauses of the independent claims. Further advantageous embodiments follow moreover from the dependent claims and the specification.<br><br>
In particular, these goals are achieved by the invention in that data from a service center are transmitted over a mobile network to a SIM card, which is inserted in a mobile device and connected thereto via an interface with contacts, and are stored there, and that these stored data are transmitted contactlessly from the SIM card to a chip card with contacts. For example, the mobile device is a mobile radio telephone, and the mobile network is a GSM or UMTS network. Preferably, such transmissions take place secured and authenticated.<br>
In a variant, the contactless transmission to the chip card takes place by means of an inductive interface integrated in the mobile device, in which connection it may be advantageous if the chip card, too, can transmit data to this mobile device contactlessly.<br>
In another variant, the contactless transmission to the chip card takes place by means of an inductive interface integrated in the SIM card, in which connection it may be advantageous if the chip card, too, can transmit data to the SIM card contactlessly.<br>
In different variants, transmission of the data from the service center to the SIM card can be initiated by a user by means of input means of the mobile device or by the service center.<br>
It is advantageous if the contactless transmission of data to the chip card can be initiated by a user by means of input means of the mobile device.<br>
In a variant, the chip card is a value card, and the data correspond to a sum of money.<br>
According to the present invention, the chip card, which has at least one contactless interface, e.g. an inductive interface, as well as an interface with contacts, comprises programmed means for receiving and storing data via the<br><br>
contactless interface of a SIM card which is inserted in a mobile device and is connected thereto via an interface with contacts.<br>
The chip card preferably comprises programmed means for transmitting data via the contactless interface and/or interface with contacts to a peripheral in order to make possible secured and authenticated data transmission by means of the aforementioned SIM card and, in case some of these data are program applications, in order to install these program applications.<br>
Advantageously, the chip card also comprises additional means for transmitting data via the contactless interface to the SIM card and for receiving and storing data from a peripheral via the contactless interface and/or interface with contacts.<br>
Transmission preferably takes place when the chip card is powered by the mobile device, e.g. by means of induction.<br>
According to the present invention, the SIM card, which is inserted in a mobile device and can be connected thereto via an interface with contacts, comprises programmed means for transmitting data via a contactless interface to a chip card, this contactless interface being integrated, e.g. as an inductive interface, in the mobile device or on the SIM card in different variants.<br>
Preferably, the SIM card comprises programmed means for receiving and storing data over a mobile network via the mentioned interface with contacts from a mobile device, e.g. a mobile radio telephone.<br>
The SIM card advantageously also comprises additional programmed means for receiving data from the chip card via the contactless interface.<br>
In a variant, the SIM card comprises additional programmed means for also carrying out the above-mentioned functions of the chip card, whereby it can be utilized as a universal SIM and chip card.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method of loading data on a chip card with contacts, in which method said data are transmitted from a service center over a mobile network to a SIM card which is inserted in a mobile device and is connected thereto via an interface with contacts, and in which method the received said data are stored on said SIM card, characterized in that it further comprises the following step:<br>
contactless transmission of the stored said data from said SIM card to said chip card, via a contactless interface, without using said mobile network.<br>
The invention also relates to a device configuration for loading data on a chip card with contacts comprising said chip card, a service center, a mobile device, a SIM card, which is inserted into the mobile device and is connected thereto via an interface with contacts, and a mobile network, via which mobile network said data can be transmitted from the service center to the SIM card, the SIM card comprising means for storing said data, characterized in that the SIM card comprises additional programmed means for transmitting said data to said chip card, via a contactless interface, without using said mobile network, and in that said chip card further comprises at least one contactless interface and programmed means to receive and store data via said, contactless interface, from the SIM card.<br><br>
An embodiment of the present invention is described below with the aid of an example. The example of the embodiment is illustrated by means of the sole accompanying drawing:<br>
The single drawing figure is a block diagram showing a mobile network and service center connected thereto and a connected mobile device in which a SIM card is inserted, as well as a chip card and a peripheral.<br>
A SIM card 1 is inserted in a mobile device 3, e.g. a mobile radio telephone, and connected thereto via an interface with contacts. The SIM card 1 has programmed means for receiving data from a service center 6 over a mobile network 4, e.g. a GSM or UMTS network, and for storing these data in the memory on the SIM card 1. This program may, for example, be designed in such a way that the data are transmitted by means of special short messages, e.g. in SMS short messages or in USSD data, e.g. according to the SICAP method described in European_Patent No689l368l among other things, or according to a similar method. In a variant, this transmission may be initiated by a user via the input means (not shown) of the mobile device 3 in that the programmed means of the mobile device 3 accept respective commands and information via such input means. In another variant, this transmission of data is initiated by the service center 6, e.g. after the user has filed a respective order in writing or by telephone with the operator of the service center 6, e.g. a bank or a software service center, or after he has made a respective remittance. Transmission of the data between the service center 6 and the mobile device 3, i.e. the SIM card 1, takes place with the aid of security services, e.g. by means of a TTP (Trusted Third Party) or other suitable method in order to guarantee the confidentiality, authenticity, indisputableness of origin, and integrity of the data, and above all also the authenticity of the respective sender, i.e. of the user and/or the service center 6.<br>
The data transmitted and stored on the SIM card 1 may, in a further step, be transmitted via a contactless interface 5 to a chip card 2 through the programmed means on the SIM card 1. In different variants, the contactless interface may be integrated on the SIM card 1 or in the mobile device 3, e.g. as an inductive interface. Correspondingly, the chip card 2 likewise has a<br><br>
contactless interface and the respective programmed means for receiving and storing the data from the SIM card 1 via this contactless interface. Chip cards having contactless interfaces are described, for example, in International Patent Application Publications Nos.WO 91/16718 and WO 95/33246, or in the as yet unpublished International Patent Application PCT/CH97/00237. In a similar manner as described above, such transmission may likewise be initiated by the user via the input means of the mobile device 3. Also in a similar manner as described above, transmission of the data between the SIM card 1 and the chip card 2 additionally takes place with the aid of security services.<br>
Depending upon the kind of data, it may furthermore be advantageous for only some of the data or data values dependent upon these data to be transmitted. For instance, the data transmission may correspond to sums of money now stored on the SIM card 1 which may be transmitted to the chip card 2 as one whole sum or in partial sums selected by the user via the input means of the mobile device 3. The chip card 2 may then be used, as will be described below, as a means of payment, for example, or as a supplier of other data, or newly loaded program applications can be run. In the event of the last example, the chip card 2 further has suitable programmed means for installing and administering such program applications. It is also quite possible, however, that sums of money and/or other data may be transferred directly to a peripheral 8 by means of the contactless interface 9 integrated on the mobile device 3 or in the SIM card 1 and the respectively expanded programmed means on the SIM card 1, e.g. for paying at a suitably equipped cashier's desk in a shop.<br>
The chip card 2 may, for instance, be a value card, e.g. a credit card, a debit card, or an electronic wallet card, which can remit secure payments via an interface with contacts to a peripheral (not shown), e.g. a vending machine, a petrol pump, or a pay telephone. The data transmission from the chip card 2 to a peripheral, e.g. the previously described monetary transaction, can naturally also be carried out from the chip card 2 via its contactless interface 7, e.g. an inductive interface, to a peripheral 8 having a suitable contactless interface. In this latter case, it is advantageous if the transmission takes place when the chip card 2 is powered, e.g. by means of induction, by the peripheral<br><br>
8. For carrying out these functions and services and, for example, also for receiving data from peripherals via contact or contactless interfaces and storing them on the chip card 2, the chip card 2 comprises the respective programmed means which also make it possible for data transmissions similar to those described above to be carried out with the aid of security services.<br>
The chip card 2 advantageously further has suitable means for transmitting data via the contactless interface to the mobile device 3, i.e. to the SIM card 1. Transmission preferably takes place when the chip card is powered, e.g. by means of induction, by the mobile device 3. This might also be used, among other things, e.g. for displaying information relating to the chip card 2 on the display (not shown) of the mobile device 3. In case the chip card 2 is a value card, the balance on the chip card 2 and/or the name of the bank or credit-card company responsible for the value card may be displayed, for instance. Likewise, other data, e.g. sums of money, may also be transmitted from the peripheral 8 to the chip card 2 and from the latter to the SIM card 1.<br>
It should be mentioned here as well that it is also quite possible to combine the functions described, i.e. the programmed means described, of the SIM card 1 and the chip card 2 in such a way as to obtain a universal card capable of carrying out all described functions and services. Preferably, the size of the chip card 2, and also of the universal card described, is that of a credit card, which also corresponds to the full-size format of a SIM card. Smaller chip cards having the plug-in format of a SIM card (about 25x10 mm) are difficult to remove from a mobile device 3, so that chip cards of that size would not be practical to handle, above all upon insertion in peripherals for transactions or other data transmissions. The chip card 2 or the aforementioned universal card may, as stated above, be a value card which, as such, may be sold to customers by suitable service providers or supplied for a limited duration for a periodic or one-time fee.<br>
It must be emphasized here once more, however, that the fields of application of the present invention are almost limitless and are not just suitable for and confined to the examples of monetary transactions mentioned here, but that data of any kind may be loaded on a chip card 2 from a service center 6<br><br>
over a mobile device 3 operated by a user. Further examples of applications comprise the most varied user programs which may be loaded on the chip card 2 and run, or security profiles and admission authorizations for services and/or buildings, and much more. It should also be mentioned here in particular that the application programs transmitted as data may also be Java applets and that the chip card used in this connection may be a Java-compatible card.<br><br>
