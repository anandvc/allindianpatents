BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
	The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method to provide<br>
an added service for a portable terminal. More particularly, the present invention relates to<br>
an apparatus and method for a portable terminal wherein user data may be displayed in an<br>
enlarged or reduced S1ze.<br>
Description of the Related Art:<br>
	Advances  in wireless  communication  technologies  have     increased  the<br>
popularity of portable terminals. Communication network operators provide various services<br>
in order to satisfy diverS1fied needs of subscribers.<br>
	For example, a portable terminal performs a baS1c call procesS1ng function that<br>
facilitates a subscriber's ability to place/receive a phone call to/from another fixed or mobile<br>
subscriber while in motion in a service area of a base station. Such a portable terminal can<br>
also perform added functions enabling personal information management and data exchange<br>
through connection to a computer or to an Internet network. In particular, an advanced<br>
portable terminal can perform transmisS1on and reception of pictures or moving images,<br>
support virtual three-dimenS1onal sounds or stereo sounds, play Moving Picture Experts<br>
Group's MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3) files, and include a camera for photographing.<br>
	Various content services such as a data service are also provided to portable<br>
terminals. S1zes of characters or images displayed on the screen tend to decrease as a result<br>
of posS1ble picture S1ze limitations of portable terminals. This lowers a. user's<br>
comprehenS1bility.<br>
	To increase comprehenS1bility of the screen, use of a magnifying glass that can<br>
be externally installed at a portable terminal has been proposed to enlarge the screen content<br>
if necessary. A method for on-screen character enlargement has also been proposed, wherein<br><br>
a font of deS1red characters is selected uS1ng a key for character enlargement and the selected<br>
font is read from a font memory to enlarge characters displayed on the screen.<br>
	However, in a conventional method of utilizing an external appliance such as a<br>
magnifying glass to enlarge screen data, addition of a separate mechanical means may<br>
S1gnificantly increase the volume of a portable terminal and cause a deS1gn change thereof. In<br>
another conventional method of utilizing a font memory to store multiple fonts, a large<br>
memory capacity is required for a portable terminal and the user is inconvenienced by having<br>
to specify S1zes of characters.<br>

	An exemplary embodiment of the present invention relates to an apparatus and<br>
method capable of delivering added functions and services to a portable terminal for user<br>
convenience. In exemplary embodiments of the present invention, an apparatus and method<br>
for a portable terminal are provided in which user data can be displayed in an enlarged or<br>
reduced S1ze according to user requests.<br>
	According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, in a short<br>
message service (SMS) that is an added function of a portable terminal, displayed characters<br>
are enlarged or reduced through function keys of the portable terminal. While the user inputs<br>
characters or reads a received message in an SMS service, if a particular event is generated<br>
through an associated function key, the portable terminal increases or decreases S1zes of<br>
characters displayed on the screen. This example is applicable for all kinds of user data<br>
usable through a portable terminal, including characters, images, moving pictures and menus.<br>
	Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to an apparatus and<br>
method to enlarge or reduce screen content of a portable terminal according to user requests.<br>

comprehenS1bility of displayed characters or images.<br>
	In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, user data includes<br>
character data such as menus and text, and multimedia data such as images and moving<br>
pictures, in the delivery of, for example, SMS services and multimedia message services<br>
(MMS).<br>
	According to another exemplary embodiment, for transmisS1on or reception of<br>
characters uS1ng a portable terminal in an SMS or MMS service, S1zes of displayed characters<br>
are eaS1ly adjusted through function keys of the portable terminal, for example volume keys,<br>
to facilitates the user's ability to readily comprehend the text. That is, S1zes of displayed<br>
characters are increased corresponding to occurrences of events associated with, for example,<br><br>
the up volume key, and are decreased corresponding to occurrences of events associated with,<br>
for example, the down volume key.<br>
	The screen is moved up/down/left/right uS1ng function keys, such as direction<br>
keys, to make the overall enlarged user data viS1ble so that the user data can be readily<br>
understood by the user. This enhances a user's convenience.<br>
	According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when<br>
displayed characters in an SMS or MMS service are enlarged or reduced, characters are<br>
automatically rearranged corresponding to changes in character S1ze, thereby enhancing user<br>
convenience.<br>
	For example, in the case in which text does not fit within the screen due to<br>
character enlargement, those characters no longer viS1ble within a line are identified and<br>
characters are rearranged in lines through, for example, an auto line feed feature. That is,<br>
those characters no longer viS1ble within a line of the screen are automatically moved to the<br>
next line, and the text is made eaS1ly viS1ble. The entire text is made viS1ble through<br>
movement to the next page uS1ng keys, for example up and down keys, or through a scrolling<br>
feature.<br>
	As described above, in the display data enlargement/reduction method of an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a separate external appliance is not required;<br>
fonts of multiple character S1zes do not have to be stored, leading to highly effective memory<br>
utilization; and character S1zes can be adaptively controlled. Hereinafter, exemplary<br>

memory unit 111.<br>
	The output means outputs user data input through the input means, user data<br>
and related data stored in the storage means, and screen data associated with added functions.<br>
The output means includes a display unit 119 and an audio processor 107.<br>
	The communication means performs wireless transmisS1on of user data to<br>
another user, and connects to an external Web server to transmit/receive contents.   The<br>
communication means includes a radio frequency (RF) processor 103 and an antenna.<br>
	To be more specific about each component, the RF processor 103 performs<br>
communication  operations  related  to  phone  calls,   SMS   or MMS  services   and  data<br>
communications.   The RF processor 103 includes an RF transmitter for upconverting the<br>
frequency of a S1gnal to be transmitted and amplifying the S1gnal, and an RF receiver for low-<br>
noise amplifying a received S1gnal and downconverting the frequency of the S1gnal.<br>
	The data processor 105 processes voice data from the audio processor 107 and<br>
numeric/character data input by the user through the key input unit 109. The data processor<br>
105 may include a means for encoding and modulating a S1gnal to be transmitted through the<br>
RF processor 103, and a means for demodulating and decoding a S1gnal received through the<br>
RF processor 103.<br><br>
	The audio processor 107 reproduces an audio S1gnal from the data processor<br>
105, and transmits an audio S1gnal such as a voice S1gnal input from a microphone to the data<br>
processor 105.<br>
	The key input unit 109 includes numeric, character and function keys for<br>
inputting numeric and character information and for setting various functions.  In particular,<br>
the function keys include volume keys, direction keys and associated mapped keys for data<br>
enlargement/reduction and screen movement through the display unit 119.<br>
	The memory unit 111 may include a program memory and a data memory.<br>
The program memory stores control programs for controlling the overall operation of the<br>
portable terminal, and application programs for data enlargement/reduction and screen<br>
movement.<br>
	The data memory stores data resulting from execution of the control and<br>
application programs, information to set functions related with enlargement/reduction of<br>
displayed user data, and a database for managing various data in the form of records.<br>
	The programs for enlarging, reducing and moving displayed user data can be<br>
loaded as special-purpose applications, and include program modules for detecting and<br>
identifying key events related with enlargement/reduction commands for user data displayed<br>
through the display unit 119 and associated move commands, program modules for<br>
controlling enlargement/reduction of the user data in response to the key events, program<br>
modules for controlling movement of the user data in response to key events occurring after<br>
data enlargement/reduction, and program modules for notification of results generated from<br>
user event procesS1ng operations.<br>
	The controller 101 controls the overall operation and internal components of<br>
the portable terminal. In response to input of a mode change S1gnal related to data<br>
enlargement/reduction through the key input unit 109, the controller 101 controls a<br>
corresponding mode setting operation. In response to input of S1gnals associated with data<br>
enlargement/reduction and subsequent screen movement through the key input unit 109, the<br>
controller 101 controls corresponding operations. For example, when events associated with<br>
data enlargement/reduction occur through the key input unit 109, the controller 101 controls<br>
corresponding operations to enlarge/reduce user data displayed through the display unit 119<br>
in response to the events. When events occur after screen image enlargement/reduction, the<br>
controller 101 controls movement of the enlarged/reduced user data. In response to input of a<br><br>
mode setting S1gnal, the controller 101 also controls corresponding added functions and<br>
output of managed user data or created guide messages.<br>
	Upon reception of information from the user, the controller 101 determines<br>
whether a corresponding service mode is activated or deactivated, identifies an input event<br>
under   the   condition   of   the   determined   service   mode   state,   and   controls   data<br>
enlargement/reduction and screen movement according to the identified input event.<br>
	Specifically, in an activated state of an enlargement/reduction mode, the<br>
controller 101 identifies an input key event. If the identified key event indicates data<br>
enlargement, the controller 101 controls enlargement of displayed user data by a specified<br>
ratio. If the identified key event indicates data reduction, ,the controller 101 controls<br>
reduction of displayed user data by a specified ratio. If the identified key event indicates<br>
screen movement, the controller 101 controls movement of the screen in a specified direction.<br>
	In a deactivated state of the enlargement/reduction mode, the controller 101<br>
identifies an input key event, and controls operations necessary to handle the key event. For<br>
example, if the input key event indicates volume up/down, the controller 101 controls a<br>
corresponding volume up/down operation.<br>
          Although,   in   the   description   above,   the   controller   101   controls   data<br>
enlargement/reduction in response to key events, the controller  101  may also control<br>
automatic data enlargement/reduction according to preset mode settings.<br>
	For example, the user can set in advance an enlargement/reduction ratio and<br>
time interval for user data, such as incoming SMS data. When SMS data is received and<br>
displayed, the SMS data can be automatically enlarged or reduced at the preset<br>
enlargement/reduction ratio from the beginning of the preset time interval, and be<br>
automatically restored to the initial S1ze at the end of the time interval.<br>
	Various enlargement/reduction mode settings can be specified according to<br>
user selections. In particular, various S1zed screen data can be provided for the convenience<br>
of users who may be elderly or who may have poor S1ght.<br>
	The user data may be any type of data handled by the portable terminal, such<br>
as a phone number of a called party input through the key input unit 109,<br>
transmisS1on/reception data of an SMS, MMS or electronic mail service, data related to a data<br>
communication connection, a photograph taken by the camera module 113, menu or user<br>
interface data, and multimedia data including an icon, image and moving picture.<br><br>
The eamera module 113 photographs a target object and outputs image or<br>
video data. The S1gnal processor 115 converts image or video data from the camera module<br>
113 into a digital S1gnal for further procesS1ng.<br>
	The video processor 117 generates screen data to display a digital S1gnal from<br>
the S1gnal processor 115 and to display user data changed by enlargement/reduction<br>
operations of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Under the control of the<br>
controller 101, the video processor 117 outputs screen data associated with a received digital<br>
image S1gnal or with enlargement/reduction/movement of user data depending upon service<br>
mode settings to the display unit 119 in a format conS1stent with specifications of the display<br>
unit 119. The video processor 117 also compresses and decompresses video data.<br>
	The display unit 119 displays video data from the video processor 117 on a<br>
screen. The display unit 119 also adaptively displays the user data enlarged/reduced/moved<br>
according to the control of the controller 101. The display unit 119 further displays windows<br>
for running or setting application modules performing data enlargement/reduction, and mode<br>
setting guide messages provided from the controller 101.<br>
	The   portable  terminal   further  comprises   an   event   determiner   121   for<br>
identifying key events input through the key input unit 109, and a user data determiner 123<br>
for examining user data displayed through the display unit 119.<br>
	The event determiner 121 determines whether the enlargement/reduction mode<br>
is set. If the enlargement/reduction mode is set, the event determiner 121 identifies an event<br>
S1gnal input through the key input unit 109, and transmits identified information on the event<br>
S1gnal to the controller 101.<br>
	The user data determiner 123 identifies types of currently displayed user data,<br>
and transmits the identified types to the controller 101 so that the controller 101 can control<br>
data enlargement/reduction and associated screen display based on the data type information.<br>
For example, if currently displayed user data is character data such as SMS data, the user data<br>
determiner 123 transmits character type information to the controller 101, which facilitates<br>
control of data enlargement/reduction and associated screen display in a manner conS1stent<br>
with character type data.<br>
	In particular, if currently displayed user data is character data containing an<br>
emoticon, such as SMS data, the user data determiner 123 transmits emoticon type<br>
information to the controller 101 to facilitate the control of data enlargement/reduction and<br><br>
associated screen display according to emoticon type data.   As a result, it is posS1ble to<br>
prevent deformation of the emoticon due to enlargement/reduction.<br>
	For enlargement/reduction of specialized user data, the type of the user data is<br>
identified in advance through, for example, the user data determiner 123, and screen display<br>
during enlargement/reduction is adaptively controlled according to the identified data type.<br>
For example, a window can be displayed to request the user to select screen display schemes<br>
to be used during enlargement/reduction of specialized user data.<br>
	Alternatively, the user data determiner 123 can be set to automatically identify<br>
the type of user data such as a character or emoticon.  For example, if an emoticon is input,<br>
the user data determiner 123 identifies the emoticon and transmits the emoticon type to the<br>
controller 101.  The controller 101 then controls screen display of the emoticon according to<br>
a preset display scheme so that the emoticon is not deformed during enlargement/reduction.<br>
	If the display unit 119 of the portable terminal includes a touch screen,<br>
displayed user data can be enlarged/reduced through the display unit 119. The user generates<br>
events for enlargement/reduction of user data displayed on the display unit 119 through<br>
presS1ng function keys, and touches or drags a deS1red area of the display unit 119 to<br>
enlarge/reduce the corresponding user data.<br>
	FIG. 2 illustrates a series of character S1ze adjustment operations in the<br>
portable terminal of FIG. 1. Display screen representations of FIG. 2 illustrate character<br>
enlargement operations involving screen movement in viewing, such as a text message to be<br>
transmitted or received through an SMS service.<br>
	In FIG. 2, during display of an initial screen 210, when a key event for<br>
enlargement is input from the user, the portable terminal enlarges characters on the screen<br>
210 by a ratio, and displays one of screens 220, 240 and 260 with enlarged characters<br>
depending upon preset display mode settings.<br>
	In an enlargement mode of the screen 220, characters of a line outS1de the<br>
screen width due to enlargement are sequentially moved to the next line. The user can view<br>
those characters out of the display area through scrolling operations by presS1ng function keys<br>
of the portable terminal.<br>
	For example, if the user presses a scroll key, the portable terminal scrolls the<br>
screen downwards and displays the characters out of the display area on a new screen 230.<br><br>
Movement between the screens 220 and 230 is adaptively performed according to scroll up<br>
and down operations.<br>
	In an enlargement mode of the screen 240, characters of a line outS1de the<br>
screen width due to enlargement are sequentially moved to the next line, and those characters<br>
out of the display area are moved to a new screen page. The user can view the characters out<br>
of the display area through page up and down operations by presS1ng function keys of the<br>
portable terminal.<br>
	For example, if the user presses a page down key, the portable terminal moves<br>
from the screen 240 to the next page (a screen 250) to display the characters out of the<br>
display area. Movement between the screens 240 and 250 is adaptively performed according<br>
to page up and down operations.<br>
	In an enlargement mode of the screen 260, characters outS1de the display area<br>
due to enlargement can be viewed through screen movement operations by presS1ng function<br>
keys of the portable terminal.<br>
	For example, if the user presses screen up/down/left/right keys, the portable<br>
terminal moves from the screen 260 to a screen 270 to display characters out of the display<br>
area. Movement between the screens 260 and 270 is adaptively performed according to<br>
screen up/down/left/right operations.<br>
	In FIG. 2, the name of a service category in a menu, such as 'text message', is<br>
enlarged or moved along characters on the screen in response to corresponding events, it may<br>
also be fixed without change depending upon display mode settings. In data enlargement or<br>
screen movement, displayed menu item names are changed according to types or formats of<br>
user data displayed on the screen.<br>
	FIG. 3 illustrates another series of character S1ze adjustment operations in the<br>
portable terminal of FIG. 1. Display screen representations of FIG. 3 illustrate character<br>
reduction operations involving screen movement in viewing, for example, a text message to<br>
be transmitted or received through an SMS service.<br>
	In FIG. 3, during display of an initial screen 310, when a key event for<br>
reduction is input from the user, the portable terminal reduces characters on the screen 310 by<br>
a ratio, and displays screen 320 or 360 with reduced characters depending upon preset display<br>
mode settings.<br><br>
     In a reduction mode of the screen 320, arrangement of user data in the initial<br>
screen 310 is retained irrespective of reduction.   Reduction of characters in the screen 320<br>
may result in screen 330, 340 or 350 depending upon the display mode settings.<br>
	In the screen 330, characters are reduced with respect to the upper left end of<br>
the display unit of the portable terminal. In the screen 340, characters are reduced with<br>
respect to the upper central end of the display unit.. In the screen 350, characters are reduced<br>
with respect to the center of the display unit.<br>
	According  to  an  exemplary  implementation,  instances  of the  center  of<br>
reduction in reduction of displayed user data are given above for the purpose of illustration.<br>
However, the center of reduction may also be set to various locations of the display unit, for<br>
example lower left end, middle left end, lower central end, upper right end, middle right and<br>
lower right end according to user preferences.<br>
	Movement between the screens 330, 340 and 350 is adaptively performed<br>
according to screen movement operations initiated by function keys input from the user.<br>
	In a reduction mode of the screen 360, arrangement of user data differs from<br>
that of the initial screen 310. That is, characters of the initial screen 310 are rearranged to fill<br>
lines of the screen in sequence from the beginning (automatic line rearrangement), as shown<br>
in the screen 360.   Blank characters inserted by the user for performing functions such as<br>
spacing words are preserved in this rearrangement.<br>
	Although in FIG. 3 the name of a service category in a menu, for example<br>
'text message', is reduced or moved relative to characters on the screen in response to<br>
corresponding events, it may also be fixed without change depending upon display mode<br>
settings. In data reduction or screen movement, displayed menu item names are changed<br>
according to types or formats of user data displayed on the screen.<br>
	FIG. 4 illustrates another series of character S1ze adjustment operations in the<br>
portable terminal of FIG. 1. Display screen representations of FIG. 4 illustrate character<br>
enlargement and reduction operations involving screen movement in response to key events<br>
in viewing, for example, a text message to be transmitted or received through an SMS service.<br>
In particular, characters of a line outS1de the screen width due to enlargement are sequentially<br>
moved to the next line, and those characters out of the display area can be viewed through<br>
scrolling operations.<br><br>
	In FIG. 4, during display of an initial screen 410, when a key event for<br>
enlargement is input from the user, the portable terminal enlarges characters on the screen<br>
410 by a enlargement ratio, and displays a screen 420 with enlarged characters.   Various<br>
values may be given to the enlargement ratio depending upon display mode settings.<br>
	For example, if the enlargement ratio is set to 1.5, characters in the screen are<br>
enlarged 1.5 times in response to a key event for enlargement. If the enlargement ratio is set<br>
to 2, characters in the screen are enlarged two times in response to a key event for<br>
enlargement. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the enlargement ratio<br>
may be set to any value within an enlargement range that the portable terminal supports, for<br>
example 1.5, 2, 3 and 4.<br>
	When the enlargement ratio is set to 2, characters in the screen are enlarged<br>
two times in response to a key event for enlargement, then the enlarged characters are<br>
enlarged another two times in response to another key event for enlargement. For example, if<br>
a key event for enlargement occurs during display of the screen 420, enlarged characters of<br>
the screen 420 are enlarged once again by an enlargement ratio corresponding to the previous<br>
enlargement ratio, as shown in a screen 430. Enlargement ratios between corresponding<br>
succesS1ve key events for enlargement are kept constant.<br>
	According    to    display    mode    settings,    enlargement    ratios    between<br>
corresponding succesS1ve key events for enlargement may also be varied, for example, in<br>
order of 1.5, 2 and 3 or in order of 2, 4 and 6.<br>
	When a key event for reduction occurs during display of the screen 430,<br>
characters are reduced by a ratio as shown in the screen 420. When a key event for reduction<br>
occurs during display of the screen 420, characters are reduced by a ratio as shown in the<br>
screen 410. S1ze reduction steps correspond in reverse order to S1ze enlargement steps.<br>
	In addition, during display of an initial screen 410, when a key event for<br>
reduction is input from the user, the portable terminal reduces characters on the screen 410 by<br>
a reduction ratio, and displays a screen 440 with reduced characters. Various values may be<br>
given to the reduction ratio depending upon display mode settings.<br>
	For example, if the reduction ratio is set to 2/3, characters in the screen are<br>
reduced by 2/3 in response to a key event for reduction. If the reduction ratio is set to 1/2,<br>
characters in the screen are reduced by 1/2 in response to a key event for reduction.   In an<br><br>
exemplary embodiment ofthe present invention, the reduction ratio may be set to any value<br>
within a reduction range that the portable terminal supports, for example 2/3, 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4.<br>
	When the reduction ratio is set to 1/2, characters in the screen are reduced by<br>
1/2 in response to a key event for reduction, then the reduced characters are reduced by<br>
another 1/2 in response to another key event for reduction. For example, if a key event for<br>
reduction occurs during display of the screen 440, reduced characters of the screen 440 are<br>
reduced once again by a reduction ratio corresponding to the previous reduction ratio, as<br>
shown in a screen 450. Reduction ratios between corresponding succesS1ve key events for<br>
reduction are kept constant.<br>
	According to display mode settings, reduction ratios between corresponding<br>
succesS1ve key events for reduction may also be varied, for example, in order of 2/3, 1/2 and<br>
1/3.<br>
	When a key event for enlargement occurs during display of the screen 450,<br>
characters are enlarged by a ratio as illustrated in the screen 440. When a key event for<br>
enlargement occurs during display of the screen 440, characters are enlarged by a ratio as<br>
illustrated in the screen 410. S1ze enlargement steps correspond in reverse order to S1ze<br>
reduction steps.<br>
	As described above in relation to FIG. 4, if a key event for enlargement is<br>
input through a function key such as the volume up key, during display of a screen, user data<br>
displayed on the screen is enlarged.. If the volume up key is input during display of the<br>
screen, the enlarged user data is enlarged once again. Also, if a key event for reduction is<br>
input through a function key, for example the volume down key, during display of a screen,<br>
user data displayed on the screen is reduced. If the volume down key is input during display<br>
of the screen, the reduced user data is reduced once again.<br>
	During display of enlarged or reduced user data on the screen 430 or screen<br>
450, the screen 430 or screen 450 directly returns to the initial screen 410 through a S1ngle<br>
key event. That is, the screen 430 or screen 450 that is created by enlargement or reduction<br>
corresponding to one or more key events can directly return to the initial screen 410 in<br>
response to a key event for return without repeated enlargement or reduction.<br>
 A function key such as the cancel key, is mapped to the key event of returning<br>
to the initial screen. When the cancel key is input during display of enlarged or reduced user<br>
data on a screen, the screen directly returns to the initial non-enlarged and non-reduced<br><br>
screen,    In addition, if the set enlargement or reduction ratio deviates from an allowed<br>
enlargement or reduction range, the screen may automatically return to the initial screen.<br>
	Although not shown in FIG. 4, if the display unit of the portable terminal<br>
includes a touch screen, displayed user data can be enlarged/reduced through the<br>
corresponding touch screen capability. The user activates the enlargement/reduction mode<br>
through a function key, then touches a deS1red area uS1ng the touch screen capability or<br>
performs a drag operation to enlarge/reduce corresponding user data.<br>
	For example, user data displayed on the screen can be enlarged through a drag<br>
operation from the upper left end to the lower right end of the screen, or be reduced through a<br>
drag operation from the lower right end to the upper left end of the screen.<br>
 In user data enlargement/reduction according to an exemplary embodiment of<br>
the present invention as illustrated in FIG. 4, the type of displayed user data is identified and<br>
the user data is enlarged or reduced based on the identified type. For example, if currently<br>
displayed user data is identified to be an emoticon, the user data is enlarged or reduced in a<br>
manner relevant to the emoticon type data. For specialized user data such as an emoticon that<br>
may be deformed in the process of enlargement or reduction, the type of displayed user data<br>
is identified in advance and used to control enlargement/reduction of the user data and<br>
subsequent screen movement so as not to deform, the displayed user data.<br>
	FIG. 5 illustrates a series of menu S1ze adjustment operations in the portable<br>
terminal of FIG. 1. FIG. 5 illustrates steps to enlarge and reduce a particular menu of a user<br>
interface in response to key events, hi particular, user data (menu items) outS1de the display<br>
area due to enlargement can be viewed through up/down/left/right scrolling operations<br>
initiated by function keys.<br>
 In FIG. 5, during display of an initial menu screen 510, when, a key event for<br>
enlargement is input from the user, the portable terminal enlarges menu items on the screen<br>
510 by a enlargement ratio, and displays a screen 520 with enlarged menu items. Various<br>
values may be given to the enlargement ratio depending upon display mode settings.<br>
 When a key event for reduction occurs during display of a screen 530, menu<br>
items are reduced by a ratio as shown in the screen 520. When a key event for reduction<br>
occurs during display of the screen 520, menu items are reduced by a ratio as shown in the<br>
screen 510. S1ze reduction steps correspond in reverse order to S1ze enlargement steps.<br><br>
	In addition, during display of an initial screen 510, when a key event for<br>
reduction is input from the user, the portable terminal reduces menu items on the screen 510<br>
by a reduction ratio, and displays a screen 540 with reduced menu items. Various values may<br>
be given to the reduction ratio depending upon display mode settings.<br>
 When a key event for enlargement occurs during display of a screen 550,<br>
menu items are enlarged by a ratio as shown in the screen 540. When a key event for<br>
enlargement occurs during display of the screen 540, menu items are enlarged by a ratio as<br>
shown in the screen 510. S1ze enlargement steps correspond in reverse order to S1ze<br>
reduction steps.<br>
	Depending upon display mode settings, in a state in which a menu item on<br>
which the cursor is located is selected and highlighted as the center of enlargement or<br>
reduction, when a key event for enlargement or reduction occurs, menu items on the screen<br>
are enlarged or reduced with respect to the selected menu item. That is, a deS1red center of<br>
enlargement or reduction can be specified for user convenience.<br>
	As described above, the data enlargement/reduction method of an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention is applied to user data composed of character data<br>
utilized in, for example, an SMS, MMS or menu service. The data enlargement/reduction<br>
method can also be applied to multimedia data such as images and moving pictures as<br>
illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7. Referring to FIGS. 6 and 7, application of the data<br>
enlargement/reduction method to multimedia data is described below. Steps of multimedia<br>
data enlargement/reduction are S1milar to those of character data enlargement/reduction, and<br>
are not described in detail.<br>
	FIG- 6 illustrates a series of image S1ze adjustment operations in the portable<br>
terminal of FIG. 1. FIG. 6 illustrates steps to enlarge and reduce images on the screen in<br>
response to key events. In FIG. 6, the user data enlargement/reduction method of an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention is applied to a search menu for finding a<br>
deS1red image in a folder.<br>
 User data (images) outS1de the display area due to enlargement may be viewed<br>
through up/down/left/right scroll operations initiated by function keys. In reduction of<br>
images in response to a key event for reduction, images on the screen are rearranged to fill<br>
lines of the screen in sequence, from the beginning (automatic line rearrangement).<br><br>
	FIG. .7 illustrates another series of image S1ze adjustment operations in the<br>
portable terminal of FIG. 1. FIG. 7 illustrates steps to enlarge and reduce images on the<br>
screen in response to key events.<br>
	User data (images) outS1de the display area due to enlargement may be viewed<br>
through up/down/left/right screen movement operations initiated by function keys. If a<br>
particular image is selected by the user, for example, in an image search menu displayed on a<br>
screen 710, the selected image is enlarged or reduced.<br>
	Hereinafter,  user  data  enlargement/reduction  operations  of the  portable<br>
terminal of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention are described.<br>
	FIG. 8 is a flow chart illustrating a method to enlarge or reduce displayed user<br>
data in response to key events for the portable terminal of FIG. 1.<br>
	Referring to FIG. 8, the portable terminal displays requested user data on the<br>
screen (S801) and determines whether a key event is input from the user (S803). The user<br>
data includes all kinds of data that may be handled by the portable terminal, such as<br>
multimedia data including menus, images and moving pictures, character data related to text<br>
messages transmitted/received through SMS or MMS services, and communication data<br>
related to electronic mails.<br>
	If a key event is input at step S803, the portable terminal determines whether<br>
or not the input key event is a request for enlargement/reduction (S805).<br>
	If a key event other than an enlargement or reduction event is input at step<br>
S803, the portable terminal performs an operation associated with the input key event (S807).<br>
For example, if an SMS function is requested for text message transmisS1on, the portable<br>
terminal runs a corresponding application and displays a text input window through the<br>
display unit.<br>
	If the input key event is determined to be a request for enlargement or<br>
reduction at step S805, the portable terminal enlarges or reduces the user data displayed on<br>
the screen by an enlargement or reduction ratio set in advance depending upon the input key<br>
event (S809).<br>
	FIGS. 9A and 9B are flow charts illustrating detailed steps of the method of<br>
FIG. 8.<br>
	Referring to FIGS.  9A and  9B, the portable terminal initially displays<br>
requested user data on the screen (S901), and determines whether a key event is input through<br><br>
the key input unit from the user (S903).  The user data includes all kinds of data that can be<br>
displayed on the screen, such as text data transmitted or received through an SMS function.<br>
	If a key event is input at step S903, the portable terminal determines whether<br>
an enlargement/reduction mode is set for enlargement or reduction of displayed user data<br>
(S905).<br>
	If the enlargement/reduction mode is not set, the portable terminal performs an<br>
operation associated with the input key event (S907).  For example, if a multimedia related<br>
operation  for image  search  is requested,  the portable  terminal  runs  a corresponding<br>
application and displays an image search window through the display unit.<br>
	If the enlargement/reduction mode is set at step S905, the portable terminal<br>
identifies whether the input key event is a request for enlargement or reduction (S909).<br>
 The portable terminal determines whether the input key event is a request for<br>
user data enlargement (S911). If the input key event is a request for enlargement, the<br>
portable terminal enlarges the displayed user data by a preset enlargement ratio (S913). If the<br>
input key event is not a request for enlargement, the portable terminal determines whether the<br>
input key event is a request for reduction (S915). If the input key event is a request for<br>
reduction, the portable terminal reduces the displayed user data at a preset reduction ratio<br>
(S917). Specific methods of displaying user data after enlargement or reduction are<br>
described below.<br>
 After user data enlargement at step S913 or reduction at step S917, the<br>
portable terminal determines whether a new key event is input from the user (S919). If a new<br>
key event is input, the portable terminal determines whether the input key event is a request<br>
for enlargement or reduction (S921).<br>
	If the input key event is a request for enlargement or reduction, the portable<br>
terminal enlarges or reduces the displayed user data by a preset enlargement or reduction<br>
ratio (S923), and returns to step S919 for further event procesS1ng. The user data displayed<br>
on the screen is enlarged at step S913 or reduced at step S917 and further enlarged or reduced<br>
at step S923. The enlargement and reduction ratios at step S923 correspond to those at steps<br>
S913 and S917.<br>
	If the input key event is not a request for enlargement or reduction at step<br>
S921, the portable terminal determines whether the input key event is a request for screen<br>
movement (S925).   If the input key event is a request for screen movement, the portable<br><br>
terminal moves the screen in a requested direction according to display mode settings (S927):<br>
Specific methods of screen movement after user data enlargement or reduction are described<br>
later.<br>
	If the input key event is not a request for screen movement at step S925, the<br>
portable terminal determines whether the input key event is a request for a screen change<br>
(S929). If the input key event is a request for a screen change, the portable terminal displays<br>
a previous or next page on the screen (S931).  The S1ze of user data displayed on the screen<br>
after a screen change corresponds to that of displayed user data before a screen change.<br>
	If the input key event is not a request for a screen change at step S929, the<br>
portable terminal determines whether the input key event is a request for termination of the<br>
enlargement/reduction mode (S933). If the input key event is a request for termination of the<br>
enlargement/reduction mode, then the method ends, otherwise the portable terminal performs<br>
step S907 for performance of a requested operation.<br>
	Although not shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B, the portable terminal preferably<br>
restores, in response to a key event for return, the initially displayed user data on the screen<br>
directly from enlarged or reduced user data.<br>
	FIG. 10 is a flow chart illustrating steps to display user data according to<br>
preset data display formats.<br>
	Referring   to   FIG.    10,   the   portable   terminal   determines   whether   an<br>
enlargement/reduction request to enlarge or reduce displayed user data is input (S1 001). If an<br>
enlargement/reduction request is input, the portable terminal identifies a data display format<br>
set in advance (S1003).<br>
 If the data display format is set as non-rearrangeable, the portable terminal<br>
enlarges or reduces user data displayed on the screen by a enlargement/reduction ratio<br>
without rearrangement of the user data (S1007).<br>
	If the data display format is set as rearrangeable, the portable terminal enlarges<br>
or reduces user data displayed on the screen by a enlargement/reduction ratio with<br>
rearrangement of the user data (S1011). Automatic line rearrangement is utilized at step<br>
S1011. For example, in enlargement, characters or images of a line outS1de the screen width<br>
due to enlargement are sequentially moved to the next line. In reduction, characters or<br>
images on the screen are rearranged so as to fill lines of the screen in sequence from the<br>
beginning.<br><br>
	FIG. 11 is a flow chart illustrating steps to move.the screen according to preset<br>
screen movement schemes.<br>
[00140]	Referring to FIG. 11, the portable terminal initially determines whether a key<br>
event for screen movement is input (S1 101).  If screen movement is requested, the portable<br>
terminal identifies a screen movement scheme set in advance (S1 103).<br>
	If the screen movement scheme is set to screen-scroll, the portable terminal<br>
scrolls the screen up or down depending upon the input key event (S1 107).<br>
	If the screen movement scheme is set to cursor movement, the portable<br>
terminal moves the cursor displayed on the screen in an upward/downward/left/right direction<br>
depending upon the input key event (S1ll 1).<br>
       If the screen movement scheme is set to page up/down, the portable terminal<br>
displays the previous page or next page depending upon the input key event (S1 115).<br>
	FIG. 12 is a flow chart illustrating a method to adjust S1zes of characters<br>
during text message transmisS1on and reception uS1ng the portable terminal of FIG. 1.<br>
	Referring to FIG.  12, the portable terminal displays a requested window<br>
containing character data on the screen (S1201), and determines whether a key event is input<br>
from the user (S1203). The displayed window is a character window for sending or receiving<br>
text data through SMS, MMS or data communication services.<br>
	If a key event is input at step S1203, the portable terminal determines whether<br>
an enlargement/reduction mode is set for enlargement or reduction of displayed character<br>
data (S1205). The character data includes any type of data that can be displayed on the<br>
character window, such as text message data transmitted or received through an SMS<br>
function.<br>
	If the enlargement/reduction mode is not set, the portable terminal performs an<br>
operation associated with the input key event (S1207). For example, if a text message<br>
transmisS1on is requested, the portable terminal runs a corresponding application and displays<br>
a text message transmisS1on window.<br>
	If the enlargement/reduction mode is set at step S1205, the portable terminal<br>
identifies a data display format set in advance (S1209).<br>
	If the data display format is set as rearrangeable (S1211), the portable terminal<br>
enlarges or reduces character data displayed on the screen by an associated<br>
enlargement/reduction ratio while rearranging the character data through automatic line<br><br>
rearrangement within the S1ze of the screen (S1213).   If some characters are outS1de the<br>
display area due to enlargement, a scroll marker or other indicator is displayed to inform of<br>
the presence of a next page.<br>
	If the data display format is set as non-rearrangeable, the portable terminal<br>
enlarges   or   reduces   character   data   displayed   on   the   screen   by   an   associated<br>
enlargement/reduction ratio without rearrangement of the character data (S1215).<br>
	If a new request for enlargement/reduction is input from the user after data<br>
enlargement/reduction at step S1213 or step S1215, the enlarged or reduced character data is<br>
enlarged or reduced once more by the corresponding enlargement/reduction ratio.<br>
	After data enlargement/reduction at step S1213 or step S1215, if screen<br>
movement is requested (S1217), the portable terminal moves the screen according to the set<br>
data display format (S1219). For example, if the data display format is set as rearrangeable,<br>
the portable terminal moves the screen through scrolling or page up/down operations.  If the<br>
data display format is set as non-rearrangeable, the portable terminal moves the screen<br>
through up/down/left/right cursor movement operations.<br>
	The method may further include a restoring step in which the portable terminal<br>
restores, in response to a key event for return, the initially displayed character data on the<br>
screen directly from the enlarged or reduced character data.<br>
	An exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides a display data<br>
