Description<br>
Method for producing the enantiomeric forms of cis 1,3-cyclohexanediol derivatives<br>
The invention relates to a process for preparing chiral, nonracemic, cis-configured 1,3-disubstituted cyclohexanols of the formula (I)<br><br>
Variously substituted, cis-configured 1,3-disubstituted cyclohexane derivatives (compounds of the formula (I) where R * R ) are central building blocks or precursors of the active pharmaceutical ingredients which are described in WO 03/020269 and are generally suitable for treating lipid metabolism disorders, type II diabetes and syndrome X, inter alia.<br>
The syntheses which are described in the patent application 03/020269 of the nonracemic, cis-configured 1,3-cyclohexane derivatives cannot be considered as industrial processes: for example, alkylations with NaH/DMF on the multi-kg scale cannot be carried out safely (C&amp;EN, September 13, 1982, 5). Moreover, the alkylation by the Bu2SnO method on the industrial<br>
scale entails unacceptably high cost and inconvenience; the removal of the tin compounds from the desired products is very difficult and usually incomplete even when chromatographic separating methods are used. The disposal of the tin compounds is a further problem and a cost factor. The separation of the enantiomers (optical resolution) by chromatography on a chiral phase is likewise inconvenient and too expensive. In addition, it is necessary for chromatographic enantiomer resolution that the racemic compound is present in good chemical purity, which can be achieved in many cases by additional, preceding chromatography.<br><br>
Other methods which have been described in literature for synthesizing cis-1,3-cyclohexanediol building blocks or derivatives, for example the opening of epoxycyclohexanes (P. Crotti, V. Di Bussolo, L. Favero, M. Pineschi, F. Marianucci, G. Renzi, G. Amici, G. Roselli, Tetrahedron 2000, 56, 7513-7524 and cit. lit.) or the metaliized-catalyzed hydroboration of cyclohexene derivatives (J.A. Brinkmann, T.T. Nguyen, J.R. Sowa, Jr., Org. Lett. 2000, 2, 981-983; C.E. Garrett, G.C. Fu, J. Org. Chem. 1998, 63, 1370-1371) are predominantly unsatisfactory with regard to the regioselectivity and the stereoselectivity. The total number of stages is additionally distinctly higher. They cannot be considered as industrial processes. The synthesis of cis-1,3-cyclohexanediol derivatives starting from cis,cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol or cis,cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol derivatives (L. Dumortier, M. Carda, J. Van der Eycken, G. Snatzke, M. Vandewalle, Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 1991, 2, 789-792; H. Suemune, K. Matsuno, M. Uchida, K. Sakai, Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 1992, 3, 297-306) are likewise very complicated and uneconomic as a consequence of the high number of stages and therefore unsuitable for industrial use. The enzymatic reaction of the cis/trans mixture of 1,3-cyclohexanediol with S-ethyl thiooctanoate cannot be considered as an industrial process. Apart from the odor nuisance which can barely be avoided when working with the sulfur compounds and the fact that to achieve the required conversion, the ethanethiol which is released has to be removed continuously, the reaction described leads to a mixture of 9 isomeric forms or derivatives of cyclohexanediol, i.e. the unconverted isomers (S,S)-dioI, (R,R)-diol and (R,S)-diol, also the monoacylated products (S,S)-monooctanoate, (R,R)-monooctanoate and (R,S)-monooctanoate, and thirdly the group of the diacylated products (S,S)-dioctanoate, (R,R)-dioctanoate and (R,S)-dioctanoate. The optically active, monoacylated, cis-configured (R,S)-monooctanoate takes up only a proportion of about 12% in the fraction of the monoacylated cyclohexanediols. A preparation and isolation of this product on the preparative scale has not been described, but in view of the ratios of amounts and the separating problem outlined, cannot be economic. In addition, it is known that partially acylated di- or polyhydroxy compounds tend to acyl group migrations. When this occurs, for example, in the course of the purification of the (R,S)-monooctanoate (for example in the chromatography on silica gel or in aqueous extraction) or in the course of a subsequent reaction (for example during the alkylation of the free hydroxyl group), this leads to a distinct reduction in the optical purity or to racemization.<br><br>
The cis-configured (R,S)-diols and the diacylated (R,S)-compounds are not optically active and therefore not of interest.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to develop a process which does not have the disadvantages mentioned.<br>
The   present   invention   provides   a   process   for   preparing   a   chiral, nonracemic compound of the formula I<br><br>

Possible process variants are illustrated hereinbelow in Schemes I to IV:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The process according to the invention is economic, simple and rapid. The process completely eliminates the risk of acyl group migration, does not require equimolar amounts of optically pure starting materials or auxiliaries, any expensive reagents, any optical resolution by chromatography on chiral phases, any disproportionately large amounts of solvent or any cost-intensive working steps.<br>
The loss of 50% which is typical for optical resolutions can be avoided by using both enantiomers and changing the sequence of the alkylations. Preference is given to what is known as the enantioconvergent method (see Scheme IV or Method C and D)) in which the procedure is, for<br>
example, as follows: alkylation of cis-1,3-cyclohexanediol of the formula (II)<br>
2 with a compound of the formula (III) with a PG selected as R  such that PG<br>
can be detached again simply and selectively in the course of the further synthesis, and PG is thus, for example, benzyl, or para-methoxybenzyl or tert-butyldimethylsilyl, subjecting the resulting compound of the formula (IV) to stereoselective enzymatic ester formation or ester hydrolysis (see above) and, after completion of separation of unconverted alcohol and ester, converting them separately and by different routes to the same optically pure product by reacting the alcohol (as described in the first part), for example, with a compound of the formula (VI) to give a compound of the formula (la), then converting it by detaching the PG group to give a compound of the formula (VII), and then reacting it with a compound of the<br>
2 formula (III) where R   is as desired in the product to give a compound of<br>
the formula (I), and converting the isomeric ester by simple ester hydrolysis to a compound of the formula (IV), and then reacting with a compound of<br>
2<br>
the formula (III) where R is as desired in the product to give a compound of the formula (VIM)<br><br>
then converting it by detaching the PG group to give a compound of the formula (IV)<br><br><br><br><br>
where<br>
ring A is phenyl, 5-12 membered heteroaromatic ring which may contain one or more heteroatoms from the group of N, O and S, fused/bicyclic 8 to 14 membered aromatic ring, (C3-C8)-cycloalkyl;<br>
R3      is H, CF3, (C1-C6)-alkyl, (C3-C8)-cycloalkyl, phenyl; R4 R5 are H, F, Br, CF3, OCF3, (Ci-Ce)-alkyl, O-(C1-C6)-alkyl;<br>
n         is from 1 to 2;<br>
2 R        is (Ci-C8)-alkyl where one or more CH2 groups in the alkyl groups<br>
may be replaced by O, CO, S, SO or SO2, and alkyl may be one to trisubstituted by F, Cl, Br, CF3, CN, NO2, NHAc, NHBoc, NH-CO-C(CH3)3, hydroxyl, OCF3, O-(C<i-c6 cooh co-benzoxy co-o tetrazole thiazolidine-2 indole and in which aryl may turn be substituted by f cl br cf3 cn no2 nhac nhts nhboc nhcbz nh-co-c hydroxyl ocf3 o- or tetrazole.></i-c6>

The alkyl radicals in the substituents R , R , R and R may be either straight-chain or branched.<br>
In this context, a heteroaromatic ring refers to both mono- and bicyclic rings having a maximum of 4 heteroatoms, in particular those which contain up to 4 nitrogen atoms and/or 1 oxygen or 1 sulfur atom, for example furan, thiophene, thiazole, oxazole, thiadiazole, triazole, pyridine, triazine, quinoline, isoquinoline, indole, benzothiophene, benzofuran, benzotriazole. Aromatic rings may be mono- or bicyclic and also be fused, for example naphthyl, benzo[1,3]dioxole, dihydrobenzo[1,4]dioxin.<br><br>
The racemic, cis-configured 1,3-cyclohexane derivatives of the formula (IV) and of the formula (VII) are prepared by monoalkylating cis-cyclohexanediol (compound of the formula II), but can also be prepared by reductively opening appropriate acetals (R. Hunter et alM J. Org. Chem. 1993, 85, 6756), and also by reductive ether formation starting from silyl ethers and aldehydes or ketones (J.S. Bajwa, X. Jiang, J. Slade, K. Prasad, O. Repic, T.J. Blacklock, Tetrahedron Lett. 2002, 43, 6709-6713).<br>
The alkylating reagents of the formula III are commercially obtainable or can be prepared by literature methods, for example by free-radical side chain halogenation (see literature review by R.C. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, p. 313, 1989 VCH Publishers, Inc.) or from the alcohols or derivatives preparable therefrom (see literature review by R.C. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, p. 353-363, 1989 VCH Publishers, Inc.).<br>
Also known (see J. Chem. Soc. 1925, 127, 2275-2297; J. Chem. Soc. 1922, 121, 2202-2215) is the preparation of various 2-bromomethylbenzoyl bromides by free-radical bromination, which may then be converted by further reaction with alcohols to the bromomethylbenzoic esters belonging to the group of the alkylating reagents of the formula III.<br>
2 The alkylating reagents of the formula (VI) or the alcohols X  = OH which<br>
can serve as precursors are commercially obtainable or can be prepared by literature methods [a). The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds (Ed.: A. Weissberger, E.C. Taylor): Oxazoles (Ed.: I.J. Turchi); b) Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Houben-Weyl, 4th edition, Hetarene III, subvolume 1; c) I. Simit, E. Chindris, Arch. Pharm. 1971, 304, 425; d) Y. Goto, M. Yamazaki, M. Hamana, Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1971, 19 (10), 2050-2057].<br>
The alkylating reagents of the formula III and VI are reacted with 1,3-cyclohexanediol or 1,3-cyclohexanediol derivatives in the presence of bases. Suitable bases are, for example, hydroxides such as KOH, carbonates such as CS2CO3, alkoxides such as KOtBu and also compounds such as LDA, BuLi, LiHMDS, KH, NaH and NaHMDS. Suitable solvents are, for example, THF, MTBE, DME, NMP, DMF and chlorobenzene.<br><br>
For optical resolution of the alcohols, they are taken up in organic solvents, for example dimethoxyethane (DME), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), diisopropyl ether (DIPE), THF, n-hexane, cyclohexane, toluene, chlorobenzene, acetone, dimethylformamide (DMF), dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane and tert-butanol, acyl donors such as vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl butyrate, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl 2H,2H-perfluorodecanoate, ethoxyvinyl acetate, p-nitro- or p-chlorophenyl acetate, oxime esters, acetic anhydride, propionic anhydride, succinic anhydride, glutaric anhydride, isovaleric anhydride, 2,2,2-trichloroethyl butyrate, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl 2H,2H-perfiuorodecanoate are added and the reaction mixture is subsequently admixed with a suitable enzyme and stirred at from -20 to 80°C. The proportion of cosolvent in the solution is preferably 10-90%, but it is in some cases also advantageous to carry out the enzymatic reaction in pure acyl donor, for example vinyl acetate, without cosolvent.<br>
For optical resolution of the ester derivatives, for example acetyl-, propionyl-, butyryl- or glutaryl-, they are subjected in homogeneous or heterogeneous, aqueous, aqueous-organic or organic media, in the presence of a suitable enzyme, to stereoselective hydrolysis or alcoholysis (for. example with n-butanol) at a temperature of 10-80°C, optionally in the presence of cosolvents (see above) and of a buffer, the reaction mixture preferably containing 2-50% by weight of ester.<br>
The abovementioned ester derivatives can be prepared by literature methods, for example by reacting the alcohol with acid chlorides such as acetyl chloride or anhydrides such as acetic anhydride, in the presence of an amine, for example triethylamine or pyridine (see literature review by R.C. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, p. 978, 1989 VCH Publishers, Inc.).<br>
When the reaction has ended, the products or the enantiomers can be separated in a simple manner, for example by extraction by literature methods [a). T. Yamano, F. Kikumoto, S. Yamamoto, K. Miwa, M.

A further method is, on completion of the enzymatic reaction, to distinctly increase the water solubility of the remaining alcohol by derivatization, for example by acylation with cyclic anhydrides, e.g. with glutaric anhydride, or<br><br>
by conversion to a cholin ester [a). H. Kunz, M. Buchholz, Chem. Ben 1979, 112, 2145; b). M. Schelhaas, S. Glomsda, M. Hansler, H.-D. Jakubke, H. Waldmann, Angew. Chem. 1996, 108, 82] and thus to achieve separation from the water-insoluble or sparingly water-soluble esters by extraction. After the separation, the derivatization of the alcohols can be reversed by chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis. A particularly interesting means for separating the enantiomers in the case of the enzymatic acylation is to select the acyl donor in such a way that the acylated enantiomer is distinctly more water-soluble than the unconverted alcohol. Suitable acyl donors are, for example, cyclic anhydrides such as succinic anhydride. On completion of the enzymatic acylation, the acylation product bears a free carboxyl group which enables rapid removal of the product by aqueous extraction under basic conditions, for example with sat. aqueous NaHCO3 solution.<br>
In enzymatic optical resolution by ester hydrolysis, the procedure is preferably to admix an ester of the formula (I), for example where R1 = COCH3, COCH2CH3 or COCH2CH2CH2COOH in an aqueous or<br>
alcoholic solution, with an esterase or lipase and stirred. It may be advantageous to buffer the solution mentioned, for example with phosphate or TRIS [= tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine] buffer. The additive may, for example, be 0.01-1.0 molar. A favorable buffer range is pH 5-10.<br>
The enzymes used are preferably hydrolases from mammalian livers, for example lipase from porcine pancreas (fluka), or from microorganisms, for example Lipase B from Candida antarctica (Roche Diagnostics), Lipase OF from Candida rugosa (Meito Sangyo), Lipase SL from Pseudomonas cepacia (Meito Sangyo), Lipase L-10 from Alcaligenes spec. (Roche Diagnostics), and Lipase QL from Alcaligenes spec. (Meito Sangyo). When the esters used are glutaric acid derivatives, for example mono-(3-benzyloxycyclohexyl) glutarate, it may be advantageous, instead of the abovementioned lipases, to use glutaryl-7-ACA Acylase (Roche Diagnostics).<br>
Particular preference is given to using Lipase B from Candida antarctica (Roche Diagnostics), and it may be advantageous to use the free enzyme or an immobilized form of the enzyme, for example one of the three products which are currently obtainable commercially.<br><br>
Each of the enzymes mentioned can be used in free or in immobilized form (Immobilized Biocatalysts, W. Hartmeier, Springer Verlag Berlin, 1988). The amount of enzyme is selected freely depending on the reaction rate or on the desired reaction time and on the type of the enzyme (for example free or immobilized) and can be determined easily by simple preliminary experiments. The enzyme can be recovered by freeze-drying. The removal (and optional later reuse) of the enzyme can be eased by immobilization.<br>
Suitable reaction control always succeeds in obtaining at least one enantiomer in optically pure form. When optically pure ester is desired, the conversion in the case of an enzymatic ester formation should be less than (or equal to) 50%, or in the case of an enzymatic hydrolysis or alcoholysis, greater than (or equal to) 50%. When optically pure alcohol is desired, the conversion in the case of enzyme-catalyzed ester formation should be greater than (or equal to) 50%, or in the case of hydrolysis or alcoholysis, less than (or equal to) 50%.<br>
The conversion of the enzymatic reaction was determined either by HPLC directly from the reaction mixture or by calculation from the optical purities of the reaction products (ester and acid) which were likewise determined directly from the reaction mixture by HPLC on a chiral phase.<br>
The examples which follow are intended to illustrate the present invention in detail.<br>
Examples:<br>
All isolated  products  and  crude  product mixtures were  identified  by H NMR and mass spectra or by HPLC.<br>
The optical purity of the esters and alcohols was determined by HPLC, for example on Chiralpak AD 250 x 4.6 (Daicel) or Chiracel OD 250 x 4.6.<br>
