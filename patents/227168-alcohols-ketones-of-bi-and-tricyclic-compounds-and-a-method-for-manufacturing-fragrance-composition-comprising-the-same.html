This invention relates to novel compounds having woody, vetiver and patchouli-like odour notes. This invention relates furthermore to a method for their production and to flavour and fragrance compositions containing them.<br>
Compounds having woody, vetiver and patchouli-like odour notes are described in the literature, for example the class of sesquiterpenes that naturally occur in essential oils and which can be isolated by water-steam distillation of a plant or parts of a plant. This process is very cost intensive and the quality and the odour as well as the flavour characteristics of the isolated compounds may vary with the climate and the origin of the plant. Thus, there is an ongoing demand in the fragrance and flavour industry for new compounds imparting, enhancing, or improving woody, vetiver and patchouli-like notes.<br>
Tricyclic sesquiterpenes, in particular patchoulol and derivatives thereof have been disclosed in the U.S. Patent No. 4,011,269. The compounds described therein develop odoriferous notes the character of which is reminiscent of that of patchouli oil.<br>
We have now found a novel class of compounds having much sought after woody, vetiver and patchouli-like odour notes and which may be produced from synthetic starting materials.<br>

The compounds according to the present invention contain one or more chiral centres and as such may exist as a mixture of stereoisomers, or they may be resolved as isomerically pure forms. Resolving stereoisomers adds to the complexity of manufacture and purification of these compounds and so it is preferred to use the compounds as mixtures of their stereoisomers simply for economic reasons. However, if it is desired to prepare individual stereoisomers, this may be achieved according to methodology known in the art, e.g. preparative HPLC and GC or by stereoselective syntheses.<br>
Particular preferred compounds of formula la are 1,5,7,8,8-Pentamethyl-tricyclo[3.3.1.027]nonan-6-one, I.SJ.S.S-Pentamethyl-tricycloia.S.I.O^^nonan-e-one, 1,3,3,5,7,8,8-Heptamethyl-tricyclo[3.3.1.027]nonan-6-one, 3,3,5,7,8,8-Hexamethyl-tricyclo[3.3.1.02'7]nonan-6-one, 3,3,5,8,8-Pentamethyl-tricyclo[3.3.1.027]nonan-6-one, 5,7,8,8-Tetramethyl-tricyclo[3.3.1,02,7]nonan-6-one, and 5,6,7,8,8-Pentamethyl-tricyclo[3.3.1.02,7]nonan-6-ol.<br>
A particular preferred compound of formula lb is 1-lsopropyl-3,3,5-trimethyl-tricyclo[3.2.1.02 7]octan-6-one.<br>
Particular preferred compounds of formula Ic are 5-lsopropyl-1,3-dimethyl-bicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-2-one, 5-lsopropyl-1,3-dimethyl-bicyclo[3.2.1]octan-2-one, 5-tert-Butyl-1,3-dimethyl-bicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-2-one, 5-sec-Butyl-1,3-dimethyl-bicyclo[3.2.1 ]oct-3-ene-2-one, 5-lsopropyl-3-methyl-bicyclo[3.2.1 ]oct-3-ene-2-one, 5,7-Diisopropyl-3-methyl-bicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-2-one, 5-lsopropyl-3,7,7-trimethyl-bicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-2-one, and I.S.S-Trimethyl-I.S.ey.S.Sa-hexahydro-l^a-ethano-naphthalen-2-one.<br>
In another aspect the invention provides flavour and fragrance compositions comprising a compound of formula I or mixtures thereof, more particularly compounds of formula la, lb, or Ic or mixtures thereof. Particular preferred are compositions that comprise at least one compound of formula la and one compound of formula Ic.<br>
In addition, the compounds may be used in combination with a basis material. As used herein, the "basis material" includes all known odourant molecules selected from the extensive range of natural and synthetic molecules currently available, such as<br><br>
essential oil, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, ether and acetals, ester and lactones, macrocycles and heterocycles, and/or in admixture with one or more ingredients or excipients conventionally used in conjunction with odourants in fragrance compositions, for example carrier materials, and other auxiliary agents commonly used in the art.<br>
In one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention may be used in fragrance applications, e.g. in any field of fine and functionary perfumery.<br>
In another embodiment, the compounds of the present invention may be used in flavour applications and are particularly useful in modifying for example strawberry and raspberry flavours but also brown flavours. They may be used in herbal mixtures and teas. The compounds of the present invention are also well suited for example in mouthwash applications.<br>
In flavourant applications, the compounds of the present invention may be present in compositions in amounts ranging from 0.001 to 5 % by weight of a flavour composition, more preferably from 0.01 to 0.5 % by weight. The compounds according to the present invention may be used for herbal flavour compositions, strawberry and raspberry compositions, brown flavour compositions, or tea compositions.<br>
When used in fragrance applications, compounds of the present invention can be employed in wide ranging amounts depending upon the specific application and on the nature and quantity of other odourant ingredients, that may be for example, from about 0.001 to about 20 weight percent. In one embodiment compounds may be employed in a fabric softener comprising in amount of about 0.001 to 0.05 weight percent. In another embodiment compounds of the present invention may be in alcoholic solution in amounts of about 0.1 to 20 weight percent, more preferably between about 0.1 and 5 weight percent.<br>
However, these values should not be limiting on the present invention, since the experienced perfumer and flavourist may also achieve effects or may create novel accords with lower or higher concentrations.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be employed into the fragrance application simply by directly mixing the fragrance composition with the fragrance<br><br>
application, or they may, in an earlier step be entrapped with an entrapment material, for example, polymers, capsules, microcapsules and nanocapsules, liposomes, film formers, absorbents such as carbon or zeolites, cyclic oligosaccharides and mixtures thereof, or they may be chemically bonded to substrates, which are adapted to release the fragrance molecule upon application of an external stimulus such as light, enzyme, or the like, and then mixed with the application.<br>
Thus, the invention additionally provides a method of manufacturing a fragrance application, comprising the incorporation of a compound of formula I as a fragrance ingredient, either by directly admixing the compound of formula I to the application or by admixing a fragrance composition comprising a compound of formula I, which may then be mixed to a fragrance application, using conventional techniques and methods.<br>
As used herein, "fragrance application" means any product, such as fine perfumery, e.g. perfume and Eau de Toilette; household products, e.g. detergents for dishwasher, surface cleaner; laundry products, e.g. softener, bleach, detergent; body care products, e.g. shampoo, shower gel; and cosmetics, e.g. deodorant, vanishing creme, comprising an odourant. This list of products is given by way of illustration and is not to be regarded as being in any way limiting.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention may be prepared according to a process wherein appropriately substituted cyclohexenones are reacted with ally! bromide or allyl chloride under reaction conditions well known to the person skilled in the art (Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 2298 - 2303 (1993). The resulting alkylated cyclohexenones (formula II as shown below) may be converted in the presence of ethyl aluminium-dichloride or methyl aluminium-dichloride to provide compounds of formula I wherein R12 and R13 taken together represents an oxygen atom, as illustrated by compounds of formula la, lb, and Ic in scheme 1. The conditions under which such Lewis acid catalyzed reactions may proceed is described for example by Snider et al. in the Journal of Am. Chem. Soc. 1980, 102, 5872 - 5880 which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The resulting carbonyl group at C1 may be reduced and/or alkylated to give further compounds of formula I. Similarly, if there is a double bond at C6 and C8 this can be reduced in a known manner to give still further compounds of formula I.<br><br><br>
Compounds of formula II may also be prepared by alkylation of appropiately substituted phenols by reaction of the phenol with a metal hydride and an alkenylchloride (Greuter, H. et al. (1977) Helv. Chim. Acta, 60, 1701), followed by hydrogenation.<br>
Whether a compound of formula la, lb, Ic, or a mixture thereof is formed depends on the substituent pattern R2, R3, and R16 of the alkylated cyclohexenone (II). A compound of formula Ic is formed as a main product if R2, R3, and R18 of formula II are hydrogen. A mixture of compounds of formula la and lb as main product is performed if R2 and R3 of formula II at the same time are not hydrogen. A mixture of compounds of formula la and Ic as main product is formed if R2 and R3 of formula II are hydrogen and R16 of formula II is not hydrogen. The compounds are useful in flavour and/or fragrance compositions as mixtures, however, should one wish to use the compounds in pure form, they can be separated easily by purification processes, such as HPLC or preparative GC, according to the methodology known in the art.<br>
The term "main product", as used herein with reference to single compounds, refers to a product comprising at least 50% by weight of that compound, more preferably more than 75% by weight, most preferably more than 90% by weight. When this term is used in relation to a mixture of compounds, e.g. one compound of formula la and one compound of formula Ic, it refers to a product comprising at least 50% by weight of this<br><br>
mixture, more particular more than 75% by weight, most particular more than 90% by weight.<br>
The conversion of compounds of formula II for a selective preparation of compounds of formula la of the present invention may also be performed by photochemical induction. Surprisingly we found that compounds of formula la may be formed by photochemically induced intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of compounds of formula II. For the photochemical induction a Hg-lamp may be used for a time period of about 1 to 15 hours. However, the induction time may depend on the solvent used and on additives such as sensitisers and Lewis acids. Preferred solvents are methanol, ethanol and iso propanol.<br>
Thus, in another aspect the invention refers to a method of preparing compounds of formula la by photochemically induced cycloaddition.<br>
Further particulars as to reaction conditions are provided in the examples.<br>
