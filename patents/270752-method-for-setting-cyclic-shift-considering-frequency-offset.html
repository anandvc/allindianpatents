				<td>A method for establishing a cyclic shift sequence to provide against the frequency offset is disclosed.

This method easily establishes a cyclic shift (CS) interval at a specific location having no overlapping by considering a channel response of a reception (Rx) sequence and an alias location of this reception (Rx) sequence, although a reception (Rx) signal is shifted by a channel delay spreading or a propagation delay irrespective of categories of a domain generating a sequence, so that it can greatly reduce the number of the detection errors and the false alarm rate. And, if a sequence of the cyclic shift (CS) is allocated to a cell having a frequency offset of more than a predetermined level, the present invention can minimize the influence of a frequency offset on a high-mobility cell.</td>

[invention Title]<br>
METHOD FOR SETTING CYCLIC SHIFT CONSIDERING<br>
FREQUENCY OFFSET<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a sequence of a<br>
wireless communication system, and more particularly to a<br>
method for establishing a cyclic shift in consideration of<br>
characteristics of a CAZAC sequence in order to solve the<br>
problem of a frequency offset.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
A Constant Amplitude Zero Auto-Correlation (CAZAC)<br>
sequence is a representative one of various sequences<br>
which have been intensively discussed in the 3GPP LTE.<br>
Channels generally extract a variety of identifiers<br>
(IDs) or information using the CAZAC sequence, for example, synchronization channels (e.g., a primary-SCH, a secondary-SCH, and a BCH) for downlink synchronization,<br>
other synchronization channels (e.g., a RACK) for uplink synchronization, and pilot channels (e.g., a data pilot, and a channel quality pilot). Also, the above-mentioned<br>
CAZAC sequence has been used to perform the scrambling.<br><br>
Two kinds of methods have been used for the CAZAC<br>
sequence, i.e., a first method for changing a root index<br>
to another, and employing the changed root index, and a<br>
second method for performing a cyclic shift (CS) on a<br>
single root sequence, and employing the CS-result.<br>
If a current root index is changed to a new root<br>
index, a low cross-correlation occurs between the current<br>
root index and the new root index, however, there is no<br>
limitation in designing sequence usages.<br>
In the case of the cyclic shift, zero cross-<br>
correlation exists between the current root index and the<br>
new root index, so that the two root indexes are used<br>
when each of the root indexes require a high rejection<br>
ratio. Specifically, when time-frequency resources are<br>
shared in the same cell and data/control signals are<br>
transmitted, the above-mentioned two root indexes are<br>
adapted to discriminate among different signals or UEs.<br>
A representative example of CAZAC sequences is a<br>
Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence, and the Zadoff-Chu sequence can<br>
be defined by the following equation 1:<br><br><br><br>
where "n" is indicative of a sampling index, “Nzc”<br>
is indicative of the length of the ZC sequence, and "u" is<br>
indicative of the root index of the ZC sequence.'<br>
However, if the offset occurs in a frequency<br>
domain in the same manner as in the case where the CAZAC<br>
sequence is transmitted using the OFDM scheme, a<br>
performance or false alarm or throughput may be<br>
excessively deteriorated.<br>
Specifically, if the cyclic shift (CS) is applied<br>
to the CAZAC sequence, the frequency offset or the timing<br>
offset excessively occurs, so that it is difficult to<br>
discriminate between sequences.<br>
iDisclosurel<br>
[Technical Problem]<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a<br>
method for establishing a cyclic shift (CS) considering a<br>
frequency offset that substantially obviates one or more<br>
problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the<br>
related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
method for establishing a cyclic shift (CS) to provide<br><br>
against a frequency offset, so that it can easily prevent a<br>
sequence (e.g., a CAZAC sequence) from being deteriorated<br>
under the condition that the frequency offset occurs.<br>
Additional advantages, objects, and features of the<br>
invention will be set forth in part in the description<br>
which follows and in part will become apparent to those<br>
having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the<br>
following or may be learned from practice of the invention.<br>

The present invention provides a cyclic shift (CS)<br>
setup method to provide against the frequency offset, so<br>
that it can easily prevent a sequence (i.e., CA2AC<br>
sequence) performance from being deteriorated. For this<br>
purpose, the present invention will disclose the method for<br>
applying the cyclic shift to the CAZAC sequence, and the<br>
influence of the frequency offset of the CAZAC sequence.<br>
The cyclic shift may be applied to the CAZAC<br><br>
sequence according to two schemes, i.e., a first scheme for<br>
performing the cyclic shift on the sequence, and a method<br>
for multiplying an exponential function of other areas by a<br>
time- or frequency- domain sequence, and performing the<br>
cyclic shift on the multiplied result.<br>
The cyclic shift "d" is applied to the frequency<br>
index "k" in the frequency domain. If the sequence index<br>
of M and the N-length sequence is represented by c(k; d, M,<br>
N) , a method for performing the cyclic shift on the<br>
sequence can be represented by the following equation 2:<br>
[Equation 2]<br><br>
Where "M" is indicative of an amount of the cyclic<br>
shift, and "mod" is indicative of a modular operator.<br>
A method for applying the cyclic shift by<br>
multiplying an exponential function by the sequence can be<br>
represented by the following equation 3:<br>
[Equation 3]<br><br>
In the meantime, although each of the above<br><br>
Equations 2 and 3 shows an exemplary cyclic shift applied<br>
in the frequency domain, the cyclic shift may be applied in<br>
the time-domain sequence sampling index "n" in the time<br>
domain. In this case, an application example of the cyclic<br>
shift can be represented by the following equation 4:<br>
[Equation 4]<br><br>
where "Cv" is indicative of the degree of the cyclic<br>
shift, '"n" is indicative of a sampling index, “Nzc” is<br>
indicative of the ZC-sequence length, and "u" is indicative<br>
of an root index of the 2C sequence.<br>
The CAZAC sequences can be distinguished from each<br>
other under the condition that different root indexes are<br>
used, however, it should be noted that a difference in<br>
cross-correlation occurs among the CAZAC sequences.<br>
However, in the case of at least two CAZAC sequences<br>
associated with the cyclic shift, the cross-correlation<br>
value between the CAZAC sequences is zero, so that the<br>
above-mentioned CAZAC sequences are used when a high<br>
rejection ratio is required for the two CAZAC sequences.<br>
Specifically, the CAZAC sequence associated with the<br>
cyclic shift share the time-frequency resources within the<br><br>
same cell, so that they can be used to discriminate among<br>
different signals/UEs during the transmission of<br>
data/control signals.<br>
However, if the frequency offset occurs in the<br>
frequency domain in the same manner as in the case in which<br>
the CAZAC sequence is transmitted using the OFDM scheme,<br>
the present invention may encounter the excessive<br>
deterioration of a performance and false alarm rate.<br>
The following description will disclose an example<br>
in which the sequence is transmitted in the frequency<br>
domain, and another example in which the sequence is<br>
transmitted using the OFDM scheme.<br>
FIG. 1 is a conceptual diagram illustrating the<br>
influence of a frequency offset caused by a pulse shaping<br>
in a frequency domain when a sequence is mapped to a sub-<br>
carrier according to the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, each of sequence samples is<br>
mapped to the sub-carrier. If a reception end performs<br>
the signal sampling due to the frequency offset as<br>
denoted by the location of "Interference", signals of<br>
neighboring sub-carriers are mixed within a single sample.<br>
In other words, if the pulse-shaping function is p(x),<br>
the response of an arbitrary sub-carrier can be<br>
represented by the following equation 5:<br><br><br>
where "r(k, foff) " is indicative of a reception (Rx)-<br>
frequency response at the k-th sub-carrier location if the<br>
frequency offset is foff, "c(n)" is indicative of a CAZAC<br>
sequence mapped to the sub-carrier by the user equipment<br>
(UE), "p(f)" is indicative of a pulse-shaping function in a<br>
frequency domain, and ωo is indicative of a sub-carrier<br>
spacing.<br>
In the case of the above Equation 5 outputs<br>
only the value c(k). Otherwise, in the case of  the<br>
signal of the neighboring sub-carrier may enter the<br>
reception end, so that there arises a performance<br>
deterioration. Due to the performance deterioration caused<br>
by the frequency offset, the probability of encountering<br>
the detection error in the reception end increases, and the<br>
false alarm rate and/or miss-detection may unavoidably<br>
increase in the reception end.<br>
Specifically, provided that the cyclic shift is<br>
applied in the time domain and the CAZAC sequence is<br>
transmitted within the frequency domain, one may not<br><br>
discriminate among various sequences. And, the above-<br>
mentioned problem may occur in a situation, even when the<br>
CAZAC sequence is transmitted within the time domain as a<br>
form of the timing offset.<br>
In other words, if the frequency offset or the<br>
timing offset occurs, methods for employing the cyclic<br>
shift must unavoidably experience the performance<br>
deterioration. Also, the influence of the frequency offset<br>
is equally applied to a specific case in which the cyclic<br>
shift is applied in the time domain as denoted by Equation<br>
4.<br>
Therefore, there must be newly developed a<br>
technology for preventing a performance of the sequence<br>
(i.e., CAZAC sequence) from being deteriorated under the<br>
condition that the frequency offset occurs.<br>
Specifically, in the case of applying the cyclic<br>
shift to the CAZAC sequence, the frequency offset or the<br>
timing offset excessively occurs, so that the present<br>
invention has difficulty in discriminating among sequences<br>
when the frequency- or timing- offset occupies at least the<br>
half of a single sub-carrier spacing.<br>
However, the degree of the frequency offset and the<br>
degree of the Doppler shift may be different in individual<br>
cells of a cellular mobile communication system.<br><br>
Therefore, according to one embodiment, the present<br>
invention provides different cyclic shift (CS) setup<br>
methods according to the degree of frequency offsets of the<br>
individual cells, and a detailed description thereof will<br>
hereinafter be described.<br>
FIG. 2 is a conceptual diagram illustrating<br>
different frequency offset situations existing in a<br>
plurality of cells according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the present invention may<br>
determine that a specific cell having many high-mobility<br>
UEs in a cellular mobile communication system including<br>
many cells has a high frequency offset. There is every<br>
probability that a UE contained in a cell including<br>
residential districts may be a low-speed UE-, so that the<br>
frequency offset within the cell may be low.<br>
In more detail, FIG. 2 shows cells A and B adjacent<br>
to a high-speed railway, and the cell C distant from the<br>
high-speed railway.<br>
In the case of the cells A and B adjacent to the<br>
high-speed railway, there is every probability that a<br>
plurality of high-speed UEs are contained in a<br>
corresponding cell, so that the present invention has an<br>
advantage in that a sequence which is very resistant to<br>
the frequency offset may be allocated.<br><br>
For example, in the case of the cell C adjacent to<br>
the residential district distant from the high-speed<br>
railway, the probability of including the high-speed UE<br>
in a corresponding cell is relatively low, so that there<br>
is no need to allocate only the sequence which is very<br>
resistant to the frequency offset.<br>
In the case of the available sequence (e.g., the<br>
CAZAC sequence), first sequences caused by the root<br>
indexes of the individual sequences and second sequences<br>
caused by the cyclic shift applied to the first sequences<br>
may have different frequency offset characteristics.<br>
Therefore, the present invention establishes the<br>
restricted case and the unrestricted case, and provides<br>
the cyclic shift setup methods for the individual cases.<br>
The restricted case indicates that the influence of<br>
the Doppler shift is higher than a predetermined<br>
threshold value so that an unexpected limitation occurs<br>
in the process for establishing a cyclic shift (CS)<br>
applying interval.<br>
The unrestricted case indicates that the influence<br>
of the Doppler shift is equal to or less than the<br>
predetermined threshold value, so that there is no<br>
limitation in the process for establishing the CS-<br>
applying interval.<br><br>
The method for establishing the cyclic shift will<br>
hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
FIG. 3 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
sequence allocation method when a sequence is a CAZAC<br>
sequence according to the present invention.<br>
The CAZAC sequence may include a root sequence of<br>
each root CAZAC sequence and a Zero Correlation Zone<br>
(ZCZ) sequence to which different cyclic shifts (also<br>
called circular shifts) are applied.<br>
In more detail, FIG. 3 shows the root sequence for<br>
each root index in Nt root indexes, and the ZCZ-sequence<br>
set to which L cyclic shifts are applied to each root<br>
sequence.<br>
In this case, the ZCZ is indicative of a cyclic<br>
shift - applying interval to which the cyclic shift (CS)<br>
is applied, so that the Node-B is able to discriminate<br>
among RACH signals.<br>
In the meantime, if the CAZAC sequence is used when<br>
the frequency offset exists, the present invention may<br>
have difficulty in discriminating among ZCZ sequences by<br>
the frequency offset. Therefore, the present invention<br>
may determine that the ZCZ sequence is not used in a<br>
predetermined cell having a frequency offset of more than<br>
a predetermined level.<br><br>
In this way, the threshold value used to decide the<br>
degree of the frequency offset of each cell may be<br>
properly decided according to the number of available<br>
sequences of a corresponding system and the frequency<br>
offset degree of each cell.<br>
If it is determined that the cell has the frequency<br>
offset of more than the predetermined level, the<br>
probability of containing the high-speed UE in this cell<br>
is very high as shown in the cell A or B.<br>
However, if it is determined that the ZCZ sequence<br>
is not used in the cell having the frequency offset of<br>
more than the predetermined level, there may be only Nt<br>
indexes based on the CAZAC indexes, so that the number of<br>
available sequences becomes lower.<br>
If a sequence re-use coefficient becomes lower, one<br>
must allocate sequences according to the cell planning.<br>
However, this allocation based on the cell planning may<br>
unexpectedly increase the complexity in the process for<br>
allocating the sequences to individual cells, so that<br>
another solution may be additionally required on the<br>
condition that the number of available sequences<br>
encounters the problem.<br>
Furthermore, in case of using only Nt sequences and<br>
not using the ZCZ sequence, there may be a problem in<br>
estimating round trip delay or one-way trip delay while<br><br>
the performance of detecting sequence is enhanced. That<br>
is, there may be a problem of distinguishing the position<br>
of correlation peak varying due to the round trip delay<br>
or one-way trip delay, and a position of correlation peak<br>
varying due to the frequency offset. So, another solution<br>
may be additionally required against this problem.<br>
In the meantime, the above-mentioned problem having<br>
difficulty in discriminating among ZCZ sequences due to<br>
the frequency offset becomes intensified on the condition<br>
that the CAZAC index is very high or is not very low.<br>
In more detail, provided that "k" is indicative of<br>
a frequency-domain index, "N" is indicative of the CAZAC-<br>
sequence length, "M" is indicative of a CAZAC sequence,<br>
and a transmission (Tx) signal is indicative of<br>
"c(k,N,M)", a reception (Rx) signal can be represented by<br>
the following equation 6:<br>
[Equation 6]<br><br>
where "d" is indicative of the amount of a<br>
frequency-domain delay caused by the frequency offset.<br>
As can be seen from Equation 6, if the CAZAC index<br>
"M" has a very low value, or if the CAZAC index "M" has<br><br>
the highest value from among a total of Nt sequence<br>
indexes, the influence of the exponential function caused<br>
by the frequency offset is gradually reduced, so that the<br>
influence of the frequency offset in the Rx signal is<br>
gradually reduced.<br>
If the CAZAC sequence is allocated to the cell<br>
having the frequency offset of more than the<br>
predetermined level, the present invention may allocate<br>
only the root sequence. In the case of using the ZCZ<br>
CAZAC sequence due to the insufficient number of root<br>
sequences, the present invention may allow the CAZAC<br>
sequence to employ a specific sequence which is in an<br>
initial predetermined range or the last predetermined<br>
range from among total indexes. In this case, it should<br>
be noted that the term "predetermined range" can be<br>
established in different ways according to system<br>
detection performances.<br>
In the case of comparing the above-mentioned method<br>
with the other method for allowing the ZCZ sequence not<br>
to be used in the cell having the high frequency offset,<br>
the above-mentioned method increases categories or types<br>
of available sequences, so that there is almost no need<br>
to perform the cell planning.<br>
In more detail, if the number of total CAZAC<br>
sequences is Nt as shown in FIG. 3, the sequence to be<br><br>
used in the cell of the high frequency offset may be set<br>
to CAZAC indexes 0, 1, 2, Nt-2, Nt-1, and Nt.<br>
In the meantime, in the case of using the CAZAC<br>
sequence for the cell having the frequency offset of more<br>
than the predetermined level, there is no need to use<br>
only indexes other than the above-mentioned CAZAC indexes<br>
0, 1, 2, Nt-1, lSIt-2, and Nt. In order to reduce the<br>
interference between the aforementioned CAZAC sequence<br>
and the other sequence used for the cell having the high<br>
frequency offset, the present invention may not use the<br>
sequence index sued for the cell having the high<br>
frequency offset as necessary, resulting in the<br>
implementation of high efficiency.<br>
In the meantime, in the case of using the ZCZ<br>
sequence to guarantee the number of available sequences<br>
in the cell having the high frequency offset and/or to<br>
guarantee the performance of estimating the time delay<br>
occurred in the channel, the present invention<br>
establishes the cyclic shift interval in the restricted<br>
case in consideration of the alias (i.e., Doppler shift)<br>
caused by the frequency offset. As a result, the present<br>
invention prevents the performance deterioration caused<br>
by the frequency offset, and a detailed description<br>
thereof will hereinafter be described.<br><br>
If the presence of the frequency offset is decided,<br>
the frequency response of the Rx signal can be<br>
represented by the above Equation 6.<br>
In the meantime, Equation 6 shows that a signal<br>
value is transferred from all the neighboring sub-<br>
carriers due to the frequency offset. However, indeed, a<br>
specific component greatly affecting the channel response<br>
of the Rx signal may be set to a part located at both<br>
sides of a corresponding sub-carrier, wherein the part<br>
receives a signal of the neighboring sub-carrier.<br>
Therefore, in the case of considering only the<br>
first order case. Equation 6 may be represented by three<br>
terms, as shown in the following equation 7:<br>
[Equation 7]<br><br>
In the meantime, the reception end applies a<br>
conjugate complex number c(n) to the Rx signal, so that<br>
the applying result can be represented by the following<br>
equation 8:<br>
[Equation 8]<br><br><br>
The pulse-shaping function of Equation 7 can be<br>
easily denoted by a raised cosine- or sine- function.<br>
For the convenience of description, the pulse-<br>
shaping function is represented by constants  and<br>
With reference to Equation 8, the channel response<br>
of the Rx signal occurs at three points, i.e., "t"<br>
indicative of a target position in the time domain, "t-M"<br>
indicative of a position shifted to the left side, and<br>
"t+M" indicative of a position shifted to the right side.<br>
It can be recognized that the channel response generated<br>
at the M-shifted position on the basis of the right/left<br>
sides corresponds to the alias of the Rx signal, i.e.,<br>
the Doppler shift component having the 1-subcarrier<br>
spacing.<br>
The above-mentioned phenomenon in which the alias<br>
occurs in the channel response due to the frequency<br>
offset is shown in FIG. 4.<br>
FIG. 4 is a conceptual diagram illustrating aliases<br>
which occur in a time-domain channel response of a<br><br>
reception sequence due to the frequency offset according<br>
to the present invention.<br>
If the cyclic shift is applied to a sequence used<br>
in a specific cell having a frequency offset of more than<br>
a predetermined level, a single channel response occurs<br>
at the target position in the Rx-channel response of the<br>
corresponding sequence, and two additional aliases may<br>
occur in the Rx-channel response of the corresponding<br>
sequence according to the 1-subcarrier-spacing-sized<br>
Doppler shift.<br>
Therefore, if the CS-appIying interval is<br>
established irrespective of the target position and the<br>
alias positions, an unexpected overlapping occurs between<br>
the channel response and the alias of the Rx sequence due<br>
to the channel delay spreading and the propagation delay,<br>
so that the confusion between the target position and the<br>
alias position may occur among different CS-applying<br>
sequences.<br>
Accordingly, if the restricted case is decided when<br>
the CS-applying interval is established in the CAZAC<br>
sequence, the present invention considers the alias<br>
generated in the channel response, so that it establishes<br>
the CS-applying interval during a specific period in<br>
which the channel response of the Rx sequence does not<br>
overlap with the alias of the above channel response.<br><br>
FIG. 4 shows an exemplary case in which the M-sized<br>
(where M = sequence index) alias occurs when CAZAC<br>
sequence is generated in a frequency domain. However, if<br>
the CAZAC sequence is generated in the time domain, the<br>
alias generation position caused by the Doppler shift of<br>
the 1-subcarrier spacing may be determined in different<br>
ways.<br>
All the CS-applying cases used for the individual<br>
domains will hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
For the convenience of description and better<br>
understanding of the present invention, FIGS.. 5~11 assume<br>
that the cyclic shift unit is set to To-<br>
FIG. 5 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
method for establishing a new cyclic shift (CS)<br>
applying unit by adding an additional margin to ah old<br>
CS-applying unit according to the present invention.<br>
The present invention generates a cyclic-shifted<br>
preamble according to the design based on the RACH<br>
component. However, under the environment in which the<br>
OFDM frequency offset exists, the reception end of the<br>
present invention may easily mistake a normal sequence<br>
for another sequence.<br>
In order to prevent the above-mentioned problem<br>
from being generated, the present invention may use an<br>
additional cyclic shift margin as shown in FIG. 5.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the delay spread is indicative<br>
of a channel delay spread, and the round trip delay (RTD)<br>
is indicative of a propagation proceeding time of a<br>
physical distance between the user equipment (UE) and the<br>
Node-B. In the case of using the additional cyclic shift<br>
margin, the present invention adjusts the margin size for<br>
each sequence, so that it can reduce the influence of the<br>
frequency offset when the sequence is used.<br>
In the case of implementing the frequency offset<br>
using the additional margin, the cyclic shift unit is<br>
decided by the function of the CAZAC sequence. In other<br>
words, in association with the CAZAC sequence "M", the<br>
cyclic shift unit is represented by the following<br>
equation.9:	<br>
[Equation 9]<br><br>
where To is indicative of a common cyclic shift<br>
unit irrespective of the sequence index, and Tmargin (M) is<br>
indicative of an additional margin used when the sequence<br>
index is M. This margin can be decided by other methods<br>
according to usages of the sequence and the cyclic shift.<br><br>
Therefore, although it is preferable that the<br>
cyclic shift unit is at least 2M, this additional margin<br>
may be changed to another margin according to the CS-<br>
applying area. The above-mentioned situation is shown in<br>
FIGS. 6 and 7.<br>
FIGS. 6 and 7 are conceptual diagrams illustrating<br>
application examples of the additional margin of FIG. 5<br>
under the condition that a sequence index is low<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
Here, in case of Fig. 5, the interval of M due to<br>
the frequency offset is smaller than the cyclic shift<br>
interval of TO. Even when using this range, we can avoid<br>
the overlapping problem with other sequences. However,<br>
there may be a problem of estimating the information for<br>
the time delay of the transmitted sequence. So, in one<br>
embodiment of this invention, it is preferable not using<br>
this range where the interval of M due to the frequency<br>
offset is smaller than the cyclic shift interval of TQ.<br>
But, there may be a system using this range according to<br>
the requirement of the system.<br>
The oblique-lined part of FIGS. 6 and 7 indicates<br>
the cyclic shift opportunity.<br>
If the signal having no influence of the frequency<br>
offset is located at "t", the pulse affected by the<br>
frequency offset may occur at a single point of the left<br><br>
side, and may occur at a single point of the right side.<br>
If the signal includes To used as a basic cyclic shift<br>
unit, Tmargin{M) may be set to 2M.<br>
The additional margin is applied to all the indexes,<br>
so that the present invention may define the cyclic shift<br>
highly resistant to the frequency/timing offsets.<br>
However, the higher the sequence index, the higher<br>
the value of Tmargin(M).	As a result, the number of<br>
available cyclic shifts is reduced to "1". In order to<br>
prevent the reduction of the cyclic shifts, the present<br>
invention will disclose the case of the high CAZAC index in<br>
detail.<br>
FIGS. 8 and 9 are conceptual diagram illustrating<br>
exemplary additional margins of FIG. 5 under the<br>
condition that a sequence index is high according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
FIG. 8 shows the case in which the CAZAC index "M"<br>
is 2To~3To, and FIG. 9 shows the case in which the CAZAC<br>
index "M" is 3To~4To.	Although the case of FIG. 8<br>
considers the basic cyclic shift unit, the cyclic shift<br>
set denoted by the oblique-lined part may be additionally<br>
inserted in the intermediate space. The case of FIG. 9<br>
has a wider space, so that at least two cyclic shifts can<br>
be inserted into this wider space.<br><br>
FIG. 10 shows an example of a single group composed<br>
of P cyclic-shift sets according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, if the above-mentioned<br>
explanation is generalized, slots denoted by the oblique-<br>
lined parts are defined in the 3M range in which the<br>
block is constructed by pulses, and the M range is PTo~<br>
(P+l)To, it can be recognized that P cyclic-shift-sets are<br>
constructed.<br>
For the convenience of description, the 3M or 2M+<br>
PTo unit will hereinafter be referred to as a cyclic shift<br>
group. A specific sequence to which the cyclic shift is<br>
applied includes a predetermined number of cyclic shift<br>
groups. The predetermined number of cyclic shifts can be<br>
applied to each cyclic shift group, so that the<br>
predetermined number of cyclic shifts can be applied to<br>
the cyclic shift component caused by the Doppler shift.<br>
FIG. 11 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
method for establishing a cyclic shift (CS) - applying<br>
group and the CS-applying interval of each group<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, units of cyclic shift groups<br>
can be defined in total sequences, and each cyclic shift<br>
group can be defined as shown in FIG. 10. Provided that<br>
the number of cyclic shift groups is G and the number of<br>
cyclic shifts for each group is P, the total number of<br><br>
available cyclic shifts is P*G. As shown in FIG. 11,<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention, it<br>
is assumed that the sequence is divided into groups, and<br>
each group searches for a restricted available cyclic<br>
shift in each group.<br>
In the case of using the above-mentioned scheme,<br>
all the available cyclic shifts are defined in the index<br>
range in which the number of cyclic shift groups is "1".<br>
If the sequence length is N, this range having the<br>
sequence length of N corresponds to indexes ranging from<br>
1 ~ N/3 to 2N/3 ~ N-1. In this case, the k~th index has<br>
the same cyclic shift group as that of the (N-k)-th index<br>
and the cyclic shift set.<br>
FIG,"12 shows locations-at-which pulses occur by an<br>
interference when the CAZAC index is contained in the<br>
interval of N/3 ~ N/2 according to the present invention.<br>
A single square of FIG. 12 indicates the cyclic<br>
shift unit. If the CAZAC index is higher than "N/3", all<br>
the consecutive cyclic shift positions (i.e., the cyclic<br>
shift positions defined by To) cannot be used, and they<br>
can be used according to predetermined rules.<br>
A method for establishing the restricted cyclic<br>
shift set according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention will hereinafter be described."<br><br>
FIG. 13 is a flow chart illustrating a restricted<br>
cyclic shift set according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 13, if the restricted cyclic<br>
shift set is established in a cell having the frequency<br>
offset of more than a predetermined threshold value, the<br>
present invention provides a method for establishing the<br>
cyclic shift in consideration of the aliasing, so that<br>
there is no confusion between a desired channel response<br>
and this aliasing.<br>
For this purpose, as shown in step S1301 of FIG. 13,<br>
the present invention provides a distance “du” between the<br>
response generated by the Doppler shift and a desired<br>
channel- response using-a- -given sequence root index "u".<br>
In this case, the above distance corresponds to the<br>
cyclic shift generated by the Doppler shift corresponding<br>
to the 1-subcarrier spacing.<br>
A detailed description of the variable “du” will<br>
hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
FIG. 14 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
method for establishing a variable (du) of a cyclic shift<br>
corresponding to the Doppler shift associated with the 1-<br>
subcarrier spacing when the restricted cyclic shift set<br>
is established according to the present invention.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 14(a), if there is no influence<br>
of the Doppler frequency, the peak position generated by<br>
the correlation operation of the reception end is denoted<br>
by "1401". By the delay spread and the round trip delay<br>
(RTD) , the peak position at the reception end appears at<br>
the cyclic shift unit Ncs (1402) used as the cyclic shift<br>
unit basically decided by the system.<br>
In the meantime, in the case of the presence of the<br>
Doppler frequency corresponding to the 1-subcarrier<br>
spacing, the peak position caused by the correlation<br>
operation of the reception end is decided according to<br>
the sequence indexes.<br>
According to the present invention, the distance<br>
between the peak .position based on the Doppler shift<br>
corresponding to the 1-subcarrier spacing ≤ and the ideal<br>
peak position is called “du”.<br>
In other words, FIG. 14 (b) shows the shift of the<br>
reception-end channel response caused by the Doppler<br>
frequency - ≤ . FIG. 14(c) shows the shift of the<br>
reception-end channel response caused by the Doppler<br>
frequency	Based on the above-mentioned fact, the<br>
value “du” may be considered to be the cyclic shift caused<br>
by the Doppler shift.<br><br>
If the restricted cyclic shift is established in<br>
consideration of the cyclic shift corresponding to the<br>
Doppler shift of the 1-subcarrier spacing, the present<br>
invention controls the established restricted cyclic<br>
shift not to be overlapped with the channel response<br>
movement caused by the Doppler shift.<br>
The present invention excludes the reserved areas<br>
"reserved" .of FIGS. 14(a) and 14(b) from the established<br>
cyclic shift interval, so that it can prevent an<br>
unexpected confusion from being generated between channel<br>
responses although the relatively high Doppler shift has<br>
occurred.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 13, the present invention<br>
acquires secondary variables using the acquired variable<br>
“du” of the above step S1301 at step S1302. Namely, the<br>
present invention acquires the number (G) of cyclic shift<br>
groups, the number (P) of cyclic shifts applicable to<br>
each group, and the length (S) of each group from current<br>
sequences (e.g., ZC sequences).<br>
The above-mentioned secondary variables must be<br>
differently established according to sequence indexes,<br>
because the group length is changed to another according<br>
to the sequence indexes.	And, the variable “du” is<br>
dependent on the sequence index, so that the present<br><br>
invention provides a method for establishing secondary<br>
variables according to the range of the variable “du”.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention may apply not<br>
only the above group-based cyclic shift but also an<br>
additional cyclic shift using a specific area which is<br>
not contained in the cyclic shift group within the<br>
sequence range, and a detailed description thereof will<br>
hereinafter be described.<br>
Thereafter, at step S1303, the present invention<br>
establishes the cyclic shift using the acquired secondary<br>
variables of step S1302-<br>
The mathematical relationship between detailed<br>
variables for the cyclic shift application will be<br>
described in detail.<br>
The restricted cyclic shift according to the<br>
present invention has been proposed to prevent the high<br>
Doppler frequency effect from being generated.<br>
The other cyclic shift offset “Coff” different from<br>
the “du” variable will hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
The “Coff” value indicates the degree of an offset<br>
generated by the Doppler shift.<br>
If the offset degree generated by the Doppler shift<br>
is less than the half of the given sequence range, this<br>
offset degree may have the same meaning as that of the du<br>
variable. Otherwise, if the offset degree generated by<br><br>
the Doppler shift is equal to or higher than the half of<br>
the given sequence range, the resultant value acquired<br>
when the “Coff” value is subtracted from the total<br>
sequence length may correspond to the du variable.<br>
The “Coff” value is dependent on the root index of<br>
the used sequence. The preamble may be generated from<br>
either the time domain or the frequency domain. The<br>
relationship between "off" and "u" values is dependent on<br>
the domain generating the preamble.<br>
If the ZC sequence is generated from the frequency<br>
domain, and the cyclic shift is applied in the time<br>
domain, the present invention may induce the “Coff” value<br>
using the following method, and a detailed description<br>
thereof will hereinafter be described.<br>
It is assumed that the signal energy is propagated<br>
by the value transferred from the neighboring sub-carrier<br>
according to the Doppler frequency. And, it is assumed<br>
that the transferring from the neighboring carrier occurs<br>
at only the sub-carrier position spaced from a current<br>
sub-carrier by one blank, and this case is referred to as<br>
a first order case. In this case, the Rx signal at the<br>
specific sub-carrier is composed of three terms shown in<br>
the following equation 10:<br>
[Equation 10]<br><br><br>
Where, the pulse-shaping function "p(f)" may be<br>
denoted by a raised cosine- or sine- function. For the<br>
convenience of description, if constants   and c1<br>
are established, the s (n) value can be denoted by s(n) =<br>
  For the convenience of<br>
description, if the conjugate of the sequence is<br>
multiplied by the resultant value s(n) , the following<br>
equation 11 can be acquired:<br>
[Equation 11]<br><br>
+ cic(n+ l)c'(n)<br>
In Equation 11, if "c(n)=x(n)" is denoted by CAZAC,<br>
  can be represented by the following equation<br>
12:<br><br><br>
Here, "u" indicates the root index, and “Nzc”<br>
indicates the sequence length.<br>
If Equation 12 is applied to Equation 11, it can be<br>
recognized that "s (n)" is composed of three signals. A<br>
first term of the "s(n)" value is indicative of a simple<br>
DC component, a second term is indicative of a complex<br>
exponential wave having the frequency of u/Nzc, and a<br>
third term is indicative of a complex exponential wave<br>
having the frequency of -u/Nzc-<br>
Therefore, the “Coff” value can be represented by<br>
the following equation 13:<br>
[Equation 13]<br><br>
On the contrary, if the ZC sequence is generated<br>
from the time domain and the cyclic shift is generated<br>
from the time domain, the “Coff” value can be calculated<br>
by the following method.<br>
If the RACH preamble received without having the<br>
frequency offset is set to r(n), the RACH signal received<br>
along with the frequency offset can be represented by the<br>
following equation 14:<br>
[Equation 14]<br><br><br>
Where   is denoted by ,   and<br>
  indicates the frequency offset denoted by the hertz<br>
(Hz) unit, and fs is indicative of a sampling rate of the<br>
RACH preamble.<br>
The auto-correlation of the   value can be<br>
calculated by the equation wherein "u" is<br>
indicative of the index of the ZC sequence<br>
[Equation 15]<br><br>
In Equation 15, if "Coff,u" is indicative of the<br>
margin of a frequency offset, the auto-correlation of<br>
  can be calculated by  of the<br>
following equation 16:<br>
[Equation 16]<br><br><br>
In Equation 16, " () NZC" is indicative of a modular<br>
operation of the “Nzc” value. If Coff,u’=u * Coff,u is a root<br>
index related with the sampling shifts, and γ is<br>
indicative of a re-sampling ratio replying to the timing<br>
error, the Coff,u’ value can be denoted by <br><br>
By Equations 15 and 16, the γ value can be denoted<br>
by <br>
The channel response position is called a main lobe,<br>
and the alias response position of a channel affected by<br>
the (+/-) Doppler frequency is called a side lobe.<br>
In more detail, the main lobe is indicative of the<br>
position caused by the 0 offset, and is equal to a normal<br>
channel response position when there is no influence of<br>
the Doppler frequency.<br>
The positive ( + ) side lobe is indicative of the<br>
position caused by the positive ( + ) offset, and is equal<br>
to an alias response position affected by the positive<br>
{ + ) Doppler frequency.	The negative (-) side lobe is<br><br>
indicative of the position caused by the negative (-)<br>
offset, and is equal to an alias response position<br>
affected by the negative (-) Doppler frequency.<br>
As can be seen from Equation 16, it can be<br>
recognized that the main lobe of the auto-correlation<br>
peak occurs at Coff,u=0 or Coff,u’=0- By the above Equation<br>
15, the pair of side-lobes occurs under the condition of<br>
the following equation 17:<br>
[Equation 17]<br><br>
Therefore, the result of "u*Coff,u - m*Nzc" is equal<br>
to "-1", as represented by "Coff,u = (m*Nzc - l)/u". In this<br>
case, "m" is indicative of the lowest integer capable of<br>
allowing the Coft.u value to be an integer. For example, if<br>
the ZC-sequence length is 839 and the root index is 300,<br>
the "m" value is set to 59, and the Coff,u value is set to<br>
165.<br>
In the case of using the ZC sequence in the time<br>
domain, the Coff value can be defined by the following<br>
equation 18:<br>
[Equation 18]<br><br><br>
the index "u" of the CAZAC sequence, so that the Coff<br>
value can be acquired.<br>
Provided that the ZC sequence is used in the<br>
frequency or time area, and the conjugate property<br>
between the Coff and ZC sequences is used, the distance<br>
“du” between the main-lobe and the side-lobe can be<br>
represented by the following equation 21:<br>
[Equation 21]<br><br>
The present invention provides a variety of methods<br>
in establishing the restricted cyclic shifts, for example,<br>
a first method for establishing the restricted cyclic<br>
shift without using the fixed cyclic shift position, and<br>
a second method for establishing the restricted cyclic<br>
shift using the fixed cyclic shift position.<br>
The first method is associated with the restricted<br>
cyclic shift without considering the pre-defined shift<br>
position.	The second method is associated with the<br>
restricted cyclic shift with the consideration of the<br>
pre-defined shift position.<br><br>
In Equation 18, "m" is indicative of the smallest<br>
positive number capable of allowing the Coff value to be an<br>
integer, and “Nzc” is indicative of the ZC length.<br>
All the indexes "u" is a relative prime of the Nzc<br>
value. Therefore, the positive integer number (Uinv= 1/u)<br>
capable of satisfying the equation (u*Uinv== 1 mod Nzc)<br>
exists.	Therefore, the C≤ft.n value can be easily<br>
represented by the following equation 19:<br>
[Equation 19]<br><br>
In Equation 19, a negative sign (-) is the opposite<br>
of the positive sign ( + ) , so that it can be represented<br>
by the following equation 20:<br>
[Equation 20]<br><br>
In brief, if the CAZAC sequence is used in the<br>
frequency domain, the CAZAC- sequence index "u" becomes<br>
“Coff” without any change. . If the CAZAC sequence is used<br>
in the time domain, the "(1/u) mod Nzc" is performed on<br><br>
In regard to the first method, there are a variety<br>
of methods, i.e., a method for directly using the shift<br>
value of the Va-th restricted cyclic shift, and a method<br>
for establishing the cyclic shift interval using the<br>
shift value "Cva"- Namely, the cyclic-shifted sequence<br>
becomes Xu,v(n) =Xu** ( (n+Cva) mod Nzc) as shown in Equation 4.<br>
In regard to the first method, there aire a variety<br>
of methods employing a decimal "Va" for use in the cyclic<br>
shift, for example, a method for establishing the cyclic<br>
shift interval by calculating the shift-index decimal Va<br>
In other words, if the length of the cyclic shift<br>
is set to Ncs, the cyclic-shifted index becomes<br>
"Xu,va(n) =Xu( (n+round(VaNcs) ) mod Nzc)"-	In this case,<br>
"round" is indicative of a round-off function.<br>
In regard to the second method, there are a variety<br>
of methods employing the integer "Va" for use in the<br>
cyclic shift, for example, a method for establishing the<br>
cyclic shift interval by calculating the shift-index<br>
integer Va. Namely, the cyclic-shifted sequence becomes<br>
Xu,va(n)=Xu( (n+VaNcs) mod Nzc) •<br>
In the meantime, if the cyclic shift is performed<br>
by the multiple of Ncs, random access preambles, each of<br>
which has the zero correlation zone (ZCZ) area having no<br>
correlation in the u-th root ZC sequence, are defined by<br>
Xu,v(n)=Xu( (n+vNcs) mod Nzc) • This definition is appropriate<br><br>
for the low/middle cell having no problem in the high<br>
frequency offset. However, if the restricted cyclic shift<br>
is used in the high-mobility cell, the above-mentioned<br>
definition is inappropriate for the high-mobility cell.<br>
Specifically, the available "v" value is restricted, and<br>
the number of available ZCZ preambles is reduced to 1/3<br>
of the ZCZ preambles of a general case.<br>
Embodiments associated with the above-mentioned<br>
cases will hereinafter be described in detail.<br>
Best Mode<br>
This embodiment of the present invention will<br>
disclose a method for establishing the restricted cyclic<br>
shift using only the influence of the Doppler shift,<br>
without using the fixed cyclic shift position.<br>
The present invention assumes that the preamble is<br>
generated using the ZC sequence used as the CAZAC<br>
sequence.<br>
The “du” value of the following equation 22 shows a<br>
specific case in which the ZC sequence is generated in<br>
the frequency domain.<br><br><br>
In the case of generating the ZC sequence in the<br>
time domain, the “du” value can be represented by the<br>
following equation 23:<br>
[Equation 23]<br><br>
In Equation 23, "m" is indicative of the smallest<br>
positive number capable of allowing the “du” value to be<br>
an integer, and Nzc is indicative of the ZC length.<br>
Equation 23 can also be represented by the following<br>
equation 24:<br>
[Equation 24]<br><br>
Therefore, the v-th cyclic shift of the u-th root<br>
index can be defined by Xu,v (n) =Xu ( (n+Cv) mod Nzc)- In this<br>
case, if the general cyclic shift is decided, the Cv value<br>
can be represented by Cv = v*Ncs. If the restricted cyclic<br><br>
shift is decided, the Cv value can be represented by the<br>
following equation 25.<br>
[Equation 25]<br><br>
If the restricted cyclic shift having no pre-<br>
defined shift position is decided, this case is<br>
considered to be a first case (Case 1) , and a detailed<br>
description thereof will hereinafter be described.<br>
The u-th root ZC sequence and the v-th random<br>
access preamble, each of which has the zero correlation<br>
area, are defined by "Xu,v (n) =Xu ( (n+Cv) mod Nzc)"<br>
In this case, "Cv" is denoted by the above equation<br>
25.<br>
In other words, in the case of the unrestricted sets<br>
having a small amount of the Doppler-shift influence, the<br>
present invention may establish the cyclic shift<br>
corresponding to an integer multiple of Ncs equal to the<br>
basic cyclic shift unit.<br>
However, the case of the unrestricted sets less<br>
affected by the Doppler shift may establish the cyclic<br>
shift corresponding to the integer multiple of Ncs.<br><br>
In association with FIG. 13, the case of the<br>
restricted sets greatly affected by the Doppler shift may<br>
establish the number (G) of cyclic shift groups, the number<br>
(P) of cyclic shifts applicable to each cyclic shift group,<br>
and the number (R) of additional cyclic shifts.<br>
The method for calculating each secondary variable<br>
may be differently decided by the “du” range as previously<br>
stated in FIG. 13.<br>
During the alias distance interval of Ncs≤du
the number of cyclic shifts per group is denoted by<br>
  , and there are  groups, each of<br>
which has the length  , and the number of<br>
restricted additional cyclic shifts is denoted by<br><br>
During	the	alias	distance	interval	of<br>
  the number of cyclic shifts per<br>
group is denoted by  , and there are G<br>
  groups, each of which has the length<br>
  , and the number of restricted<br><br>
additional	cyclic	shifts	is	denoted	by<br><br>
The principles for calculating the above-mentioned<br>
secondary variables will hereinafter be described in<br>
detail.<br><br>
FIG. 15 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
specific case in which the variable (du) is less than a<br>
basic unit Ncs to which the cyclic shift (CS) is applied<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
The cyclic shift unit (Ncs) is designed in<br>
consideration of the delay spread and the RTD which are<br>
capable of being generated in the channel. Therefore, if<br>
du is less than Ncs, a peak caused by the delay spread<br>
and/or the RTD within the Ncs range may overlap with the<br>
other peak caused by the Doppler shift, as shown in FIG.<br>
15. Therefore, when establishing the restricted cyclic<br>
shift, this embodiment does not establish the cyclic<br>
shift for the case in which the du value is less than the<br>
Ncs value.<br><br><br>
FIG. 16 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
method for calculating a variable establishing the cyclic<br>
shift within the interval of Ncs ≤ du 
the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 16, the cyclic shift area generated<br>
by the Doppler frequency occurs in the interval of Ncs ≤ du<br>
the range of a sequence length located at both sides of the<br>
intended cyclic shift.<br>
According to this embodiment, the cyclic shift areas<br>
caused by the Doppler frequency of both sides of the cyclic<br>
shift may be grouped into a single group. Also, the<br>
present invention determines how many Ncs values can be<br>
used without overlapping with others within the “du” range.<br>
The number of restricted cyclic shifts available for each<br>
group may be set to P. Namely, the P value can be<br>
calculated by the following equation 26:<br><br>
The distance between a specific channel response<br>
1601 and the alias 1601a caused by the Doppler shift is<br>
denoted by “du”. The distance between the specific channel<br><br>
response 1601 and the other alias 1601b caused by the<br>
Doppler shift is denoted by “du”.<br>
If the P cyclic shifts are applied to each group,<br>
aliases generated in the left area on the basis of the<br>
channel response 1601 are contained in the du range, and<br>
other aliases generated in the right area on the basis of<br>
the channel response 1601 may exist outside of the du range.<br>
In this case, in the case of considering all the<br>
aliasing operations of P channel responses generated in the<br>
right area, a corresponding length corresponds to P • Ncs<br>
(1602) .<br>
Therefore, the length (S) of a single cyclic shift<br>
group may be equal to the sum of the “du” length and the<br>
"P " Ncs" length, and is represented by the following<br>
equation 27:<br>
[Equation 27]<br><br>
In the meantime, the number of cyclic shift groups<br>
in total sequences may be calculated by dividing the total<br>
sequence length (Nzc) by the group length (S) , and can be<br>
represented by the following equation 28:<br><br>
[Equation 28]<br><br>
In the meantime, as shown in FIG. 16, a specific<br>
area 1603 less- than the group length (S) may be left. The<br>
length of the "1603" area corresponds to "Nzc - G • S",<br>
where Nzc is the length of an overall sequence, G is the<br>
number of groups, and S is the group length.<br>
If Nzc - G • S -2du is higher than Ncs, the additional<br>
cyclic shift may also be applied to the above-mentioned<br>
area 1603, and a detailed description thereof is shown at<br>
the "1604" area of FIG. 16. Therefore, provided that the<br>
number of cyclic shifts which are not based on the cyclic<br>
shift group is R, the R value can be represented by the<br>
following equation 29:<br><br><br>
FIG. 17 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a<br>
method for calculating a variable establishing the cyclic<br><br>
shift within the interval of (Nzc/3) ≤ du 
according to the present invention.<br>
In the area of (Nzc/3) ≤du, differently from the<br>
above-mentioned (2) case (i.e., the aforementioned (2) case<br>
of Ncs ≤ du 
the aliasing caused by the Doppler shift exceed the total<br>
sequence length Nzc, so that the aliasing may occur between<br>
the channel response of the ideal case and the du range.<br>
For example, the peak located at the "1701" position<br>
of FIG. 17 the aliasing may occur at positions 1701a and<br>
1701b by the (+/-) Doppler shift. Therefore, the number of<br>
cyclic shifts applicable to a single cyclic shift group in<br>
this (3) case is decided by the "Nzc-2du" area (1702)<br>
located at the center of FIG. 17, so that the number P of<br>
restricted cyclic shifts applicable to each group can be<br>
calculated by the following equation 30:<br>
[Equation 30]<br><br>
In this (3) case, the length S of each cyclic shift<br>
group can be represented by the following equation 31:<br>
[Equation 31]<br><br><br>
The variable S is equal to the sum of the length of<br>
the 1702 area (Nzc-2du) and the length of the 1703 area<br>
corresponding to the "P • Ncs" length. The "P • Ncs" length<br>
is variable with the number of cyclic shifts applicable to<br>
each real group located at the right side<br>
In the meantime, the above-mentioned (3) case<br>
determines the number of cyclic shift groups in a given ZC<br>
sequence by considering how many lengths (S, where S = the<br>
length of a specific group) will be permitted in the du<br>
range (1704), whereas the above-mentioned (2) case has<br>
determined the number of cyclic shift groups in such a<br>
given ZC sequence by considering how many lengths (S) will<br>
be permitted in the total sequence length Nzc.<br>
The spacing between a specific channel response and<br>
two aliases of this channel response exceeds the total<br>
sequence range, so that the present invention controls the<br>
individual aliases not to overlap with each other within<br>
the du range. The number of cyclic shift groups can be<br>
represented by the following equation 32:<br>
[Equation 32]<br><br><br>
Finally, the cyclic shift group is established in<br>
the du range (1704) as described above, and the 1705 area<br>
having the length shorter" than that of the cyclic shift<br>
group may be left.	This length of the 1705 area<br>
corresponds to "du - G • S". If the length of the 1705 area<br>
is longer than Ncs, the additional cyclic shift may be<br>
applied to this length.<br>
Therefore, the number R of additional cyclic shifts<br>
can be represented by <br>
If the length (S) of each cyclic shift group is<br>
higher than "P", the additional cyclic shifts corresponding<br>
to the number of more than "P" may overlap with the ( + /-)<br>
aliasing area in the right area.	Therefore, this<br>
embodiment may indicate the number R of additional cyclic<br>
shifts as shown in the following equation 33:<br>
[Equation 33]<br><br><br>
Referring to FIG. 17, the Nzc-2du area (1702) located<br>
at the center part must be larger than Ncs, so that the<br>
cyclic shift can be applied to each group. Namely, this<br>
requirement can be represented by Nzc-Zdu &gt; Ncs-<br>
If the above-mentioned requirement is represented in<br>
different ways on the basis of the du value, it can be<br>
recognized that the equation Nzc-Ncs &gt; 2du (i.e., (Nzc-Ncs)/2<br>
&gt;du) must be satisfied.	Therefore, this em≤bodiment does<br>
not establish the restricted cyclic shift in the range of<br>
(Nzc - Ncs)/2 ≤du.<br>
Based on the above-mentioned explanation of the<br>
individual intervals, a detailed description of only the<br>
restricted set contained in Equation 25 will hereinafter be<br>
disclosed. Firstly, the restricted set of Equation 25 can<br>
be represented by the following equation 34.<br>
[Equation 34]<br><br>
The individual terms for use in the above cyclic<br>
shift will hereinafter be described.<br>
In Equation 34,   is indicative of a<br>
start point of each cyclic shift group. If the V value is<br><br>
less than the number P of cyclic shifts for each group,<br>
  is indicative of "0". If the " value is<br>
higher than the number P of cyclic shifts for each group<br>
and is less than "2P",  is indicative of "S"<br>
corresponding to the length of a single cyclic shift group.<br>
If the " value is higher than "2P" and is less than<br>
3P,   is indicative of "2S" corresponding to<br>
the length of two cyclic shift groups.<br>
  is indicative of the position<br>
of the cyclic shift applied to each group (or the position<br>
of an additional cyclic shift). In other words, the '<br>
value is shifted to another position by a predetermined<br>
distance Ncs at intervals of the P time.<br>
The V value of Equation 34 (or Equation 25 including<br>
Equation 34) does not discriminate between the groups or<br>
components of the groups, and is indicative of the total<br>
number of cyclic shifts. As a result, the total number of<br>
cyclic shifts can be represented by <br>
Modified Examples<br><br>
A variety of modified examples applicable to the<br>
present invention will hereinafter be described.<br>
Although the above-mentioned best mode has disclosed<br>
the specific case in which there is no restriction in the<br>
start point of the cyclic shift, the present invention can<br>
be applied to not only the above-mentioned case but also<br>
other restricted cases.<br>
Not only the above-mentioned best mode, but also all<br>
the embodiments capable of being more generally applied to<br>
the present invention will hereinafter be described.<br>
The position at which the alias occurs by the { + )<br>
Doppler frequency is denoted by the "+offset" position, and<br>
the position at the alias occurs by the (-) Doppler<br>
frequency is denoted by "-offset" position.<br>
FIGS. 18 and 19 are conceptual diagrams illustrating<br>
a method for reducing the number of ZCZ preamble sequences<br>
due to an alias response in the case of Nzc=839, Ncs=100,<br>
and du=155 according to the present invention.<br>
The cyclic shift of FIG. 18 can begin at any<br>
position. The cyclic shift of FIG. 19 can be performed at<br>
only the Ncs-multiple position. The Ncs value of FIG. 18 is<br>
equal to that of FIG. 19, however, start positions of the<br>
individual cyclic shifts are different in FIGS. 18 and 19.<br>
In conclusion, the case of FIG. 18 can construct<br>
many more cyclic shifts than those of FIG. 19. In more<br><br>
detail, the case of FIG. 18 eliminates the restriction of<br>
the start position of the cyclic shift, so that it can<br>
acquire the additional restricted cyclic shift.<br>
FIG. 20 is a conceptual diagram illustrating the<br>
increasing ratio of an available restricted cyclic shift<br>
after the restriction of a start location of the cyclic<br>
shift is removed in the case of Nzc=839 according to the<br>
present invention;<br>
The elimination of the restriction in the cyclic<br>
shift starting may not increase the hardware complexity.<br>
Therefore, the restricted cyclic shift having no<br>
consideration in the pre-defined shift position is<br>
preferred, and the above-mentioned best mode is<br>
established under the aforementioned assumption.<br>
However, the present invention can also be applied<br>
to the restricted cyclic shift having the pre-defined<br>
shift position, so that the following description will<br>
disclose the above-mentioned two cases.<br>
Firstly, the restricted cyclic shift case (i.e..<br>
Case 1) having no consideration in the pre-defined shift<br>
position will hereinafter be described.<br>
Equation 21 indicates the alias distance,<br>
irrespective of the preamble generation domain.	The<br>
number of restricted available cyclic shifts per root ZC<br>
sequence is differently decided according to the root<br><br>
index and the Ncs value, so that different equations for<br>
use in different alias-distance ranges are required.<br>
Specificall, there are two alias-distance ranges in<br>
which there is no discrimination between alias responses.<br>
The range in which the restricted cyclic shift can be<br>
used is set to Ncs≤du≤ (Nzc-Ncs)/2. In this range, the<br>
cyclic shift range and two alias ranges are not<br>
overlapped with each other.<br>
In this case, if the preamble is generated in the<br>
frequency domain, the “du” value is set to "u" as denoted<br>
by du = u. If the preamble is generated in the time<br>
domain, the “du” value is set to "1/u mod Nzc" as denoted<br>
by du = 1/u mod Nzc. The number of restricted cyclic<br>
shifts can be represented by the following equation 35:<br>
[Equation 35]<br><br>
In Equation 35, "P" is indicative of the number of<br>
restricted cyclic shifts per group, "G" is indicative of<br>
the number of groups generated in a single preamble<br>
sequence, and "R" is indicative of the number of<br>
restricted additional cyclic shifts which is not based on<br>
the additional group.<br><br>
The available range of the restricted cyclic shift<br>
is denoted by Ncs≤du≤ (Nzc-Ncs)/2.	This interval<br>
"Ncs<du can be divided into></du>
and "(Nzc/3)≤du≤(Nzc-Ncs)/2" on the basis of Nzc/3.<br>
The reason why the alias-distance range is divided<br>
into "Ncs<du and on the></du>
basis of Nzc/3 has already been disclosed.<br>
Therefore, "Ncs≤du≤≤ (Nzc-Ncs)/2" is differently<br>
decided on the basis of "Nzc/3".	The range of<br>
Ncs≤du
hereinafter be described.<br>
If the start position of the first group is set to<br>
"0", the Vg-th restricted cyclic shift range is defined by<br>
[Cva, start* Cva, end ] in Equations 36 and 37.<br>
The alias occurs at the positions of the following<br>

In Equation 39, " () NZC" is indicative of a modular<br>
operation.<br>
Firstly, the alias-distance range Ncs≤du
(i.e., the alias-distance range 1) has  number of<br>
groups. Each group includes number of restricted<br>
cyclic shifts. The length of each group is denoted by<br>
  If the available additional cyclic shift<br>
is a positive(+) number, the R value is denoted by<br><br>
FIG. 21 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an<br>
exemplary cyclic shift in the case of Nzc=839, Ncs=40, and<br>
du=150 according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Each group has three cyclic shifts, and two<br><br>
additional cyclic shifts exist in the remaining ranges.<br>
In this example, the total number of restricted cyclic<br>
shifts is "5".<br>
According to one embodiment, the present invention<br>
applies the number of calculated groups, the number of<br>
restricted cyclic shifts per group, and the group length<br>
to Equations 36 and 37, and then establishes the cyclic<br>
shift-applying interval in consideration of the above-<br>
mentioned parameters.<br>
Next, in the alias-distance range (Nzc/3) ≤du≤ (Nzc-<br>
Ncs)/2 (i.e., the alias-distance range 2), the number of<br>
available cyclic shifts per group is denoted by<br>
  the length of each group is denoted by<br>
  and there are G groups (where<br><br>
The additional cyclic shift is selected from among<br>
the center part and the residual part of the right side.<br>
In this case, the selected cyclic shifts should be the<br>
smallest number of cyclic shifts. Namely, if the R value<br>
is a positive number, the number of additional cyclic<br>
shifts is denoted by  The start<br>
position of the Va-th restricted cyclic shift is calculated<br><br>
by applying the above-mentioned parameters to Equations 36<br>
and 37.<br>
FIG. 22 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an<br>
exemplary cyclic shift in the case of Nzc=839, Ncs=40, and<br>
du=399 according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Each group<br>
There are four groups, each of which has a single<br>
cyclic shift and a single additional cyclic shift. In<br>
this example, the total number of restricted cyclic<br>
shifts is 5.<br>
According to this embodiment, the present invention<br>
applies the number of calculated groups, the number of<br>
restricted cyclic shifts per group, and the group length<br>
to Equations 36 and 37, and then establishes the cyclic<br>
shift-applying interval in consideration of the above-<br>
mentioned parameters.<br>
Indeed, the equal sing (=) between two alias<br>
distance ranges may have no meaning or the relatively-low<br>
importance. For example, in the case of using the ZC<br>
sequence having the length of 839, the (Nzc/3) value is<br>
equal to 279.67 (i.e., (Nzc/3)=279.67), so that the<br>
divided ranges Ncs<du and></du>
may have the same results as those of the divided ranges<br>
Ncs≤du≤ {Nzc/3) and (Nzc/3)<du></du><br>
Next, the restricted cyclic shift (i.e., Case 2)<br>
considering the pre-defined shift position will hereinafter<br>
be described.<br>
A method for generating the restricted cyclic shift<br>
using the pre-defined shift position is changed to another<br>
method. Each alias-distance range includes not only G<br>
groups, each of which has P cyclic shifts, but also a first<br>
additional cyclic shift out of the R1 groups.<br>
In the case of using the pre-defined shift position,<br>
the present invention has a particular additional cyclic<br>
shift, differently from the other case in which no pre-<br>
defined shift position exists in the alias-distance range<br>
2-area.<br>
In the alias-distance range 2-area, the main region<br>
generally appears in the front samples of the sequence, and<br>
the alias regions generally appear in the rear samples of<br>
the sequence. However, according to the Case 2, the main<br>
region appears in the rear samples of the sequence, and the<br>
alias regions appear in the front samples of the sequence.<br>
The second additional cyclic shift is denoted by R2.<br>
The second additional cyclic shift does not appear in the<br>
alias-distance range 1. The total number of restricted<br>
cyclic shifts can be represented by the following equation<br>
40:<br><br>
[Equation 40]<br><br>
Provided that the start position of the first group<br>
is "0", the Va-th restricted cyclic shift is defined in [Cva,<br>
startf Cva, end ] as denoted by Equations 41 and 42:<br>
[Equation 41]<br><br>
[Equation 42]<br><br>
The related alias occurs at positions of the<br>
following equations 43 and 44:<br>
[Equation 43]<br><br><br><br>
In Equations 4 3 and 44, ()NZC is indicative of a<br>
modular operation.<br>
In the alias-distance range Ncs≤du

exists, P restricted cyclic shifts (where, <br>
exists, and the group length is denoted by<br>
  If the R1 value is a positive ( + )<br>
number, the number of the first additional cyclic shifts is<br>
denoted by <br>
FIG. 23 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an<br>
exemplary cyclic shift in the case of N2c=839, Ncs=40, and<br>
du=l50 according to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In FIG. 23, each group includes three cyclic<br>
shifts and two cyclic shifts. In this example, the total<br>
number of restricted cyclic shifts is "5".<br>
According to this embodiment, the present invention<br>
 applies the number of calculated groups, the number of<br>
restricted cyclic shifts per group, and the group length<br>
to Equations 41 and 42, and then establishes the cyclic<br><br>
shift-applying interval in consideration of the above-<br>
mentioned parameters.<br>
Next, in the alias-distance range (Nzc/3) ≤du≤ (Nzc-<br>
Ncs)/2 (i.e., the alias-distance range 2), the number of<br>
available cyclic shifts per group is denoted by<br>
  the length of each group is denoted by<br>
  and there are G groups<br>
(where <br>
The first additional cyclic shift is calculated by<br>
the same method as that of the alias-distance range 1. If<br>
the R1 value is a positive number, the number of first<br>
additional	cyclic	shifts	is	denoted	by<br><br>
If the R1 value is equal to "0" (i.e., R1=0) , the<br>
presence or absence of a second additional cyclic shift<br>
must be determined. The shape of the second additional<br>
cyclic shift is the opposite of the shape of the<br>
conventional cyclic shift, as shown in the last cyclic<br>
shift of FIG. 23.<br>
The present invention determines whether the alias<br>
range of the second additional cyclic shift is an available<br>
range   and<br><br>
determines whether the cyclic shift interval is available<br>
(i.e.,  If it is determined that the cyclic<br>
shift interval is available (i.e., <br>
FIG. 24 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an<br>
exemplary cyclic shift in the case of Nzc=839, Ncs=40, and<br>
du=399 according to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In FIG. 24, each group includes three cyclic<br>
shifts and no first additional cyclic shift (i.e., zero<br>
first additional cyclic shift). And, each group further<br>
includes a single additional cyclic shift in which a<br>
relative position of the main region is opposite to that<br>
of. the alias region. This second additional cyclic shift<br>
does not occur when the fixed cyclic shift position is<br>
not used, as shown in FIG. 22, In this example, the<br>
number of total restricted cyclic shifts is "4".<br>
According to this embodiment, the present invention<br>
applies the number of calculated groups, the number of<br>
restricted cyclic shifts per group, and the group length<br>
to Equations 41 and 42, and then establishes the cyclic<br>
shift-applying interval in consideration of the above-<br>
mentioned parameters.<br>
According to another embodiment, a specific system<br>
with the fixed cyclic shift may determine the cyclic shift<br><br>
according to the following method.<br>
Firstly, the total sequence range is divided by the<br>
cyclic shift value.<br>
Next, the present invention searches for the range<br>
{±u or +(m*Nzc-l)/u) in which the interference caused by<br>
the offset occurs in the first range (i.e., n=l). In this<br>
case, there are a plurality of ranges, each of which has<br>
the interference.<br>
For example, in the case of considering only the<br>
first interference, a maximum number- of interference<br>
generation ranges may be set to "4".<br>
Next, if the first range is not overlapped with all<br>
of the interference ranges caused by the offset, the first<br>
range is set to an available range, and the remaining<br>
ranges caused by the offset is set to a restricted range<br>
(also called a prohibition range) .<br>
The present invention goes to the next range (i.e.,<br>
n=n+l), and repeatedly searches for the range in which the<br>
interference is generated by the offset.<br>
While the present invention searches for the<br>
interference generation range in the n-th range, if an<br>
observation range, several ranges caused by the offset, an<br>
pre-established available range, and pre-established<br>
prohibition ranges are not overlapped with each other, the<br>
present invention determines a current range to be an<br><br>
available range, and determines the above several ranges<br>
caused by the offset associated with the current range to<br>
be prohibition ranges. If the above-mentioned process is<br>
repeated until reaching the last range, the present<br>
invention may determine the cyclic shift in the system<br>
including the fixed cyclic shift.<br>
According to still another embodiment, the present<br>
invention may apply the aforementioned established cyclic<br>
shift - applying interval to only the high-mobility cell in<br>
a mobile communication system including several cells.<br>
In this case, the present invention may determine<br>
whether a corresponding cell has the high mobility by<br>
determining whether the frequency offset associated with<br>
the cell is higher than a predetermined level after<br>
acquiring the cell information.	In this case, the<br>
predetermined level is indicative of a frequency offset<br>
value, which can be readily decided or modified by those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Preferably, the present invention may control the<br>
Node-B or the UE to determine whether the corresponding<br>
cell is the high-mobility cell. However, the UE has<br>
difficulty in estimating the frequency offset value of each<br>
of other UEs contained in the cell. Therefore, it is more<br>
preferable that the Node-B determines whether the<br>
corresponding cell is the high-mobility cell in<br><br>
consideration of several UEs of the cell, and broadcasts<br>
the resultant signal over the broadcast channel.<br>
In the meantime, if it is determined that the<br>
corresponding cell is not indicative of the high-mobility<br>
cell, the present invention may include a process for<br>
allocating a sequence unallocated to the high-mobility cell.<br>

modified into others under the same condition as that of<br>

In the restricted cyclic shift case of<br>

shift value of the v-th restricted cyclic shift has been<br>
disclosed. Differently from the method, another method for<br>
employing the Va value for Va-th restricted cyclic shift so<br>
that the restricted cyclic shift can be applied to the<br>
present invention. In more detail, the similar cyclic<br>
shift can be generated using the equation of<br><br><br>
In the case of generating the cyclic shift using the<br>
above-mentioned method, the basic concept is equal to those<br>
of the above-mentioned methods.	However, different<br>
equations are applied to the above-mentioned methods.<br>
The case (Case 1) of the restricted cyclic shift<br>
having no consideration in the pre-defined shift position<br>

may define the cyclic shift set capable of removing the<br>
shift ambiguity caused by the frequency- or timing- offset.<br>

channel, the frequency offset or the timing offset is not<br><br>
adjusted to this unsynchronized channel, so that the<br>
present invention can increase the strength of this channel.<br>

It should be noted that most terminology disclosed<br>
in the present invention is defined in consideration of<br>

various modifications and variations can be made in the<br>
present invention without departing from the spirit or<br>
scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the<br>
present invention cover the modifications and variations of<br>
this invention provided they come within the scope of the<br>
appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
[industrial Applicability!<br>
As apparent from the above description, the present<br>
invention can easily establish a cyclic shift (CS) interval<br><br>
at a specific location having no overlapping by considering<br>
a channel response of a reception (Rx) sequence and an<br>
alias location of this reception (Rx) sequence, although a<br>
reception (Rx) signal is shifted by a channel delay<br>
spreading or a propagation delay irrespective of categories<br>
of a domain generating a sequence, so that it can greatly<br>
reduce the number of the detection errors and the false<br>
alarm rate.<br>
And, if a sequence of the cyclic shift (CS) is<br>
allocated to a cell having a frequency offset of more than<br>
a predetermined level, the present invention can minimize<br>
the influence of a frequency offset on a high-mobility cell.<br>
The present invention relates to a first method for<br>
allocating a sequence to each cell in consideration of<br>
characteristics of the CAZAC sequence, and a second method<br>
for establishing the cyclic shift to be applied to the<br>
first method. Therefore, the present invention can be<br>
applied to a wireless communication system (e.g., a UE and<br>
a Node-B).<br>

invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes,<br>
those skilled in the art will appreciate that various<br>

range of the first variable (du), and the range of the<br>
first variable is divided by a criteria corresponding to<br>
1/3 of the given sequence length (N2c/3).<br>
[claim 22] The method according to claim 21, wherein:<br>
if the range of the first variable (du) is Ncs ≤ du 
(Nzc/3), the secondary variables are acquired by equations<br>
of.<br><br><br><br>
wherein "Ncs" is a predetermined- cyclic shift parameter,<br>
"P" corresponds to the number of cyclic shift per the group,<br>
"S" corresponds to the length of the each group, "G"<br>
corresponds to the number of group and ≤'R" corresponds to<br>
the number of additional cyclic shifts.<br>
[Claim 23] The method according to claim 21, wherein:<br>
if the range of the first variable (du) is (Nzc/3)≤ du≤<br>
(N2C-Ncs)/2, the secondary variables are acquired by<br>
equations of,<br><br>
wherein "Ncs" is a predetermined cyclic shift parameter,<br>
"P" corresponds to the number of cyclic shift per the group,<br>
"S" corresponds to the length of the each group, "G"<br>
corresponds to the number of group and "R" corresponds to<br>
the number of additional cyclic shifts.<br>
[claim 24] The method according to claim 22 or 23, <br><br>
wherein the cyclic shift   is performed as following<br>
equation,<br><br>
A method for establishing a cyclic shift sequence to provide against the frequency offset is disclosed. The method calculates a distance between a channel response position of the sequence and an alias channel response position caused by a frequency offset, calculates the number of cyclic shifts per group according to the calculated distance, and establishes the cyclic shift (CS)- applying interval. This method easily establishes a cyclic shift (CS) interval at a specific location having no overlapping by considering a channel response of a reception (Rx) sequence and an alias location of this reception (Rx) sequence, although a reception (Rx) signal is shifted by a channel delay spreading or a propagation delay irrespective of categories of a domain generating a sequence, so that it can greatly reduce the number of the detection errors and the false alarm rate. And, if a sequence of the cyclic shift (CS) is allocated to a cell having a frequency offset of more than a predetermined level, the present invention can minimize the<br>
influence of a frequency offset on a high-mobility cell.</td>
