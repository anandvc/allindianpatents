23-2-2007<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED:-<br><br>
- 4 APR 2005<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an antitussive composition and method of making the same.<br>
In particular, this invention relates to a process for making an oral dosage composition in the tablet form containing Prenoxdiazine Hydrochloride<br>
In particular this invention envisages a film coated tablet formulation for oral administration containing Prenoxdiazine Hydrochloride.<br>
Therapeutic effective amount of Prenoxdiazine used in the formulation is preferably as Prenoxdiazine Hydrochloride or any pharmaceutically acceptable form of it.<br>
Drugs used for treatment of cough can be classified as follows: Cough Suppressants, Expectorants and Mucolytics.<br>
Cough is characterized by forced expiration against a closed glottis, which suddenly opens to expel air and any unwanted material from respiratory tract. The treatment on cough depends upon whether the cough is productive or non¬productive.<br>
A productive cough is characterized by presence of sputum and may be associated with conditions such as chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, or cystic fibrosis. Expectorants are used for treatment of productive cough.<br>
2<br><br>
A non- productive cough may be considered as serving no useful purpose for the patient. For example the symptoms of common cold may often include a non¬productive cough and cough suppressants may provide some relief to the patients particularly if administered at night. It has a few side effects as compared to codeine.<br>
Prenoxdiazine Hydrochloride is used as a peripherally acting cough suppressant for non-productive cough. Prenoxdiazine Hybenzate is also used for this purpose. It does not depress respiratory center and can be given safely to elderly patients.<br>
The active material in the formulation can be formulated within a dosage form wherein it is mixed along with excipients to form an uniform blend and thereafter bound with suitable binder to form granules of the mixed active blend or at least one of the active drug can be coated with a suitable polymer for obtaining two different granular mass of each drug.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main feature of this invention is the use of the active ingredient for making the oral dosage form of the formulation prenoxdiazine hydrochloride in a single dosage form.

40#<br>
Transfer into bowl of planetary mixer.<br>
3.Dry Mixing:<br>

4.Preparation of binder slurry by dispersing / dissolving the binder in solvent.<br>
5.Wet Mixing:<br>
Add slurry to the contents of the planetary mixer, gradually with continuous stirring, check consistency and binding .If necessary additional wetting can be imparted using solvent.<br>
6.Wet Milling:<br>

sieve (knives forward medium speed)<br>
7.Drying:<br>
Dry the granules in F.B.D/Tray drier at 50 °C. Rake the granules occasionally<br>
while drying in tray drier. Record temp, time, loss on drying.<br>
In-Process control:<br>
Loss on drying:(by I.R.moisture balance) 1.5 % +/- 0.5%<br>
6<br><br>
8.Lubrication:<br>
a)	Sift the dried granules through 16# sieve on vibrosifter and oversize should be passed through fitz mill using 1.5mm sieve. Transfer granules to the planetary mixer and mix for 2 minutes.<br>
b)	Sift lubricants, disintegrants using 60# sieve and blend the above materials in a suitable blender.<br>
9.Compression:<br>
After receiving the clearance from Q.C Dept transfer the granules to compression area and tablet compression machine should have been given clearance by in-process Q.C Dept. to take the product for compression.<br>
Compress the tablets on single/ double rotary compression machine using suitable<br>
die and punch complying with the necessary environmental condition.<br>
Environmental conditions of Compression cubicle:<br>
Temperature	:        Between 23 °C &amp; 27 ° C<br>
Relative Humidity	:        Below 50%<br>
lO.Film Coating Process<br>
Prepare the film coating solution using coating polymers, colors, plastiziers and<br>
solvents such as Isopropyl Alcohol, Methylene Chloride.Transfer Methylene<br>
Chloride and Isopropyl Alcohol into s.s. Containers and stir for five minutes using<br>
overhead stirrer.<br>
Slowly transfer coating materials into the same container under fast stirring till<br>
smooth and uniform slurry is formed. Stir them continuously for 25 minutes. Just<br>
prior to the actual use, pass the suspension through 80 # sieve. Transfer	the<br>
dedusted tablet (cores) into the coating pan and heat the tablet bed by inching<br>
process using hot air blower. The initial temperature should not exceed 45 - 50°C.<br>
7<br><br>
Once the tablet bed attains 45 C it is ready for spray coating. Start the exhaust. Start spraying the tablet bed with coating Suspension. Discontinue temporarily spraying of the suspension. If the tablet bed is found to be slightly over wet, allow the bed to dry completely and then continue with the spraying. After the last coat of coating suspension is applied continue drying of the tablet for 15 - 20 minutes. Thereafter apply about 50 gms of talc (10 m X 5 times) on to the tablet bed to get the required gloss. Continue to roll the tablets for 5 minutes and then transfer them onto the trays for Cooling. Pack the cool tablets in a double polybag  and store them in tight container away from moisture and heat.<br>
The following points are to be noted carefully during the entire coating process:<br>
1.	Compressor pressure should not fall below 3 kg/ cm.<br>
2.	Spraying should be stopped immediately if the air pressure falls below 3 kg.<br>
3.	Temperature of the tablet bed should be maintained between 40 ° -45 ° C.<br>
4.	Continuous spraying from start to end would be preferred.<br>
5.	Avoid even slight overwetting.<br>
6.	Avoid droping of coating solution directly into the coating pan.<br>
7.	Avoid spraying of solution on to the blower, exhaust or to the uncovered part of the coating pan since this will generate coating particles, which may stick to the tablet resulting in rough surfaces.<br>
8.	Powerful exhaust should be provided since it is dangerou s to inhale the vapour of methylene chloride and IPA over a longer period of time.<br>
9.	Avoid very close look of the tablet bed during the spraying of solutions to avoid inhalation of concentrated vapour of the solution.<br>
lO.The increase in weight of coated tablet to the desire weight. 11. After the final coat dry the tablets for about 15-30 minutes to get rid of the residual solvent.<br>
8<br><br>
12.All the electrical appliances and switches inside the coating room should Preferably is flame proof.<br>
Following are few examples sited in accordance to the said formulation. But it is not intended that the scope of this invention is limited to these.<br>
