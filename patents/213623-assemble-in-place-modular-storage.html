ASSEMBLE-IN-PLACE MODULAR STORAGE<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
SARAVIS, DARREN HILL, CA 90806,<br><br>
Of SUITE 210, 2801 JUNIPERO AVENUE, U.S.A. , AMERICAN national<br><br>
SIGNAL<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the  nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-  <br><br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
HELD OF THE INVENTION:<br><br><br>
This   present   invention  relates to  a  novel  assemble-in-place storage system. More specifically , to a snap together method and  system  of panels, with interlocking edges, from which a variety of self - supporting, storage units, racks, display centers and cabinets may be constructed. <br>
RELATED PRIOR ART:<br>
Modular storage systems are useful to allow a user to customize a component system to fit his or her particular needs. Panel type storage whereby similar side panels are connected via edge members are found in U.S. Patent No. 5,638,973 issued to Dewey et. al, and U.S Patent No. 5,466,058 issued to Chan. In both Dewey and Chan the containers may be stacked by placing a tab-like projection on the bottom edge of one part into a grove-like indentation in the top of another.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,888,114 issued to Slocum et. al., teaches a toy assembly modular storage system which has a self-supporting edge element to it. The Slocum storage is a series off similar panels, which form cubes via a slide together extruded mating edge with a catch running down the periphery of one edge and a Slatch running down the other side. Once two panels are latched in the slide-together fashion, the panel egdes can only be disassembled by sliding them apart. Slocum illustrates a plethora of configurations for the slide-in catch and corresponding slide-in latch, all relying on an extruded latch and catch which teaches no alignment guides or stops to maintain the plumb alignment of connected panels. Slocum's slide together mating connects 4 panels to form a four wall box.<br><br>
A remaining challenge in the field of modular storage systems   is to   provide similar panels can snap together at the edges. An additional challenges is to form snap together 5 or 6 sided structures. The present invention overcomes such challenges and<br>
prior limitations by creating a snap-in latch and catch panel attachment.<br>

SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br><br>
PCT/US02//00946<br><br><br><br>
The present invention is a modular storage system constructed of panels. Each panel has a front and a back side and four edges and four corner's. On at least one side of each corner, viewed Tom a front or a back side is found a latch/catch pair. At each adjacent <br>
5	corner is formed another latch/catch pair, the sequence of latch to catch is alternating around each side and mirror on the opposite side. The catch is elongated and semi-rigid, having adequate elasticity, memory and/or lubricity to deform and snap-back into place upon insertion or removal of the corresponding elongated latch. Accordingly, a pair of oppositely oriented panels snap together at an edge forming a right angle between the two <br>
10	panels. Additional panels may be added to form structures such as racks, carts, desks and cubes. Each catch may also provide a stop to prevent the latch from sliding within the elongated catch and becoming misaligned. At the corner between each adjacent pair of edges on each panel a buttress can be formed. Two adjacent corners buttresses (FIG. ID) support each other and act as a larger corner support which further stabilizes the structures<br>
 15	 constructed from the panels (FIGS. 4 &amp; 5A). <br>
Although the preferred embodiment indicates the latch and catch edges are formed as part of each panel, affixing the latch and catch edges at the  appropriate corner location   <br>
over a panel is also contemplated and set forth within. Advantages to affixing the latch and catch edges include combining dissimilar materials which are impossible or difficult <br>
20	to co-mold, such as a metal sheet, wood or metal grid panel (FIG. 8) affixed to plastic latches and catches. Doors and wheels (FIG. 5) may also be added to a cube, panel or structure. The panels may have protruding or recessed surface features which may form a support skeleton for a grid like panel   (FIG. 2A, 114, 117 &amp; 118) and may be used to provide pathways or guides for shelves and/or drawers.<br>
25		The features of the invention believed to be novel are set forth with particularity in<br><br>
the appended claim.  The invention itself, however, both as to configuration and method <br>
of operation, and the advantages thereof, may be best understood by reference to the <br>
following descriptions taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br><br>

PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Shown in FIG. 1A is a front perspective view of the preferred embodiment, generally designated 10.<br>
5			The cube is formed of five four sided panels 11. Each panel has a front 12 and a back side 13 face and an edge 14 at each side. At each end 15, of each edge 14, near the corners 16 of each panel 11, a latch/catch pair 20 is formed. Viewed from the edge 14, a latch 21 and a catch 22 are formed near the corner 16. The latch/catch pairs 20 are reversed such that on any given edge 15 of a panel 11 one latch 21 will be exposed on one <br>
10	side and one catch 22 will be exposed on the other side. This configuration allows alternating panels to be used to construct the entire structure.<br>
Shown in FIGS. 1B, 1C, ID and IE, are front and rear perspective views of a corner of an unattached panel, a perspective view of an attached front comer and a cut away view of FIG. ID at line A-A.<br>
15		         In FIGS. 1B &amp; 1C the latches 21 shape is shown, the tab projection forming the latch is elongated with an enlarged head 23 at its distal end which reversibly snaps into the corresponding elongated catch 22 slot 24. The panels are preferably an injection molded part constructed out of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene " ABS", Acetal, Acylic or Nylon. Howeve-, depending on the intended use, materials such as polycarbonate,<br>
20 	polypropylene or polyurethane may be substituted. An alignment stop 30 is formed at the junction of each edge 14. The alignment stop 30 prohibits the type of movement common to latch/catch panels which are connected via an extruded latch or catch which mount together via a slide-in function. Additionally, as shown in FIG. 1D the alignment stops 30 form a buttress between panels enhancing the structural integrity of the structure.<br>
25		         In FIG. 1E the enlarged head 23 forming the latch is shown mated firmly within the slot 24 of the catch 22, by constructing the catch 22 out of a material with sufficient lubricity, flexibility! and/or memory, the enlarged head 23 may be withdrawn or snapped-out of the slot 24 by displacing the slot walls 25 which can snap-back, undamaged, upon withdrawal. A sufficiently flexible slot wall 25 also places less stress on the neck 26 of <br>
30	the latch 21 thereby minimizing the risk of neck damage during attachment or detachment of panels.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 2A there is illustrated a front perspective view of a first alternate embodiment of the modular storage system, generally designated 110.<br><br>

corners 116 of formed within<br>
The cube is formed of five square panels 111. Each panel 111 is a square frame with an open grid structure formed therein. Each panel has a front 112 and a back side 113 face and an edge 114 at each side. At each end 115, of each edge 114, near the each panel 111, a latch/catch pair 200 is formed. A panel grid 117 is <br>
5	formed within the boundary of the edges 114 and a raised grid support 118 may be extended from the panel grid to provide greater stability to the panel grid 117 and panel 111. Viewed from the edge 114, a latch 201 and a catch 202 are formed near the corner. The latch/catch pairs 200 are reversed such that on any given edge 114 of a panel 111 one latch 201 will be exposed on one side and one catch 202 will be exposed on the other side. <br>
10 	This configuration allows similar alternating panels, with corresponding latch/catch pairs 200 to be used to construct the entire structure.<br>
	           Variations in the side panels are anticipated and discussed within. Side panels may<br>
be constructed in a wide variety of forms, with different surface features, cut-outs, skeletal<br>
structures, protrusions and the like without departing form the intended scope of the<br>
15	invention.<br>
Shown in FIGS. 2B, 2C, 2D and 2E, are a front and rear perspective view of a corner of an unattached panel, a perspective view of an attached front corner, a cut away view of FIG. 2D at line A-A, and a cut-away edge view of the intersection of four cubes. In FIGS. 2B &amp; 2C the latch 201 shape is illustrated, the tab projection forming the <br>
20 	latch has a enlarged head 203 which snaps in a reversible fashion into the corresponding catch 202 slot 204. The panels are preferably an injection molded part constructed out of polypropylene, ABS, polycarbonate or nylon which provides flexibility and durability. An alignment stop 230 is formed at the junction of each edge 114. The alignment stop 230, adjacent to an angular corner buttress 235 prohibits forward and back movement of a<br>
25    latch 201 within a catch 202.   Additionally, the combination of two or more adjacent corner business 235 (FIG. 2D) forms a larger corner support further enhancing the of the structure.<br>
			In FIG. 2D the enlarged head 203 forming the latch is shown mated firmly within<br>
the slot 204 forming the catch 202, by constructing the panels out of a material with<br>
latch 201 within comer buttresses structural integrity<br>
30	sufficient flexibility, memory and/or lubricity the enlarged head 203 may be withdrawn or<br>
snapped-out of the slot 204 without damaging the slot walls 205 or the neck 206 of the latch 201. A support guide 250 is formed between the latch 201 and the catch 202. In FIG. 2F a support rod 260 of a size and shape to mate with the support guide 250 is<br><br>
WO 02/055892	PCT/US02/00946<br>
shown. The support rod can be used to preclude removal of a panel when such action needs to be restricted, as may be the case with young children or in commercial, school or business locations.<br>
FIG. 3A shows a front perspective view of a second alternate embodiment of the     5	modular storage system, generally designated  	 	<br><br>
The cube is formed of five panels 301.  Each panel 301 is of a similar size.   Each<br><br>
panel side has an edge 304. At each end 305, of each edge 304, near the comers 306 of<br><br>
10<br>
15<br>
20<br>
25<br>
30<br><br>
each panel 301, a latch/catch pair 320 is affixed. Viewed from the edge 304, a latch 321 and a catch 322 are attached near the corner 306.  The latch /catch pairs 320 are reversed such that on any given edge 304 of a panel  301 one latch 321 will be exposed on one side and one catch 322  will be exposed on the other side. This configuration allows alternating<br>
panels to be used to construct the entire structure.<br>
In FIGS. 3B, 3C, 3D, 3E and 3F, there is shown a front, back and rear perspective<br>
view of the slide-on corner catch/latch, a perspective view of an attached front comer, a<br>
cut away view of FIG. 3E at line A-A, and a cut-away edge view of the intersection of<br>
four cubes.<br>
In FIGS. 3B, 3C, and 3D the latch 321 shape is illustrated, the tab projection forming the latch is elongated and has a enlarged head 323 which snaps in a reversible fashion into the corresponding catch 322 slot 324. The latch/catch pairs 320 are preferably an injection molded part constructed out of polypropylene, ABS, polycarbonate, high durometer rubber, or nylon which provides flexibility and durability. An alignment stop 330 is formed at the comer junction of each latch/catch pairs 320.<br>
FIG. 3E illustrates the position of the alignment stops 330 which inhibits movement of a latch 321 within a catch 322 thereby enhancing the structural integrity of the structure. Surrounding each comer buttress 330 is a support edge 331 which engages an adjacent support edge 331 of a panel affixed adjacent and forms the larger comer support 332. A panel mating guide 340 is formed opposite each latch/catch pair 320. It is via this panel mating guide 340 that each panel 301 is fitted into the latch/catch pair 320. It is envisioned that each panel 301 will be solidly affixed to the panel mating guide 340. The nature of the attachment will be dependent on the material the panel is constructed of, adhesives, locking tabs, sonic welds, glue, rivets, crimping and the like may be used.<br>
Variations in the side panels are anticipated and discussed within. A non-exclusive list of possible side panel materials are framed wire mesh, coated wire, plastic grids,<br><br>
