				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
RAIL STRUCTURE FOR THE DOOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a door rail structure for automatic doors and for<br>
other types of doors.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In conventional rails for doors, the track rail body on which the door wheels run<br>
and the load support member which attaches the rail body to a building are formed in a<br>
single piece, and these rails were installed in the buildings via this load support member<br>
by engaging devices such as bolts. These rails for doors are made of material which is<br>
harder than materials for wheels of the doors to avoid wear, and generally, extruded<br>
aluminum materials and steel materials are used.<br>
However, regarding the above-mentioned conventional rails for doors, in the<br>
case that the track rail body which directly contacts the door wheels need be replaced,<br>
because the entire track rail including load support member must be replaced, there were<br>
disadvantages not only in that the replacement task became large-scaled, but also in that<br>
the cost for the replacement was also high.<br>
There was also a disadvantage in that doors with this type of rail structure are<br>
not appropriate for use, particularly in wards where the quietude is required such as<br>
hospitals, residential areas, offices, etc., because vibrations made by the running of the<br>
door wheels are directly transmitted through to the building.<br>
This invention was made in order to overcome these disadvantages, and objects<br><br>
of the inventions are to make replacing the track rail body more efficient and to lower the<br>
cost. In addition, an object of the invention is to avoid the vibrations made by the<br>
running door wheels being transmitted through to the building, etc.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the rail structure for doors,<br>
according to the first aspect, has characteristics that the rail structure comprises a track<br>
rail body which supports wheels which are attached to doors so that the wheels can freely<br>
run, a load support member which extends along the above-mentioned track rail body<br>
and supports the track rail body from the bottom thereof, and track rail body is<br>
replaceably disposed on load support member. The present invention is described with<br>
respect to suspended doors, however, this does not exclude other types of doors. A load<br>
support member can be made of plural materials, or the entire part can be formed in a<br>
single piece as long as the load support member supports the track rail body and conveys<br>
the load to the building, etc. By constructing it in this way, it is possible to replace only<br>
the track rail body without replacing the load support member.<br>
As explained above, by the invention according to the first aspect, by dividing<br>
the track rail into the track rail body and the load support member, and by replaceably<br>
attaching the track rail body to the load support member, because the replacement of or:iy<br>
the track rail body becomes possible, the replacement of the load support member<br>
becomes unnecessary, the replacing operation of the track rail body in the case in which<br>
it is worn becomes easy, and the cost for replacement is decreased. Furthermore, by<br>
separating the load support member and the track rail body, both can respectively be<br>
made of different materials, and it is possible to choose a suitable material for each<br>
function.<br><br>
Also, the rail structure for doors, according to the second aspect, has<br>
characteristics that a convexo-concave fitting part is formed on the bottom surface of the<br>
track rail body and on the upper surface of the load support member. The concave part<br>
is formed on either side on the track rail body or on the load support member, and the<br>
convex part is formed on the other side.<br>
By constructing it in this way, easy assembly and easy replacement of the track<br>
rail body is possible.<br>
By the invention according to the second aspect, in addition to the effect of the<br>
first aspect, because the connection of the load support member and the track rail body is<br>
made by the fitting device, the assembly and the replacement of the track rail body can be<br>
easily performed.<br>
Also, the rail structure for doors, according to the third aspect, has<br>
characteristics that cushion member which absorbs vibrations from the track rail, is<br>
disposed between the track rail body and the load support member. By constructing it<br>
in this way, even if vibrations occur when the door wheels run on the track rail body, the<br>
vibrations are not transmitted to the building side via the load support member, or are<br>
decreased because the vibrations are absorbed by the cushion member.<br>
By the invention according to the third aspect, in addition to the effects of the<br>
first and the second aspects, by putting the cushion member between the track rail body<br>
and the load support member, even if the wheels of the door run on the track rail and<br>
vibrations occur on the track rail body or vibrations are transmitted to the track rail body,<br>
because the cushion member absorbs the vibration, the vibration is not transmitted to the<br>
building side via the load support member or the vibration decreases.<br>
Also, the rail structure for doors, according to the fourth aspect, has<br>
characteristics that the convex part which extends along the continuing direction of the<br><br>
track rail body on either of the bottom surface of the track rail body or the upper surface<br>
of the load support member, the groove-shaped concave part which extends along the<br>
continuing direction of the track rail body is formed on the other surface, thus the<br>
convexo-concave fitting part is formed, an interface of surfaces, in addition to the<br>
convexo-concave fitting part, is formed which are facing each other between the bottom<br>
surface of the track rail body and the upper surface of the load support member, and the<br>
cushion member is put between the track rail body and the load support; member,<br>
respectively in the convexo-concave fitting part and the interface of surfaces. The<br>
convex part and the concave part, however, extend in the continuing direction of the track<br>
rail, they do not necessarily continuously extend over the entire length of the track rail.<br>
That is, there can be one or plural parts in which the convex part and the concave part are<br>
discontinuous within the entire length of the track rail. By constructing it in this way, it<br>
is possible to make the load support member fully support the load of the door via the<br>
cushion member, and it is possible to increase the damping of vibrations between the<br>
load support member and the track rail body.<br>
By the invention according to the fourth aspect, in addition to the effect of the<br>
first through the third aspects, by putting the cushion member in the interface of surfaces<br>
rather than in the convexo-concave fitting part of the load support member and the track<br>
rail body, the load support member can fully support the load of the door via these<br>
cushion members, and the effect of damping vibrations between the load support member<br>
and the track rail body can further be enhanced.<br>
Also, the rail structure for doors, according to the fifth aspect, has characteristics<br>
that, of the concave part, the width dimension B of the middle part in the depth direction<br>
of a groove is larger than the width dimension A of the margin of a groove, and the side<br>
face of the groove is made to form a circular section, while the convex part is made to<br><br>
form a section corresponding to the concave part, the width dimension C of the middle<br>
part in the height direction is larger than the width dimension I) of a neck part, the side<br>
face of the convex part forms a circular section, the width dimension C is smaller than<br>
the width dimension A, the cushion member which is made of elastically deformable<br>
board-shaped material, and the thickness dimension E is larger than half the dimension of<br>
the difference between the width dimension A and the width dimension C. The cushion<br>
member is put in the convexo-concave fitting part formed by the concave part and the<br>
convex part, so the fact that the cushion member is elastic so that its thickness is smaller<br>
than the half the dimension of the difference between the width dimension A and the<br>
width dimension C, is inferable from the fact that the cushion member is put between the<br>
track rail body and the load support member in the convexo-concave fitting part<br>
according to the fourth aspect. By constructing it in this way, at the time of the fitting<br>
of the convexo-concave fitting part between the track rail body and the load support<br>
member, the disconnection of the track rail body from the load support member is<br>
avoided thanks to the retention of the convex part inside the concave part by elastic<br>
deformation of the cushion member and the snap action which is accompanied by the<br>
recovery of the elastic deformation.<br>
By the invention according to the fifith aspect, in addition to the effect of the first<br>
through the fourth aspects, by specifying the dimension of width of the margin of the<br>
concave part in the convexo-concave fitting part and the maximum dimension of width of<br>
the middle part of the height direction of the convex part, at the time of fitting of the<br>
convexo-concave fitting part, because the convex part is retained in the concave part by<br>
the elastic deformation with the snap action accompanied by its recovery., the derailing of<br>
the track rail from the load support member is prevented.<br>
Also, the rail structure for doors, according to the sixth aspect, has<br><br>
characteristics that, the thickness dimension E of the cushion member is made to be equal<br>
to or larger than half the dimension of the difference between the width dimension B and<br>
the width dimension C. By constructing it in tin's way, the convex part makes no<br>
movement inside the concave part of the convexo-concave fitting part, because the<br>
convex part is retained closely in the concave part, the load support member and the track<br>
rail body can be securely attached.<br>
By the invention according to the sixth aspect, in addition to the effect of the<br>
first through the fifth aspects, by arranging the thickness of the cushion member to be<br>
equal to or larger than the thickness of the dimension of the gap between the convex part<br>
and the concave part, the convex part makes no movement inside the concave part, and<br>
thus, the convex part is closely retained, so that the load support member and the track<br>
rail body are securely assembled.<br>
Also, the rail structure for doors according to the seventh aspect, has<br>
characteristics that, the convex part which extends along the continuing direction of the<br>
track rail body is formed on the upper surface of the track rail body, and the concave part<br>
which is engaged with the convex part on the upper surface of the track rail body, on the<br>
outer surface of the wheels. By constructing it in this way, the derailing of the door<br>
wheels from the track rail body can be avoided. Also, backward leaning in the<br>
continuing direction of the track rail body can be restricted.<br>
Also, the rail structure for doors, according to the eighth aspect, has<br>
characteristics that, the concave part which extends along the continuing direction of the<br>
track rail is formed, on the upper surface of the track rail, and the convex part which is<br>
engaged with the concave part on the upper surface of the track rail body, on the outer<br>
surface of the wheels. By constructing it in this way, the derailing of the door wheels<br>
from the track rail body can be avoided.<br><br>
By the invention according to the eight aspects, by forming the concave part and the convex<br>
part, both of which are engaged with each other on the upper surface of the track rail body and the<br>
outer surface of the wheels of the door, the derailing of the wheels from the track rail body can be<br>
prevented. Particularly in the invention according to the seventh aspect, because the convex part is<br>
formed on the upper surface of the track rail body, the leaning backward of the track rail toward the<br>
continuing direction can be restricted.<br>
Also, the rail structure for doors, according to the ninth aspect, has characteristics that, either<br>
the track rail body or the wheel is made of material with greater hardness than the other. By<br>
constructing it in this way, it is possible to specify the part made of material with greater hardness<br>
between the track rail body and the wheels as the material for less frequent replacement.<br>
By the invention according to the ninth aspect, in addition to the effect of the first through the<br>
eight aspects, by constructing either the track rail body or the wheels from a material having greater<br>
hardness than the other, the member having greater hardness, i.e.. either the track rail body or the<br>
wheels, can be specified as that for less frequent replacement.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a rail structure for doors, comprising :a track rail<br>
body which supports door wheels which are attached to a door wherein the door wheels freely run on<br>
the track rail body; a load support member extending along the track rail body and supporting the<br>

formed on either side between the bottom surface of the track rail body and the upper surface of the<br>
load support member, and in such a way that the concave part which is groove-shaped and extends<br>
along the continuing direction of the track rail body is formed on the other side between the bottom<br>

BEST' MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Preferred embodiments of the rail structure according to the present invention<br>
will be explained with reference to FIGS. 1 through 4.<br>
FIRST EMBODIMENT<br>
First preferred embodiment of the rail structure according to the present<br>
invention will be explained with reference to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2. FIG. 1 shows the state<br>
in which load support member 2 is installed on member of building side 1, the track rail<br>
body 3 is fit to this load support member 2, door wheels 4 are engaged onto the upper<br>
surface of this track rail body 3, door wheels 4 freely roll on the upper surface of this<br>
track rail body 3, and the door 6 is suspended from the door wheels 4 via brackets 5.<br>
Plural door wheels 4 are engaged with the track rail body 3 in the longitudinal direction<br>
of the track rail body 3, and door 6 is suspended from the track rail body 3 by these door<br>
wheels 4, and door 6 freely runs on the track rail body 3.<br>
FIG. 2 is a partial enlarged cross section of FIG. 1, wherein cushion member 7 is<br>
placed between the load support member 2 and the track rail body 3. The cushion<br>
member 7 is a board-shaped material having an elastic component such as silicone rubber,<br>
ester type polyurethane, ether type pojyurethane, natural rubber, chloroprene rubber,<br>
neoprene rubber, vinyl acetate, and isobutylene-isoprene rubber, and the cushion member<br>
7 is formed so as to have a cross section as shown in FIG. 2.<br>
Although the load support member 2 is made of extruded aluminum material,<br>
the load support member 2 can be made of other metals or synthetic resins, for example,<br>
acrylic resin, vinyl chloride, etc. Also, although the load support member 2 is made in a<br>
single piece of member, the load support member 2 can be made by connecting plural<br><br>
parts. Regarding this load support member 2, on the upper surface on which the track<br>
rail body 3 is carried, along the continuing direction of the track rail body 3, the concave<br>
part 2a is formed to be groove-shaped, and on both sides of this concave part 2a, a flat<br>
part 2b is formed. This concave part 2a has a shape such that the width of the middle<br>
part in the depth direction is expanded. That is, the margin of the concave part 2a, in<br>
other words, the width dimension B of the middle part in the depth direction of the<br>
groove is larger than the width dimension A of both sides of the open top mouth part of<br>
the groove which comprises the concave part 2a, and side surface of the groove is in a<br>
circular section of concave shape.<br>
Also, although the track rail body 3 is made of extruded aluminum material, the<br>
track rail body 3 can also be made of other metals, for example various steel materials<br>
such as austenite stainless steel material, martensitic stainless steel material, flat-rolled<br>
steel material, carbon steel material as well as copper alloys, etc or synthetic resins. On<br>
the bottom surface of the track rail body 3, a convex part 3a which extends along the<br>
continuing direction of the track rail body 3 is formed, and a flat part 3 b is formed on<br>
both sides of this convex part 3 a. The convexo-concave fitting part 8 is formed by the<br>
concave part 2a of the load support member 2 and the convex part 3 a of the track rail<br>
body 3. The cross sectional shape of the convex part 3 a is corresponding to the concave<br>
part 2a, of which the width dimension C of the middle part of the height direction is<br>
larger than the width dimension D of the neck part located in an upper position, the side<br>
face of the convex part 3a is in the form of a convex circular section. Furthermore, the<br>
width dimension C is smaller than the width dimension A, and between the concave part<br>
2a and the convex part 3a, a gap space with generally uniform thickness in cross section<br>
is formed.<br>
Also, the upper surface of the track rail body 3 is the convex part 3c which<br><br>
protrudes to the upper side in circular cross section, and this convex part 3c extends in<br>
the continuing direction of the track rail body 3. This convex part 3 c keeps the track<br>
rail body 3 from leaning backward in the continuing direction of the track rail body 3.<br>
The thickness dimension E of the cushion member 7 is larger than half the<br>
dimension of the difference between the width dimension A and the width dimension C;<br>
therefore, the cushion member 7 is accompanied with compressive deformation at the<br>
time of the insertion of the convex part 3a into the concave part 2a. Also, because the<br>
thickness dimension E of the cushion member 7 is equal to or larger than half the<br>
dimension of the difference between the width dimension B and the width dimension C,<br>
the cushion member 7 in the compressed state is filled, with no gap, between the concave<br>
part 2a and the convex part 3 a when the convex part 3 a is fit to the concave part 2a.<br>
The cushion member 7 is formed with a cross sectional shape like that of "" in<br>
advance as shown in FIG. 2. This cross sectional shape is made corresponding to the<br>
shape of the gap formed between the fitted concave part 2a of the load support member 2<br>
and the convex part 3a of the track rail body 3. Then, before attaching the track rail<br>
body 3 to the load support member 2, the cushion member 7 is previously attached on the<br>
track rail body 3. In order to attach the cushion member 7 on the track rail body 3, it is<br>
only necessary that the cushion member 7 with the "" - shaped section be fitted outside<br>
of the convex part 3a of the track rail: body 3. Because the cushion member 7 is<br>
elastically deformable, this cushion member 7 is fitted to the convex part 3 a with a round<br>
shape in cross section with a slight elastic deformation.<br>
Next, the track rail body 3 is attached to the load support member 2 by fitting<br>
the convex part 3a to the load support member 2, while the cushion member 7 is fitted<br>
outside of the convex part 3a. At this time, because the dimension E of the cushion<br>
member 7 is larger than half the dimension of the difference between the width<br><br>
dimension A and the width dimension C, the convex part 3a is fitted in the concave part<br>
2a while a part of the cushion member 7 is compressed. In the state that the convex part<br>
3a is inserted inside the concave part 2a, the compression of the cushion member 7 is<br>
released, and the thickness of the cushion member 7 recovers until it is equal to the<br>
thickness of the gap between the convex part 3 a and the concave part 2a, thus the convex<br>
part 3a is retained inside the concave part 2a. In this manner, by the snap action by the<br>
elastic deformation of the cushion member 7, the convex part 3a is inserted into the<br>
concave part 2a and this state is maintained. Therefore, the track rail body 3 does not<br>
easily disconnects from the load support member 2.<br>
The door wheels 4 of the door 6 are made of deformable material, which is less<br>
hard than the track rail body 3, that is, they are made of soft resin material, for example,<br>
polyamide resin, polyacetal resin, ABS resin, polycarbonate resin, phenol resin, MC<br>
nylon, etc. In this way, because the track rail body 3 is made of material which is harder<br>
than the door wheels 4, it is possible for the track rail body 3 to suffer less wear than the<br>
door wheels 4, and the replacement of the track rail body 3 can be less frequent than the<br>
replacement of the door wheels 4.<br>
However, the track rail body 3 is not necessarily free from being abraded, and<br>
the track rail body 3 may become worn after being used for a long time. Also, the track<br>
rail body 3 may sometimes break due to one cause or another, even without it being worn.<br>
In such a case, the track rail body 3 and the cushion member 7 can be detached from the<br>
load support member 2, and the track rail body 3 can be replaced. In this case, because<br>
the load support member 2 and the track rail body 3 are connected by the fitting of the<br>
concave part 2a and the convex part 3a ,with the cushion member 7 in between the<br>
concave part 2a and the convex part 3a, the operations of attaching and detaching the<br>
track rail body 3 become easy, and replacement can be easily performed. Also, because<br><br>
the load support member 2 need not be replaced, the replacing operation becomes easy<br>
and the cost for replacement decreases.<br>
Also, the concave part 4a which is formed in circular cross section is formed on<br>
all around the outer surface of the door wheels 4. This concave part 4a is formed<br>
corresponding to the convex part 3c on the upper surface of the track rail body 3. and the<br>
door wheels 4 roll and move while the door wheels 4 make the concave part 4a engage<br>
with this convex part 3c. By the engagement of the concave part 4a and the convex part<br>
3c, the derailing of the door wheels 4 from the track rail body 3 is prevented.<br>
In the rail structure for doors which is constructed as above, the cushion member<br>
7 is positioned between the upper surface of the load support member 2 and the bottom<br>
surface of the track rail body 3, and thus the load support member 2 and the track rail<br>
body 3 are insulated from vibrations by the cushion member 7. Accordingly, even<br>
though the door wheels 4 of the door 6 run on the track rail body 3 and vibrations occur<br>
or are transmitted to the track rail body 3, because the cushion member 7 absorbs the<br>
vibrations, the vibrations are not transmitted to the member of building side ] via the<br>
load support member 2, or the vibrations are damped.<br>
SECOND EMBODIMENT<br>
Next, the second preferred embodiment of the rail structure for doors according<br>
to the present invention will be explained with reference to the drawings FIG. 3 and FIG.<br>
4. The fact that the rail structure of the second preferred embodiment differs from that<br>
of the first preferred embodiment is only in the shape of the wheels and the shape of the<br>
track rail body; other structures and the relationships of the dimensions of each part are<br>
the same as in the first preferred embodiment, and therefore, identical reference numerals<br>
are attached to the identical parts , and the explanation thereof is omitted.<br><br>
The convexo-concave shape of an engaged part of the door wheels 4 of the door<br>
6 and the track rail body 3 in the second preferred embodiment is in opposite relationship<br>
to the convexo-concave shape of the engaged part in the first preferred embodiment. To<br>
explain in more detail, while in the first preferred embodiment, the upper surface of the<br>
track rail body 3 is made to be a circular section of the convex part 3c, and the outer<br>
surface of the door wheels 4 of the door 6 is made to be a circular cross section of the<br>
concave part 4a, in the second preferred embodiment, the upper surface of the track rail<br>
body 3 is a circular section of the concave part 3d, this concave part 3d extends in the<br>
continuing direction of the track rail body 3, and the convex part 4b which is in a circular<br>
cross section is formed on all around the outer surface of the door wheels 4.<br>
Additionally, this convex part 4b is formed corresponding to the concave part 3d<br>
of the upper surface of the track rail body 3, and the door wheels 4 roll and move while<br>
engaging the convex part 4b with this concave part 3d. Also, in the second preferred<br>
embodiment, the derailing of the door wheels 4 from the track rail body 3 is prevented by<br>
the engagement of the convex part 4b and the concave part 3d.<br>
Also, in the rail structure for doors in this second preferred embodiment, the<br>
same operational effects can be achieved as in the case of the first preferred embodiment.<br>
OTHER PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above. For<br>
example, in each embodiment described above, regarding the convexo-concave fitting<br>
part 8 of the track rail body 3 and the load support member 2, the convex part 3a is<br>
formed on the track rail body 3, and the concave part 2a is formed on the load support<br>
member 2, and thus the convexo-concave fitting part 8 is constructed; it is also possible<br>
for the convexo-concave fitting part to be constructed by forming xhe concave part on the<br><br>
track rail body 3, and at the same time, forming the convex part on the load support<br>
member 2.<br>
Also, in each embodiment described above, although it is explained that the<br>
dimension E of width of the cushion member 7 is generally of uniform thickness, it is<br>
also acceptable for the thickness between the flat part 2b of the upper surface of the load<br>
support member 2 and the flat part 3 b of the bottom surface of the track rail body 3 to be<br>
different from the thickness in the convexo-concave fitting part 8. In this case, the<br>
explanation of the thickness dimension E of the cushion member 7 in this invention and<br>
the embodiments described above shall be understood to be the dimension of the<br>
thickness in the convexo-concave fitting part 8.<br>
Also, in each embodiment described previously, it is possible for the track rail<br>
body 3 to be made of a material having greater hardness than the door wheels 4 of the<br>
door 6, and the door wheels 4 are therefore replaced more frequently than the track rail<br>
body 3 is replaced so that the door wheels 4 will be the item to wear out first.<br>
Conversely, the door wheels 4 may be made of a material having greater hardness than<br>
the track rail body 3, and the track rail body 3 is replaced more frequently than the door<br>
wheels 4 are replaced so that the track tail body 3 will be the item to wear out first.<br>
Also, in each embodiment described previously, although the cushion member 7<br>
is placed between the load support member 2 and the track rail body 3, the invention will<br>
still be effective even if the cushion member 7 does not exist. In that case, although the<br>
effect of decreased vibration cannot be achieved by the cushion member 7, the effect that<br>
only the track rail body 3 can be replaced is possible.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
In the present invention, by dividing the track rail into the track tail body and the<br><br>
load support member, and by replaceably attaching the track rail, body to the load support<br>
member, because the replacement of only the track rail body becomes possible, the<br>
replacement of the load support member becomes unnecessary, the replacing operation of<br>
the track rail body in the case in which it is worn becomes easy, and the cost for<br>
replacement is decreased. Furthermore, by separating the load support member and the<br>
track rail body, both can respectively be made of different materials, and it is possible to<br>
choose a suitable material for each function.<br><br>
