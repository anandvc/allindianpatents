				<td>A method for managing a defective area of a write-once optical recording medium, and an optical recording medium using the same, is provided. In an optical disc device for recording/reproducing data using an optical disc such as a BD WO type disc, the method permits the normal reading and reproducing of recording data written on a defective area of the disc, through a replacement write operation for the recording data of the defective area. When a defect is detected within a predetermined recording sector of the optical disc during the recording process, the recording data is written on. a spare area corresponding to the defective aiea and the fims writtci data is managed. To accomplish this during data recording, the method selectively searches a write location of temporary defect list (TDFL) information, which is effective before disc finalization, or defect list (QFL) information, which becomes e-ffettive -upon execution of a disc finalization operation. The TDFL information is written in an assigned recording sector and includes one or more defective area data locators indicative of defective areas as detected. Write location information and identification information enable the selective search of the DFL information after disc finalizadon and are written together with the DFL information, as disc definition inibnnation in a defect management area assigned to the disc&#x27;s lead-in area.</td>

METHOD FOR MANAGING DEFECTIVE AREA ON WRITE-ONCE<br>
OPTICAL RECORDING MEDIUM, AND OPTICAL RECORDING<br>
MEDIUM USING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to optical recording methods and media, and<br>
in particular, to a method for managing a defective area on a WORM-type<br>
optical recording medium, and an optical recording medium using the same.<br>
The method is particularly adapted for recording data on write-once optical discs<br>
such as those using the recently developed Blu-ray disc format known as BD-<br>
WO.<br>
Background Art<br>
Data recording devices and media using optical read/write means have<br>
generally been categorized according to their writing capability or flexibility.<br>
Among read-only optical recording media, there are those using CD-ROM and<br>
DVD-ROM formats, which have no write capability. Among known disc<br>
standards that allow multiple write operations to be freely performed, there are<br>
CD-RW, DVD-RAM, DVD-RW, and DVD+RW types, which are rewritable<br>
compact discs and digital versatile discs.<br>
WORM-type discs, on the other hand, are adopted for use as datastorage<br>
devices requiring large storage capacity; Such discs, however, have limited<br>
recording flexibility and are for use in write-once read-many applications.<br>
These include CD-R and DVD-R types, which are recordable compact discs and<br>
digital versatile discs.<br><br>
2<br>
Meanwhile, a new type of high-density DVD, known as a Blu-ray disc,<br>
which is a large-capacity optical disc for recording high-quality audio and video<br>
data using a blue violet laser, has been developed. The Blu-ray disc adopts a<br>
rewritable disc format known as BD RE.<br>
In the above types of optical recording media, surface imperfections and<br>
defects are generated during theif manufacture, handling, or use. Accordingly,<br>
a method for managing the defective areas is used during a data recording<br>
operation, so that data reproduction can be carried out normally.<br>
Referring to FIG 1, an optical disc recording/reproducing device 100 for<br>
use with an optical recording medium 102, such as a BD-RE formatted disc,<br>
receives a data/command input from a host (or controller) 200. The optical<br>
disc recording/reproducing device 100 is provided with an optical pickup 104 for<br>
writing/reading data to/from an inserted optical recording medium, a pickup<br>
servo 106 for controlling the optical pickup to achieve proper tracking and to<br>
maintain a, controlled distance with respect to the surface of the optical recording<br>
rnedium, A data processor 108 for processing data to and from the optical pickup<br>
by restoring to a desired signal value a reproduction signal received from the<br>
optical pickup or by modulating a recording signal received from the host for<br>
transfer to the disc, an interface 110 for transferring data between the host and<br>
the recording/reproducing device, a microcomputer 112 for controlling the<br>
recording/reproducing device; and a memory 114 for storing a program and for<br>
temporarily storing various information including defect management<br>
information and data. Under the control of the host 200 and stored<br>
programming, the optical pickup 104 reads da la stored (or written) on a disc,<br>
providing a data signal input to the data processor 108 for reproduction<br>
processing and output, and writes data onto specified areas of the disc using a<br>
write signal output from the data processor, During a write operation, the<br><br>
3<br>
optical disc recording/reproducing device 100 receives a data stream (or an<br>
encoded analog signal) and outputs the write signal to the optical pickup 104 in<br>
accordance with a command input via the host 200 and the program stored in the<br>
memory 114 and executed by the microcomputer 112,<br>
Refering to FIG. 2, a BH-RE type disc for use with the device of FIG. 1<br>
is divided into assigned areas. The assigned areas essentially comprise a data<br>
area set between a lead-in area (LIA) and a lead-out area (LOA). The data area<br>
includes an inner spare area (ISA) adjacent the lead-in area and an outer spare<br>
area (OSA) adjacent the lead-ont area.<br>
As above the optical disc recording/reproducing device 100 processes<br>
input data from a host 200 and writes the data onto an optical disc in clusters<br>
corresponding to an error correction code block unit. If during a writs<br>
operation the existence of a defective area is detected in the data area, the optical<br>
disc letrading/reproducing device 100 carries out a scries of replacement write<br>
operations to write a data cluster corresponding to rhc detected defective area in<br>
one of the two spare areas (shown in the example of FIG. 2 as the ISA).<br>
Therefore, by writing a data cluster of a defective area in a spare area instead of<br>
the defective area, the data can be read and reproduced from the spare area, thus<br>
preventing the occurrence of writing errors even when an optical disc exhibits<br>
defects in the data area and thereby assuring data security and data integrity.<br>
The above method is carried out using an optical recording medium that<br>
allows free access to the data recording areas since a rewritable disc is used.<br>
Therefore, in managing the data of the defective areas, the optical disc<br>
recording/reproducing device has unlimited use of the recording area. If a<br>
WORM-type disc is used, however, the write operation is performed only once<br>
and must be completed before normal data retrieval operations by the user can<br>
be carried out<br><br>
4<br>
For example, another type of Blu-ray disc, using a format known as BD-<br>
WO, has been recently developed. The BD-WO type disc, which is a write<br>
once type disc, cannot make use of known methods for managing a defective<br>
area on the disc, since the standardization of this type of disc fonnat has only<br>
recently begun, AN immediate solution is required.<br>

Best mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying<br>
drawings. Throughout ihe drawings, like dements are indicated using the same<br>
or similar reference designations.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, in which assigned areas of an optical recording<br>
mediurn such as a BD-WO type disc are depicted to illustrate the method<br>
according to the present invention, a data area is set between a lead-in area (L1A)<br>
and a lead-out area (LOA), wherein the data area is essentially comprised of a<br>
user data area and a non-user data area disposed on either side of the user data<br>
area. The user data area is assigned both physical sector numbers (PSN) and<br>
logical sector numbers (LSN), while the non-user data areas are assigned<br>
physical sector numbers only. The non-user data areas are respectively<br>
comprised of an outer spare area (OSA) and a temporary defect list (TDFL) area.<br>
The outer spare area is for writing data corresponding to a defective area, i.e.,<br>
replacement data, while the TDFL area is for writing defective area data locators<br>
pertaining to the defective areas as detected and the corresponding replacement<br>
data. The defective area data locator information may be written either<br>
cumulatively or continuously.<br>
Though not shown in the drawings, the OSA and TDFL areas may be<br>
alternatively located or there may be additionally assigned areas, such as an<br>
inner spare area (ISA). For example, an ISA may be provided additionally or<br><br>
9<br>
substituted for the OSA, or the TDF L area may be disposed in a non-user data<br>
area adjacent the OSA or in the LIA,<br>
In recording data on an optical recording medium such as that shown (a<br>
FIG. 3, the optical disc recording/reproducing device 100 of FIG. 1 executes an<br>
internal program to write data in a temporally continuous manner on a<br>
predetermined writing sector in the user data area. The write operation<br>
progresses until data recording ends or until the last recording sector has been<br>
recorded. Each instance of writing will be referred to as a data recording stage.<br>
The predetermined writing sector is set as a defect verification unit<br>
(DVU) by which, during the data recording stage, a defective area is detected<br>
using a verify-after-write operation performed after each DVU. One DVU may<br>
have a recording she equivalent to any number of physical tracks or clusters,<br>
and for the sake of convenience in describing the embodiments of the present<br>
invention, this recording size has been arbitrarily set to five clusters. A<br>
plurality of defect verification units {DVU 1 through DVU n) make up one<br>
instance of recording or a data recording stage having a. temporal continuity, and<br>
each of data recording stages 1, 2, and 3 are made up of a number of DVUs<br>
dependent on the amount of data being recorded.<br>
The verify-after-write operation is perforrmed by the optical disc<br>
recording/reproducing device 100, which executes a repetitious series of<br>
detecting operations to determine the presence of defective areas corresponding<br>
to the written data of one DVU. In each defective area detecting operation, the<br>
data written in the DVU is reproduced to verify its recording status; that is, it is<br>
determined whether the data was written successfully such that normal<br>
reproduction is possible. If normal reproduction cannot be verified, it is<br>
determined that a defect is present.<br>
FOR example, after sequentially and continuously writing data in physical<br><br>
10<br>
cluster 1-5 of the DVU 1, through a recording operation S10, the optical disc<br>
recording/reproducing device 100 performs a verify-after-write operation by<br>
progressively reproducing the data written in the DVU 1, to verify normal<br>
reproduction and thereby detect the presence of any defective areas. In<br>
progressively reproducing, the optical disc recording/reproducing device 100<br>
sequentially reads the data as written, starting again from the first (or next in<br>
position) cluster and reading continuously until detection of the first (or next)<br>
occurrence of an unverifiable data cluster through a reproducing operation Sll,<br>
indicating the presence of a defective area in, say, the physical cluster 2, Then,<br>
the optical disc recording/reproducing device 100 temporarily stores in its<br>
memory 114 the data of the physical cluster 2. The temporarily stored<br>
(buffered) data is used to carry out a replacement write operation through a<br>
recording operation S12, whereby replacement data corresponding to the<br>
defective cluster is written as a replacement cluster 2' in the OSA instead of the<br>
defective area. Here, the data of the second cluster may be written starting<br>
from either end of the OSA.<br>
After the completion of a replacement write operation as above, the<br>
optical disc recording/reproducing device 100 continues reproducing the data of<br>
the DVU 1 through a reproducing operation S13, progressing to the next cluster,<br>
i.e., to the physical cluster 3, When another defective area is detected in, say,<br>
the physical cluster 4, the optical disc recording/reproducing device 100 carries<br>
out another replacement write operation through a recording operation S14, in<br>
which the data of the defective cluster is buffered and then written as a<br>
replacement cluster 4' in the OSA in succession to the replacement cluster 2'.<br>
A continuation of the veriry-after-write operation for DVU 1 through a<br>
reproducing operation 515 may find no further defective areas, which completes<br>
the data recording of DVU 1 for the data recording stage 1. Thus, the DVU 1<br><br>
11<br>
ultimately contains the data of the physical dusters 1, 3, and 5 and has two<br>
defective areas, the data of which is written in the OSA as replacement clusters<br>
2' and 4' corresponding to the defective areas. The same process is repeated<br>
for each DVU until the conclusion of the data recording stage 1 by the execution<br>
of recording and verify-after-write operations for the DVU n. In doing so, a<br>
physical duster 6 is written as the first cluster of the DVU 2.<br>
Thereafter, i.e., in succession to a completed verify-after-write operation<br>
for the DVU n, the optical disc recording/reproducing device 100 writes a<br>
defective area data, locator for identifying each defective area and locating the<br>
corresponding replacement data. These locators arc written as TDFL<br>
information and stored in the TDFL area. To increase the access rate of the<br>
TDFL information, the optical disc recording/reproducing device 100 also writes,<br>
as disc definition stroctme (DOS) information, write location, information in a<br>
defect management area (DMA) assigned in the LI A.<br>
As shown in FIG, 4, the TDFL information comprises a plurality of defect<br>
entries, each expressed as pair of PSNs, i.e., a defect PSN and a replacement<br>
PSN corresponding thereto. Here, fee defect PSN is the physical sector number<br>
of the defective area, and the replacement PSN is the physical sector number of<br>
the area in which the data of the defective area is written. Each defect entry<br>
includes status information in addition to the PSNs. The status information is<br>
comprised of status 1 and status 2 information, with the status 2 information<br>
going unused in the present embodiment. The status 1 information indicates<br>
the type of relationship existing between a defective or potentially defective area<br>
and any replacement data corresponding thereto, including replacement data<br>
recording status, address assignment, defective area confirmation, replacement<br>
area availability, and the like.<br>
The recording sector corresponding to, say, the 60th byte (60th byte<br><br>
12<br>
position) of the DPS information may include write location information for<br>
accessing the first PSN for the currant TDFL information, i.e., the TDFL<br>
information reflecting the latest (most recent) replacement write operation.<br>
This write location information is written and managed together with<br>
identification information, which comprises a disc finalization flag indicating<br>
whether a disc finalization operation has been executed, signaling that the<br>
writing process of an optical disc is finalized.<br>
When the identification information shows no disc finalization, the<br>
optical disc recording/reproducing device 100 reads the DMA and refers to the<br>
writs location information to search for a write location. One byte of the<br>
identification information may, for example, be written as "0000 XXXX" to<br>
indicate that no disc finalization operation has been executed, to he set to "0000<br>
1111" to indicate the execution of disc finalization, At the same time, the<br>
identification information may have a size greater than one byte, and the<br>
execution of the disc finalization operation may be indicated using values other<br>
than "0000 XXXX" and "0000 1111." The DDS information, may include write<br>
location information for accessing both the first TDFL and ihe current TDFL, or<br>
for selectively accessing either.<br>
When a disc finalization operation is executed actor ding to user<br>
operation, the optical disc recording/reproducing device 100 sets the disc<br>
finalization flag from a value (e.g., "0000 XXXX") indicating that no disc<br>
finalization operation has been executed to a value (e.g., "0000 1111") indicating<br>
a disc-finalized state and writes the TDFL information as defect list (DFL)<br>
information in the DMA. Thus, upon disc finalization, the write location<br>
information stored within the DDS information is written as a final value<br>
indicative of the write locatiou of the DFL information, The recording sector<br>
corresponding to the 24th byte (24th byte position) of the DDS information may<br><br>
13<br>
include write location information for accessing the first PSN of the DFL<br>
information.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the DDS information may, to increase the access rate<br>
of the last or latest TDFL information (TDFL q), further include write location<br>
information corresponding to the first PSN of the most recently written TDFL,<br>
i.e., the TDFL information immediately preceding disc fifialization.<br>
As shown in FIG 6, the TDFL information may be included in a<br>
recording sector in the LIA, On the other hand, as shown in FIG 7, the TDFL<br>
information, may be assigned to a recording sector within the OSA., or may be<br>

Industrial applicability<br>
Tn the method of the present invention, when an optical recording<br>
medium such as a BD-WO type disc is placed into a programmable system such<br>
as that shown in FIG. 1, the optical disc recording/reproducuig device 100<br>
searches the DMA assigned to the disc's LIA, detects the disc finalization flag<br>
from the DDS information of the DMA, checks its value, and thereby determines<br>
whether the disc has been finalized. If the disc finalization flag is a value<br>
showing that no disc finalization has occurred, the optical disc<br>
recording/reproducing device 100 searches and accesses write location<br>
information pertaining to the first and/or last (latest) TDFL information in the<br>
DDS information, to then search and ascesss the TDFL information. The optical<br>
disc recording/reproducing device 100 then carries out a series of replacement<br>
write operations or reproducing operations, If, on the other hand, the disc<br>
finalization flag is a value showing that disc finalization has occurred, the optical<br>
disc recording/reproducing device 100 searches and accesses write location<br><br>
14<br>
information pertaining to the first and/or last (latest) DFL information stored<br>
within the DPS information, to then search and access the DFL information.<br>
The optical disc recording/reproducing device 100 may then carry reproducing<br>
operations.<br>
By adopting the method for managing a defective area on a write-once<br>
optical recording medium according to the present invention, data to be written<br>
on a defective area of the disc is written, and effectively managed, through the<br>
performance of a replacement write operation in which the data is written in an<br>
alternative (spare) data area corresponding to the defective area. Thus, an<br>
optical recording medium such as the recently developed BD-WO type disc<br>
formatted according to the method can be used to record data through a write-<br>
once operation, so that recorded data can be reproduced, normally even when<br>
there &amp;re defects present on the disc. Moreover, adoption of the method of the<br>
present invention will facilitate BD-WO standardization by providing a suitable<br>
write-once optical recording medium whereby data to be written on a defective<br>
area thereof can be effectively managed.<br>
It will become apparent to those skilled in the art that various<br>
modifications and variations can be made in the method for managing a<br>
defective area on a write-once optical recording medium, and an optical<br>
recording medium using the same, according to the present invention without<br>
departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the<br>
present invention cover such modifications and variations provided they come<br>
within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br>
