				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of macroporous bis(picolyl) amine polymers useful for the selective removal of metal ion application. The bis (picolyl) amines having general formula 1 in the drawing accompanying this specification wherein R = (2-picolyl) , ( 3- picolyl). The macroporous bis(picolyl) amine polymers prepared by the process of this invention are useful in selective removal of metal ions in mixed stream of other metal ions. These type of polymers are also referred to as chelating polymers.<br>
The macroporous bis(picolyl) amine polymers prepared by the process of this invention are new chelating polymers useful in the selective removal of copper ions in mixed streams of other metal ions such as nickel, iron and the like. The new chelating polymers are prepared by covalently attaching the chelating ligand such as the bis(picolyl) amine described by the process of this invention.<br>
Selective removal of metal ions are useful in mining and easing environmental problems such as pollution due to metal ion contamination in a mixed stream of metal ions. In the hydrometallurgical applications to remove copper from ores, use of chelating      resins     with     specific     copper     ion     selectivity     is<br>
desired. The selectivity is desired in mixed stream of other metal ions to be economically viable.<br>
Although chelating polymers for the selective removal of copper ions in mixed stream are known, the disadvantages are in terms of higher selectivity, choice of pH in these operations and the overall process economics.<br>
Chelating polymers can be defined as those polymers wherein, the chelating group has been incorporated. Thus a chelating polymer essentially has two components - the polymer matrix of choice and the chelating ligand which is incorporated in the polymer matrix. The incorporation of the chelating group is conventionally done by the chemical modification of the polymer or by polymerization of functionalised monomers that contains the desired chelating group.<br>
Chemical modification of the polymers is the preferred route to prepare chelating polymers. The advantages are that the polymers are available in diverse forms such as macroporous beads of different pore size, pore volume and pore size distribution, membranes or as fibers. The stability offered by the hydrocarbon backbone is the other attractive feature.<br>
The chelating polymers extensively studied and commercially available are those based on styrene or its derivatives crosslinked with divinyl benzene. The disadvantages of these systems are :<br>
1.   The polymers  are highly hydrophobic and thus have non specific characteristics.<br>
2.	The polymers have high cross-link density which limits the porosity. Low porosity restricts the concentration of active chelating ligand in the polymer matrix.<br>
3.	The process of chemical modification is through reactive etherification that entails multiple steps thus affecting the overall efficiency of the chelating polymer.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of macroporous bis(picolyl) amine polymers that offers advantages over the available chelating polymers such as the ones described above. The novel macroporous bis(picolyl) amine polymers prepared by the process of this invention has bis(2-picolyl) amine and bis(3-picolyl) amine as the chelating ligands and the modified polymers are useful in selective removal of copper ions in mixed stream containing other metal ions. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of macroporous bis(picolyl) amine polymers that are stable during the conditions adopted for the selective removal of copper ions from mixed metal ion streams. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of macroporous bis(picolyl) amine polymers that offer high surface area for the ligands to be bound on the surface thus offering better process economics. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a single step process for the preparation of macroporous bis(picolyl) amine polymers thus offering better selectivity and control.<br>
Accordingly , the present invention provides a process for the preparation of macroporous bis (picolyl) amine polymers useful for the selective removal of metal ion applications, which comprises reacting macroporous glycidyl polymers preferably glycidal methacrylate-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate with the bis(picolyl) amine ligands of general formula 1 &amp; tho drawing aocompanying this apecificatiofP wherein R = 2 -picolyl, 3 - picolyl, in a polar solvent, at a temperature in the range of 65 to 90Â°C , for a period ranging from 24 to 36 hours, cooling the reaction mixture to ambient temperature, separating the solids from the said reaction mixture by conventional methods such as filtration, washing the obtained solids with the said reaction medium, drying the solids to get macroporous bis(picolyl) amine polymers, followed by treating the obtained macroporous bis(picolyl) amine polymers with 2N sulphuric acid and 2N alkali metal hydroxide solution to get ready to use macroporous bis(picolyl) amine polymers.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the bis(picolyl) amine used may be such as bis(2-picolyl) amine, bis (3-picolyl) amine of general formula 1 as shown in accompanying drawing.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the macroporous glycidyl polymers used may be prepared as per the process described in the example no. 1 and 2.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, the polar solvent used may be such as alcohol selected from methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or water.<br>

hydroxide used for conditioning the macroporous polymer  is  selected from sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or the like.

The advantages of the invention are as follows :<br>
1.	The polymer matrix used for the preparation of novel chelating polymers in the process of this invention are neither hydrophobic or hydrophilic. This prevents nonspecific binding of chelating ligands as encountered in conventional polymer matrix hitherto used.<br>
2.	The polymer matrixrix used is macroporous. This facilitates in higher loading of the chelating ligand since the surface area available is large as compared to conventional polymer matrices previously used which high crosslink density reducing the porosity leading to lower concentration of chelating ligands that could be incorporated.3. In the conventional polymer matrices, the chemical modification is made through less reactive etherification, while in the process of this invention, the covalent attachment of the chelating ligand is through facile reaction of the ring opening of the epoxy group. The number of steps in chemical modification is thus reduced and the effective chelating capacity is thus not lost.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
