The present invention relates to a producing method where at least one kind of substance to be oxidized of propylene, propane, isobutylene and (meth)acrolein is catalytically oxidized in a gas phase with molecular oxygen to form (meth)acrolein or (meth)acrylic acid stably and efficiently.<br><background art><br>
In general, (meth)acrylic acid or (meth)acrolein is continuously produced in such a manner that, by use of a multi-tubular reactor having a plurality of reaction tubes in each of which a catalyst is packed, propylene, propane, isobutylene or (meth) acrolein that is a substance to be oxidized is catalytically oxidized with molecular oxygen or molecular oxygen-containing gas in a gas phase in the presence of a composite oxide catalyst.<br>
In the reaction tubes, a temperature distribution is generated in a direction of a flow (in a tube axis direction) of a process gas consisting of a substance to be oxidized and molecular oxygen or a molecular oxygen-containing gas. In general, a temperature peak exists on<br><br>
an upstream side.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a change in a temperature distribution in the tube axis direction resulting from a continuous operation. As an operation is continued, the activity of a catalyst deteriorates and particularly a decrease in the activity of the catalyst is large in the upstream side. Accordingly, a reaction velocity in the region declines to result in a decrease in a heat release value owing to a reaction. Concerning the flow of the gas on a more downstream side than there, as a reaction amount on the upstream side decreases, since a concentration of a raw material that is supplied becomes higher, a reaction amount increases and a heat release value increases. However, a total reaction amount over an entire reaction tube decreases. At this time, a position of a temperature peak in a tube axis direction (hereinafter, referred to as a peak position) moves toward a downstream side and a peak temperature declines (a temperature distribution-- varies from a to b) . To the situation, so far an operation is carried out in such a manner that a temperature of a heat medium (reaction temperature) is raised to bring the peak position back to the upstream side and to heighten a peak temperature, thereby improving the catalyst activity to maintain a yield (the temperature distribution changes from b to c') .<br><br><disclosure of the invention><br>
The problem concerning the conventional operation is in that the change of the peak temperature from the beginning of the operation is so large that the load on the catalyst in the neighborhood of the peak position becomes heavy and the catalyst activity in the region is rapidly deteriorated. Accordingly, the temperature of the heat medium is raised to reactivate the catalyst activity, and thereby a decrease in the yield due to deactivation of the catalyst can be compensated for a short period. However, thereafter, after a definite time has passed, the catalyst activity extremely deteriorates locally, resulting in a rapid deterioration in the yield.<br>
The present invention intends to provide a method of producing (meth)acrolein or (me th) acrylic acid in which method by use of a multi-tubular reactor having a plurality of reaction tubes in each of which a catalyst is packed, prdpylehe, propane, isobutylene or (meth)acrolein-is catalytically oxidized in a gas phase with molecular oxygen or molecular oxygen-containing gas in the presence of a composite oxide catalyst, wherein (meth)acrolein or Cmeth) acrylic acid can be obtained stably, with high yield and without locally deactivating the catalyst.<br>
The present inventors, after studying hard, found that when, in order to overcome the decrease in the catalyst activity caused by the continuous operation,<br><br>
without excessively raising the temperature of the heat medium to maintain the reaction yield, the peak temperature of the catalyst is moved within a definite range to the downstream side, with the local deactivation of the catalyst avoiding, (meth)acrolein or (meth)acrylic acid can be obtained stably and with high yield, and came to the present invention.<br>
In other words, according to the invention, the following producing method of (meth)acrolein or (meth) acrylic acid is provided, and thereby the object of the invention mentioned above can be achieved.<br>
That is a method in which (meth) acrylic acid or (meth)acrolein is produced by use of a fixed bed multi-tubular reactor that has a structure that has a plurality of reaction tubes provided with at least one catalyst layer in a tube axis direction and allows a heat medium for controlling a reaction temperature to flow outside of the - reactron^ tubes / in the reaction-- tubes&gt;^--*gas —phase catalytic oxidation between at least one kind of substance to be oxidizes of propylene, propane, isobutylene, and (meth)acrolein and molecular oxygen or a gas containing molecular oxygen is carried out, characterized in that, at the beginning of operation, temperature difference between a temperature of the heat medium and a peak temperature of the catalyst is set in the range of 20 to 80°C, and during operations a peak temperature T (°C) of the catalyst in a<br><br>
tube axis direction satisfies an equation 1 below.<br><br>

In what follows, the present invention will be detailed.<br>
The present invention is a method where by use of a fixed bed multi-tubular reactor that has a structure that has a plurality of reaction tubes provided with -at least one catalyst layer in a tube axis direction-and allows a heat medium for controlling a reaction temperature to flow outside of the reaction tubes, in the reaction tubes, gas phase catalytic oxidation between at least one kind of substance to be oxidized of propylene, propane, isobutylene, and (meth)acrolein and molecular oxygen or a gas containing molecular oxygen is carried out to produce (meth)acrylic acid or (meth)acrolein continuously.<br>
Temperature difference at the beginning of operation<br><br>
between a temperature of the heat medium and a peak temperature of the catalyst is set in the range of 20 to 80°C, and preferably in the range of 20 to 70°C. The temperature of the heat medium mentioned above is a temperature at an entrance from which the heat medium is supplied to the reactor. When, at the beginning of operation, the temperature of the heat medium is controlled so as to set the temperature difference with the peak temperature of the catalyst to be in the above range, in the reaction tubes, localization of an exothermal reaction can be suppressed. As a result, the activity of the catalyst can be inhibited from locally deteriorating largely. This is observed as a phenomenon in which in a temperature distribution of the catalyst with respect to a direction in which a process gas flows (in a tube axis direction) a shape of the peak temperature existing in an upstream side does not locally protrude and a transition to-a ^downstream side as well as- a decrease in•-••*-*•-- •-• the peak temperature diminishes while the operation is continued.<br>
An actual temperature difference between the observed peak temperature mentioned above and the temperature of the heat medium at the beginning of operation is preferably in the range of 20 to 80°C, and more preferably in the range of 20 to 70°C.<br>
Even when the temperature of the heat medium is set<br><br>
as above stated at the beginning of operation, with continuation of the operation, a decrease in a peak temperature caused by a decrease in the activity of the catalyst and a transition of a peak position cannot be avoided. Accordingly, in the invention, during operation, the peak temperature T (°C) of the catalyst in a tube axis direction is made to satisfy an equation 1, and preferably an equation 2 below. In this case, when the temperature of the heat medium is changed, the peak temperature T can be controlled, and, specifically, when the temperature of the heat medium is raised, the peak temperature T can be raised and the peak position can be moved to the upstream side.<br><br><br>
(Equation 1)<br>
(Equation 2)<br><br>
(In the equation 1, L, T0, X, and X0, respectively, denote a length of a reaction tube (unit: mm) , a peak temperature of a catalyst in a tube axis direction at the beginning of operation (unit: °C) , a length from an entrance of the reaction tube up to a position that shows the peak temperature T (unit: mm) and a length from the entrance of the reaction tube up to a position that shows<br><br>
the peak temperature T0 (unit: mm)).<br>
In the case that L x { IT-T01 / (X-Xo) } is too big, a change of the position of the peak temperature is so small to cause the localization of a deactivation region of the catalyst. Accordingly, it is not desirable that L x { | T-Tol/(X-X0)} is more than 300. On the contrary, when L x { |T-Tol/(X-Xo) } is too small, the localization of the deactivation of the catalyst can be avoided, however, as the total reaction amount decreases, it is not desirable that L x{ | T-To I / (X-Xo) } becomes less than 35.<br>
In Fig. 2, a change of the temperature distribution of the catalyst in a tube axis direction when the peak temperature T satisfies the equation 1 in the continuous operation is shown. That the peak temperature T satisfies the equation 1 means that, in Fig. 2, a range in which the peak temperature T moves is in a definite range (in the region R) . For example, a temperature distribution a at the beginning of operation is changed to- a temperature distribution c as the operation goes on.<br>
In this way, when the peak temperature T is controlled so as to be in a definite range during the operation, the change of the peak temperature T can be made smaller, that is, by avoiding a concentration of the load on the catalyst having the decreased activity, thereby the activity of catalyst can be suppressed from locally decreasing. Accordingly, for a long time,<br><br>
(meth)acrylic  acid  or  (meth)acrolein  can  be  stably produced with high yield.<br>
In order to make the peak temperature T during operation satisfy the equation 1, it is desirable to control the peak temperature T so that the difference between the peak temperature T and a temperature of the heat medium may be preferably in the range of 20 to 80°C, and more preferably in the range of 20 to 70°C.<br>
In what follows, a reaction method, a reactor, a catalyst and so on that are used to produce (meth) acrylic acid or (meth) acrolein by a gas phase catalytic oxidation of raw materials will be explained.<br>
Recently, amounts of production of acrylic acid from propylene and of methacrylic acid from isobutylene (they are called collectively (meth)acrylic acid) are rapidly expanding with an increase in the demands thereof. Accordingly, many plants are built all over the world and a scale of production of each plant has been enlarged to one hundred thousand tons or more per year. Enlargement of the scale of production of the plant is the reason for necessity to enlarge an amount of production of each oxidation reactor. Accordingly, a load on a gas phase catalytic oxidation reactor used for propane, propylene, or isobutylene and a catalyst used has become heavy. In connection with this, an operational condition that can maintain stability of the catalyst under a heavy load is<br><br>
in demand.<br>
In the invention, a method in which with a multi-tubular reactor that includes a cylindrical reactor shell having a raw material supply port and a product discharge port; a plurality of circular conduits that is disposed outside of the cylindrical reactor shell and used to introduce or take a heat medium in or out of the cylindrical reactor shell; circular devices connecting the plurality of circular conduits each other; a plurality of reaction tubes that is restrained by a plurality of tube plates of the reactor and contains a catalyst; and a plurality of baffle plates for altering a direction of a heat medium introduced in the reactor shell in a longer direction of the reaction tube, a substance to be oxidized is oxidized with a molecular oxygen-containing gas according to gas phase catalytic oxidation is adopted, in the reaction tubes, an oxidation catalyst such as a Mo-Bi-based catalyst and/or a Mo-V-based catalyst being filled^--<br>
The invention is a gas phase catalytic oxidation method in which propylene, propane, isobutylene or (meth) acrolein or a mixture thereof as a substance to be oxidized is catalytically oxidized in gas phase with a molecular oxygen-containing gas to obtain (meth)acrolein or (meth)acrylic acid. From propylene, propane, and isobutylene, (meth) acrolein, (meth) acrylic acid or both thereof can be obtained. Furthermore, from (meth)acrolein,<br><br>
(meth)acrylic acid is obtained.<br>
In the invention, a "process gas" means a gas involving the gas phase catalytic oxidation such as a substance to be oxidized as a raw material gas, a gas containing molecular oxygen, and a product obtained. A "raw material" is synonymous with a substance to be oxidized. (Composition of raw material gas)<br>
In a multi-tubular reactor used for the gas phase catalytic oxidation, a gas mixture of at least one kind of substance to be oxidized of propylene, propane/ isobutylene, and (meth)acrolein as a raw material gas, a gas containing molecular oxygen and water vapor is mainly introduced into the reactor.<br>
In the invention, a concentration of a substance to be oxidized in a mixed gas is in a range of 6 to 10 mole %, that of oxygen is in a range of 1.5 to 2v5 mole times the concentration of7 the substance to be oxidized; and that of-water vapor is in a range of 0.8 to 5 mole times.  The mixed gas introduced is divided into each reaction tube, goes through the reaction tube, and reacts in the presence of an oxidation catalyst filled in the tube. (Multi-tubular reactor)<br>
A gas phase catalytic oxidation according to the invention that uses a fixed bed multi-tubular reactor is widely used when from at least one kind of substance to be<br><br>
oxidized of propylene, propane, isobutylene and (meth)acrolein, in the presence of a composite oxide catalyst, by use of molecular oxygen or a gas containing molecular oxygen, (meth)acrylic acid or (meth)acrolein is produced.<br>
The fixed bed mul ti-tubular reactor for use in the invention is one widely used industrially, and there is no particular restriction on it.<br>
A reactor or the like that can be used in the method of the invention will be explained with reference to Fig. 1. (Fig. 1)<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic cross sectional view showing one embodiment of a mul ti-tubular heat exchange type reactor that is used in a gas phase catalytic oxidation method according to the invention.<br>
To a shell 2 of the multi-tubular reactor, reaction tubes-- Ib and le- are - arranged fixed to-'the tube-plates :5a and 5b.   A raw material supply port from which a raw material gas is introduced and a product discharge port from which a product goes out are shown with 4a or 4b. When a flow of the process gas and that of the heat medium are in a counter current flow, there is no particular restriction on a flow direction of the process gas. However, in Fig. 1, because the flow direction of the heat medium in the reactor shell is shown as a climbing flow<br><br>
with an arrowhead, 4b denotes the raw material supply port. At an outer periphery of the reactor shell, a circular conduit 3a is arranged to introduce the heat medium. The heat medium that is pressurized by the circulation pump 7 of the heat medium goes up from the circular conduit 3a inside of the reactor shell. By arranging each of a plurality of baffle plates 6a having windows near the center of the reactor shell and each of a plurality of baffle plates 6b having a window at the outer periphery of the reactor shell in an alternate manner, the flow direction is changed and the heat medium returns from the circular conduit 3b to the circular pump. Part of the heat medium that has absorbed the reaction heat goes out from a discharge pipe disposed at a top portion of the circular pump 7, is cooled with a heat exchanger (now shown in the drawing), and is introduced again from a heat medium supply line 8a into the reactor. A temperature of the heat medium is controlled when either-a temperature or-a flow rate of a refluxed heat medium introduced from the heat medium supply line 8a is controlled to control a thermometer 14.<br>
The temperature control of the heat medium is, though depending on the performance of the catalyst used, carried out so that difference of temperatures of the heat medium in the heat medium supply line 8a and the heat medium in the heat medium discharge line 8b may be in the range of 1<br><br>
to 10°C, and preferably in the range of 2 to 6°C.<br>
Thermometers 11 are inserted into the reaction tubes arranged in the reactor, signals are transmitted outside of the reactor, and thereby a temperature distribution of the catalyst layer in tube axis direction of the reactor is recorded. A thermometer is inserted in each of a plurality of the reaction tubes, and with one thermometer, in a tube axis direction, normally, at 5 points and more, preferably at 10 points and more, and more preferably at 20 points and more, temperatures are observed. A thermometer that has a variable temperature measurement portion and can measure at infinite points may be used. (Catalyst)<br>

In the present example, a multi-tubular reactor same as that shown in Fig. 1 was used.<br>
Specifically, a multi-tubular reactor having 10,000 stainless steel-made reaction tubes having a length of 3.5 m and an inner diameter of 27 mm was used.<br>
As a heat medium, molten salt of mixture of nitrates (niter) was used, supplied from a lower portion of the reactor and discharged from an upper portion thereof to circulate.<br>
The heat medium was partially discharged from 8b to<br>
cool, followed by returning to 8a. Thereby, a temperature<br>
of the heat medium supplied to the reactor was controlled<br>
and the temperature thereof was measured by use of a<br>
thermometer 15. ~:	.-•...• ......-.., ,,..<br>
-•••As-—a- catalyst- that is filled in eachr reaction - tube '•,--one which was obtained by blending the catalyst for a first half process and silica-made balls that have no catalytic activity and a diameter of 5.5 mm at a volume ratio of 7:3 was filled so that a packing layer height in each reaction tube might be 2.9 m.<br>
The raw material gas was supplied from the upper portion of the reactor so as to be a counterflow with respect to the heat medium, and at 60 kPa (gauge pressure)<br><br>
a raw material gas containing propylene at a concentration of 9.5 mol %, a molecular oxygen at a concentration of 14.5 mol %, water at 9.5 mol %, and nitrogen at 66.5 mol % (measuring interval: 80 mm on an upstream side and 240 mm on a downstream side) having 20 measurement points in a tube axis direction was inserted in each reaction tube to measure the temperature distribution. [Example]<br>
An operation was began by filling a catalyst produced newly in a way mentioned above in a reactor and supplying raw material propylene, and 1 month after that, a temperature of the heat medium at the entrance was set at a temperature of 335.2°C. At that time, the peak temperature of the catalyst layer was 390°C, a peak position was 220 mm from the entrance of the catalyst layer, a reaction conversion rate of raw material propylene was 98.3 %, and a total yield of the acrylic acid- and acrolein - was 92.6 %. In addition) -the1 peak -temperature and the peak position of the catalyst layer were calculated, from the maximum temperature of the multipoint thermometer used for the temperature measurement and temperatures measured at positions before and after that position, by use of a quadratic function passing these three points.<br>
On the basis of the condition (T0 = 394°C and X0 = 220 mm) , the operation was continued with the temperature of<br><br>
the heat medium controlling so that the temperature rise of the peak temperature might be in a range of L x { | T-Tol/(X-X0) } = 60 ± 10.<br>
After 11 months since the beginning of the operation, a temperature of the heat medium at the entrance was 335.6°C, the peak temperature of the catalyst layer was 392.4°C, the peak position was 320 mm (L x { | T-T01 / (X-Xo) } = 58) from the entrance side of the catalyst layer, the reaction conversion rate of raw material propylene was 98.0 % and a total yield of acrylic acid and acrolein was 92.2 %.<br>
When a continuous operation for 11 months was repeated three times with one-month stop period interposed therebetween, a temperature of the heat medium at the entrance was 337.1°C, the peak temperature of the catalyst layer was 399.5°C, the peak position was 550 mm (L x { | T-To I / (X-Xo)} = 58) from the entrance side of the catalyst layer, they reaction conversion rate of raw material propylene was 97.4 % and a total yield of acrylic acid and acrolein was 90.4 %.<br>
[Comparative Example]<br>
An operation of the reactor was begun similarly to the example.  After 1 month had passed<br>
since the beginning of the operation, a temperature of the heat medium at the entrance was set at a temperature of<br><br>
335.0°C. At that time, the peak temperature of the catalyst layer was 388°C, the peak position was 230 mm from the entrance of the catalyst layer, the reaction conversion rate of raw material propylene was 98.4 % and the total yield of acrylic acid and acrolein was 92.7 %.<br>
On the basis of the condition mentioned above (T0 = 388°C and Xo = 230 mm) , the operation was continued with the temperature of the heat medium regulated so that the reaction conversion rate of raw material propylene might be 98.2 ± 0.3 %.<br>
After 11 months passed since the beginning of operation, the temperature of the heat medium at the entrance was 336.2°C, the peak temperature of the catalyst layer was 393.0°C, the peak position was 260 mm (L x { | T-Tol/(X-Xo)} = 580) from the entrance of the catalyst layer, and the total yield of acrylic acid and acrolein was 91-.-9-"%.-:••<br>
Furthermore, after a continuous operation- for 1-1--months was repeated three times with a stop period of 1 month interposed therebetween, the temperature of the heat medium at the entrance was 341.9°C, the peak temperature of the catalyst layer was 405.4°C, the peak position was 240 mm (L x { | T-T01 / (X-Xo) } = 609) from the entrance of the catalyst layer, and the total yield of acrylic acid and acrolein decreased to 87.8 %.<br><br>
While the invention has been detailed in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.<br>
