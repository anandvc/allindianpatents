IMPROVED INHIBITORS FOR THE SOLUBLE EPOXIDE<br>
HYDROLASE<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001]    This application claims the benefit of U.S. Patent Application No. 60/651,487, filed<br>

STATEMENT AS TO RIGHTS TO INVENTIONS MADE UNDER<br>
FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT<br>
[0002]    The U.S. Government has certain rights to the invention pursuant to contract<br>
ES02710 awarded by the National Institutes of Health.<br>

PROGRAM LISTING APPENDIX SUBMITTED ON A COMPACT DISK.<br>
[0003]    NOT APPLICABLE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]    Epoxide hydrolases (EHs, EC 3.3.2.3) catalyze the hydrolysis of epoxides or arene<br>
oxides to their corresponding diols by the addition of water (see, Oesch, F., et al.,<br>
Xenobiotica 1973, 3, 305-340). Some EHs play an important role in the metabolism of a<br>
variety of compounds including hormones, chemotherapeutic drugs, carcinogens,<br>
environmental pollutants, mycotoxins, and other harmful foreign compounds.<br>
[0005]    There are two well-studied EHs, microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) and soluble<br>
epoxide hydrolase (sEH). These en2ymes are very distantly related, have different<br>
subcellular localization, and have different but partially overlapping substrate selectivities.<br>
The soluble and microsomal EH forms are known to complement each other in degrading<br>
some plant natural products (see, Hammock, B.D., et al., COMPREHENSIVE<br>
TOXICOLOGY. Oxford: Pergamon Press 1977,283-305 and Fretland, A.J., et al., Chem.<br>
Biol. Intereract 2000,129, 41-59).<br>
[0006]    The major role of the sEH is in the metabolism of lipid epoxides including the<br>
metabolism of arachidonic acid (see, Zeldin, D.C., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1993, 268, 6402-<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                                   PCT/US2005/038282<br>
2<br>
6407), linoleic (see, Moghaddam, M.F., et al, Nat. Med. 1991,3, 562-567) acid, some of<br>
which are endogenous chemical mediators (see, Carroll, M.A., et al., Thorax 2000,55, S13-<br>
16). Epoxides of arachidonic acid (epoxyeicosatrienoic acids or EETs) and other lipid<br>
epoxides and diols are known effectors of blood pressure (see, Capdevila, J.H., et al., J. Lipid.<br>
Res. 2000, 41,163-181), and modulators of vascular permeability (see, Oltman, C.L., et al.,<br>
Circ Res. 1998, 83, 932-939). The vasodilatory properties of EETs are associated with an<br>
increased open-state probability of calcium-activated potassium channels leading to<br>
hyperpolarization of the vascular smooth muscle (see Fisslthaler, B., et al., Nature 1999,401,<br>
493-497). Hydrolysis of the arachidonate epoxides by sEH diminishes this activity (see,<br>
Capdevila, J.H., et al., J. Lipid. Res. 2000, 41,163-181). sEH hydrolysis of EETs also<br>
regulates their incorporation into coronary endothelial phospholipids, suggesting a regulation<br>
of endothelial function by sEH (see, Weintraub, N.L., et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1992, 277,<br>
H2098-2108), It has recently been shown that treatment of spontaneous hypertensive rats<br>
(SHRs) with selective sEH inhibitors significantly reduces their blood pressure (see, Yu, Z.,<br>
et al., Circ. Res. 2000, 87, 992-998). In addition, male knockout sEH mice have significantly<br>
lower blood pressure than wild-type mice (see Sinal, C.J., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2000,275,<br>
40504-405010), further supporting the role of sEH in blood pressure regulation.<br>
[0007]    The EETs have also demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties in endothelial cells<br>
(see, Node, K., et al., Science 1999, 285,1276-1279 and Campbell, W.B. Trends Pharmacol.<br>
Sci. 2000, 21,125-127). In contrast, diols derived from epoxy-linoleate (leukotoxin) perturb<br>
membrane permeability and calcium homeostasis (see, Moghaddam, M.F., et al., Nat. Med.<br>
1997, 3, 562-567), which results in inflammation that is modulated by nitric oxide synthase<br>
and endothelin-1 (see, Ishizaki, T.? et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1995,269, L65-70 and Ishizaki, T.,<br>
et al., J. Appl. Physiol. 1995, 79, 1106-1611). Micromolar concentrations of leukotoxin<br>
reported in association with inflammation and hypoxia (see, Dudda, A., et al., Chem. Phys.<br>
Lipids 1996, 82, 39-51), depress mitochondrial respiration in vitro (see, Sakai, T., et al., Am.<br>
J. Physiol. 1995, 269, L3 26-3 31), and cause mammalian cardiopulmonary toxicity in vivo<br>
(see, Ishizaki, T., et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1995, 269, L65-70; Fukushima, A., et al., Cardiovasc.<br>
Res. 1988, 22, 213-218; and Ishizaki, T., et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1995, 268, L123-128).<br>
Leukotoxin toxicity presents symptoms suggestive of multiple organ failure and acute<br>
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (see, Ozawa, T. et al., Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1988,<br>
137, 535-540). In both cellular and organismal models, leukotoxin-mediated toxicity is<br>
dependent upon epoxide hydrolysis (see, Moghaddam, M.F., et al., Nat. Med. 1997, 3, 562-<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>

567; Morisseau, C., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 1999, 96, 8849-8854; and Zheng, J., et<br>
al., Am. J. Respir. CellMol. Biol. 2001, 25,434-438), suggesting a role for sEH in the<br>
regulation of inflammation and vascular permeability. The bioactivity of these epoxy-fatty<br>
acids suggests that inhibition of vicnal-dihydroxy-lipid biosynthesis may have therapeutic<br>
value, making sEH a promising pharmacological target.<br>
[0008]    Recently, 1,3-disubstituted ureas, carbamates, and amides have been reported as<br>
new potent and stable inhibitors of sEH (Figure 1). See, U.S. Patent No. 6,150,415.<br>
Compounds 192 and 686 are representative structures for this type of inhibitors (Figure 1).<br>
These compounds are competitive tight-binding inhibitors with nanomolar KJ values that<br>
interact stoichiometrically with purified recombinant sEH (see, Morisseau, C, et al., Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1999, 96, 8849-8854). Based on the X-ray crystal structure, the urea<br>
inhibitors were shown to establish hydrogen bonds and to form salt bridges between the urea<br>
function of the inhibitor and residues of the sEH active site, mimicking features encountered<br>
in the reaction coordinate of epoxide ring opening by this enzyme (see, Argiriadi, M.A., et<br>
al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1999, 96,10637-10642 and Argiriadi, M.A., et al., J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 2000, 275,15265-15270). These inhibitors efficiently reduced epoxide hydrolysis in<br>
several in vitro and in vivo models (see, Yu, Z., et al., Circ. Res. 2000, 87, 992-998;<br>
Morisseau, C, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1999, 96, 8849-8854; and Newman, J.W., et<br>
al., Environ. Health Perspect. 2001, 109, 61-66). Despite the high activity associated with<br>
these inhibitors, there exists a need for compounds possessing similar or increased activities,<br>
with improved solubility and pharmacokinetic properties to facilitate formulation and<br>
delivery.<br>
[0009]    Surprisingly, the present invention provides such compounds along with methods<br>
for their use and compositions that contain them.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0019]    Figure 1 provides structures of known sEH inhibitors having only a primary<br>
pharmacophore: l-adamantyl-3-cyclohexylurea (192), l-adamantyl-3-dodecylurea (686).<br>
[0020]    Figure 2 provides a structural diagram defining the sEH inhibitors primary,<br>
secondary, and tertiary pharmacophores. The nomenclature used refers to the three<br>
pharmacophores and two substituents (R and R' groups). The secondary and tertiary<br>
pharmacophores located in the R' area are illustrated linearly from the primary<br>
pharmacophore. The secondary pharmacophore generally consists of a polar carbonyl group<br>
or a polar ether group. When the secondary pharmacophore is a carbonyl group, it is located<br>
about 7.5 ± 1 A from the carbonyl of the primary pharmacophore, with either side of the<br>
carbonyl (X and Y) being a CH2, O or NH. When the secondary pharmacophore is a ether<br>
group it is preferably located about 1 carbon unit further from the carbonyl of the primary<br>
pharmacophore. The tertiary pharmacophore is also a polar group located approximately 11<br>
carbon units (17 ± 1 Å) from the carbonyl of the primary pharmacophore with the Z group as<br>
an OH, or a substituted amine or alcohol or a heterocyclic or acyclic structure mimicing the<br>
terminal ester or acid.<br>
[0021]    Figure 3 provides a hydrophobicity map of the mouse sEH substrate binding pocket<br>
co-crystalyzed with the inhibitor l-cyclohexyl-3-dodecyl urea. A shading gradient indicates<br>
degrees of hydrophobicity. A series of hydrophilic residues were observed on the "top" side<br>
of the channel, while the "bottom" of the channel was very hydrophobic, with the exception<br>
of the catalytic aspartate (Asp333). This structural analysis indicated that a number of<br>
potential hydrogen bonding sites are observed in the substrate binding pocket of the soluble<br>
epoxide hydrolase, primarily located on the surface opposite Asp333 (the catalytic nucleophile<br>
which reacts with the substrate or binds to the primary pharmacophores).<br>
[0022]    Figure 4 provides mammalian soluble epoxide hydrolase protein sequence<br>
alignments (residue 1-340).<br>
[0023]    Figure 5 provides mammalian soluble epoxide hydrolase protein sequence<br>
alignments (residue 341-554).<br>
[0024]    Figure 6 is a graph illustrating the metabolic stabilities of l-adamantyl-3-dodecyl<br>
urea (686) and 1-cyclohexyl- 3-dodecyl urea (297) in rat hepatic microsomes. Microsomes<br><br>

are expressed as mean ± SD of triplicate experiments.<br>
[0025]    Figure 7 is a graph illustrating.the metabolic stabilities of 686 and 687 in rat hepatic<br>
microsomes as described above.<br>
[0026]    Figure 8 is a series of graphs illustrating the metabolic conversion of 1 -adamantyl-<br>
3-dodecyl urea (686) in microsomal preparations from rat, mouse, and human hepatic tissues.<br>
The metabolites identified are the omega hydroxyl (686-M1), the omega aldehyde (686-M2),<br>
the omega acid (687), and a mixture of monohydroxy adamantyl omega hydroxylated<br>

[0027]    Figure 9 provides a mass spectrum showing collision induced dissociation of a<br>
dominant urinary metabolite of  l-adamantyl-3-dodecyl urea (686) and the 3-dodecanoic acid<br>
analog (687) suggesting that these compounds can ultimately enter beta-oxidation to produce<br>
chain shortened inhibitors.<br>
[0028]    Figure 10 is a graph illustrating the blood concentration vs. time profiles of 687<br>
after oral administration of 5 mg/kg of either 687 or 800 to mice. The ester compound delays<br>
the time to achieve the maximum circulating dose, and increases the maximum circulating<br>
concentration of 687 observed. This translates into a longer half-life for the inhibitor.<br>

observed. This translates into a longer half-life for the inhibitor.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Abbreviations and Definitions:<br>
[0036]    "cis-Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids" ("EETs") are biomediators synthesized by<br>
cytochrome P450 epoxygenases.<br>
[0037]    "Epoxide hydrolases" ("EH;" EC 3.3.2.3) are enzymes in the alpha / beta hydrolase<br>
fold family that add water to 3 membered cyclic ethers termed epoxides.<br>
[0038]    "Soluble epoxide hydrolase" ("sEH") is an enzyme which in endothelial, smooth<br>
muscle and other cell types converts EETs to dihydroxy derivatives called<br>
dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids ("DHETs"). The cloning and sequence of the murine sEH is<br>
set forth in Grant et al, J. Biol Chem. 268(23):17628-17633 (1993). The cloning, sequence,<br>
and accession numbers of the human sEH sequence are set forth in Beetham et al., Arch.<br>
Biochem. Biophys. 305(1): 197-201 (1993). The amino acid sequence of human sEH is also<br>
set forth as SEQ ID NO.2 of U.S. Patent No. 5,445,956; the nucleic acid sequence encoding<br>
the human sEH is set forth as nucleotides 42-1703 of SEQ ID NO:1 of that patent The<br>
evolution and nomenclature of the gene is discussed in Beetham et al., DNA Cell Biol.<br>
14(1):61-71 (1995). Soluble epoxide hydrolase represents a single highly conserved gene<br>
product with over 90% homology between rodent and human (Arand et al., FEBS Lett.,<br>
338:251-256 (1994)).<br>
[0039]    The terms "treat", "treating" and "treatment" refer to any method of alleviating or<br>
abrogating a disease or its attendant symptoms.<br>
[0040]    The term "therapeutically effective amount" refers to that amount of the compound<br>
being administered sufficient to prevent or decrease the development of one or more of the<br>
symptoms of the disease, condition or disorder being treated.<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>

[0041]    The term "modulate" refers to the ability of a compound to increase or decrease the<br>
function, or activity, of the associated activity (e.g., soluble epoxide hydrolase).<br>
"Modulation", as used herein in its various forms, is meant to include antagonism and partial<br>
antagonism of the activity associated with sEH. Inhibitors of sEH are compounds that, e.g.,<br>
bind to, partially or totally block the enzyme's activity.<br>
[0042]    The term "compound" as used herein is intended to encompass not only the<br>
specified molecular entity but also its pharmaceutically acceptable, pharmacologically active<br>
derivatives, including, but not limited to, salts, prodrug conjugates such as esters and amides,<br>
metabolites and the like.<br>
[0043]    The term "composition" as used herein is intended to encompass a product<br>
comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which<br>
results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified<br>
amounts. By "pharmaceutically acceptable" it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must<br>
be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the<br>
recipient thereof.<br>
[0044]    The "subject" is defined herein to include animals such as mammals, including, but<br>
not limited to, primates (e.g., humans), cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, rats,<br>
mice and the like. In some embodiments, the subject is a human.<br>
[0045]    As used herein, the term "sEH-mediated disease or condition" and the like refers to<br>
a disease or condition characterized by less than or greater than normal, sEH activity. A<br>
sEH-mediated disease or condition is one in which modulation of sEH results in some effect<br>
on the underlying condition or disease (e.g., a sEH inhibitor or antagonist results in some<br>
improvement in patient well-being in at least some patients).<br>
[0046]    "Parenchyma" refers to the tissue characteristic of an organ, as distinguished from<br>
associated connective or supporting tissues.<br>
[0047]    "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease" or "COPD" is also sometimes known as<br>
"chronic obstructive airway disease", "chronic obstructive lung disease", and "chronic<br>
airways disease." COPD is generally defined as a disorder characterized by reduced maximal<br>
expiratory flow and slow forced emptying of the lungs. COPD is considered to encompass<br>
two related conditions, emphysema and chronic bronchitis. COPD can be diagnosed by the<br>
general practitioner using art recognized techniques, such as the patient's forced vital capacity<br>
("FVC"), the maximum volume of air that can be forceably expelled after a maximal<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>
11<br>
inhalation. In the offices of general practitioners, the FVC is typically approximated by a 6<br>
second maximal exhalation through a spirometer. The definition, diagnosis and treatment of<br>
COPD, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis are well known in the art and discussed in detail<br>
by, for example, Honig and Ingram, in Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, (Fauci et<br>
al., Eds.), 14th Ed., 1998, McGraw-Hill, New York, pp. 1451-1460 (hereafter, "Harrison's<br>
Principles of Internal Medicine").<br>
[0048]    "Emphysema" is a disease of the lungs characterized by permanent destructive<br>
enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles without obvious fibrosis.<br>
[0049]    "Chronic bronchitis" is a disease of the lungs characterized by chronic bronchial<br>
secretions which last for most days of a month, for three months a year, for two years.<br>
[0050]    As the names imply, "obstructive pulmonary disease" and "obstructive lung disease"<br>
refer to obstructive diseases, as opposed to restrictive diseases. These diseases particularly<br>
include COPD, bronchial asthma and small airway disease.<br>
[0051]    "Small airway disease." There is a distinct minority of patients whose airflow<br>
obstruction is due, solely or predominantly to involvement of the small airways. These are<br>
defined as airways less than 2 mm in diameter and correspond to small cartilaginous bronchi,<br>
terminal bronchioles and respiratory bronchioles. Small airway disease (SAD) represents<br>
luminal obstruction by inflammatory and fibrotic changes that increase airway resistance.<br>
The obstruction may be transient or permanent.<br>
[0052]    The "interstitial lung diseases (ILDs)" are a group of conditions involving the<br>
alveolar walls, perialveolar tissues, and contiguous supporting structures. As discussed on<br>
the website of the American Lung Association, the tissue between the air sacs of the lung is<br>
the interstitium, and this is the tissue affected by fibrosis in the disease. Persons with the<br>
disease have difficulty breathing in because of the stiffness of the lung tissue but, in contrast<br>
to persons with obstructive lung disease, have no difficulty breathing out. The definition,<br>
diagnosis and treatment of interstitial lung diseases are well known in the art and discussed in<br>
detail by, for example, Reynolds, H.Y., in Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, supra,<br>
at pp. 1460-1466. Reynolds notes that, while ILDs have various initiating events, the<br>
immunopathological responses of lung tissue are limited and the ILDs therefore have<br>
common features.<br>
[0053]    "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis," or "IPF," is considered the prototype ILD.<br>
Although it is idiopathic in that the cause is not known, Reynolds, supra, notes that the term<br>
refers to a well defined clinical entity.<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>

[0054]    "Bronchoalveolar lavage," or "BAL," is a test which permits removal and<br>
examination of cells from the lower respiratory tract and is used in humans as a diagnostic<br>
procedure for pulmonary disorders such as IPF. In human patients, it is usually performed<br>
during bronchoscopy.<br>
[0055]    As used herein, the term "alkyl" refers to a saturated hydrocarbon radical which may<br>
be straight-chain or branched-chain (for example, ethyl, isopropyl, t-amyl, or 2,5-<br>
dimethylhexyl). This definition applies both when the term is used alone and when it is used<br>
as part of a compound term, such as "aralkyl," "alkylamino" and similar terms. In some<br>
embodiments, alkyl groups are those containing 1 to 24 carbon atoms. All numerical ranges<br>
in this specification and claims are intended to be inclusive of their upper and lower limits.<br>
Lower alkyl refers to those alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Additionally, the alkyl<br>
and heteroalkyl groups may be attached to other moieties at any position on the alkyl or<br>
heteroalkyl radical which would otherwise be occupied by a hydrogen atom (such as, for<br>
example, 2-pentyl, 2-methylpent-l-yl and 2-propyloxy). Divalent alkyl groups may be<br>
referred to as "alkylene", and divalent heteroalkyl groups may be referred to as<br>
"heteroalkylene" such as those groups used as linkers in the present invention. The alkyl,<br>
alkylene, and heteroalkyl moieties may also be optionally substituted with halogen atoms, or<br>
other groups such as oxo, cyano, nitro, alkyl, alkylamino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, alkoxy,<br>
aryloxy, and the like.<br>
[0056]    The terms "cycloalkyl" and "cycloalkenyl" refer to a saturated hydrocarbon ring and<br>
includes bicyclic and polycyclic rings. Similarly, cycloalkyl and cycloalkenyl groups having<br>
a heteroatom (e.g. N, O or S) in place of a carbon ring atom may be referred to as<br>
"heterocycloalkyl" and heterocycloalkylene," respectively. Examples of cycloalkyl and<br>
heteroaryl groups are, for example, cyclohexyl, norbornyl, adamantly, morpholinyl,<br>
thiomorpholinyl, dioxothiomorphorinyl, and the like. The cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl<br>
moieties may also be optionally substituted with halogen atoms, or other groups such as nitro,<br>
alkyl, alkylamino, carboxyl, alkoxy, aryloxy and the like. In some embodiments, cycloalkyl<br>
and cycloalkenyl moieties are those having 3 to 12 carbon atoms in the ring (e.g., cyclohexyl,<br>
cyclooctyl, norbornyl, adamantyl, and the like). In some embodiments, heterocycloalkyl and<br>
heterocycloalkylene moieties are those having 1 to 3 hetero atoms in the ring (e.g.,<br>
morpholinyl, Momorpholinyl, dioxothiomorphonnyl, piperidinyl and the like). Additionally,<br>
the term "(cycloalkyl)alkyl" refers to a group having a cycloalkyl moiety attached to an alkyl<br>
moiety. Examples are cyclohexylmethyl, cyclohexylethyl and cyclopentylpropyl.<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>

[0057]    The term "alkenyl" as used herein refers to an alkyl group as described above which<br>
contains one or more sites of unsaturation that is a double bond. Similarly, the term<br>
"alkynyl" as used herein refers to an alkyl group as described above which contains one or<br>
more sites of unsaturation that is a triple bond.<br>
[0058]    The term "alkoxy" refers to an alkyl radical as described above which also bears an<br>
oxygen substituent which is capable of covalent attachment to another hydrocarbon radical<br>
(such as, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, aryloxy and t-butoxy).<br>
[0059]    The term "aryl" refers to an aromatic carbocyclic substituent which may be a single<br>
ring or multiple rings which are fused together, linked covalently or linked to a common<br>
group such as an ethylene or methylene moiety. Similarly, aryl groups having a heteroatom<br>
(e.g. N, O or S) in place of a carbon ring atom are referred to as "heteroaryl". Examples of<br>
aryl and heteroaryl groups are, for example, phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl, diphenylmethyl, 2,2-<br>
diphenyl-1-ethyl, thienyl, pyridyl and quinoxalyl. The aryl and heteroaryl moieties may also<br>
be optionally substituted with halogen atoms, or other groups such as nitro, alkyl, alkylamino,<br>
carboxyl, alkoxy, phenoxy and the like. Additionally, the aryl and heteroaryl groups may be<br>
attached to other moieties at any position on the aryl or heteroaryl radical which would<br>
otherwise be occupied by a hydrogen atom (such as, for example, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl and 4-<br>
pyridyl). Divalent aryl groups are "arylene", and divalent heteroaryl groups are referred to as<br>
"heteroarylene" such as those groups used as linkers in the present invention.<br>
[0060]    The terms "arylalkyl", "arylalkenyl" and "aryloxyalkyl" refer to an aryl radical<br>
attached directly to an alkyl group, an alkenyl group, or an oxygen which is attached to an<br>
alkyl group, respectively. For brevity, aryl as part of a combined term as above, is meant to<br>
include heteroaryl as well.<br>
[0061]    The terms "halo" or "halogen," by themselves or as part of another substituent,<br>
mean, unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally,<br>
terms such as "haloalkyl," are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl. For<br>
example, the term "C1-C6 haloalkyl" is mean to include trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl,<br>
4-chlorobutyl, 3-bromopropyl, and the like.<br>
[0062]    The term "hetero" as used in a "heteroatom-containing alkyl group" (a "heteroalkyl"<br>
group) or a "heteroatom-containing aryl group" (a "heteroaryl" group) refers to a molecule,<br>
linkage or substituent in which one or more carbon atoms are replaced with an atom other<br>
than carbon, e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus or silicon, typically nitrogen, oxygen<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>

or sulfur or more thatnone non-carbon atom (e.g., sulfonamide). Similarly, the term<br>
"heteroalkyl" refers to an alkyl substituent that is heteroatom-containing, the term<br>
"heterocyclic" refers to a cyclic substituent that is heteroatom-containing, the terms<br>
"heteroaryl" and heteroaromatic" respectively refer to "aryl" and "aromatic" substituents that<br>
are heteroatom-containing, and the like. Examples of heteroalkyl groups include alkoxyaryl,<br>
alkylsulfanyl-substituted alkyl, N-alkylated amino alkyl, and the like. Examples of heteroaryl<br>
substituents include pyrrolyl, pyrrolidinyl, pyridinyl, quinolinyl, indolyl, pyrimidinyl,<br>
imidazolyl, 1,2,4-triazolyl, tetrazolyl, etc., and examples of heteroatom-containing alicyclic<br>
groups are pyrrolidino, morpholino, piperazino, piperidino, etc.<br>
[0063]    The term "hydrophobic radical" or "hydrophobic group" refers to a group which<br>
lowers the water solubility of a molecule. In some embodiments, hydrophobic radicals are<br>
groups containing at least 3 carbon atoms.<br>
[0064]    The term "carboxylic acid analog" refers to a variety of groups having an acidic<br>
moiety that are capable of mimicking a carboxylic acid residue. Examples of such groups are<br>
sulfonic acids, sulflnic acids, phosphoric acids, phosphonic acids, phosphinic acids,<br>
sulfonamides, and heterocyclic moieties such as, for example, imidazoles, triazoles and<br>
tetrazoles.<br>
[0065]    The term "substituted" refers to the replacement of an atom or a group of atoms of a<br>
compound with another atom or group of atoms. For example, an atom or a group of atoms<br>
may be substituted with one or more of the following substituents or groups: halo, cyano,<br>
nitro, alkyl, alkylamino, hydroxyalkyl, haloalkyl, carboxyl, hydroxyl, alkoxy, alkoxyalkoxy,<br>
haloalkoxy, thioalkyl, aryl, aryloxy, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl optionally<br>

alkylaminosulfonyl, dialkylaminosulfonyl and arylaminosulfonyl. When the term<br>
"substituted" appears prior to a list of possible substituted groups, it is intended that the term<br>
apply to every member of that group.<br>
[0066]    The term "unsubstituted" refers to a native compound that lacks replacement of an<br>
atom or a group of atoms.<br>
General:<br>
[0067]    The present invention derives from the discovery that 1,3-disubstituted ureas (or the<br>
corresponding amides or carbamates, also referred to as the primary pharmacophore) can be<br>
further functionalized to provide more potent sEH inhibitors with improved physical<br>
properties. As described herein, the introduction of secondary and/or tertiary<br>
pharmacophores can increase water solubility and oral availability of sEH inhibitors (see<br>
Figure 2). The combination of the three pharmacophores (see the compounds of Table 18)<br>
provides a variety of compounds of increased water solubility.<br>
[0068]    The discovery of the secondary and tertiary pharmacophores has also led to the<br>
employment of combinatorial chemistry approaches for establishing a wide spectrum of<br>
compounds having sEH inhibitory activity. The polar pharmacophores divide the molecule<br>
into domains each of which can be easily manipulated by common chemical approaches in a<br>
combinatorial manner, leading to the design and confirmation of novel orally available<br>
therapeutic agents for the treatment of diseases such as hypertension and vascular<br>
inflammation. The agents of the present invention treat such diseases while simultaneously<br>
increasing sodium excretion, reducing vascular and renal inflammation, and reducing male<br>
erectile dysfunction As shown below (see Example 51 and Figure 13), alterations in<br>
solubility, bioavailability and pharmacological properties leads to compounds that can alter<br>
the regulatory lipids of experimental animals increasing the relative amounts of epoxy<br>
arachidonate derivatives when compared either to their diol products or to the<br>
proinflammatory and hypertensive hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). Since epoxy<br>
arachidonates are anti-hypertensive and anti-inflammatory, altering the lipid ratios can lead to<br>
reduced blood pressure and reduced vascular and renal inflammation. This approach has<br>
been validated in a patient approaching end stage renal disease (ESRD) where even a brief<br>
oral treatment with low doses compound 800 altered the serum profile of regulatory lipids in<br>
a positive manner. This resulted in reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure, a dramatic<br><br>

reduction in blood urea nitrogen (an indicator of renal inflammation) and dramatically<br>
reduced serum levels of C reactive protein (a common indicator of vascular inflammation).<br>
[0069]    Without intending to be bound by theory, and with reference to Figures 2, 3, 4 and<br>
5, it is believed that the left side of the primary pharmacophore or R (in Figure 2) can be<br>
varied to obtain optimal properties as can the primary pharmacophore, which contains groups<br>
able to hydrogen bond to the catalytic aspartic acid on one side and the catalytic tyrosines on<br>
the other (see Figure 3). The right side of the primary pharmacophore is effectively divided<br>
into 4 segments: a spacer separating the primary and secondary pharmacophore (termed L1 in<br>
the present invention), the secondary pharmacophore (termed P2 in the present invention)<br>
and a tertiary pharmacophore (P3) flanked by a spacer (L2) and finally a terminating group Z<br>
(collectively provided with the tertiary pharmacophore as P3). The spacer between the<br>
primary and secondary pharmacophores, is optimally 3 atom units in length, while the<br>
secondary pharmacophore can be, for example, a ketone, carbonate, amide, carbamate, urea,<br>
ether/polyether, ester or other functionality able to form a hydrogen bond with the enzyme<br>
approximately 7.5 angstroms from the carbonyl of the primary pharmacophore. The<br>
identified tertiary pharmacophore consists of a polar group located approximately six to<br>
eleven carbon units from the primary pharmacophore (see Figure 2). A conserved asparagine<br>
residue (Asn471, see Figures 4 and 5) is thought to provide the site of interaction between the<br>
protein and the polar functionality located at this tertiary site. While, in the rodent a<br>
threonine (Thr468) is also in an appropriate position for hydrogen bonding, residue 468 is a<br>
methionine in the human enzyme (Figure 5). As with the secondary pharmacophore, this<br>
group improves water solubility of sEH inhibitors as well as the specificity for the sEH, and a<br>
wide diversity of functionalities such as an ester, amide, carbamate, or similar functionalities<br>
capable of donating or accepting a hydrogen bond similarly can contribute to this polar<br>
group. For example, in pharmaceutical chemistry heterocyclic groups are commonly used to<br>
mimic carbonyls as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. Of course the primary, secondary<br>
and tertiary pharmacophore groups can be combined in a single molecule with suitable<br>
spacers to improve activity or present the inhibitor as a prodrug.<br>
[0070]    Figure 11 illustrates the binding interaction for structural evaluation of conserved<br>
hydrogen bond donors in the sEH substrate binding pocket with linear distances to the<br>
primary pharmacophore noted. The table below provides specific distances to residues<br>

vascular smooth muscle. Accordingly, the epoxy lipids are anti-inflammatory and anti-<br>
hypertensive. Additionally, the lipids are thought to be metabolized by beta-oxidation, as<br>
well as by epoxide hydration. The soluble epoxide hydrolase is considered to be the major<br>
enzyme involved in the hydrolytic metabolism of these oxylipins. The compounds of<br>
formula (I) can inhibit the epoxide hydrolase and stabilize the epoxy lipids both in vitro and<br>
in vivo. This activity results in a reduction of hypertension in four separate rodent models.<br>
Moreover, the inhibitors show a reduction in renal inflammation associated with and<br>
independent of the hypertensive models.<br>
[0094]    More particularly, the present invention provides methods for monitoring a variety<br>
of lipids in both the arachidonate and linoleate cascade simultaneously in order to address the<br>
biology of the system. A GLC-MS system or a LC-MS method can be used to monitor over<br>
740 analytes in a highly quantitative fashion in a single injection. The analytes include the<br>
regioisomers of the arachidonate epoxides (EETs), the diols (DHETs), as well as other P450<br>
products including HETEs. Characteristic products of the cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and<br>
peroxidase pathways in both the arachidonate and linoleate series can also be monitored.<br>
Such methods are particularly useful as being predictive of certain disease states. The<br>
oxylipins can be monitored in mammals following the administration of inhibitors of epoxide<br><br>

hydrolase. Generally, EH inhibitors increase epoxy lipid concentrations at the expense of<br>
diol concentrations in body fluids and tissues.<br>
[0095]    Other compounds for use in this aspect of the invention are those inhibitors of<br>
formula (I) in which the primary pharmacophore is separated from a tertiary pharmacophore<br>
by a distance that approximates the distance between the terminal carboxylic acid and an<br>
epoxide functional group in the natural substrate.<br>
Methods of Treating Diseases Modulated by Soluble Epoxide Hvdrolases:<br>
[0096]    In another aspect, the present invention provides methods of treating diseases,<br>
especially those modulated by soluble epoxide hydrolases (sEH). The methods generally<br>
involve administering to a subject in need of such treatment an effective amount of a<br>
compound having a formula (I) above. The dose, frequency and timing of such administering<br>
will depend in large part on the selected therapeutic agent, the nature of the condition being<br>
treated, the condition of the subject including age, weight and presence of other conditions or<br>
disorders, the formulation being administered and the discretion of the attending physician.<br>
Preferably, the compositions and compounds of the invention and the pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts thereof are administered via oral, parenteral, subcutaneous, intramuscular,<br>
intravenous or topical routes. Generally, the compounds are administered in dosages ranging<br>
from about 2 mg up to about 2,000 mg per day, although variations will necessarily occur<br>
depending, as noted above, on the disease target, the patient, and the route of administration.<br>
Dosages are administered orally in the range of about 0.05 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg, more<br>
preferably in the range of about 0.05 mg/kg to about 2 mg/kg, most preferably in the range of<br>
about 0.05 mg/kg to about 0.2 mg per kg of body weight per day. The dosage employed for<br>
the topical administration will, of course, depend on the size of the area being treated.<br>
[0097]    It has previously been shown that inhibitors of soluble epoxide hydrolase ("sEH")<br>
can reduce hypertension. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,351,506. Such inhibitors can be useful<br>
in controlling the blood pressure of persons with undesirably high blood pressure, including<br>
those who suffer from diabetes.<br>
[0098] In some embodiments, compounds of formula (I) are administered to a subject in<br>
need of treatment for hypertension, specifically renal, hepatic, or pulmonary hypertension;<br>
inflammation, specifically renal inflammation, vascular inflammation, and lung<br><br>

disease; Raynaud syndrome and arthritis.<br>
Methods for Inhibiting Progression of Kidney Deterioration (Nephropathv) and<br>
Reducing Blood Pressnre:<br>
[0099]    In another aspect of the invention, the compounds of the invention can reduce<br>
damage to the kidney, and especially damage to kidneys from diabetes, as measured by<br>
albuminuria. The compounds of the invention can reduce kidney deterioration (nephropathy)<br>
from diabetes even in individuals who do not have high blood pressure. The conditions of<br>
therapeautic administration are as described above.<br>
[0100]    cis-Epoxyeicosantrienoic acids ("EETs") can be used in conjunction with the<br>
compounds of the invention to further reduce kidney damage. EETs, which are epoxides of<br>
arachidonic acid, are known to be effectors of blood pressure, regulators of inflammation,<br>
and modulators of vascular permeability. Hydrolysis of the epoxides by sEH diminishes this<br>
activity. Inhibition of sEH raises the level of EETs since the rate at which the EETs are<br>
hydrolyzed into DHETs is reduced. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed<br>
that raising the level of EETs interferes with damage to kidney cells by the microvasculature<br>
changes and other pathologic effects of diabetic hyperglycemia. Therefore, raising the EET<br>
level in the kidney is believed to protect the kidney from progression from microalbummuria<br>
to end stage renal disease.<br>
[0101]    EETs are well known in the art. EETs useful in the methods of the present<br>
invention include 14,15-EET, 8,9-EET and 11,12-EET, and 5,6 EETs, in that order of<br>
preference. Preferably, the EETs are administered as the methyl ester, which is more stable.<br>
Persons of skill will recognize that the EETs are regioisomers, such as 8S,9R- and 14R,15S-<br>
EET. 8,9-EET, 11,12-EET, and 14R,15S-EET, are commercially available from, for<br>
example, Sigma-Aldrich (catalog nos. E5516, E5641, and E5766, respectively, Sigma-<br>
Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO).<br>
[0102]    EETs produced by the endothelium have anti-hypertensive properties and the EETs<br>
11,12-EET and 14,15-EET may be endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors (EDHFs).<br>
Additionally, EETs such as 11,12-EET have profibrinolytic effects, anti-inflammatory actions<br>
and inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration. In the context of the present<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>
31<br>
invention, these favorable properties are believed to protect the vasculature and organs during<br>
renal and cardiovascular disease states.<br>
[0103]    It is now believed that sEH activity can be inhibited sufficiently to increase the<br>
levels of EETs and thus augment the effects of administering sEH inhibitors by themselves.<br>
This permits EETs to be used in conjunction with one or more sEH inhibitors to reduce<br>
nephropathy in the methods of the invention. It further permits EETs to be used in<br>
conjunction with one or more sEH inhibitors to reduce hypertension, or inflammation, or<br>
both. Thus, medicaments of EETs can be made which can be administered in conjunction<br>
with one or more sEH inhibitors, or a medicament containing one or more sEH inhibitors can<br>
optionally contain one or more EETs.<br>
[0104]    The EETs can be administered concurrently with the sEH inhibitor, or following<br>
administration of the sEH inhibitor. It is understood that, like all drugs, inhibitors have half<br>
lives defined by the rate at which they are metabolized by or excreted from the body, and that<br>
the inhibitor will have a period following administration during which it will be present in<br>
amounts sufficient to be effective. If EETs are administered after the inhibitor is<br>
administered, therefore, it is desirable that the EETs be administered during the period during<br>
which the inhibitor will be present in amounts to be effective to delay hydrolysis of the EETs.<br>
Typically, the EET or EETs will be administered within 48 hours of administering an sEH<br>
inhibitor. Preferably, the EET or EETs are administered within 24 hours of the inhibitor, and<br>
even more preferably within 12 hours. In increasing order of desirability, the EET or EETs<br>
are administered within 10, 8, 6,4, 2, hours, 1 hour, or one half hour after administration of<br>
the inhibitor. Most preferably, the EET or EETs are administered concurrently with the<br>
inhibitor.<br>
[0105]    In some embodiments, the EETs, the compound of the invention, or both, are<br>
provided in a material that permits them to be released over time to provide a longer duration<br>
of action. Slow release coatings are well known in the pharmaceutical art; the choice of the<br>
particular slow release coating is not critical to the practice of the present invention.<br>
[0106]    EETs are subject to degradation under acidic conditions. Thus, if the EETs are to be<br>
administered orally, it is desirable that they are protected from degradation in the stomach.<br>
Conveniently, EETs for oral administration may be coated to permit them to passage the<br>
acidic environment of the stomach into the basic environment of the intestines. Such<br>
coatings are well known in the art. For example, aspirin coated with so-called "enteric<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>
32<br>
coatings" is widely available commercially.   Such enteric coatings may be used to protect<br>
EETs during passage through the stomach. An exemplary coating is set forth in the<br>
Examples.<br>
[0107]    While the anti-hypertensive effects of EETs have been recognized, EETs have not<br>
been administered to treat hypertension because it was thought endogenous sEH would<br>
hydro! yse the EETs too quickly for them to have any useful effect. Surprisingly, it was found<br>
during the course of the studies underlying the present invention that exogenously<br>
administered inhibitors of sEH succeeded in inhibiting sEH sufficiently that levels of EETs<br>
could be further raised by the administration of exogenous EETs. These findings underlie the<br>
co-administration of sEH inhibitors and of EETs described above with respect to inhibiting<br>
the development and progression of nephropathy. This is an important improvement in<br>
augmenting treatment. While levels of endogenous EETs are expected to rise with the<br>
inhibition of sEH activity caused by the action of the sEH inhibitor, and therefore to result in<br>
at least some improvement in symptoms or pathology, it may not be sufficient in all cases to<br>
inhibit progression of kidney damage fully or to the extent intended. This is particularly true<br>
where the diseases or other factors have reduced the endogenous concentrations of EETs<br>
below those normally present in healthy individuals. Administration of exogenous EETs in<br>
conjunction with a sEH inhibitor is therefore expected to be beneficial and to augment the<br>
effects of the sEH inhibitor in reducing the progression of diabetic nephropathy.<br>
[0108]    The present invention can be used with regard to any and all forms of diabetes to the<br>
extent that they are associated with progressive damage to the kidney or kidney function.<br>
The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction,<br>
and failure of various organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels.<br>
The long-term complications of diabetes include retinopathy with potential loss of vision;<br>
nephropathy leading to renal failure; peripheral neuropathy with risk of foot ulcers,<br>
amputation, and Charcot joints.<br>
[0109]    In addition, persons with metabolic syndrome are at high risk of progression to type<br>
2 diabetes, and therefore at higher risk than average for diabetic nephropathy. It is therefore<br>
desirable to monitor such individuals for microalbuminuria, and to administer a sEH inhibitor<br>
and, optionally, one or more EETs, as an intervention to reduce the development of<br>
nephropathy. The practitioner may wait until microalbuminuria is seen before beginning the<br>
intervention. As noted above, a person can be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome without<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>
33<br>
having a blood pressure of 130/85 or higher. Both persons with blood pressure of 130/85 or<br>
higher and persons with blood pressure below 130/85 can benefit from the administration of<br>
sEH inhibitors and, optionally, of one or more EETs, to slow the progression of damage to<br>
their kidneys. In some embodiments, the person has metabolic syndrome and blood pressure<br>
below 130/85.<br>
[0110]    Dyslipidemia or disorders of lipid metabolism is another risk factor for heart<br>
disease. Such disorders include an increased level of LDL cholesterol, a reduced level of<br>
HDL cholesterol, and an increased level of triglycerides. An increased level of serum<br>
cholesterol, and especially of LDL cholesterol, is associated with an increased risk of heart<br>
disease. The kidneys are also damaged by such high levels. It is believed that high levels of<br>
triglycerides are associated with kidney damage. In particular, levels of cholesterol over 200<br>
mg/dL, and especially levels over 225 mg/dL, would suggest that sEH inhibitors and,<br>
optionally, EETs, should be administered. Similarly, triglyceride levels of more than 215<br>
mg/dL, and especially of 250 mg/dL or higher, would indicate that administration of sEH<br>
inhibitors and, optionally, of EETs, would be desirable. The administration of compounds of<br>
the present invention with or without the EETs, can reduce the need to administer statin drugs<br>
(HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) to the patients, or reduce the amount of the statins needed.<br>
In some embodiments, candidates for the methods, uses and compositions of the invention<br>
have triglyceride levels over 215 mg/dL and blood pressure below 130/85. In some<br>
embodiments, the candidates have triglyceride levels over 250 mg/dL and blood pressure<br>
below 130/85. In some embodiments, candidates for the methods, uses and compositions of<br>
the invention have cholesterol levels over 200 mg/dL and blood pressure below 130/85. In<br>
some embodiments, the candidates have cholesterol levels over 225 mg/dL and blood<br>
pressure below 130/85.<br>
Methods of Inhibiting the Proliferation of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells:<br>
[0111]    In other embodiments, compounds of formula (I) inhibit proliferation of vascular<br>
smooth muscle (VSM) cells without significant cell toxicity, (e.g. specific to VSM cells).<br>
Because VSM cell proliferation is an integral process in the pathophysiology of<br>
atherosclerosis, these compounds are suitable for slowing or inhibition atherosclerosis. These<br>
compounds are useful to subjects at risk for atherosclerosis, such as individuals who have had<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>

a heart attack or a test result showing decreased blood circulation to the heart. The conditions<br>
of therapeautic administration are as described above.<br>
[0112]    The methods of the invention are particularly useful for patients who have had<br>
percutaneous intervention, such as angioplasty to reopen a narrowed artery, to reduce or to<br>
slow the narrowing of the reopened passage by restenosis. In some embodiments, the artery<br>
is a coronary artery. The compounds of the invention can be placed on stents in polymeric<br>
coatings to provide a controlled localized release to reduce restenosis. Polymer compositions<br>
for implantable medical devices, such as stents, and methods for embedding agents in the<br>
polymer for controlled release, are known in the art and taught, for example, in U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 6,335,029; 6,322,847; 6,299,604; 6,290,722; 6,287,285; and 5,637,113. In some<br>
embodiments, the coating releases the inhibitor over a period of time, preferably over a<br>
period of days, weeks, or months. The particular polymer or other coating chosen is not a<br>
critical part of the present invention.<br>
[0113]    The methods of the invention are useful for slowing or inhibiting the stenosis or<br>
restenosis of natural and synthetic vascular grafts. As noted above in connection with stents,<br>
desirably, the synthetic vascular graft comprises a material which releases a compound of the<br>
invention over time to slow or inhibit VSM proliferation and the consequent stenosis of the<br>
graft. Hemodialysis grafts are a particular embodiment.<br>
[0114]    In addition to these uses, the methods of the invention can be used to slow or to"<br>
inhibit stenosis or restenosis of blood vessels of persons who have had a heart attack, or<br>
whose test results indicate that they are at risk of a heart attack.<br>
[0115]    In one group of embodiments, compounds of the invention are administered to<br>
reduce proliferation of VSM cells in persons who do not have hypertension. In another group<br>
of embodiments, compounds of the invention are used to reduce proliferation of VSM cells in<br>
persons who are being treated for hypertension, but with an agent that is not an sEH inhibitor.<br>
[0116]    The compounds of the invention can be used to interfere with the proliferation of<br>
cells which exhibit inappropriate cell cycle regulation, hi one important set of embodiments,<br>
the cells are cells of a cancer. The proliferation of such cells can be slowed or inhibited by<br>
contacting the cells with a compound of the invention. The determination of whether a<br>
particular compound of the invention can slow or inhibit the proliferation of cells of any<br>
particular type of cancer can be determined using assays routine in the art.<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>
35<br>
[0117]    In addition to the use of the compounds of the invention, the levels of EETs can be<br>
raised by adding EETs. VSM cells contacted with both an EET and a compound of the<br>
invention exhibited slower proliferation than cells exposed to either the EET alone or to the a<br>
compound of the invention alone. Accordingly, if desired, the slowing or inhibition of VSM<br>
cells of a compound of the invention can be enhanced by adding an EET along with a<br>
compound of the invention. In the case of stents or vascular grafts, for example, this can<br>
conveniently be accomplished by embedding the EET in a coating along with a compound of<br>
the invention so that both are released once the stent or graft is in position.<br>
Methods of Inhibiting the Progression of Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Interstitial<br>
Lung Disease, or Asthma:<br>
[0118]    Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, encompasses two conditions,<br>
emphysema and chronic bronchitis, which relate to damage caused to the lung by air<br>
pollution, chronic exposure to chemicals, and tobacco smoke. Emphysema as a disease<br>
relates to damage to the alveoli of the lung, which results in loss of the separation between<br>
alveoli and a consequent reduction in the overall surface area available for gas exchange.<br>
Chronic bronchitis relates to irritation of the bronchioles, resulting in excess production of<br>
mucin, and the consequent blocking by mucin of the airways leading to the alveoli. While<br>
persons with emphysema do not necessarily have chronic bronchitis or vice versa, it is<br>
common for persons with one of the conditions to also have the other, as well as other lung<br>
disorders.<br>
[0119]    Some of the damage to the lungs due to COPD, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and<br>
other obstructive lung disorders can be inhibited or reversed by administering inhibitors of<br>
the enzyme known as soluble epoxide hydrolase, or "sEH". The effects of sEH inhibitors can<br>
be increased by also administering EETs. The effect is at least additive over administering<br>
the two agents separately, and may indeed be synergistic.<br>
[0120]    The studies reported herein show that EETs can be used in conjunction with sEH<br>
inhibitors to reduce damage to the lungs by tobacco smoke or, by extension, by occupational<br>
or environmental irritants. These findings indicate that the co-administration of sEH<br>
inhibitors and of EETs can be used to inhibit or slow the development or progression of<br>
COPD, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or other chronic obstructive lung diseases which<br>
cause irritation to the lungs.<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>
36<br>
[0121]    Animal models of COPD and humans with COPD have elevated levels of<br>
immunomodulatory lymphocytes and neutrophils. Neutrophils release agents that cause<br>
tissue damage and, if not regulated, will over time have a destructive effect. Without wishing<br>
to be bound by theory, it is believed that reducing levels of neutrophils reduces tissue damage<br>
contributing to obstructive lung diseases such as COPD, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis.<br>
Administration of sEH inhibitors to rats in an animal model of COPD resulted in a reduction<br>
in the number of neutrophils found in the lungs. Administration of EETs in addition to the<br>
sEH inhibitors also reduced neutrophil levels.  The reduction in neutrophil levels in the<br>
presence of sEH inhibitor and EETs was greater than in the presence of the sEH inhibitor<br>
alone.<br>
[0122]    While levels of endogenous EETs are expected to rise with the inhibition of sEH<br>
activity caused by the action of the sEH inhibitor, and therefore to result in at least some<br>
improvement in symptoms or pathology, it may not be sufficient in all cases to inhibit<br>
progression of COPD or other pulmonary diseases. This is particularly true where the<br>
diseases or other factors have reduced the endogenous concentrations of EETs below those<br>
normally present in healthy individuals. Administration of exogenous EETs in conjunction<br>
with an sEH inhibitor is therefore expected to augment the effects of the sEH inhibitor in<br>
inhibiting or reducing the progression of COPD or other pulmonary diseases.<br>
[0123]    In addition to inhibiting or reducing the progression of chronic obstructive airway<br>
conditions, the invention also provides new ways of reducing the severity or progression of<br>
chronic restrictive airway diseases. While obstructive airway diseases tend to result from the<br>
destruction of the lung parenchyma, and especially of the alveoE, restrictive diseases tend to<br>
arise from the deposition of excess collagen in the parenchyma.   These restrictive diseases<br>
are commonly referred to as "interstitial lung diseases", or "ILDs", and include conditions<br>
such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The methods, compositions and uses of the invention<br>
are useful for reducing the severity or progression of ILDs, such as idiopathic pulmonary<br>
fibrosis. Macrophages play a significant role in stimulating interstitial cells, particularly<br>
fibroblasts, to lay down collagen. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that<br>
neutrophils are involved in activating macrophages, and that the reduction of neutrophil<br>
levels found in the studies reported herein demonstrate that the methods and uses of the<br>
invention will also be applicable to reducing the severity and progression of ELDs.<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>
37<br>
[0124]    In some embodiments, the ILD is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In other<br>
embodiments, the ILD is one associated with an occupational or environmental exposure.<br>
Exemplars of such ILDs, are asbestosis, silicosis, coal worker's pneumoconiosis, and<br>
berylliosis. Further, occupational exposure to any of a number of inorganic dusts and organic<br>
dusts is believed to be associated with mucus hypersecretion and respiratory disease,<br>
including cement dust, coke oven emissions, mica, rock dusts, cotton dust, and grain dust (for<br>
a more complete list of occupational dusts associated with these conditions, see Table 254-1<br>
of Speizer, "Environmental Lung Diseases," Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, infra,<br>
at pp. 1429-1436). In other embodiments, the ILD is sarcoidosis of the lungs.  ILDs can also<br>
result from radiation in medical treatment, particularly for breast cancer, and from connective<br>
tissue or collagen diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis.  It is believed<br>
that the methods, uses and compositions of the invention can be useful in each of these<br>
interstitial lung diseases.<br>
[0125]    In another set of embodiments, the invention is used to reduce the severity or<br>
progression of asthma. Asthma typically results in mucin hypersecretion, resulting in partial<br>
airway obstruction. Additionally, irritation of the airway results in the release of mediators<br>
which result in airway obstruction. While the lymphocytes and other immunomodulatory<br>
cells recruited to the lungs in asthma may differ from those recruited as a result of COPD or<br>
an ILD, it is expected that the invention will reduce the influx of immunomodulatory cells,<br>
such as neutrophils and eosinophils, and ameliorate the extent of obstruction. Thus, it is<br>
expected that the administration of sEH inhibitors, and the administration of sEH inhibitors in<br>
combination with EETs, will be useful in reducing airway obstruction due to asthma.<br>
[0126]    In each of these diseases and conditions, it is believed that at least some of the<br>
damage to the lungs is due to agents released by neutrophils which infiltrate into the lungs.<br>
The presence of neutrophils in the airways is thus indicative of continuing damage from the<br>
disease or condition, while a reduction in the number of neutrophils is indicative of reduced<br>
damage or disease progression. Thus, a reduction in the number of neutrophils in the airways<br>
in the presence of an agent is a marker that the agent is reducing damage due to the disease or<br>
condition, and is slowing the further development of the disease or condition. The number of<br>
neutrophils present in the lungs can be determined by, for example, bronchoalveolar lavage.<br>

Based on these results, we expect that inhibitors of sEH taken prior to an ischernic stroke will<br>
reduce the area of brain damage and will likely reduce the consequent degree of impairment.<br>
The reduced area of damage should also be associated with a faster recovery from the effects<br>
of the stroke.<br>
[0128]    While the pathophysiologies of different subtypes of stroke differ, they all cause<br>
brain damage. Hemorrhagic stroke differs from ischemic stroke in that the damage is largely<br>
due to compression of tissue as blood builds up in the confined space within the skull after a<br>
blood vessel ruptures, whereas in ischemic stroke, the damage is largely due to loss of<br>
oxygen supply to tissues downstream of the blockage of a blood vessel by a clot. Ischemic<br>
strokes are divided into thrombotic strokes, in which a clot blocks a blood vessel in the brain,<br>
and embolic strokes, in which a clot formed elsewhere in the body is carried through the<br>
blood stream and blocks a vessel there. But, in both hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke,<br>
the damage is due to the death of brain cells. Based on the results observed in our studies,<br>
however, we would expect at least some reduction in brain damage in all types of stroke and<br>
in all subtypes.<br>
[0129]    A number of factors associated with an increased risk of stroke. Given the results of<br>
the studies underlying the present invention, sEH inhibitors administered to persons with any<br>
one or more of the following conditions or risk factors-.high blood pressure, tobacco use,<br>
diabetes, carotid artery disease, peripheral artery disease, atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic<br>
attacks (TIAs), blood disorders such as high red blood cell counts and sickle cell disease,<br>
high blood cholesterol, obesity, alcohol use of more than one drink a day for women or two<br>
drinks a day for men, use of cocaine, a family history of stroke, a previous stroke or heart<br>
attack, or being elderly, will reduce the area of brain damaged of a stroke. With respect to<br>
being elderly, the risk of stroke increases for every 10 years. Thus, as an individual reaches<br>
60, 70, or 80, administration of sEH inhibitors has an increasingly larger potential benefit.<br>
As noted in the next section, the administration of EETs in combination with one or more<br>
sEH inhibitors can be beneficial in further reducing the brain damage.<br>
[0130]    In some uses and methods, the sEH inhibitors and, optionally, EETs, are<br>
administered to persons who use tobacco, have carotid artery disease, have peripheral artery<br>
disease, have atrial fibrillation, have had one or more transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), have<br>
a blood disorder such as a high red blood cell count or sickle cell disease, have high blood<br>
cholesterol, are obese, use alcohol in excess of one drink a day if a woman or two drinks a<br><br>

day if a man, use cocaine, have a family history of stroke, have had a previous stroke or heart<br>
attack and do not have high blood pressure or diabetes, or are 60, 70, or 80 years of age or<br>
more and do not have hypertension or diabetes.<br>
[0131]    Clot dissolving agents, such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), have been shown<br>
to reduce the extent of damage from ischemic strokes if administered in the hours shortly<br>
after a stroke. tPA, for example, is approved by the FDA for use in the first three hours after<br>
a stroke. Thus, at least some of the brain damage from a stoke is not instantaneous, but<br>
occurs over a period of time or after a period of time has elapsed after the stroke. It is<br>
therefore believed that administration of sEH inhibitors, optionally with EETs, can also<br>
reduce brain damage if administered within 6 hours after a stroke has occurred, more<br>
preferably within 5, 4, 3, or 2 hours after a stroke has occurred, with each successive shorter<br>
interval being more preferable. Even more preferably, the inhibitor or inhibitors are<br>
administered 2 hours or less or even 1 hour or less after the stroke, to maximize the reduction<br>
in brain damage. Persons of skill are well aware of how to make a diagnosis of whether or<br>
not a patient has had a stroke. Such determinations are typically made in hospital emergency<br>
rooms, following standard differential diagnosis protocols and imaging procedures.<br>
[0132]    In some uses and methods, the sEH inhibitors and, optionally, EETs, are<br>
administered to persons who have had a stroke within the last 6 hours who: use tobacco, have<br>
carotid artery disease, have peripheral artery disease, have atrial fibrillation, have had one or<br>
more transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), have a blood disorder such as a high red blood cell<br>
count or sickle cell disease, have high blood cholesterol, are obese, use alcohol in excess of<br>
one drink a day if a woman or two drinks a day if a man, use cocaine, have a family history<br>
of stroke, have had a previous stroke or heart attack and do not have high blood pressure or<br>
diabetes, or are 60, 70, or 80 years of age or more and do not have hypertension or diabetes.<br>
[0133]    The conditions of therapeautic administration for all of these indications are as<br>
described above.<br>
Combination Therapy<br>
[0134]    As noted above, the compounds of the present invention will, in some instances, be<br>
used in combination with other therapeutic agents to bring about a desired effect. Selection<br>
of additional agents will, in large part, depend on the desired target therapy (see, e.g., Turner,<br>

and DeFronzo, R. et al. (ed's.), Diabetes Reviews (1997) Vol. 5 No. 4). A number of studies<br>

Combination therapy includes administration of a single pharmaceutical dosage formulation<br>
which contains a compound having the general structure of formula 1 and one or more<br>
additional active agents, as well as administration of a compound of formula 1 and each<br>
active agent in its own separate pharmaceutical dosage formulation. For example, a<br>
compound of formula 1 and one or more angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin<br>
converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, alpha blockers, beta<br>
blockers, centrally acting agents, vasopeptidase inhibitors, renin inhibitors, endothelin<br>
receptor agonists, AGE crosslink breakers, sodium/potassium ATPase inhibitors, endothelin<br>
receptor agonists, endothelin receptor antagonists, angiotensin vaccine, and the like; can be<br>
administered to the human subject together in a single oral dosage composition, such as a<br>
tablet or capsule, or each agent can be administered in separate oral dosage formulations.<br>
Where separate dosage formulations are used, a compound of formula 1 and one or more<br>
additional active agents can be administered at essentially the same time (i.e., concurrently),<br>
or at separately staggered times (i.e., sequentially). Combination therapy is understood to<br>
include all these regimens.<br>

[0136]    In one embodiment, compounds are those compounds described above as for the<br>
recited uses.<br>
Methods of Preparation<br>
[0137]    The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by a variety of methods as<br>
outlined generally in the schemes below.<br>
Scheme 1 - Introduction of a secondary pharmacophore (ketone)<br>
[0138]    Scheme 1 illustrates general methods that can be used for preparation of compounds<br>
of the invention having a secondary pharmacophore that is a ketone functional group. While<br>
the scheme is provided for the synthesis of l-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-(4-oxodecyl)urea, one of<br>
skill in the art will understand that a number of commercially available isocyanates could be<br>
used in place of 3-chlorophenyl isocyanate, and that shorter or longer analogs of ethyl 4-<br>
aminobutyric acid or hexylbromide could also be employed.<br>
Scheme 1: Synthesis of l-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-(4-oxodecyl)urea (794).<br><br>
Scheme 1: Synthesis of l-(3-chlorophenyI)-3-(4-oxodecyl)urea (794): (a) Benzophenone inline, CH2Cl2. rt; (b)<br>
DIBAL, THF, -78°C; (c) Mg/I2, hexylbromide, THF, rt; (d) acetic anhydride, DMSO, rt; (e) 1N HCl/dioxane, rt;<br>
(f) 3-chlorophenyl isocyanate, TEA, DMF, rt.<br>
[0139]    As shown in Scheme 1, ethyl 4-aminobutyrate hydrochloride (available from<br>
Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA) is combined with benzophenone irnine<br>
at room temperature to provide intermediate (i). DIBAL reduction of the ester group<br>
provides an unisolated aldehyde moiety that is then reacted with a suitable Grignard reagent<br>
(prepared in situ) to provide intermediate alcohol (ii). Oxidation of the alcohol moiety to a<br>
ketone provides (iii) which can then be deprotected to form the amino-ketone (iv). Reaction<br>
of (iv) with a suitable isocyanate provides the target compound (794). Substitution of<br><br>

3-chlorophenyl isocyanate with, for example, adamantyl isocyanate or cyclohexyl isocyanate<br>
(also available from Aldrich Chemical Co.) provides other compounds of the invention.<br><br>
Scheme 2: Syntheses of l-(aryl or alkyl)-3-(3-alkylated proply)ureas: (a) aryl or alkyl isocyanate, DMF, rt; (b)<br>
bromopentane, K2CO3, Nal, acetonitrile, reflux; (c) di-t-butyl dicarbonate, dioxane, 50°C; (d) pentylamine,<br>
isobutyl chloroformate, NMM, DMF, rt; (e) 4M hydrochloric acid, dioxane; (f) 3-chlorophenyi isocyanate,<br>
TEA, DMF, rt.<br>
[0140]    As shown in Scheme 2, a variety of compounds having a secondary pharmacophore<br>
that is either an ester or amide functional group can be prepared. Beginning with 4-<br>
aminobutyric acid, treatment with a suitable cycloalkyl or aryl isocyanate provides the urea<br>
intermediates shown as (v), wherein R is 3-chlorophenyl, cyclohexyl or 1-adamantyl. Of<br>
course other suitable isocyanates can also be employed to provide desired urea intermediates.<br>
Esterification via alkylation of the carboxylic acid present in (v) with, for example, pentyl<br>
bromide provides the target compounds 767, 772 and 789. A variety of suitable alkyl halides<br>
can be used to prepare other compounds of the invention. The second path illustrated in<br>
Scheme 2 can be used to prepare compounds such as 768, as well as those compounds having<br>
a primary pharmacophore that is a carbamate. Accordingly, treatment of 4-aminobutyric acid<br>
with di-t-butyl dicarbonate provides the t-butyl carbamate acid (vi) that is converted to a<br>
desired amide (vii) using pentylamine, for example, in a mild procedure employing isobutyl<br>
chloroformate, and N-methyl morpholine (NMM). Removal of the carbamate protecting<br>
group (as it is used in this instance) followed by formation of a urea with a suitable<br>
isocyanate (shown here as 3-chlorophenyl isocyanate) provides the target compounds (e.g.,<br>
768).<br><br>

Scheme 3: Syntheses of l-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-(2-alkylated ethyl)ureas: (a) 3-chlorophenyl isocyanate, DMF, rt;<br>
(b) heptanoic anhydride (761), chlorofonnic acid pentyl ester (760), or pentyl isocyanate (762), TEA, DMF, rt;<br>
(c) di-t-butyl dicarbonate, dioxane, rt; (d) heptanoic anhydride (765), chloroformic acid pentyl ester (777), or<br>
pentyl isocyanate (766), DMF, rt; (e) 4M HC1, dioxane; (f) 3-chlorophenyl isocyanate, TEA, DMF, rt.<br>
[0141]    Scheme 3 illustrates a variety of methods for introducing secondary<br>
phannacophores that are esters, amide, ureas, carbonates and carbamates, from readily<br>
accessible starting materials. In A, ethanolamine is treated with a suitable isocyanate to<br>
introduce a primary pharmacophore that is a urea and form intermediate (viii). Treatment of<br>
(viii) with an anhydride, a chloro formic acid ester or an isocyanate provides compounds such<br>
as 761,760 and 762, respectively. Similar methodology in employed in B, with the addition<br>
of protection/deprotection steps. Accordingly, ethylenediamine is monoprotected as a r-butyl<br>
carbamate. The free amine is then converted to a secondary pharmacophore that is an amide,<br>
carbamate or urea using reactants and conditions similar to those employed in "A" to provide<br>
intermediates (x). Deprotection of (x) and reaction with a suitable isocyanate provides the<br>
target compounds 765, 777 and 766. Again, use of isocyanates other than 3-chlorophenyl<br>
isocyanate leads to other compounds of the invention, while substitution of certain reactants<br>
used, for example, in the conversion of (ix) to (x) can provide still other compounds of the<br>
invention.<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>

Scheme 4: Syntheses of l-(l-adamantyl)-3-(ll-alkylated undecyl)ureas: (a) adamantyl isocyanate, chloroform,<br>
reflux; (b) alkyl or aryl halide, K2CO3, Nal, acetonitrile, reflux; (c) alcohol or amine, isobutyl chloroformate,<br>
TEA, DMF, rt; (d) t-butanol, EDCI, DMAP, metirylene chloride, rt.<br>
[0142]    Scheme 4 illustrates pathways for the introduction of a tertiary pharmacophore that<br>
is an ester or an amide functional group. In each case, a carboxylic acid group is converted to<br>
the desired ester or amide. As shown in Scheme 4,12-aminododecanoic acid (Aldrich<br>
Chemical Co.) is converted to urea (687) upon treatment with adamantyl isocyanate. One of<br>
skill in the art will appreciate that a variety of alkyl, aryl and cycloalkyl isocyanates can be<br>
similarly employed to form other ureas as the primary pharmacophore. Similarly,<br>
11-aminoundecanoic acid or another long chain amino fatty acid could be used in place of<br>
12-aminododecanoic acid. The carboxylic acid moiety can then be esterified or converted to<br>
an amide moiety following standard procedures to provide, for example, 780-785, 788 and<br>
800-804 (as esters) and 786, 787, 792 and 793 (as esters and amides).<br>
[0143]    Scheme 5 illustrates pathways for the synthesis of cis- or trans-phenoxy or<br>
benzyloxy-cyclohexyl compounds. In each case, trans-4-aminocyclohexanol hydrochloride is<br>
converted to the desired isomer of the phenoxy or benzyloxy derivative. The alcohol moiety<br>
can be alkylated with an appropriately substituted benzyl halide following standard<br>
procedures to provide, the corresponding benzyl ether. Likewise, the alcohol moiety can be<br>
alkylated with an appropriately substituted phenol in the presence of triphenylphosphine<br>
following standard procedures to provide, the corresponding phenyl ether. As shown in<br>
Scheme 5, each isomer can be converted to the corresponding urea upon treatment with an<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>
45<br>
appropriately substituted isocyanate, e.g. adamantyl isocyanate. One of skill in the art will<br>
appreciate that a variety of alkyl, aryl and cycloalkyl isocyanates can be similarly employed<br>
to form other ureas as the primary pharmacophore.<br><br>
Scheme 5: Syntheses of cis and trans-phenoxy-and benzyloxy-cyclohexyl compounds.<br>
Combinatorial library synthesis<br>
[0144]    A 192-member urea library has been constructed by a known two-step solid-phase<br>
synthesis (Tetrahedron Letters 2003,44, 6099-6102), which employs a PS-Indole-CHO resin.<br>
As shown in Scheme 6, four amines and 48 isocyanates have been used as building blocks to<br>
find the optimal left side of urea for sEH inhibitors. Resin-bound secondary amines can be<br>
obtained by a reductive amination with amines using sodium cyanoborohydride in the<br>
presence of triethylorthoformate. The reaction with isocyanates gives the desired resin-bound<br>
ureas, which can be cleaved from the resin by very mild acidic condition by using 1% TFA in<br>
dichloromethane at room temperature. The 192 urea compounds were prepared in 20-50%<br>
overall yields from the indole aldehyde resin. The identification and purity of the library<br>
could be determined by LC-MS. Purities were above 80%. Compounds with purites below<br>
this level were removed from the library.<br><br>

Synthesis of 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-(4-oxodecyl)urea (794)<br>
[0149]    1.00g (5.52 mmol) of  benzophenone imine, 0.94 g (5.52 mmol) of ethyl 4-<br>
aminobutyrate hydrochloride, and 20 mL of methylene chloride were stirred at room<br>
temperature for 24 hr. The reaction mixture was filtered to remove NH4CI and evaporated to<br>

[0233]    Compound 1136was synthesized (0.5 g, 1.5 mmol) by the same method as that<br>
described above with 35 wt% hydrazine (0.27g, 2.95 mmol) in 15 mL of DCM and 15 mL of<br>
MeOH followed by the reaction with 1-adamantyl isocyanate (0.12g, 0.67 mmol) and<br>
triethylamine (0.07g, 0.74 mmol) in DMF (5 mL). Yield: 0.24 g (93% of theory). M.P.:<br>

Example 33<br>
Combinatorial synthesis of urea inhibitors<br>
[0234]    A mixture of PS-Indole-CHO resin (0.5 g, 0.46 mmol), THF (3 mL), TEOF (3 mL)<br>
and the primary amine (1.0 mmol) was agitated at ambient temperature for 4 h. Then, a<br>
solution of NaBH3CN (1.0 mL, 1 M) in THF and acetic acid (O.lmL) were added. The<br>
resulting mixture was stirred for 2h. The supernatant liquid was drained off and the resin<br>
washed with THF (8 mL*2), MeOH (8 mL*3) and DCM (8 mLx2).<br>
[0235]    To a suspension of the resin-bound secondary amine (0.1 g) in DCM (2 mL) was<br>
added an isocyanate (0.5 mmol). The resulting mixture was agitated overnight at ambient<br>
temperature. The supernatant liquid is drained off and the resin washed with DMF, MeOH<br>
and DCM.<br>
[0236]    The resin-bound product was suspended hi 1 % (v/v) TFA (3 mL, ca. 4 mol equiv.)<br>
and the mixture agitated at ambient temperature for 4 h. The color of the resin became deep<br>
purple. The supernatant liquid was collected and the resin was washed with DCM (2x2 mL).<br>
The combined solution was concentrated to afford pure products in excellent yields.<br>

Enzyme preparation<br>
[0238]    Recombinant mouse sEH and human sEH were produced in a baculovirus<br>
expression system and purified by affinity chromatography. The preparations were at least<br>
97% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and scanning densitometry. No detectable esterase or<br>
glutathione transferase activity, which can interfere with this sEH assay, was observed.<br><br>

Protein concentration was quantified by using the Pierce BCA assay using Fraction V bovine<br>
serum albumin as the calibrating standard.<br>
IC50 Assay conditions<br>
[0239]    IC50 values were determined in one of two method. One method uses racemic 4-<br>
mtophenyl-trans-2,3-epoxy-3-phenylpropyl carbonate as substrate. Enzymes (0.12 fiM<br>
mouse sEH or 0.24 μM human sEH) were incubated with inhibitors for 5 min in sodium<br>
phosphate buffer, 0.1 M pH 7.4, at 30°C before substrate introduction([S] = 40 μM). Activity<br>
was assessed by measuring the appearance of the 4-nitrophenolate anion at 405 nm at 30°C<br>
during 1 min (Spectramax 200; Molecular Devices). Assays were performed in triplicate.<br>
IC50 is a concentration of inhibitor, which reduces enzyme activity by 50%, and was<br>
determined by regression of at least five datum points with a minimum of two points in the<br>
linear region of the curve on either side of the IC50. The curve was generated from at least<br>
three separate runs, each in triplicate, to obtain the standard deviation (SD) given in Table 1<br>
thru Table 4.<br>
[0240]    Other IC50 values were determined using the procedure described in Analytical<br>
Biochemistry 343 66-75 (2005) using cyano(6-methoxy-naphthalen-2-yl)methyl trans-[(3-<br>
phenyloxiran-2-yl)methyl] carbonate as a substrate (see Table 18b). Enzymes (0.88 nM for<br>
murine and 0.96 nM for human sEH) were incubated with inhibitors ([T] = 0.5-10,000 nM)<br>
for 5 min in BisTris-HCl buffer (25 mM, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 mg/ml of BSA) at 30 °C<br>
prior to substrate introduction ([S] = 51M). Enzyme activity was measured by monitoring the<br>
appearance of 6-methoxy-2-naphthaldehyde. Assays were performed in triplicate. By<br>
definition, IC50 values are concentrations of inhibitor that reduce enzyme activity by 50%.<br>
IC50 values were determined by regression of at least five datum points, with a minimum of<br>
two datum points in the linear region of the curve on either side of the IC50 values. The curve<br>
was generated from at least three separate runs, each in triplicate.<br>
[0241]    Assays were conducted with the compounds indicated in Table 1, as described<br>
above.<br><br>

[0242]    As can be seen from the above table, the conversion of a carboxylic acid function to<br>
its methyl ester (549, 635, and 774) increased inhibition potency for both mouse and human<br>
i<br>
sEHs. Moreover, the methyl ester of butanoic acid (774) showed 8-100 fold higher activity<br>
than the esters of acetic and propanoic acids (549 and 635) for both enzymes, indicating that<br>
a polar functional group located three carbon units (carbonyl on the fourth carbon, about 7.5<br>
angstroms from the urea carbonyl) from the carbonyl of the primary urea pharmacophore can<br>
be effective for making potent sEH inhibitors of improved water solubility, hi addition, the<br><br>

distance from the carbonyl of the primary urea pharmacophore to the secondary ester<br>
pharmacophore in compound 854 is about 8.9 A showing that the secondary pharmacophore<br>
may be located about 7 A to about 9 A from the carbonyl of the primary urea pharmacophore<br>
group.<br>

[0243]    This example illustrates the inhibition of mouse and human soluble epoxide<br>
hydrolases by compounds of the invention having a secondary pharmacophore, with<br>
comparison to compounds having only a primary pharmacophore. As can be seen from the<br>
results in Table 2, the activity is relatively consistent.<br>
[0244]    Assays were conducted with the compounds indicated in Table 2, according to<br>
established protocols (see, above).<br>

Enzymes (0.12 μM mouse sbn and 0.24 uM human sEH) were incubated with inhibitors for 5 mm in sodium<br>
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 30°C before substrate introduction ([S] = 40μM). Results are means ± SD of three<br>
separate experiments.<br>
[0245]    As shown in the above table, the substitution at R with a cyclohexyl (772) or<br>
adamantyl (789) increased inhibitor potency 10-fold over the 3-chlorophenyl analog (767, see<br>
Table 3 below). Furthermore, these compounds functionalized with a polar group were as<br>
active and potent as non-functionalized lipophilic inhibitors (for example, 791, 790,297, and<br>
686) for both murine and human enzymes. Adding polar groups to compounds generally<br>
increases their water solubility, and this was the case when one compares compounds 772 or<br>
789 to 791 and 790. In addition, stripping water of hydration out of the enzyme catalytic site<br>
requires about the same amount of energy that is gained by forming a new hydrogen bond<br>
between the inhibitor and the enzyme. Thus addition of polar groups which hydrogen bond<br>
to a target enzyme does not dramatically increase potency if the inhibitor is already potent.<br>
However, the presence of an additional polar group can be expected to dramatically increase<br>
specificity by decreasing hydrophobic binding to biological molecules other than the primary<br>
target (sEH). In this way combining several active pharmacophores into a single molecule<br>
often has a massive increase in specificity and biological activity in complex biological<br>
systems.<br>
Example 36<br>

hydrolases by compounds of the invention having a secondary pharmacophore that is a<br>
ketone, amide, alcohol, carbonate, carbamate, urea, carboxylate ester functional group.<br>
[0247]    Based on the initial activity shown in Table 1, urea compounds were prepared<br>
having a polar carbonyl group located approximately 7.5 angstroms from the carbonyl of the<br>
primary urea pharmacophore to improve water solubility of lipophilic sEH inhibitors (192<br><br>

and 686). The table below shows various functionalities such as ketone, ester, amide,<br>
carbonate, carbamate, and urea which contribute a carbonyl group, and are termed as the<br>
secondary pharmacophores. To determine the effect for each of the secondary<br>
pharmacophores, a 3-chlorophenyl group was held constant as one of substituents of the urea<br>
pharmacophore. The 3-chlorophenyl group is also particularly useful for monitoring<br>
chemical reactions quickly via chromatography. After optimizing the secondary<br>
pharmacophore, the aryl substituent can be replaced by a cyclohexyl, adamantyl or other<br>
group leading to more potent inhibitors.<br>

established protocols (see, above).<br>

[0249]    When the left of the carbonyl (X) is a methylene carbon, the best inhibition was<br>
obtained if a methylene carbon (ketone, 794) or oxygen (ester, 767) is present in the right<br>
position (Y). The ester bond can be stabilized by stearic hindrance of the alcohol or acid<br>
moiety or both (805). The presence of nitrogen (amide, 768) reduced the activity. In<br>
compounds with an oxygen in the left of the carbonyl group, a &gt; 10-fold drop in activity was<br>
observed and there was not any change in tide activity even if the right position, Y, was<br>
modified with a methylene carbon (ester, 761), oxygen (carbonate, 760), or nitrogen<br>
(carbamate, 762), respectively. All compounds (765,777, and 766) with nitrogen in the left<br>
position had lower activities than 794 or 767. Comparing compounds 767 and 761, the<br>
presence of a methylene carbon around the carbonyl showed a very different effect on the<br>
inhibition activity. The compound with a methylene carbon in the left of the carbonyl (767)<br>
showed a 20-fold better inhibition than that in the right (761). While the rank-order potency<br>
of this inhibitor series was equivalent with mouse and human sEH, a 3-5-fold higher<br>
inhibition potency was observed for the murine enzyme.<br>

[0251]    Compound 687, having a carboxylic acid group at the end of twelve carbon chain,<br>

an ester found to be a suitable secondary pharmacophore. As a result, a variety of ester<br>

separate experiments.<br>
[0253]    While the presence of a polar group at the end of a shorter chain reduced inhibition<br>
potency for both enzymes (see Table 1), when the carboxylic acid was modified to esters with<br>
various aliphatic groups (780,784,783,781,788,800,785,801,802, and 803) inhibition<br>
potencies were as high as that of the acid (687) for both enzymes. Ethyl (792) and isopropyl<br>
(793) amide derivatives were also potent inhibitors. Compounds with methyl-branched<br>
aliphatic chains were also potent (785, 801,802, 803, and 793). Still further, larger bulky<br>
group such as 1-adamantylmethyl (786), benzyl (804), 2-chlorobenzyl (782) or 2-<br>
naphthylmethyl (787) provided good levels of activity, although slightly reduced (1.5-3-fold)<br>
for both enzymes. These results identified an additional site within the sEH inhibitor<br>
structure which allows the inclusion of a third polar function, i.e. a tertiary pharmacophore.<br>
Example 38<br>
[0254]    In order to further explore the effects of functional groups which improve water<br>
solubility on the bioavailability and potency of the inhibitors, seven amide derivatives of<br>
compound 687 with various functionalities were synthesized. As shown in Table 5, alkyl,<br>
sulfonyl, lipoamino acid, and glucosylamide derivatives were prepared, and their inhibition<br>
potency on sEHs, melting point, and solubility in water and oil were examined. For mouse<br>
sEH, there was no change in the inhibition activity when the acid function of compound 687<br>
was substituted by an alkyl (792 and 793), sulfonyl (848 and 914), lipoamino acid (1001), or<br>
glucosyl (1002 and 798) groups. Interestingly, for human sEH, significant differences in<br>
inhibition potencies, which were measured by the spectrometric and fluorescent based assays,<br>
were observed when replacing the acid of compound 687 by the substituents. While<br>
introduction of the ethyl amide group (792) resulted in a 1.5-fold decrease in potency, the<br>
isopropyl analogue (793) exhibited very similar potency to ADUA (687). The corresponding<br>
ester derivatives 784 and 785 in Table 5 exhibited a 2-3-fold improvement in inhibition of the<br>
human enzyme. Two sulfonylamides with a methyl (848) or phenyl (914) group improved the<br>
inhibition potency of compound 4 about 1.5-fold. On the other hand, a 25-fold and 3-fold<br>
decrease in potency was observed when the sulfonylamide was replaced by a lipoamino acid<br>
(1001) or glucosyl groups (1002 and 798), respectively. This suggests that such bulky, and in<br>
the case of glucose, highly polar functional groups are not effective in retaining the inhibition<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>

potency on human sEH. Comparing compounds 1002 and 798, similar inhibition on the<br>
human enzyme was shown in these two compounds although an octyl group is present<br>
between the ADUA and sugar moieties of compound 1002, suggesting that relatively<br>
lipophilic alkyl groups located around the amide function do not alter the binding activity of<br>
inhibitors to the enzyme. Melting points of most of the amides in Table 5 were measured in a<br>
range of 100-140°C, which was similar to 114°C of the acid compound 687, while the ester<br>
derivates of compound 687 in Table 5 showed 23-66°C lower melting points than that of<br>
compound 687. An exception was compound 1001 for which we were unable to obtain a<br>
crystalline solid at room temperature. These results imply that the amide function is not as<br>
useful in reducing the melting point of AUDA derives as the esters. As with the esters<br>
prepared for this study, the amides failed to result in a large increase in potency on the target<br>
enzyme. Thus any advantage of these amides would result from improvements in ease of<br>
formulation, oral availability and pharmacokinetics. When water solubility of three<br>
compounds (848,1001, and 1002) was compared to that of compound 4, a 3-fold lower or<br>
similar solubility was shown in compounds with a rnethanesulfonyl (848) or glucosyl (1002)<br>
group, respectively. Compound 1001, the lipoamino acid conjugate, surprisingly had a 2.5-<br>
fold better water solubility than compound 687. The 25-fold decrease in the inhibitory<br>
potency of compound 1001 compared to 687 indicates that with compound 1001 the<br>
biological activity will be attributed largely to the production of AUDA rather than being due<br>
to both AUDA and its ester or amide. In addition, no valuable improvement in oil solubility<br>
was obtained in the amides. Although significant improvements in the properties of the<br>
compounds were not observed in the seven amide derivatives, their relative stability and<br>
inhibition potency is sufficient to encourage the further exploration of other amide<br>
compounds to develop bioavailable inhibitors with improved physical properties. We have<br>
reported that modification of the urea pharmacophore of potent sEH inhibitors to an amide<br>
functionality does not dramatically alter the inhibition potency and that at least a 10-fold<br>
improvement hi water solubility and a decrease in the melting points of these amide inhibitors<br>
is observed.( Kim, et al. J. Med. Chem. 2005, 48, 3621-3629). This suggests that the<br>
inhibition potency and physical properties of the amide derivatives in Table 5 might be<br>
improved with the modification of the urea function to the corresponding amide<br>
pharmacophore.<br><br>

[0257]    As can be seen from the above table, in increasing the distance between the<br>
secondary ester phannacphore and the tertiary ester pharmacaphore (549, 635, and 774)<br>
increased inhibition potency for human sEHs but mouse EH activity remained relatively<br>

[0265]    Compounds with from two to four ether groups (908, 950, and 952) had inhibition<br>
potencies that were as high as non-functionalized lipophilic inhibitors (790, see Table 2<br>

improved pharmacokinetics (See Figures 14-24). Including a tertiary pharmacophore were<br>

[0273]    Compounds with alkylene and arylene linker groups (859 and 861) had inhibition<br>
potencies that were higher than compounds with alkylene linkers (789, see Table 2 above,<br>
and 868, see Table 7 above) for both murine and human enzymes, independent of the<br>
topography {compare compound 859 with 860 and compound 861 with 863) or type of the<br>
secondary phannacophore {compare compounds 860 and 863 with 909).<br>
Example 44<br>
[0274]    This example illustrates the inhibition of mouse soluble epoxide hydrolases by<br>
compounds of the invention (formula (T)) having a secondary phannacophore, and further<br>
including a mono amino acid moiety. This example further illustrates the use of a<br>
combinatorial approach toward compound preparation and evaluation.<br>
[0275]    The utility of a combinatorial approach is illustrated by using the butanoic acid<br>
derivatives from Table 11 and Table 12 to form amide bonds with one or more natural or<br>
synthetic amino acids. This approach rapidly leads to a large number of compounds that are<br>
highly active and can be recognized by the intestinal peptide uptake system. As shown<br>
above, polar groups could be incorporated into one of the alkyl groups of the dialkyl-urea<br>
sEH inhibitors without loss of activity, when placed at an appropriate distance from the urea<br>
function. These modifications give the new inhibitors better solubility and availability. To<br>
expand this assessment of inhibitor structure refinement a semi-combinatorial approach was<br>
used with amino acids. Because amino acids are simple bifunctional synthons with a wide<br>
variety of side chains, mono and di-peptidic derivatives of 4-(3-cyclohexyl-ureido)-butyric<br>
acid 625 were synthesized. This parent compound (acid 625) was selected due to its low<br>
inhibition of sEH. Furthermore, to make the peptidic bond, reactants were used, such as 1-<br>
ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)-propyl) carbodiimide, that themselves or their reaction product,<br>
such as l-efhyl-3-(3-dimethylamino)-propyl urea, are not inhibitors of sEH. Therefore, any<br>
inhibition observed was derived from the targeted peptidic derivatives. This approach allows<br>
the preparation of compounds on an analytical scale (10 μmol) without purification of the<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>
93<br>
products. The presence of the desired products was confirmed by LC-MS and the ratio of the<br>
LC-MS peak of the desire compounds with the starting material was used to estimate the<br>
reaction yield. Because each inhibitor presents a single carboxyl group for negative mode<br>
ionization, the estimation of yield is reasonably quantitative.<br>
[0276]    Syntheses of amino acid derivatives of 4-(3-cyclohexyl-ureido)-butyric acid (632)<br>
were performed at analytical scale. Reactions were performed in 2mL glass vials for each<br>
amino acid. To 100 μL of a solution of 632 in DMF at 100 mM (10 μmol), 200 μL of a<br>
solution of l-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)-propyl) carbodiimide in DMF at 100 mM (20<br>
μmol) was added. After 15 minutes reaction at room temperature, 400 μL of amino acid<br>
methyl ester solution at 100 mM (40 umol) in 90:10 DMF:1 N NaOH was added. The<br>
reaction was strongly mixed at 40°C overnight. Three hundred microliters of 1 N NaOH was<br>
then added and allowed to react overnight at 40°C. Product formation was confirmed for<br>
each amino acid using electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Reaction<br>
solutions were used directly for inhibitor potency measurement with a theoretical<br>
concentration of 10 mM.<br>

established protocols (see, above).<br>

[0278]    Significant improvement of the inhibition potency was observed for the aromatic<br>
derivatives (phenylalanine, tryptophane and tyrosine), histidine and lysine. Again, without<br>
intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the specificity of the interaction of the<br>
enzyme with the five peptidic inhibitors listed results from specific pi-pi stacking between<br>
tryptophane 334 (Trp334) located in close proximity to the secondary pharmacophore, and the<br>
aromatic moieties with four of the five amino acids above. This interaction should alter the<br>
fluorescence spectrum of the enzyme. For the lysine derivative, because reaction can occur<br>
with the side chain amino group, the resulting product could resemble the alkyl derivatives<br>
synthesized above with the acid function playing the role of the third pharmacophore.<br>

[0283]    Significant improvement of inhibition potency was observed for almost all the<br>
derivatives tested except for alanine, isoleucine, leucine and threonine. These results indicate<br>
that the enzyme has a narrower specificity close to the catalytic center than toward the end of<br>
the active site tunnel. The inhibition potency found for the best dipeptidic derivatives are<br>
similar to those found for the corresponding alkyl inhibitors (see, C. Morisseau, et al.,<br>
Biochem. Pharm. 63:1599-1608 (2002)), indicating that such peptide-mimics are excellent<br>
inhibitors of sEH. Because of the presence of the amino acid derivatives in their structure,<br>
these compounds have excellent water solubility. Furthermore, because of the presence of<br>
active small peptide transport system in the gut, the dipeptidic urea derivatives will be<br>
absorbed in the gut by such systems as observed for several peptide derivative drugs (see, E.<br>
Walter, et al., Pharm. Res. 12: 360-365 (1995) and K. Watanabe, et al., Biol. Pharm. Bull 25:<br>
1345-1350 (2002)), giving these compounds excellent bioavailability.<br>
Example 46<br>
[0284]    This example provides studies directed to the metabolic stability of certain<br>
inhibitors of sEH.<br>
[0285]    To evaluate the metabolic stability of these inhibitors, the microsomal and NADPH<br>
dependent metabolism of a number of potent sEH inhibitors was evaluated. The rates of<br>
metabolism among the compounds varied dramatically, however the appearance of an<br>
omega-terminal acid was observed for all inhibitors containing n-alkane substitutions. When<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>

tested, the potent alkyl derivatives (e.g. 686) are rapidly metabolized in microsomal<br>
preparations by P450 dependents processes (see Figure 6), while the omega acid analogs (e.g.<br>
687) were stable (see Figure 7). The first step in the metabolic transformation of the n-alkyl<br>
to n-alkanoic acid derivatives is an NAPDH dependent process carried out by cytochrome<br>
P450 dependent omega hydroxylation in rodent and human hepatic tissue preparations (see<br>
Figure 8). The metabolites identified along this metabolic route are provided in Table 13.<br>
When in vivo metabolism was evaluated, evidence for the beta-oxidation of the alkanoic acid<br>
derivatives was also found (see Figure 9). Together, these data indicate that P450 omega<br>
hydroxylation can result in the rapid in vivo metabolic inactivation and excretion of these<br>
inhibitors.<br>

Example 47<br>
[0286]    This example provides the structures of compounds of the invention designed to<br>
slow esterase dependent inactivation, block beta-oxidation, block cytochrome P450<br>
dependent omega hydroxylation, or inhibit cytochrome P450 omega hydrolase.<br>
[0287]    Beta-oxidation can be blocked in a variety of ways, for example with an alpha<br>
halogen or alpha branched alkyl group (806), cyclopropane (807) or aromatic groups (808),<br>
or by replacing the acid or ester functional groups with alternate functionalities, such as<br>
sulfonamides (809 and 810), which mimic ester and acid functional groups yet provide<br>
metabolic stability in vivo. Similarly in pharmacology heterocyclic groups are used for<br>
hydrogen bond donors and acceptors to mimic carboxylic acids and esters (811). In addition,<br>
P450 omega hydroxylation can be blocked by including acetylene (812), trifluoromethyl<br>
(813), or aryl (814) groups at the terminus of the alkyl chain. This series of inhibitors also<br><br>

[0288]    This example illustrates a comparison of cyclohexyl and adamantyl groups in<br>
stability and solubility.<br>
[0289]    Another consistent observation during the metabolism studies was that the<br>
adamantyl substituent (both 192 and 686 substituted) provided compounds having improved<br>
stability (see Figure 6). Surprisingly the adamantyl compounds were approximately 2x more<br>
soluble than the corresponding cyclohexyl derivatives (772 vs. 789, 791 vs. 790, and 297 vs.<br>
686 see Table 2 for structures). Surprisingly, the LC-MS/MS analyses producing collision<br>

high abundance ions, which dramatically enhanced the analytical sensitivity for these<br>
inhibitors (see Table 15 below). This enhanced sensitivity is a distinct advantage for drug<br>
metabolism studies using either in vivo or in vitro systems. Moreover, adamantane represents<br>
the smallest diamond nucleus and the adamantyl substituents not only yield compounds of<br>
improved metabolic stability and pharmacokinetic parameters, but also compounds that are<br>
very easy to detect.<br>

samples were used to measure parent compounds and their metabolites using LC-MS/MS as<br>
described above for experiments with mice. Blood samples were added 400 μL of distilled<br>
water and 25 μL of internal standard (500 ng/mL CTU), and vortexed. The blood samples<br>
were then extracted with 500 μL of ethyl acetate twice and the ethyl acetate layer was dried<br>
under nitrogen. The residue was reconstituted in 25 μL of methanol, and aliquots (10 μL)<br>
were injected onto the LC-MS/MS system as described above. Biological end points came<br>
from clinical chemistry samples run at The University of California Davis Clinical<br>
Laboratory and a series of 6 inflammatory markers including C reactive protein were run<br>
blind at the University of California Davis Department of Nephrology.<br><br>

[0295]    Analysis. Pharmacokinetics analysis was performed using SigmaPlot software<br>
system (SPSS science, Chicago, IL). A one-compartment model was used for blood<br>
concentration-time profiles for the oral gavage dosing and fits to the following equation (see,<br>
Gibson, G.G. and Skett, P.: INTRODUCTION TO DRUG METABOLISM, SECOND ED.,<br>
Chapman and Hall, New York 1994,199-210):<br>
C = ae-bt<br>
The half-life (t1/2) for the elimination phase was calculated by the following equation:<br>
t1/2 = 0.693/b<br>
The area under the concentration (AUC) was calculated by the following equation:<br>
AUC = alb<br>
Where:<br>
-   C = the total blood concentration at time t<br>
-  a = the extrapolated zero intercept<br>
-   b = the apparent first-order elimination rate constant<br>

5 mg/kg dosing of compounds were administered orally to male Swill Webster mice,   maximum<br>
concentration,c time of maximum concentration,d area under concentration,c half-life.<br>
[0296]    The ester compounds were generally hydrolyzed to the acid compound (687) when<br>
administered orally. An example of the time course of free acid appearance is shown in<br>
Figure 10. When compound 687 was administered orally, it reached the maximum<br>
concentration (2-fold higher than 686) in 30 min, while compound 686 reached its maximum<br>
concentration in 2 h. Furthermore, the area under the curve (AUC) for 687 was 2-fold higher,<br>
indicating an improvement in oral bioavailability. The maximum concentrations of primary<br>
esters (780, 784, 783,781, 788, 800, 803 and 804) esters were 1.5-5-fold higher than 687, and<br>
the AUC increased 1.2-2.3-fold for the ester compounds indicating higher bioavailabilities.<br>
On the other hand, secondary esters (785 and 802) showed similar maximum concentrations<br>
and bioavailabilities to those of 687 in mice, while the tertiary ester (801) displayed a 4-8-<br>
fold decrease in maximum concentration and bioavailability. Accordingly, the alkylation of a<br>
potent acid inhibitor (687) to form primary esters improves the oral availability of these<br>
inhibitors.<br>

the relative quantity of 6-methoxy-2-naphthaldehyde formed with an excitation wavelength of 316 nm and an<br>
emission wavelength of 460 mn measured with a SpectraMax M-2 fluorometer (molecular Devices, Sunnyvale<br>

[0298]    The primary urea pharmacophore can be varied (compound #) with amide or<br>
carbamate functionality to improve physical properties of sEH inhibitors as well. The<br>
carbonyls can be replaced by heterocyclic or acyclic hydrogen bond acceptors and donators<br>
as shown in Table 14.<br>
Example 51<br>
[0299]    This example shows the effect of sEH inhibitors on serum and urinary oxylipin<br>
profiles in rodents.<br>
[0300]    The described soluble epoxide inhibitors have been shown to modulate the relative<br>
abundance and amounts of epoxy and dihydroxy fatty acids formed in treated animals. One<br>
such example of this alteration is provided in Figure 13. In this example, hypertension was<br>
induced in one group of Sprague-Dawley rats by the infusion of angiotensin II (ANGII). A<br>
second group of rats received both ANGII and a subcutaneous injection of the model sEH<br>
inhibitor l-adamantyl-3-(dodecanoic acid) urea (i.e. compound 687). Urine samples were<br>
collected for 24hr post exposure to compound 687 and analyzed for linoleate (Panel A) and<br>
arachidonate (Panel B) derived epoxides and diols using LC/MS/MS. As shown in Figure 13,<br>
ANGII exposure decreased the concentration of both linoleate (EpOMEs) and arachidonate<br>
(EETs) derived epoxides and increased arachidonate derived diols (DHETs) but not linoleate<br>
derived diols (DHOMEs). hi the case of both lipid classes, treating animals with compound<br>
687 resulted in an increase in urinary epoxides, as well as a decrease in diol concentrations.<br>
Example 52<br>
[0301]    This example illustrates the effect of certain compounds of the invention on<br>
members of the arachidonic acid cascade.<br>
[0302]    For epoxy fatty acid hydrolysis, the soluble epoxide hydrolase prefers substrates<br>
with epoxide moieties that are more distant from the carboxyl terminal. Specifically the<br>
substrate preference decreases in the order of 14,15-EET &gt; 11,12-EET &gt; 8,9-EET &gt;&gt;&gt; 5,6-<br>
EET for the epoxides of arachidonic acid. Independently, the relative substrate turnover of<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT7US2005/038282<br>

the epoxy arachidonates were calculated at 0.1:8.1:14.3 when a 1:1:2 mixture of 8,9-, 11,12-,<br>
and 14,15-EET fatty acid was hydrolyzed to 30% by rat renal cortex cytosol. By considering<br>
the primary pharmacophore of the urea to be a transition-state analog of epoxide hydrolysis,<br>
inhibitors have now been developed which incorporate long aliphatic acids. These<br>
compounds are better substrate and transition state mimics than those incorporating shorter<br>
aliphatic acids. Accordingly, optimal soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors can be obtained by<br>
producing compounds with aliphatic acid substituents (i.e. a tertiary pharmacophore) which<br>
are separated from the primary pharmacophore by an equivalent distance as the terminal acid<br>
is separated from the epoxide in optimal substrates. Within the enzyme active site, epoxy<br>
fatty acids have been predicted to exist in an extended or pseudo-linear confirmation.<br>
Therefore, both the epoxy fatty acids and the aliphatic acid containing urea structures were<br>
approximated as two dimensional linear representations and measurements were made on<br>
each species. The critical measurements taken were distances (in angstroms) from the<br>
carboxylate hydroxyl to the urea carbonyl and the urea nitrogens.<br>
[0303]    The distance of the carboxylate to the urea function of  l-cyclohexyl-3-octanoic acid<br>
is similar to the distance of the epoxide to the carboxylate in 8,9-EET. Therefore, the<br>
calculated inhibitor potencies were normalized to this compound, resulting in a ranked<br>
inhibitor potency. We then correlated epoxide to carbonyl distance with respect to relative<br>
substrate turnover rate to establish a correlative regression. By plotting the relative inhibitor<br>
potency on this graph we find that the distances of the carboxyl to the N' -nitrogen correlate<br>
best with the carboxyl to epoxide oxygen distance. These data further highlight the similarity<br>
between inhibitor and substrate interaction with the soluble epoxide hydrolase.<br>

PROGRAM LISTING APPENDIX SUBMITTED ON A COMPACT DISK.<br>
[0003]    NOT APPLICABLE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]    Epoxide hydrolases (EHs, EC 3.3.2.3) catalyze the hydrolysis of epoxides or arene<br>
oxides to their corresponding diols by the addition of water (see, Oesch, F., et al.,<br>
Xenobiotica 1973, 3, 305-340). Some EHs play an important role in the metabolism of a<br>
variety of compounds including hormones, chemotherapeutic drugs, carcinogens,<br>
environmental pollutants, mycotoxins, and other harmful foreign compounds.<br>
[0005]    There are two well-studied EHs, microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) and soluble<br>
epoxide hydrolase (sEH). These en2ymes are very distantly related, have different<br>
subcellular localization, and have different but partially overlapping substrate selectivities.<br>
The soluble and microsomal EH forms are known to complement each other in degrading<br>
some plant natural products (see, Hammock, B.D., et al., COMPREHENSIVE<br>
TOXICOLOGY. Oxford: Pergamon Press 1977,283-305 and Fretland, A.J., et al., Chem.<br>
Biol. Intereract 2000,129, 41-59).<br>
[0006]    The major role of the sEH is in the metabolism of lipid epoxides including the<br>
metabolism of arachidonic acid (see, Zeldin, D.C., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1993, 268, 6402-<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                                   PCT/US2005/038282<br>
2<br>
6407), linoleic (see, Moghaddam, M.F., et al, Nat. Med. 1991,3, 562-567) acid, some of<br>
which are endogenous chemical mediators (see, Carroll, M.A., et al., Thorax 2000,55, S13-<br>
16). Epoxides of arachidonic acid (epoxyeicosatrienoic acids or EETs) and other lipid<br>
epoxides and diols are known effectors of blood pressure (see, Capdevila, J.H., et al., J. Lipid.<br>
Res. 2000, 41,163-181), and modulators of vascular permeability (see, Oltman, C.L., et al.,<br>
Circ Res. 1998, 83, 932-939). The vasodilatory properties of EETs are associated with an<br>
increased open-state probability of calcium-activated potassium channels leading to<br>
hyperpolarization of the vascular smooth muscle (see Fisslthaler, B., et al., Nature 1999,401,<br>
493-497). Hydrolysis of the arachidonate epoxides by sEH diminishes this activity (see,<br>
Capdevila, J.H., et al., J. Lipid. Res. 2000, 41,163-181). sEH hydrolysis of EETs also<br>
regulates their incorporation into coronary endothelial phospholipids, suggesting a regulation<br>
of endothelial function by sEH (see, Weintraub, N.L., et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1992, 277,<br>
H2098-2108), It has recently been shown that treatment of spontaneous hypertensive rats<br>
(SHRs) with selective sEH inhibitors significantly reduces their blood pressure (see, Yu, Z.,<br>
et al., Circ. Res. 2000, 87, 992-998). In addition, male knockout sEH mice have significantly<br>
lower blood pressure than wild-type mice (see Sinal, C.J., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2000,275,<br>
40504-405010), further supporting the role of sEH in blood pressure regulation.<br>
[0007]    The EETs have also demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties in endothelial cells<br>
(see, Node, K., et al., Science 1999, 285,1276-1279 and Campbell, W.B. Trends Pharmacol.<br>
Sci. 2000, 21,125-127). In contrast, diols derived from epoxy-linoleate (leukotoxin) perturb<br>
membrane permeability and calcium homeostasis (see, Moghaddam, M.F., et al., Nat. Med.<br>
1997, 3, 562-567), which results in inflammation that is modulated by nitric oxide synthase<br>
and endothelin-1 (see, Ishizaki, T.? et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1995,269, L65-70 and Ishizaki, T.,<br>
et al., J. Appl. Physiol. 1995, 79, 1106-1611). Micromolar concentrations of leukotoxin<br>
reported in association with inflammation and hypoxia (see, Dudda, A., et al., Chem. Phys.<br>
Lipids 1996, 82, 39-51), depress mitochondrial respiration in vitro (see, Sakai, T., et al., Am.<br>
J. Physiol. 1995, 269, L3 26-3 31), and cause mammalian cardiopulmonary toxicity in vivo<br>
(see, Ishizaki, T., et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1995, 269, L65-70; Fukushima, A., et al., Cardiovasc.<br>
Res. 1988, 22, 213-218; and Ishizaki, T., et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1995, 268, L123-128).<br>
Leukotoxin toxicity presents symptoms suggestive of multiple organ failure and acute<br>
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (see, Ozawa, T. et al., Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1988,<br>
137, 535-540). In both cellular and organismal models, leukotoxin-mediated toxicity is<br>
dependent upon epoxide hydrolysis (see, Moghaddam, M.F., et al., Nat. Med. 1997, 3, 562-<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>

567; Morisseau, C., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 1999, 96, 8849-8854; and Zheng, J., et<br>
al., Am. J. Respir. CellMol. Biol. 2001, 25,434-438), suggesting a role for sEH in the<br>
regulation of inflammation and vascular permeability. The bioactivity of these epoxy-fatty<br>
acids suggests that inhibition of vicnal-dihydroxy-lipid biosynthesis may have therapeutic<br>
value, making sEH a promising pharmacological target.<br>
[0008]    Recently, 1,3-disubstituted ureas, carbamates, and amides have been reported as<br>
new potent and stable inhibitors of sEH (Figure 1). See, U.S. Patent No. 6,150,415.<br>
Compounds 192 and 686 are representative structures for this type of inhibitors (Figure 1).<br>
These compounds are competitive tight-binding inhibitors with nanomolar KJ values that<br>
interact stoichiometrically with purified recombinant sEH (see, Morisseau, C, et al., Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1999, 96, 8849-8854). Based on the X-ray crystal structure, the urea<br>
inhibitors were shown to establish hydrogen bonds and to form salt bridges between the urea<br>
function of the inhibitor and residues of the sEH active site, mimicking features encountered<br>
in the reaction coordinate of epoxide ring opening by this enzyme (see, Argiriadi, M.A., et<br>
al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1999, 96,10637-10642 and Argiriadi, M.A., et al., J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 2000, 275,15265-15270). These inhibitors efficiently reduced epoxide hydrolysis in<br>
several in vitro and in vivo models (see, Yu, Z., et al., Circ. Res. 2000, 87, 992-998;<br>
Morisseau, C, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1999, 96, 8849-8854; and Newman, J.W., et<br>
al., Environ. Health Perspect. 2001, 109, 61-66). Despite the high activity associated with<br>
these inhibitors, there exists a need for compounds possessing similar or increased activities,<br>
with improved solubility and pharmacokinetic properties to facilitate formulation and<br>
delivery.<br>
[0009]    Surprisingly, the present invention provides such compounds along with methods<br>
for their use and compositions that contain them.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0019]    Figure 1 provides structures of known sEH inhibitors having only a primary<br>
pharmacophore: l-adamantyl-3-cyclohexylurea (192), l-adamantyl-3-dodecylurea (686).<br>
[0020]    Figure 2 provides a structural diagram defining the sEH inhibitors primary,<br>
secondary, and tertiary pharmacophores. The nomenclature used refers to the three<br>
pharmacophores and two substituents (R and R' groups). The secondary and tertiary<br>
pharmacophores located in the R' area are illustrated linearly from the primary<br>
pharmacophore. The secondary pharmacophore generally consists of a polar carbonyl group<br>
or a polar ether group. When the secondary pharmacophore is a carbonyl group, it is located<br>
about 7.5 ± 1 A from the carbonyl of the primary pharmacophore, with either side of the<br>
carbonyl (X and Y) being a CH2, O or NH. When the secondary pharmacophore is a ether<br>
group it is preferably located about 1 carbon unit further from the carbonyl of the primary<br>
pharmacophore. The tertiary pharmacophore is also a polar group located approximately 11<br>
carbon units (17 ± 1 Å) from the carbonyl of the primary pharmacophore with the Z group as<br>
an OH, or a substituted amine or alcohol or a heterocyclic or acyclic structure mimicing the<br>
terminal ester or acid.<br>
[0021]    Figure 3 provides a hydrophobicity map of the mouse sEH substrate binding pocket<br>
co-crystalyzed with the inhibitor l-cyclohexyl-3-dodecyl urea. A shading gradient indicates<br>
degrees of hydrophobicity. A series of hydrophilic residues were observed on the "top" side<br>
of the channel, while the "bottom" of the channel was very hydrophobic, with the exception<br>
of the catalytic aspartate (Asp333). This structural analysis indicated that a number of<br>
potential hydrogen bonding sites are observed in the substrate binding pocket of the soluble<br>
epoxide hydrolase, primarily located on the surface opposite Asp333 (the catalytic nucleophile<br>
which reacts with the substrate or binds to the primary pharmacophores).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Abbreviations and Definitions:<br>
[0036]    "cis-Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids" ("EETs") are biomediators synthesized by<br>
cytochrome P450 epoxygenases.<br>
[0037]    "Epoxide hydrolases" ("EH;" EC 3.3.2.3) are enzymes in the alpha / beta hydrolase<br>
fold family that add water to 3 membered cyclic ethers termed epoxides.<br>
[0038]    "Soluble epoxide hydrolase" ("sEH") is an enzyme which in endothelial, smooth<br>
muscle and other cell types converts EETs to dihydroxy derivatives called<br>
dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids ("DHETs"). The cloning and sequence of the murine sEH is<br>
set forth in Grant et al, J. Biol Chem. 268(23):17628-17633 (1993). The cloning, sequence,<br>
and accession numbers of the human sEH sequence are set forth in Beetham et al., Arch.<br>
Biochem. Biophys. 305(1): 197-201 (1993). The amino acid sequence of human sEH is also<br>
set forth as SEQ ID NO.2 of U.S. Patent No. 5,445,956; the nucleic acid sequence encoding<br>
the human sEH is set forth as nucleotides 42-1703 of SEQ ID NO:1 of that patent The<br>
evolution and nomenclature of the gene is discussed in Beetham et al., DNA Cell Biol.<br>
14(1):61-71 (1995). Soluble epoxide hydrolase represents a single highly conserved gene<br>
product with over 90% homology between rodent and human (Arand et al., FEBS Lett.,<br>
338:251-256 (1994)).<br>
[0039]    The terms "treat", "treating" and "treatment" refer to any method of alleviating or<br>
abrogating a disease or its attendant symptoms.<br>
[0040]    The term "therapeutically effective amount" refers to that amount of the compound<br>
being administered sufficient to prevent or decrease the development of one or more of the<br>
symptoms of the disease, condition or disorder being treated.<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>
10<br>
[0041]    The term "modulate" refers to the ability of a compound to increase or decrease the<br>
function, or activity, of the associated activity (e.g., soluble epoxide hydrolase).<br>
"Modulation", as used herein in its various forms, is meant to include antagonism and partial<br>
antagonism of the activity associated with sEH. Inhibitors of sEH are compounds that, e.g.,<br>
bind to, partially or totally block the enzyme's activity.<br>
[0042]    The term "compound" as used herein is intended to encompass not only the<br>
specified molecular entity but also its pharmaceutically acceptable, pharmacologically active<br>
derivatives, including, but not limited to, salts, prodrug conjugates such as esters and amides,<br>
metabolites and the like.<br>
[0043]    The term "composition" as used herein is intended to encompass a product<br>
comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which<br>
results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified<br>
amounts. By "pharmaceutically acceptable" it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must<br>
be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the<br>
recipient thereof.<br>
[0044]    The "subject" is defined herein to include animals such as mammals, including, but<br>
not limited to, primates (e.g., humans), cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, rats,<br>
mice and the like. In some embodiments, the subject is a human.<br>
[0045]    As used herein, the term "sEH-mediated disease or condition" and the like refers to<br>
a disease or condition characterized by less than or greater than normal, sEH activity. A<br>
sEH-mediated disease or condition is one in which modulation of sEH results in some effect<br>
on the underlying condition or disease (e.g., a sEH inhibitor or antagonist results in some<br>
improvement in patient well-being in at least some patients).<br>
[0046]    "Parenchyma" refers to the tissue characteristic of an organ, as distinguished from<br>
associated connective or supporting tissues.<br>
[0047]    "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease" or "COPD" is also sometimes known as<br>
"chronic obstructive airway disease", "chronic obstructive lung disease", and "chronic<br>
airways disease." COPD is generally defined as a disorder characterized by reduced maximal<br>
expiratory flow and slow forced emptying of the lungs. COPD is considered to encompass<br>
two related conditions, emphysema and chronic bronchitis. COPD can be diagnosed by the<br>
general practitioner using art recognized techniques, such as the patient's forced vital capacity<br>
("FVC"), the maximum volume of air that can be forceably expelled after a maximal<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>
11<br>
inhalation. In the offices of general practitioners, the FVC is typically approximated by a 6<br>
second maximal exhalation through a spirometer. The definition, diagnosis and treatment of<br>
COPD, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis are well known in the art and discussed in detail<br>
by, for example, Honig and Ingram, in Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, (Fauci et<br>
al., Eds.), 14th Ed., 1998, McGraw-Hill, New York, pp. 1451-1460 (hereafter, "Harrison's<br>
Principles of Internal Medicine").<br>
[0048]    "Emphysema" is a disease of the lungs characterized by permanent destructive<br>
enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles without obvious fibrosis.<br>
[0049]    "Chronic bronchitis" is a disease of the lungs characterized by chronic bronchial<br>
secretions which last for most days of a month, for three months a year, for two years.<br>
[0050]    As the names imply, "obstructive pulmonary disease" and "obstructive lung disease"<br>
refer to obstructive diseases, as opposed to restrictive diseases. These diseases particularly<br>
include COPD, bronchial asthma and small airway disease.<br>
[0051]    "Small airway disease." There is a distinct minority of patients whose airflow<br>
obstruction is due, solely or predominantly to involvement of the small airways. These are<br>
defined as airways less than 2 mm in diameter and correspond to small cartilaginous bronchi,<br>
terminal bronchioles and respiratory bronchioles. Small airway disease (SAD) represents<br>
luminal obstruction by inflammatory and fibrotic changes that increase airway resistance.<br>
The obstruction may be transient or permanent.<br>
[0052]    The "interstitial lung diseases (ILDs)" are a group of conditions involving the<br>
alveolar walls, perialveolar tissues, and contiguous supporting structures. As discussed on<br>
the website of the American Lung Association, the tissue between the air sacs of the lung is<br>
the interstitium, and this is the tissue affected by fibrosis in the disease. Persons with the<br>
disease have difficulty breathing in because of the stiffness of the lung tissue but, in contrast<br>
to persons with obstructive lung disease, have no difficulty breathing out. The definition,<br>
diagnosis and treatment of interstitial lung diseases are well known in the art and discussed in<br>
detail by, for example, Reynolds, H.Y., in Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, supra,<br>
at pp. 1460-1466. Reynolds notes that, while ILDs have various initiating events, the<br>
immunopathological responses of lung tissue are limited and the ILDs therefore have<br>
common features.<br>
[0053]    "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis," or "IPF," is considered the prototype ILD.<br>
Although it is idiopathic in that the cause is not known, Reynolds, supra, notes that the term<br>
refers to a well defined clinical entity.<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>

[0054]    "Bronchoalveolar lavage," or "BAL," is a test which permits removal and<br>
examination of cells from the lower respiratory tract and is used in humans as a diagnostic<br>
procedure for pulmonary disorders such as IPF. In human patients, it is usually performed<br>
during bronchoscopy.<br>
[0055]    As used herein, the term "alkyl" refers to a saturated hydrocarbon radical which may<br>
be straight-chain or branched-chain (for example, ethyl, isopropyl, t-amyl, or 2,5-<br>
dimethylhexyl). This definition applies both when the term is used alone and when it is used<br>
as part of a compound term, such as "aralkyl," "alkylamino" and similar terms. In some<br>
embodiments, alkyl groups are those containing 1 to 24 carbon atoms. All numerical ranges<br>
in this specification and claims are intended to be inclusive of their upper and lower limits.<br>
Lower alkyl refers to those alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Additionally, the alkyl<br>
and heteroalkyl groups may be attached to other moieties at any position on the alkyl or<br>
heteroalkyl radical which would otherwise be occupied by a hydrogen atom (such as, for<br>
example, 2-pentyl, 2-methylpent-l-yl and 2-propyloxy). Divalent alkyl groups may be<br>
referred to as "alkylene", and divalent heteroalkyl groups may be referred to as<br>
"heteroalkylene" such as those groups used as linkers in the present invention. The alkyl,<br>
alkylene, and heteroalkyl moieties may also be optionally substituted with halogen atoms, or<br>
other groups such as oxo, cyano, nitro, alkyl, alkylamino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, alkoxy,<br>
aryloxy, and the like.<br>
[0056]    The terms "cycloalkyl" and "cycloalkenyl" refer to a saturated hydrocarbon ring and<br>
includes bicyclic and polycyclic rings. Similarly, cycloalkyl and cycloalkenyl groups having<br>
a heteroatom (e.g. N, O or S) in place of a carbon ring atom may be referred to as<br>
"heterocycloalkyl" and heterocycloalkylene," respectively. Examples of cycloalkyl and<br>
heteroaryl groups are, for example, cyclohexyl, norbornyl, adamantly, morpholinyl,<br>
thiomorpholinyl, dioxothiomorphorinyl, and the like. The cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl<br>
moieties may also be optionally substituted with halogen atoms, or other groups such as nitro,<br>
alkyl, alkylamino, carboxyl, alkoxy, aryloxy and the like. In some embodiments, cycloalkyl<br>
and cycloalkenyl moieties are those having 3 to 12 carbon atoms in the ring (e.g., cyclohexyl,<br>
cyclooctyl, norbornyl, adamantyl, and the like). In some embodiments, heterocycloalkyl and<br>
heterocycloalkylene moieties are those having 1 to 3 hetero atoms in the ring (e.g.,<br>
morpholinyl, Momorpholinyl, dioxothiomorphonnyl, piperidinyl and the like). Additionally,<br>
the term "(cycloalkyl)alkyl" refers to a group having a cycloalkyl moiety attached to an alkyl<br>
moiety. Examples are cyclohexylmethyl, cyclohexylethyl and cyclopentylpropyl.<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>

[0057]    The term "alkenyl" as used herein refers to an alkyl group as described above which<br>
contains one or more sites of unsaturation that is a double bond. Similarly, the term<br>
"alkynyl" as used herein refers to an alkyl group as described above which contains one or<br>
more sites of unsaturation that is a triple bond.<br>
[0058]    The term "alkoxy" refers to an alkyl radical as described above which also bears an<br>
oxygen substituent which is capable of covalent attachment to another hydrocarbon radical<br>
(such as, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, aryloxy and t-butoxy).<br>
[0059]    The term "aryl" refers to an aromatic carbocyclic substituent which may be a single<br>
ring or multiple rings which are fused together, linked covalently or linked to a common<br>
group such as an ethylene or methylene moiety. Similarly, aryl groups having a heteroatom<br>
(e.g. N, O or S) in place of a carbon ring atom are referred to as "heteroaryl". Examples of<br>
aryl and heteroaryl groups are, for example, phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl, diphenylmethyl, 2,2-<br>
diphenyl-1-ethyl, thienyl, pyridyl and quinoxalyl. The aryl and heteroaryl moieties may also<br>
be optionally substituted with halogen atoms, or other groups such as nitro, alkyl, alkylamino,<br>
carboxyl, alkoxy, phenoxy and the like. Additionally, the aryl and heteroaryl groups may be<br>
attached to other moieties at any position on the aryl or heteroaryl radical which would<br>
otherwise be occupied by a hydrogen atom (such as, for example, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl and 4-<br>
pyridyl). Divalent aryl groups are "arylene", and divalent heteroaryl groups are referred to as<br>
"heteroarylene" such as those groups used as linkers in the present invention.<br>
[0060]    The terms "arylalkyl", "arylalkenyl" and "aryloxyalkyl" refer to an aryl radical<br>
attached directly to an alkyl group, an alkenyl group, or an oxygen which is attached to an<br>
alkyl group, respectively. For brevity, aryl as part of a combined term as above, is meant to<br>
include heteroaryl as well.<br>
[0061]    The terms "halo" or "halogen," by themselves or as part of another substituent,<br>
mean, unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally,<br>
terms such as "haloalkyl," are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl. For<br>
example, the term "C1-C6 haloalkyl" is mean to include trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl,<br>
4-chlorobutyl, 3-bromopropyl, and the like.<br>
[0062]    The term "hetero" as used in a "heteroatom-containing alkyl group" (a "heteroalkyl"<br>
group) or a "heteroatom-containing aryl group" (a "heteroaryl" group) refers to a molecule,<br>
linkage or substituent in which one or more carbon atoms are replaced with an atom other<br>
than carbon, e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus or silicon, typically nitrogen, oxygen<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>

or sulfur or more thatnone non-carbon atom (e.g., sulfonamide). Similarly, the term<br>
"heteroalkyl" refers to an alkyl substituent that is heteroatom-containing, the term<br>
"heterocyclic" refers to a cyclic substituent that is heteroatom-containing, the terms<br>
"heteroaryl" and heteroaromatic" respectively refer to "aryl" and "aromatic" substituents that<br>
are heteroatom-containing, and the like. Examples of heteroalkyl groups include alkoxyaryl,<br>
alkylsulfanyl-substituted alkyl, N-alkylated amino alkyl, and the like. Examples of heteroaryl<br>
substituents include pyrrolyl, pyrrolidinyl, pyridinyl, quinolinyl, indolyl, pyrimidinyl,<br>
imidazolyl, 1,2,4-triazolyl, tetrazolyl, etc., and examples of heteroatom-containing alicyclic<br>
groups are pyrrolidino, morpholino, piperazino, piperidino, etc.<br>
[0063]    The term "hydrophobic radical" or "hydrophobic group" refers to a group which<br>
lowers the water solubility of a molecule. In some embodiments, hydrophobic radicals are<br>
groups containing at least 3 carbon atoms.<br>
[0064]    The term "carboxylic acid analog" refers to a variety of groups having an acidic<br>
moiety that are capable of mimicking a carboxylic acid residue. Examples of such groups are<br>
sulfonic acids, sulflnic acids, phosphoric acids, phosphonic acids, phosphinic acids,<br>
sulfonamides, and heterocyclic moieties such as, for example, imidazoles, triazoles and<br>
tetrazoles.<br>
[0065]    The term "substituted" refers to the replacement of an atom or a group of atoms of a<br>
compound with another atom or group of atoms. For example, an atom or a group of atoms<br>
may be substituted with one or more of the following substituents or groups: halo, cyano,<br>
nitro, alkyl, alkylamino, hydroxyalkyl, haloalkyl, carboxyl, hydroxyl, alkoxy, alkoxyalkoxy,<br>

alkylaminosulfonyl, dialkylaminosulfonyl and arylaminosulfonyl. When the term<br>
"substituted" appears prior to a list of possible substituted groups, it is intended that the term<br>
apply to every member of that group.<br>
[0066]    The term "unsubstituted" refers to a native compound that lacks replacement of an<br>
atom or a group of atoms.<br>
General:<br>
[0067]    The present invention derives from the discovery that 1,3-disubstituted ureas (or the<br>
corresponding amides or carbamates, also referred to as the primary pharmacophore) can be<br>
further functionalized to provide more potent sEH inhibitors with improved physical<br>
properties. As described herein, the introduction of secondary and/or tertiary<br>
pharmacophores can increase water solubility and oral availability of sEH inhibitors (see<br>
Figure 2). The combination of the three pharmacophores (see the compounds of Table 18)<br>
provides a variety of compounds of increased water solubility.<br>
[0068]    The discovery of the secondary and tertiary pharmacophores has also led to the<br>
employment of combinatorial chemistry approaches for establishing a wide spectrum of<br>
compounds having sEH inhibitory activity. The polar pharmacophores divide the molecule<br>
into domains each of which can be easily manipulated by common chemical approaches in a<br>
combinatorial manner, leading to the design and confirmation of novel orally available<br>
therapeutic agents for the treatment of diseases such as hypertension and vascular<br>
inflammation. The agents of the present invention treat such diseases while simultaneously<br>
increasing sodium excretion, reducing vascular and renal inflammation, and reducing male<br>
erectile dysfunction As shown below (see Example 51 and Figure 13), alterations in<br>
solubility, bioavailability and pharmacological properties leads to compounds that can alter<br>
the regulatory lipids of experimental animals increasing the relative amounts of epoxy<br>
arachidonate derivatives when compared either to their diol products or to the<br>
proinflammatory and hypertensive hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). Since epoxy<br>
arachidonates are anti-hypertensive and anti-inflammatory, altering the lipid ratios can lead to<br>
reduced blood pressure and reduced vascular and renal inflammation. This approach has<br>
been validated in a patient approaching end stage renal disease (ESRD) where even a brief<br>
oral treatment with low doses compound 800 altered the serum profile of regulatory lipids in<br>
a positive manner. This resulted in reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure, a dramatic<br><br>

reduction in blood urea nitrogen (an indicator of renal inflammation) and dramatically<br>
reduced serum levels of C reactive protein (a common indicator of vascular inflammation).<br>
[0069]    Without intending to be bound by theory, and with reference to Figures 2, 3, 4 and<br>
5, it is believed that the left side of the primary pharmacophore or R (in Figure 2) can be<br>
varied to obtain optimal properties as can the primary pharmacophore, which contains groups<br>
able to hydrogen bond to the catalytic aspartic acid on one side and the catalytic tyrosines on<br>
the other (see Figure 3). The right side of the primary pharmacophore is effectively divided<br>
into 4 segments: a spacer separating the primary and secondary pharmacophore (termed L1 in<br>
the present invention), the secondary pharmacophore (termed P2 in the present invention)<br>
and a tertiary pharmacophore (P3) flanked by a spacer (L2) and finally a terminating group Z<br>
(collectively provided with the tertiary pharmacophore as P3). The spacer between the<br>
primary and secondary pharmacophores, is optimally 3 atom units in length, while the<br>
secondary pharmacophore can be, for example, a ketone, carbonate, amide, carbamate, urea,<br>
ether/polyether, ester or other functionality able to form a hydrogen bond with the enzyme<br>
approximately 7.5 angstroms from the carbonyl of the primary pharmacophore. The<br>
identified tertiary pharmacophore consists of a polar group located approximately six to<br>
eleven carbon units from the primary pharmacophore (see Figure 2). A conserved asparagine<br>
residue (Asn471, see Figures 4 and 5) is thought to provide the site of interaction between the<br>
protein and the polar functionality located at this tertiary site. While, in the rodent a<br>
threonine (Thr468) is also in an appropriate position for hydrogen bonding, residue 468 is a<br>
methionine in the human enzyme (Figure 5). As with the secondary pharmacophore, this<br>
group improves water solubility of sEH inhibitors as well as the specificity for the sEH, and a<br>
wide diversity of functionalities such as an ester, amide, carbamate, or similar functionalities<br>
capable of donating or accepting a hydrogen bond similarly can contribute to this polar<br>
group. For example, in pharmaceutical chemistry heterocyclic groups are commonly used to<br>
mimic carbonyls as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. Of course the primary, secondary<br>
and tertiary pharmacophore groups can be combined in a single molecule with suitable<br>
spacers to improve activity or present the inhibitor as a prodrug.<br>

TyrGly, Tyrlle, TyrLeu, TyrLys, TyrMet, TyrPhe, TyrPro, TyrSer, TyrThr, TyrTrp, TyrTyr<br>
and TyrVal. More preferably, L2 is selected from TyrArg, TyrAsp, TyrMet, TyrPhe, TyrSer,<br>
TyrTrp, TyrTyr and TyrVal. in which the Tyr amino acid is linked to P2 in a manner to afford<br>
an amide linkage. As above, these dipeptides are also meant to refer to their corresponding<br>
methyl or ethyl esters, as well as their carboxamide derivatives (e.g., terminal -C(O)NH2).<br>
Most preferably, the compounds are those provided in Table 12.<br>
Assays to Monitor Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Activity:<br>
[0089]    Additionally, the present invention provides a variety of assays and associated<br>
methods for monitoring soluble epoxide hydrolase activity, particularly the activity that has<br>
been modulated by the administration of one or more of the compounds provided above.<br>
[0090]    In one group of embodiments, the invention provides methods for reducing the<br>
formation of a biologically active diol produced by the action of a soluble epoxide hydrolase,<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>

the method comprising contacting the soluble epoxide hydrolase with an amount of a<br>
compound of formula (I) above, sufficient to inhibit the activity of the soluble epoxide<br>
hydrolase and reduce the formation of the biologically active diol.<br>
[0091]    In another group of embodiments, the invention provides methods for stabilizing<br>
biologically active epoxides in the presence of a soluble epoxide hydrolase, the method<br>
comprising contacting the soluble epoxide hydrolase with an amount of a compound of<br>
formula (I), sufficient to inhibit the activity of the soluble epoxide hydrolase and stabilize the<br>
biologically active epoxide.<br>
[0092] In each of these groups of embodiments, the methods can be carried out as part of<br>
an in vitro assay or the methods can be carried out in vivo by monitoring blood liters of the<br>
respective biologically active epoxide or diol.<br>
[0093]    Epoxides and diols of some fatty acids are biologically important chemical<br>
mediators and are involved in several biological processes. The strongest biological data<br>
support the action of oxylipins as chemical mediators between the vascular endothelium and<br>
vascular smooth muscle. Accordingly, the epoxy lipids are anti-inflammatory and anti-<br>
hypertensive. Additionally, the lipids are thought to be metabolized by beta-oxidation, as<br>
well as by epoxide hydration. The soluble epoxide hydrolase is considered to be the major<br>
enzyme involved in the hydrolytic metabolism of these oxylipins. The compounds of<br>
formula (I) can inhibit the epoxide hydrolase and stabilize the epoxy lipids both in vitro and<br>
in vivo. This activity results in a reduction of hypertension in four separate rodent models.<br>
Moreover, the inhibitors show a reduction in renal inflammation associated with and<br>
independent of the hypertensive models.<br>
[0094]    More particularly, the present invention provides methods for monitoring a variety<br>
of lipids in both the arachidonate and linoleate cascade simultaneously in order to address the<br>
biology of the system. A GLC-MS system or a LC-MS method can be used to monitor over<br>
740 analytes in a highly quantitative fashion in a single injection. The analytes include the<br>
regioisomers of the arachidonate epoxides (EETs), the diols (DHETs), as well as other P450<br>
products including HETEs. Characteristic products of the cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and<br>
peroxidase pathways in both the arachidonate and linoleate series can also be monitored.<br>
Such methods are particularly useful as being predictive of certain disease states. The<br>
oxylipins can be monitored in mammals following the administration of inhibitors of epoxide<br><br>

hydrolase. Generally, EH inhibitors increase epoxy lipid concentrations at the expense of<br>
diol concentrations in body fluids and tissues.<br>
[0095]    Other compounds for use in this aspect of the invention are those inhibitors of<br>
formula (I) in which the primary pharmacophore is separated from a tertiary pharmacophore<br>
by a distance that approximates the distance between the terminal carboxylic acid and an<br>
epoxide functional group in the natural substrate.<br>
Methods of Treating Diseases Modulated by Soluble Epoxide Hvdrolases:<br>
[0096]    In another aspect, the present invention provides methods of treating diseases,<br>
especially those modulated by soluble epoxide hydrolases (sEH). The methods generally<br>
involve administering to a subject in need of such treatment an effective amount of a<br>
compound having a formula (I) above. The dose, frequency and timing of such administering<br>
will depend in large part on the selected therapeutic agent, the nature of the condition being<br>
treated, the condition of the subject including age, weight and presence of other conditions or<br>
disorders, the formulation being administered and the discretion of the attending physician.<br>
Preferably, the compositions and compounds of the invention and the pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts thereof are administered via oral, parenteral, subcutaneous, intramuscular,<br>
intravenous or topical routes. Generally, the compounds are administered in dosages ranging<br>
from about 2 mg up to about 2,000 mg per day, although variations will necessarily occur<br>
depending, as noted above, on the disease target, the patient, and the route of administration.<br>
Dosages are administered orally in the range of about 0.05 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg, more<br>
preferably in the range of about 0.05 mg/kg to about 2 mg/kg, most preferably in the range of<br>
about 0.05 mg/kg to about 0.2 mg per kg of body weight per day. The dosage employed for<br>
the topical administration will, of course, depend on the size of the area being treated.<br>
[0097]    It has previously been shown that inhibitors of soluble epoxide hydrolase ("sEH")<br>
can reduce hypertension. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,351,506. Such inhibitors can be useful<br>
in controlling the blood pressure of persons with undesirably high blood pressure, including<br>
those who suffer from diabetes.<br>
[0098] In some embodiments, compounds of formula (I) are administered to a subject in<br>
need of treatment for hypertension, specifically renal, hepatic, or pulmonary hypertension;<br>
inflammation, specifically renal inflammation, vascular inflammation, and lung<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>

inflammation; adult respiratory distress syndrome; diabetic complications; end stage renal<br>
disease; Raynaud syndrome and arthritis.<br>
Methods for Inhibiting Progression of Kidney Deterioration (Nephropathv) and<br>
Reducing Blood Pressnre:<br>
[0099]    In another aspect of the invention, the compounds of the invention can reduce<br>
damage to the kidney, and especially damage to kidneys from diabetes, as measured by<br>
albuminuria. The compounds of the invention can reduce kidney deterioration (nephropathy)<br>
from diabetes even in individuals who do not have high blood pressure. The conditions of<br>
therapeautic administration are as described above.<br>
[0100]    cis-Epoxyeicosantrienoic acids ("EETs") can be used in conjunction with the<br>
compounds of the invention to further reduce kidney damage. EETs, which are epoxides of<br>
arachidonic acid, are known to be effectors of blood pressure, regulators of inflammation,<br>
and modulators of vascular permeability. Hydrolysis of the epoxides by sEH diminishes this<br>
activity. Inhibition of sEH raises the level of EETs since the rate at which the EETs are<br>
hydrolyzed into DHETs is reduced. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed<br>
that raising the level of EETs interferes with damage to kidney cells by the microvasculature<br>
changes and other pathologic effects of diabetic hyperglycemia. Therefore, raising the EET<br>
level in the kidney is believed to protect the kidney from progression from microalbummuria<br>
to end stage renal disease.<br>
[0101]    EETs are well known in the art. EETs useful in the methods of the present<br>
invention include 14,15-EET, 8,9-EET and 11,12-EET, and 5,6 EETs, in that order of<br>
preference. Preferably, the EETs are administered as the methyl ester, which is more stable.<br>
Persons of skill will recognize that the EETs are regioisomers, such as 8S,9R- and 14R,15S-<br>
EET. 8,9-EET, 11,12-EET, and 14R,15S-EET, are commercially available from, for<br>
example, Sigma-Aldrich (catalog nos. E5516, E5641, and E5766, respectively, Sigma-<br>
Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO).<br>
[0102]    EETs produced by the endothelium have anti-hypertensive properties and the EETs<br>
11,12-EET and 14,15-EET may be endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors (EDHFs).<br>
Additionally, EETs such as 11,12-EET have profibrinolytic effects, anti-inflammatory actions<br>
and inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration. In the context of the present<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>
31<br>
invention, these favorable properties are believed to protect the vasculature and organs during<br>
renal and cardiovascular disease states.<br>
[0103]    It is now believed that sEH activity can be inhibited sufficiently to increase the<br>
levels of EETs and thus augment the effects of administering sEH inhibitors by themselves.<br>
This permits EETs to be used in conjunction with one or more sEH inhibitors to reduce<br>
nephropathy in the methods of the invention. It further permits EETs to be used in<br>
conjunction with one or more sEH inhibitors to reduce hypertension, or inflammation, or<br>
both. Thus, medicaments of EETs can be made which can be administered in conjunction<br>
with one or more sEH inhibitors, or a medicament containing one or more sEH inhibitors can<br>
optionally contain one or more EETs.<br>
[0104]    The EETs can be administered concurrently with the sEH inhibitor, or following<br>
administration of the sEH inhibitor. It is understood that, like all drugs, inhibitors have half<br>
lives defined by the rate at which they are metabolized by or excreted from the body, and that<br>
the inhibitor will have a period following administration during which it will be present in<br>
amounts sufficient to be effective. If EETs are administered after the inhibitor is<br>
administered, therefore, it is desirable that the EETs be administered during the period during<br>
which the inhibitor will be present in amounts to be effective to delay hydrolysis of the EETs.<br>
Typically, the EET or EETs will be administered within 48 hours of administering an sEH<br>
inhibitor. Preferably, the EET or EETs are administered within 24 hours of the inhibitor, and<br>
even more preferably within 12 hours. In increasing order of desirability, the EET or EETs<br>
are administered within 10, 8, 6,4, 2, hours, 1 hour, or one half hour after administration of<br>
the inhibitor. Most preferably, the EET or EETs are administered concurrently with the<br>
inhibitor.<br>
[0105]    In some embodiments, the EETs, the compound of the invention, or both, are<br>
provided in a material that permits them to be released over time to provide a longer duration<br>
of action. Slow release coatings are well known in the pharmaceutical art; the choice of the<br>
particular slow release coating is not critical to the practice of the present invention.<br>
[0106]    EETs are subject to degradation under acidic conditions. Thus, if the EETs are to be<br>
administered orally, it is desirable that they are protected from degradation in the stomach.<br>
Conveniently, EETs for oral administration may be coated to permit them to passage the<br>
acidic environment of the stomach into the basic environment of the intestines. Such<br>
coatings are well known in the art. For example, aspirin coated with so-called "enteric<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>
32<br>
coatings" is widely available commercially.   Such enteric coatings may be used to protect<br>
EETs during passage through the stomach. An exemplary coating is set forth in the<br>
Examples.<br>
[0107]    While the anti-hypertensive effects of EETs have been recognized, EETs have not<br>
been administered to treat hypertension because it was thought endogenous sEH would<br>
hydro! yse the EETs too quickly for them to have any useful effect. Surprisingly, it was found<br>
during the course of the studies underlying the present invention that exogenously<br>
administered inhibitors of sEH succeeded in inhibiting sEH sufficiently that levels of EETs<br>
could be further raised by the administration of exogenous EETs. These findings underlie the<br>
co-administration of sEH inhibitors and of EETs described above with respect to inhibiting<br>
the development and progression of nephropathy. This is an important improvement in<br>
augmenting treatment. While levels of endogenous EETs are expected to rise with the<br>
inhibition of sEH activity caused by the action of the sEH inhibitor, and therefore to result in<br>
at least some improvement in symptoms or pathology, it may not be sufficient in all cases to<br>
inhibit progression of kidney damage fully or to the extent intended. This is particularly true<br>
where the diseases or other factors have reduced the endogenous concentrations of EETs<br>
below those normally present in healthy individuals. Administration of exogenous EETs in<br>
conjunction with a sEH inhibitor is therefore expected to be beneficial and to augment the<br>
effects of the sEH inhibitor in reducing the progression of diabetic nephropathy.<br>
[0108]    The present invention can be used with regard to any and all forms of diabetes to the<br>
extent that they are associated with progressive damage to the kidney or kidney function.<br>
The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction,<br>
and failure of various organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels.<br>
The long-term complications of diabetes include retinopathy with potential loss of vision;<br>
nephropathy leading to renal failure; peripheral neuropathy with risk of foot ulcers,<br>
amputation, and Charcot joints.<br>
[0109]    In addition, persons with metabolic syndrome are at high risk of progression to type<br>
2 diabetes, and therefore at higher risk than average for diabetic nephropathy. It is therefore<br>
desirable to monitor such individuals for microalbuminuria, and to administer a sEH inhibitor<br>
and, optionally, one or more EETs, as an intervention to reduce the development of<br>
nephropathy. The practitioner may wait until microalbuminuria is seen before beginning the<br>
intervention. As noted above, a person can be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome without<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>
33<br>
having a blood pressure of 130/85 or higher. Both persons with blood pressure of 130/85 or<br>
higher and persons with blood pressure below 130/85 can benefit from the administration of<br>
sEH inhibitors and, optionally, of one or more EETs, to slow the progression of damage to<br>
their kidneys. In some embodiments, the person has metabolic syndrome and blood pressure<br>
below 130/85.<br>
[0110]    Dyslipidemia or disorders of lipid metabolism is another risk factor for heart<br>
disease. Such disorders include an increased level of LDL cholesterol, a reduced level of<br>
HDL cholesterol, and an increased level of triglycerides. An increased level of serum<br>
cholesterol, and especially of LDL cholesterol, is associated with an increased risk of heart<br>
disease. The kidneys are also damaged by such high levels. It is believed that high levels of<br>
triglycerides are associated with kidney damage. In particular, levels of cholesterol over 200<br>
mg/dL, and especially levels over 225 mg/dL, would suggest that sEH inhibitors and,<br>
optionally, EETs, should be administered. Similarly, triglyceride levels of more than 215<br>
mg/dL, and especially of 250 mg/dL or higher, would indicate that administration of sEH<br>
inhibitors and, optionally, of EETs, would be desirable. The administration of compounds of<br>
the present invention with or without the EETs, can reduce the need to administer statin drugs<br>
(HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) to the patients, or reduce the amount of the statins needed.<br>
In some embodiments, candidates for the methods, uses and compositions of the invention<br>
have triglyceride levels over 215 mg/dL and blood pressure below 130/85. In some<br>
embodiments, the candidates have triglyceride levels over 250 mg/dL and blood pressure<br>
below 130/85. In some embodiments, candidates for the methods, uses and compositions of<br>
the invention have cholesterol levels over 200 mg/dL and blood pressure below 130/85. In<br>
some embodiments, the candidates have cholesterol levels over 225 mg/dL and blood<br>
pressure below 130/85.<br>
Methods of Inhibiting the Proliferation of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells:<br>
[0111]    In other embodiments, compounds of formula (I) inhibit proliferation of vascular<br>
smooth muscle (VSM) cells without significant cell toxicity, (e.g. specific to VSM cells).<br>
Because VSM cell proliferation is an integral process in the pathophysiology of<br>
atherosclerosis, these compounds are suitable for slowing or inhibition atherosclerosis. These<br>
compounds are useful to subjects at risk for atherosclerosis, such as individuals who have had<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>
34<br>
a heart attack or a test result showing decreased blood circulation to the heart. The conditions<br>
of therapeautic administration are as described above.<br>
[0112]    The methods of the invention are particularly useful for patients who have had<br>
percutaneous intervention, such as angioplasty to reopen a narrowed artery, to reduce or to<br>
slow the narrowing of the reopened passage by restenosis. In some embodiments, the artery<br>
is a coronary artery. The compounds of the invention can be placed on stents in polymeric<br>
coatings to provide a controlled localized release to reduce restenosis. Polymer compositions<br>
for implantable medical devices, such as stents, and methods for embedding agents in the<br>
polymer for controlled release, are known in the art and taught, for example, in U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 6,335,029; 6,322,847; 6,299,604; 6,290,722; 6,287,285; and 5,637,113. In some<br>
embodiments, the coating releases the inhibitor over a period of time, preferably over a<br>
period of days, weeks, or months. The particular polymer or other coating chosen is not a<br>
critical part of the present invention.<br>
[0113]    The methods of the invention are useful for slowing or inhibiting the stenosis or<br>
restenosis of natural and synthetic vascular grafts. As noted above in connection with stents,<br>
desirably, the synthetic vascular graft comprises a material which releases a compound of the<br>
invention over time to slow or inhibit VSM proliferation and the consequent stenosis of the<br>
graft. Hemodialysis grafts are a particular embodiment.<br>
[0114]    In addition to these uses, the methods of the invention can be used to slow or to"<br>
inhibit stenosis or restenosis of blood vessels of persons who have had a heart attack, or<br>
whose test results indicate that they are at risk of a heart attack.<br>
[0115]    In one group of embodiments, compounds of the invention are administered to<br>
reduce proliferation of VSM cells in persons who do not have hypertension. In another group<br>
of embodiments, compounds of the invention are used to reduce proliferation of VSM cells in<br>
persons who are being treated for hypertension, but with an agent that is not an sEH inhibitor.<br>
[0116]    The compounds of the invention can be used to interfere with the proliferation of<br>
cells which exhibit inappropriate cell cycle regulation, hi one important set of embodiments,<br>
the cells are cells of a cancer. The proliferation of such cells can be slowed or inhibited by<br>
contacting the cells with a compound of the invention. The determination of whether a<br>
particular compound of the invention can slow or inhibit the proliferation of cells of any<br>
particular type of cancer can be determined using assays routine in the art.<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>
35<br>
[0117]    In addition to the use of the compounds of the invention, the levels of EETs can be<br>
raised by adding EETs. VSM cells contacted with both an EET and a compound of the<br>
invention exhibited slower proliferation than cells exposed to either the EET alone or to the a<br>
compound of the invention alone. Accordingly, if desired, the slowing or inhibition of VSM<br>
cells of a compound of the invention can be enhanced by adding an EET along with a<br>
compound of the invention. In the case of stents or vascular grafts, for example, this can<br>
conveniently be accomplished by embedding the EET in a coating along with a compound of<br>
the invention so that both are released once the stent or graft is in position.<br>
Methods of Inhibiting the Progression of Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Interstitial<br>
Lung Disease, or Asthma:<br>
[0118]    Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, encompasses two conditions,<br>
emphysema and chronic bronchitis, which relate to damage caused to the lung by air<br>
pollution, chronic exposure to chemicals, and tobacco smoke. Emphysema as a disease<br>
relates to damage to the alveoli of the lung, which results in loss of the separation between<br>
alveoli and a consequent reduction in the overall surface area available for gas exchange.<br>
Chronic bronchitis relates to irritation of the bronchioles, resulting in excess production of<br>
mucin, and the consequent blocking by mucin of the airways leading to the alveoli. While<br>
persons with emphysema do not necessarily have chronic bronchitis or vice versa, it is<br>
common for persons with one of the conditions to also have the other, as well as other lung<br>
disorders.<br>
[0119]    Some of the damage to the lungs due to COPD, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and<br>
other obstructive lung disorders can be inhibited or reversed by administering inhibitors of<br>
the enzyme known as soluble epoxide hydrolase, or "sEH". The effects of sEH inhibitors can<br>
be increased by also administering EETs. The effect is at least additive over administering<br>
the two agents separately, and may indeed be synergistic.<br>
[0120]    The studies reported herein show that EETs can be used in conjunction with sEH<br>
inhibitors to reduce damage to the lungs by tobacco smoke or, by extension, by occupational<br>
or environmental irritants. These findings indicate that the co-administration of sEH<br>
inhibitors and of EETs can be used to inhibit or slow the development or progression of<br>
COPD, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or other chronic obstructive lung diseases which<br>
cause irritation to the lungs.<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>
36<br>
[0121]    Animal models of COPD and humans with COPD have elevated levels of<br>
immunomodulatory lymphocytes and neutrophils. Neutrophils release agents that cause<br>
tissue damage and, if not regulated, will over time have a destructive effect. Without wishing<br>
to be bound by theory, it is believed that reducing levels of neutrophils reduces tissue damage<br>
contributing to obstructive lung diseases such as COPD, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis.<br>
Administration of sEH inhibitors to rats in an animal model of COPD resulted in a reduction<br>
in the number of neutrophils found in the lungs. Administration of EETs in addition to the<br>
sEH inhibitors also reduced neutrophil levels.  The reduction in neutrophil levels in the<br>
presence of sEH inhibitor and EETs was greater than in the presence of the sEH inhibitor<br>
alone.<br>
[0122]    While levels of endogenous EETs are expected to rise with the inhibition of sEH<br>
activity caused by the action of the sEH inhibitor, and therefore to result in at least some<br>
improvement in symptoms or pathology, it may not be sufficient in all cases to inhibit<br>
progression of COPD or other pulmonary diseases. This is particularly true where the<br>
diseases or other factors have reduced the endogenous concentrations of EETs below those<br>
normally present in healthy individuals. Administration of exogenous EETs in conjunction<br>
with an sEH inhibitor is therefore expected to augment the effects of the sEH inhibitor in<br>
inhibiting or reducing the progression of COPD or other pulmonary diseases.<br>
[0123]    In addition to inhibiting or reducing the progression of chronic obstructive airway<br>
conditions, the invention also provides new ways of reducing the severity or progression of<br>
chronic restrictive airway diseases. While obstructive airway diseases tend to result from the<br>
destruction of the lung parenchyma, and especially of the alveoE, restrictive diseases tend to<br>
arise from the deposition of excess collagen in the parenchyma.   These restrictive diseases<br>
are commonly referred to as "interstitial lung diseases", or "ILDs", and include conditions<br>
such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The methods, compositions and uses of the invention<br>
are useful for reducing the severity or progression of ILDs, such as idiopathic pulmonary<br>
fibrosis. Macrophages play a significant role in stimulating interstitial cells, particularly<br>
fibroblasts, to lay down collagen. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that<br>
neutrophils are involved in activating macrophages, and that the reduction of neutrophil<br>
levels found in the studies reported herein demonstrate that the methods and uses of the<br>
invention will also be applicable to reducing the severity and progression of ELDs.<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>

[0124]    In some embodiments, the ILD is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In other<br>
embodiments, the ILD is one associated with an occupational or environmental exposure.<br>
Exemplars of such ILDs, are asbestosis, silicosis, coal worker's pneumoconiosis, and<br>
berylliosis. Further, occupational exposure to any of a number of inorganic dusts and organic<br>
dusts is believed to be associated with mucus hypersecretion and respiratory disease,<br>
including cement dust, coke oven emissions, mica, rock dusts, cotton dust, and grain dust (for<br>
a more complete list of occupational dusts associated with these conditions, see Table 254-1<br>
of Speizer, "Environmental Lung Diseases," Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, infra,<br>
at pp. 1429-1436). In other embodiments, the ILD is sarcoidosis of the lungs.  ILDs can also<br>
result from radiation in medical treatment, particularly for breast cancer, and from connective<br>
tissue or collagen diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis.  It is believed<br>
that the methods, uses and compositions of the invention can be useful in each of these<br>
interstitial lung diseases.<br>
[0125]    In another set of embodiments, the invention is used to reduce the severity or<br>
progression of asthma. Asthma typically results in mucin hypersecretion, resulting in partial<br>
airway obstruction. Additionally, irritation of the airway results in the release of mediators<br>
which result in airway obstruction. While the lymphocytes and other immunomodulatory<br>
cells recruited to the lungs in asthma may differ from those recruited as a result of COPD or<br>
an ILD, it is expected that the invention will reduce the influx of immunomodulatory cells,<br>
such as neutrophils and eosinophils, and ameliorate the extent of obstruction. Thus, it is<br>
expected that the administration of sEH inhibitors, and the administration of sEH inhibitors in<br>
combination with EETs, will be useful in reducing airway obstruction due to asthma.<br>
[0126]    In each of these diseases and conditions, it is believed that at least some of the<br>
damage to the lungs is due to agents released by neutrophils which infiltrate into the lungs.<br>
The presence of neutrophils in the airways is thus indicative of continuing damage from the<br>
disease or condition, while a reduction in the number of neutrophils is indicative of reduced<br>
damage or disease progression. Thus, a reduction in the number of neutrophils in the airways<br>
in the presence of an agent is a marker that the agent is reducing damage due to the disease or<br>
condition, and is slowing the further development of the disease or condition. The number of<br>
neutrophils present in the lungs can be determined by, for example, bronchoalveolar lavage.<br>
Prophvlatic and therapeutic methods to reduce stroke damage<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>

[0127]    Inhibitors of soluble epoxide hydrolase ("sEH") and EETs administered in<br>
conjunction with inhibitors of sEH have been shown to reduce brain damage from strokes.<br>
Based on these results, we expect that inhibitors of sEH taken prior to an ischernic stroke will<br>
reduce the area of brain damage and will likely reduce the consequent degree of impairment.<br>
The reduced area of damage should also be associated with a faster recovery from the effects<br>
of the stroke.<br>
[0128]    While the pathophysiologies of different subtypes of stroke differ, they all cause<br>
brain damage. Hemorrhagic stroke differs from ischemic stroke in that the damage is largely<br>
due to compression of tissue as blood builds up in the confined space within the skull after a<br>
blood vessel ruptures, whereas in ischemic stroke, the damage is largely due to loss of<br>
oxygen supply to tissues downstream of the blockage of a blood vessel by a clot. Ischemic<br>
strokes are divided into thrombotic strokes, in which a clot blocks a blood vessel in the brain,<br>
and embolic strokes, in which a clot formed elsewhere in the body is carried through the<br>
blood stream and blocks a vessel there. But, in both hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke,<br>
the damage is due to the death of brain cells. Based on the results observed in our studies,<br>
however, we would expect at least some reduction in brain damage in all types of stroke and<br>
in all subtypes.<br>
[0129]    A number of factors associated with an increased risk of stroke. Given the results of<br>
the studies underlying the present invention, sEH inhibitors administered to persons with any<br>
one or more of the following conditions or risk factors-.high blood pressure, tobacco use,<br>
diabetes, carotid artery disease, peripheral artery disease, atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic<br>
attacks (TIAs), blood disorders such as high red blood cell counts and sickle cell disease,<br>
high blood cholesterol, obesity, alcohol use of more than one drink a day for women or two<br>
drinks a day for men, use of cocaine, a family history of stroke, a previous stroke or heart<br>
attack, or being elderly, will reduce the area of brain damaged of a stroke. With respect to<br>
being elderly, the risk of stroke increases for every 10 years. Thus, as an individual reaches<br>
60, 70, or 80, administration of sEH inhibitors has an increasingly larger potential benefit.<br>
As noted in the next section, the administration of EETs in combination with one or more<br>
sEH inhibitors can be beneficial in further reducing the brain damage.<br>
[0130]    In some uses and methods, the sEH inhibitors and, optionally, EETs, are<br>
administered to persons who use tobacco, have carotid artery disease, have peripheral artery<br>
disease, have atrial fibrillation, have had one or more transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), have<br>
a blood disorder such as a high red blood cell count or sickle cell disease, have high blood<br>
cholesterol, are obese, use alcohol in excess of one drink a day if a woman or two drinks a<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>

day if a man, use cocaine, have a family history of stroke, have had a previous stroke or heart<br>
attack and do not have high blood pressure or diabetes, or are 60, 70, or 80 years of age or<br>
more and do not have hypertension or diabetes.<br>
[0131]    Clot dissolving agents, such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), have been shown<br>
to reduce the extent of damage from ischemic strokes if administered in the hours shortly<br>
after a stroke. tPA, for example, is approved by the FDA for use in the first three hours after<br>
a stroke. Thus, at least some of the brain damage from a stoke is not instantaneous, but<br>
occurs over a period of time or after a period of time has elapsed after the stroke. It is<br>
therefore believed that administration of sEH inhibitors, optionally with EETs, can also<br>
reduce brain damage if administered within 6 hours after a stroke has occurred, more<br>
preferably within 5, 4, 3, or 2 hours after a stroke has occurred, with each successive shorter<br>
interval being more preferable. Even more preferably, the inhibitor or inhibitors are<br>
administered 2 hours or less or even 1 hour or less after the stroke, to maximize the reduction<br>
in brain damage. Persons of skill are well aware of how to make a diagnosis of whether or<br>
not a patient has had a stroke. Such determinations are typically made in hospital emergency<br>
rooms, following standard differential diagnosis protocols and imaging procedures.<br>
[0132]    In some uses and methods, the sEH inhibitors and, optionally, EETs, are<br>
administered to persons who have had a stroke within the last 6 hours who: use tobacco, have<br>
carotid artery disease, have peripheral artery disease, have atrial fibrillation, have had one or<br>
more transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), have a blood disorder such as a high red blood cell<br>
count or sickle cell disease, have high blood cholesterol, are obese, use alcohol in excess of<br>
one drink a day if a woman or two drinks a day if a man, use cocaine, have a family history<br>
of stroke, have had a previous stroke or heart attack and do not have high blood pressure or<br>
diabetes, or are 60, 70, or 80 years of age or more and do not have hypertension or diabetes.<br>
[0133]    The conditions of therapeautic administration for all of these indications are as<br>
described above.<br>
Combination Therapy<br>
[0134]    As noted above, the compounds of the present invention will, in some instances, be<br>
used in combination with other therapeutic agents to bring about a desired effect. Selection<br>
of additional agents will, in large part, depend on the desired target therapy (see, e.g., Turner,<br>

and DeFronzo, R. et al. (ed's.), Diabetes Reviews (1997) Vol. 5 No. 4). A number of studies<br>

Combination therapy includes administration of a single pharmaceutical dosage formulation<br>
which contains a compound having the general structure of formula 1 and one or more<br>
additional active agents, as well as administration of a compound of formula 1 and each<br>
active agent in its own separate pharmaceutical dosage formulation. For example, a<br>
compound of formula 1 and one or more angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin<br>
converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, alpha blockers, beta<br>
blockers, centrally acting agents, vasopeptidase inhibitors, renin inhibitors, endothelin<br>
receptor agonists, AGE crosslink breakers, sodium/potassium ATPase inhibitors, endothelin<br>
receptor agonists, endothelin receptor antagonists, angiotensin vaccine, and the like; can be<br>
administered to the human subject together in a single oral dosage composition, such as a<br>
tablet or capsule, or each agent can be administered in separate oral dosage formulations.<br>
Where separate dosage formulations are used, a compound of formula 1 and one or more<br>
additional active agents can be administered at essentially the same time (i.e., concurrently),<br>
or at separately staggered times (i.e., sequentially). Combination therapy is understood to<br>
include all these regimens.<br>

Methods of Preparation<br>
[0137]    The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by a variety of methods as<br>
outlined generally in the schemes below.<br>
Scheme 1 - Introduction of a secondary pharmacophore (ketone)<br>
[0138]    Scheme 1 illustrates general methods that can be used for preparation of compounds<br>
of the invention having a secondary pharmacophore that is a ketone functional group. While<br>
the scheme is provided for the synthesis of l-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-(4-oxodecyl)urea, one of<br>
skill in the art will understand that a number of commercially available isocyanates could be<br>
used in place of 3-chlorophenyl isocyanate, and that shorter or longer analogs of ethyl 4-<br>
aminobutyric acid or hexylbromide could also be employed.<br>
Scheme 1: Synthesis of l-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-(4-oxodecyl)urea (794).<br><br>
Scheme 1: Synthesis of l-(3-chlorophenyI)-3-(4-oxodecyl)urea (794): (a) Benzophenone inline, CH2Cl2. rt; (b)<br>
DIBAL, THF, -78°C; (c) Mg/I2, hexylbromide, THF, rt; (d) acetic anhydride, DMSO, rt; (e) 1N HCl/dioxane, rt;<br>
(f) 3-chlorophenyl isocyanate, TEA, DMF, rt.<br>
[0139]    As shown in Scheme 1, ethyl 4-aminobutyrate hydrochloride (available from<br>
Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA) is combined with benzophenone irnine<br>
at room temperature to provide intermediate (i). DIBAL reduction of the ester group<br>
provides an unisolated aldehyde moiety that is then reacted with a suitable Grignard reagent<br>
(prepared in situ) to provide intermediate alcohol (ii). Oxidation of the alcohol moiety to a<br>
ketone provides (iii) which can then be deprotected to form the amino-ketone (iv). Reaction<br>
of (iv) with a suitable isocyanate provides the target compound (794). Substitution of<br><br>

42<br>
3-chlorophenyl isocyanate with, for example, adamantyl isocyanate or cyclohexyl isocyanate<br>
(also available from Aldrich Chemical Co.) provides other compounds of the invention.<br><br>
Scheme 2: Syntheses of l-(aryl or alkyl)-3-(3-alkylated proply)ureas: (a) aryl or alkyl isocyanate, DMF, rt; (b)<br>
bromopentane, K2CO3, Nal, acetonitrile, reflux; (c) di-t-butyl dicarbonate, dioxane, 50°C; (d) pentylamine,<br>
isobutyl chloroformate, NMM, DMF, rt; (e) 4M hydrochloric acid, dioxane; (f) 3-chlorophenyi isocyanate,<br>
TEA, DMF, rt.<br>
[0140]    As shown in Scheme 2, a variety of compounds having a secondary pharmacophore<br>
that is either an ester or amide functional group can be prepared. Beginning with 4-<br>
aminobutyric acid, treatment with a suitable cycloalkyl or aryl isocyanate provides the urea<br>
intermediates shown as (v), wherein R is 3-chlorophenyl, cyclohexyl or 1-adamantyl. Of<br>
course other suitable isocyanates can also be employed to provide desired urea intermediates.<br>
Esterification via alkylation of the carboxylic acid present in (v) with, for example, pentyl<br>
bromide provides the target compounds 767, 772 and 789. A variety of suitable alkyl halides<br>
can be used to prepare other compounds of the invention. The second path illustrated in<br>
Scheme 2 can be used to prepare compounds such as 768, as well as those compounds having<br>
a primary pharmacophore that is a carbamate. Accordingly, treatment of 4-aminobutyric acid<br>
with di-t-butyl dicarbonate provides the t-butyl carbamate acid (vi) that is converted to a<br>
desired amide (vii) using pentylamine, for example, in a mild procedure employing isobutyl<br>
chloroformate, and N-methyl morpholine (NMM). Removal of the carbamate protecting<br>
group (as it is used in this instance) followed by formation of a urea with a suitable<br>
isocyanate (shown here as 3-chlorophenyl isocyanate) provides the target compounds (e.g.,<br>
768).<br><br>

Scheme 3: Syntheses of l-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-(2-alkylated ethyl)ureas: (a) 3-chlorophenyl isocyanate, DMF, rt;<br>
(b) heptanoic anhydride (761), chlorofonnic acid pentyl ester (760), or pentyl isocyanate (762), TEA, DMF, rt;<br>
(c) di-t-butyl dicarbonate, dioxane, rt; (d) heptanoic anhydride (765), chloroformic acid pentyl ester (777), or<br>
pentyl isocyanate (766), DMF, rt; (e) 4M HC1, dioxane; (f) 3-chlorophenyl isocyanate, TEA, DMF, rt.<br>
[0141]    Scheme 3 illustrates a variety of methods for introducing secondary<br>
phannacophores that are esters, amide, ureas, carbonates and carbamates, from readily<br>
accessible starting materials. In A, ethanolamine is treated with a suitable isocyanate to<br>
introduce a primary pharmacophore that is a urea and form intermediate (viii). Treatment of<br>
(viii) with an anhydride, a chloro formic acid ester or an isocyanate provides compounds such<br>
as 761,760 and 762, respectively. Similar methodology in employed in B, with the addition<br>
of protection/deprotection steps. Accordingly, ethylenediamine is monoprotected as a r-butyl<br>
carbamate. The free amine is then converted to a secondary pharmacophore that is an amide,<br>
carbamate or urea using reactants and conditions similar to those employed in "A" to provide<br>
intermediates (x). Deprotection of (x) and reaction with a suitable isocyanate provides the<br>
target compounds 765, 777 and 766. Again, use of isocyanates other than 3-chlorophenyl<br>
isocyanate leads to other compounds of the invention, while substitution of certain reactants<br>
used, for example, in the conversion of (ix) to (x) can provide still other compounds of the<br>
invention.<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>
44<br><br>
Scheme 4: Syntheses of l-(l-adamantyl)-3-(ll-alkylated undecyl)ureas: (a) adamantyl isocyanate, chloroform,<br>
reflux; (b) alkyl or aryl halide, K2CO3, Nal, acetonitrile, reflux; (c) alcohol or amine, isobutyl chloroformate,<br>
TEA, DMF, rt; (d) t-butanol, EDCI, DMAP, metirylene chloride, rt.<br>
[0142]    Scheme 4 illustrates pathways for the introduction of a tertiary pharmacophore that<br>
is an ester or an amide functional group. In each case, a carboxylic acid group is converted to<br>
the desired ester or amide. As shown in Scheme 4,12-aminododecanoic acid (Aldrich<br>
Chemical Co.) is converted to urea (687) upon treatment with adamantyl isocyanate. One of<br>
skill in the art will appreciate that a variety of alkyl, aryl and cycloalkyl isocyanates can be<br>
similarly employed to form other ureas as the primary pharmacophore. Similarly,<br>
11-aminoundecanoic acid or another long chain amino fatty acid could be used in place of<br>
12-aminododecanoic acid. The carboxylic acid moiety can then be esterified or converted to<br>
an amide moiety following standard procedures to provide, for example, 780-785, 788 and<br>
800-804 (as esters) and 786, 787, 792 and 793 (as esters and amides).<br>
[0143]    Scheme 5 illustrates pathways for the synthesis of cis- or trans-phenoxy or<br>
benzyloxy-cyclohexyl compounds. In each case, trans-4-aminocyclohexanol hydrochloride is<br>
converted to the desired isomer of the phenoxy or benzyloxy derivative. The alcohol moiety<br>
can be alkylated with an appropriately substituted benzyl halide following standard<br>
procedures to provide, the corresponding benzyl ether. Likewise, the alcohol moiety can be<br>
alkylated with an appropriately substituted phenol in the presence of triphenylphosphine<br>
following standard procedures to provide, the corresponding phenyl ether. As shown in<br>
Scheme 5, each isomer can be converted to the corresponding urea upon treatment with an<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>
45<br>
appropriately substituted isocyanate, e.g. adamantyl isocyanate. One of skill in the art will<br>
appreciate that a variety of alkyl, aryl and cycloalkyl isocyanates can be similarly employed<br>
to form other ureas as the primary pharmacophore.<br><br>
Scheme 5: Syntheses of cis and trans-phenoxy-and benzyloxy-cyclohexyl compounds.<br>
Combinatorial library synthesis<br>
[0144]    A 192-member urea library has been constructed by a known two-step solid-phase<br>
synthesis (Tetrahedron Letters 2003,44, 6099-6102), which employs a PS-Indole-CHO resin.<br>
As shown in Scheme 6, four amines and 48 isocyanates have been used as building blocks to<br>
find the optimal left side of urea for sEH inhibitors. Resin-bound secondary amines can be<br>
obtained by a reductive amination with amines using sodium cyanoborohydride in the<br>
presence of triethylorthoformate. The reaction with isocyanates gives the desired resin-bound<br>
ureas, which can be cleaved from the resin by very mild acidic condition by using 1% TFA in<br>
dichloromethane at room temperature. The 192 urea compounds were prepared in 20-50%<br>
overall yields from the indole aldehyde resin. The identification and purity of the library<br>
could be determined by LC-MS. Purities were above 80%. Compounds with purites below<br>
this level were removed from the library.<br><br>

Example 1<br>
Synthesis of 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-(4-oxodecyl)urea (794)<br>
[0149]    1.00g (5.52 mmol) of  benzophenone imine, 0.94 g (5.52 mmol) of ethyl 4-<br>
aminobutyrate hydrochloride, and 20 mL of methylene chloride were stirred at room<br>
temperature for 24 hr. The reaction mixture was filtered to remove NH4CI and evaporated to<br>
dryness. The benzophenone Schiff base of ethyl 4-aminobutyrate (i) was extracted with ether<br>
(20 mL), and the ether solution was washed with water (20 mL), dried over sodium sulfate<br>
(Na2SO4), and concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica<br>
gel eluting with hexane and ethyl acetate (5:1) to give i (1.00 g, 61%) as an oil. To the<br>
solution of the benzophenone Schiff base (i) in 20 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) was added<br>
3.7 mL of 1M diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL) solution in pentane (3.73 mmol) at<br>
-78°C under nitrogen, and the reaction was stirred for 2 hr at the temperature. To 0.10 g of<br>
magnesium turning (4.07 mmol) and I2 (catalytic amount) in THF (10 mL) was added 0.48<br>
mL of hexylbromide (3.39 mmol) at room temperature under nitrogen. After stirring for 1 hr,<br>
this reaction solution was added dropwise to the above reaction mixture at -78°C, and the<br>
solution was allowed to warm to room temperature with stirring. After stirring for 5 hr at<br>
room temperature, 10 mL of NaHCO3 aqueous solution was added to the reaction, then the<br>
alkylated alcohol (ii) was extracted with ether (20 mL), and the ether solution was washed<br>
with water (20 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated to give 0.26 g (60 %) of the alcohol<br>
product (ii).<br>
[0150]    Acetic anhydride (2mL) was added to a solution of ii (0.77 mmol) in 5 mL of<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 12<br>
hr. and concentrated. The residue was extracted with ether (20 mL), and the ether was washed<br>
with water (20 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated to provide 0.26 g (100 %) of the<br>

IC50 Assay conditions<br>
[0239]    IC50 values were determined in one of two method. One method uses racemic 4-<br>
mtophenyl-trans-2,3-epoxy-3-phenylpropyl carbonate as substrate. Enzymes (0.12 fiM<br>
mouse sEH or 0.24 μM human sEH) were incubated with inhibitors for 5 min in sodium<br>
phosphate buffer, 0.1 M pH 7.4, at 30°C before substrate introduction([S] = 40 μM). Activity<br>
was assessed by measuring the appearance of the 4-nitrophenolate anion at 405 nm at 30°C<br>
during 1 min (Spectramax 200; Molecular Devices). Assays were performed in triplicate.<br>
IC50 is a concentration of inhibitor, which reduces enzyme activity by 50%, and was<br>
determined by regression of at least five datum points with a minimum of two points in the<br>
linear region of the curve on either side of the IC50. The curve was generated from at least<br>
three separate runs, each in triplicate, to obtain the standard deviation (SD) given in Table 1<br>
thru Table 4.<br>
[0240]    Other IC50 values were determined using the procedure described in Analytical<br>
Biochemistry 343 66-75 (2005) using cyano(6-methoxy-naphthalen-2-yl)methyl trans-[(3-<br>
phenyloxiran-2-yl)methyl] carbonate as a substrate (see Table 18b). Enzymes (0.88 nM for<br>
murine and 0.96 nM for human sEH) were incubated with inhibitors ([T] = 0.5-10,000 nM)<br>
for 5 min in BisTris-HCl buffer (25 mM, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 mg/ml of BSA) at 30 °C<br>
prior to substrate introduction ([S] = 51M). Enzyme activity was measured by monitoring the<br>
appearance of 6-methoxy-2-naphthaldehyde. Assays were performed in triplicate. By<br>
definition, IC50 values are concentrations of inhibitor that reduce enzyme activity by 50%.<br>
IC50 values were determined by regression of at least five datum points, with a minimum of<br>
two datum points in the linear region of the curve on either side of the IC50 values. The curve<br>

than the esters of acetic and propanoic acids (549 and 635) for both enzymes, indicating that<br>
a polar functional group located three carbon units (carbonyl on the fourth carbon, about 7.5<br>

distance from the carbonyl of the primary urea pharmacophore to the secondary ester<br>

Enzymes (0.12 μM mouse sbn and 0.24 uM human sEH) were incubated with inhibitors for 5 mm in sodium<br>
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 30°C before substrate introduction ([S] = 40μM). Results are means ± SD of three<br>
separate experiments.<br>
[0245]    As shown in the above table, the substitution at R with a cyclohexyl (772) or<br>
adamantyl (789) increased inhibitor potency 10-fold over the 3-chlorophenyl analog (767, see<br>
Table 3 below). Furthermore, these compounds functionalized with a polar group were as<br>
active and potent as non-functionalized lipophilic inhibitors (for example, 791, 790,297, and<br>
686) for both murine and human enzymes. Adding polar groups to compounds generally<br>
increases their water solubility, and this was the case when one compares compounds 772 or<br>
789 to 791 and 790. In addition, stripping water of hydration out of the enzyme catalytic site<br>
requires about the same amount of energy that is gained by forming a new hydrogen bond<br>
between the inhibitor and the enzyme. Thus addition of polar groups which hydrogen bond<br>
to a target enzyme does not dramatically increase potency if the inhibitor is already potent.<br>
However, the presence of an additional polar group can be expected to dramatically increase<br>
specificity by decreasing hydrophobic binding to biological molecules other than the primary<br>
target (sEH). In this way combining several active pharmacophores into a single molecule<br>
often has a massive increase in specificity and biological activity in complex biological<br>
systems.<br>

[0247]    Based on the initial activity shown in Table 1, urea compounds were prepared<br>
having a polar carbonyl group located approximately 7.5 angstroms from the carbonyl of the<br>

and 686). The table below shows various functionalities such as ketone, ester, amide,<br>
carbonate, carbamate, and urea which contribute a carbonyl group, and are termed as the<br>
secondary pharmacophores. To determine the effect for each of the secondary<br>
pharmacophores, a 3-chlorophenyl group was held constant as one of substituents of the urea<br>
pharmacophore. The 3-chlorophenyl group is also particularly useful for monitoring<br>
chemical reactions quickly via chromatography. After optimizing the secondary<br>
pharmacophore, the aryl substituent can be replaced by a cyclohexyl, adamantyl or other<br>
group leading to more potent inhibitors.<br>

[0249]    When the left of the carbonyl (X) is a methylene carbon, the best inhibition was<br>
obtained if a methylene carbon (ketone, 794) or oxygen (ester, 767) is present in the right<br>
position (Y). The ester bond can be stabilized by stearic hindrance of the alcohol or acid<br>
moiety or both (805). The presence of nitrogen (amide, 768) reduced the activity. In<br>
compounds with an oxygen in the left of the carbonyl group, a &gt; 10-fold drop in activity was<br>
observed and there was not any change in tide activity even if the right position, Y, was<br>
modified with a methylene carbon (ester, 761), oxygen (carbonate, 760), or nitrogen<br>
(carbamate, 762), respectively. All compounds (765,777, and 766) with nitrogen in the left<br>
position had lower activities than 794 or 767. Comparing compounds 767 and 761, the<br>
presence of a methylene carbon around the carbonyl showed a very different effect on the<br>
inhibition activity. The compound with a methylene carbon in the left of the carbonyl (767)<br>
showed a 20-fold better inhibition than that in the right (761). While the rank-order potency<br>
of this inhibitor series was equivalent with mouse and human sEH, a 3-5-fold higher<br>
inhibition potency was observed for the murine enzyme.<br>

separate experiments.<br>
[0253]    While the presence of a polar group at the end of a shorter chain reduced inhibition<br>
potency for both enzymes (see Table 1), when the carboxylic acid was modified to esters with<br>
various aliphatic groups (780,784,783,781,788,800,785,801,802, and 803) inhibition<br>
potencies were as high as that of the acid (687) for both enzymes. Ethyl (792) and isopropyl<br>
(793) amide derivatives were also potent inhibitors. Compounds with methyl-branched<br>
aliphatic chains were also potent (785, 801,802, 803, and 793). Still further, larger bulky<br>
group such as 1-adamantylmethyl (786), benzyl (804), 2-chlorobenzyl (782) or 2-<br>
naphthylmethyl (787) provided good levels of activity, although slightly reduced (1.5-3-fold)<br>
for both enzymes. These results identified an additional site within the sEH inhibitor<br>
structure which allows the inclusion of a third polar function, i.e. a tertiary pharmacophore.<br>
Example 38<br>
[0254]    In order to further explore the effects of functional groups which improve water<br>
solubility on the bioavailability and potency of the inhibitors, seven amide derivatives of<br>
compound 687 with various functionalities were synthesized. As shown in Table 5, alkyl,<br>
sulfonyl, lipoamino acid, and glucosylamide derivatives were prepared, and their inhibition<br>
potency on sEHs, melting point, and solubility in water and oil were examined. For mouse<br>
sEH, there was no change in the inhibition activity when the acid function of compound 687<br>
was substituted by an alkyl (792 and 793), sulfonyl (848 and 914), lipoamino acid (1001), or<br>
glucosyl (1002 and 798) groups. Interestingly, for human sEH, significant differences in<br>
inhibition potencies, which were measured by the spectrometric and fluorescent based assays,<br>
were observed when replacing the acid of compound 687 by the substituents. While<br>
introduction of the ethyl amide group (792) resulted in a 1.5-fold decrease in potency, the<br>
isopropyl analogue (793) exhibited very similar potency to ADUA (687). The corresponding<br>
ester derivatives 784 and 785 in Table 5 exhibited a 2-3-fold improvement in inhibition of the<br>
human enzyme. Two sulfonylamides with a methyl (848) or phenyl (914) group improved the<br>
inhibition potency of compound 4 about 1.5-fold. On the other hand, a 25-fold and 3-fold<br>
decrease in potency was observed when the sulfonylamide was replaced by a lipoamino acid<br>
(1001) or glucosyl groups (1002 and 798), respectively. This suggests that such bulky, and in<br>
the case of glucose, highly polar functional groups are not effective in retaining the inhibition<br><br>

potency on human sEH. Comparing compounds 1002 and 798, similar inhibition on the<br>
human enzyme was shown in these two compounds although an octyl group is present<br>
between the ADUA and sugar moieties of compound 1002, suggesting that relatively<br>
lipophilic alkyl groups located around the amide function do not alter the binding activity of<br>
inhibitors to the enzyme. Melting points of most of the amides in Table 5 were measured in a<br>
range of 100-140°C, which was similar to 114°C of the acid compound 687, while the ester<br>
derivates of compound 687 in Table 5 showed 23-66°C lower melting points than that of<br>
compound 687. An exception was compound 1001 for which we were unable to obtain a<br>
crystalline solid at room temperature. These results imply that the amide function is not as<br>
useful in reducing the melting point of AUDA derives as the esters. As with the esters<br>
prepared for this study, the amides failed to result in a large increase in potency on the target<br>
enzyme. Thus any advantage of these amides would result from improvements in ease of<br>
formulation, oral availability and pharmacokinetics. When water solubility of three<br>
compounds (848,1001, and 1002) was compared to that of compound 4, a 3-fold lower or<br>
similar solubility was shown in compounds with a rnethanesulfonyl (848) or glucosyl (1002)<br>
group, respectively. Compound 1001, the lipoamino acid conjugate, surprisingly had a 2.5-<br>
fold better water solubility than compound 687. The 25-fold decrease in the inhibitory<br>
potency of compound 1001 compared to 687 indicates that with compound 1001 the<br>
biological activity will be attributed largely to the production of AUDA rather than being due<br>
to both AUDA and its ester or amide. In addition, no valuable improvement in oil solubility<br>
was obtained in the amides. Although significant improvements in the properties of the<br>
compounds were not observed in the seven amide derivatives, their relative stability and<br>
inhibition potency is sufficient to encourage the further exploration of other amide<br>
compounds to develop bioavailable inhibitors with improved physical properties. We have<br>
reported that modification of the urea pharmacophore of potent sEH inhibitors to an amide<br>
functionality does not dramatically alter the inhibition potency and that at least a 10-fold<br>
improvement hi water solubility and a decrease in the melting points of these amide inhibitors<br>
is observed.( Kim, et al. J. Med. Chem. 2005, 48, 3621-3629). This suggests that the<br>
inhibition potency and physical properties of the amide derivatives in Table 5 might be<br>
improved with the modification of the urea function to the corresponding amide<br>
pharmacophore.<br><br>

[0257]    As can be seen from the above table, in increasing the distance between the<br>
secondary ester phannacphore and the tertiary ester pharmacaphore (549, 635, and 774)<br>
increased inhibition potency for human sEHs but mouse EH activity remained relatively<br>
consistent.<br>

[0259]    Adamantyl-urea compounds were prepared having a polar ether group located<br>
various distances from the carbonyl of the primary urea pharmacophore. These compounds<br>
were prepared to improve water solubility of lipophilic sEH inhibitors (192 and 686). As can<br>
be seen from the results in Table 7, the activity is relatively consistent.<br>

[0261]    As shown in the above table, these compounds fiinctionalized with a single ether<br>
group could be as active and potent as non-functionalized lipophilic inhibitors (790, see Table<br>
2 above) for both murine and human enzymes. Adding a polar ether group to these<br>
compounds increased their water solubility (compare compound 866-870 with 790). The<br>
distance from the carbonyl of the primary urea pharmacophore to the secondary ether<br>
.   pharmacophore in compound 869 is about 8.9 A showing that the secondary pharmacophore<br>
may be located about 7 A to about 9 A from the carbonyl of the primary urea pharmacophore<br>

pharmacophore.<br>
[0263]    Because compounds having a ether secondary pharmacophore were found to be<br>
suitable inhibitors of both the mouse and human enzymes, a variety of polyether derivatives<br>
were synthesized and evaluated along with contributions of a tertiary pharmacophore. As can<br>

[0265]    Compounds with from two to four ether groups (908, 950, and 952) had inhibition<br>
potencies that were as high as non-functionalized lipophilic inhibitors (790, see Table 2<br>
above) for both murine and human enzymes, as well as increased water solubility and<br>
improved pharmacokinetics (See Figures 14-24). Including a tertiary pharmacophore were<br>
also potent inhibitors but did not further increase their activity (compare compounds 913 and<br>
940 with 908 and compound 951 with 950).<br>

linker.<br>
[0271]    Because compounds having an alkylene linker between the primary and secondary<br>

a variety of admantyl-urea derivatives having a phenyl or cyclohexyl spacer between a<br>
primary urea and secondary pharmacophore were synthesized and evaluated to examine the<br>
contributions of the linker.<br>

[0273]    Compounds with alkylene and arylene linker groups (859 and 861) had inhibition<br>
potencies that were higher than compounds with alkylene linkers (789, see Table 2 above,<br>
and 868, see Table 7 above) for both murine and human enzymes, independent of the<br>
topography {compare compound 859 with 860 and compound 861 with 863) or type of the<br>
secondary phannacophore {compare compounds 860 and 863 with 909).<br>
Example 44<br>
[0274]    This example illustrates the inhibition of mouse soluble epoxide hydrolases by<br>
compounds of the invention (formula (T)) having a secondary phannacophore, and further<br>
including a mono amino acid moiety. This example further illustrates the use of a<br>
combinatorial approach toward compound preparation and evaluation.<br>
[0275]    The utility of a combinatorial approach is illustrated by using the butanoic acid<br>
derivatives from Table 11 and Table 12 to form amide bonds with one or more natural or<br>
synthetic amino acids. This approach rapidly leads to a large number of compounds that are<br>
highly active and can be recognized by the intestinal peptide uptake system. As shown<br>
above, polar groups could be incorporated into one of the alkyl groups of the dialkyl-urea<br>
sEH inhibitors without loss of activity, when placed at an appropriate distance from the urea<br>
function. These modifications give the new inhibitors better solubility and availability. To<br>
expand this assessment of inhibitor structure refinement a semi-combinatorial approach was<br>
used with amino acids. Because amino acids are simple bifunctional synthons with a wide<br>
variety of side chains, mono and di-peptidic derivatives of 4-(3-cyclohexyl-ureido)-butyric<br>
acid 625 were synthesized. This parent compound (acid 625) was selected due to its low<br>
inhibition of sEH. Furthermore, to make the peptidic bond, reactants were used, such as 1-<br>
ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)-propyl) carbodiimide, that themselves or their reaction product,<br>
such as l-efhyl-3-(3-dimethylamino)-propyl urea, are not inhibitors of sEH. Therefore, any<br>
inhibition observed was derived from the targeted peptidic derivatives. This approach allows<br>
the preparation of compounds on an analytical scale (10 μmol) without purification of the<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>
93<br>
products. The presence of the desired products was confirmed by LC-MS and the ratio of the<br>
LC-MS peak of the desire compounds with the starting material was used to estimate the<br>
reaction yield. Because each inhibitor presents a single carboxyl group for negative mode<br>
ionization, the estimation of yield is reasonably quantitative.<br>
[0276]    Syntheses of amino acid derivatives of 4-(3-cyclohexyl-ureido)-butyric acid (632)<br>
were performed at analytical scale. Reactions were performed in 2mL glass vials for each<br>
amino acid. To 100 μL of a solution of 632 in DMF at 100 mM (10 μmol), 200 μL of a<br>
solution of l-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)-propyl) carbodiimide in DMF at 100 mM (20<br>
μmol) was added. After 15 minutes reaction at room temperature, 400 μL of amino acid<br>
methyl ester solution at 100 mM (40 umol) in 90:10 DMF:1 N NaOH was added. The<br>
reaction was strongly mixed at 40°C overnight. Three hundred microliters of 1 N NaOH was<br>
then added and allowed to react overnight at 40°C. Product formation was confirmed for<br>
each amino acid using electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Reaction<br>
solutions were used directly for inhibitor potency measurement with a theoretical<br>
concentration of 10 mM.<br>
[0277]    Assays were conducted with the compounds indicated in Table 11, according to<br>
established protocols (see, above).<br>

[0278]    Significant improvement of the inhibition potency was observed for the aromatic<br>
derivatives (phenylalanine, tryptophane and tyrosine), histidine and lysine. Again, without<br>
intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the specificity of the interaction of the<br>
enzyme with the five peptidic inhibitors listed results from specific pi-pi stacking between<br>
tryptophane 334 (Trp334) located in close proximity to the secondary pharmacophore, and the<br>
aromatic moieties with four of the five amino acids above. This interaction should alter the<br>
fluorescence spectrum of the enzyme. For the lysine derivative, because reaction can occur<br>
with the side chain amino group, the resulting product could resemble the alkyl derivatives<br>
synthesized above with the acid function playing the role of the third pharmacophore.<br>

[0283]    Significant improvement of inhibition potency was observed for almost all the<br>
derivatives tested except for alanine, isoleucine, leucine and threonine. These results indicate<br>
that the enzyme has a narrower specificity close to the catalytic center than toward the end of<br>
the active site tunnel. The inhibition potency found for the best dipeptidic derivatives are<br>
similar to those found for the corresponding alkyl inhibitors (see, C. Morisseau, et al.,<br>
Biochem. Pharm. 63:1599-1608 (2002)), indicating that such peptide-mimics are excellent<br>
inhibitors of sEH. Because of the presence of the amino acid derivatives in their structure,<br>
these compounds have excellent water solubility. Furthermore, because of the presence of<br>
active small peptide transport system in the gut, the dipeptidic urea derivatives will be<br>
absorbed in the gut by such systems as observed for several peptide derivative drugs (see, E.<br>
Walter, et al., Pharm. Res. 12: 360-365 (1995) and K. Watanabe, et al., Biol. Pharm. Bull 25:<br>
1345-1350 (2002)), giving these compounds excellent bioavailability.<br>
Example 46<br>
[0284]    This example provides studies directed to the metabolic stability of certain<br>
inhibitors of sEH.<br>
[0285]    To evaluate the metabolic stability of these inhibitors, the microsomal and NADPH<br>
dependent metabolism of a number of potent sEH inhibitors was evaluated. The rates of<br>
metabolism among the compounds varied dramatically, however the appearance of an<br>
omega-terminal acid was observed for all inhibitors containing n-alkane substitutions. When<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT/US2005/038282<br>

tested, the potent alkyl derivatives (e.g. 686) are rapidly metabolized in microsomal<br>
preparations by P450 dependents processes (see Figure 6), while the omega acid analogs (e.g.<br>
687) were stable (see Figure 7). The first step in the metabolic transformation of the n-alkyl<br>
to n-alkanoic acid derivatives is an NAPDH dependent process carried out by cytochrome<br>
P450 dependent omega hydroxylation in rodent and human hepatic tissue preparations (see<br>
Figure 8). The metabolites identified along this metabolic route are provided in Table 13.<br>
When in vivo metabolism was evaluated, evidence for the beta-oxidation of the alkanoic acid<br>
derivatives was also found (see Figure 9). Together, these data indicate that P450 omega<br>
hydroxylation can result in the rapid in vivo metabolic inactivation and excretion of these<br>
inhibitors.<br>

Example 47<br>
[0286]    This example provides the structures of compounds of the invention designed to<br>
slow esterase dependent inactivation, block beta-oxidation, block cytochrome P450<br>
dependent omega hydroxylation, or inhibit cytochrome P450 omega hydrolase.<br>
[0287]    Beta-oxidation can be blocked in a variety of ways, for example with an alpha<br>
halogen or alpha branched alkyl group (806), cyclopropane (807) or aromatic groups (808),<br>
or by replacing the acid or ester functional groups with alternate functionalities, such as<br>
sulfonamides (809 and 810), which mimic ester and acid functional groups yet provide<br>
metabolic stability in vivo. Similarly in pharmacology heterocyclic groups are used for<br>
hydrogen bond donors and acceptors to mimic carboxylic acids and esters (811). In addition,<br>
P450 omega hydroxylation can be blocked by including acetylene (812), trifluoromethyl<br>
(813), or aryl (814) groups at the terminus of the alkyl chain. This series of inhibitors also<br><br>

illustrates that with both the secondary and tertiary phannacophore, replacement can be made<br>
for the carbonyl with other functionalities as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors.<br>

Example 48<br>
[0288]    This example illustrates a comparison of cyclohexyl and adamantyl groups in<br>
stability and solubility.<br>
[0289]    Another consistent observation during the metabolism studies was that the<br>
adamantyl substituent (both 192 and 686 substituted) provided compounds having improved<br>
stability (see Figure 6). Surprisingly the adamantyl compounds were approximately 2x more<br>
soluble than the corresponding cyclohexyl derivatives (772 vs. 789, 791 vs. 790, and 297 vs.<br>
686 see Table 2 for structures). Surprisingly, the LC-MS/MS analyses producing collision<br>

high abundance ions, which dramatically enhanced the analytical sensitivity for these<br>
inhibitors (see Table 15 below). This enhanced sensitivity is a distinct advantage for drug<br>
metabolism studies using either in vivo or in vitro systems. Moreover, adamantane represents<br>
the smallest diamond nucleus and the adamantyl substituents not only yield compounds of<br>
improved metabolic stability and pharmacokinetic parameters, but also compounds that are<br>
very easy to detect.<br>

evaluated following oral gavage in mice. As noted above, the use of 1-adamantyl urea<br>
inhibitors afforded exquisite sensitivity, allowing the determination of the determined<br>

[0292]    Animals. Male Swiss Webster mice, 6 weeks-old, were obtained from Charles<br>
River (CA, USA). After 1-2 week acclimation period, healthy animals were assigned to<br>
study groups based on body-weight stratified randomization procedure. The body weight of<br>
animals used in all the experiments ranged from 28 g to 38 g. Mice were maintained on a 12<br>
h light /12 h dark cycle under controlled temperature and humidity conditions, and food and<br>
water available ad libid ran.<br>
[0293]    Administration and measurement. Pharmacokinetic studies in mice used a 5<br>
mg/kg dose of sEH inhibitors dissolved in corn oil and 4% DMSO administered orally.<br>
Serial tail bled blood samples (5-10 aL) were collected in heparinized 1.5 mL tubes at<br>
various time points (0.5,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 24 hr) after the administration for measuring<br>
parent compounds and their metabolites by using LC-MS/MS: a Waters 2790 liquid<br>
chromatograph equipped with a 30 X 2.1 mm 3 um C18 Xterra™ column (Waters) and a<br>
Micromass Quattro Ultima triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (Micromass,<br>
Manchester, UK). To the collected samples were added l00μL of distilled water, 25 uL of<br>
internal standard (500 ng/mL; l-cyclohexyl-3-tetradecylurea, CTU), and 500uL of ethyl<br>
acetate. Then the samples were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 min, and the ethyl acetate layer<br>
was dried under nitrogen. The residue was reconstituted in 25 μL of methanol, and aliquots<br>
(5μL) were injected onto the LC-MS/MS system.<br>
[0294]    Pharmacokinetic studies using a human subject employed doses of 0.1-1.0 mg/kg of<br>
sEH inhibitors (800) or a 0.3 mg/kg dose of 687 dissolved in olive oil administered orally.<br>
Serial bled blood samples (3-50 uL) were collected from finger tips into 50 uL heparinized<br>
capillary tube at various time points (0.5,1, 2,4,6,12 and 24 hr) after administration. These<br>
samples were used to measure parent compounds and their metabolites using LC-MS/MS as<br>
described above for experiments with mice. Blood samples were added 400 μL of distilled<br>
water and 25 μL of internal standard (500 ng/mL CTU), and vortexed. The blood samples<br>
were then extracted with 500 μL of ethyl acetate twice and the ethyl acetate layer was dried<br>
under nitrogen. The residue was reconstituted in 25 μL of methanol, and aliquots (10 μL)<br>
were injected onto the LC-MS/MS system as described above. Biological end points came<br>
from clinical chemistry samples run at The University of California Davis Clinical<br>
Laboratory and a series of 6 inflammatory markers including C reactive protein were run<br>
blind at the University of California Davis Department of Nephrology.<br><br>

[0295]    Analysis. Pharmacokinetics analysis was performed using SigmaPlot software<br>
system (SPSS science, Chicago, IL). A one-compartment model was used for blood<br>
concentration-time profiles for the oral gavage dosing and fits to the following equation (see,<br>
Gibson, G.G. and Skett, P.: INTRODUCTION TO DRUG METABOLISM, SECOND ED.,<br>
Chapman and Hall, New York 1994,199-210):<br>
C = ae-bt<br>
The half-life (t1/2) for the elimination phase was calculated by the following equation:<br>
t1/2 = 0.693/b<br>
The area under the concentration (AUC) was calculated by the following equation:<br>
AUC = alb<br>
Where:<br>
-   C = the total blood concentration at time t<br>
-  a = the extrapolated zero intercept<br>
-   b = the apparent first-order elimination rate constant<br>

5 mg/kg dosing of compounds were administered orally to male Swill Webster mice,   maximum<br>
concentration,c time of maximum concentration,d area under concentration,c half-life.<br>
[0296]    The ester compounds were generally hydrolyzed to the acid compound (687) when<br>
administered orally. An example of the time course of free acid appearance is shown in<br>
Figure 10. When compound 687 was administered orally, it reached the maximum<br>
concentration (2-fold higher than 686) in 30 min, while compound 686 reached its maximum<br>
concentration in 2 h. Furthermore, the area under the curve (AUC) for 687 was 2-fold higher,<br>
indicating an improvement in oral bioavailability. The maximum concentrations of primary<br>
esters (780, 784, 783,781, 788, 800, 803 and 804) esters were 1.5-5-fold higher than 687, and<br>
the AUC increased 1.2-2.3-fold for the ester compounds indicating higher bioavailabilities.<br>
On the other hand, secondary esters (785 and 802) showed similar maximum concentrations<br>
and bioavailabilities to those of 687 in mice, while the tertiary ester (801) displayed a 4-8-<br>
fold decrease in maximum concentration and bioavailability. Accordingly, the alkylation of a<br>
potent acid inhibitor (687) to form primary esters improves the oral availability of these<br>
inhibitors.<br>

* Inhibition potencies were determined using a fluorescent based high-throughput assay. Inhibitors in solution at<br>
10 mM in DMSO were serially diluted by 10-fold increment in Bis/Tris HC1 buffer (25 mM PH 7.0) containing<br>
0.1 mg/mL of BSA (Buffer A). In black 96-well plates, 20pL of the inhibitor dilution or buffer were delivered in<br>
every well, and then 130μL of Human sEH at ~0.4 μg/mL in solution in Buffer A were added to each well The<br>
plate was then mixed and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. Fifty microliters of substrate ((3-Phenyl-<br>
oxiranyl)-acetic acid cyano-(6-methoxy-naphthalen-2-yl)-methyl ester; PHOME) at 200μM in solution in 96:4<br>
Buffer A:DMSO was then added to each well to give [S]final = 50μM and [E]final= ~4nM. The plate was then<br><br>

mixed and incubated in the dark at room temperature (~25°C) for 90 min. Activity was measured by determining<br>
the relative quantity of 6-methoxy-2-naphthaldehyde formed with an excitation wavelength of 316 nm and an<br>
emission wavelength of 460 mn measured with a SpectraMax M-2 fluorometer (molecular Devices, Sunnyvale<br>
CA). Results are not reported.<br>
[0298]    The primary urea pharmacophore can be varied (compound #) with amide or<br>
carbamate functionality to improve physical properties of sEH inhibitors as well. The<br>
carbonyls can be replaced by heterocyclic or acyclic hydrogen bond acceptors and donators<br>
as shown in Table 14.<br>
Example 51<br>
[0299]    This example shows the effect of sEH inhibitors on serum and urinary oxylipin<br>
profiles in rodents.<br>
[0300]    The described soluble epoxide inhibitors have been shown to modulate the relative<br>
abundance and amounts of epoxy and dihydroxy fatty acids formed in treated animals. One<br>
such example of this alteration is provided in Figure 13. In this example, hypertension was<br>
induced in one group of Sprague-Dawley rats by the infusion of angiotensin II (ANGII). A<br>
second group of rats received both ANGII and a subcutaneous injection of the model sEH<br>
inhibitor l-adamantyl-3-(dodecanoic acid) urea (i.e. compound 687). Urine samples were<br>
collected for 24hr post exposure to compound 687 and analyzed for linoleate (Panel A) and<br>
arachidonate (Panel B) derived epoxides and diols using LC/MS/MS. As shown in Figure 13,<br>
ANGII exposure decreased the concentration of both linoleate (EpOMEs) and arachidonate<br>
(EETs) derived epoxides and increased arachidonate derived diols (DHETs) but not linoleate<br>
derived diols (DHOMEs). hi the case of both lipid classes, treating animals with compound<br>
687 resulted in an increase in urinary epoxides, as well as a decrease in diol concentrations.<br>
Example 52<br>
[0301]    This example illustrates the effect of certain compounds of the invention on<br>
members of the arachidonic acid cascade.<br>
[0302]    For epoxy fatty acid hydrolysis, the soluble epoxide hydrolase prefers substrates<br>
with epoxide moieties that are more distant from the carboxyl terminal. Specifically the<br>
substrate preference decreases in the order of 14,15-EET &gt; 11,12-EET &gt; 8,9-EET &gt;&gt;&gt; 5,6-<br>
EET for the epoxides of arachidonic acid. Independently, the relative substrate turnover of<br><br>
WO 2006/045119                                                                                         PCT7US2005/038282<br>

the epoxy arachidonates were calculated at 0.1:8.1:14.3 when a 1:1:2 mixture of 8,9-, 11,12-,<br>
and 14,15-EET fatty acid was hydrolyzed to 30% by rat renal cortex cytosol. By considering<br>
the primary pharmacophore of the urea to be a transition-state analog of epoxide hydrolysis,<br>
inhibitors have now been developed which incorporate long aliphatic acids. These<br>
compounds are better substrate and transition state mimics than those incorporating shorter<br>
aliphatic acids. Accordingly, optimal soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors can be obtained by<br>
producing compounds with aliphatic acid substituents (i.e. a tertiary pharmacophore) which<br>
are separated from the primary pharmacophore by an equivalent distance as the terminal acid<br>
is separated from the epoxide in optimal substrates. Within the enzyme active site, epoxy<br>
fatty acids have been predicted to exist in an extended or pseudo-linear confirmation.<br>
Therefore, both the epoxy fatty acids and the aliphatic acid containing urea structures were<br>
approximated as two dimensional linear representations and measurements were made on<br>
each species. The critical measurements taken were distances (in angstroms) from the<br>
carboxylate hydroxyl to the urea carbonyl and the urea nitrogens.<br>
[0303]    The distance of the carboxylate to the urea function of  l-cyclohexyl-3-octanoic acid<br>
is similar to the distance of the epoxide to the carboxylate in 8,9-EET. Therefore, the<br>
calculated inhibitor potencies were normalized to this compound, resulting in a ranked<br>
inhibitor potency. We then correlated epoxide to carbonyl distance with respect to relative<br>
substrate turnover rate to establish a correlative regression. By plotting the relative inhibitor<br>
potency on this graph we find that the distances of the carboxyl to the N' -nitrogen correlate<br>
best with the carboxyl to epoxide oxygen distance. These data further highlight the similarity<br>
between inhibitor and substrate interaction with the soluble epoxide hydrolase.<br>
