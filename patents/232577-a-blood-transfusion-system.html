				<td>A BLOOD TRANSFUSION SYSTEM<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention provides a blood transfusion system having valve circuit for<br>
transfusion of blood to a patient.<br>
Background and Prior Art of the Invention:<br>
Blood transfusion is used to exchange the infected blood with fresh blood of Neonates<br>
who are suffering from jaundice, have some other blood related diseases and for<br>
babies whose mothers have O (Rh negative) blood group. The blood transfusion<br>
requires continuous repetitive cycles of suction of about 5 to 20 ml of infected blood<br>
along with simultaneous infusion of same quantity of fresh blood. The blood<br>
transfusions are done through the disposable valve and syringes arrangement. The<br>
instrument based on this process i.e Blood Transfusion controller will have several<br>
advantages like accuracy and precision in blood transfusion at predetermined rate<br>
and initiation of various alarms so as to attract the attention of operator in case of<br>
malfunctioning.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings:<br>
In the drawings accompanying this specification<br>
Figure 1 represents the system the various components used in a prior art and its<br>
working.<br>
Figure 2 represents the blood transfusion system of the present invention and its<br>
working.<br>
Reference may be made to the present system of blood transfusion in Neonates which<br>
requires an expert nurse or doctor to sit continuously for 5-6 hours at the bedside<br>
while keeping record of the number of times blood taken out and infused. The prior<br>
art requirements are shown in fig. 1 of the drawings attached with this specification.<br>
The whole process requires 4 syringe strokes. The circuit uses two 3-way stop-corks<br>
(1) and (2) and one syringe (3) and two Intra Venus (I.V.) sets (4) and (5). In the first<br>
stroke, infected blood is sucked out by syringe (3) during its outward stroke through a<br>
special tube (6) fitted to the umbilical vein of the patient. Stop-cork (1) is rotated<br>
manually in such a way that during inward stroke of syringe (3), infected blood goes<br>
to the waste bottle through IV set (4). Now, stop-cork (2) is rotated manually in such a<br>
way that fresh blood is sucked from the bottle by syringe (3) outward stroke. Then both the stop-cork (1) and (2) are rotated manually such that inward stroke of a syringe (3) infuses the fresh blood to baby through the same tube. As this process requires 5 times rotation of 3-way stop-corks &amp; 4 strokes of syringe for one cycle of infusion and withdrawal, it requires the alertness of the doctor all through the process. Moreover, required proper infusion rate cannot be maintained because of human factor involved, thus promoting the chances of blood cell breakage. It is a very cumbersome process and requires maintaining a proper record of infusion and withdrawal cycles alongwith quantity. Moreover, as the speed of suction and infusion of fresh blood varies because of the manual operation, the chances of breakage of blood cells are more. Thus there is a need to improve the present blood transfusion system.<br>
Objects of the Present Invention: The main object of the present invention is to provide a blood transfusion system with valve circuit which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an automatic blood transfusion system wherein lesser number of syringe strokes is required.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an automatic blood transfusion system which will result in minimum involvement of doctor, and that only for checking the functioning of instrument from time to time which obviates the drawback as detailed above.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an automatic transfusion system which can infuse blood at required fixed speed thus eliminating chances of breakage of blood cell which obviates the drawback as detailed above.<br>

The device of the present invention is shown in fig. 2 of the drawings<br>
accompanying this specification. The schematic diagram can be divided into three<br>
major parts. They are:<br>
(i) Disposable Valve circuit<br>
(ii) Syringe fixing arrangement<br>
(iii) Syringe driving mechanism<br>
1. Disposable Valve circuit : The circuit constitutes four one-way valves, one<br>
umbilical tube, three Y-connectors, two syringes and compatible tubings for<br>
various interconnections. The one-way valve are of disposable type and are made<br>
for use with medical fluids. These material of construction is Silicon rubber and<br>
Polycarbonate. There is no generation of static charge and these can be<br>
autoclaved. All tubing consists of standard available I.V. set tubing and makes<br>
leak proof joints. It is a low cost system and is easily affordable.<br>
2. Syringe fixing arrangement : Syringes of capacity between 5-25 ml are required<br>
to be fixed. Clamping arrangement requires only loosening and tightening of<br>
screw after placing syringes in a V-groove.<br>
3. Syringe driving mechanism : It constitutes of motor, slider and driving<br>
mechanism. The syringes are clamped with their piston ends in movable slider<br>
fixed on a rack. Driving mechanism consists of rack and pinion arrangement.<br>
The operation of the device of present invention is as follows:<br>
Any adult or Pediatric I.V. set available in the market can be used. Tube for<br>
connecting with umbilical vein is also available. Insert syringes in the rack with their<br>
piston ends in slider (8). Connect all disposable valves, tubings with syringes as per<br>
circuit shown in the figure (2) of the drawings accompanying the specifications. Put<br>
the fresh blood container at the open end of umbilical tube and at open end of the I.V.<br>
set (5). Switch ON the main switch. The motor will start and the syringes will move<br>
towards top dead centre. One way valves 11 and 15 gets opened and whole system<br>
gets filled with fresh blood. During return stroke, valves 12 and 14 get opened. In this<br>
way all the air bubbles gets eliminated. Then stop the device when both the syringes<br>
are at their bottom dead centre. Connect the umbilical vein of the Patient with tube<br>
(7). And switch ON the mains. The transfusion cycle starts.<br>
The broad specifications of an embodiment of the device of the present invention may<br>
be characterised as follows:<br>
SPECIFICATIONS<br>
Quantity exchanged in one stroke: 5- 20 ml<br>
Flow speed: Variable<br>
Mains Power 220V AC, 50 Hz.<br>
System - Fluid conveyance through readily available tubes and syringes and<br>
one way valves driven by a stepper motor.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not<br>
be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example - 1<br>
Flow rate = 20 ml/min. The green liquid was filled exactly 200 ml in the bottle (say<br>
patient) and red liquid was filled exactly 200ml in the bottle (fresh blood). The motor<br>
speed was set for 20 ml/min. The liquid was consumed in exactly 10 minutes.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are :<br>
1. Use of disposable valve circuit.<br>
2. Valves and tubing can be autoclaved and can be used with medical fluids.<br>
3. Cycle with lesser number of syringe strokes.<br>
4. It provides the basis for development of an automatic blood transfusion device<br>
which will have minimum involvement of doctor, and that only for checking the<br>
functioning of instrument from time to time.<br>
5. It provides the basis for development of an automatic blood transfusion device<br>
which can infuse blood at required fixed speed thus eliminating chances of<br>
breakage of blood cell.<br>
6. It provides the basis for development of an automatic transfusion device based on<br>
the process developed which can record, give alarms and display the blood<br>
quantity interchanged.<br>
7. Based on the system developed, an automatic blood transfusion device can be<br>
designed and fabricated. It can have several audio and visual alarms to make the<br>
system safe and failure proof to the extent possible. Various features which can be<br>
incorporated are: LCD display of amount of blood infused and withdrawn and<br>
total time elapsed during infusion, Selection of flow rate by switches, LCD<br>
display for flow rate and alarms, Alarms for: Bubble in the flow line, Flow rate<br>
