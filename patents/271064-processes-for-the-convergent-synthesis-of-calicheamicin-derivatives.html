				<td>PROCESSES FOR THE CONVERGENT SYNTHESIS OF CALICHEAMICIN<br>
DERIVATIVES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention describes processes for the convergent synthesis of calicheamicin derivatives, and similar analogs using bifunctional and trifunctiona! linker intermediates.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The potent family of antibacterial and antitumor agents known collectively as the calicheamlcins or the LL-E33288 complex, are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,970,198 (1990). The compounds contain a methyltrisulfide that can be reacted with appropriate thiols to form disulfides while at the same time introducing a functional group such as a hydrazide or similar nucleophile. Examples of this reaction with the caiicneamicins are given in U.S. Patent No. 5,053,394. U.S. Patent No. 5,770,701 is directed to a process for preparing targeted forms of disulfide compounds of the LL-E33288 complex. A linker, 4-(4-acetyl-phenoxy)butanoic acid, is condensed with calicheamicin N-acetyl gamma dimethyl hydrazide to afford the carboxylic actd-hydrazone which is further treated with N-hydroxysuccinimide to give the OSu ester (N-succinimidyloxy) which is ready for conjugation with a chosen biomacromolecule.<br>
Previously disclosed synthetic methods for constructing calicheamicin derivatives are complicated by multiple calicheamicin containing synthetic steps having low overall yields. The calicheamicin moiety is inherently toxic, and when already part of a synthetic target necessitates increased safety precautions which must be observed during manipulation and purification of the products of each of the synthetic steps. The claimed process provides a method of fewer steps involving the calicheamicin moiety with increased yields.<br>

(Formula Removed) <br>
with a mercapto compound of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
in an alcohol solvent in the presence of an alkyl carboxytic acid, alk2CO2H, where alk2 is 1 to 4 carbon atoms at about 20° to 70°C for about 1 to 24 hours, wherein Alk1 Sp1 Ar, Z1, Q, and Sp are as defined above, to produce a bilinker-carboxylic acid of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
b.	isolating the bilinker-carboxylic acid of step (a);<br>
c.	reacting the isolated bilinker-carboxylic acid of step (b) with N-<br>
hydroxysuccinimide, 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenol, pentafluorophenol, 4-nitrophenol, 2,4-<br>
dinitrophenol, or N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide in the presence of 1,3-<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide<br>
(EDCI). or N.N'-disuccinimdyl carbonate in an inert solvent containing 0-50% DMF to<br>
generate trifunctional linker intermediates, of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
