COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
"A Package-Companion-User Interactive System "<br>
(a) Bilcare Limited (b) a company registered under the companies Act 1956 and (c) having its office at 307, Narayan Peth, Pune - 411030, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a package-companion-user interactive system facilitating and providing a comprehensive means of product authentication, registration as well as facilitating proper &amp; effective consumption and / or usage of packaged product for effective compliance, with user real-time feedback vide an interactive means and further capturing the product-user feedback information to provide  value added services to the user by  support services providers.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Multiple issues with varying impacts influence the handling, use and / or consumption of any product. The complexity increases with multiplicity of operations including handling, use or consumption of a product on an intermittent, regular or variable frequency basis. For effective use of a product, a user requires appropriate product and its usage related support, such as:<br>
1.	Means to establish the authenticity of the product with essential information about its manufacturer, date of manufacture, date of expiry, etc;<br>
2.	Basic product information and instructions for its effective use,<br>
3.	Prescription  and  dosage  instructions,   its  recommended  consumption frequency, and relevant precautionary measures if any;<br>
4.	Means of recording the product usage history for follow-up and support services<br>
5.	Timely on-line professional support when necessary.<br>
Product related information is generally printed on the package and /or is given in the product information sheet inside the package. It is not uncommon to get packages with the essential information such as date of manufacture, name of the manufacturer, expiry date, price, etc printed or inscribed in an illegible manner making the authentication of the product difficult. Counterfeiting and spurious products continue to be an undesirable social menace. It is estimated that 5-7% of world trade is in counterfeits, which is in the region of 250-350 billion dollars and is growing fast. In the period1990 - 1995 the world trade grew by 47% whereas in contrast counterfeits grew by 150% (Briefing on Counterfeiting, AIMÂ® Paper 1999)... This needs to be tackled effectively through effective packaging and user-friendly devices that can be employed at the user - end to ensure his safety, etc. Several initiatives by way of security labels on the product or packaging, holographic solutions on unit product package, unique colored unit product package, color changing inks, multi color printing etc have already been employed but fool- proof authentication continue to elude the researchers.<br>
Another area of user significance is a set of user-understandable and usage program that is accessible to the user at all times so that user-based compliance can be enhanced. Present day options available to the consumer are by way of prescriptions, or basic information provided in OTC products. Most often the user has to rely on his memory with regard to the product dosage, usage frequency etc.<br><br>
Rapidly changing life-styles and patterns and evolution of newer health related issues are making real-time help an imperative. It is desirable to have the product usage data automatically captured when the user interacts with the package so that the real-time feedback can be made available or if required off-line depending on the product and the circumstances under which the product is being used. Accurate consumer / patient feedback to manufacturers and/or researchers of a product that is under consumer / clinical trials is desirable as it helps to arrive at better understanding the product features and functions especially in terms of their effectiveness, side effects, claimed efficacy of the medication, etc.<br>
Therefore a desirable feature would also be to provide the user an easy means to record his feedback as and when he/she has used or consumed the product or any observations he/she makes regarding the product reaction on him, or any indications that he/she may like to convey to the professional for further advice.<br>
Several efforts have been made in the past to achieve some of the above-mentioned features.<br>
US patent no. 6961285 discloses a drug delivery management system to guide users / patients to take their medication and to assist third parties to collect information with regard to the patient medication intake. The system includes a portable medication monitor used in association with an instrumented medication package to provide intake data acquisition and patient support functions. The system may further be connected to a computer or computer network allowing information distribution between the medication monitor and third parties, such as physicians or pharmacists. This prior art details a monitoring system more specifically for use in medication monitoring, which has medication packaged in a specific blister format and the said blister having capability of monitoring access to medication and relaying it to a separate monitor. The system is not capable of authenticating the packaged medication product nor is it capable of capturing user-feedback on real-time basis w.r.t. his / her observations, indications and feelings on the consumed product, etc.<br>
US patent no. 5412372 discloses a portable medication dispenser aid which monitors dispensing times including regimen-conforming use of medications provided in standard as-marketed blister packages. A standard blister package and a separate, disposable sensor sheet are loaded onto a compact housing containing supervisory electronics, visual indicators, and an audible alarm. The sensor sheet consists of electrical or optical sensing regions corresponding to each individual compartment of the blister package. An electrically conductive or optical connector in the dispenser housing allows periodic scanning of the sensor sheet circuitry by the control circuitry in the dispenser housing without adding connector components to disposable sensor sheet. When a medication is ejected through the backing layer of the standard blister package, an electrical or optical parameter associated with a corresponding region of the sensor sheet is altered, thereby permitting the control circuitry to monitor the dispensing event. Stored patient compliance data may then be reported remotely through an optical or electrical interface between the dispenser and an external system for review by the pharmacist/physician. The system addresses the issue of reminding the user of when to take a medication from a specific unit dose package containing the<br><br>
medication but is not capable of authenticating the product, capturing user interaction and feedback. The system is specific to a type of package and lacks the desired flexibility for use in diverse types of packages containing different types, forms, sizes and shapes of medication.<br>
US patent nos.: 6839304 and 6411567 describes a drug delivery management system for managing delivery of pharmaceutical drugs from a blister package that includes a plurality of cells arranged in a grid. Each of the cells is sealed by a breakable wall and holds a unit-dose of medication. A user gains access to the medication in a given cell by puncturing the breakable wall associated with the given cell. A severable conductor is positioned proximate to each breakable wall. The severable conductor associated with a given cell ruptures upon puncturing of the breakable wall associated with the given cell. A computer chip is electrically connected to the severable conductors. The computer chip senses the puncturing of each cell in the grid by monitoring the rupturing of each of the severable conductors. An RF transmitter is coupled to the computer chip. The RF transmitter sends information corresponding to usage of each of medications stored in the blister package to a remote information transceiver. The system is specific to blister type packages. The key limitation results from the use of non-insulating layer to incorporate the severable conductors. As the non-insulating layer is in direct touch with the medication, it becomes imperative to get the material approved by the regulatory authorities prior to its use. The manufacturing process also gets complicated The system also is limited to and focused on user-compliance but lacks the aspects of capturing the much desired user interaction and feedback. Incorporating remote devices on the package for receiving and transmitting makes the pack unwieldy and unviable for commercial exploitation. The other limitation of this system is that it does not address authentication of the product package through a customized encoding which becomes unique for that specific package.<br>
It may be noted that the drug delivery management systems disclosed above primarily focus on monitoring / tracking delivery / dosing of medication to patients and assisting patients to medical compliance. Provision of authentication of the product in the existing package / container and customized end user feed back facility is not provided in systems disclosed in the prior art. Further, the devices disclosed in the prior art are specific to packages of specific size /shape of the packaging and therefore cannot be exploited in a general manner in diverse packages containing diverse products.<br>
Critical analysis of the prior art reveal the following shortcomings:<br>
&gt;	Non-existence of systems with integrated device on the package that facilitates authentication of the packaged product simultaneously providing relevant product information, user instructions for product use, etc.;<br>
&gt;	The systems are dedicated to specific types of packages in terms of their size and shapes without provision for interaction with end user, authenticating the end user and without user-friendly interactive input devices for the end user and communicating means to transmit the user based information to service providers<br><br>
&gt;	Special packages with additional circuitry needs to be created which may not be possible to incorporate in existing packages.<br>
&gt;	Circuitry may require additional layer / laminate / insulating material needing regulatory clearances, thereby limiting their applications;<br>
&gt;	Systems incapable of integrating automation in existing packages and manufacturing lines resulting in non-viable commercial exploitation;<br>
&gt;	No provisions for diverse end users including physically impaired persons for input of user-feed back regarding effects, symptoms of the product<br>
&gt;	No provisions for deactivating package after the expiry date of the product to avoid misuse or wrong use.<br>
It has been a long standing need in the industry to provide comprehensive package-product-user interactive system which has the capability of addressing all the critical needs of any user with respect to the usage of any packaged product bought by him/her right from its recognition, authentication and access to key manufacturing and usage information to the convenience of programmable usage for proper, effective and enhanced correct usage along with the need of capturing of user related feedback on real-time basis for possibility of further communication with diverse devices for enabling extension of value support services by manufacturers and/or related service providers as desired and needed by the user.<br>
The present invention addresses the shortcomings of the prior art and provides a novel multidimensional package-companion-user interactive system that can be used effectively for any packaged product which is supported by a unique companion device system, which enables any user to orient the companion exclusively and provide himself/herself with all the key features which would enable effective usage of the product along with the effective real-time capture of his/her feedback for own use or optionally for communicating the same for better management by the related service providers..<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
