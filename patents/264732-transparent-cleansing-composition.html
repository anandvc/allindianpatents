				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a transparent cleansing composition, which provided excellent viscosity, rheology and transparency similar to cocodiethanolamide.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
It is customary to use thickening agents for cosmetic, detergent-containing preparations, e.g., shampoos, so as to stabilize the disperse systems and for better handling during use. In the past, Cocodiethanolamide has been extensively used as a thickening agent in shampoo preparations as it is liquid at room temperature, renders desired viscosity at extreme conditions and is cost effective. However, studies have raised concern over the use of cocodiethanolamide, as nitrosamines are often present as a by-product of the cocodiethanolamide production, may form potentially carcinogenic Thus, the use of cocodiethanolamide in personal hair care and skin products such as cosmetics, facial soaps and shampoos has been questioned from a health standpoint.<br>
The formulation of shampoos necessitates a trade off between two conflicting physical properties. On the one hand, consumer conception demands a higher viscosity product; while on the other hand, economics require a product low in solid content. Thus it has been a challenge to make shampoo compositions, which gives excellent transparency, gives desired viscosity at extreme temperatures and is cost effective.<br>
The disclosed invention has addressed this problem by combining a low molecular weight lipophilic non-ionic surfactant and polymeric high molecular weight hydrophilic ethoxylated fat derivative as thickening system for a transparent shampoo composition.<br>
2<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the invention is to prepare a transparent cleansing preparation with optimum viscosity.<br>
Another object of the invention is to prepare a transparent cleansing preparation, which is stable at extreme temperatures..<br>
Another object of the invention is to prepare a low cost thickening system for transparent claensing preparation without compromising on the quality of the product.<br>
Further objects, features and advantages will become apparent from the following description<br>

Nonionic surfactants, which are preferably used in combination with an anionic, amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactant, can be broadly defined as compounds produced by the condensation of alkylene oxide groups (hydrophilic in nature) with an organic hydrophobic compound, which may be aliphatic or alkyl aromatic in nature. Examples of preferred classes of nonionic surfactants are:<br>
1.	The polyethylene oxide condensates of alkyl phenols, e.g., the condensation<br>
products of alkyl phenols having an alkyl group containing from about 6 to 12<br>
carbon atoms in either a straight chain or branched chain configuration, with<br>

60 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alkyl phenol. The alkyl substituent in such<br>
compounds may be derived from polymerized propylene, diisobutylene, octane,<br>
or nonane, for example.<br>
2.	Those derived from the condensation of ethylene oxide with the product<br>
resulting from the reaction of propylene oxide and ethylene diamine products<br>

Thickening Agents:<br>
One of the most preferred thickening agent used in this invention are lipophilic non ionic thickening surfactants. The most preferred non ionic surfactant used in the invention is Laureth 3 in combination with other thickening agents<br>
Particularly useful thickening agents in accordance with the present invention include PEG 150 distearate, PEG 105 pentaerythritol dibehenate, PEG 105 pentaerythritol tetrabehenate, PEG 150 pentaerythritol tetrastearate, PEG 150 pentaerythritol tetralaurate, PEG 150 pentaerythritol tetraisostearate, PEG 130 pentaerythritol tetrastearate and PEG 75 pentaerythritol tetrastearate. Also contemplated as particularly useful thickening agents in accordance with the present invention are PEG 105 pentaerythritol monobehenate, PEG 05 pentaerythritol tribehenate, PEG 150 pentaerythritol monostearate, PEG 150 pentaerythritol distearate, PEG 50 pentaerythritol tristearate, PEG 150<br>
8<br><br>
pentaerythritol monolaurate, PEG 150 pentaerythritol dilaurate, PEG 150 trilaurate, PEG 150 monoisostearate, PEG 150 pentaerythritol diisostearate, PEG 150 pentaerythritol triisostearate, PEG 130 pentaerythritol monostearate, PEG 130 pentaerythritol distearate, PEG 130 pentaerythritol tristearate, PEG 75 pentaerythritol monostearate, PEG 75 pentaerythritol distearate, and PEG 75 pentaerythritol tristearate &amp; similar other PEG derivatives e.g PEG 120-Methyl glucose dioleate are covered under the scope the present invention.<br>
The thickening agents of the present invention may be employed in the formulation of a number of topical preparations, for example, shampoos, shower gel formulations, gels, cosmetics in general, foam baths and the like. The thickening agents of the present invention are applicable to the formulation of a variety of topical preparations as noted hereinabove as falling within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The thickening agents of the present invention are prepared from a pentaerythritol intermediate such as PEG 75 pentaerythritol, PEG 105 pentaerythritol, PEG 130 pentaerythritol, PEG 150 pentaerythritol and the like. PEG stands for polyethylene glycol, while the number thereafter stands for the number of moles of ethylene glycol attached to the molecule. These intermediates are formed as a reaction product of pentaerythritol and ethylene oxide. By controlling the reaction, the number of moles of ethylene glycol attached to the molecule may be determined as desired.<br>
However, as pentaerythritol is a solid having a melting point of about 267° C, it is initially reacted with ethylene carbonate which functions as both a solvent and a reactant to provide a liquid intermediate, PEG 4 pentaerythritol. This intermediate is subsequently reacted with ethylene oxide to produce the desired PEG "X" pentaerythritol intermediate having the desired number of moles "X" of ethylene glycol adhering to the molecule. It is to be understood that the number of moles of ethylene glycol in the specific examples is by way of illustration only, and is not<br>
9<br><br>
intended as a limitation upon the thickening agent and topical preparations formulated therefrom which constitute the present invention.<br>
The following examples while not intended to be limiting, demonstrate several preferred embodiments of formulating a PEG "X" pentaerythritol intermediate in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Although the present invention has been described with particular reference to specific examples, variations and modifications of the present invention can be effected within the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
Aqueous Carrier<br>
Water is used as an aqueous carrier in this shampoo composition. The disclosed invention comprises from about 20% to about 94%, preferably from about 50% to about 94%, more preferably from about 60% to about 85%, by weight of water.<br>
Conventional Optional Components<br>
The shampoo compositions of the present invention may further comprise one or more of the conventional optional components known for use in shampoo or conditioning compositions, provided that the components used are compatible with the essential component of the shampoo composition both physically and chemically. These optional components should necessarily not impair the stability, aesthetics or performance of the product. Concentrations of such optional components typically range from about 0.001% to about 50% by weight of the shampoo compositions.<br>
Optional components may include anti static agents, dyes, organic solvents or diluents, pearlescent aids, foam boosters, additional surfactants or co-surfactants (nonionic, cationic, zwitterionic), pediculocides, pH adjusting agents, perfumes, preservatives, proteins, skin active agents, suspending agents, styling polymers,<br>
10<br><br>
sunscreens, thickeners, vitamins, and viscosity adjusting agents. This list of optional components is not meant to be exclusive, and other optional components can be used.<br>
Examples:<br>
Example 1<br>
: Sodium Laureth Sulfate 10.00 - 20.00, Sodium chloride 0.1-5.00, Water QS to<br>
100.<br>
Very high amount of electrolyte is required to get desirable viscosity. Thinning<br>
effect is observed at elevated temperature<br>
Example 2<br>
Sodium Laureth Sulfate 10.00 - 20.00, PEG 150 Pentaerythritol Tetrasterate 0.1-<br>
1.00, Sodium chloride 0.1-5.00, Water QS to 100.<br>
When using only polymeric thickener, the amount of electrolyte required is still high. The flowability of the mixture at a temperature below 5°C reduces where gelling is observed. It enhanced viscosity of the product while maintaining transparency of the product even at low temperature.<br>
Example 3<br>
Sodium Laureth Sulfate 10.00 - 20.00, Sodium chloride 0.1-5.00, Laureth- 3 2.00 - 5.00, Water QS to 100.<br>
When using the non-polymeric thickener, the amount of electrolyte required is very high. Also the mixture looses its viscosity at high temperature.<br>
Example 4<br>
Sodium Laureth Sulfate 10.00 - 20.00, Sodium chloride 0.1-1.00, CDEA 0.5 -<br>
11<br><br>
5.00, Water QS to 100.<br>
The system thickened with CDEA exhibits ideal flow properties at low as well as high temperature. The transparency of the product remains unaffected at extreme temperature conditions. The optimum amount of electrolyte is required to get desired viscosity Example 5<br>
Sodium Laureth Sulfate 10.00 - 20.00, Sodium chloride 0.1-5.00, CMEA 2.00 -5.00, Water QS to 100.<br>
The system thickened with CMEA exhibits gelling a low temperature. Some times it also looses its transparency at low temperature. The process also requires heating, as CMEA is solid at RT.<br>
Example 6<br>
. Sodium Laureth Sulfate 10.00 - 20.00, Sodium chloride 0.1-1.00, Laureth- 3 0.5<br>
- 2.00, PEG 150 Pentaerythritol Tetrasterate 0.1- 0.5 Water QS to 100.<br>
This mixture exhibits flow properties similar to CDEA thickened system at low as well as high temperature. The transparency of the product remains unaffected at extreme temperature conditions. The optimum amount of electrolyte is required to get desired viscosity.<br><br><br>
A thickening system for transparent topical composition, said thickening system comprising low molecular weight lipophilic non-ionic surfactant and polymeric high molecular weight hydrophilic, high ethoxylated ester. A transparent cleansing composition, said composition comprising at least one surfactant selected from the group anionic, amphoteric or mixtures thereof; and a thickening system for cleansing<br>
