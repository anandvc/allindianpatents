TRANSMISSION RATE CONTROL METHOD, MOBILE STATION,<br>
AND RADIO BASE STATION<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. P2005-127063, filed on March 29, 2005; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1* Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a transmission rate corftrol method for controlling transmission rate of an uplink user data, a mobile station, and a radio base station.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
In a conventional mobile communication system, in an uplink from a mobile station UE to a radio base station Node B, a radio network controller RNC is configured to determine a transmission rate of a dedicated channel, in consideration of radio resources of the radio base station Node B, an interference volume in an uplink, transmission power of the mobile station UE, transmission processing performance of the mobile station UE, a transmission rate required for an upper application, or the like, and to notify the determined transmission rate of the dedicated channel by a message of a layer-3 (Radio Resource Control Layer) to both of the mobile station UE and the radio base station Node B.<br><br>
Here, the radio network controller RNC is provided at an upper level of the radio base station Node B, and is an apparatus configured to control the radio base station Node B and the mobile station UE-► In general, data communications often cause burst traffic compared with voice communications or TV communications. Therefore, it is preferable that a transmission rate of a channel used for the data communications is changed fast.<br>
However, as shown in FIG. 1, the radio network controller RNC integrally controls a plurality of radio base stations Node B in general. Therefore, in the conventional mobile communication system, there has been a problem that it is difficult to perform fast control for changing of the transmission rate of channel (for example, per approximately 1 through 100 ms), due to processing load, processing delay, or the like.<br>
In addition, in the conventional radio network controller RNC, there has been also a problem that costs for implementing an apparatus and for operating a network are substantially increased even if the fast control for changing of the transmission rate of the channel can be performed*<br>
Therefore, in the conventional mobile communication system, control for changing of the transmission rate of the channel is generally performed on the order from a few hundred ms to a few seconds.<br>
Accordingly, in the conventional mobile communication system, when burst data transmission is performed as shown in FIG. 2A, the data are transmitted by accepting low-speed, high-delay, and low-transmission efficiency as shown in FIG.<br><br>
2Br or, as shown in FIG, 2C, by reserving radio resources for high-speed communications to accept that radio bandwidth resources in an unoccupied state and hardware resources in the radio base station Node B are wasted* &gt; It should be noted that both of the above-described radio bandwidth resources and hardware resources are applied to the vertical radio resources in FIGS. 2B and 2C.<br>
Therefore, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2), which are international standardization organizations of the third generation mobile communication system, have discussed a method for controlling radio resources at high speed in a layer-1 and a media access control (MAC) sublayer (a layer-2) between the radio base station Node B and the mobile station UE, so as to utilize the radio resources effectively. Such discussions or discussed functions will be hereinafter referred to as “Enhanced Uplink (EUL)”.<br>
In the “Enhanced Uplink”, a MAC-layer function, which is located in each cell of a radio base station Node B, is configured to control a transmission rate of uplink user data transmitted by a mobile station UE, using two transmission rate control channels described below.<br>
As a first transmission rate control method, the MAC-layer function located in each cell of the radio base station Node B is configured to transmit an absolute value for a maximum allowable transmission rate of uplink user data (or parameter relating to the maximum allowable transmission rate) to each mobile station UE (individual mobile stations or all mobile stations) using an “Absolute Rate Grant Channel (AGCH) “,<br><br>
sa as to control the transmission rate of uplink user data of each mobile station UE.<br>
Here, the above-described parameter relating to the maximum allowable transmission rate is a transmission power ratio between an “Enhanced Dedicated Physical Data Channel (E-DPDCH)” and a “Dedicated Physical Control Channel (DPCCH)” (hereinafter,- an EDCH transmission power ratio) or the like. This EDCH transmission power ratio is calculated by “transmission power of E-DPDCH/ transmission power of DPCCH”*<br>
The increase/decrease of the parameter relating to the maximum allowable transmission rate is corresponding to the increase/decrease of the transmission rate, and it is acquired in connection with the transmission rate. In 3GPP, this parameter relating to the maximum allowable transmission rate is defined as the EDCH transmission power ratio (See, Non-Patent literature 1:3GPP TSG-RAN TS25.309 v6.1.0).<br>
As a second transmission rate control method, the MAC-layer function located in each cell of the radio base station Node B is configured to transmit a command indicating relative values such as an “Up Command”, a xsDown Command”, a “Keep Command”, or the like, for a maximum allowable transmission rate of uplink user data {or parameter relating to the maximum allowable transmission rate) to each mobile station UE (individual mobile stations or all mobile stations) using a “Relative rate Grant Channel (RGCH)”, so as to control the transmission rate of uplink user data of each mobile station UE.<br>
When the mobile station UE transmits uplink user data, the EDCH transmission power ratio which can be accepted by the<br><br>
mobile station UE (a maximum allowable EDCH transmission power ratio of mobile station UE) is determined using the above-mentioned transmission control channels (AGCH and RGCH) .<br>
Then, the mobile station UE determines a transmission data block size (TBS: Transport Block Size) per transmission time interval (TTI: Transmit Time Interval), based on the uplink user data size stored in a transmission buffer and the maximum allowable EDCH transmission power ratio of the mobile station UE.<br>
Here, the mobile station UE is configured to determine the transmission data block size (TBS) per transmission time interval (TTI) using a correspondence table which shows correspondence between a transmission data block size (TBS) and the EDCH transmission power ratio of the uplink user data.<br>
As shown in Non-Patent literature 2 (3GPP TSG-RAN R2-042717), the radio network controller RNC is configured to notify the correspondence table to the mobile station UE by a layer-3 signaling, when a call setup is performed.<br>
Further, as shown in the Non-Patent literature 2, the radio network controller RNC is configured to notify the correspondence table which shows correspondence between the transmission data block size (TBS) and a transmission wave amplitude ratio between an “Enhanced Dedicated Physical Data Channel (E-DPDCH)” and a “Dedicated Physical Control Channel (DPCCH)” (hereinafter, an EDCH transmission wave amplitude ratio) r to the radio base station Node B and the mobile station UE, This EDCH transmission wave amplitude ratio is calculated by “transmission wave amplitude of E-DPDCH/ transmission wave amplitude of DPCCH”.<br><br>
As mentioned above, in the conventional mobile communication system using “Enhance Uplink”, the radio network controller RNC is configured to notify both of the correspondence table between the transmission data block size (TBS) and the EDCH transmission power ratio and the correspondence table between the transmission data block size (TBS) and the transmission wave amplitude radio, to the radio base station Node B and the mobile station UE, using the layer-3 signaling*<br>
Accordingly/ there has been a problem that the amount of layer-3 signaling becomes huge, and the delay for call connection occurs.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

(Operations of Mobile Communication System According to First Embodiment of the Present Invention)<br>
Referring to FIGs. 14A and 14B, operations of the mobile communication system according to the embodiment of the present invention will be described. FIG. 14A shows the operation of the mobile station UE of the mobile communication system, and FIG.14B shows the operation of the radio base station Node B of the mobile communication system.<br>
As shown in FIG- 14A, in step S101, the mobile station UE receives layer-2 related control information from the radio network controller RNC*<br>
Then, the mobile station UE extracts the first correspondence table of the transmission data block size and<br><br>
the EDCH transmission wave amplitude ratio (refer to FIG.6), from the received layer-2 related control information, so as to the extracted first correspondence table.<br>
In step S102, the mobile station UE generates the second correspondence table (second correspondence) of the transmission data block size and the EDCH transmission power ratio, based on the first correspondence, so as to the generated second correspondence table.<br>
In step S103, the mobile station US receives the Absolute Rate Grant Channel (AGCH) form the radio base station Node B*<br>

In step S104, the mobile station UE determines a transmission wave amplitude of the uplink user data, based on the determined transmission data block size of the uplink user data and the stored first correspondence table.<br>
In step S105, the mobile station US transmits the uplink user data using the determined transmission data block size and the transmission wave amplitude*<br>
As shown in FIG.14B, in step S201, the radio base station Node B receives the layer-2 related control information from the radio network controller RNC.<br>
Then, the radio base station Node B extracts the first correspondence table of the transmission data block size and the EDCH transmission wave amplitude ratio (refer to FIG. 6), from the received layer-2 related control information, so as to store the extracted first correspondence table.<br><br>
In step S2Q2, the radio base station Node B generates a second correspondence table (second correspondence) of the transmission data block size of uplink user data and the EDCH transmission power ratio, based on the above-described first correspondence.<br>
In step 203, the radio base station Node B notifies the Absolute Rate Grant Channel (AGCH) to the mobile station UE.<br>
Then, the radio base station Node B allocates receive processing resources for the uplink user data, on the assumption that the mobile station UE firstly determines a transmission data block size of the uplink user data based on the EDCH transmission power ratio which is notified via the AGCH, and the stored second correspondence table, and then, determines a transmission wave amplitude of the uplink user data based on the determined transmission data block size of the uplink user data and the stored first correspondence table.<br>
In step S204, the radio base station Node B receives the uplink user data from the mobile station UE, using the allocated receive processing resources.<br>
