The compounds of formula (I) can form acid addition salts thereof. It will be appreciated<br>
that for use in medicine the salts of the compounds of formula (I) should be<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts will be apparent<br>
to those skilled in the art and include those described in J. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66, 1-19,<br>
such as acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic,<br>
sulfuric, nitric, hydroiodic, metaphosphoric, or phosphoric acid; and organic acids e.g.<br>
succinic, maleic, acetic, fumaric, citric, tartaric, benzoic, trifluoroacetic, malic, lactic,<br>
formic, propionic, glycolic, gluconic, camphorsulfuric, isothionic, mucic, gentisic,<br>
isonicotinic, saccharic, glucuronic, furoic, glutamic, ascorbic, anthranilic, salicylic,<br>
phenylacetic, maridelic, embonic (pamoic), ethanesulfonic, pantothenic, stearic, sulfinilic,<br>
alginic and galacturonic acid; and arylsulfonic, for example benzenesulfonic, ptoluenesulfonic,<br>
methanesulfonic or naphthalenesulfonic acid; base addition salts formed<br>
with alkali meta|s and alkaline earth metals and organic bases such as N,Ndibenzylethylenediamine,<br>
chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine,<br>
meglumine (N-methylglucamine), lysine and procaine; and internally formed salts. Certain<br>
of the compounds of formula (I) may form acid addition salts with less than one or one or<br>
more equivalents of the acid, for example to form a dihydrochloride salt. The present<br>
invention includes within its scope all possible stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric<br>
forms. Salts having a non-physiologically acceptable anion or cation are within the scope<br>
of the invention as useful intermediates for the preparation of physiologically acceptable<br>
salts and/or for use in non-therapeutic, for example, in vitro, situations.<br>
The solvates may, for example, be hydrates.<br>
This invention also includes within its scope stoichiornetric hydrates or solvates as well as<br>
compounds containing variable amounts of water and/or solvent.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be prepared in crystalline or non-crystalline form, and,<br>
if crystalline, may optionally be hydrated or solvated. Furthermore, some of the crystalline<br>
forms of the compounds of formula(l) may exist in alternative polymorphic forms, which<br>
are included in the present invention.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the compounds of formula (I), wherein<br>
n is 1, contain at least one chiral centre (namely the carbon atom shown as * in formula<br>
(1a)and (1b)and may be represented by formula (1a) and (1b).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The wedged bond indicates that the bond is above the plane of the paper. The broken<br>
bond indicates that the bond is below the plane of the paper.<br>
At least two asymmetric carbon atoms are present in the compounds of formula (I),<br>
wherein Rg is different from hydrogen and may be represented by formula (1c), (1d), (Figure Removed)<br>
Further asymmetric carbon atoms are possible when R$ and R4 are not the same group<br>
and/or when RQ and R/ are not the same group and/or when — is a single bond and/or<br>
when — is a single bond and R2 is C1-4 alkyl.<br>
Thus, for example at least two asymmetric carbon atoms are present when RQ and Ry are<br>
not the same group and — is a single bond (namely the carbon atoms shown as ** and<br>
as *** in formula (1g)).<br>
It is to be understood that all stereoisomeric forms, including all enantiomers,<br>
diastereoisomers and all mixtures thereof, including racemates, are encompassed within<br>
the scope of the present invention and the reference to compounds of formula (I) includes<br>
all stereoisomeric forms unless otherwise stated.<br>
The present invention also includes isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to<br>
those recited in formulas I and following, but for the fact that one or more atoms are<br>
replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic<br>
mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be<br>
incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon,<br>
nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, iodine, and chlorine, such as 3H, 11C, 14C, 18F,<br>
123I and 125I.<br>
Compounds of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said<br>
compounds that contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms<br>
are within the scope of the present invention. Isotopically - labeled compounds of the<br>
present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H, 14C are<br>
incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated , i.e.,<br>
3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of<br>
preparation and detectability. 11C and 18F isotopes are particularly useful in PET (positron<br>
emission tomography), and 125I isotopes are particularly useful in SPECT (single photon<br>
emission computerized tomography), all useful in brain imaging. Further, substitution with<br>
heavier isotopes such as deuterium , i.e., 2H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages<br>
resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced<br>
dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically<br>
labeled compounds of formulas I and following of this invention can generally be prepared<br>
by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples below,<br>
by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically<br>
labeled reagent.<br>

The compounds of the invention are antagonists of tachykinin receptors, including<br>
substance P and other neurokinins, both in vitro and in vivo and are thus of use in the<br>
treatment of conditions mediated by tachykinins, including substance P and other<br>
neurokinins.<br>
Tachykinins are a family of peptides that share a common carboxyl-terminal sequence<br>
(Phe-X-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2). They are actively involved in the physiology of both lower and<br>
advanced lifeforms. In mammalian lifeforms the main tachykinins are subtance P (SP),<br>
Neurokinin A (NKA) and Neurokinin B (NKB) which act as neurotransmitters and<br>
neuromodulators. Mammalian tachykinins may contribute to the pathophysiology of a<br>
number of human diseases.<br>
Three types of tachykinins receptors have been identified, namely NKI(SP-preferring),<br>
NK2 (NKA-preferring) and NK3 (NKB-preferring) which are widely distributed throughout<br>
the central nervous (CNS) and peripheral nervous system.<br>
Particularly the compounds of the invention are antagonists of the NK1 receptor.<br>
The compounds of the present invention also have activity as selective serotonin reuptake<br>
inhibitors (hereinafter referred to as SSRIs) and are thus of use in the treatment of<br>
conditions mediated by selective inhibition of the serotonin reuptake transporter protein.<br>
Thus, the compounds of the present invention combine dual activity as tachykinin<br>
antagonists, including substance P and other neurokinins, and as SSRIs. In particular,<br>
the compounds of the invention combine dual activity as NK1 receptor antagonists and as<br>
SSRIs.<br>
N«i -receptor binding affinity has been determined in vitro in a binding Scintillation<br>
proximity assay (SPA) by measuring the compounds' ability to displace [125l]Tyr8-<br>
Substance P (SP) from recombinant human NK-] receptors stably expressed in Chinese<br>
Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell membranes prepared by using a modification of the method<br>
described by Beattie D.T. et al. (Br. J. Pharmacol, 116:3149-3157, 1995). Briefly,<br>
polystrene Leadseeker WGA-SPA beads (Amersham Biosciences) were mixed with cell<br>
membranes in a bead/membrane ratio of 50:1 (w/w) in assay buffer (75 mM Tris pH 7.8,<br>
75 mM NaCI, 4 mM MnCI2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Chaps, 1 mM PMSF). The mixture was<br>
placed on ice for 30 minutes to allow the formation of membrane/bead complex before<br>
BSA was added to a final concentration of 1%. After another 30 minutes incubation on<br>
ice, the bead/membrane complex was washed twice and suspended in assay buffer.<br>
[125l]Tyr8-Substance P (2200 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer) was then added to the<br>
bead/membrane complex with a final concentration of 0.4 nM. 30 ul of the resulting<br>
mixture was then dispensed to each well of Nalgen NUNC 384-well plate with 1 ul<br>
compound pre-dispensed in DMSO. The plates were then sealed and pulse centrifuged<br>
at 1100 rpm. After 3 hours incubation at room temperature with shaking, the plates were<br>
centrifuged for 2 min at 1100 rpm and measured in Viewlux imager (PerkinElmer) for 5<br>
minutes with a 618-nm filter. Inhibition of [125l]Tyr8-Substance P binding to NK-)-receptors<br>
was measured by the reduction of luminescent signal. IC50 values of each compound<br>
were determined by an 11-point 3x-dilution inhibition curve, pKj values were calculated<br>
using the KD of [125l]Tyr8-Substance P determined in a separate experiment.<br>
For representative compounds of the invention the NK^-receptor binding affinity has also<br>
been determined in vitro using conventional filtration techniques by measuring the<br>
compounds' ability to displace [3H] -substance P SP from recombinant human NK-)<br>
receptors expressed in CHO cell membranes prepared as described above. Briefly,<br>
ligand binding was performed in 0.2 ml of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 3 rnM<br>
MnCl2, 0.02% BSA, 0.5 nM [3H]-Substance P (30-56 Ci/mmol Amersham), a final<br>
membrane protein concentration of 30-50 ug/ml, and the test compounds. The incubation<br>
proceeded at room temperature for 40 min and was stopped by filtration. Non-specific<br>
binding was determined using excess of substance P (1 uM) and represents about 6-10%<br>
of the total binding.<br>
Compounds of the invention were further characterised in a functional assay using FLIPR<br>
technology for the determination of their effect to inhibit the intracellular calcium increase<br>
induced by SP in both Human-NK^-CHO cells and human U2OS cells transducted with<br>
NK-) BacMan virus. Briefly, 10K-15K cells/well were seeded in 384 well Greiner bio-one<br>
plate in culture medium (DMEM with 10% FBS), incubated overnight in CO2 at 37°C. For<br>
human U20S cells, 1% (v/v) BacMan virus carrying NK-j gene was mixed with cells<br>
before plating. After aspirating the medium, cells were loaded with cytoplasmic calcium<br>
indicator Calcium 3 dye (Molecular Devices Co.) in 30ul/well buffer (Hank's balanced salts<br>
with 20 mM Hepes) and incubated in C02 at 37°C for 60 minutes. 10ut/well assay buffer<br>
(Hank's balanced salts with 20 mM Hepes) containing different concentrations of<br>
compounds was then added to the cells for another 30 minutes incubation at 37°C.<br>
Finally, 10ul/well SP in assay buffer containing 0.1% BSA was added to the cells and<br>
fluorescence signal read on a FLIPR system. IC50 values of each compound were<br>
determined by an 11-point 3X-dilution inhibition curve. The potency of the antagonist (fpHQ<br>
value or pKB value) was calculated from plC50 by the Cheng-Prusoff equation or<br>
calculated from Schild's analysis.<br>
SERT binding affinity has been determined in vitro by the compounds' ability to displace<br>
[3H]-citalopram from hSERT-LLCPK cell membranes. For the binding reaction, a final<br>
concentration of 0.25 nM of [3H] citalopram (84 Ci/mmol, Amersham) was incubated with<br>
3-5ug/ml of cell membrane and the compound to be tested at different concentrations (7<br>
concentration points in duplicate) in 50 mM Tris HCI, pH 7.7, containing 120 mM NaCI, 5<br>
mM KCI, 10uM pargyline and 0.1% ascorbic acid. The reaction was performed for 120 min<br>
at 22°C and was terminated through GF/B Unifilter (pre-soaked in 0.5 % PEI) using a Cell<br>
Harvester (Tomtec). Scintillation fluid was added to each filtered spot and radioactivity<br>
was determined using a scintillation counter (TopCount (Packard)). Non-specific binding<br>
was determined using paroxetine (10uM) and represents about 2-5% of the total binding.<br>
Competition experiments were conducted with duplicate determination for each point.<br>
Msat601 software package was used to elaborate the competition binding data. IC60<br>
values were converted to KI values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation and by using the KD<br>
of [3H]citalopram determined in separate experiments.<br>
For preferred compounds of the invention, the inhibitory activity of the compounds at the<br>
human serotonin transporter (hSERT) has been determined in vitro using porcine LLCPK<br>
cells (ATCC.) stably transfected with the hSERT (hSERT-LLCPK). The cells have been<br>
plated onto 96-well plates (10000 cells/well). After 24 hr, cells have been washed in<br>
uptake buffer (Hank's balanced salt solution + 20 mM Hepes) and pre-incubated for 10<br>
minutes at 30°C with 50 ul of buffer containing the test compounds. 50 pi of 50 nM [3H]<br>
Serotonin (5-HT) solution (final concentration: 25 nM [3H] 5-HT) have been added and<br>
plates have been incubated for 7 min at 30°C, during which cells take up radiolabelled 5-<br>
HT. Aspirating the solution and rapidly washing the cells with cold buffer has terminated<br>
the uptake. The amount of radioactive 5-HT incorporated in the cells has then been<br>
measured by adding the scintillation cocktail directly onto the cells and reading the plate in<br>
the Top Count. The data have been digitally processed to obtain the plC50 values of the<br>
uptake inhibitors.<br>
The action of the compounds of the invention at the NK-j receptor and/or serotonin<br>
transporter may be determined by using conventional animal models.<br>
Thus, the ability to bind at the N«i receptor and/or serotonin transporter was determined<br>
using the guinea pig pup isolation calls model as described by Pettijohn, Psychol. Rep.,<br>
1979 and Rupniak et al., Neuropharmacology, 2000.<br>
The anti-anxiety activity obtained by the administration of a compound according to the<br>
invention can be demonstrated in the gerbil social interaction model, according to the<br>
method described by Cheeta et al. (Cheeta S. et at., 2001. Brain Research 915: 170-<br>
175).<br>

Compounds of formula (I) may be administered as the raw chemical but the active<br>
ingredient is preferably presented as a pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
Accordingly, the invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises at<br>
least one compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and<br>
formulated for administration by any convenient route. Such compositions are preferably<br>
in a form adapted for use in medicine, in particular human medicine, and can conveniently<br>

(including ophthalmic and nasal), depot or rectal administration or in a form suitable for<br>
administration by inhalation or insufflation (either through the mouth or nose).<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for<br>
example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g. pregelatinised maize starch,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g. lactose,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g. magnesium<br>
stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g. potato starch or sodium starch glycollate); or<br>

conventional manner.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by bolus<br>
injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit<br>
dosage form e.g. in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative.<br>
The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or<br>
aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilising<br>
and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for<br>
constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated for topical administration in the form<br>
of ointments, creams, gels, lotions, pessaries, aerosols or drops (e.g. eye, ear or nose<br>
drops). Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily<br>
base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Ointments for<br>
administration to the eye may be manufactured in a sterile manner using sterilised<br>
components.<br>
Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain<br>
one or more emulsifying agents, stabilising agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents,<br>
thickening agents, or colouring agents. Drops may be formulated with an aqueous or nonaqueous<br>
base also comprising one or more dispersing agents, stabilising agents,<br>
solubilising agents or suspending agents. They may also contain a preservative.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as<br>
suppositories or retention enemas, e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such<br>
as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be formulated as depot preparations. Such long<br>
acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or<br>
intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds of the<br>
invention may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobia materials (for<br>
example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly<br>
soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
For intranasal administration, the compounds of the invention may be formulated as<br>
solutions for administration via a suitable metered or unitary dose device or alternatively<br>
as a powder mix with a suitable carrier for administration using a suitable delivery device.<br>
A proposed dose of the compounds of the invention is 1 to about 1000mg per day. It will<br>
be appreciated that it may be necessary to make routine variations to the dosage,<br>
depending on the age and condition of the patient and the precise dosage will be<br>
ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. The dosage will also<br>
depend on the route of administration and the particular compound selected.<br>
Thus, for parenteral administration a daily dose will typically be in the range of 1 to about<br>
100 mg, preferably 1 to 80 mg per day. For oral administration a daily dose will typically<br>
be within the range 1 to 300 mg e.g. 1 to 100 mg.<br>

It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that it may be necessary to protect certain<br>
reactive substituents during some of the above procedures. Standard protection and<br>
deprotection techniques, such as those described in Greene T.W. Protective groups in<br>
organic synthesis, New York, Wiley (1981), can be used. Thus, for example when R ga is<br>
a nitrogen protecting group, example of suitable groups include alkoxycarbonyl e.g. tbutoxycarbonyl,<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl, arylsulphonyl e.g. phenysulphonyl or 2-<br>
trimethylsilylethoxymethyl . Carboxylic acid groups can be protected as esters. Examples<br>
of suitable hydroxy protecting reagents include acetic anhydride, benzoic anhydride or a<br>
trialkylsilyl chloride. Aldehyde or ketone groups can be protected as acetals, ketals,<br>
thioacetals or thioketals. Deprotection of such groups is achieved using conventional<br>
procedures well known in the art. For example, protecting groups such as tbutyloxycarbonyl<br>
may be removed using an acid such as hydrochloric or trifluroroacetic<br>
acid in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane, diethylether, isopropanol or mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
When a specific enantiomer of a compound of general formula (I) is required, this may be<br>
obtained for example by resolution of a corresponding enantiomeric mixture of a<br>
compound of formula (I) using conventional methods.<br>
Thus, for example, specific enantiomers of the compounds of formula (I) may be obtained<br>
from the corresponding enantiomeric mixture of a compound of formula (I) using chiral<br>
HPLC procedure.<br>
Alternatively, enantiomers of a compound of general formula (I) may be synthesed from<br>
the appropriate optically active intermediates using any of the general processes<br>
described herein.<br>
Thus, in a one embodiment of the invention the enantiomers of the compound of formula<br>
(I) may be prepared by reaction of a chiral amine (111) using any of the processes<br>
described above for preparing compounds of formula (I) from amine (111).<br>
The chiral amine (III) may be prepared from the corresponding racemic amine (III) using<br>
any conventional procedures such as salt formation with a suitable optically active acid<br>
such as for example di-p-toluoyl-D-tartaric acid, (S)-methoxyphenylacetic acid or di-ptoluoyl-<br>
L-tartaric acid, or using chiral HPLC procedure.<br>
In a further embodiment the enantiomers of the compound of formula (I) may be prepared<br>
by reaction of a chiral amine (XXVII) using any of the processes described above for<br>
preparing compounds of formula (I) from amine (XXVII).<br>
Where it is desired to isolate a compound of formula (I) as a salt, for example a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, this may be achieved by reacting a compound of<br>
formula (I) in the form of the free base with an appropriate amount of suitable acid and in<br>
a suitable solvent such as an alcohol (e.g. ethanol or methanol), an ester (e.g. ethyl<br>
acetate) or an ether (e.g. diethyl ether, tert-butylmethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran).<br>
