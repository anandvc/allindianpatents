The invention relates to an apparatus for reverse osmosis treatment of water pumped from a well by means of a hand pump. When water with excessive dissolved solids is pressurised through semi permeable membrane, the membrane rejects out most of the dissolved solids such as minerals because of lesser membrane hole dial when compared to ionic radius of the minerals, bacteria and other suspended particles. The resultant water will be 90% to 99% free of dissolved minerals and bacteria and the water becomes fit for drinking meeting WHO and ISI standards.<br>
In existing systems using reverse osmosis, water with dissolved impurities is pressurized with high pressure pump of pressure ranging fit&gt;m 3 Kg/cm2 to 70 Kg/ cm2 and passed through reverse osmosis membrane. The high pressure pump works with the help of electrically operated motor.<br>
In order to safe guard corrosion of the reverse osmosis membrane due to sealing caused by the raw water, certain chemicals have to be dosed into the pressurised water before the water is passed to the reverse osmosis membrane. The treated water coming out from reverse osmosis membrane should also be dosed with the help of dosing pumps with food grade chemicals in order to make them fit for drinking.<br>
The invention provides an apparatus for reverse osmosis treatment of water obtained from a well through a hand pump. No electric motor nor electrically operated pumps are used in this apparatus. All the work done by the high pressure pump and dosing pumps are done by three hydraulic pumps attached to the handle of the hand pump. The raw water through hand pump gets collected in a storage tank and is sucked by a first hydrous pump<br><br>
whose handle is attached to the handle of the hand pump. Thus when the handle of the hand pump attached to well such as a bore well, beach well and the like is operated continuously, the collected raw water from the hand pump and stored in a container is taken up by the first hydraulic pump and delivered with a pressure ranging from 3 Kg/Cm’ to 70 Kg/Cm into a reverse osmosis membrane unit and as a result the dissolved solids and the undissolved particles such as bacteria are removed to the extend of 90% to 99% to make the water into drinkable water. Water with total dissolved solids (TDS) level from 500 ppm to 80,000 ppm are converted into potable water having less than 500 ppm of TDS level with almost nil bacteria. The pressure of water devoured to reverse osmosis membrane unit is adjustable by adjusting the first hydraulic pump.<br>
In order to avoid the scaling and corrosion over the membrane due to the saline nature of the raw water, the raw water collected in the raw water tank is dosed with the required liquid chemicals by the operation of a second hydraulic pump which is also attached to the handle of the hand pump by means of a common shaft.<br>
In order to make the treated water fit for drinking the pH of the treated water is to be adjusted between 7.0 and 8.5. Since the pH of raw water of about 7.5 will be brought down to less than 7 by the reverse osmosis membrane treatment, the required pH range of drinking water between 7 and 8.5. is achieved by a third hydraulic pump which doses the food grade pH adjustment chemicals through the treated water pipe by attaching thirty hydraulic pump to the handle of the hand pump by means of a common shaft.<br><br>
Thus, by the operation of the handle of the hand pump, the three hydrous pumps are operated to perform the following duties simultaneously.<br>
1)	Raw water from a well such as a bore well or beach well is pumped into a raw water tank for delivering to reverse osmosis membrane unit.<br>
2)	The required scale cum corrosion inhibiting chemicals are dosed into the raw water tank before delivering to the reverse osmosis membrane unit.<br>
3)	The chemically treated raw water in the raw water tank is pressurised and deUvered to the reverse osmosis membrane unit at required pressure and gets treated.<br>
4)	The pH of the resultant treated water from the reverse osmosis membrane unit is corrected to the required level.<br>
Thus the invention provides an apparatus for reverse osmosis treatment of water obtained through a hand pump from a well said apparatus comprising a main shaft with one end being connected to handle of said hand pump and the other end being connected to shafts of three hydraulic pumps, inlet of the first hydraulic pump being connected to a raw water tank which receive raw water from the well through the hand pump outlet, the outlet of the first hydrae pump being connected through a reverse osmosis membrane module and provide potable water, the inlet of the second hydraulic pump being connected to a dosing chemical tank and the outlet of said second hydraulic pump being connected to the raw water tank, the inlet of the third hydrous pump being connected to a pH correcting solution containing tank for correcting the pH of the treated water and the outlet of the third hydraulic<br><br>
pump being connected to the outlet of the reverse osmosis membrane module to adjust the pH and obtain drinking water.<br>
The accompanying figure schematically shows the apparatus for reverse osmosis treatment of water obtained through a hand pump from a well according to the invention.<br>
The handle of a hand pump (1) provided to pump out water from a well is attached to one end of a shaft (2) and the other end of the said shaft (2) is attached to the shafts (3, 4, 5) of the hydraulic pumps (Pi, P2 and P3). When the handle (H) of tike hand pump is operated, the shafts (3, 4, 5) of hydraulic pumps (Pi, P2 and P3) are also operated. The inlet of first hydraulic pump (Pi) is connected to a raw water tank (6) to which water from the hand pump (1) is received. Water from the raw water tank (6) is pumped by the first hydraulic pump (Pi) whose outlet is connected to a reverse osmosis membrane module (9). The inlet of a second hydraulic pump (Pj) is connected to a dosing chemical tank (7) for treating the raw water in the raw water tank (6) before feeding to reverse osmosis membrane module (9). Reverse osmosis membrane modules are well known in the art and comprises a membrane filter to remove impurities from well water fed with pressure ranging from 3 kg/cm’ to 70 kg/cm’. The inlet of third hydraulic pump (P3) is connected to a pH correcting solution containing tank (8) and the outlet of the third hydraulic pump (P3) is connected to outlet of the reverse osmosis membrane module (9). The hydraulic pumps can be suitably selected and can also be adjusted to deliver optimum pressures depending upon the quality and quantity of the water from the well. The treated water from &amp;e outlet of the reverse osmosis module may have to be<br><br>
adjusted for pH. The drinking water should have a pH of 7.0 to 8.5. Since the reverse osmosis treatment generally brings down the pH to 7.0 or less the treated water requires pH correction. The inlet of the third hydraulic pump is connected to a dosing chemical tank (8) for feeding pH adjusting chemicals to the outlet of reverse osmosis membrane module (9) in order to obtain drinking water of required purity and pH. Preferably pressure guages (PGi, PG2 and PG3) may be provided at the outlet of the hydraulic pumps (Pi, P2 and P3) respectively. A pressure gauge (PG4) may also be provided before the drain outlet (10) for effective reactivation of the reverse osmosis membrane module (9). Preferably a volume water meter (11) may be provided at outlet of the reverse osmosis membrane module (9).<br>
The apparatus for reverse osmosis treatment of water obtained from a well through a hand pump according to the invention has the following advantages.<br>
1.	The apparatus requires no electric power and therefore it can be installed at remote places where there is no electricity.<br>
2.	It is possible to obtain drinking water in accordance with standards set by WHO from sources such as bore wells and beach wells by using the apparatus.<br>
3.	The operational cost of reverse osmosis membrane module is minimum in the absence of any electrically operated devices.<br>
4.	The apparatus is very cost effective and safe for operation at remote places.<br><br><br><br><br>
