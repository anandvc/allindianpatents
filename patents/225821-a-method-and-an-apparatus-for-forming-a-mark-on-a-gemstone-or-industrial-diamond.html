Forming a mark on a gemstone or industrial diamond<br>
The present invention relates to forming  a mark, preferably a micro mark, on a gemstone or industrial diamond. The term 'micro mark"as used herein is any very small mark on<br>
a gemstone or industrial diamond. The mark may be a recognisable commercial brand or trade mark,  such as the name or logo of a diamond jewellery retailer, trade orgaaisation. It is possible to apply the marks to industrial diamonds some of which(like wire-drawing dies) have polished surfaces, Nonetheless the invention is more applicable in the field of jewellery, the mark being applied to one of the facts of a gemstone, preferably the table. Various proposals have been made for forming on gemstones or industrial diamonds marks which are invisible to the naked eye; thus in the case of a gemstone, the mark can be on a facet which will be visible in a jewellery setting. In a strict sense, most viable procedures form the mark in (rather than on) the surface in that mark is formed by removal of material (termed milling). However the expressions such as "on the urface" as usedherein include such milling, in accordance with conventional  parlanoe.<br>
The depth of the mark primarily, is controlled so as to limit the visibility<br>
a level that does not detract from the sesthetic properties and hence value of the<br>
gemstone -specifically for diamonds, it is preferred that the mark be such<br>
not detract from the Internal clarity grade of the diamond. In general, the mark should<br>
be invisible to the naked eye. in the broadest sense, the mark should not detract from<br>
the beauty or aesthetic appearance of the gemstone. There are various standards, but the<br>
normal requirement is that internal defects be invisible under x10 magnification, by<br>
using the naked eye aided with a x10 loupe, although as tbe marking of diamonds<br>
becomes more popular, some visibility of the mark may be acceptable, particularly as<br>
the marks are not strictly internal defects. For example, marks occupying an area of up<br><br>
to 1 mm2 etched to a depth of 25 nm or 50 nm can be acceptable although visible under certain lighting conditions with x10 magnification. Much deeper marks up to 500nm deep, may also be acceptable. A minimum depth is about 20 or about 30 nm. however, it is prefered that on a gemstone the mark be shallow enough not to produce significant light scattering from any region. In WO 97/03846, there is a description of the dimensions of the marks that can be formed. The lines of which the marks are formed can have a width:depth ratio of say from about 20:1 to about 3000;1, but the preferred range is from  50:1 to 1000:1<br>
The marks can be formed in a any suitable manner. One way is to use microlithography,<br>
where the facet is is spin-cuated a resistor photoresist, and either an image of a mask<br>
Is projected onto the coated facet using an exposure radation which exposes the resist<br>
(normally a lens sytstem is used which substantially reduces the image size relative to<br>
the mask) or an image is written on the coated facet using<br>
writing). The resist is then developed to remove selected portions. In effect providing a<br>
contact mask on the facet. During development, the exposed and unexposed regions of the resist are developed at different rates  in a positive tone resist, it Is the exposed regions that dissolve more readily, leaving the surface or facet unmarked in the exposed regions. There is a detailed description of microlithography in Thompson et al. "Introduction to Microlithography", 2nd edition (1994). The gemstone or industrial diamond can then bemilled using instance plasma etching as disclosed in US 5344 526 or WO 98/52773. Another way is to use radiation white directly attacks the surface of the diamond or gemstone, either through a mask or written directly on the surface, for instance as disclosed in WO 97/03846.<br>
Background to the First Aspect of the invention<br>
When projecting the mask image onto tbe surface of the gemstone or industrial diamond the operator must align the mark, for example to tbe centre of the table of the gemstone and it may be desired to orient the mark so that for example in the mark is parallel to one of the edges of the surface. Furthermore, the focus of the exposure image must be set.<br><br>
US 6 016 185 describes in arrangement for manufacturing semi-conducters<br>
micromechanical devices by projecting a array of masks using a tiling techniqe in<br>
which the image must be the same sizeas the mask. It is possible to use to use   bi-directional optical path for imaging an alignment mark on the workpiece on the bottom surface of<br>
the mask. The image is in an inconvenient location for fine focusing, and the arrangenent could not be used if there were demagnifiction.<br>
It is an object of this aspect of the present iaventionto overcome or ameliorates at least one of the disadvantage, of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.<br><br>
According to the first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method as claimed in claim 1 or 38 and apparatus as claimed in claim 22 or 39. The dependant claims claim prefered and/or optional features.<br>
	•<br>
The first aspect of the invention can be used with one of two different ways of forming the mark on the gemstones or diamond/namely by projecting their image of a mask<br>
the gemstone or diamond or onto a resist thereon, or by writing on the gemstone or diamond or resist by scanning or moving a beam such as a laser beam (direct beam<br>
writing). In each way, the exposing  radiation can expose a resist for later etching, or can directly attack the surface of the gemstone or diamond. Direct beam writing has the advantage that different patterns can be produced in the resist without the need to     . prepare a projection mask for each thus allotving e.g. serial numbers or a selection of marks to be produced on the diamond. However, the setting-up image is preferably<br>
projected through a mask.<br>
The use of the setiing-up image provides a simple way of locating (registration) and orientating the exposure image. Furthermore, the use of the setting-up image provides a good way of focusing the exposure image, for instance when projecting the image of a mask using visible or ultraviolet light The operator may alter the position of the<br><br>
gemstone or industrial diamond relative to the focal place usisg mechanical adjustments. If the setting-up image is projected through an objective lens or lens system and is senesed throughthe objective lens or lens system, the apparent error in<br>
focus 10 doubled because the setting-up radiation is reflected back through the objective lens or lenses and bence travels a distance equal to twice the error in focus; this exaggeration of the focus error enables the focus to be set very accurately and easily. However, it is possible to insert say a beam splitter between the objective lens or leas system and the gemstone or diamond and sense the image without it passing through the primary objective lens or lens system.<br>
In carrying out the method, the asetting-up image may be sensed by an electrode image detector using any suitable wavelength for the setting-up radiation, or if the setting-up radiation is in the visible range, the setting-up image can be viewed by eye. Thus the exposure region of a mask may define a shape corresponding to that of the micro mark to be formed or may define alignment marks to assist in the accurate location of the exposure image on the stone. Alternatively, if the exposure radiation is scanned, such as in the case of a laser beam, the exposure radiation can be scanned through the exposure region, carrying out direct beam writing. In theory It would be possible to have the alignment region transparent or have no mask at all and the setting-up radiation also scanned.<br>
Background to the Second Aspect of the Invention<br>
When applying micromarks to a gemstone or industrial diamond, it is desirable, particularly in the case of gemstones, to be  able to apply unique serial number. However, if a projection mask is being used, this can introduce signiflcant expense because different masks are required tbr each stone.<br>
It is as object of this aspect of the present invention to overcome or ameltorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art or to provide a useful alternative.<br><br>
The Second Aspect of the invention<br>
According to the second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method as claimed in Caim 19 and apparatus as claimed in Claim 33. The dependant claims claim preferred and/or optional featurs.<br>
The second aspect of the invention provides a very simple way of marking differing marks on successive gemstones, particularly when marking serial numbers.<br>
Preffered Embodiments<br>
The invention will be further described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is  a schematic section illustrating a method of setting a gemstone to form a dop;<br>
Figure 2 is schmatic optical diagram, illustrating a method of forming a mark on a<br>
gemstone by microlithography; and<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a suitable setting-up mask for the optional system of Figure 2.<br>
Figure I shows part of an injection moulding tool having a body 1. An annular<br>
(circular)dop ring 2 having injection gates 3 is placed in a recess 1a in the body 1.	A<br>
centralising pin 4 which Is upwardly spring-loaded passes up the centre of the recess la. and carries a non-metallic insert 5 having a central bore 6. Initially, the position of the centralising pin 4 will be higher than that shown is Figure I. Suction is applied to the central bore 6 and A diamond 7 shown as having its table 7a uppermost is placed on the top of the insert 5. A top plate 8 is closed over the cavity, pushing the diamond 7<br><br>
downwards and causing the lower surface of the plates to engage and level the table 7a. the vacuum is disconnected from the central duct 6. the centralising pin 4 is then locked in position and a flexible elstomer 9 such as elastron G 1047 is injection moulded through a main  gate 10 and into the space between the inner wall of the ring 2 the diamond7 the insert 5 and the centralising pin 4. one gate 3 of the dop ring 2 registers with the main gate 10 whilst the other gate 3 registers with a duct leading to a dump 1b. When the elastomer 9 has set, the top plate 8 is removed, the centralising pin 4 pushes upwards the dop 11 formed by the ring 2 and the elaatozner 9, and the dop 11 can be pulled of the top of centralising pin4. If rubber has leaked past the culet of the diamond 7 info the duet 6, the Insert 5 will come away with the 11 and can be ripped out.<br>
The diamond 7 can now be cleaned, for Instance by mechanical cleaning with swabs moistened in alcohol or fay drawing the diamond 7 and dop 11 across a proprietary optical lens cleaning tissue or the like. Altenatively, the dop 11 may be mounted on a vacuum chock and rotated about an axis preferably perpendicular to the tablle diamond 7. In this case a solvent can be applied, followed by spin drying, mechanical cleaning and any other suitable technique.<br>
Resist Coating<br>
If the facet is to be etched by microlithography the dop 11 can be mounted an a vacuum chuk and rotated about the veritoal axis which is perpendicular to and passes through<br>
the table 7a of the diamond 7. If a  plurality of diamonds 7 have been set in the dop 11, the axis should be approximately through the centre line of the dop 11.<br>
Photoresist is applied to cover at least the table 7a of the diamond 7. A suitable positive-tone resist material is Microposit 1818, manufactured by the Shipley Company, which is a diazonapbtboqninone/volak resist The chuck with the dop 11 and stone 7 are rotated at high speed, typically 4000 to 8000 r.p.m., for a period of typically 15 to 30<br><br>
seconds. This result in a film of resist of uniform thickness over the greater part of the diamond table 7s, of typically one to two microns. If the top surface is continuous across the diamond table 7a, the surface of the setting material 2 and the tops of the sidewalls 5 of the dop 11, no bead or rim would be formed on the diamond table 7a.<br>
The resist is then baked. Typical will be one minute at 115oC. This can be done by placing the dop 25 on a peltier device with the culet 12 of the diamond pool  of liquid solder contained in the device tip, Altemative, the beating effect may be produced by a hotplate, inductive heating, a heating element incorporated in the dop 11, steam or liquid solder circulated over the culet 12, infre-red radiation oa the table 7s, or in any other suitable way. The temperature of the dop 11 may be measured by thermocouple or the like mounted in the dop 11 or in contact with it,and this measurement can control the heating means to regulate the temperature. Alternatively, the temperature may be measured and controlled through the Peltier device.<br>
After baking, tbe source of heat is discontinued and the dop 11 quickly cooled, e.g. using the Peltier device as a cooler. Tbe diamond 7 is now ready for exposure of the<br>
resist<br>
The dop 11 is placed on a borizirmtal platen of suitable microlithography equipment for<br>
cxposing the resist in a pattern corresponding to the mark to be formed, for instance by projecting a mask onto the table 7a with a reduction (de-magnification) of x10. The location, orientation and focus of the  exposure image are adjusted as appropriate, the table 7s being maintained strictly parallel to and a strictly determined height above the platen of the equipment, In an altenativc arrangement, the dop 11 can be held up against a downwards-facing register surface provided with an opening through which the table 7a can be iradised In this alternative, the underside of the dop ring 2 need<br><br>
not be strictly parallel to and a  predetermined distance below the reference place formed by the top of the dop ring 2.<br>
Any suitable radiation may be used forexposing the resist. For the Microposit 1818<br>
resist, electromagnetic radiation in the wavelenghth range of 350 to 450 nm is suitable. Shorter wavelengths allow higher resolution pattening. The exposure may be with a single wavelength, for instance the mercury discharge lamp G-line at 436 nm, or with a band of wavlengths,  for example with a filtered tungstem/halogen lamp.<br>
it may be disirable to subject the resist to a post-exposure bake. A process of diffusion<br>
reduces the influence of standing waves or interference fringes in the resist.	The<br>
procedure is similar to that of tbe pre-exposure babe described above,<br>
Development of the resist can be conventional. The apparatus used in may be similar to<br>
the resist spinner described above.<br><br>
Plasma etching equipment may be obtained from for instance oxford Plasma Technology (UK) or South Bay Technology (USA). DC discharge etching may be used but it is  prefered to use a radio frequency plasma avoid problems with the diamond charging. Reactive ioo etching is preferred, tbe diamond being mounted on the driven electrode of the etcher rather than on the earth electrode. In one example, the diamond develops a negative bies potential relative to the plasma of eg 100 to 1000 volts. The biombardrent with energetic ions from the plasma may cause a partial conversion of the unreactive diamond allotrope of carbon to more reactive forms such as graphite. Pure oxygen or an oxygen/argon mixture or air can be supplied to oxidise the graphite. The preferred plasma is 75%  argon and 25% oxygen, though alternatively a pure oxygen etch<br><br>
could be used, followed by a pure argen  etch to remove surface-terminating oxygen<br>
Release<br>
The diamond 7 is pushed out of the dop 11 and cleaned to remove the resist<br>
Figure 2 shows the optical system of one arrangement for exposing the resist. The<br>
diamond 7 is in the dop 11 with a locating surface defined by the underside of the dop<br>
ring2. The upper surface of the platen or table 30 forms an up-wards facing register<br>
surface. In this way, the table 7a of the diamond 7 is securately  positioned parallel to<br>
the table 30. The mark could be formed at the centre of the table 7a or at the edge of the<br>
table 7a. The dop 11 can slide across the table 30 and can thus be a adjusted maually, or<br>
the posilion and rotation of the table 30 can be adjusted<br>
The optical system has a setting-up/exposure radiation sources (or sources) 31, a setting-up/exposure apertwe stop 32, an exposure shutter 33, a setting-up/exposure field lens 34, a setting-up/exposure mask 35, a first beam splitter 36, a second beam splitter 37, an objective lens 38, an illumination radiation source 39, an illumination radiation aperture stop 40, an illumination radiation filter 41, an illumination radiation field lens 42, an illumination radiation field stop 43 and an observation plans 44. The objective lens  38 forms an image of the mask 35 set the focal plane 45. It is desirable  but not essential that the objective less 38 has the same local length for  both aretting-up exposure wavelengths and has good aberration correction for both the setting-up and exposure radiation wavelengths.<br>
The source 31 is preferably an incandescent lamp such as a tungsten halogen lamp or a discharge lamp such as a mercury, or xenon or metal halide arc lamp. Pulsed light sources such as a xenon flash lamp, or light emitting diodes or laser sources, may alternatively be employed. The radiation may be conveyed to point 31 by a fibre optic<br>
guide, a liquid light guide and/or associated condenser lenses and mirrors. In order to<br><br><br>
locate, orientate and focus the image on the table 7a of the diamond reference plane 45) the diamond 7 is preferably illuminated by means of the illuminated source 39, which provides uniform background lighting so that the whole of the diamond 7 can be seen (though with some types of setting-up radiation, the illumination may not be necessary). The wavelength of the illumination source 39 must be such that the radiation does not affect the resist  for instance, a light having a wavelength greater than 500 nm can be used. the illumination filter 41 ensures that the resist is not exposed The radiation source 31 is then switched to setting-up radiation. The radiation source 31 may comprise two different ligbt sources, one for setting-up and one for exposure, in which case the exposure shutter 33 may not be required, the light sources being controlled appropreately. Alternatively,if the source 31 emits both the setting-up and the exposure radiation, the exposure shutter 33 can be incorporated such that when it is closed, it provides a filter to block the exposure radiation while transmitting the  setting-up radiation. The exposure shutter 33 can be located anywhere in the radiation path, and may be incorporated in the source 3l or in the mask 35. The setting-up radiation provides the setting-up ixnage of the mask 35 on the table 7a of the diamond 7. Normally, the optical sytem substantially reduces the image size relative to the mask. The setting-up (and exposure) image can be reduced by about 90 per cent (x10 reduction) oompared to the mask 35. In general, the reduction is preferably from about x10 to about x20 or up to about x100. However lower reductions from about x2 or about x4 upwards, are possible. Viewing the setting-up image by eye at the observation  plane 44 (which can be the reticule plane of a microscope eye piece), the setting-up image is located in the correct position on the diamond table 7a and correctly orientated (by moving the diamond or alternatively by moving the mask 35) and is then focused mechanically. However, as an alternative, an electronic imaging detector such as a CCD camera may be located at the observation plane 44 and the setting-up image can then be viewed on a screen. By using the first beam splitter 36, the observation plane 44, where the setting-up image is sensed, is outside the optical path which is followed by the setting-up radiation before it reaches the diamond 7.<br>
The setting-up radiation does not affect the facet of the gemstone in such a way that a mark is formed - for Instance, if photolitbography is being used, the setting-up radiation<br><br>
must not expose the resist. For t.he Microposit 1818 resist refered to above, the setting up radiation can be green  or yellow  light in the wavelenghth range 500 to 550 nm,  i,e, in the same range as the illuminating radiation. In general if its intensity is sufficiently low, much lower than that of the exposure radiation, the setting-up radiation could be the same as the exposure radiation. However, the setting-up end illumination radiations are  prfrerably of different  wavelengths, to provide contrast. thus the setting-up radiation can be red light of a wavelength greater than 630 nm, depending on the chromatic aberration of the lens system. The setting-up, exposure and illuminatios    radiations may each comprise a band of wavelenghths.<br>
Once the location, oneotation and focus are set, the radiation source 31 is switchedto the exposure radiation, or the exposure shutter 33 is opened for a predetermined time. The exposure radiation exposes the resist<br>
The exppsure field lens 34 ensures even illumination of the mask 35 by directing an image of the exposure aperture stop 32 into the entrance pupil of the oobjective lens 38, though other arrangements can be used to the same effect. By altering the size of the exposure aperture stop 32, the spatial coherence of the illumination may be controlled, thus altering the quality of the image produced.<br>
The objective lens 38 may be a well-corrected microscope objective of eg x10 or x20 magnification, but other types of lenses, including those incorporating reflective dements, may be used instead. The objective lens 38 may have a field of view which is too small to allow the entire diamond table 78 to be observed. If so,afurther objective lens of lower power, such as x5 magnification, can be incorporated, with a suitable mechanism such as a microscope turret for moving it in and out of the light path.<br>
If desired, a second lens (not shown) may be placed between the exposure mask 35 and the first beam splitter 36 so as to pass parrallel light through the beam splitters 36,37 and thus achieve better optical performance in the beam splitters 36,37.<br><br>
A sensor, such as a silicon pbotodiode, may be incocporated to measure the amount of exposure radiation incident on the diomond table 7a, for setting the exposure time to give a predetermined exposure dose.<br>
The exposure mask 35 may be in the form of a glass disc or  photographic film with a substantially  opaque coatiog or film with clear regions formed where the made is to be formed, if a positive tone resist is employed. If a negative tone resist is employed, the contrast is reserved. Because the image mask is reduced in size, the effect of the grain size of the film is reduced so that it is insignificant in the image<br>
The mask 35 shown  by way of  example is for forming on a diamond<br>
1234" and has algnment features for alignment on a  a corner<br>
Black lines are parts that transmit radiation. The edge of the table 7a is indicated with dot-dash lines. The 'T£ST 1234" feature trassnuts at least the exposure radiation.<br>
Alignment lines 51,52,53 and alignment curves 54, 55 transmit the sacting-up radiation but not the exposure radiation. The alignment lines and curves 51-55 can be produced by an LCD (liquid crystal display)forming part of the mask 35 .    As an alternative, one can use a graticule in the observation plane 44, for cxample a microscope  eyepiece cross-hair graticule if the maik if to be in the cente of the diamond table 7a.<br>
With the settiog-up) image on the diamond table 7a, the TEST 1234"feature is focused using a standard focusing arrangement (not shown). A corner of the table 7a is then placed on the line 97 and is coved manually up towards the centre of the image. Standard x and y direction micrometer adjustments can be provided fbr fine adjustment of the image in relation to the diamond table 7a. If the diamond 7 has a regular octagonal table 7a..with  crner angles of 135o, the edges of the table 7a are aligned with the lines 51,53; the settting-up image  is then properly located and orientated. If the diamond does not have a 135o corner angle, the edges of the table 7a can be brought into<br><br>
contact with the curves 54, 55 with  the come on the line 52 or on  an extension of the  line 52.<br>
The exposure mask 35 may be changed between exposures so that for example serial<br>
numbers may be  printed. This change may be using a sequence of<br>
pbotographic imagei as umh, or alternatjvely the exposure mask 35 may be adjustable<br>
(changeable at will), so that its mask effect is likewise changeable at will.	In this way<br>
successive diamonds 7 can have different  exposure images projected onto them and can have different marks formed on them. The mask may incorporate movable  or changeable elements in the form of  numbers or Individual pixels that may be adjusted Thus the mask 35 can comprisee at least a zone formed by a spatial light modulator or individual  pixels whose masking effect is changeable at will. Devices such as liquid crystal light  valves or a liquid crystal spatial light modulator(which may need a polariser) or micro-mirror arrays (which need to be very stable but have no requirment for polarised light and the consequential loss) may be associated with the exposure mask 35. Such devices need not be located physically in the plane occupied by the exposure mask 35 in that an imaging lens system may be used to form an image of the device in the plane of the exposure mask 35. If a micro-mirror array or other reflective type of mask is used, the illumination system  31-34 will have to be configured to illuminate the mask in reflection. As an example of changing changing the masking effect, in the illustration of Figure 3, the word "TEST" can form a permanant part of the mask 35 and the figures "1234" a serial number which advances for each diamond 7 marked.<br>
The setting-up radiation and/or the exposure radiation may be scanned onto the diamond table 7a, instead of using a physical mask, the scanners being controlled by a programmable device such as a computer. In general, it may be preferred to scan the exposure ladiation but to use  a mask for the setting-up radiation, in which case the mask may be transparent to the exposure radiation but opaque to the setting-up radiation except where it is cm away to provide a setting-up image, for instance providing<br><br>
location, aligmnent orientation and focusing pattern. In this case, the actual pattern to be marked is not used for the setting-up and special alignment narks are used<br>
