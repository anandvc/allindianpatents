FOR A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
I. Claim of Priority under 35 U. S. C. ยง119<br>
[0001] The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application<br>
Serial No. 60/607,371, entitled "Steering Diversity with Space-Time Transmit Diversity<br>
for a Wireless Communication System," filed September 3, 2004, and Provisional<br>
Application Serial No. 60/608,226, entitled "Steering Diversity with Space-Time and<br>
Space-Frequency Transmit Diversity Schemes for a Wireless Communication System,"<br>
filed September 8, 2004, both assigned to the assignee hereof and expressly<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
II. Field<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates generally to communication, and more specifically<br>
to techniques for transmitting data in a multiple-antenna communication system.<br>
III. Background<br>
[0003] A multi-antenna communication system employs multiple (NT) transmit<br>
antennas and one or more (NR) receive antennas for data transmission. The NT transmit<br>
antennas may be used to increase system throughput by transmitting different data from<br>
the antennas or to improve reliability by transmitting data redundantly.<br>
[0004] In the multi-antenna communication system, a propagation path exists between<br>
each pair of transmit and receive antennas. NT-NR different propagation paths are<br>
formed between the NT transmit antennas and the NR receive antennas. These<br>
propagation paths may experience different channel conditions (e.g., different fading,<br>
multipath, and interference effects) and may achieve different signal-to-noise-andinterference<br>
ratios (SNRs). The channel responses of the NT-NR propagation paths may<br>
thus vary from path to path, and may further vary over time for a time-variant wireless<br>
channel and across frequency for a dispersive wireless channel. The variant nature of<br>
the propagation paths makes it challenging to transmit data in an efficient and reliable<br>
manner.<br>
[0005J Transmit diversity refers to redundant transmission of data across space,<br>
frequency, time, or a combination of these dimensions to improve reliability for the data<br>
transmission. One goal of transmit diversity is to maximize diversity for the data<br>
transmission across as many dimensions as possible to achieve robust performance.<br>
Another goal is to simplify the processing for transmit diversity at both a transmitter and<br>
a receiver.<br>
[0006] There is therefore a need in the art for techniques to transmit data with transmit<br>
diversity in a multi-antenna communication system.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] Techniques for transmitting data using a combination of transmit diversity<br>
schemes are described herein. These transmit diversity schemes include spatial<br>
spreading, continuous beamforming, cyclic delay diversity, space-time transmit<br>
diversity (STTD), space-frequency transmit diversity (SFTD), and orthogonal transmit<br>
diversity (OTD), all of which are described below.<br>
[0008] In an embodiment, a transmitting entity processes (e.g., encodes, interleaves, and<br>
symbol maps) one or more (No) data streams to generate ND data symbol streams. The<br>
transmitting entity further processes the ND data symbol streams based on a transmit<br>
diversity scheme (e.g., STTD, SFTP, or OTD) to generate multiple (Nc) coded symbol<br>
streams. Hach data symbol stream may be sent as a single coded symbol stream or as<br>
multiple (e.g., two) coded symbol streams using STTD, SFTD, or OTD. The<br>
transmitting entity may perform spatial spreading on the NC coded symbol streams with<br>
different matrices to generate multiple (Mr) transmit symbol streams for transmission<br>
from NT antennas. Additionally or alternatively, the transmitting entity may perform<br>
continuous beamtbrming on the NT transmit symbol streams in either the time domain<br>
or the frequency domain. A receiving entity performs the complementary processing to<br>
recover the ND data streams.<br>
[0009] Various aspects and embodiments of the invention are described in further detail<br>
below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0014] The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an example, instance,<br>
or illustration." Any embodiment described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to<br>
be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments.<br>
[0015] The transmission techniques described herein may be used for multiple-input<br>
single-output (MISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmissions. A<br>
MISO transmission utilizes multiple transmit antennas and a single receive antenna. A<br>
MIMO transmission utilizes multiple transmit antennas and multiple receive antennas.<br>
[0016] The transmission techniques may be used for single-carrier and multi-carrier<br>
communication systems. A multi-carrier system may utilize orthogonal frequency<br>
division multiplexing (OFDM), some other multi-carrier modulation scheme, or some<br>
other construct. OFDM effectively partitions the overall system bandwidth into<br>
multiple (Np) orthogonal frequency subbands, which are also called tones, subcarriers,<br>
bins, frequency channels, and so on. With OFDM, each subband is associated with a<br>
respective subcarrier that may be modulated with data. A single-carrier system may<br>
utilize single-earner frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA), code division<br>
multiple access (CDMA), or some other single-carrier modulation scheme. An SCFDMA<br>
system may utilize (1) interleaved FDMA (IFDMA) to transmit data and pilot<br>
on subbands that are distributed across the overall system bandwidth (2) localized<br>
FDMA (LFDMA) to transmit data and pilot on a group of adjacent subbands, or (3)<br>
enhanced FDMA (EFDMA) to transmit data and pilot on multiple groups of adjacent<br>
subbands. In general, modulation symbols are sent in the time domain with SC-FDMA<br>
(e.g., IFDMA, LFDMA, and EFDMA) and in the frequency domain with OFDM. For<br>
clarity, much of the description below is for a system that utilizes OFDM, with all NF<br>
subbands being available for transmission.<br>
[0017] Transmit diversity may be achieved using various schemes including STTD,<br>
SFTD, OTD, spatial spreading, continuous beamforming, and so on. STTD transmits a<br>
pair of data symbols from two antennas on one subband in two symbol periods to<br>
achieve space and time diversity. SFTD transmits a pair of data symbols from two<br>
antennas on two subbands in one symbol period to achieve space and frequency<br>
diversity. OTD transmits multiple (No) data symbols from NO antennas on one subband<br>
in NO symbol periods using NO orthogonal codes to achieve space and time diversity,<br>
where N(! &gt; 2. As used herein, a data symbol is a modulation symbol for traffic/packet<br>
data, a pilot symbol is a modulation symbol for pilot (which is data that is known a<br>
priori by both the transmitting and receiving entities), a modulation symbol is a<br>
complex value for a point in a signal constellation for a modulation scheme (e.g., MPSK<br>
or M-QAM), a transmission symbol (e.g., an OFDM symbol) is a sequence of<br>
time-domain samples generated by a single-carrier or multi-carrier modulation scheme<br>
for one symbol period, and a symbol is typically a complex value.<br>
[0018] Spatial spreading refers to the transmission of a symbol from multiple transmit<br>
antennas simultaneously, possibly with different amplitudes and/or phases determined<br>
by a steering vector used for that symbol. Spatial spreading may also be called steering<br>
diversity, transmit steering, pseudo-random transmit steering, space-time scrambling,<br>
and so on. Spatial spreading may be used in combination with STTD, SFTD, OTD,<br>
and/or continuous beamforming to improve performance and/or to extend the normal<br>
operation of these transmit diversity schemes. For example, STTD normally transmits<br>
one data symbol stream from two antennas. Spatial spreading may be used with STTD<br>
to transmit more than one data symbol stream from more than two antennas<br>
simultaneously.<br>
[0019] Continuous beamforming refers to the use of different beams across the NF<br>
subbands. The beamforming is continuous in that the beams change in a gradual instead<br>
of abrupt manner across the subbands. Continuous beamforming may be performed in<br>
the frequency domain by multiplying the symbols for each subband with a beamforming<br>
matrix for that subband. Continuous beamforming may also be performed in the time<br>
domain by applying different cyclic delays for different transmit antennas. Timedomain<br>
continuous beamforming is also called cyclic delay diversity.<br>
[0020] Transmit diversity may be achieved using a combination of transmit diversity<br>
schemes. For example, transmit diversity may be achieved using a combination of<br>
STTD, SF1T3 or OTD with either spatial spreading or continuous beamforming. As<br>
another example, transmit diversity may be achieved using a combination of STTD,<br>
S.FTD, or OTD with both spatial spreading and cyclic delay diversity. For clarity, much<br>
of the following description assumes the use of STTD.<br>
[0021] FIG. 1 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of a multi-antenna transmitting<br>
entity 110, which may be part of an access point or a user terminal. An access point<br>
may also be called a base station, a base transceiver system, or some other terminology.<br>
A user terminal may also be called a mobile station, a wireless device, or some other<br>
terminology.<br>
[0022] Pot the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, transmitting entity 110 may use a<br>
combination of STTD, spatial spreading, and continuous beamforming for data<br>
transmission. A TX data processor 112 receives and processes ND data streams and<br>
provides NO data symbol streams, where ND &gt; 1. TX data processor 112 may process<br>
each data stream independently or may jointly process multiple data streams together.<br>
For example, TX data processor 112 may format, scramble, encode, interleave, and<br>
symbol map each data stream in accordance with a coding and modulation scheme<br>
selected for that data stream. A TX STTD processor 120 receives the ND data symbol<br>
streams, performs STTD encoding on zero, one, or multiple data symbol streams, and<br>
provides NC coded symbol streams, where Nc &gt; ND. In general, TX STTD processor<br>
120 may process any number of data symbol streams with STTD, SFTD, OTD, or some<br>
other transmit diversity scheme. Each data symbol stream may be sent as one coded<br>
symbol stream or multiple coded symbol streams, as described below.<br>
[0023] A spatial spreader 130 receives and multiplexes the coded symbols with pilot<br>
symbols, performs spatial spreading by multiplying the coded symbols and pilot<br>
symbols with different steering matrices, and provides NT transmit symbol streams for<br>
the NT transmit antennas, where NT &gt; Nc. Each transmit symbol is a complex value to<br>
be sent from one transmit antenna on one subband in one symbol period. NT modulators<br>
(MOD) 132a through 132nt receive the NT transmit symbol streams. For an OFDMbased<br>
system, each modulator 132 performs OFDM modulation on its transmit symbol<br>
stream and provides a stream of time-domain samples. Each modulator 132 may also<br>
apply a different cyclic delay for its antenna, as described below. NT modulators 132a<br>
through 132nt provide NT sample streams to NT transmitter units (TMTR) 134a through<br>
134nt, respectively. Each transmitter unit 134 conditions (e.g., converts to analog,<br>
amplifies, filters, and frequency upconverts) its sample stream and generates a<br>
modulated signal. NT modulated signals from NT transmitter units 134a through 134nt<br>
are transmitted from NT transmit antennas 136a through 136nt, respectively.<br>
[0024] Controller 140 controls the operation at transmitting entity 110. Memory 142<br>
stores data and/or program codes for transmitting entity 110.<br>
[0025] Transmitting entity 110 may transmit any number of data symbol streams with<br>
STTD and any number of data symbol streams without STTD, depending on the number<br>
of transmit and receive antennas available for data transmission. The STTD encoding<br>
for one data symbol stream may be performed as follows. For each pair of data symbols<br>
i'a and 5|, to be sent in two symbol periods, TX STTD processor 120 generates two<br>
vectors s, = [s, sb]T and s2 = [s^ - s * a ] T , where " * " denotes the complex conjugate<br>
and " 7 " denotes the transpose. Alternatively, TX STTD processor 120 may generate<br>
two vectors s, =[st -s^]T and s2 =[sb s*JT for the pair of data symbols ,sa and sb.<br>
For both STTD encoding schemes, each vector s,, for t = 1, 2, includes two coded<br>
symbols to be sent from NT transmit antennas in one symbol period, where NT &gt; 2.<br>
Vector BJ is sent in the first symbol period, and vector s2 is sent in the next symbol<br>
period. Each data symbol is included in both vectors and is thus sent in two symbol<br>
periods. The m-th coded symbol stream is formed by the m-th element of the two<br>
vectors S; and s,. For clarity, the following description is for the STTD encoding<br>
scheme with s, =|&gt;a sb]r and s2 =[sb -s*]r . For this STTD encoding scheme, the<br>
first coded symbol stream includes coded symbols sa and sb, and the second coded<br>
symbol stream includes coded symbols s\, and - s*.<br>
[0026] Table 1 lists four configurations that may be used for data transmission. An<br>
NDxNc configuration denotes the transmission of ND data symbol streams as NC<br>
coded symbol streams, where ND &gt; 1 and Nc &gt; ND. The first column identifies the<br>
four configurations. For each configuration, the second column indicates the number of<br>
data symbol streams being sent, and the third column indicates the number of coded<br>
symbol streams. The fourth column lists the ND data symbol streams for each<br>
configuration, the fifth column lists the coded symbol stream(s) for each data symbol<br>
stream, the sixth column gives the coded symbol to be sent in the first symbol period<br>
(t = 1) for each coded symbol stream, and the seventh column gives the coded symbol<br>
to be sen! in the second symbol period (t = 2) for each coded symbol stream. The<br>
number of data symbols sent in each 2-symbol interval is equal to twice the number of<br>
data symbol streams, or 2No. The eighth column indicates the number of transmit<br>
antennas required for each configuration, and the ninth column indicates the number of<br>
receive antennas required for each configuration.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [0027] As shown in Table 1, a data symbol stream may be sent as two coded symbol<br>
streams with STTD or one coded symbol stream without STTD. For the embodiment<br>
shown in Table 1, for each data symbol stream sent without STTD, the data symbol sent<br>
in the second symbol period (t = 2) is conjugated to match the conjugation performed<br>
on the data symbol stream(s) sent with STTD.<br>
[0028] For the 1x2 configuration, one data symbol stream is STTD encoded to<br>
generate two coded symbol streams. For each 2-symbol interval, vectors s, = [sa sb]T<br>
and s2 ~ [ -v* - s* |7 are generated with data symbols sa and 55. Vector S[ is transmitted<br>
from at least two transmit antennas in the first symbol period, and vector s2 is<br>
transmitted from the same antennas in the second symbol period. A receiving entity<br>
uses at least one receive antenna to recover the data symbol stream.<br>
[0029] For the 2x3 configuration, two data symbol streams are sent as three coded<br>
โขsymbol streams. The first data symbol stream is STTD encoded to generate two coded<br>
symbol streams. The second data symbol stream is sent without STTD as the third<br>
coded symbol stream. For each 2-symbol interval, vectors Si=[ja sb sc]7 and<br>
ยง2 = [Jb 'va st]T are generated with data symbols s&amp;, s\ยป sc and S&amp;, where sa and s\, are<br>
from the first data symbol stream, and sc and Sd are from the second data symbol stream.<br>
Vector s, is transmitted from at least three transmit antennas in the first symbol period,<br>
and vector s? is transmitted from the same antennas in the second symbol period. A<br>
receiving entity uses at least two receive antennas to recover the two data symbol<br>
streams.<br>
[0030] For the 2x4 configuration, two data symbol streams are sent as four coded<br>
symbol streams. Each data symbol stream is STTD encoded to generate two coded<br>
symbol streams. For each 2-symbol interval, vectors Si=[,sa sb sc sj' and<br>
s2 = [si โข ,y* s'A - 5* J T are generated with data symbols sa, s\ยป sc and sd, where sa and sb<br>
are from the first data symbol stream, and sc and s^ are from the second data symbol<br>
stream. Vector s, is transmitted from at least four transmit antennas in the first symbol<br>
period, and vector s2 is transmitted from the same antennas in the second symbol<br>
period. A receiving entity uses at least two receive antennas to recover the two data<br>
symbol streams.<br>
[0031] For the 3x4 configuration, three data symbol streams are sent as four coded<br>
symbol streams. The first data symbol stream is STTD encoded to generate two coded<br>
symbol streams. The second data symbol stream is sent without STTD as the third<br>
coded symbol stream, and the third data symbol stream is sent without STTD as the<br>
fourth coded symbol stream. For each 2-symbol interval, vectors s, =|&gt;a sb sc st]T<br>
and s2 - [si -s* s*d s*s]r are generated with data symbols ja. s\,, sc, Sd, se and Sf, where<br>
sa and ,?b are from the first data symbol stream, sc and sd are from the second data<br>
symbol stream, and se and Sf are from the third data symbol stream. Vector s, is<br>
transmitted from at least four transmit antennas in the first symbol period, and vector s2<br>
is transmitted from the same antennas in the second symbol period. A receiving entity<br>
uses at least three receive antennas to recover the three data symbol streams.<br>
[0032] Table 1 shows four exemplary configurations that may be used for data<br>
transmission, with each configuration having at least one data symbol stream sent with<br>
STTD. Other configurations may also be used for data transmission. A configuration<br>
may also use a combination of STTD, SFTD, and OTD.<br>
[0033] In general, any number of data symbol streams may be sent as any number of<br>
coded symbol streams from any number of transmit antennas, where ND &gt; 1, Nc &gt; ND,<br>
NT &gt; N,-., and NR &gt; ND. Each data symbol stream may or may not be encoded with<br>
STTD, SFTD, OTD, or some other transmit diversity scheme. Each data symbol stream<br>
may be sent as one coded symbol stream or multiple (e.g., two) coded symbol streams.<br>
[0034] The transmitting entity may process the coded symbols for spatial spreading and<br>
continuous beamforming, as follows:<br>
x,(fc) = B(*)-V(fc)-G(*)-s,(*), fort = 1,2, Eq (1)<br>
where s,(k) is an Ncxl vector with NC coded symbols to be sent on subband k in<br>
symbol period f,<br>
G(k) is an Nc x Nc diagonal matrix with NC gain values along the diagonal for<br>
the Nc coded symbols in s,(k) and zeros elsewhere;<br>
is an NT xNc steering matrix for spatial spreading for subband k;<br>
is an NTxNT diagonal matrix for continuous beamforming for subband<br>
k; and<br>
x,(ยฃ) is an NTxl vector with NT transmit symbols to be sent from the NT<br>
transmit antennas on subband k in symbol period t.<br>
[0035] Vector s, contains NC coded symbols to be sent in the first symbol period, and<br>
vector s2 contains NC coded symbols to be sent in the second symbol period. Vectors<br>
s, and s2 may be formed as shown in Table 1 for the four configurations in the table.<br>
[0036] Gain matrix G(/t) determines the amount of transmit power to use for each of<br>
the NC coded symbol streams. The gain matrix may be a function of subband index k,<br>
as shown in equation (1), or may be a function that is independent of index k. The total<br>
transmit power available for transmission may be denoted as Ptotal. In an embodiment,<br>
equal transmit power is used for the Nc coded symbol streams, and the diagonal<br>
elements of G(ยฃ) have the same value of^/P^/N,-,. In another embodiment, equal<br>
transmit power is used for the ND data symbol streams, and the NC gain values along the<br>
diagonal of G(k) are defined to achieve equal transmit power for the ND data symbol<br>
streams. The Nc gain values may or may not be equal depending on the configuration.<br>
As an example, for the 2x3 configuration, the first data symbol stream is sent as two<br>
coded symbol streams and the second data symbol stream is sent as one coded symbol<br>
stream. To achieve equal transmit power for the two data symbol streams, a 3x3 gain<br>
matrix G(fc) may include gain values of ^/Pto(al/4 , i/Ptota]/4 , and ^/P^j/2 along the<br>
diagonal for the three coded symbol streams. Each coded symbol in the third coded<br>
symbol stream is then scaled by yPtotal / 2 and is transmitted with twice the power as the<br>
other two coded symbols sent in the same symbol period. For both embodiments, the<br>
NC coded symbols for each symbol period may be scaled to utilize the maximum<br>
transmit power available for each transmit antenna. In general, the diagonal elements of<br>
G(&amp;) may be selected to utilize any amounts of transmit power for the Nc coded<br>
symbol streams and to achieve any desired SNRs for the ND data symbol streams. The<br>
power scaling for the NC coded symbol streams may also be achieved by scaling the<br>
columns of the steering matrix V(ยฃ) with appropriate gains.<br>
[0037] A given data symbol stream (which is denoted as {s}) may be sent as one coded<br>
symbol stream (which is denoted as {?}) in various manners. In one embodiment, the<br>
gain matrix G(k) contains ones along the diagonal, and coded symbol stream {?} is<br>
transmitted at the same power level as other coded symbol streams. For this<br>
embodiment, data symbol stream {s} is transmitted at lower transmit power than an<br>
STTD encoded data symbol stream and hence achieves a lower received SNR at the<br>
receiving entity. The coding and modulation for data symbol stream {s} may be<br>
selected to achieve the desired performance, e.g., the desired packet error rate. In<br>
another embodiment, each data symbol in data symbol stream {s} is repeated and<br>
transmitted in two symbol periods. As an example, for the 2x3 configuration, data<br>
symbol sc may be sent in two symbol periods, then data symbol sa may be sent in two<br>
symbol periods, and so on. This embodiment may achieve similar received SNRs for<br>
the ND data symbol streams, which may simplify the coding and modulation at the<br>
transmitting entity and the demodulation and decoding at the receiving entity.<br>
[0038] Steering matrix V(&amp;) spatially spreads the Nc coded symbols for each symbol<br>
period such that each coded symbol is transmitted from all NT transmit antennas and<br>
achieves spatial diversity. Spatial spreading may be performed with various types of<br>
steering matrices, such as Walsh matrices, Fourier matrices, pseudo-random matrices,<br>
and so on, which may be generated as described below. The same steering matrix V(fe)<br>
is used for the two vectors Sj(fc) and s2(Jt) for each subband k. Different steering<br>
matrices may be used for different subbands and/or different time intervals, where each<br>
time interval may span an integer multiple of two symbol periods for STTD.<br>
[0039] Matrix B(fc) performs continuous beamforming in the frequency domain. For<br>
an OFDM-based system, a different beamforming matrix may be used for each subband.<br>
The beamforming matrix for each subband k may be a diagonal matrix having the<br>
following form:<br>
where ยฃ.(&amp;) is a weight for subband k of transmit antenna i. The weight bt(k) may be<br>
defined as:<br>
j (k) = e-J**WM-*f i for i = 1,.... NT and fc = 1,.... NF , Eq (3)<br>
where AT, is the time delay on transmit antenna i;<br>
A/ is the frequency spacing between adjacent subbands; and<br>
l(k) โข A/ is the actually frequency corresponding to subband index k.<br>
For example, if NF =:64, then subband index k may go from 1 to 64, and l(k) may be<br>
equal to k - 33 and may range from -32 to +31. If the overall system bandwidth is 20<br>
MHz and NF = 64, then A/ = 20 MHz / 64 = 3.125 kHz. l(k) โข A/ provides the actual<br>
frequency (in Hertz) for each value of k. The weights b,(k) shown in equation (3)<br>
correspond to a progressive phase shift across the NF total subbands for each transmit<br>
antenna, with the phase shift changing at different rates for the NT transmit antennas.<br>
These weights effectively form a different beam for each subband.<br>
[0040] Continuous beamforming may also be performed in the time domain as follows.<br>
For each symbol period, an Np-point inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) or<br>
inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) may be performed on NF transmit symbols to be<br>
sent on Np subbands of each transmit antenna i to generate NF time-domain samples for<br>
that transmit antenna. The NF time-domain samples for each transmit antenna z may be<br>
cyclically or circularly delayed by T,. For example, Tf may be defined as:<br>
T; =(i-'!)โข AT, for z = l,...,NT, where AT may be equal to one sample period, a<br>
fraction of a sample period, or more than one sample period. The time-domain samples<br>
for each antenna are then cyclically delayed by a different amount.<br>
[0041] In equation (1), the scaling by the gain matrix G(fe) may be omitted by setting<br>
jG(fe) = 1, the spatial spreading may be omitted by setting V(fc) = I, and the continuous<br>
beamforming may be omitted by setting B(ife) = I, where I is the identity matrix<br>
containing ones along the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. The transmitting entity may<br>
thus selectively perform scaling, spatial spreading, and continuous beamforming by<br>
using appropriate matrices. The matrices for spatial spreading and continuous<br>
beamforming may also be combined as VB(fc) = B(&amp;) โข V(&amp;). The matrices for scaling,<br>
spatial spreading, and continuous beamforming may also be combined as<br>
YBG(/c) = ยง(&amp;)โข V(/c)-G(fc). The transmitting entity may then perform spatial<br>
processing on data vector s,(fc) with VB(ifc) or YBO(fc).<br>
[0042] The transmitting entity may also use a combination of SFTD, spatial spreading,<br>
and possibly continuous beamforming. For SFTD, the transmitting entity may generate<br>
two vectors s4 and s2 as described above for STTD and may send these vectors on two<br>
subbands in one symbol period. For the 1x2 configuration, two vectors s, = [sa sb]T<br>
and s2 -โข [si - s*a]' may be generated for each pair of data symbols to be sent on two<br>
subbands in one symbol period for one data symbol stream. For the 2x3 configuration,<br>
two data symbol vectors ยงj = [sa sb sc]T and s2 = [s^ -s* s"A]T may be generated for<br>
two pair of data symbols to be sent on two subbands in one symbol period for two data<br>
symbol streams. For the 2x4 configuration, two vectors s, =[5a sb sf SA]T and<br>
ยง2 = iX - sl sd - s*]r may be generated for two pairs of data symbols to be sent on<br>
two subhands in one symbol period for two data symbol streams. For the 3x4<br>
configuration, two vectors s,-^:, sb sc se ] T and s2=[X -s* s'A s"f]T may be<br>
generated for three pair of data symbols to be sent on two subbands in one symbol<br>
period for three data symbol streams. For all configurations, the transmitting entity may<br>
spatially spread and transmit vector s, on one subband in one symbol period and may<br>
spatially spread and transmit vector s2 on another subband in the same symbol period.<br>
The two subbands are typically adjacent to one another.<br>
[0043] The transmitting entity may also use a combination of OTD, spatial spreading,<br>
and possibly continuous beamforming. For OTD, the transmitting entity may generate<br>
multiple (N0) vectors Sj and sNo and may send these vectors on one subband in N0<br>
symbol periods. For N0 = 2, the transmitting entity may generate two vectors Sj and<br>
s2 for two data symbols ja and s\, by (1) multiplying data symbol sa with a first<br>
orthogonal code of {+1 +1} to generate two coded symbols sa and sa for one transmit<br>
antenna, (2) multiplying data symbol Sb with a second orthogonal code of (+1 -1} to<br>
generate two coded symbols s\, and -m, for another transmit antenna, and (3) forming<br>
s, = Oa i'b]7 and s2 = [sa - s J T. In general, NO data symbols may be multiplied with<br>
NO different orthogonal codes to generate NO coded symbol sequences for NO transmit<br>
antennas. Each coded symbol sequence contains NO coded symbols and is generated by<br>
multiplying one data symbol with a specific orthogonal code of length N0. The<br>
orthogonal codes may be Walsh codes, OVSF codes, and so on,<br>
[0044] In general, transmit diversity may be achieved in various manners and in the<br>
time, frequency and/or spatial domains. In one embodiment, transmit diversity is<br>
achieved by multiplying vector s,(k) with steering matrix V(fc) to generate transmit<br>
vector x, ( k ) , as shown in equation (1). In another embodiment, transmit diversity is<br>
achieved by cyclically delaying the time-domain samples for each transmit antenna. In<br>
yet another embodiment, transmit diversity is achieved with a combination of spatial<br>
processing with V(fc) and cyclic delay of the time-domain samples. For all of the<br>
embodiments, vector s,(k) may be formed with STTD, SFTD, OTD, or some other<br>
transmit diversity scheme.<br>
[0045] FIG. 2 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of TX data processor 112, TX<br>
STTD processor 120, and spatial spreader 130 at transmitting entity 110. For the<br>
embodiment shown in FIG. 2, TX data processor 112 includes ND data stream<br>
2lOa through 2lOnd that independently process the ND data streams. Within<br>
each data stream processor 210, an encoder 212 encodes traffic data in accordance with<br>
a coding scheme and generates code bits. The encoding scheme may include a<br>
convolutional code, a Turbo code, a low density parity check (LDPC) code, a cyclic<br>
redundancy check (CRC) code, a block code, and so on, or a combination thereof. An<br>
interleave!' 214 interleaves (or reorders) the code bits based on an interleaving scheme.<br>
A symbol mapper 216 maps the interleaved bits in accordance with a modulation<br>
scheme and provides data symbols. The coding and modulation for each data stream<br>
may be determined by a rate selected for that data stream. Data stream processors 210a<br>
through 2lOnd provide N0 data symbol streams.<br>
[0046] In another embodiment, which is not shown in FIG. 2, TX data processor 112<br>
jointly processes the data symbol stream(s) to be sent with STTD and the data symbol<br>
stream(s) to be sent without STTD. For example, TX data processor 112 may receive a<br>
single data stream, encode the data stream based on a coding scheme, demultiplex the<br>
code bits into ND coded bit streams, and perform interleaving and symbol mapping<br>
separately for the NO coded bit streams to generate ND data symbol streams. In yet<br>
another embodiment, which is also not shown in FIG. 2, TX data processor 112<br>
independently processes the data symbol stream(s) to be sent with STTD and the data<br>
symbol slream(s) to be sent without STTD. For example, TX data processor 112 may<br>
receive a first data stream to be sent with STTD and a second data stream to be sent<br>
without STTD. TX data processor 112 may encode, interleave, symbol map, and<br>
demultiplex the first data stream to generate (Nc - ND) data symbol streams to be sent<br>
with STTD. TX data processor 112 may also encode, interleave, symbol map, and<br>
demultiplex the second data stream to generate (2ND โ Nc) data symbol streams to be<br>
sent without STTD. TX data processor 112 may also process the data stream(s) in other<br>
manners, and this is within the scope of the invention.<br>
[0047] For the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, TX STTD processor 120 includes ND<br>
STTD encoders 220a through 220nd for the ND data symbol streams. Each STTD<br>
encoder 220 performs STTD encoding on its data symbol stream and provides two<br>
coded symbol streams to a multiplexer (Mux) 222. Multiplexer 222 receives the ND<br>
data symbol streams from TX data processor 112 and the ND pairs of coded symbol<br>
streams from STTD encoders 220a through 220nd. For each data symbol stream,<br>
multiplexer 222 provides either that data symbol stream or the associated pair of coded<br>
symbol streams. Multipliers 224a through 224nc receive and scale the Nc symbol<br>
streams from multiplexer 222 with gains g\ through #NC , respectively, and provides Nc<br>
coded symbol streams. The scaling may also be performed at other locations within the<br>
transmit path.<br>
[0048] For the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, spatial spreader 130 includes NF spatial<br>
processors 230a through 230nf for the. NF subbands. A demultiplexer (Demux) 228<br>
receives the NC coded symbol streams and pilot symbols, provides the coded symbols<br>
on subbands and symbol periods used for data transmission, and provides pilot symbols<br>
on subbands and symbol periods used for pilot transmission. Each spatial processor 230<br>
receives NC coded symbols and/or pilot symbols to be sent on the associated subband k<br>
in one symbol period, multiplies the coded symbol and/or pilot symbols with a steering<br>
matrix Y(k), and provides NT transmit symbols to be sent from the NT transmit antenna<br>
on subband k. A multiplexer 232 receives the transmit symbols from all NF spatial<br>
processors 230a through 230nf and maps the NT transmit symbols from each spatial<br>
processor 230 to the NT transmit symbol streams. Each transmit symbol stream includes<br>
NF transmit symbols from the NF spatial processors 230a through 230nf for one transmit<br>
antenna.<br>
[0049] FIG. 3 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of modulators 132a through<br>
132nt at transmitting entity 110. Within each modulator 132, an IDFT unit 312<br>
performs an Np-point IDFT or IFFT on NF transmit symbols to be sent on the NF<br>
subbands in one symbol period and provides NF time-domain samples. A parallel-toserial<br>
converter (P/S Conv) 314 serializes the NF time-domain samples. A circular shift<br>
unit 316 performs a cyclic or circular shift of the NF time-domain samples by<br>
T, =(i-l)-AT, where AT is a fixed period (e.g., one sample period) and T, is the<br>
amount of cyclic shift for transmit antenna i. A cyclic prefix generator 318 receives the<br>
NF circularly shifted samples from unit 316, appends a cyclic prefix of Ncp samples, and<br>
provides an OFDM symbol (or transmission symbol) containing NF + Ncp samples.<br>
The time-domain continuous beamforming may be disabled by having cyclic shift units<br>
316a through 3l6nt simply pass the time-domain samples from P/S converters 314a<br>
through 3L64nt to cyclic prefix generators 318a through 3168nt, respectively. Circular<br>
shift units 316a through 316nt may also just delay (instead of circularly delay) the timedomain<br>
samples from P/S converters 314a through 3164nt by different amounts, so that<br>
the transmissions from antennas 136a through 136nt are delayed by different amounts.<br>
16<br>
[0050] FIG. 4 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of a single-antenna receiving<br>
entity 15f)x and a multi-antenna receiving entity 150y. Each receiving entity may be<br>
part of a base station or a user terminal.<br>
[0051] At single-antenna receiving entity 150x, an antenna 152x receives the NT<br>
modulated signals transmitted by transmitting entity 110 and provides a received signal<br>
to a receiver unit (RCVR) 154x. Receiver unit 154x conditions (e.g., amplifies, filters,<br>
frequency downconverts, and digitizes) the received signal and provides a stream of<br>
received samples to a demodulator (Demod) 156x. For an OFDM-based system,<br>
demodulator 156x performs OFDM demodulation on the received samples to obtain<br>
received symbols, provides received data symbols to a detector 158, and provides<br>
received pilot symbols to a channel estimator 162. Channel estimator 162 derives an<br>
effective channel response estimate for a single-input single-output (SISO) channel<br>
between transmitting entity 110 and receiving entity 150x for each subband used for<br>
data transmission. Detector 158 performs data detection (e.g., equalization) on the<br>
received data symbols for each subband based on the effective SISO channel response<br>
estimate for that subband and provides recovered data symbols for the subband. An RX<br>
data processor 160 processes (e.g., symbol demaps, deinterleaves, and decodes) the<br>
recovered data symbols and provides decoded data.<br>
[0052] At multi-antenna receiving entity 150y, NR antennas 152a through 152nr receive<br>
the NT modulated signals, and each antenna 152 provides a received signal to a<br>
respective receiver unit 154. Each receiver unit 154 conditions its received signal and<br>
provides a received sample stream to an associated demodulator (Demod) 156. Each<br>
demodulator 156 performs OFDM demodulation (if applicable) on its received sample<br>
stream, provides received data symbols to an RX spatial processor 170, and provides<br>
received pilot symbols to a channel estimator 166.<br>
[0053] Channel estimator 166 obtains received pilot symbols for all NR receive<br>
antennas and derives a channel response estimate for the actual or effective MIMO<br>
channel between transmitting entity 110 and receiving entity 150y for each subband<br>
used for data transmission. If transmitting entity 110 performs spatial processing on the<br>
pilot symbols in the same manner as the data symbols, as shown in FIG. 1, then the<br>
steering matrices may be viewed as being part of the wireless channel. In this case,<br>
receiving entity 150y may derive an estimate of the effective MIMO channel, which<br>
includes the actual MIMO channel response as well as the effects of the steering<br>
matrices. If transmitting entity 110 does not perform spatial processing on the pilot<br>
symbols, then receiving entity I50y may derive an estimate of the actual MIMO channel<br>
and may then derive an estimate of the effective MIMO channel based on the actual<br>
MIMO channel response estimate and the steering matrices.<br>
[0054] A matched filter generator 168 derives a spatial filter matrix M(fc) for each<br>
subband used for transmission based on the channel response estimate for that subband.<br>
RX spatial processor 170 obtains received data symbols for all NR receive antennas and<br>
performs pre-processing on the received data symbols to account for the STTD scheme<br>
used by transmitting entity 110. RX spatial processor 170 further performs receiver<br>
spatial processing (or spatial matched filtering) on the pre-processed data symbols for<br>
each subband with the spatial filter matrix for that subband and provides detected<br>
symbols for the subband. An RX STTD processor 172 performs post-processing on the<br>
detected symbols based on the STTD scheme used by transmitting entity 110 and<br>
provides recovered data symbols. An RX data processor 174 processes (e.g., symbol<br>
dernaps, deinterleaves, and decodes) the recovered data symbols and provides decoded<br>
data.<br>
[0055] Controllers 180x and 180y control the operation at receiving entities 150x and<br>
150y, respectively. Memories 182x and 182y store data and/or program codes for<br>
receiving entities 150x and 150y, respectively.<br>
[0056] Various types of steering matrices may be used for spatial spreading. For<br>
example, steering matrix V(&amp;) may be a Walsh matrix, a Fourier matrix, or some other<br>
"1 1"<br>
matrix. A 2x2 Walsh matrix W^ be expressed as W2x2 = . A larger size<br>
Walsh matrix W2NX2N may be formed from a smaller size Walsh matrix WNxN, as<br>
follows:<br>
An Nx N Fourier matrix DNxN has element dnm in the n-th row of the m-th column,<br>
which may be expressed as:<br>
d =e N , for n = l,...,N and m = l,...,N. Eq (5) ' n ,m<br>
Fourier matrices of any square dimension (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on) may be formed.<br>
[0057] A Walsh matrix WNxN, a Fourier matrix DNxN , or some other matrix may be<br>
used as a base matrix BNxN to form other steering matrices. For an N xN base matrix,<br>
each of rows 2 through N of the base matrix may be independently multiplied with one<br>
of M different possible scalars. MN~' different steering matrices may be obtained from<br>
MN~' different permutations of the M scalars'for the N-l rows. For example, each of<br>
rows 2 through N may be independently multiplied with a scalar of +1, -1, +j, or -y,<br>
where j - v-1 - For N = 4, 64 different steering matrices may be generated from a<br>
base matrix B4x4 with the four different scalars. Additional steering matrices may be<br>
generated with other scalars, e.g., eยฑJ^"'4, eยฑ]"14, eยฑJ"'a, and so on. In general, each<br>
row of the. base matrix may be multiplied with any scalar having the form e j d , where 0<br>
may be any phase value. A set of NxN steering matrices may be generated from the<br>
NxN base matrix as V(z') = gN โข B^, where gN =1/VN and B'NXN is the j-th<br>
steering matrix generated with the base matrix BNxN. The scaling by gN =1/VN<br>
ensures that e.ach column of V(i') has unit power. The steering matrices in the set may<br>
be used for different subbands and/or time intervals.<br>
[0058] The steering matrices may also be generated in a pseudo-random manner. The<br>
steering matrices are typically unitary matrices having columns that are orthogonal to<br>
one another. The steering matrices may also be orthonormal matrices having<br>
orthogonal columns and unit power for each column, so that Vw -V-I. A steering<br>
matrix of dimension that is not square may be obtained by deleting one or more<br>
columns of a square steering matrix.<br>
[0059] Different steering matrices may be used for different time intervals. For<br>
example, different steering matrices may be used for different symbol periods for SFTD<br>
and for different 2-symbol intervals for STTD and OTD. For an OFDM-based system,<br>
different steering matrices may be used for different subbands for STTD and OTD and<br>
for different pairs of subbands for SFTD. Different steering matrices may also be used<br>
for different subbands and different symbol periods. The randomization provided by<br>
steering diversity (across time and/or frequency) with the use of different steering<br>
matrices can mitigate deleterious effects of a wireless channel.<br>
 [0060] The transmission techniques described herein may be implemented by various<br>
means. For example, these techniques may be implemented in hardware, firmware,<br>
software, or a combination thereof. For a hardware implementation, the processing<br>
units at the transmitting entity may be implemented within one or more application<br>
specific integrated circuits (ASICs), digital signal processors (DSPs), digital signal<br>
processing devices (DSPDs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), field programmable<br>
gate arrays (FPGAs), processors, controllers, micro-controllers, microprocessors, other<br>
electronic units designed to perform the functions described herein, or a combination<br>
thereof.<br>
[0061] For a software implementation, the techniques may be implemented with<br>
modules (e.g., procedures, functions, and so on) that perform the functions described<br>
herein. The software codes may be stored in a memory and executed by a processor.<br>
The memory may be implemented within the processor or external to the processor, in<br>
which case it can be communicatively coupled to the processor via various means as is<br>
known in the ait.<br>
[0062] The previous description of the disclosed embodiments is provided to enable any<br>
person skilled in the art to make or use the present invention. Various modifications to<br>
these embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic<br>
principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments without departing from<br>
the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be<br>
