BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an adjuster of a string-end-fixing portion of an article used for, for example, various kinds of clothing including shoes, tents, curtains, suspenders or the like.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
When walking or working in a farm in the rain, people often haul up bottoms of trousers. In a hot day, people often haul up sleeves of a shirt or a jacket. However, it is difficult to keep the bottoms of the trousers or the sleeves of the shirt or the jacket hauled up if no way to maintain them in such a state is adapted. Conventionally, one end of a short tape is sewed on each of bottom edges of the trousers or each of sleeve edges of the shirt or the jacket and a male or a female member of a snap button is attached at a position where each of the bottoms or the sleeves is hauled up. When hauling up the bottoms or the sleeves, a female or a male member of the snap button attached to a free end of the tape is engaged with the male or the female member of the snap button attached to the bottom or the sleeve so as to maintain a hauled up state. However, in a case of using the snap button, since an attaching position<br><br>
of the snap button is fixed, a hauled up position of the bottoms or the sleeves is inevitably fixed and it is difficult to adjust<br>
the position.<br>
The above-described problem is solved by an adjuster of a string-end-fixing portion disclosed, for example, by an International application publication No. WO 03/082041 A2 that enables an adjustment of the fixing portion of the string end in a various embodiments by operating a slider. As a basic construction, the adjuster comprises a slider comprising an upper plate, a lower plate and a post portion connecting the upper and lower plates at a center portion thereof with a predetermined gap, and a pair of long tapes each of which has an element row constituted of a plurality of elements that are attached along an opposing side edge of the tape with a predetermined pitch and able to engage and disengage, and the element row being inserted into the gap of the slider. The slider has a structure integrated in such a state where rear mouths in an ordinary slider of a slide fastener are formed in front and rear portions in a direction of a fixing position of a string end and shoulder mouths of an ordinary slider of a slide fastener collide each other. Furthermore, an attaching portion for a string or the like is provided at a lower face of the lower plate for fixing an end of the string while the other end of the string is fixed to an adjusting portion of a fixing position of a string end of an attached edge portion of<br><br>
a cap, an adjusting portion of position of a belt of a bag, an adjusting portion of a width of a back of a grove, an adjusting portion of a fixing position of a shoe string for tightening or the like. The tape with the elements corresponds to a stringer of an ordinary slide fastener.<br>
Vfhen the tape with the elements of the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion is attached to adjusting operation portion for moving the fixing portion of the string end disposed at a portion of the above-mentioned various articles by sewing, and the slider is slid along the element row so as to change a position of the slider, a position of the end of the string or the like attached to the slider is changed and a string-end-fixing portion where the other end of the string or the like is fixed and considered as a second position of any one of the articles is moved and adjusted. Although the slider is slid, the element rows are always engaged before and after the slider, since the both end portions of the slider in a direction of the string-end-fixing portion is formed as rear mouths unlike the ordinary slide fastener.<br>
As aforementioned, according to the adjuster of the string-end-attaching portion of the article disclosed by the International application publication No. WO 03/082041 A2, by sliding the slider along the element row of the tape with the elements, the string-end-fixing portion of the article as the second position is moved to a desired position. Although the<br><br>
International application publication No. WO 03/082041 A2 describes that it is possible to use two sliders, it does not disclose any specific structure. Therefore, it is considered that one slider is used to move the string-end-fixing portion of the article in an actual embodiment. However, the single slider tends to have a complicated shape and structure, which requires complicated processes and long time for manufacturing.<br>
In either case, according to the International application publication No. WO 03/082041 A2, the string or the like, one end of which is attached to the string-end-fixing portion disposed at the lower plate of the slider is generally disposed on an inner face of the article. If the string or the like is exposed on the inner face of the article, it tends to entangle a part of a body of a person wearing or using the article, which may damage the article or make the person fall in a worst case.<br>
In order to prevent this interference of the string or the like disposed on the inner face of the article, as also described in the International application publication No. WO 03/082041 A2, the string or the like is inserted into a string guide cloth in a tunnel shape so as to cover the string or the like, thereby preventing an interfering movement of the string or the like. However, if the string or the like comes off the slider or cut off halfway, the end of the string or the like must be attached to the string-end-fixing portion of the slider<br><br>
again or the string must be replaced. In these cases, since the lower face of the slider is also in the string guide cloth of the tunnel shape, and further both front and rear ends of the slider have a same structure as that of a rear mouth of a slider for an ordinary slide fastener as aforementioned, the element rows before and after the slider are in a engaged state and closed. As a result, it is impossible to attach the end of the string or replace the string.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is achieved in order to solve the above-de scribed problems and its specific object is to provide an adjuster of a string-end-fixing portion of an article which enables to move a string-end-attaching portion without using a slider having a complicated shape and structure, to maintain the string-end-fixing portion unless its position is changed again once the string-end-fixing portion of the article is moved, and to attach or change the string or the like easily if the string or the like is loosed from the slider or cut off.<br>
In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, the present invention provides an adjuster of a string-end-fixing portion of an article for changing a second position in the article via a string or the like by operating a handling portion disposed at a first position in the article, being characterized in that the handling portion comprises: two tapes, each having<br><br>
an element row of a plurality of elements for engaging and disengaging the element row being fixed along an opposing side edge portion thereof; first and second sliders in which both element rows are inserted and which engage and disengage the elements by sliding operation thereof; and a connecting member for connecting the first and second sliders, wherein any one of the first slider, the second slider and the connecting member comprises a string-end-attaching portion for attaching the string or the like, one end of the string or the like is attached to the string-end-attaching portion and the other end of the string or the like is attached to the second position in the article, each of the first and second sliders comprises an upper plate, a lower plate, a post portion for defining an element guide channel between the upper and lower plates and connecting the upper and lower plates, and a connecting-member-mounting portion disposed on a top face of the upper plate, and the first and second sliders are connected via the connecting member so that the post member of each of the first and second sliders is opposed to each other.<br>
According to the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion of the present invention, it is preferable that the first slider comprises a stopper pawl member for stopping sliding of the first slider by elastically entering a gap between the adjoining elements when the sliding is stopped, and for allowing the sliding of the first slider by separating from<br><br>
the gap between the elements in conjunction with the sliding operation via the connecting member against an elastic urge.<br>
Preferably, the connecting member and the first and/or second sliders are constructed so as to be engaged and disengaged. Furthermore, the connecting member may comprise a connecting portion and a pull portion.<br>
Furthermore, the connecting member may comprise a cover body for covering the first and second sliders from above and a connecting body attached to the cover body for connecting a connecting-member-mounting portion of the first slider and a connecting-member-mounting portion of the second slider. In this case, it is preferable that the connecting body is pivoted on the cover body so as to swing. Furthermore, it is preferable that the string-end-attaching portion is inserted into a gap between the first and second sliders, specifically from a top wall of the cover body into the gap.<br>
The adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion of the invention comprises as its basic construction two tapes with elements corresponding to fastener stringers of a conventional slide fastener, two sliders, namely the first slider and the second slider, having different structures in which each element row is inserted, and the connecting member for connecting the first and the second sliders, as aforementioned. In other words, the invention discloses the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion which does not use a single slider<br><br>
having a complicated shape as disclosed in the International application publication No. WO 03/082041 A2, but uses two kinds of sliders connected each other. An ordinary slider for a slide fastener can be used for these two kinds of sliders.<br>
In other words, common feature of the two sliders is that end portions on one side in a sliding direction of the upper plate and the lower plate having flanges on right and left thereof are connected by the post portion and an element passage in a Y shape is formed therein. Generally speaking, a pull attaching post is provided on a top face of the upper plate. However, some sliders have pull attaching posts on both the top face of the upper plate and a bottom face of the lower plate in order to enable operation of the sliders on both of upper and lower faces.<br>
Therefore, according to the invention, it is not necessary to manufacture a slider provided with a string-end-fixing portion in particular because it is possible to combine, for example, a conventionally known ordinary slider which does not have a pull attaching post on its lower plate and a slider which has a pull attaching post on its lower plate as well so as to enable sliding operation on both upper and lower faces. In this case, an end of the string or the like is attached to the pull attaching post provided on the lower plate.<br>
Furthermore, according to the invention, the pull attaching post may be eliminated form the slider.  In this case.<br><br>
the connecting member is directly attached to the upper plates of the first and second sliders. Alternatively, the pull attaching post on the lower plate may be eliminated. In this case, an end of the string or the like may be attached to, for example, the connecting member for connecting the first and second sliders. Therefore, the pull attaching post is not essential in this invention.<br>
The first and second sliders prepared as aforementioned are disposed so that end portions on a post side are opposed to each other and both sliders are connected via the connecting member. The first and second sliders connected via the connecting member are used as the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion of the article of the invention after the tapes with the elements are inserted therein. Since the end portions of the post side of the two kinds of the sliders are disposed so as to be opposed to each other, the element rows disengaged by one slider can be always engaged by the other slider. Furthermore, since the connecting member keeps a gap between the sliders in a predetermined distance so as not to separate too far, the element rows can be guided smoothly in the sliders.<br>
Furthermore, the string or the like attached to the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion of the invention has a free end which is fixed to the second position in the article while the pair of tapes with elements is fixed along an opening<br><br>
potion formed at a handling portion of the string-end-fixing portion which is the first position in the article by sewing. In this state, the sliders are slid via the connecting member along the element rows so as to pull up the string or the like. As a result, the string-end-fixing portion as the second position of the article can be moved to a desired position. Furthermore, by returning the sliders at an original position, the string-end-fixing portion can be moved back to its original position (original state). In the invention, since the handling portion can be disposed at any place, it is possible to dispose the handling portion at a place easy to handle though the string-end-fixing portion is not at hand, thereby easily sliding the slider so as to move the string-end-fixing portion.<br>
Furthermore, in the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion of the invention, during aforementioned operation, the string or the like attached to a part of the sliders including the connecting member may be loosen off or cut off due to some sort of reasons. In such a case, according to the invention, since there is a gap between the first and second sliders via the connecting member, a state of the string or the like can be seen. Therefore, it is possible to attach the end of the string or the like to the string-attaching portion of the slider or replace with a new string or the like by using a crochet needle or the like without removing a guide cloth in a tunnel shape.<br>
In the invention, the first slider comprises the stopper<br><br>
pawl member having the front-end-stopper pawl. When sliding of the slider is stopped, the front-end-stopper pawl elastically enters and engages in the gap between the elements through the stopper pawl hole formed in the upper plate of the first slider. When the slider is slid via the connecting member, the front-end-stopper pawl of the stopper pawl member disengages from the gap between the elements against an elastic urge by a pulling-up movement of the connecting member in conjunction with the sliding operation, thereby enabling the sliding of the slider. If the sliding operation of the slider is stopped at this time so as to release the pulling-up movement of the connecting member, the front-end-stopper pawl enters and engages in the gap between the adjoining elements due to elasticity, the sliding of the slider is stopped. If the stopper pawl member working in this way is provided in the first slider, the string-end-fixing portion of the article can be arbitrarily moved by sliding the slider. Furthermore, when the slider is stopped, the slider is unable to slide any further. Therefore, the string-end-fixing portion can be securely maintained at a position to which the string-end-fixing portion is moved.<br>
Furthermore, if the connecting member can be separated from the first and second sliders or either one of the first and second sliders, operation for attaching or replacing the string or the like becomes easier. Furthermore, providing the<br><br>
pull portion on the connecting member facilitates the sliding operation of the slider regardless of a shape of a connecting portion.<br>
Furthermore, according to the invention, the connecting member may comprise the cover body for covering the first and second sliders from above and the connecting body attached to the cover body for connecting the connecting-member-mounting portion of the first slider and the connecting-member-mounting portion of the second slider. By covering the first and second sliders and the connecting member with the cover body, it is possible to finish an appearance of the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion beautifully. Furthermore, the sliding of the slider becomes easier by holding the cover body to move the slider.<br>
In this case, since the connecting body is pivoted on the cover body so as to swing, the connecting body can be swung in an up-and-down direction in conjunction with a movement of the cover body when the cover body is moved. By this swinging movement of the connecting body, the front-end-stopper pawl of the stopper member can be easily disengaged from the gap of between the elements.<br>
Furthermore, since the string-end-attaching portion is inserted into the gap between the first and second sliders, preferably from the top wall of the cover body, the cover body and the string or the like can be integrally connected. As a<br><br>
result, by operating and moving the cover body, the string or the like is pulled so that the string-end-fixing portion can be securely moved.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred modes of the present invention will be<br>
described with reference to accompanying drawings according to<br><br>
representative embodiments. In the meantime, the present invention is not restricted to embodiments described below and may be modified in various ways as long as substantially same features are provided and similar effect can be exerted. [First Embodiment]<br>
FIGS. 1-5 show a first embodiment of the invention. FIG.<br>
1	is a perspective view of a major portion of an adjuster of<br>
a string-end-fixing portion according to a first embodiment of<br>
the invention as seen from its front side. FIG. 2 is a<br>
perspective view of the adjuster of the string-end-fixing<br>
portion as seen from its bottom side. FIG. 3 is a side view<br>
showing a sectional view of a part of sliders of the adjuster<br>
of the string-end-fixing portion.<br>
As understood from these drawings, a handling portion 20 of an adjuster of a string-end-fixing portion 10 according to the first embodiment is disposed at a first position of an article. The handling portion 20 comprises: two long tapes T, each having an element row ER of a plurality of elements E fixed along an opposing side edge portion of each of the tapes 1, the elements engaging and disengaging each other; a    slider<br>
2	constituted of first and second sliders 21a and 21b in which<br>
the element rows are ER inserted and which engage and disengage<br>
the elements E by sliding operation thereof; and a connecting<br>
member 27 for connecting the first and second sliders 21a and<br>
21b.<br><br>
According to the first embodiment, the element row ER is obtained by forming a linear (monofilament) made of thermoplastic resin such as polyester, polypropylene, nylon or the like in a spiral shape. Each element E has a coupling head for engaging with and disengaging from a mating element, upper and lower fixing leg portions which are extended from the coupling head so as to be perpendicular to a side edge portion of the tape 1 and fixed thereon by sewing or the like, and a inverted portion which inverts so as to be connected to an adjoining upper fixing leg portion.<br>
Although the elements E are continuously formed in this embodiment, each of the element E can be formed in dependently and it can be formed of metal instead of the thermoplastic resin. In this case, the element E of the thermoplastic resin is directly formed on the tape 1 and integrated by an injection molding. The element E of the metal is fixed to the tape 1 in such a manner that, for example, leg portions thereof having a Y-shaped cross section are crimped so as to nip the side edge portion of the tape 1. The tape with the elements T obtained in this way has a same structure as that of a fastener stringer of an ordinary slide fastener.<br>
The first and second sliders 21a and 21b respectively comprise first and second upper and lower plates 22a, 23a; 22b, 23b, first and second post portions 25a, 25b which define element guide channels 24a, 24b in a Y-shape between the upper<br><br>
and lower plates 22a, 23a; 22b, 23b and which connect: ena portions on one side of the upper and lower plates 22a, 23a; 22b, 23b, and first and second connecting-member-attaching post 26a, 26b which are disposed on top faces of the first and second upper plates 22a, 22b and extended longwise in a sliding direction of the sliders 21a, 21b and erected in a gate shape. These first and second connecting-member-attaching post 26a, 26b serve as a connecting-member-mounting portion. This structure of the sliders 12a, 21b is same as that of a slider of an ordinary slide fastener.<br>
In the first embodiment, the first and second sliders 21a, 21b are disposed in such a manner that end portions on sides of the first and second post portions 25a, 25b are opposed to each other and the element rows ER of the tapes with elements T are inserted therein. This structure is not special as compared with a slide fastener in which two conventional ordinary sliders are used.<br>
However, in the first embodiment, the connecting-member-attaching posts 26a, 26b of the first and second upper plate 22a, 22b are connected via the connecting member 27 as aforementioned while a string-attaching portion 28 for attaching one end 31 of the string or the like 3 at a bottom face of the lower plate 23b of the second slider 21b. It is understood that the first embodiment is different from a conventional ordinary slide fastener in this point. However,<br><br>
there have been a slider having a special structure which enables sliding operation thereof on front and rear face sides by providing pull attaching posts on top face and bottom face of upper and lower plates of the slider, respectively.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to use a conventionally manufactured slider for the slide fastener for the first and second slider of the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion of the first embodiment. As a result, it is not necessary to manufacture a special slider for the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion. The adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 of the article having such a structure according to the first embodiment is attached to, for example, a first position of clothing within easy reach of a hand to be described later while one other end 32 of the string or the like 3 is attached to a place of the string-end-fixing portion which is often changed such as a bottom of clothing. With this structure, it is possible, for example, to move a position of the bottom to an arbitrary position.<br>
The connecting member 27 comprises a connecting portion 27a for connecting-member-attaching posts 26a, 26b of the first and second sliders 21a, 21b and a pull portion 27b attached to the connecting portion 27a. The connecting portion 27a is formed of a ring body in a 9 shape in a top view wherein front and rear end portions in a sliding direction of the sliders extend horizontally and incline upward toward a center thereof<br><br>
between the both ends in a mountain shape in a side view, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 3. Furthermore, opposing end portions of the connecting-member-attaching posts 26a, 26b of the first and second sliders 21a, 21b are inserted into first and second small ring portions formed in front and rear end portions of the connecting portion 27a. As a result, the connecting member 2 7 prevents the connecting-member-attaching posts 26a, 26b from being separated to each other beyond a predetermined distance.<br>
As also shown in FIGS. 1 and 3, the pull portion 27b comprises a cylindrical lever 27b-1 in which a partition lever 27a-1 for partitioning the first and second small ring portions of the connecting portion 27a is inserted and a pulling tape attaching ring 27b-3 connected and integrated with the partition lever 27a-l via a flat plate portion 27b-2. A short pulling tape 35 is attached to the pulling tape attaching ring 2 7b-3 in such a manner that one end thereof is inserted in the pulling tape attaching ring 27b-3 and folded back.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, the string-attaching portion 28 attached at the bottom face of the lower plate 23b of the second slider 21b has a same shape as that of the connecting-member-attaching post 26b of the second slider 21b and the string-attaching portion 28 and the connecting-member-attaching post 26b are disposed in a mirror symmetry state with each other interposing the upper and lower plates 22b, 23b of the second slider 21b. The other end 32 of<br><br>
the string or the like 3 is attached to the string-end-fixing portion as the second position of a bottom or sleeve of clothing as aforementioned.<br>
Furthermore, according to the first embodiment, an automatic stopper pawl member 29 is provided in a part of the first slider 21a. The stopper pawl member 29 escapes from a gap between the elements E when the slider 2 is in sliding operation and allows a free sliding of the slider 2. On the other hand, when the slider 2 is stopped, the stopper pawl member 29 enters into the gap between the elements E adjoining a stopped position thereof so as not to allow any further sliding of the slider 2. As aforementioned, a well-known stopper pawl mechanism disclosed, for example, by Japanese Utility Model publication No, 4-32974 can be used for the stopper pawl member 29. In this specification, as to the first slider 21a, an end where the post portion 25a for connecting the upper and lower plate member 22a, 23a is attached is called as a front end portion and the other end is called as a rear end portion.<br>
The stopper pawl mechanism is briefly described herein after with reference to the stopper pawl mechanism disclosed by the Japanese Utility Model publication No, 4-32974 on a basis of FIGS. 4 and 5. The connecting-member-attaching post 26a of the first slider 21a shown in the drawings erects from the front end portion of the upper plate 22a and inclines downward toward the rear end portion so as to be in a gate shape.  The<br><br>
connecting-member-attaching post 26a comprises right and left side walls and the stopper pawl member 29 is pivoted at a front side in a inner space between the side walls so as to be rotate in an up-and-down direction. In a meantime, a shape of the connecting-member-attaching post 26a is not limited to a shape shown in the drawings.<br>
According to an illustrated example, a base end portion 29a of the stopper pawl member 29 is inserted between right and left side walls 26c of the connecting member attaching portion 26a, a pin 5 is inserted into an axis hole 26d formed in the right and left side walls 26c and a hole portion formed in the base end portion 29a so as to support the stopper pawl member 29 rotatably in an up-and-down direction. The stopper pawl member 29 has a substantially Y shape having arm portions 29b, 29c branching in up and down directions from the base end portion 29a in a side view.<br>
On the other hand, an element engaging window 22a-1 which is a stopper pawl entering hole of the invention is formed so as to penetrate in up-and-down direction in a upper plate 22a at a portion deflected in a right or left direction from a substantial center. A front-end-stopper pawl 29c-l of the lower arm portion 29c branched downward from the stopper pawl member 29 projects into the element guide channel 24a through the element engaging window 22a-1 and enters and engages in the gap between the elements E of the element row ER guided therein.<br><br>
Furthermore, an end portion 27a-1 of the connecting potion 27a of the connecting member 27 is inserted between the upper and lower arm portions 29b, 29c of the stopper pawl member 29. On the other hand, a hole with a bottom 22a-2 extending downward from the top face of the upper plate 22a is formed in the post portion 25a in the first slider 21a and a compressed spring 4 is inserted in the hole with the bottom 22a-2. A top end of the compressed spring 4 elastically contacts with a bottom face of the base end portion 29a of the stopper pawl member 29. When the slider 2 is stopped, the compressed spring 4 urges the front-end-stopper pawl 29c-l of the stopper pawl member 29 so that the front-end-stopper pawl 29c-1 can project into the element guide channel 24a through the element engaging window 22a-l.<br>
Furthermore, if the pulling tape 35 attached to the connecting member 27 is held and pulled up in sliding operation of the slider 2, the connecting portion 27a of the connecting member 27 is brought up against an urge by the compressed spring 4 due to a pulling-up force. With this operation, the stopper pawl member 29 is rotated upward with the front end portion 29a as its center so that the front-end-stopper pawl 29c-1 is disengaged upward from the element guide channel 24a. As a result, an engagement of the front-end-stopper pawl 29c-] entering in the gap between the elements E of the element row ER is automatically released.<br><br>
FIG. 6 shows a first modified example of the second slider 21b. In the first embodiment, the connecting-member-attaching post 26b and the string-attaching portion 28 of the second slider 21b is integrally formed in a gate shape extending longwise in a sliding direction of a slider body 21b-l. On the other hand, in this modified example, a pair of supporting posts erected on a substantially central portion of the upper plate 22b of the slider body 21b-1 disposed in a sliding direction of the slider body 21b-1 with a gap and another pair of supporting posts having a similar shape erected on a substantially central portion of the lower plate 23b are integrally formed with the slider body 21b-1. the connecting-member-attaching post 26b and the string-attaching portion 28 is respectively formed by crimping front end portions of each pair of the supporting posts 26b-l, 26b-2; 28a, 28b. By adopting such a structure, manufacturing process of the connecting-member-attaching posts 26a, 26b and the string-attaching portion 28 can be reduced and manufacturing cost can be largely reduced as well.<br>
In a second modified example of the second slider 21b shown in FIG. 7, a structure of the connecting-member-attaching post 26b is same as that of the first modified example. However, it is different from the first modified example in that the string-attaching portion 28 is integrally formed next to the connecting-member-attaching post 26b on the top face of the upper plate 22b.  That is, the connecting-member-attaching<br><br>
post 26b is erected on the upper plate 22b of the slider body 21b-1 on a side of the front end portion and the string-attaching portion 28 is erected on a side of the rear end portion. In the string-attaching portion 28, there is provided a string-inserting hole 28c in which the string or the like is inserted and folded to be fixed. [Second Embodiment]<br>
FIGS. 8 and 9 show a second embodiment of the invention. FIG. 8 is a perspective view of a connecting member 27 of an adjuster of a string-end-fixing portion of an article as obliquely seen from beneath. FIG. 9 is a longitudinal sectional view of the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion of the article in which first and second sliders 21a, 21b are connected via the connecting member 27.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, the connecting member 27 according to the second embodiment is a single body longer in a longitudinal section direction and comprises a tunnel-shaped main body 171 having an inverted U-shaped cross section and extending in a direction of the string-end-fixing portion (sliding direction of the slider), right and left flange portions 172, 173 horizontally extending along each side edges in a width direction of the tunnel-shaped main body 171, and plate pieces 174, 175 having a predetermined width and extending in up and down directions from a center of the tunnel-shaped main body 171 and the right and left flange portions 172, 173<br><br>
in the direction of the string-end-fixing portion.<br>
At an open side lower end of each end of the tunnel-shaped main body 171 in a longitudinal direction, there is provided a pair of right and left engaging protrusions 171a having a half circle cross section and horizontally protruding from an inner wall face of the tunnel-shaped main body 171 in a direction in which both engaging protrusions 171a approach each other. The plate pieces 174, 175 extend in up and down directions so as to be perpendicular with respect to the tunnel-shaped main body 171 and the right and left flange portions 172, 173. On sides of front ends of the plate pieces, there are provided a pull inserting hole 174a and string inserting hole 175a having a same shape longer in a width direction of a plate.<br>
On the other hand, as shown in FIG. 9, as the first slider 21a and second slider 21b in the second embodiment, well-known slider bodies for a slide fastener having no pull are used without any special process. According to the second embodiment, a stopper pawl 157e is also provided in the first slider 21a as described later. The stopper pawl 157e is integrally formed with a part of a cover body 157 corresponding to a conventional pull attaching post. Furthermore, according to the second embodiment, no string-attaching portion as described in the first embodiment is provided on the bottom face of the lower plate 23b of the second slider 21b. However, as aforementioned, a plate piece 175 having the string inserting<br><br>
hole 175a is formed on the tunnel-shaped main body 171 and the right and left flange portions 172, 173 of the connecting member 27.<br>
The first slider 21a is hereinafter described in detail. As shown in FIG. 9, an upper plate 152 and u lower plate 153 is connected via a post portion 154 and a supporting post 155 is projected on an end top face of the upper plate 152 on a side of the post portion 154. A spring fitting groove 152a is formed on a top face of the upper plate 152 from the supporting post<br>
155	to an opposite end potion and a spring fixing hole 155a is formed inside of the post portion 154 on an extended line of the spring fitting groove 152a. A stick-shaped spring 156 is fitted in the spring fitting groove 152a and a portion on one end side is inserted and fixed in the spring fixing hole 15 5a while a portion on the other end side projects outside beyond an end portion of the upper plate 152 opposite to the supporting post 155. An end of the cover body 157 is rotatably pivoted on right and left side faces of the supporting post 155 while a hook portion 157d of the other end of the cover body 157 is engaged with a projecting end 156a of the stick-shaped spring<br>
156	projecting outside beyond the end portion of the upper plate 152.<br>
As a result, the cover body 157 rotates in up and down directions with the supporting post 155 as its center under an influence of en elastic force of the stick-like spring 156. The<br><br>
cover body 157 comprises the right and left side wall portions 157a and a top plate portion 157b for connecting top end edge portions of the right and left side wall portions 157a. The cover body 157 has a narrow and long shape as a whole and an inverted U-shaped cross section. Furthermore, in the right and left side wall portions 157a, there is formed window holes 15 7f in which an engaging protrusions 171a of the connecting member 27 to be described later is inserted. The cover body 157 having the above-described structures comprises a pivoting portion 157c for being pivoted on the supporting post 155 on one end portion thereof and the hook portion 157d bending inward on the other end portion thereof. Furthermore, at a part of the end portion of one of the right and left side wall portions 157a on a side where the hook portion 157d is formed, there is provided a stopper pawl 157e so as to project downward which corresponds to the front-end-stopper pawl 29c-l of the stopper pawl member 29 in the first embodiment. The end portion of the cover body 157 on the side where the hook portion 157d is formed maintains a horizontal state unless it is rotated against the elastic force of the stick-shaped spring 156 while the stopper pawl 157e is also accommodated in a stopper pawl inserting hole 15 2b formed in the upper plate 152 of the first slider 21a at all times.<br>
When the connecting member 27 is pulled upward, the cover body 157 largely rotates upward with the supporting post 155<br><br>
as its center- Accordingly, the hook portion 157d lifts a front end of the stick-shaped spring 156 which is elastically deformed and bent in a bow shape. At this time, the stopper pawl 15 7e is in a state that it is out of an element guide channel 158, so that an engagement between the stopper pawl 157e and elements is released. Furthermore, when pulling-up of the connecting member 27 is released, the stick-shaped spring bent in the bow shape elastically returns to its original shape and the front end thereof pushes the hook portion 157d so as to automatically rotate the cover body 157 downward with the supporting post 155 as its center. Consequently, the stopper pawl 157e enters into the element guide channel 158 so as to engage with the elements . On the other hand, the pair of right and left engaging protrusions 171a of the connecting member 27 according to the second embodiment horizontally projects from the inner wall face of the tunnel-shaped main body 171 in the direction in which both engaging protrusions 171a approach each other. A narrowest gap between half circle faces is set smaller than a width between outer side faces of the right and left side wall portions 157a. However, since the tunnel-shaped main body 171 of the connecting member 27 has an inverted U shape cross section in which both end portions in a direction of the string-end-fixing portion and a bottom face are open, a bottom portion open face can elastically deform in a width direction regardless of material, metal or synthetic resin.<br><br>
Therefore, when the connecting member 27 according to the second embodiment is assembled to the cover body 157 of the first slider 21b having above-mentioned structures according to the second embodiment, an only thing necessary to be done is to strongly push the connecting member 27 to the first slider 21a in such a manner that the cover body 157 is sandwiched between the right and left engaging protrusions 171a of the connecting member 27 • As a result, the tunnel-shaped main body 171 elastically deforms so as to separate the right and left engaging protrusions 171a, and then the engaging protrusions 171 fit in the window holes 157f of the cover body 157 and elastically returns to their original shapes to be hooked by the window holes 157f• In the aforementioned manner, the connecting member 27 is easily assembled with the first slider 21a.<br>
On the contrary, when the connecting member 27 is separated from the first slider 21a, the connecting member 27 is strongly moved upward to separate while the cover body 157 of the first slider 21a is pushed. Accordingly, the tunnel-shaped main body 171 is elastically deforms so as to separate the right and left engaging protrusions 171a, thereby removing the connecting member 27 from the window holes 157f and easily separating the connecting member 27 from the first slider 21a. With this function, the connecting member 2 7 can be separated from the first slider 21a or the connecting member<br><br>
27 can be assembled with the first slider 21a. Therefore, if the string or the like 3 is separated form the string inserting hole 175a of the plate piece 175 as the string-attaching portion, or if the string or the like 3 is cut halfway when the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion according to the second embodiment is used, for example, it is possible to easily attach an end portion of the string or the like 3 to the plate piece 175 again or to replace with a new string or the like, [Third Embodiment]<br>
FIGS. 10 and 11 show an adjuster of a string-end-fixing portion of an article according to a third embodiment of the invention. A connecting member 27 according to the third embodiment comprises a square plate portion 181, two long and narrow square pieces 182 are integrated in a center portion of a rear face of the square plate portion 181 so as to be parallel with a long side portion thereof like blades of a sled, and first and second cylindrical-stick-shaped connecting pieces 183 , 184 for connecting the squire pieces 182 at a lower side thereof.<br>
Between the two square pieces 182, the first cylindrical-stick-shaped connecting piece 183 is inserted into a gap between a cover body 26a which is a connecting-member-attaching post of the first slider 2la according to the third embodiment to be described later and ri slider body 21a-1 so as to support the first slider 21a. On the other hand, the second cylindrical-stick-shaped connecting<br><br>
piece 184 is inserted in a gap between a connecting-member-attaching post 165 of the second slider 21b and a slider body 161 so as to support the second slider 21b.<br>
The first slider 21a according to the third embodiment is substantially same as that of the first slider 21a according to the first embodiment in all structures. On the other hand, the second slider 21a according to the third embodiment comprise a connecting-member-attaching post 165 erected in a curved manner from a top face of an upper plate 164 corresponding to a post portion 164 for connecting the upper plate 162 and a lower plate 163 of the slider body 161 and extended in a sliding direction of the slider and a string-attaching portion 166 erected in a curved manner from a bottom face of the lower plate 163 and extended in the sliding direction of the slider as the connecting-member-attaching post 165. Furthermore, in a center portion of the upper plate 162 in a right and left width direction, a sliding groove (not shown) is formed in a sliding direction of the slider for holding and guiding a sliding piece 167 having a strip shape and a projection 167a projected on a rear end side thereof, and a sliding piece inserting hole 162a extending from a halfway of the upper plate 162 to a center portion of the post portion 164 on an extending line of the sliding groove is continuously provided.<br>
A compressed spring 168 is inserted in a back portion of the sliding piece inserting hole 162a and a free end of the<br><br>
compressed spring is connected to an end portion on a post portion side of the sliding piece 167. Therefore, if the projection 167a is pushed to a side of the post portion 164, the sliding piece 167 is guided to the sliding groove and the sliding piece inserting hole 162a against an urge by the compressed spring 168 so as to slide in a direction of the post portion 164. As a result, a gap where the second cylindrical-stick-shaped connecting piece 184 of the connecting member 27 can pass through is formed between the projection 167a of the sliding piece 167 and an end portion of the connecting-member-attaching post 165 on an extended side thereof. When a pushing of the projection 167a is released, the sliding piece 167 is guide and slid in the sliding groove and the sliding piece inserting hole 162 by an urge of the compressed spring 168 so as to return to a position where the projection 167a and the end portion of the connecting-member-attaching post 165 on the extending side is opposed to each other. Consequently, the second cylindrical-stick-shaped connecting piece 184 can not pass through the gap between the projection 167a and the end portion of the connecting-member-attaching post 165 on the extended side thereof.<br>
As aforementioned, the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 of the article according to the third embodiment is assembled by connecting the first and second<br><br>
sliders 21a, 21b via the connected member 27 and tying an end of the string or the like 3 to the string-attaching portion 166 of the second slider 21b. In the first slider 21a according to the third embodiment, as aforementioned, when the slider 2 is stopped, the stopper pawl member 29 is urged so that the front-end-stopper pawl 29c-1 of the stopper pawl member 29 can project into the element guide channel 24a through the element engaging window 22a-1. Furthermore, in sliding operation of the slider 2, if the connecting member 27 is held and pulled up, the first cylindrical-stick-shaped connecting piece 183 of the connecting member 27 is lifted upward against an urge by the compressed spring 4 due to a pulling-up force. With this operation, the automatic stopper pawl member 29 rotates upward with the pin 5 inserted into the base end portion 29a as its rotation center so that that the front-end-stopper pawl 29c-1 is disengaged upward from the element guide channel 24a. As a result, an engagement of the front-end-stopper pawl 29c-1 entering in the gap between the elements E of the element row ER can be automatically released.<br>
If, for example, a knot of the string or the like 3 is loosed and the string or the like 3 is detached from the string-attaching portion 166 due to some sort of reasons, the sliding piece is slid in the sliding groove and the sliding piece inserting hole 162a in a direction of the post portion 164 against an urge of the compressed spring 168 by pushing the<br><br>
projection 167a of the second slider 21b. With this operation, there is formed a gap between the projection 167a and the end portion of the connecting-member-attaching post 165 on the extended side from which the second cylindrical-stick-shaped connecting piece 184 of the connecting member 27 is taken out. After that, if the pushing of the projection 1671 is released, the sliding piece returns to its original position and the gap becomes small.<br>
As aforementioned, by removing the second cylindrical-stick-shaped connecting piece 184, the second slider 21a is enabled to freely slide along the element rows ER, which forms an arbitrary opening portion of the string-end-fixing portion where the elements E do not engage each other between the second and first sliders 21b, 21a. Fingers can be inserted into the opening portion so as to pick up a loosed end of the string or the like 3 and securely tie it to the string-attaching portion 166 of the second slider 21b. After that, the sliding piece 167 is slid in a direction to the post portion 164 against the urge by pushing the projection 167a of the sliding piece 167 so that the gap is formed between the projection 167a and the end portion of the connecting-member-attaching post 165 on the extended side through which the second cylindrical-stick-shaped connecting piece 184 of the connecting portion 27 is inserted. Then, when the pushing of the projection 167a is released, the sliding<br><br>
piece 167 is automatically returns to its original position due to an urge of the compressed spring 168, which prevents the second cylindrical-stick-shaped connecting piece 184 from released from the connecting-member-attaching post 165.<br>
As aforementioned, it is easy in the third embodiment as well to attach the string or the like 3 again or replace it when the  string  or  the  like  3  is  detached  from  the connecting-member-attaching post 165 or cut off halfway. [Fourth Embodiment]<br>

The string-end-fixing portion according to the eighth embodiment having this structure is useful when the string or the like is required to be disposed on a front face side of the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10.<br>
Next, usage examples of the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion of the article according to the invention are specifically described hereinafter with reference to the drawings.   The following description<br><br>
describes some usage examples and the invention is not limited to these examples.<br>
Firstly, a specific example in which the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 of the article according to the first embodiment is attached to a sport shirt 100 is described with reference to the FIGS. 1-5, 26 and 27. As shown in these drawings, the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 is attached by sewing or the like along an opening portion linearly extending in an up-and-down direction formed in a chest portion of the sport shirt 100. As to an attaching method, a pair of the tapes with the elements T of the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 is sewed along the opening portion (opening). It is possible to sew a backing cloth together on a rear face side of the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion or it is possible to dispose the string or the like between a front cloth and the backing cloth of the sport shirt 100. The backing cloth is not necessary to be disposed on an all over the sport shirt 100. Furthermore, if the backing cloth is disposed in a tunnel shape along the string or the like 3, it works as a guide channel.<br>
On the other hand, one end 31 of the string or the like 3 is attached to the string-attaching portion 28 disposed on the lower plate 23b of the second slider 21b of the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 and the string or the like 3 is arranged to a back portion 105 over a shoulder portion 104<br><br>
of the sport shirt 100, then extended downward so that the other end 32 is fixed to a center of a bottom of the sport shirt 100. In an illustrated example, when the slider 2 is pulled up to a top end, the bottom 106 of the sport shirt 100 is in a shape not being pulled up as shown in FIG. 26. When the slider 2 is slid downward, the bottom 106 of the sport shirt 100 is in a shape being pulled up by the other end 32 of the string or the like 3.<br>
When the bottom 106 of the sport shirt 100 is pulled up by the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 according to the first embodiment which moves the string-end-fixing portion of the bottom of the sport shirt 100, a pulling tape 35 attached to the connecting member 27 of the slider 2 projected on a front face from a chest portion of the sport shirt 100 is held by a hand and pulled downward. By this pulling-down operation, an engagement of the stopper pawl member 29 in the elements E is automatically released, the first and second sliders 21a, 21b slide downward together on the element rows ER, which pulls down the string or the like 3 attached to the second slider 21b by a sliding distance of the slider 2. As a result, the other end 32 which is a bottom attaching end of the string or the like 3 is pulled up by the sliding distance of the slider 2, which pulls up the bottom portion 106 of the sport shirt 100 as shown in FIG. 27. At this time, if the pulling tape 35 is released from the hand, the stopper pawl member 29<br><br>
engages with the elements E with the front-end-stopper pawl 29c-1 inserted in the gap between two elements E at a stop position of the slider by the urge of the compressed spring 4 so as to disable any further movement of the slider 2.<br>
In the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 according to the first embodiment, the first and second sliders 21a, 21b is connected via the connecting portion 27b of the connecting member 27 with post portions 25a, 25b opposed to each other so as to move together at all times. As a result, in sliding operation of the slider 2, there is formed only a small gap piercing the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 between opposing portions of the first and second sliders 21a, 21b, Therefore, the element rows ER in front and back of the pair of the first and second sliders 21a, 21b are always engaged and closed. Thus, even if the slider 2 is moved to an arbitrary position on the element rows ER, the element rows ER are closed except the gap between the opposing portions of the first and second sliders 21a, 21b of the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10, which prevents easy penetration of dust or liquid from an outside.<br>
As aforementioned, according to the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 of the article according to the first embodiment, the string-end-fixing portion of the article in the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 is disposed at a portion where adjusting operation of the string-end-f ixing<br><br>
portion is applied while the handling portion 20 of the string-end-fixing portion 10 of the article is disposed at a portion easy to handle. With this, it is possible to move and adjust the string-end-fixing portion apart from a disposed position of the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 via the string or the like 3 one end 31 of which is attached to the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 to an arbitrary position. Furthermore, a position of the string-end-fixing portion after being moved is maintained.<br>
Furthermore, in the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 of the article according to the first embodiment, it is possible to form a gap having an appropriate distance between the opposing first and second sliders 21a, 21b by accordingly adjusting a length of the connecting member 27 in a sliding direction of the slider. With this gap, even if the string or the like 3 is loosed from the string-attaching portion 28 by any chance, fingers can be inserted through the gap to pick up an end of the string or the like and attach to the string-attaching portion 28. Furthermore, in a case that the connecting member 27 can be detached form the first and second sliders 21a, 21b, by separating the first and second sliders 21a, 21b, it is easy to attach the end of the string or the like 3 to the string-attaching portion 28.<br>
Further, as shown in FIGS. 28 and 29, pairs of the tapes with the elements T of the adjusters of the string-end-fixing<br><br>
portions 10 of the article are sewed along openings linearly formed in a transversal direction in abdominal parts of right and left front bodies of a blouse 110. At this time, ends 31 on one side of the strings or the like 3 are tied to the string-attaching portions 28 disposed on the bottom faces of the respective lower plates 23b of the sliders 2 of the adjusters of the string-end-fixing portions 10 disposed on right and left while the other ends 32 of the strings or the like 3 are respectively fixed on inner sides of lower abdominal parts below right and left auxiliary portions of the blouse 110. Lengths of the strings or the like 3 up to the string-end-fixing portions are set substantially equal to or slightly longer than distances between the sliders 2 disposed on right and left which are beneath and in closest positions to the auxiliary portions in the openings and attaching positions of the other ends of the strings or the like 3 beneath the auxiliary portions. Furthermore, at parts of the blouse 110 where the adjusters of the string-end-fixing portions 10 and the strings or the like 3 are disposed, backing cloths in a tunnel shape are sewed (not shown) and the strings or the like 3 are inserted in tunnel-shaped guide spaces between the backing cloths and front cloths.<br>
The blouse 110 in which the adjusters of the string-end-fixing portions 10 and strings or the like 3 are attached as aforementioned is, as shown in FIG. 28, in a state<br><br>
in which its abdominal portion is most outspreaded when the sliders of the adjusters of the string-end-fixing portions 10 on right and left are slid toward the attaching portions of the other ends 32 of the strings or the like 3. On the other hand, the blouse 110 is in a state in which its abdominal portion is most narrowed down as shown in FIG. 29 when the sliders 2 are closest on mating sides of the right and left front bodies. Due to sliding positions of the sliders, positions of the string-end-fixing portions are changed so as to change a narrowing-down degree of a circumference of the abdominal part of the blouse. At stop positions of the sliders 2, stopper pawl mechanisms are actuated so as to stop the sliding of the sliders 2. In this second usage example as well, regardless of sliding of the sliders 2, the element rows ER in front and back of the sliders 2 in a sliding direction are always engaged and closed. However, as to the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 of the article according to the invention, it may be required that the attaching portion of the adjusters of the string-end-fixing portions 10 can be opened and closed by sliding operation of the slider as an ordinary slide fastener. For example, when rolling up a window portion of a tent or the like and maintaining such a state, the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 of the article can be suitably used. It is preferable from a sanitary viewpoint to enable to open and close the attaching portion of the adjuster of the<br><br>
string-end-fixing portion 10 at the same time when opening and closing the window portion because a circulation of air in the tent becomes good.<br>
FIGS. 30-33 shows a usage example in which the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 of the article according to the third embodiment is adopted to a tent 120. The adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 is disposed apart from a window portion 122 of the tent main body 121. For example, it is disposed near an entrance 123. Therefore, an opening 124 in a linear shape is formed in a part around the entrance 123. Right and left tapes with the elements T are sewed or adhered along the opening 124. It is preferable that the tapes 1 are water proof tapes made of fiber tapes with thermoplastic synthetic resin coated thereon or of tapes of thermoplastic synthetic resin. According to the illustrated example, the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 is attached to the tent main body 121 so as to be adjoining to the entrance 123 in a rectangular shape longer in an up-and-down direction and extend in an up-and-down direction, wherein the first and second sliders 21a, 21b are mounted on the element rows ER of the tapes with the elements.<br>
The string or the like 3, one end of 31 of which is tied to a string-attaching portion 166 provided on the lower portion 163 of the second slider 21b, extends upward along an inner face of the tent main portion 121 up to above the window portion 122<br><br>
after turning its direction at a turning portion of a ceiling portion. Furthermore, the string or the like 3 is branched in right and left directions at a bifurcation portion 3a above the window portion 122. As shown in FIGS. 32 and 33, branched strings or the like 3b, 3c are guided along a top edge portion of the window portion 122, and then inserted and guided alternately in an inside and an outside of right and left side edge portions of a sheet 125 for opening and closing a window, a top end of which is positioned and fixed at the top edge portion of the window portion 122. Other end portions 32a, 32b is attached and fixed at right and left lower end edges of the sheet 125 for opening and closing the window.<br>
In the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10, as aforementioned, when the slider 2 is stopped, by the stopper pawl member 29 and the compressed spring 4 of the first slider 21a, the front-end-stopper pawl 29c-l of the stopper pawl member 29 is urged so that the front-end-stopper pawl 29c-1 of the stopper pawl member 29 can project into the element guide channel 24a through the element engaging window 22a-l. Furthermore, in sliding operation of the slider 2, if the connecting member 27 is held and pulled up, the connecting portion 27a of the connecting member 27 is lifted upward against an urge by the compressed spring 4 due to a pulling-up force. With this operation, the automatic stopper pawl member 29 rotates upward with the base end portion 29a of the stopper pawl<br><br>
member 29 as its rotation center so that that the front-end-stopper pawl 29c-l is disengaged upward from the element guide channel 24a. As a result, an engagement of the front-end-stopper pawl 29c-1 entering in the gap between the elements E of the element row ER can be automatically released. If, for example, a knot of the string or the like 3 is loosed and the string or the like 3 is detached from the string-attaching portion 166 due to some sort of reasons, by pushing the projection 167a of the second slider 21b, the sliding piece 167 is slid in the sliding groove and the sliding piece inserting hole 162a in a direction of the post portion 164 against an urge of the compressed spring 168 so as to remove the second cylindrical-stick-shaped connecting piece 184 of the connecting member 27 is taken out. Removing the second cylindrical-stick-shaped connecting piece 184 of the connecting member 27 allows the second slider 21b to freely slide along the element rows ER so s to f orro an arbitrary opening portion with respect to the first slider 21a where the elements E are not engaged. Fingers can be inserted into the opening portion so as to pick up a loosed end of the string or the like 3 and securely tie it to the string-attaching portion 166 of the second slider 21b. After that, the sliding piece 167 is slid in a direction to the post portion 164 against the urge by pushing the projection 167a of the sliding piece 167 so that the gap is formed between the projection 167a and the end portion<br><br>
of the connecting-member-attaching post 165 on the extended side through which the second cylindrical-stick-shaped connecting piece 184 of the connecting portion 27 is inserted-Then, when the pushing of the projection 167a is released, the sliding piece 167 is automatically returns to its original position due to an urge of the compressed spring 168, which prevents the second cylindrical-stick-shaped connecting piece 184 from released from the connecting-member-attaching post 165.<br>
Further, in this usage example, since the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion according to the third embodiment is used, the connecting member 27 connects the first and second sliders 21a, 21b so as to cover an entirety of the first and second sliders 21a, 21b. Therefore, if the connecting member 27 has a waterproof structure around the slider body 161, rain can not penetrate through the gap between the first and second sliders 21a, 21b even if it rains, thereby preventing an inside of the tent from being wet too much.<br>
In the aforementioned structure, when the window portion 122 is closed with the window-opening-and-closing sheet 125, as shown in FIG. 30, the slider 2 is slid up to a top end of the opening 124 where the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion is attached- At this time, the element rows ER of right and left faster stringers Tl are engaged and the opening 124 is closed. When the slider 2 is slid toward a lower end of the<br><br>
opening 124, one end 31 of the string or the like 3, the other end of which is attached to the string-attaching portion 166 of the second slider 21b, is pulled down. Consequently, the end portions 32a, 32b of the branched strings or the like 3b, 3c on right and left are pulled up via the turning portion of the ceiling portion of the tent main body 121 so that the sheet 125 for opening and closing the window is sequentially hauled up from a lower end side toward a top end side thereof so as to open the window portion 122 as shown in FIG. 31. Off course, the first slider 21a in this usage example comprises the stopper pawl mechanism which is not shown. Therefore, if a sliding of the slider 2 is stopped halfway so as to, for example, open the window portion 122 halfway and then, the connecting member 27 of the slider 2 is released from fingers, the slider does not move and an opening degree of the window portion 122 does not change, either.<br>
FIGS. 34 and 35 show an usage example of the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 according to the first embodiment which is used to adjust the string-end-fixing potion on a circumference of a cuff of a jacket or the like 130. According to these drawings, the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 is linearly attached on the jacket or the like 130 from its shoulder portion 130 to a part of a way to the cuff 131. On the other hand, the string or the like 3, one end 31 of which is fixed to a bottom face of the second<br><br>
slider 21 of the slider 2, is guided in a direction to the cuff along an inner side of the sleeve portion 131. Furthermore, the string or the like 3 is guided to make a circuit around a portion of the sleeve portion 133 to be narrowed down and the other end 32 thereof is fixed to an end. With this structure, when the slider 2 is pulled down at a lower end of a position of the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion, the sleeve portion 133 maintains its ordinary shape as shown in FIG. 34. On the contrary, when the slider 2 is pulled up at a higher position, the string or the like 3 are also pulled up by pulled-up movement of the slider 2. With this, a circuit diameter of the string or the like disposed at the portion of the sleeve portion 133 to be narrowed down becomes gradually small and the sleeve portion 133 is finally narrowed down as shown in FIG. 35-<br>
In the meantime, the aforementioned usage examples are described base on cases in which the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 of the article according to the first or third embodiment of the invention is used. However, the invention is not limited to these cases, but the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion of the article according to another embodiment or other adjuster of a string-end-fixing portion of a article of the invention can be used.<br>
As aforementioned, according to the adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion 10 of the article on the invention, it  is  possible  to  easily  change  a  portion  of  the<br><br>
string-end-fixing portion of the article by adding a slight improvement to a conventional slide fastener and in a case that the stopper pawl member is provided at the same time, an adjusted position of the string-end-fixing portion is automatically maintained. Furthermore, in a case that a portion where adjusting operation is carried out is disposed at a place easy to handle, even if the string-end-fixing portion of the article is apart from the portion where the adjusting operation is carried out, it is possible to easily and securely change the string-end-fixing portion. Furthermore, if the string or the like is loosed from the string-attaching portion, it is possible to easily attach it again . In the meantime, in the aforementioned embodiments, one end 31 of the string or the like 3 is tied and fixed to the string-attaching portion 28 on the lower plate 23b of the second slider 21b or the string-attaching post 210 of the cover body 203, however, it is possible to fix the end 31 by adhesion or sewing. Furthermore, as to the sliders and the stopper pawl mechanism, they are not limited to the aforementioned embodiment and it is possible to apply various designing modifications.<br>
The adjuster of the string-end-fixing portion of the article according to the invention can be effectively used when adjusting a size or length of an article that is needed to adjust its size by narrowing it down, such as clothing, caps or hats, groves, bags, tents or the like.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
