				<td>Impact-modified polymer composition<br>
The invention concerns an impact-modified polymer composition containing calcined talc and having improved mechanical properties and colour stability together with mouldings produced from the composition<br>
It is known that talc can be added as a reinforcing material to increase the rigidity and tensile strength, to increase the dimensional stability under temperature fluctuations and to improve the surface properties of polycarbonate compositions. In flame-resistant matenals the talc addition also serves as a flame proofing synergist.<br>
WO 00/148 074 describes flame-resistant and impact-modified polycarbonate compositions filled with talc. Calcined talc is not mentioned<br>
JP-A 0 731 6411 describes PC/ABS moulding compositions that contain 1 to 30 % of an aromatic monophosphate as flame retardant and 1 to 20 % of a calcined talc having an average particle diameter of 2 µm or less as filler. The moulding compositions are characterised by good processabihty, toughness and heat resistance together with excellent flame proofing. Expenence teaches, however, that monophosphates have a tendency towards bleeding and the undesirable formation of plate-out when processed by injection moulding.<br>
PC/SAN blends having polystyrene-grafted polybutadiene rubber as impact modifier and containing mineral fillers, e.g. talc, are known from WO 98/51737 Al. The use of calcined talc is not described The moulding compositions described are not flame resistant<br>
US-A 5 162 419 describes PC/ABS moulding compositions containing talc having an average particle size of 1 5 to 20 µm, preferably 4.0 to 10 µm, to improve the surface   appearance   of injection  moulded  parts.   The  moulding  compositions<br><br>
described are charactensed by a matt surface and improved mechanical properties and are not flame resistant.<br>
Flame-resistant PC/ABS compositions containing talc and phosphoric acid esters are known from JP-A 11/199768. The PC/ABS compositions described display an improved fire behaviour and are suitable in particular for thin-walled applications. Moulding compositions with calcined talc grades are not described.<br>
EP-A 0 758 003 A2 describes PC moulding compositions that can contain inorganic fillers as reinforcing material. Talc inter alia is cited as filler. The PC moulding compositions can also be flame resistant and are charactensed by an improved surface appearance and a high modulus of elasticity Polycarbonate blends are not descnbed m this specification.<br>
EP-A 0 391 413 describes PC/ABS moulding compositions containing inorganic fillers having special geometric properties, whereby the moulding compositions are distinguished by a low coefficient of linear and thermal expansion, high toughness under impact stress and high heat resistance. Non-calcined talc and clay materials are descnbed as fillers according to the invention Flame retardants are mentioned only generally m a list of additives.<br>
The disadvantage of the talc-containing PC/ABS blends known from the pnor art is that important mechanical properties such as weld line strength and toughness are decisively reduced by the addition of talc. Particularly in the case of talc grades that are not highly pure, there is also a detenoration in the inherent colour of the matenal and in the ageing stability, particularly in the colour stability of the compositions under exposure to UV light.<br>
It is therefore desirable to provide polycarbonate compositions to which talc is added by known means for the purpose of improving at least one matenal property, which<br>
are characterised by an advantageous combination of weld line strength and colour stability and which display excellent flame resistance.<br>
Surprisingly it was found that impact-modified polycarbonate moulding compositions containing a calcined talc and an oligomenc phosphoric acid ester as flame retardant display the desired range of properties.<br>
The invention therefore provides polycarbonate moulding compositions modified with graft polymer and containing oligomenc phosphoric acid esters having the formula (I),<br>

Monomers B.l are preferably mixtures of<br>
B.l.l 50 to 99 parts by weight of vinyl aromatics and/or ring-substituted vinyl aromatics (such as e.g styrene, a-methyl styrene, p-methyl styrene, p-chlorostyrene) and/or (meth)acrylic acid (C1-C8) alkyl esters (such as e.g. methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate) and<br>
B.1.2 1 to 50 parts by weight of vinyl cyanides (unsaturated nitnles such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitnle) and/or (meth)acryhc acid (C1-C8) alkyl esters (such as e.g. methyl methacrylate, n-butyl acrylate, t-butyl acrylate) and/or derivatives (such as anhydrides and imides) of unsaturated carboxyhc acids (for example maleic anhydride and N-phenyl maleimmide).<br>
Preferred monomers B.l.l are selected from at least one of the monomers styrene, Dimethyl styrene and methyl methacrylate, preferred monomers B 1.2 are selected from at least one of the monomers acrylonitrile, maleic anhydride and methyl methacrylate.<br>
Particularly preferred monomers are B.l.l styrene and B.1.2 acrylonitrile.<br>
Suitable graft bases B.2 for the graft polymers B are for example diene rubbers, EP(D)M rubbers, I e those based on ethylene/propylene and optionally diene, acrylate, polyurethane, silicone, chloroprene and ethylene/vmyl acetate rubbers.<br>
Preferred graft bases B 2 are diene rubbers (e g. based on butadiene, isoprene, etc.) or mixtures of diene rubbers or copolymers of diene rubbers or mixtures thereof with<br>
other copolymensable monomers (e.g. according to B.l 1 and B.l 2), preferably butadiene-styrene copolymers, with the proviso that the glass transition temperature of component B.2 is below 
Pure polybutadiene rubber is particularly preferred.<br>
Particularly preferred polymers B are e.g. ABS polymers (emulsion, bulk and suspension ABS), such as are described e.g in DE-OS 2 035 390 (=US-PS 3 644 574) or in DE-OS 2 248 242 (=GB-PS 1 409 275) or in Ullmann, Enzyklopadie der Techmschen Chemie, Vol. 19 (1980), p 280 ff. The gel component of graft base B.2 is at least 30 wt.%, preferably at least 40 wt.% (measured in toluene).<br>

Particularly suitable graft rubbers are also ABS polymers produced by redox initiation with an initiator system of organic hydroperoxide and ascorbic acid according to US-P 4 937 285.<br>
Since it is known that the graft monomers are not necessarily completely grafted onto the graft base during the graft reaction, graft polymers B according to the invention also refer to such products that are obtained by (co)polymensation of the graft monomers in the presence of the graft base and that co-accumulate during preparation.<br>
Suitable acrylate rubbers according to B 2 for the polymers B are preferably polymers of acrylic acid alkyl esters, optionally with up to 40 wt.%, relative to B 2, of other polymensable, ethylenically unsaturated monomers The preferred polymensable acrylic acid esters include C1-C8 alkyl esters, for example methyl,<br>
ethyl, butyl, n-octyl and 2-ethylhexyl ester; haloalkyl esters, preferably halogen Cr C8 alkyl esters, such as chloroethyl acrylate, and mixtures of these monomers.<br>
Monomers having more than one polymerisable double bond can be copolymensed for crosshnkmg. Preferred examples of crosslinkmg monomers are esters of unsaturated monocarboxylic acids with 3 to 8 C atoms and unsaturated monohydnc alcohols with 3 to 12 C atoms, or saturated polyols with 2 to 4 OH groups and 2 to 20 C atoms, such as eg. ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, allyl methacrylate; polyunsaturated heterocyclic compounds, such as e g. trivinyl and tnallyl cyanurate; polyfunctional vinyl compounds, such as divmyl and tnvmyl benzenes; but also tnallyl phosphate and diallyl phthalate.<br>

Particularly preferred crosslinkmg monomers are the cyclic monomers tnallyl cyanurate, tnallyl isocyanurate, tnacryloyl hexahydro-s-tnazme, tnallyl benzenes. The quantity of crosshnking monomers is preferably 0 02 to 5, particularly 0 05 to 2 wt %, relative to the graft base B.2<br>
In the case of cyclic crosshnkmg monomers with at least 3 ethylenically unsaturated groups it is advantageous to restrict the quantity to below 1 wt.% of the graft base B2.<br>
Preferred "other" polymerisable, ethylenically unsaturated monomers which can optionally serve to produce the graft base B.2 m addition to the acrylic acid esters are eg acrylonitnle, styrene, α-methyl styrene, acrylamides, vmyl C1-C6 alkyl ethers, methyl methacrylate, butadiene. Preferred acrylate rubbers as graft base B 2 are emulsion polymers displaying a gel content of at least 60 wt.%.<br>
Other suitable graft bases according to B.2 are silicone rubbers with graft-active sites, such as are described in DE-OS 3 704 657, DE-OS 3 704 655, DE-OS 3 631 540 and DE-OS 3 631 539.<br>
The gel content of graft base B 2 is determined at 25°C in a suitable solvent (M. Hoffmann, H. Kromer, R. Kuhn, Polymeranalytik I and II, Georg Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart 1977).<br>
The average particle size d50 is the diameter above and below which respectively 50 wt.% of the particles lie. It can be determined by ultracentnfuge measurement (W. Scholtan, H. Lange, Kolloid, Z. und Z. Polymere 250 (1972), 782-1796).<br>

C.l 1 50 to 99, preferably 60 to 80 parts by weight of vmyl aromatics and/or ring-substituted vmyl aromatics, such as e.g. styrene, a-methyl styrene, p-methyl styrene, p-chlorostyrene), and/or (meth)acrylic acid (C1-C8) alkyl esters, such as e.g methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate), and<br>
