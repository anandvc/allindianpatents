METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR FILLING AND VACUUM SEALING PAIRS OF CONTAINERS IN THE FORM OF ENVELOPES OR BAGS<br>
The present invention relates to a method of and an apparatus for filling and vacuum sealing of pairs of containers in the form of envelopes or bags fed in the form of a continuous web to filling stations.<br>
In the field of packages, above all as far as goods of large consumption are concerned, widely used are envelopes of flexible plastic material that are directly heat-sealable or envelopes of aluminium foil made heat-sealable by the presence of a thin coating of plastic material.<br>
In both cases the surface designed to remain externally visible is usually printed with inscriptions for the identification of the contained goods.<br>
Of the different products marketed in containers of this type, a great number of them requires aseptic envelopes or bags to be vacuum sealed for better conservation in the course of time of the product held therein.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide    a       method    of   and        an      apparatus      for      feeding      and<br><br>
WO 02/070349	PCT/IT02/00106<br>
2<br>
filling with goods in a liquid state, in powder or in pieces, pairs of containers of flexible material open at the top and having their respective openings specularly facing each other, connected to each other by a joining strip/ and to carry out the vacuum sealing of the opening of the thus filled containers.<br>
According to the invention, the intended object is<br>
achieved  by  modifying  a  simple  and  relatively<br>
convenient  automatic  apparatus  of  a  type  already<br>
available on the market, in which a device is inserted<br>
apt  to  receive  within  a  chamber  that  can  be<br>
hermetically closed,  a limited number of containers<br>
previously filled with the products whereafter the<br>
vacuum is created in said chamber and the container<br>
opening heat-sealed in the chamber itself.<br>
The webs of paired containers facing each other that can be used in the filling and vacuum-sealing method according to the present invention can consist of any known type of paired containers, i.e. bags or simple envelopes/ envelopes with bellows-like bottom, envelopes with two side bellows, or envelopes with side bellows and simplified bottom bellows to allow vertical self-support of the container.<br>
Envelopes with side bellows are preferred because they allow a greater automatic opening out of the flaps<br><br>
WO 02/070349	PCT/IT02/00106<br>
3<br>
of the upper container opening on filling.<br>
Since the invention particularly aims at meeting the requirements of business concerns even of limited size that carry out the filling o£ containers with products,  the  containers  are  supplied  by  firms specialised in manufacturing bags in the form of a continuous  web  of  paired  containers  having  upper openings facing each other and wound up in the form of a bobbin or concertina-folded in packaging boxes. This feature makes the production by the user customer easier because the latter must only attend to carrying out the final hermetic seal for closing the container after having filled the same.  Thus  also the final controls are reduced in favour of a more practical operation.   From  the  point  of  view  o£  surface contamination too, the closed bag ia more reliable than the material on a reel.<br>
The invent ion is described herebelow in more detail having reference to the accompanying drawings that show the arrangement of the sequence of characteristic stations in an apparatus using said webs of paired containers, apt to carry out vacuum sealing of the containers in accordance with the contemplated method.<br>
In the drawings:<br><br>
WO 02/070349	PCT/IT02/00106<br>
4<br>
-	Pig. 1 is a schematic perspective top view of<br>
the apparatus for feeding, filling and vacuum sealing<br>
containers  embodying  the  method  according  to  the<br>
invention,-<br>
-	Fig. 2 is a perspective side view, by way of<br>
example only, of a pair of bags of the type with side<br>
bellows,  joined to each other by an intermediate<br>
connecting strip, which are part of a continuous web of<br>
bags to be fed to the apparatus schematically shown in<br>
Fig. 1 in which, for illustrative purposes, the right<br>
bag has a filling opening which is only partly raised<br>
whereas in the left bag the opening is completely open;<br>
-	Fig. 3 is a plan view, by way of example, of a<br>
length of the bag web of the type shown in Pig. 2, yet<br>
in which the bags are sealed at the bottom in such a<br>
manner that a bellow is formed which is apt to keep the<br>
filled and sealed bag in a vertical position on the<br>
display shelves; and<br>
-	Figs. 4 and 5 show, in a plan, and perspective<br>
view and still by way of example, a length of web of a<br>
further type of bags also provided with side bellows<br>
and a bottom bellows apt to keep the filled and sealed<br>
bag in a vertical position on the display shelves.<br>
In Fig. 1 the apparatus altogether identified by A, is in its general features of known type.<br><br>
WO 02/070349	PCT/ITO2/O0106<br>
5<br>
In the case under review, the apparatus ia fed with a web 2 of paired containers 3, 31 of flexible material joined to each other by an intermediate strip 20 and concertina-folded inside a packaging box 5, as supplied from the manufacturer of the containers.<br>
The apparatus is provided with a rod-shaped support 6 descending gradually until close to the packaging box 5 where is centered the strip 2 0 that keeps in a connected relationship the web of paired containers 3, 31 folded up in the box itself (see also Figs. 2 and 3) . On proceeding towards the filling and sealing stations, the containers 3, 31 moved by a drive or transport unit 10 are arranged on either side of support 6 which, downstream, at position 8, progressively widens out until it becomes, at the transport unit 10, a track of practically the same transverse width as strip 20.<br>
The transport unit 10 is preferably made up of an upper roller 11 provided with linear jutting out elements opposite which are the corresponding cavities of an underlying nip-roller so as to pluck the material of the union strip 2 0 as shown under reference 14 in Figs 2 and 3, thereby achieving a positive and regular forward movement of the containers 3-3 '. The containers reach the filling stations 25 with the flaps of their<br><br>
WO 02/070349	PCT/TT02/00106<br>
6<br>
respective openings that already having been widened out upstream through the action of opening-out members 24 of a known type.<br>
According to the invention, between the filling station 25 and the end station 40 for recovery of the strip 2 0 and the collection of the filled and sealed containers released from each other, the insertion of an additional work station is provided, which station, identified by 30 in Fig. 1, usefully completes the task of the existent apparatus in accordance with the intended object.<br>
The additional station 30, shown only schematically, consists of a chamber 32 which can be opened and re-closed with a hermetic-seal lid 34 and in which a vacuum condition can be created.<br>
Chamber 30 is provided with a relatively limited<br>
capacity, i.e. 1 to 4 pairs of containers at the most,<br>
depending on their transverse size, so as to limit the<br>
creation of the vacuum condition within conveniently<br>
reduced periods of time, and it is internally provided<br>
with one  or more pairs of  thermoelectric jaws  to<br>
operate the hermetic sealing of the filled pairs of<br>
containers  inside which,  as  desired,  the products<br>
remain protected under the condition of a very limited<br>
presence of air. Once the vacuum sealing of the upper<br><br>
WO 02/070349	PCT/IT02/00106<br>
7<br>
opening of the containers has been carried out, the lid 34 is removed and a pliers device draws the sealed envelopes out of the chamber and introduces therein other just filled envelopes. The pairs of already-sealed envelopes reach the end station 40 where the union strip 20 can be recovered and the individual or paired envelopes fall into the respective packaging boxes for despatch.<br>
As already stated, the containers for use in this apparatus can be of various types, among which there are those provided with side bellows as shown in Fig.<br>
2,	or those of the vertical self-supporting type, as<br>
shown in Fig. 3 or in Fig. 4.<br>
For obtaining the type of envelope shown in Fig.<br>
3,	the side ends of the web can be pressed by heatable<br>
jaws in order to perform,  at the bottom of each.<br>
container, the conjunction of all heat-sealable facing<br>
surfaces,   thereby  forming  two  inclined  sealing<br>
connections 23,  23'  that,  starting from the sealing<br>
closure 22 of the bottom of the final bag, connect with<br>
the side sealing closures 21r 21' of same so as to form<br>
a bellows in replacement of known bellows of curved<br>
conformation.<br>
To obtain a bag as shown in Fig. 4, the four sides of the bottom have a sealing closure 22 involving the<br><br>
WO 02/070349	PCT/IT02/00106<br>
8<br>
whole perimeter of the bottom itself and the lower edge of the four sealing closures 21 of the upright walls so that the bottom rest surface essentially corresponds to the whole surface of the bottom itself.<br><br>
