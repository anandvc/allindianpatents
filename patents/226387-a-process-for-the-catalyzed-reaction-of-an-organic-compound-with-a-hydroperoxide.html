The present invention relates to a process for reacting an organic compound with a hydroperoxide, in which at least two different titanium zeolite catalysts are used. At least two of the different catalysts are physically separated from one another, for example by the different catalysts being located in different reactors which are connected in series or being located in a single reactor and being physically separated from one another in this reactor.<br>
The reaction of organic compounds with hydroperoxides is treated in numerous documents of the prior art. However, these generally discuss only processes in which a single catalyst is used for the reaction of the organic compound with a hydroperoxide.<br>
WO 00/07965 by the applicant relates, for example, to a process for reacting an organic compound with a hydroperoxide, in which it is cursorily mentioned, inter alia, that one or more suitable catalysts can be added to improve the efficiency of this reaction. However, WO 00/07965 gives no further information as to how a process in which more than one catalyst is used could be configured. Accordingly, the explicitly described embodiments of this document relate to a process in which the organic compound is brought into contact with one heterogeneous catalyst.<br>
WO 01/72729 by the applicant likewise relates to a process for reacting an organic compound with a hydroperoxide, which is directed at very efficient regeneration of the catalyst. In this context, it describes, inter alia, embodiments in which, apart from the necessary presence of at least two parallel reactors, at least two reactors are connected in series. In this process, catalysts of the same type but of differing reactivity can be present in different parallel reactors. WO 01/72729 gives no information about differing catalysts.<br>
WO 01/10855 by the applicant likewise concerns a process for reacting an organic compound with a hydroperoxide, in which inhomogeneous reaction conditions are<br><br>
generated. In the process described there, both the pH and the temperature and possibly also the pressure are altered in the reaction medium. WO 01/10855 makes 10 reference to a variation of the catalyst used in the process.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides a process for the catalyzed reaction of in organic compound with a hydroperoxide in at least one reactor using at least two different zeolite catalysts, wherein at least two of the different zeolite catalysts are used physically separated from one another.<br>
Zeolite catalysts used in the process of the present invention can either be the zeolitic material itself or shaped bodies produced from the zeolitic material or nixtures of zeolitic material as such and shaped bodies produced from the zeolitic naterial. The term "different zeolite catalysts" as used in the context of the present nvention can therefore relate to differences between zeolitic materials and also to lifferences in respect of the properties of the shaped bodies.<br>
Differences in respect of the zeolitic materials are, for example, the titanium content of the zeolitic material; the content of chemical elements other than titanium; the porosity of the zeolite, with the porosity differing, for example, in terms of the geometry of the pores of the different zeolite catalysts and these accordingly having, for example, differing pore volumes, differing pore diameters or differing surface areas of the pores; the zeolites can likewise differ in respect of the pore distribution; the crystal structure of the zeolitic material; the surface modification of the zeolitic material; the acidity of the zeolitic material.<br>
Differences in respect of the shaped bodies are, for example,<br>
the geometry of the shaped catalyst bodies;<br>
the porosity of the shaped bodies, with the porosity differing, for example, n terms of the geometry of the pores of the different shaped bodies and these accordingly having, for example, differing pore volumes, differing pore diameters or differing surface areas of the pores; the shaped bodies can likewise differ in espect of the pore distribution;<br>
the mechanical strength of the shaped bodies;<br>
the binder content of the shaped catalyst bodies;<br><br>
the type of binder material used for producing the shaped catalyst bodies;<br>
the content of catalytically active zeolitic material in the shaped catalyst<br>
bodies;<br>
the carbon content of the shaped bodies.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the term "different zeolite catalysts" also encompasses two catalyst mixtures which differ from one another and which can each comprise at least two different shaped bodies or at least two different zeolitic materials as such or at least one shaped body and at least one zeolitic material as such. Different catalyst mixtures are thus mixtures as described above which differ in terms of either<br>
at least one of the distinguishing features described above by way of<br>
example for the zeolitic material or the shaped bodies,<br>
or the mixing ratio of the components present in the mixture<br>
or both at least one of the distinguishing features described above by way<br>
of example for the zeolitic material or the shaped bodies and also the<br>
mixing ratio of the components present in the mixture.<br>
The term "physically separately" as used for the purposes of the present invention refers to embodiments in which the apparatus in which the reaction is carried out has at least two compartments of which one contains a zeolite catalyst and at least one other compartment contains at least one further zeolite catalyst which differs from the zeolite catalyst present in the first compartment.<br>
Such compartmentalization can, for example, be realized in a single reactor, with various embodiments of the compartmentalization once again being possible.<br>
Thus, the compartmentalization can, for example, be achieved in a single reactor by two or more different zones of the reactor being provided with different zeolite catalysts. Here, the different zones of the reactor can be separated from one another by means of at least one mechanical separation device so as to physically separate the different zeolite catalysts. Accordingly, one or more identical or different mechanical separation devices can be provided between two zones. Li the case of three or more zones, the same or different separation devices can be provided for separating the various zones.<br><br>
Examples of mechanical separation devices are sieve plates such as sheet-metal sieve plates or mesh plates and ordered packing or packing element knitteds as used, for example, in distillation columns, which according to a particularly preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention are used when the catalysts are used as shaped bodies. Thus, for example, if shaped catalyst bodies of a first geometry are used in a first zone, shaped catalyst bodies of a second geometry are used in a second zone and shaped catalyst bodies of a third geometry are used in a third zone, the sieve plates which are, for example, preferably used for separating the zones can differ in their mesh opening which can be matched to the geometry of the respective shaped bodies.<br>
Likewise, the materials of which the mechanical separation devices are made can differ from one another.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a process as described above in which the different catalysts are physically separated from one another by means of at least one mechanical separation device.<br>
The compartmentalization according to the present invention in a single reactor can also be realized without additional mechanical separation devices. This is possible, for example, by means of a special configuration of the interior wall or walls of the reactor which have, for example, spaced depressions, recesses or similar configurations in which the different catalysts can be accommodated.<br>
Li achieving the compartmentalization according to the present invention, it is likewise possible for the individual compartments containing the different zeolite catalysts to adjoin one another directly without there being a spacing between the different zeolite catalysts. It is thus possible to equip the reactor with a first zeolite catalyst in a first zone and a second zeolite catalyst which differs from the first zeolite catalyst in a directly adjoining second zone, with the two catalyst zones having one or more shared interfaces. At the interface between the two zones, mixing of the two different zeolite catalysts can occur, as long as it is ensured that there is an inhomogeneity in the zeolite catalyst distribution over the two zones. For the purposes of the present invention, this term "inhomogeneity in the zeolite catalyst distribution" refers to a configuration in which at least part of the first zone consists predominantly, preferably exclusively, of the first zeolite catalyst and at<br><br>
least part of the second zone consists predominantly, preferably exclusively, of the second zeolite catalyst.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, this is achieved, for example, by means of a structured bed of different catalysts. A first zone of the reactor is in this case provided by a bed of a first zeolite catalyst which represents the first catalyst compartment. A second zone of the reactor is subsequently produced by pouring the second zeolite catalyst, which differs from the first, onto the first compartment to form a second compartment. Likewise, a third compartment or further compartments can also be added, with a zeolite catalyst which is different from both the first catalysts or from one of the first two catalysts being able to be used in the third compartment or a further compartment. This way of producing catalyst zones is referred to as "a structured bed" for the purposes of the present invention.<br>
Compared to conventional processes in which a reactor is equipped with only a single zeolite catalyst, this structured bed offers the advantage, inter alia, that targeted selection of the catalysts used in various reactor zones enables, for example, the conversion in the reaction to be influenced in a positive way. For example, in a continuous process in which the reactants hydroperoxide and organic compound are conveyed through the reactor and pass through the various reactor zones provided with the different zeolite catalysts, the individual catalysts can be matched to the progress of the reaction.<br>
It is thus possible, for example, to choose the zeolite catalyst in a first zone of the reactor in which the concentration of unreacted reactants is high in such a way that the conversion, for example in an exothermic reaction, is just so high that the heat evolved can still be removed. In a next reactor zone in which the concentration of the reactants is lower, it is then possible to use a zeolite catalyst which achieves, for example, a higher conversion, i.e. is more active in respect of the reaction. The inhomogeneity in the concentrations of the reactants hydroperoxide and organic compound as they pass through the reactor and the resulting inhomogeneity in the reaction mixture comprising the reactants hydroperoxide and organic compound and the reaction product or products formed therefrom can accordingly be compensated by appropriate selection of different zeolite catalysts and thus an inhomogeneity in, for example, the catalyst activity over the reactor.<br><br>
For example, it is possible for the reaction of hydroperoxide with the organic compound to form products which are able to react further either with hydroperoxide or the organic compound or both with hydroperoxide and the organic compound to form an undesirable downstream product. In this case, the concentration of desired product and thus the probability of undesirable downstream product being formed becomes ever greater as the reaction mixture passes through the reactor. Accordingly, it is possible, for example, to use a first zeolite catalyst in a first reactor zone and in a second reactor zone to use a different zeolite catalyst which still catalyzes the reaction of hydroperoxide and organic compound but is less active in respect of the further reaction to the undesirable downstream product than is the zeolite catalyst in the first reactor zone.<br>
Preference is given, for example, to using a titanium zeolite catalyst having a high titanium content and accordingly a high activity in respect of the reaction of the organic compound with hydroperoxide in a first compartment of the reactor and a titanium zeolite catalyst having a lower titanium content than the first titanium zeolite catalyst in a second compartment of the reactor. In a more preferred embodiment, the two titanium zeolite catalysts have the same crystal structure. In a likewise preferred embodiment, the two titanium zeolite catalysts have different crystal structures, for example a crystal structure of the MFI type in the case of the catalyst in the first compartment and a crystal structure of the MWW type in the case of the catalyst in the second compartment. It is likewise possible for the catalyst in the first compartment to have a crystal structure of the MWW the and the catalyst in the second compartment to have a crystal structure of the MFI type. In these embodiments, particular preference is given to the reaction mixture firstly passing through the first compartment and subsequently passing through the second compartment on its way through the reactor.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a process as described above in which the reaction of the organic compound is carried out in a single reactor.<br>
The present invention likewise provides a reactor for the reaction of an organic compound with a hydroperoxide, comprising at least two physically separate, different zeolite catalysts.<br>
The compartmentalization according to the present invention can also be achieved, for example, by use of at least two reactors connected in series, with at least one<br><br>
zeolite catalyst being used for the reaction in a first reactor and at least one further zeolite catalyst which differs from the zeolite catalyst used in the first reactor being used for the reaction in at least one further reactor.<br>
In this embodiment, it is possible, for example, to use a first catalyst in at least one first reactor and in at least one second reactor to use a second catalyst different from the first catalyst, with the catalyst in the first reactor being able to be, for example, in the form of zeolitic material or shaped bodies or a mixture of zeolitic material and shaped bodies and the catalyst in the second reactor being able to be in the form of zeolitic material or shaped bodies or a mixture of zeolitic material and shaped bodies.<br>
Likewise, the catalyst can, for example, be used as a mesh catalyst based on inert woven meshes such as inert woven meshes made of metals, plastics, aluminum oxides, glass fibers, carbon fibers and/or graphite. Based on the weight of the zeolite catalyst, such mesh catalysts preferably have an alkali metal content of less than 500 ppm. These mesh catalysts are preferably produced by a process in which at least one zeolite, preferably at least one titanium zeolite, is crystallized onto an inert woven mesh. Mesh catalysts of this type and ways of producing them are described in EP 0 883 439 Bl, whose relevant contents are fully incorporated by reference into the disclosure of the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides an assembly of reactors connected in series for the reaction of an organic compound with a hydroperoxide, which comprises at least two reactors and in which at least two reactors contain different zeolite catalysts.<br>
Regardless of whether one or more reactors are used for the reaction of the organic compound with hydroperoxide in the process of the present invention, the reaction conditions in each reactor are preferably selected so that the reaction mixture consists of a single phase and is liquid.<br>
Zeolite catalysts which can be used for the purposes of the present invention are subject to no restrictions, as long as it is ensured that the catalysts catalyze the reaction of the organic compound with a hydroperoxide.<br><br>
It is known that zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates which have ordered channel and cage structures and have micropores which are preferably smaller than about 0.9 nm. The network of such zeolites is made up of Si04 and AIO4 tetrahedra which are joined by shared oxygen bridges. An overview of the known structures may be found, for example, in W.M. Meier, D.H. Olson and Ch. Baerlocher, "Atlas of Zeolithe Structure Types", Elsevier, 5th edition, Amsterdam 2001.<br>
Zeolites which contain no aluminum and in which the Si(IV) in the silicate lattice is partly replaced by titanium as Ti(IV) are also known. These titanium zeolites, in particular those having a crystal structure of the MFI type, and possible ways of preparing them are described, for example, in EP-A 0 311 983 or EP-A 405 978. In addition to silicon and titanium, such materials can further comprise additional elements such as aluminum, zirconium, tin, iron, cobalt, nickel, gallium, boron or small amounts of fluorine. In the zeolite catalysts which are preferably regenerated in the process of the present invention, the titanium of the zeolite can be partly or completely replaced by vanadium, zirconium, chromium or niobium or a mixture of two or more thereof. The molar ratio of titanium and/or vanadium, zirconium, chromium or niobium to the sum of silicon and titanium and/or vanadium and/or zirconium and/or chromium and/or niobium is generally in the range from 0.01:1 to 0.1:1.<br>
Specific mention may be made of titanium-, germanium-, tellurium-, vanadium-, chromium-, niobium- and zirconium-containing zeolites having a pentasil zeolite structure, in particular the types which can be assigned X-ray-crystallographically to the ABW, ACO, AEI, AEL, AEN, AET, AFG, AFI, AFN, AFO, AFR, AFS, AFT, AFX, AFY, AHT, ANA, APC, APD, AST, ATN, ATO, ATS, ATT, ATV, AWO, AWW, BEA, BIK, BOG, BPH, BRE, CAN, CAS, CFI, CGF, CGS, CHA, CHI, CLO, CON, CZP, DAC, DDR, DFO, DFT, DOH, DON, EAB, EDI, EMT, EPI, ERI, ESV, EUO, FAU, FER, GIS, GME, GOO, HEU, IFR, ISV, ITE, JBW, KFI, LAU, LEV, LIO, LOS, LOV, LTA, LTL, LTN, MAZ, MEI, MEL, MEP, MER, MFI, MFS, MON, MOR, MSO, MTF, MTN, MTT, MTW, MWW, NAT, NFS, NON, OFF, OSI, PAR, PAU, PHI, RHO, RON, RSN, RTE, RTH, RUT, SAO, SAT, SBE, SBS, SBT, SFF, SGT, SOD, STF, STI, STT, TER, THO, TON, TSC, VET, VFI, VNI, VSV, WIE, WEN, YUG, ZON structures and to mixed structures derived from two or more of the abovementioned structures. It is also conceivable to use titanium-containing zeolites having the ITQ-4, SSZ-24, TTM-1, UTD-1, CIT-1 or CIT-5 structure in the process of the present invention. Further<br><br>
titanium-containing zeolites which may be mentioned are those of the ZSM-48 or ZSM-12 structure.<br>
Titanium zeolites, in particular those having a crystal structure of the MFI type, and possible ways of preparing them are described, for example, in WO 98/55228, EP-A 0 311 983 or EP-A 0 405 978, whose relevant contents are fully incorporated by reference into the disclosure of the present patent application. Titanium zeolites having, for example, a crystal structure of the MWW type and possible ways of preparing them are described in WO 02/28774 A2 or in Wu et al., „Hydrothermal Synthesis of a novel Titanosilicate with MWW Topology", Chemistry Letters 2000, S. 774-775, whose relevant contents are fully incorporated by reference into the disclosure of the present patent application. For example, specific syntheses of Ti-MWW are described in examples 1 to 5 of WO 02/28774 A2.<br>
In general, the zeolitic material which has been separated from its mother liquor is dried at generally from 80 to 160°C, preferably from 90 to 145°C and particularly preferably from 100 to 130°C, and subsequently preferably calcined at generally from 400 to 750°C, preferably from 450 to 600°C and particularly preferably from 490 to 530°C. In further embodiments of the process of the present invention, the zeolite is, after it has been separated off from the mother liquor, brought into contact with a water-containing composition. This contacting can likewise be carried out for the first time or repeated after the above-described drying procedure and/or the above-described calcination. In these cases, one or more of the above-described treatments for concentration or for separation can follow the contacting with the water-containing composition. As water-containing composition, preference is given, for example to water itself. It is likewise possible to use aqueous amine solutions in which the amine or amines present can be ammonia, an organic aliphatic amine or a quaternary ammonium hydroxide, where the nitrogen in these nitrogen compounds can bear, for example, methyl, ethyl or propyl radicals as alkyl radicals and two or more different alkyl radicals may also be bound to one nitrogen. The contacting with, preferably, water itself generally takes place at from room temperature to 750°C, preferably from 100 to 250°C and particularly preferably from 120 to 175°C, and is preferably for a period of from 12 to 48 hours. This contacting very particularly preferably takes place in an autoclave.<br><br>
If the zeolite has been dried and/or calcined after being separated off from the mother liquor and has subsequently been brought into contact with a water-containing composition, another drying and/or calcination step(s) can follow. This drying is generally carried out at from 80 to 160°C, preferably from 90 to 145°C and particularly preferably from 100 to 130°C. The subsequent calcination which preferably occurs is generally carried out at from 400 to 750°C, preferably from 450 to 600°C, and particularly preferably from 490 to 530°C.<br>
Jn addition to or instead of contacting with the water-containing composition, the zeolite can be washed with, for example, hydrogen peroxide solution, preferably low-sulfur hydrogen peroxide solution. It is likewise possible to treat the zeolitic material with alkali metal ions to convert the zeolites from the H form into the cationic form.<br>
It is known that titanium zeolites having, for example, an MWW or MFI structure can be identified via a particular X-ray diffraction pattern and also via a lattice vibration band in the infrared region (IR) at about 960 cm', and in this way differ from alkali metal titanates or crystalline and amorphous TiOa phases.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, particular preference is given to using titanium zeolites as zeolite catalysts.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a process as described above in which the two or more different zeolite catalysts are titanium zeolite catalysts.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment of the present invention, the zeolite catalysts used differ in their titanium content. Thus, the present invention encompasses, for example, embodiments in which one zeolite catalyst contains no titanium and at least one further zeolite catalyst is a titanium zeolite catalyst. In terms of the difference in the titanium content, preference is given to embodiments in which two titanium zeolite catalysts having different titanium contents are used.<br>
If, for example, preferably two titanium zeolite catalysts having different titanium contents are used, these titanium zeolite catalysts have the chemical composition (I) or (II):<br>
x • Ti02 (1-x) • Si02	(I)<br><br>
where 0.0001 
X • Ti02 y • M2O3 (1 -x-2y) • SiOz	(II)<br>
where 0.0001 
Further details of the zeolite structure types such as the structure type MFI, MEL or the structure type MWW may be found in the abovementioned reference W.M. Meier, D.H. Olson and Ch. Baerlocher "Atlas of Zeolite Structure Types", Elsevier, 5*. Edition, pp. 202 and 203, Amsterdam 2001.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a process as described above in which the different zeolite catalysts differ in their titanium content.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, preference is given to using Ti zeolites having an MFI structure, MEL structure, MFI/MEL mixed structure or MWW structure. Further preference is given specifically to the Ti-containing zeolite catalysts generally referred to as "TS-1", "TS-2", "TS-3", and also Ti zeolites having a framework structure isomorphous with beta-zeolite. For the purposes of the present invention, very particular preference is given to zeolite catalysts having the TS-1 structure or the Ti-MWW structure.<br>
In a likewise preferred embodiment, zeolite catalysts which differ in their structure type are used as different zeolite catalysts. For examples of possible structure types, reference may be made to the structure t5'pes mentioned above.<br>
Examples of preferred zeolite catalysts which differ in their structure are zeolite catalysts of the TS-1 type and of the Ti-MWW type.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a process as described above in which the titanium zeolite catalysts differ in respect of the titanium content or the zeolite structure or both the titanium content and the zeolite structure.<br><br>
According to a further preferred process of the present invention, a titanium silicalite catalyst, especially preferably of structure type TS-1, is employed as catalyst. Different catalysts are therefore catalysts which have, e.g., a different content of titanium or different pore volumes or different specific surfaces or different contents of titanium and different pore volumes or different contents of titanium and different specific surfaces or different contents of titanium and different specific surfaces and different pore volumes. Li case shaped catalyst bodies are produced from the titanium silicalite material in the process of the present invention, the different shaped bodies differ from each other with respect to, e.g., the type of the zeolite material or the titanium content or the Si02 content or the specific surface or the pore volume or the packed weight or the hardness such as the lateral pressure resistance or with respect to two or more of these parameters. Therefore, e.g., two different shaped bodies comprising different titanium silicalite materials or the same titanium silicalite material can be used in a single reactor, hi case they comprise the same titanium silicalite material, the shaped bodies can differ with respect to the content of titanium silicalite and/or at least one of the above-mentioned parameters. In case they comprise different titanium silicalite materials, the shaped bodies can additionally differ with the respect to the content of titanium silicalite and/or at least one of the above-mentioned parameters.<br>
Among the reactions of organic compounds with hydroperoxides which are possible in the process of the present invention, mention may be made by way of example of the following:<br>
the epoxidation of olefins, e.g. the preparation of propene oxide from propene and H2O2 or from propene and mixtures which release H2O2 in situ;<br>
hydroxylations, e.g. the hydroxylation of monocyclic, bicyclic or polycyclic aromatics to form monosubstituted, disubstituted or more highly substituted hydroxyaromatics, for example the reaction of phenol and H2O2 or of phenol and mixtures which release H2O2 in situ to give hydroquinone; oxime formation from ketones in the presence of H2O2 or mixtures which release H2O2 in situ and ammonia (ammoximation), for example the preparation of cyclohexanone oxime from cyclohexanone; the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation.<br><br>
In the process of the present invention, preference is given to reacting organic compounds which have at least one C-C double bond. The present invention accordingly provides a process as described above in which the organic compound has at least one C-C double bond.<br>
