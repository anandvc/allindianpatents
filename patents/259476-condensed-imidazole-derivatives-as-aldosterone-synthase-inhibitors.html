Q<br>
(la),<br>
in which R, R\ R^, R^, Q, m and n have the meanings indicated atxive for compounds of the formula (1), and where the above preferences apply analogously. * designates an asymmetric carbon atom.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) or (la) which possess at least one asymmetric cgrbon atom can exist in the form of optically pure enantiomers, mixtures of enantiomers, or racemates. Compounds having a second asymmetric carbon atom can exist in the form of optically pure diastereomers, mixtures of diastereomers, diastereomeric racemates, mixtures of diastereomeric racemates, or meso compounds. The invention embraces all of these fom^s. Mixtures of enantiomers, racemates, mixtures of diastereomers, diastereomeric racemates, or mixtures of diastereomeric racemates can be fractionated by conventional methods, such as by racemate resolution, column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, HPLC and <br>
The compounds of the formuia (la) have at least one asymmetric carbon atom, which is labelled "*". A compound of the formula (la) Is to be understood as a compound having a specific configuration around the designated asymmetric carbon atom. If a synthesis method is used which leads to racemic compounds, the racemate resolution is carried out in accordance with conventional methods, such as via a chiral HPLC column. Compounds of the formula (la) as described in the present invention exhibit a pronounced aldosterone synthase and/or 11-p-hydroxylase inhibitory activity and a low aromatase inhibitory activity. The aforementioned aromatase inhibitory activity can, as the skilled worker is well aware and as described below, be comfortably determined using the commercial Cyp19 enzyme inhibition kit, preferably the Cyp19/methoxy-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin (MFC) high throughput inhibition kit (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) as described hereafter.. In the abovementioned inhibition kit, compounds of the fonnula (la) have an activity which is at least 10 times lower preferably 20 times lower, but more preferably 40 times lower than the compounds of the formula (la) with the opposite configuration around the asymmetric carbon atom labelled "*". A lower inhibiting activity corresponds to a higher ICsc value.<br>

The expression "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" embraces salts with organic or inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, formic acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methane- sulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid and the like. Salts of compounds containing salt- forming groups are, in particular, acid addition salts, salts with bases or else, if appropriate, if two or more salt-forming groups are present, are mixed salts or inner salts.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) or (la) can be prepared in an analogous manner to the preparation processes disclosed perse in the literature by JP63145286 (Scheme). <br>

Details of the specific preparation variants can be found in ttie examples.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) or (la) can also be prepared in optically pure form. Separation into antipodes is possible by methods known per se, either, preferably, at an early stage in synthesis, by salt formation with an optically active acid such as, for example, (+)- or (-)-mandelic acid and separation of the diastereomeric salts by fractional crystallization, or, preferably, at a fairly late stage, by derivatization with a chiral auxiliary component, such as, for example, (+)- or (-)-camphanyl chloride and separation of the diastereomeric products by chromatography and/or crystallization and subsequent cleavage of the bond to the chiral auxiliary. The pure diastereomeric salts and derivatives can be analysed to determine the absolute configuration of the compound present, using customary spectroscopic methods, with single-crystal X-ray spectroscopy representing one particularly appropriate method.<br>
Salts are primarily the pharmaceutically acceptable or non-toxic salts of compounds of the formula (I) or (la). Such salts are formed for example by compounds of the fonnula (1) or (la) containing an acidic group, such as a carboxyl or sulpho group and are, for example, salts thereof with suitable bases, such as non-toxic metal salts derived from metals of group la, lb, Ha and lib of the Periodic Table of the Elements, such as alkali metal salts, especially lithium, sodium or potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts, magnesium or calcium salts for example, and also zinc salts or ammonium salts, and additionally salts formed with organic amines, such as unsubstituted or hydroxyl-substituted mono-, di- or trialkylamines, especially mono-, di- or tri-lower alkylamines, or with quaternary ammonium bases, e.g. methyl-, ethyl-, diethyl- or triethylamine, mono-, bis- or tris(2-hydroxyl-lower alkyl)amines, such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine or triethanolamine, tris(hydroxylmethyl)methylamine or 2-hydroxyl-tertiary- butylamine, N,N-di-lower alkyl-N-(hydroxyl-lower alkyl)amine, such as N,N-di-N-dimethyl-N-(2- hydroxylethyl)amine, or N-methyl-D-glucamine, or quatemary ammonium hydroxides, such as tetrabutylammonium hydroxide. The compounds of the fonnula (I) or (la) containing a basic group, such as an amino group, can form acid addition salts, with suitable inorganic acids for <br>
example, such as hydrohalic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, or sulphuric acid with replacement of one or both protons, phosphoric acid with replacement of one or more protons, orthophosphoric acid or metaphosphoric acid for example, or pyrophosphoric acid with replacement of one or more protons, or with organic carboxylic, sulphonic or phosphonic acids or N-substituted sulphamic acids, e.g. acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, hydroxylmaleic acid, methylmaleic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, gluconic acid, glucaric acid, glucuronic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, salicylic acid, 4-aminosalicylic acid, 2-phenoxybenzoic acid, 2-acetoxybenzoic acid, embonic acid, nicotinic acid, isonicotinic acid, and also amino acids, such as the a-amino acids specified earlier on, and also methanesulphonic acid, ethane- sulphonic acid, 2-hydroxylethanesulphonic acid, ethane-1,2-disulphonic acid, benzene- sulphonic acid, 4-toluenesulphonic acid, naphthalene-2-sulphonic acid, 2- or 3-phospho- glycerate, glucose 6-phosphate, N-cyciohexylsulphamic acid (to form cyclamates), or with other acidic organic compounds, such as ascorbic acid. Compounds of the formula (I) or (la) containing acidic and basic groups can also form inner salts.<br>
Isolation and purification can also be carried out using pharmaceuticaily unsuitable salts.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) or (la) also include those compounds in which one or more atoms have been replaced by their stable, non-radioactive isotopes: for example, a hydrogen atom by deuterium.<br>
Prodrug derivatives of the presently described compounds are derivatives thereof which when employed in vivo release the original compound as a result of a chemical or physio¬logical process. A prodrug may be converted into the original compound, for example, when a physiological pH is reached or as a result of enzymatic conversion. Examples of possible prodrug derivatives include esters of freely available carboxylic acids, S- and 0-acyl derivatives of thiols, alcohols or phenols, the acyl group being defined as above. Preference is given to pharmaceuticaily useful ester derivatives which are converted by solvolysis in physiological medium into the original carboxylic acid, such as, for example, lower alkyi esters, cycloalkyi esters, lower alkenyl esters, benzyl esters, mono- or disubstituted lower alkyi esters, such as lower ccr(amino, mono- or dialkylamino, carboxyi, lower alkoxycarbonyl)- alkyl esters or such as lower a-(alkanoyloxy, alkoxycarbonyl or dialkylaminocarbonyl)alkyl esters; pivaloyloxymethyl esters and similar esters are conventionally used as ester derivatives of this kind.<br>
Because of the close relationship between a free compound, a prodrug derivative and a salt compound, a defined compound in this invention also includes its prodrug derivative and salt form, insofar as this is possible and appropriate.<br>
Aldosterone is a steroidal hormone which is synthesized in the zona glomerulosa cells of the adrenal cortex by the enzyme aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2). Aldosterone production and seaetion is regulated by the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), angiotensin ii, potassium and sodium ions. The primary biological function of aldosterone is the regulation of the salt balance, with aldosterone controlling the reabsorption of sodium ions from the renal filtrate and the secretion of potassium ions into the renal filtrate. The state of excessive aldosterone secretion, also called hyperaldosteronism, can lead to high blood pressure, hypokalaemia, alkalosis, muscle weakness, polyuria, polydipsia, oedemas, vasculitis, increased collagen formation, fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction.<br>
The chemical compounds described in this invention inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzyme aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) and can therefore be used to treat states induced by aldosterone. The compounds described can be employed for preventing, for delaying the progression of or treating states such as hypokalaemia, hypertension, congestive heart failure, acute and - in particular - chronic renal failure, cardiovascular restenosis, athero¬sclerosis, metabolic syndrome (syndrome X), adiposity (obesity), vasculitis, primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism, nephropathy, myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, increased collagen formation, fibrosis, vascular and coronary tissue changes (remodelling) secondary to high blood pressure, endothelial dysfunction, and oedemas secondary to cirrhosis, nephrosis and congestive heart failure.<br>
Cortisol is a steroidal hormone which is synthesized almost exclusively in the zona fasciculata cells of the adrenal cortex by the cytochrome P450 enzyme 1 l-p-hydroxylase (CYP11B1). Cortisol production is regulated by ACTH. The primary biological function of Cortisol is to regulate the production and the provision of carbohydrates for the brain and other metabolically active tissues. Increased Cortisol production and secretion is a nonnal physiological response to stress and leads to the essential mobilization of fats, proteins and carbohydrates to cover increased physical energy demand. Chronically excessive Cortisol release describes the condition of Cushing's syndrome. Cushing's syndrome may come about on the one hand as a result of Cortisol hypersynthesis, which may be generated by an adrenocortical tumour, or on the other hand as the consequence of excessive stimulation of the adrenal cortex by ACTH. The first form is referred to as primary hypercortisolism, the second form as secondary hypercortisolism. An excessive and persistent Cortisol secretion may also accompany a stress response, which can lead to depression and the suppression of the immune system.<br>
The chemical compounds described in this invention inhibit the enzyme 11-^-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) and may therefore, owing to the inhibition of Cortisol synthesis, be employed for preventing, for delaying the progression of or treating Cushing's syndrome and also the physical and mental consequences of excessive and persistent Cortisol secretion in states of stress.<br>
The inhibition of aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2), as well as 11-P-hydroxylase (Cyp11B1) and aromatase (Cyp19) by herein described compounds may be measured by the following in vitro assay.<br>
The cell line NCI-H295R was originally derived from an adrenal carcinoma and was sub¬sequently characterized in the literature for the inducible secretion of steroidal hormones and the presence of the key enzymes necessary for steroidogenesis. These include Cyp11A (cholesterol side-chain cleavage), Cyp11B1 (steroid 1ip-hydroxylase), Cyp11B2 (aldo¬sterone synthase), Cyp17 (steroid 17a-hydroxylase and 17,20 lyase), Cyp19 (aromatase), Cyp21B2 (steroid 21-hydroxylase) and Sp-HSD (hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase). The cells have the physiological characteristics of zonally undifferentiated human fetal adrenal cells, with the ability to produce the steroid hormones of each of the three phenotypically distinct zones found in the adult adrenal cortex.<br>
The NCI-H295R cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA) are cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle'Ham F-12 medium (DME/F12)that is supplemented with Ultroser SF serum (Soprachem, Cergy-Saint-Christophe, France) as well as insulin, transferrin, selenite (1-T-S, Becton Dickinson Biosiences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and antibiotics in 75 cm^ cell culture flasks at a temperature of 37 °C and a 95% air / 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The cells are subsequently transferred to a 24-well plate and seeded in the presence of DME/F12 medium that is supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin instead of Ultroser SF serum. The experiment is initiated by incubating the cells for 72 hours in DME/F12 medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and test compounds in the presence of cell stimulatory agents. The test compound is added in a concentration range of 0.2 nanomolar to 20 micromolar. Angiotensin-ll (e.g. at 10 or 100 nanomolar con¬centration), potassium ions (e.g. at 16 millimolar), forskolin (e.g. at 10 micromolar) or a combination of two agents may serve as cell-stimulatory agents. The cellular secretion of aldosterone, Cortisol, corticosterone and estradiol/estrone into the cell culture medium can t&gt;e quantitatively assessed with commercially available radioimmunoassays and specific anti¬bodies (e.g. Diagnostics Products Corporation, Los Angeles, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
The degree of secretion of a selective steroid is used as a measure of enzyme activity, respectively enzyme inhibition, in the presence or absence of a test compound. The dose- dependent enzyme inhibitory activity of a compound is reflected in an inhibition curve that is characterized by an IC50 value. The IC50 values for active test compounds are generated by simple linear regression analysis to establish inhibition curves without data weighting. The inhibition curve is generated by fitting a 4-parameter logistic function to the raw data of the samples using the least squares approach. The function is described as follows:<br>
Y = (d-a) / ((1 + (x/c)-") + a)<br>
with:<br>
a = minimum<br>
b = slope<br>
C= IC50<br>

The compounds of the present invention show in the herein described in vitro test systems inhibitory activities with IC50 values for aldosterone synthesis inhibition ranging from ID"' to 10"^° mol/l, and IC50 values for Cortisol synthesis inhibition ranging frc)m 10"^ to 10'^° mol/l.<br>
Additionally, the in vitro inhibition of aromatase activity of the compounds of the present invention can be demonstrated by using a commercial Cyp19 enzyme inhibition kit. The Cyp19/methoxy-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin (MFC) high throughput inhibition kit (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), for example, is designed to screen for potential inhibitors of Cyp19 catalytic activity in a 96-well format. The kit includes recombinant human Cyp19 enzyme in the form of supersomes, a fluorescent P450 substrate, an NADPH regenerating system, a reaction buffer and a stop reagent. MFC, the fluorogenic substrate is rapidly converted by Cyp19 supersomes to tlie highly fluorescent product 7-hydroxy-4- trifluoromethyi coumarin (7-HFC). The execution of the assay in the presence of various concentrations of inhibitor compounds ranging from 0.2 nanomolar to 20 millimolar occurs according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
The inhibition curve is generated by fitting a 4-parameter logistic function to the raw data of the samples using the least squares approach. The function is described as follows:<br>
Y = (d-a) / ((1 + (x/c)-^) + a)<br>
with:<br>
a = minimal data values b = slope C= IC50<br>
d = maximal data values X = inhibitor concentrations<br>
The aidosterone- and corticosierone-suppressirig activity of herein described com&amp;ounds may be assessed with the following in vivo protocol.<br>
Adult male Wistar rats weighing between 250 and 350 grams are kept under the usual 12-hour light and 12-hour dark conditions at a temperature of 23°C ± 2'C. On the first day of the experiment, the animals receive a subcutaneous injection of a depot ACTH product in a dose of 1.0 mg/kg weight (SYNACTHEN-Depot, Novartis, Basel, CH) 16 hours prior to the administration of a test compound. Pilot studies showed that this ACTH dose significantly increased plasma aldosterone and corticosterone levels by 5- to 20-fold over a period of at least 18 hours. An alternative method to stimulate aldosterone secretion consists in sub¬jecting rats to a low salt diet for 48 hours and applying the diuretic furosemide at 10 mg/kg by subcutaneous or intraperitoneal administration 16 hours, respectively 2 hours prior to the start of the experiment. On the second day of the experiment, the animals are divided into test groups of 5 animals and subjected tc a first bleed 1 hour prior to the administration of test compound. Subsequently, and 16 hours after the injection of the ACTH product, the animals receive either vehicle or test compound dissolved in vehicle in a variable dose range from 0.02 to 20 mg/kg by oral gavage. The animals are bled two more times from the vena subciavia under isoflurane anaesthesia 2 and 6 hours after dosing. The blood is collected in heparin-treated tubes. The plasma samples are obtained by centrifugation and stored at -20°C. An alternative method to bleed animals time-dependently consists in using animals that are chronically carotid catheterized which allows the periodical sampling of up to 0.2 ml of blood using an AccuSampler (DiLab Europe, Lund, Sweden). The blood sampling with the AccuSampler may occur 1 hour prior to the administration of a test compound and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12,16 and 24 hours thereafter. The blood samples are anticoagulated with heparin and centrifuged. The aldosterone and corticosterone concentrations of the plasma samples can be determined with a radioimmunoassay as described above for the in vitro test systems.<br>
The selective suppression of plasma steroid levels as for instance aldosterone in comparison to corticosterone may serve as a measure for in vivo bioavailability and pharmacodynamic enzyme inhibitory activity of the herein described compounds. The evaluation of the data may occur relative to the application of vehicle or quantitatively by determination of the area under the curve (AUG).<br>
Examples of suppression of aldosterone and corticosterone levels :<br>
Compound	Dose	Aldosterone levels	Corticosterone levels<br>
of Example	(mg/kg p.o.)	(% change* at 2h)	(% change* at 2h)<br>
2	4	-56	-22<br>
4	4	-19	-10<br>
18	4	-33	4<br>
19	4	-65	1.7<br><br>
^The resulting changes in plasma aldosterone, respectively corticosterone, levels upon oral administration of a test compound are expressed as percent {%) change that is defined by the ratio of the [(plasma steroid level 2 hours after compound administration) - (plasma steroid level 1 hour prior to compound administration)] divided by (plasma steroid level 1 hour prior to compound administration).<br>
