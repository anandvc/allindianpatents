COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
METHOD AND DEVICE FOR DETERMINING AN ANGULAR ERROR AND USE OF THE DEVICE<br>
OERLIKON CONTRAVES AG of BIRCHSTRASSE 155, CH-8050 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND, SWISS National Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
METHOD AND DEVICE FOR DETERMINING AN ANGULAR ERROR AND USE OF<br>
THE DEVICE<br>
The present invention relates to a method according to the preamble of Claim 1, a device for performing this method according to the preamble of Claim 15, and a use of the device according to Claim 25 and/or 26.<br>
As an example, but without any restrictive effect, in the following the problem upon which the present invention is based is to be described with reference to a tracking device, such as a tracking device having a sensor or effector, the  tracking device being positioned on a movable mounting surface, such as a vehicle or ship deck. For example, the sensor may be an image recording device and the effector may be a weapon barrel of an artillery weapon, the main optical axis of the image recording device and/or the core axis of the weapon barrel able to be considered at least approximately the main axis. The sensor and/or effector is to be movable in such a way that its alignment and/or the alignment of its main axis is always correlated with the position of an external object which moves in relation to the sensor and/or effector and thus follows the object; in the case of a sensor, this means that it is always pointed directly at the moving target, while in the case of an effector implemented as a weapon barrel, this generally means that it is pointed at a<br><br><br>
point which the object only reaches later, so that the projectile fired from the weapon barrel hits the object at the point cited.<br>
The sensor and/or effector is rigidly attached to a receiver, together with i which it essentially forms one actual functional unit. The receiver is rotatably connected to a carrier via an axis of elevation; the elevation of the sensor and/or effector may be set essentially through a rotation of the receiver in relation to the carrier around the axis of elevation; it is assumed that the main axis runs horizontally in the rest position. The carrier is rotatably connected to a carrier base via a roll axis; the effect of a rolling movement may be compensated for through a rotation of the carrier in relation to the carrier base around the roll axis in such a way that the axis of elevation remains horizontal or deviates only briefly by a small value from the horizontal; the roll axis is perpendicular to the axis of elevation and at an angle of 60Â° to a lateral axis, for example. The carrier base is rotatably connected via the lateral axis, directly or indirectly, to the vehicle and/or ship deck; the lateral angle of the sensor and/or effector may essentially be set through a rotation of the carrier base around the lateral axis; the lateral axis is at least approximately vertically aligned in the rest position.<br>
The directions and/or angles of the various axes of rotation indicated above are theoretical values which one attempts to maintain. The actual values of these directions and/or angles generally deviate from the theoretical values. The deviations are essentially based on the permissible manufacturing and mounting tolerances, in that relative movements generally do not occur precisely continuously but rather in steps, if small steps, and also on changes of the relative positions of the centers of gravity of individual elements of the tracking device during their movements. The results of the deviations and/or geometry errors cause the actual direction of the main axis of the sensor and/or effector to deviate from the theoretical and/or desired direction by a -generally spatial - angular error. In other words, during rotations around the axes of rotation, the actual changes of specific angles deviate from the intended changes of these angles. The intended changes are provided in this case by a coder device.    The deviations of the actual  changes from the<br><br><br>
intended changes is referred to as angular errors. The angular errors have an influence on the results of the functional unit, for example, on the precision with which a sensor measures an object.<br>
The angular errors are generally established at the factory in the course of a testing method, in the scope of a quality check, for example. The angular errors are typically different for the individual tracking devices and/or tracking device types and therefore at least partially describe the individual tracking devices. The angular errors are stored for this purpose.<br>
The angular errors are not to exceed certain limiting values. They may be compensated for, which may be performed either through hardware and/or apparatus by reworking and/or mounting corrections, or through software, by taking the angular errors established into consideration, for example in the analysis of the results of a sensor system.<br>
Independently of whether the angular errors are only stored or whether they are compensated for, they must be measured.<br>
For the measurement of such angular errors typical until now, a chain measurement has been performed. For this purpose, first leveling is performed, and subsequently measurement from one axis to the next, i.e., from the lateral axis to the roll axis and further to the axis of elevation, is performed step-by-step. Optical measuring devices are mainly used for this measurement, such as autocollimators, theodolites, mirrors, angle levels, and inclinometers. In addition, multiple adapters, holders, carriers, and equivalent masses are necessary. The multiple means necessary, their differing resolution and measurement precisions, and the necessity of working very precisely are disadvantages of the typical measurement method. However, its greatest disadvantage is that measurement errors accumulate due to the chain measurement and coupling errors are practically unavoidable.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention,<br><br><br>
to   specify   a   method   of  the   type   initially   cited,   using   which   the<br>
disadvantages of the typical method may be avoided;<br>
to provide a device of the type initially cited, which allows problem-free<br>
performance of the method; and<br>
to suggest a use of the device.<br>
This object is achieved according to the present invention for the method by the features of Claim 1; for the device by the features of Claim 15; and for the use by the features of Claim 25 and/or 26.<br>
Preferred refinements are defined by the respective dependent claims.<br>
The present invention is based on the use of an at least biaxial, preferably triaxial optical-electronic angular measurement device, such as a laser gyro, in any case an angular measurement device which does not require any fixed orientation in space and which always only indicates the respective angle changes. The angular measurement device and/or the laser gyro is mounted, generally temporarily for performing measurement procedures, instead of a sensor or effector or in addition to the sensor and/or effector, so that a measurement axis is as coincident as possible to the main axis or if necessary is as parallel as possible. Other mounting configurations are possible, but require coordinate transformations for an understandable analysis of the results. The functional unit includes the receiver and the sensor or effector and/or the angular measurement device.<br>
Through the use of an angular measurement device like a laser gyro, which does not require any fixed orientation in space, in particular no leveling, the new measurement is significantly simplified in relation to the typical measurement and, in addition, is more precise. During movements of the receiver due to rotations around the lateral axis, the roll axis, and the axis of elevation, the angular measurement device always recognizes the actual changes of the angle of the main axis. Using movements around only one of the three axes of rotation at a time, the actual changes of the angle and/or<br><br><br>
the relative positions of the main axes may be determined. The movements performed are identical to those which the tracking device would also execute in use.<br>
The measurement performed in this new way is very precise and reproducible. Since it is, after all, an end-to-end measurement, errors due to coupling are also dispensed with.<br>
A few adapter parts may possibly be necessary for mounting the angular measurement device and/or laser gyro. It is significant that the mass and center of gravity ratios are not significantly changed by mounting the angular measurement device and/or laser gyro; mounting in addition to the effector functional unit only comes into consideration, aside from the spatial relationships, when the mass of the angular measurement device and/or of the laser gyro is relatively small; if the angular measurement device and/or the laser gyro is mounted instead of the sensor and/or effector, and if its mass is significantly smaller than that of the sensor and/or effector, a compensating equivalent mass is to be attached.<br>
The results of the error measurement procedures are only conclusive if the arrangement is such that the angular measurement device is located in a precisely known position relative to the main axis of the effector and/or sensor; the arrangement is preferably such that a relevant measurement axis of the measurement axes of the optical-electronic angular measurement device exactly corresponds to the main axis, which must be verified before the actual measurement of the angular error. For this purpose, a movement around the axis of elevation may be performed. If the relevant measurement .axis is actually coincident with the main axis, it describes a normal plane to the axis of elevation during the movement around the axis of elevation. If the relevant measurement axis is not coincident with the main axis, it describes a conical surface, whose tip lies in the intersection of the measurement axis and axis of elevation, during the movement around the axis of elevation. In this case, a correction must be performed, unless the included angle of the conical<br><br><br>
surface is nearly 180Â°. The correction may be performed using hardware or software, a correction using software generally being preferred.<br>
After this correction, the actual error measurement is performed. For this purpose, a rotation is performed around one of the three axes of rotation at a time, i.e., around the axis of elevation or around the roll axis or around the lateral axis, while rotations around the two other axes of rotation are prevented. The rotations are performed step-by-step. After each rotation step, the intended change of the angle is provided by the coder device, and the optical-electronic angular measurement device and/or the laser gyro provides the corresponding actual change. The intended changes and actual changes which correspond to one another are stored in a storage unit.<br>
The actual error measurement is now finished in a narrower sense. What follows now is an analysis of the results of this measurement.<br>
The results of the error measurement, i.e. only the actual changes and the intended changes of the respective angle, are stored in the storage unit and, as already mentioned, may merely be used for the purpose of characterizing the individual tracking devices.<br>
In general, the device has a data processing system and/or is coupled to such a system. Using a computer unit of the data processing system, a matrix may be produced using the results of the error measurement.<br>
In general, angular errors, i.e., differences between the actual changes and the intended changes of the angle, are calculated using the computer unit.<br>
These angular errors may either merely be stored or may be used as a basis for compensations. Compensations may be performed using hardware or software.<br>
Compensations with the aid of software may be performed so that empirical error functions may be produced and possibly mathematical error functions<br><br>
may be produced from these empirical error functions, which are taken into consideration during the use of the tracking device for its control.<br>
Compensations, in particular hardware compensations, are generally only performed if the angular errors exceed certain preselectable limiting values. For this purpose, the computer unit may compare the angular errors determined to preselectable limiting values.<br>
The data processing system may have a printer unit in order to produce hard copies of data in connection with the method according to the present invention.<br>
The data processing system preferably has a display unit.<br>
Furthermore, the data processing system may have an input unit in order to completely or partially control the novel method, typically in combination with the display unit.<br>
The present invention is used in particular to establish angular errors of main axes of sensors and/or effectors of tracking devices, the functional unit, more precisely the receiver of the sensor and/or effector, being rotatable directly around an axis of elevation and indirectly around a roll axis and a lateral axis. tIn this case, the sensor may be an image recording device, such as a TV camera, and the effector may be a weapon barrel, and the mounting surface for the tracking device may be a movable surface, for example, of a vehicle or ship, in particular a vehicle or ship deck.<br>
The device may be autonomous in regard to its positioning device and/or decoupled from an external positioning device. However, it may be coupled to an external positioning device, for example, with the aid of a PSD device.<br>
Further details of the present invention are described in the following on the basis of an exemplary embodiment and with reference to the drawing.<br><br><br>
Figure 1 shows a tracking device having a first device according to the present invention, in a greatly simplified, schematic illustration; and<br>
Figure 2 shows the tracking device illustrated in Figure 1 having a second device according to the present invention, in the same illustration as in Figure 1. .<br>
Figure 1 shows a mounting surface 1 having a tracking device 2. In use, the tracking device 2 essentially comprises a functional unit 4, specifically a sensor or effector or an angular measurement device 5, as well as a carrier 6 and finally a carrier base 8. The functional unit is not a component of the device according to the present invention.<br>
The functional unit 4 has a receiver 4.1. If the tracking device 2 is ready for use, it is attached to the receiver 4.1 of the sensor or effector, which has a main axis, e. To perform the method according to the present invention, which is" a test method, the triaxial angular measurement device 5 is temporarily attached to the receiver 4.1 in such a way that one of its measurement axes is coincident at least with the direction of the main axis e; a deviation of the measurement axis cited from its intended direction during a movement of the receiver 4.1 corresponds to the deviation of the main axis e during an identical movement of the receiver 4.1.<br>
The functional unit 4 and/or the receiver 4.1 is/are rotatably coupled via an axis of elevation I to the carrier 6 and may be rotated relative to the carrier 6 along an upper plane of rotation L. In the arrangement shown in Figure 1, the axis of elevation I is perpendicular and the upper plane of rotation L is parallel to the plane of the drawing, and the axis of elevation I is accordingly shown as a point. The axis of elevation I is horizontal in a resting state in the example described here. The angle of elevation A of the main axis e is set essentially by rotation around the axis of elevation I.<br><br><br>
It will now be explained how the position and alignment of the angular measurement device 5 is determined during and/or after the mounting of the angular measurement device 5 and how deviations from the ideal and/or desired position and/or alignment are compensated. As already described, the angular measurement device 5 is attached to the receiver 4.1 in place of the sensor or effector used during use of the tracking device 2. If the angular measurement device 5 has a significantly lower mass than the sensor or effector, this must be compensated for by additionally positioning an equivalent mass at a suitable position. Subsequently, it is checked by rotation around the axis of elevation I, as described above, whether and by how much the position and alignment of the main measurement axis deviates from the main axis e. The compensation of this deviation may be performed through hardware by reworking and/or more precise mounting of the angular measurement device 5. However, the compensation may also be performed through software, in that the deviation is stored and is taken into consideration by the computer during the establishment and/or analysis of the results of the method according to the present invention.<br>
The carrier 6 is rotatably coupled to the carrier base 8 via a roll axis b and may be rotated in relation to the carrier base 8 along a central plane of rotation B. The roll axis b is theoretically perpendicular to the axis of elevation I. A rotation is performed around the roll axis b to compensate for a roll angle 3 which generally changes continuously in the event of a moving mounting surface 1.<br>
The carrier base 8 is directly or indirectly positioned rotatably on the mounting surface 1 via a lateral axis a and is rotatable along a lower plane of rotation A in relation to the mounting surface 1. The lateral axis a is at a theoretical fixed angle q to the roll axis b and is vertical in a resting state in the present example. The lateral angle a of the functional unit 4 and/or of the main axis e is set essentially through rotation around the lateral axis a.<br>
It is to be noted here that in the present case the absolute elevation and lateral  angle of the functional  unit 4  and/or of the  main  axis  e  are  not<br><br>
exclusively determined by the angle of elevation A and/or the lateral angle a, because it is assumed that the mounting surface 1 moves but is not horizontal.<br>
The tracking device 2 has a coder device 10 for each of the planes of rotation L, B, and A. Starting from a zero position in each case, the coder device 10 provides the intended change AÎ* of the spatial angle of the main axis e during a rotation around one of the axes of rotation, i.e., around the axis of elevation I or around the roll axis b or around the lateral axis a, with simultaneous prevention of rotations around the respective other two axes of rotation. The rotations are performed in rotation steps, and the corresponding intended change AÎµ* is fixed after each rotation step.<br>
Simultaneously, the actual change AE of the spatial angle of the main axis e is measured after each rotation step by the angular measurement device 5.<br>
The intended changes AÎµ* and the associated actual changes Ae, which were obtained during the different determination procedures, are stored in the form of a table and may also be analyzed.<br>
For this purpose, the angular measurement device 5 and the coder device 10 are connected to a data processing system 12, a suitable laptop in the present . case. The data processing system 12 has a storage unit 12.1 for storing the intended changes and the actual changes and possibly further data in connection with the method according to the present invention. Furthermore, the data processing system 12 has a computer unit 12.2; the computer unit 12.2 is used to produce a multidimensional matrix on the basis of the actual changes and the intended changes, taking the respective rotation directions and rotation steps into consideration. The respective tracking device tested and/or its geometrical deviations from its desired ideal configuration is represented by this matrix. Furthermore, the data processing system has a display unit 12.3 for displaying data in tabular and/or graphic form in connection with the method according to the present invention. Finally, the data  processing system  12  has an  input unit  12.4.    The  input unit  12.4,<br><br><br>
typically in combination with the display unit 12.3, is used both for analyzing the results of the determination procedures and for controlling the entire method according to the present invention. A printer unit 12.5 is used for producing hard copies of data which is connected to the novel method.<br>
The arrangement described in connection with Figure 1 operates without<br>
external reference points. An arrangement as shown in Figure 2 is<br>
advantageously used in particular if interaction with external units is intended.<br>
The arrangement shown in Figure 2 is identically constructed in principle to the<br>
arrangement of Figure 1, identical or corresponding parts are provided with<br>
identical reference numbers. In addition, the arrangement shown in Figure 2<br>
has a PSD device, with the aid of which linkage to an external reference<br>
system may be produced. The PSD device essentially comprises a PSD laser<br>
emitter 20.1, which is attached to the receiver, a PSD receiver 20.2, and a<br>
PSD	electronic	system	20.3.<br><br><br>
