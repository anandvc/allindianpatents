				<td>Technical field<br>
This invention relates to assistant teaching device which has simple structure and good<br>
using effect.<br>
Technical background<br>
Along with the coming of knowledge economy, more and more people begin waking<br>
up to the importance of knowledge and throw themselves to the tide of studying. In<br>
addition to self-study and school education, various kinds of tutorial classes and<br>
training classes appear in current society to help people grasp science and technology<br>
knowledge. During the course of teaching, many modern assistant teaching<br>
instruments are used, like lantern slides, computer projections etc., so that, vivid<br>
pictures can be provided as well as the text, and the teaching quality is greatly<br>
improved. But what we cannot deny is that these modern assistant teaching<br>
instruments also have some deficiencies. First, they are too expensive to be afforded by<br>
individuals who are not very rich. Secondly, attentions are only paid to the formal<br>
effect of these teaching instruments, however, the possibility to exploit user"s cerebral<br>
potential by strengthening memory is neglected, therefore, it is hard for the users to<br>
memorize the study content, and the study efficiency of the users can not be improved<br>
rapidly.<br>
And at the same time, we can often see such instances in daily life: first, no matter<br>
what sized electronic play game it is, people can easily be concentrated on it when<br>
have it, though the speed and difficulty of the play game become higher step by step,<br>
and the user"s ability can be improved rapidly in very short time; Second, some<br>
high-tech products like cars and computers can be produced through product line by<br>
workers of low knowledge; Third, though workers at product line have different<br>
attitude, they can sit aside the dull product line for eight or nine hours, day after day,<br>
and year after year. From the above examples we can see that, the good effect is<br>
basically obtained by adopting product lines. By product lines, product"s production<br>
and assembly are all simplified into several simple operation procedures, people at<br>
each working procedure are always repeating a simple operation, people don"t feel<br>
tired easily, and can skillfully master this operation very soon and improve operation<br>
speed.<br>
CN 86206232 teaches mechanical transmission assembly composed of a motor, a<br>
motor wheel, a conveyor belt, a flywheel, an annulet, a magnetic head, a spring, a<br>
turnplate and a track bracket, etc.<br>
The assembly seems to be simple, but for a person who is studying, it is just an<br>
intermediate body or is called an intermediate part, because the intention of the<br>
designers is to strengthen the study effect of cerebra through the repeat of sound when<br>
some information is received. That is to say that the signals received by the magnetic<br>
head have to be transmitted to an amplifier, and then to a broadcasting device so that a<br>
finished product for the need of study is completed. Because the information on card is<br>
received by the magnetic head and then converted into audio signals, there are some<br>
intermediate processes before the information on card is received by User"s ears. Thus<br>
the card information itself can"t stimulate directly User"s body and cerebra. In Addition,<br>
the most effect that voice brings on User"s cerebra via his ears is a movement of<br>
impression, in return, the impression can also spur other organs or body to take<br>
material action; but it is of much less study effect. Thus such a system is not useful for<br>
teaching purpose. Moreover it is known that the absorptivities of information of<br>
various kinds of senses are different. The ocular sense takes 83%, the audio sense takes<br>
35%, the olfactory sense takes 11 %, the gustatory sense takes 1 %, and the tactual sense<br>
takes 1.5%. It is obvious that the capacity of the ocular potential is far more beyond<br>
that of other senses in receiving, storing and processing information. As is well known,<br>
it is easy to receive information, but it is difficult to store and process information. So,<br>
the most important matter on learning is how to store and process information more<br>
effectively.<br>
Summary of Invention<br>
This invention provides a kind of assistant teaching device with simple structure and<br>
good using effect based on the principle of above product line.<br>
In order to achieve the above purpose, this invention comprises a speed-adjustable<br>
motor, two strap wheels driven by said speed-adjustable motor, a belt which is set on<br>
said strap wheels and moving horizontally, and on said belt are fixed plurality of card<br>
boxes with relevant study materials or samples inside.<br>
This invention only consists of several parts, it is simple in structure, and the price is<br>
much lower accordingly; Moreover, the card boxes of this invention are moving<br>
to-and-fro, similar to the product line in a factory, so that, the relevant material or<br>
samples in the card boxes can periodically repeat stimulation to the user"s cerebra,<br>
thereby the user"s study efficiency and effect can be greatly improved.<br>
Brief Description of the accompanying Drawings<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic view of the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a side view of Fig. 1.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Unlike CN 86206232 the assistant teaching device of the present invention uses visual<br>
senses, which has greater absorptivities than the audio senses, to perceive information<br>
and finally store the information received by the eyeballs. The device of the present<br>
invention impels inevitably the User"s eyes turn synchronously and arouses the<br>
inevitable movement of impression, and in the meantime spurs the organs and body to<br>
take impression and material actions. Accordingly the moving objects make direct<br>
impression on the cerebra without any intermediate like amplifier, broadcasting device<br>
and the like. As the physical object, pictures and characters make material movements<br>
relatively to the human body and eyeballs, so User"s attention is easy to be attracted,<br>
and it can make the learner to study in a concentrated way more easily. Since User"s<br>
cerebra make material movement by moving the eyeballs, along with the movement of<br>
receiving, storing and processing information, this way of learning is more acceptable<br>
to User"s cerebra for receiving, storing and processing knowledge than other ways of<br>
learning.<br>
As shown in Figures 1 and 2, this invention comprises a speed-adjustable motor 10,<br>
two strap wheels 20 and 30 driven by the speed-adjustable motor 10, a belt 40 which is<br>
set on the strap wheels 20 and 30 and moving in horizontal direction, and on the belt 40<br>
are fixed several card boxes 50 with study materials inside. The speed of the belt 40<br>
and the speed of the card boxes 50 thereon can be adjusted by the speed-adjustable<br>
motor 10.<br>
In addition, for users to use it even in dim places or at night, and for accommodating<br>
sundries like books, earphones etc., a platform 60 is provided above the strap wheels<br>
20 and 30, and several small bulbs 70 for illumination are installed on the lower<br>
surface of the platform 60.<br>
When using this invention, it is preferred to put some closely relevant materials or<br>
samples inside the card boxes 50 (for examples, to make users quickly master English<br>
sentences about a glass, cards with such Chinese contents are put inside the<br>
neighboring card boxes 50, like "This is a cup", "This is a glass", "This is a white<br>
glass", "This is a transparent white glass", etc.). Then, the speed-adjustable motor 10 is<br>
started to drive the belt 40 and the card boxes 50 thereon to move in the horizontal<br>
direction via strap wheel 20 and 30, and the users are requested to translate the Chinese<br>
content on each card passing by into English. In this way, the materials or samples in<br>
each card box 50 gives a repeated stimulation periodically to the cerebra of the user<br>
who is sitting by the device of the present invention. By repeated stimulation to the<br>
user"s cerebra, the memory to it is reinforced, and the study efficiency is effectively<br>
improved.<br>
Of course, this invention is not only applicable to English study, but also to any kind of<br>
study where it is necessary to memorize.<br>
