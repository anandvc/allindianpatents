				<td>Monitoring Photodetector for Integrated Photonic Devices<br>
[001]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Nonprovisional Patent<br>
Application No. 11/325,325 filed January 5, 2006, and entitled "Monitoring<br>
Photodetector for Integrated Photonic Devices".<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[002]	The present invention relates, in general, to photonic devices, and<br>
more particularly to improve monolithically integrated photonic devices incorporating<br>
monitoring photodetectors and methods for fabricating them.<br>
[003]	Many optical systems, such as, for example, those incorporating or<br>
utilizing Passive Optical Networks (PON), require that a single optical fiber be used<br>
for both sending and receiving information at multiple wavelengths. In the past, such<br>
a capability has been difficult to achieve, particularly in a cost-effective manner, for<br>
the combination of a multiplicity of discrete photonic devices that will all have access<br>
to a single fiber has presented fabrication problems that have made such<br>
arrangements too expensive. The market for PON systems is extremely price<br>
sensitive, with the result that the highly desirable, wide range of functions that such<br>
networks can make available have not been economically feasible. Similar difficulties<br>
have been encountered with the use of multiple photonic devices in other optical<br>
systems, such as high definition DVD's, for even in such applications the required<br>
high level of functionality is not easily attainable through the use of discrete photonic<br>
devices.<br><br>
[004]	Because photonic devices such as lasers tend to change their<br>
characteristics with changing environmental conditions, it is desirable to monitor their<br>
operation, but such monitoring is not easily achievable when using discrete devices,<br>
particularly when the devices are extremely small.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[005]	In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, solid state light<br>
receiving and light emitting photonic devices are monolithically integrated on a<br>
common substrate to provide multiple optical functions on the surface of a single<br>
chip. The integration of such devices to provide bidirectional photonic operation is<br>
optimized though multilayer epitaxy, wherein lasers and detectors can be fabricated<br>
on separate mesas on a single chip to provide a high efficiency coupling of the lasers<br>
and the detectors to a single optical fiber. In accordance with another aspect of the<br>
invention, multiple light emitters and multiple light detectors are fabricated on a<br>
single chip in such a way as to permit coupling of multiple emitters and multiple<br>
detectors to a single fiber. The emitters may be surface emitting devices fabricated<br>
on the surface of the chip, such as those described in U.S. Application No.<br>
10/958,069, filed October 5, 2004, or in Application No. 10/963,739, filed October 14,<br>
2004, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference, or may<br>
be edge emitting lasers fabricated on the chip, such as those described in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,851,368, or in IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, volume 28, pages<br>
1227-1231, May 1992, with all of the laser outputs being coupled into a common<br>
optical fiber. The detectors are also fabricated on the same chip, and may be surface<br>
or edge-receiving devices coupled to the same optical fiber to receive optical signals<br>
from the fiber. In a preferred form of the invention each of the lasers emits light at a<br><br>
different wavelength and each of the detectors receives light at different wavelengths<br>
that differ from those of the emitted light.<br>
[006]	In accordance with another aspect of the invention, solid state light<br>
emitting and receiving photonic devices such as lasers and light detectors are<br>
monolithically integrated on a common substrate, as described above, and further<br>
incorporate at least one monitoring detector positioned to receive light from a<br>
corresponding light emitter on the substrate. The monitoring detector may be<br>
fabricated integrally on the substrate, and may be axially aligned with the emitter or<br>
in the preferred form of the invention, may be a surface-receiving detector having a<br>
suitable deflector directing light from the emitter to the detector.<br>
[007]	Briefly, in its preferred form, the invention incorporates one or more<br>
photonic devices including laser emitters and photodetectors and one or more<br>
corresponding semiconductor monitoring detector structures fabricated on a single<br>
chip. The photonic devices are fabricated in a semiconductor structure that is<br>
deposited epitaxially in superimposed layers on a substrate, and includes at least<br>
one epitaxially deposited detector structure with an emitter structure epitaxially<br>
deposited on the top detector structure. The structures are etched to form one or<br>
more emitter mesas incorporating surface or edge emitting lasers to direct emitted<br>
light to an optical fiber, and to form one or more photo detector mesas incorporating<br>
surface or edge receiving detectors for receiving light from the optical fiber, and<br>
surface or edge receiving monitoring detectors for receiving light from the emitter.<br>
Reflectors, deflectors, prisms, gratings or other diffraction elements, hoods and/or<br>
lenses may also be fabricated integrally on the substrate or located adjacent to the<br>
chip to direct emitted or received light as required.<br><br>
[008]	In one form of the invention, a monolithically integrated photonic chip<br>
includes a substrate carrying a semiconductor detector epitaxial structure, with a<br>
semiconductor laser structure epitaxially deposited on the detector structure, using<br>
known deposition techniques. A horizontal cavity surface-emitting laser (HCSEL) is<br>
fabricated, as by etching, in the emitter structure, and is surrounded by an isolating<br>
trench, formed, for example, by etching through the detector structure to the<br>
substrate. The surface of the detector structure adjacent the laser is exposed, as by<br>
etching away the covering laser structure, to form a detector receiver surface which<br>
surrounds the emitting end of the laser and is spaced from it by the trench, so that<br>
the laser and the detector form separate mesas on the common substrate. A metal<br>
layer on the surface of the laser provides an electrical contact for application of a<br>
suitable bias voltage to the laser structure to produce laser light of a known<br>
wavelength. The surface emitting laser acts as a light source, directing a beam of<br>
light upwardly through an external lens to an external optical fiber. The fiber also<br>
may direct light of a second wavelength toward the chip, with this received light<br>
passing downwardly through the lens. Since the received light is of a different<br>
wavelength than the light emitted by the laser, the lens will not focus the received<br>
light back into the laser, but incoming light will be directed by the lens toward the<br>
region surrounding the laser source, where it is received by the detector structure.<br>
[009]	In another embodiment of the invention, the monolithically integrated<br>
chip includes two superimposed epitaxially deposited detector structures, with a<br>
single emitter layer superimposed on the top detector structure. A surface emitting<br>
laser is fabricated on a mesa formed in the laser structure on the chip, as by etching,<br>
and is isolated from a surrounding detector mesa by a trench. The emitter layer<br><br>
surrounding the laser mesa is then removed from the surface of the surrounding two-<br>
structure detector mesa. The laser may be energized to emit light of a first<br>
wavelength which may be directed to an optical fiber through a lens, as discussed<br>
above. In this embodiment, however, the two detector structures are capable of<br>
receiving light of second and third wavelengths, respectively, from the optical fiber.<br>
The provision of a detector mesa around the emitter end and along the sides of a<br>
surface-emitting laser to substantially surround the emitter end of the laser optimizes<br>
the bidirectional coupling of the laser and detectors to a single optical fiber. The first<br>
detector can be designed to absorb wavelengths corresponding to the laser output,<br>
thereby enhancing the optical isolation between the laser and the second detector.<br>
[0010]	In yet another embodiment of the invention, a photonic chip<br>
incorporates a surface-emitting laser at one end of the chip and includes a surface-<br>
receiving detector at the other end of the chip. External components may be used<br>
with this photonic chip to allow light from the laser to be coupled to a fiber, while light<br>
from the same fiber can be directed to the surface-receiving detector or to multiple<br>
surface-receiving detectors.<br>
[0011]	In still another embodiment of the invention, a multiplicity of surface-<br>
emitting lasers may be fabricated side-by-side on individual mesas in a laser<br>
structure array on a chip, with each laser in the array emitting light of a different<br>
wavelength. In similar fashion, a multiplicity of individual detectors may be fabricated<br>
side-by-side on individual mesas in the detector structure, with each detector being<br>
capable of receiving light of a distinct wavelength. The emitters and detectors may<br>
be optically coupled to a single optic fiber through an external diffraction element<br>
such as a prism, and a suitable lens if required.<br><br>
[0012]	Edge-emitting lasers and either surface-receiving or edge-receiving<br>
detectors may also be utilized in the fabrication of the monolithically integrated<br>
bidirectional photonic device of the invention. In one such embodiment, an edge-<br>
emitting laser is fabricated on a mesa in a laser structure and a reflector is<br>
fabricated, for example in the laser structure adjacent the laser exit facet, to direct<br>
emitted light of a first wavelength vertically upwardly. The reflector may incorporate a<br>
flat or a curved reflector surface to direct the light upwardly through an external lens<br>
to an optical fiber. The reflector is surrounded by an exposed surface-receiving<br>
detector structure which is on a mesa separate from the laser mesa and which<br>
receives light of a second wavelength from the optical fiber. In another embodiment,<br>
the reflector surface includes a dichroic coating which reflects laser light of the first<br>
wavelength, but which passes received light of the second wavelength through the<br>
reflector body to the underlying detector structure or structures.<br>
[0013]	A multiplicity of edge-emitting lasers may be fabricated in an array in<br>
the laser structure on the chip to direct light of corresponding wavelengths by way of<br>
a diffraction element such as a prism or grating to an external optical fiber. The array<br>
may also include a multiplicity of end receiving detectors fabricated on separate<br>
mesas in the detector structure and arranged to receive light of different frequencies<br>
from the optical fiber, thus providing a monolithically integrated array of laser and<br>
detector channels, in accordance with the invention.<br>
[0014]	In the foregoing embodiments, each of the laser devices may be<br>
provided with a monitoring photodetector (MPD) to detect the intensity of the light<br>
produced by its corresponding laser. The MPD may be fabricated in the laser<br>
epitaxial layer in alignment with the optical axis of the laser, or may be fabricated as<br><br>
surface-receiving detector in the detector epitaxial layer. In the latter case, a suitable<br>
light deflector, or hood, may be provided to direct emitted laser light onto the surface<br>
of the MPD.<br>

Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
[0016]	Turning now to a more detailed description of the invention, there is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 1 a two-layer epitaxial chip 10 incorporating first and second<br>
epitaxial layers, or structures 12 and 14 superimposed on each other and on a<br>
substrate 16. The first structure or photonic element 12 is a semiconductor material<br>
that is epitaxially deposited in conventional manner on a substrate to form a<br>
photodetector sensitive to light of a selected wavelength band. The second structure<br>
or photonic element 14 is another semiconductor material that is epitaxially<br>
deposited on the first structure 12, again in conventional manner. This second<br>
structure incorporates an active region, from which a laser can be fabricated.<br>
[0017]	As is known in the art, the structures on the substrate 16 may be<br>
formed, for example, from a suitably doped type Ill-V compound, or an alloy thereof.<br><br>
Structure 12 may be a succession of layers deposited by an epitaxial deposition<br>
process such as Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) or Molecular<br>
Beam Epitaxy (MBE). Typically, these structures may include the following layers on<br>
an InP substrate: p-doped InP buffer layer; p-doped InGaAs p-contact layer; p-doped<br>
InP transition layer; undoped, or not intentionally doped, or even very lightly doped;<br>
InGaAs detection layer; n-doped InP layer; and an n-doped InGaAs n-contact layer.<br>
The InP substrate may be of the Fe doped kind so that it is semi-insulating (SI) to<br>
allow good electrical isolation between desired devices fabricated on the same<br>
substrate.<br>
[0018]	The second structure 14 also may be a succession of layers, deposited<br>
by the MOCVD or MBE process on the top surface of structure 12, to form an optical<br>
cavity incorporating an active region. Although other types of laser cavities can be<br>
fabricated in accordance with the invention, the invention will be described herein in<br>
terms of ridge lasers, for convenience. As is typical for solid state ridge lasers, the<br>
epitaxial structure 14 includes upper and lower cladding regions formed from a lower<br>
index semiconductor material than is used in the central active region. These<br>
cladding regions may be formed from InP, for example, while the central active<br>
region may be formed with InAllnGaAs - based quantum wells and barriers. A<br>
transition layer of InGaAsP may be formed on the top cladding region, followed by a<br>
p-doped InGaAs contact layer on the top part of structure 14. The contact layer<br>
provides an ohmic contact with a top metal layer which is deposited on the structure<br>
14 for connecting the device to a bias source.<br>
[0019]	The epitaxial structures 12 and 14 may share some of the deposited<br>
layers, so that the interface between the structures is common to both. Alternatively,<br><br>
the dopants in structure 12 may be reversed such that layers with n-dopants are first<br>
deposited on the substrate, such as Sl-lnP substrate. The described layers allow the<br>
fabrication in structure 12 of highly sensitive detectors such as p-i-n diode detectors<br>
and avalanche photodetectors that will operate in specific wavelength ranges, or<br>
bands, and the fabrication of surface or edge emitting lasers in structure 14 which<br>
are able to emit light at selected wavelengths.<br>
[0020]	In a first embodiment of the invention, illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3, a<br>
monolithic photonic device, or chip 20 incorporates an integral laser 22 and an<br>
integral detector 24 fabricated monolithically in separate mesas in respective<br>
structures 12 and 14 of the chip 10. In order to enhance electrical isolation, in the<br>
case of a semi-insulating substrate it is desirable to form the mesas by etching<br>
through the epitaxial layers into the substrate. The laser 22 is formed in structure 14<br>
by a conventional masking and etching technique to produce, for example, an<br>
HCSEL device including an elongated, horizontal ridge-type optical cavity having a<br>
top surface 26, mesa side walls 28 and 30 (see Fig. 3), and first and second ends 32<br>
and 34. An angled, totally internally reflective facet 35 is formed at the first end 32 to<br>
direct output light propagated in the active region 36 of the laser 22 upwardly out of<br>
the laser optical cavity through a top emissive surface. The second end 34 of the<br>
optical cavity is formed by a vertical reflective facet to permit lasing in the optical<br>
cavity. The angled facet 35 at end 32 is fabricated by etching the structure 14<br>
downwardly and inwardly at or near a 45° angle with respect to the top surface 26,<br>
and causes light generated along the optical axis of the optical cavity to be emitted in<br>
a direction that is essentially perpendicular to the surface 26 and to the plane 36 of<br>
the active material in the horizontal laser, the emitted light beam traveling upwardly<br><br>
in the direction indicated by arrow 37. The emitted light is dispersed over an angle<br>
due to reflections within the cavity, with the limits of the output beam being generally<br>
indicated by arrows 38. The laser 22 and photodetector 24 are electrically and<br>
optically isolated from one another in this arrangement, as will be further explained<br>
below. <br>
[0021]	The end facet at the second end 34 of the laser is formed at a 90°<br>
angle to the longitudinal optical axis of the laser cavity 22. Adjacent this second end<br>
of the laser is a monitoring photodetector (MPD) 40, formed in the laser epitaxial<br>
structure 14 by a conventional masking and etching process at the same time that<br>
the laser optical cavity 22 is masked and etched to form a ridge 42. The ridge laser<br>
extends between ends 32 and 34 above the active region 36 in structure 14, with the<br>
ridge being widened, as at 44 in Fig. 3, at the emitter end of the laser to provide an<br>
open area above the angled facet 35 to allow the emitted beam 37, which may be<br>
circular or oval, to exit the optical cavity without distortion. The top of the ridge is<br>
coated with an electrically conductive material 46, such as metal, to permit<br>
energization of the laser by a suitable bias voltage. This conductive, or metallization<br>
layer is typically coated on a top layer of the laser structure, which, as indicated<br>
above, may be a low bandgap semiconductor such as InGaAs that allows ohmic<br>
contact with the metallization layer. An aperture 48 may be formed in the top layer or<br>
layers of structure 14, as needed, to remove material that might absorb the emitted<br>
light.<br>
[0022]	The detector 24 is also fabricated as a part of the masking and etching<br>
process that forms the laser 22 and the MPD 40. As illustrated, the portion of<br>
structure 14 that overlies the photodetector epitaxy structure 12 around the laser 22<br><br>
is removed to expose the top surface 50 of the structure 12. The structure 12 is then<br>
further etched in the region immediately adjacent and surrounding the laser 22 to<br>
form a trench 52 (Fig. 3) that separates the laser 22 from the photodetector structure<br>
12. The trench 52 extends down to, and preferably a short distance into, the<br>
substrate 16 to produce separate laser and detector mesas on the substrate. The<br>
detector 24 may be further shaped by removing a rearward portion of layer 12 to<br>
restrict the detector mesa to the region surrounding the emitting surface above facet<br>
35, as illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3.<br>
[0023]	The light output 37 from photonic device 20 may be coupled to an<br>
external receiver/source such as an optical fiber 60 by way of a lens 62. Because of<br>
chromatic aberrations, such a lens will focus light of a particular wavelength, but will<br>
not focus light of a different wavelength. This capability is used in the present<br>
invention to cause outgoing light 37 produced by laser 22, which may, for example,<br>
be a beam having a wavelength of 1310 nm, to be focused onto the end of fiber 60,<br>
as indicated by arrows 38 and 64. Incoming light 66 of a different wavelength than<br>
the outgoing light, for example 1490 rim, may be received from the fiber 60, and will<br>
be directed to the lens 62, also as indicated by arrows 64. Because of its<br>
wavelength, this received light is not tightly focused by the lens 62, as indicated by<br>
beam limit arrows 70. As a result, the incoming light is not focused on the emitter<br>
end of laser 22, but instead is spread out and impinges on the top surface of detector<br>
50 in the region.72 illustrated by dashed lines in Fig. 3. The preferred design of the<br>
laser and detector mesas serves to position the emitter region of the laser essentially<br>
in the center of the detector 50 but separated from it by trench 52.<br>
[0024]	Even if the incoming light 66 is substantially the same wavelength as<br><br>
the outgoing light 37, for example both at about 1310nm, a mismatch in coupling<br>
between the laser and a fiber through a lens makes light detection on the detector 50<br>
possible.<br>
[0025]	A second embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Fig. 4, wherein a<br>
chip 78 includes three epitaxial layers, or structures, detectors 80 and 82 and laser<br>
84, which are fabricated on a substrate 86. Layer 84 is fabricated, as discussed<br>
above with respect to Fig. 2 to incorporate an active region in a plane parallel to the<br>
top surface of the substrate, while the layers 82 and 80 are fabricated with different<br>
bandgaps to form optical detectors responsive to light of selected wavelengths.<br>
These semiconductor structures may share common layers to facilitate the<br>
fabrication of the device. For example, a highly doped semiconductor layer can be<br>
introduced between detector layers 80 and 82 to provide a ground plane to improve<br>
electrical isolation and high speed performance.<br>
[0026]	A monolithically integrated photonic device 90, illustrated in Fig. 5, may<br>
be fabricated from chip 78 in the manner described above with respect to the device<br>
of Figs. 2 and 3. In this case, an HCSEL laser waveguide, or cavity 92 is fabricated,<br>
in laser structure 84, as by masking and etching with the etching forming a trench<br>
such as the trench 52 in Fig. 3, extending downwardly through both detector<br>
structures 80 and 82 to the top of substrate 86, so that the laser 92 and the<br>
surrounding detectors are located on separate mesas. An emitter end of the laser 92<br>
is etched to form an angled facet 94 which reflects light propagating in the laser<br>
upwardly and out of the top surface of the laser. The emitted light beam 96, which<br>
may diverge as indicated by limit arrows 98, is directed upwardly to a lens 100,<br>
which collects and focuses the light on an input/output device 102 such as an optical<br><br>
fiber, as indicated by arrows 104.<br>
[0027]	The laser structure, or layer, 84 is removed from the top surface 110 of<br>
the detector structure 82 during the formation of laser 92 to shape and expose the<br>
top surface of the surface-receiving detector layers 80 and 82 in the region<br>
surrounding the emitter end of the laser. An input light beam 114 received by the<br>
photonic device 90 from fiber 102 is of a different wavelength than that of the emitted<br>
beam 96, and accordingly will not be focused by the lens 100 back to facet 94, but<br>
will be directed by the lens onto the surface 110 of detector structure 82, as<br>
illustrated by arrows 114, and as described with respect to Figs. 2 and 3. The<br>
detector structure 82 is responsive to the wavelength of this received beam to<br>
produce a suitable output by way of an electrode (not shown) connected to detector<br>
82. In addition, the photonic device 90 can respond to a second input beam 116 of<br>
still another wavelength supported by fiber 102. This second input beam will also be<br>
directed by lens 100 onto the top surface 110 of detector structure 82, as indicated<br>
by arrows 116, but this detector structure 82 is not responsive to it. Instead, the light<br>
of the second beam passes through structure 82 to the underlying detector structure<br>
80, which receives the beam, as indicated by the arrows 116, and responds to it to<br>
produce a corresponding output on a suitable electrode (not shown).<br>
[0028]	The photonic device 90, which may be referred to as a triplexer, may<br>
emit light having a wavelength in the range of 1310nm + 40 nm, for example, while<br>
the bandgaps of the detector layers 80 and 82 may be selected so that detector 80<br>
responds to light having a wavelength in the range of 1550 nm ± 10 nm, and detector<br>
82 receives light in the range of 1490 nm ± 10 nm. To do this, the bandgap of<br>
detector 82 may be selected to detect light below 1520 nm so that light having longer<br><br>
wavelengths will pass through it to the underlying detector structure 80. The detector<br>
structure 80 may be either a broadband detector or a detector having a bandgap<br>
optimized to receive light having a wavelength below 1580 nm. This detector<br>
structure also can be used to provide improved optical isolation between the laser 92<br>
and detector 80 by using detector 82 to block unwanted light from the laser 92,<br>
preventing such light from reaching detector 80. For example, if the laser is emitting<br>
light at a wavelength of 1310nm ± 40 nm, the undoped, or not intentionally doped, or<br>
even very lightly doped, detection layer in detector 82 would have a bandgap, form<br>
through InGaAsP, designed to capture light of wavelengths shorter than 1350nm<br>
over the temperature range of operation for device 90, and this would prevent the<br>
laser output from reaching detector 80. However, in this example, if the wavelength<br>
of incoming light 116 is around 1490 nm ± 10 nm, then it would travel through<br>
detector 82 without being detected, and would reach detector 80 where it would be<br>
detected. The bandgap of the undoped, or not intentionally doped, or even very<br>
lightly doped, detection layer of detector 80 could be formed from InGaAs for this<br>
scenario.<br>
[0029]	Although the above-described embodiments show a single laser<br>
emitter location and a single detector location surrounding the laser emitter, it Will be<br>
apparent that the integral photonic device of the invention may incorporate multiple<br>
laser locations and multiple detector locations on a single chip, as illustrated, for<br>
example, in the top plan view of Fig. 6. In this figure, a photonic chip 130<br>
incorporates an array 132 of horizontal cavity surface-emitting lasers, such as<br>
HCSEL lasers 134, 136, 138 and 140, fabricated in an epitaxial laser structure, as<br>
described above. The lasers are illustrated as forming generally parallel light emitting<br><br>
channels, although other chip architecture designs can be used. Preferably, emitter<br>
surfaces 142, 144, 146 and 148, respectively, of the HCSEL lasers are grouped<br>
together for convenience in directing their output beams upwardly to a common<br>
input/output optical fiber 150, illustrated in Fig. 7, by way of suitable external optics<br>
such as a prism 152 and lenses 154 and 155.<br>
[0030]	The chip 130 may include surface-receiving detectors fabricated<br>
around the emitting ends of each of the lasers to receive light from fiber 150, in the<br>
manner described above with respect to Figs. 1-5. Alternatively, and as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 6, an array 160 of surface-receiving detectors 162, 164, 166 and 168 may be<br>
provided at a location adjacent to the emitters and grouped for convenience in<br>
receiving input light from the input/output fiber 150. Here again, the surface<br>
architecture of the chip may be varied from that illustrated in the figure.<br>
[0031]	As illustrated, an MPD device may be provided to monitor each of the<br>
lasers on chip 130, as illustrated at 172, 174, 176 and 178, and suitable bonding<br>
pads 180 and ground lines 182 may be provided on the surface of chip 130 as<br>
required, in known manner. As in prior embodiments of the invention, the lasers 132<br>
are rnonolithically fabricated in a first epitaxy structure, while the detectors are<br>
fabricated in a second epitaxy structure on a common substrate. Each laser in the<br>
array 132 may be fabricated to emit light in a different wavelength band; for example,<br>
the surface-emitting lasers 134, 136, and 140 may emit light at wavelengths of 1470<br>
nm, 1490 nm, 1510 nm, and 1530 nm, respectively. Similarly, the detectors 162,.<br>
164, 166, and 168 may detect light at respective wavelength bands of 1550 nm,<br>
1570 nm, 1590 nm, and 1610 nm, for example.<br>
[0032]	In order to have large wavelength variations between the several lasers<br><br>
in array 132, for use in applications such as coarse wavelength division multiplexing<br>
(CWDM) where the channel spacing between adjacent CWDM channels is about 20<br>
nm, the active region of the laser structure, which is the first, or top, epitaxy structure<br>
as described above, needs to have its bandgap modified so as to allow lasers with<br>
appropriate wavelengths to be fabricated for the laser array. This is done by one of<br>
many known processes for forming the first epitaxial structure; for example by<br>
impurity-free vacancy diffusion or by multiple epitaxial depositions.<br>
[0033]	The monolithically integrated emitters and detectors of the invention<br>
may also be fabricated as edge-emitting lasers (EEL) with surface-receiving<br>
detectors, in the manner illustrated in Figs. 8-15, to which reference is now made.<br>
As illustrated in the side view of Fig. 8, such a laser/detector chip 200 preferably<br>
includes an edge-emitting laser 202 which may be, for example, a Fabry-Perot (FP)<br>
laser fabricated in an epitaxial laser layer 204, and a surface-receiving detector 206<br>
fabricated in an epitaxial detector layer 208, both formed on a substrate 210. The<br>
laser and the detector preferably are formed by masking and etching techniques as<br>
described above, with the difference that in this configuration a reflective base<br>
element 212 is provided adjacent the laser and aligned with its optical axis, but<br>
spaced from an emitter facet 214 at one end of the laser 202. Since this is an edge-<br>
emitting laser, the facet 214 is perpendicular to the surface of the substrate 210.<br>
[0034]	Base element 212 may include a flat reflective surface 216 aligned with<br>
the optical axis 218 of laser 202 at its active region, as illustrated in Fig 8, or may<br>
include a curved reflective surface 220 aligned with axis 218, as illustrated in Fig. 9.<br>
A light beam 230 emitted by facet 214 of laser 202 is deflected by surface 216 or by<br>
surface 220 through suitable external optics such as a lens 232 to an optical fiber<br><br>
234. The base element 212 and the surfaces 216 and 220 may be fabricated by<br>
lithography and etching of the semiconductor laser and photodetector layers. As<br>
illustrated in Fig. 10, the detector layer 206 is shaped, as by etching, to surround the<br>
base element 212, so that light 244 received from the optical fiber 234 will be<br>
directed by lens 232 onto the surface of the detector in the region indicated by dotted<br>
line 246 (Fig. 10), in the manner described above with respect to Figs. 1-5.<br>
[0035]	The base element 212 alternatively may be fabricated by electron<br>
beam deposition of, for example, silicon, through a lift-off process, to provide a<br>
convenient structure on top of the detector layer 206 for reflecting the output of the<br>
EEL 202 in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the chip.<br>
[0036]	Another alternative is illustrated in the photonic device 248 of Fig. 11,<br>
wherein an edge-emitting laser 250 is integrated with a surface-receiving<br>
photodetector 252 on a substrate 254, with a reflective base element 256 mounted<br>
on the surface of, or positioned above, the surface of the detector. The base<br>
element 256 includes a surface 260 which may be either flat or curved, and a<br>
dichroic filter 262 on surface 260. The filter may be a multilayer coating on the<br>
surface 260 that is designed to reflect one wavelength band and to allow another<br>
wavelength band to pass through. For example, a beam 264 emitted from facet 266<br>
of laser 250 may have a wavelength band of 1310 nm ± 40 nm and may be<br>
essentially s-polarized. The beam 264 is directed onto the surface of filter 262, which<br>
is at an angle of 45° to the optical axis of the laser, and will be almost completely<br>
reflected upwardly through external optics 266, such as a lens, to an optical fiber<br>
268. Incoming light 270 directed from the optical fiber toward the photonic device<br>
248 may have a wavelength band of 1490 nm ± 10 nm, for example. This light is also<br><br>
directed at an angle of 45° to the filter 262, but light at this wavelength is almost<br>
completely transmitted through the filter and passes through base 256 to the<br>
detector 252. As illustrated in the top view of Fig. 12, the received light 270 is<br>
directed onto the portion of the photonic detector 252 that is within the dotted line<br>
272. This includes the region beneath the base element 256 to provide a greater<br>
area of detection, and thus greater sensitivity to received light.<br>
[0037]	The reflection versus wavelength behavior of a typical dichroic filter is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 13 by curves 280 and 282. In this case, the base element was InP<br>
and the outside medium was air, and nine layers were used to fabricate the filter<br>
using conventional design techniques.<br>
[0038]	Figs. 14 and 15 illustrate arrays of edge-emitting lasers and edge-<br>
receiving detectors integrated on chips with on-chip optical elements such as lenses<br>
and prisms. In Fig. 14, an array 290 of edge-emitting lasers and an array 292 of<br>
edge-receiving detectors are fabricated in respective epitaxial laser and detector<br>
structures on a common substrate. On-chip lenses 294 and 296 and prism 298 are<br>
fabricated in alignment with the optical axes of the lasers and detectors in the arrays<br>
290 and 292, using the process described in US Patent No. 6,6532,44, to direct light<br>
300 emitted from the lasers to an optical fiber 302. The optical elements similarly<br>
direct received light 304 from fiber 302 to the detectors of array 292. Alternately, the<br>
on-chip prism 298 is replaced by an on-chip grating 306 to allow for a larger degree<br>
of dispersion for closely-spaced wavelengths, as illustrated in Fig. 15. Other arrays<br>
of closely-spaced laser channels for different light wavelengths may be formed on<br>
the same first epitaxial structure by modifying the architecture of the chip.<br>
[0039]	Fig. 16 illustrates a modified form of the photonic devices described<br><br>
above. In each of the foregoing devices, a monitoring photodetector (MPD) is<br>
illustrated at one end of the laser cavity in alignment with the optical axis of the laser,<br>
and monolithically fabricated from the same material as the laser. Thus, for example,<br>
in the device of Fig. 8 an MPD 310 is fabricated in the laser epitaxial layer 204. As<br>
illustrated, the monitoring photodetector incorporates an active region 312 aligned<br>
with the active region of the laser at the optical axis 218, and is fabricated in layer<br>
204 by the lithography and etching process used to fabricate the laser 202.<br>
Accordingly, the MPD incorporates an etched facet 314 spaced from and<br>
substantially parallel to the rear etched facet 316 of the laser. Although rear facet<br>
316 is usually highly reflective in order to produce lasing in the laser cavity 202,<br>
some light is emitted, and impinges on facet 314. Such light is detected by the MPD<br>
device 310, to produce a corresponding output on a-suitable electrodes (not shown)<br>
connected to contact layers 318 and 320. As illustrated, the MPD device is fabricated<br>
by vertically etching through both the laser epitaxial layer 204 and the detector<br>
epitaxial layer 208 to isolate the MPD from the laser, as illustrated in the top plan<br>
view of Fig. 10. As shown in Fig. 8, in order to prevent absorption of incoming light<br>
from the fiber 224 in the contact layer 320, this layer has been removed from<br>
underneath the base element 212.<br>
[0040]	In the embodiment of Fig. 16, a photonic device 330 incorporates a<br>
laser 332 fabricated in a laser epitaxial layer, such as layer 14 of the chip structure<br>
10 illustrated in Fig. 1, by the lithography and etching process describe above. This<br>
laser may be a surface-emitting laser, such as those illustrated in Figs. 2, 3, 5, and 6,<br>
or an edge-emitting laser, such as those illustrated in Figs. 8-12, 14, and 15, and<br>
may incorporate any desired optical system, such as deflector 334 and lens 336 for<br><br>
example, for transferring light emitted from the laser, as from facet 338, to an<br>
external optical system, such as an optical fiber 340. The photonic device may<br>
incorporate a monolithic detector at the emitter end of the laser, such as the detector<br>
342, for example, when utilized in a monolithic laser-detector photonic device on a<br>
common substrate 344, as has been described above.<br>
[0041]	In accordance with the embodiment of Fig. 16, the MPD illustrated in<br>
previous embodiments is modified to utilize the detector epitaxial layer 12 (Fig. 1) for<br>
monitoring the operation of the laser 332 instead of using the laser epitaxial layer 14.<br>
As illustrated, the photonic device 330 incorporates an MPD 350 that is fabricated as<br>
a mesa in the detector epitaxial layer 12 by etching away the laser epitaxial layer 14<br>
to expose the top surface 352 of the layer 12. This top surface is at the active p-i-n<br>
region 354 of layer 12, which is sensitive to impinging light to produce an electrical<br>
output signal on a suitable electrode (not shown) connected to the MPD 350. This<br>
configuration is capable of detecting the small amount of light, indicated by arrows<br>
356, emitted from the rear facet 358 of the laser. This light diverges, as illustrated,<br>
but sufficient light strikes the top surface 352 of MPD 350 to permit effective<br>
monitoring of the intensity of the light produced by laser 332.<br>
[0042]	When the MPD is fabricated, an etch is used to remove the laser layer<br>
14 over the top surface area 352 and to remove the detector epitaxial layer 12<br>
around the periphery of the MPD so as to isolate it from the laser, as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 17. Preferably, this etching step takes place concurrently with the etching of<br>
laser 332, deflector 334 and detector 342, so that the photonic device is<br>
monolithically fabricated on the substrate. The detector 342 and the MPD 350 are<br>
both fabricated in layer 12, preferably at the same time, providing two photosensitive<br><br>
surface detectors for the photonic device 330. Fig. 16 shows an alternative technique<br>
than that used in Fig. 8, in that the contact layer of the p-i-n region 354 has not been<br>
removed from underneath the deflector 334, at the emitter end, but in this<br>
embodiment it is kept thin to prevent noticeable absorption of incoming light from the<br>
fiber 340.<br>
[00431	A more sensitive MPD for the photonic device 330 of Fig. 16 is<br>
illustrated at 360 in Fig. 18, wherein similar elements are similarly numbered. In this<br>
modification, a hood 362 is provided for the MPD 350 to protect the p-i-n active<br>
region 354 and to direct more of the light emitted from facet 358 onto surface 352.<br>
The hood is curved and extends from near the top surface 364 of the laser structure<br>
332 to near the most distant edge 366 of the MPD 350, with the curvature being<br>
concave to the MPD surface to direct the emitted light, as illustrated by dotted arrow<br>
368.<br>
[0044]	The hood is fabricated from, for example, polyimide 370, such as<br>
Photoneece™ PWDC-1000 photosensitive polyimide, which is substantially<br>
transparent at the emission wavelength of the laser 332, that is deposited, patterned<br>
and cured. During the curing of the polyimide, it rounds off, as illustrated, to produce<br>
a continuous curved surface. The surface of the hood is then coated with a metallic<br>
layer 372 to provide a reflective concave surface for directing light emitted from facet<br>
358 to the MPD 350. The hood thus directs the emitted light toward surface 352 for<br>
detection by the MPD 350, providing a sensitive monitor for the intensity of the light<br>
generated in laser 332. Furthermore, in view of the metalized surface, the hood<br>
substantially contains the light emitted from the back facet and prevents it from<br>
reaching any unwanted regions on or off the device 330. In order to maintain good<br><br>
electrical isolation, the metallic layer 372 does not make contact with the laser 332.<br>
[0045]	A modified form of the hood of Fig. 18 is illustrated in Fig. 19, wherein a<br>
laser 376 on a substrate 378 is illustrated. The curved hood for the monitoring<br>
detector 360 in Fig. 18 is replaced by a deflector for the monitoring photo detector<br>
380 having an angied facet 382. In this embodiment, the laser 376 may be an edge-<br>
emitting laser or a surface emitting laser, as described above. The deflector 380 is<br>
fabricated in the laser epitaxial structure through angled facet 382. The monitoring<br>
photo detector 388 is etched as a mesa, as described above with respect to Figs. 2,<br>
5, 8 or 11, for example, and the top of the detector is etched at a preferably 45°<br>
angle with respect to the surface of the substrate 378. The angled facet deflects light<br>
emitted from the back facet 384 of the laser, downwardly onto the p-i-n photo<br>
detector 388 formed in the detector epitaxy, for detection. The contact layer 386 may<br>
be formed from InGaAs of suitable doping, and needs to be thin to allow sufficient<br>
light to reach the i-region of the p-i-n photo detector 388.<br>
[0046]	Fig. 20 illustrates another embodiment 390 of the invention in the form<br>
of a bifurcated chip 392 including a semi-insulating substrate 394 having a surface-<br>
emitting laser 396 at one end 398 of the chip and a surface receiving detector 400 on<br>
the other end 402 of the chip. A monitoring photodetector 404 is formed on the<br>
substrate 394 to monitor the back facet 406 of the laser. Fig. 20 also illustrates an<br>
example of external components that may be used with the bifurcated chip to allow it<br>
to receive and emit light into a single fiber such as the single mode optical fiber 408<br>
spaced above the emitter facet 410 of the laser 396. Lenses 412 and 414 spaced<br>
above the exit facet 410 and above the detector 400, respectively, are used together<br>
with a dichroic prism 416, which is located between the lenses and the fiber 408, to<br><br>
allow light 418 from the fiber 408 to be directed to the surface receiving detector 400,<br>
while the laser light 420 is directed from the output facet 410 to the fiber 408.<br>
Although lenses based on silicon are shown in Fig. 20, it will be understood that<br>
other types lenses can also be used. It will also be understood other types of<br>
external components can be used with the bifurcated chip and that the surface-<br>
emitting HCSEL laser 396 may be replaced with an edge-emitting laser having<br>
suitable reflectors, and/or the surface receiving detector 400 may be replaced with<br>
an edge receiving detector, again, with suitable reflectors. The MPD detector 404 is<br>
shown as a surface-receiving detector, but it will be further understood that an edge-<br>
receiving detector may be used. In addition, a hood such as that illustrated in Fig. 18<br>
may also be used.<br>
[0047]	Fig. 21 illustrates at 430 a modified version of the photonic device 390<br>
that includes a third surface-receiving detector and similar external components to<br>
that of Fig. 20 to provide the functionality of a triplexer. As illustrated, this<br>
embodiment incorporates an edge-emitting laser 432 on a semi-insulating substrate<br>
434, with a reflector 436 having a dichroic filter 438 positioned adjacent an emitter<br>
facet 440 and above a detection 442 in the manner described above with respect to<br>
the embodiment of Fig. 11. An MPD 444 is located adjacent the back end facet 446<br>
of laser 432, and a remote detector 448 is mounted on the substrate 434 at the end<br>
of the substrate distant from the end where the laser emitter is located. Light 450 of a<br>
first wavelength emerges from the laser and is coupled to a fiber 452 through lens<br>
454 and one end of prism 456, while light of second and third wavelengths 458 and<br>
460 is directed from the fiber toward device 430. Detector 444 is an MPD and<br>
detects light of the first wavelength emitted from the back facet 446 of the laser. The<br><br>
second detector 442 underneath the dichroic coated deflector 436 receives the light<br>
458 of the second wavelength. The dichroic prism 456 of the external components<br>
directs the third wavelength 460 towards the third, surface-receive detector 448. The<br>
function performed by the photonic device and external components of Fig. 21 is that<br>
of a triplexer.<br>
