Rotor coiler<br>
The Invention relates to a rotor coiler with two reels mounted in a rotatable rotor, rotatorily drlvable independent of each other, designed for successive, continuous winding of hot-rolled strip, each of which reels has a reel mandrel which consists of several expandlngly movable segments which are supported on axially displaceable wedge-shaped sliding surfaces and with which the reels are traversable from a starting position Into a strip coil transfer position respectively by turning the rotor cyclically as well as with devices for guiding incoming hot-rolled strip onto the reel mandrel of the reel standing in the starting position and for<br>
applying the same to the reel mandrel until the slip-free holding of the strip.<br>
Through EP-PS 0 221 373, a rotor coiler for cold-rolled strip has already become known, which patent publication, however, has as its object the expanding and/or de-expanding of the reel mandrels.<br>
EP-OS 0 707 904 already discloses a device for winding strip-shaped rolled material which is pressed with an endless toothed chain partially winding round the first turns of a coil to be wound onto the reel mandrel. Through the deflection chain, damage to the strip start and wear of the reel mandrels readily occurs. In particular for the coiling of hot-rolled strip, such deflection chains are not suitable. Although this device for winding strip-shaped rolled material Is claimed to be suitable for revolving reels, there is a risk, should strip be wound for a lengthy period in the winding-on position, of contact occurring between the strip and the swivelled-up device for applying the strip to the reel. By no means is<br><br>
It possible to wind a complete coil in the winding-on position if necessary.<br>
The present invention Is therefore based on the technical problem of configuring a rotor coiler for hot-rolled-strip in such a way that very thin, fast-running hot-rolled strips can be wound without breaking out during the winding-up and essentially without any damage by the device for windlng-on, whereby it Is to be ensured that a complete coil can be wound in the starting position of the reel if necessary.<br>
To solve this problem, it is proposed according to the invention that the device for guiding and applying the incoming strip is located on a power-driven carriage displaceable paraxially to the reel.<br>
Due to the fact that the device for guiding and applying the Incoming strip Is located on a carriage which Is completely traversable out of the winding position, the device can also no longer be in the way if a complete coil has If necessary to be wound in the starting position of the reel,<br>
In order to prevent damage to the strip and to ensure secure winding-on, pressure rollers as well as deflection shells are located on the carriage, whereby the pressure rollers are preferably driven at a slightly higher speed than the strip speed so that a break-out of the strip cannot occur. Any damage to and jumping by the strip, e.g. at the deflection shells, are prevented In that the deflection shells are pressurized with a medium which Is directed through nozzles into the deflection shells against the strip, preferably in the running direction of the strip, so that the strip is pressed by the pressure medium away from the deflection shell against the reel mandrel.<br>
The Invention Is explained in further detail by means of a drawing in which<br><br>
Figure 1	shows a rotor coiler with coil to De wouna in staring<br>
position and planned ready-wound coil in strip coll transfer position<br>
Figure 2	shows the device for guiding and applying the incoming<br>
strip into a rotor coiler In cross-sectional representation.<br>
Figure 3	shows  the   side  view   of   the   device   for   guiding   and<br>
applying the Incoming strip,<br>
Figure 4	shows  an   alternative  to   the   device   for  guiding   and<br>
applying an Incoming strip according to Fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a rotor coiler 1 whose reel 2 is shown in the starting position and whose reel 3 is shown in the strip coil transfer position. The hot-rolled strip 4 coming from a mill train (not shown) is pressed by means of a medium 5, e.g. air or water, onto the roller table 6. The speed of the very thin hot-rolled strip can thereby be, for example, 20 m/sec. In the starting position of the reel ?, the hot-rolled strip 4 is wound on. A device 7 for guiding and applying the Incoming strip serves to ensure that the first windings of the coil to be wound can be wound securely and slip-free on the reel 2.<br>
A ready wound coil 8 is shown In the strip coll transfer position on the reel 3. Strip end rollers 9, 10 which are located on arresting shells 11,12 swlvellable against the coil 8 are driven at a slightly lower speed than the strip speed so that it is ensured that the strip end cannot flap round the reel 3 but sits firmly on the coil. On completion of the coil 8, it can be removed from the reel 3 after swinging out the mandrel support bearing (not shown) via the coil truck 13.<br>
The coil which is meanwhile wound on in starting position can, after traversing out the device 7 for guiding and applying the incoming strip (4), be swung from the rotor coiler 1 by swinging the reel 2 to the<br><br>
position of the reel 3 and that of the reel 3 to the position of the reel 2 into the strip coil transfer position, where the coil 8 Is finish-wound.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the device 7 for guiding and applying the Incoming strip. It consists of a frame 15 traversable on rails 14, on which frame the windlng-on unit 16 Is located. The winding-on unit 16 consists of pressure rollers 17, 18, 19 and deflection shells 20. 21. 22. The pressure roller 17 dnd the deflection shell 20 are attached to a swinging arm 23 and are swivelled with It round a fixed pivot 24 on the frame 15 by means of a piston-cylinder unit 25. Similarly, the pressure roller 18 and the deflection shell 21 are held by a swinging arm 26 which is swivellable by a piston-cylinder unit 28 round a pivot 27. Also the pressure roller 19 and the deflection shell 22 are held by a swinging arm 29 which is swivellable by a piston-cylinder unit 31 round the pivot 30. The piston-cylinder units 25, 28, 31 can swing the pressure rollers 17 through 19 and deflection shells 20 through 22 under position control from a winding-on position into an open position. When the strip start has run In, the piston-cylinder units 25. 28, 31 can be switched to pressure regulation. This provides the possibility for the distance between the reel mandrel and the position-controlled pressure rollers to be decreased from pressure roller 17 to pressure roller 19 before entry of the strip tip into the reel, thus forming an admission hopper.<br>
In the wlndlng-on position, the frame 15 Is fixed by hydraulically driven arresting devices 32 so that no displacement of the frame and of the winding-on unit 16 can occur in axial direction of the reel 2. Alternatively, the fixing can also be done by power-pressurized wedge surfaces by means of the displacement cylinder.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a side view of the frame 14 which has a bracket 33. The bracket 33 supports the motors 34. 34' as well as the gearboxes 35, 35' far the pressure rollers 17,18 and 19, whereby the pressure roller 19 is not to be seen in Fig. 3. Cardan shafts 36. 36' are provided between the gearboxes 35, 35' and the pressure rollers 17, 18, which shafts on the one<br><br>
hand effect the rotary drive of the pressure rollers 17 and 18. and on the other hand are able to counterbalance the swinging motion of the pressure rollers 17 and 18 and of the deflection shells 20 and 21 (not shown).<br>
Fig, 4 shows a winding-on unit 37 which Is to be seen as an alternative to the windlng-on unit 16. The windlng-on unit 37 Is also held on a frame 15 traversable on rails 14. Here, too, a swinging arm 38 Is provided, which supports the deflection shell 39. At the end of the swinging arm 38, however, a bearing lever 40 Is provided, which carries the pressure roller 17. The bearing lever 40 is swlvellable in opposition to the swinging arm 38 by means of a piston-cylinder unit 41, so that the pressure roller 17 is swivellable towards the reel 2 separately from the bearing shell 39. Thus, for example, the piston-cylinder unit 42 which drives the swinging arm 38 can be position-controlled and the piston-cylinder unit 41 which serves to press the pressure roller 17 can be operated under position and pressure control. The remaining pressure rollers and deflection shells are held and driven In a similar way,<br>
The kinematic system of the separate pressure-roller bearing on bearing levers 40 separately from the deflection shells 39 permits by reason of the low mass a sensitive and rapid-reaction adaptation of the pressure rollers 17 through 19 during the wlndlng-on of thin strips at high speed with simultaneous protection of the strip surface.<br><br>
