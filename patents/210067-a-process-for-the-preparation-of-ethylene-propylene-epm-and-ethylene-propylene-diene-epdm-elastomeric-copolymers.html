PROCESS  FOR  THE  PREPARATION  OF  ETHYLENE  PROPYLENE COPOLYMERS WITH A LOW CONTENT OF RESIDUAL CHLORINE. Abstract<br>
Process for the preparation of EP(D)M elastomeric copolymers in liquid phase, preferably in suspension of a liquid monomer, in the presence of a catalyst essentially consisting of a Vanadium compound, a cocatalyst essentially consisting of an Aluminium trialkyl, and optionally an activator, characterized in that the Aluminium aralkyl is essentially Aluminium trimethyl and the Vanadium compound, as such or prepolymerized is selected from:<br>
m<br>
(a)	compounds having general formula (I) VO(L)  (X) wherein n is an integer from 1 to 3 and m is from zero to 2, n+m being equal to 2 or 3;<br>
(b)	compounds having general formula (II) V(L) (X) wherein p is an integer from 1 to 4, q is from 0 to 3, the sum of p+q being equal to 3 or 4; wherein L is a bidentate ligand deriving from a 1,3-diketone  and  X  is  a halogen,  preferably Chlorine.<br><br>
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF ETHYLENE PROPYLENE COPOLYMERS WITH A LOW CONTENT OF RESIDUAL CHLORINE.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of ethylene propylene (EP) and ethylene -propylene - diene (EPDM) elastomeric copolymers with a low content of residual chlorine.<br>
More specifically the present invention relates to processes for the preparation of EP(D)M in liquid phase (solution or dispersion), preferably in liquid phase in a suspension of monomer.<br>
EP(D)M elastomeric copolymers are at present produced in the presence of catalysts containing inorganic chlorine which at the end of the polymerization remains englobed in the polymer, causing problems of corrosivity of the polymer itself.<br>
This problem is particularly felt in the case of polymerization with a slurry process (suspension of liquid monomer) in which the purification phase of the polymer is not very efficient.<br><br>
The process in suspension on the other hand is preferable for other reasons such as high productivity, energy saving and reduced environmental impact.<br>
The catalytic system used at present to produce EP(D)M elastomers essentially consists of a Vanadium salt, a chlorinated Aluminium alkyl and an activator.<br>
The presence of chlorinated aluminium alkyl is the cause of most problems of corrosivity; in addition the acidity of the Aluminium compound can lead to undesired cationic reactions on the double bonds of the terpoly-mers with the consequent formation of cross-linked material and consequently of non-dispersed particles on the surface of the end-products.<br>
Catalytic systems based on Vanadium are known however in which the aluminium compound is in the form of aluminium trialkyl and therefore not corrosive and with reduced Lewis acidity. These catalytic systems are satisfactorily used in the field of polyethylenes, but give EP(D)M with a wide molecular weight distribution.<br>
For example Polymer, 1972, vol.13, July, pages 307-314, describes the reaction rate of VCI3 + AIR3 systems, without chlorinated activators, in relation to the various R (methyl, ethyl, isopropyl) . From this study, it can be seen, in table 3, that TMA (trimethyl-aluminium) is slightly more active than TIBA (triisobu-<br><br>
tylaluminium) at 30'C, whereas at higher temperatures TMA has a considerably worse productivity than TIBA and TEA (triethyl aluminium).<br>
The catalytic system described in US-A-4.514.514 essentially consists of a compound of Vanadium, a chlorinated activator and an Aluminium alkyl- Table VI of this document shows how TMA gives even lower yields (about half) than TIBA and TEA.<br>
A process has now been found for the preparation of EP(D)M elastomeric copolymers which enables products with a low content of chlorine to be obtained.<br>
In accordance with this, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of ethylene-propylene (EPM) and ethylene-propylene-diene (EPDM) elastomeric copolymers in liquid phase, preferably in suspension of a liquid monomer, in the presence of a catalyst essentially consisting of a compound of Vanadium, a cocatalyst essentially consisting of an Aluminium trialkyl, and optionally an activator, preferably a chlorinated activator,<br>
characterized in that the Aluminium trialkyl is essentially Aluminium trimethyl and the Vanadium compound, as such or prepolymerized, is selected from: (a)  compounds having general formula (I) VO(L)’(X)<br>
wherein n is an integer from 1 to 3 and m is from<br><br>
zero to 2, n+m being equal to 2 or 3; (b)  compounds having general formula (II) V(L) (X)<br>
wherein p is an integer from 1 to 4, q is from<br>
zero to 3, the sum of p+q being equal to 3 or 4;<br>
wherein L is a bidentate ligand deriving from a<br>
1,3-diketone and X  is a halogen,  preferably<br>
Chlorine.<br>
In other words the compound LH, from which the bidentate anion L' derives from the release of a hydrogen atom, has the general formula R’-CO-Rj-CO-R’, wherein R’ and R3 are selected from -H and alkyl radicals, R2 is an alkylene, or R’ and R’ jointly form a 5 or 6 term cycle.<br>
Typical examples of Vanadium salts with bidentate ligands are acetylacetonate, 3-oxobutanalate (otherwise called 2-formylacetonate), 2-acetyl cyclopentanoate, 2-formyl cyclopentanoate (the latter two are described in Italian patent application IT-A-MI 96A 00294) , preferably acetylacetonate.<br>
In the preferred embodiment the Vanadium compound has general formula (II) , wherein q is zero. Even more preferably the Vanadium compound is Vanadium acetylacetonate.<br>
The above Vanadium compound can be used in the process of the present invention in the form of both<br><br>
solution and dispersion.<br>
When the Vanadium is in the form of a dispersion, it is preferable for the above Vanadium compound to have a particle size of less than 200 microns, preferably less than 3 0 microns. Mixtures of Vanadium compounds can also be used.<br>
The catalyst and cocatalyst can be fed separately to the polymerization environment, or, preferably, the Vanadium compound can be reacted with an organic compound of Aluminium before being introduced into the polymerization environment, according to the well-known preformation technique. The above organic compound of Aluminium has the general formula AIR X„ wherein R is a ‘ alkyl group, X is halogen, preferably Chlorine, n-fm=3. In the preferred embodiment the above organic compound of Aluminium is selected from diethylaluminium chloride (DEAC) and dimethylaluminium chloride.<br>
According to this technique, the interaction between Vanadium compound and organic compound of aluminium is carried out in the presence of ethylene (or ethylene and alpha-olefins) producing a prepolyme-rized catalytic species insoluble in the practically hydrocarbon reaction environment. The molar ratio between organic compound of aluminium and Vanadium compound is between 1 and 20, preferably from 1.5 to 5.<br><br>
The reaction time between Vanadium and Al-alkyl in an ethylene atmosphere, is between a few minutes and several hours, generally between 2 minutes and 2 hours, and is also selected in relation to the prepolymeriza-tion rate.<br>
The prepolymerizaticn is carried out in such a way that the ratio between grams of prepolymer and grams of Vanadium is between 2 and 150, preferably between 6 and 35, more preferably from 8 to 15, The above treatment can be carried out within a wide temperature range which can vary from -30’C to 80’C, preferably from 15 to 30"C. The catalytic species thus obtained can be stored and used directly in the form of suspension, as obtained in the above process; alternatively it is possible to filtrate and dry the catalytic precipitate thus obtained, and in this case the catalytic Vanadium compound will be predisposed in the desired solvent. At the end of the prepolymerizaticn process, granules of catalyst covered with a layer of homo or copolymer are obtained. The contact between organic compound of Aluminium and Vanadium compound can be carried out at essentially atmospheric pressure, or under ethylene pressure (or ethylene and alpha-olefin), generally less than 10 atmospheres, preferably at atmospheric pressure.<br><br>
The process of the present invention comprises the use of TMA (Aluminium trimethyl) as cocatalyst. The molar ratio between the above cocatalyst and Vanadium (intended as compound having general formula (I) or (II) or as prepolymerized compound) is between 3 and 1000, preferably between 9 and 100, even more preferably between 15 and 50.<br>
In the process of the present invention it is preferable to use an activator. These activators usually belong to the group of chlorinated organic compounds, for example ethyl trichloroacetate, n-butyl perchlorocrotonate, diethyl dichloromalonate, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform. The molar ratio between activator and Vanadium can vary from 0/1 to 10 0 0/1, preferably from 0-5/1 to 40/1, even more preferably from 1/1 to 10/1.<br>
The polymerization process of the present invention is carried out in liquid phase, preferably in a reaction medium in which the polymer is substantially insoluble. In the preferred embodiment the reaction medium prevalently consists of one of the comonomers, to which a saturated hydrocarbon, such as propane, butane, pentane, hexane, is optionally added as diluent, or relative mixtures with aromatic hydrocarbons. In the preferred embodiment the diluent essentially<br><br>
consists of propane.<br>
The polymerization temperature is maintained at between -5'C and 65'C, preferably from 25'C to 50'C, The contact times vary from 10 minutes to 6 hours, preferably from 15 minutes to 1 hour.<br>
The polymerization is preferably carried out with hydrogen as moderator and molecular weight regulator, operating at a total pressure of between 5 and 100 bars, preferably from 8 to 30 bars, with a ratio between partial ethylene pressure and partial hydrogen pressure of more than 4, preferably more than 20. Other compounds however can be used as molecular weight regulators, for example diethyl zinc.<br>
The elastomeric copolymers which can be obtained with the process of the present invention contain from 35% to 85% by weight of ethylene, preferably from 45% to 75% by weight, and have an intrinsic viscosity, measured at 135°C in o-dichlorobenzene, of between 0.5 and 6 dl/g, preferably from 1 to 3 dl/g. The above ethylene-propylene elastomeric copolymers can also contain higher alpha-olefins, generally in a quantity of not more than 20% by weight, usually less than 10%. The term higher alpha-olefins refers to alpha-olefins having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, for example butene-1, pentene-1, hexene-1.<br><br>
As is known to experts in the field, ethylene and propylene can be copolymerized with non-conjugated dienes to give (EPDM) elastomeric terpolymers. These sermonizers can be selected from:<br>
dienes with a linear chain such as 1,4-hexadiene and 1,6-octadiene;<br>
cyclic dienes with a branched chain such as 5-methyl-l,4-hexadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-l,6-octadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-l,7-octadiene;<br>
alicyclic dienes with a single ring such as 1/4-cyclohexadiene; 1,5-cyclooctadiene; 1,5-cyclodode-cadiene;<br>
dienes having fused and bridged alicyclic rings, such as methyltetrahydroindene; dicyclopentadiene; bicyclo [2.2.l]hepta-2,5-2,5-diene; alkenyl, alkylide-ne, cycloalkenyl, and cycloalkylidene norbornenes such as 5-methylene-2-norbornene; 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB); 5-propenyl-2-norbornene.<br>
The above non-conjugated dienes can be present in a maximum quantity of 20% by weight, preferably 12% by weight.<br>
Under the same conditions, the process of the present invention allows the production of copolymers and terpolymers with a low content of chlorine and narrow molecular weight distribution- In addition the<br><br>
productivity is higher than the catalytic systems used in the prior art-<br>
The process of the present invention can also be carried out in the presence of solid particles, for example carbon-black or silica, to improve the recovery of the elastomer thus produced, as described in the Italian patent application filed by the same applicant IT-A-MI 95A 02499.<br>
The following examples provide a better understanding of the present invention. EXAMPLES<br>
The examples refer to tests carried out in the laboratory with 3 litre reactors operating batchwise.<br>
All the reagents are commercial products; the solvents and liquid activators were desecrated under nitrogen and anhydrified on alumina or molecular sieves.<br>
The copolymers obtained were thus characterized: — Composition and reactivity ratio: these were determined by infra-red analysis of the polymer in the form of a film having a thickness of 0.2 mm using a Perkin Elmer FTIR spectrophotometer model 17 60; the propylene content was determined by measuring the ratio between the absorbances of the bands at 4390 and 42 55 cm""' and using a calibration curve calibrated with<br><br>
standard polymers.<br>
Mooney Viscosity ML(l+4): this was determined at 100 and 125’C according to ASTM D 1646-87.<br>
Molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn): this was determined by gel permeation chromatography technique, in 1,2-dichloroben2ene, using PL-GEL® (produced by Polymer Lab) as stationary phase with particles of 10 /im and a porosity of 10’, 10"‘, 10’, 10’ nm, respectively. The calculation of the molecular weights was corrected in relation to the average composition of the polymer according to the equation proposed by Shelter.<br>
The melting heat correlated to the crystalline of the polymers was determined by DSC with a Perkin-Elmer DDC 7 instrument in an inert atmosphere and with a scanning velocity of 20°C/minute; the crystalloid datum was obtained by relating the melting heat of the polymer to the melting heat of the polyethylene estimated at 286 J7g.<br>
The intrinsic viscosity was determined in 1,2-dichloroethane at 135'C.<br>
The catalyst used in the experimental examples is a catalyst prepared according to the method indicated in Italian patent application 9 5 IT-MI 1403 filed by the same applicant, according to what is described in example 10 of the above patent application. According<br><br>
to this technique the catalytic system is prepared by mixing, in an atmosphere of ethylene (or ethylene and alpha-olefin), Vanadium (III) acetylacetonate suspended in paraffin oil and an essentially hydrocarbon solution of DEAC (diethylaluminium chloride). The solid thus obtained is used as catalytic system. Comparative EXAMPLE 1<br>

The data of table 1 show how the process of the present invention enables to improve, contrary to what is described in the prior art, the catalytic yields and consequently to produce with a lower content of residual chlorine.<br>
The difference in yield, already distinct at 40'C, becomes enormous at 60°C. It should also be noted that the reaction of examples 6 and 7 was interrupted after 20 and 30 minutes respectively.<br>
In addition the elastomers obtained according to<br><br>
the process of the present invention are all characterized by a much better molecular weight distribution and crystalline with respect to the comparative examples. This indicates a better applicability as elastomers of the products with a low chlorine content which can be obtained with the process of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
