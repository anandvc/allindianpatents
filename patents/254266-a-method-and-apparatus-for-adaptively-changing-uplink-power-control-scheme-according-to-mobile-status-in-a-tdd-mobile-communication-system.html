Description<br>
APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR ADAPTIVELY CHANGING<br>
UPLINK POWER CONTROL SCHEME ACCORDING TO<br>
MOBILE STATUS IN A TDD MOBILE COMMUNICATION<br>
SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
[ 1 ]	The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for detennining<br>
a power control scheme in a time division duplex (TDD) mobile communication<br>
system, and in particular, to an apparatus and method for changing an uplink power<br>
control scheme according to the status of a subscriber station (SS).<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	As one of the duplex schemes, Time Division Duplex (TDD) uses two distinct sets<br>
of time slots on the same frequency for the uplink from a base station (BS) to a<br>
Subscriber Station (SS) and the downlink from the SS to the BS. Another major duplex<br>
scheme is frequency division duplex (FDD). FDD uses two distinct frequencies for the<br>
uplink and the downlink.<br>
[3]	Unlike FDD, the uplink and the downlink share the same frequency band in TDD<br>
and are separated by time slots dedicated to them. That is, time slots are separately<br>
preset for the uplink signal and the downlink signal. Therefore, the uplink and<br>
downlink signals are transmitted only in their assigned time slots. TDD has the<br>
advantage of high frequency use efficiency.<br>
[4]	The mobile communication system schedules bursty uplink/downlink packets. Par-<br>
ticularly, the BS decides a modulation and coding scheme (MCS) for the resources to<br>
be allocated and already allocated resources in uplink/downlink packet scheduling for<br>
an SS. An MCS level to be used depends on the status of the SS. For the uplink<br>
scheduling, the BS takes into account the maximum transmit power of the SS. Since<br>
the transmit power of the SS is restricted to a set level, the BS performs scheduling<br>
taking into account the allocated resources, an MCS level to be applied for the<br>
resources, and the transmit power limit of the SS. To do so, the scheduler of the BS<br>
must have knowledge of the power headroom or transmit power of the SS.<br>
[5]	Typically, the mobile communication system uses downlink and uplink power<br>
control to increase call capacity and achieve good call quality. That is, if the BS<br>
receives a signal from an SS at a signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) that ensures the<br>
minimum required call quality by controlling the transmit power of all of the SSs,<br>
system capacity can be maximized. In the case where the signal from the SS is<br>
received in the BS at a higher power level, the performance of the SS is increased at<br><br>
the expense of increasing interference from other SSs sharing the same channel. As a<br>
result, system capacity is decreased or the call quality of other subscribers drops.<br>
[6]	Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)/Orthogonal Frequency<br>
Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) has recently been proposed as a physical layer<br>
scheme for a 4th generation mobile communication system. The above-described power<br>
control has also emerged as a challenging issue to the OFDM/OFDMA system.<br>
[7]	OFDM/OFDMA is a transmission scheme based on the IEEE 802.16 standard, in<br>
which a serial modulation symbol sequence is transmitted as parallel data. OFDM/<br>
OFDMA operates in TDD. In OFDM, 256 modulation symbols are Fast-<br>
Fourier-Transformed (FFT-processed) to one OFDM symbol, whereas in OFDMA,<br>
one OFDM symbol is formed with more modulation symbols. According to the IEEE<br>
802.16-based OFDMA, the subcarriers of one OFDM symbol are grouped into<br>
subchannels and a plurality of OFDM symbols form one frame.<br>
[8]	FIG. 1 illustrates an OFDMA frame structure specified by IEEE 802.16. The<br>
horizontal axis represents OFDM symbol indexes and the vertical axis represents<br>
subchannel indexes.<br>
[9]	Referring to FIG. 1, an OFDMA frame is comprised of a plurality of bursts each<br>
marked by a square on a time-frequency plane. Since the frame is time-<br>
division-duplexed, the downlink period and the uplink period can be flexibly<br>
controlled. For example, kth through (k+8)th symbols are allocated to the downlink and<br>
(k+9)th through (k+12)th symbols are allocated to the uplink, as illustrated in FIG. 1. In<br>
the OFDMA frame, a DL/UL MAP burst delivers configuration information (e.g.<br>
position, length, and MCS level) about a plurality of downlink/uplink bursts allocated<br>
to the frame. The bursts other than the DL/UL MAP burst transfer a DL/UL-Medium<br>
Access Control (MAC) layer control message and downlink/uplink data packets. Par-<br>
ticularly, the control message bursts can be a power control change request/command<br>
message burst for controlling the power control scheme of each SS, or a power control<br>
message burst for controlling the transmit power of each SS. The bursts are time-<br>
division-multiple-accessed between SSs and the BS. Transmission gaps called<br>
transmit/receive transition gap (TTG) and receive/transmit transition gap (RTG) are<br>
inserted between the downlink and uplink periods.<br>
[10]	Meanwhile, each SS performs initial ranging and periodic ranging to correct time<br>
and frequency errors in uplink bursts and control power. When the SS attempts<br>
ranging, the BS measures the power of a signal from the SS and transmits to the SS a<br>
MAC message including a compensation value for signal power loss caused by path at-<br>
tenuation and rapid signal power change.<br>
[11]	Now a description will be made of an uplink power control method in a normal<br>
mode in the OFDM/OFDMA TDD system. The uplink power control is executed in<br><br>
two steps.<br>
[12]	In the first step, the BS carries out power control. The BS scheduler determines<br>
available resources and an available MCS level for uplink transmission within the<br>
transmit power range of an SS of interest by<br>
[13]<br><br>
where SNRreq and BWreq respectively denote the required SNR and bandwidth for<br><br>
applying an MCS level to the current packet to be scheduled. SNR UL,RX  and BWRX<br>
denote the received SNR and allocated bandwidth of a reference signal, respectively.<br>
The reference signal is a previously received uplink burst signal, a data signal or a<br>
control signal. MARGINTX is a term that represents a channel change. That, this<br>
margin is set considering the difference between the time of scheduling based on<br>
Equation (1) and the actual time of transmitting an uplink signal. Headroom is the<br>
transmit power margin of the SS, calculated by subtracting the current transmit power<br>
from the maximum transmit power of the SS. The BS is assumed to have knowledge of<br>
the maximum transmit power of the SS.<br><br>
satisfying Equation (1) ensures that the SS transmits an uplink signal with the<br>
resources and MCS level scheduled within the limited power.<br>
[14]	In the second step, the SS performs power control. The uplink power control is<br>
considered in two ways: closed-loop power control and open-loop power control.<br>
[15]	The uplink closed power control is a scheme of controlling the transmit power of<br>
the SS according to a command from the BS. The BS notifies the SS of a required<br>
power increment/decrement<br><br>
as well as the resources and MCS level scheduled by Equation (1).<br>
[ 16]	The uplink open-loop power control is a scheme of deciding the uplink transmit<br>
power in the SS itself. The BS simply tells the SS the resources and MCS level decided<br>
by Equation (1) and the SS then computes the uplink transmit power of an uplink<br>
signal to be transmitted using the allocated resources by<br>
[17]<br><br><br>
where PL and PL denote uplink and downlink path losses, respectively. In view of<br>
the TDD system, these two values are almost the same. The SS can estimate PL<br>
using the transmit power of the BS, PDL.TX  and the downlink received power PDL.TX  of<br>
°		<br>
the SS. NIDL.TX is the power of a signal and interference measured at a receiver of the<br>
BS, common to all of the SSs. SNRreq and BWreq respectively denote the required SNR<br>
and bandwidth for an MCS level to be applied to a packet. MARGIN is a term that<br>
represents the difference between the time to which Equation (2) is computed for ap-<br>
plication and the actual uplink transmission time.<br>
[18]	FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating a signal flow for a conventional closed-loop power<br>
control.<br>
[19]	Referring to FIG. 2, the SS transmits a reference signal and information about the<br>
uplink transmit power of the reference signal (UL_Tx, Power) in an uplink burst to the<br>
BS in step 201.<br>
[20]	In step 203, the BS (scheduler) calculates the received SNR of the reference signal<br>
and determines resources, an MCS level, and a power increment<br>
AP<br>
for the SS by Equation (1). Headroom involved in Equation (1) can be calculated using<br>
the information of the transmit power (UL_Tx, Power).<br>
[21]	In step 205, the BS allocates the uplink resources to the SS according to the<br>
scheduling (UL_MAP) and transmits a power control command (or the power<br>
increment) to the SS. The resource assignment (UL_MAP) information is delivered in<br>
a UL-MAP burst and the power control command is set in a DL burst containing a pre-<br>
determined control message.<br>
[22]	The SS determines its uplink transmit power according to the power control<br>
command in step 207 and transmits packets using the allocated resources in step 209.<br>
Thereafter, step 203 (BS scheduling) through step 209 (uplink transmission) are<br>
repeated.<br>
[23]	As described before, the power control command is selectively transmitted in the<br>
closed-loop power control. Only if the channel status is changed and the SNR of an<br>
uplink received signal is changed, does the BS transmit a power control command to<br>
the SS. In the absence of the power control command, the SS determines its uplink<br><br>
transmit power based on the previous uplink transmit power by<br>
[24]<br><br>
where Pnew and PLast  denote the new transmit power and the previous transmit power,<br><br>
respectively, SNRNew  and SNRLast  denote a required new SNR and the previous<br><br>
required SNR, respectively, and BWNew  and BWLast  denote a new allocated SNR and<br><br>
the previous allocated SNR, respectively.<br>
[25]	FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating a signal flow for a conventional open-loop power<br>
control.<br>
[26]	Referring to FIG. 3, the SS transmits a reference signal and information about the<br>
uplink transmit power of the reference signal (UL_Tx, Power) in an uplink burst to the<br>
BS in step 301.<br>
[27]	In step 303, the BS (scheduler) calculates the received SNR of the reference signal<br>
and determines resources, an MCS level, and a power increment<br><br>
for the SS by Equation (1). Headroom involved in Equation (1) can be calculated using<br>
the information of the transmit power (UL_Tx, Power).<br>
[28]	In step 305, the BS allocates the uplink resources to the SS according to the<br>
scheduling (UL_MAP) and transmits the uplink resource assignment (UL_MAP) in-<br>
formation to the SS. Compared to the closed-loop power control, a power control<br>
command is not transmitted in the open-loop power control. Instead, the BS broadcasts<br>
in a DL-MAP burst PDL,TX  and NIDL,TX  necessary for the computation of Equation (2) to<br><br>
all of the SSs.<br>
[29]	The SS determines its uplink transmit power using the resource assignment in-<br>
formation by Equation (2) in step 307 and transmits an uplink signal using the<br>
allocated resources in step 309. At the same time, the SS tells the BS the current<br>
transmit power. Thereafter, step 303 (BS scheduling) through step 309 (uplink<br>
transmission) are repeated.<br>
[30]	As described earlier, in contrast to the closed-loop power control, the open-loop<br>
power control scheme provide to the BS information about the current uplink transmit<br>
power along with the uplink transmission because the SS can change the uplink<br>
transmit power freely. Equation (2) that the SS uses in deciding the transmit power<br>
includes a channel variation which is not known to the BS and thus the headroom of<br>
the SS is changed, unnoticed by the BS. Therefore, the SS tells the BS the current<br><br>
transmit power at every uplink transmission so that the BS can update the headroom.<br>
[31]	On the other hand, in the closed-loop power control, the transmit power of the SS<br>
is changed by a power control command from the BS or a transmit power calculation<br>
formula (Equation (3)) known to the BS. Accordingly, the BS can distinguish a<br>
transmit power change from a channel change in the SNR estimate of an uplink signal.<br>
That is, the BS can execute a power control taking the channel change into account, as<br>
shown in Equation (1). The headroom can also be calculated using the previous<br>
headroom and the previous power control command or using the transmit power of the<br>
SS that the bas station can estimate by Equation (3). Consequently, the SS does not<br>
need to notify the BS of its transmit power at every uplink transmission in the closed-<br>
loop power control.<br>
[32]	The features of the two power control schemes are summarized below in Table 1.<br>
[33]<br><br>
As noted from Table 1, the closed-loop and open-loop power control schemes differ in<br>
uplink/downlink feedback, scheduling margin, and maximum transmit power margin.<br>
The uplink/downlink feedback has been described before. The scheduling margin is<br>
MARGIN in both power control schemes because a scheduling time point coincides<br>
with an actual uplink transmission time in them. The maximum transmit power margin<br>
is defined as the maximum difference between a required transmit power satisfying<br>
SNR at the receiver and an actual transmit power. For the closed-loop power control,<br>
the maximum transmit power margin is MARGIN since the actual transmit power is<br>
decided at scheduling. For the open-loop power control, the actual transmit power is<br>
decided by Equation (2) and thus the maximum transmit power margin is MARGIN<br>
. The scheduling margin leads to resource assignment loss, and the maximum transmit<br>
power margin results in an increase in total system interference.<br>
[34]	If the SS moves slowly, the closed-loop power control performs better on the<br>
whole. Because the channel does not change much at a low mobile velocity, the power<br>
control command is not issued frequendy and thus the amount of downlink feedback<br>
information is small. MARGIN affected by the channel variation is also very small.<br><br>
Also, the scheduling is done and the transmit power is decided according to the actual<br>
uplink channel status, as in Equation (1). Therefore, the uplink power control can be<br>
performed with high reliability.<br>
[35]	On the contrary, if the SS moves fast, the open-loop power control outperforms the<br>
closed-loop power control. The channel changes greatly at a high mobile velocity and<br>
thus the number of occurrences of the power control command in the closed-loop<br>
power control is approximately equal to the number of transmit power feedbacks in the<br>
open-loop power control. However, because MARGIN &gt; MARGIN , the closed-<br>
loop power control tracks the channel variation consuming much resources, or cannot<br>
track the channel variation at all. As a result, the closed-loop power control causes<br>
greater interference than the open-loop power control in the case where the SS moves<br>
fast.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[36]	As described above, the closed-loop and open-loop power control schemes offer<br>
their benefits according to the velocity of the mobile terminal. Nevertheless, con-<br>
ventional systems adopt only one of the two power control schemes. In another case,<br>
the open-loop power control applies to an initial access, and the closed-loop power<br>
control applies thereafter. Thus, the conventional systems do not fully utilize the<br>
advantages of the closed-loop and open-loop power control schemes.<br>
[37]	An object of the present invention is to substantially solve at least the above<br>
problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages below. Ac-<br>
cordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and method for<br>
adaptively determining a power control scheme according to mobile velocity in a<br>
mobile communication system.<br>
[38]	Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and method for<br>

[39]	The above objects are achieved by providing an apparatus and method for<br>
adaptively changing an uplink power control scheme according to mobile status in a<br>
TDD mobile communication system.<br>
[40]	According to an aspect of the present invention, in a base station in a mobile com-<br>
munication system supporting a plurality of uplink power control schemes, a mobility<br>
estimator generates a mobility index by estimating the velocity of a subscriber station,<br>
and a power controller selects a power control scheme for the uplink of a subscriber<br>
station from among the plurality of power control schemes by comparing the mobility<br>
index with a threshold.<br><br>
[41]	According to another aspect of the present invention, in a subscriber station device<br>
in a mobile communication system supporting a plurality of power control schemes, a<br>
MAC entity extracts, upon receipt of a power control change command message from<br>
a base station, information about a power control scheme requested by the base station<br>
from the power control change command message, and a power controller selects a<br>
power control scheme according to the extracted information received from the MAC<br>
entity and determines the transmit power of an uplink burst according to the selected<br>
power control scheme.<br>
[42]	According to a further aspect of the present invention, in a method of determining<br>
an uplink power control scheme in a mobile communication system supporting a<br>
plurality of uplink power control schemes, a base station selects a power control<br>
scheme for the uplink of a subscriber station according to the status of the subscriber<br>
station and transmits to the subscriber station a power control change command<br>
message including information about the selected power control scheme. The<br>
subscriber station extracts, upon receipt of the power control change command<br>
message from the base station, the power control scheme information from the power<br>
control change command message and selects a power control scheme according to the<br>
extracted information.<br>
[43]	According to still another aspect of the present invention, in a method of de-<br>
termining an uplink power control scheme in a mobile communication system<br>
supporting a plurality of uplink power control schemes, a subscriber station transmits<br>
to a base station a power control change request message including information about a<br>
requested power control scheme. The base station selects, upon receipt of the power<br>
control change request message, a power control scheme for the uplink of the<br>
subscriber station and transmits a power control change command message including<br>
information about the selected power control scheme to the subscriber station. The<br>
subscriber station extracts, upon receipt of the power control change command<br>
message from the base station, the power control scheme information from the power<br>
control change command message and selects a power control scheme according to the<br>
information extracted by the subscriber station.<br>
[44]	According to yet another aspect of the present invention, in a method of de-<br>
termining an uplink power control scheme in a mobile communication system<br>
supporting a plurality of uplink power control schemes, a base station generates a<br>
mobility index by estimating the velocity of a subscriber station, selects a power<br>
control scheme for the uplink of a subscriber station according to the mobility index,<br>
and transmits to the subscriber station a power control change command message<br>
including information about the selected power control scheme, if the selected power<br>
control scheme is different from a previous power control scheme.<br><br>
[45]	According to yet further aspect of the present invention, in a method of de-<br>
termining an uplink power control scheme in a mobile communication system<br>
supporting a plurality of power control schemes, a subscriber station extracts from the<br>

command message from a base station, information about a power control scheme<br>
requested by the base station, selects a power control scheme according to the<br>
extracted information, and determines the transmit power of an uplink burst according<br>
to the selected power control scheme.<br>

[59]	The present invention is intended to provide an apparatus and method for selecting<br>
a closed-loop power control scheme or an open-loop power control scheme for uplink<br>
power control according to mobile status in a mobile communication system. While<br>
the present invention will be described in the context of an IEEE 802.16e com-<br>
munication system, for the sake of convenience, the power control scheme changing<br>
method of the present invention is applicable to all other Time Division Duplex (TDD)<br>
communication systems.<br>
[60]	FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a BS in a TDD communication system according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The BS includes a MAC entity 401 connected to<br>
a higher layer, a TDD transmission MODEM 403, a TDD reception MODEM 405, a<br>
duplexer 407, an uplink power controller 409, a mobility estimator 411, and a<br>
scheduler 413.<br>
[61]	Referring to FIG. 4, the MAC entity 401 receives transmission data from the higher<br>
layer and processes the received data in compliance with the connection protocol of the<br>
TDD transmission MODEM 403. The MAC entity 401 receives data from the TDD<br>
reception MODEM 405, processes the received data in compliance with the connection<br>
protocol of the higher layer, and provides the processed data to the higher layer.<br>
[62]	The TDD transmission MODEM 403, which includes a channel encoder, a<br>
modulator, and an RF transmission unit, converts the data received from the MAC<br>
entity 401 to a form suitable for radio transmission. The modulator performs spreading<br>
in a code division multiple access (CDMA) communication system, and OFDM<br>
modulation (IFFT) in an OFDM communication system.<br>
[63]	The TDD reception MODEM 405, which includes an RF reception unit, a de-<br>
modulator, and a channel decoder, recovers a radio signal received from the duplexer<br>
407, and provides the recovered signal to the MAC entity 401.<br>
[64]	The duplexer 407 provides a signal received in TDD from an antenna (uplink<br>
signal) to the TDD reception MODEM 405, and provides the transmission signal<br>
received from the TDD transmission MODEM 403 (downlink signal) to the antenna.<br>
[65]	The scheduler 413 schedules uplink and downlink data transmission according to<br>
data transmission status and the channel statuses of the individual SSs, and orders the<br>
Subscriber Station (SS)s to transmit and receive data as scheduled. In an IEEE 802.16<br><br>
communication system, for example, the scheduler 413 generates UL-MAP and DL-<br>
MAP as uplink and downlink configuration information, and the MAC entity 401<br>
receives an uplink signal and transmits a downlink signal according to the UL-MAP<br>
and DL-MAP from the scheduler 413.<br>
[66]	The mobility estimator 411 determines a mobility index by estimating the mobility<br>
status of an individual SS from a radio signal received from the SS. Many mobility<br>
status estimation algorithms are available and any one of them can be assumed to be<br>
used herein. In accordance with the embodiment of the present invention, a higher<br>
mobility index indicates a higher mobile velocity.<br>
[67]	The uplink power controller 409 is responsible for the closed-loop or open-loop<br>
power control. It determines the resources and an MCS level available to each mobile<br>
terminal in a predetermined method (e.g. Equation (1)) and tells the scheduler 413 the<br>
detennined resources and the MCS level. In the case of the closed-loop power control,<br>
the uplink power controller 409 generates a power control command for an individual<br>
SS to the MAC entity 401. The power control schemes have been described in detail<br>
and their description is not provided herein.<br>
[68]	In accordance with the present invention, the uplink power controller 409<br>
determines a power control scheme for the SS based on the mobility index received<br>
from the mobility estimator 411. This determination can be made every set time period<br>
or upon receipt from the SS of a power control change request. If the power control<br>
scheme is changed for the SS, the uplink power controller 409 provides to the MAC<br>
entity 401 a power control command for the SS. The MAC entity generates a power<br>
control change command message according to the power control change command<br>
and provides it to the TDD transmission MODEM 403.<br>
[69]	FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating power control state transitions of the BS depending<br>
on which power control scheme is selected in the TDD communication system<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[70]	Referring to FIG. 5, a status variable called power control mode change (PMC) is<br>
used in deciding a power control scheme. If PMC is '0', it indicates selection of the<br>
closed-loop power control. If the PMC is T, it indicates selection of the open-loop<br>
power control.<br>
[71]	In the state where PMC=0, if the mobility index received from the mobility<br>
estimator 411 is less than a threshold, the state PMC=0 is kept, as indicated by<br>
reference numeral 505. If the mobility index is greater than the threshold, the state<br>
PMC=0 is transitioned to the state PMC=l, as indicated by reference numeral 511.<br>
Similarly, in the state where PMC=1, if the mobility index is greater than the threshold,<br>
the state PMC=1 is kept, as indicated by reference numeral 509. If the mobility index<br>
is less than the threshold, the state PMC=1 is transitioned to the state PMC=0, as<br><br>
indicated by reference numeral 507. If the PMC value is changed, this implies that a<br>
different power control scheme from the previous one has been selected. Thus, a power<br>
control change command is transmitted to the SS, notifying the SS of the change of the<br>
power control scheme.<br>
[72]	With reference to the state transition diagram of FIG. 5, the operation of the BS<br>
will be described below.<br>
[73]	FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating an operation for determining in the BS an uplink<br>
power control scheme in the TDD communication system according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. As stated before, a decision can be made as to which power<br>
control scheme is to be used at a set time period or upon receipt of a power control<br>
change request from the SS. These two methods can also be used in combination. The<br>
following description is made under the assumption that the decision is made pe-<br>
riodically.<br>
[74]	Referring to FIG. 6, the BS determines if a predetermined time period has elapsed<br>
and thus if it is time to set a power control scheme in step 601. If it is time to set a<br>
power control scheme, the mobility estimator 411 compares a calculated mobility<br>
index with the threshold in step 603. In step 605, the BS compares the mobility index<br>
with the threshold. If the mobility index is less than the threshold, the BS sets PMC to<br>
0 in step 607. Since the mobility index being less than the threshold means that the SS<br>
moves slowly, the power control scheme is set to the closed-loop power control. On<br>
the contrary, if the mobility index is greater than the threshold, the BS sets PMC to 1 in<br>
step 609. Since the mobility index being greater than the threshold means that the SS<br>
moves fast, the power control scheme is set to the open-loop power control.<br>
[75]	In step 611, the BS determines if the PMC has been toggled by comparing the<br>
power control scheme set currently with the previous power control scheme. If PMC<br>
has not been changed, the BS returns to step 601. If PMC has been changed, the BS<br>
transmits to the SS a power control change command message including information<br>
the changed power control scheme in step 613 and returns to step 601. The detailed<br>
structure of the power control change command message is illustrated below in Table<br>
3.<br>
[76]	As described above, the BS decides whether to change the power control scheme<br>
and the SS changes its power control scheme only by the power control change<br>
command received from the BS.<br>
[77]	FIG. 7 is a block diagram of the SS in the TDD communication system according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[78]	The SS of the present invention includes a MAC entity 701 connected to a higher<br>
layer, a TDD transmission MODEM 703, a TDD reception MODEM 705, a duplexer<br>
707, a power controller 709, and a mobility estimator 711.<br><br>
[79]	Referring to FIG. 7, the MAC entity 701 receives transmission data from the higher<br>
layer and processes the received data in compliance with the connection protocol of the<br>
TDD transmission MODEM 703. The MAC entity 701 receives data from the TDD<br>
reception MODEM 705, processes the received data in compliance with the connection<br>
protocol of the higher layer, and provides the processed data to the higher layer. The<br>
functions of the MAC entity 701 are performed as commanded by the BS scheduler<br>
413. In the IEEE 802.16 communication system, for example, the scheduler 413<br>
generates UL-MAP and DL-MAP as uplink and downlink configuration information,<br>
and the MAC entity 701 of the SS receives a downlink signal and transmits an uplink<br>
signal according to the DL-MAP and UL-MAP received from the scheduler 413.<br>
[80]	The TDD transmission MODEM 703, which includes a channel encoder, a<br>
modulator, and an RF transmission unit, converts the data received from the MAC<br>
entity 701 to a form suitable for radio transmission. Particularly, the TDD transmission<br>
MODEM 703 adjusts the transmit power of the uplink signal according to an uplink<br>
transmit power value received from the power controller 709.<br>
[81]	The TDD reception MODEM 705, which includes an RF unit, a demodulator, and<br>
a channel decoder, recovers a radio signal received from the duplexer 707, and<br>
provides the recovered signal to the MAC entity 701. The duplexer 707 provides a<br>
signal received in TDD from an antenna (downlink signal) to the TDD reception<br>
MODEM 705, and provides the transmission signal received from the TDD<br>
transmission MODEM 703 (uplink signal) to the antenna.<br>
[82]	The mobility estimator 711 determines a mobility index by estimating the mobility<br>
status of the SS from a radio downlink signal received from the BS, and provides the<br>
mobility index to the power controller 709. Many mobility status estimation algorithms<br>
are available and any one of them can be used herein. In accordance with the<br>
embodiment of the present invention, it is assumed that a higher mobility index<br>
indicates a higher mobile velocity.<br>
[83]	The power controller 709 is responsible for the closed-loop or open-loop power<br>
control. For the closed-loop power control, the power controller 709 determines uplink<br>
transmit power according to a power control command received from the BS or by<br>
Equation (3), and provides the uplink power transmit power value to the TDD<br>
transmission MODEM 703. For the open-loop power control, the power controller 709<br>
determines the uplink transmit power by Equation (2) and provides it to the TDD<br>
transmission MODEM 703. In the case of calculating the uplink transmit power by<br>
Equation (2) or Equation (3), information about required bandwidth and SNR is<br>
acquired from the resource assignment information (UL-MAP) received from the BS.<br>
These power control schemes have been described before in detail and their description<br>
is not provided herein.<br><br>
[84]	In accordance with the present invention, the power controller 709 adaptively<br>
selects a power control scheme according to the power control change command<br>
received from the BS. To be more specific, the power control change command<br>
message is provided to the MAC entity 701 through the TDD transmission MODEM<br>
705. The MAC entity 701 extracts a power control change command indicating a<br>
power control scheme from the message. The power controller 709 then selects a<br>
power control scheme according to the power control change command received from<br>
the MAC entity 701.<br>
[85]	The power controller 709 can request changing the uplink power control scheme to<br>
the BS. Specifically, the power controller 709 selects a power control scheme<br>
according to the mobility index received from the mobility estimator 711 and if the<br>
selected power control scheme is different from the previous one, the power controller<br>
709 transmits the power control change request to the MAC entity 701. Thus the MAC<br>
entity 701 generates a power control change request message and transmits it to the<br>
BS. In this way, the SS only needs to request the change of a power control scheme<br>
and the BS makes a final decision about the power control scheme.<br>
[86]	FIG. 8 is a diagram illustrating power control state transition of the SS depending<br>
on which power control scheme is selected in the TDD communication system<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[87]	Referring to FIG. 8, PMC is used in deciding a power control scheme. If PMC is<br>
'0', it indicates selection of the closed-loop power control. If the PMC is '1', it indicates<br>
selection of the open-loop power control.<br>
[88]	In the state where PMC=0, if the power control change command received from the<br>
BS indicates the closed-loop power control, the state PMC=0 (closed-loop power<br>
control) is kept, as indicated by reference numeral 805. If the power control change<br>
command indicates the open-loop power control, the state PMC=0 is transitioned to the<br>
state PMC=1 (open-loop power control), as indicated by reference numeral 811.<br>
Similarly, in the state where PMC=1, if the power control change command indicates<br>
the open-loop power control, the state PMC=1 (open-loop power control) is kept, as<br>
indicated by reference numeral 809. If the power control change command indicates<br>
the closed-loop power control, the state PMC=1 is transitioned to the state PMC=0<br>
(closed-loop power control), as indicated by reference numeral 807. In this way, the SS<br>
determines the power control scheme according to the power control change command<br>
from the BS.<br>
[89]	With reference to the state transition diagram of FIG. 8, the operation of the SS<br>
will be described below.<br>
[90]	FIG. 9 is a flowchart illustrating an operation for determining an uplink power<br>
control scheme in the SS in the TDD communication system according to an<br><br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[91]	Referring to FIG. 9, the SS determines if a power control change command<br>
message has been received from the BS in step 901. Upon receipt of the power control<br>
change command message, the SS checks in step 903 a power control change<br>
command set in the message. In step 905, the SS determines if the power control<br>
change command indicates the closed-loop power control. If it does, the SS sets PMC<br>
to 0 (closed-loop power control) in step 907 and returns to step 901. If the power<br>
control change command indicates the open-loop power control, the SS sets the PMC<br>
to 1 (open-loop power control) in step 909 and returns to step 901.<br>
[92]	FIG. 10 is a flowchart illustrating an operation for requesting a power control<br>
change to the BS in the SS in the TDD communication system according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[93]	Referring to FIG. 10, the SS compares a mobility index calculated by the mobility<br>
estimator 711 with a predetermined threshold in step 1001 and determines if the<br>
mobility index is less than the threshold in step 1003. If the mobility index is less than<br>
the threshold, the SS sets PMC to 0 (closed-loop power control) in step 1005. Since the<br>
mobility index being less than the threshold means that the SS moves slowly, the<br>
power control scheme is set to the closed-loop power control. On the contrary, if the<br>
mobility index is greater than the threshold, the SS sets PMC to 1 (open-loop power<br>
control) in step 1007. Since the mobility index being greater than the threshold means<br>
that the SS moves fast, the power control scheme is set to the open-loop power control.<br>
[94]	In step 1009, the SS determines if PMC has been toggled by comparing the power<br>
control scheme set currently (PMC) with the previous power control scheme (PMC). If<br>
PMC has not been changed, the SS returns to step 1001. If PMC has been changed, the<br>
SS transmits to the BS a power control change request message including information<br>
about the changed power control scheme in step 1011 and returns to step 1001. The<br>
detailed structure of the power control change request message is illustrated below in<br>
Table 2.<br>
[95]	FIG. 11 is a diagram illustrating a flow of messages exchanged between the BS and<br>
the SS in the TDD communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Particularly, the messages are used in the process of requesting changing by<br>
the SS a power control scheme to the BS and detennining a power control scheme<br>
upon receipt of the power control change request by the BS.<br>
[96]	Referring to FIG. 11, when it is necessary to change a power control scheme, the<br>
SS transmits to the BS in step 1101 a power control change request message including<br>
information about a requested power control scheme. The format of the power control<br>
change request message is illustrated below in Table 2.<br>
[97]	Upon receipt of the power control change request message, the BS determines a<br><br>
power control scheme based on the mobility index of the SS in step 1103. If the<br>
determined power control scheme is different from the previous one, the BS transmits<br>
to the SS in step 1105 a power control change command message including in-<br>
formation about the determined power control scheme. The format of the power<br>
control change command message is illustrated below in Table 3.<br>
[98]	Upon receipt of the power control change command message, the SS sets in step<br>
1107 a power control scheme according to a power control change command set in the<br>
received message.<br>
[99]	As described above, the SS requests the change of a power control scheme and the<br>
BS transmits a power control change command to the SS in response to the power<br>
control change request. In another case, the BS can transmit the power control change<br>
command according to the mobility index to the SS, without receiving the power<br>
control change request. The power control change request message is transmitted to the<br>
BS in a UL burst and the power control change command message is transmitted to the<br>
SS in a DL burst, as illustrated in FIG. 1. Configuration information about the UL burst<br>
and me DL burst are delivered to the SS in a UL-MAP burst and a DL-MAP burst.<br>
That is, the SS transmits the power control change request message and receives the<br>
power control change command message using the MAP information received from<br>
the BS.<br>
[100]	Table 2 below illustrates an example of the power control change request message<br>
depicted in FIG. 11, which can be transmitted from the SS in the IEEE 802.16 com-<br>
munication system. It is delivered to the BS in a UL burst.<br><br>
[101]	Referring to Table 2, 'Management Message Type' is a serial number that identifies<br>
the message in the IEEE 802.16 communication system. It can be changed according<br><br>
to a system standardization. 'Power control mode change' indicates a requested power<br>
control scheme. It is set to '0' for the closed-loop power control and to '1' for the open-<br>
loop power control. 'UL Tx power' indicates the transmit power value of the uplink<br>
burst that delivers the power control change request. Encoding of the transmit power<br>
value is performed in compliance with IEEE 802.16, which will not be described in<br>
detail herein. The BS can utilize the transmit power value for power control, set in the<br>
uplink burst with the power control change request. 'Reserved' represents bits inserted<br>
to match the total size of the message in bytes.<br>
[102]	Table 3 below illustrates an example of the power control change command<br>
message depicted in FIG. 11, which can be transmitted from the BS in the IEEE 802.16<br>
communication system. It is delivered to the base mobile in a DL burst.<br><br>
[103]	Referring to Table 3, 'Management Message Type" is a serial number that identifies<br><br>
the message in the IEEE 802.16 communication system. It can be changed according<br>
to a system standardization. 'Power control mode change' indicates a requested power<br>
control scheme. It is set to '0' for the closed-loop power control and to '1' for the open-<br>
loop power control. 'Start frame' indicates a frame in which the indicated power control<br>
scheme starts to be applied in the IEEE 802.16 communication system. If the indicated<br>
power control scheme is the closed-loop power control, a power control command<br>
'Power adjust' about the transmit power of the SS is transmitted. In the case of the<br>
open-loop power control, an offset value 'OffsetperSS  ' is transmitted to be reflected in<br>
MARGINRX of Equation (2). This offset value is specific to the SS, like the change of<br>
link performance caused by channel selectivity and the diversity gain of BS antennas.<br>
In this case, MARGINRX reflects the channel status of the SS as well as the time delay<br>
	J<br>
until the power control scheme is applied.<br>
[ 104]	Table 4 below illustrates an example of a bandwidth request and uplink transmit<br>
power report message that can be transmitted by the SS in the IEEE 802.16 com-<br>
munication system.<br><br>
[105]	Referring to Table 4, the bandwidth request and uplink transmit power report<br>
message is a modification to an existing IEEE 802.16 bandwidth request message. In<br>
general, uplink communications starts with a bandwidth request from the SS in the<br>
IEEE 802.16 communication system. Thus, the bandwidth request message was<br>
defined in the IEEE 802.16 communication system. Assuming that the uplink commu-<br>
nications start with the bandwidth request from the SS, an uplink message transmitted<br>
from the SS when the procedure illustrated in FIG. 2 or FIG. 3 can be the bandwidth<br>
request message. Yet, this message cannot be used as a reference signal for power<br>
control in the procedure because it does not have information about uplink transmit<br>
power. Accordingly, the SS transmits a bandwidth request and an uplink transmit<br>
power value together in the present invention. In this context, the bandwidth request<br>
and uplink transmit power report message illustrated in Table 4 is designed to serve as<br>
the reference signal for power control. Particularly, this message is in a control<br>
message format called a header according to IEEE 802.16.<br>
[ 106]	In Table 4, 'HT (Header Type)' indicates a header type. It is set to ' 1' all the time.<br><br>
'EC (Encryption Control)' indicates if the payload following the header is encrypted or<br>
not. 'EC is always set to '1'. The bandwidth request and uplink transmit power report<br>
message is configured to have a header only, without payload. 'Type' indicates the type<br>
of the bandwidth request header. It can be changed according to standardization. 'BR'<br>
is short for Bandwidth Request It indicates the amount of uplink data in bytes. 'UL Tx<br>
Power' indicates the transmit power value of a UL burst that carries the bandwidth<br>
request and uplink transmit power report message. Encoding of the transmit power<br>
value performed in compliance with IEEE 802.16, and its description will not be<br>
provided herein. The BS can utilize the transmit power for power control transmit, set<br>
in the uplink burst with the bandwidth request and uplink transmit power report<br>
message. 'CID (Connection ID)' is a 16-bit IEEE 802.16 connection ID. 'HCS (Header<br>
Check Sequence)' is a 8-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) value for the message, to<br>
be used for error detection in the BS. The CRC operation is based on IEEE 802.16 and<br>
its description will not be provided herein.<br>
[107]	In accordance with the present invention as described above, an uplink power<br>
control scheme is changed in a TDD communication system. Therefore, the uplink<br>
power control can be carried out more efficiently. That is, an efficient uplink power<br>
control is provided by fully utilizing the advantages of the closed-loop and open-loop<br>
power control schemes.<br>
[ 108]	While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain<br>
preferred embodiments thereof, they are merely exemplary applications. For example,<br>
while the closed-loop power control and the open-loop power control have been<br>
described as available power control schemes, the present invention is applicable to<br>
further-divided power control schemes. Therefore, it will be understood by those<br>
skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br><br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
TITLE: " A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ADAPTIVELY CHANGING UPLINK<br>
POWER CONTROL SCHEME ACCORDING TO MOBILE STATUS IN A TDD MOBILE<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM".<br>
An apparatus and method for changing an uplink power control scheme<br>
according to mobile status in a TDD mobile communication system are<br>
provided. A subscriber station transmits to a base station a power control<br>
change request message including information about a requested power control<br>
scheme. Upon receipt of the power control change request message, the base<br>
station selects a power control scheme for the uplink of the subscriber station<br>
and transmits to the subscriber station a power control change command<br>
message including information about the selected power control scheme. The<br>
subscriber station extracts, upon receipt of the power control change command<br>
message from the base station, the power control scheme information from the<br>
power control change command message and selects a power control scheme<br>
according to the extracted information.</td>
