WASHING MACHINE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a washing machine cleansing clothes. It relates more particularly to a washing machine that spins a washing basket containing clothes, thereby generating centrifugal force which produces water stream, and the water stream runs through the clothes, so that soil of the clothes is removed.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A conventional washing machine, in general, employs an agitating method. That is, a user puts the clothes into a washing basket doubling as a spin-dryer (hereinafter referred to as a "basket") in the first place, then supplies water into the basket up to a given level. After that, the user agitates the agitator (pulsator) disposed in the basket to cleanse and rinse the clothes.<br>
The agitating is performed by repeating the steps of clockwise spinning, halt, and counterclockwise spinning of the pulsator, and halt. Respective periods of clockwise spin and counterclockwise spin are determined at a given duration so that the clothes are sufficiently agitated. The halt period is also determined at a necessary time for starting the reverse spin after the agitating has been halted.<br>
In this conventional structure, the pulsator agitates the clothes, and the pulsator touches the clothes directly or via water, thereby revolving the clothes to be cleansed. This structure produces powerful cleansing effect; however, the clothes directly touches the pulsator, so that the clothes get to be<br><br>
2<br>
vulnerable to damages.<br>
Further, the clothes frequently moves and revolves up and down, left and right, whereby the clothes get entangled complicatedly with each other. When the clothes get entangled, the centrifugal force due to spinning the basket in the next step, i.e. dehydrating, is impressed to the clothes, whereby the entangled clothes are forcibly stretched and pressed onto an inside wall of the basket. As a result, the clothes lose their shapes, and are hard to take out from the basket after the dehydrating step.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention addresses the problems discussed above and aims to provide a washing machine where movements of the water only work to articles to be cleansed so that the articles are kept free from damages and entanglement.<br>
The washing machine of the present invention comprises the following elements:<br>
(a)	a water tub;<br>
(b)	a washing basket doubling as a spin-drier rotatably disposed in<br>
the water tub;<br>
(c)	a driving machine for driving the basket; and<br>
(d)	a control device for controlling the driving machine.<br>
The control device is so structured that it spins the basket, and varies centrifugal force applied to the water in the basket in order to cleanse the articles.<br>
The structure discussed above allows the water stream including detergent to run through the fibers of the clothes thereby removing soil from the articles.   As such, because the articles receive only the force due to water<br><br>
3<br>
movement by the centrifugal force, the articles can be cleansed free from damages and being entangled.<br>

Detailed Description of the Exemplary Embodiments Exemplary   embodiments   of the   present   invention   are   described hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
(Exemplary Embodiment 1)<br>
Fig. 1 is a cross section of a washing machine in accordance with the first exemplary embodiment of the present invention, and Fig. 2 is a block circuit diagram of the washing machine shown in Fig. 1.<br>
In Fig. 1, water tub 1 has washing basket doubling as a spin-drier 2 therein. (Hereinafter the washing basket doubling as a spin-drier 2 is referred to as "basket 2".) Water tub 1 is suspended by suspension rod 3 from outer frame 4 so that vibration due to spinning the basket and rotating of the driving machine, e.g. motor 5, is restrained.<br>
Motor 5 spins basket 2, and the rotating speed of motor 5 is controlled by control device 6.<br>
Water valve 8 supplies tap water to water tub 1. Drain valve 7 drains cleansing water in the washing machine outside the machine. Lid 9 covers a top section of basket 2, and articles, e.g. clothes 10 is loaded into basket 2. Spinning basket 2 generates centrifugal force, which works on the cleansing water in the basket, so that the cleansing water rises toward the inner wall of basket 2. As a result, the surface 11 of cleansing water draws conical shape, in. other words, a parabolic line from a cross sectional view in a broken line as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
In Fig. 2, control device 6 is structured as follows: Controller 12 comprising a microcomputer controls respective steps of cleansing, rinsing and dehydrating based on a mode set by an instruction through operation panel 13.    To be more specific, controller 12 controls motor 5 via motor driver<br><br>
6<br>
shown in Fig. 4A. Then as shown in Fig. 3A, increase the spin speed up to n2 along the time scale from t0 to tl, and keep the spin speed at n2 until the time=t2.<br>
When basket 2 spins at n2 spin-speed, centrifugal force works on the clothes and cleansing water therein, and the water surface draws a conical shape in a broken line as shown in Fig. 4B. If soil attached to the clothes has a greater specific gravity than the cleansing water, the soil is drawn toward outside of the spin. Another soil having a lower specific gravity than the cleansing water is drawn inside of the spin.<br>
When controller 12 stops powering motor 5 at time=t2, the spin speed of basket 2 sharply decreases to 0 (zero) at time=t3, where centrifugal force does not work to the clothes nor to cleansing water, i.e. the status returns as shown in Fig. 4A. Re-start powering motor 5 at time=t4, and repeat the procedure discussed above so that basket 2 is spun intermittently. The soil attached to the clothes is thus repeatedly pulled and released.<br>
This intermittent spins and cleansing power of the detergent make the soil being readily removed from the clothes. The centrifugal force removes the soil from the clothes, and draws some of the soil having a greater specific gravity than the cleansing water to outside, while the other of a smaller specific gravity to inside.    The clothes are thus cleansed.<br>
The variation of spin speed as shown in Fig. 3A varies centrifugal force. The surface of the water in basket 2 varies from a level to a conical shape and vice versa as shown in Fig. 4A and Fig. 4B. This change moves the clothes from center to circumference and vice versa, which produces press-washing effect.    This effect contributes to removing soil from the clothes.<br>
Those effects discussed above produce synergy effect, thereby removing the  soil from the clothes efficiently.     The clothes receive only the  force<br><br>
5<br>
14. Controller 12 also controls water valve 8 and drain valve 7 via power switch 15. Storage device 16 stores necessary data for controlling by-controller 12.<br>
Rotor-positioning-detector 17 receives a signal from motor 5, and detects a position and rotating speed of a rotor, then outputs the detection results to controller 12 and to clothes-load-determiner 18. Based on the data from rotor-positioning-detector 17, clothes-load-determiner 18 determines an amount of clothes, and outputs the result to controller 12. Water level detector 19 detects an amount of water in water tub 1, and outputs the result to controller 12.<br>
Power supply circuit 20, e.g. rectifies and smoothes the commercial power 21 of ac 100V into a dc voltage, and then powers motor driver 14. Power supply circuit 20 also, e.g. lowers that dc voltage to dc 5V to operate controller 12. Power switch 22 is coupled to commercial power 21, and turns on and off the power.<br>
Controller 12 controls the spin of basket 2 by controlling motor 5, thereby varying the centrifugal force working on the cleansing water in basket 2 to cleanse the clothes. Controller 12 varies the centrifugal force by spinning basket 2 intermittently or varying the spin speed periodically.<br>
A cleansing operation of the structure discussed above is described hereinafter. Fig. 3A shows a variation of spin speed with regard to the time laps when basket 2 is spun intermittently. Fig. 3B shows a variation of spin speed with regard to the time laps when basket 2 is spun by varying the spin speed periodically.<br>
First, the intermittent spin of basket 2 is described with reference to Figs. 3A, 4A and 4B. When basket 2 is halted, clothes 10 is distributed in basket 2 almost uniformly, and surface of the cleansing water stays level as<br><br>
7<br>
produced by moving water, and thus remain free from damages as well as being entangled.<br>
Varying the spin speed of basket 2 periodically is another method to cleanse clothes, which is described hereinafter.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3B, increase the spin speed of basket 2 along the time scale from tO to t5. When the spin speed reaches n2, hold this speed until time=t6. Then, stop powering motor 5 at time=t6, which lowers the spin speed sharply to nl at time=t7, where a next driving is started.<br>
In this case, controller 12 controls to power motor 5 as follows: Power motor 5 so that the rotating speed is accelerated from time=t0 to t5, and stays at a constant speed from time=t5 to t6. Then stop powering the motor at time=t6, which lowers the rotating speed sharply to nl at t7, where the motor is re-powered. Repeat this process so that the spin speed of basket 2 rises and falls between nl and n2.<br>
This method also produces the same effect discussed previously and shown in Fig. 3A. Because the variation of centrifugal force becomes smaller than the previous case, the cleansing power per variation cycle decreases. However, frequencies of variation of spin speed are greater than the previous case. This method can thus often gain stronger cleansing power per period than the previous method. Either one of methods shown in Fig. 3A and Fig. 3B can be selected according to a requirement.<br>
An operation of the washing machine is described with reference to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.<br>
First, load clothes 10 into basket 2, then press a start-switch (not shown) disposed on operation panel 13, which drives motor 5 for a given time via motor driver 14 based on an instruction of controller 12. The operation data of motor 5 during this given time is detected by rotor-positioning-<br><br>
8<br>
detector 17, and transmitted to clothes-load-determiner 18. Determiner 18 determines load data of clothes and inputs it to controller 12. One of the load determination method is, e.g. transition of rotating speed of motor 5 during the given time is known by the signals from detector 17, then the load of clothes can be determined.<br>
Controller 12 instructs power switch 15 to open water valve 8, which starts supplying water to water tub 1. Water-level-detector 19 monitors a water level of tub 1, and inputs the report to controller 12. When controller 12 determines that the water reaches a level appropriate to the clothes load, controller 12 instructs switch 15 to close water valve 8, and stops supplying water. Controller 12 then drives motor 5 via motor driver 14, and moves the process to the cleansing step.<br>
In the cleansing step, controller 12 controls motor 5 to rotate intermittently as shown in Fig. 3A. The maximum spin speed n2 of basket 2 is set based on water in volume, and the max. spin speed n2 is increased at less water volume. In other words, when tub 1 contains water in the less volume, the smaller load is applied to motor 5, thereby increasing the spin speed. When the spin speed is increased, the cleansing water won't splash out from top of basket, which allows the spin speed to increase. The centrifugal force increases at the higher spin speed, so that cleansing power becomes stronger. As a result, a cleansing time can be shortened when water is at a low level.<br>
After the cleansing step is practiced for a given time, drain valve 7 is opened for draining the cleansing water. Then, rinsing and dehydrating steps are practiced before the washing is completed.<br>
As such, according to the first exemplary embodiment, the centrifugal force due to spinning basket 2 forces the cleansing water to run through the<br><br>
9<br>
fibers of clothes, and produces press-washing effect, whereby soil can be removed from the clothes. The clothes are thus cleansed free from damages, losing their shapes and being entangled.<br>
Clothes-load-detector 18 gives data of clothes load to controller 12 so that controller 12 can vary water level based on the data. As a result, the clothes can be cleansed with an appropriate volume of water, which saves water and detergent.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment, basket 2 having dehydrating holes is described as an example; however, the basket doubling as a spin-drier with no holes can also produce the same effect.<br>
(Exemplary Embodiment 2)<br>
Fig. 5 is an operational timing chart of a washing machine in accordance with the second exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The different points in the second exemplary embodiment from the first embodiment is the way of driving basket 2 doubling as the spin-drier. Other structures remain same as the first embodiment.<br>
Controller 12 shown in Fig. 2 varies at least respective periods of driving and halt in an intermittent driving manner of basket 2, or varies cycles of varying a spin speed of basket 2, based on a water level, clothes load, and a kind of clothes.<br>
In this embodiment, a method of cleansing is changed responsive to a kind of clothes. For instance, a woolen sweater has totally different delicacy of fiber and constitution of soil from those of a cotton underwear. When mechanical force is impressed to the woolen sweater, fibers are entangled with each other, and crinkled, while the cotton is not so delicate as the woolen sweater.    The cotton underwear is soiled with fatty skin, but the woolen<br><br>
10<br>
sweater is lightly soiled. Accordingly, the woolen sweater does not demand so much cleansing power, however, it is desirably washed free from moving. On the other hand, the cotton underwear may be moved during the washing and it demands cleansing power.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates the specific cleansing ways for these two types of clothes. Fig. 5 shows how to control the spin speed of basket 2. Solid lines 50 show the spin-speed-control for cleansing the woolen sweater, and broken lines 60 show that for the cotton underwear. In the case of the woolen sweater, a start-up spin speed varies in a narrow range, and a frequency of repeats is controlled to be a small number so that the sweater does not move so much. In the case of the cotton underwear, the start-up speed varies in a wide range, and the frequency of repeats is increased so that the underwear moves well. As such, a way of varying the spin speed of basket 2 produces an appropriate cleansing method to the respective clothes.<br>
Regarding the water level, when the water stays at a lower level, an inertia moment of basket 2 containing the clothes and water becomes smaller. The spin speed can be thus controlled little by little. The cycle of spin speed variation can be shortened in order to increase the cleansing power so that the cleansing period can be shortened. The cycle of spin speed variation can be thus changed, whereby an appropriate cleansing method is produced as well as the cleansing period can be shortened.<br>
(Exemplary Embodiment 3)<br>
Fig. 6 is an operational timing chart of a washing machine in accordance with the third exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In this third embodiment, a different point from the first embodiment is a way of spinning basket 2.    Other structures remain same as the first<br><br>
11<br>
embodiment.<br>
Controller 12 shown in Fig. 2 can alternate a spin direction of basket 2. An operation of the third exemplary embodiment is described hereinafter. The spin speed of basket 2 is controlled as shown in Fig. 6. Y-axis of Fig. 6 represents spin speeds, and a speed of clockwise spin increases upwardly from the center, i.e. "0" (zero), while a speed of counterclockwise spin increases downwardly from the center "0" (zero).<br>
First, spin basket 2 clockwise and increase the spin speed, then stop the spin. Although the spin is halted, inertia moment of basket 2 per se keeps basket 2 spinning with decreasing the speed. When the spin speed reaches almost "0" (zero), drive basket 2 counterclockwise. Then increase the spin speed and halt the spin. The inertia moment of basket 2 keeps basket 2 spinning with decreasing the speed. When the spin speed reaches almost "0" (zero), drive basket 2 clockwise.    One cycle is thus completed.<br>
Repeating this cycle moves the clothes in basket 2 in a more dynamic manner than the one-way spinning method described in the first and second embodiments, which further increases the cleansing power. When basket 2 is halted and the spin speed decreases, apply brake before the spin speed reaches "0" (zero), and spin basket 2 in the reverse direction. Then the cleansing power can be still further increased.<br>
In this case, even if the clothes moves in a more dynamic manner, the relative locations of clothes with each other are not changed, therefore, the clothes are still free from damages that the conventional agitating method incurs.<br>
In this third exemplary embodiment, controller 12 alternates the spin direction of basket 2 every one spin; however, controller 12 can alternate the spin direction after a plurality of spins in the same direction, which also<br><br>
12<br>
produces the same effect.<br>
(Exemplary Embodiment 4)<br>
Fig. 7 is a cross section of a washing machine in accordance with the fourth exemplary embodiment of the present invention, and Fig. 8 is a block circuit diagram of the washing machine shown in Fig. 7.<br>
In Fig. 7, water-guard 23 is disposed on water tub 1. Due to spinning basket 2, cleansing water rises into an annular space between basket 2 and water tub 1. The rising water forms waterfall 24 toward inside the basket 2, and sprays over clothes 25 and 26. At this moment, the surface 27 of cleansing water in basket 2 draws a conical shape as shown in a broken line. In a lower section of the washing machine, a control device 28 controlling motor 5 is disposed.<br>
Control device 28 shown in Fig. 8 has the following structure:<br>
Controller 29 sequentially controls respective steps of cleansing, rinsing and dehydrating based on a set mode supplied from operation panel 30. In other words, controller 29 controls motor 5 via motor driver 31. Controller 29 also controls water valve 8 and drain valve 7 via power switch 32. Storage device 33 stores data necessary for controller 29.<br>
Rotor-positioning-detector 34 receives signals from motor 5, and detects a rotor position and its rotating speed. Detector 34 outputs the results to controller 29 and clothes-load-determiner 35. Clothes-load-determiner 35 determines the load of clothes based on the data from detector 34, and outputs the result to controller 29. Water-level-detector 36 detects a water level in water tub 1, and outputs the result to controller 29.<br>
Power-supply-circuit 37 rectifies and smoothes the commercial power 21 of ac 100V into a dc voltage, and then powers motor driver 31.    Power-<br><br>
13<br>
supply-circuit 37 lowers that dc voltage and supplies the lowered voltage to controller 29 and the like.<br>
Controller 29 controls a first step and a second step. The first step is to spin basket 2 and vary centrifugal force applied to the cleansing water in basket 2, thereby cleansing the clothes. The second step is to spin basket 2 and spray the cleansing water rising from between water-guard 23 and basket 2 into basket 2, thereby cleansing the clothes. The first and second steps are combined so that the clothes can be cleansed. Other structures remain same as the first exemplary embodiment.<br>
An operation of the fourth exemplary embodiment is described hereinafter.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates a case where a bulk of clothes are cleansed. When the clothes are cleansed, the surface of cleansing water draws a conical shape as shown in a broken line in Fig. 7. Clothes 26 are immersed in the cleansing water, while clothes 25 are dipped but appear therefrom. Centrifugal force works on clothes 26 through the cleansing water, thereby cleansing the clothes 26 as same as the first exemplary embodiment. However, clothes 25 cannot be cleansed at this location.<br>
The second step discussed above is then introduced, i.e. the spin of basket 2 allows the cleansing water to form a waterfall 24 and spray over clothes 25 from the location of water guard 23. Since basket 2 spins, centrifugal force allows the cleansing water to run through clothes 25, thereby cleansing them.<br>
When a small amount of clothes are loaded, the first step can cleanse the clothes, same as the first exemplary embodiment.<br>
How to use the first and second steps properly is discussed hereinafter with the operation of the washing machine.<br><br>
14<br>
Put the clothes into basket 2, then press a start-switch (not shown) disposed on operation panel 30, which drives motor 5 for a given time via motor driver 31 based on an instruction of controller 29. The operation data of motor 5 during this given time is detected by rotor positioning detection 34, and transmitted to clothes-load-determiner 35. Determiner 35 determines load data of clothes and inputs it to controller 29.<br>
Controller 29 compares an input signal from determiner 35 with the data stored in storage device 33 to determine which step, i.e. the first or the second step, is desirably taken, then determines a water level and a spin speed. Controller 29 instructs power switch 32 to open water valve 8, which supplies water up to the determined level, then controller 29 instructs motor driver 31 to drive motor 5 intermittently at the determined spin speed.<br>
As such, the first and second steps can be combined so that various amount of clothes can be cleansed with appropriate amount of water to the respective amounts of clothes. The clothes are, of course, cleansed free from damages.<br>
(Exemplary Embodiment 5)<br>
Fig. 9 is a cross section of a washing machine in accordance with the fifth exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In Fig. 9, washing basket 37 doubling as a spin-drier has pulsater 38 disposed rotatably on a bottom section thereof. Motor 5 drives pulsator 38 or basket 37 via speed reduction mechanism 39 doubling as a clutch. Control device 40 controls a rotating speed of motor 5.<br>
Control device 40 is structured as shown in Fig. 8 as same as the fourth exemplary embodiment. This fifth exemplary embodiment comprises the following three steps:<br><br>
15<br>
Step 1.    Spinning basket 37, and varying the centrifugal force working on the cleansing water in basket 37, thereby cleansing the clothes;<br>
Step2.    Spinning basket 37, and spraying the cleansing water into basket 37, thereby cleansing the clothes;<br>
Step 3.    Spinning pulsater 38, thereby cleansing the clothes. Other structures are the same as the fourth exemplary embodiment.<br>
An operation of the fifth exemplary embodiment is described hereinafter.<br>
Responsive to an amount of clothes, one of the above three steps is selected, or two or three steps are combined to cleanse the amount of clothes. For instance, Step 1 and Step 2 are combined when delicate clothes are cleansed, which is same as the fourth exemplary embodiment.<br>
When extremely soiled clothes are cleansed, Step 1 and Step 2 are combined, and further Step 3, i.e. agitating the clothes by pulsator, is added in order to sufficiently remove soil. In this case, only Step 3 may work, but combination of Step 1 and Step 2 can increase cleansing power and decrease damages.<br>
As such, the fifth exemplary embodiment proves that the washing machine of the present invention can accommodate a wide range of clothes, such as from a small amount to a bulk of clothes and from delicate clothes to extremely soiled clothes.<br>
As discussed above, the washing machine of the present invention comprises a water tub, a washing basket doubling as a spin-drier disposed rotatably in the water tub, a driving machine for driving the basket, and a control device for controlling the driving machine.
