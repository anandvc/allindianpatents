				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
A COMPOSITION HAVING<br>
IMMUNOREGULATING ACTIVITIES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a composition comprising<br>
Lactobacillus pentosus having immunoregulating activities.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Lactic acid bacteria are known to exhibit various<br>
beneficial bioactivities such as an intestine regulating activity<br>
and immunostimulating activity. Many of the Lactic acid<br>
bacteria with such beneficial bioactivities are separated from<br>
the intestinal tract or fermented dairy products obtained from<br>
animal sources. Some lactic acid bacteria from plant sources<br>
are also known to exhibit immunostimulating activities.<br>
An example of lactic acid bacteria having<br>
immunostimulating activities is found, for example, in Patent<br>
Document 1, which discloses the Lactobacillus plantarum L-137<br>
strain. Other examples include the Lactobacillus brevis Labre<br>
strain separated from "Suguki," which is a particular kind of<br>
traditional pickles produced in Kyoto, and the Lactobacillus<br>
pentosus DA74N strain separated from "Shibazuke," another<br>
kind of Kyoto pickles (see Non-Patent Documents 1, 2).<br>

A wide variety of bacteria can be separated from the<br>
traditional Kyoto pickles, and it is believed that the pickles<br>
include other bacterial strains, in addition to the Labre strain,<br>
with the immunostimulating activities or other beneficial<br>
bioactivities. Among different bacterial strains separated from<br>
the pickles, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus pentosus<br>
are most frequently separated. However, the effects of bacteria<br>
separated from the pickles have not been actively researched.<br>
In addition, since lactic acid bacteria separated from the<br>
pickles are originally contained in food, they are considered to<br>
be highly safe even if ingested by living organisms. Therefore,<br>
with the beneficial lactic acid bacteria separated from the<br>
pickles, a useful composition comprising such lactic acid<br>
bacteria can be realized.<br>
The present invention was made in view of the foregoing<br>
problem, and an object of the invention is to provide food,<br>
drinks, medicaments, or the like that are safe and containing<br>
lactic acid bacteria, separated from traditional Kyoto pickles,<br>
having beneficial bioactivities.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The inventors of the present invention diligently worked<br>
to solve the foregoing problems. In accomplishing the invention,<br>
the inventors investigated immunoregulating activities of 16<br>
kinds of lactic acid bacteria separated from pickles, and<br>
conducted a detailed study of immunoregulating activities of<br>
Lactobacillus pentosus bacteria among the separated bacteria.<br>
It was found as a result that immunoregulating activities such<br>
as immunostimulating activity and anti-allergy activity were<br>
exhibited when the Lactobacillus pentosus bacteria was<br>
ingested by animals with drinking water or when a suspension<br>
of the Lactobacillus pentosus bacteria was administered to<br>
animals.<br>
Specifically, a composition according to the present<br>
invention comprises lactic acid bacteria which belong to<br>
Lactobacillus pentosus and which have a weak assimilating<br>
activity or no assimilating activity for glycerol. Preferably, the<br>
lactic acid bacteria have immunoregulating activities and are<br>
an extracellular polysaccharide-producing strain.<br>
An example of preferable lactic acid bacteria is a<br>
Lactobacillus pentosus S-PT84 strain (PERM ABP-10028). The<br>
Lactobacillus pentosus S-PT84 strain was separated from<br>
"Shibazuke" by the inventors, and was found to possess strong<br>
immunoregulating activities. The Lactobacillus pentosus S-PT84<br>
strain is also called a DS84C strain. The Lactobacillus pentosus<br>
S-PT84 strain (Lactobacillus pentosus SAM 2336) is deposited<br>
with the deposit number PERM ABP-10028 at the International<br>
Patent Organism Depositary in the National Institute of<br>
Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST). Therefore,<br>
a composition according to the present invention preferably<br>
comprises the Lactobacillus pentosus S-PT84 strain.<br>
A composition according to the present invention<br>
comprises the lactic acid bacteria and has immunoregulating<br>
activities. Further, a composition according to the present<br>
invention comprises the lactic acid bacteria and has<br>
anti-allergy activities. In addition, a composition according to<br>
the present invention may comprise lactic acid bacteria as<br>
viable cells. The composition is useful for food, drinks, and<br>
medicaments having immunoregulating activities and/or<br>
anti-allergy activities.<br>
For a fuller understanding of the nature and advantages<br>
of the invention, reference should be made to the ensuing<br>
detailed description taken in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The following will describe one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. It is to be noted that the invention is not limited in<br>
any way by the following description.<br>
Lactic acid bacteria contained in a composition according<br>
to the present invention belong to Lactobacillus pentosus and<br>
have a weak assimilating activity or no assimilating activity for<br>
glycerol. A composition comprising such lactic acid bacteria is<br>
highly valuable as a composition capable of exhibiting<br>
beneficial bioactivities of the lactic acid bacteria. Among such<br>
compositions, a composition having immunoregulating<br>
activities is preferable. As used herein, the term<br>
"immunoregulating activity" refers to the function of activating<br>
a steady or dropped immune function (immunostimulating<br>
activity), or the function of suppressing an excess immune<br>
function to an appropriate level (immunosuppressing activity).<br>
In addition to or instead of these activities, the term is also<br>
used to refer to the function of achieving an optimum balance<br>
between cellular immunity and humoral immunity.<br>
Non-limiting examples of immunoregulating activities include:<br>
facilitation or suppression of cytokine production; activation of<br>
lymphocytes; enhancement of NK (natural killer) activity;<br>
improvement of Thl/Th2 balance; suppression of immune<br>
reduction; and anti-allergy activity.<br>
Further, it is preferable that lactic acid bacteria<br>
contained in a composition according to the present invention<br>
be an extracellular polysaccharide-producing strain (EPS). The<br>
property or chemical structure of EPS varies greatly from<br>
genus to genus, species to species, and strain to strain. The<br>
EPS produces capsular polysaccharides, which accumulate on<br>
the bacteria surface and is easily recognizable by Indian ink<br>
staining. The ESP-producing strain is more hydrophilic than<br>
strains that produce no ESP. This is advantageous in food<br>
applications.<br>
A representative example of lactic acid bacteria contained<br>
in a composition according to the present invention is the<br>
Lactobacillus pentosus S-PT84 strain. This bacterial strain is<br>
deposited with the deposit number PERM ABP-10028 at the<br>
International Patent Organism Depositary in the National<br>
Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST).<br>
The Lactobacillus pentosus S-PT84 strain (hereinafter simply<br>
referred to as "S-PT84") will be described below.<br>
Based on the criteria noted below, the inventors of the<br>
present invention separated and selected 16 kinds of lactic<br>
acid bacteria from "Shibazuke" (4 kinds of Lactobacillus<br>
plantarum, and 12 kinds of Lactobacillus pentosus). Specifically,<br>
16 kinds of lactic acid bacteria were selected from the plant<br>
lactic acid bacteria if ( 1 ) they were bacilli (genus Lactobacillus),<br>
(2) more than one strain with the same characteristics was<br>
separated, (3) they proliferated desirably in a culture medium,<br>
and (4) they were distinct to "Shibazuke."<br>
The 16 kinds of lactic acid bacteria were compared with<br>
respect to inducible activity of interleukin 12 (simply "IL-12"<br>
hereinafter). The result showed that the Lactobacillus pentosus<br>
S-PT84 strain yielded the highest concentration of serum IL-12<br>
when intraperitoneally administered to mice.<br>
Detailed studies of S-PT84 immunoregulating activities<br>
led to the following findings.<br>
(1) When processed in vitro in the splenocytes prepared<br>
from mice, the S-PT84 induced the production of IFN-y<br>
(interferon y) ar*d TNF-a (tumor necrosis factor ex) of the<br>
Thl-type cytokine, and thereby increased the number of<br>
CD4 + CD69 + cells and CD8 + CD60 + cells. That is, the S-PT84<br>
functioned to activate the helper T cells or killer T cells.<br>
(2) When intraperitoneally administered to mice, the<br>
S-PT84 enhanced the NK activity of the hepatic lymphocytes. In<br>
addition, the S-PT84 increased the number of CD8 + cells and<br>
CD8 + CD69 + cells, and thereby enhanced the cellular immunity.<br>
(3) When orally administered to mice, the S-PT84 raised<br>
the concentration of serum IL-12, increased the number of<br>
CD4 + , CD8 + , and CD3+ cells in the spleen, and thereby<br>
enhanced the NK activity of the splenocytes. As a result, the<br>
Thl/Th2 balance in the splenocytes became Thl dominant.<br>
(4) When orally administered to mice, the S-PT84<br>
suppressed a weight loss caused by administration of<br>
cydophosphamide, and suppressed immune response reduction.<br>
(5) When orally administered to mice, the S-PT84<br>
suppressed increase of ovalbumin (OVA)-specific IgE and total<br>
IgE, even when sensitized with OVA.<br>
(6) When orally administered to mice, the S-PT84<br>
suppressed stress-induced reduction of NK activity.<br>
From these findings, the S-PT84 was confirmed to be a<br>
strain with imrnunoregulating activities.<br>

Lactobacillus pentosus is generally known to have a strong<br>
assimilating activity f or glycerol. However, the S-PT84 had a<br>
weak assimilating activity for glycerol, as shown in Table 1.<br>
Thus, the S-PT84 was found to be different from any other<br>
known Lactobacillus pentosus.<br>
After extracting DNA from S-PT84, a total of about 500 bp<br>
in the entire region of the IGSrRNA gene was sequenced using<br>
the Microseq Full Gene 16S rDNA kit (Applied Biosystems). The<br>
16SrRNA gene sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) was 100% homologous<br>
to the 16SrRNA gene sequence of Lactobacillus pentosus JCMT<br>
(D79211). From this, the S-PT84 was identified as Lactobacillus<br>
pentosus.<br>
The S-PT84 is more hydrophilic than bacteria that<br>
produce no EPS, and has essentially no adherence to a plastic<br>
surface. Further, the S-PT84 has essentially no agglomeration<br>
activity for yeasts.<br>
A composition according to the present invention<br>
comprises lactic acid bacteria which belong to Lactobacillus<br>
pentosus and which have a weak assimilating activity or no<br>
assimilating activity for glycerol. A composition according to<br>
the present invention preferably has immunoregulating<br>
activities or anti-allergy activities. It would be more<br>
advantageous if the composition exhibits both<br>
immunoregulating activities and anti-allergy activities.<br>
A composition according to the present invention is<br>
advantageously usable in the form of food, drinks, or<br>
medicaments having immunoregulating activities and/or<br>
anti-allergy activities. In other words, the composition can be<br>
suitably used as a pharmaceutical composition having<br>
immunoregulating activities and/or anti-allergy activities.<br>
The lactic acid bacteria may be contained in a<br>
composition either directly (viable or dead), or in the form of<br>
an inclusion or processed cells, for example. Viable cells may<br>
be obtained from an inclusion of lactic acid bacteria such as a<br>
broth of lactic acid bacteria. Dead cells may be obtained by<br>
subjecting viable cells to heat, UV irradiation, or a formalin<br>
treatment, for example. The viable cells or dead cells may be<br>
ground or crushed into processed cells.<br>
That is, a composition according to the present invention<br>
includes at least one of: lactic acid bacteria; an inclusion of<br>
lactic acid bacteria; and processed cells of lactic acid bacteria.<br>
Examples of lactic acid bacteria include viable cells, wet cells,<br>
and dried cells. The lactic acid bacteria inclusion may be a<br>
suspension of lactic acid bacteria, a culture medium of lactic<br>
acid bacteria (including lactic acid bacteria, supernatant, and<br>
medium itself), a broth of lactic acid bacteria (obtained by<br>
removing a solid component from the culture medium), or<br>
fermented milk of lactic acid bacteria (lactic acid bacteria<br>
beverage, sour milk, yoghurt, etc.). The processed cells of<br>
lactic acid bacteria may be, for example, ground cells, crushed<br>
cells, liquefied cells (extract, etc.), concentrated cells, paste<br>
cells, dried cells (spray-dried cells, freeze-dried cells,<br>
vacuum-dried cells, drum-dried cells), or diluted cells. The<br>
S-PT84 contained in a composition according to the present<br>
invention is separated from the fermented "Shibazuke," and as<br>
such a composition comprising the product of fermented fruits,<br>
vegetables, or cereals with S-PT84 is also suitable as one<br>
enbodyment of a composition according to the present<br>
invention. It should be noted that a composition comprising<br>
S-PT84 is safe because S-PT84 is separated from food, as<br>
described above.<br>
It is preferable that a composition according to the<br>
present invention be used as food, drinks, medicaments, or the<br>
like. More specifically, the composition is preferably used as a<br>
pharmaceutical composition having immunoregulating<br>
activities. When used as food or drink, it is preferable that the<br>
composition be provided as health food having<br>
immunoregulating activities. Further, the composition may be<br>
combined with conventional sweeteners, acidifiers, vitamins, or<br>
various other components to provide user-selective products.<br>
For example, the composition may be provided in the form of a<br>
tablet, a capsule, a health drink, a dairy product such as<br>
yoghurt or lactic acid bacteria beverage, a flavor enhancer,<br>
processed food, dessert, or confectionary.<br>
Examples of medicaments include an immunostimulant<br>
and an anti-allergic drug. The composition may be prepared<br>
into a medicament as an active component in combination with<br>
conventional auxiliaries commonly used in the field of drug<br>
preparation. Examples of such auxiliaries include: an excipient,<br>
a binder, a disintegrator, a lubricant, a fragrance, a<br>
solubilizing agent, a suspending agent, and a coating agent.<br>
The form of dosage is not particularly limited. For example, the<br>
medicament may be in the form of a tablet, a capsule, a<br>
granule, a powder, a syrup, a suppository, or an injection. The<br>
administration route of the medicament is not particularly<br>
limited either. For example, oral administration, rectal<br>
administration, and transintestinal administration are<br>
available.<br>
[Examples]<br>
[Lactic acid bacteria strains used]<br>
Four kinds of Lactobacillus plantarum and twelve kinds of<br>
Lactobacillus pentosus were separated from "Shibazuke," a kind<br>
of traditional Kyoto pickles. These bacterial strains were<br>
compared with respect to inducible activity of interleukin 12<br>
(IL-12), in order to select strains with good Thl-type<br>
immunostimulating activity. For each strain used, Table 2 lists<br>
names of strain and species, and the presence or absence of<br>
EPS. From the result of comparison for IL-12 inducible activity,<br>
the activity of DS84C strain (S-PT84) was found to be<br>
particularly strong. As such, subsequent experiments were<br>
conducted only for S-PT84.<br>

[IL-12 induction by in vitro stimulation]<br>
First, 4.05% thioglycolate was intraperitoneally<br>
administered to BALB/c mice (7 weeks of age, male). After 4<br>
days, intraperitoneal macrophages were collected with PBS,<br>
and adjusted to 2 x 106 cells/mL using RPMI medium<br>
containing 10% FBS. The culture was inoculated on a 24-well<br>
plate (0.5 ml/well). Then, heat-killed cells (10 ug/mL) of each<br>
strain were added to each well, and, after 24 hour incubation,<br>
the IL-12 concentration of the supernatant was measured.<br>
Since the active form of IL-12 is P70 combining two subunits<br>
p35 and p40, the concentration of IL-12 (p70) was measured.<br>
For the measurement of IL-12, the OptEIA mouse IL-12 ELISA<br>
kit (BD Pharmingen) was used.<br>
The results are shown in Fig. 1. As is clear from Fig. 1,<br>
the inducible activity of IL-12 varied greatly even among the<br>
strains of the same species or same parental strain. Among<br>
these strains, the activity was particularly high in DW69N,<br>
S-PT84 (DS84C), and DS25C.<br>
[IL-12 induction by in vivo stimulation]<br>
A suspension (solvent; saline solution) of heat-killed cells<br>
(500ug/0.2mL/mouse) of each strain was intraperitoneally<br>
administered to BALB/c mice (7 weeks of age, male). After 6<br>
hours, the cervical was dislocated and the blood was collected<br>
from the heart. For the control mice, the same amount of<br>
saline solution was administered. The blood was collected 6<br>
hours after the administration because a preliminary analysis<br>
using S-PT84 had revealed that the peak concentration of<br>
serum IL-12 occurs 6 hours after the administration of dead<br>
cells (Fig. 2). After the blood was collected, the serum was<br>
collected by centrifugation. The IL-12 concentration in the<br>
serum was measured with the OptEIA mouse IL-12 ELISA kit<br>
(BD Pharmingen).<br>
The results are shown in Fig. 3. As is clear from Fig. 3,<br>
the concentration of serum IL-12 was significantly high for<br>
samples to which S-PT84 (DS84C), DS51C, and DS25C were<br>
administered, compared with the control. Since the S-PT84<br>
(DS84C) had the highest concentration, only this strain was<br>
used in subsequent experiments.<br>
[Effects S-PT84 on lymphocytes]<br>
Spleens were removed from BALB/c mice (7 weeks of age,<br>
male), and splenocytes were prepared according to ordinary<br>
method. The splenocytes were cultured for 24 hours in a<br>
medium containing (1 ug/ml) of heat-killed S-PT84 cells. As a<br>
control, the splenocytes were cultured alone in a medium<br>
(control). As another control, the splenocytes were also<br>
cultured in a medium with the addition of concanavalin A (2.5<br>
ug/mL) (Con A). In order to determine the type of cytokine<br>
produced by the stimulus of the S-PT84 dead cells, the<br>
cytokine concentration in the supernatant of each medium was<br>
measured using the CBAkit (BD Pharmingen). The splenocytes<br>
were collected and labeled with the fluorescent-labeled<br>
anti-CD4 antibody (CY-CHCROME™ label, BD bioscience),<br>
anti-CD8 antibody (FITC label, Immunotech), and anti-CD69<br>
antibody (PE label, BD bioscience), and the respective<br>
proportions of CD4-, CD8-, and CD69-positive cells were<br>
measured with the flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter).<br>
Fig. 4 depicts the result of cytokine production. Fig. 4(a)<br>
is the result for the control in which the medium was used<br>
alone, Fig. 4(b) is the result for S-PT84 in which the S-PT84<br>
dead cells were added to the medium, and Fig. 4(c) is the result<br>
for Con A in which concanavalin A was added to the medium.<br>
As is clear from Fig. 4, the S-PT84 stimulus produced IFN-y<br>
(interferon y) and TNF-a (tumor necrosis factor a), which were<br>
not observed in the control. These cytokines were Thl-type<br>
cytokines. It was therefore believed that the S-PT84 specifically<br>
induced Thl-type cytokines. The Th2-type cytokines such as<br>
IL-4 or IL-5 were not produced at all. With the concanavalin A<br>
stimulation, another type of Thl-type cytokine, IL-2<br>
(interleukin 2), was produced.<br>
Fig. 5 shows how the CD4 + , CD8 + , and CD69+ cells were<br>
affected. Fig. 5(a) is the result for the control in which the<br>
medium was used alone. Fig. 5(b) is the result for the S-PT84<br>
in which the S-PT84 dead cells (1 ug/mL) were added to the<br>
medium. Fig. 5(c) is the result for Con A in which concanavalin<br>
A was added to the medium. In Fig. 5, the directions of arrows<br>
indicate increasing numbers of positive cells for each surface<br>
antigen. As is clear from Fig. 5, the helper T cells and killer T<br>
cells were activated by the S-PT84.<br>
[Changes in hepatic lymphocytes after intraperitoneal<br>
administration of S-PT84]<br>
A suspension (solvent; saline solution) of heat-killed<br>
S-PT84 cells (500ug/0.2mL/mouse) was administered<br>
intraperitoneally to C57BL/6 mice (7 weeks of age, male). After<br>
24 hours, liver was removed, and hepatic lymphocytes were<br>
prepared by centrifugation. As a control, only the saline<br>
solution was intraperitoneally administered. The NK activity of<br>
the hepatic lymphocytes was measured by a PINK method. The<br>
PINK method is a method for calculating the cytotoxic activity<br>
of the mouse lymphocytes according to the following procedure.<br>
First, a target cell Yac-1 is labeled with<br>
3,3'-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (Dio), which is a<br>
hydrophobic fluorescent dye for labeling a membrane. Then,<br>
the nucleus of the dead cell is double stained with propidium<br>
iodide (PI), which is a membrane-impermeable nucleic acid<br>
binding fluorescent dye. The Yac-1 cells were detected with the<br>
flow cytometry, using Dio simple staining for uninjured cells,<br>
and double staining for injured cells. Further, the other<br>
hepatic cells were labeled with the fluorescent-labeled<br>
anti-CD4 antibody (CY-CHCROME™ label, BD bioscience),<br>
anti-CD8 antibody (FITC label, Immunotech), and anti-CD69<br>
antibody (PE label, BD bioscience), and the respective<br>
proportions of CD4-, CD8-, and CD69-positive cells were<br>
measured with the flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter).<br>
Fig. 6 shows the result of NK activity measurement. In Fig.<br>
6, the NK activity (%) indicates cellular cytotoxicity of the<br>
mouse hepatic lymphocytes against Yac-1, and E:T ratio<br>
indicates the value of the number of reacted hepatic<br>
lymphocytes versus the number of Yac-1 cells. As is clear from<br>
Fig. 6, the NK activity of the hepatic lymphocytes prepared<br>
from mice to which the S-PT84 was intraperineally<br>
administered was clearly higher than that of the control.<br>
Fig. 7 shows the results for CD4 + , CD8 + , and CD69+ cells,<br>
in which Fig. 7(a) is the result for the control, and Fig. 7(b) is<br>
the result with the administration of S-PT84. Further, in Fig. 7,<br>
the directions of arrows indicate increasing numbers of positive<br>
cells for each surface antigen. As is clear from Fig. 7, the<br>
number of CD8 + cells, as well as CD8 + CD69+ cells, clearly<br>
increased. It was therefore found that the administration of<br>
S-PT84 increases the number of the killer T cells in the liver,<br>
as well as the number of active killer T cells.<br>
[Thl/Th2 balance regulating activity by oral<br>
administration of S-PT84]<br>
Six BALB/c mice (7 weeks of age, male) were allowed to<br>
drink S-PT84 (dead cells)-containing water for a week<br>
(equivalent of 2 mg/day). As a control group, six mice with no<br>
S-PT84 were used. After one week, blood was collected from the<br>
heart, and spleen was removed. The serum was collected from<br>
the blood by centrifugation, and the IL-12 concentration in the<br>
serum was measured using the OptEIA mouse IL-12 ELISA kit<br>
(BD Biosciences). From the spleen, splenocytes were prepared<br>
by ordinary method, and the number of the CD4 + , CD8 + , and<br>
CD3+ cells in the splenic lymphocytes were counted<br>
(measurement was made with the flow cytometry, using labeled<br>
antibodies of the respective cells). Further, the NK activity was<br>
measured by the PINK method. A measurement of Thl/Th2<br>
ratio was also carried out (2.5 ug/ml of concanavalin A was<br>
allowed to act on 5 x 106 mouse splenocytes for 24 hours, and<br>
the concentrations of resulting IL-4 and IFN-y in the<br>
supernatant were measured). The Thl/Th2 ratio was obtained<br>
by dividing the IFN-y concentration by 11-4 concentration.<br>
Fig. 8 shows the result of measurement of serum IL-12<br>
concentration. As is clear from Fig. 8, the concentration of<br>
serum IL-12 in the S-PT84-orally administered mice was<br>
significantly higher than that of the control group (Cont).<br>
Table 3 below represents the result of measurement of<br>
CD4 + , CD8 + , and CD3+ cells. As is clear from Fig. 3, the<br>
splenic lymphocyte T subset had a tendency to increase.<br>

Fig. 9 shows the result of measurement of NK activity. In<br>
Fig. 9, the NK activity (%) indicates cytotoxicity of the mouse<br>
splenocytes against Yac-1, and E:T ratio indicates the value of<br>
the number of reacted splenocytes versus the number of Yac-1<br>
cells. As is clear from Fig. 9, the NK activity of the splenocytes<br>
prepared from the mice to which S-PT84 was orally<br>
administered was significantly higher than that of the control<br>
group (Cont).<br>
Fig. 10 shows the result of measurement of Thl/Th2 ratio.<br>
As is clear from Fig. 10, the splenocytes prepared from mice to<br>
which the S-PT84 was orally administered had a considerably<br>
large proportion of Thl cytokine as compared with the control<br>
group (Cont).<br>
As described above, the Thl-type cytokine was induced in<br>
mice to which the S-PT84 was orally administered. As a result,<br>
the Thl/Th2 balance shifted to Thl dominant, and the NK<br>
activity increased as a result. This proved the Thl/Th2 balance<br>
adjusting activity and immunostimulating activity of the<br>
S-PT84.<br>
[Effects on change of the weight of<br>
cyclophosphamide-administered mice]<br>
Twenty BALB/c mice (7 weeks of age, male) were divided<br>
into two groups of an almost equal average weight, so as to<br>
provide an S-PT84 administered group and an S-PT84<br>
non-administered group (control group). The S-PT84<br>
administered group was allowed to drink S-PT84 (dead<br>
cellsj-containing water for 22 days (equivalent of 2 mg/day).<br>
After 8 days from the start of administration, 200 mg/kg of<br>
cyclophosphamide (CY) (antitumor chemotherapeutic drug,<br>
alkylating agent) was intraperitoneally administered to all<br>
individuals. A weight of each individual was measured on the<br>
1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 8th, 12th, and 15th days from the CY<br>
administration.<br>
Fig. 11 shows changes, in average body weight in the both<br>
groups. As is clear from Fig. 11, a body weight loss caused by<br>
the CY administration was suppressed in the S-PT84<br>
administered group, as compared with the control group<br>
(Control).<br>
[Effects on IL-12 production in<br>
cyclophosphamide-administered mice]<br>
BALB/c mice (7 weeks of age, male) were divided into 5<br>
groups: an untreated group (5 mice); an S-PT84<br>
non-administered and CY non-administered group (10 mice); an<br>
S-PT84 non-administered and CY administered group (10<br>
mice); an S-PT84 administered and CY non-administered group<br>
(10 mice); and an S-PT84 administered and CY administered<br>
group (11 mice). The two S-PT84 administered groups were<br>
allowed to drink S-PT84 (dead cells)-containing water for 12<br>
days (equivalent of 2 mg/day). After 7 days from the start of<br>
administration, 200mg/kg of cyclophosphamide (CY) (antitumor<br>
chemotherapeutic drug, alkylating agent) was intraperitoneally<br>
administered to the CY administered groups. After 5 days from<br>
the CY administration, a suspension (solvent; saline solution)<br>
of heat-killed cells of S-PT84 (SOOug/ 0.2ml/mouse) was<br>
intraperitoneally administered to the mice of all groups except<br>
for the untreated group. Six hours after the administration of<br>
S-PT84 dead cells, blood was collected from the heart in all<br>
individuals, inchiding those in the untreated group. From the<br>
collected blood, the serum was collected by centrifugation, and<br>
the IL-12 concentration in the serum was measured with the<br>
OptEIA mouse IL-12 ELISA kit (BD Pharmingen).<br>
The results are shown in Fig. 12. As is clear from Fig. 12,<br>
the CY administration in the S-PT84 non-administered group<br>
reduced the IL-12 concentration in the serum by a considerable<br>
amount. On the other hand, in the S-PT84 administered group,<br>
the reduction of IL-12 concentration in the serum caused by<br>
the CY administration was suppressed significantly, and the<br>
IL-12 concentration in the serum was almost equal to that of<br>
the control group.<br>
From these results, it was proved that the S-PT84 has the<br>
ability to suppress a weight loss and immune reduction caused<br>
by CY. In other words, the immunostimulating activity of the<br>
S-PT84 was confirmed.<br>
[Analysis of anti-allergy activities]<br>
Thirty-six BALB/c mice (7 weeks of age, male) were<br>
divided into four groups: an untreated group (5 mice); a control<br>
group (10 mice); an S-PT84 group (11 mice); and a<br>
dexamethasone administered group (10 mice). The S-PT84<br>
group was allowed to drink S-PT84 (dead cells)-containing<br>
water for 7 weeks (equivalent of 2 mg/day). To the Dex<br>
administered group, 0.5 mg/kg of S-PT84 was forcibly<br>
administered for 7 weeks by oral administration. The untreated<br>
group and control group were allowed to drink tap water for 7<br>
weeks. Note that, the Dex is a steroid drug with anti-allergenic<br>
and anti-inflammatory activities, and was used as a positive<br>
control drug. One week and two weeks after the S-PT84 uptake<br>
or Dex administration, a mixture containing 20 ug of<br>
ovalbumin (OVA) and 2 mg of aluminum hydroxide gel was<br>
intraperitoneally administered to the mice of all groups except<br>
for the untreated group. From the second administration (0<br>
week) to the 5th week, blood was collected every week a total of<br>
6 times from all individuals, and an OVA-specific IgE<br>
concentration was measured. The measurement of OVA-specific<br>
IgE concentration in the serum was carried out according to<br>
the ELISA method, using a modified OptEIA mouse IgE ELISA<br>
kit (BD Pharmingen) in which OVA was coated instead of the<br>
capturing antibody. Using the blood sample from the third<br>
week, total IgE was measured. The measurement of total IgE<br>
was carried out according to the ELISA method, using the<br>
OptEIA mouse IgE ELISA kit.<br>
Fig. 13 shows changes in OVA-specific IgE concentration<br>
on the 3rd week of the experiment start. Fig. 14 shows the<br>
result of measurement on total IgE concentration. As is clear<br>
from Fig. 13, the S-PT84 group significantly suppressed the<br>
increase of OVA-specific IgE concentration as compared with<br>
the control group (control). In the Dex group, the result was<br>
not significantly different from the control group, though some<br>
suppressing effect was observed. Further, as is clear from Fig.<br>
14, the S-PT84 group and Dex group significantly suppressed<br>
increase of total IgE concentration as compared with the<br>
control group (control).<br>
It became clear from these results that the S-PT84 had an<br>
anti-allergy activity.<br>
[Analysis of suppressing effect on stress-induced immune<br>
reduction]<br>
Nine C57BL/6 mice (6 weeks of age, male) were divided<br>
into three groups of an almost equal average weight, so as to<br>
provide a control group (3 mice), a stressed group (3 mice), and<br>
an S-PT84 administered and stressed group (3 mice). The<br>
S-PT84 administered group was allowed to drink S-PT84 (dead<br>
cellsj-containing water for 7 days (equivalent of 2 mg/day). On<br>
the eighth day of the administration, a total of 6 mice in the<br>
stressed group and the S-PT84 administered and stressed<br>
group were immersed in water, placed in a 50 ml polyethylene<br>
tube whose tip had an air vent, and restricted for 24 hours.<br>
The control group was deprived of food and water. From each<br>
animal, the spleen was removed, and splenic lymphocytes were<br>
prepared for the measurement of NK activity.<br>
Fig. 15 shows the result of measurement on NK activity.<br>
The stressed group showed a significant drop in NK activity<br>
compared with the control group. The S-PT84 administered and<br>
stressed group maintained NK activity comparable to that of<br>
the control group, i.e., the NK activity level was significantly<br>
higher than that of the stressed group. This proved that the<br>
S-PT84 had the activity of suppressing stress-induced immune<br>
reduction.<br>
[Difference in immunostimulating activity between dead<br>
cells and viable cells]<br>
The immunostimulating activities were compared between<br>
dead cells and viable cells of the lactic acid bacteria. For the<br>
comparison, the lactic acid bacteria that increased the mouse<br>
serum IL-12 concentration in response to intraperitoneal<br>
administration as shown in Fig. 3 were used.<br>
Suspensions of 4 kinds of lactic acid bacteria (DB22C,<br>
DS51C, DS2C and DS84C (S-PT84)), both in the form of<br>
heat-killed cells and viable cells, were prepared (each weighing<br>
500 pg (2.5xl08/0.2mL/mouse)). The suspensions were<br>
intraperitoneally administered to BALB/c mice (7 weeks of age,<br>
male). After 6 hours, the cervical was dislocated and the blood<br>
was collected from the heart. As a control, a mouse to which<br>
the same amount of saline solution was administered instead<br>
of the lactic acid bacteria was used.<br>
After the blood was collected, the serum was collected by<br>
centrifugation. The IL-12 concentration in the serum was<br>
measured with the OptEIA (BD Pharmingen). The results are<br>
shown in Fig. 16.<br>
As in the case of Fig. 3, the amount of serum IL-12 was<br>
greatest for samples to which DS84C (S-PT84) was<br>
administered. As is also clear from Fig. 16, the amount of IL-12<br>
was higher for the samples to which the viable cells of DS84C<br>
(S-PT84) were administered than for the samples to which the<br>
dead cells were administered.<br>
[Producing example 1: Tablet]<br>
An S-PT84-containing medicament (tablet) was produced<br>
according to the following procedures.<br>
A mixture containing 66.7 g of a dried pulverized powder<br>
of S-PT84, 232.0 g of lactose, and 1.3 g of magnesium stearate<br>
was punched with a single punch tableting machine, so as to<br>
produce tablets each having a diameter of 10 mm and a weight<br>
of 300 mg.<br>
[Producing example 2: Yoghurt]<br>
S-PT84 fermented milk with a 21% solid milk component<br>
was added to commercially available milk, and the mixture was<br>
allowed to stand for 3 days so as to prepare yoghurt. The<br>
resulting yoghurt had a desirable flavor.<br>
[Producing example 3: Lactic acid bacteria drinks]<br>
By using S-PT84, a lactic acid bacteria beverage was<br>
prepared with the compositions shown in Table 4. The<br>
resulting lactic acid bacteria beverage had a desirable flavor.<br>
