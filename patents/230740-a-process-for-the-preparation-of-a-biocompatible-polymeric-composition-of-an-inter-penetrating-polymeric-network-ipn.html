FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a composition of an interpenetrating polymeric network for the treatment of diabetes mel1itus and a process for the preparation thereof.<br>
This invention further relates to a composition of an interpene¬trating polymeric network (IPN) for preparing retrievable, inartificial implant for the treatment of diabetes mel1itus.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Type I diabetes an autoimmune disorder of endocrine pancreas is a major health concern worldwide and has long term systemic complications. Transplantation of isolated insulin-secreting islet cells of langerhans is a comparatively recent approach^ which is easier and safer than whole pancreas transplantation. However^ immunosuppression is one of the major concerns of such transplant procedures. Critical shortage of donor islet cells is another concern in such technology. It is hence desirable to use Biohybrid devices that employ synthetic semipermeable membranes to encapsulate islet cells and allow the use of alio or xeno origin cells. The membranes are expected to permi t the crossover of low molecular weight substances such as nutrient electrolytes, oxygen and bio-secretor products but not of transplant effectors. Polymeric membranes such as alginate-poly (L-lysine &gt;, polycar¬bonate* polyvinyl chloride - acrrylic copolymers, poly (2-hydroxy ethyl   methacrylate)5  agarose,  polyvinyl  alcohol  have   been<br><br>
proposed as immunoisolation matrices. Such membranes have been used in various device configurations including microcapsules, AV shunts^ hoi low fibers and planar diffusion chambers• However, fibrotic react ions» biocompatibllity, mechanical fragility and reduced permeation have been reported to be the 1imiting -factors for the widespread use of these candidate materials* It is the basic requirement that the membrane materials should exhibit satisfactory biocompatibllity, ie. the ability of the material to induce minimal inflammatory response in the host's tissue resulting in acceptance of the implant without altering its function.<br>
For a successful application of this technology, the ability to retrieve a material, which may not function to the best possible response, should also be possible. Degraded microcapsules of encapsulating membranes or non-functional islets that cannot be retrieved may pose a problem in the long term by inducing antigenic reactions.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose a bio¬compatible polymeric composition which does not induce fibrotic reactions.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to propose a bio¬compatible polymeric composition which is easily retrievable-<br><br>
Another  object  of this invention to propose  a  bio-compatible polymeric  composition   which is effective for the  treatment  of diabetes without immunosuppression«<br>
Yet another object of this invention to propose a bio-compatible polymeric composition for immunoisolating encapsulated ^ islet cells within the membranes and which permit the cells to be V1ab1e *<br>
Other objects and advantages of the invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description•<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus  according  to this invention is  provided  a  biocompatible<br>

urethane  in  a  good solvent for  it  such  as  tetrahydrofuraoi<br>
dimethyl  formamide«  dimethyl acetamide to  form  a  homogeneous<br>
solution?  either at room temperature or by heating in the  range<br>
o of 60-70  C   and stirringi if necessary. A monomer of  the  second<br>
polymer is chosen from a group of either hydrophobic or hydro-philic vinyl monomers and a weight fraction of i0-Z0% of the same is dissolved in the same chosen solvent for the polyurethane and stirred together so as to form a homogeneous mixture. An initiator of the monomer of the second polymer is chosen from a group of either free radical or redox or other initiator for a vinyl monomer and a weight fraction of 1-2% of the second monomer concentration dissolved in the same chosen solvent for the poly¬urethane and stirred together so as to form a homogeneous mixture. Further» a crosslinker of the second polymer9 which may be another smal1 molecule with a vinyl group in it such as ethylene glycol dimethacrylate» N,N' bis acrylamide, etc. at a weight fraction of 1-254 of the second monomer concentration 9 is dissolved  in  the satne chosen solveTit for the  polyurethane  and<br>
stirred together so as to form a homogeneous mixture * The mixture<br>
a is allowed to cure   together in a mold for 24-48 hours at 60-75 C.<br>
The IPN is formed by comfain-ation of two polymers where the  first<br>
polymer  is  a  polyurethane and the second polymer  is  a  vinyl<br>
polymer.  The  polyurethane is a  1inear  segmented  polyurethane<br><br>
which has hard and soft segments with a polyol as the soft segment and a diol or diamine as the chain extender- The poly-* urethane may be either aliphatic or aromatic in nature.<br>
The second polymer is a vinyl polymer which may be from a group which is either a hydrophilic or hydrophobic.<br>

followed by extraction with solutions of hexane and ethanol-water<br>
mixtures and distilled water to remove unreacted components  from<br>
the membrane.<br><br>
In accordance with a further embodiment 9 the IPN solution is made into a porous tube by coating on a plastic mandrel once in the solution and withdrawing. The mandrel is then inverted and allowed to cure by contacting air for 1 hr-. It is then dipped in ice cold water for 15 mins. to form the first coat layer of IPN1 The first coat IPN mandrel is dipped in the IPN solution for the second time to form the second layer. The procedure is continued till multiple layers, for eg. five consecutive layers of IPN are obtained. After which the mandrel is left in ice cold water for 24 hrs.

Example 8:<br>
Encapsulation of islet cells in PU-PVP macrocapsules for treatment of diabetes in animal models.<br>
A6. Isolation of pancreatic islet cells from mice<br>
BALB/c mice of 10 weeks were sacrificed by cervk:al dislocatkni, pancreas dissected, minced and incubated in 1 mg/ml collagenase P (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) on a shaker platform for 20 minutes. Freshly isolated islets were then cultured in RPM11640 (GibcoBRL, NY, USA) medium with 10% FCS<br><br>
for 48 h. Islets (n=30) were handpicked and cultured on membranes (1 cm^) in 24 well plate (Nunclon. Denmark) and their morphology observed under phase contrast microscope for 5 days. Viability of islets cultured on membranes was detennined by trypan blue dye exclusion test, using 0.04 % (vwV) trypan blue. Islets staining blue were scored dead while viable islets were those that did not take up the dye.<br>
B6 . Encapsulation of mice pancreatic islet cells in PU-PVP macrocapsules<br>
Viable islets of (1 IE == 150 ^m diameter islet) were handpicked and washed with Hanks buffer. Islets were suspended in a solution of 2 wt % sodium alginate such that a total concenteration of 500 IE of islets could be introduced through the open end, in each tubular macrocapsule formed from a PU-PVP IPN ( prepared earlier as per example 7 above), of dimensions 3.8mm inner diameter, and enclosing a volume of 200 pi, by addition of 150 pi of the alginate-islet suspension and having one open end. A small amount of calcium chloride solution may or may not be added to increase the viscosity of the alginate gel and prevent free flow of the suspension of islets from the macrocapsule. The open end of the macrocapsule was then sealed with a heat seal and edges of the seal rounded by immersion of the portion of the seal in a solution of the same IPN composition and immediately washing in Hanks buffer. The macrocapsules containing islet cells were stored in Hanks solution before surgery for transplantation was started on the animal models.<br>
Example 9:<br>
In vivo biohvbrid pancreas transplantation studies<br>
Streptozotocine induced diabetic mice were used for the transplantation and monitoring of diabetic status in animal experiments. Animals were fasted overnight and anaesthetized by /.p. administration of thiopental sodium at a dose of 40 mg/kg body weight. A small incision is made in peritoneum and two tubular grafts containing 500 IE (1 IE = 150 ^m diameter islet) each, suspended in 1% alginate gel matrix, were implanted while diabetic control animals received empty tubular grafts. Inct^&gt;ns were sutured using absorbable 6-0 catgut sutures and autoclipper (Becton Dickinson, USA). All animals received an i-p injection of gentamycin (3 nr^g b.w.), ampicittin and ckDxacillin (20 mg/kg b.w.) and diclofenac sodium (0.5 mg/kg b,w.), for 3 days (starting from the operattve day) in addition to the topical ointments (Soframycin). Animals were followed for 14 post-operative weeks with weekly non-fasting blood glucose measurements using glucose oxidase kit (Sigma, USA). On 12^ week post-transplantation, some of the tubuter grafte (n=4) were retrieved to confirm islet graft functloa All animals v^re also subjected to intra peritoneal glucose tolerance test (2.0 g/kg b.w.) at the end of 12*^ week post transplantation. The study was carried out in 12 animals and compared to a similar number of control normal mice glucose levels during the sanr^ period. The glucose levels in the diabetic mice which were initially highly elevated couM be brought down to normal levels within 48<br><br>
hours of implantation of the encapsulated islet macrocapsules. The normal glycemic levels were maintained throughout the period of the study confirming the utility of the system to cure diabetes in a diabetic animal model. No immunesuppressing drugs to avoid the rejection of the transplanted islets was used in this study and the macrocapsule is believed to have selectively perfomed as a barrier for the transfer of Immunoglobulins, cytokines, macrophages and other cells of the host animal that can cause rejection of the transplanted islets.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
