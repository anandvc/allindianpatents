				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel polyur ethane elastomers and a method for the preparation thereof.<br>
Polyurethane elastomers are made by reacting diisocyanates , such as toluene diisocyanate (TDI) , 1,5 naphthalene diisocyanate (NDI) or 4,4' diphenylme thane diisocyanate (4,4'-MDI), with high molecular weight polyols, such as polyester polyols or polyether polyols, and low molecular weight polyols or polyamines, such as ethylene glycol or butane diol.<br>
High molecular weight polyether polyols mainly used are polytetrahydrofuran or polypropyleneoxide .<br>
The preparation of elastomeric polyurethanes from polyether polyols containing minor amounts of ethylene oxide (EO) -groups is also known, see for example EP-A-13487.<br>
Formulations comprising high amounts of 4,4' -MDI and polyether polyols having high EO-contents have already been used to prepare flexible p foams, see for example EP-A-547764, EP-A-547765 and EP-A-549120.<br>
None of the known isocyanate-based elastomers however shows satisfactory dynamic modulus behaviour over a broad temperature range.<br>
A new class of polyurethane elastomers has now been found which show a quasi-perfect elastomeric behaviour over a broad temperature range.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to polyisocyanate-based elastomers having a ratio of the storage modulus (E1) at 20°C and the storage modulus (E1) at 120°C of between 0.75 and 1.5, a tan 5 at 100°C of less than 0.1 and a maximum value of the tan 5 of more than 0.8, the tan 5 being the ratio of the loss modulus (E1') and the storage modulus (E1).<br>
Preferably, the maximum value of the tan 5 is more than 1.0.<br>
The ratio of the storage modulus (E1) at 20 °C and the storage modulus (E1) at 120°C is preferably between 0.8 and 1.2, and most preferably between 0.85 and<br><br>
It is preferred to have a tan 6 at 100°C of less than 0.05. Most preferably the tan 5 at 100°C is less than 0.03.<br>
The prime maximum of the tan 5 preferably occurs at a temperature below 0°C, most preferably below -10°C.<br>
The storage and loss modulus are measured by Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMT A measured according to ISO/DIS 6721-5).<br>
These novel polyurethane elastomers can be made from formulations containing polyols having high oacyethylene contents or polyol blends containing polyester polyols and high concentrations of polyols having high oxyethylene contents, substantially pure 4,4'-MDI or a derivative thereof, and a low molecular weight chain extender and optionally a crosslinking agent.<br>
Thus, according to the invention, there is also provided a method for the preparation of polyurethane elastomers from a reaction mixture comprising a polyisocyanate component, a polyol composition, a chain extender and optionally a crosslinking agent wherein the polyisocyanate component contains at least 85% by weight of 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate or a variant thereof, the polyol composition comprises at least one polyoxyalkylene polyol containing oxyethylene residues, said polyol composition having an average nominal hydroxyl functionality of from 2 to 4, an average hydroxyl equivalent weight of from 500 to 7000 and an average oxyethylene content of between 50 and 85% by weight, and the chain extender has an average hydroxyl equivalent weight of up to 250.<br>
The polyisocyanate component used in the invention may be any aromatic or aliphatic polyisocyanate such as TDI, NDI or pure 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate or mixtures of that diisocyanate with one or more other organic polyisocyanates, especially other diphenylmethane diisocyanate isomers, for example the 2,4'-isomer optionally in conjunction with the 2,2'-isomer. The polyisocyanate component may also be an MDI variant derived from a polyisocyanate composition containing at least 85% by weight of 4,4'-diphenylroethane diisocyanate. MDI variants are well known in the art and, for use in accordance with the invention, particularly include liquid products obtained by introducing uretonimine and/or carbodiimide groups into said polyisocyanate composition and/or by reacting with one or more polyols.<br><br>
Preferred as the polyisocyanate component are polyisocyanate compositions containing at least 90% by weight of 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate. Polyisocyanate compositions containing at least 95% by weight of 4,4'-diphenylinethane diisocyanate are most preferred.<br>
The polyol composition may consist of one or more polyether polyols optionally blended with other polyols, such as polyester polyols.<br>
The composition may comprise a single polyoxyalkylene polyol which preferably is a poly(oxyethylene-oxypropylene) polyol having the required functionality, equivalent weight and oxyethylene content. Such polyols are known in the art and may be obtained in conventional manner by reacting ethylene and propylene oxides simultaneously and/or sequentially in any order with an initiator such as water, a polyol, a hydroxylamine, a polyamine and the like having from 2 to 4 active hydrogen atoms.<br>
Alternatively, the polyol composition may comprise a mixture of two or more polyoxyalkylene polyols such that the total composition has the required average functionality, equivalent weight and oxyethylene content. The polyoxyalkylene polyols present in such mixtures are preferably poly(oxyethylene-oxypropylene) polyols but one or more polyoxyethylene polyols and/or polyoxypropylene polyols may also be present.<br>
Preferred polyether polyol compositions comprise:<br>
(a)	from 75 to 100% by weight of a first polyol component comprising at<br>
least one polyoxyalkylene polyol containing oxyethylene residues, said<br>
polyol component having an average nominal hydroxyl functionality of<br>
from 2 to 4, an average hydroxyl equivalent weight of from 1000 to 5000<br>
and an average oxyethylene content of from 60 to 85% by weight, and<br>
(b)	from 25 to 0% by weight of another polyol component.<br>
Polyol component (b) suitably has an average functionality of from 2 to 4, an average equivalent weight of 1000 to 3000 and may be, for example, a polyoxypropylene polyol, a polyoxyethylene polyol or a poly(oxyethylene-oxypropylene) polyol containing less than 60% or more than 85% by weight of oxyethylene residues.<br>
The term "average nominal hydroxyl functionality" is used herein to indicate the average functionality (number of hydroxyl groups per molecule) of the polyol composition on the assumption that the average functionality of the<br><br>
polyoxyalkylene polyols present therein is identical with the average functionality (number of active hydrogen atoms per molecule) of the initiator(s) used in their preparation although in practice it will often be somewhat less because of some terminal unsaturation.<br>
It is preferred that the average nominal hydroxyl functionality of the polyol composition is from 2 to 3.<br>
If desired, the polyoxyalkylene polyol (or one or more of the polyoxyalkylene polyols when a mixture is used) may contain dispersed polymer particles. Such polymer modified polyols have been fully described in the prior art and include products obtained by the in situ polymerisation of one or more vinyl monomers, for example acrylonitrile and styrene, in polyoxyalkylene polyols or by the in situ reaction between a polyisocyanate and an amino-or hydroxy-functional compound, for example triethanolamine, in the polyoxyalkylene.<br>
Also suitable as polyol (b) are polyester polyols.<br>
Polyester polyols which may be used include hydroxyl-terminated reaction products of polyhydric alcohols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, bis(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate, glycerol, trimethylolpropane, hexanediol, neopentyl glycol, methylpentane diol, pentaerythritol or polyether polyols or mixtures of such polyhydric alcohols, and polycarboxylic acids, especially dicarboxylic acids or their ester-forming derivatives, for example succinic, glutaric and adipic acids or their dimethyl esters, sebacic acid, phthalic anhydride, tetrachlorophthalic anhydride or dimethyl terephthalate or mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferred polyesters have a number average molecular weight of 750-4000, especially 750-2500, and an average nominal functionality of 2-3.<br>
Suitable chain extenders include low molecular weight diols, aminoalcohols or diamines such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, propanediol, butanediol, pentanediol, hexanediol, 3-methylpentane-1,5-diol, ethanolamine or diethyltoluenediamine.<br>
Low molecular weight isocyanate-reactive compounds having an average functionality of 3 or more, such as glycerol, pentaerythritol or triethanolamine, may be added as crosslinking agents.<br>
It is preferred to add small amounts of water, most preferably less than 2%<br>
by weight based on the total weight of the isocyanate-reactive, to the formulation. The isocyanate-index of the reaction system, talcing account of the polyol composition, water and any other isocyanate-reactive species, for example chain extenders and opt. crosslinking agents, may be as low as 85 or as high as 120. Preferably, the isocyanate index is between 90 and 110. The most preferred isocyanate-index is between 95 and 105.<br>
The elastomer-forming reaction mixture may contain one or more of the additives conventional to such reaction mixtures. Such additives include catalysts, for example tertiary amines and tin compounds, surface-active agents and foam stabilisers, for example siloxane-oxyalkylene copolymers, flame retardants, organic and inorganic fillers, pigments, and internal mould release agents.<br>
The invention furthermore provides a reaction system comprising:<br>
(a)	a polyisocyanate component containing at least 85% by weight of 4,4'-<br>
dipheny1methane diisocyanate or a variant thereof;<br>
(b)	a polyol composition comprising at least one polyoxyalkylene polyol<br>
containing oxyethylene residues, said polyol composition having an<br>
average nominal hydroxyl functionality of from 2 to 4, an average<br>
hydroxyl equivalent weight of from 500 to 7000 and an average<br>
oxyethylene content of between 50 and 85% by weight;<br>
(c)	a chain extender having an average hydroxyl equivalent weight of up to<br>
250, and optionally,<br>
(d)	water,<br>
(e)	a crosslinking agent, and<br>
(f)	one or more additives conventional to elastomer formulations.<br>
This reaction system is used for making polyurethane elastomers.<br>
In operating the method of the invention, the known one-shot, semi-prepolymer or full prepolymer techniques may be applied together with mixing equipment conventionally used in the preparation of elastomers.<br>
The elastomers according to the invention are particularly suitable for use in applications where good energy-absorbing and fatigue properties are required and a good elastomeric behaviour over a broad temperature range, e.g. in the automotive and footwear industry.<br>
Accordingly there is provided a method for the preparation of elastomers from a reaction mixture comprising a polyisocyanate component, p. polyol composition, a chain extender and optionally a crosslinking agent wherein the polyisocyanate component contains at least 85% by weight of 4, 4' -diphenylmethane diisocyanate or a variant thereof, the polyol composition comprises at least one polyoxyalkylene polyol containing oxyethylene residues, said polyol composition having an average nominal hydroxyl functionally of from 2 to 4, an average hydroxyl equivalent weight of from 500 to 7000 and an average oxyethylene content of between 50 and 85% by weight, and the chain extender has an average hydroxyl equivalent weight of up to 250.<br>
