				<td>APPARATUS FOR PRESSURIZING A FLUID AND DELIVERING A GAS AND A<br>
METHOD THEREFOR<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for pressurizing a fluid and delivering a gas and<br>
a method therefor.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Delivering pressurized gas can be facilitated by first pumping or pressurizing it in a fluid<br>
phase when the substance is denser than it is in the gaseous phase. Of course, when an end user<br>
requires a gas, such a method requires an additional processing step to convert the pressurized fluid<br>
to a gas. For example, after a liquefied gas is pressurized, a heater may be employed to warm or boil<br>
the pressurized fluid to convert it into a gas. However, many applications, including lower pressure<br>
systems, do not warrant the additional equipment and processing steps required to utilize the above<br>
process, rendering this method impractical in these situations.<br>
Frequently, where gas delivery systems experience sudden demands that cannot be met by the<br>
pump alone, an accumulator is included in the delivery system. Generally, conventional delivery<br>
systems include an accumulator preceding and often adjacent to the point of delivery allowing for an<br>
immediate supply of pressurized gas. A significant restraint on accumulators, however, is the fact<br>
that they, as storage vessels, require space. In many applications sufficient space for a conventional<br>
accumulator is not available or is impractical near the delivery point. By way of example, end users<br>
of high pressure gaseous fuels or combustion catalysts such as stand alone generators or natural gas<br>
powered vehicles typically use a plurality of fuel injection valves and thus have a plurality of delivery<br>
points for injecting fuel into an engine. Space for a conventional accumulator is typically not<br>
available next to each injection valve. In any event, space is limited in and around these engines in<br>
many cases especially where such space must be, in effect, transported along with a vehicle reducing<br>
room for storage or other uses. Examples of such fuels or combustions catalyst include methane,<br>
propane, ethane and derivatives of these hydrocarbons, as well as hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
For the purposes of this application it will be understood that any references to fluids include<br>
liquids as well as liquids pressurized above the supercritical point of the gas of interest. Similarly,<br>
any references to gases include gases pressurized above the supercritical point of those gases. More<br>
generally, if the desired substance to be delivered is to be delivered at a pressure placing it above the<br>
supercritical point of the substance, then that substance generally will also be included in any<br>
reference to a gas where corresponding fluid is, at some point in the gas delivery<br>
system, at a lower temperature and pressure prior to being delivered.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is an apparatus that includes a pump that has an intake<br>
opening so that it can receive a quantity of the cryogenic fluid, pressurize it to a<br>
pressure above its storage pressure and deliver it to an accumulator within the<br>
cryogen space. The accumulator includes a storage volume to hold the pressurized<br>
fluid so that it is available depending on the demands of the end user. Beyond the<br>
accumulator the invention includes a heater that accepts the pressurized fluid from<br>
the accumulator and delivers a pressurized gas at a temperature greater than the<br>
initial temperature at which the fluid is stored.<br>
The heater included in the invention may in, in a further embodiment,<br>
include a heating substance and at least one channel for housing that heating<br>
substance. The heating substance should be capable of warming the cryogenic fluid<br>
to convert it from a fluid to a gas as desired. The included heating substance may<br>
be a heating fluid capable of being circulated through one or more channels found in<br>
the heater. One embodiment of the invention contemplates delivering a fuel from<br>
the delivery outlet of the heater for use in an engine as well as utilizing the engine<br>
coolant as a heating fluid.<br>
A further embodiment of apparatus includes a heater with a fluid passageway<br>
for directing the fluid from through the channel noted above to a delivery outlet.<br>
The fluid passageway may be defined by a pipe.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention includes one or more reciprocating<br>
pumps for delivering the pressurized fluid.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention includes one or more drive units<br>
capable of driving the pump. The drive unit may be in communication with the<br>
pump via a piston rod running between the drive unit and the pump.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention includes an accumulator that includes<br>
a sleeve which defines an accumulator space as well as a storage vessel that defines<br>
the storage volume. The storage vessel may be a coil tube. Further, the sleeve may<br>
also be a thermal insulator inhibiting thermal conduction into the cryogen space.<br>
The accumulator space may also include insulators including thermal convection<br>
inhibitors as well as thermal conduction inhibitor and / or an evacuated space within<br>
this accumulator space.<br>
Any material in the accumulator space or between the accumulator and heater designed to<br>
reduce heat transfer may be chosen such that it falls below 15 W/m x K.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention the apparatus may integrate the pump, accumulator<br>
and heater together wherein the accumulator would be integrated between the pump and heater, by<br>
way of example, in a single encasing or casing assembly. Integrated connections between each<br>
component within a single casing assembly help to eliminate potential failure point in the apparatus<br>
as a whole.<br>
The present invention also contemplates a method of receiving a quantity of a fluid at an<br>
initial pressure, pressurizing that fluid and storing the fluid within an accumulator readily available<br>
for delivery within a pre-determined pressure range, and heating and delivering the fluid as a<br>
pressurized gas from the accumulator storage.<br>
The fluid in question in the invention may be at a pressure above or below the supercritical<br>
point of that fluid and the gas may too be above or below the supercritical point of the delivered gas.<br>
The gas delivered, however, must be at a higher pressure than its pressure in storage prior to pumping<br>
and being delivered to the accumulator. Also, the temperature of the delivered gas must at a<br>
temperature above that of the fluid found in storage prior to being pumped and delivered to the<br>
accumulator and on-wards to the heater.<br>
The present invention includes embodiments that draw from a stored fluid prior to pumping<br>
that includes fluids that comprise at least one of methane, methanol, ethane, propane, hydrogen,<br>
oxygen, butane, methane, ethane or other hydrocarbon derivatives that are gases at room temperature<br>
and atmospheric pressure, as well as, generally, a fluid that comprises an element that is combustible<br>
as a gas.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an apparatus for pressurizing a fluid and<br>

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiment(s)<br>
Throughout the following description specific details are set forth in order to<br>
provide a more thorough understanding of the invention. However, the invention<br>
may be practiced without these particulars. In other instances, well known elements<br>
have not been shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the<br>
present invention. Accordingly, the specification and drawings are to be regarded<br>
in an illustrative, rather than a restrictive, sense.<br>
Generally, the subject invention relates to an integrated apparatus that<br>
incorporates a pump, an accumulator and a heater for pressurizing and delivering a<br>
gas. A fluid is pressurized in the apparatus and delivered from the apparatus as a<br>
gas.<br>
With reference to Figures 2 and 3, apparatus 12 incorporates four distinct<br>
sections: cold end 14, accumulator 16, heater section 18 and drive section 20. With<br>
reference to the cross sectional side view found in Figure 1, generally, a fluid<br>
pressurizing means such as a pump is housed in or embodied by cold end 14.<br>
Accumulator 16 is defined herein as comprising accumulator coil 24 and also the<br>
components that enable accumulator coil 24 to function as an accumulator as shown<br>
in the section generally identified as accumulator 16. A heater is housed in or<br>
embodied by heater section 18, and a pump driver is housed in or embodied by<br>
drive section 20. Referring to figure 4, in use apparatus 12 may extend into, by<br>
way of example, fluid holding tank assembly 31, which is capable of storing a fluid<br>
within vessel 13.<br>
By way of example, a preferred style of pump is a reciprocating piston pump<br>
as shown in the figures. The pump comprises compression cylinder 42 within<br>
which piston 38 is disposed, dividing compression cylinder 42 into intake chamber<br>
40 and pressure chamber 46. Intake chamber 40 is further defined by end plate 41,<br>
which seals one end of compression cylinder 42. The opposite end of compression<br>
cylinder 42 is sealed by intermediate plate 96, which further defines pressure<br>
chamber 46. In a preferred arrangement, tie rods 102 are employed to hold<br>
compression cylinder 42 between end plate 41 and intermediate plate 96.<br>
Fluid may flow into intake chamber 40 through intake tube 34 and then<br>
through inlet check valve 36, which are both preferably associated with end plate<br>
41. Piston 38 is dynamically sealed against the interior walls of compression<br>
cylinder 42 as is known to those skilled in the art. Piston 38 is movable within<br>
compression cylinder 42 under the influence of a pump driver housed in driver<br>
section 20, which is linked to piston 38 by piston shaft 80. Seals between piston<br>
shaft 80 and intermediate plate 96 prevent fluid from escaping therebetween.<br>
Piston check valve 44 allows the one-way flow of fluid from intake chamber<br>
40 to pressure chamber 46. Pump discharge check valve 48 is disposed within a<br>
discharge passage leading from pressure chamber 46. Pump discharge check valve<br>
48 allows the one-way flow of fluid from pressure chamber 46 to accumulator coil<br>
24.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, at least a portion of the accumulator storage<br>
volume is defined by accumulator coil 24 which is a tube in the shape of a coil.<br>
Pressurized fluid received from the pump may be stored within the accumulator<br>
storage volume. As shown in the illustrated embodiments, accumulator coil 24 may<br>
be conveniently disposed around piston shaft 80. Accumulator 16 encloses accumulator <br>
coil 24 between intermediate plate 96 and boundary flange 63. At least one tie<br>
rod 104 parallel to piston shaft 80 may be employed to hold accumulator 16<br>
between intermediate plate 96 and boundary flange 63. An accumulator with a<br>
coiled storage volume, while only one possible embodiment, is advantageous as it<br>
adapts well to temperature and pressure changes within the system. However, any<br>
one of many alternate accumulator designs may be used. These include accumulator<br>
cylinders or other storage vessels.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the fluid flows from accumulator coil 24 to<br>
heater section 18 through fluid outlet 25. The accumulator is separated from heater<br>
section 18 by boundary flange 63 which is preferably made from a material selected<br>
to reduce heat transfer from heater section 18 to the accumulator. For example,<br>
boundary flange 63 may be made from G10 glass fibre composite, which has a<br>
thermal conductivity of about 2.1 W/m x K.<br>
Similarly, accumulator sleeve 84 extends from intermediate plate 96 through<br>
to boundary flange 63, housing the accumulator coil 24 and defining accumulator<br>
space 59 within the accumulator helping to prevent heat transfer from the heater<br>
section into the accumulator and the pump. Insulating material may be included in<br>
the accumulator space such as convection barriers for preventing convective heat<br>
flow through the accumulator, conductive thermal insulators, an evacuated space, or<br>
a combination of such thermal insulation measures.<br>
It is preferable for the fluid within the accumulator to be maintained at<br>
colder temperatures since wanning the pressurized fluid will decrease its density and<br>
may even cause it to be converted to a gas negating the benefits of storing the fluid<br>
where a fluid can be stored in a denser state compared to the same fluid stored in a<br>
gaseous phase. Accordingly, it is desirable to prevent heat from being transferred<br>
from heater section 18 to the accumulator to maximize the amount of fluid that can<br>
be stored in the accumulator.<br>
By way of example, in the case of natural gas, pressurized liquefied natural<br>
gas, depending upon the operational conditions, may be about three times denser<br>
than the same quantity of pressurized natural gas in a gaseous form. By maintaining<br>
a fluid within accumulator coil 24, each incremental increase in the accumulator coil<br>
volume in the accumulator corresponds to, utilizing the example above, an equivalent <br>
three fold increase in a corresponding volume of the same fluid in gaseous<br>
form. In other words, by placing the accumulator upstream of the heater and<br>
thermally isolated therefrom, a greater density can be stored per unit of accumulator<br>
volume. Utilizing the same example, an accumulator coil volume of approximately<br>
0.3 litres of natural gas equals approximately 0.90 litres of natural gas found in<br>
prior art accumulators designed to store fuel at pressures similar to the gas exiting<br>
apparatus 12 found in the described embodiment.<br>
Heater section 18 is described with reference to Figures 2 and 7. In a<br>
preferred arrangement, a heat exchanger is employed to transfer heat to the pressurized <br>
fluid from a heat exchange fluid housed in the heat exchanger that is capable of<br>
warming the pressurized fluid. The pressurized fluid flows sequentially from fluid<br>
outlet 25 through heater introduction tube 54, inner tubular coil 56, outer tubular<br>
coil 58, and then finally through delivery nozzle 68. The amount of heat transferred <br>
to the pressurized fluid is sufficient to convert the pressurized fluid to a gas.<br>
Introduction tube 54 and inner tubular coil 56 are disposed within inner heat<br>
bath channel 60 and outer tubular coil 58 is disposed within outer heat bath channel<br>
64. Inner channel 60 communicates with heat exchange fluid inlet 70 (shown in<br>
Figure 2). Channel passageway 72 allows a heat exchange fluid to flow from inner<br>
channel 60 to outer channel 64. Outer channel 64 communicates with heat exchange <br>
fluid outlet 76 (shown in Figure 2).<br>
Rod sleeve 85 extends from intermediate plate 96 through to drive head<br>
flange 82, preventing heat exchange fluid from leaking past the seals and bearings<br>
associated with piston shaft 80. Heater sleeve 19 extends between drive head flange<br>
82 and boundary flange 63, further defining outer channel 64.<br>
A feature of the illustrated preferred apparatus is that the pump, accumulator<br>
coil 24 and the heater are integrated in series. This is contrary to conventional<br>
systems which located an accumulator proximate to the end user and downstream<br>
from the heater. Another advantage is that the pump may be coupled directly to<br>
accumulator coil 24 which, in turn, may be directly coupled to the heater without<br>
the necessity of interconnecting piping and the additional joints associated therewith.<br>
The method of operating the apparatus is described below. In operation,<br>
piston 38 is at rest or being actuated in a retraction stroke or an extension stroke.<br>
The events occurring during a retraction stroke are described first.<br>
With reference to Figure 5, piston 38 has just completed a retraction stroke<br>
by moving in the direction of arrow 120 from a position proximate to end plate 41<br>
to a position proximate to intermediate plate 96. Inlet check valve 36 is opened and<br>
fluid has flowed into intake chamber 40 through intake tube 34. At the same time,<br>
fluid that was in pressure chamber 46 (shown in Figure 6), has been pressurized to<br>
a pressure that holds piston check valve 44 closed. The retraction of piston 38 has<br>
also caused the volume of pressure chamber 46 to be reduced whereby earlier in the<br>
retraction stroke, the fluid pressure within pressure chamber 46 was elevated to a<br>
pressure higher than the pressure of the pressurized fluid within accumulator coil<br>
24, causing pump discharge valve 48 to open, resulting in some of the pressurized<br>
fluid flowing from pressure chamber 46 to accumulator coil 24.<br>
Of course, as would be apparent to a person skilled in the art, it would be<br>
possible to feed fluid from pressure chamber 46 directly into accumulator coil 24<br>
without passing it first through a check valve, however, operation of the apparatus<br>
and gas delivery system as a whole is enhanced by including pump discharge check<br>
valve 48. Amongst other things, the inclusion of pump discharge check valve 48<br>
helps to reduce pressure variations downstream of the pump.<br>
The introduction of pressurized fluid into accumulator coil 24 from pressure<br>
chamber 46 displaces pressurized fluid already within accumulator coil 24 such that<br>
pressurized fluid flows through accumulator fluid outlet 25 and into heater section<br>
18 (see Figure 7).<br>
The operation of heater section 18 will be described with reference to Figure<br>
7. Pressurized fluid enters heater section 18 from accumulator fluid outlet 25<br>
through heater introduction tube 54. The pressurized fluid entering heater section<br>
18 may still be at a cryogenic temperature that may be lower than the freezing<br>
temperature of the heat exchange fluid. To reduce the likelihood of freezing the heat<br>
exchange fluid, heater introduction tube 54 directs the pressurized fluid to a location<br>
proximate to where the heat exchange fluid is first introduced into the heater. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment, heat exchange fluid is first introduced into inner heat bath<br>
channel 60 near drive head flange 82. Accordingly, the coldest part of inner coil 56<br>
is exposed to the warmest part of the heat bath.<br>
The heat exchange fluid flows through inner channel 60 and outer channel<br>
64 in the same general direction as the pressurized fluid flowing through inner<br>
tubular coil 56 and then outer tubular coil 58. Depending on the operating conditions <br>
for the particular application for which the apparatus is employed, and, in<br>
particular, the temperature of the pressurized fluid and the temperature of the heat<br>
exchange fluid, the length of the pressurized fluid coil within the heat bath is<br>
determined so that the pressurized fluid exits heater section 18 as a gas that has been<br>
heated to a temperature within a pre-determined temperature range. The gas will of<br>
course also be delivered from the apparatus at a temperature within a desired<br>
pre-determined pressure range.<br>
When the apparatus is employed to deliver a gaseous fuel to an engine, the<br>
engine coolant is an example of a suitable and convenient heat exchange fluid that<br>
may be delivered to the apparatus. In such an apparatus, engine coolant that has<br>
been heated after passing through the cooling jacket of the engine may be delivered<br>
to the heat bath in heater section 18 where it is cooled prior to being returned to the<br>
engine cooling system.<br>
A complete pump cycle includes a retraction stroke and an extension stroke.<br>
The extension stroke is described with reference to Figure 6, which depicts piston<br>
38 having just completed an extension stroke by moving in the direction of arrow<br>
122 from a position proximate to intermediate plate 96 to a position proximate to<br>
end plate 41.<br>
During the extension stroke, the movement of piston 38 in the direction of<br>
arrow 122 pressurizes the fluid within intake chamber 40 (shown in Figure 5)<br>
causing inlet check valve 36 to close and piston check valve 44 to open. The fluid<br>
pressurized within intake chamber 40 flows through open piston check valve 44 into<br>
pressure chamber 46. At the beginning of the extension stroke, the pressure within<br>
pressure chamber 46 is lower than the pressure of the fluid within accumulator coil<br>
24. Accordingly, pump discharge check valve 48 is held closed by the pressure<br>
differential. Later in the extension stroke, because the volume of intake chamber 40<br>
is much larger than the volume of pressure chamber 46, the transfer of the fluid into<br>
pressure chamber 46 causes the pressure therein to rise. Eventually, the pressure<br>
within pressure chamber 46 exceeds the pressure of the fluid within accumulator<br>
coil 24 and pump discharge check valve 48 opens to allow some of the fluid within<br>
pressure chamber 46 to flow into accumulator coil 24.<br>
In this manner, the pump operates as a double acting pump. In preferred<br>
arrangements, the displaceable volume of intake chamber 40 is sized at about two<br>
times larger than the displaceable volume of pressure chamber 46. Preferably, the<br>
quantity of fluid discharged from the pump is about equal for each extension and<br>
retraction stroke.<br>
The flow of the pressurized fluid through accumulator coil 24 and the<br>
operation of heater section 18 is essentially the same as described with respect to the<br>
retraction stroke and, as such, will not be repeated with respect to the extension<br>
stroke.<br>
As is well known in the art, the apparatus may be operated to maintain<br>
certain parameters such as, for example, the pressure within the accumulator, or the<br>
pressure and temperature of the fluid delivered from the apparatus. One or more<br>
sensors within the delivery system or apparatus 12, may be employed to cause a<br>
controller to activate the pump driver housed in the drive section. The pump<br>
driver, in turn, actuates piston shaft 80 to drive piston 38 according to the pump<br>
cycle described above. At times when demand is low, the controller may also cause<br>
pump piston 38 to remain at rest.<br>
In the preferred arrangement described above, the heater section employs a<br>
particular embodiment of a heat exchanger to transfer heat from a heat exchange<br>
fluid to the pressurized fluid. Of course, as would be apparent to a person skilled in<br>
the art, alternate variations of the heater found in the embodiment discussed above<br>
may be utilized. For example, instead of an inner and outer coil for conveying the<br>
pressurized fluid, a single coil may be employed. Other variations on the embodiment <br>
discussed include but are not limited to alternate configurations that utilize a<br>
warmed channel or set of channels through which the pressurized fluid is circulated,<br>
heated, and converted to a gas.<br>
More generally, however, conventional heaters may be housed in the heater<br>
section without affecting the spirit of the invention. As noted above, the benefits of<br>
the invention are realized where a heater functions within the apparatus in a space<br>
that allow for a maximization of the volume in the accumulator. Such heaters<br>
include elements for transferring heat to a fluid thus raising the temperature of the<br>
fluid to operational temperatures within a time frame to meet the operational<br>
parameters of the subject system. These conventional heaters may include electric<br>
heaters such as heaters employing a hot wire element, fins, plates and frames, and<br>
other devices well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Referring to the embodiment of the apparatus shown in figure 4, the<br>
apparatus in this operating environment draws in a low pressure fluid from tank<br>
assembly 31 and delivers the fluid in as a pressurized gas. Generally, a temperature<br>
gradient is introduced in such a system:<br>
along an axis running parallel to piston shaft 80; and,<br>
at right angles to piston shaft 80 varying along the length of the shaft from a<br>
maximum in parts of heater section 18 to a nominal gradient within the cold<br>
section and other upstream parts of accumulator 16.<br>
Maintaining the axial temperature gradient, that is, the temperature gradient<br>
parallel to the axis of piston shaft 80, is important because any heat leak into the<br>
accumulator coil from the heater decreases the density of this fluid and negates the<br>
advantages realized by providing the accumulator upstream of the heater where a<br>
cooler fluid environment exists. The axial temperature gradient may be maintained<br>
by providing barriers to thermal conductivity between the four sections of apparatus<br>
12. The embodiment shown provides boundary flange 63 and drive head flange 82.<br>
These flanges separate the accumulator shown as accumulator 16 and heater section<br>
18 and heater section 18 and drive section 20, respectively. As mentioned above,<br>
thermal separation between heater section 18 and accumulator coil 24 is particularly<br>
important.<br>
While these flanges help to thermally isolate these sections of the apparatus,<br>
the fluid flow through apparatus 12 also helps to transport heat away from cold end<br>
14 and in the direction of warmer heater section 18 and out of the system. Also,<br>
the use of accumulator coil 24 as opposed to another type of accumulator storage<br>
vessel, lengthens the conductive heat path from heater section 18 to cold end 14.<br>
Other heat paths through the accumulator include a convective heat path<br>
through the space surrounding accumulator coil 24. As mentioned above, insulating<br>
materials can be included within this accumulator space to help thermally isolate<br>
heater section 18 and the accumulator and cold end 14. Again barrier materials<br>
may also be used to reduce thermal convection resulting from circulating gases<br>
within this accumulator space. Alternatively, the accumulator space surrounding<br>
accumulator coil 24 may be evacuated.<br>
A further heat path from heater section 18 into the accumulator runs along<br>
accumulator sleeve 84. Suitable insulating materials known to persons skilled in the<br>
art may be employed to help with thermally isolating heater section 18 from<br>
accumulator 16 and cold end 14. In the illustrated embodiment, accumulator coil<br>
24 contains the pressurized fluid so accumulator sleeve 84 need not be designed to<br>
contain pressurized cryogenic fluids. Therefore, the selected material for sleeve 84<br>
may be chosen with priority to thermal conductivity properties rather than for<br>
structural characteristics.<br>
The transverse temperature gradient, that is, the temperature gradient<br>
generally perpendicular to piston shaft 80, is also a potential problem when positioning <br>
apparatus 12, for example, within tank assembly 31. Tank interior space 88<br>
is held at a much cooler temperature than that found within heater section 18. As<br>
the fluid is heated along its path through accumulator coil 24 and into inner and<br>
outer tubular coils (56, 58) in heater section 18, a transverse temperature gradient is<br>
established between the pressurized fluid and tank interior space 88. The transverse<br>
temperature gradient increases as the fluid flows into and through heater section 18<br>
where the fluid is eventually converted into a gas. Accumulator sleeve 84 and<br>
heater sleeve 19 are constructed of materials suitable to help insulate the apparatus<br>
from a tank interior. In this case, the sleeves acts to inhibit transverse heat flow<br>
from apparatus 12 through to any exterior environment.<br>
Referring to figures 1 and 2, in the illustrated embodiment, apparatus 12 is<br>
bound together by tie rods. As described above, cold end 14 and accumulator 16<br>
are joined together by compression cylinder tie rods 102, and accumulator tie rods<br>
104 run the length of accumulator 16 holding the accumulator between heater<br>
section 18 and cold end 14. While tie rods have been found to provide a cost and<br>
maintenance advantage, those skilled in the art will understand that the apparatus<br>
may also be bound by numerous other means. By way of example the heater,<br>
accumulator and pump may be integrated together by threaded connections, bolts,<br>
welded joints, or bound by any one or combination of a variety of known means for<br>
attaching one device to another to make an integrated apparatus.<br>
The materials utilized for accumulator coil 24, inner and outer tubular coils<br>
(56, 58) in heater section 18, cylinder 42, tie rods (102, 104), intake tube 34,<br>
accumulator sleeve 84, the boundary flange 63 and drive head flange 82 as well as<br>
other parts of the apparatus are chosen for, amongst other things, their capacity to<br>
react to temperature gradients, withstand high pressures and insulate against heat<br>
conduction. Such materials are known to persons skilled in the art.<br>
While the embodiment discussed considers a single piston pump with two<br>
chambers, namely intake chamber 40 and pressure chamber 46, other pump<br>
arrangements may be employed to pressurize the fluid drawn from a vessel to<br>
higher pressures. For example, it is understood that a piston pump with more than<br>
one piston or a different number of chambers may be substituted for the illustrated<br>
embodiment.<br>
By way of example, the description discloses an apparatus that may be<br>
employed to deliver a high pressure gas utilizing the properties of the gas in a<br>
denser state to enhance the effective accumulator capacity and more easily pressurize <br>
the gas. It is understood, however, that these properties are realized in a general<br>
sense when the apparatus:<br>
draws in a fluid at an initial temperature, T1, and an initial pressure, P1;<br>
• raises the pressure of that fluid to P2, a pressure falling within a predetermined <br>
pressure range, where P2&gt;P1;<br>
• stores the fluid in an accumulator at a pressure within the predetermined<br>
pressure range, approximately P2;<br>
• warms the fluid in a heater to temperature T2, which falls within a predetermined <br>
temperature range that converts the fluid to a gas, where T2&gt; T1; and,<br>
• delivers the gas at a temperature and pressure within the predetermined<br>
temperature and pressure ranges, approximately T2 and P2.<br>
As such, it is understood that the fluid will be drawn in as a fluid and<br>
delivered as a gas with a higher temperature and pressure relative to the initial<br>
temperature and pressure. In a preferred embodiment, a liquid may be drawn into<br>
the apparatus and a gas delivered from the apparatus. However, depending on the<br>
operational conditions of the stored fluid and the desired properties of the gas to be<br>
delivered, a liquid or supercritical fluid or a single phase fluid may be drawn in and<br>
a gas at or above the supercritical point may be delivered. Such a gas may be<br>
thought of as a supercritical fluid or single phase fluid as well. The invention<br>
contemplates such states for the delivered gas and stored fluid.<br>
Therefore, as noted previously,"fluids", as understood in this application,<br>
are liquids, and liquids under supercritical pressures. "Gases", as understood in this<br>
application, are gases and gases under supercritical pressures. These terms are<br>
mutually exclusive. Further, while the embodiment shown includes a hydraulic<br>
pump driver within drive section 16, numerous other drivers will suffice without<br>
departing significantly from the spirit of the invention as will be apparent to a<br>
person skilled in the art. By way of example, these may include electric motors,<br>
mechanical or engine drivers, pneumatic drivers, and so forth. The driver is a<br>
potential heat source so it is preferably disposed away from the colder pump and<br>
accumulator to reduce heat transfer to the stored cold fluid. The illustrated embodiment <br>
positions the heater and / or accumulator between the pump and the driver to<br>
assist with managing the axial temperature gradient within apparatus 12 while<br>
allowing direct fluid connections between the pump, the accumulator and the heater,<br>
thereby eliminating the need for piping between these components and reducing the<br>
number of connections which might be a source of leaks and / or failure points.<br>
The illustrated embodiment also provides a convenient arrangement for locating<br>
piston shaft 80.<br>
By way of example but in no way limiting the scope of the disclosed<br>
invention, the following system characteristics and pre-determined parameters of a<br>
particular embodiment have been set out below for an apparatus that would be<br>
appropriate for delivering a combustible gas (e.g., natural gas, methane, propane,<br>
ethane, gaseous combustible hydrocarbon derivatives such as methanol or ethanol,<br>
hydrogen) or a combustion supporting gas (e.g., oxygen) to a combustion engine.<br>
The following is designed in regards to the apparatus receiving liquefied natural gas<br>
and delivering high pressure natural gas to an engine:<br>
Fuel storage temperature: 
Accumulator operational pressure: 5000-5600 psig<br>
Operational heat bath temperature: 283 - 343 K<br>
Inner &amp; outer coil volume: 1.65 x 105 mm3<br>
Inner coil internal tube diameter: 3.86 mm<br>
Outer coil internal tube diameter: 3.86 mm<br>
Accumulator coil volume: 3.32 x 105 mm3<br>

Pressure chamber vol. (extended): 3.74 x 105 mm3<br>
Pressure chamber vol. (retracted): 3.44 x 105 mm3<br>
As will be apparent to those skilled in the art in the light of the foregoing<br>
disclosure, many alterations and modifications are possible in the practice of this<br>
invention without departing from the spirit or scope thereof. Accordingly, the<br>
scope of the invention is to be construed in accordance with the substance defined<br>
