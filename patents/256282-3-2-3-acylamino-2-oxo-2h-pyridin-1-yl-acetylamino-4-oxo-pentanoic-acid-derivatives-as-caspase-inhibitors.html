Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] This invention is in the field of medicinal<br>
chemistry and relates to compounds, and pharmaceutical<br>
compositions thereof, that inhibit caspases that mediate cell<br>
apoptosis and inflammation. The invention also relates to<br>
processes for preparing these compounds. The invention<br>
further relates to methods of using the compounds and<br>
pharmaceutical compositions of this invention to treat<br>
diseases where caspase activity is implicated.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a principal<br>
mechanism by which organisms eliminate unwanted cells. The<br>
deregulation of apoptosis, either excessive apoptosis or the<br>
failure to undergo it, has been implicated in a number of<br>
diseases such as cancer, acute inflammatory and autoimmune<br>
disorders, ischemic diseases and certain neurodegenerative<br>
disorders (see generally Science, 1998, 281, 1283-1312; Ellis<br>
et al., Ann. Rev. Cell. Biol., 1991, 7, 663).<br>
[0003] Caspases are a family of cysteine protease enzymes<br>
that are key mediators in the signaling pathways for<br>
apoptosis and cell disassembly (Thornberry, Chem. Biol.,<br>
1998, 5, R97-R103) . These signaling pathways vary depending<br><br>
on cell type and stimulus, but all apoptosis pathways appear<br>
to converge at a common effector pathway leading to<br>
proteolysis of key proteins. Caspases are involved in both<br>
the effector phase of the signaling pathway and further<br>
upstream at its initiation. The upstream caspases involved<br>
in initiation events become activated and in turn activate<br>
other caspases that are involved in the later phases of<br>
apoptosis.<br>
[0004] Caspase-1, the first identified caspase, is also<br>
known as interleukin converting enzyme or "ICE. Caspase-1<br>
converts precursor interleukin-10 ("plL-iP") to the<br>
pro-inflammatory active form by specific cleavage of pIL-1β<br>
between Asp-116 and Ala-117. Besides caspase-1 there are<br>
also eleven other known human caspases, all of which cleave<br>
specifically at aspartyl residues. They are also observed to<br>
nave stringent requirements for at least four amino acid<br>
residues on the N-terminal side of the cleavage site.<br>
[0005] The caspases have been classified into three groups<br>
depending on the amino acid sequence that is preferred or<br>
primarily recognized. The group of caspases, which includes<br>
caspases 1, 4, 5 and 13, have been shown to prefer<br>
hydrophobic aromatic amino acids at position 4 on the N-<br>
terminal side of the cleavage site. Another group which<br>
includes caspases 2, 3 and 7, recognize aspartyl residues at<br>
both positions 1 and 4 on the N-terminal side of the cleavage<br>
site, and preferably a sequence of Asp-Glu-X-Asp. A third<br>
group, which includes caspases 6, 8, 9 and 10, tolerate many<br>
amino acids in the primary recognition sequence, but seem to<br>
prefer residues with branched, aliphatic side chains such as<br>
valine and leucine at position 4.<br>
[0006] The caspases have also been grouped according to<br>
their perceived function. The first subfamily consists of<br><br>
caspases-1 (ICE), 4, 5 and 13. These caspases have been<br>
shown to be involved in pro-inflammatory cytokine processing<br>
and therefore play an important role in inflammation.<br>
Caspase-1, the most studied enzyme of this class, activates<br>
the IL-1β precursor by proteolytic cleavage. This enzyme<br>
therefore plays a key role in the inflammatory response.<br>
Caspase-1 is also involved in the processing of interferon-y<br>
inducing factor (IGIF, also known as IL-18) which stimulates<br>
the production of interferon gamma, a key immunoregulator<br>
that modulates antigen presentation, T-cell activation and<br>
cell adhesion.<br>
[0007] The remaining caspases make up the second and third<br>
subfamilies. These enzymes are of central importance in the<br>
intracellular signaling pathways leading to apoptosis. One<br>
subfamily consists of the enzymes involved in initiating<br>
events in the apoptotic pathway, including transduction of<br>
signals from the plasma membrane. Members of this subfamily<br>
include caspases-2, 8, 9 and 10. The other subfamily,<br>
consisting of the effector capsases 3, 6 and 7, are involved<br>
in the final downstream cleavage events that result in the<br>
systematic breakdown and death of the cell by apoptosis.<br>
Caspases involved in the upstream signal transduction<br>
activate the downstream caspases, which then disable UNA<br>
repair mechanisms, fragment BNA, dismantle the cell<br>
cytoskeleton and finally fragment the cell.<br>
£0008] Knowledge of the four amino acid sequence primarily<br>
recognized by the caspases has been used to design caspase<br>
inhibitors. Reversible tetrapeptide inhibitors have been<br>
prepared having the structure<br>
CH3CO-[P4]-[P3]-[P2]-CH{R)CH2CO2H where P2 to P4 represent an<br>
optimal amino acid recognition sequence and R is an aldehyde,<br>
nitrile or ketone capable of binding to the caspase cysteine<br><br>
sulfhydryl. Rano and Thornberry, Chem. Biol. 4, 149-155<br>
(1997); Mjalli, et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 3, 2689-2692<br>
(1993); Nicholson et al., Nature 376, 37-43 (1995).<br>
Irreversible inhibitors based on the analogous tetrapeptide<br>
recognition sequence have been prepared.<br>
[0009] The utility of caspase inhibitors to treat a<br>
variety of mammalian disease states associated with an<br>
increase in cellular apoptosis has been demonstrated using<br>
peptidic caspase inhibitors. For example, in rodent models<br>
caspase inhibitors have been shown to reduce infarct size and<br>
inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis after myocardial infarction,<br>
to reduce lesion volume and neurological deficit resulting<br>
from stroke, to reduce post-traumatic apoptosis and<br>
neurological deficit in traumatic brain injury, to be<br>
effective in treating fulminant liver destruction, and to<br>
improved survival after endotoxic shock. Yaoita et al.,<br>
Circulation, 97, 276 (1998); Endres et al., J Cerebral Blood<br>
Flow and Metabolism, 18, 238, (1998); Cheng et al., J". Clin.<br>
Invest., 101, 1992 (1998); Yakovlev et al., J" Neuroscience,<br>
17, 7415 (1997); Rodriguez et al., J. Exp. Med., 184, 2067<br>
(1996); Grobmyer et al., Mol. Med., 5, 585 (1999).<br>
[0010] In general, the peptidic inhibitors described above<br>
are very potent against some of the caspase enzymes.<br>
However, this potency has not always been reflected in<br>
cellular models of apoptosis. In addition peptide inhibitors<br>
are typically characterized by undesirable pharmacological<br>
properties such as poor oral absorption, poor stability and<br>
rapid metabolism. Plattner and Norbeck, in Drug Discovery-<br>
Technologies, Clark and Moos, Eds. (Ellis Horwood,<br>
Chichester, England, 1990).<br>
[0011] Recognizing the need to improve the pharmacological<br>
properties of the peptidic caspase inhibitors, peptidomimetic<br>
inhibitors have been reported. Amongst these, inhibitors<br><br>
where the P3 amino acid has been replaced by derivatives of<br>
3-aminopyridin-2-ones and 5-aminopyrimidin-4-ones have been<br>
reported (U.S. Patent 5,756,466 (Bemis et al.); PCT<br>
Publication No. WO 95/35308 (Bemis et al.); Dolle et al. J.<br>
Med. Chem. 39, 2438, (1996); Golec et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem.<br>
Lett. 7, 2181, (1997); Semple et al, Biorg. Med. Chem. Lett.<br>
7, 1337, (1997)).<br>
[0012] Due to the inherent problems of the peptidic<br>
inhibitors, there continues to be a need for small molecule,<br>
nonpeptide caspase inhibitors that are potent, stable, and<br>
penetrate membranes to provide effective inhibition of<br>
apoptosis in vivo. Such compounds would be extremely useful<br>
in treating the aforementioned diseases where caspase enzymes<br>
play a role.<br>

aliphatic, aryl, cycloaliphatic, heteroaryl, and heterocyclyl<br>
may contain appropriate substituents (preferably up to 5,<br>
more preferable up to 3, and even more preferably, 0 or 1)<br>
independently selected from, for example, carbonyl and R.<br>
Preferred substituents (including R and «T2) are halogen, -OR7,<br>

this definition would include a perfluorinated alkyl group.<br>
[0052] In embodiments of this invention where R is a<br>

[0055] Any of the embodiments disclosed herein may be<br>

invention. Specific embodiments of this invention may be<br>

[0059] According to a more preferred embodiment, this<br>

Table 1 below:<br><br>
Table 1. Compounds of the invention.<br>
In the table below, the following definitions are used:<br>
*Ph" is phenyl, "En" is benzyl [-CH2-Ph], ~Et" is ethyl<br>
[-CH2-CH3] , and "I-Pr" is isopropyl [-CH(CH3)2] -<br><br><br><br>
[0060] According to another embodiment, the present<br>
invention provides a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising:<br><br>
a)	a compound of formula I, as defined herein, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and<br>
b)	a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant<br>
or vehicle.<br>
[0061] it will be apparent to one skilled in the art<br>
that certain compounds of this invention may exist in<br>
tautomeric forms or hydra ted forms, all such forms of the<br>
compounds being within the scope of the invention.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are<br>
also meant to include all stereochemical forms of the<br>
structure; i.e., the R and S configurations for each<br>
asymmetric center. Therefore, single stereochemical<br>
isomers as well as enantiomeric and diastereomeric<br>
mixtures of the present compounds are within the scope of<br>
the invention. Unless otherwise stated, structures<br>
depicted herein are also meant to include compounds that<br>
differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically<br>
enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the<br>
present structures except for the replacement of a<br>
hydrogen by a deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of<br>
a carbon by a 13C- or 14C-enriched carbon are within the<br>
scope of this invention.<br>
[0062] The compounds of this invention may be prepared<br>
in general by methods known to those skilled in the art<br>
for analogous compounds and by the preparative examples<br>
that follow, /see, for example, WO 2004/106304, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. yFor the purposes of<br>
illustration, the following Schemes I-III for the<br>
synthesis of the compounds of the present invention are<br>
provided. It should be understood that any protective<br>
group depicted in the schemes may be varied as<br><br>
appropriate in view of compatibility with other<br>
substituents.<br>
[0063] Various protecting groups may be used in the<br>
methods of this invention (see, e.g., T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M<br>
Wutz, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", 3rd<br>
Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (1999) and the earlier<br>
editions of this book). Typical functional groups that<br>
must be protected are amines. Any amines and other<br>
functional groups may be protected according to methods<br>
known in the art. Compounds, including amines, may be<br>
used with or without isolation from the reaction<br>
mixtures.<br><br>
Scheme I (a) EDC/DMAP/HOBt/THF; (b) Dess-Martin<br>
periodinane; (c) TFA/DCM<br>
[0064] In Scheme I above, the following abbreviations<br>
are used: EDC is 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-<br>
ethylcarbodiimide; HOBt is 1-hydroxybenzotriazole; THF is<br>
tetrahydrofuran; TFA is trifluoroacetic acid; DCM is<br><br>
dichloromethane; DMAP is 4-dimethylaminopyridine. Acid 1<br>
is coupled to amino alcohol 2. Here the coupling is<br>
depicted using EDC/DMAP/HOBt/THF, however, other suitable<br>
conditions may also be tised. Depending on the nature of<br>
R4 and R5 an amino ketone may be used, in place of the<br>
amino alcohol, thus avoiding the subsequent oxidation<br>
step. In the case of fluoromethyl ketones where R5 is<br>
CH2F, the amino alcohol 2 may be obtained according to the<br>
method of Revesz efc al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1994, 35,<br>
9693. In the case of tetrafluorophenoxy ketones where R5<br>
is -CH2O-2,3,5, 6-tetraf luorophenyl, amino alcohol 2 may be<br>
obtained by methods analogous to those of Semple et al.,<br>
Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 1997, 7, 1337<br>
(Scheme II).<br>
[0065] Finally the hydroxy group in compound 3 is<br>
oxidized (e.g., with Dess-Martin periodinane) and the<br>
resulting compound treated appropriately according to the<br>
nature of R4. For example, in product I if R4 is a<br>
carboxylic acid, then R4 in 3 is preferably an ester that<br>
is hydrolyzed in the final step of the scheme. If that<br>
ester is a t-butyl ester (i.e., if R4 is CC^tBu),<br>
treatment with trifluoroacetic acid will give the acid.<br>
The ester is preferably a t-butyl ester when the other<br>
substituents in I are compatible with acidic conditions.<br>
[0066] If R4 in product I is an ester, the desired<br>
ester may be prepared by esterifying the corresponding<br>
acid or by having the desired ester group already present<br>
in compound 2.<br><br><br>
Scheme II (a)KF/DMF/ArOH; (b) NaBRj/THF; (c) H2/Pd/C/MeOH<br>
[0067] In scheme II above, the following abreviations<br>
are used: KF is potassium fluoride; DMF is N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide; ArOH is 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenol; THF<br>
is tetahydrofuran; MeOH is methanol. Commercially<br>
available bromoketone 4 (R4=CO2tBu) is reacted with<br>
2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenol and potassium fluoride to give<br>
phenoxy ketone 5. The ketone is then reduced with a<br>
suitable reducing agent, for example, sodium borohydride,<br>
to give the alcohol 6, which is hydrogenated by using<br>
hydrogen gas and a suitable catalyst, for example,<br>
palladium on carbon, to give the amino alcohol 2 (R4=<br>
CO2tBu, RS= CH2O-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl).<br><br><br>
Scheme III (a)H2 Pd/C MeOH; (b) R^-Cl, Na2CO3, H20/THF;<br>
(c) (CF3SO2)20/ 2,6-Lutidine, DCM; (d) NaH, THF; (e)<br>
TFA/DCM; (f) R^Cl, Et3Nr DMAP, DCM;<br>
[0068] In Scheme III the folowing abreviatons are<br>
used: Cbz is a benzyloxycarbonyl protecting group; MeOH<br>
is methanol; DCM is dichloromethane; TPA is<br>
trifluoroacetic acid; DMAP is 4-dimethylaminopyridine;<br>
THF is tetrahydrofuran. Pyridone acid derivatives 1 can<br>
be prepared in chiral form using the synthetic sequence<br>
shown in Scheme III. Commercially available<br>
nitropyridone is reduced to the amine with hydrogen and<br>
palladium/carbon. The amino group is then functionalised<br>
with the appropriate electrophile: in the case of Rl=Cbz<br>
the benzyloxycarbonyl protected amine is prepared using a<br>
procedure similar to that described by Warner et al J".<br>
Med. Chem. 1994, 37(19), 309O-3099. For the other cases<br>
the amine is derivatised using standard methods.<br>
(R)-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy ester is treated with<br>
trif luoromethanesulphonic anhydride and 2, 6-lutidine in<br>
DCM to give the corresponding trif late. Reaction of the<br><br>
triflate with the anion of the ftuictionalized 2-<br>
hydroxypyridine (prepared by deprotonation with sodium<br>
hydride in THF) gives the N-alkylated pyridone. When R1<br>
is a benzyloxycarbonyl protecting group it can be removed<br>
at this stage using hydrogen and palladium on carbon to<br>
give the amine; this is then reacted with an appropriate<br>
electrophile, triethylamine and DMAP in DCM. For example<br>
if R1 is required to be R6C=0 (an amide) then an<br>
appropriately substituted acid chloride may be used. If<br>
R1 is required to be R6S{=0)2 (sulphonamide) then an<br>
appropriately substituted sulfonyl chloride may be used.<br>
If R1 is (R6)2N(C=0) (urea) then an appropriately<br>
substituted carbamoyl chloride or isocyanate may be used.<br>
The other R1 groups may be prepared accordingly. Acid 1<br>
is then prepared by deprotection of the ester by, for<br>
example, using trifluoroacetic acid. The acid is then<br>
coupled to amino alcohol 2 (Scheme 1).<br><br>
Scheme IV (a) NaOMe, MeOH; (b) LiOH/H20/dioxane; (c)DPPA,<br>
TEA, BnOH, dioxane; (d)H2 Pd/C MeOH; (e) R^Cl, EtaN,<br>
DMAP, DCM; (f) TFA/DCM;<br>
In Scheme IV the folowing abreviations are used: MeOH is<br>
methanol; DPPA is diphenylphosporyl azide; BnOH is benzyl<br><br>
alcohol; TEA is triethylamine; DCM is dichloromethane;<br>
TFA is trifluoroacetic acid; THF is tetrahydrofuran;<br>
Pyridone acids derivatives 1 can be prepared in chiral<br>
form using an alternative route, depicted in Scheme TV.<br>
Reaction of 2-(3-Methoxy-allylidene)-malonic acid<br>
dimethyl ester and aminoacid fcerfc-butyl esters in the<br>
presence of methoxide gives the cyclised pyridone<br>
product. Hydrolysis of the methyl ester into the acid,<br>
followed by treatment of the acid under Curtius<br>
rearrangement conditions in the presence of benzyl<br>
alcohol give the benzyloxycarbonyl protected<br>
aminopyridone. The benzyloxycarbonyl protecting group is<br>
removed under hydrogenolysis conditions and the resulting<br>
amine is then reacted with an appropriate electrophile,<br>
triethylamine and DMAP in DCM. For example if R1 is<br>
required to be R6C=0 (an amide) then an appropriately<br>
substituted acid chloride may be used. If R1 is required<br>
to be R6S(=0)2 (sulphonamide) then an appropriately<br>
substituted sulfonyl chloride may be used. If R1 is<br>
(R6)2N(C=0) (urea) then an appropriately substituted<br>
carbamoyl chloride or isocyanate may be used. The other<br>
R1 groups may be prepared accordingly. Acid 1 is then<br>
prepared by deprotection of the ester by, for example,<br>
using trifluoroacetic acid. The acid is then coupled to<br>
amino alcohol 2 (Scheme 1) .<br>

is t-butyl, then preferred deprotecting conditions would<br>
include acid hydrolysis. A preferred acid is TFA. A<br>

[0081] Another embodiment of this invention provides a<br>
process for preparing a compound of formula (I):<br><br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5, are as defined in any of<br>
the embodiments herein, comprising:<br>

R2, R3, and R6 are as defined herein;<br>
with a compound of formula (X) :<br><br>
wherein Y is either a carbonyl group or an OH group; and<br>

R^OCfOWH)-, (R^aNCtONdJ)-, R^CIOJCIONIH)-,<br>
(R^hNCCOJCfOWH)-, or R^OC(O) C (O)N(H) -.<br>
[0082] If pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the<br>
compounds of this invention are utilized in these<br>
compositions, those salts are preferably derived from<br>
inorganic or organic acids and bases. Included among<br>
such acid salts are the following: acetate, adipate,<br>
alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzene sulfonate,<br>
bisulfate, butyrate, citrate, camphorate, camphor<br>
sulfonate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate,<br>
dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, fumarate,<br>
glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate,<br>
heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide,<br>
hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate,<br>
methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate,<br>
oxalate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenyl-<br>
propionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate,<br>
tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate and undecanoate. Base<br>
salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts, such as<br>
sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts,<br>
such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic<br>
bases, such as dicyclohexylamine salts,<br>
N-methyl-D-glucamine, and salts with amino acids such as<br>
arginine, lysine, and so forth.<br>
[0083] Also, the basic nitrogen-containing groups can<br>
be quaternized with such agents as lower alkyl halides,<br>
such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chloride,<br>
bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates, such as dimethyl,<br>
diethyl, dibutyl and diamyl sulfates, long chain halides<br>
such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides,<br>
bromides and iodides, aralkyl halides, such as benzyl and<br>
phenethyl bromides and others. Water or oil-soluble or<br>
dispersible products are thereby obtained.<br><br>
[0084] The compounds of this invention may also be<br>
modified by appending appropriate functionalities to<br>
enhance selective biological properties. Such<br>
modifications are known in the art and include those<br>
which increase biological penetration into a given<br>
biological system (e.g., blood, lymphatic system, central<br>
nervous system), increase oral availability, increase<br>
solubility to allow administration by injection, alter<br>
metabolism and alter rate of excretion.<br>
[0085] For example, a. carboxylic acid group in a<br>
compound of this invention may be derivatized as, for<br>
example, an ester. Preferred esters would be those<br>
derived from:<br>
a Ci_6 straight-chained or branched alkyl,<br>
alkenyl, or alkynyl, wherein the alkyl, alkenyl, or<br>
alkynyl is optionally substituted with aryl, CP3/ Cl, F,<br>
OMe, OEt, OCF3, CN, or NMe2;<br>
a Ci_6 cycloalkyl, wherein 1-2 carbon atoms in<br>
the cycloalkyl is optionally replaced with -O- or -NR9-.<br>
[0086] Compounds of this invention having a carbonyl<br>
group may be similarly derivatized as, e.g., an acetal,<br>
ketal, oxime (=NOR9), hydrazine (=NN(R9)2&gt;, thioacetal, or<br>
thioketal.<br>
[0087] Appropriate derivatives of amines are known in<br>
the art and are also included within the scope of this<br>
invention.<br>
[0088] Certain of the above derivatives would include<br>
the protective groups known to skilled practitioners<br>
(see, e.g., T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M Wutz, "Protective Groups<br>
in Organic Synthesis", 3rd Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
Inc. (1999)). Typical functional groups that must be<br>
protected are amines. Any amines and other functional<br>
groups may be protected according to methods known in the<br><br>
art. Compounds, including amines, may be used with or<br>
without isolation from the reaction mixtures. As would<br>
be recognized by a skilled practitioner, these protective<br>
groups may also be employed in the processes of this<br>
invention.<br>
[0089] Without being bound by theory, applicants'<br>
cyclic acetal compounds are believed to be prodrugs.<br>
That is, the acetal portion is cleaved in vivo to provide<br>
a corresponding acid-aldehyde compound. As would be<br>
recognized by a skilled practitioner," chemical compounds<br>
may be metabolized in vivo, e.g., at a site other than<br>
the prodrug cleavage site. Any such metabolites are<br>
included within the scope of this invention.<br>
[0090] The compounds of this invention may be assayed<br>
for their ability to inhibit apoptosis, the release of<br>
IL-lp or caspase activity directly. Assays for each of<br>
the activities are known in the art. However, as would<br>
be recognized by a skilled practitioner, a prodrug<br>
compound of this invention should be active only in<br>
assays where the prodrug moiety would be cleaved,<br>
typically in in vivo assays. Selected assays are<br>
described below.<br>
[0091] Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers that may<br>
be used in these compositions include, but are not<br>
limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate,<br>
lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin,<br>
buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic<br>
acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of<br>
saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or<br>
electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium<br>
hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium<br>
chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium<br><br>
trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based<br>
substances, polyethylene glycol, sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates, waxes,<br>
polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-blocJc polymers,<br>
polyethylene glycol and wool fat.<br>
[0092] According to a preferred embodiment, the<br>
compositions of this invention are formulated for<br>
pharmaceutical administration to a mammal, preferably a<br>
human being.<br>
[0093] Such pharmaceutical compositions of the present<br>
invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by<br>
inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally,<br>
vaginally or via an implanted reservoir. The term<br>
"parenteral* as used herein includes subcutaneous,<br>
intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular,<br>
intra-synovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intrahepatic,<br>
intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion<br>
techniques. Preferably., the compositions are<br>
administered orally or intravenously.<br>
[0094] Sterile injectable forms of the compositions of<br>
this invention may be aqueous or oleaginous suspension.<br>
These suspensions may be formulated according to<br>
techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or<br>
wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile<br>
injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable<br>
solution or suspension in a non-toxic<br>
parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example<br>
as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable<br>
vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water.<br>
Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution.<br>
In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally<br>
employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this<br>
purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including<br><br>
synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. Fatty acids, such as<br>
oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in<br>
the preparation of injectables, as are natural<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or<br>
castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated<br>
versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also<br>
contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, such<br>
as carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents<br>
which are commonly used in the formulation of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms including<br>
emulsions and suspensions. Other commonly used<br>
surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and other emulsifying<br>
agents or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly<br>
used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
solid, liquid, or other dosage forms may also be used for<br>
the purposes of formulation.<br>
[0095] The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may be orally administered in any orally<br>
acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to,<br>
capsules, tablets, aqueous suspensions or solutions. In<br>
the case of tablets for oral use, carriers which are<br>
commonly used include lactose and corn starch.<br>
Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also<br>
typically added. For oral administration in a capsule<br>
form, useful diluents include lactose and dried corn<br>
starch. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral<br>
use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying<br>
and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening,<br>
flavoring or coloring agents may also be added.<br>
[0096] Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
of this invention may be administered in the form of<br>
suppositories for rectal administration. These can be<br>
prepared by mixing the agent with a suitable<br><br>
non-irritating excipient which is solid at room<br>
temperature but liquid at rectal temperature and<br>
therefore will melt in the rectum to release the drug.<br>
Such materials include cocoa butter, beeswax and<br>
polyethylene glycols.<br>
[0097] The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may also be administered topically, especially<br>
when the target of treatment includes areas or organs<br>
readily accessible by topical application, including<br>
diseases of the eye, the skin, or the lower intestinal<br>
tract. Suitable topical formulations are readily<br>
prepared for each of these areas or organs.<br>
[0098] Topical application for the lower intestinal<br>
tract can be effected in a rectal suppository formulation<br>
(see above) or in a suitable enema formulation.<br>
Topically-transdermal patches may also be used.<br>
[0099] For topical applications, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions may be formulated in a suitable ointment<br>
containing the active component suspended or dissolved in<br>
one or more carriers. Carriers for topical<br>
administration of the compounds of this invention<br>
include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid<br>
petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol,<br>
polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying<br>
wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions can be formulated in a suitable lotion or<br>
cream containing the active components suspended or<br>
dissolved in one or more pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited<br>
to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60,<br>
cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol,<br>
benzyl alcohol and water.<br><br>
[0100] For ophthalmic use, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions may be formulated as micronized suspensions<br>
in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably,<br>
as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline,<br>
either with our without a preservative such as<br>
benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, for ophthalmic<br>
uses, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated<br>
in an ointment such as petrolatum.<br>
[0101] The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may also be administered by nasal aerosol or<br>
inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to<br>
techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical<br>
formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline,<br>
employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives,<br>
absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability,<br>
fluorocarbons, and/or other conventional solubilizing or<br>
dispersing agents.<br>
[0102] The above-described compositions are<br>
particularly useful in therapeutic applications relating<br>
to an IL-1 mediated disease, an apoptosis mediated<br>
disease, an inflammatory disease, an autoimmune disease,<br>
a destructive bone disorder, a proliferative disorder, an<br>
infectious disease, a degenerative disease, a disease<br>
associated with cell death, or various forms of liver<br>
disease. Such diseases include those related to<br>
rheumatology and autoimmunity, such as rheumatoid<br>

treating complications associated with coronary artery<br>
bypass grafts. The amount of compound present in the<br>
above-described compositions should be sufficient to<br>
cause a detectable decrease din the severity of the<br>
disease or in caspase activity and/or cell apoptosis, as<br>
measured by any of the assays known in the art.<br><br>
[0103] According to another embodiment, the<br>
compositions of this invention may further comprise<br>
another therapeutic agent. Such agents include, but are<br>
not limited to, thrombolytic agents such as tissue<br>
plasminogen activator and streptokinase. When a second<br>
agent is used, the second agent may be administered<br>
either as a separate dosage form or as part of a single<br>
dosage form with the compounds or compositions of this<br>
invention. Accordingly, a combined preparation for<br>
simultaneous, separate, or sequential use is provided by<br>
this invention.<br>
[0104] Dosage levels of between about 0.01 and about<br>
100 mg/kg body weight per day, preferably between about<br>
0.5 and about 75 mg/kg body weight per day of the<br>
protease inhibitor compounds described herein are useful<br>
in a monotherapy for the prevention and treatment of a<br>
disease involving caspase activity and/or apoptosis.<br>
[0105] Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions of<br>
this invention will be administered from about 1 to about<br>
5 times per day or alternatively, as a continuous<br>
infusion. Such administration can be used as a chronic<br>
or acute therapy. The amount of active ingredient that<br>
may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a<br>
single dosage form will vary depending upon the host<br>
treated and the particular mode of administration. A<br>
typical preparation will contain from about 5% to about<br>
95% active compound (w/w) . Preferably, such preparations<br>
contain from about 20% to about 80% active compound.<br>
[0106] When the compositions of this invention<br>
comprise a combination of a compound of formula I and one<br>
or more additional therapeutic or prophylactic agents,<br>
both the compound and the additional agent should be<br>
present at dosage levels of between about 10 to 100%, and<br><br>
more preferably between about 10 to 80% of the dosage<br>
normally administered in a monotherapy regimen.<br>
[0107] It should also be understood that a specific<br>
dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient<br>
will depend upon a variety of factors, including the<br>
activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body<br>
weight, general health, sex, diet, time of<br>
administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and<br>
the judgment of the treating physician and the severity<br>
of the particular disease being treated. The amount of<br>
active ingredients will also depend upon the particular<br>
compound and other therapeutic agent, if present, in the<br>
composition.<br>
[0108] In a preferred embodiment, the invention<br>
provides a method of treating a mammal, having one of the<br>
aforementioned diseases, comprising the step of<br>
administering to said mammal a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable composition described above. In this<br>
embodiment, if the patient is also administered another<br>
therapeutic agent or caspase inhibitor, it may be<br>
delivered together with the compound of this invention in<br>
a single dosage form, or, as a separate dosage form.<br>
When administered as a separate dosage form, the other<br>
caspase inhibitor or agent may be administered prior to,<br>
at the same time as, or following administration of a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a<br>
compound of this invention.<br>
[0109] In order that this invention be more fully<br>
understood, the following preparative and testing<br>
examples are set forth. These examples are for the<br>
purpose of illustration only and are not to be construed<br>
as limiting the scope of the invention in any way. ^-NMR<br><br>
spectra were recorded at 400 MHz using a Bruker DPX 400<br>
instrument. Mass spec, samples were analyzed on a<br>

Enzyme Assays<br>
[0142] The assays for caspase inhibition are based on<br>
the cleavage of a fluorogenic substrate by recombinant,<br>
purified human Caspases -1, -3, or -8. The assays are<br>
run in essentially the same way as those reported by<br>
Garcia-Calvo et al. («T. Biol. Chem. 273 (1998), 32608-<br>
32613) , using a substrate specific for each enzyme. The<br>
substrate for Caspase-1 is Acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-amino-<br>
4-methylcoumarin. The substrate for Caspases -3 and -8<br>
is Acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-amino-4-methylcoumarin. Both<br>
substrates are known in the art.<br><br>
[0143] The observed rate of enzyme inactivation at a<br>
particular inhibitor concentration, kobs/ is computed by<br>
direct fits of the data to the equation derived by<br>
Thornberry et al. (Biochemistry 33 (1994),. 3943-3939)<br>
using a nonlinear least-squares analysis computer program<br>
(PRISM 2.0; GraphPad software). To obtain the second<br>
order rate constant, kinact/ kobs values are plotted against<br>
their respective inhibitor concentrations and kinact values<br>
are subsequently calculated by computerized linear<br>
regression.<br>
[0144] Inhibition of caspases-1, -3, and -8 activity<br>
for selected compounds of this invention was determined<br>
by the above method. Compounds II.1-II.20 inhibited<br>
caspase-1 with a kinact of &gt;60,000 M^s"1, caspase-3 with a<br>
kinact between 0 and 300,000 M^s"1, and caspase-8 with a<br>
kinact of at &gt;35,000 MTV1.<br>

PBMC Cell Assay<br>
IL-1/3 Assay with a Mixed Population of Human Peripheral<br>
Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) or Enriched Adherent<br>
Mononuclear Cells<br>
[0145] Processing of pre-IL-ip by ICE may be measured<br>
in cell culture using a variety of cell sources. Human<br>
PBMC obtained from healthy donors provides a mixed<br>
population of lymphocyte subtypes and mononuclear cells<br>
that produce a spectrum of interleukins and cytokines in<br>
response to many classes of physiological stimulators.<br>
Adherent mononuclear cells from PBMC provides an enriched<br>
source of normal monocytes for selective studies of<br>
cytokine production by activated cells.<br>
Experimental Procedure:<br><br>
[0146] An initial dilution series of test compound in<br>
DMSO or ethanol is prepared, with a subsequent dilution<br>
into RPMI-10% FBS media (containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 10<br>
mM HEPES, 50 U and 50 ug/ml pen/strep) respectively to<br>
yield drugs at 4x the final test concentration containing<br>
0.4% DMSO or 0.4% ethanol. The final concentration of<br>
DMSO is 0.1% for all drug dilutions. A concentration<br>
titration which brackets the apparent K^ for a test<br>
compound determined in an ICE inhibition assay is<br>
generally used for the primary compound screen.<br>
[0147] Generally 5-6 compound dilutions are tested and<br>
the cellular component of the assay is performed in<br>
duplicate, with duplicate ELISA determinations on each<br>
cell culture supernatant.<br>
PBMC Isolation and IL-1 Assay:<br>
[0148] Buffy coat cells isolated from one pint human<br>
blood (yielding 4O-45 ml final volume plasma plus cells)<br>
are diluted with media to 80 ml and LeukoPKEP separation<br>
tubes (Becton Dickinson) are each overlaid with 10 ml of<br>
cell suspension. After 15 min centrifugation at 150O-<br>
1800 xg, the plasma/media layer is aspirated and then the<br>
mononuclear cell layer is collected with a Pasteur<br>
pipette and transferred to a 15 ml conical centrifuge<br>
tube (Corning) . Media is added to bring the volume to 15<br>
ml, gently mix the cells by inversion and centrifuge at<br>
300 xg for 15 min. The PBMC pellet is resuspended in a<br>
small volume of media, the cells are counted and adjusted<br>
to 6 x 106 cells/ml.<br>
[0149] For the cellular assay, 1.0 ml of the cell<br>
suspension is added to each well of a 24-well flat bottom<br>
tissue culture plate (Corning), 0.5 ml test compound<br>
dilution and 0.5 ml LPS solution (Sigma #L-3012; 20 ng/ml<br><br>
solution prepared in complete RPMI media; final LPS<br>
concentration 5 ng/ml) . The 0.5 ml additions of test<br>
compound and LPS are usually sufficient to mix the<br>
contents of the wells. Three control mixtures are run<br>
per experiment, with either LPS alone, solvent vehicle<br>
control, and/or additional media to adjust the final<br>
culture volume to 2.0 ml. The cell cultures are<br>
incubated for 16-18 hr at 37 °C in the presence of 5%<br>
co2.<br>
[0150] At the end of the incubation period, cells are<br>
harvested and transferred to 15 ml conical centrifuge<br>
tubes. After centrifugation for 10 min at 200 xg,<br>
supernatants are harvested and transferred to 1.5 ml<br>
Bppendorf tubes. It may be noted that the cell pellet<br>
may be utilized for a biochemical evaluation of pre-IL-lfi<br>
and/or mature IL-ip content in cytosol extracts by<br>
Western blotting or ELISA with pre-IL-ip specific<br>
antisera.<br>
Isolation of Adherent Mononuclear cells:<br>
[0151] PBMC are isolated and prepared as described<br>
above. Media (1.0 ml) is first added to wells followed<br>
by 0.5 ml of the PBMC suspension. After a one hour<br>
incubation, plates are gently shaken and nonadherent<br>
cells aspirated from each well. Wells are then gently<br>
washed three times with 1.0 ml of media and final<br>
resuspended in 1.0 ml media. The enrichment for adherent<br>
cells generally yields 2.5-3.0 x 105 cells per well. The<br>
addition of test compounds, LPS, cell incubation<br>
conditions and processing of supernatants proceeds as<br>
described above.<br><br>
ELISA:<br>
[0152] Quantikine kits (R&amp;D Systems) may be used for<br>
the measurement of mature IL-ip. Assays are performed<br>
according to the manufacturer's directions. Mature IL-ip<br>
levels of about 1-3 ng/ml in both PBMC and adherent<br>
mononuclear cell positive controls are observed. ELISA<br>
assays are performed on 1:5, 1:10 and 1:20 dilutions of<br>
supernatants from LPS-positive controls to select the<br>
optimal dilution for supernatants in the test panel.<br>
10153} The inhibitory potency of the compounds can be<br>
represented by an IC50 value, which is the concentration<br>
of inhibitor at which 50% of mature IL-1J3 is detected in<br>
the supernatant as compared to the positive controls.<br>
[0154] The skilled practitioner realizes that values<br>
obtained in cell assays may depend on multiple factors.<br>
The values may not necessarily represent fine<br>
quantitative results.<br>
[0155] Selected compounds of this invention have been<br>
tested for inhibition of IL-10 release from PBMCs with<br>
IC50 values between 300nM and 10JXM.<br>
Anti-Fas Induced Apoptosis Assay<br>
[0156] Cellular apoptosis may be induced by the<br>
binding of Fas ligand (FasL) to its receptor, CD95 (Fas).<br>
CD95 is one of a family of related receptors, known as<br>
death receptors, which can trigger apoptosis in cells via<br>
activation of the caspase enzyme cascade. The process is<br>
initiated by the binding of the adapter molecule<br>
FADD/MORT-1 to the cytoplasmic domain of the CD-95<br>
receptor-ligamd complex. Caspase-8 then binds FADD and<br>
becomes activated, initiating a cascade of events that<br>
involve the activation of downstream caspases and<br>
subsequent cellular apoptosis. Apoptosis can also be<br><br>
induced in cells expressing CD95 e.g., the Jurkat E6.1 T<br>
cell lymphoma cell line, using an antibody, rather than<br>
FasL, to crosslink the cell surface CD95. Anti-Fas-<br>
induced apoptosis is also triggered via the activation of<br>
caspase-8. This provides the basis of a cell based assay-<br>
to screen compounds for inhibition of the caspase-8-<br>
mediated apoptotic pathway.<br>
Experimental Procedure<br>
[0157] Jurkat E6.1 cells are cultured in complete<br>
medium consisting of RPMI-1640 (Sigma No) + 10% foetal<br>
calf serum (Gibco BRL No. 10099-141) + 2mM L-glutamine<br>
(Sigma No. G-7513) . The cells are harvested in log phase<br>
of growth. 100 ml of cells at 5-8x105 cells/ml are<br>
transferred to sterile 50ml Falcon centrifuge tubes and<br>
centrifuged for 5 minutes at lOOxg at room temperature.<br>
The supernatant is removed and the combined cell pellets<br>
resuspended in 25ml of complete medium. The cells are<br>
counted and the density adjusted to 2xl06cells/ml with<br>
complete medium.<br>
[0158] The test compound is dissolved in dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma No. D-2650) to give a lOOmM stock<br>
solution. This is diluted to 400/M in complete medium,<br>
then serially diluted in a 96-well plate prior to<br>
addition to the cell assay plate.<br>
[0159] 100^1 of the cell suspension (2x106 cells) is<br>
added to each well of a sterile 96-well round-bottomed<br>
cluster plate (Costar No. 3790). 50#1 of compound<br>
solution at the appropriate dilution and 50jtl of anti-Fas<br>
antibody, clone CH-11 (Upstate, Cat No.l 544 675) at a<br>
final concentration of lOng/ml, are added to the wells.<br>
Control wells are set up minus antibody and minus<br>
compound but with a serial dilution of DMSO as vehicle<br>
control. The plates are incubated for 16-18hrs at 37°C<br><br>
in 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.<br>
[0160] Apoptosis of the cells is measured by the<br>
quantitation of DNA fragmentation using a ^Cell Death<br>
Detection Assay' from Roche diagnostics. No. 1544 675.<br>
After incubation for 16-18hrs the assay plates are<br>
centrifuged at lOOxg at room temperature for 5 minutes.<br>
150fil of the supernatant are removed and replaced by<br>
150/xl of fresh complete medium. The cells are then<br>
harvested and 200^1 of the lysis buffer supplied in the<br>
assay kit are added to each well. The cells are<br>
triturated to ensure complete lysis and incubated for 30<br>
minutes at 4°C. The plates are then centrifuged at<br>
1900xg for 10 minutes and the supernatants diluted 1:20<br>
in the incubation buffer provided. 100#1 of this<br>
solution is then assayed according to the manufacturer's<br>
instructions supplied with the kit. OD405nm is measured<br>
20 minutes after addition of the final substrate in a<br>
SPECTRAmax Plus plate reader (Molecular Devices).<br>
OD405nm is plotted versus compound concentration and the<br>
IC50 values for the compounds are calculated using the<br>
curve-fitting program SOFTmax Pro (Molecular Devices)<br>
using the four parameter fit option.<br>
Selected compounds have been tested in this assay and<br>
shown to inhibit Fas-induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells<br>
with IC50 values between 0.013fiM and 8\M.<br>
