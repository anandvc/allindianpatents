3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to organomodified silylated surfactant compositions that exhibit resistance to hydrolysis over a wide pH range. More particularly the present invention relates to such hydrolysis-resistant organomodified silylated surfactants having a resistance to hydrolysis between a pH of about 2 to a pH of about 12. More particularly the present invention relates to the use of such hydrolysis resistant organomodiieid silylated surfactants in agricultural compositions, cosmetic compositions, home care compositions and coating compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The topical application of liquid compositions to the surfaces of both animate and inaminate objects to effect a desired change involve the processes of controlling wetting, spreading, foaming, detergency, and the like. When used in aqueous solutions to improve the deliver}' of active ingredients to the surface being treated, trisiloxane-type compounds have been found to be useful in enabling the control of these processes to achieve the desired effect. However, the trisiloxane compounds may only be used in a narrow pH range, ranging from a slightly acidic pH of 6 to a very mildly basic pH of 7.5. Outside this narrow pH range, the trisiloxane compounds are not stable to hydrolysis, undergoing rapid decomposition. Silicon based surfactants that are stable to hydrolysis over a wide pH range are very desirable, as such compounds would allow more effective formulations regarding the topical application of liquid compositions to the surfaces of both animate and inaminate objects. Such compositions may allow the use oi smaller quantities oi water. Another potential advantage is to increase the effectiveness of agricultural sprays.<br>

The hydride intermediates of Examples 1-3 were further modified with various allylpolyalkyleneoxides to yield the organomodified silylated surfactant compositions of the present invention (Table 1), as well as comparative trisiloxane surfactants (From Table 2).<br>
The organomodified silylated surfactant compositions of the present invention were prepared by conventional methods of platinum-mediated hydrosilylation, as described in Bailey, U.S. Patent 3,299,112, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Table 1 provides a description of the compositions of the present invention. These compositions are described by the general structure:<br>

Additionally, comparative sample OPE (Octylphenolethoxylate, containing 10 polyoxyethylene units) is a non-silicone organic surfactant. This product is available as Triton® X-100 from Dow Chemical Company, Midland, MI.<br><br>
Example 5<br>
This example demonstrates the ability of the organomodified silylated surfactant compositions of the present invention to reduce aqueous surface tension, thereby showing utility as surfactants. Surface tension was measured using a Kruss surface tensiometer, with a sand blasted platinum blade as the sensor. Solutions of the various components were prepared at 0.1 wt% in 0.005M NaCl water (deionized), as an equilibrium aid.<br>
Table 3 shows that solutions of these unique compositions provide a significant reduction in surface tension relative to the conventional surfactant.<br>
The compositions of the present invention also provide spreading properties similar to the comparative trisiloxane surfactants (A, B). Additionally, organomodified silylated surfactants of the present invention provide improved spreading relative to the conventional silicone polyether (C) and conventional organic surfactant product OPE.<br>
Spreading was determined by applying a 10 pL droplet, of surfactant solution to polystyrene Petri dishes (Fisher Scientific) and measuring the spread diameter (mm) after 30 seconds, at a relative humidity between 50 and 70% (at 22 to 25°C). The solution was applied with an automatic pipette to provide droplets of reproducible volume. Deionized water that was further purified with a Millipore filtration system was used to prepare the surfactant solutions.<br>

Hydrolytic stability was determined for representative compositions of the present invention using HPLC Solutions of the various compositions were prepared at 0.5 wt% over a pH range from pH 2 to pH 12, and monitored by HPLC for decomposition as a function of time<br>
Analytical Method<br>
The samples were analyzed by a reverse-phase chromatographic technique using the experimental conditions listed in Table 4<br>
Table 4-Solvent Gradient for HPLC Method<br><br>
Detector:	ELSD/  LTA (Evaporative Light Scattering with Low Temperature<br>

Flow Rate:	l.0 mL/mm<br>
Inj Volume:	10 microlitres<br>
Sample:	0.050 g/mL in methanol<br>
Tables 5-7 demonstrate that the compositions of the present invention provide improved resistance to hydrolytic decomposition relative to the standard comparative siloxane-based surfactant Siloxane A, under similar pH conditions.<br>
Comparative siloxane A shows rapid hydrolysis at ≤ pH 5 and &gt; pH 9, while the organomodified silylated surfactants of the present invention demonstrate a higher resistance to hydrolysis under the same conditions.<br><br>

Table 6-Hydrolytic Stability of Organomodified Silyiated Surfactants by HPLC<br><br><br><br>
Table 7-Hydrolytic Stability of Comparative Siloxane-Based Surfactants by HPLC<br>
Example 7<br>
Unlike traditional siloxane based surfactants, which are subject to rapid hydrolysis under acidic and basic conditions (≤pH 5 and ≥ pH 9), the organ omodified silylated surfactants of the present invention provide increased resistance to hydrolysis relative to traditional trisiioxane alkoxylates (Comparative Example A). An artifact of hydrolysis is observed as a reduction in spreading properties over time. Therefore, solutions of the organomodified silylated surfactants of the present invention, as well as comparative surfactants, were prepared at desired use levels and pH. Spreading was determined as a function of time to illustrate resistance to hydrolysis.<br>
Table 8 is an illustrative example of a traditional organomodified trisiioxane ethoxylate surfactant, which exhibits decreased spreading performance with time as a function of hydrolytic decomposition over a pH range from pH 3 to pH 10. Here a 0.4 wt% solution of product A was prepared at pH 3, 4, 5 and 10. Spreading was determined by applying a 10 μL droplet of surfactant solution to polyacetate film (USI, "Crystal Clear Write on Film") and measuring the spread diameter (mm) after 30 seconds, at a relative humidity between 50 and 70% (at 22 to 25°C). The solution was applied with an automatic pipette to provide droplets of reproducible volume. Deionized water that was further purified with a Millipore filtration system was used to prepare the surfactant solutions.<br><br><br>
Table 8-Effect of pH on Spreading Properties Vs. Time<br>
Table 9 is an illustrative example of an organomodified silylated surfactant of the present invention, where product No. 2, a superspreader, has improved resistance to hydrolysis, over a pH range from pH 3 to pH 10 relative to a traditional trisiloxane ethoxylate surfactant (Product A). As mentioned above, resistance to hydrolysis was observed by monitoring the spreading properties over time. Here a 0.1 wt% solution was prepared at pH 3, 4, 5 and 10 Spreading was determined by applying a 10 uL droplet of surfactant solution to polystyrene Petri dishes (Fisher Scientific) and measuring the spread diameter (mm) after 30 seconds, at a relative humidity between 50 and 70% (at 22 to 25°C). The solution was applied with an automatic pipette to provide droplets of reproducible volume. Deionized water that was further purified with a Millipore filtration system was used to prepare the surfactant solutions.<br>
Table 9-Effect of pH on Spreading Properties Vs. Time<br><br><br>
Example 8<br>
The impact of other ingredients on spreading was determined by blending the organomodified silylated surfactant of the present invention, with a conventional organic based co-surfactant. The co-surfactants are described in Table 10.<br>
Blends were prepared as physical mixtures where the weight fraction of the silylated surfactant is represented by a (alpha), indicating that the co-surfactant makes up the balance of the blend ratio. For example when a = 0 this indicates that the composition contains 0% of the silylated surfactant component and 100% co-surfactant, while an a = 1.0 indicates the composition contains 100% silylated surfactant and no (0%) co-surfactant. Mixtures of the two components are represented by the weight fraction a, where u ranges as follows: 0 ≤ a ≤ 1.0. By example when a = 0.25 this indicates the surfactant mixture is composed of 25% silylated surfactant and 75% co-surfactant. These blends are then diluted in water to the desired concentration for spreading evaluation.<br>
Spreading was determined as described in Example 5, at 0.1wt% total surfactant.<br>
The silylated surfactant alone at relative concentrations (i.e. a = 0.75 is equivalent to 0.075% of this surfactant in water) was used as a baseline for spread performance, since the major contributor to spreading comes from the silylated surfactant. The maximum spreading provided by the co-surfactant at 0.1 %. (a = 0) . Synergy is demonstrated when the blend of silylated surfactant and co-surfactant exceeds the spreading of the co-surfactant (a = 0) and the silylated surfactant at the relative a value.<br>
Table 11 demonstrates that representative examples of the co- surfactants of the present invention provide favorable spreading results, and in some cases provide an unexpected synergistic enhancement, where the spread diameter of the mixture exceeds that of the individual components.<br><br><br><br>
