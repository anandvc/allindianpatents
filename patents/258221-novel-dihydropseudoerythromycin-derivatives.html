DESCRIPTION<br>
NOVEL DIHYDROPSEUDOERYTHROMYCIN DERIVATIVES<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a novel<br>
dihydropseudoerythromycin derivative. Particularly, the<br>
present invention relates to a novel dihydropseudoerythromycin<br>
derivative, which is superior in the anti-inflammatory action<br>
and stable.<br>
Background Art<br>
Erythromycin (14-membered ring macrolide) is difficult to<br>
use as an anti-inflammatory agent since it simultaneously has<br>
an anti-inflammatory action and an antibacterial action. To<br>
solve this problem, a pseudoerythromycin derivative (12-<br>
membered ring, see THE KITASATO INSTITUTE, EM700 series,<br>
WO2002/14338 and WO2004/39823) having an anti-inflammatory<br>
action but free of an antibacterial action has been reported.<br>
A representative compound is EM703 shown by the following<br>
formula:<br><br>
The above-mentioned pseudoerythromycin derivative has a<br>
problem in that its pharmacological action may not be<br>
sufficiently exhibited by oral administration, since the<br>
derivative is partly decomposed by an acid and becomes<br>
comparatively unstable.<br>
A dihydro form obtained by reducing to solve the problem<br>
is stable to acid and shows good pharmacological action by<br>
oral administration. While Faghih R, Nellans HN, Lartey PA,<br>
Petersen A, Marsh K, Bennani YL, Plattner JJ. Preparation of<br>
9-deoxo-4"-deoxy-6,9-epoxyerythromycin lactams "motilactides":<br><br>
potent and orally active prokinetic agents. Bioorg Med Chem<br>
Lett. 1998, 8(7):805-10 describes dihydropseudoerythromycin<br>
derivatives, all of them are 4"-dehydroxy forms of cladinose<br>
(sugar at the 3-position). The document describes that the<br>
dihydropseudoerythromycin derivatives show a weak<br>
gastrointestinal motility-promoting activity, but does not<br>
describe an anti-inflammatory action.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention aims to avoid the antibacterial<br>
action of erythromycin and develop a compound having an anti-<br>
inflammatory action alone, particularly, to develop a stable<br>
pseudoerythromycin derivative.<br>
The present inventors have conducted intensive studies in<br>
an attempt to solve the aforementioned problem and succeeded<br>
in avoiding the antibacterial action by using a 12-membered<br>
ring and further reducing the compound to give a dihydro form,<br>
thereby improving the stability to an acid, which resulted in<br>
the completion of the present invention. Accordingly, the<br>

Starting Material Synthesis Example 1<br>
Synthesis of 8,9-anhydroerythromycin A 6,9-hemiketal (EM201)<br><br><br>
A solution (710.0 mL) of EMA (erythromycin A; 104.4 g,<br>
16.90 mmol) in glacial acetic acid was stirred at room<br>
temperature for 2 hr, and aqueous NaHC03 solution was slowly<br>
added to neutralize the solution. The reaction mixture was<br>
extracted with CHC13, and the organic layer was dried over<br>
Na2S04. The residue was filtrated, and the filtrate was<br>
concentrated to give a crude product (99.30 g). The obtained<br>
crude product was dissolved in CHCI3 (250 mL) , and the solution<br>
was recrystallized by adding hexane (50 mL) to give EM201<br>

Experimental Example 1<br>
As one index of the anti-inflammatory action of the<br>
compound of the present invention, the differentiation<br>
induction-promoting activity of THP-1 cell was measured. The<br>
measurement was performed as shown below.<br>
THP-1 cells (ATCC No. TIB-202) were adjusted to a<br>
concentration of 2x105 cells/ml with a medium (RPMI 1640), PMA<br>
was added thereto to a final concentration of 1 - 2 fxM, and the<br><br>
mixture was dispensed to each well of a 96 well plate by 100 (j.1.<br>
A solution (100 ji.1) containing a test substance was adjusted to<br>
an appropriate concentration with the medium and added to each<br>
well. The mixture was stirred by gently shaking the plate, and<br>
incubated under 37°C, 5% C02 conditions for 72 - 96 hr. Each<br>
well was washed with PBS, a medium containing the viable cell<br>
measurement reagent SF (Nacalai Tesque) was added at 100<br>
ul/well and the mixture was incubated under the conditions of<br>
37°C, 5% C02 for 3 - 5 hr. The absorbance was measured with a<br>
plate reader.<br>
The results of the T.HP-1 differentiation induction-<br>
promoting activity measured above are shown in Table 6. In the<br>
Table, the activity value is the lowest concentration<br>
necessary for the test compound to show a 50% activity value<br>
relative to the activity value of erythromycin A at 100 uM in<br>
this experiment.<br><br><br>

Using 8-week-old male SD rats under pentobarbital anesthesia, TNBS solution<br>
was injected into the rectum of animals after fasting for 24 hr or longer and<br>
abstaining from water for 5 hr or longer. After injection, a silicone stopper was<br>
inserted into the anus to perform a treatment for 3.5-4 hr, whereby a colitis<br>

of the final drug administration, the large intestine (about 15 cm from the anus)<br>
was removed after decapitation and exsanguinations, and the level of damage<br>
was scored by the method of Wallace et al. ( Wallace, J. L. et al,Inhibition of<br>
