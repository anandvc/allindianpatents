				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of highly selective hydrodechlorination catalyst. These catalysts prepared by this invention is useful for hydrodechlorination of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).<br>
Removal of chlorine in presence of hydrogen is defined as hydrodechlorination. However, simple hydrodechlorination of CFCs produces toxic byproducts. Selective hydrodechlorination involves conversion of CFCs into value-added products which are environmentally safe. The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of selective hydrodechlorination catalyst for production of HFCs from CFCs. One such example is the hydrodechlorination of CFC-12 to synthesize HFC-32, which is a deep refrigerant.<br>
Hithereto, a number of methods were reported in patent literature for preparation of catalyst used in the selective hydrodechlorination of CFC-12. Preparation of HFC-32 from CFC-12 using Palladium/carbon catalysts were disclosed in a set of patents; Nos. EP 508 660, PIBR 92 01 323 JP WO 94 11 328, JP 05, 339 182 JP 06 01 731 Pct. Int. WO 96 17 683. In all these are mentioned different methods for the preparation of activated carbon used as support material. The disadvantages of activated carbon in industrial applications are its poor mechanical strength and the presence of micro pores which are not accessible during reaction due to diffusional limitations. The use of active phase deposited in these pores is thus restricted reducing the efficiency of the catalyst. Moreover, activated carbon offers a variety of oxygen<br><br>
functional groups and also contains lot of impurities, which cannot be removed by simple techniques. In a Ph.D thesis submitted by a research group to the Deflt University of Technology, Netherlands, a process for purification of activated carbon is disclosed. Though the catalyst offers high activity and selectivity, it requires an operating pressure of 0.3-0.5 Mpa<br>
Other patents like ENCSM.34053 Montpellier (CA. No. 119:94820t), No. ENSCM, 8 reu 1' [Ecole Normale Montpellier, Fr.] (CA. No. 119: 94820t) deal with Palladium supported on a metal oxide or metal fluoride (i.e., AI203 or AIF3) or graphite. However, oxide supports are not resistant to HF/ HCI which are produced in the course of reaction. In these corrosive reaction conditions not only the acidity of the support changes but also there is a loss in the activity of the catalyst. Another main disadvantage of using this type of supports is that the support may convert to a mixture of hydroxyfluoride, oxyfluoride and fluoride during the reaction. The active metal fluorides such as AIF3, which are acidic, catalyze the F/CI halogen exchange reactions in presence of HF leading to low product selectivity.<br>
Yet another patent namely, US 5426252 deals with Palladium supported over the IV B metal carbides. But they undergo faster deactivation.<br>
Thus the main object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation of improved catalyst for hydrodechlorination of CFCs by overcoming the disadvantages mentioned above.<br><br>
According to the present invention Palladium supported on acidic carbon-covered alumina prepared with a suitable carbon content (
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing a Palladium catalyst with a support that obviates the disadvantages and combines the advantages associated with carbon and alumina support simultaneously.<br>
Another object of present invention is to provide a method wherein the metal support interaction associated with alumina is minimized, the catalyst is thermally stable and the strong acid sites are reduced by coating it with a thin layer of carbon.<br>
Yet another object of present invention is to convert some part of alumina into a α-ALF3 (aluminum fluoride) which is inactive in the halogen exchange but stabilizes the active phase (Palladium) against diffusion in to bulk.<br>
Still another object of present invention is to prepare a catalyst having better performance compared to Palladium/alumina and Palladium/carbon which possesses selective dechlorination ability for C1 as well as C2 CFCs. The process details of hydrodechlorination of CFCs are mentioned in our co-pending application wherein the performance of these catalysts are disclosed.<br><br>
In our intensive research and experimental studies we have found that by depositing carbon in its pure form by means of pyrolysis of hydrocarbons like cyclohexene or fluorobenzene, on the surface of AI203, it is possible to prepare a support (i) which possesses good mechanical strength, (ii) contains carbon in its purest form, (iii) avoids the presence of impurities normally associated with activated carbons and (iv) avoids micro-pores normally present in activated carbon which reduce the efficiency of the catalyst. The catalyst prepared by depositing Palladium on this support is found to be better active and selective than the catalyst prepared using alumina or carbon alone as support.<br>
Further investigations have revealed that by a simultaneous carbon deposition and fluoride interaction, which is possible by pyrolysis of fluorobenzene, pure carbon can be deposited and the formation of the active fluoride can be avoided. Our high temperature pyrolysis produced an inactive fluoride which is required to stabilize the active species, namely Palladium, by not allowing it to diffuse into the bulk of the catalyst. Thus, the new support contains moderate acidity imparted by the pyrolysis of fluorine containing hydrocarbon on the alumina surface and is best suited for the deposition of Palladium.<br>
The present invention provides an improved process for preparation of highly selective hydrodechlorination catalyst for transformation of CFCs to HFCs/HCFCs. The catalysts as specified for the process are particularly useful for the hydrodechlorination of CFC-12 to HFC-32. The catalyst can also be used for C2 - CFCs.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of highly selective hydrodechlorination catalyst which comprises; calcining γ -A12O3 by conventional methods at 400-1000°C, pyrolysing by known methods the calcined y -Al2O3 characterized in that passing hydrocarbon selected from fluorobenzene or cyclohexene and pretreated with N2 at the flow rate in the range of 40-100 cc/min to obtain γ -A12O3 containing 15-30 wt% carbon and 2-5 wt % fluoride, impregnating 1-12 wt % Palladium preferably less than 10 wt % by conventional methods such as herein described to get Pd impregnated carbon covered alumina hydrodechlorination catalyst.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the calcinations may be effected at 400-1000°C<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the carbon content in the  A12O3 is in the range of 15-25 wt% and fluoride content is in the range of 2-5 wt%.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the pyrolysis may be effected by passing hydrocarbon such as fluorobenzene / cyclohexene at a flow rate of 65 cc/min and the flow rate including N2 may be in between 20-100 cc/min and preferably less than 80 cc/min.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the pyrolysis temperature may be in between 400-1000°C.<br>
In yet an another embodiment of the present invention, less than 10 wt% Palladium may be impregnated.<br><br>
Catalysts were prepared by using carbon-covered alumina and acidic carbon-covered alumina as supports. In all these catalysts the Palladium loading was maintained in the range 2-6 wt.%, preferably in the range 2-4 wt% with respect to the support.<br>
The present invention is described with reference to the following examples that are explained by way of illustrations only and should not therefore be construed to limit the scope of the present work. Example 1<br>
γ-Al2O3 ( Harshaw SA-260 m2g-1) was sieved to 18/25 BSS (calcined for 3 h at 350°C ). 10 g of this sieved material was placed in a quartz reactor which was provided with a thermowell for monitoring the temperature and a three-way stopcock arranged to divert the gas flow. The quartz reactor was placed in an electrically heated furnace and the furnace temperature was slowly raised to 600°C, the catalyst pretreatment temperature, in dry N2 flow. After the pretreatment, the gas line was diverted through a saturator, containing cyclohexene kept at room temperature. The N2 gas saturated with cyclohexene was passed in to the reactor, to pyrolyse cyclohexene on Al2O3. The flow rate of the saturated gas was maintained between 40 - 100 cc/min, preferably less than 80 cc/min this range. The process was continued for 10 - 15h and then cooled to room temperature in dry N2 atmosphere. lOg of this support was impregnated with Palladium using 0.67g palladium chloride aqueous solution as precursor. The Palladium loading was maintained at 4 wt%. This catalyst was oven dried for 12h at 70°C.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
γ-A12O3 ( Harshaw S.A.-260 m2g-1') was sieved to 18/25 BSS (calcined for 3 h at 350°C). 10 g of this sieved material was placed in a quartz reactor which is provided with a thermowell for monitoring the temperature and a three-way stopcock arranged to divert the gas flows. The quartz reactor was placed in an electrically heated furnace and the furnace temperature was slowly raised to the pretreatment temperature in dry N2 flow. After pretreatment the gas line was diverted through a saturator, containing fluorobenzene kept at room temperature. The N2 gas saturated with fluorobenzene was passed in to the reactor, to pyrolyse the fluorobenzene on A12O3. The N2 flow was maintained between 40-100 cc/min, preferably less than 80 cc/min in this range. The process was continued for 10 - 15 h and then cooled to room temperature in dry N2 atmosphere. lOg of this support was impregnated with Palladium using 0.67g palladium chloride aqueous solutions as precursor. Palladium wt% was maintained at 4% with respect to the support. This catalyst is oven dried for 12h at 70°C.<br>
The activity of the catalyst mentioned in Example 2 was the highest. Its properties are as follows. The surface area of the reduced catalyst as determined by nitrogen adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature using conventional high vacuum system, is 130-165 m2g-1 Gravimetric analysis has shown that carbon content is about 15-25% and the fluoride content is about 2-5%. XRD analysis reveals that the carbon deposited on A12O3was amorphous and some part of Al2O3 was in transformed to α- AlF3  whereas the Palladium in the activated catalyst was α-Palladium phase.<br><br>
According to this invention these properties mostly contribute to   the performance of the catalyst.<br>
