				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a catalyst for<br>
polymerizing or copolymerizing an α-olefin, catalyst component<br>
thereof, and method of polymerizing α-olefins with the catalyst<br>
for use in polymerization or copolymerization of a-olefins.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In recent years, in JP-A-57-63310, JP-A-58-83016, JP-A-59-58010, JP-A-60-44507 and others, there have been proposed, for polymerization of alpha-olef in, a number of highly active carrier-supported type catalyst systems comprising solid constituents containing indispensably magnesium, titanium, a halogen element and an electron donor, an organometal compound of a metal of I-III groups in Periodic Table, and an electron donor. Further, in JP-A-62-11705, JP-A-63-259807, JP-A-2-84404, JP-A-4-202505and JP-A-4-370103, therehave been disclosed other polymerization catalysts characterized by containing a specific organosilicon compound as an electron donor. For example, JP-A 2-84404 discloses a method that" employs a cyclopentyl (alkyl) dimethoxy silane or di(cyclopentyl) dimethoxy silane as an electron donor. The catalyst systems using such the silicon compounds, however, are not always excellent in hydrogen response . JP-A 63-223008 discloses a catalyst system that employs a di(n-propyl) dimethoxy silane as an electron donor excellent in hydrogen response, which is though not particularly satisfactory at stereoregularity and causes a problem because an a-olefin polymer can not have an increased solidity.<br>
JP-A 9-40714 proposes an alkoxy silane compound having an aliphatic amino substituent.  JP-A 8-3215, 8-100019 and<br><br>
8-157519 propose methods of manufacturing α-olefins using an alkoxy silane having an aliphatic amino substituent as a catalyst component, which are though not always satisfactory at hydrogen response. JP-A 8-143620 proposes a method of manufacturing α-olefin using a dialkoxy silane having two aliphatic amino substituents as an electron donor, which is though not always satisfactory at polymerization activity and stereoregularity in performance.<br>
JP-A 8-100019 and 8-157519 propose methods of manufacturing a-olef in polymers having a small molecular weight (or large MFR) using a dialkoxy silane having a hydrocarbon group-containing amino substituent and a hydrocarbon group as a catalyst component. They describe examples of polymers with MFR (Melt Flow Rate) of 60g/10min at most, which are not always<br>
satisfactory at hydrogen response in performance.<br>
JP-A 8-120021. 8-143621 and 8-2316663 disclose methodes using cyclic amino silane compounds. When these specifically described compounds are employed as catalyst components, they exhibit high stereoregularity but are not always adequately satisfactory at hydrogen response. In addition, a problem occurs because a molecular weight distribution is not always wide.<br>
JP-A 6-25336, 7-90012 and 7-97411 disclose methods using a nitrogen atom-containing heterocyclic substitutional organosilicon compound that includes a silicon atom directly bonded to any carbon atom in a heterocycle, but they fail to describe any molecular weight distribution. JP-A 3-74393 and 7-173212 disclose methods using a monocyclic amino group-containing organosilicon compound but fail to describe any molecular weight distribution.<br>
A propylene polymer with a wide molecular weight distribution and high stereoregularity can be produced in such a method that can be considered as comprising: producing a high stereoregularity and low molecular weight propylene polymer and a high crys tallinity and high molecular weight propylene polymer previously using a conventional method; and then melting and<br><br>
blending them in a desirable ratio. In this case, production of the propylene polymer with a relatively low molecular weight and wide molecular weight distribution makes it extremely difficult to melt and blend the low molecular weight propylene polymer and the highmolecular weight propylene polymer uniformly, resulting in problems associated with gel generation, for example.<br>
JP-A 2000-63417 discloses a method that provides an a-olefin polymer with high activity, high hydrogen response, high stereoregularity and wide molecular weight distribution. This system, however, worsens hydrogen response and greatly sacrifices stereoregularity when the molecular weight distribution is extended to an aimed value. Thus, an improvement is required.<br>
A high hydrogen response is also important. Namely, when hydrogen coexists in a polymerization system to adjust the molecular weight, a low hydrogen response requires a large amount of hydrogen. Therefore, as described above, the use of an excessive chain transfer agent such as hydrogen is required to produce a low molecular weight polymer. Consequently, it is required to lower a polymerization temperature during bulk polymerization in a polymerization device having a pressure-proof limit and reduce amonomer partial pressure during gas-phase polymerization, resulting in an ill effect exerted on the productivity rate disadvantageously.<br>
JP-A 8-143620 according to the applicant proposes a method of manufacturing an a-olefin using a dialkoxy silane having two aliphatic amino substitutions as an electron donor. This method, however, may lower stereoregularity (H. I. ) and polymerization activity on production of polymers with MFR of 200 or more and is not always satisfactory at performance.<br>
JP-A 8-3215 and 9-40714 also according to the applicant propose an alkoxy silane compound having an aliphatic amino substitution and methods of manufacturing stereoregularity and melt fluidity (that is, high MFR) using the same. The silane compound described therein, however, is only a dialkoxy silane<br><br>
having both of one amino group containing hydrocarbon group and one hydrocarbon group, that is, a dialkoxy silane represented by RLSi(OR2)2(NR3R4). In addition, specifically exemplified compounds are only dimethoxy silanes, for example, a methyl(diethylamino) dimethoxy silane. As for a trialkoxy silane represented by Si(OR2)3(NR3R4), no specific compound is exemplified. The obtained polymerization result is not always satisfactory because a larger MFR results in a lower stereoregularity.<br>
JP-A 2000-63417 and 2000-204111 disclose methods using organosilicon compounds and polycyclic amino organosilicon compounds. When the compounds described therein are employed as catalysts, they exhibit high stereoregularity but are not always satisfactory at hydrogen response.<br>
The carrier catalyst system using the electron donor described earlier is not always satisfactory at balanced polymerization activity, stereoregularity and hydrogen response in performance, and accordingly a further improvement is required.<br>
In recent years, in the field of injection molding mainly for automobile materials and household electrical materials, for the purpose of thinning and light-weighting of products,<br>
a-olefin polymers with high melt fluidity, high solidity and high heat resistance are increasingly needed. It is important to use a catalyst with a high hydrogen response during polymerization toproduce such a-olefin polymers. Specifically, it is general to allow hydrogen to coexist as a chain transfer agent in the polymerization system to adjust the molecular weight of the a-olefin polymer. In particular, to increase the melt fluidity of the a-olefin polymer, hydrogen is required to lower the molecular weight. Melt flow rate is employed as an index of the melt fluidity of the a-olefin polymer. The lower the molecular weight of the a-olefin polymer is related with the higher the melt flow rate. A lower hydrogen response requires a large amount of hydrogen in the polymerization system to increase the melt flow rate of the a-olefin polymer. A higher<br><br>
hydrogen response does not require such the amount of hydrogen as is required in the case of the lower hydrogen response to<br>
produce the a-olefin polymer with the same melt flow rate. Accordingly, the low hydrogen response requires introduction of an excessive amount of hydrogen into the polymerization system<br>
to elevate the melt flow rate of the cc-olefin polymer. Consequently, for safety in a production method, the polymerization temperature in the polymerization device having the pressure-proof limit should be lowered in relation to an increased hydrogen partial pressure. This exerts ill effects on the production speed and the quality disadvantageously.<br>
On the other hand, ethylene propylene block copolymers are widely employed for household electrical and automobile materials and required to reduce their production costs. Methods of manufacturing ethylene propylene block copolymers include a method with the conventional catalyst system, which comprises producing an ethylene propylene block copolymer in a polymerization reactor; and then mixing and kneading a rubber component mechanically, though it has a problem because of its high cost. Therefore, in a method using multistage polymerization devices, a propylene homopolymer is produced at the first stage polymerization device, and a sufficient amount of copolymer is produced during ethylene propylene copolymerization in the following polymerization stages. In this case, such a catalyst system is strongly desired that can produce the so-called linearly polymerized block copolymer of ethylene and propylene so that the produced block polymer has sufficient fluidity.<br>
As for the block copolymer from the conventional catalyst system, if an amount of the polymer in the following stages reaches 10% or more of the polymer in the first state, molding is substantially impossible. This is because the melt fluidity is extremely small unless the rubber component in the block copolymer (a room temperature p-xylene soluble component) has an extremely small value of [t\] .<br>
As a method of manufacturing ethylene propylene block<br><br>
copolymers, jJP-A 8-217841 also filed by the applicant discloses one, which employs a silane compound or bis (dialkylamino) silane as a component of a polymerization catalyst. JP-A 8-231663 also filed by the applicant discloses another method, which employs a silane compound or bis(dicyclicamino) silane as a component of a polymerization catalyst. These (mejthodes^ however, have a subject associated with insufficient hydrogen response.<br>
To solve the above problems associated with the prior arts, the present invention has an object to provide a catalyst for polymerizing or copolymerizing an a-olefin, catalyst component thereof, and method of polymerizing a-olef ins with the catalyst, for production of a-olefin polymers or copolymers with high hydrogen response, high polymerization activity, high stereoregularity and excellent melt fluidity.<br>

The acidic catalyst may be either a Lewis acid or a Bronsted acid. The Lewis acid includes aluminum chloride, titanium chloride, and boron fluoride. Preferably, from the viewpoint of suppressing the generation of hydrogen halide gases, the Bronsted acid includes an acid in such a form that does not contain an extra water content. For example, it includes carboxylic acid (such as a trifluoroacetic acid), sulfonic, acid (such as p-toluene sulfonic acid), and polyphosphoric acid. Among those, p-toluene sulfonic acid is preferable. The p-toluene sulfonic acid may be employed as a hydrate unless generation of a small amount of hydrogen halides causes any problem.<br>
An additional amount of the p-toluene sulfonic acid to SiX4 ranges preferably between 10"5 and 10 mole %, more preferably between 10"2 and 5 mole %.<br>
Preferably, the reaction is performed by dropping the orthof ormate ester represented by Formula 20 into the tetrahalo<br><br>
silane, represented by Formula 19. In this case, both or either of them may be formed in solution.<br>
The alkoxy silane halide represented by Formula 16, produced through the reaction between the tetrahalosilane represented by Formula 19 and the orthof ormate ester represented by Formula 20, is not isolated and is reacted with the dialkyl amine represented by Formula 17 to produce the catalyst component of Formula 14.<br>
The alkoxy silane halide represented by Formula 16, produced through the reaction between the tetrahalosilane represented by Formula 19 and the orthof ormate ester represented by Formula 20, is not isolated and is reacted with the cyclic amine represented by Formula 18 to produce the catalyst component of Formula 15.<br>
In addition to the use of the Grignard reagent, a (dialkylamino) alkoxy silane may be produced from an alkoxy silane halide employed as a material in a known method.<br>
Alkoxy silane halides are not only semiconductor method materials but also suitable precursors on chemical synthesis for various low-molecular and high-molecular silicon compounds. Namely, through the use of differences in reactivity between a halogeno group and an alkoxy group and variations in the substituted number of the substituents, various high value-added silicon compounds can be derived.<br>
Methodes of manufacturing the above alkoxy silane halides are disclosed, for example, in J. Am. Chem. Soc, vol. 68, p. 70 (1946) and Khimiya i Industriya. No. 6, p. 248 (1983), which produce chloroethoxysilane by reacting tetrachlorosilane with ethanol. These methodes, however, generate hydrogen chloride gas in the reaction system. Therefore, it is required to remove the gas and make it harmless. In addition, a restriction occurs on the reactor due to the gas being corrosive. Measures applied for those are unsatisfactory not only at method steps but also at costs. Thus, a further improvement is desired.<br>
On the other hand, a patent publication (JP-A 5-310751) proposes a method of manufacturing through a reaction of<br><br>
tetrachlorosilane with tetraalkoxysilane. This method can prevent generation of the hydrogen chloride gas though yields in examples are 60 to 75 % at most, and a much higher yield is desired.<br>
As disclosed in Zhurnal Obshchei Khimii, vol. 65, p. 1142 (1995) , trichloroethoxysilane can be produced at a maximum yield of 90% through a reaction of tetrachlorosilane with tetraalkoxysilane in the presence of ethanol. In this reaction system, however, it is obvious that hydrogen chloride gas is generated.<br>
The above method of manufacturing the catalyst can provide alkoxy silane halides and diethylamino trialkoxy silanes at a high yield without generation of corrosive gases such as hydrogen chloride gas.<br>

Specific examples of the organosilicon compounds represent by the general formula 22 include a compound represented by the chemical structural formula 35 or 36.<br><br><br><br><br>
Examples of the above-mentioned organosilicon compounds having two saturated polycyclic amino groups have geometrical<br><br>
isomers since the polycyclic amino group may have a cis- or<br>
trans-isomer. That is, there exist isomers such as<br>
(trans-polycyclic	amino)(trans-polycyclic<br>
amino)dialkoxysilane, (cis-polycyclic amino)(cis-polycyclic<br>
amino)dialkoxysilane,	(trans-polycyclic<br>
amino) (cis-polycyclicamino)dialkoxysilane. Specific examples thereof include, bis(trans-perhydroquinolino)dimethoxysilane, bis (cis -perhydroquinolino) dimethoxysilane, bis (trans -perhydroisoquinolino) dimethoxysilane, bis(cis-perhydroisoquinolino)dimethoxysilane. Any of those isomers may be used as the constituent (D) in the present invention, singly or in the form of a mixture. Other organosilicon compounds, for example,  existing organosilicon compounds,  such as cyclohexylmethyldimethoxysilane;<br>
dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane; di-isopropyldimethoxysilane ; di-n-butyldimethoxysilane; and methyl-n-butyldimethoxysilane may be also employed as the constituent [D] of the present invention.<br>
An organosilicon compound which is the catalyst constituent (D) represented by the formula 21 can be synthesized by reacting tetramethoxysilane or dichlorodimethoxysilane with 2 equivalent amounts of a magnesium salt or lithium salt of the secondary amine represented by the formula HNR. Further, the catalyst constituent (D) represented by the general formula 22 can be synthesized by reacting an alkyl trimethoxysilane or alkyl chlorodimethoxysilane with a magnesium salt or lithium salt of the secondary amine represented by the formula HNR.<br>
When the constituents [C] and [D] are employed, they may be mixed previously or solely added in the polymerization system. A mixed molar ratio ([ C ] / [ D ] ) is between 0.01 and 3 , preferably between 0.02 and 2, and more preferably between 0.05 and 1.<br>
The catalyst system consisting of the catalyst constituents [A], [B], [C] and [D] exhibits high catalyst activity and hj^^hyjaxogen response. In addition, a produced<br>
a-olef in polymer has high stereoregularity and a wide molecular weight distribution. The molecular weight distribution has a<br><br>
ratio Mw/Mn derived from a weight-averaged molecular weight, Mw, and a number-averaged molecular weight, Mn, on a polystyrene basis in a GPC measurement. A value of the ratio is equal to or more than 10, preferably equal to or more than 12, and more preferably equal to or more than 15.<br>
As the a-olefin polymer produced using the catalyst has a wide molecular weight distribution, it has a high melt viscoelasticity. Particularly, it is excellent in formation of films and the like as well as excellent in solidity of injected moldings, heat resistance, and mechanical physical properties such as tensile strength without any problem associated with appearance deficits of moldings typified with flow marks . The a-olefin polymer produced by the invention may be employed solely. In addition, it may be employed, as a compound material, in blend with other plastics or elastomers, and in combination with reinforcements for inorganic and organic fillers such as glass fibers and talc, and other crystal nucleus agents. It can provide excellent performance, not particularly limited, to automobile and household electric structural materials.<br>
A conventional method of manufacturing a-olefin polymers with a high hydrogen response, high stereoregularity and wide molecular weight distribution is disclosed, for example, in JP-A 2000-63417. In propylene bulk polymerization, however, the conventional combination is difficult to achieve a molecular weight distribution of Mw/Mn = 12 under the condition of total pressure of 3.8 MPa or below while maintaining a MFR of 120 and a stereoregularity of 98.5%. The use of the catalyst of the invention can achieve this target value. Copolymerization with ethylene or other a-olefins can produce a copolymer with good randomness and a high melt viscoelasticity.<br>
The a-olefin polymer produced using the catalyst has a molecular weight distribution almost similar to that of an a-olefin polymer produced with a conventional titanium trichloride catalyst called the second generation catalyst with low polymerization reaction rate. Therefore, it has good moldability and no problem associated with appearance deficits<br><br>
of moldings typified with flow marks. The catalyst system for use in the invention can be employed as an alternative of the titanium trichloride catalyst. As it has a much higher polymerization reaction rate than that of the titanium trichloride catalyst, it can omit the step of removing catalytic residues from inside the polymer, or the step of deashing using a large amount of organic solvent, which is essentially required in the art. This is effective to simplify polymerization methodes and reduce production costs.<br>
Method of Polymerizing g-Oleflns<br>
For achievement of the above object, the present invention is directed to an a-olef in polymerization method of polymerizing or copolymerizing a-olefins in the presence of the a-olefin polymerization or copolymerization catalyst. The polymerization in the method for polymerizing a-olefin according to the invention includes homopolymerization of a-olefins as well as copolymerization such as a-olefin propylene block copolymerization and a-olefin propylene random copolymerization.<br>
The method of polymerizing a-olefins according to the present invention includes a slurry polymerization method, in which a nonpolar solvent such as propane, n^butane. n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane and n-octane is employed. It also includes a gas-phase polymerization method, in which a monomer in gas state is contact with a catalyst for polymerization; and a bulk polymerization meth_od, in which a monomer in liquid state is employed as a solvent for polymerization therein. These polymerization methods may be performed by continuous polymerization or batch polymerization, and polymerization reaction may be performed in a single stage or a plurality of stages with combination of the above polymerization methods.<br>
In the above polymerization methods, a polymerization pressure is 0 .1 to 20MPatpref erably 0 .5 to 6MPa, a polymerization temperature is 10 to 150 °C, preferably 30 to 100 °C, and more preferably 60 to 90 °C, and a polymerization time is 0.1 to 10<br><br>
hours, preferably 0.5 to 7 hours.<br>
Through the use of the cc-olefin polymerization or copolymerization catalyst according to the invention, in bulk polymerization under a reaction pressure of 3.8 MPa, propylene bulk polymerization under a hydrogen partial pressure equal to or less than 0.7 MPa is performed. In this case, it is possible to produce an a-olefin polymer having a MFR equal to or more than 400 measured at 230 °C with a weight of 2.16 kg in compliant with ASTM D1238 and having a meso-pentad fraction (mmmm) equal to or more than 98.5%.<br>
The polymer may be employed in blend with other plastics or elastomers, and in easily mixture of reinforcements for inorganic and organic fillers such as glass fibers and talc, and other crystal nucleus agents. As the polymer has a small molecular weight, when it is melted and kneaded with an ethylene/propylene copolymer, an operation at a lower temperature is allowed with a high viscosity of the copolymer, which disperses the copolymer finely and uniformly more than it is kneaded at a higher temperature. In addition, it is possible to prevent a bleed-out phenomenon that can be often observed during melting and kneading. Thus, the present material is considered as an excellent compound material that can be employed for producing, not particularly limited to, automobile and household electric structural materials. When it is employed in the so-called linear polymerization to subsequently produce an ethylene/propylene copolymer after the production of the present polymer, an excellent effect can be shown.<br>
Preferably, in the present invention the main polymerization of a-olefins is performed after prepolymerization of an ethylene or a-olefin in accordance with the above various polymerization methods. The prepolymerization is effective to improve the polymerization reaction rate, improve the stereoregularity of the polymer, and stabilize the morphology of the polymer.<br>
In the method of prepolymerization, the solid catalyst<br><br>
constituent [A] is previously contacted with the organoaluminum compound constituent [B] and the organosilicon compound constituent [C] or with the organoaluminum compound constituent [B], the organosilicon compound constituent [C] and the organosilicon compound constituent [D] to polymerize a limited amount of ethylene or a-olef in to prepare aprepolymerized solid. In another case, without polymerization of ethylene or a-olef in, the solid catalyst constituent [A] is contacted with the organoaluminum compound constituent [B] and the organosilicon compound constituent [C] or with the organoaluminum compound constituent [B], the organosilicon compound constituent [C] and the organosilicon compound constituent [D] to prepare a preliminarily methoded solid.<br>
In the present invention, the prepolymerized solid or the preliminarily methoded solid may be employed as the solid catalyst constituent in the main polymerization. In this case, during the main polymerization, the organosilicon compound constituent [C], or the organosilicon compound constituent [C] and the organosilicon compound cohsT3Trlient£pj_can be omitted, and only the organosilicon compound constituent [D] can be omitted.<br>
After prepolymerization in the presence of the catalyst consisting of the solid catalyst constituent [A], the organoaluminum compound constituent [B] and the organosilicon compound constituent [D] , subsequent polymerization or copolymerization of an a-olefin may be performed with addition of the organosilicon compound constituent [C]. As the relatively expensive organosilicon compound constituent [D] is employed only during such the prepolymerization, even a small amount shows a sufficient effect thereof, resulting in reduced polymerization costs of a-olefins. Also in this case, the a-olefinpolymerwithahighstereoregularity, highmelt fluidity and wide molecular weight distribution exhibits goodmoldability and excellent property against appearance deficits of moldings such as flow marks.<br>
In the contact me thoding of the invention, the constituents<br><br>
[A], [B] and [C]; the constituents [A], [B], [C] and [D]; or the constituents [A], [B] and [D] are mixed for reaction at 0-100<br>
°C for 0.1-10 hours usually. Mixing order of the constituents is not limited particularly but a preferable one is found in order of the constituent [A], the constituent [B] and the constituent [C] ; or in order of the constituent [A], the constituent [B], the constituent [C] and the constituent [D]. After the contact methoding, the solid is cleansed, filtered and separated in an inactive hydrocarbon solvent such as n-heptane, then it is employed as the solid catalyst constituent in the prepolymerization or the main polymerization.<br>
The prepolymerization in the invention is achieved in the gas-phase polymerization method, the slurry polymerization method, and the bulk polymerization method. The solid produced through the prepolymerization is separated and then employed for the main polymerization, or it is successively subjected, without separation, to the main polymerization.<br>
A prepolymerization time is usually 0.1 to 10 hours. Preferably, prepolymerization is continued until a prepolymer is produced by 0.1 to 100 g per 1 g of the catalyst solid constituent. If less than 0.1 g per 1 g of the catalyst solid constituent, the main polymarization reaction rate is not sufficient, resulting in much catalytic residues, and insufficient stereoregularity of the a-olefin polymer. If more than 100 g, the polymerization reaction rate and the crystallinity of the a-olef in polymer may be lowered possibly. A prepolymerization temperature is 0 to 100 °C, preferably 10-70 °C in the presence of each catalyst constituent. When prepolymerization is performed at a high temperature over 50 °C, it is preferable to reduce an ethylene or a-olef in concentration or shorten the polymerization time. Otherwise, it is difficult to control the production of the prepolymer by 0 .1 to 100 g per 1 g of the catalyst solid constituent. In addition, the polymarization reaction rate may lower in the main<br>
polymerization, or the crystallinity of the a-olef in polymer produced may lower.<br><br>
An amount of the organoaluminum compound constituent [B] during the prepolymerization is usually 0.5 to 1000 in Al/Ti molar ratio relative to titanium in the solid catalyst constituent [A], preferably 1 to 100. An amount of the organosilicon compound constituent [C] is usually 0.01 to 5 in Si/Al molar ratio relative to aluminum in the constituent [B], preferably 0.05 to 1. An amount of a mixed constituent of the organosilicon compound constituent [C] and the organosilicon compound constituent [D] is usually 0.01 to 1 in Si/Al molar ratio relative to an aluminum atom in the constituent [B], preferably 0.08 to 0.5. Hydrogenmay be allowed to coexist during the prepolymerization, if required.<br>
In the present invention, if the organoaluminum compound constituent [B] is employed during the main polymerization, an amount of the constituent [B] is usually 0.1 to 1500 in Al/Ti molar ratio relative to a titanium atom in the solid catalyst constituent [A], preferably 30 to 1000.<br>
In the method of polymerizing a-olef ins according to the invention, the organosilicon compound constituents [C] and [D] are added, during the main polymerization of the a-olefin, in addition to the organoaluminum compound constituent [B], to further improve the polymarization reaction rate and improve the stereoregularity of the polymer.<br>
In the present invention, a chain transfer agent such as hydrogen may be employed. An amount of hydrogen to produce an a-olef in polymer with a desired stereoregularity, melting point and molecular weight can be determined appropriately based on a polymerization method and a polymerization condition. Usually, a hydrogen partial pressure is in a range equal to or below 3 MPa- In the present invention, to lower a heat seal temperature at a film, for the purpose of lowering a melting point and increasing transparency of the film, during polymerization of the a-olefin, a small amount of another a-olefin may be copolymerized.<br>
g-Olefin Propylene Block Copolymerization<br><br>
In order to improve the low-temperature impact strength of moldings from the a-olefin polymer, the so-called block copolymer can be produced by copolymerizing two or more kinds of a-olefins after homopolymerization of the a-olefin or copolymerization of the a-olefin with another a-olefin.<br>
In production of an a-olefin propylene block copolymer, a specific method includes a first step of homopolymerizing propylene, and a second step of block copolymerizing a combined<br>
monomer of propylene with an a-olefin other than propylene. The first and second steps may include multi-stage polymerization. The propylene produced in the first step has a melt flow rate ranging 0.1 to 2000, preferably 30 to 1000, and more preferably 100 to 700.<br>
The propylene produced in the first step has a stereoregularity in meso-pentad fraction (mmmm) of 97.5 % or more, preferably 98.0 % or more, and more preferably 98.2 % or more. The melting point (Tm) is 161 °C or more, preferably 162 °C or more, and more preferably 162.5 °C or more. The copolymer of propylene with the a-olefin other than propylene produced in the second step has a proportion (or block ratio « (Yield<br>
of the copolymer of propylene with the a-olefin other than propylene/Total polymer amount) x 100). The proportion has a range within 1 to 50 wt. %, preferably 5 to 35 wt. %, and more preferably 20 to 30 wt. %.<br>
The catalyst system of the invention provides good hydrogen response,  high  polymerization  reaction  rate,   high<br>
stereoregularity of the produced a-olefin polymer, and high melt fluidity. Particularly, in production of an ethylene-propylene copolymer, a constituent of propylene homopolymer is employed 80 to 70 wt. %, and a constituent of random copolymer of propylene with the a-olefin other than propylene is employed 20 to 30 wt. %. In this case, after melting and kneading, the constituent of random copolymer of propylene with the a-olefin other than propylene does not bleed out of the surface of the a-olefin propylene copolymer in structure. Thus, it is possible to provide an a-olefin propylene copolymer having a sea-island<br><br>
structure. The present material with less bleed-out can be provided as a composition with less stickiness and improved handling ability, and as a commodity product with a further increased commercial value.<br>
In the first step, hydrogen may be added as a chain transfer agent to adjust a molecular weight of the produced polymer, if required. An amount of hydrogen for production of the polymer having a desired stereoregularity (mmmm) and melt fluidity (MFR) can be determined appropriately based on a polymerization method and a polymerization condition. Generally, at a polymerization temperature, it corresponds to 0.005 to 1 MPa, preferably 0.01 to 0.7 MPa in gauge pressure.<br>
In the present invention, contacting order of each catalys t constituent is not limited particularly. Though it is not much preferable to allow the organosilicon compound of the constituent [ C ] to directly contact with the solid catalyst of the constituent [A] only.<br>
After the production of a crystalline polymer through propylene homopolymerization at the first step, propylene and an a-olefin other than propylene are subsequently copolymerized in gas-phase at the second step to produce a propylene block copolymer while the above catalyst system is not inactivated.<br>
The rubber-like copolymer of propylene and the a-olef in other than propylene produced at the second step has a proportion of 3 to 50 wt. % generally, and more preferably 5 to 40 wt. % on the basis of the amount of the entire block copolymer. Preferably, the a-olef in other than propylene in the rubber-like copolymer has a proportion of 10 to 50 wt. %.<br>
Hydrogen may be added to copolymerize in the second step. During the ethylene /propylene gas-phase polymerization reaction in the catalyst system of the present invention, methods of elevating a reaction temperature, adding an organoaluminum constituent, increasing a monomer pressure, determining different polymerization times for the first and second steps, and adding another donor constituent are generally known to improve polymerization reaction rate. In addition, coexistence<br><br>
of hydrogen can greatly improve polymerization reaction rate compared to the conventional catalyst system while maintaining high stereoregularity and high melt fluidity. As a result, an a-olefin polymer with high solidity and excellent melt fluidity can be produced at a higher productivity.<br>
The polymerization pattern of the invention may include a first step of bulk polymerization, in which a monomer in liquid state is employed as a solvent for polymerization therein; and a second step of gas-phase polymerization, in which a monomer in gas state is contact with a catalyst.<br>
Preferably, the bulk polymerization may be performed under such condition of temperature and pressure that can maintain the propylene monomer in liquid state. A polymerization temperature is generally 30 to 90 °C, preferably 50 to 80 °C. A polymerization time generally ranges from 5 minutes to 5 hours.<br>
The gas-phase polymerization may be performed under such condition of temperature and pressure that can maintain gaseous state after introduction of a mixed monomer of propylene and another a-olefin. The a-olefin includes non-cyclic mono-olefins, such as ethylene, butene-1, 3-methylbutene-l, 3-methylpentene-l, 4-methylpentene-l, hexyene-1, 4-methylhexyene-l, octene-1, styrene, 2-methystyrene, 3 -methyls tyrene, 4 -methyls tyrene, vinylcyclohexane, vinylcyclopentane, 2-vinylnaphthalene, and 9-vinylanthracene; cyclicmono-olefins,.such as cyclopentene, cyclohexene, and norbornene; and diolefins, such as dicyclopentadiene, 5-ethylidenenorbornene-2, 4-vinylcyclohexene, and 1,5-hexadiene.<br>
A copolymerization pressure generally ranges from atmospheric pressure to 3 MPa, preferably from atmospheric pressure to 1.5 MPa. A polymerization temperature generally ranges between 30 to 95 °C, preferably between 40 to 80 °C. A polymerization time generally ranges from 30 minutes to 10 hours, preferably between 1 to 5 hours.<br>
A catalyst solid consisting essentially of magnesium, titanium, a halogen element and an electron donor can be employed<br><br>
as the solid catalyst constituent [A]. In such the case, a limited amount of propylene may be prepolymerized prior to polymerization in the first step using the solid catalyst constituent [A] in the presence of the organoaluminum compound constituent [B] and the organosilicon compound constituent [C]. The prepolymerized solid or the prepolymerized and then cleansed solid may be employed in the main polymerization to improve polymerization reaction rate per solid catalyst and stereoregularity of the polymer.<br>
In the present invention, if the prepolymerized solid is employed as the solid catalyst constituent in the main polymerization, the constituent [C] can be-omitted from the main polymerization. The method and time of prepolymerization are same as those described above.<br>
The gas-phase polymerization of propylene with the a-olefin other than propylene performed subsequent to the homopolymerization of propylene produces a rubber constituent or a copolymer of propylene with the a-olef in other than propylene. The copolymer can be obtained as a copolymer that has a high<br>
a-olef in content, a high molecular weight, and good randomness. This block copolymer has an excellent low-temperature characteristic, solidity and impact resistance.<br>
g-Olefln Propylene Random Copolymerization<br>
The a-olef in polymerization or copolymerization catalyst according to the present invention can be employed in random copolymerization of a mixed monomer of propylene with an a-olef in other than propylene.<br>
The random copolymerization of the mixed monomer of propylene with the a-olefin other than propylene includes a slurry polymerization method, in which a nonpolar solvent is employed, such as propane, butane, hexane, heptane and octane. It also includes a gas-phase polymerization method, in which a monomer in gaseous state is employed for polymerization; and a bulk polymerization method, in which a monomer in liquid state is employed as a solvent. These polymerization methods may be<br><br>
performed by continuous polymerization or batch polymerization.<br>
In the present invention, propylene and at least one a-olefin are copolymerized to produce a copolymer. Alternatively, propylene and one a-olefin other than propylene may be copolymerized or propylene and two or more kinds of a-olefins other than propylene may be copolymerized. The a-olefin other than propylene includes ethylene, 1-butene, 3-methyl-l-butene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 1-hexyene, vinyl cyclohexane, cyclopentene, cycloheptene, norbornene, and 5-ethyl-2-norbornene. Among those, ethylene, 1-butene, 3-methyl-l-butene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 1-hexyene and others are preferable. When propylene and one a-olefin other than propylene are copolymerized, the other a-olefin is employed by preferably 0.005 to 0.17 mole, and more preferably 0.01 to 0.1 mole per one mole of propylene.<br>
A copolymerization pressure ranges between 0 .1 to 20 MPa, preferably 1 to 6 MPa. A polymerization temperature ranges between 10 to 150 °C, preferably 30 to 100 °C, and more preferably 60 to 90 °C. Polymerization time generally ranges between 0.1 to 10 hours, preferably 0.5 to 7 hours. Hydrogen may be added as a chain transfer agent to adjust a molecular weight of the produced polymer, if required. An amount of hydrogen to produce an a-olefin polymer with a desired stereoregularity andmolecular weight can be determined appropriately based on a polymerization method and a polymerization condition. In the present invention, after propylene or other a-olefins are prepolymerized in accordance with the above various polymerization methods, the prepolymerization catalyst may be employed for main polymerization. Preferably, in the presence of the constituents [A] and [B], or the constituents [A], [B] and [C], propylene or other a-olefins can be prepolymerized. A prepolymerization ratio ranges between 0.1 to 300, preferably 0.5 to 100 in weight ratio of Prepolymer/Constituent [A]. The prepolymerization can be performed in gas-phase, slurry and bulk methods. The solid constituent produced in prepolymerization may be separated and then employed in main polymerization or<br><br>
may be employed without separation in main polymerization. If the prepolymer is employed as a catalyst constituent in main polymerization, the constituent [C] may be omitted from main polymerization.<br>
The catalyst system of the invention provides good hydrogen response, high polymarization reaction rate, high stereoregularity of the produced a-olefin polymer, good randomness, and high melt fluidity. In particular, as hydrogen response is greatly improved compared to the conventional catalyst system, an a-olefin with high solidity and excellent melt fluidity can be produced without sacrifice of productivity. A highly transparent film can be produced because of good randomness. A film with no atactic constituent-originated stickiness can be produced because of high stereoregularity of the polypropylene part. The use of the catalyst system of the invention can provide production of an ethylene-propylene block copolymer with a block ratio of 10 to 50 wt. %, and production<br>
of a reactor-made TPO. The a-olefin polymer produced in the invention may be employed solely. In addition, it may be employed as a compound material, in blend with other plastics or elastomers, and in combination with reinforcements for inorganic and organic fillers such as glass fibers and talc, and other crystal nucleus agents. It can provide excellent performance, not particularly limited, to automobile and household electric structural materials.<br>

This is beneficial to thin the injected moldings .  The goodmelt fluidity thereof can shorten an injected<br><br>
molding cycle and eliminate appearance deficits of moldings typified by flow marks of injected moldings.

THE BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUR THE INVENTION Examples of the present invention shown in Tables 1-4 will now be described below. The present invention is not limited to the description of below-described Examples.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Diethylaminotriethoxysilane was synthesized as Example 1 in the following manner. First, into a four-necked flask (volume of 1L) equipped with a magnet seal agitator and a dropping funnel, a 100 mL of toluene, a 10 mL of tetrahydro furan, and a 14.6 g (0.2 mol) of diethylamine were introduced and then mixed and agitated. A Grignard reagent (titer =1.71 mol/L) is on the other hand supplied by 129 mL (0.22 mol) into the dropping funnel. Thereafter, while agitating/ the Grignard reagent is dropped from the dropping funnel into the flask at room temperature (air-cooling), spending 30 minutes. After completion of dropping, agitating was performed at 60 °C for one hour for Grignard exchange reaction. Then, a 41.7g (0.2 mol) of tetraethoxysilane previously introduced into the dropping funnel is dropped into the flask, spending 15 minutes. After completion of dropping, a reaction was performed at 60 °C for 2 hours. At this moment, a solid of magnesium ethoxy chloride deposited in the flask. The reacted solution was partly extracted to confirm the generation of the target product by gas chromatography. Then, in nitrogen ambient, the reacted solution in the flask was entirely transferred therefrom to a container equipped with a G4 glass filter for pressure filtration with low-pressure nitrogen (0.01 MPa). The filtered residue (magnesium ethoxy chloride) was cleansed and filtered with toluene repeatedly until the target product could not be confirmed in the filtrate. The filtrate and the mixed solution of the filtered residue and the cleanser were condensed under reduced pressure to settle and remove solvent constituents such as toluene, and subsequently distilled and purified to restore the target product. The target product is a liquid with a colorless transparent appearance, which has a boiling point of 57.5 °C/5 mmHg, and a GC purity of 98.0 %.

As the organosilicon compound constituent  [D],  a bis(perhydroisoquinolino)dimethoxysilane was employed. This bis(perhydroisoquinolino)dimethoxysilane was synthesized in the following manner. A stirrer piece was inserted into a 200 mL-volume, three-necked flask equipped with a dropping funnel. A vacuum pump was employed to substitute the inside of the flask sufficiently for nitrogen.  Then, 100 mL of distilled and dehydrated n-heptane and 17.9 mL (0.12 mol) of decahydro isoquinoline were supplied into the flask.  75 mL (0.12 mol) of 1. 6 M butyl lithium hexane solution was fed into the dropping funnel. While the temperature in the flask was maintained at 4 °C, the butyl lithium solution in the dropping funnel was slowly dropped therefrom into the flask. After dropping, agitating was subsequently performed at room temperature for 12 hours to obtain a lithium salt of perhydro isoquinoline. A stirrer piece was inserted into a glass filter-added flask (volume of 400 mL) equipped with a dropping funnel. A vacuum pump was employed to substitute the inside of the flask sufficiently for nitrogen. Then, 6 0 mL of distilled and dehydrated n-heptane and 9 mL (0.06 mol) of tetramethoxysilane were supplied into the flask. The<br><br>

At room temperature, the lithium salt of perhydro isoquinoline in the dropping funnel was slowly dropped therefrom into the flask. After dropping, subsequently agitating was performed at 40 °C for 2 hours and at room temperature for 12 hours. After the generation of the target product was confirmed by gas chromatography, the precipitated product was filtered. The solvent in this filtrate was sufficiently settled and removed under reduced pressure, followed by primary distillation and secondary distillation of the product for purification to obtain the target product or the bis (perhydro isoquinolino) dimethoxy silane. This compound was found to have a boiling point of 180<br>

In a product, 0.19 mmol of the catalyst constituent according to Comparative example 11 was employed as the constituent [C] instead of the organosilicon compound according to Example 1. In another product, the organosilicon compound according to Example 1 was employed as the constituent [C] , and the constituent<br>

The temperature inside the autoclave was elevated up to and maintained at 70 °C, and polymerization was performed for one hour. When hydrogen (0.40 MPa) was prepared, polymerization pressure was 3.8 MPa. After completion of polymerization, the non-reacted propylene gas was discharged, and the polymer was dried under reduced pressure at 60 °C for 20 hours to produce white powdery polypropylene.<br>

Thereafter, the constituent [A] was added by 0.37 mmol on a Ti atom basis (a molar ratio of Constituent [A]/ Constituent [B]/Constituent [D] = 1/3/0.5) followed by aging at 25 °C for 10 minutes. Then, prepolymerization was performed for 5 minutes under normal pressure, feeding a propylene gas into the flask continuously at a flow rate of 165 ml/min.

Mixed gas of ethylene and propylene was continuously supplied to the autoclave at a proportion of 0.7:1 in volume ratio (700 Ncc/min and 1000 Ncc/min, respectively) to adjust the copolymerization pressure at 1.2 MPa in gauge pressure. For copolymerization reactions at the same temperature under the same pressure, the non-reacted gas was discharged outside the system so as to hold the copolymerization pressure at 1.2 MPa in gauge pressure.<br><br>
followed by copolymerization reaction at 70 °C for 3 hours. During the copolymerization reaction (after 0.5 hour, one hour and two hours) , each 20 g of the polymer was extracted from inside the autoclave. The extracted copolymer was dried under reduced pressure at 60 °C for 20 hours to produce white powdery block copolymer. A proportion of the copolymer part in the total polymer (block ratio) was calculated and found 7.83 wt. % after 0.5 hour; 12.34 wt. % after one hour; 17.54 wt. % after 2 hours; and 20.65 wt. % after 3 hours. A flowchart of an adjustment method and polymerization method of the catalyst constituents for use in Experimental example 9 is shown in Fig. 12. Polymerization results and characteristics of the resultant copolymers are shown in Tables 16-18.<br>
Similarly, propylene block copolymer was produced except for addition of a diethylamino triethoxy silane as the constituent [C] by 0.125 mmol and a bis(perhydro isoguinolino) dimethoxy silane as the constituent [D] by 0.125 mmol, as the catalyst constituent. Polymerization results and characteristics of the resultant copolymer are shown in Tables 16-18.<br>

Polymerization results and characteristics of the resultant copolymer are shown in Tables 16-18.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
It is found that when, the catalyst constituents of Comparative examples 3, 6, 8, 9 and 13 are employed, the block copolymers have lower MFR and worse melt fluidity than when the organosilicon compound according to Example 1 is employed solely or in addition to the constituent [D] . It is further found that as the ethylene content is low in the rubber constituent, the ethylene reactivity is inferior.<br><br>
It is found that when the catalyst constituent of Comparative examples 6 is employed, the block copolymer has lower MFR and worse melt fluidity than when the organosilicon compound according to Example 1 is employed solely or in addition to the constituent [D]. It is further found that as the ethylene content is low in the rubber constituent, the ethylene reactivity is inferior.<br>
It is found from the above results that, the use of the diethylaminotriethoxysilane as the constituent [C] in the ethylene-propylene block copolymer can achieve the most excellent performance on balanced stereoregularity, hydrogen response, melt fluidity of block copolymers, and reactivity of ethylene.<br>

After cooling the inside of the autoclave down to 10 °C, agitating was initiated and prepolymerization was performed for 10 minutes . Subsequently, the temperature inside the autoclave was elevated up to 7 0 °C, then polymerization was performed at 70 °C for one hour under polymerization pressure of 3.8 MPa.  After completion of<br><br>

polypropylene.<br><second step: gas-phase ethylene copolymerization><br>
After completion of bulk polymerization, in which the pressure in the system was held at 0.02 MPa in gauge pressure, the temperature in the autoclave was set at 70 °C.
