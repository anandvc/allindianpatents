RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application is a non-provisional filing of a provisional application,<br>
U.S. Serial No. 60/863,698, filed on October 31, 2006.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to methods of preparing antimicrobial lenses<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Contact lenses have been used commercially to improve vision since the<br>
1950s. The first contact lenses were made of hard materials. They were used by<br>
a patient during waking hours and removed for cleaning. Current developments in<br>
the field gave rise to soft contact lenses, which may be worn continuously, for<br>
several days or more without removal for cleaning. Although many patients favor<br>
these lenses due to their increased comfort, these lenses can cause some<br>
adverse reactions to the user. The extended use of the lenses can encourage the<br>
buildup of bacteria or other microbes, particularly, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, on<br>
the surfaces of soft contact lenses. The build-up of bacteria and other microbes<br>
can cause adverse side effects such as contact lens acute red eye and the like.<br>
Although the problem of bacteria and other microbes is most often associated with<br>
the extended use of soft contact lenses, the build-up of bacteria and other<br>
microbes occurs for users of hard contact lens wearers as well.<br>
US 5,820,918 discloses medical devices made from a water absorbable<br>
polymer material with a medical compound having low solubility in aqueous<br>
solutions such as an antiseptic or radiopaque compound. However, the<br>
procedures disclosed in the examples yield opaque devices which are not suitable<br>
for ophthalmic devices such as contact lenses.<br>
Therefore, there is a need to produce contact lenses that inhibit the growth<br>
of bacteria or other microbes and/or the adhesion of bacteria or other microbes on<br>
the surface of contact lenses. Further there is a need to produce contact lenses<br>
which do not promote the adhesion and/or growth of bacteria or other microbes on<br>
the surface of the contact lenses. Also there is a need to produce contact lenses<br>
that inhibit adverse responses related to the growth of bacteria or other microbes.<br><br>
Still further there is a need to produce the foregoing contact lenses in a manner<br>
that produces a lens of clarity suitable to permit a user to clearly see from said<br>
lenses. These needs are met by the following invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention includes a method of preparing an antimicrobial lens<br>
comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of a metal salt, wherein said<br>
method comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of the steps of<br>
(a)	treating a cured lens, with a salt precursor and<br>
(b)	treating the lens of step (a) with a dispersing agent and a metal agent.<br>
As used herein, the term, "antimicrobial lens" means a lens that exhibits one or<br>
more of the following properties, the inhibition of the adhesion of bacteria or other<br>
microbes to the lenses, the inhibition of the growth of bacteria or other microbes<br>
on lenses, and the killing of bacteria or other microbes on the surface of lenses or<br>
in an area surrounding the lenses. For purposes of this invention, adhesion of<br>
bacteria or other microbes to lenses, the growth of bacteria or other microbes on<br>
lenses and the presence of bacteria or other microbes on the surface of lenses<br>
are collectively referred to as "microbial colonization." Preferably, the lenses of<br>
the invention exhibit a reduction of viable bacteria or other microbe of at least<br>
about 0.25 log, more preferably at least about 0.5 log, most preferably at least<br>
about 1.0 log (≥ 90% inhibition). Such bacteria or other microbes include but are<br>
not limited to those organisms found in the eye, particularly Pseudomonas<br>
aeruginosa, Acanthamoeba species, Staphylococcus, aureus, Escherichia, coli,<br>
Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Serratia marcesens.<br>
As use herein, the term "metal salt" means any molecule having the<br>
general formula [M]a [X]b wherein X contains any negatively charged ion, a is ≥ 1,<br>
b is ≥ 1 and M is any positively charged metal selected from, but not limited to, the<br>
following Al+3, Co+2, Co+3, Ca+2, Mg+2, Ni+2, Ti+2, Ti+3, Ti+4, V+2, V+3, V+5, Sr+2, Fe+2.<br>
Fe+3, Ag+2, Ag+1, Au+2, Au+3, Au+1, Pd+2, Pd+4, Pt+2, Pt+4, Cu+1, Cu+2, Mn+2, Mn+3,<br>
Mn*4, Zn+2, and the like. Examples of X include but are not limited to CO3-2, NO3-1,<br>
P04-3, CI-1, I-1, Br-1, S-2, O-2 and the like. Further X includes negatively charged<br>
ions containing CO3-2 NO3-1, PO4-3, CI-1, I-1, Br-1, S-2, O-2, and the like, such as<br>
C1-5alkylCO2-1. As used herein the term metal salts does not include zeolites,<br><br>
disclosed in WO03/011351. This patent application is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in its entirety. The preferred a is 1, 2, or 3. The preferred b is 1, 2, or 3.<br>
The preferred metals ions are Mg+2, Zn+2, Cu+1 Cu+2, Au+2, Au+3, Au+1, Pd+2, Pd+4,<br>
Pt+2, Pt+4, Ag+2, and Ag+1. The particularly preferred metal ion is Ag+1. Examples<br>
of suitable metal salts include but are not limited to manganese sulfide, zinc oxide,<br>
zinc sulfide, copper sulfide, and copper phosphate. Examples of silver salts<br>
include but are not limited to silver nitrate, silver sulfate, silver iodate, silver<br>
carbonate, silver phosphate, silver sulfide, silver chloride, silver bromide, silver<br>
iodide, and silver oxide. The preferred silver salts are silver iodide, silver chloride,<br>
and silver bromide. The lenses of the invention are ophthalmic lenses (a detailed<br>
description of these lenses follows) and the clarity of the lenses is of concern to<br>
users. In order to produce lenses having a clarity suitable for ophthalmic<br>
purposes, it is preferred that the diameter of the metal salt particles is less than<br>
about ten microns (10 nm), more preferably less than about 1 μm, even more<br>
preferably less than about 400 nm. Particle size of the metal salt in the<br>
antimicrobial lens may be determined by the following test.<br>
The samples for scanning electron microscopy ("SEM") were prepared<br>
for profile analyses by mounting the whole lens vertically in a 25 mm diameter<br>
aluminum holder that had been cut in half and drilled and tapped for two<br>
machine screws to clamp the specimen. The lens was clamped so that half of<br>
the material was above the surface of the holder. A clean single edge razor<br>
was then used to slice the lens in half in one smooth stroke to avoid tearing the<br>
cut surface. These samples were then carbon coated in a vacuum evaporator<br>
to ensure conductivity. The far edge of these samples was daubed with<br>
colloidal carbon paint for better conductivity.<br>
Samples were prepared for surface analyses by taking the remaining<br>
half of the lens and slicing a strip from near the diameter that was then carefully<br>
placed on a 25 mm diameter holder, with two double sided carbon "sticky tabs"<br>
on the top surface, with the concave surface up. Lens surfaces were also<br>
analyzed on the convex surface by mounting the remaining chord of lens<br>
material convex side up also on two "sticky tabs". In both cases, a sheet of<br>
clean Teflon material (.032" thick) was used to press the contact lens flat to the<br>
carbon "sticky tabs". These samples were also coated with 20-40 nm of Spec-<br><br>
Pure graphite in a carbon vacuum evaporator. The far edge of these samples<br>
was daubed with colloidal carbon paint for better conductivity.<br>
Three images (left, middle and right) were taken from both convex and<br>
concave surfaces of each lens at various magnifications. Profile images taken<br>
at magnifications, 5000 x and 12,500x. For each position (left, middle or right)<br>
of the lens piece, about 5 to 10 images were taken starting at the convex end of<br>
the lens to the concave end depending upon the thickness of the lens. The<br>
images were "stitched" together to obtain the silver iodide particle size and<br>
distribution information inside the lens.<br>
Particle size distribution measurements for both surface and profiles<br>
were extracted from 5000x images using Scion Image analysis software. The<br>
results were compiled from three lenses of each lot.<br>
All the images were taken with 5kV beam energy. Though both<br>
secondary electron (SE) and back scattered electron (BSE) images were<br>
obtained, only BSE images at 5000x were used for particle size analysis due to<br>
high contrast obtained for the silver iodide particles compared to the<br>
background.<br>
The amount of metal in the lenses is measured based upon the total<br>
weight of the lenses. When the metal is silver, the preferred amount of silver is<br>
about 0.00001 weight percent (0.1 ppm) to about 10.0 weight percent,<br>
preferably about 0.0001 weight percent (1 ppm) to about 1.0 weight percent,<br>
most preferably about 0.001 weight percent (10 ppm) to about 0.1 weight<br>
percent, based on the dry weight of the lens. With respect to adding metal<br>
salts, the molecular weight of the metal salts determines the conversion of<br>
weight percent of metal ion to metal salt. The preferred amount of silver salt is<br>
about 0.00003 weight percent (0.3 ppm) to about 30.0 weight percent,<br>
preferably about 0.0003 weight percent (3 ppm) to about 3.0 weight percent,<br>
most preferably about 0.003 weight percent (30 ppm) to about 0.3 weight<br>
percent, based on the dry weight of the lens.<br>
The term "salt precursor" refers to any compound or composition that<br>
contains a cation that may be substituted with metal ions. The concentration of<br>
salt precursor in its solution is between about 0.00001 to about 10.0 weight<br>
percent, (0.1 -100,000 ppm) more preferably about 0.0001 to about 1.0 weight<br><br>
percent, (1-10,000 ppm) most preferably about 0.001 to about 0.1 weight percent<br>
(10-1000 ppm) based upon the total weight of the solution. Examples of salt<br>
precursors include but are not limited to inorganic molecules such as sodium<br>
chloride, sodium iodide, sodium bromide, sodium sulfide, lithium chloride, lithium<br>
iodide, lithium bromide, lithium sulfide, potassium bromide, potassium chloride,<br>
potassium sulfide, potassium iodide, rubidium iodide, rubidium bromide, rubidium<br>
chloride, rubidium sulfide, caesium iodide, caesium bromide, caesium chloride,<br>
caesium sulfide, calcium chloride, calcium bromide, calcium iodide, calcium<br>
sulfide, magnesium chloride, magnesium bromide, magnesium iodide,<br>
magnesium sulfide, sodium tetrachloro argentate, and the like. Examples of<br>
organic molecules include but are not limited to tetra-alkyl ammonium lactate,<br>
tetra-alkyl ammonium sulfate, quaternary ammonium halides, such as tetra-alkyl<br>
ammonium chloride, bromide or iodide. The preferred salt precursor is selected<br>
from the group consisting of sodium chloride, sodium iodide, sodium bromide,<br>
lithium chloride, lithium sulfide, sodium sulfide, potassium sulfide, potassium<br>
iodide, and sodium tetrachloro argentite and the particularly preferred salt<br>
precursor is sodium iodide.<br>
The term "metal agent" refers to any composition (including aqueous<br>
solutions) containing metal ions. Examples of such compositions include but<br>
are not limited to aqueous or organic solutions of silver nitrate, silver triflate, or<br>
silver acetate, silver tetrafluoroborate, silver sulfate, zinc acetate, zinc sulfate,<br>
copper acetate, and copper sulfate, where the concentration of metal agent in<br>
solution is about 1μg/mL or greater. The preferred metal agent is aqueous<br>
silver nitrate, where the concentration of silver nitrate is the solution is about<br>
greater than or equal to 0.0001 to about 2 weight percent (1 ppm-20,000 ppm),<br>
more preferably about greater than 0.001 to about 0.1 weight percent (10 ppm-<br>
1,000 ppm) based on the total weight of the solution. The term "treating"<br>
refers to any method of contacting the metal agent or salt precursor with the<br>
lens, where the preferred method is immersing the lens in a solution of the<br>
metal agent or the salt precursor. Treating can include heating the lens in a<br>
solution of the metal agent or the salt precursor, but it preferred that treating is<br>
carried out at ambient temperatures. The time of this treatment can last<br><br>
anywhere from about 30 seconds to about 24 hours, preferably from about 30<br>
seconds to about 15 minutes.<br>
As used herein, the term "dispersing agent" refers to a composition that<br>
may be used modulate the interaction between polymers and particles, particularly<br>
metal salts that are admixed with such polymers. Examples of dispersing agents<br>
include but are not limited to polyvinylpyrrolidone ("PVP"), polyvinylalcohol ("PVA")<br>
and derivatives, glycerine, and polyethylene oxide ("PEO"). Other dispersing<br>
agents that may be used are nitrogen-containing polymers such as but not limited<br>
to poly(dimethyl acrylamide), poly(N-vinyl-N-methylacetamide). Certain non-<br>
polymeric materials containing nitrogen and/or sulfur may be used as dispersing<br>
agents as well, such as cysteine, methionine, sodium sulfide, sodium thiosulfate,<br>
sodium thiocyanate. The particularly preferred dispersing agent is PVP. A variety<br>
of weights of PVP are commercially available. The K systems is used to<br>
distinguish one molecular weight of PVP from another. The preferred K value is<br>
K90. It is preferred that the dispensing agent and the metal agent are mixed<br>
together with a suitable solvent, such as water, deionized water, alcohols and<br>
mixtures thereof, to produce a clear solution of those components. If the metal<br>
agent is contained within an aqueous solution, the preferred amount of dispersing<br>
agent in the solution is about 0.1 % to about 50%, more preferably about 4% to<br>
about 10%, even more preferably about 2.5% to about 6%, most preferably about<br>
5%. In some embodiments the molar ratio of dispersing agent unit to metal agent<br>
is at least about 1.5, at least about 2, and in some embodiments at least about 4.<br>
It is believed that the dispersing agent in the metal agent solution forms<br>
a complex with the metal agent. In this embodiment, it is desirable to allow the<br>
metal agent to fully complex with the dispersing agent prior to combining the<br>
metal agent solution with the cured lens. "Fully complexed" means that<br>
substantially all the metal ions have complexed with at least one dispersing<br>
agent. "Substantially all" means at least about 90%, and in some embodiments<br>
at least about 95% of said metal ions have complexed with at least one<br>
dispersing agent.<br>
The complex-forming time may be monitored in solution via<br>
spectroscopy, such as via UV-VIS or FTIR. The spectra of the metal agent<br>
solution without the dispersing agent is measured. The spectra of the metal<br><br>
agent solution is monitored after addition of the dispersing agent, and the<br>
change in spectra is monitored. The complex-forming time is the time at which<br>
the spectral change plateaus.<br>
Alternatively, complexation time may be measured empirically by forming a<br>
series of metal agent-dispersing agent solutions having the same concentration,<br>
allowing each solution to mix for a different time and mixing each metal agent-<br>
dispersing agent solution batch-wise with the salt precursor solution. The metal<br>
agent-dispersing agent solutions which are mixed for complex-forming times will<br>
form clear solutions when the metal agent and salt precursor solutions are poured<br>
together directly without controlling the rate of addition.<br>
Complexation conditions include complexation time (discussed above),<br>
temperature, ratio of the dispersing agent to the metal agent and stirring rates.<br>
Increasing the temperature, molar ratio of dispersing agent to metal agent and<br>
stirring rate, will decrease complexation time. Those of skill in the art will, with<br>
reference to the teachings herein, can vary the conditions to achieve the<br>
disclosed complexation levels.<br>
As used herein, the term "lens" refers to an ophthalmic device that resides<br>
in or on the eye. These devices can provide any of all of the following effects,<br>
optical correction, wound care, drug delivery, diagnostic functionality, cosmetic<br>
enhancement, and the like. The term lens includes but is not limited to soft<br>
contact lenses, hard contact lenses, intraocular lenses, overlay lenses, ocular<br>
inserts, and optical inserts. Soft contact lenses are made from silicone elastomers<br>
or hydrogels, which include but are not limited to silicone hydrogels, and<br>

In addition to soft contact lens formulations, hard contact lenses may be<br>
used. Examples of hard contact lens formulations are made from polymers that<br>
include but are not limited to polymers of polymethylmethacrylate, silicon<br>
acrylates, silicone acrylates, fluoroacrylates, fluoroethers, polyacetylenes, and<br>
polyimides, where the preparation of representative examples may be found in JP<br>
200010055, JP 6123860 and U.S. Patent 4,330,383. Intraocular lenses of the<br>
invention can be formed using known materials. For example, the lenses may be<br>
made from a rigid material including, without limitation, polymethyl methacrylate,<br>
polystyrene, polycarbonate, or the like, and combinations thereof. Additionally,<br>
flexible materials may be used including, without limitation, hydrogels, silicone<br>
materials, acrylic materials, fluorocarbon materials and the like, or combinations<br>
thereof. Typical intraocular lenses are described in WO 0026698, WO 0022460,<br>
WO 9929750, WO 9927978, WO 0022459, and JP 2000107277. U.S. 4,301,012;<br>

this application are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
It has been found that when the metal salt is incorporated in accordance<br>
with the teachings of the present invention, ophthalmic devices that are<br><br>
substantially free from unwanted haze are produced. Preferably, the lenses of<br>
the invention are optically clear, with optical clarity comparable to lenses such<br>
as lenses made from etafilcon A, genfilcon A, galyfilcon A, lenefilcon A,<br>
polymacon, acquafilcon A, balafilcon A, and lotrafilcon A. Specifically, lenses of<br>
the present invention have a percent haze that is less than about 200%,<br>
preferably less than about 150%, more preferably less than about 100%, even<br>
more preferably less than 30%, even more preferably, between less than about<br>
30% and about 9%.<br>
The percentage of haze is measured using the following method. A<br>
hydrated test lens in borate buffered saline (SSPS) is placed in a clear 20 x 40<br>
x 10 mm glass cell at ambient temperature above a flat black background,<br>
illuminating from below with a fiber optic lamp (Titan Tool Supply Co. fiber optic<br>
light with 0.5" diameter light guide set at a power setting of 4-5.4) at an angle<br>
66° normal to the lens cell, and capturing an image of the lens from above,<br>
normal to the lens cell with a video camera (DVC 1300C:19130 RGB camera<br>
with Navitar TV Zoom 7000 zoom lens) placed 14 mm above the lens platform.<br>
The background scatter is subtracted from the scatter of the lens by subtracting<br>
an image of a blank cell using EPIX XCAP V 1.0 software. The subtracted<br>
scattered light image is quantitatively analyzed, by integrating over the central<br>
10 mm of the lens, and then comparing to a -1.00 diopter CSI Thin Lens®,<br>
which is arbitrarily set at a haze value of 100, with no lens set as a haze value<br>
of 0. Five lenses are analyzed and the results are averaged to generate a haze<br>
value as a percentage of the standard CSI lens.<br>
The term "cured" refers to any of a number of methods used to react a<br>
mixture of lens components (ie, momoner, prepolymers, macromers and the<br>
like) to form lenses. Lenses can be cured by light or heat. The preferred<br>
method of curing is with radiation, preferably UV or visible light, and most<br>
preferably with visible light. The lens formulations of the present invention can<br>
be formed by any of the methods known to those skilled in the art, such as<br>
shaking or stirring, and used to form polymeric articles or devices by known<br>
methods.<br>
For example, the antimicrobial lenses of the invention may be prepared<br>
by mixing reactive components and any diluent(s) with a polymerization initator<br><br>
and curing by appropriate conditions to form a product that can be<br>
subsequently formed into the appropriate shape by lathing, cutting and the like.<br>
Alternatively, the reaction mixture may be placed in a mold and subsequently<br>
cured into the appropriate article.<br>
Various processes are known for processing the lens formulation in the<br>
production of contact lenses, including spincasting and static casting.<br>
Spincasting methods are disclosed in U.S. 3,408,429 and 3,660,545, and static<br>
casting methods are disclosed in U.S. 4,113,224 and 4,197,266. The preferred<br>
method for producing antimicrobial lenses of this invention is by molding. In the<br>
case of hydrogel lenses, for this method, the lens formulation is placed in a<br>
mold having the approximate shape of the final desired lens, and the lens<br>
formulation is subjected to conditions whereby the components polymerize, to<br>
produce a hardened disc that is subjected to a number of different processing<br>
steps including treating the polymerized lens with liquids (such as water,<br>
inorganic salts, or organic solutions) to swell, or otherwise equilibrate this lens<br>
prior to enclosing the lens in its final packaging. These methods are further<br>
described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,495,313; 4,680,336; 4,889,664; and 5,039,459,<br>
which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Polymerized lenses that<br>
have not been swelled or otherwise equilibrated are considered cured lenses<br>
for purposes of this invention.<br>

Although haze is one measurement of the clarity of a lens, a lens can have<br>
low overall clarity, but can contain localized areas of deposited metal agents<br>
("localized areas of deposition"). One of the advantages of the lenses of the<br>
invention and the methods to produce them is a reduction in the localized areas of<br>
deposition. This can be demonstrated by dark field microscopy according the<br>
following methods.<br>
The hydrated test lens to be inspected is placed in a crystallization dish<br>
from Kimble Glass, Inc. [KIMAX 23000 5035, 50x35mm]. Borate buffered sodium<br>
sulfate solution (SSPS, 10-12 mL) filtered through a 
dish. The lens is placed close to the center of the dish to minimize artifacts in the<br>
image resulting from reflected light. A Nikon SMZ 1500 microscope is used for the<br>
test. The dish containing the lens is placed on the light stage. The light source is<br>
set to the highest intensity, and the microscope is set in D.F. (Dark Field) mode.<br>
The light aperture on the microscope is completely opened. The software used to<br>
capture the images is called 'Aquinto made by http://www.olympus-sis.com/',<br>
(formerly known as Aquinto). A Nikon DXM1200F digital camera is used to<br>
capture images with the following camera settings (set in Program Aquinto):<br>
'Exposure time' = 53.0555 ms, 'Color Filter' = 'gray', 'Capture Mode' =<br>
'960x768','Mirror horz', 'Mirror vert', 'Logarithmic', and 'Auto refresh' are<br>
deselected. Under the' Optimize' tab (in Program Aquinto) all filter settings are set<br>
to 'No filter'. The captured images are evaluated to look for areas of localized<br>
deposition.<br><br>
In order to illustrate the invention the following examples are included.<br>
These examples do not limit the invention. They are meant only to suggest a<br>
method of practicing the invention. Those knowledgeable in contact lenses as<br>
well as other specialties may find other methods of practicing the invention.<br>
However, those methods are deemed to be within the scope of this invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following abbreviations were used in the examples<br>
Sodium Sulfate packing solution (SSPS)<br>
SSPS contains the following in deionized H2O:<br>
1.40 weight % sodium sulfate<br>
0.185 weight % sodium borate [1330-43-4], Mallinckrodt<br>
0.926 weight % boric acid [10043-35-3], Mallinckrodt<br>
0.005 weight % methylcellulose<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of Antimicrobial Lenses From Cured Lenses<br>
Cured and hydrated galyfilcon A lenses are placed in a jar with sodium<br>
iodide solution in deionized water, containing 50ppm of methylcellulose (~3mL<br>
solution per lens,) and rolled on a jar roller overnight. The lenses were<br>
transferred from the jar to a blister pack where the excess sodium iodide<br>
solution was removed. A solution (800 μL) of silver nitrate in deionized water,<br>
containing the appropriate dispersion agent, was added to the blister for two to<br>
five minutes. The silver nitrate solution was removed, and the lenses were<br>
placed in a jar containing deionized water and rolled on a jar roller for<br>
approximately thirty minutes. The deionized water was replaced with borate<br>
buffered sodium sulfate solution containing 50 ppm methylcellulose in water<br>
(SSPS), and allowed to roll on the jar roller for an additional 30 minutes. The<br>
solution was then replaced with fresh SSPS.<br>
The lenses were then transferred to new blisters and dosed with 950 (iL of<br>
SSPS. The blisters were sealed and autoclaved at 125°C for 18 minutes and<br>
analyzed for haze using the methods described herein and silver content using<br>
the methods described below. The results are presented in Table 1. This data<br>
shows that the addition of dispersion agents reduces the Haze% or improves lens-<br><br>
to-lens haze uniformity, as demonstrated by reduced standard deviation.<br>
Silver content of the lenses after lens autoclaving was determined by<br>
Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis "INAA". INAA is a qualitative and<br>
quantitative elemental analysis method based on the artificial induction of<br>
specific radionuclides by irradiation with neutrons in a nuclear reactor.<br>
Irradiation of the sample is followed by the quantitative measurement of the<br>
characteristic gamma rays emitted by the decaying radionuclides. The gamma<br>
rays detected at a particular energy are indicative of a particular radionuclide's<br>
presence, allowing for a high degree of specificity. Becker, D. A.; Greenberg,<br>
R.R.; Stone, S. F. J. Radioanal. Nucl. Chem. 1992, 160(1), 41-53; Becker, D.<br>
A.; Anderson, D. L; Lindstrom, R. M.; Greenberg, R. R.; Garrity, K. M.;<br>
Mackey, E. A. J. Radioanal. Nucl. Chem. 1994, 179(1), 149-54. The INAA<br>
procedure used to quantify silver content in contact lens material uses the<br>
following two nuclear reactions:<br>
1.	In the activation reaction, 1l0Ag is produced from stable 109Ag<br>
(isotopic abundance = 48.16 %) after capture of a radioactive neutron<br>
produced in a nuclear reactor.<br>
2.	In the decay reaction, 110Ag (t1/2 = 24.6 seconds) decays primarily by<br>
negatron emission proportional to initial concentration with an energy<br>
characteristic to this radio- nuclide (657.8 keV).<br>
The gamma-ray emission specific to the decay of 110Ag from irradiated, standards<br>
and samples are measured by gamma-ray spectroscopy, a well-established<br>
pulse-height analysis technique, yielding a measure of the concentration of the<br>
analyte.<br><br><br><br>
