The present invention relates to a method for preparing a compound one or more neutral,<br>
positive, or negative increased binding energy hydrogen species.<br>
This invention relates  to a new composition  of matter comprising a hydride  ion  having  a  binding energy  greater  than  about   0.8 eV (hereinafter  "hydrino  hydride ion").    The new  hydride ion  may  also  be combined with a cation, such as a proton, to yield novel compounds.<br>
2.    Background of the Invention 2.1     Hydrinos A hydrogen atom having a binding energy given  by<br>
Binding Energy <br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where   p is an integer greater than  1, preferably from 2 to 200, is disclosed in Mills, R., The Grand Unified Theory of Classical Quantum Mechanics. September  1996 Edition (" '96 Mills GUT"), provided by BlackLight Power, Inc.. Great Valley Corporate Center, 41  Great Valley Parkway.  Malvern,  PA   19355;  and  in  prior applications PCT/US96/07949,   PCT/US94/02219,   PCT/US91/8496,   and PCT/US90/1998,   the  entire   disclosures   of  which   are   all   incorporated herein  by  reference  (hereinafter "Mills  Prior Publications").     The  binding energy,    of an atom, ion or molecule, also known as the ionization energy, is the energy required to remove one electron from the atom, ion or molecule.<br>
A hydrogen atom having the binding energy given in Eq.  (1) is hereafter referred to as a hydrino  atom   or  hydrino.     The designation for<br>
a hydrino of radius  where   aH  is the radius of an ordinary hydrogen<br>
atom and   p is an integer, is  A hydrogen atom with a radius aH is<br>
      hereinafter  referred  to  as   "ordinary  hydrogen  atom"   or  "normal hydrogen atom."     Ordinary atomic  hydrogen is  characterized by  its binding energy of  13.6 eV.<br>
Hydrinos  are  formed by reacting  an  ordinary  hydrogen  atom  with  a catalyst having a net enthalpy of reaction of about<br>
	(Equation Removed)<br>
where   m  is an integer.<br>
"    This  catalysis  releases  energy  with  a  commensurate  decrease  in size of the hydrogen atom,  rn=naH.    For example, the catalysis of H(n=1)<br>
to H(n = 1/2)  releases  40.8 eV,  and the  hydrogen  radius  decreases  from   alt<br>
     to One such catalytic system involves potassium.    The second<br>
ionization energy  of potassium is  31.63 eV and K+  releases  4.34 eV  when it is reduced to  K.    The combination of reactions  K+ to K2+ and K- to K, then, has a net enthalpy of reaction of 27.28 eV, which is equivalent to m = 1 in Eq. (2).<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The  overall  reaction  is<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The energy  given  off during  catalysis  is  much  greater than  the  energy<br>
2	5     lost to the catalyst.    The energy released is large as compared to<br>
conventional  chemical  reactions.     For example,  when   hydrogen  and oxygen   gases  undergo  combustion  to  form  water<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
the  known  enthalpy  of formation  of water is  Î”H = -286 kJ I mole or 1.48 eV 30     per hydrogen atom.    By contrast, each (H = 1)   ordinary   hydrogen   atom<br>
undergoing catalysis releases a net of 40.8 eV.    Moreover, further catalytic<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
transitions  may occurand so on.    Once catalysis<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
begins,  hydrinos  autocatalyze  further in  a process  called disproportionation.    This mechanism is similar to that of an inorganic ion catalysis.    But, hydrino catalysis should have a higher reaction rate than that of the inorganic ion catalyst due to the better match of the enthalpy to m-27.2 eV.<br>
2.2    Hydride Ions<br>
A  hydride  ion comprises  two indistinguishable  electrons  bound  to  a proton.    Alkali  and alkaline earth hydrides react violently  with water to release hydrogen gas which burns in air ignited by the heat of the reaction  with  water.     Typically  metal hydrides  decompose  upon  heating at a temperature well below the melting point of the parent metal.<br>

A  method  is provided  for preparing a compound  comprising at least  one  increased  binding  energy  hydride  ion.     Such  compounds  are hereinafter  referred   to  as   "hydrino  hydride  compounds".     The   method comprises  reacting  atomic  hydrogen  with  a catalyst  having  a  net enthalpy of reaction of about   where m is  an integer greater than<br>
1,  preferably  an  integer less than 400,  to produce  an increased binding<br>

The  increased  binding  energy hydride ion is reacted with one or more cations to produce a compound comprising  at  least one  increased binding energy  hydride  ion.<br>
The invention is also directed to a reactor for producing increased binding energy  hydrogen  compounds of the  invention,  such  as  hydrino hydride compounds.    Such a reactor is hereinafter referred to as a "hydrino hydride  reactor".    The hydrino hydride reactor comprises  a cell for making  hydrinos and an electron source.    The reactor  produces hydride ions having the binding energy of Eq. (7).    The cell for making hydrinos may take the form of an electrolytic cell, a gas cell, a gas discharge cell, or a plasma torch cell, for example.    Each of these cells comprises:  a source of atomic hydrogen; at least one of a solid, molten, liquid, or gaseous catalyst for making hydrinos; and  a vessel  for reacting hydrogen  and  the  catalyst  for making hydrinos.     As  used  herein  and  as contemplated  by   the   subject   invention,   the  term   "hydrogen",   unless specified  otherwise,  includes  not only protium  ('H),    but also deuterium and  tritium.     Electrons  from  the  electron  source  contact  the  hydrinos  and react  to  form  hydrino  hydride  ions.<br>
The  reactors  described  herein  as  "hydrino  hydride  reactors"   are capable  of producing  not only  hydrino hydride  ions  and  compounds,  but also  the  other increased  binding energy  hydrogen compounds  of the present  invention.     Hence,   the  designation  "hydrino  hydride  reactors" should not  be  understood as being limiting with respect to the nature of the   increased   binding   energy   hydrogen   compound   produced.<br>
In  the electrolytic  cell,  hydrinos are reduced (i.e.  gain  an electron) to form hydrino hydride ions by contacting any of the following   1.) a cathode, 2.) a reductant which comprises the cell, 3.) any  of the reactor components,  or 4.) a reductant extraneous to the operation  of the cell  (i.e. a consumable  reductant added  to the cell from  an  outside  source)  (items 2.-4.   are  hereinafter,  collectively  referred  to  as  "the  hydrino  reducing reagent").     In the gas cell, the hydrinos are reduced to hydrino hydride ions by the hydrino reducing reagent.    In the gas discharge cell, the<br>
hydrinos  are  reduced  to hydrino hydride  ions  by   1.)  contacting  the cathode;  2.) reduction by plasma electrons,  or 3.)  contacting  the  hydrino reducing reagent.     In the plasma torch cell,  the hydrinos  are reduced  to hydrino hydride  ions by   1.)  reduction by plasma electrons,  or 2.) contacting  the  hydrino reducing reagent.     In  one embodiment,  the electron  source  comprising  the hydrino  hydride  ion  reducing  reagent  is effective  only  in  the presence  of hydrino  atoms.<br>
According  to  one aspect of the present invention,  novel  compounds are  formed from  hydrino hydride ions  and cations.     In the  electrolytic cell, the cation may be either an oxidized species of the material of the cell cathode or anode, a cation of an added reductant, or a cation of the electrolyte (such as a cation comprising the catalyst).    The cation of the electrolyte may be a cation of the catalyst.    In the gas cell, the cation is an oxidized species of the material of the cell, a cation comprising the molecular   hydrogen   dissociation   material   which   produces   atomic hydrogen,  a cation  comprising  an  added  reductant,  or a cation  present  in the cell (such as a cation comprising the catalyst).    In the discharge cell, the cation is either an oxidized species of the material of the cathode or anode, a cation of an added reductant, or a cation present in the cell (such as a cation comprising the catalyst).    In the plasma torch cell, the cation is either an oxidized species of the material of the cell, a cation of an added reductant, or a cation present in the cell (such as a cation comprising   the   catalyst).<br>
A  battery  is  provided  comprising  a cathode and cathode compartment  containing  an  oxidant;  an  anode  and  an  anode  compartment containing  a reductant,  and a salt bridge  completing  a circuit between  the cathode   and   anode   compartments.     Increased   binding   energy   hydrogen compounds  may  serve  as  oxidants  of the  battery  cathode  half reaction. The  oxidant  may  be  an  increased binding energy  hydrogen  compound.     A cation     (where   is an integer) bound to a hydrino hydride ion such that  the binding  energy of the cation or atom   is less than the<br>
binding energy  of the  hydrino hydride  ion     may serve as the<br>
oxidant.     Alternatively,  a hydrino hydride ion  may be selected for a given cation such that the hydrino hydride ion is not oxidized by the<br>
cation.    Thus, the oxidant  comprises a cation  M+, where n is<br><br>
an  integer and  the  hydrino hydride ion where p is an integer<br>
greater than   1,  that is  selected such  that its binding  energy  is  greater than that of M(n-1)+.    By selecting a stable cation-hydrino hydride anion compound,   a  battery  oxidant  is  provided  wherein  the  reduction  potential is determined by the binding energies of the cation and anion of the oxidant.<br>
The  battery  oxidant may  be,  for example,  an  increased  binding energy  hydrogen   compound  comprising  a  dihydrino   molecular  ion  bound to a  hydrino hydride ion  such that the binding energy of the reduced<br>
dihydrino  molecular  ion,  the  dihydrino  molecule   , is less<br>
that  the binding energy of the  hydrino hydride ion    One such<br>
oxidant is the compound  where  p  of the dihydrino<br>
molecular ion is 2 and  p   of the hydrino hydride ion is  13,  14,  15,  16,  17, 18, or 19.    Alternatively, in the case of <br>
of the hydrino hydride  ion  may be   11  to 20 because the binding energy of Hef and  Fe is 54.4 eV and 54.8 eV, respectively.    Thus, in the case of He2+(/T(l/p))2,. the hydride ion is selected to have a higher binding<br>
energy   than   He" (54.4 eV).    In the case of Fe4+ (H-(1/ p)   the hydride  ion<br>
is selected to have a higher binding energy than   Fe (54.8 eV).<br>
In  one  embodiment  of the  battery,  hydrino  hydride  ions  complete the  circuit  during  battery  operation  by  migrating  from  the  cathode compartment to the anode  compartment through a salt bridge.     The salt bridge  may  comprise  an  anion  conducting  membrane  and/or  an  anion conductor.    The  bridge may comprise, for example, an anion conducting membrane  and/or an  anion conductor.    The  salt bridge may be  formed of a /.oolite, a lamhanide boride (such as  MBh, where  M  is a lanthanide), or an  alkaline  earth  boride  (such as   MBb where  M  is an alkaline earth) which is selective as an anion conductor based on the small size of the hydrino   hydride   anion.<br>
The  battery  is optionally made rechargeable.     According to an embodiment  of  a  rechargeable  battery,   a  cathode   compartment  contains reduced  oxidant  and  a  anode  compartment contains  an  oxidized<br>
reductant.     The  battery further comprises an ion  such  as  the  hydrino hydride ion which migrates to complete the circuit.    To permit the battery  to   be  recharged,  the  oxidant comprising  increased  binding  energy hydrogen compounds must be capable of being  generated  by  the application  of a proper voltage to the battery to yield  the desired oxidant.    A representative proper voltage is from about one  volt to about<br>
100 volts.    The oxidant  comprises a desired cation formed at a<br>
desired  voltage,  selected  such  that the n-th  ionization energy   IPn  to form the cation   M"+ from M(n-1)+, where  n is an integer, is less than the binding<br>
energy of the  hydrino hydride ion   , where p is an integer greater<br>
than   1.<br>
The  reduced oxidant may be,  for example,  iron metal,  and  the oxidized  reductant having  a source of hydrino  hydride  ions  may  be,  for example,   potassium   hydrino   hydride   (K+H-(1/ p)).    The application of a<br>
proper  voltage  oxidizes  the  reduced  oxidant  (Fe) to  the  desired  oxidation state  (Ft'4") to form the oxidant (Fe4 (H+(1/p))   where  p  of the hydrino<br>
hydride ion is an integer from  11   to 20).      The application of the proper voltage  also  reduces  the  oxidized  reductant  (K+) to  the  desired  oxidation state   (A')  to  form  the  reductant  (potassium  metal).     The  hydrino  hydride ions  complete  the  circuit  by  migrating  from  the  anode  compartment  to the   cathode   compartment  through   the   salt  bridge.<br>
In   an  embodiment  of  the   battery,  the  cathode   compartment functions  as  the  cathode.<br>
Increased   binding   energy   hydrogen  compounds   providing   a   hydrino hydride  ion  may be  used to synthesize desired compositions  of matter by electrolysis.    The hydrino hydride  ion may serve as  the  negative  ion  of the electrolyte of a high  voltage electrolytic cell.    The desired compounds such  as Zintl  phase silicides and silanes  may  be synthesized  using electrolysis  without  the  decomposition  of the  anion,  electrolyte,  or the electrolytic  solution.     The  hydrino hydride  ion  binding energy  is  greater than any ordinary species formed during operation of the cell.    The cell is operated  at  a  desired  voltage  which  forms  the  desired  product  without decomposition of the  hydrino hydride ion.    In the case that the desired product is cation  M+  (where n  is an integer), the hydrino hydride ion<br>
   is selected such that its binding energy is  greater than that of <br>
M(n-1)+    The desired cations formed at the desired voltage  may be selected such  that the  n-th  ionization energy   lPn to form the cation  M++ from M(n-1)+<br>
(where   n  is an integer) is less than the binding energy of the hydrino<br>
hydride  ion    .    Alternatively,  a hydrino hydride  ion  may  be  selected<br>

For example, in the case of He2 or Fe4+, p  of the hydrino hydride ion may be 11  to 20 because the binding energy of He+ and Fe3+ is 54.4 eV and 54.8 eV, respectively.    Thus, in the case of a desired compound   He2+(H(1/ p))2,<br>
the hydride ion is selected to have a higher binding energy than  He+  (54.4 eV.    In the case of a desired compound  Fe4+ (H"'(1 /p))   the  hydride ion is<br>
selected to have  a higher binding energy than   Feu (54.8 eV).   The hydrino  hydride  ion  is  selected  such  that the  electrolyte  does  not decompose   during  operation   to  generate   the  desired   product.<br>
A fuel cell of the present invention comprises a source of oxidant, a cathode  contained   in  a  cathode  compartment  in  communication   with   the source of oxidant, an anode in an anode compartment, and a salt bridge completing  a circuit  between  the  cathode  and  anode  compartments.     The oxidant may be  hydrinos  from the oxidant source.     The hydrinos react to form  hydrino hydride  ions  as  a cathode  half reaction.     Increased binding energy   hydrogen  compounds   may  provide  hydrinos.     The   hydrinos  may be  supplied to the cathode from the oxidant source  by thermally or chemically   decomposing   increased   binding  energy   hydrogen   compounds. Alternatively, the source of oxidant may be an electrolytic cell, gas cell, gas discharge cell, or plasma torch cell hydrino hydride reactor of the present  invention.     An alternative  oxidant of the  fuel  cell  comprises increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds.     For example,  a cation Mn+   (where  n   is an  integer) bound to a hydrino hydride  ion  such that the binding energy of the cation or atom   M(n+1)+   is less than the binding<br>
energy  of the  hydrino  hydride  ion     may serve as the oxidant.    The<br>
source of oxidant, such as   may be an electrolytic cell, gas cell,<br>
gas discharge cell, or plasma torch cell hydrino hydride reactor of the<br>
present   invention.<br>
In  an  embodiment of the fuel  cell,  the  cathode  compartment functions  as  the  cathode.<br>

According  to another aspect of the invention, energy is released by the thermal  decomposition or chemical reaction of at least one of the following  reactants:  (1)  increased  binding energy  hydrogen  compound; (2) hydrino;  or (3) dihydrino.

The   method  further  comprises collecting   the   non-reactive  atomic   hydrogen  and  reacting   the  non-reactive   atomic   hydrogen   with   a   second  reductant,   thereby   forming stable  hydride  ions  including  the  hydride  ion  having  a binding energy  of about 0.65 eV.    The first reductant may have a high work function or a positive  free energy  of reaction with the nonreactive hydrogen.     The  first reductant may be a metal, other than an alkali or alkaline earth metal,<br>
such  as  tungsten.    The second reductant may comprise  a plasma or an alkali  or alkaline earth  metal.<br>
Another embodiment of the  invention is  a method  for the  explosive release  of energy.     An  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compound containing  a hydride ion having a binding energy of about 0.65 eV, is reacted with  a proton to produce molecular hydrogen having  a  first binding energy of about 8,928 eV.    The proton may  be supplied by an acid or a super-acid.    The acid or super acid may comprise, for example, HF, HC1, H2SO4, HNO3, the reaction product of HF and SbF5, the reaction product of HC1 and A12C16, the reaction product of H2SO3F and SbF?, the reaction product of H2SO4 and SO2, and combinations thereof.    The reaction  of the  acid or super-acid proton may  be  initiated by  rapid mixing the  hydride ion or hydride ion compound with  the  acid  or super-acid.    The rapid mixing may be achieved, for example, by detonation of a conventional explosive proximal to the hydride  ion  or hydride  ion compound  and  the  acid  or super-acid.<br>

The  thermal decomposition may  be achieved, for example,  by detonating  a  conventional  explosive  proximal  to  the  hydride  ion compound.     The  thermal decomposition may  also be achieved by percussion  heating  of the  hydride  ion compound.

IV. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Formation   of a  hydride   ion  having  a  binding  energy   greater  than about   0.8 eV, i.e.,  a hydrino hydride ion.  allows for production  of alkali and   alkaline  earth   hydrides   having  enhanced   stability   or   slow   reactivity in  water.     In  addition,  very  stable  metal  hydrides  can  be  produced with hydrino   hydride   ions.<br>
Increased   binding  energy   hydrogen   species   form   very   strong   bonds with   certain   cations   and   have   unique  properties   with   many   applications such  as  cutting  materials  (as  a  replacement for diamond,  for example); structural  materials  and  synthetic  fibers  such  as  novel  inorganic polymers.    Due to the small mass of such the hydrino hydride ion, these materials  are  lighter  in  weight  than  present materials  containing  a  other a n i o n s.<br>
Increased   binding   energy   hydrogen   species   have   main1   additional applications   such   as   cathodes   for  thermionic   generators;   formation   of photoluminescent   compounds   (e.g.   Zintl   phase   silicides   and   silanes containing   increased   binding   energy   hydrogen   species);   corrosion resistant  coatings;   heat  resistant  coatings;  phosphors   for  lighting;  optical coatings;  optical  filters  (e.g.,  due to the  unique continuum  emission and absorption   bands  of the  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen   species); extreme ultraviolet laser media (e.g., as a compound  with  a with highly positively charged cation); fiber optic cables (e.g., as a material with a<br>
low   attenuation  for  electromagnetic  radiation  and  a  high   refractive index); magnets and magnetic computer storage  media  (e.g.,  as  a compound with a ferromagnetic cation such as iron,  nickel,  or chromium); chemical  synthetic  processing methods;  and refining  methods.     The specific  p  hydrino hydride ion (H'(n = l/ p) where  p is an integer) may be<br>
selected  to  provide  the  desired property  such  as  voltage  following doping.<br>
The  reactions  resulting  in the formation  of the  increased  binding energy  hydrogen  compounds  are  useful  in  chemical  etching  processes, such  as  semiconductor etching to form computer chips,  for example. Hydrino  hydride  ions  are  useful as dopants  for  semiconductors,  to  alter the energies  of the  conduction  and  valance bands of the  semiconductor materials.     Hydrino  hydride  ions  may  be  incorporated  into  semiconductor materials by  ion  implantation, beam epitaxy,  or vacuum deposition.     The specific   p  hydrino hydride ion (H-(n- 1/ p] where  p is an integer) may be<br>
selected  to  provide  the  desired property  such  as  band  gap  following doping.<br>
Hydrino   hydride   compounds   are   useful   semiconductor   masking agents.      Hydrino   species-terminated   (versus   hydrogen-terminated) silicon  may  be  utilized.<br>
The highly  stable  hydrino hydride  ion has application  as the negative ion of the electrolyte of a high voltage electrolytic cell.    In a further  application,   a  hydrino  hydride  ion   with  extreme   stability represents  a  significant  improvement as  the product  of a cathode half reaction of a fuel cell  or battery over conventional cathode products of present batteries and fuel cells.    The hydrino hydride reaction of Eq.  (8) releases   much   more   energy.<br>
A  further  advanced  battery  application  of hydrino  hydride   ions   is in the  fabrication  of batteries.    A battery comprising,  as an oxidant compound,  a  hydrino  hydride  compound  formed  of a  highly  oxidized cation  and  a  hydrino  hydride  ion  ("hydrino  hydride  battery"),  has  a lighter  weight,   higher  voltage,  higher  power,   and  greater  energy  density than  a  conventional   battery.     In  one  embodiment,  a  hydrino  hydride battery  has  a cell  voltage of about  100 times that of conventional batteries.     The  hydrino hydride battery also has  a lower resistance than conventional  batteries.     Thus,  the power of the inventive battery is more than   10,000  times the  power of ordinary batteries.     Furthermore,  a<br>
hydrino  hydride  battery  can  posses  energy  densities   of  greater   than 100,000  watt hours per kilogram.     The most advanced of conventional batteries  have  energy  densities  of less  that  200  watt  hours  per  kilogram.<br>
Due  to  the  rapid  kinetics  and  the  extraordinary  exothermic  nature of the  reactions  of increased  binding energy  hydrogen  compounds, particularly   hydrino   hydride   compounds,   other   applications   include munitions,  explosives,  propellants,  and  solid  fuels.<br>
The  selectivity of hydrino atoms and hydride ions  in  forming bonds with  specific  isotopes  based on  a differential in bond  energy provides  a means  to  purify  desired  isotopes  of elements.<br>
1. HYDRIDE ION<br>
-    A hydrino atom    reacts with an electron to form a<br>
corresponding   hydrino   hydride   ion   H-(n = 1/p) as given by Eq. (8). Hydride ions are  a special case of two-electron  atoms each  comprising a nucleus and an "electron  1" and an "electron 2".    The derivation of the binding energies of two-electron atoms is given by the '96 Mills GUT.    A brief  summary  of  the   hydride   binding  energy   derivation  follows whereby   the  equation   numbers   of the  format  (#.###)   correspond  to  those given in the '96 Mills GUT.<br>
The   hydride  ion   comprises  two  indistinguishable  electrons   bound   to a proton of Z = +l.    Each electron experiences a centrifugal force,  and the balancing  centripetal  force  (on each  electron)  is produced  by  the  electric force  between the electron and the nucleus.     In addition,  a magnetic force exits  between the  two electrons causing the electrons  to pair.<br>
1.1     Determination  of the Orhiisphere  Radius,  rn<br>
Consider the binding of a second electron  to a hydrogen atom to form  a  hydride  ion.    The  second electron  experiences  no central electric force  because the electric field is zero outside of the radius of the first electron.     However,  the  second  electron  experiences  a  magnetic  force  due to electron   1   causing it to spin pair with electron  1.    Thus, electron   1 experiences  the reaction  force of electron  2 which acts as a centrifugal force.    The  force balance equation can be determined by equating the total forces acting on the two bound electrons taken together.    The force<br>
balance  equation  for the  paired  electron  orbitsphere   is  obtained  by equating the forces on  the  mass and charge densities.     The  centrifugal force of both electrons is given by Eq. (7.1) and Eq. (7.2) where the mass is 2rnf.    Electric field lines end on charge.    Since both electrons are paired<br>
at the same radius, the number of field lines ending  on the charge density of electron   1   equals  the  number that end  on  the charge  density of electron 2.    The electric force is proportional to the number of field lines;  thus,  the centripetal electric force,   F,  between  the  electrons  and<br>
the  nucleus  is<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where   eo   is  the permittivity  of free-space.    The outward magnetic force<br>
on "the two paired electrons is given by the negative of Eq.  (7.15) where the mass is  2me.    The outward centrifugal force and magnetic  forces on<br>
electrons   1   and  2  are balanced by the electric force<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where   Z = l.   Solving for <br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
That is, the final radius of electron 2, r2. is given by Eq. (14); this is also the final radius of electron   1.<br>
1.2    Binding Energy<br>
During ionization, electron 2 is moved to infinity.    By the selection rules  for  absorption  of electromagnetic  radiation  dictated  by conservation  of angular  momentum,  absorption  of a  photon  causes  the<br>
spin  axes  of the   antiparallel   spin-paired  electrons  to   become  parallel. The   impairing  energy.   .(magnetic), is given by Eq. (7.30) and Eq. (14)<br>
multiplied  by  two  because  the  magnetic  energy  is  proportional  to  the square  of the  magnetic  field  as derived  in  Eqs.  (1.122-1.129).     A repulsive  magnetic  force exists on the electron to be  ionized due to the parallel alignment of the spin axes.    The energy to move electron 2 to a radius which is infinitesimally greater than that of electron   1  is zero.    In this case, the only force acting on electron 2 is the magnetic force.    Due. to conservation  of energy,  the potential energy change  to move electron 2<br>
to infinity to ionize the hydride ion can be calculated from the magnetic force of Eq. (13).    The magnetic work, Emagworlc, is the negative integral of<br>
the magnetic force (the second term on the right side of Eq. (13)) from  r, to  infinity,<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where   r-, is given by Eq. (14).    The result of the integration is<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where   s =1/2.    By moving electron 2 to infinity, electron  1  moves to the radius   r,=aH,  and  the  corresponding magnetic  energy,   EelMnm (magnetic), is given by Eq. (7.30).    In the present case of an inverse squared central field,  the binding energy is one half the negative of the potential energy [Fowles, G. R., Analytical   Mechanics. Third Edition, Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, New York, (1977), pp.   154-156.].    Thus, the binding energy is given  by  subtracting  the  two  magnetic energy  terms  from  one  half the negative  of the  magnetic  work  wherein   me  is  the electron  reduced  mass Hf  given by  Eq.  (1.167) due  to the electrodynamic magnetic force between electron 2 and  the nucleus given by one half that of Eq.  (1.164). The factor of one half follows from Eq. (13).<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The binding energy  of the ordinary hydride ion   H'(n = 1) is 0.75402 eV according to Eq. (17).    The experimental value given by Dean [John A. Dean, Editor,  Lange's   Handbook  of Chemistry,  Thirteenth  Edition, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, (1985). p. 3-10.] is  0.754209 eV which  corresponds  to  a  wavelength  of  Î» = 1644 nm.    Thus, both values approximate  to  a  binding  energy  of about   0.8 eV.<br>
The  hydrino atom   H(1/2) can form a stable hydride ion, namely, the hydrino  hydride  ion   H'(n = 1l2).    The central field of the hydrino atom is twice that of the hydrogen atom, and it follows from Eq. (13) that<br>
the radius  of the  hydrino hydride ion   H-(n = 1/2) is one half that of an ordinary  hydrogen  hydride  ion,   H'(n = l), given by Eq. (14).<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The energy follows from Eq. (17) and Eq. (18).<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The binding energy of the hydrino hydride ion   H'(n = 1/2) is 3.047 eV according to Eq.  (19), which corresponds to a wavelength of  Î»=407/iw. In general,  the central  field of hydrino atom   H(n = 1 / p); /; = integer is p<br>
times  that of the  hydrogen atom.    Thus,  the force balance equation is<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where   Z=l because the field is zero for r,r-,.   Solving for ;%.<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
From  Eq. (21),  the radius of the hydrino hydride ion   H-(n - 1 / p}: p = integer<br>
is â€”  that of atomic hydrogen  hydride,   H-(n = 1), given by Eq. (14).   The P<br>
energy follows from Eq. (20) and Eq. (21).<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
TABLE   1, supni. provides the binding energy of the hydrino hydride ion H- (n = I /p)) as a function of p according to Eq. (22).<br>
2. HYDRIDE REACTOR<br>
One  embodiment  of the  present  invention involves  a  hydride reactor shown in FIGURE 1, comprising a vessel 52 containing a catalysis mixture 54.    The catalysis mixture 54 comprises a source of atomic<br>
hydrogen  56  supplied  through  hydrogen  supply  passage  42  and  a catalyst 58  supplied through catalyst supply passage  41.     Catalyst  58  has a net enthalpy of reaction of about  -27.21 eV, where  m  is an integer,<br>
preferably  an  integer less  than 400.     The catalysis  involves reacting atomic hydrogen from the source 56 with the catalyst 58  to form hydrinos.     The  hydride reactor further includes  an  electron  source  70  for contacting  hydrinos  with  electrons,  to reduce  the  hydrinos  to  hydrino hydride   ions.<br>
The  source of hydrogen can  be hydrogen gas,  water,  ordinary hydride,  or metal-hydrogen  solutions.     The  water may  be  dissociated  to form  hydrogen  atoms  by,  for example,  thermal  dissociation  or electrolysis.     According to one embodiment of the invention,  molecular hydrogen  is  dissociated  into  atomic  hydrogen  by  a  molecular  hydrogen dissociating  catalyst.     Such dissociating catalysts include,  for example, noble  metals  such  as  palladium  and  platinum,  refractory  metals  such  as molybdenum   and   tungsten,   transition  metals  such  as   nickel   and   titanium, inner  transition  metals  such  as  niobium  and  zirconium,  and  other  such materials  listed  in  the  Prior  Mills  Publications.<br>
According  to another embodiment of the  invention  utilizing  a  gas cell  hydride reactor or gas discharge cell hydride reactor as  shown in FIGURES  3  and 5. respectively, a photon source dissociates hydrogen molecules   to  hydrogen  atoms.<br>
In  all   the   hydrino  hydride  reactor  embodiments   of  the  present invention, the means to form hydrino can be one or more of an electrochemical,  chemical,  photochemical,  thermal,  free  radical,  sonic,  or nuclear  reaction(s),  or  inelastic  photon  or particle  scattering  reaction(s). In  the  latter  two  cases,  the  hydride  reactor comprises  a particle  source and/or photon source 75 as shown in FIGURE   1, to supply the reaction as an  inelastic  scattering  reaction.     In  one  embodiment  of the  hydrino hydride  reactor,   the  catalyst  includes  an  electrocatalytic   ion  or  couple(s) in the molten, liquid, gaseous, or solid state given in the Tables of the Prior Mills  Publications (e.g. TABLE 4 of PCT/US90/01998 and pages 25-46.   80-108   of   PCT/US94/02219).<br>
Where the catalysis occurs in the gas phase, the catalyst may be maintained   at  a  pressure  less  than  atmospheric,  preferably  in  the  range 10 millitorr to   100 torr.     The atomic  and/or molecular hydrogen reactant<br>
is  maintained  at  a  pressure  less  than  atmospheric,  preferably  in  the range   10 millitorr to   100 torr.<br>
Each  of the  hydrino hydride reactor embodiments  of the  present invention  (electrolytic cell hydride reactor,  gas  cell hydride  reactor,  gas discharge  cell  hydride  reactor,  and plasma torch cell  hydride  reactor) comprises the following: a source of atomic hydrogen; at least one of a solid,  molten,  liquid, or gaseous catalyst for generating hydrinos;  and a vessel for containing the atomic hydrogen and the catalyst.     Methods and apparatus  for producing hydrinos, including a listing  of effective catalysts and sources of hydrogen atoms, are described in the Prior Mills Publications.     Methodologies  for identifying  hydrinos  are  also  described. The  hydrinos  so  produced react with the electrons  to form  hydrino hydride ions.     Methods to reduce hydrinos to hydrino hydride  ions include, for example, the following:    in the electrolytic cell hydride reactor, reduction  at the cathode; in the  gas cell  hydride  reactor,  chemical reduction by a reactant; in the gas discharge cell hydride  reactor, reduction by the plasma electrons or by the cathode of the gas discharge cell;  in  the  plasma  torch  hydride  reactor,  reduction  by  plasma electrons.<br>
2.1     Electrolytic Cell Hydride Reactor<br>
An  electrolytic cell  hydride reactor of the  present  invention  is shown in FIGURE 2.    An electric current is passed through an electrolytic solution   102 contained in vessel  101  by the application of a voltage.    The voltage is applied to an anode  104 and cathode  106  by a power controller  108  powered by a power supply  110.    The electrolytic  solution 102  contains  a catalyst for producing hydrino atoms.<br>
According  to one embodiment of the electrolytic cell  hydride reactor, cathode   106 is formed of nickel cathode   106 and anode   104 is formed of platinized titanium  or nickel.    The electrolytic  solution   102 comprising  an   about   0.5M   aqueous   K2CO3  electrolytic   solution  (K/K+<br>
catalyst) is electrolyzed.    The cell is operated within a voltage range of 1.4 to 3 volts.     In one embodiment of the invention,  the electrolytic solution   102  is  molten.<br>
Hydrino atoms form at the cathode   106 via contact of the catalyst of electrolyte   102  with  the  hydrogen  atoms  generated  at  the  cathode 106.     The  electrolytic cell  hydride reactor apparatus  further comprises  a source of electrons in contact with the hydrinos generated in the cell, to<br>
form  hydrino hydride ions.    The hydrinos  are reduced  (i.e.  gain  the electron) in the electrolytic cell to hydrino hydride ions.    Reduction occurs by contacting the hydrinos with any of the following:   1.) the cathode  106, 2.) a reductant which comprises the cell vessel  101, or 3.) any  of the  reactor's  components  such  as  features  designated  as  anode 104 or electrolyte   102,  or 4.)  a reductant  160 extraneous  to  the  operation of the cell (i.e. a consumable reductant added to the cell from an outside source).    Any of these reductants may comprise an electron source for reducing  hydrinos   to  hydrino  hydride  ions.<br>
A compound may  form  in  the electrolytic cell  between the  hydrino hydride ions and cations.    The cations may comprise, for example, an oxidized species of the material of the cathode or anode, a cation of an aded  reductant, or a cation of the electrolyte (such as a cation comprising   the   catalyst).<br>
2.2    Gas Cell Hydride Reactor<br>
According  to another embodiment of the  invention,  a  reactor  for producing hydrino hydride ions may take the form of a hydrogen gas cell hydride reactor.     A gas cell hydride reactor of the present invention is shown in FIGURE 3.    Also, the construction and operation of an experimental gas cell hydride reactor shown in FIGURE 4 is described in the   Identification  of Hydrino  Hydride  Compounds  by   Mass  Spectroscopy Section (Gas Cell  Sample), infra.    In both cells, reactant hydrinos are provided   by   an   electrocatalytic   reaction   and/or  a   disproportionation reaction.    Catalysis may occur in the gas phase.<br>
The reactor of FIGURE 3 comprises a reaction vessel 207 having a chamber 200  capable  of containing  a vacuum or pressures  greater than atmospheric.     A  source  of hydrogen  221   communicating  with  chamber 200  delivers   hydrogen   to  the   chamber  through   hydrogen   supply   passage 242.    A controller 222  is positioned to control the pressure and flow of hydrogen  into  the  vessel  through  hydrogen  supply  passage  242.     A pressure  sensor  223  monitors  pressure  in  the  vessel.     A  vacuum  pump 256 is used  to evacuate the chamber through a vacuum line  257.       The apparatus   further  comprises  a  source  of electrons  in   contact  with   the hydrinos  to   form  hydrino  hydride  ions.<br>
A catalyst 250 for generating hydrino atoms can be placed in a catalyst reservoir 295.    The catalyst in the gas phase may comprise the<br>
electrocatalytic  ions  and couples described in  the  Mills  Prior Publications. The reaction  vessel  207 has a catalyst supply passage 241   for the passage  of gaseous  catalyst from  the catalyst reservoir 295  to  the reaction chamber 200.     Alternatively, the catalyst may be placed in a chemically  resistant open container,  such  as  a boat,  inside  the  reaction vessel.<br>
The  molecular  and  atomic  hydrogen  partial  pressures   in  the  reactor vessel  207,  as  well  as  the catalyst partial pressure,  is  preferably maintained in the  range of 10 millitorr to  100 torr.     Most preferably,  the hydrogen  partial  pressure  in  the  reaction  vessel  207  is  maintained  at about   200   millitorr.<br>
Molecular hydrogen may  be dissociated in the  vessel  into atomic hydrogen  by  a dissociating  material.     The  dissociating  material  may comprise,  for example,  a noble metal  such as platinum or palladium,  a transition  metal   such  as  nickel  and  titanium,  an  inner  transition  metal such  as  niobium  and zirconium, or a refractory  metal  such  as tungsten  or molybdenum.     The  dissociating  material  may  be  maintained  at  an elevated   temperature   by   the   heat  liberated  by   the   hydrogen   catalysis (hydrino  generation)  and  hydrino  reduction  taking  place  in   the  reactor. The  dissociating   material  may  also  be  maintained  at  elevated temperature   by   temperature   control   means   230,   which   may   take   the form of a heating coil as shown in cross section in FIGURE 3.    The heating coil is powered by a power supply 225.<br>
Molecular  hydrogen  may  be  dissociated  into  atomic  hydrogen  by application  of electromagnetic  radiation, such as  UV light provided by a photon   source   205<br>
Molecular hydrogen  may  be dissociated  into  atomic  hydrogen  by a hot  filament  or  grid  280 powered  by  power supply  285.<br>
The  hydrogen  dissociation  occurs  such  that  the  dissociated hydrogen atoms contact a catalyst which is in a molten,  liquid, gaseous, or solid  form  to  produce hydrino atoms.    The catalyst vapor pressure  is maintained   at   the   desired   pressure   by   controlling   the   temperature   of  the catalyst  reservoir  295   with  a  catalyst  reservoir  heater  298   powered  by  a power supply 272.    When the catalyst is contained in a boat inside the reactor,  the  catalyst  vapor pressure  is  maintained  at  the  desired  value  by controlling  the  temperature  of the  catalyst  boat,  by  adjusting  the  boat's power   supply.<br>
The  rate of production of hydrinos  by the gas  cell  hydride reactor can be controlled by controlling the amount of catalyst in the gas phase and/or by  controlling  the concentration of atomic hydrogen.    The  rate  of production  of hydrino  hydride  ions can be controlled  by  controlling  the concentration of hydrinos, such as by controlling the rate of production of hydrinos.     The  concentration of gaseous  catalyst in  vessel  chamber 200 may  be controlled by controlling the initial amount of the  volatile catalyst present in  the  chamber 200.    The concentration  of gaseous catalyst in chamber 200 may also  be controlled by controlling  the catalyst   temperature,   by  adjusting   the  catalyst  reservoir  heater   298,   or by adjusting a catalyst boat heater when the catalyst  is contained in a boat inside the reactor.    The vapor pressure of the  volatile catalyst 250 in jhe  chamber  200  is  determined  by  the  temperature  of the  catalyst reservoir  295,  or  the  temperature  of the  catalyst boat,  because each  is colder than  the  reactor  vessel  207.     The  reactor  vessel  207  temperature is   maintained   at   a   higher  operating   temperature   than   catalyst   reservoir 295   with   heat   liberated   by   the   hydrogen  catalysis   (hydrino  generation) and  hydrino  reduction.     The  reactor  vessel  temperature  may  also  be maintained   by  a  temperature  control  means,  such  as  heating  coil  230 shown in cross section in FIGURE 3.    Heating coil 230 is powered by power  supply   225.     The  reactor  temperature   further  controls   the  reaction rates  such   as  hydrogen  dissociation  and  catalysis.<br>
The   preferred   operating   temperature  depends,   in   part,   on   the nature  of the  material  comprising  the reactor vessel  207.     The temperature  of a  stainless  steel  alloy  reactor  vessel   207  is  preferably maintained   at  200-1200Â°C.     The  temperature  of a  molybdenum  reactor vessel  207  is  preferably  maintained  at 200-1800  Â°C.     The  temperature  of a  tungsten   reactor  vessel   207   is  preferably  maintained  at  200-3000  Â°C. The  temperature  of a  quartz  or  ceramic  reactor  vessel  207   is  preferably maintained   at   200-1800  Â°C.<br>
The  concentration  of atomic  hydrogen  in  vessel  chamber 200 can be  controlled  by  the  amount  of atomic  hydrogen  generated  by  the hydrogen  dissociation   material.     The  rate  of molecular  hydrogen dissociation  is  controlled  by  controlling  the  surface  area,  the temperature,  and  the  selection  of the dissociation  material.     The concentration  of atomic  hydrogen  may  also be controlled  by  the  amount of atomic  hydrogen provided by the atomic hydrogen  source 280.    The<br>
concentration  of atomic  hydrogen  can  be  further controlled  by  the amount  of molecular hydrogen  supplied  from  the  hydrogen   source  221 controlled by a flow controller 222 and a pressure sensor 223.    The reaction  rate  may  be  monitored  by  windowless  ultraviolet  (UV)  emission spectroscopy to detect the intensity of the UV emission due to the catalysis  and  the   hydrino  hydride  ion  and  compound  emissions.<br>
The  gas  cell  hydride  reactor further comprises  an  electron  source 260  in  contact  with  the  generated  hydrinos  to  form  hydrino  hydride  ions. In the gas cell hydride reactor of FIGURE 3, hydrinos are reduced to hydrino  hydride  ions  by  contacting  a reductant comprising  the  reactor vessel  207.     Alternatively,  hydrinos  are  reduced  to  hydrino  hydride  ions by contact with any of the reactor's components, such as, photon source 205,   catalyst  250,   catalyst  reservoir  295,  catalyst  reservoir  heater  298, hot  filament grid  280,  pressure  sensor 223,  hydrogen  source  221,  flow controller 222,   vacuum  pump  256,  vacuum  line  257,  catalyst  supply passage  241,  or hydrogen  supply passage  242.     Hydrinos may  also be reduced  by  contact  with  a reductant extraneous  to  the  operation  of the cell (i.e.  a consumable reductant added to the cell from an  outside source).    Electron  source 260 is such a reductant.<br>
Compounds  comprising  a hydrino  hydride  anion  and  a  cation  may be formed  in the gas cell.    The cation which forms the hydrino hydride compound may comprise a cation of the material of the cell, a cation comprising   the   molecular  hydrogen   dissociation   material   which   produces atomic hydrogen,  a cation comprising an  added reductant,  or a cation present in the cell (such as the cation of the catalyst).<br>
In another embodiment of the gas  cell hydride  reactor,  the  vessel of the  reactor is  the combustion chamber of an internal  combustion engine,  rocket engine,  or gas  turbine.     A  gaseous catalyst  forms  hydrinos from   hydrogen  atoms  produced  by  pyrolysis  of a  hydrocarbon  during hydrocarbon   combustion.     A   hydrocarbon-   or   hydrogen-containing   fuel contains  the  catalyst.     The  catalyst  is  vaporized  (becomes  gaseous)  during the  combustion.     In  another embodiment,  the  catalyst  is  a  thermally stable  salt of rubidium  or potassium such as   RbF, RbCl, RbBr, Rbl, Rb2S2, RbOH, Rb,SO4, Rb2CO3,, Rb,PO4, and  KF, KC/, KBr, KI, K2S2, KOH, K2SO4, KCO, KyPO4,KGeF4.    Additional counterions of the electrocatalytic ion or couple  include organic  anions,  such as wetting or emulsifying  agents.<br>
In  another  embodiment  of the  invention  utilizing  a  combustion<br>
engine   to  generate  hydrogen  atoms,  the   hydrocarbon-   or  hydrogen-containing  fuel  further comprises water and a solvated  source  of catalyst, such  as emulsified electrocatalytic ions or couples.    During pyrolysis, water  serves  as  a  further source  of hydrogen  atoms  which  undergo catalysis.    The water can be dissociated into hydrogen atoms thermally or catalytically on a surface, such as the cylinder or piston head.    The surface  may  comprise  material  for  dissociating  water  to  hydrogen  and oxygen.     The  water dissociating  material  may  comprise  an  element, compound,  alloy,  or mixture  of transition  elements  or  inner  transition elements,   iron,  platinum,  palladium,  zirconium,  vanadium,   nickel, titanium, Sc, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Y, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Ag, Cd, La, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Au, Hg, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Vb, Lu, Th, Pa,. U, activated charcoal (carbon),  or Cs intercalated carbon (graphite).<br>
In  another embodiment  of the  invention  utilizing  an  engine  to generate   hydrogen   atoms  through  pyrolysis,   vaporized   catalyst   is  drawn from   the  catalyst  reservoir  295   through   the  catalyst   supply  passage   241 into  vessel  chamber 200.    The  chamber corresponds  to  the  engine cylinder.    This occurs during each engine cycle.    The amount of catalyst 250  used  per engine  cycle  may  be  determined  by  the  vapor pressure  of the  catalyst  and  the  gaseous  displacement  volume  of the  catalyst reservoir 295.     The  vapor pressure  of the catalyst may  be  controlled by controlling   the  temperature  of the   catalyst  reservoir  295   with  the reservoir heater 298.    A source  of electrons,  such  as  a hydrino reducing reagent  in  contact  with hydrinos,  results in the formation  of hydrino hydride   ions.<br>
7 3    Gns Discharge Cell Hvdride Reactor<br>
A  gas discharge  cell  hydride  reactor of the present  invention is shown in FIGURE 5. and an experimental gas discharge cell hydride reactor is shown  in FIGURE 6.    The construction and operation of the experimental  gas  discharge  cell  hydride reactor  shown  in  FIGURE  6  is described  in  the  Identification  of Hydrino Hydride Compounds by  Mass Spectroscopy  Section  (Discharge  Cell  Sample),  infra.<br>
The gas discharge cell hydride reactor of FIGURE 5, includes a gas discharge cell  307 comprising a hydrogen isotope gas-filled glow discharge vacuum vessel 313  having a chamber 300.     A hydrogen  source 322  supplies  hydrogen  to the chamber 300 through  control valve  325  via<br>
a hydrogen  supply passage 342.    A catalyst for generating  hydrinos.  such as the compounds described in Mills Prior Publications (e.g. TABLE 4 of PCT/US90/01998   and  pages   25-46,   80-108  of  PCT/US94/02219)   is contained in catalyst reservoir 395.    A voltage  and current source  330 causes current to pass between a cathode 305 and an anode 320.    The current   may   be   reversible.<br>
In one embodiment of the gas discharge  cell hydride reactor,  the wall of vessel 313 is conducting and serves as the anode.    In another embodiment, the cathode 305 is hollow such as a hollow, nickel, aluminum,  copper,  or stainless  steel hollow  cathode.<br>
The cathode  305  may be coated with the  catalyst for generating hydrinos.    The catalysis to form hydrinos occurs on the cathode surface. To, form  hydrogen  atoms  for generation  of hydrinos,  molecular hydrogen is dissociated on the cathode.    To this end, the cathode is formed of a hydrogen  dissociative  material.     Alternatively,   the  molecular  hydrogen  is dissociated   by   the  discharge.<br>
According  to another embodiment  of the  invention,  the  catalyst  for generating hydrinos is  in gaseous form.     For example,  the  discharge  may be utilized to vaporize  the catalyst  to provide  a gaseous  catalyst. Alternatively,   the  gaseous  catalyst  is  produced  by  the  discharge   current. For example,  the  gaseous catalyst may be provided by a discharge in potassium  metal  to form   K+ / K rubidium metal to form   Rb+,  or titanium metal to form   Ti2    The gaseous hydrogen atoms for reaction with the gaseous  catalyst  are provided  by  a  discharge  of molecular  hydrogen  gas such that the catalysis occurs in the gas phase.<br>
Another embodiment  of the  gas  discharge  cell  hydride  reactor where catalysis occurs  in the gas phase utilizes  a controllable gaseous catalyst.     The  gaseous  hydrogen atoms for conversion to hydrinos are provided by a discharge of molecular hydrogen  gas.    The gas discharge cell  307  has  a catalyst supply  passage  341   for the passage of the  gaseous  catalyst  350  from catalyst reservoir 395  to  the reaction chamber  300.     The  catalyst reservoir 395  is  heated by  a catalyst  reservoir  heater  392  having  a  power  supply   372   to  provide the  gaseous  catalyst to  the reaction chamber 300.    The catalyst  vapor pressure  is  controlled  by  controlling  the  temperature  of the  catalyst reservoir 395, by adjusting the heater 392 by means of its power supply  372.    The reactor further comprises  a selective  venting  valve<br>
301.<br>
In  another  embodiment  of the  gas  discharge  cell  hydride  reactor where catalysis occurs  in the gas phase utilizes a controllable  gaseous catalyst.    Gaseous hydrogen atoms provided by a discharge of molecular hydrogen gas.     A chemically resistant (does not react or degrade during the operation of the reactor) open container, such as a tungsten  or ceramic boat, positioned inside the gas discharge cell contains the catalyst.    The catalyst in the catalyst boat is heated with a boat heater using by means  of an associated power supply to provide  the  gaseous catalyst to  the  reaction chamber.     Alternatively,  the  glow  gas  discharge cell  is  operated  at  an  elevated temperature  such  that the catalyst in  the boat is sublimed, boiled, or volatilized into the gas phase.    The catalyst vapr pressure  is  controlled  by  controlling  the  temperature  of the  boat or the discharge cell by adjusting the heater with its power supply.<br>
The  gas  discharge  cell  may  be  operated  at room  temperature by continuously   supplying  catalyst.     Alternatively,   to  prevent   the   catalyst from  condensing  in  the  cell,  the  temperature  is  maintained  above  the temperature  of the  catalyst  source,  catalyst  reservoir  395   or  catalyst boat.    For example, the temperature of a stainless steel alloy cell is 0-1200Â°C; the temperature of a molybdenum cell is 0-1800 Â°C;  the temperature  of a  tungsten cell  is 0-3000 Â°C; and the  temperature  of a glass, quartz, or ceramic cell is 0-1800 Â°C.    The discharge voltage may be in the range of 1000 to 50,000 volts.    The current may be in the range of 1  ÂµM to  1   A, preferably about  1  mA<br>
The  gas discharge cell  apparatus includes an electron  source in contact  with  the  hydrinos,  in  order to generate  hydrino  hydride  ions. The  hydrinos are reduced to hydrino hydride ions by  contact with cathode  305.  with  plasma electrons of the  discharge,  or with  the  vessel 313.    Also, hydrinos  may be reduced by contact with  any of the reactor components,   such   as   anode   320,   catalyst   350,   heater  392,   catalyst reservoir  395.   selective  venting   valve   301.  control   valve   325.   hydrogen source  322,   hydrogen   supply  passage  342  or  catalyst  supply   passage 341.     According  to yet another variation,  hydrinos  are reduced  by  a reductant  360 extraneous to  the  operation of the cell  (e.g.  a consumable reductant  added  to the  cell  from an outside  source).<br>
Compounds comprising a hydrino hydride anion and a cation may be formed in the gas discharge cell.    The cation which forms the hydrino<br>
hydride  compound  may  comprise  an oxidized  species  of the  material comprising the cathode or the anode, a cation of an added reductant. or a cation present in the cell (such as a cation of the catalyst).<br>
In  one  embodiment of the  gas  discharge  cell  apparatus,  potassium or rubidium  hydrino hydride  is prepared  in  the gas  discharge cell  307. The  catalyst reservoir 395  contains   KI or Rbl catalyst.    The catalyst vapor pressure in the gas discharge cell is controlled by heater 392.    The catalyst reservoir  395  is heated with  the  heater 392  to  maintain  the catalyst  vapor  pressure  proximal  to  the  cathode  305  preferably  in  the pressure  range   10 millitorr to   100 torr,  more  preferably  at  about  200 mtorr.     In  another embodiment,  the cathode  305  and  the  anode  320 of the gas discharge cell 307 are coated with  KI or Rbl catalyst.    The catalyst is  vaporized during the operation of the cell.    The hydrogen supply  from  source  322  is adjusted with control  325  to  supply  hydrogen and  maintain  the  hydrogen  pressure in  the   10  millitorr to   100 torr  range.<br>
In  one  embodiment of the  gas discharge  cell  hydride  reactor apparatus,  catalysis occurs in  a hydrogen  gas discharge  cell  using  a catalyst with a net enthalpy  of about 27.2 electron volts.     The catalyst (e.g.  potassium ions) is vaporized by the discharge.    The discharge  also produces  reactant  hydrogen  atoms.     Catalysis  using  potassium  ions results  in  the emission  of extreme  ultraviolet  (UV) photons.     In  addition<br>
to the  transition   the   disproportionation<br>
reaction  described in  the  Disproportionation of Energy  States  Section  of PCT/US96/07949  causes  additional  emission  of extreme  UV  at  912 A  and 304 A.    Extreme UV photons ionize hydrogen resulting in the emission of the normal  spectrum of hydrogen which includes visible light.    Thus,  the extreme  UV  emission  from  the  catalysis  is  observable  indirectly  as indicated  by  the  conversion  of the  extreme  UV  to  visible  wavelengths. At  the  same  time,  hydrinos  react  with  electrons  to  form  hydrino  hydride ions  having  the continuum absorption and emission  lines  given in TABLE 1. supra.     These  lines  arc  observable by emission  spectroscopy  which identify   catalysis   and   increased   binding   energy   hydrogen   compounds.<br>
2.4    Plasma Torch Cell Hydride Reactor<br>
A plasma  torch  cell hydride reactor of the present invention is shown in FIGURE 7.    A plasma torch 702 provides a hydrogen isotope<br>
hydrogen flow rate and the ratio of hydrogen to plasma gas in the mixture.    The hydrogen flow rate and the plasma gas flow rate to the hydrogen-plasma-gas   mixer  and  mixture   flow   regulator   721   are controlled by flow rate controllers 734 and 744, and by valves 736 and 746.     Mixer  regulator  721   controls  the hydrogen-plasma  mixture  to  the torch and the catalyst reservoir.    The catalysis rate is also controlled by controlling   the  temperature  of the  plasma  with  microwave  generator 724.<br>
Hydrino atoms and hydrino hydride ions  are produced in  the plasma 704.     Hydrino  hydride  compounds  are  cryopumped  onto  the manifold  706,  or  they  flow  into hydrino hydride compound  trap  708 through  passage  748.     Trap  708  communicates  with  vacuum pump  710 through vacuum line 750 and valve 752.    A flow to the trap 708 is effected  by  a  pressure  gradient controlled by  the  vacuum  pump  710, vacuum  line  750,  and  vacuum  valve  752.<br>
In  another  embodiment  of the  plasma  torch  cell  hydride  reactor shown in FIGURE 8, at least one of plasma torch 802 or manifold 806 has a catalyst supply  passage  856 for passage of the gaseous catalyst from  a catalyst reservoir  858  to the plasma 804.    The  catalyst in  the catalyst reservoir  858   is  heated  by  a catalyst reservoir  heater  866  having  a power supply  868  to provide the gaseous catalyst to  the  plasma  804. The   catalyst   vapor  pressure   is  controlled  by  controlling  the   temperature of the catalyst  reservoir 858  by adjusting the  heater 866 with its power supply 868.    The remaining elements of FIGURE 8 have the same structure and function of the corresponding elements of FIGURE 7.    In other words, element 812 of FIGURE 8 is a plasma gas supply corresponding to the plasma gas supply 712 of FIGURE 7, element 838 of FIGURE 8  is a hydrogen supply corresponding to hydrogen supply 738  of FIGURE 7. and so forth.<br>
In  another embodiment  of the  plasma  torch  cell  hydride  reactor,  a chemically  resistant open container  such  as a  ceramic  boat  located  inside the  manifold  contains the catalyst.     The plasma torch manifold forms  a cell   which   is  operated  at  an  elevated  temperature  such  that  the  catalyst in the boat is sublimed, boiled, or volatilized into the gas phase. Alternatively,  the catalyst in the catalyst boat is heated with a boat heater having a power supply to provide the gaseous catalyst to the plasma.    The catalyst vapor pressure is controlled by controlling the<br>
plasma 704  enclosed by a manifold 706.     Hydrogen  from hydrogen supply 738  and plasma gas from plasma gas supply 712,  along with a catalyst 714 for forming hydrinos, is supplied to torch 702.    The plasma may comprise argon, for example.    The catalyst may comprise any of the compounds described in Mills Prior Publications (e.g. TABLE 4 of PCT/US90/01998  and  pages  25-46,  80-108  of PCT/US94/02219).     The catalyst is contained in a catalyst reservoir 716.    The reservoir is equipped with a mechanical agitator, such as a magnetic  stirring  bar 718 driven by magnetic stirring bar motor 720.    The catalyst is supplied to plasma  torch  702  through  passage  728.<br>
Hydrogen is supplied to the torch 702 by a hydrogen passage 726. Alternatively,  both  hydrogen  and  catalyst  may  be  supplied  through passage 728.    The plasma gas is supplied to the torch by a plasma gas passage 726.     Alternatively,  both plasma gas and catalyst may be supplied   through   passage   728.<br>
Hydrogen  flows  from  hydrogen  supply  738  to  a  catalyst  reservoir 716 via passage 742.    The flow of hydrogen is controlled by hydrogen flow controller 744 and valve 746.    Plasma gas flows from the plasma gas supply 712 via passage 732.    The flow of plasma gas is controlled by plasma gas  flow controller 734 and valve 736.    A mixture of plasma gas and hydrogen is  supplied to the torch via passage 726 and to the catalyst reservoir  716  via  passage  725.     The  mixture  is controlled  by  hydrogen-plasma-gas  mixer  and  mixture  flow  regulator 721.     The  hydrogen  and plasma  gas  mixture  serves as a carrier gas for catalyst particles  which are  dispersed  into the  gas  stream as  fine  particles by  mechanical agitation.    The aerosolized catalyst and hydrogen gas of the mixture flow into  the  plasma torch  702 and become gaseous hydrogen  atoms  and vapori/.cd catalyst ions (such as   K ions from KI) in the plasma 704.    The plasma  is   powered  by  a  microwave  generator  724  wherein  the microwaves  are  tuned   by  a  tunable  microwave   cavity  722.     Catalysis occurs  in  the  gas phase.<br>
The  amount of gaseous catalyst in  the plasma torch  is controlled  by controlling  the  rate  that  catalyst  is  aerosolized  with  the  mechanical agitator.    The amount of gaseous catalyst is also controlled by controlling the carrier gas flow  rate where the carrier gas  includes  a hydrogen  and plasma gas mixture (e.g., hydrogen and argon).    The amount of gaseous hydrogen  atoms  to the  plasma torch is controlled by  controlling  the<br>
temperature  of the cell  with a cell heater, or by controlling the temperature  of the  boat  by  adjusting  the  boat  heater  with  an  associated power   supply.<br>
The  plasma temperature  in the plasma torch cell  hydride  reactor is advantageously maintained in the range of 5,000-30,000 Â°C.    The cell may   be   operated   at  room   temperature   by  continuously   supplying catalyst.     Alternatively,  to prevent  the  catalyst  from  condensing  in  the cell,  the cell  temperature is maintained above that of the catalyst source, catalyst  reservoir  758  or catalyst boat.     The  operating  temperature depends, in part, on the nature of the material comprising the cell.    The temperature for a stainless steel alloy cell is preferably 0-1200Â°C.    The temperature  for a molybdenum cell  is preferably 0-1800 Â°C.    The temperature  for a tungsten cell is preferably 0-3000 Â°C.    The temperature  for a glass, quartz,  or ceramic cell  is preferably  0-1800 Â°C. Where  the  manifold 706 is open to the atmosphere,  the cell  pressure is atmospheric.<br>
An  exemplary  plasma gas  for the  plasma torch  hydride  reactor is argon.     Exemplary  aerosol  flow  rates  are 0.8  standard  liters  per  minute (slm)  hydrogen and 0.15  slm  argon.    An exemplary  argon plasma flow rate is 5  slm.    An exemplary forward input power is   1000 W, and an exemplary   reflected  power  is   10-20  W.<br>
In  other embodiments  of the  plasma  torch  hydride  reactor,  the mechanical   catalyst   agitator  (magnetic  stirring   bar  718   and  magnetic stirring  bar motor 720) is replaced  with  an  aspirator,  atomizer,  or nebulizer to  form an aerosol  of the catalyst 714 dissolved  or suspended in a liquid medium such as water.    The medium is contained in the catalyst reservoir 716.     Or, the  aspirator,  atomizer,  or nebulizer  injects the catalyst directly  into the  plasma 704.    The  nebulized or atomized catalyst  is  carried  into the plasma  704 by a carrier gas,  such  as  hydrogen.<br>
The   plasma   torch  hydride  reactor  further  includes  an  electron source   in  contact  with  the  hydrinos,  for  generating  hydrino  hydride  ions. In  the  plasma  torch  cell,  the  hydrinos  are  reduced  to  hydrino  hydride ions by contacting   1.) the manifold 706, 2.) plasma electrons, or 4.) any of the  reactor  components  such  as  plasma  torch  702,  catalyst  supply passage  756,  or catalyst reservoir 758,  or 5) a reductant extraneous to the operation of the cell (e.g. a consumable reductant added to the cell from  an  outside  source).<br>
Compounds  comprising  a hydrino hydride  anion  and  a cation  may be formed in the gas cell.    The cation which forms the hydrino hydride compound may comprise a cation of an oxidized species of the material forming the torch or the manifold, a cation of an added reductant, or a cation present in the plasma (such as a cation of the catalyst).<br>
3. PURIFICATION OF INCREASED BINDING ENERGY HYDROGEN COMPOUNDS<br>
Increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds  formed  in   the hydride  reactor may  be  isolated  and purified  from  the  catalyst  remaining in the reactor following operation.    In the case of the electrolytic cell, gas cell, gas discharge cell, and plasma torch cell hydride reactors, increased binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds  are  obtained  by  physical   collection, precipitation  and  recrystallization,   or  centrifugation.     The   increased binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds  may  be   further  purified  by   the methods   described   hereafter.<br>
A  method  to  isolate  and purify  the increased binding energy hydrogen compounds is described as follows.    In the case of the electrolytic  cell   hydride  reactor,  water is  removed  from  the  electrolyte by evaporation,  to obtain a solid mixture.    The catalyst containing the increased   binding  energy  hydrogen  compound   is  suspended   in  a   suitable solvent,  such  as  water,  which  preferentially  dissolves  the  catalyst  but  not the  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compound.     The  solvent  is filtered,   and   the   insoluble   increased  binding  energy   hydrogen   compound crystals   are  collected.<br>
According  to an  alternative  method for isolating and purifying the increased   binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds,  the  remaining  catalyst  is dissolved   and   the   increased   binding  energy   hydrogen   compounds   are suspended   in   a   suitable  solvent  which  preferentially   dissolves   the catalyst  but  not  the  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds.     The increased   binding  energy  hydrogen  compound   crystals   are   then   allowed to grow on the surfaces of the cell.    The solvent is then poured off and the   increased   binding   energy  hydrogen   compound  crystals  are   collected.<br>
Increased   binding  energy   hydrogen  compounds  may   also   be purified  from the catalyst,  such as a potassium  salt catalyst for example, by a process which uses different cation exchanges of the catalyst or increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds,  or  anion  exchanges  of<br>
the catalyst.    The exchanges change the difference in solubility of the increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds   relative  to   the  catalyst  or other  ions  present.     Alternatively,  the  increased  binding  energy hydrogen  compounds  may  be  precipitated  and  recrystallized,  exploiting differential  solubility in solvents such as organic  solvents  and organic solvent/aqueous  mixtures.     Yet  another  method  of isolating  and  purifying the  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds  from  the  catalyst  is to utilize  thin layer, gas, or liquid chromatography,  such as  high  pressure liquid  chromatography  (HPLC).<br>
Increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds   may   also  be purified  by  distillation,  sublimation,  or cryopumping  such  as  under reduced  pressure,  such  as   10  Âµtorr to  1 torr.    The mixture of compounds is placed in a heated vessel containing a vacuum and possessing a cryotrap.    The cryotrap may comprise a cold finger or a section of the vessel  having  a  temperature  gradient.     The  mixture  is heated.     Depending on  the  relative  volatilities  of the components of the mixture,  the increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds   are  collected  as   the sublimate  or  the   residue.     If the  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen compounds  are  more  volatile  than  the  other components  of the  mixture, then  they  are  collected  in the cryotrap.     If the  increased binding  energy hydrogen  compounds  are   less  volatile,   the  other  mixture  components   are collected  in  the  cryotrap,  and  the   increased  binding  energy  hydrogen compounds  are  collected  as  the  residue.<br>
One  such  method  to  purify  increased  binding  energy   hydrogen compounds  from  a catalyst such as  a potassium  salt comprises distillation or sublimation.    The catalyst, such as a potassium salt, is distilled off or sublimed   and   the   residual   increased   binding  energy   hydrogen  compound crystals  remains.     Accordingly,  the  product of the  hydride  reactor is dissolved in a solvent such as water, and the solution is filtered, to remove  particulates  and  or contaminants.     The  anion  of the  catalyst  is then  exchanged  to  increase  the  difference  in  the  boiling  points  of increased  binding  energy  hydrogen   compounds   versus  the  catalyst.     For example,  nitrate  may  be exchanged  for carbonate  or  iodide  to reduce  the boiling point of the catalyst.    In the case of a carbonate catalyst anion, nitrate may  replace carbonate  with  the addition of nitric acid.     In the case  of an iodide catalyst anion, nitrate may replace iodide with the oxidation of the iodide to iodine with  H2O2 and nitric acid to yield the<br>
nitrate.    Nitrite replaces the iodide ion with the addition of nitric acid only.    In the final step of the method, the converted catalyst salt is sublimed   and   the   residual   increased  binding  energy   hydrogen   compound crystals   are  collected.<br>
Another  embodiment  of the  method  to  purify   increased  binding energy hydrogen compounds  from a catalyst,  such as  a potassium  salt, comprises   distillation,   sublimation,   or  cryopumping   wherein  the increased   binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds  have   a  higher  vapor pressure   than  the  catalyst.     Increased  binding  energy   hydrogen compound crystals are  the distillate or sublimate which is  collected.    The separation  is increased by exchanging the anion of the catalyst to increase  its  boiling point.<br>
In   another  embodiment  of the  increased  binding  energy   hydrogen compound  isolation  method,  substitution  of the catalyst  anion  is employed such that the resulting compound has a low melting point.    A mixture   comprising   increased   binding  energy   hydrogen   compounds   is melted.     The   increased   binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds  are insoluble  in the  melt and thus precipitates from the melt.    The melting is conducted   under   vacuum   such   that  the   anion-exchanged   catalyst   product such   as  potassium  nitrate  partially  sublimes.     The  mixture  comprising increased   binding   energy   hydrogen  compound   precipitate   is  dissolved   in a minimum  volume  of a suitable  solvent  such  as water which preferentially  dissolves   the   catalyst  but  not  the  increased   binding  energy hydrogen  compound  crystals.     Or,  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen compounds  are precipitated  from a dissolved mixture.     The mixture is then   filtered   to  obtain   increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compound crystals.<br>
One   approach   to   purifying   increased  binding  energy  hydrogen compounds  comprises   precipitation   and  recrystallization.     In  one  such method,   increased   binding   energy   hydrogen   compounds   are recrystalli/ed   from   an   iodide   solution  containing  increased  binding energy  hydrogen  compounds  and  one  or  more  of potassium,  lithium  or sodium  iodide  which  will  not precipitate  until  the  concentration  is greater than  about   10  M.     Thus,  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen compounds  can  be  preferentially  precipitated.     In  the  case  of a carbonate solution, the iodide can be formed by neutralization with hydro iodic acid (HI).<br>
According  to one  such  embodiment  to purify increased  binding energy  hydrogen  compounds  from  a potassium  iodide  catalyst,  the   Kl catalyst is rinsed from the gas cell, gas discharge cell or plasma torch hydride reactor and filtered.     The concentration  of the filtrate  is  then adjusted  to  approximately  5  M  by  addition of water or by  concentration via  evaporation.     Increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compound   crystals are permitted to form on standing.    The precipitate is then filtered.       In one   embodiment,   increased   binding   energy   hydrogen   compounds   are precipitated from an acidic solution (e.g. the pH range 6 to   1) by addition of an acid such as nitric, hydrochloric, hydro iodic, or sulfuric acid.<br>
In  an  alternative  method  of purification,   increased  binding  energy hydrogen  compounds   are  precipitated  from   an   aqueous   mixture   by addjtion of a co-precipitating anion, cation or compound.    For example, a soluble  sulfate,  phosphate,  or  nitrate compound  is  added  to  cause  the increased   binding   energy   hydrogen   compounds   to   preferentially precipitate.     Increased   binding   energy   hydrogen  compounds   are   isolated from  the electrolyte of a   K2CO3  electrolytic cell by the following steps. K2CO3  electrolyte  from the electrolytic cell  is made approximately   1   M  in<br>
a  cation  that  precipitates  hydrino  hydride  ion  or  increased   binding energy  hydrogen  compounds,  such  as  the  cation  provided  by   LiNO3,, NaNO3, or Mg(NO3),.    In addition or alternatively, the electrolyte may be acidified with an acid such as  HNO3.    The solution is the concentrated until  a precipitate is formed.    The solution is filtered to obtain the crystals.    Alternatively,  the solution is allowed to evaporate on a crystallization   dish   so   that  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen compounds  crystallize  separately  from  the  other compounds.     In  this case,   the  crystals  are   separated  physically.<br>
The  increased binding  energy  hydrogen  species  can  bond to a cation  with  unpaired electrons  such  as a  transition or rare  earth  cation  to form   a   paramagnetic   or   ferromagnetic   compound.     In  one   separation embodiment,   the   increased   binding   energy   hydrogen   compounds   are separated   from   impurities,  by   magnetic   separation   in  crystalline   form   by sifting  the  mixture over a magnet  (e.g.,  an electromagnet).     The  increased binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds  adhere  to  the  magnet.     The  crystals are  then removed mechanically, or by rinsing.     In the latter case, the rinse  liquid is removed by evaporation.    In the case of electromagnetic<br>
separation,   the  electromagnet   is  inactivated  and  the   increased   binding energy  hydrogen   compound  crystals  are  collected.<br>
In   alternative   separation   embodiment,   the   increased   binding energy   hydrogen   compounds   are   separated  from  impurities,   by electrostatic  separation  in crystalline  form  by  sifting  the  mixture  over  a charged collector (e.g., a capacitor plate).    The increased binding energy hydrogen compounds adhere to the collector.    The crystals  are  then removed mechanically, or by rinsing.    In the latter case, the rinse liquid is removed by evaporation.    In the case of electrostatic  separation,  the charged  collector  is  inactivated  and  the increased binding  energy hydrogen  compound  crystals   are  collected.<br>
The   increased   binding  energy   hydrogen  compounds   are substantially  pure   as  isolated  and  purified  by  the  exemplary  methods given  herein.     That is,  the isolated material comprises  greater than  50 atomic  percent of said compound.<br>
The cation of the isolated hydrino hydride ion may be replaced by a different desired cation (e.g.   K+ replaced by  Li+) by reaction  upon heating  and  concentrating  the  solution  containing  the   desired  cation  or via   ion  exchange   chromatography.<br>
Methods of purification  to remove cations and  anions  to  obtain the desired   increased   binding  energy   hydrogen  compounds   include   those given by Bailar [Comprehensive   Inorganic   Chemistry. Editorial Board J. C. Bailar, H. J. Emeleus, R. Nyholm, A. F. Trotman-Dickenson, Pergamon Press]   including   pp.   528-529  which  are  incorporated   herein  by  reference.<br>
4. METHOD OF ISOTOPE SEPARATION<br>
The  selectivity of hydrino atoms and hydride ions to form bonds with  specific  isotopes based on  a differential  in bond energy  provides  a means to purify  desired isotopes of elements.    The term isotope  as used herein refers to any isotope given in the CRC which is herein incorporated by reference [R. C. Weast, Editor, CRC Handbook of Chemistry  and  Physics. 58th Edition, CRC Press, (1977), pp., B-270-B-354].     Differential  bond energy can arise  from a difference  in the nuclear moments of the  isotopes, and with a sufficient difference they can be separated.<br>
A method of separating isotopes of an element comprises:   1.) reacting  an  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  species  with   an  elemental<br>
isotopic mixture comprising a molar excess of a desired isotope with respect to  the  increased  binding energy hydrogen  species  to  form  a compound enriched  in  the desired isotope and  comprising  at  least one increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  species,  and  2.)  purifying  said compound enriched in the desired isotope.     A  method  of separating isotopes of an element present in one more compounds comprises:   1.) reacting   an   increased  binding  energy  hydrogen   species   with   compounds comprising an isotopic mixture which comprises a molar excess of a desired  isotope  with  respect  to  the  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen species to form a compound enriched in the desired isotope and comprising  at least one  increased binding energy  hydrogen  species,  and 2.) purifying said compound enriched in the desired isotope.     Sources of reactant  increased  binding  energy   hydrogen  species  include   the electrolytic cell, gas cell, gas discharge cell, and plasma torch cell hydrino hydride  reactors   of the  present  invention  and  increased  binding  energy hydrogen  compounds.     The  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen   species may  be  an  increased  binding energy  hydride  ion.    The  compound comprising  at  least  one  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen   species  and the  desired  isotopically  enriched  element  is  purified  by   the  methods given   herein   to  purify   compounds   containing  increased  binding  energy hydrogen  species.     The purified  compound may  be further  reacted  to form  a different  isotopically  enriched  compound  or element  by  a decomposition  reaction  such  as  a plasma  discharge  or plasma torch reaction  or  displacement  reaction  of the  increased  binding  energy hydrogen species.    The  steps  of reaction and purification such as those used by persons  skilled in the art may be repeated as many times as necessary  to  obtain  the  desired  purity  of the  desired  isotopically enriched   element   or  compound.<br>
For example, a hydrino hydride gas cell is operated with a   Kl catalyst.     The  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compound   39KHH   forms with  essentially  no  41KHI:  formed (n  is an integer).    The mixture of catalyst  and   )vKHn  may be dissolved in water, and  39KHn  may be allowed to precipitate to yield a compound which is isotopically enriched in   : 39K.<br>
Another  method  of separating isotopes  of an element  comprises:   1.) reacting  an  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  species  with  an  elemental isotopic mixture comprising a molar excess of an undesired isotope(s)  with respect to  the  increased binding energy hydrogen  species  to  form  a<br>
compound(s)  enriched  in  the  undesired  isotope(s)  and  comprising  at  least one  increased  binding energy  hydrogen  species,  and  2.)  removing  said compound(s)  enriched  in  the  undesired isotope(s).     Another  method  of separating isotopes  of an element present in one more  compounds comprises:   1.)  reacting  an  increased  binding energy  hydrogen  species  with compounds  comprising  an isotopic  mixture  which  comprises  a  molar excess of an undesired  isotope(s) with respect to the  increased binding  energy hydrogen  species  to form a compound(s)  enriched  in  the  undesired isotope(s)  and  comprising  at  least  one  increased binding  energy  hydrogen species,  and  2.)  removing  said compound(s)  enriched  in  the  undesired isotope(s).     Sources  of reactant increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  species include the electrolytic cell, gas cell, gas discharge cell, and plasma torch cell hydrino  hydride  reactors  of the  present invention  and  increased binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds.     The  increased  binding  energy hydrogen  species  may be an  increased binding energy  hydride  ion.     The compound(s)   isotopically  enriched   in  the   undesired  isotope(s)   and comprising  at  least  one  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  species  is removed  from  the  reaction  mixture  by  the  methods  given  herein  to  purify compounds   containing   increased   binding   energy   hydrogen   species. Alternatively,  a  compound  isotopically  enriched  in  the  desired  isotope   and not comprising  at  least one  increased binding energy  hydrogen  species  is purified  from  the  reaction  product  mixture.     The purified  compound isotopically  enriched  in  the  desired  isotope  may  be  further reacted  to  form a different  isotopically enriched compound  or element by  a decomposition or displacement reaction.    The steps of reaction and purification such as those used by persons skilled in the art may be repeated as many times as necessary to obtain the desired purity  of the  desired isotopically  enriched element   or  compound.<br>
For example, a hydrino hydride gas cell is operated with a   KI catalyst.     The  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compound   39KHn   forms with  essentially  no   KHn  formed (n  is an integer).    The mixture of catalyst  and   WA7/,,  may  be dissolved in  water, and   -39KHn  may  be  allowed to precipitate to  yield a compound  in solution which  is isotopically enriched in   41K.<br>
Differential  bond energy can arise from a difference in the nuclear moments of the isotopes, and with a sufficient difference they can be separated.     This   mechanism  can  be  enhanced  at  lower temperatures.<br>
Thus,  separation  can  be  enhanced  by  forming  the  increased  binding energy   compounds   and  performing   the   separation   at   lower   temperature.<br>
5. IDENTIFICATION OF INCREASED BINDING ENERGY HYDROGEN COMPOUNDS<br>
The  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds  may  be identified by a variety of methods such as:   1.) elemental analysis, 2.) solubility, 3.) reactivity, 4.) melting point, 5.) boiling point, 6.) vapor pressure  as  a  function  of temperature,  7.)  refractive  index,  8.)  X-ray photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS), 9.)  gas chromatography,   10.)  X-ray diffraction  (XRD),   11.)  calorimetry,   12.) infrared spectroscopy  (IR),   13.) Raman   spectroscopy,   14.)  Mossbauer  spectroscopy,   15.)  extreme ultraviolet  (EUV)  emission  and  absorption  spectroscopy,   16.)  ultraviolet (UV)  emission and absorption  spectroscopy,   17.) visible emission  and absorption   spectroscopy,   18.)   nuclear  magnetic   resonance   spectroscopy, 19.)  gas phase  mass spectroscopy of a heated  sample  (solid probe quadrapole   and   magnetic   sector  mass   spectroscopy),   20.)   time-of-flight-secondary-ion-mass-spectroscopy   (TOFSIMS),   21.)   electrospray-ionization-time-of-flight-mass-spectroscopy   (ESITOFMS),   22.) thermogravimetric   analysis   (TGA),   23.)   differential   thermal   analysis (DTA), and 24.) differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).<br>
XPS  dispositively  identifies  each  increased  binding  energy hydrogen  species  of a  compound  by  its  characteristic  binding  energy. High resolution mass spectroscopy such as TOFSIMS and ESITOFMS provides  absolute  identification  of  an  increased  binding  energy   hydrogen compound based on its unique high resolution mass.    The XRD pattern of each  hydrino  hydride compound is  unique and provides  for its  absolute identification.     Ultraviolet  (UV)  and  visible emission  spectroscopy  of excited   increased   binding   energy   hydrogen   compounds   uniquely   identify them   by   the  presence   of characteristic   hydrino  hydride  ion  continuum lines   and/or  characteristic  emission   lines   of increased  binding  energy hydrogen  species  of each  compound.     Spectroscopic  identification  of increased   binding  energy   hydrogen  compounds  is  obtained   by performing  extreme  ultraviolet  (EUV)  and  ultraviolet  (UV)  emission spectroscopy  and  mass  spectroscopy  of volatilized purified  crystals.     The excited  emission  of increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds  is observed wherein the source of excitation is a plasma discharge,  and the<br>
mass  spectrum  is  recorded  with  an  on-line mass  spectrometer to  identify volatilized compounds.     An in situ method to  spectroscopically  identify the  catalysis  of hydrogen to  form hydrinos  and  to  identify  hydrino hydride  ions  and  increased  binding  energy hydrogen  compounds  is  online EUV and UV spectroscopy and a mass spectroscopy of a hydrino hydride reactor of the present invention.    The emission spectrum  of the catalysis of hydrogen and the emission due to formation and excitation of hydrino   hydride   compounds   is  recorded.<br>
Increased   binding   energy   hydrogen   compounds   were   dispositively identified by the disclosed methods as given in the EXPERIMENTAL Section.<br>
6. DIHYDRINO<br>
The  theoretical introduction to dihydrinos is  provided  in the  '96<br>
Mills GUT.   Two hydrino atoms  may react to form a diatomic<br>
molecule  referred  to as  a dihydrino <br>
 (Equation Removed)<br>
where   p  is an integer.    The dihydrino comprises a hydrogen molecule<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
having a total energy   <br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where 1c is the internuclear distance and aa is the Bohr radius. Thus, the relative internuclear distances (sizes) of dihydrinos are fractional. Without considering the correction due to zero order vibration, the bond<br>
dissociation  energy,    is given by  the difference  between<br>
the energy of two hydrino atoms each given by the negative of Eq. (1) and the total energy of the dihydrino molecule given by Eq. (24).    (The bond  dissociation energy is defined as the energy required  to break the bond).<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The  first binding energy,of the dihydrino molecular ion with consideration  of zero  order vibration is  about<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where   p is an integer greater than  1, preferably from 2 to 200.    Without considering  the correction due  to zero order vibration,  the bond<br>
dissociation  energy,    , is the difference between the<br>
negative  of the binding energy of the corresponding  hydrino atom  given<br>
by Eq<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The  first binding energy,   BÂ£p of the dihydrino molecule<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
is given by Eq. (26) minus Eq. (24).<br>
	(Equation Removed)<br>
The second binding energy, BE2, is given by the negative of Eq. (26). The first binding energy, BEt, of the dihydrino molecule with consideration of zero order vibration is about<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
 (P) where   p  is an integer greater than  1, preferably from 2 to 200.    The<br>
dihydrino  and  the  dihydrino  ion  are  further described  in  the  '96  Mills GUT,   and   PCT/US96/07949   and   PCT/US/94/02219.<br>
The  dihydrino  molecule  reacts  with a dihydrino  molecular  ion  to form  a hydrino atom   H(1/p)   and  an  increased  binding  energy  molecular ion  Hl(1/p)  comprising  three  protons  (three  nuclei  of atomic  number one)  and  two  electrons  wherein  the integer  p  corresponds  to that of the hydrino,  the  dihydrino  molecule,  and the dihydrino molecular ion.     The molecular ion  H(1/p)  is hereafter referred to  as the  "trihydrino<br>
molecular ion".    The reaction is<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Hl(1/ p)  serves as a signature for the presence of dihydrino molecules and molecular ions such as those dihydrino molecules  and molecular ions formed  by  fragmentation  of  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen compounds  in  a  mass  spectrometer,  as  demonstrated  in  the  Identification of Hydrino Hydride Compounds by Mass Spectroscopy Section and the Identification of the Dihydrino Molecule by Mass Spectroscopy  Section, infra.<br>
The  dihydrino molecule   also reacts with a proton to<br>
form  trihydrino  molecular ion   H(1/p).   The reaction is<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The binding energy,   BE, of the trihydrino molecular ion is about<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where   p  is an integer greater than   1, preferably from 2 to 200.<br>
A  method  to prepare  dihydrino  gas  from  the  hydrino  hydride  ion comprises  reacting  hydrino  hydride  ion  containing  compound  with  a source of protons.    The protons may be protons of an acid, protons of a plasma of a gas discharge cell, or protons from a metal hydride, for<br>
example    The reaction of hydrino hydride ion  with a proton is<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
One  way  to  generate  dihydrino  gas  from  hydrino  hydride compound  is by  thermally  decomposing  the compound.     For example, potassium   hydrino  hydride   is  heated  until  potassium   metal  and dihydrino gas  are  formed.     An example  of a thermal decomposition<br>
reaction  of hydrino  hydride  compound  is<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where   AT is the cation.<br>
A hydrino can react with a proton to form a dihydrino ion which<br>
further reacts with an electron to form a dihydrino molecule.<br>
The energy of the reaction of the hydrino atom with a proton is given by the negative of the bond energy of the dihydrino ion (Eq. (28)).    The energy given by the reduction of the dihydrino ion by an electron is the negative of the first binding energy (Eq. (30)).    These reactions emit UV radiation.     UV spectroscopy is a way to monitor the emitted radiation.<br>
A reaction for preparing dihydrino gas is given by Eq. (37). Sources of reactant protons comprise, for example, a metal hydride (e.g. a transition metal such as nickel hydride),    and a gas discharge cell.    In the case  of a metal hydride proton source, hydrino atoms are formed in an electrolytic  cell comprising a catalyst electrolyte and  a metal cathode which forms a hydride.     Permeation of hydrino atoms through the metal hydride  containing  protons  results  in  the  synthesis  of dihydrinos according to Eq. (37).    The resulting dihydrino gas may be collected from the inside of an evacuated hollow cathode that is sealed at one end.    The dihydrinos produced according to Eq.  (37) diffuse into the cavity  of the cathode and are collected.     Hydrinos also diffuse through the cathode  and react with  protons of the hydride of the  cathode.<br>
In the case of a gas discharge cell proton source, hydrinos are formed in  a hydrogen  gas discharge cell wherein a catalyst is present in the vapor phase.    lonization of hydrogen atoms by the  gas discharge cell provides protons to react with hydrinos in the gas phase to form dihydrino molecules according to Eq. (37).    Dihydrino gas may be purified by  gas chromatography  or by combusting  normal  hydrogen  with  a recombiner such as a  CuO   recombiner.<br>
According  to  another embodiment  of the  present  invention, dihydrino   is   prepared   from   increased  binding   energy   hydrogen compounds   by   thermally  decomposing  the   compound  to  release dihydrino gas.     Dihydrino  may  also  be  prepared  from  increased  binding energy   hydrogen   compounds   by   chemically   decomposing   the   compound. For example,  the compound  is chemically decomposed by  reaction with  a cation such as  Li* with  NiH6  to liberate dihydrino gas according  to the following methods:  1.) run a  0.57 MAT2CO3 electrolytic cell with nickel electrodes for an extended period of time such as one year; 2.) make the<br>
electrolyte about  1  M in  LiNO3 and acidify it with  HNO3; 3.) evaporate the solution to dryness; 4.) heat the resulting solid mixture until it melts; 5.) continue to apply heat until the solution turns black from the decomposition  of increased  binding energy  hydrogen  compounds  such  as NiH6 to NiO, dihydrino gas, and lithium hydrino hydride; 6.) collect the<br>
dihydrino gas, and 7.) identify dihydrino by methods such as gas chromatography,  gas phase XPS,  or Raman spectroscopy.<br>
6.1     Dihydrino Gas Identification<br>
Dihydrino gas is identified as a higher ionizing mass two in the mass spectrometer.     Dihydrino is also identified by mass  spectroscopy  by the presence of a  m/e = 4 peak and a m/e = 2  that splits at low pressure. The'dihydrino gas  peaks occur at retention times different from  normal hydrogen   during   gas   chromatography   at  cryogenic   temperatures,   after passing through a  100%   H2IO2 recombiner (e.g.  CuO recombiner).    In the<br>
case of  dihydrino gas is identified as the split m/e=2 peak<br>
in the high resolution magnetic sector mass spectrometer, as a 62.2 eV peak in the gas phase XPS, and as a peak with 4 times the vibrational energy  of normal  molecular hydrogen via Raman spectroscopy.     In the case of stimulated Raman spectroscopy, a YAG laser excitation is used to observe Raman  Stokes  and antiStokes lines due to vibration of dihydrino<br>
  that is liquefied  on the cryopump<br>
spectroscopy  stage.     A further method  of identification comprises performing  XPS   (X-ray  Photoelectron  Spectroscopy)  on dihydrino liquefied on a stage.    Dihydrinos may be further identified by XPS by their characteristic  binding energies given in TABLE  3  wherein dihydrino is present  in a compound comprising dihydrino and at least one other element.    Dihydrino is dispositively identified in the EXPERIMENTAL Section.<br>
7. ADDITIONAL INCREASED RINDING ENERGY HYDROGEN COMPOUNDS<br>
In  a further  embodiment  of the  present invention,  hydrino  hydride ions are reacted or bonded to any positively charged atom of the periodic chart such as an alkali or alkaline earth cation, or a proton.    Hydrino hydride ions may also react with or bond to any organic molecule,<br>
inorganic  molecule,  compound,  metal,  nonmetal,  or semiconductor  to form  an  organic  molecule,  inorganic  molecule,  compound,  metal, nonmetal,  or  semiconductor.     Additionally,  hydrino  hydride  ions  may react with or bond to  H3+, H3+(l/ p), H4+(1/ p), or dihydrino molecular ions<br>
Dihydrino molecular ions may bond to hydrino hydride<br>
ions  such  that  the  binding energy  of the  reduced  dihydrino  molecular<br>
ion,  the dihydrino molecule   , is less than the binding energy<br>
of the hydrino hydride  ion  of the compound.<br>
The  reactants  which  may react  with  hydrino  hydride  ions  include neutral  atoms,   negatively  or  positively  charged  atomic  and  molecular ions,  and  free radicals.     In one embodiment to form hydrino hydride containing  compounds,  hydrino  hydride  ions  are  reacted  with  a  metal. Thus,  in one embodiment of the electrolytic cell hydride  reactor, hydrino, hydrino  hydride   ion,   or  dihydrino  produced  during  operation  at  the cathode reacts with the cathode to  form a compound, and  in one embodiment  of the  gas  cell   hydride  reactor,  hydrino,  hydrino  hydride ion,   or dihydrino  produced  during  operation  reacts  with   the  dissociation material or source of atomic  hydrogen to form a compound.    A metal-hydrino   hydride   material   is   thus   produced.<br>

In  an  embodiment  of a  superconductor  of reduced  dimensionality of the  present  invention,  hydrino,  dihydrino,  and/or  hydride  ion  is reacted with or bonded to a source of electrons.    The source of electrons may  be any positively charged atom of the periodic chart such as an alkali,  alkaline  earth,  transition  metal,  inner transition  metal,  rare  earth, lanthanide,  or actinide cation to form a structure described by a lattice described in '96  Mills GUT (pages 255-264 which are incorporated by reference).<br>
Increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds   may   be  oxidized  or reduced to form  additional  such compounds by applying a voltage to the battery disclosed in the HYDRINO HYDRIDE BATTERY Section.   The additional  compounds  may  be  formed  via  the  cathode  and/or  anode  half reactions.<br>
Alternatively,   increased   binding   energy   hydrogen   compounds   may be formed  by reacting  hydrino atoms from at least one of an electrolytic cell, a gas cell, a gas discharge cell, or a plasma torch cell with silicon to form   terminated   silicon  such   as  hydrino  atom   versus  hydrogen terminated silicon.    For example, silicon is placed inside the cell such that the  hydrino  produced  therein  reacts  with  the  silicon  to  form  the increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  species-terminated  silicon.     The species as a terminator of silicon may serve as a masking agent for solid state   electronic  circuit  production.<br>
Another  application  of the  increased  binding  energy   hydrogen compounds  is as  a dopant or dopant component in the fabrication of doped  semiconductors  each  with  an  altered  band  gap  relative  to  the starting  material.     For example,  the  starting  material  may  be  an  ordinary semiconductor,   an   ordinary   doped   semiconductor,   or  an   ordinary  dopant such  as  silicon,   germanium,  gallium,  indium,  arsenic,  phosphorous, antimony,   boron,   aluminum,   Group   III  elements,   Group   IV  elements,   or Group V elements.     In a preferred embodiment of the doped semiconductor,  the  dopant  or dopant  component  is  hydrino  hydride  ion. Materials such as silicon may be doped with hydrino hydride ions by ion implantation,  epitaxy,  or vacuum  deposition  to  form  a  superior  doped<br>
semiconductor.     Apparatus  and  methods  of ion  implantation,  epitaxy,   and vacuum deposition such as those used by persons skilled in the  art are described  in  the  following  references  which  are  incorporated  herein  by reference:  Fadei  Komarov, Ion Beam Modification of Metals, Gordon and Breach   Science  Publishers,  Philadelphia,   1992,  especially  pp.-1-37.; Emanuele Rimini,  Ion Implantation: Basics to Device Fabrication.  Kluwer Academic  Publishers,  Boston,   1995,  especially  pp.  33-252;   315-348;   173-212; J. F. Ziegler, (Editor). Ion Imolantation  Science  and Technology, Second Edition, Academic Press, Inc., Boston,  1988, especially pp.  219-377.    The specific p  hydrino hydride ion (H-(n = 1/ p) where  p is an<br>
integer)  may  be  selected  to provide the  desired property  such  as band gap following  doping.<br>
  The   increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds   may  be  reacted with a thermionic cathode material to lower the Fermi energy of the material.    This provides a thermionic  generator with  a higher voltage than  that  of the  undoped starting  material.     For example,  a starting material  is   tungsten,  molybdenum,  or oxides  thereof.     In  a  preferred embodiment  of a  doped  thermionic  cathode,  the  dopant  is  hydrino hydride  ion.     Materials  such  as metals may be doped  with  hydrino hydride  ions  by  ion  implantation, epitaxy,  or vacuum  deposition  to  form a superior  thermionic  cathode.     Apparatus  and  methods  of ion implantation,  epitaxy,  and  vacuum  deposition  such  as  those  used  by persons  skilled  in  the  art are  described  in  the  following  references  which are  incorporated  herein  by  reference:  Fadei  Komarov,  Ion   Beam Modification  of Metals, Gordon and Breach Science Puonsners, Philadelphia,   1992,  especially pp.-1-37.;  Emanuele Rimini,  Ion Imolantation:   Basics  to  Device  Fabrication.

8. HYDRINO HYDRIDE GETTER<br>
Each  of the  various reactors  of the present invention  comprises:  a source of atomic hydrogen; at least one of a solid, molten, liquid, or gaseous  catalyst;  a catalysis  vessel  containing  atomic  hydrogen  and  the catalyst; and a source of electrons.    The reactor may further comprise a getter,  which functions  as a scavenger to prevent hydrino  atoms from<br>
reacting with components of the cell to  form  a hydrino hydride compound.     The  getter may  also be used to reverse  the  reaction  between the hydrinos and the cell components  to form a hydrino hydride compound containing a substitute cation of the hydrino hydride ion.<br>
The getter may comprise a metal with a low work function, such as an  alkali  or alkaline earth  metal.     The  getter may  alternatively  comprise a source of electrons and cations.    For example, the electron or cation source may be (1) a plasma of a discharge cell or plasma torch cell providing electrons and protons;  (2)  a metal hydride  such  as  a  transition or rare element hydride providing electrons and protons;  or (3)  an acid providing   protons.<br>
In  another embodiment of the  getter,  the cell  components  comprise a metal  which  is regenerated at high  temperature,  by electrolysis,  or by plasma etching, or the metal has a high work function and is resistant to reaction   with   hydrino  to  otherwise  form   hydrino  hydride   compound.<br>
In  yet another getter embodiment,  the cell  is comprised  of a material  which  reacts  with  hydrino or hydrino  hydride  ion  to  form  a composition  of matter which  is  acceptable or  superior to  the  parent material as a component of the cell (e.g.  more resilient with a longer functional  life-time).     For example,  the cell of the hydrino hydride reactor may comprise, be lined by or be coated with at least one of 1.) a material  that  is  resistant  to  oxidation,  such  as  the  compounds  disclosed herein; 2.) a material which  is oxidized by the hydrino such that a protective  layer  is  formed  (e.g.,  an  anion  impermeable  layer  that prevents further oxidation)  ;  or 3.) a material which forms a protective layer which  is mechanically  stable, insoluble in the catalysis  material, does  not diffuse into the catalysis material, and/or is not volatile at the operating   temperature  of the  cell  of the  hydrino  hydride  reactor.<br>
Increased   binding  energy  hydrogen   metal  compounds   such   as   NiHn and   H'M,;  where  n  is an  integer,  form during the operation  of the hydrino hydride reactor as shown in the EXPERIMENTAL Section, infra.   In one embodiment  of the  present  invention,   the  getter  comprises   a  metal  such as  nickel  or tungsten  which  forms  said  compounds  that decompose  to restore  the  metal  surface  of the  desired  component  of the  hydrino hydride reactor (e.g., cell wall or hydrogen dissociator).    For example, the cell of the hydrino hydride reactor is composed of metal, or is composed of quartz or a ceramic which has been metallized by, for example,<br>
vacuum deposition.    In this case, the cell comprises  the  getter.<br>
In  the  case  that  the  increased  binding  energy   hydrogen  compounds have  a lower vapor pressure than the catalyst,  the getter may a be cryotrap in  communication with the cell.    The cryotrap condenses the increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds   when  the   getter  is maintained   at   a   temperature   intermediate   between   the   cell   temperature and the temperature of the catalyst reservoir.    There is little or no condensation of the catalyst in the  cryotrap.     An exemplary getter comprising  the cryotrap 255  of the  gas cell hydride reactor is shown in FIGURE 3.<br>
In  the  case  that  the  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds have  a  higher vapor pressure  than  the catalyst, the cell possesses  a heated  catalyst reservoir in communication  with  the  cell.     The  reservoir provides  vaporized catalyst to the cell.    Periodically,  the catalyst reservoir  is  maintained  at a  temperature  which  causes  the  catalyst  to condense  with  little  or  no condensation  of the  increased  binding energy hydrogen   compounds.     The   increased   binding  energy   hydrogen compounds   are   maintained  in   the   gas  phase  at  the   elevated  temperature of the cell  and are removed by a pump such as a vacuum pump or a cryopump.     An exemplary pump 256 of the gas cell  hydride reactor is shown in FIGURE 3.<br>
The  getter may be used in conjunction with the gas cell hydrino hydride  reactor to  form  a continuous  chemical  reactor to  produce increased   binding  energy  hydrogen   compounds.     The   increased   binding energy  hydrogen  compounds  so produced  in the reactor may have  a higher vapor pressure than the catalyst.    In that case, the cell possesses a heated   catalyst  reservoir  which   continuously   provides   vaporized  catalyst to the cell.    The compounds and  the catalyst are continuously cryopumped   to  the  getter during  operation.     The  cryopumped  material  is collected,   and   the   increased   binding   energy   hydrogen   compounds   are purified   from   the   catalyst   by   the   methods   described   herein.<br>
As indicated above,  the  hydrino hydride ion can bond to a cation with  unpaired  electrons,  such  as  a  transition  or rare  earth  cation,  to form a  paramagnetic  or  ferromagnetic  compound.     In  one  embodiment  of the gas  cell  hydride  reactor,  the  hydrino  hydride  getter  comprises  a  magnet whereby  magnetic  hydrino  hydride  compound  is  removed  from  the  gas<br>
phase  by  attaching to the magnetic  getter.<br>
The electron of a hydrino hydride ion can be removed by a hydrino atom  of a higher binding energy level than the product ionized hydrino. The  ionized  hydrino hydride  ion can further undergo catalysis  and disproportionation  to release  further energy.     Over time,  the  hydrino hydride ion  products  tend  toward  the  most  stable  hydrino  hydride,  ion H'(n = II16).     By removing or adding hydrino hydride compounds, the power and energy produced by the cell may be controlled.     Accordingly, the getter takes the form of a regulator of the vapor pressure  of hydrino hydride compounds,  to control  the power or energy  produced  by  the  cell. Such  a  hydrino  hydride  compound  vapor pressure  regulator  includes   a pump  wherein  the  vapor pressure  is  determined  by  the  rate  of pumping. The   hydrino  hydride  compound  vapor pressure  regulator  also  may  include a  cryotrap   wherein  the  temperature  of the  cryotrap   determines   the   vapor pressure  of the  hydrino  hydride compound.     A  further embodiment  of the hydrino  hydride   compound  vapor  pressure   regulator  comprises   a  flow restriction   to  a  cryotrap  of constant  temperature  wherein  the  flow  rate   to the   trap   determines   the   steady   state   hydrino   hydride   compound   vapor pressure.     Exemplary   flow  restrictions  include   adjustable   quartz, zirconium, or tungsten plugs.    The plug 40 shown in FIGURE 4 may be permeable  to  hydrogen  as  a  molecular or  atomic  hydrogen  source. 9. HYDRINO HYDRIDE FUEL CELL<br>
As the product of a cathode half reaction of a fuel cell or battery, a hydrino  hydride   ion  with  extreme   stability  represents  a  significant improvement   over   conventional   cathode   products   of  present   batteries and fuel cells.    This    is due to the much greater energy release of the hydrino hydride reaction of Eq. (8).<br>
A fuel cell 400 of the present invention shown in FIGURE 9 comprises a source of oxidant 430,  a cathode 405 contained in a cathode compartment  401   in  communication  with   the   source   of oxidant  430,   an anode 410  in  an  anode compartment 402,  a  salt bridge 420 completing  a circuit   between   the   cathode   compartment   401   and   anode   compartment 402,  and an electrical  load 425.    The oxidant may be hydrinos from the oxidant source 430.    The hydrinos  react to form hydrino hydride ions  as a cathode  half reaction (Eq.  (38)).    Increased binding energy hydrogen compounds may provide hydrinos.    The hydrinos may be  supplied to  the cathode  from the oxidant source 430 by  thermally or chemically<br>
decomposing  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds.     The hydrino  may  be  obtained by  the reaction of an increased  binding  energy hydrogen  compound  with  an  element  that  replaces  the   increased  binding energy hydrogen species in the compound.    Alternatively,  the  source of oxidant 430 may be an electrolytic cell, gas cell, gas discharge cell, or plasma torch cell  hydrino hydride reactor of the present  invention.     An alternative  oxidant  of the  fuel  cell  400  comprises  increased  binding energy hydrogen compounds.    For example, a cation   M"+ (where  n is an integer) bound to a hydrino hydride ion such that the binding energy of the cation or atom  M1)+ is less than the binding energy of the hydrino<br>
hydride ion     may serve as the oxidant.    The source of oxidant 430,<br>
such as    may be an electrolytic cell, gas cell, gas discharge cell,<br>
or plasma  torch  cell  hydrino  hydride  reactor of the  present  invention.<br>
In  another  fuel  cell  embodiment,  a hydrino  source  430 communicates  with  vessel 400 via  a hydrino passage  460.     Hydrino source 430  is a hydrino-producing cell according to  the  present invention, i.e., an electrolytic cell, a gas cell, a gas discharge cell, or a plasma  torch  cell.     Hydrinos  are  supplied via hydrino passage 460.<br>
The   introduced  hydrinos,   react with electrons  at  the  cathode<br>
405 of the fuel cell to form hydrino hydride ions,  H-(1/ p).    A reductant reacts with  the anode 410 to supply electrons to flow through the load 425  to the cathode 405, and a suitable cation completes the circuit by migrating   from  the  anode  compartment  402  to  the  cathode  compartment 401   through the salt bridge 420.    Alternatively, a suitable anion such as a  hydrino  hydride  ion  completes  the  circuit  by  migrating  from  the cathode  compartment  401   to   the   anode   compartment  402   through   the salt  bridge  420.     The  reductant  may  be  any  electrochemical  reductant, such  as zinc.    In one embodiment,  the reductant has  a high oxidation potential  and  the  cathode  may  be  copper.<br>
The cathode half reaction of the cell is:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The anode half reaction is:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The overall cell reaction is:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
In  one embodiment of the fuel cell,  the  cathode compartment 401 functions as the cathode.    In that embodiment,  the cathode may  serve as a  hydrino   getter.<br>
10. HYDRINO HYDRIDE BATTERY<br>
A battery according to the present invention is shown in FIGURE 9A.     In  battery  400',  the  increased binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds are oxidants; they comprise the oxidant of the cathode half reaction of the_ battery.    The  oxidant may be, for example,  an increased binding energy  hydrogen  compound  comprising  a  dihydrino  molecular  ion  bound to a hydrino hydride ion  such that the binding  energy of the  reduced<br>
dihydrino  molecular  ion,  the  dihydrino  molecule  , is less<br>
than  the  binding  energy of the  hydrino hydride  ion   One such<br>
oxidant is  the compound    where   p  of the dihydrino<br>
molecular ion is 2 and  p'  of the hydrino hydride ion is  13,  14,  15,  16,  17, 18, or  19.<br>
An alternative oxidant may be a compound comprising a cation   M++ (where   n  is an integer) bound to a hydrino hydride ion such that the binding energy of the cation or atom   is less than the binding energy<br>
of the hydrino hydride ion    Cations may be selected from those<br>
given in Table 2-1. lonization Energies of the Elements (eV) [R. L. DeKock, H. B. Gray, Chemical  Structure and  Bonding. The Benjamin Cummings Publishing  Company.  Menlo  Park,  CA,  (1980)  pp.  76-77,  incorporated herein  by  reference]   such  that  the  n-th  ionization  energy   lPn  to form the<br>
cation   M"'  from  M  (where  n  is an integer) is less than the binding<br>
energy  of the hydrino  hydride  ion      Alternatively,  a hydrino<br>
hydride ion may be selected for a given cation such that the hydrino<br><br>
hydride ion is not oxidized by the cation.    Thus, the oxidant  M"+ <br>
comprises a cation  M", where n  is an integer and the hydrino hydride ion<br>
where p is an integer greater than  1, that is selected such that its binding energy is greater than that of M(n-1)+.   For example, in the case of He-(H-(1/ p) or Fe4 (H-(l / p))4, p of the hydrino hydride ion may be  11  to<br>
20 because  the binding energy of  He+ and Fe is 54.4 eV and 54.8 eV, respectively.    Thus, in the case of He2+ (H-(1/ p))o, the hydride ion is selected<br>
to have a higher binding energy than  He+ (54.4 eV).    In the case of<br>
Fe4" (H"(I / p)}    the hydride ion is selected to have a higher binding energy<br>
than   Fe+  (54.8 eV).    By selecting a stable cation-hydrino hydride anion compound,   a  battery  oxidant  is  provided  wherein  the  reduction  potential is determined by  the binding energies of the cation and anion of the oxidant.<br>
In   another  embodiment  of the  battery,   hydrino  hydride   ions complete   the  circuit  during  battery  operation  by  migrating   from  the cathode   compartment  401'   to   the   anode  compartment  402',   through   salt bridge 420'.    The bridge may comprise,  for example,  an anion conducting membrane  and/or an anion conductor.    The salt bridge may be formed of a zeolite, a lanthanide boride (such as  Mfi6, where  M is a lanthanide), or an  alkaline earth  boride (such as   MBb where  M  is an alkaline earth) which is selective as an anion conductor based on the small size of the hydrino   hydride   anion.<br>
The battery is optionally made rechargeable.    According to an embodiment  of  a  rechargeable   battery,   the  cathode   compartment  401' contains  reduced   oxidant  and   the  anode  compartment  contains   an oxidi/.ed  reductant.     The  battery  further  comprises  an  ion  which  migrates to complete the circuit.    To permit the battery to be recharged,  the oxidant   comprising   increased   binding   energy   hydrogen   compounds   must be  capable  of being  generated  by  the  application  of a proper voltage  to the  battery  to  yield  the  desired  oxidant.     A  representative  proper  voltage<br>
is from about one volt to about  100 volts.    The oxidant  <br>
comprises a desired cation formed at a desired voltage,  selected  such  that the  n-th ionization energy   IPn to form the cation M"+ from M(""1)+,  where<br>
n  is an integer, is less than the binding energy of the hydrino hydride ion<br>
, where p is an integer greater than  1. According   to   another  rechargeable   battery  embodiment,   the oxidized  reductant  comprises  a source of hydrino hydride  ions  such  as increased  binding  energy hydrogen compounds.     The  application  of the proper voltage oxidizes  the reduced oxidant to a desired oxidation  state to form the oxidant of the battery and reduces the oxidized reductant to a desired oxidation  state to form the reductant.    The hydrino hydride ions  complete a circuit by migrating from the anode compartment 402'  to the cathode compartment 401' through the salt bridge 420'.    The salt bridge 420'  may be  formed by an anion conducting  membrane  or an anipn conductor.    The reduced oxidant may be, for example, iron metal, and  the  oxidized  reductant having  a source  of hydrino hydride  ions  may be,  for  example,   potassium  hydrino  hydride  (K+H'(l/ p)).    The application<br>
of a proper voltage oxidizes the reduced oxidant (Fe) to the desired oxidation   state  (Fe4-) to form the oxidant (Fe4+ (H-(l/ p))   where  p of the<br>
hydrino hydride ion is an integer from  11  to 20).      The application of the proper  voltage  also  reduces  the  oxidized  reductant  (AT+) to the desired oxidation  state  (K')  to  form  the reductant (potassium  metal).    The hydrino  hydride  ions  complete  the  circuit  by  migrating  from  the  anode compartment  402'   to  the  cathode  compartment  401'   through   the   salt bridge   420'.<br>
In  an embodiment of the  battery,  the  reductant includes  a  source of protons  wherein the protons complete  the circuit by migrating from the  anode   compartment  402'  to  the  cathode  compartment  401'   through the salt bridge 420'.    The salt bridge may be a proton conducting membrane   and/or   a   proton   conductor  such   as   solid   state   perovskite-type proton   conductors   based  on    SrCeU3, such as  SrCeU3YomNbOMO2-,  and  SrCeU3YomNbOMO2-, -alpha.     Sources  of protons  include  compounds  comprising hydrogen   atoms,   molecules,   and/or  protons  such  as   the  increased  binding energy   hydrogen   compounds,   water,   molecular  hydrogen,   hydroxide, ordinary   hydride   ion,   ammonium   hydroxide,   and   HX  wherein   X' is a halogen  ion.    For example, oxidation of the reductant comprising a source of protons  generates protons  and a gas  which may be vented while operating   the   battery.<br>
In  another  embodiment  of a  rechargeable  battery,  application  of  a voltage  oxidizes  the reduced  oxidant  to the desired oxidation  state  to form  the oxidant,  and reduces the oxidized reductant to a desired oxidation state  to  form the reductant.    Protons complete the circuit by migrating   from   the  cathode   compartment  401'   to  the  anode   compartment 402'  through  the  salt bridge  420'  such  as a proton  conducting  membrane and/or   a  proton   conductor.<br>
In  an  embodiment  of the  battery,  the  oxidant  and/or  reductant  are molten  with heat  supplied by the  internal resistance of the  battery  or by external  heater 450'.     Hydrino hydride ions  and/or protons  of the  molten battery  reactants  complete  the  circuit  by  migrating  through  the   salt bridge   420'.<br>
In  another  embodiment  of the  battery,   the  cathode   compartment 401'  and/or the cathode 405'  may formed by, lined by,  or coated with  at least one of the following  1.) a material that is resistant to oxidation such as  increased  binding energy  hydrogen compounds;  2.)  a  material  which  is oxidized by the oxidant such  that a protective layer is formed, e.g., an anion   impermeable   layer   that   prevents   further   oxidation   wherein   the cathode  layer is  electrically conductive;  3.) a material  which  forms  a protective  layer  which  is  mechanically  stable,  insoluble  in  the  oxidant material,  and/or  does  not  diffuse  into  the  oxidant  material  wherein  the cathode   layer  is  electrically  conductive.<br>
To  prevent  corrosion,   the  increased  binding  energy   hydrogen compounds  comprising  the  oxidant  may  be  suspended  in  vacuum  and/or may   be  magnetically  or electrostatically  suspended  such  that  the  oxidant does  not oxidize  the cathode compartment 401'.     Alternatively,  the oxidant  may  suspended  and/or electrically  isolated  from  the  circuit  when current is not desired.    The oxidant may be isolated from the wall of the cathode  compartment  by  a  capacitor or  an  insulator.<br>
The  hydrino  hydride  ion  may  be  recovered  by  the  methods  of purification   given   herein   and   recycled.<br>
In   an  embodiment  of  the   battery,   the  cathode   compartment  401' functions   as   the   cathode.<br>
A  higher  voltage  battery  comprises  an  integer  number   72 of said battery cells in series wherein the voltage of the series, compound cell, is about   nX 60 volts.<br>
11   HYDRINO HYDRTDF FXPI OSTVE AND ROCKRT FUEL<br>
Eq.  (7) predicts that a stable hydrino hydride ion will form for the parameter   pâ‰¤24.    The energy released from the reduction of hydrino atoms to form a hydrino hydride ion goes through a maximum;  whereas, the magnitude of the total energy of the dihydrino molecule (Eq.  (24)) continuously increases as a function of p.   Thus, as p  approaches  24  the<br>
reaction of H-(n = 1/ p] to form  by the reaction with a<br>
proton  has  a  low  activation energy  and releases a thousand  times the energy of a typical chemical reaction.    The reaction of 2H'(n = l/p) to<br>
form    may also occur by thermal decomposition (Eq.  (36)) of<br>
thew hydrino hydride compound.     For example,  the reaction  of the hydrino hydride  ion   H'(n = 1/24) (having a binding energy of about  0.6535 eV)  with<br>
a proton to  form  dihydrino molecule      (having  the first<br>
binding energy of about  8,928eV) and energy is<br>
where the energy of the reaction is the sum of Eqs. (7) and (24) (which is the  total energy  of the  product dihydrino  minus the  total energy  of the reactant   hydrino   hydride   ion).<br>
As  a  further example,  the  thermal  decomposition  reaction  of<br>
 to form dihydrino molecule  is<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where   M'   is the cation of the hydrino hydride ion,  M  is the reduced cation,  and  the energy  of the  reaction is essentially the  sum of two times Eqs.  (7) and (24)  (which  is the total energy of the product dihydrino minus  the  total  energy  of the  two  reactant  hydrino  hydride  ions).<br>
One application of a hydrino hydride compound  is as an explosive. The  hydrino  hydride  ion  of the  compound  reacts  with  a  proton  to  form dihydrino  (Eq.   (41)).     Alternatively,  the  hydrino  hydride  compound decomposes to form dihydrino (e.g.  Eq. (42)).    These reactions release explosive   power.<br>
In the proton explosive reaction, a source of protons such as an acid<br>
(HF,HCl,H2SO4,orHNO3)  or a super-acid<br>
( HF + SbF,; HCI + AI,C16; H2SO3F + SbF5; or H2SO, + S02(g)) is utilized.    An explosion is initiated by rapid mixing of the hydrino hydride  ion containing compound with the acid or the super-acid.    The rapid mixing may be achieved  by detonation of a conventional explosive proximal to the   hydrino   hydride   compound.<br>
In  the  a  rapid thermal  decomposition  of a  hydrino  hydride compound  to produce an explosive reaction,  the decomposition  may be caused by  the detonation of a conventional explosive  proximal  to the hydrino  hydride  compound  or by percussion  heating  of the  hydrino hydride compound.     For example, a bullet may be tipped with a hydrino hydride  compound  which  detonates  on  impact  via  percussion  heating.<br>
In  one  preferred  embodiment,  the  cation  of the  hydrino  hydride ion in the explosive is the lithium ion (Li+) due to its low mass.<br>
Another application of the hydrino  hydride compounds  is  as a solid, liquid, or gaseous rocket fuel.    Rocket propellant power is provided by the reaction of hydrino hydride ion with a proton to form  dihydrino (Eq. (41))  or by  the  thermal  decomposition of hydrino  hydride  compounds  to form dihydrino (e.g. Eq. (42)).    In the former case, a source of protons initiates  a  rocket  propellant  reaction by  the effective  mixing  of the hydrino  hydride   ion-containing  compound  with   the  source   of protons. Mixing can be carried out by initiation of a conventional rocket fuel reaction.     In  the  latter case,  the rocket fuel reaction comprises a rapid thermal  decomposition  of hydrino  hydride  containing  compound  or increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds.     The  thermal decomposition may be caused by the initiation of a conventional rocket fuel  reaction or by percussion heating.     In one preferred embodiment of the rocket fuel,  the cation of the hydrino hydride ion is the lithium ion ( Z.f) due to its low mass.<br>
One  method  to  isolate  and purify  a compound  containing  a hydrino hydride ion of a specific  p of Eq. (7) is by exploiting the different electron  affinities  of various  hydrino  atoms.     In  a  first  step,  hydrino atoms  are  reacted  with  a  composition  of matter  such  as  a  metal  other than  an  alkali  or  alkaline earth  metal  which  reduces  all  hydrino  atoms<br>
that form stable hydride ions except that it does not react with   to<br>
form  H-(n = 1/ p) for a given  p  where  p   is an integer, because the work<br>
function of the composition of matter is too high or the free energy of the reaction is positive.     In  a second step, the nonreactive  hydrino atoms are collected and reacted with a source of electrons such as a plasma or an alkali or alkaline earth metal to form  H'(n = 1/p), including  H"(n = l/24), wherein hydrino atoms of a higher integer  p of Eq. (7) are nonreactive because they do not form stable hydrino hydride ions.    For example, an atomic beam of hydrinos is passed into a vessel comprising tungsten in the first stage, and is allowed to make pâ‰¤23  hydrino hydride ions,  and the  non-reactive  hydrinos  having   p   greater than 23  are allowed to pass through to the second stage.    In the second stage, only for p=24, a stable alkali or alkaline earth hydride is formed.    The hydrino hydride ion H-(n = l/p), including  H'(n = 1 / 24), is collected as a compound by the<br>
methods described herein for the HYDRINO HYDRIDE REACTOR.<br>
Another  strategy   for  isolating  and  purifying  a  compound  containing a hydrino hydride ion of a specific  p of Eq. (7) is by ion cyclotron resonance  spectroscopic   methods.     In  one  embodiment,  the  hydrino hydride ion of the desired  p of Eq. (7) is captured in an ion cyclotron resonance  instrument  and  its  cyclotron  frequency  is  excited  to  eject  the ion such that it is collected.<br>

According  to  one  embodiment  of the  present  invention,  catalysts are  provided  which  react  with   ordinary  hydride  ions   and   hydrino hydride  ions to form  increased  binding energy  hydride  ions.     In addition, catalysts  are  provided  which  react  with  two-electron  atoms  or ions  to form  increased binding energy two-electron atoms or ions.     Catalysts are also provided which react with  three-electron atoms  or ions to form increased  binding  energy  three-electron  atoms  or ions.     In  all  cases,  the reactor comprises a  solid, molten,  liquid,  or gaseous  catalyst; a vessel containing   the  reactant  hydride   ion,  or  two-  or  three-electron  atom  or ion; and the catalyst.    The catalysis occurs by reaction of the reactant with   the  catalyst.     Increased  binding  energy  hydride   ions  are  hydrino hydride  ions  as  previously  defined.     Increased  binding  energy  two-  and three-electron  atoms  and  ions  are   ions  having  a  higher  binding  energy than  the  known  corresponding  atomic  or ionic  species.<br>
Hydrino hydride  ion   H'(1/ p} of a desired p  can be synthesized by<br>
reduction of the corresponding hydrino according to Eq.  (8).<br>
Alternatively,  a  hydrino  hydride  ion can be catalyzed  to  undergo  a transition to  an  increased binding energy  state  to yield  the  desired hydrino hydride ion.    Such a catalyst has a net enthalpy equivalent to about  the difference  in binding energies of the  product  and  the  reactant hydrino hydride ions each given by Eq. (7).    For example, the catalyst for the   reaction<br>

where each binding energy is given by Eq. (7).    Another catalyst has a net  enthalpy  equivalent  to  the  magnitude  of the  initial  increase  in potential  energy   of the  reactant hydrino  hydride  ion  corresponding  to  an increase of its central field by an integer  m.    For example, the catalyst for the   reaction<br>

A catalyst for the transition of any atom, ion, molecule, or molecular ion to an increased binding energy state has  a net enthalpy equivalent to the  magnitude of the initial increase in potential energy  of the  reactant corresponding to an increase  of its central field by  an integer   m.

XPS is capable of measuring the binding energy,  Eh, of each electron of an atom.    A photon source with energy  Ehv is used to ionize electrons from  the sample.    The ionized electrons  are emitted  with energy   <br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where   Er is a negligible recoil energy.    The kinetic energies of the emitted<br>
electrons  are  measured  by  measuring  the  magnetic   field  strengths necessary to have them hit a detector.     Etinelk. and Ehv are   experimentally known and  are used to calculate   Eh, the binding energy of each atom. Thus,  XPS  incontrovertibly  identifies  an  atom.<br>
Increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds   are  given  in  the Additional  Increased  Binding  Energy Compounds  Section.     The binding energy  of  various  hydrino  hydride  ions  and  hydrinos  may  be  obtained according to Eq. (7) and Eq. (1), respectively.    XPS was used to confirm the production of the n = l/2 to ;; = 1/16   hydrino  hydride  ions, E,,=3eVlol3eV, the n = 1 / 2 to n = 1 / 4   hydrinos,   E,, = 54.4 eV to 217.6 eV,  and the  n = 1/2 to n = 1/4  dihydrino molecules,   Eh =62.3 to 248 eV.    In the case of hydrino atoms  and dihydrino molecules, this range is the  lowest magnitude in energy.    The peaks in this range are predicted to be the most abundant.  In the case of hydrino hydride ion,   n = l/16 is the most stable hydrino hydride ion.    Thus, XPS of the energy range Eh = 3 eVio 73 eV detects these states.    XPS was performed on a surface<br>
without   background   interference   to   these peaks by the cathode.     Carbon<br>
has  essentially  zero  background  from   0 eV to 287 eV as shown in FIGURE 10.    Thus,  in the case of a carbon cathode, there was no interference in the  n = 1/2 to n =1/16  hydrino hydride ion, the  n = l/2 to n = l/4   hydrino, and the  n = l/2 to n = 1/4   dihydrino  peaks.<br>
The  hydrino hydride ion binding energies according to Eq.  (7) are given in TABLE  1, hydrino binding energies according to Eq. (1) appear in TABLE 2, and dihydrino molecular binding energies according to Eq. (31) are given in TABLE 3.<br>

Identification  by XPS<br>
A series of XPS analyses were made on a carbon cathode used in<br>
electrolysis  of aqueous  potassium  carbonate  by  the  Zettlemoyer  Center for Surface  Studies,  Sinclair Laboratory,  Lehigh University  to identify hydrino  and  dihydrino  binding  energy  peaks  wherein  the   sample  was thoroughly   washed  to  remove   water  soluble  hydrino  hydride  compounds. A high quality spectrum was obtained over a binding energy range of 300 to OeV.    This energy region completely covers the C 2p region as well as the region around  55 eV which is the approximate location of the H(n = l/2)  binding energy,  54.4 eV, the region around  123 eV which is the approximate location of the   H(n = l/3) binding energy,   122.4 eV, the region around   218 eV which is the approximate location of the  H(n = l/4)   binding energy,   217.6 eV, the region around  63 eV  which is  the  approximate<br>
location of the dihydrino molecule     binding  energy,<br>

region  around   250 eV  which  is  the approximate location of the dihydrino<br>
molecule     binding energy,  248eV.<br>
Sample #1.    The cathode and anode each comprised a 5 cm by 2 mm  diameter high  purity  glassy  carbon rod.     The electrolyte  comprised 0.57 M K2CO3,  (Puratronic 99.999%).    The electrolysis  was performed  at<br>
2.75  volts for three weeks.    The cathode was removed from the cell, thoroughly  rinsed  immediately  with  distilled  water,  and  dried  with  a N2 stream.    A piece of suitable size was cut from the electrode, mounted on a sample stub, and placed in the vacuum system.<br>
13.1.2    Results and Discussion<br>
The 0 to   1200 eV binding energy region of an X-ray Photoelectron Spectrum (XPS) of a control glassy carbon rod is shown in FIGURE 10.    A survey spectrum of sample #1  is shown in FIGURE  11.    The primary elements  are  identified  on the  figure.    Most of the unidentified peaks  are secondary   peaks  or  loss  features  associated  with  the  primary  elements. FIGURE  12 shows the low binding energy range (0-285 eV) for sample #1.    Shown in FIGURE 12 is the hydrino atom H(n = l/2) peak at a binding<br>
energy of 54 eV, the hydrino atom  H(n = 1/3) at a binding energy of 122.5 eV, and the hydrino atom  H(n = l/4) at a binding energy of 218 eV. These broad labeled peaks are the ones of most interest because they  fall near  the  predicted  binding energy for the hydrino  (n = l/2), 54.4 eV, (n = l/3), \22AeV, and (;i = l/4), 2ll.6eV, respectively.     Although  the agreement is  remarkable,  it was  necessary  to eliminate  all  other possible known explanations before assigning the 54 eV,  122.5 eV, and 218 eV features  to  the  hydrino,   H(n = l/2), H(n = 1/3), and H(n = 1/4),   respectively. As  shown below,  each  of these possible known explanations  are eliminated.<br>
Elements that potentially could give rise to a peak near 54 eV can be divided  into three categories:   1.) fine structure or loss features associated with one of the major surface components, namely carbon  (C) or potassium  (K); 2.  ) elements that have their primary peaks in the vicinity of 54 eV, namely lithium (Li);  3.) elements  that have their secondary peaks in the vicinity of 54 eV, namely iron (Fe).    In the case of fine  structure  or loss  features, carbon is eliminated due  to the absence of such fine structure or loss features associated with carbon as shown in the XPS spectrum of pure carbon, FIGURE 10.    Potassium is eliminated because  the  shape of the 54 eV feature is distinctly different from  the recoil feature as shown in FIGURE 14.    Lithium (Li) and iron (Fe) are eliminated  due  to the  absence of the other peaks  of these  elements,  some of which  would  appear with  much  greater intensity  than  the peak of about 54 eV (e.g. the 710 and 723 eV peaks of Fe  are missing from the survey scan and the oxygen peak at 23 eV is too small to be due to  LiO). These XPS  results are consistent with the assignment of the broad peak at 54 eV to the hydrino,  H(n = l/2).<br>
Elements that potentially could give rise to a peak near  122.4 eV can  be  divided  into two categories:  fine  structure  or loss features associated  with  one  of the  major surface  components,  namely carbon  (C); elements  that  have  their secondary  peaks  in  the  vicinity  of  122.4 eV, namely  copper  (CM) and iodine (/).    In the case of fine structure or loss features,  carbon  is eliminated  due  to the absence  of such  fine structure or loss features associated with carbon as shown in the XPS  spectrum of pure carbon, FIGURE  10.    The cases of elements that have their primary or secondary peaks in the vicinity of 122.4 eV are eliminated due to the absence of the other peaks of these elements, some of which would<br>
appear with much greater intensity than the peak of about  122.4 eV  (e.g. the 620 and 631  eV peaks of /  are missing and the 931  and 951  eV peaks of Cu  are missing).    These XPS results are consistent with the assignment of the broad peak at  122.5 eV to the hydrino,   H(n = l/3).<br>
Elements that potentially could give rise to a peak near 217.6 eV can be divided into two categories:  fine structure or loss features associated  with one  of the major surface components,  namely  carbon  (C); fine  structure or loss features associated with one of the major surface contaminants,   namely   chlorine   (C/).    In the case of fine structure or loss features,  carbon is eliminated due to the absence of such  fine  structure or loss features associated with carbon as shown in the XPS  spectrum of pure carbon, FIGURE  10.    The case of elements that have their primary peaks in the vicinity of 217.6 eV  is unlikely because the binding energies of chlorine in this region are  199 eV and 201 eV which does not match the peak at 217.6 eV.    Moreover, the flat baseline is inconsistent the assignment of a chlorine recoil peak.    These XPS results are consistent with  the assignment of the broad peak at 218 to  H(n = 1/4).<br>
Shown in FIGURE 13 is the dihydrino  molecular<br>
peak at a binding energy of 63 eV as shoulder on the  Na peak.    Shown in<br>
FIGURE  12 are the dihydrino    molecular peak at a<br>
binding energy of  140 eV and  the dihydrino  <br>
molecular peak at a binding energy of 249 eV.    Although the agreement is remarkable, it was  necessary to eliminate all other possible explanations before assigning the 63 eV,  140 eV, and 249 eV features to<br>
the  dihydrino,   and<br>
respectively.<br>
The   only  substantial  candidate  element  that  potentially  could  give rise to a peak near 63 eV is  77; however, none of the other  Ti  peaks  are present.     In the case of the   140 eV peak, the only  substantial candidate elements  are   Zn and Pb.    These elements are eliminated because both elements would give rise to other peaks of equal or greater intensity (e.g. 413 eV and 435 eV for Pb and 1021 eV and 1044 eV for Zn) which are<br>
absent.    In the case of the 249 eV peak, the only substantial candidate element is   Rb.    This element is eliminated because it would give rise to other peaks of equal or greater intensity (e.g. 240,   111, and   112   Rb peaks)  which   are  absent.<br>
The XPS results are consistent with the assignment of the shoulder<br>
at 63 eV to , the split peaks at 140 eV to<br>
H: H = -; 2c' = 2- , and the split peaks at 249 eV to <br>
These results  agree with  the predicted binding  energies  given  by  Eq.  (31) as shown in TABLE 3.<br>
Hydrino  atoms  and  dihydrino  molecules  may  bind  with  hydrino hydjide ions forming compounds such as   NiHn where  n is an integer.<br>
This  is  demonstrated  in  the  Identification of Hydrino  Hydride  Compounds by   Time-Of-Flight-Secondary-Ion-Mass-Spectroscopy   (TOFSIMS)   Section, and  represents  novel  chemistry.     The  presence  of hydrino  and  dihydrino peaks  is enhanced  by  the  presence  of platinum  and  palladium  on  this sample which can form  such bonds.    The abnormal breath  of the peaks, shifting of their energy, and the splitting of peaks is consistent with this type  of bonding  to  multiple  elements.<br>
13.1.3     Experimental  Method  of Hydrino  Hydride  Ion  Identification by<br>
XPS<br>
A series of XPS analyses were made on a carbon cathodes used in electrolysis  of aqueous  potassium  carbonate  and  on  crystalline  samples by the Zettlemoyer Center for Surface Studies,  Sinclair Laboratory, Lehigh   University,  to  identify  hydrino  hydride   ion  binding   energy  peaks. A high quality  spectrum  was  obtained over a binding energy  range of  0 to 300 cV.    This energy region completely covers the C 2p region and the region   around   the   hydrino   hydride   ion   binding  energies   3 eV (H'(n = 1l 2)) to 73 eV (H'(n = 1 /16)).    (In some cases, the region around  3 eV was difficult to obtain due to sample charging).    Samples #2 and #3  were prepared   as   follows:<br>
13.1.3.1    Carbon Electrode Samples<br>
Sample #2.    The cathode and anode each comprised a 5 cm by 2 mm  diameter high  purity glassy  carbon rod.     The  electrolyte  comprised 0.57 M K2CO3   (Puratronic 99.999%).    The electrolysis  was performed at<br>
2.75  volts for three weeks.    The cathode was removed from the cell, rinsed immediately  with distilled water,  and dried with a N2 stream.    A piece of suitable size was cut from the electrode, mounted on a sample stub,  and placed in the vacuum system.<br>
Sample #3.    The remaining portion of the electrode of sample #2 was stored in a sealed plastic bag for three months at which time a piece of suitable size was cut from the electrode, mounted on a sample stub, placed in the vacuum system, and XPS scanned.<br>
13.1.3.2    Crystal Samples from an Electrolytic Cell<br>
Hydrino   hydride   compounds   were   prepared   during   the   electrolysis of an aqueous solution of K2CO3  corresponding  to the  catalyst   K+ IK*.   The<br>
cell comprised a  10 gallon (33 in. x  15 in.) Nalgene tank (Model # 54100-0010).    Two 4 inch long by   1/2 inch diameter terminal bolts were secured in  the lid,  and a cord for a calibration heater was inserted through the lid.    The cell assembly is shown in FIGURE 2.<br>
The  cathode  comprised   1.)  a 5  gallon polyethylene  bucket which served  as  a  perforated  (mesh)  support  structure  where  0.5   inch   holes were drilled over all surfaces at 0.75 inch spacings of the hole centers and 2.) 5000 meters of 0.5  mm diameter clean, cold drawn nickel wire (NI 200 0.0197", HTN36NOAG1, Al Wire Tech, Inc.).    The wire was wound  uniformly  around  the  outside of the  mesh  support  as   150  sections of 33 meter length.    The ends of each of the 150 sections were spun to form    three cables of 50 sections per cable.    The cables were pressed in a terminal  connector which  was  bolted to  the cathode  terminal  post.    The connection   was  covered  with  epoxy  to  prevent  corrosion.<br>
The  anode  comprised  an  array  of   15  platinized  titanium  anodes  (10 Engelhard Pt/Ti  mesh  1.6"  x 8" with one 3/4" by 7" stem attached to the  1.6" side plated with  100 U series 3000; and 5 - Engelhard  1" diameter x  8"  length titanium tubes with one 3/4" x  7"  stem affixed to the interior of one end and plated with  100 U Pt series 3000).    A 3/4" wide tab was made at the end of the stem of each anode by bending it at a right angle to the anode.    A  1/4" hole was drilled in the center of each<br>
tab.    The  tabs were bolted to a  12.25" diameter polyethylene disk (Rubbermaid   Model  #JN2-2669)     equidistantly   around   the   circumference. Thus,  an  array  was  fabricated  having  the   15  anodes  suspended  from  the disk.    The anodes were bolted with  1/4" polyethylene bolts.     Sandwiched between each anode tab and the disk was a flattened nickel cylinder also bolted to the tab and the disk.    The cylinder was made from a 7.5 cm by 9 cm long x 0.125 mm thick nickel foil.    The cylinder traversed the disk and the other end of each was pressed about a  10    AWG/600 V copper wire.    The connection was sealed with shrink tubing and epoxy.    The wires  were  pressed into two  terminal connectors  and bolted  to  the anode terminal.    The connection was covered with epoxy to prevent corrosion.<br>
Before assembly, the anode array was cleaned in 3 M HCL for 5 mifiutes and rinsed with distilled water. The cathode was cleaned by placing it in a tank of 0.57 M K2CO3/3% H2O2 for 6 hours and then rinsing<br>
it with distilled water.    The  anode was placed in the support between the central  and  outer cathodes,  and  the  electrode  assembly  was  placed in  the tank  containing electrolyte.     The  power supply  was connected  to the terminals   with   battery   cables.<br>
The electrolyte solution comprised 28 liters of 0.57 M   K2CO3 (Alfa K2CO3,   99Â±%).<br>
The  calibration  heater  comprised  a  57.6  ohm   1000 watt  Incolloy 800 jacketed   Nichrome  heater  which  was  suspended  from   the polyethylene disk of the anode  array.     It was  powered by  an  Invar constant power (Â± 0.1% supply (Model #TP 36-18).    The voltage (Â± 0.1%) and current (Â± 0.1%)  were recorded with a Fluke 8600A digital multimeter.<br>
Electrolysis  was  performed  at 20  amps  constant current  with  a constant current  (Â± 0.02%) power supply (Kepco Model # ATE 6 -  100M).<br>
The  voltage (Â± 0.1%)  was recorded with a Fluke 8600A digital multimeter.    The current (Â± 0.5%)  was read from an Ohio  Semitronics CTA   101   current   transducer.<br>
The  temperature  (Â± 0.1   Â°C)  was  recorded  with  a microprocessor thermometer Omega HH21   using  a type  K thermocouple which  was inserted through a  1/4"    hole in the tank lid and anode array disk.    To eliminate   the  possibility  that  temperature  gradients   were   present,   the temperature  was  measured  throughout  the  tank.     No  position  variation was  found  to within the detection of the thermocouple<br>
(Â± 0.1 Â°C).<br>
The   temperature  rise  above   ambient  (Î”T = T(elecirolysis only)-T(blank)) and electrolysis power were recorded daily.    The heating coefficient was determined  "on the fly" by turning an internal resistance heater off and on,  and inferring the cell constant from the difference between the losses with and without the heater.    20 watts of heater power were added to the electrolytic cell every 72 hours where 24 hours was  allowed for steady  state  to be achieved.     The  temperature rise  above  ambient (Î”T2 =T(electrolysis +heater)-T(blank)) was recorded as well as the electrolysis   power  and   heater  power.<br>
In  all  temperature  measurements,  the   "blank"   comprised  28   liters of water in a 10 gallon (33" x  15") Nalgene tank with lid (Model #54100-00 W)).    The stirrer comprised a 1 cm diameter by 43 cm long glass rod to which an 0.8 cm by 2.5 cm Teflon half moon paddle was fastened at one end.    The other end was connected to a variable speed stirring motor (Talboys Instrument Corporation    Model # 1075C).    The stirring rod was rotated at  250 RPM.<br>
The  "blank"  (nonelectrolysis  cell) was stirred to simulate  stirring in the electrolytic cell due to gas sparging.    The one watt of heat from stirring resulted in the blank cell operating at 0.2 Â°C above  ambient.<br>
The  temperature (Â± 0.1   Â°C) of the  "blank"  was recorded with a microprocessor  thermometer  (Omega  HH21   Series)  which   was  inserted through a  1/4" hole in the tank lid.<br>
A cell that produced  6.3X1087  of enthalpy of formation of increased   binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds  was   operated  by BlackLight Power, Inc. (Malvern, PA), hereinafter "BLP Electrolytic Cell". The cell was equivalent to that described herein.    The cell description is also given by Mills et al. [R. Mills, W. Good, and R. Shaubach, Fusion Technol.  25.   103  (1994)]  except that it lacked the additional  central cathode.<br>
Thermacore   Inc.   (Lancaster,   PA)  operated  an  electrolytic  cell described by Mills et al. [R. Mills, W. Good, and R. Shaubach, Fusion Technol. 25,   103 (1994)] herein after "Thermacore Electrolytic Cell".    This cell  had produced an enthalpy of formation of increased binding energy hydrogen  compounds  of  1.6 X109 J  that exceeded the  total  input enthalpy given by the product of the electrolysis voltage and current over time by a factor greater than  8.<br>
Crystals  were obtained from the electrolyte  as  samples #4, #5, #,6, #7, #8, #9, and #9A:<br>
Sample #4.    The sample was prepared by filtering the  K2CO3 electrolyte of the BLP Electrolytic Cell described in the Crystal Samples from an Electrolytic Cell Section with a Whatman  110 mm filter paper (Cat. No.  1450 110) to obtain white crystals.    XPS was obtained by mounting the sample on a polyethylene support.     Mass  spectra (mass spectroscopy electrolytic cell sample #4) and TOFSIMS (TOFSIMS sample #5)  were  also  obtained.<br>
Sample #5.    The sample was prepared by acidifying the   / electrolyte from the BLP Electrolytic Cell with  HNO,   and  concentrating the  acidified  solution  until  yellow-white  crystals  formed  on  standing  at room  temperature.    XPS was obtained by mounting the sample on a polyethylene  support.    The mass spectra of a similar sample  (mass spectroscopy electrolytic cell sample #3), TOFSIMS spectra (TOFSIMS sample #6), and TGMDTA (TGMDTA sample #2) was also obtained.<br>
Sample #6.    The sample was prepared by concentrating the   K2CO3y electrolyte from  the Thermacore Electrolytic Cell described  in the Crystal Samples from an Electrolytic  Cell  Section until yellow-white  crystals just formed.    XPS was obtained by mounting the sample on a polyethylene support.   XRD (XRD sample #2), TOFSIMS (TOFSIMS sample #1), FTIR (FTIR sample #1), NMR (NMR sample #1), ESITOFMS(ESITOFMS sample #2)  were  also  performed.<br>
Sample #7.    The sample was prepared by concentrating 300 cc of the   K2CO3, electrolyte from the BLP Electrolytic Cell using a rotary<br>
evaporator at 50 Â°C until a precipitate just formed.    The volume was about 50 cc.    Additional electrolyte was added while heating at 50 Â°C until   the  crystals  disappeared.     Crystals  were  then  grown  over  three weeks by  allowing the saturated solution to stand in a sealed round bottom flask for three weeks at 25Â°C.   The yield was 1 g.   The XPS spectrum of the crystals was obtained by mounting the sample on a polyethylene support.    The TOFSIMS (TOFSIMS sample #8),  39K NMR ( KK<br>
NMR sample #1), Raman spectroscopy (Raman sample #4), and ESITOFMS (ESITOFMS  sample #3) were also obtained.<br>
Sample #8.    The sample was prepared by acidifying  100 cc of the K2CO3 electrolyte from the BLP Electrolytic Cell with H,SO4.   The solution<br>
was allowed to stand open for three months at room temperature in a 250 ml beaker.    Fine white crystals formed on the walls of the beaker by a  mechanism  equivalent  to  thin  layer  chromatography  involving atmospheric  water vapor as the moving phase and the Pyrex silica of the beaker as the stationary phase.    The crystals were collected, and XPS was performed.    TOFSIMS (TOFSIMS sample #11) was also performed.<br>
â€ž    Sample #9.    The cathode of a K2CO3  electrolytic cell run at Idaho National Engineering Laboratories (INEL) for 6 months that was  identical to that of described in the Crystal Samples from an Electrolytic Cell Section was placed in 28 liters of 0.6M  Â£,C0,/10%   H2O2.   200 cc of the solution was acidified with   HNO3    The solution was concentrated to  100 cc and allowed to stand for a week until  large clear pentagonal crystals formed.    The crystals were filtered,  and XPS  was performed.<br>
Sample #9A.   The cathode of a K2CO3 electrolytic cell run at Idaho National  Engineering  Laboratories (INEL)  for 6  months  that was  identical to that of described in the Crystal Samples from an Electrolytic Cell Section was placed in 28 liters of 0.6M  K2CO3/W%   H2O2.   200 cc of the solution was acidified with   HNO3.    The solution was allowed to stand open for three months  at room temperature in a 250 ml beaker.     White nodular crystals formed on the walls of the beaker by a mechanism equivalent   to   thin   layer  chromatography   involving   atmospheric   water vapor as the moving phase and the Pyrex silica of the beaker as  the stationary  phase.    The  crystals  were  collected,  and XPS  was performed. TOFSIMS (TOFSIMS sample #12) was also performed.<br>
13.1.4    Results and Discussion<br>
The low binding energy range (0-75 eV) of the glassy carbon rod cathode following electrolysis of a  0.57M K2CO3   electrolyte  before  (sample<br>
#2) and after (sample # 3) storage for three months is shown in FIGURE<br>
14 and FIGURE  15, respectively.    For the sample scanned immediately following electrolysis, the position of the potassium peaks,   K, and the oxygen peak,   O, are identified in FIGURE 14.   The high resolution XPS of the same electrode following three months of storage is shown in FIGURE 15.    The hydrino hydride ion peaks  H-(n = 1/ p) for p = 2 to p = 12, the<br>
potassium  peaks,   K, and the sodium peaks,  Na, and the oxygen peak,  O, (which is a minor contributor since it must be smaller than the potassium peaks) are identified in FIGURE  15.    (Further hydrino hydride ion peaks to p = 16 were identified in the survey scan in the region 65 eV to 73 eV (not shown)).    The peaks at the positions of the predicted binding energies  of hydrino  hydride  ions  significantly  increased  while  the potassium peaks  at   18  and 34  significantly deceased  relatively.     Sodium peaks at  1072 eV and 495 eV (in the survey scan (not shown)), 64 eV, and 31  eV (FIGURE  15) also developed with storage.    The mechanism of the enhancement of the  â€¢lydrino hydride  ion peaks on  storage  is  crystal growth from the  bulk of the electrode of a predominantly  sodium hydrino hydride.     (X-ray diffraction of crystals grown on a stored nickel cathode  showed  peaks  that could  not  be  assigned  to  known  compounds as given in the Identification of Hydrino Hydride Compounds by XRD Section.)     These  changes  with  storage  substantially  eliminate  impurities as the source of the peaks assigned to hydrino hydride ions  since impurity  peaks  would  broaden  and  decrease  in  intensity  due  to  oxidation if any change would occur at all.<br>
Isolation  of pure  hydrino  hydride  compounds  from  the  electrolyte is the means of eliminating impurities from the XPS  sample which concomitantly   dispositively  eliminates  impurities   as   an   alternative assignment to the hydrino hydride ion peaks.    Samples #4, #5, and #6 were  purified from a   K2CO3,  electrolyte.    The survey scans are shown in<br>
FIGURES   16,  18, and 20, respectively, with the primary elements identified.    No impurities are present in the survey scans which can be assigned  to peaks in  the  low  binding energy region with the exception of sodium at 64 and 31  eV, potassium at 18 and 34 eV, and oxygen at 23 eV.    Accordingly, any other peaks in this region must be due to novel<br>
compositions.<br>
The  hydrino hydride ion peaks   H-(n = 1/ p) for p = 2 to p = 16  and the<br>
oxygen peak,  O, are identified for each of the samples #4, #5, and #6 in FIGURES  17,  19, and 21, respectively.    In addition, the sodium peaks,  Na,<br>
of sample #4 and sample #5 are identified in FIGURE 17 and FIGURE 19, respectively.    The potassium peaks,   K, of sample #5 and sample # 6 are identified in FIGURE 19 and FIGURE 21, respectively.    The low binding energy range (0-75 eV) XPS spectra of crystals from a 0.57M K2CO3<br>
electrolyte (sample #4, #5, #6, and #7) are superimposed in FIGURE 22 which  demonstrates  that  the  correspondence  of the  hydrino  hydride  ion peaks from the different samples is excellent.    These peaks were not present in the case of the XPS of matching samples except that NA2CO3 replaced   K2CO3 as the electrolyte.    The crystals of sample #5 and sample<br>
#6 had a yellow color.    The yellow color may be due to the continuum absorption  of  H-(n = 1l2) in the near UV, 407 nm   continuum.<br>
During acidification of sample #5  the pH repetitively increased from 3 to 9 at which time additional acid was added with carbon dioxide release.    The increase in pH (release of base by the solute) was dependent  on  the  temperature  and  concentration  of the  solution.     This observation  was   consistent  with   HCO   release   from   hydrino  hydride compounds  such  as   KHKHCO3  given in the Identification of Hydrino Hydride   Compounds   by   Time-Of-Flight-Secondary-Ion-Mass-Spectroscopy (TOFSIMS) Section.    A reaction consistent with this observation  is  the  displacement reaction  of  NO for HCO or CO3.<br>
The  data provide  the  identification  of hydrino  hydride  ions  whose XPS peaks can not be assigned to impurities.    Several of the peaks are split such as the  H'(n- 1/4), H'(n = l/5), H(n = l/8), H-(n = 1/10), and<br>
Hâ€¢(n = 1/11) peaks shown in FIGURE 17.    The splitting indicates that several  compounds  comprising  the  same  hydrino  hydride  ion  are  present and  further indicates  the  possibility  of bridged  structures  of the compounds  given in the  Identification of Hydrino Hydride Compounds by Time-Of-Flight-Secondary-Ion-Mass-Spectroscopy   (TOFSIMS)   Section such  as<br>
including dimers such as  K2H2 and Na2H2.   FIGURE 18 indicates a water<br>
soluble  nickel  compound  (Ni is present in the survey  scan of sample #5).<br>
Furthermore,   the   peak is shown in the 0-75 eV scan<br>
of sample #5 (FIGURE 19).    The XPS and TOFSIMS results are consistent in  the  identification  of metal  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen compounds   MHn  where  n is an integer, M is a metal, and H is an<br>
increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  species.     For example,  a  structure for NiH6 is<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
The large sodium peaks of the XPS of the stored carbon cathode of a K2CO3  electrolytic cell (sample #3) and the crystals from a   K2CO3,<br>
electrolyte   (sample   #4)   indicate   that  hydrino  hydride   compounds preferentially  form  with  sodium  over  potassium.     The  hydrino  hydride ion peak  H'(n = 1/8) shown in FIGURES  15,  19, and 21 at a binding energy of 36. 1eV  is broad due to a contribution from the loss feature of potassium  at   33 eV   that  superimposes  the   hydrino  hydride  ion  peak H'(n = 1/8)  in these XPS scans.    The data further indicate that the distribution  of hydrino  hydride  ions  tends  to  successively  lower  states over time.    From Eq. (7), the most stable hydrino hydride ion is H'(n = I/16) which is predicted to be the favored product over time.    No hydrino  hydride  ion  states  of higher binding  energy   were  detected.<br>
The  stacked  high  resolution X-ray Photoelectron  Spectra  (XPS) (0 to 75 eV  binding energy region)  in  the order from  bottom to top of sample #8. sample #9. and sample #9A is given in FIGURE 23.    The hydrino hydride  ions   H'(n = 1/p) for p = 3 to p = 16  were observed.    In each case,<br>
the  intensity  of the  hydrino  hydride  ion  peaks  were  observed  to  increase relative  to  the  starting  material.     The  spectrum  for sample #9  confirms that  hydrino  hydride  compounds  were  purified  by   acidification   with nitric acid followed by precipitation.    The spectra for sample #8  and<br>
sample  #9A  confirm  that  hydrino  hydride  compounds  were  purified  by  a mechanism   equivalent   to   thin   layer  chromatography   involving atmospheric water vapor as the moving phase and the Pyrex  silica of the beaker  as   the  stationary  phase.<br>
13.2 Identification of Hvdrino Hydride Compounds bv Mass<br>
Elemental analysis of the electrolyte of the 28  liter  K2CO3 BLP Electrolytic Cell  demonstrated that the potassium content of the electrolyte  had  decrease  from  the initial  56% composition by  weight to 33% composition by weight.    The measured pH was 9.85; whereas, the pH at the initial time of operation was  11.5.    The pH of the Thermacore Electrolytic Cell  was originally   11.5 corresponding to the   K2CO3<br>
concentration  of 0.57  M  which was confirmed by elemental  analysis. Following  the   15  month continuous energy production run,  the  pH was measured  to  be  9.04,  and  it  was observed  by  drying  the electrolyte  and weighing it that over 90% of the electrolyte had been lost from the cell. The  loss of potassium in both cases was assigned to the formation of volatile   potassium   hydrino   hydride   compounds   whereby   hydrino   was produced  by  catalysis  of hydrogen  atoms  that  then  reacted  with  water  to form  hydrino hydride compound and oxygen.     The reaction  is:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
This  reaction   is  consistent  with  the  elemental   analysis  (Galbraith Laboratories)  of the  electrolyte  of the  BlackLight  Power,  Inc.  cell  as predominantly    KHCO3   and   hydrino   hydride   compounds   including KH(1 I /p)â€ž,  where   H   is  an  integer,  based  on  the  excess  hydrogen  content which was 30   in excess of that of KHCO3  (1.3  versus   1   atomic  percent). The volatility of  KH(1 I p}n, where n is an integer, would give rise to a<br>
potassium  deficit  over  time.<br>
The possibility of using mass spectroscopy to detect volatile hydrino hydride  compounds  was explored.     A  number of hydrino<br>
hydride  compounds  were  identified  by   mass   spectroscopy   by   forming vapors of heated crystals from electrolytic cell, gas cell, gas discharge cell, and plasma torch cell hydrino hydride reactors.    In all cases, hydrino hydride ion peaks were also observed by XPS of the crystals used for mass  spectroscopy that were  isolated  from each hydrino  hydride  reactor. For example, the XPS of the crystals isolated from the electrolytic cell hydride reactor having the mass spectrum shown in FIGURES 25A-25D is shown in FIGURE 17.   The XPS of the crystals isolated from the electrolytic  cell  hydride  reactor by  a similar procedure  as  the  crystals having the mass spectrum shown in FIGURE 24 is shown in FIGURE 19.<br>
13.2.1     Sample Collection and Preparation<br>
A  reaction   for  preparing   hydrino   hydride   ion-containing compounds is given by Eq. (8).    Hydrino atoms which react to form hydrino hydride  ions  may be  produced by   1.)  an electrolytic  cell  hydride reactor, 2.) a gas cell hydrino hydride reactor, 3.) a gas discharge cell hydrino  hydride  reactor,  or 4.)  a  plasma  torch  cell  hydrino  hydride reactor.    Each of these reactors was used to prepare crystal samples for mass   spectroscopy.     The  produced  hydrino  hydride  compound   was collected  directly,  or was  purified  from  solution  by  precipitation  and recrystallization.    In the case of one electrolytic sample,  the   K2CO3 electrolyte  was made   1M  in   LiNO3,  and acidified with  HNO3   before  crystals were  precipitated.     In two other electrolytic samples,  the   K2CO3 electrolyte  was  acidified  with   HNO3,  before  crystals  were  precipitated  on a  crystallization  dish.<br>
13.2.1.1     Electrolytic  Sample<br>
Hydrino   hydride   compounds   were   prepared   during   the   electrolysis of an aqueous solution of  K2CO3   corresponding  to  the   transition   catalyst<br>
K / KT.    The cell description is given in  the Crystal  Samples from an Electrolytic Cell Section.    The cell assembly is shown in FIGURE 2.<br>
Crystal   samples   were   obtained  from  the  electrolyte   as  follows:<br>
1.)  A control electrolytic cell that was identical to the experimental cell of 3 and 4 below except that  Na2CO3 replaced  K2CO3   was  operated  at Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) for 6 months.    The  Na2CO3<br>
electrolyte  was  concentrated  by  evaporation  until  crystals  formed.     The crystals  were  analyzed  at BlackLight Power,  Inc.  by  mass  spectroscopy.<br>
2.) A further control comprised the   K2CO3  used as the electrolyte of the INEL K2CO3, electrolytic cell (Alfa  K2CO3,   99Â±%).<br>
3.) A crystal sample was prepared by:   1.) adding   LiNO to the<br>
electrolyte from the BLP Electrolytic Cell to a final concentration of 1  M; 2.) acidifying the solution with  HNO3, and 3.) concentrating the acidified<br>
solution  until  yellow-white  crystals  formed  on  standing  at  room temperature.    XPS and mass spectra were obtained.    XPS (XPS sample #5), TOFSIMS (TOFSIMS sample #6), and TGMDTA (TGMDTA sample #2) of -similar   samples   were  performed.<br>
4.)  A crystal  sample was prepared by filtering  the   K2CO3y   electrolyte from the BLP Electrolytic Cell with a Whatman  110 mm filter paper (Cat. No.   1450  110).    In addition to mass spectroscopy, XPS (XPS sample #4) and TOFSIMS (TOFSIMS sample #5) were also performed.<br>
5.)  and  6.)  Two  crystal  samples  were  prepared  from  the  electrolyte of the Thermacore Electrolytic Cell by  1.) acidifying 400 cc of the  K2CO3 electrolyte   with   HNO  2.) concentrating the acidified  solution to a volume of 10 cc. 3.) placing the concentrated solution on a crystallization dish, and 4.) allowing crystals to form slowly upon standing at room temperature.     Yellow-white  crystals  formed  on  the  outer edge  of the crystallization dish.    In addition to mass spectroscopy, XPS (XPS  sample #10), XRD (XRD samples #3A and #3B), TOFSIMS (TOFSIMS sample #3), and  FTIR  (FTIR  sample  #4)  were  also performed.<br>
13.2.2.2    Gas Cell Sample<br>
Hydrino  hydride  compounds  were  prepared  in   a  vapor  phase  gas cell  with  a tungsten  filament and   KI as the catalyst according to Eqs. (3-5) and the  reduction to hydrino hydride ion (Eq. (8)) occurred in the gas phase.    Rbl  was also used as a catalyst because the second ionization energy of rubidium  is   27.28 eV .    In this case, the catalysis reaction is<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
And,  the overall reaction is<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The high temperature experimental gas cell shown in FIGURE 4 was used to  produce  hydrino  hydride  compounds.     Hydrino  atoms  were  formed  by hydrogen  catalysis  using  potassium  or  rubidium  ions  and   hydrogen atojns in the gas phase.    The cell was rinsed with deionized water following  a reaction.    The rinse was filtered,  and hydrino  hydride compound   crystals   were   precipitated   by   concentration.<br>
The experimental  gas cell hydrino hydride reactor shown  in FIGURE 4 comprised a quartz cell in  the form of a quartz tube 2 five hundred (500)  millimeters  in  length  and fifty  (50)  millimeters  in diameter.    The quartz cell formed a reaction vessel.    One end of the cell was necked down  and  attached  to  a  fifty  (50)  cubic  centimeter  catalyst  reservoir  3. The other end of the cell was fitted with a Conflat style high vacuum flange that was  mated to a Pyrex cap 5  with an identical Conflat style flange.    A high  vacuum seal was maintained with a Viton O-ring and stainless  steel  clamp.    The  Pyrex cap 5  included five glass-to-metal  tubes for the attachment of a gas inlet line 25 and gas outlet line 21, two inlets 22 and 24 for electrical leads 6, and a port 23 for a lifting rod 26.    One end of the pair of electrical leads was connected to a tungsten filament 1, The other end was connected to a Sorensen DCS  80-13 power supply 9 controlled  by a  custom  built  constant power controller.     Lifting  rod  26 was  adapted  to  lift a quart/,  plug 4  separating the catalyst  reservoir 3 from  the  reaction  vessel  of cell  2.<br>
H,  gas was  supplied  to the cell  through  the inlet 25  from  a compressed  gas   cylinder  of  ultra  high  purity  hydrogen   11   controlled   by hydrogen control  valve   13.     Helium gas was supplied to the cell through the  same  inlet  25  from  a compressed gas cylinder of ultrahigh  purity helium  12 controlled by helium control valve  15.    The flow of helium and<br>
hydrogen to the  cell is further controlled by mass  flow controller  10. mass  flow controller valve 30, inlet valve 29, and mass flow controller bypass valve 31.    Valve 31 was closed during filling of the cell.    Excess gas was removed  through the gas outlet 21  by a molecular drag pump  8 capable  of reaching pressures of 10-4  torr controlled  by  vacuum pump valve  27  and  outlet valve  28.     Pressures  were  measured  by  a 0-1000 torr  Baratron  pressure  gauge  and  a 0-100  torr  Baratron  pressure  gauge 7.    The  filament   1   was 0.381   millimeters in diameter and  two hundred (200) centimeters in length.    The filament was  suspended  on  a ceramic support  to  maintain  its  shape  when heated.     The  filament  was  resistively heated using power supply 9.    The power supply was capable of delivering  a constant power to the filament.    The catalyst  reservoir 3  was heated  independently  using  a  band  heater 20,  also  powered  by  a constant power supply.    The entire quartz cell  was enclosed  inside an insulation package comprised of Zicar AL-30 insulation  14.    Several  K type  thermocouples  were  placed  in  the  insulation  to  measure  key temperatures  of the  cell  and  insulation.     The  thermocouples  were  read with   a  multichannel   computer  data   acquisition   system.<br>
The  cell  was  operated  under flow  conditions  with  a  total  pressure of less than two (2) torr of hydrogen or control helium via mass flow controller   10.    The  filament  was  heated  to a temperature  of approximately   1000-1400Â°C  as  calculated  by  its  resistance.     This  created a "hot zone" within the quartz tube as well as atomization of the hydrogen  gas.    The  catalyst  reservoir was  heated  to  a temperature  of 700 Â°C to establish the vapor pressure of the catalyst.    The quartz plug 4 separating  the catalyst  reservoir 3  from  the reaction  vessel  2  was removed using the lifting rod 26 which was slid about 2 cm through the port  23.    This  introduced the  vaporized catalyst into  the  "hot zone" containing  the  atomic  hydrogen,  and  allowed  the  catalytic  reaction  to occur.<br>
As  described   above,   a   number  of  thermocouples   were   positioned   to measure   the   linear  temperature   gradient   in   the   outside   insulation.     The gradient   was   measured   for   several   known   input  powers   over   the experimental  range  with  the  catalyst  valve  closed.     Helium  supplied  from the tank  12 and controlled by the valves  15, 29, 30, and 31, and flow controller   10  was  flowed through  the  cell during  the  calibration  where<br>
the  helium  pressure and  flow rates  were  identical  to  those  of hydrogen in  the experimental  cases.    The  thermal  gradient was  determined  to  be linearly  proportional  to  input  power.     Comparing  an  experimental gradient  (catalyst  valve  open/hydrogen  flowing)   to   the  calibration gradient  allowed  the  determination  of the  requisite  power  to  generate that gradient.    In this way, calorimetry was performed on  the cell to measure the heat output with a known input power.    The  data was recorded  with  a  Macintosh  based  computer  data  acquisition  system (PowerComputing  PowerCenter Pro   180)  and  a  National  Instruments,   Inc. NI-DAQ PCI-MIO-16XE-50 Data Acquisition Board.<br>
Enthalpy of catalysis from the gas energy cell having a gaseous transition   catalyst   (K+ IK+)  was  observed with  low  pressure  hydrogen  in the-presence  of potassium  iodide  (KI) which was volatilized at the operating temperature  of the cell.    The enthalpy of formation  of increased   binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds   resulted   in   a  steady   state power of about   15  watts  that  was  observed  from  the  quartz  reaction vessel containing  about 200 mtorr of  KI when  hydrogen   was  flowed  over the  hot  tungsten  filament.     However,  no  excess  enthalpy  was  observed when  helium  was  flowed  over  the  hot tungsten  filament  or  when hydrogen  was  flowed over the  hot tungsten filament with  no   KI   present in the cell.    In a separate experiment  Rbl replaced  KI  as the gaseous transition   catalyst   (Rb-).<br>
In   another  embodiment,   the   experimental  gas   cell   hydrino   hydride reactor shown in FIGURE 4 comprised a Ni fiber mat (30.2 g, Fibrex from National Standard) inserted into the inside the quartz cell 2.    The Ni mat was used as the  H2  dissociator which replaced  the  tungsten  filament   1. The  cell  2  and  the  catalyst  reservoir 3  were each independently encased by  split type  clam  shell  furnaces  (The  Mellen  Company)  which  replaced the Zicar AL-30  insulation   14 and were capable of operating up  to   1200 CC.     The  cell  and catalyst reservoir were  heated  independently  with  their heaters   to   independently   control   the   catalyst   vapor  pressure   and   the<br>
reaction  temperature.     The   H,  pressure was maintained  at  2  torr at a<br>
flow rate of  The Ni mat was maintained at 900 Â°C, and the  KI<br>
catalyst was maintained at 700 Â°C for  100 h.<br>
The following crystal samples were obtained from the cell cap or the cell:<br>
1.) and 2.) Crystal samples from two KI  catalysis  run were prepared by   1.)  rinsing the hydrino hydride compounds  from  the  cap of the  cell  where  they  were  preferentially  cryopumped,   2.)  filtering  the solution to remove water insoluble compounds such  as metal,  3.) concentrating  the  solution until  a precipitate just formed  with  the solution  at  50 Â°C,  4.)  allowing yellowish-reddish-brown  crystals  to  form on  standing  at room  temperature,  and 5.)  filtering  and  drying  the crystals  before the XPS  and mass  spectra were obtained.<br>
3A.) and 3B.) Crystal samples were prepared by rinsing a dark colored band of crystals from the top of the cell that were cryopumped thexe during operation of the cell.    The crystals were filtered and dried before  the   mass   spectrum  was  obtained.<br>
4.) A crystal sample was prepared by  1.) rinsing the   KI   catalyst and  hydrino  hydride  compounds  from  the  cell  with  sufficient  water  that all  water soluble compounds  dissolved,  2.) filtering the  solution  to remove  water  insoluble  compounds  such  as  metal,  3.)  concentrating  the solution until a precipitate just formed with the solution at 50 Â°C, 4.) allowing  white crystals  to form  on  standing at room  temperature,  and  5.) filtering  and drying the crystals  before the XPS  and  mass  spectra  were obtained.    The crystals isolated from the cell and used for mass spectroscopy  studies  were  recrystallized  in distilled  water to  obtain high purity crystals for XPS.<br>
5.) A crystal sample from a  Rbl catalysis run was prepared by   1.) rinsing  the  hydrino  hydride  compounds  from  the cap  of the cell  where they   were   preferentially  cryopumped,  2.)  filtering  the   solution   to   remove water  insoluble  compounds  such  as  metal,  3.)  concentrating  the  solution until a precipitate just formed with the solution at 50 Â°C, 4.) allowing yellowish  crystals  to  form  on  standing  at room  temperature,  and  5.) filtering  and drying  the crystals  before the XPS  and  mass  spectra  were obtained.<br>
13.2.2.3    Gas Discharge Cell Sample<br>
Hydrino hydride  compounds  can be synthesized  in  a hydrogen  gas<br>
discharge  cell  wherein  transition catalyst is present in  the  vapor phase. The transition reaction occurs in the gas phase with a catalyst that is volatilized from the electrodes by the hot plasma current.     Gas phase hydrogen  atoms  are  generated  with  the  discharge.<br>
Experimental discharge apparatus of FIGURE 6 comprises a gas discharge cell 507 (Sargent-Welch Scientific Co. Cat. No. S 68755 25 watts,  115 VAC, 50 60 Hz), was utilized to generate hydrino hydride compounds.    A hydrogen supply 580 supplied hydrogen gas to a hydrogen supply  line valve 550, through a hydrogen  supply line  544.     A common  hydrogen  supply  line/vacuum  line  542  connected  valve  550  to gas discharge cell 507 and supplied hydrogen to the cell.    Line 542 branched to a vacuum pump 570 via a vacuum line 543 and a vacuum line valve  560.    The apparatus further contained a pressure  gage 540  for monitoring the pressure in line 542.    A sampling line 545  from line 542 provided gas to a sampling port 530 via a sampling line valve 535.    The lines  542,  543,  544,  and  545  comprise  stainless  steel  tubing  hermetically joined  using  Swagelok  connectors.<br>
With  the  hydrogen supply  line  valve 550 and  the  sampling line valve  535  closed  and  the  vacuum  line valve 560 open,  the  vacuum pump 570,   the  vacuum   line   543,   and  common  hydrogen  supply   line/vacuum line  542  were  used to obtain  a vacuum  in the discharge  chamber 500. With the sampling line valve 535  and the vacuum line valve 560 closed and  the hydrogen supply line valve 550 open, the gas discharge cell  507 was  filled  with  hydrogen at  a controlled pressure using  the  hydrogen supply  580,  the  hydrogen  supply  line 544,  and the  common  hydrogen supply  line/vacuum  line 542.     With the  hydrogen supply  line  valve 550 and  the vacuum  line valve 560 closed and the sampling line  valve 535 open,  the  sampling port 530  and  the sampling line  545  were  used to obtain a gas  sample  for study  by methods such as  gas chromatography and   mass   spectroscopy.<br>
The gas discharge cell  507 comprised a  10" flint glass (1/2"  ID) vessel 501   defining a vessel  chamber 500.    The chamber contained a hollow cathode  510 and an  anode 520 for generating  an arc  discharge  in low  pressure  hydrogen.    The  cell  electrodes  (1/2"  height  and   1/4" diameter),  comprising the cathode  and anode,  were  connected to a power supply  590 with  stainless  steel  lead wires penetrating the  top  and bottom ends of the gas discharge cell.    The cell was operated at a<br>
hydrogen  pressure  range  of  10 millitorr to   100 torr  and  a current  under 10 mA.     During  hydrino hydride compound  synthesis,  the  anode  520  and cathode 510 were coated with a potassium salt such as a potassium halide catalyst (e.g.  Kl).    The catalyst was introduced inside the gas discharge cell 507 by disconnecting the cell from the common hydrogen supply  line/vacuum  line  542  and  wetting  the  electrodes  with  a  saturated water or alcohol catalyst solution.    The solvent was removed by drying the cell chamber 500 in an oven, by connecting the gas discharge cell 507 to the common hydrogen supply line/vacuum line 542 shown in  FIGURE 6, and pulling a vacuum on the gas discharge cell 507.<br>
The   synthesis  of hydrino  hydride  compounds  using   the  apparatus of FIGURE 6 comprised the following steps: (1) putting the catalyst solution inside the gas discharge cell 507 and drying it to form a catalyst coating  on  the electrodes 510 and 520;  (2) vacuuming the  gas discharge cell  at   10-30  mtorr for several  hours  to  remove  any  contaminant  gases and residual solvent; and (3) filling the gas discharge cell with a few mtorr to   100  torr hydrogen and carrying out an arc  discharge for at  least 0.5   hour.<br>
Samples  were  prepared  from  the  preceding  apparatus  by   1.) rinsing  the  catalyst from  the  cell  with  sufficient water that all  water soluble  compounds  dissolved,  2.)  filtering  the  solution  to  remove  water insoluble  compounds  such  as  metal,  3.)  concentrating the  solution  until  a precipitate just formed with the solution at 50 Â°C, 4.) allowing crystals to form  on  standing  at room  temperature,  and 4.)  filtering  and  drying  the crystals before  the XPS  and mass  spectra were obtained.<br>
13.2.2.4    Plasma Torch Sample<br>
Hydrino   hydride   compounds   were   synthesized   using   an experimental  plasma torch cell  hydride reactor according  to FIGURE  7, using   A7  as the catalyst 714.    The catalyst was contained in a catalyst reservoir 716.     The  hydrogen catalysis reaction to form  hydrino  (Eqs.  (3-5)) and the reduction to hydrino hydride ion (Eq.  (8)) occurred in the  gas phase.    The catalyst was aerosolized into the hot plasma.<br>
During  operation,  hydrogen  flowed  from  the  hydrogen  supply   738 to  the catalyst reservoir 716  via passage 742  and passage 725  wherein the flow of hydrogen was controlled by hydrogen flow controller 744 and valve 746.    Argon plasma gas flowed from the plasma gas supply 712<br>
directly to the plasma torch via passage 732 and 726 and to the catalyst reservoir 716  via passage 732  and 725  wherein the flow  of plasma gas was controlled by plasma gas flow controller 734 and valve 736.    The mixture of plasma gas  and hydrogen supplied to the  torch  via passage 726 and to  the catalyst reservoir 716 via passage 725  was  controlled by the  hydrogen-plasma-gas  mixer and  mixture  flow  regulator  721.     The hydrogen and plasma gas mixture served as a carrier gas for catalyst particles  which were dispersed into the gas stream as fine  particles by mechanical  agitation.     The  mechanical  agitator comprised  the  magnetic stirring bar 718  and the magnetic  stirring motor 720.     The  aerosolized catalyst and hydrogen  gas of the mixture  flowed into  the plasma  torch 702  and  became  gaseous  hydrogen  atoms  and vaporized  catalyst  ions  (K+ ions from  A7) in the plasma 704.    The plasma was powered by microwave  generator 724 (Astex Model  S15001).     The microwaves  were tuned  by   the  tunable   microwave  cavity  722.<br>
The amount of gaseous catalyst was controlled by controlling the rate  that  catalyst  was  aerosolized  with  the  mechanical  agitator  and  the carrier gas  flow  rate  where  the  carrier gas  was  a hydrogen/argon  gas mixture.    The amount of gaseous hydrogen atoms was controlled by controlling  the  hydrogen flow  rate  and the ratio of hydrogen  to plasma gas in the mixture.    The hydrogen flow rate, the plasma gas flow rate, and  the  mixture  directly  to the  torch  and the mixture to the catalyst reservoir  were  controlled  with  flow  rate  controllers  734  and  744,  valves 736   and   746,  and   hydrogen-plasma-gas  mixer  and  mixture   flow regulator 721.    The  aerosol flow rates were 0.8  standard liters per minute (slm) hydrogen and 0.15  slm argon.    The argon plasma flow rate was 5 slm.    The catalysis rate was also controlled by controlling the temperature  of the  plasma  with  the  microwave  generator 724.     The forward  input  power  was   1000  W,  the  reflected power was   10-20  W.<br>
Hydrino  atoms  and  hydrino  hydride  ions  were  produced  in  the plasma  704.     Hydrino  hydride  compounds  were  cryopumped  onto  the manifold 706, and flowed into the  trap 708 through passage 748.     A flow to the  trap  708  was  effected  by  a pressure gradient controlled  by  the vacuum  pump  710.  vacuum  line  750,  and  vacuum  valve  752.<br>
Hydrino  hydride  compound  samples  were  collected  directly  from the  manifold  and  from  the  hydrino hydride  compound  trap.<br>
1 15 13.2.2    Mass Spectroscopy<br>
Mass spectroscopy was performed by BlackLight Power,  Inc. on the crystals from the electrolytic cell, the gas cell, the gas discharge cell, and the plasma torch cell hydrino hydride reactors.    A Dycor System  1000 Quadrapole Mass Spectrometer Model #D200MP with a HOVAC Dri-2 Turbo 60 Vacuum System was used.    One end of a 4 mm ID fritted capillary tube containing about 5 mg of the sample was sealed with a 0.25 in. Swagelock union and plug (Swagelock Co., Solon, OH).   The other end was connected directly to the sampling port of a Dycor System  1000 Quadrapole  Mass  Spectrometer (Model  D200MP,  Ametek,  Inc.,  Pittsburgh, PA).     The  mass  spectrometer was  maintained  at  a  constant  temperature of J15 Â°C by heating tape.    The sampling port and valve were maintained at  125 Â°C with heating tape.    The capillary was heated with a Nichrome wire  heater  wrapped  around  the  capillary.     The  mass  spectrum  was obtained at  the ionization energy of 70 eV (except were indicated) at different   sample   temperatures   in  the  region   mle-0-220.   Or. a high resolution  scan  was  performed  over the  region   m le = 0-110.   Following obtaining  the  mass  spectra  of the crystals,  the  mass  spectrum  of hydrogen   (mle-2 and (w/e = 1), water (m/e = 18, m/e = 2, and (m/e = l), carbon  dioxide  (m/e = 44 and m/e = 12),  and  hydrocarbon  fragment   CH3<br>
(m/e = l5), and carbon (m/e = 12) were recorded as a function of time.<br>
13.2.3    Results and Discussion<br>
In all samples, the only usual peaks detected in the mass range m/e = to 220 were  consistent with  trace  air contamination.     Peak identifications  were  compared  to  the  elemental  composition.     X-ray photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS)  was  performed  on  all  of the  mass spectroscopy  samples  to  identify  hydrino  hydride  ion  peaks  and   to determine  the  elemental  composition.     In  all  cases,  hydrino  hydride  ion peaks were observed.    The crystals of electrolytic cell samples #3, #5, and #6, and gas cell samples #1, #2, and #5 had a yellow color.    The yellow color may be due to the continuum absorption of  H-(n = 1/2) in the near UV, 407 nm continuum.    In the case of gas cell samples #1, #2, and #5, this assignment was supported by the XPS  results which showed a large peak at the binding energy of H-(n = l/2), 3 eV (TABLE 1).<br>
XPS  was also used to determine the elemental composition of each sample.    In addition to potassium, some of the samples produced using a potassium catalyst also contained detectable  sodium.     The  sample  from the plasma  torch  contained   Si02 and Al  from the quartz and the  alumina of the plasma torch.<br>
Similar mass spectra where obtained for all of the samples from catalysis runs except as discussed below for the plasma torch sample.    A discussion  of the  assignment of the fragments  appears below  for some samples such as gas cell samples #1  and #2 that is representative of the types of compounds observed from the electrolytic cell, gas cell, gas discharge cell,  and plasma torch cell hydrino hydride  reactors  as  given in TABLE 4.

FIGURE 27 shows the mass spectrum (m/e = 0-110) of the vapors obtained from the cryopumped crystals isolated from the 40 Â°C cap of a gas. cell  hydrino  hydride reactor comprising a  KI   catalyst,   stainless  steel filament leads, and a   W filament (gas cell sample #1).    The sample was dynamically heated from 90 Â°C to  120 Â°C while the scan was being obtained in  the  mass range   m le-15-100.    The parent peak assignments of major  component  hydrino  hydride  compounds  followed   by  the corresponding   mle of the fragment peaks appear in TABLE 4.<br>
The   hydrino  hydride  compound   NaSiO2H6 (m I e = 89)  with  series<br>
m/e = 90-83 including the  M + l   peak  and  the  hydrino  hydride  compound HK.OH (m/e = 96) with  fragment   KOH (m/e = 95)   appeared   in   abundance with dynamic heating.    Shown in FIGURE 28A is the mass spectrum (m/e = 0-110) of the sample shown in FIGURE 27 with the succeeding repeat scan where the total time of each scan was 75 seconds.    Thus, it took about the time interval 30 to 75 seconds after heating to rescan the region   m/e = 24-60.    The sample temperature was 120 Â°C.    Shown in FIGURE 28B is the mass spectrum (mle = 0-110) of the sample shown in FIGURE 27  scanned 4 minutes later with a sample temperature of 200 Â°C. The   parent  peak  assignments  of major  component  hydrino  hydride compounds   followed  by  the  corresponding   mle  of the fragment peaks appear in TABLE 4.<br>
Comparing FIGURES 28A-28B to FIGURE 27 shows that the hydrino hydride   silicate   compound   NaSiOMb (m I e = 89)  with series  mle = 90-83 including the   M + l  peak gave rise to the fragments  SiO2 (mle = 60), SiO,H6 with  series  m/e = 66-60, and SiOH6 with series m/e = 51-44 including the M +1 peak.   The siloxane Si7H6O (mle = 78)  was observed.    The observed hydrino  hydride   silane  compounds  were  the   M + l peak of SiHn m/e = 96,<br>
5/3H8 (m/e = 92), NaSiHb with series m/e = 58-51  including the  M+1  peak, KSiH5 with series  m/e = 74 -67 including the  M + l peak, and  Si:Hs with<br>
series   m/e = 64-56.    The silane compounds gave rise to the silane peaks of Si2Ht (rn/e = 60), SiH8 (m / e = 36), SiH6 (m / e = 34), SiH4 (m / e = 32),  and SiH2 (m/e = 30).<br>
Also  present  at  the  higher temperature  was  the  hydrino  hydride compound   HK2OH (m I e = 96)  with fragment  K2OH(m/e = 95)  that gave rise to KOH(m/e = 56), a substantial   KO (m/e = 55) peak, and  AT/, (m/e = 41)  with fragments    KH(m/e = 40) and A"(m/e = 39).    In addition, the following potassium   hydrino  hydride  compounds  were   observed:   AT/5 (m I e = 44) with   fragments  series   (m/e = 44-39) including  KH2 (m/e = 41), KH(m/e = 40), and A" (m/e = 39); the doubly ionized peak  K+H+; at (me- = 22); the doubly ionized peak  KH3+ at (m/e = 21); and K2H(1/p)n n = 1 to 5  with fragment  and compound  series   (m/e = 83-78).<br>
The   following  sodium  hydrino  hydride  compounds  that  appear in FIGURES  28A-28B  were  observed  at the  higher temperature: HNa.OH (m I e = 64)   with   fragments   Na2OH (m I e = 63), NaOH (m le = 40), NaO (m/e = 39), and  NaH(m/e = 24); Na2H2 (m/e = 48)   with   fragments Nu2H(m/e = 41), Na: (m / e = 46), NaH,(m/e = 25), and  NaH(m/e = 24); and NaHj (m I e = 26)  with  fragments   NaH2 (m I e = 25) and  Nati (m 1 e = 24).<br>
The  mass  spectrum  (m/e = 0-200) was obtained of gas cell sample #1   with a  sample heater temperature of 243  Â°C.    Major peaks were observed  that  were  assigned  to  silane  and  siloxane  hydrino  hydride compounds.     Present   were   the  disilane  hydrino  hydride  compound analogue   S/,H8 (m/e = 64) with siloxane, Si2H6O (m/e = 78),  the  trisilane hydrino  hydride   compound   analogue   Si3H12 (m / e = 96) with a siloxane, SiHifiO (m/e = 110),  and  the  tetrasilane  hydrino  hydride  compound 5/4Hl(, (m/e = 128).    Also, the low mass silane peaks were seen: S/,H4 (HI / e = 60). Hâ€ž (m I c = 36), SiH, (m I e = 32), and  SiH, (m / e = 30).<br>
Shown in FIGURE 29 is the mass spectrum (m/e = 0-110) of the vapors from the cryopumped crystals isolated from the 40 Â°C cap of a gas cell   hydrino  hydride  reactor comprising  a   KI   catalyst,  stainless   steel filament leads, and a   W  filament (gas cell sample #2) with a sample temperature  of 225  Â°C.

prepared from a dark colored band at the top of a gas cell hydrino hydride  reactor comprising a   KI  catalyst,  stainless  steel filament  leads, and a  W  filament with a sample heater temperature of 253  Â°C (gas cell sample #3A) and with a sample heater temperature of 216 Â°C (gas cell sample #3B) is shown in FIGURE 30A and FIGURE 30B, respectively.    The assignments   of major  component  hydrino  hydride  compounds   and   silane fragment peaks  are  indicated.     The parent peak assignments  of typical major  component   hydrino  hydride  compounds  followed  by   the corresponding   m/e of the fragment peaks appear in TABLE 4.<br>
The spectrum of gas cell sample #3A shown in FIGURE 30A has major peaks at about  m/e = 64 and mle = 12%.    Iodine has peaks at these positions;  thus,  the  mass  spectrum  of iodine  crystals  was  obtained  under ideatical  conditions.     Iodine  was eliminated as  an  assignment to  the peaks based on the lack of a match of the iodine mass spectrum shown in FIGURE 31  with the spectrum of gas cell sample #3A shown in FIGURE 30A.    For example, the doubly ionized atomic iodine peak at  m/e = 64 compared to the singly ionized peak at    m/e = 128  has the  opposite height ratio as that of the corresponding peaks of the mass spectra of gas cell sample #3A.    The  latter spectrum also possess  other peaks  such  as  silane peaks not observed in the iodine spectrum.    The peaks of FIGURE 30A at mle = (A and /n/t = 128  are  assigned  to  silane  hydrino  hydride  compounds. The  stoichiometry  is  unique  in  that the chemical  formulae for normal silanes  is the same  as  that of alkanes;  whereas,  the formulae for hydrino hydride  silanes is  Si,,H4n  which is indicative of a unique bridged hydrogen<br>
bonding.    Only the ordinary silanes  SiH4 and Si2H4  are  indefinitely  stable at 25 Â°C.    The higher ordinary silanes decompose giving hydrogen and mono-  and  disilane,  possibly  indicating   SiH2  as an intermediate.    Also, ordinary silane compounds react violently with oxygen  [F. A. Cotton, G. Wilkinson,   Advanced   Inorganic   Chemistry. Fourth Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons.   New   York.  pp.  383-384.].     It  is  extraordinary  the  present  sample was  filtered  from  an aqueous  solution in  air.    The sample contains water as  indicated  by  the  water family  at  (m I c = 16-18),  and  the  disilane hydrino   hydride   compound   analogue   Si,H8  has  bound  water  whereby  the resulting   compound   Si,H8H:2O successively  losses all of the  H's in the series   (m/e = 82- 72) to give S/,0 (m le = 72).   Si4H16 (ml e = 128),  the tetrasilane   hydrino   hydride   compound,   and   Si6Hu (m/e = 192), the hexasilane  hydrino  hydride  compound,  are  also  seen  with  corresponding<br>
fragment peaks.     Also, the low mass silane fragment peaks  are  seen: SiHs(m/e = 36), SiH4 (mle = 32), and SiH2 (m Ie = 30).    The spectrum of gas cell<br>
sample #3B shown in FIGURE 30B also has major peaks at about mle = 64 and m/e= 128  which are  assigned to silane hydrino hydride  compounds. Present  are  the  disilane  hydrino  hydride  compound  analogue Si2H8 (mle = 64} with siloxane,  Si2H6O (m/e = 78),  the  trisilane  hydrino hydride   compound  analogue   Si3H,2 (m I e = 96) with siloxane, Si3H]0O (m/e = 110),  and  the  tetrasilane  hydrino  hydride  compound S/'4H16 (m/e = 128) with siloxane, Si4Hl4O (m/e = 142).   Also, the low mass silane  fragment peaks are  seen:   SiHs (m/e = 36), SiH4 (m/e = 32), and SiH, (m / e = 30).<br>
The  mass  spectrum  (m/e = 0-110) of the vapors from the crystals from the body of a gas cell hydrino hydride reactor comprising a  KI catalyst,  stainless  steel filament leads, and a   W  filament (gas cell sample #4) with a sample heater temperature of 226 Â°C is shown in FIGURE 32. The   parent  peak  assignments   of major  component  hydrino   hydride compounds   followed  by  the  corresponding   mle  of the  fragment peaks appear in TABLE 4.<br>
The 0 to 75 eV binding energy region of a high resolution X-ray Photoelectron   Spectrum   (XPS)  of  recrystallized  crystals  prepared   from the  gas cell  hydrino hydride  reactor comprising  a   KI   catalyst,   stainless steel  filament leads, and a   W   filament (gas cell  sample #4)  corresponding to the mass spectrum shown in FIGURE 32 is shown in FIGURE 33.   The survey  scan  showed  that  the  recrystallized crystals  were  that  of a pure potassium  compound.     Isolation  of pure  hydrino  hydride  compounds from the gas cell is the means of eliminating impurities from the XPS sample  which   concomitantly  eliminates  impurities  as  an  alternative assignment  to  the  hydrino  hydride  ion  peaks.     No  impurities  are present in the survey scan which can be assigned to peaks in the low binding energy region.    With the exception of potassium at  18 and 34 eV, and oxygen at 23 eV, no other peaks in the low binding energy region can be assigned  to  known elements.     Accordingly,  any  other peaks in  this region must  be due  to novel compositions.    The hydrino hydride ion peaks H'(n = 1/p) for p = 3 to p-\6, the potassium peaks,   K, and the oxygen<br>
peak, O, are identified in FIGURE 33. The agreement with the results for the crystals isolated from the electrolytic cells summarized in FIGURE 22 are excellent.<br>

The parent peak assignments of major component   hydrino   hydride   compounds   followed   by   the   corresponding mle of the fragment peaks appear in TABLE 4.    The mass spectrum (m/e = 0-200) of gas cell sample # 5 with a sample temperature of 201  Â°C and with a sample temperature of 235 Â°C is shown in FIGURE 34B and FIGURE 34C, respectively.    The assignments of major component hydrino hydride  silane  and  siloxane  compounds  and  silane  fragments  peaks  are indicated.<br>
.    The  mass  spectrum  (mle = 0-110) of the vapors from the crystals from  a gas discharge cell hydrino hydride reactor comprising a   Kl catalyst and a  Ni  electrodes  with  a sample  heater temperature  of 225  Â°C is shown in FIGURE 35.    The parent peak assignments of major component   hydrino   hydride   compounds   followed   by   the   corresponding mle of the fragment peaks appear in TABLE 4.    No crystal were obtained when   Nal  replaced   A7.<br>
The  mass  spectrum  (mle = 0-110) of the vapors from the  crystals from  a plasma  torch  cell  hydrino  hydride reactor with  a  sample  heater temperature of 250 Â°C is shown in FIGURE 36 with the assignments of major   component   aluminum   hydrino   hydride   compounds   and   fragment peaks.     The  parent  peak assignments  of other common  major component hydrino  hydride  compounds  followed  by  the  corresponding   mle of the fragment peaks appear in TABLE 4.<br>
An exceptional  shoulder was present on  the   m/e = 28 peak due to the   hydrino   hydride   compound   AIH2 (m I e = 29)   with   fragments AIM (mlc = 28) and  A! (m I e = 27).     The  aluminum  hydrino  hydride compound  is also present as the dimer,   M,H4 with series (mle - 58-54). No  hydrino  hydride  compound   peaks  were  observed   when   Nal   replaced<br>
Kl.<br>
The presence of  NaSiO2Hb   is  consistent  with  the  elemental  analysis<br>
by  XPS  which  indicated  that  the  plasma torch  sample  was predominantly SiO2 as shown in TABLE 8.    The source is the quartz of the torch that was etched during operation.    Quartz etching was  also observed during the operation of the gas cell hydrino hydride reactor.<br>
The mass spectrum as a function of time of hydrogen (m/e = 2 and (m/e = 1), water (m/e = 18, m/e = 2, and (m/e = l), carbon dioxide (m/e = 44 and m/e = 12), and hydrocarbon fragment CHj (m/e = 15), and carbon<br>
(m/e = 12)  obtained  following recording the mass  spectra of the  crystals from the electrolytic cell, the gas cell, the gas discharge cell, and the plasma torch cell hydrino hydride reactors is shown in FIGURE 37.    The spectra is that of hydrogen where the intensity of the ion current of m/e = 2 and mle = 1 is higher than that of m/e = 18; even though, no hydrogen was injected into the spectrometer.    The source is not :onsistent with hydrocarbons.    The  source is assigned to increased binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds  given  in   the   Additional   Increased Binding Energy Hydrogen Section.    The ionization energy was increased from   IP = 70eV to IP = 150eV.   The m/e = 2  and m/e = 18  ion  currents increased  while  the   mle = 1   ion current  decreased  indicating  that  a more stable   hydrogen-type   molecular  ion  (dihydrino   molecular   ion)   was formed.     The  dihydrino  molecular ion reacts  with  the  dihydrino  molecule to form  Hl(1/ p] (Eq. (32)).   Hl(1 I p)  serves as a  signature for the presence<br>
of dihydrino  molecules  and  molecular ions  including  those  formed by fragmentation  of  increased  binding  energy  hydrogen   compounds   in  a mass  spectrometer as demonstrated  in FIGURE  26D  (electrolytic  cell with K,COi catalyst), FIGURE 30A (gas cell with KI catalyst), FIGURES 34B and<br>
34C (gas cell with  Rbl catalyst), and FIGURE 35 (gas discharge cell with KI   catalyst).<br>
13.3    Identification of the Dihvdrino Molecule by Mass Spectroscopy<br>
The first ionization energy,  IP, of the dihydrino molecule<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
is 7/1, =62.27 eV (p = 2   in Eq.  (29)); whereas, the first  ionization energy or ordinary   molecular  hydrogen   is   15.46 eV.    Thus, the possibility of using<br>
mass   spectroscopy   to   discriminate from   on the<br>
basis of the  large  difference  between  the ionization  energies  of the two species  was explored.    The dihydrino was identified  by mass spectroscopy as a species with a mass to charge ratio of two (mle-2) that has  a  higher ionization  potential  than that of normal  hydrogen by<br>
recording the ion current as a function of the electron gun energy.<br>
13.3.1     Sample Collection and  Preparation<br>
13.3.1.1	Hollow Cathode Electrolytic Samples<br>
Hydrogen gas was collected in an evacuated hollow nickel cathode of an  aqueous potassium carbonate electrolytic  cell  and an aqueous sodium carbonate electrolytic cell.    Each cathode was sealed at one end and was on-line  to the mass  spectrometer at the other end.<br>
Electrolysis  was  performed  with  either aqueous  sodium  or potassium  carbonate  in  a  350 ml  vacuum jacketed dewar (Pope  Scientific, Inc., Menomonee Falls, WI) with a platinum basket anode and a  170 cm long nickel tubing cathode (Ni 200 tubing, 0.0625 in. O.D., 0.0420 in. I.D., with a nominal wall thickness of 0.010 in., MicroGroup, Inc., Medway, MA).    The cathode was coiled into a 3.0 cm long helix with a 2.0 cm diameter.     One end of the cathode was sealed above  the electrolyte with a 0.0625 in. Swagelock union and plug (Swagelock Co., Solon, OH).    The other end was connected directly to a needle valve on the  sampling port of a Dycor System   1000 Quadrapole Mass Spectrometer (Model D200MP, Ametek,  Inc.,  Pittsburgh,  PA).<br>
13.3.1.2	Control  Hydrogen  Sample<br>
The  control  hydrogen  gas  was  ultrahigh  purity  (MG  Industries).<br>
13.3.1.3	Electrolytic Gasses from Recombiner<br>
During  the  electrolysis  of aqueous  potassium  carbonate,  MIT Lincoln  Laboratories observed long duration excess  power of  1-5  watts with  output/input  ratios  over   10 in  some  cases  with  respect to  the cell input  power reduced by  the  enthalpy  of the generated  gas  [Haldeman,  C. W., Savoye, G. W., Iseler, G. W., Clark, H. R., MIT Lincoln Laboratories Excess Energy Cell Final report ACC Project 174 (3), April 25,  1995].    In these  cases,  the  output  was   1.5  to 4  times  the  integrated  volt-ampere power  input.     Faraday  efficiency  was  measured  volumetrically  by  direct water displacement.     Electrolytic  gases  were  passed  through  a  copper oxide  recombiner and  a  Burrell  absorption  tube  analyzer  multiple  times until  the processed  gas volume remained unchanged.     The processed gases were sent to BlackLight Power Corporation, Malvern, PA and were<br>
analyzed   by   mass   spectroscopy.<br>
13.3.1.4   Gas Cell Sample<br>
Pennsylvania  State  University  Chemical   Engineering   Department determined   the  heat  production  associated  with  hydrino  formation   with a Calvet calorimeter.    The instrument used to measure the heat of reaction  comprised  a  cylindrical  heat  flux  calorimeter  (mternational Thermal  Instrument Co.,  Model CA-100-1).     The cylindrical  calorimeter walls  contained a thermopile  structure composed of two  sets  of thermoelectric junctions.    One set of junctions was in thermal contact with  the  internal  calorimeter wall,  at temperature   7,, and the second set<br>
of thermal junctions  was  in  thermal contact with  the  external  calorimeter wall at Te which is held constant by a forced convection oven.    When heat<br>
was  generated  in  the  calorimeter cell,  the  calorimeter radially transferred  a  constant  fraction  of this  heat  into  the  surrounding  heat sink.     As heat flowed  a temperature gradient,   (7,-7,),   was  established<br>
between  the   two  sets  of thermopile junctions.     This  temperature  gradient generated  a  voltage  which  was  compared  to  the  linear  voltage  versus power calibration  curve  to give the power of reaction.    The calorimeter was calibrated  with  a precision  resistor and  a  fixed current  source  at power levels  representative  of the  power of reaction  of the  catalyst  runs. The calibration  constant of the Calvet calorimeter was  not  sensitive  to the flow of hydrogen over the range of conditions of the tests.    To avoid corrosion, a cylindrical reactor, machined from  304 stainless steel to fit inside the calorimeter, was used to contain the reaction.    To maintain an isothermal   reaction  system  and  improve  baseline  stability,   the calorimeter  was placed  inside a commercial forced convection oven  that was  be  operated  at  250 Â°C.    Also,  the calorimeter and reactor were enclosed  within  a cubic  insulated box, constructed of Durok (United States  Gypsum  Co.)  and  fiberglass,  to  further dampen  thermal  oscillations in  the  oven.     A  more  complete description of the  instrument and  methods are given by Phillips [Bradford, M. C., Phillips, J., Klanchar, Rev. Sci. Instrum.,  66.  (1),  January,  (1995),  pp.   171-175].<br>
The 20 CVH'  Calvet cell contained a heated coiled section of 0.25 mm platinum wire filament approximately  18 cm in length  and 200 mg of A7VO, powder in a quartz boat fitted inside the filament coil that was<br>
heated  by   the   filament.<br>
The  calorimetry  tests yielded exceptional results  [Phillips,  J.,  Smith, J., Kurtz, S., "Report On Calorimetric Investigations Of Gas-Phase Catalyzed Hydrino  Formation"   Final  report for Period  October-December   1996", January  1,  1997].    In three separate trials, between  10 and 20 K Joules were  generated at a rate of 0.5 Watts, upon admission  of approximately 1(T3 moles of hydrogen to the cell.    This is equivalent to the generation of 107 JI mole of hydrogen, as compared to 2.5 X 105 J / mole   of hydrogen anticipated  for standard hydrogen combustion.     Thus,  the  total  heats generated appear to be  100 times too large to be explained by conventional   chemistry,  but   the   results  are  completely   consistent  with the  catalysis  of hydrogen.     Catalysis occurred  when  molecular  hydrogen was, dissociated  by  the  hot  platinum  filament  and  the  atomic  hydrogen contacted  the  gaseous   K+ I A"  catalyst from the  KNO3 powder in  the<br>
quartz  boat  that  was  heated  and  volatilized  by  the  filament.<br>
Following the calorimetry test, the gasses from  the Calvet cell were collected  in  an  evacuated  stainless  steel  sample  bottle  and  shipped  to BlackLight  Power Corporation,  Malvern,  PA  where  they  were  analyzed  by mass   spectroscopy.<br>
13.3.2     Mass Spectroscopy<br>
The  mass  spectroscopy  was  performed  with  a  Dycor  System   1000 Quadrapole Mass Spectrometer Model #D200MP with a HOVAC Dri-2 Turbo 60 Vacuum System.    The ionization energy was  calibrated to within Â±  1   eV.<br>
Mass spectra of gases permeant to a nickel tubing cathode sealed at one  end  and  on-line  to  the  mass  spectrometer  at the  other were  taken for  potassium  carbonate  electrolysis  cells  and   sodium   carbonate electrolysis cells.    The intensity of the  m/e = l and m/e-2   peaks  were recorded  while  varying  the  ionization  potential  (IP)  of the  mass spectrometer.     The  pressure  of the  sample  gas in the  mass  spectrometer was  kept  the  same  for each  experiment  by  adjusting  the  needle  value  of the  mass  spectrometer.    The  entire range  of masses  through   m/e = 200 was measured at IP = 70 eV following the determinations at  m/e = l  and m I e = 2.<br>
13.3.3    Results and Discussion<br>
The results of the mass spectroscopic analysis (m/e = 2) of the potassium  carbonate  run  and  the  sodium  carbonate  run  with  varying ionization potential of gasses from the seal nickel tubing cathode on-line with the mass spectrometer appear in TABLES 5 and 6, respectively.    For the  sodium  carbonate control,  the  signal intensity  is  essentially  constant with IP.    Whereas, in the case of the gasses from the potassium carbonate electrolytic cell, the  m/e = 2   signal increases  significantly  when the ionization energy is increased from 30 eV to 70 eV.    A species with a much   higher   ionization  potential  than   molecular  hydrogen,   somewhere between 30-70 eV, is present.    The higher ionizing mass two species is<br>
assigned  to  the  dihydrino  molecule,  <br>

The  mass  spectrum  (m/e = 0-50) of the gasses from the Ni tubing cathode of the   K2CO3   electrolytic  cell  on-line  with  the  mass  spectrometer<br>
is shown in FIGURE 38.    No peaks were observed outside this range.    As the ionization energy was increased from 30 eV to 70 eV a m/e = 4  peak<br>
was observed.    The  m/e = 4 was not observed in the case that  Na,CO} replaced   K2CO3 or in the case of the mass spectrum of high purity hydrogen gas.    The only known element which gives an  m/e = 4  peak was helium which was not present in the electrolytic cell,  and the cathode was  on-line  to  the  mass  spectrometer which was under high  vacuum. Helium is further excluded by the absence of a  m/e = 5 peak which is always present with helium hydrogen mixtures,  but is  not  observed  in the in FIGURE 38.    From the data, hydrinos are produced in nickel hydride according to Eq. (35).    The dihydrino molecule has a higher diffusion rate in nickel than hydrogen.    Dihydrino gives rise to a  m/e = 4<br>
mass spectroscopic peak.    The reaction follows from Eq. (32).<br>

Hl(1/ p)  serves as a signature for the presence of dihydrino molecules.<br>
The  mass  spectrum  (m/e = 0-50) of the MIT sample comprising nonrecombinable  gas  from  a   K2CO3 electrolytic cell is shown in FIGURE<br>
39.    As the ionization energy was increased from 30 eV to 70 eV a m/e = 4  peak was observed that was assigned to  H(l/p).    The peak<br>
serves  as  a  signature  for the  presence  of dihydrino  molecules.<br>
The  output  power versus  time  during  the  catalysis  of hydrogen  and the response to helium  in a Calvet cell containing a heated platinum filament  and   KN3, powder in a quartz boat that was  heated by the<br>
filament is shown in FIGURE 40.    During the time interval shown 2.2X1057   of energy was produced by hydrogen;  whereas the response  of the calorimeter to helium (shown offset)  was trace positive followed by trace  negative,  and equilibration to null response.    The energy released if all of the hydrogen present in the closed cell under went combustion is equivalent  to  the  area  under  the  power curve  between  two  time increments   (T= 17 mins).    Combustion is the most exothermic  ordinary reaction possible.    The   10"'  moles of hydrogen added to the 20  cm'   Calvet cell   generated   2 X 10s 7 / mole of hydrogen, as compared to  2.5 X 105 JI mole of hydrogen   anticipated  for  standard  hydrogen  combustion.     The  large enthalpy  which  can  not  be  explained  by  conventional  chemistry  is assigned  to  the  catalysis of hydrogen.<br>
The  mass  spectrum (m/e = 0-50) of the gasses from the Pennsylvania State University Calvet cell following the catalysis  of<br>
hydrogen  that  were  collected  in  an  evacuated  stainless  steel   sample bottle is shown in FIGURE 41A.    As the ionization energy was increased from 30 eV to 70 eV a m/e = 4  peak was  observed that was  assigned to Hl(1/p).    The peak serves as a signature for the presence of dihydrino<br>
molecules.    As the pressure was reduced by pumping, the   m/e = 2  peak split as shown in FIGURE 41B.   In this case, the response of the m/e = 2 peak  to ionization potential was significantly increased.     Sample  was introduced,  and the ion current was observed to increased  from   2 X10"'Â° to 1 X 1CT8 as the ionization potential was changed from 30 eV to 70 eV. The split m/e = 2  peak and the significant response of the ion current to ionization  potential   are  further  signatures  for  dihydrino.<br>
The  mass  spectrum  (mle = 0-200) of the gasses from the Pennsylvania State University Calvet cell following the catalysis  of hydrogen  that  were  collected  in  an evacuated  stainless  steel  sample bottle is shown in FIGURE 42.    Several hydrino hydride compounds were identified as indicated in FIGURE 42.    The production of dihydrino and hydrino  hydride   compounds   confirms  the  assignment  of the   enthalphy   to the  catalysis  of  hydrogen.<br>
The mle = 4 peak that was assigned to  H(1/ p)  was also  observed<br>
during  mass  spectroscopic  analysis  of hydrino  hydride  compounds  as given  in the  Identification of Hydrino Hydride Compounds  by  Mass Spectroscopy  Section  and  the  Identification  of Hydrino  Hydride Compounds   by   Time-Of-Flight-Secondary-Ion-Mass-Spectroscopy (TOFSIMS) Section (e.g. FIGURE 62).   The m/e = 4  peak  was  further observed  during   mass   spectroscopy  following   gas  chromatographic analysis of samples comprising dihydrino as given in the  Identification of Hydrino  Hydride  Compounds  and Dihydrino by Gas  Chromatography with Calorimetry of the  Decomposition of Hydrino Hydride Compounds  Section.<br>
13.4     Identification of Hydrino Hydride Compounds and Dihydrino by Gas Chromatography  with  Calorimetry  of the  Decomposition  of Hydrino Hydride   Compounds<br>
Increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds  are  given   in  the Additional  Increased Binding Energy Compounds  Section.     It was observed  that   NiO formed and precipitated out over time from the filtered electrolyte  (Whatman  110 mm filter paper (Cat.  No.   1450  110))<br>
of the  K2CO3  electrolytic cell described in  the Identification  of Hydrinos, Dihydrinos,  and Hydrino Hydride Ions by  XPS  (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) Section.    The XPS contains nickel as shown in FIGURE 18, and the crystals isolated from the electrolyte of the   K2CO3  electrolytic cell contained compounds such as   NiHn (where n is an integer) as given in the<br>
Identification  of Hydrino  Hydride  Compounds  by  Time-Of-Flight-Secondary-Ion-Mass-Spectroscopy (TOFSIMS) Section.     Since   Ni(OH)2 and MCO3 are extremely insoluble in a solution with a measured pH of 9.85,<br>
the source of the  NiO from a soluble nickel compound is likely the decomposition of compounds  such as   NiHn to MO.    This was tested by adding  an equal  atomic  percent   LiNO3   and acidifying  the  electrolyte  with HNO) to form potassium nitrate.    The solution was dried and heated to a<br>
mek at  120 Â°C whereby  MO formed.    The solidified melt was dissolved in H-,0, and the MO was removed by filtration.    The solution was concentrated until  crystals just appeared at 50 Â°C.    White  crystals formed from  the  solution  standing  at room temperature.     The  crystals  were obtained  by  filtration.     The  crystals  were  recrystallized  with  distilled water,  and  mass  spectroscopy  was  performed by  the  method  given  in  the Identification  of  Hydrino  Hydride  Compounds  by  Mass  Spectroscopy Section.    The mass ranges  m/e = lto220 and m/e = ltol20  were  scanned. The  mass  spectrum  was equivalent to that of the  crystals  from  the electrolyte  of the   K2CO3 electrolytic cell that was made  1  M in  L/WO,  and acidified  with   HNO,  (mass  spectroscopy electrolytic  cell  sample  #3  shown in FIGURE 24 with parent peak identifications shown in TABLE 4) except that  the  following  new  hydrino  hydride  compound  peaks  were  present: Si3H[0O (m I e = 110), Si2H, (m I e = 64), SiHa (mle = 36), and SiH2 (mle = 30).    In<br>
addition, X-ray diffraction of these crystals showed peaks  that could not be assigned  to known compounds as given in  the  Identification of Hydrino Hydride Compounds by XRD Section (XRD sample #4).   TOFSIMS was also performed.    The results where similar to those of TOFSIMS sample #6 shown in TABLES 20 and 21.<br>
Aluminum  analogues  of  NiH,,n = integer are  produced  in  the  plasma<br>
torch as shown in FIGURE 36.    These are expected to decomposed under appropriate   conditions,   and   hydrogen  may  be  released  from   these hydrogen  containing  hydrino  hydride  compounds.     The  ortho  and para forms  of molecular hydrogen can readily be separated by chromatography   at   low   temperatures   which  with   its  characteristic<br>
retention  time  is  a definitive  means of identifying  the  presence  of hydrogen in  a sample.     The possibility of releasing dihydrino  molecules by   thermally   decomposing   hydrino   hydride   compounds   with identification   by   gas   chromatography  was  explored.<br>
Dihydrino molecules may be synthesized according to Eq.  (37) by the reaction of a proton with a hydrino atom.    A gas discharge cell hydrino hydride reactor  is  a  source  of ionized  hydrogen  atoms  (protons) and a source of hydrino atoms.    The catalysis of hydrogen atoms occurs in the gas phase  with a catalyst that is volatilized from the electrodes by the  hot plasma current.     Gas phase hydrogen atoms  are  also generated with  the discharge.    Thus, the possibility of synthesizing dihydrino in a gas  discharge  cell  with  identification by  gas  chromatography  was expJored.<br>
Increased   binding   energy   hydrogen   has   an   internuclear   distance<br>
which is fractional    ( - ) compared with that of normal hydrosen.    The<br>
ortho  and  para  forms  of molecular  hydrogen  can  readily  be  separated  by chromatography  at  low  temperatures.     The  possibility  of using  gas chromatography   at   cryogenic   temperatures   to   discriminate   ortho   and<br>
respectively,  as well para    from ortho and para  <br>
as other dihydrino molecules on the basis of the difference in  sizes of hydrogen   versus   dihydrino   was   explored.<br>
13.4.1     Gas  Chromatography  Methods<br>
Gas  samples were analyzed with a Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II gas  chromatograph  equipped  with  a  thermal  conductivity  detector  and  a 60 meter, 0.32 mm ID fused silica Rt-Alumina PLOT column (Restek, Bellefonte,  PA).    The column was conditioned at 200Â° C for  18-72 hours before each series of runs.    Samples were run at -196Â° C using Ne as the carrier gas.    The 60 meter column was run with the carrier gas at 3.4 psi with  the following flow  rates: carrier - 2.0 ml/min.,  auxiliary -  3.4 ml/min., and reference - 3.5 ml/min., for a total flow  rate of 8.9 ml/min. The  split rate  was   10.0 ml/min.<br>
13.4.1.1     Control Sample<br>
The  control  hydrogen  gas  was ultrahigh purity  (MG  Industries).<br>
13.4.1.2	Plasma Torch Sample<br>
Hydrino  hydride  compounds  were  generated  in   the  plasma  torch hydrino hydride  reactor  with  a   Kl  catalyst by  the  method  described  in the Plasma Torch Sample Section.    A 10 mg sample was placed in a 4 mm ID by 25 mm long quartz tube that was sealed at one end and connected at the open end with Swagelockâ„¢ fittings to a T that was connected to a Welch Duo Seal model  1402 mechanical vacuum pump and a septum port.    The apparatus was evacuated to between 25  and 50 millitorr. Hydrogen   was   generated   by   thermally   decomposing   hydrino   hydride compounds.     The  heating  was  performed  in  the  evacuated  quartz chamber containing  the  sample  with  an  external  Nichrome  wire  heater. The  sample  was  heated  in   100  Â°C  increments  by  varying  the  transformer voltage of the Nichrome heater.    Gas released from the sample  was collected with a 500 Âµl  gas tight syringe  through the  septum port and immediately   injected   into   the   gas   chromatograph.<br>
13.4.1.3	Coated Cathode Sample<br>
Dihydrino  molecules  were  generated  in  an  evacuated  chamber  via thermally decomposing  hydrino hydride  compounds.     The  source  of hydrino hydride  compounds  was  the coating from a  0.5  mm  diameter nickel wire from the  K2CO3 electrolytic cell that produced  6.3 X 108 / of<br>
enthalpy  of formation  of increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds (BLP Electrolytic Cell).    The wire was dried and heated to about 800 Â°C. The  heating  was  performed in  an evacuated quartz chamber by  passing a current  through  the  cathode.     Samples  were  taken  and  analyzed  by  gas chromatography.<br>
A 60 meter long  nickel wire cathode from a potassium carbonate electrolytic cell was coiled around a 7 mm OD, 30 cm long hollow quartz tube and inserted into a 40 cm long, 12 mm OD quartz tube.    The larger quartz tube was sealed at both ends with Swagelockâ„¢ fittings and connected to a Welch Duo Seal model  1402 mechanical vacuum pump with a stainless steel Nuproâ„¢ "H" series bellows valve.    A thermocouple<br>
vacuum  gauge  tube  and  rubber  septum  were  installed  on  the  apparatus side of the pump.    The nickel wire cathode was connected to leads through the Swagelockâ„¢ fittings to a 220V AC transformer.    The apparatus  containing  the  nickel  wire  was  evacuated  to  between  25  and 50 millitorr.    The wire was heated to a range of temperatures by varying the transformer voltage.     Gas released from the heated wire was collected with a 500 /  gas tight syringe through the installed  septum port and immediately  injected into the gas chromatograph.     White crystals  of increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds  which  did  not  thermally decompose  were  cryopumped  to the cool ends  of the evacuated  tube. This  represents  a method  of the present invention  to purify  these compounds.<br>
The mass spectrum (m/e = 0-50) of the gasses from the heated nickel wire cathode was obtained following the recording of the  gas chromatograph.<br>
13.4.1.4    Gas Discharge Cell Sample<br>
The  hydrogen catalysis  to form hydrino occurred in the  gas phase with  the  catalyst   Kl  that was volatilized from the electrodes by  the hot plasma current.     Gas phase  hydrogen  atoms  were generated  with  the discharge.     Dihydrino molecules were synthesized using  the  gas  discharge cell described in the Gas Discharge Cell Sample Section by: (1) putting the catalyst solution inside the lamp and drying it to form a coating on the electrodes;  (2)  vacuuming  the system at  10-30  mtorr for several  hours to remove  contaminant gases  and residual  solvent;  (3)  filling  the  discharge tube with a few torr hydrogen and carrying out an arc discharge for at least 0.5  hour.     The chromatographic column was  submerged  in  liquid nitrogen  and  connected  to  the  thermal  conductivity  detector of the  gas chromatograph.    The gases flowed through a  100%   CuO   recombiner  and were  analyzed  by  the  on-line  gas  chromatography  using  a  three  way valve.<br>
The  mass  spectrum  (m/e = 0-50) of the gasses from the  Kl discharge  tube  on-line   with   the  mass   spectrometer  was  obtained following the recording of the gas  chromatograph.<br>
13.4.2     Adiabatic Calorimetry  Methods<br>
The  enthalpy  of the decomposition  reaction of the  coated  cathode sample  was   measured  with  an  adiabatic   calorimeter  comprising   the decomposition  apparatus  described   above   that  was   suspended   in   an insulated  vessel  containing   12  liters  of distilled water.     The  temperature rise  of the  water was used to determine  the enthalpy  of the decomposition reaction.    The water was  stabilized for one hour at room temperature  before  each  experiment.     Continuous  paddle  stirring  was  set at  a  predetermined  rpm  to  eliminate  temperature  gradients  in  the  water without input of measurable energy.    The temperature  of the  water was measured  by  two  type  K thermocouples.     The  cold junction  temperature was utilized to monitor room temperature changes.     Data points  were taken every  tenth  of a second,  averaged every  ten seconds,  and  recorded with  a computer DAS.    The experiment was run with a wire temperature of 800  Â°C  determined  by  a  resistance  measurement  that was  confirmed by optical  pyrometry.     For the control cases, 600 watts of electrical input power  was   typically   necessary  to  maintain  the  wire   at  this   temperature. The  input  power to  the  filament was recorded  over time with  a Clarke Hess  volt-amp-watt meter with  analog output to the  computer DAS.    The power  balance  for  the  calorimeter  was:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where   Pmpul   was  the  input power measured  by  the watt meter,   m  was the mass of the water (12,000 g),   Cf  is the specific heat of water (4.184 J/g Â°C), dT I dt  was the rate of change in water temperature,   Ptoss was the power loss  of the  water reservoir to the  surroundings  (deviation  from adiabatic)  which  was  measured  to  be  negligible  over the  temperature range of the tests, and  PD was the power released from the hydrino hydride   compound   decomposition   reaction.<br>
The   rise   in   temperature   was   plotted   versus  the   total   input enthalpy.     Using   12.000 grams  as  the  mass  of the  water and  using  the specific  heat of water of 4.184 J/g Â°C, the theoretical  slope was  0.020 Â°C/kJ.    The  experiment  involved an  unrinsed 60 meter long  nickel wire cathode  from  the   K2CO3,  electrolytic cell  that produced  6.3 X108/ of<br>
enthalpy   of  formation   of  increased  binding  energy   hydrogen   compounds (BLP Electrolytic Cell).    Controls comprised hydrogen gas hydrided nickel wire (NI 200 0.0197", HTN36NOAG1, Al Wire Tech, Inc.), and cathode wires from an identical  Na2CO3 electrolytic cell.<br>

13.4.3.1      Enthalpy  Measurement  Results<br>
The results  of the measurement of the enthalpy  of the decomposition   reaction   of  hydrino   hydride   compounds   measured   with the adiabatic calorimeter are shown in FIGURE 43 and TABLE 7.    The wires from the   Na2CO3 electrolytic cell and the hydrided virgin nickel<br>
wires   produced   slopes   of water  temperature  rise  versus  integrated  input enthalpy that were identical to the theoretical slope (0.020  Â°C/kJ).     Each wine  cathode from  the  K2CO3  cell  produced a result  that deviated<br>
substantially  from  the  theoretical  slope,  and much  less input  power was necessary to maintain the wire at 800 Â°C as shown in TABLE 7.    The results   indicate   that  the  decomposition  reaction  of  hydrino   hydride compounds  is  very  exothermic.     In  the best case,  the enthalpy  was 1 M/(25Â°CX 12,000 gX 4.184 J/gÂ°C- 250 kJ)  released  over  30  minutes (25Â°CX 12.000 gX 4.184 J / gDC / 693 W).<br>

13.4.3.2     Gas  Chromatography  Results<br>
The  gas  chromatograph  of the normal  hydrogen  gave  the  retention<br>
time  for para hydrogen  and ortho  hydrogen  as   12.5   minutes  and   13.5 minutes, respectively.     For the plasma torch sample collected from the hydrino   hydride   compound  trap   (filter  paper),   the   gas   chromatographic analysis of gasses released by heating in  100 Â°C increments in the temperature range  100 Â°C to 900 Â°C showed no hydrogen release at any temperature.     For the  plasma torch sample collected  from  the  torch manifold,  the  gas  chromatographic  analysis  of gasses  released by  heating in  100 Â°C increments in the temperature range  100 Â°C to 900 Â°C showed hydrogen release at 400 Â°C and 500 Â°C.    The gas chromatograph of the gases  released  from  the  sample collected from  the plasma  torch  manifold when the sample was heated to 400 Â°C is shown in FIGURE 44.    The elemental  analysis  of the  plasma torch samples  were  determined by  EDS and- XPS.    The concentration of elements detected by XPS in atomic percent is shown in TABLE 8.<br>
TABLE 8.    Concentration of Elements Detected by XPS (m Atomic %).<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The XPS of the sample collected from the torch manifold was remarkable  in that the  potassium to iodide ratio was five;  whereas,  the ratio was  1.2 for  Kl  and  1.2 for sample collected from the hydrino hydride compound trap (filter paper).    The EDS and XPS of the sample collected  from  the  torch  manifold  indicated  an  elemental  composition  of predominantly    SiO, and  Kl  with  small amounts of aluminum,  silicon, sodium,  and  magnesium.     The  mass  spectrum  of the   sample  collected from  the  torch  manifold  is  shown  in  FIGURE  36 which demonstrates hydrino   hydride   compounds   consistent  with   the   elemental   composition. None  of the  elements  identified  are  known  to  store  and  release  hydrogen in  the  temperature  range  of 400-500 Â°C.    These data indicate  that the crystals  from  the  plasma  torch  contain  hydrogen  and  are  fundamentally different  from  previously  known  compounds.     These  results  without convention  explanation  correspond  to  and  identify   increased  binding<br>
energy  hydrogen   compounds   according  to  the  present  invention.<br>
The  gas  chromatographic  analysis  (60 meter column)  of high  purity hydrogen is shown in FIGURE 45.    The results of the gas chromatographic analysis of the heated nickel wire cathode appear in FIGURE 46.    The results indicate  that a new  form of hydrogen molecule  was detected based on  the presence  of peaks with migration  times  comparable  but distinctly different from those of the normal hydrogen peaks.    The mass spectrum   (m/e = 0-50) of the gasses from the heated nickel wire cathode was obtained following the recording of the gas chromatograph.    As the ionization energy was increased from 30 eV to 70 eV a  m/e = 4  peak was observed that was equivalent to that shown in FIGURE 41 A.    Helium was not observed in the gas chromatograph.    The  m/e = 4  peak  was  assigned to H4+(1/ p).   The reaction follows from Eq. (32).    H(1/ p)  serves as a<br>
signature  for  the   presence  of dihydrino  molecules.<br>
FIGURE 47 shows peaks assigned to  , and<br>
 The results  indicate that new forms of hydrogen molecules<br>
were  detected  based  on  the  presence of peaks  that did  not  react  with  the recombiner  with  migration  times  distinctly  different  from  those  of the normal hydrogen peaks.    Control hydrogen run  (FIGURE 45)  before and after the result shown in FIGURE 47 showed no peaks due to recombination  by  the   100%   CnO  recombiner.     The  mass  spectrum (m/e = 0-50) of the gasses from the Kl  discharge tube on-line with the mass  spectrometer was  obtained following the recording  of the gas chromatograph.    As the ionization energy was increased from 30 eV to 70 eV a m/e = 4   peak was observed that was equivalent to  that  shown  in FIGURE 41 A.    The reaction follows from Eq. (32).    H4+(1/p)  serves as a<br>
signature  for  the  presence  of dihydrino  molecules.     As  the  pressure  was reduced  by  pumping,  the   m/c = 2  peak split equivalent to  that shown  in FIGURE 4IB.    In this case, the response of the mle = 2  peak  to ionization potential  was  significantly  increased.     The  split   mle = 2  peak  and  the significant  response  of the  ion  current  to  ionization  potential  are  further signatures   for   dihydrino.<br>
13.4.4    Discussion  The results of the calorimetry of the decomposition reaction of increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds  can  not  be  explained  by conventional  chemistry.     In  addition to  novel  reactivity,  other  tests confirm  increased  binding energy  hydrogen  compounds.     The  cathode  of the  K2CO3  BLP Electrolytic Cell described in the Crystal Samples from an<br>
Electrolytic  Cell Section was removed from the cell without rinsing and stored in a plastic bag for one year.    White-green crystals were  collected physically from the nickel wire.    Elemental analysis, XPS, mass spectroscopy, and XRD were performed.    The elemental analysis is discussed in the  Identification of Hydrino Hydride Compounds by  Mass Spectroscopy  Section.     The  results  were consistent with  the  reaction given by Eqs. (55-57).    The XPS results indicated the presence of hydrino hydride ions.    The mass spectrum was similar to that of mass spectroscopy electrolytic cell sample #3 shown in FIGURE 24.    Hydrino hydride  compounds  were  observed.     Peaks  were  observed   in  the  X-ray diffraction  pattern  which  could  not be  assigned  to  any  known  compound as shown in the Identification of Hydrino Hydride Compounds by XRD (X-ray Diffraction Spectroscopy) Section (XRD sample #1A).    Heat that could not   be  explained  by   conventional   chemistry  and  dihydrino  were observed   by   thermal   decomposition   with  calorimetry   and   gas chromatography   studies,   respectively,   as   shown   herein.<br>
In addition, the material on the cathode of the   KCO,   Thermacore<br>
Electrolytic Cell also showed novel thermal decomposition chemistry as well as new spectroscopic features such' as novel Raman peaks (Raman sample #1). Samples from the K2CO3 electrolyte such as that from the<br>
Thermacore Electrolytic Cell showed novel features over a broad range of spectroscopic characterizations (XPS (XPS sample #6), XRD (XRD sample #2), TOFSIMS (TOFSIMS sample #1), FTIR (FTIR sample #1), NMR (NMR sample #1). and ESITOFMS (ESITOFMS sample #2).    Novel reactivity was observed   of the  electrolyte   sample  treated  with   HNO,,.    The yellow-white<br>
crystals  that  formed on  the  outer edge of a crystallization  dish  from  the acidified electrolyte  of the   K2CO3,  Thermacore  Electrolytic  Cell  reacted<br>
with   sulfur  dioxide  to  form   sulfide  compounds  including   magnesium sulfide.    The reaction was identified by XPS.    This sample also showed novel  features  over  a  broad  range  of spectroscopic   characterizations (mass  spectroscopy  (mass  spectroscopy electrolytic  cell  samples  #5  and #6), XRD (XRD samples #3A and #3B), TOFSIMS (TOFSIMS sample #3),<br>
and FTIR (FTIR sample #4)).<br>
The results from XPS, TOFSIMS, and mass spectroscopy studies identify that crystals from the BLP and Thermacore  cathodes  as  well  as crystal from the electrolytes  may react with sulfur dioxide  in air to form sulfides.    The reaction may be silane oxidation to form a corresponding hydrino hydride  siloxane with sulfur dioxide reduction to  sulfide.     Two silicon-silicon bridging  hydrogen  species  of the  silane  may  be  replaced with an oxygen atom.    A similar reaction occurs with ordinary silanes  [F. A. Cotton, G. Wilkinson, Advanced  Inorsanic  Chemistry. Fourth Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, pp. 385-386.J.<br>
As a further example of novel reactivity,  the nickel  wire from the cathode of the Thermacore Electrolytic Cell was reacted with a 0.6 M K2CO3/3%  H-.O-,  solution.    The reaction was violent and strongly<br>
exothermic.     These  results  without  convention  explanation   correspond   to and   identify   increased   binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds   according   to the present  invention.    The  latter result also confirms  the  application  of increased  binding  energy  hydrogen  compounds  as  solid  fuels.<br>
13.5    Identification of Hvdrino Hydride Compounds bv XRD (X-ray Diffraction. Soectroscoov)<br>
XRD  measures the scattering of X-rays by crystal atoms, producing a  diffraction  pattern  that  yields  information  about  the  structure  of the crystal.     Known  compounds  can be identified  by their characteristic diffraction pattern.    XRD was used to identify the composition of an ionic hydrogen  spillover  catalytic  material:   40%  by   weight  potassium   nitrate (KNO3) on  Grafoil with 5% by weight  1%-Pt-on-graphitic carbon before<br>
and  after hydrogen  was  supplied  to the catalyst,  as  described  at pages 57-62   of  PCT/US96/07949.     Calorimetry  was  performed  when  hydrogen was  supplied  to test for catalysis as evidenced by the enthalpy  balance. The new product of the reaction was studied using XRD.    XRD was also obtained  on  crystals  grown  on  the  stored cathode  and  isolated  from  the electrolyte  of the   K2CO3  electrolytic cell described in  the Crystal  Samples<br>
from an Electrolytic Cell Section.<br>
13.5.1     Experimental  Methods<br>
13.5.1.1     Spillover Catalyst Sample<br>
Catalysis  was  confirmed  by  calorimetry.     The  enthalpy  released  by catalysis  (heat  of formation)  was  determined  from  flowing  hydrogen  in the  presence  of ionic  hydrogen  spillover catalytic material:  40%  by weight   potassium   nitrate   (KNO3) on Grafoil with 5% by weight 1%-Pt-on-graphitic  carbon  by  heat  measurement,  i.e.,  thermopile  conversion  of heat into an electrical  output signal or Calvet calorimetry.     Steady  state enthalpy of reaction of greater than  1.5 W was observed with flowing hydrogen  over 20 cc  of catalyst.     However,  no enthalpy  was observed with   flowing  helium  over the  catalyst  mixture.     Enthalpy  rates  were reproducibly   observed   which   were   higher   than   that   expected   from reacting  of all  the  hydrogen entering  the  cell  to water,  and  the  total energy   balance   observed   was  over   8   times   greater  than   that  expected   if all  the  catalytic  material  in  the  cell  were converted  to  the  lowest  energy state  by  "known"  chemical reactions.    Following the run,  the catalytic material was removed from the cell and was exposed to air.    XRD was performed  before  and  after  the  run.<br>
13.2.1.2    Electrolytic Cell Samples<br>
Hydrino   hydride   compounds   were   prepared   during   the   electrolysis of an aqueous solution of K2CO3   corresponding  to  the  transition   catalyst<br>
K+/K+.    The cell description is given in the Crystal Samples from an Electrolytic Cell Section.   The cell assembly is shown in FIGURE 2.   The crystals  were  obtained  from  the cathode  or from  the  electrolyte:<br>
Sample #1A.    The cathode of the  K2CO3 BLP Electrolytic Cell was removed from the cell without rinsing and stored in a plastic bag for one year.     White-green crystals were collected physically  from  the  nickel wire.    Elemental analysis, XPS, mass spectroscopy, and XRD were performed.<br>
Sample #1B.   The cathode of a K2CO3  electrolytic cell run at Idaho<br>
National  Engineering Laboratories (mEL)  for 6 months  that was  identical to that of Sample #1A was placed in 28 liters of 0.6M  K2CO3,/10%   H2O2.  A<br>
violent  exothermic  reaction  occurred  which caused  the  solution  to  boil  for over one hour.    An aliquot of the  solution was concentrated ten fold with a rotary evaporator at 50 Â°C.    A precipitate formed on standing  at room temperature.     The  crystals were  filtered,  and XRD was  performed.<br>
Samples #2.    The  sample  was prepared by concentrating  the   K2CO3 electrolyte   from  the  Thermacore   Electrolytic  Cell  until  yellow-white crystals just formed.     Elemental  analysis,  XPS,  mass  spectroscopy, TOFSIMS, FTIR, NMR, and XRD were performed as described in the corresponding   sections.<br>
Sample #3A and #3B.     Each  sample was prepared from the crystals of sample #2 by   1.) acidifying the   K2CO3   electrolyte  of the  Thermacore Electrolytic Cell with   UNO.,, 2.) concentrating the acidified solution to a volume of  10 cc,  3.)  placing the concentrated solution on a crystallization dish,  and  4.)  allowing  crystals  to  form  slowly  upon  standing  at  room temperature.     Yellow-white  crystals  formed  on  the  outer edge  of the crystallization dish  (the yellow  color may  be due to  the continuum absorption  of  H-(n = 1/2) in the near UV, 407 nm  continuum).    These crystals comprised Sample #3A.    Clear needles formed in the center.    These crystals comprised  Sample #3B.    The crystals  were  separated carefully, but<br>
some  contamination  of Sample #3B  with  Sample  #3A  crystals  probably occurred to a minor extent.    XPS (XPS sample #10), mass spectra (mass spectroscopy electrolytic cell  samples #5  and #6), TOFSIMS  spectra (TOFSIMS samples #3A and #3B), and FTIR spectrum (FTIR sample #4) were   also  obtained.<br>
Sample #4.    The K2CO3 BLP Electrolytic Cell was made 1 M in LiNO3 and acidified with   HNO.    The solution was dried and heated to a melt at 120 Â°C whereby   MO formed.    The solidified melt was dissolved in  H,O, and the   MO was  removed  by filtration.     The solution was  concentrated until  crystals just appeared at 50 Â°C.    White crystals formed from the solution  standing  at room  temperature.     The crystals  were  obtained  by filtration,  and  further purified  from   KNO3  by  recrystallizing  with  distilled<br>
water.<br>
13.5.1.3    Gas Cell Sample.<br>
Sample #5.     Hydrino  hydride  compounds  were  prepared  in  a  vapor phase gas cell with a tungsten filament and   KI as the catalyst.    The high temperature gas cell shown in FIGURE 4 was used to produce hydrino hydride   compounds   wherein   hydrino  atoms  are  formed   from   the catalysis  of hydrogen  using  potassium  ions  and  hydrogen  atoms  in  the gas phase as described for the Gas Cell Sample of the Identification of Hydrino Hydride Compounds by Mass Spectroscopy Section.    The sample was  prepared  by   1.)  rinsing  the  hydrino  hydride  compounds  from  the cap of the  cell  where  it was preferentially cryopumped with  sufficient water that all  water soluble  compounds dissolved,  2.)  filtering  the solution to  remove  water insoluble compounds  such  as  metal,  3.) concentrating  the   solution  until  a  precipitate just  formed  with   the solution  at  50  Â°C.  4.)  allowing  yellowish-reddish-brown  crystals  to  form on  standing  at  room  temperature,  4.)  filtering  and  drying  the  crystals before  XPS,  mass  spectra,  and  XRD were obtained.<br>
13.5.2    Results and Discussion<br>
The XRD patterns of the spillover catalyst samples were obtained at Pennsylvania State University.    The XRD pattern before supplying hydrogen to the spillover catalyst is shown in FIGURE 48.    All the peaks<br>
are identifiable  and correspond to the starting catalyst material.    The XRD pattern following the catalysis of hydrogen is shown in FIGURE 49.    The identified  peaks  correspond  to  the  known  reaction  products   of potassium metal with oxygen as well as the known peaks of carbon.    In addition, a novel,  unidentified  peak  was  reproducibly  observed.     The   novel  peak without  identifying  assignment  at   13Â° 20   corresponds  and   identifies potassium  hydrino  hydride,  and  according  to  the  present  invention.<br>
The XRD pattern of the crystals from the stored nickel cathode of the   K2CO3   electrolytic  cell  hydrino  hydride reactor (sample  #1A)  was<br>
obtained at 1C Laboratories and is shown in FIGURE 50.    The identifiable peaks  corresponded  to   KHCO,.    In addition, the spectrum contained a<br>
number of peaks that did not match the pattern of any of the 50,000 knewn compounds in the data base.    The 2-theta and d-spacings  of the unidentified XRD peaks of the crystals from the cathode of the  K2CO3<br>
electrolytic cell hydrino hydride reactor are given in TABLE 9.    The novel peaks  without  identifying  assignment given in TABLE  9  corresponds  and identifies   hydrino   hydride   compounds,   according   to   the   present invention.<br>
In  addition,  the elemental  analysis  of the crystals  was  obtained  at Galbraith  Laboratories.     It  was  consistent with  the  sample  comprising KHCO3,, but the atomic hydrogen percentage was 30% in excess.    The mass<br>
spectrum  was  similar to  that  of mass  spectroscopy electrolytic  cell sample #3    shown in FIGURE 24.    The XPS contained hydrino hydride ion peaks   H-(n-1/ p) for p = 2 to p = l6   that  were  partially  masked  by  the dominant  spectrum  of   KHCO.    These results are consistent with the production  of  KHCO3,  and  hydrino hydride  compounds  from   K2CO3  by the formation of hydrinos by the   K2CO3   electrolytic  cell  hydrino  hydride reactor and  the  reaction  of hydrinos  with  water (Eqs.  (55-57).<br>

For sample  #1B,  the XRD pattern  corresponded  to  identifiable peaks of KHCO3,.     In  addition,  the  spectrum contained unidentified peaks  at 2-<br>

The XRD pattern of the crystals prepared by concentrating  the electrolyte  from  the   K2CO3}  Thermacore Electrolytic Cell until  a precipitate<br>
just formed (sample #2) was obtained at 1C Laboratories and is  shown in FIGURE 51.    The identifiable peaks corresponded to a mixture of K4H2(CO,), -\.5H-,O and K2CO3,-1.5H20.    In addition, the  spectrum contained a<br>
number of peaks  that did not match the pattern of any of the  50,000 known compounds  in the data base.    The 2-theta and d-spacings  of the unidentified XRD peaks of the crystals from the cathode of the   K2CO3<br>
electrolytic cell hydrino hydride reactor are given in TABLE  11.    The novel  peaks  without identifying  assignment given  in  TABLE   11 correspond  to  and  identify  hydrino  hydride  compounds,   according  to  the present   invention.<br>
In addition, the elemental analysis of the crystals was obtained at Galbraith Laboratories. It was consistent with the sample comprising a mixture of K,H2(CO]\.5H2O and K2CO3-l.5H2O, but the atomic hydrogen<br>

For sample  #3A,  the  XRD pattern  corresponded  to  identifiable peaks of KNO3,.     In  addition,   the  spectrum  contained  unidentified  peaks  at<br>
2-theia values and d-spacings given in TABLE  12.    The novel peaks of TABLE   12  without  identifying  assignment correspond  to  and  identify hydrino  hydride  compounds,  according  to  the  present  invention.

For sample #3B,  the XRD pattern  corresponded  to  identifiable peaks of KNO3     In  addition,  the  spectrum  contained  very  small  unidentified<br>
peaks  at  2-theta  values of 20.2  and  22.0 which  were  attributed  to  minor contamination with crystals of sample #3A.    In addition to the peaks of KNO3 the XPS spectra of samples #3A and #3B contained the same peaks<br>
as those assigned to hydrino hydride ions in FIGURE  19.    However, their intensity was significantly greater in the case of the XPS  spectrum of sample #3A as compared to the spectrum of sample #3B.<br>
For sample #4, the XRD pattern corresponded to identifiable peaks of KNO3     In addition,  the spectrum contained unidentified peaks  at a 2-<br>
theta value of 40.3 and d-spacing of 2.237 and at a 2-theta value of 62.5 and  d-spacing of   1.485.     The  novel  peaks  without  identifying  assignment correspond  to  and  identify  hydrino  hydride  compounds,   according  to  the present   invention.     The   assignment   of  hydrino   hydride   compounds   was confirmed  by  the  XPS.     The  spectrum  obtained  of these  crystals  had  the same hydrino hydride ions XPS peaks as that shown in FIGURE  19.    Also, mass   spectroscopy   was  performed   by  the  method  given   in   the Identification  of  Hydrino  Hydride  Compounds  by  Mass  Spectroscopy Section.    The mass ranges m/e = lto220 and m/e = lto!20  were  scanned. The mass  spectrum was equivalent to that to that of mass spectroscopy<br>
electrolytic cell sample #3 shown in FIGURE 2 with parent peak identifications shown in TABLE 4 except that the following new  hydrino hydride  compound  peaks  were  present:   5z'3H10O (m/e = 110), Si2H8 (m/e = 64), SiHs (m/e = 36), and SiH2 (m/e = 30).<br>
For sample #5, the XRD spectrum contained a broad peak with a maximum at a 2-theta value of 21.291  and d-spacing  of 4.1699 and one sharp  intense peak at a 2-theta value of 29.479 and  d-spacing of 3.0277. The  novel  peaks   without  identifying  assignment  correspond  to  and identify  hydrino   hydride  compounds,  according   to   the  present  invention. The  assignment of compounds  containing  hydrino hydride  ions  was confirmed by XPS.    The origin of the yellowish-reddish-brown color of the crystals is assigned to the continuum absorption of  H-(n = l/2) in the near UV, 407 nm  continuum.    This assignment is supported by the XPS results which showed a large peak at the binding energy of H'(;; = 1/2), 3 eV (TABLE  1).    Also, mass spectroscopy was performed as given in the Identification  of Hydrino  Hydride  Compounds  by  Mass  Spectroscopy Section.    Mass spectra appear in FIGURES 28A-28B and 29, and the peak assignments are given in TABLE 4.    Hydrino hydride compounds were observed.<br>

The  catalysis  of hydrogen  was  detected  by  the  extreme  ultraviolet (EUV) emission (912 A)  from  transitions of hydrogen  atoms  to  form hydrino.    The principle reactions of interest are given by Eqs. (3-5).    The corresponding  extreme  UV  photon  is:<br>

The  hydrino hydride compounds  with transitions  in  the regions  of the hydrino hydride ion binding energies given in TABLE  1  and the corresponding continua were  also detected by EUV  spectroscopy.     The reactions occurred in a gas discharge cell shown in FIGURE 52.    Due to the extremely   short   wavelength   of  the  radiation   to  be   detected,   "transparent" optics  do   not  exist.     Therefore,  a  windowless  arrangement  was   used wherein  the  sample  or  source  of the  studied  species  was  connected  to  the same  vacuum  vessel  as  the  grating  and detectors  of the UV  spectrometer. Windowless  EUV   spectroscopy  was  performed  with   an  extreme ultraviolet  spectrometer  that  was  mated  with  the  cell  by  a  differentially pumped connecting section that had a pin hole light inlet and outlet.    The cell  was  operated under hydrogen flow  conditions while maintaining  a<br>
constant hydrogen  pressure  with  a  mass  flow  controller.     The  apparatus used  to study the extreme UV spectra of the gaseous reactions is  shown in FIGURE 52.    It contains four major components: gas discharge cell 907, UV  spectrometer  991,  mass  spectrometer 994,  and  connector  976  which was   differentially   pumped.<br>
13.6.1     Experimental  Methods<br>
The schematic of the gas discharge cell light source,  the extreme ultraviolet  (EUV)  spectrometer for windowless  EUV  spectroscopy,  and  the mass   spectrometer  used  to  observe  hydrino,  hydrino  hydride   ion, increased   binding  energy  hydrogen  compound,   and   dihydrino   molecular ion- formations and transitions is shown in FIGURE 52.    The elements of the segment of the apparatus of FIGURE 52 marked "A", correspond in structure   and   function   to  the   like-numbered  500-series  elements   of FIGURE 6.    The construction of the FIGURE 6 device is described in the Gas Discharge Cell Section, above.    The apparatus of FIGURE 52 contained the   following   modifications.<br>
The  apparatus of FIGURE 52  further contained  a hydrogen  mass flow  controller 934 which  maintained  the hydrogen  pressure  in  cell  907 with differential pumping at 2 torr.    The gas discharge cell 907 of FIGURE 52  further  comprised  a catalyst reservoir 971   for   KNO3, or Kl   catalyst<br>
that  was  vaporized  from  the  catalyst  reservoir  by  heating  with  the catalyst  heater  972  using  heater power  supply  973.<br>
The  apparatus of FIGURE 52 further included  a mass spectrometer apparatus 995  which was a Dycor System   1000 Quadrapole Mass Spectrometer Model #D200MP with a HOVAC Dri-2 Turbo 60 Vacuum System connected to an  EUV  spectrometer 991   by  line 992  and  valve 993.    The  EUV spectrometer 991  was a McPherson extreme UV region spectrometer.   Model   234/302VM   (0.2   meter   vacuum   ultraviolet spectrometer)  with a 7070 VUV channel  electron multiplier.     The  scan interval   was   0.01 nm, the inlet and outlet slit were  30-50 Âµm, and the detector voltage  was  2400 volts.     EUV  spectrometer 991   was connected to a turbomolecular pump 988 by  line 985 and valve 987.    The spectrometer  was  continuously  evacuated  to   lO5-lO"6 torr by the turbomolecular pump  988  wherein  the  pressure  was  read  by  cold cathode pressure gauge 986.    The EUV spectrometer was connected to<br>
the gas discharge cell light source 907 by connector 976 which provided a light path through the 2 mm diameter pin hole inlet 974 and the 2 mm diameter pin hole  outlet 975  to the aperture of the EUV  spectrometer. The connector 976  was  differentially pumped to   KT1  torr by a turbomolecular pump  988  wherein  the  pressure  was  read  by  cold cathode pressure  gauge 982.     The turbomolecular pump 984  connected  to the connector 976 by line 981  and valve 983.<br>
In the case of KNO3,,   the  catalyst  reservoir  temperature   was  450-<br>
500 Â°C.   In the case of KI   catalyst,   the  catalyst  reservoir  temperature  was 700-800 Â°C.    The cathode 920 and anode 910 were nickel.    In one run, the cathode 920 was nickel  foam metal coated with   KI catalyst.    For other experiments,   1.)  the cathode  was a hollow  copper cathode  coated with   KI catalyst, and the conducting cell 901  was the anode, 2.) the cathode was a   1/8  inch diameter stainless steel tube  hollow  cathode,  the conducting cell 901   was the anode, and  KI   catalyst  was  vaporized directly  into the  center of the cathode by heating the catalyst reservoir to 700-800 Â°C, or 3.) the cathode and anode were nickel and the   KI catalyst was  vaporized  from  the   KI coated cell walls by the plasma discharge.<br>
The  vapor  phase  transition  reaction  was  continuously  carried  out  in gas discharge cell 907  such that a flux of extreme UV emission was produced therein.    The  cell  was operated under flow  conditions  with a total  pressure  of   1-2  torr controlled  by  mass  flow  controller 934  where the  hydrogen  was  supplied  from  the  tank 980 through  the  valve  950. The  2  torr pressure under which cell  907  was  operated significantly exceeded  the  pressure  acceptable  to run  the UV  spectrometer 991;  thus, the  connector 976  with  differential  pumping  served  as  "window"  from the  cell  907  to  the  spectrometer 991.    The  hydrogen  that  flowed  through light  path   inlet  pin  hole  974  was  continuously  pumped  away  by  pumps 984   and  988.     The  catalyst   was  partially  vaporized  by  heating  the catalyst  reservoir  971.  or it  was  vaporized  from  the  cathode  920 by  the plasma  discharge.     Hydrogen  atoms  were  produced  by  the  plasma discharge.     Hydrogen catalysis  occurred  in  the  gas phase  with  the  contact of catalyst ions with hydrogen atoms.    The catalysis  followed by disproportionation of atomic  hydrinos  resulted in  the emission  of photons directly,  or emission  occurred  by  subsequent  reactions  to  form  dihydrino molecular ions and by  formation of hydrino hydride  ions  and compounds.<br>
Further emission  occurred  due  to  excitation  of increased  binding  energy hydrogen  species  and  compounds  by  the  plasma.<br>
13.6.2    Results and Discussion<br>
The EUV spectrum (20-75nm) recorded of hydrogen alone  and hydrogen catalysis  with   KN03 catalyst vaporized from the  catalyst<br>
reservoir by heating is shown in FIGURE 53.    The broad peak at 45.6 nm with  the presence  of catalyst is  assigned to the potassium electron recombination reaction given by Eq. (4).    The predicted wavelength is 45.6 nm   which is  agreement with that observed.    The broad nature  of the peak  is  typical  of the  predicted  continuum  transition  associated  with  the electron transfer reaction.    The broad peak at  20-40nw is assigned to the continuum   spectra  of compounds  comprising  hydrino   hydride  ions H-(l/8)-H-(l/12), and the broad peak at  54-65 nm is assigned to the continuum   spectra  of compounds  comprising  hydrino   hydride   ion H-(l/6).<br>
The EUV spectrum (90-93nm)  recorded  of hydrogen  catalysis  with KI  catalyst  vaporized  the  nickel  foam  metal  cathode  by  the plasma discharge is shown in FIGURE 54.   The EUV spectrum (89-93nm)   recorded of hydrogen catalysis with a five  way  stainless  steel  cross  gas discharge cell that served as the anode, a stainless steel hollow cathode, and   KI catalyst that was  vaporized directly  into  the plasma of the  hollow cathode  from  the  catalyst  reservoir  by  heating  which  is  superimposed  on four control (no catalyst) runs is shown in FIGURE 55.    Several peaks are observed which  are  not  present in  the spectrum of hydrogen alone  as shown in FIGURE 53.    These peaks are assigned to the catalysis of hydrogen   by   "  (Eqs. (3-5); Eq. (64)) wherein the line splitting of about   600 OH"'   is assigned to vibrational coupling with gaseous   KI   dimers which comprise the catalyst [S. Datz, W. T. Smith, E. H. Taylor, The Journal of Chemical Physics, Vol. 34, No. 2, (1961), pp. 558-564].    The splitting of the  91.75 nm  line   corresponding  to  hydrogen  catalysis  by  vibrational coupling    is demonstrated by comparing the spectrum shown in FIGURE 54 with the EUV spectrum (90-92.2 nm)  recorded  of hydrogen  catalysis with   KI catalyst vaporized from the hollow copper cathode by the plasma discharge shown in FIGURE 56.    With sufficient vibrational energy provided by the catalysis of hydrogen,  the dimer is predicted  to<br>
dissociate.    The feature broad feature at  89 nm of FIGURE 55 may represent   the   KI  dimer dissociation energy of 0.34 eV.    Vibrational excitation occurs during catalysis according to Eq.  (3) to give shorter wavelength emission for the reaction given by Eq.  (64) or longer wavelength  emission  in  the  case  that the  transition  simultaneously excites a vibrational mode of the  KI dimer.    Rotational coupling as well as vibrational coupling is also seen in FIGURE 55.<br>
In addition to the line spectra shown in FIGURES 54, 55, and 56, the catalysis  of hydrogen  was  predicted to  release  energy  through  excitation of normal hydrogen which could be observed via EUV spectroscopy by eliminating  the contribution due to the discharge.    The catalysis  reaction requires  hydrogen  atoms  and  gaseous  catalyst  which  are  provided  by  the diseharge.    The time constant to turn off the plasma was measured with an oscilloscope to be less than  100 usec.    The half-life of hydrogen atoms is of a different time scale, about one second [N. V. Sidgwick, The Chemical  Elements and Their Compounds. Volume I, Oxford, Clarendon Press.  (1950),  p. 17.],  and the  half-life of hydrogen atoms from  the stainless  steel  cathode  following  termination of the  discharge  power is much  longer (seconds  to minutes).     The  catalyst pressure  was  constant. To eliminate the  background emission directly  caused by  the plasma,  the discharge was gated with an off time of  10 milliseconds up to 5  seconds and an on time of 10 milliseconds to  10 seconds.    The gas discharge cell comprised a five  way stainless  steel cross that served as the anode with a stainless steel hollow cathode.    The  KI   catalyst  was  vaporized  directly into  the plasma of the  hollow cathode from the catalyst reservoir by heating.<br>
The EUV spectrum was obtained which was similar to that shown in FIGURE 55.   During the gated EUV scan at about 92 nm,  the  dark counts (gated  plasma  turned off) with  no catalyst  were   20Â±2;  whereas,  the counts  in the catalyst case were  about 70.    Thus, the energy  released by catalysis  of hydrogen,   disproportionation,   and  hydrino  hydride   ion  and compound  reactions  appears  as  line emission  and emission  due  to  the excitation of normal  hydrogen.     The  half-life for hydrino chemistry that excited  hydrogen  emission  was  determined  by  recording  the  decay  in  the emission over time after the power supply was switched off.    The half-life  with  the stainless  steel hollow cathode with constant catalyst vapor pressure was determined to be about five to  10 seconds.<br>
The EUV spectrum (20-120 nm)  recorded  of normal  hydrogen  and hydrino  hydride  compounds  that were  excited  by  a plasma  discharge  is shown in FIGURE 57 and FIGURE 58, respectively.    The position of the hydrino hydride binding energies in free space are shown in FIGURE 58. Under the  low  temperature  conditions  of the discharge,  the  hydrino hydride ions bonded to one or more cations to form neutral hydrino hydride compounds  which were excited by the  plasma discharge  to emit the observed spectrum.    The  gas discharge cell comprised a five  way stainless  steel cross that served as the anode with  a hollow  stainless  steel cathode.    In the case of the reaction to form hydrino hydride compounds, the   KI catalyst was vaporized directly into the plasma of the hollow cathode from the catalyst reservoir by heating.    Compared to a discharge of standard hydrogen shown in FIGURE 57, the spectrum of hydrino hydride compounds with hydrogen shown in FIGURE 58 has  an  additional feature  at   Î»= 110.4 nm  as  well  as  other features  at  shorter  wavelengths (Î» 
The  mass  spectrum  (w/e = 0-100)  of the  gaseous  hydrino  hydride compounds  was  recorded  alternatively  with  the  EUV  spectrum.     The mass  spectrum   (m/e = 0-110) of the vapors from the crystals from a gas discharge  cell  hydrino  hydride  reactor comprising  a   KI catalyst and a  M electrodes with a sample heater temperature of 225 Â°C shown in FIGURE<br>
35  with parent peak identifications  shown in TABLE  4  are  representative of the results.    A significant m/e = 4  peak was observed  in  the mass spectrum  that  was  not present  in controls comprising  discharge  with hydrogen alone.    The  584 A emission of helium was not observed in the EUV spectrum.   The m/e = 4 peak was assigned to  Hl(1/ p)  which  serves<br>
as a  signature  for the presence of dihydrino molecules.<br>

-    The EUV spectrum (120-124.5 nm) recorded of hydrogen  catalysis  to form  hydrino  that  reacted  with  discharge  plasma  protons  is  shown  in FIGURE 59.   The KI catalyst was vaporized from the walls  of the quartz cell  by the plasma discharge at nickel electrodes.    The peaks are assigned to the emission due to the reaction given by Eq. (70).    The  0.03 eV(42 nm)<br>
splitting of the EUV emission lines is assigned to the  7 + 1 to J   rotational transitions  of   H'2[2c =a,]"  given by  Eq.  (71) wherein  the  transitional<br>
energy  of the reactants  may  excite  a rotational  mode  whereby  the rotational  energy  is emitted with the reaction energy  to cause a  shift  to shorter wavelengths,  or  the molecular ion may  form  in  an  excited rotational  level with a shift of the emission to longer wavelengths.    The agreement  of the  predicted  rotational energy  splitting  and  the  position  of the peaks is excellent.<br>

A   reaction   for  preparing   hydrino   hydride  ion-containing   compounds is given by Eq. (8).    Hydrino atoms which react to form hydrino hydride ions may be produced by an electrolytic cell hydride reactor and a gas cell hydrino hydride reactor which  were used  to prepare  crystal  samples  for TOFSIMS.    The hydrino hydride compounds were collected directly in both cases, or they were purified from solution in the case  of the electrolytic cell.

The solution was allowed to stand open for three months at room temperature  in a 250 ml beaker.    White nodular crystals formed on  the walls of the beaker by a mechanism equivalent to thin layer  chromatography   involving   atmospheric   water  vapor  as   the   moving phase and  the Pyrex  silica of the beaker as the stationary phase.    The crystals were collected, and TOFSIMS was performed.    XPS (XPS  sample #9)  was  also  performed.<br>

13.7.2      Time-Of-Flight-Secondary-Ion-Mass-Spectroscopy   (TOFSIMS)<br>
Samples were sent to Charles Evans East for TOFSIMS analysis.    The powder  samples   were   sprinkled   onto  the   surface  of  double-sided  adhesive tapes.    The  instrument  was a Physical  Electronics,  PHI-Evans TFS-2000. The primary ion beam was a  wGa+   liquid metal ion gun with a primary beam voltage of  15 kV bunched.    The nominal analysis regions were (12pti)<br>

acceleration voltage was 8000 V.    The contrast diaphragm was zero.    No energy slit was applied.    The gun aperture was 4.    The samples were<br>
analyzed  without  sputtering.     Then,  the  samples  were  sputter cleaned  for 30 s to remove hydrocarbons with a 40Hn  raster prior to  repeat  analysis. The positive and negative SIMS  spectra were acquired for three  (3) locations on each sample.    Mass spectra are plotted as the number of secondary  ions  detected (Y-axis)  versus  the mass-to-charge  ratio  of the ions (X-axis).<br>

White crystals formed on standing at room temperature  for one  week.    The  XPS  survey  spectrum  was  obtained by mounting   the   sample   on   a   polyethylene   support.<br>
XPS  Sample #12.    The sample was prepared by   1.) acidifying the K2CO3 electrolyte from the BLP Electrolytic Cell with  HNO3, 2.) heating the<br>
acidified solution to dryness at 85  Â°C, 3.) further heating the dried solid to 170Â°C to form a melt which reacted with  MO as a product, 4.) dissolving the products in water, 5.) filtering the solution to remove  MO, 6.) allowing crystals to form on standing at room temperature, and 7.)<br>
recrystallizing the crystals.    The XPS was obtained by mounting  the sample  on   a  polyethylene   support.<br>
XPS  Sample #13.    The sample was prepared from the cryopumped crystals isolated from the 40 Â°C cap of a gas cell hydrino hydride reactor comprising a  KI  catalyst, stainless steel filament leads, and a  W   filament which  was  prepared by   1.)  rinsing  the  hydrino hydride  compounds  from the cap of the cell where they were preferentially cryopumped,  2.) filtering the  solution to remove water insoluble compounds  such  as  metal, 3.) concentrating  the solution until  a precipitate just formed with  the solution at  50 Â°C, 4.)  allowing yellowish-reddish-brown crystals  to form on standing  at  room  temperature,  and  5.)  filtering  and  drying  the  crystals before the XPS and mass spectra (gas cell sample #1) were  obtained.<br>

13.7.4    Results and Discussion<br>
In the case that an  M + 2  peak was assigned as a potassium hydrino hydride compound in TABLES  13-16 and  18-33, the intensity of the  M + 2 peak   significantly  exceeded   the  intensity  predicted  for  the  corresponding "K peak, and the mass was correct.    For example, the intensity of the peak assigned to  KHKOH2 was about equal to or greater than the intensity of the peak assigned to   K2OH as shown in FIGURE 60 for TOFSIMS sample #8 and TOFSIMS sample #10.<br>
For any compound or fragment peak given in TABLES  13-16 and  18-33 containing an element with more than one isotope, only the lighter isotope is  given  (except in  the case of chromium where  identifications were  with   52CV).    In each case, it is implicit that the peak corresponding to the   other  isotopes(s)  was  also  observed  with  an  intensity  corresponding  to about  the  correct  natural abundance (e.g.   58M, 60M, and 6IM; 63Cw and 65Cu; 50Cr, 52Cr, 53Cr; and 54Cr; MZn, bbZn, 61Zn, and 68Zn; and 92Mo, 94Mo, 95Mo, 96Mo, 97Mo, 98Mo, and lcÂ°Mo).<br>
In the case of potassium, the  WK   potassium   hydrino   hydride compound peak was observed at an intensity relative to corresponding   41#<br>
peak  which  greatly  exceeded  the  natural  abundance.     In  some  cases  such as 39KH2+ and K3H2NO3, the 41A   peak was  not present or a  metastable  neutral<br>
was present.    For example, in the case of 39KH2+,  the  corresponding   41K  peak was not present.    But, a peak was observed at  m/e = 41.36 which   may account for the missing ions indicating that the  41Kspecies  (41M/2+) was a neutral   metastable.<br>
A more  likely alternative explanation is that  39K and 41K  undergo exchange,  and  for certain hydrino  hydride  compounds,  the  bond  energy  of the  WK hydrino hydride compound exceeds that  of the   41K  compound  by substantially  more  than  the thermal  energy.     The  stacked TOFSIMS  spectra m/e = 0-50 in the order from bottom to top of TOFSIMS sample #2, #4. #1, #6, and #8 are shown in FIGURE 61 A, and the stacked TOFSIMS spectra m/e = 0-50 in the order from bottom to top of TOFSIMS sample #9, #10, #11, and #12 are shown in FIGURE 61B.    The top two spectra of FIGURE 61K are  controls  which  show  the natural   39KI 41K ratio.    The remaining spectra of FIGURES 61A and 61B demonstrate the presence of  '9KH2+ in the absence of  "41KH2;.<br>
The  selectivity  of hydrino atoms  and  hydride  ions to  form  bonds with  specific  isotopes  based  on  a differential  in  bond energy  provides  the explanation  of the  experimental  observation  of the  presence  of  wM/:+  in the absence of 4lKH2  in the TOFSIMS  spectra of crystals from both electrolytic and  gas  cell  hydrino  hydride  reactors  which  were  purified  by  several different  methods.     A  known  molecule  which exhibits  a differential  in bond  energy  due  to  orbital-nuclear  coupling  is  ortho  and  para  hydrogen. At absolute zero, the bond energy of para-H2   is   103.239  kcal/mole; whereas,  the bond energy of onho-H2 is  102.900 kcal/mole.    In the case of deuterium,  the bond energy of  para-D2 is  104.877 kcal/mole,  and the bond energy of ortho-D, is 105. 048 kcal/ mole [H. W. Wooley, R. B. Scott. F. G. Brickwedde, J. Res. Nat. Bur. Standards, Vol. 41, (1948). p. 379]. Comparing   deuterium   to  hydrogen,   the   bond  energies   of deuterium  are greater  due   to  the   greater  mass   of deuterium   which   effects   the   bond energy  by   altering  the   zero  order  vibrational  energy  as  given  in  '96  Mills GUT.     The  bond  energies  indicate  that  the  effect of orbital-nuclear coupling on  bonding  is comparable  to  the  effect of doubling  the  mass,  and  the orbital-nuclear coupling  contribution  to  the  bond  energy  is  greater in  the case of hydrogen.    The latter result is due to the differences in magnetic moments   and   nuclear  spin  quantum  numbers  of the   hydrogen  isotopes.<br>
For hydrogen,  the  nuclear spin quantum  number is   I = 1/2,  and the  nuclear magnetic  moment  is  ÂµP =2.79268 ÂµN where  ÂµN is the nuclear magneton.    For deuterium,    1 = 1, and ÂµD = 0.857387ÂµN.    The difference in bond energies of para versus  ortho hydrogen is 0.339 kcal/mole or 0.015  eV.    The thermal energy of an ideal gas at room temperature given by   3/2kT is 0.038 eV where   k  is the Boltzmann constant and  T  is  the  absolute  temperature. Thus,   at  room   temperature,  orbital-nuclear  coupling   is   inconsequential. However,  the orbital-nuclear coupling force is a function of the  inverse electron-nuclear distance  to the fourth power and its  effect on  the  total energy  of the  molecule  becomes  substantial  as  the  bond  length  decreases.<br>
The   internuclear  distance   2c'   of dihydrino molecule is <br>
which is â€”   times  that of ordinary hydrogen.    The effect of orbital-nuclear P<br>
coupling  interactions   on  bonding   at  elevated  temperature   is  observed   via the  relationship  of fractional  quantum  number to the  para  to ortho ratio of<br>
dihydrino molecules.    Only para   and<br>
are  observed  in  the  case of dihydrino  formed  via  a  hydrogen  discharge with  the  catalyst  (Î»7) where  the  reaction  gasses flowed through  a   100% CuO  recombiner  and  were  sampled  by  an  on-line  gas  chromatograph  as shown in FIGURE 47.   Thus, for  the  effect  of orbital-nuclear  coupling on  bond  energy  exceeds  thermal  energy  such  that  the  Boltzmann distribution   results   in  only  para.<br>
The same effect is predicted for potassium isotopes.    For 39K, the nuclear spin  quantum  number is   I = 3/2,  and the nuclear magnetic moment is  =0.39097 ÂµN.  For 41K, I = 3/2, and H= 0.21459 ,Âµw [Robert C.<br>
Weast, CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 58 Edition, CRC Press, West Palm Beach, Florida. (1977). p. E-69J.    The masses of the potassium isotopes  are  essentially   the  same;   however,   the  nuclear  magnetic   moment of 39K." is about twice that of 41K'.    Thus, in the case that an increased binding  energy  hydrogen  species  including  a  hydrino  hydride  ion   forms  a bond   with   potassium,   the   -39K"  compound  is  favored  energetically.     Bond formation  is  effected  by  orbital-nuclear coupling  which  could  be substantial  and  strongly  dependent  of the  bond  length  which  is  a  function of the  fractional  quantum  number  of the  increased  binding  energy hydrogen species.    As a comparison, the magnetic energy to flip the<br>
orientation  of the  proton's  magnetic  moment,   Âµp, from parallel to antiparallel  to the direction of the magnetic flux  Es  due to electron spin and the magnetic flux  Bu  due to the orbital angular momentum of the<br>
electron where the radius of the hydrino atom is  â€” is shown in '96 Mills<br>

September   1996  Edition,  provided by BlackLight Power,  Inc.,  Great Valley Corporate Center, 41   Great Valley Parkway, Malvern,  PA  19355,  pp.   100-101].    The total energy of the transition from parallel to antiparallel alignment,   AE0/N, is given as<br>

where corresponds  to  parallel  alignment of the  magnetic  moments  of the  electron and  proton,  corresponds  to  antiparallel  alignment  of the magnetic  moments  of the electron  and proton,   afl is the Bohr radius of the hydrogen  atom,  and   is the Bohr radius.    In increasing from a fractional<br>
quantum   number  of   n = 1, / = 0 to n = 5,  = 4, the energy increases  by a factor of over 2500.     As  a  comparison,  the  minimum electron-nuclear<br>

 to  give  a comparable electron-nuclear distance  and  with  two electrons and two protons Eqs. (72) and (73) provide an estimate of the orbital-nuclear  coupling  energy   of  ordinary   molecular  hydrogen   of about 0.01   eV which is consistent with the observed value.    Thus, in the case of a potassium   compound  containing  at   least  one   increased  binding   energy hydrogen   species   with   a   sufficiently   short   internuclear  distance,   the differential   in   bond  energy   exceeds   thermal  energies,   and  compound becomes  enriched  in  the   ;39K'  isotope.    In the case of hydrino hydride compounds   KHn. the  selectivity of hydrino atoms and hydride ions to form<br>

The positive ion spectrum of sample #3 was similar to the positive ion spectrum of sample #1.    The spectrum was dominated by   K+, and Na+ was  also present.     Other peaks containing potassium  included   KC+, KXO*, KOH+ KCO+ and K2.    Common fragments lost were  C (mle = 12.0000), 0 (mle = 15.99491), CO (m le = 27.99491), and  CO2 (ml e = 43.98982).    The metals indicated were in trace  amounts.    The   KfOH+1 KO+  ratio was higher in the<br>

The series of peaks with an  interval of 138 were also observed at 39,  177, and 315  ([K+l387/]+), but their intensities were lower in sample #3.

The TOFSIMS spectrum of sample #3 was that of a combination of the spectrum of sample #1  as well as the spectrum of the fragments  of the  compound  formed by  the displacement of carbonate  by nitrate.

XPS results of interest are XPS sample #5 (TOFSIMS  sample #6) and XPS sample #10 (TOFSIMS sample #3) summarized in TABLE  17.)    During acidification of the  K2CO3,  electrolyte to prepare sample #6, the pH<br>
repetitively increased from 3 to 9 at which time additional acid was added with carbon dioxide release. A reaction consistent with this observation is the displacement reaction of NO for CO3' as given by Eq. (76). The novel<br>

The  negative ion  spectrum was dominated by the oxygen peaks as was the case for the negative spectrum of sample #1.    However, instead of the halogen peaks,  the   M92- and M9-   peaks  were  observed  in  the  spectrum<br>

Mass  spectroscopy and TOFSIMS  are complementary.    The  former method   as   implemented  herein  detects  the   volatile   hydrino   hydride compounds.     TOFSIMS  operates  in  an ultrahigh  vacuum  whereby  the volatile   compounds   are  pumped  away,   but  the   nonvolatile   compounds   are detected.    The TOFSIMS of sample #3 corresponds to the mass spectrum of electrolytic cell sample #5 and electrolytic cell sample #6.    The mass spectrum   (m/e = 0-110)  of the  vapors  from  the  yellow-white  crystals  that formed  on  the outer edge of a crystallization dish  from the acidified electrolyte  of the   K2CO3,  Thermacore Electrolytic Cell  (electrolytic  cell<br>
sample #5)  with  a sample heater temperature of 220  Â°C  is  shown in FIGURE 26A and with a sample heater temperature of 275 Â°C is shown in FIGURE 26B.   The mass spectrum (w/e = 0-110) of the vapors from electrolytic cell sample #6 with a sample heater temperature of 212 Â°C is shown in FIGURE 26C.    The parent peak assignments of major component hydrino   hydride   compounds   followed   by   the   corresponding   m I e of the fragment  peaks appear  in TABLE 4.    The  mass  spectrum  (ml e = 0-200) of the   vapors   from  electrolytic   cell   sample  #6  with  a  sample  heater temperature  of   147  Â°C  with  the  assignments  of major  component  hydrino hydride  silane  compounds  and  silane  fragment  peaks   is  shown  in  FIGURE 26D.     Silane  hydrino  hydride  compounds  were  also  observed  and confirmed by TOFSIMS as shown in TABLES  15 and  16.<br>
The  confirmation can be  further extended by  varying  the  ionization<br>
potential of the mass spectrometer.    For example, the TOFSIMS  identifies the  hydrino  hydride  compound   KH3(m/e = 42) as shown in TABLES 14 and 16.   A (m/e = 44) peak assigned to  KH5 that gives rise to  KH3(m/e = 42) by increasing the  ionization energy is  observed for the  mass  spectrum (m/e = 0-200) of the vapors from the crystals prepared from cap of a gas cell  hydrino hydride reactor comprising  a   Kl  catalyst,  stainless  steel filament leads, and a  W  filament with  a  sample  heater  temperature  of  157 Â°C.    (The sample was prepared as described in under Gas Cell Samples of the  Identification of Hydrino Hydride Compounds by  Mass  Spectroscopy Section.)    The mass spectra with varying ionization potential  (IP=30 eV, IP=70 eV, IP=150 eV) appear in FIGURE 62.

All  of the  peaks  shown  in  FIGURE 62 corresponding  to  hydrino  hydride compounds   increased  with   ionization  potential.     As  the  ionization  energy was  increased from 70 eV to  150 eV the  (m/e = 44)  peak  increased  in intensity,  and  a  large   m/e = 42  peak was  observed.    Carbon dioxide has a (m / e = 44)  peak,  but it does not have a  in I e = 42 peak.   The  (mle = 44)   peak was assigned to   KHs.   The in I c - 42  peak was assigned to   KH3   produced   by the  following  fragmentation  reaction  of   KH5  at  the higher  ionization energy<br>

The m/e = 42 peak which is not present at IP=70 eV but is present at IP=150 eV and the (m/e = 44) peak which is present at IP=70 eV and IP=150 eV is a signature and identifies KH5 and KH3<br>
Shown in FIGURE 63 is the mass spectrum (m/e = 0-50) of the vapors from  the crystals prepared by concentrating 300 cc of the   K2CO3<br>
electrolyte from the BLP Electrolytic Cell using a rotary evaporator at 50 Â°C until a precipitate just formed (XPS sample #7; TOFSIMS sample #8) with a sample heater temperature of 100 Â°C.    As the ionization energy was increased from 30 eV to 70 eV, a (m/e = 22)  peak was  observed  that  was the  same  intensity  as  an  observed  (m/e = 44) peak.    Carbon dioxide gives rise to a (m / e = 44) peak and a (m/e = 22)   peak   corresponding  to   doubly ionized   CO, (m / c = 44).    However, the (m/e = 22)  peak of carbon dioxide is about 0.52% of the (m/e = 44)  peak  [Data taken  on  UT1-100C-02  quadrapole residual  gas  analyzer with   VK = 70V, VIE=15V, VFO = -20V.

The (m/e = 44) peak was assigned to  KH5.

In   the  case   that   the   hydrino  hydride  compound  comprises   two   or  more hydrino  hydride   ions   H'(1/p)  with  low  quantum  number   /;,  an  exceptional<br>
branching  ratio  is  posSi6le whereby  the doubly  ionized  ion peak is  of similar magnitude as the singly ionized ion peak.    This is due to the relatively low binding energy of the second electron that is ionized.    The data indicates that in the case that the hydrino hydride compound   KH5<br>
fragments  to   KH, as given by Eq. (78), KH5  comprises   two  hydrino  hydride ions  H-(l/p)  with  high quantum  number   p.    The ionization energies are high as given in TABLE  1; thus, fragmentation is favored over double ionization.    The m/e = 42 peak which is not present at IP=70 eV but is present at IP=150 eV and the  (m/e = 44) peak which is present at IP=70 eV and IP=150 eV as well as the exceptional intensity of the doubly  ionized (m/e = 44)  peak is  a  signature  and  identifies hydrino  hydride  compound KH, of the present invention.<br>
As the ionization energy was increased from 30 eV to 70 eV a m/e = 4  peak was observed.    The reaction follows from Eq. (32).<br>

H4(1I p)  serves as a signature  for the presence of dihydrino molecules  and<br>
molecular  ions  including  those  formed  by  fragmentation  of increased binding  energy  hydrogen compounds  in  a  mass  spectrometer.     As demonstrated by the correlation of peaks and signatures, TOFSIMS  and  MS taken   together   provide   redoubtable   support  of  the   assignments   given herein.<br>
TOFSIMS  has  the  ability to further confirm the  structure by providing  a  unique  signature  for metastable ions.    In the case of the each positive   spectra   and   each   reference   spectra,   broad  features   are   observed in the  mass  region   m/e = 23-24  and in the mass region  m/e = 39-41.   These features  are  indicative  of the  formation  of metastable  ions  from  neutrals which contain  and  fragment to   Na+ and K+, respectively    The intensities of the  metastable  ion  peaks  vary  significantly  between  the  hydrino  hydride ion containing  samples  and the reference  samples.    The results  indicate that  hydrino  hydride  compounds  form  different  neutrals  than   the   neutrals formed  during TOFSIMS  in the reference  case.<br>
In  addition  to showing  the  hydrino hydride ion  peaks, XPS  also confirms the TOFSIMS data.    For example, the TOFSIMS sample #1  also corresponds  to the  XPS  sample #6.    The  hydrino hydride  ion peaks H'(n = 1/ p) for p = 2 to 1 = 16  are identified in FIGURE 21.    The survey<br>
spectrum shown in FIGURE 20 shows that two forms of carbon  are present due to the  presence of two  C l8   peaks.    The peaks are assigned  to ordinary potassium   carbonate   and   polymeric   hydrino-hydride-bridged   potassium carbonate.<br>
TOFSIMS sample #3 is similar to XPS sample #5.    The survey spectrum shown in FIGURE  18 shows that two forms of nitrogen are present due to the presence of two  N Is peaks as well as the presence of two forms of carbon due to the presence of two  Cls peaks.    The nitrogen peaks   are  assigned  to  ordinary  potassium  nitrate  and  polymeric   hydrino-hydride-bridged  potassium  nitrate.     The carbon  peaks  are  assigned  to ordinary   potassium   carbonate   and   polymeric   hydrino-hydride-bridged potassium   carbonate.<br>
XPS was performed to confirm the TOFSIMS data.    The splitting of the principle or Auger peaks of the survey spectrum of XPS  samples #4 -#7; #10 - #13 indicative of two forms of bonding involving the atom of each split peak are shown in TABLE  17.    The selected survey spectra with the corresponding  FIGURES  of the 0-70 eV region high resolution spectra (#/#)  are given.    The 0-70 eV region high resolution  spectra contain hydrino hydride ion peaks.    And, several of the shifts of the peaks of elements  which  comprise  hydrino hydride  compounds  given  in  TABLE   17 and  shown  in  the  survey  spectra are  greater than those  of known compounds.    For example, the XPS spectrum of XPS sample #7 which appears  in  FIGURE 64  shows extraordinary potassium,  sodium,  and oxygen peak shifts.    The results shown in FIGURE 64 are not due to uniform or differential charging.    The oxygen   KLL   Auger peaks  superimpose   those  of the XPS  survey spectrum of XPS sample #6, and the  number of lines, their relative intensities and the peak shifts varies.    The  spectrum is  not a superposition  of  repeated  survey   spectra  that  are   identical   except  that they  are shifted and scaled by a constant factor; thus,  uniform charging is ruled  out.     Differential  charging is eliminated because the  carbon and oxygen peaks have a normal peak shape.    The range of binding energies from the literature [C. D. Wagner. W. M. Riggs, L. E. Davis, J. F. Moulder, G. E. Mulilenberg  (Editor).  Handbook  of X-ray  Photoelectron   Spectroscopy, Perkin-Elmer  Corp..   Eden   Prairie.   Minnesota,   (1997).]   (minimum   to maximum,  min-max)  for the peaks of interest are given  in the final row of TABLE   17.    The peaks shifted to an extent that they are without identifying   assignment   correspond   to   and   identify   compounds   containing hydrino  hydride  ion,  according  to the present invention.     For example,  the positive and negative TOFSIMS spectra (TOFSIMS sample #8) given in TABLES 22 and 23 showed large peaks which were identified as  KHKOH and   KHKOH2.    The extraordinary shifts of the  K3p, K3s, K2p3, K2p, and<br>
K 2s XPS peaks and the  O Is XPS peak shown in FIGURE 64 are assigned to these compounds.    The TOFSIMS and XPS results support the assignment of bridged  or   linear  potassium  hydrino  hydride   and  potassium  hydrino hydroxide compounds.     As a further example, the   Na KLL, peak was<br>
significantly   shifted  to  both  higher  and  lower  binding  energies  consistent with   bonding   involving   electron  donating   and   electron   withdrawing   groups such as  NaSiH6 and Na2H2,  respectively.    These  compounds  are  given  herein<br>
by TOFSIMS.    TOFSIMS and XPS taken together provide redoubtable support  of  hydrino  hydride  compounds  as  assigned  herein.<br>

The positive  and negative TOFSIMS  is consistent with the majority compound  and  fragments   comprising   NaNO2&gt; NaNO.    The compound was filtered from an initially 0.57 M   K2CO3 electrolyte.    The solubility of NaOH is 42Â°rÂ£/100cc(10.5M).   The solubility of NaNO2 is 81.515Â°cg/100 cc (11.8 M), and the  solubility of  NaNO, is 92.\2ycg/100 cc (10.8 M).    Whereas, the solubility of A:,CO, is 11225Â°cÂ£/100 cc (8.1 M), and the solubility of KHCO is 22.4' 7100 cc (2.2 M) [R. C. Weast, Editor. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and  Physics. 58th Edition, CRC Press, (1977), pp., B-143 and B-161.]. Thus,  NaNO, and  NaNO  as the precipitate is  unexpected.    The  solubility<br>
result   supports   the   assignment   of  bridged   hydrino   hydride   nitrite   and nitrate  compounds  that are  less  soluble  than   KHCO,.<br>
The observation  by  TOFSIMS  that the  majority compound  and fragments   contains   NaNO2-, &gt; NaNO3  is further confirmed by the presence of<br>
nitrite and nitrate nitrogen in the XPS  (XPS  sample #4  summarized in TABLE 17).   The XPS Na Is peak and the  N Is peak as nitrite (403.2 eV) greater than  nitrate  (407.0 eV)  confirm  the  majority  species  as   NaNO2&gt; NaNO,.    The TOFSIMS and XPS results support the assignment of bridged or  linear  hydrino  hydride   nitrite  and   nitrate  compounds  and   bridged   or linear  hydrino  hydride  hydroxide  and  oxide  compounds.     General structures   for   the   sodium   nitrate   hydrino   hydride   compounds   are   given by  substitution  of sodium  for potassium  in  the  structures  given  for  Eq. (76).

Hydrino hydride compounds were also observed by  XPS  and mass spectroscopy that confirmed the TOFSIMS results.    The XPS  spectra shown in FIGURE  16 and FIGURE  17 and the mass spectra shown in FIGURES 25A-25D with the assignments given in TABLE 4 correspond to TOFSIMS sample #5.    The XPS spectra shown in FIGURE 18 and FIGURE  19 and the mass spectra shown in FIGURE 24 with the assignments given in TABLE 4 correspond to TOFSIMS  sample #6.<br>
The positive  and negative TOFSIMS  is consistent with  the majority compound   and   fragments   comprising   KNO3 KNO2.    The observation by TOFSIMS  that  the  majority compound  and fragments contains   KNO3 KNO2,  is  further confirmed  by  the presence of nitrite  and nitrate  nitrogen in the XPS (XPS sample #5 summarized in TABLE 17).   The K3p, K3s, K2p3, K2p and K 2s XPS peaks and the N Is XPS peak as nitrate (406.5 eV)  greater than  nitrite  (402.5  eV) confirm the  majority  species  as   KNO, &gt; KNO,.    The TOFSIMS  and  XPS  results  support the assignment of bridged or linear   hydrino   hydride   nitrite   and   nitrate   compounds   and   bridged   or linear   hydrino   hydride   hydroxide   and   oxide   compounds.<br>

Other species  observed  were   L/+, B\ Na+, Si+, Cl-, /", PO2, and PO.    The hydrino hydride  iloxane  series   SinH2n2Â±lOm- was observed in the  negative  spectra.<br>
XRD(Cu KÎ±, (Î»= 1.54059) was also performed on TOFSIMS sample #11.    The XRD pattern corresponded to identifiable peaks of  K2SO4.   In addition,   the  spectrum  contained  unidentified  intense  peaks  at  a  2-theta values of 17.71,  18.49, 32.39, 39.18, 42.18, and 44.29.

The positive ion  spectrum was dominated by   K+, and Na+ was also present.     Other  peaks  containing  potassium  included   KXHVO+, KxNyO+, and KWHXPVO+.

A very large  KH  peak  (100,000  counts)  was  present  which confirms  that   KH3 is volatile since it was obtained via cryopumping of the reaction products of the gas cell hydrino hydride reactor.    This   m/e = 42 peak confirms  the   m/e = 42  peak observed as a function of ionization potential  of the mass  spectrometer for a similar gas cell sample as shown in FIGURE 62.

The 0 eV to 80 eV binding energy region of an X-ray Photoelectron Spectrum (XPS) of  KI (XPS sample #15) is shown in FIGURE 67.    Comparing FIGURE 66 to FIGURE 67, hydrino hydride ion peaks H'(n = 1/ p) for p = 3 to p = 16  were observed.    The XPS survey  spectrum of<br>
(XPS sample #14) was consistent with silicon, oxygen, iodine,  sulfur, aluminum,  and  chromium.     Small  molybdenum, copper,  nickel,  and  iron peaks were also seen.    The other elements seen by TOFSIMS  were below the detection limit of XPS.    No potassium peaks were observed at the XPS detection   limit.<br>
The  XPS   silicon  peak  confirms  the  hydrino  hydride  silane  and siloxane compounds observed in the TOFSIMS spectra.    XPS  further confirms  the TOFSIMS  spectra  that  the major components  were  metal hydrino  hydrides  such  as  chromium  hydrino  hydride.     The presence  of metal  with  hydrino  hydride  and  oxide  ions  indicates  that the  metal hydrino hydride  may  become oxidized  over time.     The  observed  metals<br>
(Î»s  metal   hydrino  hydrides)  were  cryopumped  at   a  temperature   at  which these  metals  alone  have no volatility.     Furthermore,  for each  major primary element of the sample,  a shoulder or unusual XPS  peak of the primary  element  was  found  at  the binding energy  of a  hydrino  hydride ion as shown in FIGURE 66.   This may be due to bonding of a hydrino hydride ion to a primary element to form a compounds such as  MHn,<br>
where   M is a metal and n is an integer as given in TABLE 32.   As a further example,  a shift of the potassium  3p and oxygen 25 of XPS sample #7 shown in FIGURES 22 and 64 to the position of the hydrino hydride ion H-(l/6)  at binding energy (22.8 eV) may be due to the presence of KHKOH which is seen in the TOFSIMS spectrum (TOFSIMS sample #8) shown in FIGURE 60.   XPS and TOFSIMS confirm the presence of hydrino hydride compounds.     The present TOFSIMS  data was particularly compelling due  the presence of the  isotope peaks  of the  metal  hydrino hydrides.<br>
13.8     Identification  of Hydrino  Hydride  Compounds  by  Fourier Transform Infrared   (FT1R)   Spectroscopy<br>
Infrared   spectroscopy   measures   the   vibrational   frequencies   of  the bound atoms or ions of a compound.    The technique is based on the fact that  bonds  and   groups  of bonds  vibrate  at  characteristic  frequencies. When  exposed   to   infrared  radiation,  a  compound   selectively   absorbs infrared   frequencies   that  match   those  of allowed   vibrational   modes. Therefore,  the   infrared  absorption  spectrum  of a  compound  reveals which  vibrations,  and thus  which  functional groups,  are present in  the structure.    Thus,  novel vibrational frequencies that do not match  the functional groups of known posSi6le compounds in a sample are signatures   for   increased   binding   energy   hydrogen   compounds.<br>
13.8.1     Sample  Collection  and  Preparation<br>
A   reaction   for  preparing   hydrino  hydride   ion-containing compounds is given by Eq. (8).    Hydrino atoms which react to form hydrino  hydride  ions  may  be  produced  by  an  electrolytic  cell  hydride reactor which  was  used to prepare crystal samples for FTIR  spectroscopy.<br>
The  hydrino  hydride  compounds  were  collected  directly   or  they  were purified  from  solution  wherein  the   K2CO3  electrolyte  was  acidified  with HNO3  before  crystals  were  precipitated  on a  crystallization  dish.<br>
Sample #1.    The sample was prepared by concentrating the electrolyte  from  the  Thermacore  Electrolytic  Cell  until  yellow-white crystals just formed.     The XPS (XPS sample #6), XRD spectra (XRD sample #2), TOFSIMS spectra (TOFSIMS sample #1), NMR (NMR sample #1), and ESITOFMS spectra (ESITOFMS sample #2) were also obtained.<br>
Sample #2.    A reference comprised 99.999%   KHCO,. Sample #3.    A reference comprised 99.999%   K2CO3,.<br>
Sample #4.    The sample was prepared by  1.) acidifying 400 cc of the   K2CO3,  electrolyte of the Thermacore Electrolytic Cell  with  HNO3, 2.)<br>
concentrating the acidified solution to a volume of 10 cc.  3.) placing the concentrated  solution  on a crystallization dish,  and 4.)  allowing crystals  to form  slowly  upon  standing  at  room  temperature.     Yellow-white  crystals formed on the outer edge of the crystallization dish.    XPS  (XPS sample #10),  mass  spectra  (mass  spectroscopy  electrolytic  cell  samples  #5  and #6), XRD spectra (XRD samples #3A and #3B), and TOFSIMS (TOFSIMS sample  #3)  were  also  obtained.<br>

13.8.2     Fourier Transform  Infrared  (FTIR)  Spectroscopy<br>
Samples  were  sent  to  Surface  Science  Laboratories.   Mountain  View California  for FTIR analysis.    A  sample of each material  was transferred to   an   infrared   transmitting   substrate   and   analyzed   by   FTIR   spectroscopy using a Nicolet Magna 550 FTIR Spectrometer with a NicPlan FTIR microscope.    The number of sample scans was 500.    The  number of background scans was 500.    The resolution was 8.000.    The sample gain was 4.0.    The mirror velocity was  1.8988.    The aperture  was   150.00.<br>
13.8.3    Results and Discussion<br>
The  FTIR  spectra of potassium bicarbonate  (sample  #2)  and potassium  carbonate   (sample  #3)  were  compared  with  that  of  sample  #1. A  spectrum of a mixture of the  bicarbonate  and the carbonate  was produced  by digitally  adding the  two reference  spectra.     The  two standards  alone  and  the  mixed  standards  were compared  with  that  of sample #1.     From  the comparison, it was determined  that  sample #1 contained   potassium   carbonate  but  did  not  contain  potassium bicarbonate.     The  second component could be  a bicarbonate  other than potassium  bicarbonate.     The  spectrum  of potassium  carbonate   was digitally  subtracted  from  the  spectrum  of sample #1.     The  subtracted spectram  appears in  FIGURE 68.     Several bands were  observed  including bands in the   1400-1600 cm'1  region.    Some organic  nitrogen compounds (e.g.  acrylamides,  pyrolidinones)  have  strong  bands   in  the  region 1660 on"'.    However, the lack of any detectable  C-H  bands  and  the  bands in the  700 to 1100cm-   region  indicate an  inorganic  material.     Peaks assigned   hydrino  hydride  compounds  were   observed   at   3294, 3077, 2883, 1100cm-1  2450, 1660, 1500, 1456, 1423, 1300, 1154, 1023, 846, 761, and  669cHf'. The  novel   peaks   without  identifying  assignment  correspond  to   and identify   hydrino   hydride  compounds  according   to   the   present   invention. The FTIR results were confirmed by XPS (XPS sample #6), TOFSIMS (TOFSIMS sample #1), and NMR (NMR sample #1) as described in the corresponding   sections.<br>
The overlap FTIR spectrum of sample #1  and the FTIR spectrum of the reference potassium carbonate appears in FIGURE 69.    In the  700 to 2500 cm"1  region, the peaks of sample #1  closely resemble those of potassium  carbonate,   but   they  are   shifts   about   50 cm'1  to lower frequencies.     The   shifts  are  similar  to  those  observed  by  replacing potassium   (K2CO3)  with   rubidium   (Rb2CO3,)   as   demonstrated   by   comparing<br>
llieir IR spectra [M. H. Brooker, J. B. Bates, Spectrochimica Acata, Vol. 30A, (194), pp.  2211-2220.1.

The infrared spectral bands of sample #4 match those of  KNO3  identifying a major component of sample #4 as  KNO33 with two exceptions.    Peaks assigned  to  hydrino  hydride  compounds  were  observed  at   2362 cm'  and 2336 cm-1.    The novel peaks were confirmed by overlaying the FTIR spectrum  of the  reference comprising 99.999%   KNO3 (sample #5) with the<br>
FTIR spectrum of the sample #4.    The peaks were only present in the FTIR spectrum of sample #4.    The novel peaks without identifying assignment  correspond   to   and   identify   hydrino  hydride   compounds, according  to the  present invention.    The FTIR results were confirmed by XPS  (XPS  sample #10),  mass spectroscopy (mass     spectroscopy  electrolytic cell samples #5 and #6), TOFS1MS (TOFSIMS sample #3), and XRD (XRD samples  #3A  and  #3B)  as  described  in  the corresponding  sections.<br>

13.9     Identification  of Hydrino Hydride Compounds by  Raman Spectroscopy<br>
Raman   spectroscopy   measures  the  vibrational  frequencies   of  the bound atoms or ions of a compound.    The vibrational frequencies are a function of the bond strength and the mass of the bound  species.    Since the  hydrino and hydrino hydride  ion are each equivalent  in mass to  the hydrogen  atom,   novel  peaks  relative  to  the  spectrum  of  hydrogen  bound to the a given  species such as nickel are indicative of different  bond strengths.     A  different  bond  strength  can  only  arise  if the  binding  energy of  the  electrons  of hydrogen  species  is  different  from   the   known  binding energies.     Thus,   these   novel   vibrational   frequencies   are   signatures   for increased   binding   energy   hydrogen   compounds.<br>
13.9.1     Sample Collection and Preparation<br>
A   reaction   for  preparing   hydrino  hydride  ion-containing compounds is given by Eq. (8).    Hydrino atoms which react to form hydrino hydride ions may be produced by a  K2CO3  electrolytic  cell<br>
hydride  reactor.     The  cathode  was  coated  with hydrino  hydride compounds during  operation,  and a nickel wire from  the  cathode  was used as the sample for Raman spectroscopy.    Controls comprised a control cathode wire from  an identical   Na2CO3 electrolytic cell and a sample of the same nickel wire used in the  K2CO3  electrolytic cell.    An additional sample was obtained from the electrolyte of a  K2CO3 electrolytic cell.<br>
13.9.1.1	Nickel Wire Samples.<br>
Sample #1.    Raman spectroscopy was performed on a nickel wire that was  removed from the cathode of the   K2CO3   Thermacore   Electrolytic<br>
Cell  that  was rinsed  with distilled water and dried.<br>
Sample #2.     Raman spectroscopy was performed on  a nickel  wire that was  removed from the cathode of a control  Na2CO3 electrolytic cell<br>
operated  by  BlackLight  Power.  Inc.  that was  rinsed  with  distilled  water and dried.    The cell  produced no enthalpy of formation of increased binding  energy   hydrogen  compounds  during  two  years  of operation  and was identical to the cell described in the Crystal Samples from an Electrolytic Cell Section except that  Na2CO3 replaced   K2CO3 as the<br>
electrolyte.<br>
Sample #3. Raman spectroscopy was performed on the same nickel wire (NI 200 0.0197", HTN36NOAG1, Al Wire Tech, Inc.) that was used in the electrolytic cells of sample #1 and sample #2.<br>
13.9.1.2	Crystal  Sample.<br>
Sample #4.    The sample  was prepared by concentrating 300 cc  of the   K2CO3 electrolyte from the BLP Electrolytic Cell using a rotary<br>
evaporator at 50 Â°C until a precipitate just formed.    The volume was about 50 cc.    Additional electrolyte was added while heating at 50 Â°C until  the  crystals  disappeared.     Crystals  were then  grown over three weeks by allowing the saturated  solution to stand in a sealed round<br>
bottom flask for three weeks at 25Â°C.   The yield was 1 g.    XPS (XPS sample #7), TOFSIMS (TOFSIMS sample #8), 39K NMR (39K NMR sample #1), and ESITOFMS (ESITOFMS sample #3) were also performed.<br>
13.9.2    Raman  Spectroscopy<br>
Experimental  and  control  samples  were  analyzed  blindly   by  the Environmental  Catalysis  and  Materials  Laboratory  of Virginia Tech. Raman  spectra  were  obtained with a Spex 500 M  spectrometer coupled with a liquid nitrogen cooled CCD (charge coupled device) detector (Spectrum One, Spex).    An Ar+  laser (Model 95, Lexel) with the light wavelength of 514.5  nm was used as the excitation source, and a holographic  filter (SuperNotch  Plus,  Kaiser)  was employed  to effectively reject the elastic  scattering  from  the sample.    The  spectra were taken  at ambient  conditions  and  the  samples  were  placed  in capillary  glass  tubes (0.8-1.1  mm OD, 90 mm length,  Kimble) on a capillary sample holder (Model   1492.  Spex).     Spectra of the powder samples were acquired using the following condition:    the laser power at the sample was   10 mW,  the slit width of the  monochromator was 20 mm which corresponds  to a resolution of 3  cm-1, the detector exposure time was  10 s, and 30 scans were  averaged.     The  wires  were  directly placed on  the same  sample holder.     Since  the  Raman  scattering from the  wires were  significantly weaker,  the  acquisition  conditions  for their spectra  were:   the  laser power at the sample was  100 mW, the slit width of the monochromator was 50 mm which corresponds to a resolution of 6  cm'1,  the  detector exposure time was 30 s, and 60 scans were averaged.<br>

of sample #2 and sample #3.    The identifiable peaks of each spectrum are indicated.    In addition, sample #1  (cathode of the  K2CO3  electrolytic  cell)<br>
contained a number of unidentified peaks at 1134cm"1, 1096 cm"1, 1047 cm"', 1004cm"1, and 828cm"1. The peaks do not correspond to the known Raman peaks of K2CO3 or KHCO3 [I. a. Gegen, G. A. Newman, Spectrochimica Acta,<br>
Vol. 49A, No. Si6, (1993), pp. 859-887.] which are shown in TABLE 35 and TABLE 36, respectively.    The unidentified Raman peaks of the crystals from the cathode of the   K2CO3}   electrolytic  cell  hydrino  hydride<br>

In addition to Raman  spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), calorimetry,   and   gas   chromatography   experiments   were   performed   as given in  the corresponding sections.

The  results  of the  measurement  of the  enthalpy  of the  decomposition reaction   of  hydrino   hydride   compounds   measured   with   the   adiabatic calorimeter are shown in FIGURE 43 and TABLE 8.    The results indicate that  the  decomposition  reaction  of hydrino  hydride  compounds  is  very exothermic.    In the best case, the enthalpy was  1MJ   released  over 30 minutes.     The  gas  chromatographic analysis (60 meter column)  of high purity hydrogen is shown in FIGURE 45.    The results of the gas chromatographic  analysis of the  heated  nickel wire  cathode of the   K2CO3,<br>

The Raman spectrum of sample #4 appears in FIGURE 72.    In addition  to the  known peaks of  KHCO3,  and a small peak assignable to K2CO3,  unidentified  peaks  at   1685 OH"'  and 835 cm'1  are present.    The unidentified  Raman  peak  at   1685 cm"' is in the region of N-H bonds.   FTIR sample #1   also contains unidentified bands in the   1400-1600 cm-[  region.<br>
Raman sample #4 and FTIR sample #1  do not contain  N-H bonds by XPS studies.    The  N Is XPS peak of the former is at 393.6 eV and the  N Is XPS peak of the later is a very broad peak at about    390 eV.    Whereas, the  N Is XPS peak of compounds containing an  N-H bond is seen at about 399 eV, and the lowest energy   N Is XPS peak for any known compound is about 397 eV.<br>
The 835 cm-l peak of Raman sample #4 is in the region of bridged and  terminal  metal-hydrogen  bonds  which  are  also  indicated  in  Raman sample  #1.     The  novel  peaks  without  identifying  assignment  correspond to  and  identify  hydrino  hydride  compounds,  according  to  the  present invention.<br>
13.10- Identification  of Hydrino  Hydride Compounds  by  Proton  Nuclear Magnetic  Resonance  (NMR)  Spectroscopy<br>
NMR can distinguish  whether a proton of a compound is present as a proton,   H, a hydrogen atom, or a hydride ion.    In the later case, NMR<br>
can  further  determine  whether  the  hydride  ion  is  a  hydrino  hydride   ion<br>
and  can  determine  the  fractional   quantum  state  of  the  hydrino  hydride ion.    The proton gyromagnetic <br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The NMR frequency  /  is the product of the proton gyromagnetic ratio<br>
given by Eq. (83) and the magnetic flux  B.<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
A typical flux for a superconducting NMR magnet is 6.357 T.   According to Eq. (84) this corresponds to a radio frequency (RF) of 270.6557591 MHz. With a constant magnetic field,  the frequency is scanned  to yield the spectrum.    Or, in an example of a common type of NMR spectrometer, the radiofrequency   is   held  constant  at   270.6196 MHz,  the  applied   magnetic<br>
field   is varied over a small range, and the frequency of<br>
energy  absorption  is  recorded  at  the  various  valves  for   Hâ€ž.   Or, the field<br>
is varied with an RF pulse.    The spectrum is typically scanned and displayed as a function of increasing  H0.    The protons that absorb energy at a lower H0  give rise to a downfield absorption peak;  whereas, the protons that absorb energy at a higher  H0 give rise to an upfield<br>
absorption peak.    The electrons of the compound of a  sample influence the  field  at the  nucleus  such that it deviates  slightly  from the  applied value.    For the case that the chemical environment has no NMR effect, the value of H0   at  resonance  with  the  radiofrequency held  constant  at<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
In  the case that the chemical environment has a NMR effect, a different value of H0  is required for resonance.    This chemical shift is proportional<br>
to the electronic magnetic flux change at the nucleus due to the  applied field which in the case of each hydrino hydride ion is a function of its radius.    The change in the magnetic moment,  Am, of each electron of the hydride ion due to an applied magnetic flux  B is [Purcell, E., Electricity and   Magnetism. McGraw-Hill, New York, (1965), pp. 370-389.]<br>
The change in magnetic flux  AB at the nucleus due to the change in magnetic   moment.   Am, of each electron follows from Eq. (1.100) of Mills [Mills, R., The Grand Unified Theory of Classical Quantum Mechanics. September 1996 Edition (" '96 Mills GUT")].<br>
where   Âµ0 is the permeability of vacuum.    It follows from Eqs.  (86-87) that the diamagnetic  flux (flux opposite to the applied field) at the nucleus is inversely proportional to the radius.    For resonance to occur,<br>
Î”H0, the change in applied field from that given by Eq. (85), must<br>
compensate by an equal and opposite amount as the field due to the electrons of the hydrino hydride ion.    According to Eq. (21), the ratio of the  radius  of the  hydrino hydride  ion   H'(1/ p}  to that of the hydride ion<br>
H (1/1)  is the reciprocal of an integer.    It follows from Eqs. (85-87) that compared to a proton with a no chemical shift, the ratio of Î”H0 for resonance  of the  proton  of the  hydrino  hydride  ion   H'(1/ p} to that of the hydride  ion   H'(1/1)  is a positive  integer (i.e.  the absorption peak of the hydrino hydride ion occurs at a valve ofÎ”Hl that is a multiple of p   times the value of Î”H0  that is resonant for the hydride ion compared to that of a proton with no shift where  p is an integer).    However, hydride ions are<br>
not  present  as   independent  ions  in  condensed  matter.     Hydrino  hydride ions  form  neutral  compounds  with  alkali  and  other cations  which contribute a significant downfield NMR shift to give an NMR signal in a range  detectable  by  an  ordinary  proton  NMR  spectrometer.     In  addition, ordinary   hydrogen  may  have  an  extraordinary  chemical   shift  due   to  the presence  of one or more increased binding energy hydrogen.species  of a compound  comprising   ordinary   and  increased   binding   energy   hydrogen species.    Thus, the posSi6ility of using proton NMR was explored to identify   hydrino   hydride   ions   and   increased   binding  energy   hydrogen compounds  by  their  novel  chemical  shifts.<br>
13.10.1     Sample  Collection  and Preparation<br>
A   reaction   for   preparing   hydrino   hydride   ion-containing compounds is given by Eq. (8).    Hydrino atoms which react to form hydrino  hydride  ions  may  be  produced  by  an  electrolytic  cell   hydride reactor  which  was  used  to prepare  crystal  samples  for NMR  spectroscopy.<br>
Sample #1.     The sample  was prepared  by concentrating the electrolyte   from   the  Thermacore   Electrolytic  Cell   until  yellow-white crystals just formed.    XPS (XPS sample #6).

Samples  were  sent  to  Spectral  Data  Services, Champaign,   Illinois. Magic-angle  solid  proton  NMR  was performed.    The data were  obtained on  a custom  built  spectrometer operating  with  a  Nicolet   1280  computer. Final pulse generation was from a tuned Henry radio amplifier.    The   'H NMR frequency was 270.6196 MHz.    A 2Âµsec  pulse corresponding to a 15Â° pulse length and a 3 second recycle delay were used.    The window<br>
was  Â±31 kHz.    The spin speed was 4.5 kHz.    The number of scans was 1000.    Chemical shifts were referenced to external TMS.    The offset was 1527.12 Hz.    The magnetic flux was 6.357 T.<br>
13.10.3    Results and Discussion<br>
The NMR spectra of sample #1 is shown in FIGURE 73.    The peak assignments are given in TABLE 37.    The NMR spectrum of the K2CO3,   reference,  sample #2,  was extremely weak.     It contained a<br>
water peak at  1.208 ppm,  a peak at 5.604 ppm, and very broad weak peaks at  13.2 ppm, and  16.3 ppm.    The NMR spectrum of the  KHCO3,<br>
reference,  sample #3,  contained a large peak at 4.745 with a small shoulder at 5.150 ppm, a broad peak at  13.203 ppm, and  small peak at   1.2  ppm.<br>
The hydrino hydride compound peaks shown in FIGURE  73  and assigned in TABLE 37 were not present in the control.    The NMR spectrum   was  observed  to   be  reproducible,   and  the  hydrino  hydride compound peaks were observed to be present in the NMR spectra of samples   prepared   from   the   K2CO3,  cell by different methods (e. g.<br>
TOFSIMS sample #3).    The peaks could not be assigned to hydrocarbons.     Hydrocarbons  were  not  present  in   sample  #1   based on the TOFSIMS spectrum (TOFSIMS sample #1) and the FTIR spectrum  (FTIR  sample #1).    The  novel  peaks  without  identifying assignment   correspond   to   and   identify   hydrino   hydride   compounds, according  to the present invention.    The assignment of hydrino hydride compounds was confirmed by XPS (XPS sample #6), XRD spectra (XRD sample #2), TOFSIMS (TOFSIMS sample #1), FTIR spectrum (FTIR sample #1), and ESITOFMS spectra (ESITOFMS sample   #2)   described   in   the  corresponding  sections.<br>

13.11     Identification   of Hydrino  Hydride  Compounds  by   Electrospray-lonization-Time-Of-Flight-Mass-Spectroscopy   (ESITOFMS)<br>
Elcctrospray-Ionization-Time-Of-Flight-Mass-Spec troscopy (ESITOFMS)  is a method to determine  the mass spectrum  over a large dynamic range of mass to charge ratios (e.g.   mle= 1-600)   with   extremely high precision (e.g.  Â±0.005 amu).    Essentially the  M + 1  peak of each compound   is  observed   without   fragmentation.     The   analyte   is   dissolved   in a carrier solution.    The  solution  is pumped  into and  ionized  in  an electrospray  chamber.     The  ions  are  accelerated  by  a pulsed  voltage,  and the  mass of each  ion is then determined with a high resolution time-of-flight   analyzer.<br>
13.11.1     Sample  Collection  and  Preparation<br>
A   reaction   for   preparing   hydrino  hydride   ion-containing compounds is given by Eq. (8).    Hydrino atoms which react to form hydrino  hydride  ions  may  be  produced  by  a  gas cell  hydride- reactor which was used to prepare crystal samples for ESITOFMS.    The hydrino hydride   compounds   were  collected  directly   following   cryopumping   from the   reaction   chamber.<br>
Sample #1.    The sample was prepared by collecting a dark colored band of crystals from  the top of the gas cell hydrino hydride reactor comprising  a   KI  catalyst, stainless steel filament leads, and a   W   filament that were  cryopumped  there during operation of the cell.     XPS  was also performed   at   Lehigh   University.<br>
Sample  #2.     The   sample  was  prepared  by  concentrating  the   <br>
electrolyte   from   the  Thermacore   Electrolytic  Cell   until   yellow-white crystals just formed.     XPS  was also obtained at Lehigh University by mounting  the  sample  on  a polyethylene  support.     In  addition  to ESITOFMS, XPS (XPS sample #6). XRD (XRD sample #2), TOFSIMS (TOFSIMS sample #1). FTIR (FTIR sample #1). and NMR (NMR sample #1), were  also  performed  as  described  in  the  respective  sections.<br>
Sample #3.    The sample was prepared by concentrating 300 cc  of the   K2CO3,  electrolyte from the BLP Electrolytic Cell using a rotary<br>
evaporator at 50 Â°C until a precipitate just formed.    The volume was about 50 cc.     Additional  electrolyte  was  added  while  heating at  50 Â°C until   the   crystals  disappeared.     Crystals   were   then   grown   over   three weeks   by   allowing  the   saturated   solution  to   stand   in  a  sealed  round bottom flask for three weeks at 25Â°C.    The yield was  1  g.    In addition to ESITOFMS, XPS (XPS sample #7), TOFSIMS (TOFSIMS sample #8), 39K" NMR (39K  NMR sample #1).  and Raman spectroscopy (Raman sample #4) were also   performed.<br>
Sample #4.    The  sample was prepared  by collecting a red/orange<br>
band of crystals that  were  cryopumped  to the  top of the  gas  cell hydrino hydride reactor at about   100Â°C comprising a   Kl  catalyst and a nickel fiber mat dissociator that was heated to  800 Â°C by external  Mellen heaters.    The TOFSIMS spectrum (TOFSIMS sample #9) was also obtained as given in the TOFSIMS section.<br>
Sample #5.    The sample was prepared by collecting a yellow  band of crystals that were  cryopumped  to the top of the  gas cell  hydrino hydride reactor at about   120Â°C  comprising a   Kl catalyst and a nickel fiber mat dissociator that was heated to 800 Â°C by external  Mellen heaters.    The TOFSIMS spectrum (TOFSIMS sample #10) was also obtained as given in the TOFSIMS section.<br>

13.11.2       Electrospray-Ionization-Time-Of-Flight-Mass-Spectroscopy<br>
(ESITOFMS)<br>
Samples  were  sent  to  Perseptive  Biosystems  (Framingham,  MA)  for ESITOFMS analysis.    The data was obtained on a Mariner ESI TOP system fitted  with  a  standard  electrospray  interface.     The   samples  were submitted via a loop injection system with a  5 \il loop at a flow rate of 20,uHmin.    The solvent was wateracetonitrile (50:50) with  1% acetic acid. Mass  spectra  are  plotted  as  the  number of ions detected  (Y-axis)  versus the  mass-to-charge  ratio of the  ions  (X-axis).<br>
13.13.3    Results and Discussion<br>
In the case that an   M + 2   peak  was assigned  as  a potassium  hydrino hydride compound in TABLES  38-41, the intensity of the   M+ 2   peak significantly  exceeded   the   intensity  predicted   for  the  corresponding   "41K peak, and the mass was correct.    For example, the intensity of the peak assigned to  KHKOH2  was at least twice that predicted for the intensity of<br>
the   41A'  peak corresponding  to   K2OH.   In the case of 39KH2,+, the ""41K'   peak was   not  present  and   peaks  corresponding  to  a  metastable   neutral   were observed m/e = 42.14 and m le = 42.23 which  may  account  for  the  missing ions  indicating  that the  41K species  (41KH2"_) was a neutral  metastable.    A more  likely  alternative  explanation  is  that   WK and 41AT   undergo  exchange, and for certain  hydrino hydride  compounds,  the bond energy- pf the   â„¢K hydrino  hydride  compound  exceeds  that  of the   41A'   compound  by substantially   more  than   the  thermal  energy  due  to  the  larger  nuclear magnetic  moment of  39K'.    The  selectivity of hydrino atoms and  hydride ions to form bonds with specific isotopes based on a differential in bond energy  provides   the   explanation   of the  experimental  observation  of  the presence  of  39KH2+  in the absence of "KH2; in the TOFSIMS spectra presented   and  discussed  in  the  corresponding  section.     Taken   together ESITOFMS and TOFSIMS confirm the isotope selective bonding of increased   binding   energy   hydrogen   compounds.<br>

The ESITOFMS  spectra of experimental samples had a greater intensity  potassium  peak  per  weight     than  the  starting  material  control samples.     The  increased  weight percentage potassium  is  assigned  to potassium   hydrino   hydride   compound   KHnn = lto5   (weight % K &gt; 88%) as a<br>
major component of the sample.    The  41K peak of each ESITOFMS spectrum   of  an   experimental   sample  was  much   greater  than   predicted from  natural  isotopic abundance.    The    inorganic  m/e = 4\  peak was assigned  to   KH2-,.    The ESITOFMS spectrum was obtained for a potassium carbonate  control  and  a potassium  iodide  control  where  each  was  run  at 10 times  the  weight  of material  as the experimental  samples.     The spectra  showed  the  normal   41Kl 39K  ratio.    Thus, saturation of the detector did  not  occur.     As  further confirmation  the  spectra were  repeated  with mass chromatograms on a series of dilutions (10X,   100X,  and  1000X) of each experimental and control sample.

13.12     Identification  of Hydrino  Hydride Compounds  by Thermogravimetric   Analysis   and   Differential   Thermal   Analysis (TGMDTA)<br>
Thermogravimetric    Analysis<br>
Thermogravimetric   analysis   is   a  method  which   determines   the dynamic  relationship  between  temperature  and  mass  of a  sample.     The mass Of the  sample  is  recorded  continuously  as its  temperature  is  linearly increased from ambient to a high temperature (e.g.  1000 Â°C).    The resulting   thermogram   provides   both   qualitative   and   quantitative information.     The  derivative  curve  of  the  thermogram   (derivative thermal  analysis)  gives  additional  information  that  is  not  detected  in  the thermogram   by   improving   the  sensitivity.     Each  compound  has   a  unique thermogram  and derivative  curve.     Novel rates of weight  change  as  a function  of time  with  a  temperature  ramp as  compared  to the  control  are signatures   for   increased   binding   energy   hydrogen   compounds.<br>
Differential   Thermal   Analysis<br>
Differential  thermal  analysis  is  a  method  where  the  heat  absorbed or emitted  by  a chemical  system  is  observed by  measuring  the temperature   difference   between   that   system   and   an   inert  reference compound  as  the  temperatures  of both  are  increased  at  a constant  rate. The   plot   obtained   between   the   temperature/time   and   the   difference temperature   is   called  a  differential   thermogram.     Various  exothermic   and endothermic   processes   can   be   inferred   from   the   differential   thermogram, and  this  can  be  used  as  a  finger print 'of the  compound  under  study. Differential  thermal  analysis can  also be  used  to determine the  purity  of a compound  (i.e.  whether a mixture of compounds is present in  the sample)<br>
13.12.1     Sample Collection and Preparation<br>
A   reaction   for  preparing  hydrino  hydride   ion-containing compounds is given by Eq. (8).    Hydrino atoms which react to form hydrino hydride  ions may be produced by a  K2CO3  electrolytic  cell<br>
hydride reactor which was used to prepare crystal samples for TGMDTA. The hydrino hydride compounds were purified from solution wherein the K2CO3) electrolyte was acidified with HNO before crystals were<br>
precipitated  on   a  crystallization  dish.<br>
Sample #1.    A reference comprised 99.999%   KNO3<br>
Sample #2.    The sample was prepared by acidifying the   K2CO3 electroiyte from the BLP Electrolytic Cell with  HNO3   and  concentrating the  acidified  solution  until  yellow-white  crystals  formed  on  standing  at room temperature.    XPS  (XPS sample #5), mass spectroscopy of a similar sample  (mass  spectroscopy electrolytic  cell  sample #3), TOFSIMS (TOFSIMS sample #6), and TGMDTA (TGMDTA sample #2) was also performed.<br>
13.12.2     Thermal  Gravimetric  Analysis  (TGA)  and Differential Thermal<br>
Analysis  (DTA)<br>
Experimental  and  control  samples  were  analyzed  blindly   by  TA Instruments, New castle, DE.    The instrument was a 2050TGA, V 5.3 B. The module was a TGA 1000 Â°C.    A platinum pan was used to handle each sample of size 3.5-3.75 g.    The method was TG-MS.    The heating rate was 10 Â°C/min.    The carrier gas to the mass spectrometer (MS) was nitrogen gas at a rate of  100 ml/min.    The sampling rate was 2.0 sec/pt.<br>

indicated.    For the control,  features were observed at 656  Â°C (65 mins.) and 752 Â°C (72.5 mins.).    These feature were also observed for sample #2. In addition, sample #2 contained novel features at 465  Â°C  (45.5  mins.), 708 Â°C (68 mins.), and 759 Â°C (75 mins.) which are indicated in FIGURE 75.<br>
The stacked DTA results of 1.) the reference (TGMDTA sample #1) 2.) TGMDTA sample #2 are shown in FIGURE 76.    The identifiable peaks of each DTA run are indicated.    For the control, features were observed at 136 Â°C, 337 Â°C, 723 Â°C, 900 Â°C, and 972 Â°C.   The 136 Â°C and 337 Â°C features were  also  observed  for sample #2.     However,  for temperatures  above  333 Â°C, a novel differential thermogram was observed for sample #2.    Novel features appeared at 692 Â°C, 854 Â°C, and 957 Â°C which are indicated in FIGURE 76.<br>
The novel TGA and DTA peaks without identifying  assignment correspond  to  and  identify  hydrino  hydride  compounds,   according  to  the present   invention.<br>
13.13     Identification  of Hydrino Hydride Compounds by  39K  Nuclear Magnetic  Resonance  (NMR)  Spectroscopy<br>
39K  NMR can distinguish whether a new potassium  compound  is present as a component of a mixture with a known compound based  on a different chemical shift of the new compound relative to that of the known.    In the event that  39K exchange occurs, a chemical shift of the  39AT NMR peak will be observed which is intermediate between that of the standard  and  the  compound  of interest.     Hydrino hydride  compounds have been observed by methods  such as XPS, mass Spectroscopy, and TOFSIMS as described in the corresponding sections.    In the case of the electrolytic  cell,   the  electrolyte  was  pure   K2CO3.    Thus, the posSi6ility of<br>
using   "'39K'   NMR   was  explored  to   identify  potassium  hydrino  hydride formed   during   the   operation   of  the   electrolytic   hydrino   hydride   reactor. Identification  was based on a K2CO3 chemical shift relative to that of the   starting   material<br>

13.13.3     Results  and  Discussion<br>
A  single intense   39K  NMR peak was observed in the spectra of sample #1  and sample #2.    The results are given in TABLE 43 with peak assignments.    A  39K NMR chemical shift was observed for sample #1   relative  to the  starting  material,  sample #2  which  was significant compared  to  typical   39K NMR chemical shifts.   The<br>
presence of one peak in the spectrum of sample #1  indicates that exchange occurred.    To provide the observed peak shift, a  new potassium compound  was present.     The  39K NMR chemical shift corresponds  to  and  identifies  potassium  hydrino  hydride,   according to  the present invention.    The assignment  of potassium  hydrino hydride compounds was confirmed by XPS (XPS sample #7), TOFSIMS (TOFSIMS  sample #8),  Raman spectroscopy (Raman sample #4), mass spectroscopy (FIGURE 63), and ESITOFMS (ESITOFMS sample #3) described  in  the  corresponding  sections.<br>
