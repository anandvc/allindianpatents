DESCRIPTION<br>
	HONEYCOMB CARRIER FOR EXHAUST GAS-CLEANING CATALYST AND<br>
	METHOD FOR PRODUCTION THEREOF<br>
5<br>
	TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
		The present invention relates to a carrier to<br>
	support a catalyst to clean various exhaust gases<br>
	particularly an exhaust gas ot an automobile containing<br>
10	 NOx, and a process for its production.<br>
	BACKGROUND ART<br>
		The chief characteristics required of a honeycomb<br>
	carrier to support a catalyst to be used for an apparatus<br>
15	 for cleaning an automobile exhaust gas which, is<br>
	particularly widely used at present among various<br>
	apparatuses for cleaning an exhaust combustion gas, are<br>
	gol-called heat resistance and thermal shock resistance.<br>
	A high, heat reaistance is required since the honeycomb<br>
20	 carrier will be exposed to a high temperature of 650º C or<br>
	higher by sudden heat generation due to a catalytic<br>
	oxidation reaction of unburned hydrocarbons or carbon<br>
	monoxide in the exhaust gas. Further, the thermal shock<br>
	resistance is a quality to be resistant to cracks or<br>
25	 breakage by a thermal stress caused in the honeycomb due<br>
	to a temperature increase by such sudden heat generation.<br>
	With respect to the thermal shock resistance, the smaller<br><br>
2<br>
	the therma1 expansion coefficient, the greater the<br>
	endurance temperature difference.<br>
		So as to meet such requirements as heat resistance<br>
	and thermal shock resistance various ceramics have been<br>
5	proposed, as a material for a honeycomb carrier, but a<br>
	cordierite material has been chiefly used. The primary<br>
	reason why a cordierite material is used is that<br>
	cordierite has a so high thermal resistance as l,400ºC,<br>
	and it has an extremely small thermal expansion<br>
10	coefficient and high thermal shock resistance among<br>
	ceramics as well.<br>
		However, although a cordierite material as a<br>
	material for a honeycomb carrier has rather excellent<br>
	quality with respect to heat resistance and thermal shock<br>
15	resistance, it is highly disadvantageous when used as a<br>
	catalyst carrier for cleaning an exhaust gas containing a<br>
	nitrogen oxide (NOx) , the removal of which is "urgently<br>
	required from an environmental viewpoint. That is,<br>
	usually a catalyst containing an alkali metal or alkaline<br>
20	 earth metal component is used as a catalyst to remove NOx<br>
	in the exhaust gas. In such a case, a part of the alkali<br>
	metal or alkaline earth metal is infiltrated into<br>
	cordierite as a carrier and reacts with cordierite at a<br>
	high temperature, and such leads to a deterioration of<br>
25	 cordierite and loss of the catalyst as well, and thus<br>
	causes a decrease of removal of NOx in the exhaust gas.<br>
	In order to prevent such a phenomenon, a method of<br><br>
3<br>
	covering the surface of the catalyst with silica (SiO2),<br>
	and the like, have been proposed, but an extra step will<br>
	be required, and an increase in the cost will be<br>
	inevitable.<br>
5		 On the other hand, in a system wherein a fuel is<br>
	directly jetted into an engine or in a system wherein a<br>
	fuel is diluted and burned, which is becoming the main<br>
	stream of a burning system of an automobile in recent<br>
	years from a viewpoint of improvement in mileage and from<br>
10	 an environmental, viewpoint, removal of NOx in the exhaust<br>
	gas is a particularly important concern as compared with<br>
	removal of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Accordingly,<br>
	as a material for a honeycomb carrier to support a<br>
	catalyst to clean an exhaust gas, a material which<br>
15	 replaces cordierite has been strongly desired.<br>
		As materials other than cordierite, WO01/037971<br>
	discloses ceramics such as silicon carbide, silicon<br>
	nitride, mullite, aluminum titanate and lithium aluminum<br>
	silicate. However, they are all insufficient as a<br>
20	 material for the honeycomb Carrier. That is, silicon<br>
	nitride, mullite, etc. have a high thermal expansion<br>
	coefficient and are poor in thermal shock resistance.<br>
	Further, silicon nitride, lithium aluminum silicate, etc.<br>
	are insufficient in view of heat resistance.<br>
25		 Aluminum titanate has excellent stability even at a<br>
	high temperature exceeding l,700ºC, an extremely email<br>
	thermal expansion coefficient and excellent thermal shock<br><br>
4<br>
	resistance. However, it has such a drawback as small<br>
	mechanical strength, since the anisotropy of its crystal<br>
	structure is significant, whereby slip is likely to occur<br>
	at the crystalline interface by a thermal stress.<br>
5		 Resultingly, a honeycomb having a small wall thickness<br>
	and a high cell density is hardly produced with it, and<br>
	its use as a carrier for an exhaust gas-cleaning catalyst<br>
	to which a load of mechanical vibration will be applied<br>
	at a high temperature, tends to be difficult. Further,<br>
10	 such aluminum titanate, etc usually have decomposition<br>
	points within a temperature range Of from 800 to l,200ºC,<br>
	and they can not be used continuously for a long time in<br>
	a region including such a temperature range.<br>
15	 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
		The present invention provides a honeycomb carrier<br>
	which is a carrier tc support a catalyst to clean<br>
	particularly an exhaust gas of an automobile containing<br>
	NOx, which is excellent in heat resistance, thermal shock<br>
20	 resistance, mechanical strength and thermal decomposition<br>
	resistance and has corrosion resistance against a<br>
	catalyst containing an alkali component, and which is<br>
	thereby excellent in durability so that it will not<br>
	deteriorate even in a long term use, and a process for<br>
25	 its product ion.<br>
		In order to solve the above problems, the present<br>
	inventors have conducted extensive studies on aluminum<br><br>
5<br>
	magnesium titanate and aluminum titanate and as a result,<br>
	made the fallowing discoveries. That is, a sintered<br>
	product obtained by firing a mixture comprising a mixture<br>
	comprising a Ti-containing compound, an Al-containing<br>
5	 compound and a Mg-containing compound in a predetermined<br>
	ratio to form aluminum magnesium titanate, or a mixture<br>
	comprising a Ti-containing compound and an Al-containing<br>
	compound in a predetermined ratio to form aluminum<br>
	titanate, and a specific alkali feldspar, an oxide of a<br>
10	 spinel structure containing Mg, or MgO or a Mg-containing<br>
	compound which can be converted to MgO by firing added in<br>
	a predetermined ratio, is very excellent as a carrier to<br>
	support a catalyst to clean an exhaust gas of an<br>
	automobile.<br>
15		 Accordingly, it has been found that a honeycomb<br>
	carrier made of the above sintered product of the present<br>
	invention has high heat resistance and thermal shock<br>
	resistance attributable to low thermal expansion<br>
	properties and further has high mechanical strength and<br>
20	 high thermal decomposition resistance as different from a<br>
	conventional aluminum magnesium titanate sintered product<br>
	or aluminum titanate sintered product, and that the<br>
	sintered product can be used with stability for a long<br>
	period of time without deterioration as a conventional<br>
25	 cordierite material, even when a catalyst containing an<br>
	alkali metal or alkaline earth metal component is used as<br>
	a catalyst for removal of NOx.<br><br>

10	 EFFECTS OP THE INVENTION<br>
		The honeycomb carrier of the present invention has<br>
	high heat resistance and thermal shock resistance<br>
	attributable to low thermal expansion properties and<br>
	further, has high mechanical strength and excellent<br>
15	 thermal decomposition resistance as different from a<br>
	conventional aluminum magnesium titanate sintered product<br>
	or aluminum titanate sintered product, and ia further<br>
	excellent in corrosion resistance against a catalyst,<br>
	Reaultingly, it is useful as a carrier to support a<br>
20	 catalyst to clean any exhaust gas from a combustion<br>
	source of either a stationary body or a mobile body,<br>
	particularly an exhaust gas of an automobile containing<br>
	NOx.<br>
		The reason why the honeycomb carrier of the present<br>
25	 invention has high heat resistance and thermal shock<br>
	resistance and further has excellent mechanical strength<br>
	and thermal decomposition resistance, and does not<br><br>
11<br>
	deteriorate even when used as a carrier Eor a catalyst<br>
	containing an alkali metal component to clean an exhaust<br>
	gas containing NOx, is not necessarily clearly understood.<br>
	However, the following reasons are estimated,<br>
5	 respectively in a case where the honeycomb carrier of<br>
	the present invention is made of an aluminum magnesium<br>
	titanate sintered product and a case where the honeycomb<br>
	carrier of the present invention is made of an aluminum<br>
	titanate sintered product.<br>
10	 (A) In a case where the honeycomb carrier of the present<br>
	invention is made of an aluminum magnesium titanate<br>
	sintered product, the crystals of aluminum magnesium<br>
	titanate as the basic structure are formed in a state<br>
	where, by the presence of an alkali feldspar in their<br>
15	 production process, the alkali feldspar becomes a liquid<br>
	phase, whereby dence crystals will be formed, and the<br>
	mechanical strength will be improved, And, the Si<br>
	component containt in the alkali feldspar will be solid<br>
	salubilized in the crystal lattice of aluminum magaesium<br>
20	 titanate when, aluminum magnasium titanate is formed by<br>
	firing, and as the Si solid-aolutoilization state, two<br>
	types, i.e. si having a coordination number of 6 and<br>
	solid-solubillized in the interior of the crystal grains<br>
	and Si having a coordination number of 4 and solid<br>
25	 solubilized at the surface portion of the crystal grains,<br>
	are considered. This is confirmed also by results by NMR<br>
	(nuclear magnetic resonance) measurement such that si in<br><br>
12<br>
	the aluminum magnesium titanate crystals is present in<br>
	two states of one having a coordination number of 6 and<br>
	one having a coordination number of 4.<br>
		Namely, Si to be solid-solubilized in the interior<br>
5	 of the crystal grains of aluminum magnesium titanate has<br>
	a coordination number of 6 and is tetravalent, and will<br>
	form a pair with bivalent Mg which also has a<br>
	coordination number of 6 so that the pair will be<br>
	aexivalent in total and will be substituted for adjacent<br>
10	 two trivalent Al (sexivalent in total having a<br>
	coordination number of 6). The reason for this will be<br>
	explained from the correlation of ionic radii in addition<br>
	to the maintained balance of electrical charge. That is,<br>
	the ionic radii of Si2+ and Mg2+ are 0.54 Å and 0.86 Å,<br>
15	 respectively. The average ionic radius of the two will<br>
	be 0.70 Å which is close to 0.68 Å i.e. the ionic radius<br>
	of Al3+, whereby the occupation of two Al3+ by the pair of<br>
	Si0+ and Mg2+ will be in a solid solution state which is<br>
	more stable from the viewpoint of energy. Thus, it is<br>
20	 considered that by the simultaneous presence of si and Mg,<br>
	diffusion of ions among the respective cations in<br>
	aluminum magnesium titanate can be suppressed even at a<br>
	high temperature, and a stable crystal structure can be<br>
	secured, whereby excellent thermal decomposition<br>
25	 resistance will be obtained.<br>
		On the other hand Si to be solid-solubilized at the<br>
	surface portion of the crystal grains of aluminum<br><br>
13<br>
	magnesium titanate has a coordination number of 4 not 6.<br>
	This is considered to be because Si at the surface<br>
	portion has a coordination, number of 4, to which oxygen<br>
	is more stably bonded, since the number of cations with<br>
5	 which oxygen is shared, Which are so-called counterparts,<br>
	is small. Accordingly, Si to be solid-solubilized at the<br>
	surface portion of the crystal grains is in a state of<br>
	mimetically coating the crystals of aluminum magnesium<br>
	titanate. Thus, it is considered that the honeycomb<br>
10	 carrier of the present invention, even when used as a<br>
	carrier for a catalyst containing an alkali metal, has<br>
	excellent corrosion resistance against erosion of the<br>
	carrier by an alkali component at a high, temperature,<br>
	whereby it will not deteriorate even in a long term use.<br>
15	 (B) In a case where the honeycomb carrier of the present<br>
	invention is made of an aluminum titanate sintered<br>
	product, by incorporation of an alkali feldspar to the<br>
	mixture for forming aluminum titanate, the alkali<br>
	feldspar which becomes a liquid phase in the vicinity of<br>
20	 the temperature for forming aluminum titanate is present,<br>
	and thus the reaction for forming aluminum titanate will<br>
	take place in the liquid phase, whereby dense crystals<br>
	will be formed, and the mechanical strength will be<br>
	improved. And, the Si component contained in the alkali<br>
25	 feldspar will be solid-salubilized in the crystal lattice<br>
	of aluminum titanate and substitute for Al. Si has a<br>
	smaller ionic radius than Al, whereby the bond length<br><br>
14<br>
	with surrounding oxygen atoms is shorter, and the lattice<br>
	constant tends to be small as compared with pure aluminum<br>
	titanate. Accordingly, it is considered that the<br>
	sintered product to be obtained will have a stabilized<br>
5	 crystal structure and exhibit very high thermal stability,<br>
	and have significantly improved thermal decomposition<br>
	resistance.<br>
		Further, when an oxide of a spinel structure<br>
	containing Mg, ot MgO or a Mg-containing compound which<br>
10	can be converted to MgO by firing is added to the mixture<br>
	forming aluminum titanate, a dense sintered product will<br>
	be obtained, and a sintered product having very high<br>
	mechanical strength as compared with pure aluminum<br>
	titanate will be formed.<br>
15		 Still furthar, when an alkali feldspar, and an oxide<br>
	of a spinel structure and/or MgO or a Mg-containing<br>
	compound. which can be converted to MgO by firing are<br>
	simultaneously added to the mixture forming aluminum<br>
	titanate, Si contained in the alkali feldspar and Mg<br>
20	 contained in the oxide of a spinel structure and MgO or<br>
	the Mg-containing compound which can be converted to MgO<br>
	by firing, will be substituted for mainly Al sites in<br>
	aluminum titanate. When such elements are added by<br>
	themselves, a bivalent (Mg) or tetravalent (Si) element<br>
25	 will be substituted for Al sites where a fundamentally<br>
	trivalent electrical charge balsance is maintainad.<br>
	Accordingly, it is considered that so as to maintain the<br><br>
15<br>
	electrical charge balance, when Mg is added, oxygen is<br>
	discharged out of the system to cause an oxygen defect to<br>
	maintain the electrical charge balance, and when Si is<br>
	added, as si is tetravalent, fundamentally tetravalent Ti<br>
5	 is reduced to trivalent to maintain the alectrical change<br>
	balance.<br>
		On the other hand, Mg has an electrical charge<br>
	amaller by 1 than Al and Si has an electrical charge<br>
	larger by 1 than Al. Accordingly, it is considered that<br>
10	 the electrical charge balance can be maintained by<br>
	simultaneously adding the alkali feldspar and the oxide<br>
	of a spinel structure and MgO or the Mg-containing<br>
	compound which can be converted to MgO by firing, whereby<br>
	Si can be solid-solubilized without influence over other<br>
15	 sintered product-constituting elements.<br>
		Particularly, in such a case, it is considered that<br>
	when the alkali feldspar, the oxide of a spinel structure<br>
	and MgO or the Mg-containing compound which can be<br>
	converted to MgO by firing are added in a ratio close to<br>
20	 an equimolar ratio, the additives can be present more<br>
	stably as compared with a case where they are added by<br>
	themselves. It is considered that from these reasons,<br>
	they synergiscically function, whereby an aluminum<br>
	titanate sintered product, which has significantly<br>
25	 improved. strength as compared, with a case where the<br>
	additives are used by themselves, low thermal expansion,<br>
	properties which aluminum titanate fundamentally has, and<br><br>
16<br>
	high mechanical strength, and yet has improved thermal<br>
	decomposition resistance, will be formed.<br>
		Further, the reason, why the honeycomb carrier of the<br>
	present invention has excellent corrosion resistance<br>
5	 against a catalyst containing an alkali component is<br>
	estimated as follows. Firstly, in the case of a<br>
	honeycomb carrier made of aluminum titanate obtained by<br>
	firing a raw material mixture containing an alkali<br>
	feldspar, when aluminum titanate is formed, the potassium<br>
10	 component contained in the alkali feldspar has been<br>
	already present outside the aluminum titanate crystal<br>
	system (present at the Crystalline interface).<br>
	Accordingly, when a catalyst containing an alkali<br>
	component is supported so that the alkali component is in<br>
15	 contact wich the honeycomb carrier, the osmotic pressure<br>
	of potassium to the honeycomb carrier tends to be low,<br>
	and resultingly infiltration of potassium into the<br>
	carrier will be inhibited.<br>
		On the other hand, in the case of aluminum titanate<br>
20	 obtained by firing a raw materia1, mixture containing an<br>
	oxide or a spinel structure containing Mg, or MgO or a<br>
	Mg-containing compound which can be converted to MgO by<br>
	firing, by the presence of a Mg (one of alkaline earth<br>
	metals) component which is a basic element, the aluminum<br>
25	 titanate sintered product tends to have a decreased<br>
	acidity, whereby its reactivity with the alkali component<br>
	which is a base (one of alkali metals) in the catalyst<br><br>
17<br>
	tends to be low.<br>
		Further, in the case of aluminum titanate obtained,<br>
	by firing a raw material mixture containing both an<br>
	alkali feldspar, and an oxide of a spinel structure<br>
5	 containing Mg, or MgO or a Mg-containing compound which<br>
	can be converted to MgO by firing, it is considered that<br>
	both the above mechanisms will synergistically function,<br>
	whereby very excellent corrosion resistance against an<br>
	alkali component will be achieved.<br>

	BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
		In the present invention, as the material for the<br>
	honeycomb structure catalyst carrier, the following<br>
	aluminum magnesium titanate sintered product (A) or<br>
25	aluminum titanate sintered product (B) ie used.<br>
	(A) Aluminum magnesium titanate sintered product.<br>
		An aluminum magnesium titanate sintered product<br><br>
18<br>
	obtained by firing at from 1,000 to l,700ºC a raw<br>
	material mixture comprising 100 parts by mass, as<br>
	calculated as oxides, of a mixture comprising a Mg-<br>
	containing compound, an Al-containing compound and a Ti-<br>
5	 containing compound in the same metal component ratio as<br>
	the metal component ratio of Mg, Al and Ti in an aluminum<br>
	magnesium titanate represented by the empirical formula<br>
	MgxAl2(1-x)Ti(1+x)O5 (Wherein 0<x and from to parts></x>
	by mass of an alkali feldspar represented by the<br>
10	 empirical formula (NayK1-y)AlSi3O8 (wherein XXX).<br>
		The above Mg-containing compound, Al-containing<br>
	compound and Ti-containing compound to be used as the raw<br>
	materials, are not particularly limited so long as they<br>
	are components capable of synthesizing aluminum magnesium<br>
15	 titanate by firing. The Mg-containing compound, Al.<br>
	containing compound and Ti-containing compound may not<br>
	necessarily be separate compounds respectively, and may<br>
	be a compound containing two or more metal components.<br>
	Such, raw material compounds may usually be suitably<br>
20	 selected among those to be used as raw materials for<br>
	various ceramics, such as alumina ceramics, titania<br>
	ceramics, magnesia ceramics, aluminum titanate ceramics,<br>
	magnesium titanate ceramics, spinel ceramics and aluminum<br>
	magnesium titanate ceramics. Specific examples of such<br>
25	 compounds include oxides such, as Al2O3, TiO2 and MgO,<br>
	composite oxides cantaining at least two types of metal<br>
	components, such as MgAl2O4, Al2TiO3, MgTi2O3, and various<br><br>
19<br>
	spinel structures containing Mg and Ti, compounds<br>
	containing one or more metal components selected from the<br>
	group consisting of Al, Ti and Mg (such as carbonates,<br>
	nitrates or sulfatas).<br>
5		 The blend ratio of the Mg-containing compound, the<br>
	Al-containing compound and the Ti-containing compound is<br>
	such that the ratio of the metal components contained in<br>
	these compounds would be a ratio similar to, preferably<br>
	the same ratio as, the metal component ratio of Mg, Al<br>
10	 and Ti in aluminum magnesium titanate represented by the<br>
	above empirical formula MgxAl2(1-x)Ti(1+x)O5 (wherein O<x></x>
	By using the above respective compounds ae mixed in such<br>
	a ratio, it is possible to obtain aluminum magnesium<br>
	titanate having the same metal component ratio as the<br>
15	 metal component ratio in the mixture used as the raw<br>
	material.<br>
		When a honeycomb filter of the present invention is<br>
	to be obtained, it is necessary to incorporate an alkali<br>
	feldspar as an additive to the above mentioned mixture<br>
20	 comprising the Mg-containing compound, the Al-containing<br>
	compound and the Ti-containing compound. The alkali<br>
	feldspar not only serves as a sintering assistant for<br>
	aluminum magnesium titanate, but also plays a role of<br>
	adding a Si component to the aluminum magnesium titanate,<br>
25	and it is represented by the empirical formula<br>
	(NayK1-y)AlSi3O5. IN the formula,y satisfies XXX),<br>
	preferably 0.lXXX), particularly preferatoly 0.l5XXX0+85<br><br>
20<br>
	An alkali feldspar having value y within this range, has<br>
	a low melting point and is particularly effective for<br>
	promoting the sintering of aluminum magnesium titanate.<br>
		The amount of the alkali feldspar to be used, is<br>
5	 usually from about 1 to 10 parts by mass, preferably from<br>
	about 3 to about 5 parts by mass, per 100 parts by mass<br>
	of the total amount of the Mg-containing compound, the<br>
	Al-containing compound and the Ti-containing compound to<br>
	be used as the raw materials, as calculated as the<br>
10	 respective oxides. In such a case, the total amount of<br>
	the raw material mixture as calculated as oxides, is the<br>
	mass after carrying out heat treatment to remove moisture<br>
	or organic substances contained in the above raw material<br>
	mixture, or when pres in tearing is carried out, the mass<br>
15	 before the main firing after the presintering.<br>
		To the raw material mixture having an alkali<br>
	feldspar added to the mixture comprising the Mg-<br>
	containing compound, the Al-containing compound and the<br>
	Ti-containing compound, other sintering assistants may be<br>
20	 added, if necessary, whereby the nature of the sintered<br>
	product thereby obtainable, can be improved. As such<br>
	other sintering assistants, SiO2, ZrO2, Fe2O3, CaO and Y2O3<br>
	may, for example, be mentioned.<br>
		The above raw material mixture is thoroughly mixed<br>
25	 and pulverised. The mixing and pulverization of the raw<br>
	material mixture are not particularly limited and can be<br>
	carried out by known methods. For example, they may be<br><br>
21<br>
	carried out by means of a ball mill, a medium-stirring<br>
	mill, etc. The pulverization degree of the raw material<br>
	mixture is not particularly limited, but the average<br>
	particle size is preferably at most 10 µm, particularly<br>
5	 preferably from 1 to 5 µm. The smaller the average<br>
	particle size of the raw material mixture, the better, so<br>
	long as it is within a range where no secondary particles<br>
	will be formed.<br>
		Molding assistants may preferably be incorporated to<br>
10	 the law material mixture. As such molding assistants,<br>
	known agents such as a binder, a pore-forming agent, a<br>
	release agent, a defoaming agent and a peptizer may be<br>
	employed. As the binder, polyvinyl alcohol, microwax<br>
	emulsion, methylcellulose or carboxymethylcellulose may,<br>
15	 for example, be preferred. As the pore-farming agent,<br>
	activated carbon, coke, a polyethylene resin, starch or<br>
	graphite may, for example, be preferred. As the release<br>
	agent, a stearic acid emulsion may, for example, be<br>
	preferred; as the defoaming agent, n-octyl alcohol or<br>
20	 octylphenoxyethanol may, for example, be preferred, and<br>
	as the peptizer, diethylamine or triethylamine may, for<br>
	example, be preferred.<br>
		The amounts of the molding assistants are not<br>
	particularly limited. However, in the case of the<br>
25	 present invention, they are preferably within the<br>
	following ranges, respectively, as calculated as solid<br>
	contents, per the total content of 100 parts by mass of<br><br>
22<br>
	the Mg-containing compound, the Al-containing compound<br>
	and the Ti-containing compound to be used as the raw<br>
	materials, as calculated as the respective oxides.<br>
	Namely, it is preferred to use the binder in an amount of<br>
5	 from about 0.2 to about 0.6 part by mass, the pore-<br>
	forming agent in an amount of from about 20 to about 5O<br>
	parts by mass, the release agent in an amount of from<br>
	about 0.2 to about 0.7 part by maas, the deforming agent<br>
	in an amount of from about 0.5 to abot 1.5 parts by mass<br>
10	 and the peptizer in an amount of from about 0.5 to about<br>
	1.5 parts by mass.<br>
		The raw material mixture having such molding<br>
	assistants incorporated, is mixed, kneaded and<br>
	plasticized so that it is extrusion-processable, followed<br>
15	 by extrusion processing to form a honeycomb body. As the<br>
	method for extrusion, a known method may be used, and the<br>
	cross-sectional shape of each cell of the honeycomb may<br>
	be circular, oval, tetragonal or triangular. Further,<br>
	the entire configuration of the honeycomb body may be<br>
20	 either cylindrical or square tubular. The molded<br>
	honeycomb is preferably dried and then fired at from<br>
	1,000 to l,700º C preferably from l,250 to 1,450ºC. The<br>
	firing atmoephere is not particularly limited and is<br>
	preferably an oxygen-containing atmosphere such as in the<br>
25	 air which is commonly employed. The firing time is not<br>
	particularly limited so long as the firing can be done<br>
	until the eintering proceeds sufficiently, and it is<br><br>
23<br>
	usually at a level of from 1 to 20 hours.<br>
		Also with respect to the temperature raising rate or<br>
	the temperature lowering rate at the time of the above<br>
	firing, there is no particular restriction, and such<br>
5	 conditions may be suitably set so that no cracks will be<br>
	formed in the obtainable sintered product. For example,<br>
	it is preferred to gradually raise the temperature<br>
	without rapid rise of the temperature to sufficiently<br>
	remove moisture, the molding assistants such as a binder,<br>
10	 etc. contained in the raw material mixture. Further, if<br>
	neceasary, prior to heating at the above-mentioned tiring<br>
	tamparature, presintering may be carried out preferably<br>
	within a temperature range of from 500 to 1,000ºC for<br>
	from 10 to 30 hours by mild temperature raise, whereby<br>
15	 the thermal stress in the sintered product during the<br>
	formation of aluminum magnesium titanate, can be relaxed,<br>
	and formation of cracks in the sintered product can be<br>
	suppressed.<br>
		The sintered product thus obtainable will be<br>
20	aluminum magnesium titanate represented by the empirical<br>
	formula NgxAl2(1-x)Ti(1+x)O5 (wherein O<x wherein the si></x>
	component contained in an alkali feldspar is solid-<br>
	solubilized in the crystal lattice of aluminum magnesium<br>
	titanate. Such a sintered product has high heat<br>
25	 resistance and high thermal shock resistance and yet has<br>
	a crystal structure stabilized, as mentioned above, and<br>
	will thus be a wintered product having excellent<br><br>
24<br>
	mechanical strength and high heat decomposition<br>
	resistance.<br>
	(B): Aluminum titanate sintered product<br>
		An aluminum titanate sintered product obtained by<br>
5	firing at from 1,250 to l,700ºC a raw material mixture<br>
	comprising 100 parts by mass of the component X<br>
	comprising TiO2; and A12O3 in a molar ratio of the<br>
	former/the latter being 40 to 60/60 to 40, and from 1 to<br>
	10	 parts by mass of the component y.<br>
10		 The above TiO2 and A12O3 to be used for forming<br>
	aluminum titanate may not necessarily be pure TiO2 and<br>
	A12O3, respectively, and they are not particularly<br>
	limited so long as they are components capable of<br>
	synthesizing aluminum titanate by firing. Such<br>
15	components may usually be suitably selected among those<br>
	to be used as raw materials for various ceramics, such as<br>
	alumina ceramics, titania ceramics and aluminum titanate<br>
	ceramics. For example, a composite oxide, a carbonate, a<br>
	nitrate and a sulfate containing Al and Ti as metal<br>
20	 components may also be used.<br>
		TiO2 and Al2O3 are used in a molar ratio of the<br>
	former/the latter of 40 to 60/60 to 40, preferably 45 to<br>
5	0/55 to 50. Particularly, when the molar ratio of<br>
	Al2O3/TiO2 is 1 or above within the above range, the<br>
25	 eutectic point of the sintered product can be avoided.<br>
	In the present invention, Al2O3 and TiO2 are used as a<br>
	mixture, and they will sometimes be collectively referred<br><br>
25<br>
	to as component X.<br>
		In the case of the honeycomb carrier of the present<br>
	invention, it is necessary to add, in addition to the<br>
	above component X, the component Y as an additive. As<br>
5	 the alkali feldspar which is one member of the component.<br>
	Y, one represented by the empirical formula<br>
	(NayK1-y)AlSi3O8 is used. In the formula, y satisfies<br>
	XXX), preferably O.lXXX), particularly preferably<br>
	0.15XXX)0.85. An alkali feldspar having value y within<br>
10	 this range, has a low melting point and is particularly<br>
	effective for promoting the sintering of aluminum<br>
	titanate.<br>
		As the oxide of a spinel structure containing Mg<br>
	which is another member of component Y, MgAl2O4 or MgTi3O4<br>
15	 may, for example, be used. Such an oxide of a spinel<br>
	structure may be a natural mineral, or a substance<br>
	containing MgO and Al2O3, a substance containing MgO and<br>
	TiO2 or an oxide of a spine1 structure obtained by firing<br>
	such a substance. Further, a mixture of two or more<br>
20	 oxides of different spinel structure may be used.<br>
	Further, the MgO precursor is not limited so long as it<br>
	is capable of synthesizing MgO by firing, and it may, for<br>
	example, be MgCO3, Mg(NO3)2, MgSO4 or a mixture thereof.<br>
		The proportions of the component x and the component<br>
25	 Y are important. Prom 1 to 10 parts by mass of the<br>
	component Y is used per 100 parts by mass of the<br>
	component X. These proportions are proportions as oxides<br><br>
26<br>
	of the components X and Y, respectively, and if a raw;<br>
	material other than an oxide is used, the proportion is<br>
	calculated as an oxide. If the proportion of the<br>
	component Y per 100 parts by mass of the component x is<br>
5	 smaller than 1 part by mass, the effect by addition of<br>
	the component Y will be insufficient to improve<br>
	characteristics of the sintered product. On the other<br>
	hand, if it exceeds 10 parts by mass, the amount of the<br>
	Si or Mg element will be considerably in excess of the<br>
10	 limit of solid-solubilization in the aluminum titanate<br>
	crystals, whereby the excessive added surplus component<br>
	will be present as an oxide by itself in the sintered<br>
	product, which may lead to a significant increase in the<br>
	thermal expansion coefficient. The proportion of the<br>
15	 component Y per 100 parts by mass of the component X is<br>
	particularly preferably from 3 to 7 parts by mass.<br>
		In the present invention, it is preferred to use as<br>
	the component Y a mixture of an alkali feldspar<br>
	represented by the empirical formula (NayK3-y)AlSi3O8, and<br>
20	 an oxide of a spiNel structure containing Mg and/or MgO<br>
	or its precursor, in combination. When such a mixture is<br>
	used, the above synergistic improvement of functions will<br>
	be achieved. In the mixture of an alkali feldspar, and<br>
	an oxide of a spinel structure containing Mg and/or MgO<br>
25	 or its precursor, the mass ratio of the former/the latter<br>
	is preferably 20 to 6O/80 to 40, particularly preferably<br>
35	 to 45/65 to 55. Within the above range, Si/Mg are<br><br>
27<br>
	present in an equimolar ratio, and one of this range,<br>
	eynergistic effects by simultaneous solid-solubilization<br>
	of Si and Mg in aluminum titanate will hardly be obtained.<br>
		In the present invention, in addition to the above<br>
5	 components X and Y, if necessary, other sintering<br>
	assistants may be used, thereby the nature of the<br>
	sintered product thereby obtainable, can be improved. As<br>
	such other sintering assistants, SiO2, ZrO2, Fe2O3, CaO or<br>
	Y2O3, may, far example, be mentioned.<br>
10		 The raw material mixture comprising the components X<br>
	and Y is thoroughly mixed and pulverized. The mixing and<br>
	pulverization of the raw material mixture are not<br>
	particularly limited and can be carried out by known<br>
	methods. For example, they may be carried out by means<br>
15	 of a ball mill, a medium-stirring mill, etc. The<br>
	pulverisation degree of the raw material mixture is not<br>
	particularly limited, but the average particle size is<br>
	preferably at most 30 µm particularly preferably from 8<br>
	to 15 µm. The smaller the average particle size, the<br>
20	 better, so long as it is with in a range where no<br>
	secondary particles will be formed.<br>
		The amounts of molding assistants are not<br>
	particularly limited. However, in the case of the<br>
	present invention, they are preferably within the<br>
25	 following ranges, respectively, as calculated as solid<br>
	contents, per the total content of 100 parts by mass of<br>
	the component X and the component y (as calculated as<br><br>
28<br>
	oxides) to be used as the raw materials. Namely, it is<br>
	preferred to use a binder in an amount of from about 0.2<br>
	to about 0.6 part by mass, a pore-forming agent in an<br>
	amount of from about 20 to about 50 parts by mass, a<br>
5	 release agent in an amount of from about 0.2 to about 0.7<br>
	part by mass, a deforming agent in an amount of from<br>
	about 0.5 to about 1.5 parts by mass and a peptizer in an<br>
	amount of from about 0.5 to about 1.5 parts by mass.<br>
		The raw material mixture having such molding<br>
10	 assistants incorporated, is mixed, Kneaded and<br>
	plasticized so that it is extrusion-pracessable, followed<br>
	by extrusion processing to form a honeycomb body. As the<br>
	method for extrusion, a known method may be used, and the<br>
	cross-sectional shape of each cell of the honeycomb may<br>
15	 be circular, oval, tetragonal or triangular. Further,<br>
	the entire configuration of the honeycomb body may be<br>
	either cylindrical or square tubular. The molded<br>
	honeycomb is preferably dried and then fired at from<br>
	1,250 to 1,700ºC, preferably from 1,300 to l,450ºC. The<br>
20	 firing atmosphere is not particularly limited and is<br>
	preferably an oxygen-containing atmosphere such as in the<br>
	air which is commonly employed. The firing time is not<br>
	particularly limited so long as the firing can be done<br>
	until the aintering proceeds sufficiently, and it is<br>
25	 usually at a level of from 1 to 20 hours.<br>
		Also with respect to the temperature, raising rate or<br>
	the temperature lowering rate at the time of the above<br><br>
29<br>
	firing, there is no particular restriction, and such<br>
	conditions may be suitably set so that no cracks will be<br>
	formed in the obtainable sintered product. For example,<br>
	it is preferred to gradually raise the temperature<br>
5	 without rapid rise of the temperature to sufficiently<br>
	remove moisture, the molding assistants such as a binder,<br>
	etc. contained in the raw material mixture. Further, if<br>
	necessary, prior to heating at the above-mentioned firing<br>
	temperature, presintering may be carried out preferably<br>
10	 within a temperature range of from 500 to l,000ºC for<br>
	from 10 to 30 hours by mild temperature raise, whereby<br>
	the thermal stress in the sintered product during the<br>
	formation of aluminum titanate, can be relaxed, and<br>
	formation of cracks in the sintered product can be<br>
15	 suppressed.<br>
		The sintered product thus obtainable will be<br>
	aluminum titanata formed from the component X wherein the<br>
5	1 component contained in an alkali feldspar and the Mg<br>
	component derived from an oxide of a spinel structure<br>
20	 containing Mg, MgO or a Mg-containing compound which can<br>
	be converted to MgO by firing, as the component Y, are<br>
	solid-solubilized in the crystal lattice of aluminum<br>
	titanate. Such a sintered product has high mechanical<br>
	strength, and a low thermal expansion coefficient and yet<br>
25	 has a crystal structure stabilized, as mentioned above,<br>
	and will thus be a sintered product having excellent<br>
	thermal decomposition resistance.<br><br>
30<br>
	A. honeycomb body made of the above aluminum<br>
	magnesium titanate sintered product (A) or aluminum<br>
	titanate sintered product (B) has a thin wall honeycomb<br>
	structure having a wall thickness of e.g. from 0.05 to<br>
5	 0.6 mm and a cell density of e.g. from 15 to 124<br>
	cells/cm2. And, the porosity of the partition wall is<br>
	e.g. from 20 to 50%, and the thermal expansion<br>
	coefficient is e.g. at most 3.0xl0-6K-1. Such a honeycomb<br>
	body can be usad with stability, at from room temperature<br>
10	 to such a high temperature as above l,600°C as the<br>
	thermal decomposition reaction of aluminum magnesium<br>
	titanate or aluminum titanate is suppressed.<br>
		The honeycomb body is used as a carrier for a<br>
	catalyst to clean various exhaust gases containing<br>
15	 harmful components such as hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide,<br>
	NOx and SOx, particularly an exhaust gas of an automobile<br>
	containing NOx. Particularly, the honeycomb carrier of<br>
	the present invention is stable against an alkali at a<br>
	high temperature, whereby it is effective against an<br>
20	 exhaust gas of an automobile of a system wherein a fuel<br>
	is directly jetted into an engine or of a system wherein<br>
	a fuel is diluted and turned, an exhaust gas from which<br>
	contains NOx at a relatively high concentration.<br>
		As a catalyst supported by the carrier, various<br>
25	 known catalysts may be used such as a conventional so-<br>
	called three way catalyst to remove hydrocarbons and<br>
	carbon monoxide. However, the carrier of the present<br><br>
31<br>
	invention is particularly effective for a catalyst<br>
	containing an alkali metal ox alkaline earth metal<br>
	component to remove NOx in an exhaust gas, The carrier<br>
	of the present invention is effective for a catalyst<br>
5	 containing potassium or barium effective for removal of<br>
	NOx, particularly potassium, amoivg alkali metals and<br>
	alkaline earth metals.<br>
		As a method of making the catalyst be supported by<br>
	the honeycomb body of the present invention, a known<br>
10	 means may be employed. When a catalyst is to be<br>
	supported, a material having a large specific surface<br>
	area, such as alumina or silica, may be interposed, as<br>
	the case requires, so as to improve the supporting ratio-<br>
	That is, alumina or silica may be supported by the<br>
	is honeycomb carrier, and a catalyst is supported fay alumina<br>
	or silica thus supported. The honeycomb body by which a<br>
	catalyst is supported, is preferably set in an can body<br>
	by means of a suitable supporting material.<br>

	further detail with reference to Examples. However, it<br>

THERMAL DECOMPOSITION RESISTANCE TEST<br>
		From the honeycomb carrier in Example 1-1, a test<br>
	specimen of 10 mm x 10 mm x 10 mm was cut out and held in<br>
	a high temperature atmosphere of 1,100°C, whereby the.<br>
5	 change with time of the remaining ratio α (%) of aluminum<br>
	magnesium titanate was investigated to carry out a<br>
	thermal decomposition resistance test.<br>
		Here, the remaining ratio of aluminum magnesium<br>
	titanate was obtained by the following method from the<br>
10	 spectrum of the X-ray diffraction measurement (XRD) ,<br>
		Firstly, as MgAl2O4 (spinel) and TiO2 (rutile) are<br>
	formed when aluminum magnesium titanate undergoes thermal<br>
	decomposition, by using the integrated intensity<br>
	(IT102(110)) of the diffraction peak at the (110) face of<br>
	is rutile and the integrated intensity (IMAT(023)) of the<br>
	diffraction peak at the (023) face of aluminum magnesium<br>
	ticanate, the intensity ratio R of aluminum magriesium<br>
	titanate to rutile was obtained by the following formula:<br>
		R= IMAT(023) / ( IMAT(023) + ( IT102 (110) )<br>
20		 Further, also with respect to the sintered product<br>
	before carrying out the thermal treatment at l,l00°c, the<br>
	intensity Ratio R0 of aluminum magnesium titanate to<br>
	rutile was obtained in the same manner. Then, using R<br>
	and R0 obtained as described above, the remaining ratio α<br>
25	 (%) of aluminum magnesium titanate was obtained by the<br>
	following formula;<br>
		α=(R/R0) x 100<br><br>
37<br>
	With respect to the respective sintered products in<br>
	Example 1-1 and Comparative Example 1-1, the changes with<br>
	time of the remaining ratio a of aluminum magnesium<br>
	titanate are shown by a graph in Fig. 1. AS is evident<br>
5	 from Fig. 1, the sintered product in Example 1-1 is<br>
	superior in the thermal decomposition resistance, as the<br>
	remaining ratio α of aluminum magnesium titanate is<br>
	maintained at a high level over a long time, as compared<br>
	with the sintered product in Comparative Example 1-1.<br>

		The following test was carried out to examine the<br>
	corrosion resistance of the honeycomb bodies against a<br>
	potassium-containing catalyst which is a catalyst for<br>
	removal of NOx in an exhaust gas of an automobile. A<br>
15	 honeycomb carrier against an exhaust gas of an automobile<br>
	is used at a temperature of from room temperature to<br>
	850°C, and the potassium concentration of the potassium-<br>
	Containing catalyse is not so high. However, in this<br>
	test, an accelerated test under severe conditions was<br>
20	 carried out, which comprises dipping a test specimen in<br>

	temperature to 800°C, the thermal shock resistance (°C)<br>
	by an in-water dropping method, the softening temperature<br>
	(°C) and the compression strength (MPa) were measured,<br>
10	and the results are shown in Table 2-1. Here, the<br>
	porosity was measured by a method in accordance with JIS<br>
	Rl634, the thermal expansion coefficient by a method in<br>
	accordance with JIS R1618, the thermal shock resistance<br>
	by a method in accordance with JIS R1648, the softening<br>
15	 temperature by a method in accordance with JIS R2209, and<br>
	the compression strength by a method in accordance with<br>
	JIS R1608. Further, with respect to the compression<br>
	strength, from each honeycomb sintered product, a square<br>
	test apecimen having cross-sectionally 5x5 cells and a<br>
20	 length of 15 mm, was cut out, and this specimen was<br>
	measured from three directions i.e. (A) in the lengthwise<br>

	(tangential) and (C) in the direction inclined by 45°<br>
	from the lengthwise axis {diagonal).<br><br><br><br>
44<br>
		As is evident from Table 2-1, each of the honeycomb<br>
	carriers in Examples 2-1, 2-2 and 2-3 has a compression<br>
	strength sufficient for practical use. The honeycomb<br>
	carrier in Comparative Example 2-1 has low strength<br>
5	 insufficient for practical use, and the honeycomb carrier<br>
	in Comparative Example 2-2 has a low softening<br>
	temperature and is thereby poor in heat resistance.<br>
	THERRMAL DECOMPOSITION RESISTANCE TEST<br>
		From each of the honeycomb carriers in Examples 2-1<br>
10	 and 2-2 and Comparative Example 2-1, a test specimen of<br>
10	 mm x lo mm x 10 mm was cut out and held in a high<br>
	temperature atmosphere of 1,000°C whereby the change<br>
	with time of the remaining ratio β(%) of aluminum<br>
	titanate was investigated to carry out a thermal<br>
	AS decomposition resistance test.<br>
		Here, the remaining ratio of aluminum titan-ate was<br>
	obtained by the following method from the specturm of the<br>
	X-ray diffraction measurement (XRD).<br>
		Firstly, as Al2O3 (corundum] and TiO2 {rutile} are<br>
20	 formed when alutninum titanate undergoes thermal<br>
	decomposition ueirng the integrated intensity (IT120 (110))<br>
	of the diffraction peak at the (110) face of rutile and<br>
	the integrated intensity (IAT(023)) of the diffraction peak<br>
	at the (023) face of aluminum titanate, the intensity<br>
25	 ratio r of aluiminum titanate to rutile was obtained by<br>
	the following formula:<br><br><br>
45<br>
		Further, also with respect to the sintered product<br>
	before carrying out the thermal treatment at 1,000°C, the<br>
	intensity ratio r0 of aluminum, titanate to rutile was<br>
	obtained in the same manner. Then, using r and rc<br>
5	 obtained as described above, the remaining ratio β(%) of<br>
	aluminum titanate was obtained by the following formula:<br>
		β= (r/ro) x 100<br>
		With respect to the respective honeycomb shape<br>
	sintered products in Examples 2-1 and 2-2 and Comparative<br>
10	 Example 2-1, the changes with time of the remaining ratio<br>
	β of aluminum titanate are shown by a graph in Fig, 2,<br>
	As is evident from. Fig, 2, Examples 2-1 and 2-2 are<br>
	supperior in the thermal decomposition resistance, as the<br>
	remaining ratio is maintained at a high level over a long<br>
	is time, as compared with Comparative Example 2-1. Further,<br>
	it is evident that while the remaining ratio in Example<br>
	2-1 after expiration of 100 hours in Fig. 2 is slightly-<br>
	low, the remaining ratio in Example 2-2 is still remained<br>
	at a high level and thus shown that the thermal<br>

	ALKALI RESISTANCE TEST WITH RESPECT TO HONEYCOME BODIES<br>
		The following test was carried out to examine the<br>

	honeycomb carrier against an exhaust gas of an automobile<br><br>
45<br>
	is used at a temperature of from room temperature to<br>
	850oC, and the potassium concentration of the potaseium-<br>
