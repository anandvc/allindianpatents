Method and base station system for configuration of a radio interface between a mobile station and a base station in a time-division multiplex mobile radio system for packet data transmission<br>
Connection-oriented concepts and concepts based on logic links may be used to transmit data between two communications terminals. In the case of connection-oriented data transmissions, physical resources must be provided between the two communications terminals throughout the entire time for data transmission.<br>
Permanent provision of physical resources is unnecessary for data transmission via logical links. One example of such data transmission is packet data transmission. In this case, a logic link exists between the two communications terminals throughout the entire duration of data transmission, but physical resources are provided only during the actual transmission times for the data packets. This method is based on the fact that the data are transmitted in short data packets, between which relatively long pauses may occur. In the pauses between the data packets, the physical resources are available for other logic links. A logic link results in a saving of physical resources.<br>
The packet data transmission method known from German Patent Specification DE 44 02 930 Al can be used in particular for communications systems with limited physical resources. For example, in mobile radio systems such as the GSM mobile radio system (Global System for Mobile Communications), the physical resources in the frequency band - number of frequency channels and time slot - are limited and must be used economically.<br>
The GSM mobile radio system is one example of a time-division multiplex mobile radio system, in which time slots within a frequency channel can be split between different communications terminals. The radio station at the network end of a mobile radio network is<br><br>
     -2-<br>
a base station, which communicates with mobile stations via a radio interface. Transmission from a mobile station to the base station is called the uplink direction and transmission from the base station to a mobile station is called the downlink direction. A channel, which is reserved for packet data transmission, is formed by at least one time slot per time-division multiplex frame. Furthermore, the channel is defined by the carrier frequency and any frequency jump sequence.<br>
The GSM mobile radio system was originally conceived for voice transmission, and one channel was reserved for continuous information transmission between the mobile station and the base station. However, for packet data transmission, a common channel is used for packet data transmission for a plurality of mobile stations. In addition to the packet data, signalling information is also transmitted, for which a time slot is provided at cyclic intervals within the channel.<br>
The distinction between logic links and physical connections also means that, although a logic link exists for a mobile station, no packet data are transmitted over a certain time interval. However, as long as there is no transmission from the mobile station to the base station, it is impossible for the base station to carry out any measurements relating to the transmission conditions from the mobile station. Previously calculated values lose their validity and must be redefined during renewed allocation of physical channels, or the base station must ensure that the transmission conditions are set in such a manner that reliable transmission is possible in every case. The latter leads, for example, to an excessive, or even maximum, transmission power setting.<br>
In consequence, the invention is based on the object of specifying a method and a base station system for configuration of a radio interface for packet data transmission, in which the time delay for passing through a configured radio interface between a mobile station and a base station is reduced. This object is achieved by the method with the features of Patent Claim 1 and by the<br><br>
                        -3-<br>
base station system with the features of Patent Claim 9. Advantageous developments of the invention can be found in the dependent claims.<br>
A method according to the invention for configuration of the radio interface combines a plurality of time slots for signalling within the channel for packet data transmission to form a signalling block. In this case, the time slots need not belong to immediately successive frames. Such a signalling block is particularly important for the downlink direction since it contains information for configuration of the radio interface for the mobile station, for example the transmission level and the timing advance. The combination of time slots to form a signalling block results in the time duration to completion of the signalling block at the receiving end being minimal. The mobile stations are, in consequence, quickly supplied with the information required for configuration of the radio interface. Signalling to the plurality of mobile stations is possible via one signalling block.<br>
The combination of the configuration data in a message saves transmission capacity, which is now available for adjacent cell measurements or other signalling information.<br>
The allocation is advantageously independent of packet data transmission from or to the mobile station. As a result of this fixed allocation of a time slot for signalling even to mobile stations to which no physical channel is currently allocated, the base station can carry out continuous measurements with regard to the radio interface. When packet data transmission resumes, immediately valid measurements are therefore available for configuration of the radio interface.<br>
According to an advantageous refinement of the invention, a plurality of successive time slots for packet data transmission in the channel are also combined to form a packet data block. Since information from a plurality of time slots first forms a packet data block, it is possible to interleave the information of a packet data  block  and  to  simplify  reconstruction  of  the<br><br>
                               -4-<br>
information. The interleaving can also be applied to the signalling data.<br>
The configuration data for a mobile station can in this case be transmitted together with the configuration data for other mobile stations in a single time slot for signalling in the downlink direction, in this case advantageously being repeated or being provided with a coding or error detection, or in a plurality of non-successive time slots for signalling being transmitted. In the latter case, the interleaving provides error protection. It is possible to set the time slots which are combined to form such a signalling block. In the case of such use, for example, of every other time slot for signalling, the time slots in between can be used for adjacent cell measurements.<br>
The proportion of time slots for adjacent cell measurements can be further increased if less configuration data are transmitted (for example only the timing advance) or only a small number of mobile stations need to be supplied. In this case, cyclic adaptation of the combination sequence may be provided. Such adaptation improves the matching of the signalling complexity to the actual requirements of the mobile stations for packet data transmissions.<br>
According to the invention, a closed control loop for the timing advance can be achieved since time slots for signalling are allocated to mobile stations in the uplink direction, and signalling blocks for the mobile stations arrive, with a short time delay, in the downlink direction. Advantageously, only the mobile station and the base station are involved in this control loop. Since, in contrast to packet data transmission, no specific arrangement is required between a mobile station and a data block for this signalling (this is normally carried out in a base station controller) , the base station can set the timing advance on its own. In this case, there is no signalling complexity between the base station and the base station controller.<br>
The configuration of the timing advance and the<br><br>
	- 5 -<br>
transmission power setting are carried out independently of one another, according to a further refinement of the invention. The timing advance is defined by a closed control loop between the mobile station and the base station, it being possible to provide a longer cycle between two definitions by suitable selection of the time slots for signalling. Since the motion of the mobile station is relatively slow in comparison with the signal propagation speed, the timing advance need be defined only at intervals of several seconds.<br>
In the process of defining the transmission power setting for the base station, the transmission power is advantageously matched to the mobile station having the poorest transmission conditions on the common channel. To this end, open or closed control loops can be set up independently of the definition of the timing advance. If there are major differences between the transmission powers required for the individual mobile stations and if a plurality of common channels are available, it is advantageous to allocate the mobile stations to the channels on the basis of the transmission power required.<br>
Packet data transmission is advantageously carried out in both transmission directions, that is to say in the uplink direction and the downlink direc-tion, independently of one another. In consequence, a mobile station can transmit data in the uplink direction, or can receive data from the network in the downlink direction. Packet data transmission in both directions can also be provided for a mobile station. The separation into the uplink and downlink directions allows great flexibility in the use of the radio resources and, of course, also in the design of the mobile stations, which possibly only transmit or receive.<br>
According to a further advantageous refinement, in addition to the designations within the mobile radio system for packet data transmission, the mobile stations are designated by abbreviated identifiers. One or more time slots for signalling in the uplink direction are allocated, via the time slots for signalling in the<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
downlink direction, to the mobile stations by means of indicator messages containing abbreviated identifiers and time slot designations. The abbreviated identifiers allow improved resource utilization between the network and the mobile stations via the radio interface, since they are independent of addresses, that are known in the network, for the mobile stations.<br>
A self-contained message is advantageously transmitted to the base station from a mobile station within a time slot for signalling. This self-contained message contains, for example, received values (RXLEV, RXQUAL) from the mobile station for signals from the base station, which makes it possible for the base station transmission power to bet set immediately for packet data transmission in the downlink direction. Since one closed message is transmitted per time slot, this reduces the time required before the mobile station reception level is available at the base station, and reduces the time for configuration of the radio interface. The base station uses transmissions for signalling in the uplink direction to define the timing advance and the reception level at the base stations with regard to the respective mobile station.<br>
The value and control value, or values and control values, defined for the timing advance and the transmission power are transmitted to the mobile station in the downlink direction, which then also allows it to make the necessary settings for configuration of the radio interface.<br>
The configuration process is further speeded up if the definition of the timing advance and/or of the reception level of the base station is also carried out from the time slots for packet data transmission. The setting time for the configuration process can also be influenced by the allocation of abbreviated identifiers to mobile stations. If, for example, a plurality of abbreviated identifiers are allocated to one mobile station, the setting time is shortened. It is likewise possible to keep the delay times short by appropriate<br><br>
	- 7 -<br>
choice of specific abbreviated identifiers at the end of a macroframe. Limiting the number of abbreviated identifiers also leads to a capability to reuse a time slot for signalling for a mobile station more quickly, and to a shortening of the delay time. The number of abbreviated identifiers is advantageously set to correspond to the transmission conditions and to the number of mobile stations provided for the packet data service.<br>
If a plurality of time slots for signalling in the downlink direction are combined to form a signalling block, then the signalling advantageously takes place simultaneously for a plurality of mobile stations. However, the signalling in the downlink direction can likewise take place within packet data, so that, for example, the transmission power setting can be adapted continuously, without using time slots for signalling, and additional time slots are available for adjacent cell measurement.<br>
The choice of specific transmission block types also allows the signalling complexity to be reduced. If normal transmission blocks (normal bursts) are used, in contrast to so-called access levels, it is possible to define the reception power by averaging over a relatively large number of bits, as a result of which the measurement accuracy rises and a smaller number of repeated measurements is required for transmission power setting. Such relatively long transmission blocks are advantageously used for transmission power setting when timing advance values that are already valid are available.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in the following text with reference to exemplary embodi-ments and using/drawing illustrations, in which: FIG 1   shows a block diagram of a time-division multiplex mobile radio system for packet data transmission, FIG 2   shows  a  time-division  multiplex  frequency<br>
channel,<br>
FIG 3   shows the time slots in a channel for packet data transmission, and<br><br>
	- 8 -<br>
Tables  1,  2 and 3 show the use of time slots for<br>
signalling.<br>
The time-division multiplex mobile radio system according to FIG 1 is, for example, a GSM mobile radio network GSM, which contains at least one base station system BSS with a control device BSC and base station BS. Mobile stations MS are located in the radio zone of an illustrated base station BS. The base station system BSS provides the link to other devices in the GSM mobile radio network GSM. The control device BSC may be implemented in a base station controller, in the base station BS or as an autonomous unit.<br>
These other devices are, for example, a mobile switching centre MSC and a unit for providing inter-working functions IWF. The interaction of the mobile switching centre MSC and interworking functions IWF results in a packet switching centre, which is also called a GSN (GPRS support node). This packet switching centre is connected to an MSC for voice switching or, alternatively, it could be implemented as a remote, dedicated unit.<br>
The GSM mobile radio network GSM can be connected to other communications networks. For example, another communications terminal KEG can be connected to the GSM mobile radio network, or may itself be part of this GSM mobile radio network GSM.<br>
The GSM mobile radio network GSM is intended to be used for packet data transmission in parallel with the known voice transmission. In this case, the device for providing interworking functions IWF can provide the coupling of the GSM mobile radio network GSM to data transmission networks, and thus to the other communications terminal KEG.<br>
The radio interface between the mobile stations MS and a base station BS is characterized by a frequency and at least one time slot ts. According to Fig. 2, for example, eight time slots ts (tsO to ts7) are combined to form a frame R. The frame R is repeated cyclically, a recurring time slot, for example the time slot ts = ts4,<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
belonging to one channel. From hereon, this time slot ts is used as the channel GPRS-K for packet data transmission for the purposes of the GPRS (General Packet Radio Services) service.<br>
If a mobile station MS wishes to use this service, it then carries out a random access in accordance with the GSM terminology using a short so-called access burst, and changes to a dedicated control channel. This is followed by authentication and setting of the context with regard to a logic link (standby state). If the other communications terminal KEG wishes to communicate with a mobile station MS via the packet data service, paging and the described random access are carried out at the network end.<br>
For the situation in which the mobile station MS wishes to transmit or receive data packets (ready state), a further random access takes place if a logic link exists. In this case, the mobile station MS is also allocated an abbreviated identifier id and the corresponding GPRS channel GPRS-K. The timing advance ta and the reception level pb in the base station BS are then defined at the network end. At this point, the mobile station MS is assigned four successive time slots T as a packet data block TCH in the uplink direction. If required, details relating to transmission power monitoring are also transmitted.<br>
The packet data transmission and the associated signalling will now be described with reference to FIG 3 and Tables 1 and 2.<br>
Four time slots T for packet data transmission are in each case combined to form a packet data block TCH. Three such packet data blocks TCH and one time slot A, I for signalling are repeated four times to form a macroframe, which comprises 52 frames R. This applies to both the uplink direction and the downlink direction. Furthermore, two such macroframes in turn form a higher-order frame. One macroframe has a duration of 240 ms.<br>
The information in a packet data block TCH is interlinked with four time slots T. The allocation of<br><br>
	- 10 -<br>
packet data blocks TCH to different mobile stations MS is carried out in a flexible manner, in the uplink and downlink directions, to one or more mobile stations MS. This allows different data rates to be used. Decisions relating to access to the GPRS channel between the mobile stations MS can be made on the basis of priority allocations. The uplink direction and the downlink direction are considered separately in the following text, a mobile station MS always being able to communicate in both directions. The allocation of packet data blocks TCH while a logic link exists is carried out in band, that is to say, within the packet data blocks TCH, indicator messages are used to indicate to the mobile stations MS who may use the following packet data blocks TCH.<br>
In the downlink direction, not only are four successive time slots T for packet data transmissions interleaved, but the signalling information which forms a signalling block GACCH is also interleaved. In this case, according to Fig- 3, every other time slot A for signalling is combined to form the signalling block GACCH, while the intermediate time slots I are used for measurements relating to mobile stations MS in adjacent cells. The time slots A, I for signalling and adjacent channel measurement may also be in a different sequence, for example, A/I = 1/3. The base station BS switches between the sequences on the basis of the transmission conditions.<br>
The adjacent cell measurements are used to determine which base stations BS can be selected in the event of a deterioration in the transmission conditions on the currently allocated channel. The mobile station contains a priority list based on these measurements.<br>
A signalling block GACCH in this case contains information for a plurality of mobile stations MS, see Table 1 and Table 2 in this context. Alternatively, -Table 3 - it is possible to reduce the number of time slots per signalling block GACCH and, in addition to or as an alternative to interleaving, to transmit the configuration data (timing advance TA and/or transmission<br><br>
	- 11 -<br>
power setting PC) more than once in a time slot and/or to provide it with further protection, for example by coding.<br>
The method according to the invention is particularly advantageous if the timing advance is defined only once and is signalled as indicated below. The transmission power determination is carried out independently of this. Such separation of the determination of the two configuration data items TA, PC provides greater flexibility for the configuration of the radio interface. However, for simplicity, the following text assumes that an identical control loop is used for defining the timing advance TA and the transmission power setting PC.<br>
For example, the 6ACCH block contains the values for the timing advance TA and the transmission power setting PC (for example the reception level pb of the base station BS or the required transmission power) for the mobile stations 1 to 4. In this case, the time period before the timing advance TA and the transmission power values PC are repeated is thus 480 ms. If signalling takes place for only two mobile stations, for example two mobile stations which are transmitting in the uplink direction, the number of abbreviated identifiers id can be reduced to two, and the delay time is now 240 ms.<br>
In the uplink direction, the time slots A for signalling are allocated as follows. According to Table 1, the time slots A0 to Al are allocated for the mobile stations 1 to 2 in the uplink direction (abbreviated identifiers id 0 to 1), and the time slots A2 to A3 are allocated for the mobile stations MS 2 to MS 3 in the downlink direction (abbreviated identifiers id 2 to id3) . If the mobile stations MS are communicating in both the uplink and downlink directions, then the time slots A for signalling are allocated in accordance with Table 2.<br>
If the allocation is carried out according to Table 1, that is to say the uplink direction and downlink direction are considered separately, each mobile station MS transmits a specially coded access burst to the base station BS,  in the time slot A allocated to it for<br><br>
	- 12 -<br>
signalling. In this process, it signals the field strength and quality (RXLEV, RXQUAL) with which the signalling blocks GACCH from the base station BS have been received in the downlink direction. The base station BS measures the transmissions (time slots A allocated for signalling) from the mobile station MS in order to define a timing advance TA and a transmission power, or the transmission power change PC for the mobile station MS/ and signals this to the mobile station MS. The mobile station MS thus receives values which it uses when packet data blocks TCH are transmitted in the uplink direction.<br>
The base station BS uses the reception level pm reported by the mobile station MS to set a reasonable transmission power when, subsequently, packet data blocks TCH are transmitted to the mobile station MS for data transmission in the downlink direction. The delay times for the current values of the timing advances TA and transmission power values in the uplink direction are as follows: The mobile station MS receives new values at an interval of 480 ms. With regard to the sequence of the time slots I, A, it should be noted that the time between signalling in the uplink direction by a mobile station MS and a transmission provided for this mobile station MS in the downlink direction is short.<br>
According to Table 3, the signalling in the downlink direction has been designed such that each mobile station 1 to 4 has been assigned an individual time slot A for signalling, in which the timing advance TA is transmitted with additional error protection. The fewer the number of mobile stations which are using the common channel GPRS-K, the fewer is the number of such time slots A that are required for signalling and the greater is the number of time slots I that are available for adjacent cell measurements, for additional signalling (for example link clearing, frequency changing) or else for additional data transmission.<br>
The exemplary embodiments can be modified such that abbreviated identifiers id are used in such a manner that the abbreviated identifiers id 1 and 3 are used by<br><br>
	- 13 -<br>
preference. In this case, the delay times are close to the best case of 240 ms. The interval between the arrival of new values is also reduced if the abbreviated identifiers id are used twice. If the number of abbreviated identifiers is further limited, then the delay time is also shortened. If non-updated values are acceptable for relatively long times, then the number of abbreviated identifiers id can also be increased in steps of four to 8, 12, 16 etc.<br>
The allocation of abbreviated identifiers id is matched, in particular, to the transmission conditions, that is to say to the previously recorded changes in the timing advance TA and transmission power changes. The number of mobile stations MS which wish to use packet data transmission via the GPRS channel GPRS-K is also taken into account.<br>
As a result of the fixed allocation of time slots A for signalling in the uplink direction, the base station BS is continuously informed of the current transmission conditions for the radio interface, and can configure the radio interface accordingly. A closed control loop exists for mobile stations MS which signal in such a manner in the uplink direction and to which the values for the timing advance TA and for the transmission power setting PC are transmitted in the downlink direction via the signalling blocks GACCH. The control loop is also feasible when the mobile station MS is not currently transmitting or receiving packet data.<br>
However, if the mobile station MS is also allocated packet data blocks TCH in the uplink or downlink directions, values for the timing advance TA or the reception level pb can also be calculated and transmitted for this purpose.<br>
Packet-oriented transmission of information via the radio interface is particularly suitable for telematics applications, fax and file transmission, point of sales implementations, fleet management and traffic management systems.<br><br>
