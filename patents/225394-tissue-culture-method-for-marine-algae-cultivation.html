				<td>AN IMPROVED PROCESS FOR CULTIVATION OF ALGAE<br>
FILED OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for cultivation of marine algae. This<br>
invention pertains to the field of macrophytic multicellular marine algae (seaweeds) and<br>
more particularly to the mariculture of seaweeds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Seaweeds are considered as an important source of phycocolloids such as agar, carrageenan<br>
and alginate. Agar and carrageenan are structural polysaccharides present in the cell walls of<br>
certain red algae, while alginate is derived from certain brown algae. Seaweed<br>
phycocolloids are widely used in various industries as emulsifying agents, gelling agents,<br>
stabilizers, thickeners and suspension agents, and thus regarded as value-added products of<br>
seaweeds. Traditionally, phycocolloids are extracted from the raw materials harvested from<br>
natural resources. However, the increasing utilisation of seaweeds coupled with the<br>
unavailability of sufficient raw material hi nature eventually led to successful development of<br>
different efficient cultivation techniques as well as domestication and selection of strains.<br>
PRIOR ART REFERENCES<br>
J.R. Waaland (Proc. of the Intl. Seaweed Symp. 9, 241 - 247, 1979) in his studies attempted<br>
to select fast growing strains in Gigartina exasparata by comparing the growth rate of wild<br>
plants collected from different populations in experimental tank cultures. Subsequently,<br>
many strains with superior potential for growth and phycocolloid yield have been selected<br>
from wild populations ofChondnts crispus, Gracilaria tikvahiae, Gracilaria verucosa, etc.<br>
(D.P Cheney etal, Proc. of the Intl. Seaweed Symp. 10, 559 - 567, 1981; J.H. Ryther et<br>
al, Proc. of the Intl. Seaweed Symp. 9, 1 -16, 1979; I. Levy and M. Friedlander, Botanica<br>
Marina, 33, 339 - 345, 1990). The main drawback associated with these strains is lack of<br>
predictability of performance as the selection is based on a specific environmental condition<br>
and thus, optimal performance is intimately related to the culture conditions under which<br>
selection was performed. Moreover, such selection, even if successful, yield typically only<br>
incremental benefits.<br>
G.C. Trono, (Seaweed Cultivation and Marine Ranching, M. Ohno and A.T. Critchley,<br>
(eds.), JICA Publication, Japan, 75 - 88, 1993) has described the taxonomy and cultivation<br>
of Eucheuma and Kappaphycus, and stated that growers do make a crude selection under<br>
the field farm conditions by screening and selecting the best plants from the harvest and use<br>
such plants as a source material for replanting for the next crop. The main drawback of<br>
cultivating such strains is inconsistency in crop yield due to lack of adaptability to seasonal<br>
changes in farming conditions.<br>
C. J Dawes and E.W. Koch (J. Appl Phycology, 3, 247-257, 1991) and C. J. Dawes, G. C.<br>
Trono and A. O. Lluisma (Hydrobiologia, 260/261, 379 - 383, 1993) made attempts to<br>
develop suitable methods for maintenance and propagation of selected clones of different<br>
cultivated varieties of Eucheuma through micro-propagation and tissue culture. Their<br>
studies laid more emphasis on establishment of suitable laboratory culture techniques for<br>
clonal propagation of farmed Eucheuma using tiny vegetative fragments. The main<br>
drawback of such propagation using micro-cuttings is that the progeny will possess only<br>
parental features and does not have a pronounced advantage over the parental populations<br>
in expression of desired traits.<br>
D.P. Cheney, Wang and Le Zhong in U.S. Patent No. 5, 585, 544, 1996 demonstrated a<br>
method of causing somatic cell hybridization between Eucheuma cottonii and E. spinosum<br>
by growing somatic algal tissue from each of the two species in very close proximity, in a<br>
nutrient solution, and isolated hybrid somatic shoots with more desirable end product<br>
features. The main limitation of somatic cell hybridization in algae is that so far it has not<br>
been successful in introducing new traits in offspring except transferring some existing traits<br>
from either one of the parent.<br>
Several articles have been published on commercial farming and processing of Kappaphycus<br>
and Eucheuma ( J. R. Lim and H. Porse, Proc. of the Intl. Seaweed Symp. 10, 601 - 606,<br>
1981; H. Adnan and H. Porse, Hydrobiologia, 151/152, 355-358, 1987; R. Azanza-<br>
Corrales and P. Sa-a, Hydrobiologia, 204/205, 521 - 525, 1990; G. P.B. Samonte, A.Q.<br>
Hurtado-Ponce and R. Caturao, Aquaculture, 110, 1 - 11, 1993). G.C. Trono (Seaweed<br>
Cultivation and Marine Ranching, M. Ohno and A.T. Critchley (eds.), JICA Publication,<br>
Japan, 75 - 88, 1993) has described two types of cultivation methods such as fixed offbottom<br>
mono-line method and floating raft or long line method which are followed<br>
universally for cultivation of Eucheuma. In both the methods, selected Eucheuma apical<br>
cuttings (50 -100 g) with profuse branches are tied to cultivation ropes at 25 - 30 cm<br>
intervals using soft plastic tying material (in Philippines known as tie-tie method) and<br>
allowed to grow to one kilogram or more before they are harvested. The crop is harvested<br>
after every 60 - 90 days duration depending on the growth rate. There are several<br>
limitations and drawbacks in common for both mono-line method and floating raft or long<br>
line method. They are, (i) the propagules/seed material are directly subjected to grazers<br>
which may eat away the entire material and thus, adversely affect the subsequent crop<br>
production, (ii) as the plantings are unprotected, there will be incidences of wash off<br>
material from cultivation ropes due to unfavourable sea conditions, (iii) epiphytes and<br>
settlement of foreign particles during unfavourable sea conditions may require cumbersome<br>
and time-consuming cleaning of the seaweed to ensure desired quality of the end product.<br>
O.P. Mairh etal. (Indian J, Marine Sciences, 24, 24-31, 1995) successfully demonstrated<br>
the feasibility of bag cultivation of Eucheuma striatum on experimental scale in field<br>
conditions. However, the main drawback of this method is that this resulted in decrease in<br>
their daily growth rate as compared to those grown in open waters without polythene bags.<br>
The present invention overcomes the deficiency of attenuated growth in the bag by<br>
developing a rapidly growing strain from the conventional seaweed through in vitro tissue<br>
culture techniques which exhibits more or less the same growth potential in the bag as the<br>
parent plant does in the open waters.<br>
Figure 8 shows the comparative growth of the control parent plant and the tissue culture<br>
plant derived therefrom.<br>

In another embodiment, the harvesting period of at least 60 days can yield a higher biomass<br>
or wherein the biomass yield can be maintained constant and the cultivation period reduced.<br>
The present invention provides a method of an improved process for cultivation of algae<br>
which comprises a method of development of fast growing variant of farmed Eucheuma<br>
progeny through tissue culture which overcomes the deficiency of attenuated growth in the<br>
bag, wherein the axenic viable seaweed material for tissue culture is established by<br>
sequentially treating the selected plant material in 0.1 - 1 % domestic liquid detergent (5 -<br>
20 min), 0.1-2% povidine iodine (0.5% weight/volume available iodine) for 2 - 7 min and<br>
finally in PES medium with 1 - 5 % antibiotic mixture (penicillin G - Ig, streptomycin<br>
sulphate - 2g, kanamycin - Ig, nystatin - 25 mg and neomycin - 200 mg in 100 ml distilled<br>
water) for 24 - 96 hours and axenic explants (1 - 6 mm long cuttings preferably from distal<br>
parts of the plant) of Eucheuma cultured on the agar plates (0.8 - 3 % agar) fortified with<br>
PES medium at 20 - 25 °C under cool white fluorescent lights at 20 - 50 u mol photon m"2<br>
s"1 irradiance with a 12 : 12 light and dark cycle showed induction of callus which on<br>
subculture without explant provided darkly pigmented oval or spherical shaped micropropagules,<br>
whose production is further enhanced by growing thin slices of pigmented<br>
callus (2 mm x 3 mm x 2 mm) as embedded cultures hi 3mm thick agar plates (0.3 - 0.6%<br>
agar) made hi PES medium, however, addition of plant growth regulators particularly 0.1 -<br>
1.0 mg I*1 of naphthalenacetic acid or 0.1 mg I"1 each of naphthalenacetic acid and 6-<br>
benzylaminopurine to agar medium further enhanced the process of formation of somatic<br>
embryogenesis and micro-propagule production in pigmented filamentous callus, and<br>
transfer of such callus mass with somatic embryos to the liquid PES medium hi agitated<br>
condition facilitated morphogenesis and development of young plantlets from propagules,<br>
which are in field cultivation exhibited superior growth with greater than two-fold increase<br>
in biomass over the control parent plant without compromising on the yield and quality of<br>
carrageenan derived from the seaweed, and also demonstrates a modified floating long line<br>
cultivation method wherein Euchewna apical cuttings (preferably with branches) of 100 g<br>
fresh weight are grown inside a closed transparent polythene bag (450 guage; 60 cm x 45<br>
cm) with perforations of 4 mm diameter holes hi 3 rows (each with 12 numbers of holes<br>
equidistantly placed) at 14 cm intervals on both sides, in the sea yielded a biomass of 1590<br>
37.4 g. fresh weight (4.6 % daily growth rate) for tissue culture progeny and 846.66 ±<br>
37.9 g. fresh weight (3.5 % daily growth rate) for control parent plant hi 60 days growth<br>
period.<br>
In an embodiment, the methodology for preparing axenic viable plant material for tissue<br>
culture is established by sequentially treating the selected plant material in 0.1 - 1 %<br>
domestic liquid detergent (5 -20 min), 0.1 - 2% povidine iodine (0.5% weight/volume<br>
available iodine) for 2 - 7 min and finally in PES medium with 1 -5 % antibiotic mixture<br>
(penicillin G - Ig, streptomycin sulphate - 2g, kanamycin - Ig, nystatin - 25 mg and<br>
neomycin - 200 mg hi 100 ml distilled water) for 24 - 96 h. The axenity of the material as<br>
treated above is confirmed by transferring onto Zobell 2216E agar plates for two weeks at<br>
22 - 23 °C in an incubator.<br>
In another embodiment, development of fast growing variants of farmed Euchewna<br>
through tissue culture. Callus induction has been found viable in axenic explants grown<br>
aseptically on agar plates (0.8 - 3.0% agar) fortified with Provasoli enriched seawater (PES)<br>
medium at 20 - 25° C under cool white fluorescent lights at 20 - 50 p. mol photon m"2 s"1<br>
irradiance with a 12 : 12 light and dark cycle. After 40 days, the proliferated callus is<br>
excised from the explant and subcultured separately on fresh agar medium as above. Some<br>
of the subcultured calli on an agar plates, after 40 days growth, differentiated and<br>
produced densely pigmented spherical or oval shaped micropropagules ( 2 - 5 mm in<br>
diameter) which on transfer to liquid PES medium developed into young plantlets of<br>
Eucheuma. The repeated testing of many cloned plants in the field cultivation consistently<br>
showed that a sizable fraction (&gt;90 %) of the plants not only survive but also exhibit<br>
enhanced growth over the control parent plants.<br>
In yet another embodiment, in vitro clonal production and propagation of micro-propagules<br>
through somatic embryogenesis of pigmented calli cells is demonstrated. For enhancing the<br>
production of micro-propagules, the subcultured pigmented calli is cut into several thin<br>
blocks (2 mm x 3 mm x 2 mm) and grown as embedded cultures inside the agar plates (0. 3<br>
0.6%) at 20- 25 °C under cool white fluorescent lights at 20 - 50 p mol photon m"2 s"1<br>
irradiance with a 12 : 12 light and dark cycle. From each embedded block, profuse growth<br>
of branched filamentous pigmented. callus is seen in first three weeks duration and thereafter<br>
regeneration of densely pigmented micro-colonies similar to somatic embryos hi dark brown<br>
colour on branches of some filaments is observed. Transfer of such filamentous callus with<br>
somatic embryos to liquid enriched seawater medium (PES) facilitated rapid growth and<br>
morphogenesis in micro-propagules.<br>
In still another embodiment, the process of formation of somatic embryos in pigmented<br>
filamentous callus is further enhanced by addition of plant growth regulators particularly<br>
0.1 - 1.0 mg I"1 of naphthalenacetic acid or 0.1 mg I"1 each of naphthalenacetic acid and 6-<br>
benzylaminopurine to an agar medium.<br>
In still another embodiment,the initial plantings, preferably apical cuttings with profuse<br>
branches, of about 100 g fresh weight are enclosed in perforated transparent polythene<br>
bags (450 gauge; 60 cm x 45 cm) and grown by attaching the bags to floating long lines in<br>
the sea. The cuttings are grown as above in protective bags round the year and the crop was<br>
harvested at every 60 -75 days period. The cuttings are grown to a biomass of 394.6 ±<br>
20.8 g. fresh weight (4.7 % daily growth rate) in 30 days, 846.66 ± 37.9 g. fresh weight<br>
(3.5 % daily growth rate) over a period of 60 days cultivation.<br>
In still another embodiment, a comparative yield potential of fast growing strains developed<br>
in the present invention and control parent plant in the field conditions is carried out by<br>
following the bag cultivation method. The fast growing variant yielded a fresh biomass of<br>
1590  37 g. (4.6 % daily growth rate) whereas the control parent plant yielded 846 38<br>
g. (3.6 % daily growth rate) as against 1726 g. (4.7 % daily growth rate) obtained for<br>
open waters ones hi 60 days cultivation period.<br>
Inventive techniques are described below in detail for an unproved process for<br>
cultivation of algae including development of a fast growing variant from tissue culture,<br>
mass production and propagation of micropropagules (seed stock) through somatic<br>
embryogenesis and a modified cultivation method for growing marine macroalgae. The<br>
desired algal organism should be photosynthetic and tolerant to various marine habitat<br>
conditions. Algae suitable for use with the invention are non-filamentous and anatomically<br>
complex thallophytic red (Rhodophyta) and brown (Phaeophyta) marine algae which have<br>
cartilaginous thallus with erect or prostrate habit and consist of cylindrical or compressed<br>
branches and form large biomass. Suitable algae may be chosen from the red algae<br>
preferably from the order of Gigartinales. Within the order of Gigartinales preferred<br>
genera are the genus of Eucheuma, e.g., E. striatwn, E. cottonii, E. denticulatom, E.<br>
spinosum, E. alvarezii and E. procrusteamm; the genus ofGigartina, e.g., G. intermedia,<br>
G. exasparata; and the genus ofChondrus, e.g., C. crispus. Suitable genera of Phaeophyta<br>
are Laminaria, Undaria, Ecklonia, Eisenia, Macrocystis, Sargassum and Turbinaria.<br>
For obtaining axenic material, selected plant material is sequentially treated in autoclaved<br>
filtered seawater (sterilised seawater) with 0.1 -1 % domestic liquid detergent (5-20 min),<br>
0.1 - 2% povidine iodine (0.5% weight/volume available iodine) for 2 - 7 min and finally in<br>
PES medium with 1 - 5 % antibiotic mixture (penicillin G - Ig, streptomycin sulphate - 2g,<br>
kanamycin - Ig, nystatin - 25 mg and neomycin - 200 mg in 100 ml distilled water) for 24 -<br>
96 h at 20 - 25° C under cool-white fluorescent lamps at 25 - 30 p mol photon m"2 s"1<br>
irradiance with a 12:12 light : dark cycle. However, the plant material treated with 0.1%<br>
liquid detergent, followed by 1% povidine iodine and 3% of broad-spectrum antibiotics<br>
for two days become contaminant free and did not show any bacterial growth on Zobell<br>
medium even after three weeks of culture.<br>
After establishing the procedure for obtaining axenic material, the explants (5 mm long<br>
cuttings preferably from distal parts of the plant) ofEuchetana cultured aseptically on an<br>
agar plates (0.8-3 % agar) fortified with PES medium for about a month at 20 - 25°C<br>
under cool white fluorescent lights at 20 - 50 u mol photon m"2 s"1 irradiance with a 12 :<br>
12 light and dark cycle. The callus induction was observed during first two weeks of<br>
culture. After 40 days, the proliferated filamentous branched callus excised from the<br>
explants and subcultured separately on fresh agar plates under similar conditions, except<br>
light which was increased to 50 p mol photon m"2 s"1 irradiance, to induce morphogenesis<br>
and differentiation in callus. Some of the subcultured calli after about 40 - 50 days culture<br>
on agar plates did undergo morphogenesis and produced densely pigmented spherical or<br>
oval shaped micropropagules ( 2 - 5 mm in diameter) which on transfer to liquid PES<br>
medium developed into young plantlets of Eucheuma. The field viability and growth<br>
performance of these plants was tested repeatedly by transferring to experimental field<br>
cultivation site at Thoniturai (Gulf of Mannar, India). All the plants tested as above in the<br>
field consistently showed low mortality, with several of the plants exhibiting more than twofold<br>
increase in fresh weight over control parent plants, over the same duration of<br>
cultivation. This trend has continued with negligible variation even for the third generation<br>
seaweed.<br>
The production of micro-propagules clonally through somatic embryogenesis of pigmented<br>
callus has been established. The somatic embryogenesis and micro-propagule production<br>
may further be enhanced by subculturing thin section of pigmented filamentous callus blocks<br>
(2 mm x 3 mm x 2 mm) in 3 mm thick agar plates (0.3 - 0.6% agar) with PES medium as<br>
embedded cultures. The callus blocks implanted in an agar medium grew rapidly in one<br>
month and formed colored spots in an agar with abundantly growing branched filamentous<br>
pigmented callus. The newly regenerated filamentous callus from blocks eventually<br>
transformed to produce densely pigmented (dark brown colour) micro-colonies similar to<br>
somatic embryos in branches of some filaments. Addition of plant growth regulators<br>
particularly 0.1 - 1 mg I"1 of naphthalenacetic acid or 0.1 mg I"1 each of naphthalenacetic<br>
acid and 6-benzylaminopurine to an agar medium further enhanced the formation of somatic<br>
embryogenesis. Transfer of such filamentous callus with somatic embryos from solid (agar<br>
plates) medium to liquid PES medium facilitated rapid growth and morphogenesis in micropropagules.<br>
In the present invention, the selected Eucheuma cuttings, preferably with branches, as seed<br>
material, are grown completely in closed protective bags, more preferably transparent ones<br>
with perforations (4mm diameter), which allow light penetration and seawater circulation<br>
needed for their sustainable growth while at the same time excluding the possibility of being<br>
grazed and settlement of foreign particles. The surface of the bags, on which however<br>
foreign matter settles, were cleaned weekly or whenever it is required. During the<br>
cultivation period, the annual seawater temperature ranged from 22.5°C - 28.5°C, pH from<br>
7.81 - 8.26, salinity from 24.0 %o - 34.0 %o, dissolved oxygen from 7.84 ml/1  15.68 ml/1,<br>
phosphate from 0.02 y mol - 3.23 \i mol, nitrate from 0.15 ji mol - 2.58 ja mol and nitrite<br>
from 0.01 p mol - 0.85 ji mol in farm site. A yield of 1590 ± 37.4 g. fresh weight was<br>
harvested after 60 days period from tissue culture raised plants, 846.6 ± 37.9 g. fresh<br>
weight from control parent plant starting with initial seed material of 100 g. fresh weight.<br>
The present invention reveals for the first time development of fast growing strains under in<br>
vitro conditions as well as a method of producing micro-propagules clonally on large scale<br>
through somatic embryogenesis of pigmented callus of anatomically complex thaJlophytic<br>
red alga. The earlier studies on tissue culture of seaweeds demonstrated the regeneration of<br>
entire plants de novo by transferring the callus to liquid medium. But in the present<br>
invention for the first time succeeded in producing somatic embryos like pigmented microcolonies<br>
consisting of cells from as little as three to several hundred on agar plate itself. We<br>
found that the pigmented micro-colonies on agar plates under dim light conditions can<br>
ideally be preserved live for extended periods till needed. The daily growth of field grown<br>
plants raised from tissue culture have, in several cases, exhibited more than 40% increase<br>
over the control plants under similar conditions, At the end of 60 days, this translates to a<br>
two-fold bcrease hi biomass over control which is more or less similar to that obtained for<br>
open waters. The semi-refined carrageenan yield from dry tissue culture raised plants is 43<br>
% and gel strength is 540 g. cm "2 while for the control parent plant s the yield is 43 % and<br>
gel strength of the carrageenan is 550 g. cm "2. The inventive steps adopted in the present<br>
invention are (i) development of a methodology for obtaining a clean and axenic plant<br>
material for tissue culture, (ii) development of fast growing variants, with two-fold increase<br>
in growth without change in carrageenan yield and quality, through micro-propagules of<br>
pigmented callus, (iii) in vitro clonal propagation of micro-propagules through somatic<br>
embryogenesis of pigmented callus by growing as embedded cultures inside the agar plates,<br>
(iv) stimulation of process of formation of somatic embryos in pigmented callus using plant<br>
growth regulators such as naphthalenacetic acid and 6-benzylaminopurine and (v)<br>
cultivation of algae in an enclosed transparent plastic bags with perforations, which prevents<br>
grazing and provides pure raw material, free of contaminants likely to affect adversely the<br>
final processed product.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be<br>
construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
More specifically, the improved cultivation process includes the methodology for<br>
development of a clone with an improved trait, i.e., faster growth, through tissue culture<br>
and cultivation by long line floating method using a transparent polythene bag with small<br>
perforations, which prevents grazing and provides pure raw material, free of contaminants<br>
which are likely to affect adversely the final processed product kappa carrageenan (Kcarrageenan).<br>
The main usage(s)/ utility of the improved cultivation method includes the following: (i)<br>
methodology for development of soma clones with an improved trait, i.e., faster growth,<br>
through tissue culture, (ii) \n vitro clonal propagation of seaweeds through somatic<br>
embryogenesis of callus cells, (iii) production and supply of uniform seed stock<br>
(micropropagules) on large scale through in vitro somatic embryogenesis of callus culture<br>
for practical farming of seaweeds, (iv) exploitation of the callus as a source for long term<br>
storage of germplasm, and (v) cultivation in a transparent polythene bag with small<br>
perforations, which prevents grazing and provides pure raw material, free of contaminants<br>
detrimental to the processed product, K-carrageenan.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation of Axenic explants : To develop an axenic, viable and unialgal material for<br>
tissue culture, selective fragments (just below the apical portions with 4-5mm diameter<br>
stem) of about 5cm length were chosen from the thallus of Euchewna striatum (=<br>
Kappaphycus alvarezii) collected from the cultivation farm. Prior to initiation of<br>
experiments, the plants were acclimatized to laboratory conditions by growing in PES<br>
enriched seawater medium in aerated flasks under cool-white fluorescent lamps at 20 |i mol<br>
photon m*2 s"1 irradiance with a 12:12 light : dark cycle for ten days. During the<br>
acclimatization period the media in the flasks was replenished twice at five day period. After<br>
acclimatization, first, the fragments were extensively cleaned with a brush under microscope<br>
in an autoclaved filtered seawater (sterilised seawater) to remove any surface contaminants<br>
and subsequently treated in sequence in sterilised seawater with 0.1% domestic liquid<br>
detergent for 10 min, 1% povidine iodine (available iodine 0.5% w/v) for 2 min and finally<br>
incubated in PES medium supplemented with 3% of filter sterilised broad-spectrum<br>
antibiotic mixture (penicillin G —Ig, streptomycin sulphate - 2g, kanamycin - Ig, nystatin <br>
25 mg and neomycin - 200 nig in 100 ml distilled water) for 48 hours at 23°C under coolwhite<br>
fluorescent lamps, at 25 \i mol photon m"2 s*1 irradiance with a 12:12 light: dark cycle.<br>
At each step, prior to proceeding to successive treatment, the algal pieces were rinsed with<br>
sterilised seawater to avoid cross contamination of chemicals. All the above operations,<br>
except the incubation of material in antibiotics, were performed on a Bioclean bench. The<br>
plant materials as treated above become contaminant free and did not show any microbial<br>
growth on Zobell agar plate even after two weeks of period.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Callus induction in axenic explants: Callus induction was carried out in axenic materials<br>
obtained by following the method described in Example 1. First, the plant material to be<br>
used for callus induction was thoroughly cleaned with sterilised seawater to remove any<br>
traces of antibiotics, and cut into 5 mm length explants and blotted with sterile filter papers<br>
to remove moisture as well as mucilage that exude from the cut ends which might some<br>
times become a source of microbial contamination even after a month of explant culture. All<br>
the explants were grown on 1.5% agar plates prepared with PES medium for about a month<br>
at 23°C under cool white fluorescent lights at 25\i mol photon m"2 s"1 irradiance with a<br>
12:12 light and dark cycle. The callus induction was observed during the first two weeks of<br>
culture. After 50 days, the proliferated filamentous branched callus (Fig.l) was excised from<br>
the plants and subcultured separately on fresh agar plates under similar conditions, except<br>
light which was increased to" 50)4. mol photon m'2 s'1 irradiance, to enhance the growth of<br>
callus. Some of the subcultured calli (Fig.2) after 50 days of culture on agar plates did<br>
undergo morphogenesis and produced densely pigmented spherical or oval shaped<br>
micropropagules (Fig.3) of 2-5 mm diameter all over the callus. Further, culture of these<br>
propagules separately in liquid PES medium hi agitation conditions grew into young<br>
propagules (Fig.4) which eventually developed into young plantlets with multiple shoots<br>
(Fig. 5) within 3 weeks duration.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Somatic embryogenesis and clonal propagation: The production of micro-propagules<br>
clonally through somatic embryogenesis of pigmented callus ofEucheuma has been carried<br>
out. The somatic embryogenesis and micro-propagule production may be enhanced by<br>
subculturing thin section of pigmented filamentous callus blocks (2 mm x 3 mm x 2 mm) in<br>
3 mm thick agar plates (0.4% agar) with PES medium as embedded cultures at 23°C under<br>
cool white fluorescent lights at 50u mol photon m*2 s"1 irradiance with a 12 : 12 light and<br>
dark cycle. The callus blocks implanted in an agar medium grew rapidly in one month and<br>
formed colored spots in an agar with abundantly growing branched pigmented filamentous<br>
callus. The newly regenerated filamentous callus from blocks eventually transformed to<br>
produce densely pigmented (dark brown colour) micro-colonies similar to somatic embryos<br>
(Fig.6) on branches of some pigmented filamentous callus.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Enhancement of somatic embryogenesis by plant growth regulators: The process of<br>
production of micro-propagules in pigmented filamentous callus ofEucheuma was further<br>
enhanced by supplementing the growth medium with plant growth regulators such as<br>
naphthalenacetic acid (auxin) and 6-benzylaminopurine (cytokinin). Thin slices of pigmented<br>
callus blocks (2 mm x 3 mm x 2 mm) were grown as embedded cultures in 3mm thick agar<br>
plates (0.4% agar) made in of PES medium supplemented with 0.1, 1.0 mg I*1 of<br>
naphthalenacetic acid, or with 0.1 mg I*1 each of naphthalenacetic acid and ii 6-<br>
benzylaminopurine. All the Petri dishes with embedded callus were maintained at 23°C<br>
under cool white fluorescent lights at 50|i mol photon m"2 s"1 irradiance with a 12:12 light<br>
and dark cycle. The callus blocks implanted in an agar medium grew rapidly in one month<br>
and formed dense pigmented micro-colonies similar to somatic embryos in an agar medium.<br>
Transfer of such pigmented callus mass from solid (agar plates) medium to liquid PES<br>
medium facilitated rapid growth and morphogenesis hi micro-propagules. For achieving the<br>
rapid morphogenesis of micro-propagules, agitated culture was preferred.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Cultivation ofEuceuma by floating long line method: At the beginning, the yield data of<br>
cultivated Euchewna by traditional floating long line method in open waters was<br>
established. In this method, selected Eucheuma cuttings, preferably apical ones with profuse<br>
branching, of about lOOg fresh weight, as initial seed material for planting, were tied in ten<br>
replicates directly at 30cm intervals to a polypropylene rope (8mm diameter and 30 meter<br>
length) which hung between two bamboo poles (about 5 m length) fixed at the bottom. The<br>
bamboo poles are arranged hi rows at 1 m intervals with the same distance to form plots.<br>
The distance of rope from the ground is about O.S meter during low tide and 1.0-1.5 meter<br>
during high tide. The growth of plants was determined by weighing the individual fresh<br>
plants at 30 days interval and daily growth rate was calculated using the formula: r = (Wt /<br>
W,,) -1 x 100, where r stands for daily growth rate in percent, Wt is the wet weight at day<br>
t, W0 is the initial wet weight. The meari biomass and daily growth rate, over 30 days were<br>
450 g. fresh weight and 7.3% respectively, and for 60 days were 1726 g. fresh weight and<br>
4.7% respectively for plants grown in open waters.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Cultivation of Eucheuma in polythene bags by floating long line method: In this<br>
method, selected Eucheuma cuttings, preferably apical ones with profuse branching, of<br>
about 100 g fresh weight as initial seed material for planting were grown inside closed<br>
transparent polythene bags (450 guage; 60 cm x 45 cm) with perforations (for sea water<br>
circulation) in ten replicates till harvest. Leaving 18 cm from the open end of the bag,<br>
perforations were made on both the sides, with 4 mm diameter holes in 3 rows (each with<br>
12 numbers of holes equidistantly placed) at 14 cm intervals. Thus each bag consisted of 72<br>
holes taking both sides together (i.e., 36 holes on one side). The bags were sewn with nylon<br>
thread and attached to the floating rope (Fig.7). In total fifty bags at about 10 cm intervals<br>
are tied to one rope as above. The crop was harvested after 60 days and weighed for<br>
calculating the growth rate by using formula described in Example 5.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Comparative study of growth, carrageenan yield and gel properties of tissue culture<br>
progeny and control plants: A comparative study on growth (Fig. 8), carrageenan (semirefined)<br>
yield on dry seaweed weight basis, and carrageenan gel strength of field grown<br>
plants raised from tissue culture progeny and control parent plants was carried out. Both<br>
type of plants were grown in 10 replicates in closed transparent polythene bags by floating<br>
long line method as described earlier in Example 6. An average biomass of 394.58 ± 20.8 g.<br>
fresh weight (4.7% daily growth rate) was obtained for 30 days and 846.6 ± 38 g. fresh<br>
weight (3.5% daily growth rate) for 60 days, while tissue culture plants had 711.6 + 13 g.<br>
fresh weight (6.8% daily growth rate) for 30 days and 1590 ± 37 g. fresh weight 4.6% daily<br>
growth rate) for 60 days period. Semi-refined carrageenan content was obtained by first<br>
cooking the 10 g of pre-cleaned seaweed in 200 ml of 8% KOH solution for 1.5 h,<br>
decanting the filtrate, neutralizing the residual material, and washed with distilled water.<br>
Following the washing in water, the material is dried thoroughly at 40°C and weighted to<br>
estimate yield. Gel strength was measured with gel strength tester (Nikkansui, Co. Japan)<br>
by preparing a gel of 1% carrageenan by boiling in 1% KC1 solution. The yield for the<br>
control parent plant as also for the plants grown from macropropagules were comparable at<br>
43% on dry seaweed basis. The corresponding gel strengths were 550 gem'2 and 540 gem*2,<br>
respectively.<br>
