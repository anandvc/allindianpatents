The invention relates to a piston arrangement, with which, for example, a metering valve, a flow-rate sensor, or a hydraulic motor can be implemented.<br>
For such applications, it is frequently necessary. in the first place, to provide a metering piston, which is suitable for conducting a defined quantity of fluid, and a reversing piston, which creates the back-and-forth movement of the metering piston. In particular, for the use of such a piston arrangement for lubricating devices, which are operated partially at vers' low-temperatures, e.g., at -40°C. a piston arrangement should not only be as simple and compact in construction as possible, but also have long-term operating reliability.<br>
These requirements are satisfied by the piston arrangement according to the invention, which has a housing, in which at least one cylindrical hollow space is formed, in which a first piston is mounted in a sealed and displaceable manner and in which a cylindrical hollow space is formed at least in some regions, and a second piston, which is mounted displaceably in the cylindrical hollow space of the first piston. Here, it is intended that a valve seat is formed in the first piston, against which the second piston with a sealing surface can be pressed in such a way that the second piston can be displaced in the first piston between a position which opens a flow passage through the first piston and a position which shuts off a flow passage through the first piston. The first piston thus acts as a metering piston, through whose displacement a defined quantity of fluid, in particular, a lubricant, can be fed or metered. The second piston, in contrast. acts together with other components, for example, a spring or the like, as a reversing piston, which can change the pressure acting on the first piston through targeted opening and/or closing and thus can create a reversal of the direction of movement of the first piston. Because the two pistons are arranged one inside the other, it is possible to keep the dimensions of the piston arrangement according to the invention especially compact. Furthermore, this simple assembly of the piston arrangement keeps the amount of maintenance low and the reliability of the piston arrangement high.<br>
Advantageously, an elastic element, in particular, a plate-spring package or a compression spring, is assigned to the second piston in such a way that the second piston is pressurized in the direction of its position which opens a flow passage through the first piston. Through the force of the spring, etc.. initial])- a flow of fluid through the first piston is allow'ed. wherein the fluid flow can be shut off. for example. by a stop of the second piston on a stop surface and/or due to the fluid pressure.<br><br>
A free-moving seal between the first and the second valve, which also achieves a good sealing effect, can be realized such that the valve seat and the sealing surface have a conical shape. In addition, the seal can be improved in such a way that the valve seat and/or the sealing surface is provided with a sealing element, for example, a sealing ring.<br>
If the second piston has a cylindrical outer surface, whose diameter approximately corresponds to the inner diameter of the cylindrical hollow space of the first piston, according to the invention, helical, curved grooves can be provided on the outer surface of the second piston, so that a fluid can flow in these grooves between the first and second pistons.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention. the piston arrangement is a component of the metering valve, in which, as an injector piston in the housing, the first piston defines two chambers, which can be brought into flow connection with each other or sealed against each other by displacement of the second piston. Here, the surface of the first and second piston facing the first chamber is smaller than the surface of the first piston facing the second chamber and, if applicable, elements connected to this piston. Through this surface difference, it is possible to control the movement of the piston arrangement, in that fluid initially flows through the piston arrangement, so that the pistons are then moved opposite the flow direction of the fluid due to the larger effective surface in the second chamber. In contrast, if the second piston seals off the flow through the first piston, then the pistons are moved in the opposite direction, i.e.. in the flow direction of the fluid. The change-over between the individual metering phases is thus realized by the movement of the two pistons. Due to the second piston. which is integrated in the injector piston and which acts as a control valve, and due to the surface difference of the injector piston, it is possible to form the entire metering \'a!ve ver}' compactly'.<br>
For a metering valve (injector) according to the invention, the housing advantageously forms an injector body, which can be connected to a manifold and which has a first opening for connecting the first chamber to a supply line in the manifold and an outlet opening that can be closed, in particular, by means of a relief valve and that is connected, in turn, to a connection provided in the manifold. If several metering valves are provided on such a manifold, the outlets of each injector are located on the manifold. If repair to or the replacement of an injector should be necessar}'. then only the attachment screws, etc.. of the given injector need be loosened and removed. The solid piping on the manifold and also the manifold itself here remain mounted, so that the system is very maintenance-friendly. Manifolds can also be realized, on which several injectors are located. Here, only the dimensions of the manifold and the number of connection boreholes are different. Unused injector sites can be closed, for example, with blind plugs.<br>
In the housing, on the side of the second chamber, an injector closure screw can be screwed in. in which, in turn, an adjustment element is screwed in. for example, with a screw. wherein, is applicable, an indicator pin connected to the first piston is guided in a movable wax.<br><br>
The stroke of the injector piston and thus, for example, the metering grease quantity is limited by the stop on the injector closure screw. For example, if a smaller grease amount is needed, then a threaded pin in the adjustment element can be continuously adjusted, so that an indicator pin connected to the first piston stops mechanically and thus limits the piston stroke. Here, it is theoretically also possible to adjust the zero feed point for the metering valve according to the invention.<br>
It is preferred that the second chamber be connected to the surroundings of the housing via an opening that can be sealed by means of a closure screw. Through such lateral openings, for example, several injectors can be connected one under the other, by means of which the output quantity per stroke and lubricating position can be increased, without using injectors, with greater maximum output quantity.<br>
For the functioning of the injector piston, the two chambers should be sealed against each other, wherein the resulting intermediate space is pressurized by a pressure-relief line with lower pressure than the pressure in the main line. This can be realized in that the first and the second chambers are sealed against each other by means of the first piston, wherein, in this sealing region of the first piston, an opening is provided in the housing, which is in flow connection with the outlet opening or with the surroundings of the housing.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, the piston arrangement is a component of a flow-rate sensor, wherein the housing has an inlet opening and an outlet opening, between which the first piston is arranged, for connection in a fluid line. Between the inlet opening and the first piston, a first chamber is formed, and between the outlet opening and the first piston, a second chamber is formed, which are in connection with each other or separated from each other as a function of the position of the second piston. Through the second piston, which forms a control valve, the first piston used as a sensor piston can be set in an oscillating motion together with a compression spring for pressurizing the inlet opening. This can be detected by means of a sensor and can be transmitted to a controller and evaluated. The flow-rate sensor according to the invention is here shaped in an especialh' space-saving and reliable wa&gt;In a flow-rate sensor, preferably a compression spring, which is supported on the first piston or a component connected to this piston and which loads the second piston in the direction of its position connecting the two chambers, is assigned to the second piston. Together with the fluid force, this simplifies the opening of the passage between the first and second piston.<br>
Furthermore, according to the invention in such a flow-rate sensor between the outlet opening and the first piston, another compression spring is provided which pressurizes the first piston in the direction toward the inlet opening. This compression spring is designed in such a way that the first piston can move in the direction toward the outlet opening against the force of this other compression spring due to the fluid pressure for a closed second piston. If the second<br><br>
piston then abuts against a corresponding surface of the outlet opening with a stop, then the second piston is also opened by the force of the compression spring acting on this piston, so that fluid can flow from the inlet opening through the piston arrangement to the outlet opening. In this state, the other compression spring presses the first piston back in the direction toward the inlet opening, wherein the passage opening in the piston arrangement closes again. Thus a detectable oscillating movement of the piston arrangement is produced.<br>
The measurement of the flow rate therefore can be realized by a simple means, such that on or in the first piston, for example, a magnet, in particular, a ring magnet, is provided, wherein on or in the housing there is a sensor, in particular, a Hall sensor, for detecting the position and/or the movement of the magnet or the like. In this way, it is possible to detect whether fluid is flowing through the flow-rate sensor. For a known volume flowing through the flow-rate sensor for a stroke of the piston arrangement according to the invention, the flow rate can also be determined. The Hall sensor, etc.. can be provided on a circuit board, which also carries function LEDs and connection cables. Advantageously, the circuit board is encapsulated and fixed on the housing of the flow-rate sensor.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the piston arrangement is a component of a hydraulic motor. Here, the first piston can be formed, as for a metering xalve (injector), as a differential piston with a surface difference and extended outwardly. In addition, it is possible to form the piston as for a flow-rate sensor with a restoring spring, but without a magnet. With this outward extension, for example, a pump element or the like can be controlled.<br>
Other goals, features, advantages, and possible applications of the invention emerge from the following description of embodiments and the drawing. Here, all of the described and/or graphically illustrated features themselves or in an}' combination form the subject matter of the invention, independently of their summarx' in the claims or references to them.<br>

The metering valves or injectors show-n in Figures 1 to 4 each consist of an injector bod&gt; or housing 4. wherein, in the shown embodiment, three injector bodies 4 are mounted on a common manifold 9 each with two cylinder head screws 10. The seal between the injector bodies<br><br>
4 and the manifold 9 is realized by means of 0-rings. as is visible from the section view of Figures 3 and 4. The assembly of the complete manifold, which consists of the manifold and the injectors, can be realized, for example, by means of two attachment boreholes located in the manifold 9.<br>
The supply of lubricant to the distributor unit is realized by a feed line 16. which is formed as a passage borehole in the manifold 9 with lateral connection threads for threaded connections for connecting the pump line or additional manifolds. In addition, the outlets of the individual injectors are fed back into the manifold 9 and can be connected by means of straight (or angled) threaded connections 12 to lubricant lines, which lead, for example, to a bearing point.<br>
Each individual injector (metering valve) is made from the injector body 4 (housing), in which a first piston is located as the injector piston 8 with mounted parts. An injector closure screw 3 closes the injector on the top side in Figures 1 and 3 and represents a stroke limitation for the injector piston assembly. In the injector closure screw 3, an adjustment element 1 is screwed in, by means of which the dosed quantity can be influenced. For visual inspection of the injector function, a view window, in which a indicator pin 2 is to be seen that is connected to the first piston 8 and moves up and down with this piston during a lubricant cycle, is formed in the adjustment element.<br>
The injector piston 8 defines, in the injector body 4. a first chamber 14. which faces the manifold 9. and a second chamber 15 turned away from this manifold. Here, the first chamber 14 is in flow connection with the supply line 16. The second chamber 15 is provided with a lateral output, which is closed in the shown embodiment with a closure screw 11. As can be seen from the illustration of Figure 4. an outlet borehole 17. through which a lubricant is led to the threaded connection 12 in the manifold 9. branches away from the second chamber 15. In the connection borehole 1 7. a relief valve 13. which consists of a ball, a spring, and a spring holder, is provided in the shown embodiment.<br>
In the injector piston 8. a second piston 7 fomiing a control \'alve is guided so that it can move. The lower end of the injector piston 8 in Figure 3 is provided with a conical \alve seat 1 8. while the lower end of the second piston 7 has a corresponding conical sealing surface 19 with a sealing ring. A cylindrical outer surface area of the second piston 7 is provided with a helical, curved groove, so that fluid can flow between the outer surface of the second piston 7 and the similarly cylindrical inner surface of the first piston 8 when the sealing surface 19 is raised from the valve seat 18.<br>
Between an injector piston screw^ 5 closing the first piston 8 to the second chamber 15 and the second piston 7, a helical compression spring 6 is mounted in tension, which applies a force on the second piston 7 in its opened position. Instead of the helical compression spring, a<br><br>
Belleville spring stack can also be provided. As can be seen from the diagram of Figure 3. the common surface of the first piston 8 and the second piston 7. which faces the first chamber 14. is smaller than the surface facing the second chamber 15 for the injector piston screw 5 of the first piston 8.<br>
In the following, the function of the metering valve according to the invention will be explained in more detail. The charge phase begins when, in the no-pressure state, the control valve 7 (second piston) is opened by the spring force of the helical compression spring 6 in the injector piston 8 (first piston). If grease is pumped into the first chamber 14 of the injector as lubricant through the supply line 16 with a grease gun. for example, then the grease flows past the opened control valve 7 through the helical, curved groove and thus reaches the second chamber 15 through the injector piston 8. From this chamber, the grease flows further into the outlet borehole 17 up to the next closed relief valve 13. For further grease deliver&gt;' into the injector, the internal pressure increases, wherein, through the surface differences on the injector piston 8, this is shifted downward in Figure 3 due to the resulting force. In this phase, the second chamber 15 is filled with grease. Here, for the downward movement of the injector piston 8. the control valve 7 is closed by the mechanical stop on the borehole base in the injector bod}' 4 (housing). The diagram of Figure 3 shows the end of the charge phase, in which the control vahe 7 is again closed.<br>
In the subsequent dosing phase, the pressure increases in the first chamber 14 and in relation to this also in the second chamber 15. when the grease gun delivers additional grease or the like into the injector. Here, if the pressure set at the relief valve 13 is exceeded in the second chamber 14 and thus also in the outlet borehole 17. then this opens and the injector piston 8 can be pressed upward in Figure 3 by the pressure in the first chamber 14. The grease in the second chamber 15 is here delivered through the outlet borehole 17 past the relief valve 13 to a bearing point or the like.<br>
Through the stop on the injector closure screw 3. the stroke of the injector piston 8 and thus the dosed lubricant quantity is limited. If a smaller quantity of grease is needed, then an adjustment screw can be adjusted continuously in the adjustment element 1. so that the indicator pin 2. which is connected to the injector piston 8. is mechanically stopped and in this wa&gt; limits the piston stroke.<br>
The discharge phase follows the dosing phase, in order to start a new lubricant cycle with a charge phase. Here, the pressure in the supph' line 16 must drop below- the dimensioned discharge pressure of advantageously approximatelv 90 bar. When the pressure drops below the discharge pressure, the control valve 7 is opened by the force of the compression spring 6. The available pressure from the supply line 16 in the first chamber 14 immediately decreases in the second chamber 15 and causes a small downward movement of the injector piston 8. The<br><br>
discharge speed of the main line is increased by the piston stroke during the discharge, because grease is removed from the supply line 16 during this piston stroke. By removing grease, the residual pressure in the main line drops abruptly, which is very important particularly for the use of an injector at very low temperatures of approximately -40°C for example. Only when the pressure falls below the discharge pressure can another lubricant cycle take place. The faster this discharge pressure is reached, the quicker a new lubricant cycle can take place.<br>
To increase the possible maximum output quantity of the injector, only the length of the injector body and that of the injector piston has to be increased. Consequently, a new design of the springs in use is not needed. Alternatively, it is also possible to connect several injectors one below the other by means of the lateral outputs provided with the closure screws 11. In this way. the output quantity per stroke and lubricant position can be increased, without having to use injectors with a greater maximum output quantity.<br>
The assembly and the function of a flow-rate sensor 20 according to the invention will now be described with reference to Figures 5 and 6. The flow-rate sensor 20 has an inlet opening 21a that can be integrated into a fluid line and an outlet opening 21b that can also be integrated into a fluid line. The inlet opening 21a and the outlet opening 21b close a tube-like sensor housing 22 and are sealed relative to this bj' means of 0-rings. The inlet opening 21a and the outlet opening 21b are provided with internal threads, so that a straight threaded connection can be mounted in these openings. In the sensor housing 22. a first piston 23 (sensor piston) is guided in a movable way. so that two chambers are defined in the housing 22 by the sensor piston 23 between the inlet opening 21 a and the outlet opening 21 b.<br>
In the sensor piston 23. a second piston 24 (sensor control ^'ale) is guided in a movable way. wherein a conical valve seat and a corresponding sealing surface are formed in the sensor piston 23 and the sensor control valve 24 as described above. Furthermore, the c}iindrical outer surface of the second piston 24 is provided with a helical, curved groove, so that fluid can flop&gt; through this groove between the first and second pistons.<br>
The second piston 24 receives a force from a conical compression spring 25. which is supported on a ring magnet 26 held in the sensor piston 23. in the direction of its open position on the left in Figure 5. Furthemiore. a compression spring 27 is provided between the sensor piston 23 and the outlet opening 21b. which applies a force on the sensor piston 23 toward the left also in Figure 5. An encapsulated circuit board with a Hall sensor 28. function LEDs. and a connection cable is located on the sensor housing 22.<br>
The flow-rate sensor can be installed, for example, in the grease supply line of a lubrication point, in order to monitor the grease supph. In the rest position, the spring 27 presses the sensor piston assembly in Figure 5 to the left in the direction of the inlet opening 21a until the sensor control valve 24 is closed by mechanical stop on the inlet opening 21 a.<br><br>
If grease or a fluid flows through the inlet opening 21 a into the chamber on the left in the figure, then at first a pressure builds up in this chamber. If the pressure in this chamber rises so high that the resulting force acting on the sensor piston 23 is greater than the force acting on the outlet side, then the sensor piston assembly in Figure 5 moves to the right in the direction of the outlet opening 21b. According to a defined piston path, the sensor control valve 24 (second piston) stops on a stop surface of the outlet opening 21b. Here, the sensor control valve 24 is opened by lifting the sealing surface from the valve seat, by means of which the inlet opening 21a is in flow connection with the outlet opening 21b.<br>
Grease or the like flows in this position from the inlet opening 21a through the piston to the outlet opening 21b. so that the pressure difference in the chambers breaks down. The force of the compression spring 27 now restores the piston arrangement to the position shown in Figure 5. Here, the sealing surface of the sensor control valve 24 is again pressed against the valve seat of the sensor piston 23, by which means the flow^ passage between the inlet opening 21a and the outlet opening 21b is shut off.<br>
Flow through the flow-rate sensor according to the invention thereby causes an oscillating motion of the sensor piston 23 and the ring magnet 26 connected to this in the sensor housing 22. The movement of the magnetic field can be detected by the Hall sensor 28 and sent to a controller for evaluation. The switching of the Hall sensor 28 can be displayed visually by means of an LED. Another LED can give information on the operating state of the flow-rate sensor. In this way. it is possible, with the detected signal, to determine the run times or the output volume per unit time through a grease supph line.<br>
In Figure 7, a relief valve 13' with a sealing part 29 made from. e.g.. PUR with a support disk 30 and a spring 31, is shown as an alternative to the relief \'alve 13 shown in Figure 4. Here, a clamping sleeve 32 is used for limiting the stroke and protecting the spring 31 from overloading, because the block length 31 is not reached.<br><br>
