METHOD FOR PREPARING METAL DIHYDROXYBENZENEDI SULFONATES<br>
The  subject matter  of the present	invention  is  a<br>
process    for    the    preparation	of    metal<br>
dihydroxybenzenedisulfonates from	corresponding<br>
dihydroxybenzenedisulfonic acids.<br>
The invention is targeted more particularly at alkali metal salts, preferably the sodium or potassium salts.<br>
The salts of dihydroxybenzenedisulfonic acids, in particular sodium 1,2-dihydroxy-3,5-benzenedisulfonate monohydrate, have applications in many fields, in particular that of photography, of water treatment and of detergency.<br>
The preparation of metal dihydroxybenzenedisulfonates, in particular the sodium salts, is described in the literature.<br>
Thus, according to US 3 772 379, it is known to prepare said salts according to a process which comprises the following stages:<br>
-	dissolution of the dihydroxybenzene (diphenol) in sulfuric acid;<br>
-	addition of fuming sulfuric acid, resulting in a highly acidic medium, the amount of sulfuric acid being sufficient to produce said disulfonate;<br>
-	heating the medium at between approximately 60'C and 90 Â°C;<br>
-	diluting the reaction medium by addition of water;<br>
-	reaction of said medium with an alkali metal hydroxide, the amount of alkali metal hydroxide being sufficient to produce the alkali metal dihydroxybenzenedisulfonate in the precipitated form;<br>
-	heating the medium in order to hydrolyze any sulfuric ester.<br><br>
Similarly, the sulfonation of the dihydroxybenzene can be carried out using oleum.<br>
In the sulfonation process, the sulfuric acid is always employed in an excess amount and it is therefore important to recover it.<br>
In point of fact, in the process described, an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide, in particular sodium hydroxide, solution is involved in carrying out the salification of the dihydroxybenzenedisulfonic acid.<br>
After separation of the sodium dihydroxybenzene-disulfonate by filtration, a filtrate (mother liquors) is obtained which comprises recoverable sulfuric acid but which occurs diluted as a result of sodium hydroxide being supplied in the form of an aqueous solution and as a result of the salification reaction with sodium hydroxide resulting in the forination of water.<br>
Similarly, US 3 547 988 describes that the salification is carried out using an alkali metal base or ammonium base and that alkali metal hydroxides are preferred.<br>
In order to overcome these disadvantages, the present invention provides a process which makes it possible to more easily regenerate the mother liquors comprising sulfuric acid resulting from the separation of the metal dihydroxybenzenedisulfonate.<br>
The subject matter of the present invention is a process for the preparation of a metal dihydroxybenzenedisulfonate from a corresponding dihydroxybenzenedisulfonic acid, characterized in that it comprises the reaction of the dihydroxybenzenedisulfonic acid, present in a sulfuric<br><br>
medium, with a sufficient amount of a salt comprising a sulfate or hydrogen sulfate anion.<br>
According to a preferred alternative embodiment of the process of the invention, the salification operation according to the invention is carried out on the reaction medium resulting from the preliminary sulfonation stage.<br>
It has been found that it is possible to prepare the salts of the dihydroxybenzenedisulfonic acid by salification of the dihydroxybenzenedisulfonic acid using a metal sulfate or hydrogen sulfate, preferably sodium or potassium sulfate or hydrogen sulfate, without detrimentally affecting the quality of the final compound.<br>
The use of a salification agent of sulfate or hydrogen sulfate type does not release water during the salification reaction.<br>
Thus, without, however, relating the scope of the invention to the reaction mechanisms, the process of the invention is illustrated by the following reactions, applied to the preferred substrares of the invention:<br><br><br>
This type of salification, which is a neutralization of the two sulfonic acid functional groups by a sulfate or hydrogen sulfate salt, makes it possible to form sulfuric acid during this reaction and thus, after separation (generally by filtration) of the expected salt from the reaction medium, to more easily regenerate the mother liquors comprising the sulfuric acid.<br>
The mother liquors resulting from the separation are concentrated in sulfuric acid (&gt; 60%) and can be directly conveyed to the regeneration, thus rendering this process devoid of aqueous effluent.<br>
The process of the invention applies to any dihydroxybenzenedisulfonic acid.<br>
It can be symbolized in particular by the following formula:<br><br>
SO3H<br><br>
(I)<br><br>
in said formula:<br>
-	the OH group being in the ortho, meta or para position with respect to the other hydroxyl group,<br>
-	the sulfonic SO3H groups being in the ortho and/or para position with respect to the hydroxyl groups.<br>
The invention does not exclude the presence of one or two substituents on the benzene ring insofar as they do not interfere.<br><br>
Mention may be made, as more specific examples, inter alia, of linear or branched alkyl or alkoxy groups having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; perfluoroalkyl groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; or halogen atoms, preferably chlorine, bromine or fluorine.<br>
Mention may be made, as preferred examples of dihydroxybenzenedisulfonic acids employed, of the disulfonic acids resulting from the sulfonation of hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene), of pyrocatechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene) and of resorcinol (1,3-dihydroxybenzene).<br>
The preferred dihydroxybenzenedisulfonic acids are 1,2-dihydroxy-3,5-benzenedisulfonic acid, 1,3-dihydroxy-4,6-benzenedisulfonic acid or 1,4-dihydroxy-2,5-benzenedisulfonic acid.<br>
In accordance with the process of the invention, the dihydroxybenzenedisulfonic acid is reacted with a salt coir^rising a sulfate or hydrogen sulfate anion.<br>
In order to simplify the account, said salt will be denoted subsequently "sulfate or hydrogen sulfate".<br>
The sulfate or hydrogen sulfate anion can be involved in any form.<br>
The requirement which governs the choice of the salt is that the salt has to be basic in nature so that it is soluble in the reaction medium.<br>
A metal element and more particularly an element from Group la or lb of the Periodic Table of the Elements may be involved.<br><br>
For the definition of the elements, reference is made below to the Periodic Table of the Elements published in the Bulletin de la Societe Chimique de France, No. 1 (1966).<br>
Mention may be made, as metal elements of Group la, of lithium, sodium and potassium and, as metal elements of Group lb, of copper and silver.<br>
However, for economic reasons, it is preferable to have recourse to readily accessible commercial forms.<br>
The choice is advantageously made of a metal element of alkali metal type belonging to Group la.<br>
Sodium, potassium or lithium sulfate or hydrogen sulfate is preferably involved.<br>
Sodium sulfate or potassium sulfate is very particularly chosen.<br>
The sulfate or hydrogen sulfate salt is preferably employed in the solid form in order not to dilute the reaction medium.<br>
The amount of sulfate or hydrogen sulfate salt employed, expressed by the ratio of the number of moles of sulfate or hydrogen sulfate salt to the number of moles of dihydroxybenzenedisulfonic acid, varies between 1.6 and 2.5, preferably between 1.9 and 2.1, and is preferably in the vicinity of 2.0. Use is thus made of an amount of corresponding salt preferably equal to the stoichiometry of the reaction (ratio of 2) or close to the stoichiometry as defined in the abovementioned range.<br>
From a practical viewpoint, the sulfate or hydrogen sulfate salt is introduced into the reaction medium<br><br>
comprising the dihydroxybenzenedisulfonic acid or vice versa.<br>
The salification reaction is carried out at a temperature of between 40Â°C and ,80Â°C, preferably between 50Â°C and 60Â°C.<br>
The dihydroxybenzenedisulfonic acid is then in the salified form, preferably in the sodium or potassium salt form when the salt chosen is sodium or potassium sulfate or hydrogen sulfate. It can be in the hydrated form, generally in the monohydrate form.<br>
It precipitates from the reaction medium.<br>
After returning to ambient temperature between 15'C and 30 Â°C, the precipitate is separated according to conventional solid/liquid separation techniques, preferably by filtration.<br>
It can optionally be subjected to a washing operation, for example using an alcohol, preferably methanol, ethanol or isopropanol.<br>
Subsequently, as a result of rhe washing, the precipitate can be subjected to a drying operation which can be carried out in an oven under vacuum (reduced pressure generally between 20 and 100 mm of mercury) or under a stream of hot gas, for example air or nitrogen, at a temperature advantageously chosen between 60*C and 110'C.<br>
As  mentioned  above,  the	salification  reaction  is<br>
preferably      carried	out      on      the<br>
dihydroxybenzenedisulfonic	acid resulting from the<br>
sulfonation stage.<br><br>
Thus,  the  dihydroxybenzene  corresponding	to	the<br>
dihydroxybenzenedisulfonic  acid  of  formula  (I)	is<br>
subjected to a sulfonation operation which can	be<br>
carried out with sulfuric acid or its oleums.<br>
Recourse may be had to an aqueous sulfuric acid solution having a concentration of between 90 and 100%. It is preferable to employ a concentrated solution and, preferably, the 98% by weight commercial form is chosen.<br>
Recourse may also be had to oleums, which correspond to sulfuric acid charged with sulfur trioxide SO3, the concentration of which can vary between 10% and 65% by weight. Oleums comprising 20%, 40% or 60% by weight of SO3 are commercially available.<br>
The sulfonation is carried out in the presence of an excess of sulfuric acid.<br>
The ratio of the number of moles of sulfuric acid to the number of moles of dihydroxybenzene is preferably at least 3 and more preferably between 4 and 6.<br>
The sulfonation is in particular carried out at a temperature greater than the crystallization temperature of the reaction medium. It is preferably between 50'C and 100Â°C.<br>
In noncontinuous (batch) operation, the duration of the sulfonation reaction and, in continuous operation, the overall mean residence time are in particular between 1 and 10 h, more particularly between 1 and 5 h.<br>
From a practical viewpoint, the dihydroxybenzene is generally introduced into the sulfuric acid and then heating is carried out at the chosen temperature.<br><br>
The dihydroxybenzenedisulfonic acid is obtained in the presence of an excess of sulfuric acid, the ratio of the number of moles of sulfuric acid to the number of moles of dihydroxybenzenedisulfonic acid being greater than 1, preferably between 2 and 4.<br>
At the end of the reaction, the reaction medium is diluted by addition of water in order to facilitate the stirring after salification.<br>
The amount of water introduced is approximately 5 to 10 mol per mole of dihydroxybenzenedisulfonic acid.<br>
It is preferable to minimize the amount of water involved.<br>
Subsequently, the sulfate or hydrogen sulfate salt is introduced under the conditions described above.<br>
At the end of the salification reaction,	a reaction<br>
medium   is   obtained  which   has   the	essential<br>
characteristic of being highly concentrated	in sulfuric<br>
acid.<br>
Thus, the ratio by weight of the sulfuric acid to the metal dihydroxybenzenedisulfonate varies between 1 and 2.1 and preferably lies between 1.6 and 1.7.<br>
Another characteristic of the reaction medium is that it comprises only a small amount of water.<br>
Thus, the ratio by weight of the water to the metal dihydroxybenzenedisulfonate varies between 0.4 and 0.8.<br>
Another characteristic is that only a small amount of metal sulfate is present.<br><br>
The amount of metal sulfate formed is less than 5% of the weight of metal dihydroxybenzenedisulfonate obtained.<br>
The precipitated metal dihydroxybenzenedisulfonate, which is preferably sodium dihydroxybenzenedisulfonate, is separated, preferably by filtration.<br>
The process of the invention makes it possible to recover, subsequent to the separation operation, preferably by filtration, mother liquors having a high concentration of sulfuric acid of greater than 50% by weight, preferably between 60% and 65% by weight.<br>
These mother liquors can be sent directly to the unit for the regeneration of the sulfuric acid, which is carried out in particular by conventional methods by incineration.<br>
When the salification is carried out according to the process of the state of the art using sodium hydroxide, it is not possible to obtain mother liquors which are as concentrated due to the dilution contributed by the water formed during the reaction and the water contribured by the sodium hydroxide employed in the form of an aqueous solution.<br>
