[ NAME OF INVENTION ]<br>
CROSSLINKED FOAM WHICH HAS INNER-CAVITY STRUCTURE, AND<br>
PROCESS OF FORMING THEREOF<br>
[ TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION ]<br>
The present invention relates to a cross-linked foam and a manufacturing method<br>
thereof. More specifically, it relates to the cross-linked foam having various inner cavity<br>
structure formed by an internally-formed surface and the method of forming the inner cavity<br>
structure simultaneously with a body of the cross-linked foam.<br>
[ CONVENTIONAL ART OF THE INVENTION ]<br>
FIG. 82 is a flow chart illustrating process steps of manufacturing cross-linked<br>
foams according to a related art.<br>
In step S10, source materials including main material such as diverse resins and other<br>
additives are first weighed in accordance with a designed mixture standard depending on what<br>
kind of cross-linked foam is fabricated. Then the weighed resins and additives are mixed with<br>
a cross-liking agent and a foaming agent in a hermetical mixer or kneader in a milling process.<br>
Therefore, a mixed chemical compound is prepared.<br>
In step S20, the prepared chemical compound is provided into a calender roll or an<br>
extruding machine. The calender roll transforms the chemical compound in a form of sheet or<br><br>
film, e.g., a two dimensional shape, and the extruding machine transforms the chemical<br>
compound in a form of pellet, e.g., a three dimensional shape.<br>
Step S30 shows various process steps of forming a desired cross-linked foam. The<br>
process of forming the cross-linked foam may be classified into a pressure cross-linked<br>
foaming method (pressure cross-linked foam molding) and a normal pressure cross-linked<br>
foaming method depending on machinery and equipment for the processes considering shapes<br>
and properties of the desired cross-linked foam.<br>
The pressure cross-linked foaming method mainly uses a metallic mold(s) to make<br>
the desired cross-linked foam, and applies heat and pressure to the chemical compounds after<br>
an input of the chemical compound into the inner parts of the metallic mold(s). Therefore, the<br>
cross-linked foam having a discontinuous pattern is formed in accordance with an inner part<br>
shape of the metallic mold(s) by a decomposition action of the foaming agent. Such pressure<br>
cross-linked foaming method may includes, for example, a compression-press cross-linked<br>
foam molding method that uses a press machine, and a injection-press cross-linked foam<br>
molding method that uses an injection machine, as shown in the step S30 of FIG. 82.<br>
When using the compression-press cross-linked foam molding method, the source<br>
materials are first put into the opened mold, and then the mold including the source material is<br>
closed. When using the injection-press cross-linked foam molding method, the source<br>
materials are put into the airtight injection mold. However, both in the compression-press and<br>
injection-press cross-linked foam molding methods, once the source material is provided into<br>
the mold, equipments such as press machine apply heat and pressure to the closed mold to<br>
foam the source material into a cross-linked foam<br><br>
In step S40, the applied pressure is released, and then the closed mold is open to de-<br>
mold the cross-linked foam. The de-molded material is then cured for a time and cooled<br>
down to a desired temperature. In step S50, the cured and cooled cross-linked foam is then<br>
cut and trimmed to be a final product.<br>
Although not shown in FIG. 82, the pressure cross-linked foaming method may also<br>
include a compression-rotary press cross-linked foam molding method where heating rolls<br>
and metallic press/conveyer belts are used to apply heat and pressure to the source materials<br>
for the cross-linked foam by way of inserting the source materials between the heating rolls<br>
and the metallic press/conveyer belts. Alternatively, the compression-rotary press cross-<br>
linked foam molding method may insert the source materials continuously with other textile<br>
materials or rubbery materials between the heating rolls and the metallic press/conveyer belts,<br>
whereas the foaming of the source material is induced at a point where the pressure is<br>
discharged. Thus, the cross-linked foam may have continuous and uniform surface and cross<br>
section.<br>
The pressure cross-linked foaming method applies heat and pressure directly to the<br>
source materials using the metallic moulds and rolls. The compression-press cross-linked<br>
foam molding method produces the various large or small industrial foams, for example, EVA,<br>
PE, rubbery large or small sponge panels, shoe components, sports goods and accessories, and<br>
the like. The injection-press cross-linked foam molding method generally produces the<br>
various industrial foams having individual shape, for example, EVA-based shoe components,<br>
sports protectors and goods, bags, accessories and the like. The compression-rotary press<br>
cross-linked foam molding method produces various industrial continuous roll type or large<br>
panel type foams, for example, EVA, PE or other rubbery continuous rolls.<br><br>
Meanwhile, the normal pressure cross-linked foaming method is widely used for<br>
forming a cross-linked foam having continuous and uniform cross section. Unlike the<br>
pressure cross-linked forming method, the normal pressure cross-linked foaming method<br>
produces the cross-linked foams without a direct heat and pressure infliction on the source<br>
materials. The normal pressure cross-linked foaming method is classified into a chemically<br>
cross-linked foaming method and an electron irradiation cross-linked foaming method.<br>
The chemically cross-linked foaming method adds and mixes a chemical cross-<br>
linking agent, a foaming agent, and an EVA based resin into a polyethylene resin that is a<br>
main source material. Thereafter, the mixture is extruded into a pellet type foaming material<br>
as shown in step S10 and S20 of FIG. 82. Then, through the step S30 of FIG. 82, the foaming<br>
materials are inserted into a hopper of the extruding machine that includes screws, heat<br>
appliers and extruding dies, and then the heat pre-determined by the material composition is<br>
applied to the foaming materials. After that, the melted foaming material passes through the<br>
extruding dies to provide a continuous and uniform cross section, and then the foaming<br>
material is foamed by (in step S30).<br>
The electron irradiation cross-linked foaming method applies electron rays to a<br>
foaming material that is formed by extruding a polyethylene or polypropylene resin mixed<br>
with other additives and agents, thereby cross-linking the materials and heating the foaming<br>
material up to the foaming-agent's decomposing temperature to make the foams. This<br>
electron irradiation cross-linked foaming method differs from the chemically cross-linked<br>
foaming method in a way that this uses the electron rays to achieve the cross-linking and then<br>
heats the cross-linked foaming material to foam the cross-linked foaming material.<br><br>
Meanwhile, in step S40, the cross-linked foam is cured for a time and then cooled<br>
down to a certain temperature. In step S50, the cross-linked foam is then cut, trimmed and<br>
designed to be a final product.<br>
Although not shown, the normal pressure cross-linked foaming method includes a<br>
calender cross-linked foaming method in which a mixture of a polyvinyl chloride based or<br>
polyolefin based resin with a chemical foaming agent, a cross-linking agent (plasticizer in<br>
case of polyvinyl chloride), a stabilizer and a surfactant is used. The calender cross-linked<br>
foaming method transforms the mixture into a continuous and uniform foaming material using<br>
the extruding machine, the storage mill and the calender roll, and then the foaming material is<br>
heated in the heating chamber of a conveyor to be foamed under a normal pressure condition.<br>
Thereafter, the foaming material is cooled down and cured for a time to form the foams, and<br>
then a roll-shaped foam is obtained by way of winding the foams on the take-up roll.<br>
In step S60 of FIG. 82, the foams finally obtained through the pressure cross-linked<br>
foaming method or normal pressure cross-linked foaming method may be attached to one of<br>
other molded material formed from the same as or different from the foaming material,<br>
textiles, woods and metallic materials depending on an end use, property and purpose of the<br>
foams and then be re-formed.<br>
Such a re-forming method may be classified into a heat/cold mold compression re-<br>
molding, a cold mold compression re-molding, a cold mold vacuum re-molding, and a blow<br>
re-molding. The heat/cold mold compression re-molding method forces the cross-linked<br>
foam to be inserted into the mold, and then the cross-linked foam in the mold cooled down<br>
after being heated and pressed. The cold mold compression re-molding method pre-heats the<br>
cross-linked foam and then inserts it into the mold, and thereafter, the cross-linked foam is<br><br>
pressed and cooled down to form the finalized foam. The cold mold vacuum re-molding<br>
method applies heat to the cross-linked foam at a pre-determined temperature and then sucks<br>
the heated foam into the mold using a vacuum pressure, and thereafter, the foam is cooled<br>
down and de-molded to form the finalized foam. Furthermore, the blow re-molding method<br>
applies heat to the cross-linked foam to be softened and then inserts the high-pressure gas or<br>
the liquid into the cross-linked foam, such that the cross-linked foam is re-molded in the mold<br>
and becomes the finalized foam after being de-molded.<br>
The cross-linked foams formed by the related art cross-linked foam fabrication<br>
methods have the following characteristics. The compression-press cross-linked foam<br>
molding method of the pressure cross-linked foaming method inserts the source material<br>
shaped like a sheet type or a particle type into the mold, and then applies heat to that source<br>
material, thereby manufacturing the foam having a uniform physical property. Furthermore,<br>
since the injection-press cross-linked foam molding method heats the source material in the<br>
cylinder of die feeder and then melts the material so as to be inserted into the mold, the source<br>
material can have the uniform property in all parts and the produced cross-linked foams may<br>
also have the uniform physical characteristics.<br>
Meanwhile, since the normal pressure cross-linked foaming method inserts the<br>
source materials having a particle type into the extruding machine and then heats them to be<br>
softened, the cross-linked foam material can have the uniform cross section and the uniform<br>
physical property in all parts, and also the finalized foam may have the uniform property in all<br>
portions. Although the source material is formed of the several substances in the related art<br>
cross-linked foam fabrication, the finalized foam also has the determined property having the<br>
uniform density because the source material is transformed into a single unified material<br><br>
before the foam process. Moreover, in the related art methods described above, the foaming<br>
process does not make the foam having different density or different properties in every each<br>
portion because the same source material is used in the foam process. The related art cross-<br>
linked foaming method is hard to manufacture an inner cavity structure having various shapes<br>
and formations inside the foam at the same time when the foam is made. Therefore, the<br>
related art cross-linked foaming method does not make the density differentiation inside the<br>
finalized foam.<br>
Therefore, when manufacturing the cross-linked foam having the complex physical<br>
properties and functions, the related art separately makes the cross-linked foams and then cuts,<br>
grinds and attaches the foams in an additional fabrication steps to produce the foam having<br>
the diverse densities and desired inner structures. However, such additional processes may<br>
cause the fabrication difficulty, the low throughput and the degradation of design and quality,<br>
such that the desired cross-linked foam having the various physical properties and inner<br>
structures is hardly obtained. Moreover, the related art described hereinbefore may increase<br>
the process steps and costs and may cause a lot of industrial wastes because the foams each<br>
having different physical properties and functions are separately manufactured and<br>
compounded.<br>
To overcome the above-mentioned disadvantage, the Korean Patent Application No.<br>
2003-45282 titled "Method for Manufacturing EVA Based Foam" has disclosed a method<br>
including steps of 1) mixing an EVA resin, a cross-linking agent, a foaming agent, a colorant,<br>
a filler, an additive, and a rubber or a resin which can be mixed with the EVA resin, 2)<br>
performing a low melting point spinning on the resultant composition, 3) making the spinning<br>
filament into a tow or staple fiber to be used as a first material, selecting a second material<br><br>
from a group consisting of a water soluble PVA based staple fiber, a polyester based staple<br>
fiber and a natural fiber, and producing a non-woven fabric by mixing the first and second<br>
materials, 4) melting out a dissolved matter from the non-woven fabric, and 5) cross-linked<br>
foaming the non-woven fabric. This method has merits in that an air pore structure is formed<br>
in the foam. However, the method disclosed in the above-described Korean Patent<br>
Application No. 2003-45282 is not concerned with a method for designing or controlling the<br>
shape and structure of the inner surface shape and structure of the foam, whereby the cross-<br>
linked foam could not have the different densities and functions in the parts.<br>

[ THE BEST MODE FOR INVENTION ]<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to an illustrated embodiment of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are shown in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible,<br>
similar reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or similar<br>
parts.<br>
FIG. 83 is a flow chart illustrating process steps of manufacturing cross-linked foams<br>
according to a principle of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 83, the forming method<br>
of the present invention includes a step of mixing source materials (S100), a step of shaping<br>
the mixed source materials (S200), a step of selecting an interfacing material (S300), a step of<br>
forming an interfacing pattern using the selected interfacing material (S400), a step of<br>
foaming a foaming material having the interfacing pattern to form a foam (S500), a step of<br>
cooling and curing the foam (S600), and a step of finalizing the foam (S700).<br>
The step S100 selects a main resin as a source material among the various materials<br>
depending on the desired cross-linked foam's availabilities and physical properties, and then<br>
mixes the main resin with the other additives and agent. After planning the material<br>
composition, the source material and the sub materials are weighed by desired amounts in<br>
accordance with the material composition plan, and then the source material and sub materials<br>
are mixed in the airtight mixer or kneader. The step S100 may include adding a cross linking<br>
agent and a foaming agent into the mixture using the open mill.<br>
The source material used in the step S100 can be selected from a synthetic material<br>
having a possibility to become a foam using a various cross-linked foaming method, for<br>
example, synthetic resins such as an EVA based resin, a polyolefin based resin containing PEs<br><br>
of a variety of densities, a polyvinyl based resin, a polyurethane based resin, and LDPE(low<br>
density polyethylene)-added EVA, a copolymer thereof, a blend thereof, or a mixture thereof;<br>
a natural or synthetic rubber constituted by a mixture of a natural rubber, a styrene butadiene<br>
rubber (SBR) based, a poly-butadiene(BR) based, an poly-isoprene rubber(IR) based, a<br>
chloroprene rubber(CR) based, an nitrile rubber (NRB) based, an EPDM rubber based, an<br>
ethylene-propylene rubber'(EPR) based, and an acryl rubber (AR) based rubber, and/or an<br>
styrene butadiene rubber(SBR) added neoprene rubber(NR); and a composite material<br>
including an EPDM rubber added ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and a poly-vinyl chloride<br>
(PVC) added nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR).<br>
However, it is recommended to adopt EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate) that can contain<br>
a variable percentage of an amount of vinyl acetate (VA %) or the polyethylene (PE) based<br>
synthetic resin having various densities as the source material.<br>
When more than one source material among the above-mentioned materials is<br>
properly mixed with the sub materials to be a composite through the above-mentioned<br>
composition process, the composite becomes a foaming material with the foaming action<br>
suppressed by the calender roll or the extruder. At this time, the foaming material has a<br>
planar shape, such as film or sheet, or a three-dimensional shape, such as pellet, i.e., step<br>
S200.<br>
The foaming material according to the present invention is not limited to a specific<br>
shape or type, but the foaming material is weighed whenever it is used as a particle or sheet<br>
type at every foaming process. Further, when the foaming material is applied to the specific<br>
embodiment described hereinafter, the foaming material is recommended to have a plane<br>
shape, particularly a film shape, which has a precise surface roughness, regarding the<br><br>
advisable use. Namely, the EVA based or PE based film, or the material having the same<br>
surface roughness as them can be used for the foaming material.<br>
Meanwhile, when converting a primary foaming material, such as the composite<br>
completed by the injection machine or the pellet having the foaming-inhibited state, into a<br>
secondary foaming material having the foaming-inhibited characteristic by the injection<br>
method, the primary foaming material having the particle type is softened inside a cylinder at<br>
a low temperature, e.g., 70 - 90 degrees Celsius, and then the softened primary foaming<br>
material is filled into an empty space of the molding die to perform the low temperature<br>
formation, e.g., less than 50 degrees Celsius. Therefore, at this time of forming the second<br>
foaming material, the foaming agent inside the primary foaming material is not<br>
decompositioned while the secondary foaming material is made.<br>
When the press-type method is utilized, the second foaming material can be obtained<br>
if the primary foaming material having the sheet, film or pellet shape formed by the mold is<br>
processed at a condition where the foaming agent is not decompositioned (for example, at a<br>
heating temperature of less than 60 - 80 degrees Celsius, under the pressure of more than<br>
150Kg/cm2, and at a cooling temperature of less than 50 degrees Celsius).<br>
The normal pressure cross-linked foaming method, which forms the continuous<br>
pattern shape unlike the pressure cross-linked foaming method, softens the primary foaming<br>
material using the extrusion method similar to the injection method, and then produces the<br>
material having the continuous and uniform cross section. Therefore, any type of shapes of<br>
foaming material can be applied to the present invention only if it is possible to form the<br>
interfacing pattern on the foaming material with the foaming action suppressed.<br><br>
Once the foaming material is prepared (S300), at least one interfacing pattern is<br>
formed on the surface of the foaming material in a specific shape (S400).<br>
The interfacing pattern is for forming an internally-formed surface that forms an<br>
inner cavity structure in the cross-linked foam during the cross-United foaming process, and<br>
the interfacing pattern is for preventing the physical or chemical interaction between the<br>
foaming materials that are faced to each other across the interfacing pattern.<br>
The material for the interfacing pattern may be liquids having viscosity, powder or<br>
solid having a certain shape such as films, which is able to prevent the interaction between the<br>
foaming materials during the cross-linked foaming process. For example, the interfacing<br>
material may be selected from a group consisting of natural or synthetic paints or inks, natural<br>
or synthetic resins, papers, textiles, non-woven fabrics, and rubbery materials. Additionally,<br>
when selecting the interfacing material, it is considerable to be easily attached to the foaming<br>
material, to have the repeated reappearance during the foaming process, to have the<br>
possibility of obstructing the cubical expansion of the foam during the foaming process, or to<br>
have the easy elimination from the cross-linked foam if required after the foaming process.<br>
The formation of the interfacing pattern may be achieved by printing, transcription,<br>
coating, deposition, lamination, spray, cloth attachment, inserting, attaching or a modification<br>
thereof, and any other method can be possible only if it is able to form the interfacing material<br>
on the surface of the foaming material. However, when the ink or the like containing various<br>
kind of resins dissolved is used as an interfacing material, the printing method is desirably<br>
adopted in forming the interfacing pattern. Further, if more than two interfacing patterns are<br>
formed, each of the interfacing patterns may be formed with same or different material. A<br><br>
foaming agent, which is the same as or different from the foaming agent contained in the<br>
foaming material, may be added to the interfacing material.<br>
Moreover, a step of combining a foaming material having no interfacing pattern<br>
with the foaming material having the interfacing pattern may be further added. The foaming<br>
material having no interfacing pattern may be the same material as or different material from<br>
the foaming material having the interfacing pattern. A step of adding material same as or<br>
different from the foaming material having the interfacing pattern to the combined foaming<br>
material may be further added. A step of winding the foaming material having the interfacing<br>
pattern on a roll may further be added to easily separate the foaming material.<br>
After completing the formation of the interfacing pattern on the foaming material, the<br>
cross-linked foaming process is performed by the pressure cross-linked foaming method, the<br>
normal pressure cross-linked foaming method, or any modified method thereof. According to<br>
the press-type method and the injection-type method of the pressure cross-linked foaming<br>
method, the molding die is opened and then the foaming material having the interfacing<br>
pattern is filled automatically or hand-operatedly into the hollow space of the molding die,<br>
thereby foaming the foaming material by applying heat and pressure thereto. In the chemical<br>
or electron irradiation method of the normal pressure cross-linked foaming method, the<br>
foaming material having the interfacing pattern is provided before a heating process for<br>
foaming and men the foaming process is performed (step S500 of FIG. 83). If the heat is<br>
applied to the foaming material or if tire electron rays are irradiated on the foaming material<br>
during the cross-linked foaming process, the foaming material is cross-linked in a gel state by<br>
the heat infliction or the electron irradiation.<br><br>
However, the foaming materials neighboring each other across the interfacing pattern<br>
are not physically/chemically coupled and interconnected until they reach the step of foaming.<br>
At this state, the foaming materials cubically expand at a specific rate and then the cross-<br>
United foams are made. Portions of the foaming materials corresponding to the interfacing<br>
patterns are also cubically expanded at the same ratio as the other portions during the foaming<br>
process. However, because the physical and chemical connection of the foaming material is<br>
prevented by the interfacing pattern, an internally-formed surface is formed in the cross-<br>
linked foam at a position corresponding to the interfacing pattern. The internally-formed<br>
surface forms an empty space, i.e., an inner cavity. A shape and structure of the inner cavity<br>
can be easily controlled by changing a shape or material of the material for the interfacing<br>
pattern irrespective of manufacturing equipments and facilities. A certain amount of gas (for<br>
example, nitrogen gas(N2), carbon dioxide (CO2)) that is generated by a decomposition action<br>
of the foaming agent during the foaming process is trapped into the space (the inner cavity)<br>
formed by the internally-formed surface. The gas pressure of the inner cavity can be properly<br>
controlled by adding a certain amount of foaming agent or material that can increase a gas<br>
generation to the interfacing material before the foaming process. Whereas, the gas pressure<br>
in the inner cavity may be controlled by an external air-pumping device.<br>
If the pressure cross-linked foaming method is adopted to form the cross-linked foam<br>
of the present invention, material same as or different from the foaming material having the<br>
interfacing pattern may be input into a residual space of the mold where the foaming material<br>
having the interfacing pattern has already been laid, and then those materials may be foamed<br>
simultaneously to form the cross-linked foam. A combination or modification of the pressure<br><br>
cross-linked foaming method and the normal pressure cross-linked foaming method can be<br>
adopted for an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
After the completion of foaming process, the foams are cooled down and cured to<br>
stabilize the property and size thereof at a predetermined condition, i.e., step S600 of FIG. 83.<br>
Thereafter, the foams are cut and trimmed, thereby completing the cross-linked foaming<br>
process according to the present invention. However, it is possible to re-form the cross-linked<br>
foams using a compression molding, a vacuum molding, and a blow molding that injects the<br>
air or liquid, depending on a usage of the cross-linked foam as in step S800 of FIG. 83.<br>
Although the primarily formed foams are re-formed, the shape and structure of the internally-<br>
formed surface are not affected by the mold's shape and structure or other equipments during<br>
the re-forming process. Meanwhile, the foaming process of the present invention may further<br>
include a step of inserting or filling a material that is same as or different from the foaming<br>
material into the empty space formed by the internally-formed surface of the foam and then<br>
foaming the foaming material having the inserted or filled material. Also, the present<br>
invention may further include a step of forming an air passage in the foam extending from the<br>
surface of the foam to the internally-formed surface and then injecting a material that is same<br>
as or different from the foaming material into the space formed by the internally-formed<br>
surface through the air passage before the foaming process. The method of injecting the<br>
material through the air passage makes it possible that a portion of the injected material is also<br>
formed on the surface of the foam, such that the foam can have the unified/integrated<br>
appearance between the internally-formed surface and the outer foam surface, wherein the<br>
material in the space formed by the internally-formed surface can be easily recognized from<br>
the outside. The type and phase of the material to be injected, filled or inserted into the space<br><br>
formed by the internally-formed surface is not limited, and the injected, filled or inserted<br>
material can be adhered to the internally-formed surface using an adhesive material depending<br>
on a kind of inserting material.<br>
Now, a method for forming and controlling the shape of the inner cavity structure of<br>
the cross-linked foam will be explained in detail in accordance with the present invention.<br>

A2 types. This type of materials includes EVA resin having appropriate vinyl acetate content,<br>
a melting index and density as a main material, A foaming agent, a cross-linking agent,<br>
pigments, a variety of fillers, and functional additives are selectively added into and mixed<br>
with the main material depending on the foam application and fabrication process.<br><br><br><br>
Type B: This type is classified into type Bl and type B2. The type Bl adopts an<br>
EVA based resin as a main material and includes polyethylene resin among the variety of<br>

The main and sub materials for the type B does not confined to the EVA based resin<br>
and the polyethylene based resin but many different synthetic resins such as polypropylene<br>
based resin, polyisobutylene based resin or poly olefine based resin may be selected as the<br>
main or sub materials.<br><br><br>
In case a composite material of the type B2 is foamed by an electron irradiation<br>
method, DCP (dicumyl peroxide) that is a kind of organic peroxide based cross-linking agent<br>
may be excluded.<br>
Type C; For the main material, this type may include a variety of synthetic resins,<br>
such as an EVA base resin and polyethylene based resin, a natural rubber, or a synthetic<br>
rubber such as styrene butadiene rubber (SBR), poly-butadien rubber (BR), nitrile rubber<br>
(NRB), polyisoprene rubber, butyl rubber (IR), chloroprene rubber (CR), neoprene rubber<br>
(CR), EPDM rubber, polymer blended NBR, acryl rubber (AR), Urethane rubber (UR), and<br>
silicon rubber (SR), etc. A foaming agent, a cross-linking agent, pigments, a variety of fillers,<br>
and functional additives are selectively added into and mixed with such main materials. This<br>
type C is classified into type CI, C2, C3, C4 and C5. Meanwhile, the type C4 and C5<br>
include at least one of a variety of natural and synthetic rubbers as a main material, and<br>
additionally include a foaming agent, a cross-linking agent, pigments, a variety of fillers, and<br>
functional additives as a sub material.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
First Embodiment<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a manufacturing process of a cross-linked foam having more than<br>
one internally-formed surface according to a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Material preparation: Three sheets of film type materials 11 la, 11 lb and 111c, which<br>
are calender-molded at a foaming rate of 150%, are cut to have the size of thickness 2mm,<br>
width 100mm, and length 100mm.<br>
Interfacing pattern formation: A silkscreen printing is performed on both sides of the<br>
first film type material Ilia among the three sheets of film type materials Ilia, 111b and<br>
111c. Interfacing patterns 121a and 121b are printed on the first film type material 11 la in a<br>
thickness of 70 micrometers by using a urethane-resin-based ink and the resultant structure is<br>
dried at a temperature of 60 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes. The interfacing patterns 121a<br>
and 121b have five-striped pattern shapes each having a width 2mm and a length 50mm, and<br>
each of the five-striped pattern shapes are spaced apart from each other by a distance of 8mm.<br><br>
Foaming process: FIG. 1 shows a compression-press cross-linked foam molding<br>
method. In this method, the film type materials 111b and 111c are joined to the top and<br>
bottom surfaces of the film type material Ilia, respectively, thereby obtain a combination<br>
110. The weight of the combination is measured, and the combination 110 is injected into a<br>
cavity 131 of a molding die 130 which has a width 100mm, a length 100mm, and a depth<br>
6mm. Then the combination 110 is heated and pressed for 480 seconds at a temperature of<br>
150 to 160 degree C under a pressure of 150Kg/cm2, such that the film type materials Ilia,<br>
11 lb and 11 lc are cross-linked and foamed.<br>
Thereafter, the pressure is released, and sequentially the molding die 130 is quickly<br>
opened, thereby foaming the combination 110 to fabricate a foam 140. At this time, the foam<br>
140 is foam-molded in accordance with the shape of the cavity 131 of the molding die 130.<br>
Therefore, the internally-formed surfaces 142a and 142b each forming the inner cavity 143<br>
are formed at the intermediate portion of an inside 141 of the foam 140 correspondingly to the<br>
shape of the interfacing pattern 121. Since the interfacing pattern 121 are consisting of the<br>
five-striped patterns each of which has a width 2mm and a length 50mm, five upper and lower<br>
inner cavities 143 are formed in the inside 141 of the foam, wherein each of the internally-<br>
formed surfaces 142a and 142b is a tube type having a diameter 3mm and a length 75ram.<br>
Due to the distance of 8mm among the five-striped patterns, there are formed membranes, i.e.,<br>
a cross-sectional portion between neighboring striped patterns 141, each of which has a width<br>
of 12mm. The internally-formed surfaces 142a and 142b and the inner cavities 143 are<br>
formed in the foam irrespective of the shape of the cavity 131 of the molding die 130, but has<br>
a correlation with the interfacing pattern 121. The foam 140 has a dimension of width<br>
150mm, a length 150mm, and a thickness 12mm.<br><br>
Second Embodiment<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a manufacturing process of a cross-linked foam according to a<br>
second embodiment of the present invention. The second embodiment is a modification of the<br>
first embodiment in which a double-layered internally-formed surfaces are formed in the foam.<br>
Material Preparation: Three sheets of white materials 211a, 211b, and 211c are<br>
injection-molded at a foaming rate of 150%.<br>
Interfacing pattern Formation: Each surface of the first and second white materials<br>
21 la and 21 lb is pad printed to form first and second interfacing patterns 221 and 222. The<br>
first interfacing pattern 221 is formed on the first white material 211a, and has nine doughnut<br>
type patterns each of which has an inner circle having a diameter of 2mm arranged at the<br>
center of the doughnut type pattern and an outer circle having a diameter of 6mm. The<br>
second interface 222 is formed on the second white material 211b, and is designed with<br>
sixteen circle patterns each having a diameter of 2mm. The interfaces 221 and 222 are printed<br>
by a thickness of 20 micrometers using acrylic-resin ink, and then thermal-dried at a<br>
temperature of 25 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes.<br>
Foaming process: In case of injection molding, the third material 21 lc is inserted<br>
between the printed surfaces of first and second materials 211a and 211b, thereby forming a<br>
combination 210. Then, the combination 210 is disposed into a molding die 230, and the<br>
molding die 230 is closed. A black-particle-type material 212 is injected into a residual space<br>
234 of the molding die 230. The black-particle-type material 212 is heated, softened and<br>
melted in a material injector 232 at a temperature of 80 to 100 degrees Celsius before it is<br><br>
injected. Thereafter, the combination 210 and the material 212 are heated and pressed for 420<br>
seconds at 170 degrees Celsius under a pressure of 6.5Kg/cm2 so as to prepare for a foaming<br>
process.<br>
Thereafter, the pressure is released and subsequently the molding die 230 is quickly<br>
opened, thereby obtaining single foam 240 having black and white colors derived from the<br>
combination 210 and material 212. The foam 240 has first and second internally-formed<br>
surfaces 242 and 244 forming an inner cavity 243 in an inside 241 of the foam. The first<br>
interfacing pattern 221 constituted by the nine doughnut type patterns on the material 211a<br>
becomes nine first internally-formed surface having a width of 3mm and a diameter of 9mm.<br>
Sixteen-second internally-formed surface 244 having a diameter of 3mm are formed inside<br>
241. The second internally-formed surface 244 are derived from second interfacing patterns<br>
222 having the circle pattern.<br>
Third Embodiment<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a manufacturing process of a foam according to a third embodiment<br>
of the present invention. The third embodiment is a modification of the second embodiment.<br>
Material Preparation: Two sheets of materials 311a and 311b are extrusion-molded<br>
or calender-molded at a foaming rate of 150%. Each of the materials has a width of 40inches,<br>
a length of 10 yards, and a thickness of 2mm.<br>
Interfacing pattern Formation: Peanut-shaped patterns 321 constituted by a pair of<br>
adjacent circles each of which has a diameter 6mm are arranged on the first material 311a.<br>
Each of the adjacent circles of the peanut-shaped patterns 321 has a centric circular opening<br>
having a diameter of 2mm. Each of the peanut-shaped patterns are printed using a epoxy-<br><br>
resin-based ink on the first material at a thickness of 40 micrometers with a margin of 10mm<br>
from the up-and-bottora and left-and-right neighboring peanut-shaped patterns, and thermal-<br>
dried at a temperature of 60 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes.<br>
Foaming Process: In case when the chemical or electron irradiation method is<br>
adopted, the second material 311b where the patterns 321 are not printed is temporarily joined<br>
and attached to the first material 311a through a compression roll and the like. Alternatively, a<br>
sheet type material rather than the second material 31 lb is attached to the surface of the first<br>
material 311a. Thus-obtained combination 310 is prepared in the step prior to a heating<br>
process in case of chemical cross-linked foam molding and in the step prior to an electron<br>
irradiation process in case of electron irradiation cross-linked foam molding. The combination<br>
310 is heated and then cross-linked at a temperature 180 to 200 degrees Celsius through the<br>
chemical cross-linked foam molding, or irradiated by electron beams and heated through the<br>
electron irradiation cross-linked foam molding, thereby permitting the combination 310 to be<br>
foamed. In an inside 341 of a plane type foam 340 which is foamed uniformly and<br>
continuously in a thickness of 6mm, a peanut-shaped internally-formed surface 342 that forms<br>
an inner cavity 343 having a length of 9mm and two columns 345 each of which has a width<br>
of 3mm in between the inner cavities343 are formed. The peanut-shaped internally-formed<br>
surfaces 342 are spaced apart from each other by a distance of 15mm in the inside 341.<br>
The inner cavity structures hi the foams formed by the above-described first to third<br>
embodiments have shapes, densities, and structures independently from the shape of the<br>
molding die.<br>
Fourth Embodiment<br><br>
This fourth embodiment is to provide a method of controlling pressure and volume of<br>
a space, i.e., an inner cavity, formed by an internally-formed surface having a wide variety of<br>
shapes. Additionally, this embodiment forms the interfacing patterns by adding a foaming<br>
agent to the interfacing material (ink) so as to efficiently control pressure and volume of the<br>
air layer in the inner cavity.<br>
A first foaming agent blended with the foaming material is desirably the same as a<br>
second foaming agent contained in the printed film in a way of a kind, a grade and a<br>
decomposition temperature, and those two foaming agents are simultaneously decomposed at<br>
a predetermined temperature. Such foaming agent of this embodiment is an AC based<br>
foaming agent having azodicarbonamide as a main component, which has a decomposition<br>
temperature of 152 to 158 degrees Celsius and a gas generation amount of 160 to 180 ml/g.<br>
The first foaming agent blended with the foaming material and the second foaming agent<br>
contained in the printed film are simultaneously decomposed at a predetermined temperature<br>
such that a predetermined amount of gases, such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide, are<br>
generated. Thus, the inner cavity filled with such gases is formed inside of the foam at a<br>
position corresponding to the interfacing pattern.<br>
The following table 5 shows a comparison of volume and repulsive elasticity of the<br>
inner cavity and a specific gravity of foam in accordance with the contents of foaming agent<br>
in the interfacing materials.<br><br><br><br>
. FIG. 4 illustrates a manufacturing process of a cross-linked foam according to a<br>
fourth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Material Preparation: Four sheets of materials 411a, 411b, 411c and 41 Id are formed<br>
at a foaming rate of 150% and cut into sizes each having a thickness of 2.5mm, a width of<br>
100mm, and a length of 100mm.<br>
Interfacing pattern Formation: Stripes, each of which has a width 3mm and a length<br>
80mm, are arranged in vertical and horizontal directions with being spaced to each other by a<br>
distance of 20mm on a surface of the first material 411a. A designed pattern 412 including<br>
such stripes also has circles of diameter 5mm at crossing points of the stripes. An air passage<br>
413 having a width of 2mm and a length of 5mm is attached to a bottom line portion of the<br>
designed pattern 412. Usually,, the designed pattern 412 is screen-printed using a rubber-<br>
based ink so as to form an interfacing pattern having a thickness 70m, and then dried.<br>
Foaming Process: The second material 411b is disposed on the printed surface of the<br>
first material 411a, and the third and fourth material 411c and 411 d are sequentially disposed<br>
on a surface of the first material 411a opposite to the printed surface, thereby completing a<br>
combination 410. Thereafter, the combination 410 of the first to fourth materials 411a-411d<br>
is disposed into a cavity of a molding die having a depth of 10mm, a width of 100mm and a<br>
length of 100mm, and then heated and pressed so as to be foamed. Accordingly, the resultant<br><br>
foam 410 has a thickness of 15mm, a width of 150mm and a length of 150mm. An internally-<br>
formed surfaces 442 of the foam 410 has an air injection passage 445 inside of the foam at a<br>
depth of 3mm measured from a surface 444 of the form 410. The inner cavity structure 442<br>
formed by the internally-formed surface 442 serves as air passage. The inner cavity structure<br>
442 is formed in the size of a width of 120mm and a length of 120mm, respectively. An air<br>
injector 450 is connected to the air passage 445, and air of appropriate pressure is injected. A<br>
portion 546 of the resultant foam 410 where the air injector 450 has passed is closed by an<br>
attachment 460 in such a manner of melting attachment or high-frequency attachment,<br>
whereby desired air pressure spaces are obtained in the inner cavity 442.<br>
Fifth Embodiment<br>
This fifth embodiment is a modification of the fourth embodiment, and provides an<br>
ability of controlling pressure and volume of a space formed by an internally-formed surface.<br>
FIGS. 5 and 6 show manufacturing processes of a cross-linked foam according to a fifth<br>
embodiment of the present invention<br>
FIG. 5 shows a structure utilizing a single check valve 532. When a pressure 510<br>
repeatedly presses a foam 540, the space (the inner cavity) formed by the internally-formed<br>
surface 542 shrinks and then subsequently an external air 520 is introduced into the space<br>
formed by the internally-formed surface 542 through an air passage 530 and the check valve<br>
532, thereby controlling the pressure and volume of the space formed by the internally-<br>
formed surface 542. FIG. 6 shows a structure utilizing two check valves 532 and 538. An<br>
amount of air less than that of air introduced through a first check valve 532 is discharged<br>
from the the space formed by the internally-formed surface 542 through a second air passage<br><br>
536 and a second check valve 538 during the re-contraction operation of the space formed by<br>
the internally-formed surface 542. Therefore, the structure having the two check valves 532<br>
and 538 controls the pressure more efficiently than that of FIG. 5. In the fifth embodiment,<br>
more than one air passages are formed in the foam, and a variety of check valves are attached<br>
to the air passages, thereby obtaining the foam having the increased buffering abilities and the<br>
air suction/discharge functions without arranging an additional air bag or pump in the foam.<br>
Sixth Embodiment<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a manufacturing process of a foam according to a sixth embodiment<br>
of the present invention. The sixth embodiment is a modification of the fourth embodiment.<br>
Material Preparation: Two film-typed materials 611a and 611b are calender-molded<br>
at a foaming ratio of 200%. Each of the first and second film-typed materials 61 la and 611b<br>
has a width of 40inches, a length of lOyards, and a thickness of 2mm.<br>
Interfacing pattern Formation: A designed pattern 621 that is the same as the<br>
designed pattern 412 of the fourth embodiment is gravure-printed on a surface of the first<br>
film-typed material 611a at a thickness of approximately 40 micrometers using an epoxy-<br>
resin-based ink. The pattern 621 is spaced apart from side edges of the first film-type<br>
material 61 la by a distance of 1 inch.<br>
Foaming Process: The second film-typed material 61 lb is attached to a front surface<br>
of the first film-typed material 61 la where the designed pattern 621 is printed using a<br>
pressure roll, thereby forming a combination of the first and second film-typed materials 611a<br>
and 611b. The combination obtained by temporarily attaching the material 611b on the<br>
printed surface of the materials 611a is foamed by a chemical method or an electron<br><br>
irradiation method. The internally-formed surface of the resultant foam is almost the same as<br>
those of FIG. 4. Furthermore, the air injection method is also the same as that of the fourth<br>
embodiment as described in FIG. 4.<br>
Seventh Embodiment<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates a cross-linked foam having an air ventilating structure to improve a<br>
buffering function and an air permeability according to a seventh embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The foam manufactured by the seventh embodiment has an internally-formed<br>
surface forming an inner cavity structure that is capable of sucking or discharging air.<br>
Material Preparation: Two film-type materials 711a and 71 lb are calender-molded at<br>
a foaming rate of 150%, and then cut into a size having a thickness of 2mm, a width of<br>
100mm and a length of 100mm, respectively.<br>
Interfacing pattern Formation: Circular patterns each having a diameters 5mm and a<br>
thickness of 50 micrometers is formed on the first film-type material 71 la by way of printing<br>
a rubbery ink. The circular patterns are disposed in the range of 160 mm2 (80mm X 80mm)<br>
with a margin of 10mm from the side edges, and spaced apart from one another by a distance<br>
of 100mm. The printed circular patterns become an interfacing pattern 712.<br>
Foaming Process: A second film-type material 71 lb is attached to the first film-type<br>
material 711a to cover the printed interfacing pattern 712, thereby forming a combination<br>
thereof. The thus-obtained combination is inserted into a cavity of a molding die which has a<br>
depth of 4mm, a width of 100mm and a length of 100mm, and then the molding die presses<br>
and heats the combination to form a foam 740. After releasing the pressure and heat, the<br>
resultant foam 740 has a thickness of 6mm, a width of 150mm and a length of 150mm.<br><br>
Thereafter, a punch forms three holes 742 each having a diameter of 1mm from a foam<br>
surface to an internally-formed surface 744.<br>
The foam 740 produced by this seventh embodiment has not only the internally-<br>
formed surface 744 but also columns 746 with the area range of 120mm width and 120mm<br>
length. Each of the columns 746 has a diameter of 7mm and is spaced apart from the<br>
neighboring columns by a distance of 15mm. Inner cavities formed by the internally-formed<br>
surfaces 744 are connected to each other.<br>
When a pressure P is applied from an external source to the foam 740, an air 750 in<br>
the inner cavity 744 is discharged to the outside through the holes 742. On the contrary, when<br>
the pressure P is released, the shape and volume of the foam 740 are restored by the restoring<br>
forces of the columns 746 as sucking an outside air 752 into the inner formed surface 744.<br>
According to the seventh embodiment, it is possible to manufacture a foam that is<br>
capable of sucking or discharging air only by the contracting/restoring action of the foam,<br>
which is controlled by adjusting the volume of the inner cavity and the size and number of<br>
holes for air suction and discharge. It is also possible to form the internally-formed surface in<br>
a multi-layered structure and a second internally-formed surface between the surface of the<br>
foam and the internally-formed surface so as to insert a thin synthetic resin plate into a space<br>
formed by the second internally-formed surface. The foam manufactured by the seventh<br>
embodiment can be applied widely to products which require shock absorbing forces and air<br>
permeability, such as shoe components, protective equipment, bed, chair, bag, floor material<br>
and sound proof material.<br>
Eighth Embodiment<br><br>
FIG. 9 illustrates a manufacturing process of a cross-linked foam according to a<br>
eighth embodiment of the present invention. In the eighth embodiment, the same or different<br>
materials are inserted into a space formed by an intemally-formed surface having a variety of<br>
shapes.<br>
First of all, a foam 840 is manufactured by the fourth embodiment shown in FIG. 4.<br>
Thereafter, an air hole 847 having a diameter of 1mm is punched to an air injection passage<br>
845 that is connected to the internally-formed surface 842. The foam 840 having the air hole<br>
847 is disposed into an aluminum molding die 830, and then a heat is applied to the foam 840<br>
at a temperature of 300 to 40 degrees Celsius.<br>
A polyurethane solution 820 is injected through the air hole 847 and the air injection<br>
passage 846, such that the air injection passage 845 becomes a polyurethane solution injection<br>
path 846 during the polyurethane solution injection process. Before injecting the<br>
polyurethane solution 820, the polyurethane solution is blended with a polyether-based polyol<br>
containing isocyanate prepolymer, determined catalytic and foaming agent, in a ratio of 1:3 at<br>
a high speed (impellar rpm; 6,000). At this time of blending, the polyurethane solution 820<br>
has a weight of 25g that is determined by multiplying the volume of the space, i.e., the inner<br>
cavity, formed by the internally-formed surface 842 and a desired gravity. Accordingly, the<br>
blended material of the polyurethane solution 820 and the polyether-based polyol is injected<br>
into the inner cavities 842 through the air hole 847 and the polyurethane solution injection<br>
path 846. After the blended material injection, the foam 840 and the injected blended<br>
material are cured for about 8 minutes in the aluminum molding die 830 without applying<br>
heat additionally, and then the foam 840 is de-molded from the molding die 830, thereby<br>
forming a composite foam 850 integrally interconnected with the polyurethane. As shown in<br><br>
the cross section of FIG. 9, a composite inner formed layer 854 including a foamed<br>
polyurethane 853 is formed in a grid type structure in an inside 852 of the foam 850. The<br>
grid-shaped inner-formed layer 854 is disposed at a depth of 3mm from a surface 851 of the<br>
composite foam 850. Additionally, the foamed polyurethane 853 filled in the composite<br>
inner-formed layer 854 has a diameter of 4mm.<br>
According to the eighth embodiment of the present invention, a variety of materials<br>
can be substituted for the polyurethane. For example, polyester or polyether based urethane<br>
material having a variety of densities and molecular structures can be utilized. Further, a<br>
variety of plastic resins, a natural and/or synthetic rubbery material including urethane rubber,<br>
silicon rubber and latex (SBR, NBR, BR, Acrylate Latices), a plaster material, a clay material,<br>
or other minerals can be used instead of the polyurethane. Such materials may be injected<br>
into the inner cavities, inserted, joined or attached thereto, and formed integrally with the<br>
foam. Thus-obtained foam can directly be used as industrial components, or compression re-<br>
molded, if necessary, to reform the shape of the composite foam.<br>
In cases when an EVA based foam and a polyurethane are integrated with each other,<br>
the weaknesses of the polyurethane material, e.g., decolorization, hydrolysis, bacteria<br>
corrosion, and heavy weight, can be eliminated such that a polyurethane material having a<br>
variety of properties and characteristics are effectively used. As a result, weak properties of<br>
materials are supplemented. Additionally, foams are molded even without using an additional<br>
molding die in accordance with the structure of the inner cavities and characteristics of<br>
materials injected in the inner cavities. Further, manufacturing procedures and costs can be<br>
reduced as compared with a conventional method where foams of different materials are<br>
individually molded and attached with each other through an additional process.<br><br>
A following table 6 shows a comparison of properties of composite cross-linked<br>
foam with the polyurethane injected into the inner cavities formed by the internally-formed<br>
surface of the EVA based foam. A letter A denotes the properties between the polyurethane<br>
material and the foam, and a letter B denotes the properties between the polyurethane<br>
materials.<br><br>
Ninth Embodiment<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates a manufacturing process of a cross-linked foam according to a<br>
ninth embodiment of the present invention. This ninth embodiment is a modification of the<br>
eighth embodiment. In the ninth embodiment, the same and different materials are injected<br><br>
into inner cavities formed by the internally-formed surface, and the injected materials are<br>
molded at both the inner cavities and the outer surface of the foam.<br>
Material Preparation: A sheet of white material 911a is injection-molded at a foam<br>
rate of 150%.<br>
Interfacing pattern Formation: A circle pattern having a diameter of 50mm is printed<br>
at the center of the material 911a. Additionally, vertical and horizontal lines having a length<br>
of 50mm are also printed inside the circle pattern along the diametric lines of the circle<br>
patterns. The circle pattern and the vertical and horizontal lines are formed of a urethane-<br>
resin-based ink at a thickness of approximately 50 micrometers, thereby completing an<br>
interfacing pattern 912. Thereafter, thus-obtained interfacing pattern 912 is thermal-dried at a<br>
temperature of 60 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes.<br>
Foaming Process: The material 91 la having the printed patterns is disposed into a<br>
cavity of a press type molding die, and then a residual space of the cavity is filled with a black<br>
particle type material 911b that has the same foaming rate as the material 911a. After<br>
disposing the material 911a and filling the black particle type material 911b, the press type<br>
molding die is closed, and then the heat and pressure are applied to the materials 911a and<br>
91 lb therein for foaming, thereby forming a cross-linked foam 940. After curing the foam to<br>
stabilize the physical properties, thus-obtained foam 940 has an internally-formed surface<br>
944a and 944b forming an inner cavity therein that is formed along the shape of the<br>
interfacing pattern 912. The internally-formed surfaces have a circularly shaped portion 944a<br>
and a linearly shaped portions 944b.<br>
The foam 940 having the irrternally-formed surface 944a and 944b is punched from a<br>
surface of the foam 940 to form four holes 942 at positions where the circularly shaped<br><br>
portion 944a meets the linearly shaped portions 944b. Each of the four holes 942 has a<br>
diameter of 2mm. Further, another hole 942 having a diameter of 3mm is formed at a<br>
position where the linearly shaped portions 944b cross to each other. After the punching<br>
process of forming the holes 942, the foam 940 is inserted into a cavity of a injection-type<br>
molding die while adjusting the hole 942 of 3mm diameter to correspond to a material<br>
injection path 946 of the injection-type molding die. Thereafter, a nozzle 962 of a material<br>
injector 960 is disposed to correspond to the material injection path 946 of the injection-type<br>
molding die, and then a material 964 different from the foam material, e.g., a urethane-based<br>
resin, is injected through the nozzle 962. Thus, the material 964 is inserted into the inner<br>
cavities formed by the internally-formed surface 944 and a residual space of the injection-type<br>
molding die. After hardening the injected material 964, the injection-type molding die is<br>
opened and the foam is de-molded. As shown in FIG. 10, the foam becomes a composite<br>
foam that includes the urethane resin in the inner cavities. The urethane resin is extended<br>
from the inner cavities to a surface of the foam and the urethane resin on the surface is shaped<br>
along a shape of the cavity of the injection-type molding die. Thus-obtained foam can be<br>
directly used as industrial components, or compression re-molded if necessary, to reform the<br>
shape of the composite foam.<br>
Further, fabric, non-woven fabric, natural/synthetic leather, and rubber can be<br>
selectively attached to the surface of the cooled and cured foam 940 or a variety of pattern<br>
shapes can be attached to the surface of the foam. Thereafter, the surface of the foam can be<br>
perforated and then other materials may be injected into the inner cavities formed by the<br>
internally-formed surface 944 through perforations such that the injected material is extended<br>
from the inner cavities to the surface of the foam.<br><br>
As described above, materials are injected into the inner cavities 944a and 944b and<br>
molded integrally at the inside and outer surface of the EVA based foam. This results in<br>
aesthetic.enhancement and improvement in adhesion strength, product quality, properties and<br>
functions.<br>
Tenth Embodiment<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates a maiuvfacturing process of a cross-linked foam according to a<br>
tenth embodiment of the present invention. In this tenth embodiment, an internally-formed<br>
surface is divided into more than two parts in a wide variety of shapes.<br>
Material Preparation: Four sheets of flat-film-type materials 1011a, 1011b, 1011c<br>
and 101 Id are calender-molded at a foaming rate of 150%, and then cut into a shape having a<br>
thickness of 2.5mm, a width of 100mm and a length of 100mm. The first and second flat-<br>
film-type materials 1011a and 101 lb are perforated to form two holes 1012 having a diameter<br>
of 2mm.<br>
Interfacing pattern Formation; A urethane ink is printed on both surfaces of<br>
materials 1011a and 1011b in such a manner that margins of 10mm are arranged from the<br>
cutting edges of each direction. The cross section of the perforated portion is also covered by<br>
the urethane ink, and selected one side of materials 1011c and 1011d is printed, thereby<br>
forming an interfacing pattern 1021, Thereafter, thus-obtained interfacing pattern 1021 is<br>
dried.<br>
Foaming Process: The first and second materials 1011a and 1011b are attached to<br>
each other, and the printed sides of the third and fourth materials 1011c and 1011d are<br>
combined with the combination of the first and second materials 1011a and 1011b.<br><br>
Thereafter, the resultant structure is inserted into a cavity of a press or injection type molding<br>
die 1030, which has a width of 100, a length of 100mm and a depth of 10mm, and then heated<br>
and pressed so as to be foamed, thereby forming a foam 1040 after cooling and curing. The<br>
foam 1040 has a width of 150mm, a length of 150mm and a thickness of 15mm is. Further, a<br>
multi-layered internally-formed surface 1042 and two holes 1044 having a diameter of 3mm<br>
are formed in the foam. Thus, the internally-formed surface forming an inner cavity has the<br>
multi-layered structure of 120/120/3.5mm. Similar to the ninth embodiment, other materials<br>
can be injected into and filled in the inner cavities 942 and the hole 944.<br>
Eleventh Embodiment<br>
FIG. 12 illustrates a manufacturing process of a cross-linked foam according to an<br>
eleventh embodiment of the present invention. This eleventh embodiment is to provides a<br>
method of forming a three-dimensional internally-formed surface having a variety of curved<br>
shapes.<br>
Material Preparation: First and second materials 1111a and 1111b are injection- or<br>
compression-molded from a white particle material foamed at a foaming rate of 170%. The<br>
first and second materials 1111a and 1111b have bumpy surfaces. Also, a particle type<br>
material 1112 having a weight of 20g is prepared.<br>
Interfacing pattern Formation: An enamel-based ink is sprayed on both sides of the<br>
first bumpy material 1111a except a masking portion 1113, and then dried. The sprayed ink<br>
has a thickness of 40micrometers.<br>
Foaming Process: The dried material 1111a is combined with the second bumpy<br>
material 1111b, and the combination of the first and second bumpy materials 1111a and<br><br>
1111b is inserted into a cavity 1132 of a press-type molding die 1130. Thereafter, aresidual<br>
space 1134 of the cavity 1132 is filled with the particle type material 1112. Then, the<br>
combination and the particle type material 1112 are together heated and pressed in the press-<br>
type molding die 1130 to be foamed, thereby forming a foam 1140. The foam 1140 has a<br>
curved internally-formed surface 1142 at an inside 1141, as shown in FIG. 12.<br>
Twelfth Embodiment<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates a manufacturing process of a cross-linked foam according to a<br>
twelfth embodiment.<br>
Material Preparation: A first material 1211a is injection- or compression-molded<br>
using a particle-type material at a foaming rate of 130%, and second and third materials<br>
1211b and 1211c are also prepared at a foaming rate of 150% using the same material and<br>
method as the first material 1211a.<br>
Interfacing pattern Formation: A urethane-based ink including a 5% foaming agent<br>
is sprayed on a whole surface of the first material 1211a at a thickness of 30 micrometers, and<br>
then dried.<br>
Foaming Process: The first material 1211a covered by the interfacing pattern is<br>
combined with the second and third materials 1211b and 1211c, and then the combination<br>
thereof is inserted into a cavity 1232 of a press-type molding die 1230. Thereafter, the<br>
combination is heated and pressed so as to be foamed, thereby forming a foam 1240. Then,<br>
the obtained foam 1240 is cooled down and cured.<br>
Although the first material 121 la is foamed simultaneously with the second and third<br>
materials 1211b and 1211c, mere exists a space between the foamed first material and the<br><br>
internally-formed surfacel242 due to the fact that the foaming rate of the first material 1211a<br>
is lower than that of the second and third materials 1211b and 1211c by approximately 20%.<br>
Therefore, a separated inner part 1243 derived from the first material 1211a can easily be<br>
taken out of the internally-formed surface, and a predetermined space 1250 can be obtained.<br>
The formed space 1250 is exposed outward such that other foam of different material can be<br>
inserted and filled into this space 1250.<br>
Thirteenth Embodiment<br>
FIG. 14 illustrates a manufacturing process of a cross-linked foam according to a<br>
thirteenth embodiment of the present invention. The thirteenth embodiment is to provide an<br>
internally-formed surface connected or opened to the outside in more than one direction.<br>
Material Preparation: A film-type material 1311 is calender-molded at a foaming rat<br>
of 150% to have a size of 1mm thickness, 20 inches widths and 20mm lengths. Thereafter,<br>
the film-type material 1311 is taken up on a roll.<br>
Interfacing pattern Formation: A colorless PVA resin based ink is gravure-printed<br>
onto one surface of the film-type material 1311 at a thickness of 30 micrometers so as to form<br>
an interfacing pattern 1312, and then the resultant structure having the interfacing pattern<br>
1312 is thermal-dried at a temperature of 60 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes. Thereafter, the<br>
dried material is taken up on a re-heating roll 1320 that is formed of aluminum and includes a<br>
heater.<br>
Foaming Process: The material 1311 wound on the re-heating roll 1320 is inserted<br>
into cavities 1331 and 1332 of a press-type molding die 1330 where a heater is installed.<br>
Each of the cavities 1331 and 1332 has a half cylindrical shape, such that a half of the wound<br><br>
material 1331 is inserted into the first cavity 1331 of the upper part of the molding die 1330<br>
and the other half of the wound material 1331 is inserted into the second cavity 1332 of the<br>
other molding die part. After inserting the material 1331, the press-type molding die 1330 is<br>
closed, and then the inserted material 1331 is heated and pressed at a temperature of 150<br>
degrees Celsius under a pressure of 150kg/cm2 so as to be foamed. After being de-molded<br>
from the press-type molding die, a roll-type foam 1340 is formed and then sequentially cured<br>
at a temperature of 40 degrees Celsius for 2 hours to stabilize the size and the physical<br>
properties. After that, the foam 1340 is unwound from the re-heating roll 1320 and then re-<br>
wound on a winding beam 1350, thereby forming a foam having a uniform cross section and a<br>
continuous shape. This thirteenth embodiment allows a formation of a form having a uniform<br>
and continuous cross section, which was not likely to be done through a conventional pressure<br>
cross-linked foaming method.<br>
Fourteenth Embodiment<br>
FIG. 15 illustrates a process of manufacturing a cross-linked foam according to a<br>
fourteenth embodiment of the present invention. The fourteenth embodiment is to provide an<br>
internally-formed surface having multiple-plane structure,<br>
Material Preparation: Three sheets of film-type materials 1411a, 1411b and 1411c<br>
are calender-molded at a foaming rate of 150% using the same material. Each of the film-<br>
type materials 1411a-1411c has'a thickness of 2rnm. The maxinrum dimensions of each of<br>
the fust, second and third materials 1411a, 1411b and 1411c is 100x100mm. It is desirable<br>
that the first 1411a have a width of 100mm and a length of 100m, the second material have a<br><br>
width of 90mm and a length of 90mm and the third material 141 lc have a width of 80mm and<br>
a length of 80mm, for example.<br>
Interfacing pattern Formation: A urethane-base ink is screen-printed on one surface<br>
of each of the second and third materials 1411b and 1411c with a margin being spaced apart<br>
from the side edges by a distance of 5mm except from a certain edge, thereby forming an<br>
interfacing pattern 1421. Thereafter, the resultant structure is dried.<br>
Foaming Process: The first to third materials 141 la-141 lc are sequentially attached<br>
in such a manner that the interfacing patterns 1421 formed on their surfaces are arranged in an<br>
upper direction so as not to face each other as shown in FIG. 15. The second material 1411b<br>
is inserted between the first and third materials 1411a and 1411c, thereby forming a<br>
combination 1410. After that, the combination 1410 is inserted into a cavity 1432 of a press-<br>
type molding die 1430, and then heated and pressed to be foamed. After the foaming process,<br>
a foam 1440 is formed and de-molded from the press-type molding die 1430. And then, the<br>
foam is cured and cooled down at a temperature of 40 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes.<br>
The foam 1440 has a size of 150mm width, 150mm length and 3mm thickness, and<br>
has a bottom surface 1441a, a middle surface 1441b and a top surface 1441c. The bottom<br>
surface 1441a that is larger than the middle surface 1441b is derived from the first film-type<br>
material 1411a, the middle surface 1441b that is larger than the top surface 1441c is derived<br>
from the second film-type material 1411b, and the top surface 1441c is derived from the third<br>
material 1411c, whereby the sides of the foam 1440 have steps due to the size difference<br>
thereof. As shown in FIG. 15, the foam 1440 has a double-layered internally-formed surface<br>
1442b and 1442c which are opened in different directions as indicated by arrows. This<br>
internally-formed surface shown in FIG. 15 could not actually be accomplished by the<br><br>
conventional pressure cross-linked foaming method or normal pressure cross-linked foaming<br>
method, but this fourteenth embodiment makes it possible.<br>
Fifteenth Embodiment<br>
FIG. 16 illustrates a manufacturing process of a cross-linked foam according to a<br>
fifteenth embodiment of the present invention. The fifteenth embodiment is to provide a<br>
method in which the foam having an internally-formed surface is formed on a different<br>
material at a time.<br>
Material Preparation: A first film-type material 1511a is calender-molded at a<br>
thickness of 2mm and cut into a circular shape having a diameter of 1 Omm.<br>
Interface Formation: A urethane-resin-based ink is printed onto the circular-shaped<br>
material 1511a in a shape of circle having a diameter of 3mm and a thickness of 50<br>
micrometers, and then dried.<br>
Foaming Process: A second film-type material 1511b that also has a circular shape<br>
is combined with the first film-type material 1511a having the interfacing pattern 1511a<br>
thereon, and then a combination 1510 of the first and second film-type materials 1511a and<br>
1511b is inserted into a cavity of a press-type molding die 1530. After that, the combinations<br>
1510 is coved by a polyester-based synthetic textile 1520 having a thickness of 1mm, and<br>
then a top cover 1541 of the molding die 1540 is closed. The combination 1510 is heated and<br>
pressed, and therefore a portion of the combination 1510, especially the first film-type<br>
material 151 la, is molten, infiltrated into a surface 1521 of the textile 1520 and adhered to the<br>
surface of the textile 1520. Generally, the combination 1510 is foamed in a thick-wise<br>
direction when the molding die 1540 is opened, thereby forming a foam 1540.<br><br>
After the de-molding, the foam 1540 is formed on the surface 1521 of the textile<br>
1520, and has an internally-formed surface 1542, which is filled with air, at an inside 1541 of<br>
the foam 1540. This Fifteenth embodiment can be applied to polyester-based synthetic fiber,<br>
textile, non-woven fabric, artificial leather and natural leather. Further, the inner cavity can<br>
be modified into a wide variety of shapes according to the fifteenth embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Sixteenth Embodiment<br>
FIG. 17 illustrates a manufacturing process of a cross-linked foam according to a<br>
sixteenth embodiment of the present invention The sixteenth embodiment is to provide a<br>
method where a material for inner cavity is extrusion-molded.<br>
Material Preparation: A red pellet type material, which is formed from a material by<br>
a foaming rate of 170%, is injected into an extruder and then heated in a cylinder to be molten.<br>
The molten material is compressed by a screw and discharged throvtgh a tube-type die. The<br>
discharged material is solidified by a cooling device to be red pipe-type material 1611a that<br>
has a 5mm outer diameter and a 2.5mm inner diameter.<br>
Interfacing pattern Formation: An enamel-based transparent ink including a 10%<br>
foaming agent is injected into the inside of the red pipe-type material 1611a and then coated<br>
on the inner surface of the red pipe-type material 1611a so as to form an interfacing pattern<br>
1620. After that, the enamel-based transparent ink is dried.<br>
Foaming Process: The resultant red pipe-type material 1611a is cut into 5 pieces,<br>
and then combined with a white material 1611b that is similar to the injection- or<br>
compression-molded white material 1111b of the eleventh embodiment, thereby producing a<br><br>
combination 1610. After that, the combination 1610 of the red pipe-type material 1611a and<br>
the white material 161 lb is inserted into a cavity 1632 of a press-type molding die 1630, and<br>
then a residual space of the cavity 1632 is filled with a white particle-type material 1650 that<br>
has the same foaming rate as the red pipe-type material 1611. The inserted combination 1610<br>
and white particle-type material 1650 are then heated and pressed so as to form a foam 1640.<br>
During the foaming process, the hollow portion of the red pipe-type material 1611a<br>
is recessed and then becomes an internally-formed surface 1642 having a diameter of 4mm.<br>
The internally-formed surface 1642 forms an inner cavity. Namely, the white foam 1640<br>
includes the five internally-formed surfaces 1642. If the diameter of the inner cavities is<br>
between 4 to 8 mm, the foam is formed in a red color.<br>
A cross-linked foaming method of the present invention provides a wide variety of<br>
inner cavity structure integrally formed with the foam. The cross-linked foam produced by<br>
the present invention mainly comprises the form body and the inner cavity structure at an<br>
inside of the foam body. The shape of the inner cavity structure may be determined by the<br>
internally-formed surface that are classified into a closed type and an open type.<br>
In the closed type, the internally-formed surface is disposed inside the foam body<br>
and the internally-formed surface is closed. However, the internally-formed surface of the<br>
open type extends to the surface of the foam to communicate with the outside.<br>
The foam body may have air passage communicating with the inner cavities, such<br>
that the air or gas can freely keep up the stream from the outside into the inner cavities or vise<br>
versa. Further, the foam body may have a valve system in the air passage so as to control a<br>
flow of the air, gas or vapor, wherein the valve system may have a check valve. The number<br><br>
and shape of the air passage and valve are not limited, and many other modifications and<br>
variations are possible for them.<br>
One or more of the material that is the same as or different from the foam body may<br>
be filled or inserted into the inner cavity structure. Thus, the foam may have various physical<br>
properties depending on its parts.<br>
FIGS. 18 to 39 illustrates diverse examples of the cross-linked foam according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
FIGS. 18 to 27 shows cross-linked foams that are formed by foaming a combination<br>
of flat type materials having interfacing patterns 1711a to 1711j and other materials. As<br>
shown in FIGS. 18 to 27, each of the cross-linked foams has a foam body and an inner cavity<br>
structure formed by an internally-formed surface.<br>
The inner cavity structure of the foams shown in FIGS. 18 to 27 may be filled with<br>
gas or air in such a manner that the external gas or air is injected thereto using an injector as<br>
described with reference to FIG. 4, thereby properly controlling a pressure of the inner cavity<br>
structure. Further, as illustrated with reference to FIG. 5, an air passage communicating with<br>
the inner cavity structure may be formed in such a cross-linked form, and a check valve may<br>
be installed in the air passage.<br>
FIGS. 28 to 30 shows cross-linked foams that are formed by way of piling up flat<br>
type materials having interfacing patterns 1711k to 17111, combining the piled flat type<br>
materials with other materials, and then foaming the combination. As shown in FIGS. 28 to<br>
30, each of the cross-linked foams has a foam body and a complex structure of inner cavities<br>
that is formed by an internally-formed surface.<br><br>
FIGS. 31 to 38 shows cross-linked foams that are formed by way of foaming a<br>
combination of a foaming material (dotted portion in the figure) and a three-dimensional<br>
material having interfacing patterns. As shown in FIG. 83 to 38, each of the cross-linked<br>
foams has a foam body and a three-dimensional structure in an inner cavity structure formed<br>
by the internally-formed surface. Although FIGS. 31 to 38 illustrates the foam body and the<br>
three-dimensional inner formed structure that are simultaneously formed by the foaming<br>
process, it is possible that the three-dimensional structure is formed separately from the cross-<br>
linked foam body and then inserted into the inner cavity formed by the internally-formed<br>
surface.<br>
FIG. 39 illustrates materials having three-dimensional shapes for forming the inner-<br>
formed structures of FIGS. 31 to 38.<br>
Meanwhile, various physical properties are compared in between the cross-linked<br>
foam produced by the following inventive method and that produced by the conventional<br>
method.<br>
Urethane ink is printed by a silkscreen method on a film-type material that has a<br>
foaming rate of 150% and a size of 24mm width, 24mm length and a 1mm thickness. The<br>
urethane ink is formed at a thickness of 50 micrometers, thereby forming an interfacing<br>
pattern having a size of 20mm width and 20mm length. One sheet of material is formed on a<br>
front surface of the film-type material, and five sheets of materials are formed on a rear<br>
surface of the film-type material, thereby forming a combination, where those materials are<br>
the same as the film-type material. The combination is inserted into a cavity of a molding die,<br>
which has a 24mm width, a 24mm length and a 7mm depth. After that, the combination is<br>
heated and pressed at a temperature of 165 degrees Celsius under a pressure of 150Kg/cm2 for<br><br><br><br>
surface hardness and a large repulsive elasticity rather than the foam of the conventional<br>
method due to the fact that it has a inner formed cavity structure in the foam.<br>
When the foam manufactured throughout the aforementioned methods is combined<br>
with other material such as fiber and artificial leather and when the combination of such<br>
materials is compressed and re-molded, the volume of the foam is reduced at a predetermined<br>
compression ratio, and a difference of the properties, such as the surface hardness and the<br>
elasticity, between the re-molded portion of the foam and the inner cavity structure filled with<br>
air becomes further increased. This shows significant differences between the foam<br>
manufactured by the conventional foam molding method (i.e., primary process) and the foam<br>
manufactured by a compression re-molding method (i.e., secondary process). A following<br>
Table 8 shows such differences.<br><br><br><br>
Meanwhile, the cross-linked foam manufactured by the above-mentioned methods<br>
will be applicable to the shoe components or other goods in many ways. Hereinafter, the<br>
wide rage of such foam usage will be described in detail.<br>
FIGS. 40 to 45 illustrates exemplary applications of the cross-linked foam of the<br>
present invention to many parts of a shoe.<br>
i) Upper - This upper component constitutes the upper part of a shoe, and includes an<br>
outer surface and an inner surface that are attached to each other. The out surface is generally<br>
made of a natural/synthetic leather, Fiber, textile, rubber, non-woven fabric, and a synthetic<br>
resin, and the inner surface is made of a PU, PE, latex, sponges, non-woven fabric, and<br>
textile. , When the foam or re-molded foam of the present invention is combined with the<br>
above-mentioned upper component, the weight of the upper is reduced, and also the<br>
supporting force, air permeability, buffering, shape stability and tightness are improved.<br>
Moreover, such physical properties can be differentiated depending on each part of the foam.<br>
ii) Inner sole - This inner sole component is disposed under the sockliner of the shoe,<br>
and absorbs the moisture generated from a foot of a wearer. In the conventional art, the<br>
leather, cellulose board, no-woven fabric or other textile is used for this inner sole, or a piece<br>
of steel plate and a trimmed sponge are attached to the inner sole of the boots or other<br>
specialized shoes so as to raise the hardness of the heal portion and the flexibility of the<br>
forefoot portion. However, the inner sole formed of the foam of the present invention reduces<br><br>
the component weight and makes it possible to obtain the improved air permeability or to<br>
differentiate the flexibility and hardness in each part of component.<br>
iii) Midsole - This midsole is a main component of a sole-bladder for the sport shoes,<br>
slippers, sandals or casual shoes, and made of the EVA, PU or rubbers so as to improve the<br>
shock absorbance and repulsive elasticity.<br>
When the foam of the present invention is adopted for the shoe midsole, the weight<br>
of the shoe is reduced because the inner cavities formed by the internally-formed surface<br>
contain the air layers. Further, the midsole can be formed of primary foam or a re-molded<br>
foam after the cutting, grinding and attaching process, whereby the shoes can have a diverse<br>
appearance and various properties and functions.<br>
The midsole can be easily manufactured by using the foam described with reference<br>
to FIG. 9 (the eighth embodiment) where the material is injected into the inner cavity so as to<br>
produce a complex midsole combined with a composite material. Additionally, the midsole<br>
can be easily formed of the foam described with reference to FIG. 10 (the ninth embodiment)<br>
where the material injected from an exterior is cross-link-foamed integrally with the inner<br>
formed surface and the outer surface of the foam.<br>
If the foam of the present invention is properly modified or combined for the midsole<br>
to achieve the desired properties and design, the midsole can act as and substitute for a later-<br>
described outsole.<br>
iv) Outsole - This outsole component is mainly used for shoes that require resistances<br>
against abrasion and friction. The outsole can be easily manufactured by using the primary-<br>
molded foam or the re-molded foam of the present invention. When the foam formed through<br><br>
the ninth embodiment is applied to the outsole, the shoes can obtain the lightweight and the<br>
various properties and functions.<br>
v) Sock or Sockliner - This component is generally inserted into the shoe and<br>
disposed on the inner sole. The sock or sockliner directly contacts the foot such that this<br>
component requires properties such as the shock absorbing forces, supporting forces,<br>
repulsive elasticity, stability and moisture absorbing forces.<br>
When the foam of the present invention is used for the sock or sockliner, the weight<br>
of the shoe is reduced because of the inner cavity structure the air layers. Namely, the foam of<br>
the present invention used for the sock or sockliner allows easy enhancement of properties<br>
and functions in every part of the sockliner to be acquired. The foam of the present invention<br>
is attached to other materials, such as textile, non-woven fabric and natural/synthetic leather,<br>
so as to be used as the sockliner.<br>
vi) Foam padding - This component is a cushioning member for improving the<br>
buffering, wear comfort and heat insulation of the shoes. The foam padding adopting the<br>
foam of the present invention can protect the ankle, instep and outside of the food. Namely,<br>
the foam padding can be easily provided with the improved properties and functions by using<br>
the foam of the present invention.<br>
vii) Stiffener - This component is inserted to the upper so as to prevent distortions of<br>
the upper and protect the heel and ankle. The stiffener can be easily provided with the<br>
improved properties and functions by using the foam of the present invention.<br>
viii) Instep pad or tongue - This component has the similar functions as the foam<br>
padding described above.<br><br>
ix) Molded component - This component increases the shock absorbing forces,<br>
duration forces and supporting forces of the upper so as to achieve the functional<br>
enhancement of shoes, or improves the appearance of the shoe. This molded component is<br>
separately molded to be attached to a portion of the upper. Namely, the molded component<br>
can be formed of the foam manufactured by the present invention, and coupled to portions of<br>
the upper.<br>
In the conventional art, a natural/synthetic leather, fiber, textile, rubber, non-woven<br>
fabric, or synthetic resin is compression-molded or extruded in a various shape to be used for<br>
such molded component, and then the molded or extruded material is combined with other<br>
adhesive buffing material to be attached to the upper. However, the present invention adopts<br>
the foam described above singly or with other re-molded foam, and then attaches the foam to<br>
the upper of the shoe.<br>
FIG. 41 illustrates upper formed from an upper material 1810. The upper material<br>
1810 is first cut into a desired shape, and then the cut material is sewed with and attached to<br>
other materials to form the upper.<br>
FIG. 42 illustrates a manufacturing process of three-dimensional upper. A film-type<br>
material 1820 having a thickness of 1mm covers a metal last 1830 that has the foot shape.<br>
Then, the metal last 1830 covered by the film-type material 1820 is inserted in a cavity 1840<br>
of a molding die, and foamed by the pressure cross-linked foaming method. Therefore, the<br>
three-dimensional upper is completed.<br>
FIG. 43 illustrates upper obtained by attaching or sewing the inner sole to the three-<br>
dimensional upper of FIG. 42.<br><br>
FIGS. 44 and 18F are cross section views illustrating a shoe that is obtained by<br>
attaching a midsole, an outsole and a sockliner to the three-dimensional upper of FIG. 43.<br>
The above-described components are used herein so as to effectively explain<br>
embodiments of the present invention, and the types of shoes are not restricted by those<br>
components. The components can be selectively used or modified so as to manufacture shoes<br>
of a wide variety of uses and designs. For example, the upper can be simply connected to the<br>
midsole so as to manufacture slippers and sandals. The components can be applied to in-line<br>
skate shoes or ski shoes.<br>
Examples of upper structure<br>
FIGS. 46 to 50 illustrate exemplary applications of the cross-linked foam of the<br>
present invention to an upper of a shoe.<br>
FIG. 46 shows side and cross-sectional views of upper that is manufactured by one<br>
the aforementioned third, thirteenth and fifteenth embodiments. A foam having an inner<br>
cavity structure 1911 is independently disposed on a textile 1912, thereby forming a<br>
intermediate structure. An additional stuff 1913, such as textile or natural/synthetic leather, is<br>
attached to the surface of the intermediate structure, and then the intermediate structure<br>
including the additional stuff 1913 is re-molded or punched to form holes 1914 for an air flow,<br>
completing the upper. Other components may be attached to the upper for decoration.<br>
FIG. 47 shows side and cross-sectional views of upper that is manufactured by one<br>

different from a foam is injected into an inner cavity formed by an internally-formed surface<br>
1921. Alternatively, the foam is punched to have a hole 1924 to the inner cavity 1921, and<br>
the material 1922 is injected into the inner cavity 1921 and formed both in the inner cavity<br><br>
1921 and on the surface of the foam. Therefore, the upper having various properties is<br>
complete. Also the upper may be attached with other components.<br>
FIG. 48 shows side and cross-sectional views of upper that is manufactured by one of<br>
the aforementioned first and second embodiments. A foam having an inner cavity 1931 is<br>
provided, and then a material 1932 different from the foam is attached to the foam before or<br>
after perforating to the inner cavity 1931 to form a hole 1934. Also, the foam having the<br>
material 1932 and the hole 1934 may be re-molded. Thus, the upper having the air circulation<br>
system and buffering functional system can be obtained.<br>
FIG. 49 shows upper that is manufactured by one of the twelfth and fourteenth<br>
embodiments. The upper of FIG. 48 is formed to have an air circulation system, and<br>
combined with other components to improve properties and functionality.<br>

performed to form a hole 1952 to the inner cavity 1951. Thereafter, other desired material<br>
1954 is attached to the foam so as to achieve tire improved buffering and heat insulating<br>
performances. Thus, the upper of FIG. 50 is complete.<br>
Example of inner sole structure<br>
FIG. 51 illustrates an exemplary application of the cross-linked foam of the present<br>
invention to an inner sole of a shoe.<br>
The foam having an inner cavity structure 2020 is joined with a material 2010, for<br>
example, a leather plate, a cellulose plate, a non-woven fabric, or textile. Thereafter, the foam<br>
jointed with the material 2010 is perforated to form holes 2030 that expose the imier cavity<br><br>
2020 or penetrate the foam, such that the foam can have the improved air ventilation and the<br>
moisture discharge. Especially, an example (b) of FIG. 51 has different flexibility and<br>
hardness in the forefoot and heel portions of the inner sole. Additionally, an example (c) of<br>
FIG. 51 has a required hardness in a specific desired portion by way of injecting other<br>
material(s).<br>
Example of midsole structure<br>
FIGS. 52, 53 and 54 illustrate exemplary applications of the cross-linked foam of the<br>
present invention to a midsole of a shoe.<br>
Foams or re-molded foams, which have a variety of inner cavity structure 2110, are<br>
shown in FIG. 52. Holes 2120 are formed in the foams or remolded foams, and a valve 2130<br>
is attached to the foam around the hole 2120. Examples (v), (vii) and (ix) show that a<br>
material 2140 different from the foam is injected into the inner cavity 2110. An example (x)<br>
shows a method that separates a portion 2150 from the foam or re-molded foam.<br>
FIG. 53 illustrates shoes including the midsole of the present invention, and FIG. 54<br>
are cross-sectional views illustrating the foam structure. The midsoles of FIGS. 53 and 54 are<br>
obtained by cutting or grinding the panel-shaped foam. The obtained midsole can be used in<br>
an entire portion 2210 or a part 2220 of the shoe outsale, e.g., in the slippers or sandals. The<br>
midsole has an inner cavity structure 2230 that has a wide variety of shapes, and an inner<br>
cavity structure 2240 that is formed of composite materials. The inner cavity structure 2240<br>
can be exposed outward so as to achieve the improved functionality and aesthetic<br>
enhancement of the midsole. The present invention permits shoe component to be formed by<br><br>
assembling the foam having the cut surface and an inner cavity containing air layers, as<br>
shown in an example (ii) of FIG. 53.<br>
Example of outsole structure<br>
FIG. 55 shows exemplary outsoles that adopt the foams of the present invention. As<br>
shown, primary foam or secondary foam which has a variety of inner cavity structure 2310 is<br>
used for the shoe outsole. A hole 2320 is formed in such foams and a valve 2330 is installed<br>
in the foam around the hole 2320. A material 2340 different from the foam is injected into<br>
the foam to be attached to the inner cavity 2310, or a material 2350 also different from the<br>
foam is inserted into the inner cavity 2310.<br>
Example of sock or sockliner structure<br>
FIG. 56 illustrates exemplary shock or sockliner that adopts the foams of the present<br>
invention. As shown, examples (a), (b) and (c) show the entire shock, the half of the shock,<br>
and the heel part, respectively.<br>
An example (d) of FIG. 56 is a cross-sectional view of a shock where one or more of<br>
a variety of materials 2410 is attached. A valve 2420 is installed in the foam body of the<br>
shock so as for an inner cavity to inhale an external air. In the forefoot part of the sockliner, a<br>
plurality of ventilation holes 2430 are formed in order to achieve the air circulation of the<br>
inner cavity structure 2440. Namely, the sockliner has the structure where air inlet/discharge<br>
can be repeatedly performed when the volume of an inner cavity 2440 contracts/expands by a<br>
pressure applied from an external source.<br><br>
The present invention allows for manufacture of sock or sockliner that has a wide<br>
variety of air flow directions and structures in accordance with the structure of the inner<br>
cavity.<br>
Examples (i) to (viii) of FIG. 56 are cross-sectional views illustrating the sock or<br>
sockliner that have a wide variety of properties and functions. One or more of the materials<br>
2410 is attached to a foam body, and a plurality of holes 2430 are formed therein. A material<br>
2450 different from the foam is injected into the inner cavity to achieve the variety of<br>
properties and functions.<br>
Example of foam padding or instep pad structure<br>
FIGS. 57 and 58 illustrate exemplary foam padding and instep pad, respectively,<br>
which adopts the foams of the present invention. As shown, the foam for the foam padding<br>
and instep pad has air layers 2510 and 2610 in various shapes. Also the foams have foreign<br>
materials 2520 and 2620 in the inner cavity structure, holes 2530 and 2630 penetrating the<br>
foam or the inner cavity, and valves 2540 around the holes 2530.<br>

along line A-A, respectively. Examples (i) to (vii) of FIG. 59 are cross-sectional views<br>
illustrating inner cavity structure of the stiffer.<br>
In the conventional art, a lightweight synthetic resin is inserted in the leather and<br>
then a cushiony is attached to the leather to form the stiffener. However, the present<br><br>
invention provides a foam 2710 having an inner cavity structure 2720 where a separately-<br>
made foam 2730 is inserted or a foreign material 2740 different from the foam is injected.<br>
The injected foreign material 2740 may extend to the surface of the foam to form a protrusion<br>
2750, Further, an air layer 2760, a ventilation hole 2770 and valves 2780 may be formed<br>
installed in the foam of the present invention so as to control the density and hardness of the<br>
stiffener.<br>

The molded component of the conventional art includes a leathery material or a<br>
synthetic resin composite, which is designed and cut into various letters and logos, and a<br>
buffering material. However, the molded component of the present invention adopts a foam<br>
that has air layers 2810 and/or inserted composite materials 2820 to obtain a variety of<br>
densities and hardness. Also a foreign material 2830 different from the foam may be attached<br>
or printed onto the molded component. A plurality of holes 2840 may be formed to the inner<br>
cavity structure of the foam according to the present invention.<br>

[INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY]<br>
The present invention described above provides the foam that is made of a composite<br>
material, and easily controls the density in every pails of the foam. Thus, the foam<br>
manufactured by the present invention has the improved properties, such as hardness,<br>
repulsive elasticity and shock absorbance, and independent and various functionalities in<br>
different portions. The present invention eliminates the disadvantages of the conventional art<br>
in the foam fabrication, so the foam of the present invention can be designed in a various<br>
shape to have the functional diversity regardless that the foam is primary-molded or<br>
secondary-molded. The present invention allows the foam to have diverse properties and<br>
ventilating ability, although the foam is completed by a single foaming process unlike the<br>
conventional art. Since the single foaming process is able to produce the foam having diverse<br>
properties and functions, the fabrication process becomes much more stable and simple. Thus<br>
the defective-product proportion and the product costs are dramatically reduced with the<br>
raised product quality, and the mass production is achieved in the foam fabrication.<br><br>
Moreover, since the foam of the present invention has air layers therein to control the<br>
pressure of the inner cavity, the gravity, buffering, heat insulation and sound proofs are<br>
improved. Because the present invention permits materials to be easily applied to the inner or<br>
outer surface of a foam, the foam can be a composite material to have a superior ability in<br>
various fields. Further, the present invention reduces the environmental contamination and<br>
the waste amount generated during the manufacture of foams because the present invention<br>
foam is formed by a single foaming process while reducing overall processes.<br><br>
