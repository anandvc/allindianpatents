CLOSING DEVICE FOR BOTTLES AND,  IN PARTICULAR,  FOR BOTTLES OP ALCOHOL OR SPIRIT<br>
The present invention refers to a tamper-proof closing device for bottles and, in particular, for bottles of alcoholic drinks or spirits.<br>
Currently, different closing devices for bottles of alcoholic drinks are knave, generally made up of a cap and a pourer.<br>
The cap has an internal threading suitable for engaging, to open or close the bottle, with a corresponding threading foreseen on the outer surface of the pourer.<br>
The latter is fixed by pressure in the opening of the neck of the bottle or, through known means, to the neck of the bottle.<br>
Moreover, a further liner for covering the cap, made from aluminum foil or plastic,  is generally foreseen.<br>
In general, known closing devices also have an annular band provided with a predetermined breaking line to join the cap to the neck of the bottle before it is opened for the first time.<br>
The presence of this annular band is used to show whether the bottle has been opened previously. Indeed, the bottle cannot be opened without causing the aforementioned  annular  band  to  break,   at  the<br><br>
predetermined breaking line. Consequently, the breaking of the annular band indicates that the bottle has been opened previously.<br>
It is necessary to indicate whether a bottle has been opened previously since, once the bottle has been opened, it would be extremely simple to remove the pourer to alter the content of the bottle. Therefore, a requirement of the market is that the end customer can clearly recognize, be aware whether or not the bottle and, consequently, its content has been tampered with.<br>
In light of the above, it is clear that there is a need to have a closing device for bottles, like the one according to the present invention, which eliminates or at least reduces the possibility of any tampering with the bottle, i.e. opening it and consequently possibly altering or contaminating its content, not being immediately obvious.<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to solve the problems of the prior art, by providing a closing device for bottles that clearly and obviously shows whether a bottle has been opened at least once after its original manufacture.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a closing device for bottles that is simple and intuitive to use.<br>
Finally, another object of the present invention<br><br>
is to provide a closing device for bottles that is simple and cost-effective to make.<br>
These and other objects according to the present invention are accomplished by making a closing device for bottles and, in particular, for bottles of alcoholic drinks or spirits, as outlined in claim 1.<br>
Further characteristics of the closing device are set forth in the dependent claims.<br>
The characteristics and advantages of a closing device for bottles and, in particular, for bottles of alcoholic drinks or spirits, according to the present invention shall become clearer from the following description, given as a non-limiting example, referring to the attached schematic drawings, in which:<br>
-	figure 1 is a top side view partially in section of a closing device according to the present invention, mounted on the neck of a bottle, in a position before the first time it is opened;<br>
-	figure 2 is a top side view partially in section of the closing device of figure 1, in a position after the first time it is opened;<br>
-	figure 2B is an enlarged view of a detail of the closing device according to the present invention, in the configuration shown in figure 2;<br>
-	figure 2C is a perspective view in section of the closing device according to the present invention.<br><br>
in the configuration shown in figure 2;<br>
-	figure 3 is a perspective view of the cap of the<br>
closing device according to the present invention,<br>
before assembly of the device;<br>
-	figure 4 is a view from above of the cap of figure 3;<br>
-	figure 5 is a top side view of the cap of the device according to the present invention partially in section according to the line A-A of figure 4;<br>
-	figure 6 is a view from below of the cap of figure 3;	^	 <br>
-	figure 7 is a perspective view of the pourer of the closing device according to the present invention, before assembly of the device;<br>
-	figure 8 is a view from above of the pourer of figure 7;<br>
-	figure 9 is a top side view of the pourer of the device according to the present invention partially in section according to the B-B of figure 6.<br>
With reference to figures 1-2, a closing device for bottles and, in particular, for bottles of alcoholic drinks or spirits, according to the present invention, is shown, indicated as a whole with reference numeral 100.<br>
The closing device 100 comprises a cap 1, a pourer 2 equipped with drop-breaker 3 and a covering liner 4.<br><br>
The pourer 2 can be fixed to the neck of the bottle 5 in a known way.<br>
The liner 4, in a known way, is made up of a top portion or closing capsule 4' and a bottom portion 4" joined along an annular line 6 with predetermined breaking that is, necessarily, lacerated so that the bottle can open 5, separating the liner 4 into a capsule 4' and a bottom portion 4".<br>
The cap 1 comprises a flat top portion 7 med a tubular side portion 8 equipped with a threading suitable for engaging with a corresponding threading of the pourer 2. The engagement between the threading of the side portion 8 of the cap 1 and the threading of the pourer 2 determines the closing of the cap 1 on the pourer 2 and consequently of the closing device 100 on the neck of the bottle 5.<br>
The side portion 8 of the cap 1 extends from the top portion 7 up to beyond the predetermined breaking line 6 with its bottom end part.<br>
Also with reference to figures 3-6 and, in particular, to figure 2B, the cap 1 also comprises at least one security tab 9, joined to the top portion 7 of the cap 1 through a portion of low thickness 10 and substantially aligned with the side portion 8. Moreover, on the outward-facing surface of the security tab 9 there is an elastic tooth 11.<br><br>
In addition, on the top surface of the flat portion 7 and, more specifically, between the portion of low thickness 10 and the outer circumferential edge of such a flat portion 7, one or more projections 18 can be formed, which abut against the, bottom surface of the capsule 4' in the assembly step of the closing device 100. Preferably, there are as many projections 18 as there are security tabs 9.<br>
With reference to figure 1, during the assembly of the closing device 100, the cap 1 is mounted together with the remaining components of the closing device so that the free end of each security taco 9 abuts against the side of the pourer 2. For this to be possible, the elastic teeth 11 are free to take up their rest position (shown in figures 3-6), in which the free end of the elastic teeth 11 projects beyond the outer edge defined by the side portion 8 of the cap 1, After assembly between the cap 1 and the pourer 2 the covering liner 4 is also assembled onto the device 100. This pushes on the elastic teeth 11 causing them to contract.<br>
After the assembly of the device 100, it is associated with a bottle 5.<br>
Possibly, during assembly, it is possible to associate a bottom diffuser 12 and a valve and/or ball 13 with the pourer 2, as well as to equip the cap 1<br><br>
with a central pin 14 for interaction with said bottom diffuser 12.<br>
The first time the device 100 is opened, the cap l and the pourer 2 are separated, not only causing the predetermined breaking line 6 to break, but also moving the pourer 2 from the position of abutment against the free end of each security tab 9.<br>
Consequently, the security tabs 9, pushed by the elastic teeth 11, tilt towards the inside of the cap 1, bending at the portion of low thickness 10.<br>
When the device 100 is next closed on the neck of the bottle 5, the position taken up by the security tabs 9 interferes on top with an annular abutment plane 15 made on the outer surface of the pourer 2, and does not allow the pourer 2 to reach the upper limit switch and consequently does not allow the closing device 100 to close completely.<br>
In other words, the bending of the security tabs 9 towards the centre, as the cap 1 is closed up again, prevents the drop-breaker 3 from abutting on the top portion 7 of the cap 1, as however occurred before it had been opened.<br>
In this condition, the closing capsule 4' of the liner 4 remains separate with respect to the bottom portion 4" making the bottom end part 16 of the side portion 8 of the cap 1 visible and consequently clearly<br><br>
showing that the bottle 5 has been opened for the first time.<br>
In addition, pressing firmly on the capsule 4', in an attempt to take it as close as possible to the bottom portion 4" of the liner, causes the circumferential projections 18 to wedge into the flat top surface of the capsule 4' itself, making it even more obvious that the closing device 100 according to the invention has been opened. Indeed, as can easily be seen ir figure 2C, by pushing the capsule 4' firmly downwards the projections 18 pinch the capsule 4' itself, normally made with a thin layer of aluminium, unequivocally highlighting that the closing device 100 has been opened.<br>
  to an advantageous aspect of the present invention, it can be made even clearer that it has been opened giving the bottom end part 16 of the side portion 8 of the cap 1 a colour contrasting with the colour of the liner 4.<br>
The shape of the free end of each security tab 9 and that, of the annular abutment plane 15 of the pourer 2 are made so as to form a contact surface substantially perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of the cap 1, in this way avoiding the force exerted by the thrusting action of the annular abutment plane 15 of the pourer 2 on each security tab 9 being able to be<br><br>
subdivided into a radial component that would push the<br>
tab itself towards its original position.<br>
It should be understood that the fact that the<br>
pourer 2 does not reach the upper limit switch does not i  hinder the closing of the closing device 100 as far as<br>
its seal for the content of the bottle 5 is concerned.<br>
Indeed, on the top portion 7 of the cap 1 there is a<br>
cylindrical ridge 17 in contact on the outside with the<br>
inner wall of  the pourer  2,  both  in the  closed I  configuration before the bottle 5 has been opened for<br>
the first time, and, even if for a shorter length, in<br>
the closed configuration after the first time the<br>
bottle 5 has been opened.<br>
From the  description that has  been made  the 1  characteristics of the system object of the present<br>
invention are clear, just as the relative advantages<br>
are also clear, including:<br>
impossibility for the bottle to be opened<br>
without it being made obvious that this has occurred; I      - intuitive operation;<br>
-	simplicity of construction;<br>
-	relatively low manufacturing costs.<br>
Finally, it is clear that the closing device for bottles and, in particular, for bottles of alcoholic drinks or spirits, thus conceived, can undergo numerous modifications and variations, all of which are covered<br><br>
by the invention; moreover, all of the details can be replaced by technically equivalent elements. In practice, the materials used, as well as the sizes, can be whatever according to the technical requirements.<br><br>
