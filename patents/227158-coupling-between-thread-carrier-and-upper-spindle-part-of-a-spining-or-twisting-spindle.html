				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a coupling between thread carrier and upper spindle part of a<br>
spinning or twisting spindle and particularly relates to a coupling for the positive locking<br>
rotational taking along of a tube shaped carrier by means of a rotatable upper spindle part of a<br>
spinning or twisting spindle. The coupling comprises longitudinal ribs which project radially<br>
inwards from the inner shell of the thread carrier and serve simultaneously to center the thread<br>
carrier. It also has longitudinal grooves applied to the upper spindle part and assigned to the<br>
longitudinal ribs and has a groove base.<br>
A coupling of this type is prior art in German published patent application 102 48 930,<br>
corresponding to Indian Patent Application No.433/KOL/2003 dated 18th August 2003. The<br>
longitudinal ribs and the longitudinal grooves which engage with each other in the known<br>
coupling serve the rotational taking along of the thread carrier a well as its centring, whereby the<br>
longitudinal ribs are supported on the groove base. Because of the unavoidable tolerances<br>
between the longitudinal ribs arranged on the thread carrier and the unmachined groove base of<br>
the known coupling, the true running of the thread carrier is impaired.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to avoid this disadvantage and to create a coupling for the<br>
positive locking rotational taking along of a tube-shaped thread carrier by means of a rotational<br>
upper spindle part, in which a reliable centring of the thread carrier is also provided.<br>
This object has been achieved in that the longitudinal grooves are shorter at their end facing<br>
away from the spindle tips than the longitudinal ribs, and in that the groove base passes at this<br>
end into a groove free centring surface, on which the longitudinal ribs lie with a matched sliding<br>
fit.<br>
In the case of the coupling of the present invention, the functions of the positive locking<br>
rotational taking along and the centring of the thread carrier are separated. Because the upper<br>
spindle part is machined to an exact, pre-determinable diameter below the longitudinal grooves,<br>
the coupling itself is independent of any tolerances between the longitudinal ribs and the groove<br>
base. As the longitudinal ribs of the thread carrier, which are injection moulded together with<br>
the thread carrier, have to<br><br>
be deburred in any case, the longitudinal ribs can be machine cut to a cylindrical centring fit at<br>
no extra effort. In contrast, where the thread carrier is taken along to rotate in a positive lock,<br>
there can be a relatively approximate radial clearance.<br>
The longitudinal grooves advantageously have a stopper-like constriction in the direction towards<br>
the spindle tip, which, however, is wider than the width of the longitudinal ribs, whereby it is<br>
additionally provided that the longitudinal ribs end before the constriction in the direction towards<br>
the spindle tip. The longitudinal grooves are thus significantly wider beyond the constriction than<br>
the longitudinal ribs, so that the thread carrier can be turned on the upper spindle part to a<br>
slight extent until the longitudinal ribs lie on the walls of the assigned longitudinal grooves. Only<br>
thereafter does the positive locking rotational taking along come into effect. The stopper-like<br>
constriction prevents the thread carrier from traveling upwards due to the pulling forces of the<br>
thread during operation. The thread carrier, however, is not prevented from being removed from<br>
the non-moving upper spindle part when the longitudinal ribs no longer lie on the walls of the<br>
longitudinal grooves, as the width of the longitudinal grooves in the area of the constriction is still<br>
somewhat wider than the width of the longitudinal ribs.<br>
The present invention relates also to an upper spindle part of a spinning or twisting spindle<br>
comprising in the area of the spindle lip longitudinal grooves having a groove base, said<br>
longitudinal grooves action as a coupling element for a tube-shaped thread carrier. In relation to<br>
the upper spindle part, the present invention is characterized in that the groove base at the end<br>
of the longitudinal grooves facing away from the spindle tip passes into a groove-free centring<br>
surface for centring the thread carrier. For the purposes of the present invention, the longitudinal<br>
grooves have a stopper-like constriction in the direction towards the spindle tip. A spindle<br>
attacht, comprising the longitudinal grooves but not comprising the centring surface, is<br>
advantageously placed on the upper spindle part, whereby the spindle top piece comprises the<br>
spindle tip. The spindle top piece serves thus the positive locking rotational taking along of the<br>
thread carrier, while the centring surface assigned to the sliding fit is located outside of the<br>
spindle top piece. For the purposes of the present invention, the spindle top piece is injection<br>
moulded from plastic and attached onto the metal spindle shaft end.<br>
The present invention relates further to a tube-shaped thread carrier made of plastic, which<br>
extends up to an upper front surface slightly conical, comprising longitudinal<br><br>
ribs for coupling an upper spindle part of a spinning or twisting spindle, said<br>
longitudinal ribs projecting inwards from the inner shell of the thread carrier and<br>
simultaneously serving the centring of the thread carrier. The present invention is<br>
characterized in that the longitudinal ribs are injection moulded with the thread carrier<br>
and subsequently machine cut on their inner diameter to form a cylindrical centring<br>
fit. It is hereby provided that the longitudinal ribs, initally injection moulded to the<br>
upper front surface, are lathed down in an area between the front surface and a<br>
coupling position.<br>
ACCOMPANYING<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE^ DRAWINGS<br>
These and further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become more readily apparent from the following detailed description thereof when<br>
taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is an axial intersection of a thread carrier attached to an upper spindle part<br>
and having a coupling according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 is the upper spindle part of Figure 1 in the area of the coupling,<br>
Figure 3 is an axial intersection of the thread carrier in the area of the coupling,<br>
Figure 4 is in enlarged dimensions a cross-section in the area of the rotational taking<br>
along of the thread carrier along the intersectional surface IV-IV of Figure 1,<br>
Figure 5 is a similar cross-section in the area of the centring of the thread carrier<br>
along the intersectional surface V-V of Figure 1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
A tube-shaped thread carrier 2 is attached to an upper spindle part 1 of a spinning or<br>
twisting spindle. The thread carrier 2 is supported axially from below by a supporting<br>
surface 3 of the upper spindle part 1. During operation of the spindle, the thread<br>
carrier 2 is taken along via a positive locking coupling 4 by the rotating upper spindle<br>
part 1 in its rotational direction A. The coupling 4 is located in the upper area of the<br>
spindle.<br>
When the thread carrier 2 is being attached to the upper spindle part 1, the<br>
procedure is often that the thread carrier 2 is let fall for the last 50 mm. This can be<br><br>
done either during manual or automatic doffing. Alternatively, the thread carrier 2<br>
can of course be guided in a positive guiding manner onto the upper spindle part 1.<br>
The coupling 4 functions without radially movable parts and is a positive locking<br>
connection, which operates with longitudinal grooves 5 on the upper spindle part 1<br>
and longitudinal ribs 6 on the thread carrier 2. In the example shown there are six<br>
longitudinal grooves 5 overall, to which six longitudinal ribs 6 are assigned. These<br>
latter project from the inner shell 7 of the thread carrier 2 radially inwards, engage<br>
during operation in the longitudinal grooves 5 and are taken along in rotational<br>
direction A by positive locking.<br>
The width c of the longitudinal grooves 5 in the area of the positive locking rotational<br>
taking along of the coupling 4 is larger than the width b of the longitudinal ribs 6, so<br>
that the thread carrier 2 can be slighty turned on the upper spindle part 1. The initially<br>
tapering longitudinal grooves 5 widen undercut-like from the spindle tip 8 downwards,<br>
so that in both rotational directions a stopper 9, constricting the longitudinal groove 5<br>
is formed. A constriction 10 is hereby formed which has at its narrowest point a width<br>
e, which is wider than the width b of the longitudinal ribs 6, so that the thread carrier<br>
2 can be attached to the upper spindle part 1 and removed again therefrom without<br>
any difficulties. During operation of the spindle, the stoppers 9 serve the axial<br>
securing of the thread carrier 2, so that the thread carrier 2 does not travel upwards<br>
due to the pulling forces of the thread. This is why the longitudinal ribs 6 end before<br>
the stopper-like constriction 10 in the direction towards the spindle tip 8.<br>
In the case of the above mentioned well-known coupling, the longitudinal grooves<br>
and the longitudinal ribs serve not only the positive locking rotational taking along,<br>
but also the centring of the thread carrier, whereby the longitudinal ribs are supported<br>
on the groove base of the longitudinal grooves. It has been shown that the<br>
tolerances which occur here are uncontrollable in the case of the known coupling.<br>
This caused impairment in the true running of the thread carrier on the upper spindle<br>
part.<br>
According to the present invention it is now provided that the longitudinal grooves 5<br>
are shorter at their ends facing away from the spindle tip 8 than the longitudinal ribs<br>
6 and that the groove base 11 passes at this end into a groove free centring surface<br>
12, on which the longitudinal ribs 6 lie with a matched sliding fit 13. Thus the<br>
separation of the two functions centring and rotational taking along is effected. The<br><br>
rotational taking along takes place there where the longitudinal ribs 6 engage with the<br>
longitudinal grooves 5, while the groove-free centring surface 12 serves the centring function.<br>
Thus an independence of any tolerances between the longitudinal ribs 6 and the groove basell<br>
is achieved. The upper spindle part 1 can be machined below the longitudinal grooves 5 to an<br>
exact predetermined diameter, which corresponds to the inner diameter d of the longitudinal ribs<br>
6. As the longitudinal ribs 6 have to be machined anyway due to the burrs present during<br>
manufacture, this represents no great manufacturing effort.<br>
The tube-shaped thread carrier 2 tapers slightly conically up to a upper front surface 14. The<br>
longitudinal ribs are injection moulded together with the thread carrier 2 and subsequently<br>
machine cut on their inner diameter d to a cylindrical centring seat 15. The longitudinal ribs 6<br>
were originally injection moulded over the entire upper area 17 up to a front surface 14, see dot-<br>
dash depiction in Figure 3; they have, however, been lathed down between the front surface 14<br>
and the start of the coupling 4 and machined up to the lower end 16 of the longitudinal ribs 6.<br>
This provides a good true running of the thread carrier 2.<br>
A spindle top piece 18 made of plastic comprising the longitudinal grooves 5, but not, however,<br>
the centring surface 12 is attached to the spindle shaft end 19 of the upper spindle part 1. The<br>
spindle top piece 18 comprises the spindle tip 8. Thus separate components for the separate<br>
functions of positive locking rotational taking along and centring are provided.<br><br><br>
