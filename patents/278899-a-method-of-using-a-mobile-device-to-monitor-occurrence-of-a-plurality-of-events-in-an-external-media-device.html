DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Since mobile phones are popular in many homes and people also keep them in their vicinity most of the time, the probability of their presence near the user, when the user is using an external media device such as television or radio is very high. Therefore some methods are proposed wherein the programs being viewed/heard by the user can be monitored by the mobile device and usage information sent over the operator network.<br>
The information could be sent through communication methods which could be defined by the operator of the mobile network like SMS, MMS or could be sent over the internet if the mobile has internet connectivity.<br>
The profiles of several users could be accumulated at the network to detect loyalty of viewers to certain programs/channels.<br>
There could be privacy options which can have the user decide whether the user would like such information to be collected and/or sent from his mobile. The user is also given an option to decide subset of information to send.<br>
Several mechanisms are defined for identifying and sending this usage information:<br>
A.	The mobile could get the information about the program being viewed from the external media device through a short range bearer mechanism (such as BT, IR, UWB, WLAN) from the external media device. The bearer could also be a wired bearer (such as USB)<br>
B.	The mobile could get the information from internal applications. This is possible when the mobile is being used to control the external media device. (Example, if the mobile is being used as a remote control for a set top box, it can get information about the program being viewed on it).<br>
C.	The mobile can get the information from' auxiliary devices such as a remote control. For example, if the remote control of the external media device can be made capable of sending information such as channel number viewed, volume level (and other information such as given above). The bearer could also be a wired bearer (such as USB) or a short range wireless bearer (such as BT, IR, UWB, WLAN).<br>
«<br>
The mobile can get small clips of video and audio samples from the external media device through recording at sampled intervals with an encoding mechanism. Such mechanism includes those that enable media search (for example MPEG). Along with meta-information (mentioned above) these samples can be sent to a server and the media samples can be matched through media search algorithms (For example MPEG7 or MPEG21 searching mechanisms).<br>
The information that can be captured includes:<br>
a.	Channel information<br>
b.	Number of times user changed the channel during viewing/hearing a program<br>
c.	Time of broadcast<br>
NOTE: The program need not be a broadcast. It could also be listened/viewed through a DVD, Audio CD, or Could have been listened/viewed through some other device such as a hard disk, or on the mobile itself.<br>
d.	Ads watched/listened to<br>
e.	Information about interaction of the user with the handheld during<br>
viewing/listening.<br>
f.	Information about the user presence in the vicinity of the television during duration of the program. The assumption here is that the user is keeping his mobile on his person or near him.<br>
g.	Program settings (muted, audio level, presence of a PIP program being viewed in parallel &amp; information about such a program)<br>
h.	Profile of the user watching the program such as age, sex, profession etc.<br>
i.	User defined information<br>
A format for packaging above information in a way that can enable parsing,<br>
search, extending and publishing of such data will be defined.<br>
Below is a definition of some modules for such a system:<br>
a.	A module which can collect "usage information" referred to here as the "Information Module"<br>
b.	A module which will establish communication between the mobile and the external media device referred to here as the "communication module". The communication can be secure or non-secure.<br>
Each external media device will be identified uniquely to the mobile-device to<br>
distinguish between the usage information.<br>
Once the media device is switched ON, the mobile device will first be<br>
connected to the media device through the communication module.<br>
The Information module will then be activated and will start monitoring the<br>
usage of the user. The mechanism to monitor this information will be defined.<br>
i<br>
The Information module will then send "usage information" to the mobile device through the communication module.<br>
The source of usage information will change based on the different scenarios.<br>
Scenario A (Fig 1)<br>
In this scenario, the external media device (TV, Set-Top Box, Radio, Gaming Consoles etc.) will collect the information and send it to the mobile.<br>
Scenario B (Fig 2)<br>
The mobile has the information about media usage available to it through internal applications.<br>
The internal settings of the external media device (including channel ordering on the media device, channel information, program information) are available through these applications to the mobile.<br>
They can be obtained in one of the following ways:<br>
a.	The mobile has a sync-up with the external media device and a mechanism to get these settings is defined between the mobile and the external media device.<br>
b.	The mobile obtains these settings from the operator network.<br>
If the mobile is used to control the external media device (for example as a remote control) then these "settings" can be combined with the control data (such as time of switching ON/OFF, change from X channel to Y channel) to create the "media usage information".<br>
Another possibility is that the mobile has information only about the usage of TV and can send only the time of usage and the duration. This method can provide some "lite" information , about TV usage pattern instead of complete information about the popularity of particular channels/programs.' In such cases an application on the mobile can keep track of collecting this minimal information from the external media device.<br>
Such information may be captured by sniffing the control signals from the auxiliary device to the external media device and interpreting this.<br>
Yet another possibility is that the mobile records information about media played through applications present on it or connected to it (for example radio on mobile, audio or video files played on mobile). This information along with<br>
some metadata about the media played back can be sent. Scenario C (Fig 3)<br>
In this case the mobile has a sync-up mechanism with the auxiliary device which is being used to control the external media device and the required usage information can be obtained from this device.<br>
It is also possible that the auxiliary device provides only usage information and rest of the processing is done on the mobile.<br>
Scenario D (Fig 4)<br>
The mobile obtains samples of the audio and/or video clips from the program being viewed/heard on the external media device. These samples are encoded (such as in MPEG format) and sent along with metadata such as the time of viewing and profile present on the mobile as "usage information".<br>
At the server end, based on the analysis and matching of these samples, the program that was viewed can be identified.<br>
The samples can be obtained in the following ways:<br>
1.	By audio recording from the mobile<br>
2.	By video recording from the mobile<br>
3. By audio and/or video recording by an auxiliary device attached to the external media device and sent to the mobile through some wireless transmission technique such as BT, IRDA or by the mobile being attached to the external media device via USB or serial cable<br>
The capture of video could be continuous or as discrete snapshots (images) of the screen.<br>
Sending the information<br>
The mobile device may send the "usage information" through the operator network to:<br>
a.	a preconfigured destination<br>
b.	user defined destination<br>
The method involved could be by SMS, MMS, E-Mail or a WAP/HTTP connection. An IMS based application could also be used for this.<br>
The usage information could be packaged In a proprietary or standard parsing format such as HTML, XML etc.<br>
A protocol to exchange the media usage information with the server on the operator network will be defined.<br>
The mechanism to package the profile information of the user(s) will also be<br>
defined.<br>
Triggering collection/reception of usage information<br>
Another aspect of this invention involves the detection of the proximity of the mobile handset to the external media device and then triggering the collection/reception of usage information. This could be accomplished by embedding an RFID tag on to the mobile and having it read by a RFID reader on the external media device.<br>
It could also be accomplished by having a reader on the mobile device and a tag on an auxiliary device.<br>
It could also involve the placement of a tag on the mobile device and a general purpose reader placed externally in the vicinity of the external media device.<br>
In each of the above cases, the action of collection/reception of usage information could be triggered on the mobile device only on mutual detection between the mobile device and the external media device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from.<br>
