				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparation of low molecular weight chitosan.<br>
The invention, in particular describes the preparation of low molecular weight chitosan and chitooligomers, which are of high value addition for use in medicine, agriculture, food and non-food industries as well as in other allied applications.<br>
Chitin, a ß 1,4-linked polymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, is the second most abundant natural biopolymer derived from exoskeletons of crustaceans and also from cell walls of fungi and insects. Chitosan, a copolymer of ß 1,4-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose (-20%) and ß 1,4-2-amido-2-deoxy-D-glucose (80%) units, is a product derived from de-N-acetylation of chitin in the presence of hot alkali. Chitosan, is infact a collective name representing a mixture of de-N-acetylated chitins, deacetylated to different degrees. In India, chitosan availability will be more than 300 metric tonnes annually. Both chitin/chitosan and their modified derivatives find extensive applications in medicine, agriculture, food and non-food industries as well.<br>
Reference may be made to G.S.Braek, T. Anthonsen and P.A.Sandford (Eds.), Chitin and chitosan, Elsevier Applied Science, NY, 1989, for an extensive coverage of chemistry, biochemistry and functional aspects of chitin/ chitosan. All these are the results of their biological activity, biocompatibility and biodegradability in combination with their low toxicity.<br>
However, one major constraint in their efficient usage is the high molecular weight of these polymers, which limits their solubility in aqueous medium. High viscosity, even at low concentrations of chitosan is another limiting factor in its use for specific applications. The functional properties of chitosan and its oligomers are mainly dependent upon their molecular weight and the consequent ease of solubility in aqueous media. Nevertheless, preference is given for using low molecular weight chitosans, having high solubility in aqueous acidic or neutral medium, for some specific physiological applications such as antibacterial activity, hypocholesterolemic activity, antitumor activity, antihypertensive<br>
activity and immunopotentiating activity in medicine and agriculture. Increasing attention has recently been given to converting chitin and chitosan to chitooligosaccharides, which are shown to exhibit a variety of useful functional and biopharmacological attributes.<br>
Low molecular weight chitosan and chitooligomers can be prepared by acidic or enzymic degradation of polymeric chitosan molecule. The enzymic process is generally preferable over that of acid degradation, because the course of hydrolysis and product distribution can be controlled precisely.<br>
Reference may be made to J.A.Rupley, Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 83 (1964) 245-255, wherein the hydrolysis of chitin/chitosan in strong hydrochloric acid was studied over a range of acid cocentration, temperature and duration. The drawback of the process is that large quantities of monomeric glucosamine appeared in the early hydrolysates and the concentrations of dimer, trimer and higher oligosaccharides were never obtained in comparable concentrations. Further, the inherent difficulties of removing the acid by alkali neutralization followed by desalting by chromatographic means make the whole process expensive and very laborious, and therefore not viable for commercial exploitation. These drawbacks have been partially overcome by using enzymatic method, which also minimizes alterations in the chemical nature of reaction products.<br>
Reference may be made to K.Sakai, T.Uchiyama, Y.Matahira and F.Nanjo, J. Ferment. Bioeng., 72 (1991) 168-199; M.Charpentier and P.Percheron, Int.J.Biochem., 15 (1983) 289-292 for a few enzymic procedures for the preparation of low molecular weight chitosans and water soluble chitooligosaccharides. Chitinases and chitosanases, which are widely distributed in fungi, bacteria and plants, are the specific enzymes used for this purpose, although reference may be made to M.Yalpani and D.Pantaleone, Carbohydr. Res., 256 (1994) 159-173, who have used several of the commercial enzymes such as lipases , proteases and glycanases for non-specific hydrolysis of chitin, chitosan and their derivatives. The drawback of using such enzymically hydrolysed chitosan preparations for biomedical and food purposes is the undesirable level of chitosan pyrogenicity caused by<br>
the presence of about 0.1% (w/w) of the proteins of the enzyme complex. This has been partially overcome by enzyme immobilization on a suitable matrix.<br>
Reference may be made to A.V.IIyina, V.E.Tikhonov, A.I.AIbulov and V.P.Varlamov,<br>
Process Biochem., 35 (2000) 563-568, for a chitinolytic enzyme complex produced by<br>
Streptomyces kurssanovii immobilized on macroporous crosslinked chitosan, for the<br>
preparation of acid-free water soluble chitosan with a low molecular weight. In this<br>
reference a two step hydrolysis was used, the first hydrolysis at pH 4.6 giving rise to a 22-<br>
24 kDa chitosan of low solubility in water, whereas the second hydrolysis at pH 6.2 gave<br>
a low molecular weight (2-9 kDa) chitosan, which was easily water soluble. The main<br>
drawbacks of this enzymic procedure are, 1. The method involves hydrolysis by an<br>
enzymic complex in batch reactors, which may not be cost effective, 2. The method<br>
includes enzyme immobilization step, adding to additional cost and time involved in its<br>
preparation as well as time required for desorption of the hydrolysed products, and 3. the<br>
method necessitates too many steps and subsequent follow up, which make the whole<br>
process, laborious, time consuming and not cost effective.	<br>
Reference may be made to Japanese patent No. JP 03277277, entitled Novel chitosanase, bacterium for producing the same and preparation of low molecular weight chitosan, wherein low molecular weight chitosan useful as a coagulant or solubility accelerating agent and not containing an excessive amount of salt is prepared by treating chitosan with a specific bacterial chitosanase and subsequently separating the derived<br>
chitosan oligosaccharide.  The main drawback of this method is utilization of expensive<br>
chitosanase enzyme, which is not available in bulk for commercial exploitation.<br>
Reference may be made to Japanese patent No. JP 09031104, entitled Production of low molecular weight chitosan and chitooligosaccharide, which are produced by hydrolysis with strong acid. The drawbacks of this method are the use of strong mineral acid which results in random hydrolysis of chitosan resulting in lower yields of products, and use of H2O2 for decolorization, Ca(OH)2 for neutralization of acid and alcoholic extraction of the byproducts.<br>
Reference may be made to Japanese patent No. JP 02011601, entitled Production of low molecular weight chitosan, wherein the molecular weight reduction of high molecular weight chitosan is effected by reacting with H2O2 under an acidic condition. The drawback of this method is the use of acid and H2O2, which may lead to random cleavage owing to non-specific oxidation especially at the amino group and as a result unidentifiable oxidized products may contaminate the low molecular weight chitosan making it unsafe for use in food, feed and medicine.<br>
Reference may be made to an American patent No. US 05705634, entitled High yield preparation of dimeric and decameric chitin oligomers, wherein the title compounds are produced by fragmentation and partial acid hydrolysis. Although claim is made for high yields of higher chitooligomers, the drawback is the use of acid for hydrolysis and its subsequent neutralization, and purification of the products. All these add to more number of steps involved for production, and as a whole the method may not be economical.<br>
Reference may be made to Japanese patent No. JP 05320204, entitled Production of N-acetylchitooligosaccharide, wherein chitosan is decomposed with chitosanase derived from Bacillus No.7-M followed by enzyme inactivation and product purification by gel filtration, electrodialysis and lyophilization. The drawback of this method is the use of expensive enzyme and laborious steps involved in product purification.<br>
Reference may be made to Japanese patent No. JP 09031105, entitled Production of low molecular weight chitosan and chitooligosaccharide, for producing the title comopounds by irradiating a solution of chitosan with ultrasonic waves. The drawback of this method is low recovery of the products and use of costly ultrasonic generator for effecting polymer degradation.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for low molecular weight chitosan, which obviates the drawbacks discussed above.<br>
Another object of this invention is to prepare a range of low molecular weight and modified chitosans for a variety of end use applications in various fields, including food, agriculture and medicine.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to recover chitooligomers having high potential biomedical uses.<br>
The novelty in the present invention is that the degradation of chitosan molecule is induced by free radical initiation at the amino group of the glucosamine residues followed by subsequent glycosidic cleavage giving rise to low molecular weight chitosan.<br>
The probable reaction mechanism involved the following steps.<br>
