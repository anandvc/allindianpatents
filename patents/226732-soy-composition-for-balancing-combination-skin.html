				<td>Soy Composition for Balancing Combination Skin<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to compositions and methods<br>
of treating combination skin so as to provide the<br>
benefit of balancing the skin's oily and dry areas such<br>
that the oily areas appear less shiny and the dry areas<br>
appear and feel more moist.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A large proportion of the adult population<br>
considers their facial skin to be a combination type<br>
with both dry and oily areas. There is a lack of<br>
effective skin care products on the market today that<br>
address this need.<br>
Combination skin, defined as facial skin having<br>
areas of dryness as well as areas that are perceived to<br>
be overly oily, has presented great dilemmas in terms of<br>
treatment and appearance. Generally, individuals having<br>
combination skin attempt to treat areas of oiliness in<br>
order to prevent outbreaks of acne and to diminish<br>
shininess. However, such treatments and preparations<br>
tend to dry the skin and cause irritation to the areas<br>
of the skin that are dry. Similarly, if individuals<br>
attempt to treat dry patches of skin by applying<br>
moisturizing compositions, which generally contain large<br>
proportions of emollients and oils, such compositions<br><br>
tend to clog pores and increase oiliness in already-oily<br>
areas and generate comedone production. This type of<br>
treatment results in undesirable skin breakout or acne.<br>
Applying separate compositions to different areas of the<br>
face and neck is time-consuming, expensive and<br>
inconvenient<br>
Thus, it would be desirable to have compositions<br>
and methods of treatment: that address the condition of<br>
combination skin so as to permit treatment of<br>
combination skin with one composition. It would be<br>
further desirable that such a composition would balance<br>
the skin condition, in order to render the appearance<br>
of the skin neither overly-oily nor overly-dry.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to compositions and methods<br>
of selectively balancing the oiliness and dryness of<br>
human skin. By applying compositions containing non-<br>
denatured legume products, a user having "combination<br>
skin" (i.e., skin having areas of oiliness and areas of<br>
dryness in proximity) may obtain skin in which the oily<br>
areas produce less sebum and "oil" and the dry areas<br>
become moisturized. Topical soy-containing preparations<br>
have been shown to deliver significant skin care<br>
benefits. Such soy-containing preparations should<br>
preferably contain "total soy", or soy products that<br>
contain non-denatured proteins. Such compositions are<br><br>
exemplified in copending U.S. Patent Application Serial<br>
No. 09/796,054, filed February 28, 2001 and U.S. Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 09/795,762, filed February 28,<br>
2001, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
We believe that the components of "total soy" can<br>
help improve combination skin. In fact, total soy<br>
contains a balanced, complete spectrum of nutrients such<br>
as soy proteins, fatty acids, polysacchrides, vitamins,<br>
minerals, flavonoids and actives that provide multi-<br>
functional skincare benefits. We believe that other<br>
total legume-containing compositions may also confer the<br>
same type of benefit as those of non-denatured "total<br>
soy" .<br>
Legume Product<br>
What is meant by a "legume product" is a substance<br>
derived from a legume fruit. A legume is a plant from the<br>
family Leguminosae, which has a dehiscent fruit such as a<br>
bean, pea, or lentil. Examples of legumes, include but are<br>
not limited to, beans such as soybeans, lentil beans, peas,<br>
and peanuts.<br>
The legume product may contain the entire legume<br>
fruit (e.g., the legume fruit ground into a powder) or<br>
only a portion of the legume (e.g., an extract of the<br>
legume) . The legume product may be in the form of a<br>
fluid (e.g., a mixture of the legume fruit and water) or<br>
a solid (e.g., legume fruits powders). when in the form<br>
of a fluid, the term "legume product" refers to the solid<br>
constituents of the fluid derived from the legume.<br><br>
The compositions of the present invention comprise a<br>
safe and effective amount of the legume product (e.g.,<br>
soy product). In one embodiment, the composition<br>
contains from about 0.001% to about 50%, more preferably<br>
from about 1% to about 30% or most preferably from about<br>
2% to about 20%, by weight, of the legume product (e.g.,<br>
a soy product).<br>
Soy Product/"Total Soy"<br>
What is meant by a "Soy Product" or "total soy", is<br>
a substance derived from the soybean. The soy product may<br>
contain only a portion of the soybean (e.g., an extract<br>
of the soybean such as a lipid reduced soybean powder or<br>
filtered soymilk) or may contain the entire soybean<br>
(e.g., a ground powder of the legume). The soy product<br>
may be in the form of a fluid (e.g., soymilk) or a solid<br>
(e.g., a soybean powder or soymilk powder). When in the<br>
form of a fluid, the term "soy product" refers to the<br>
solid constituents of the fluid that are derived from the<br>
soybean.<br>
In one embodiment, the soy product is soybean<br>
powder. Soybean powder may be made by grinding dry<br>
soybeans. In one embodiment, the soybean powder has a<br>
average particle size of less than about 150 micrometers<br>
and possibly less than about 10 micrometers. In one<br>
embodiment, the soybean powder has a moisture content o£<br>
less than about 10%, more preferably, less than about 5%.<br>
In one embodiment, the soybean powder may be<br>
lyophilized, or freeze-dried.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the soy product is soymilk or<br>
soymilk. powder. Soymilk is a combination of solids<br>
derived from soybeans and water, the mixture of which has<br>
some or all of the insoluble constituents filtered off.<br>
Soymilk powder is evaporated soymilk, which in one<br>
embodiment, is in a lyophilized or spray-dried form.<br>
Procedures for manufacturing soymilk include, but are not<br>
limited to, the following three procedures. First,<br>
soymilk may be made by placing soybeans into water to<br>
allow them to absorb the water. The swelled beans are<br>
then ground and additional water is then added. The<br>
mixture may then filtered to remove any insoluble<br>
residue. Second, soymilk may also be prepared from<br>
soybean powder. Soybean powder is thoroughly mixed with<br>
water (e.g., for at least one hour), which may then be<br>
followed by a filtration process to remove insoluble<br>
residues. Third, soymilk can also be reconstituted from<br>
soymilk powder by adding water. In one embodiment,<br>
soymilk comprises from between about 1% to about 50%, by<br>
weight (e.g., from about 5% to about 20%, by weight) of<br>
solids from the soybean.<br>
A "safe and effective amount" means an amount of<br>
compound or composition (e.g., the legume product)<br>
sufficient to induce a positive modification in the<br>
condition to be regulated or treated, but low enough to<br>
avoid serious side effects. The safe and effective<br>
amount of the compound or composition will vary with the<br>
particular condition being treated, the age and physical<br><br>
condition of the end user, the severity of the condition<br>
being treated/prevented, the duration of the treatment,<br>
the nature of other treatments, the specific compound or<br>
product/composition employed, the particular<br>
cosmetically-acceptable carrier utilized, and like<br>
factors.<br>
As used herein, "topical application" means<br>
directly laying on or spreading on outer skin using,<br>
e.g., by use of the hands or an applicator such as a<br>
wipe, puff, roller, or spray.<br>
As used herein, "cosmetically-acceptable" means<br>
that the product(s) or compound(s) which the term<br>
describes are suitable for use in contact with tissues<br>
(e.g., the skin) without undue toxicity,<br>
incompatibility, instability, irritation, allergic<br>
response, and the like. This term is not intended to<br>
limit the ingredient/product to which it describes for<br>
use solely as a cosmetic (e.g., the ingredient/product<br>
may be used as a pharmaceutical).<br>
As used herein, "topical carrier" means one or more<br>
compatible solid or liquid filler diluents that are<br>
suitable for topical administration to a mammal.<br>
Examples of topical carriers include, but are not limited<br>
to, water, waxes, oils, emollients, emulsifiers,<br>
thickening agents, gelling agents, and mixtures thereof.<br>
As used herein, "trypsin inhibitory activity" means<br>
the ability of the legume product at a concentration of<br>
0.1% (w/w) to inhibit the activity of the protease<br><br>
trypsin, as measured by the assay set forth below in<br>
Example 2. In one embodiment, the legume products of<br>
the present invention have a trypsin inhibitory activity<br>
of at least about 15%. In a further embodiment, the<br>
legume products of the present invention have a trypsin<br>
inhibitory activity of at least about 25%, such as at<br>
least about 50%. However, achieving skin balancing in<br>
accordance with this invention does not necessarily<br>
require the presence of high trypsin inhibitory<br>
activity.<br>
"Objectionable microbial content" means the amount<br>
of bacteria, fungi, and yeast present in the legume<br>
product that are harmful to humans, including but not<br>
limited to coliform, E. Coli, Salmonella, thermophilic<br>
spores, Bacillus, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, fecal<br>
streptococcus, and those listed in "Disinfection,<br>
sterilization, and preservation" 4th edition, Seymour S.<br>

Examples of compositions suitable for use in the<br>
compositions and methods of this invention are described<br>
in copending U.S. patent applications Serial Nos.<br>

by reference.<br><br>
Additional sources of nutrients similar to those in<br>
"total soy" may be contained in the species belonging to the<br>
following plant families: Solanaceae (e.g., potato, tomato,<br>
tomatilla, and the like); Gramineae (e.g., rice, buckwheat,<br>
sorghum, wheat, barley, oats and the like); Cucurbitaceae<br>
(e.g., cucumbers, squsish, gourd, luffa and the like) ; and,<br>
preferably, Leguminosae (e.g., beans, peas, lentils, peanuts,<br>
and the like).<br>
The compounds which are active in the compositions and<br>
methods of this invention may be delivered topically by any<br>
means known to those of skill in the art. If the delivery<br>
parameters of the topically active pharmaceutical or cosmetic<br>
agent so require, the topically active compositions of this<br>
invention may preferably be further composed of a<br>
pharmaceutically or cosmetically acceptable vehicle capable<br>
of functioning as a delivery system to enable the penetration<br>
of the topically active: agent into the skin.<br>
One acceptable vehicle for topical delivery of some of<br>
the compositions of this invention, particularly proteins<br>
such as trypsin and STI, may contain liposomes. The<br>
liposomes are more preferably non-ionic and contain a)<br>
glycerol dilaurate (preferably in an amount of between<br>
about 5% and about 70% by weight); b) compounds having the<br>
steroid backbone found in cholesterol (preferably in an<br>
amount of between about 5% and about 4 5% by weight); and c)<br>
one or more fatty acid ethers having from about 12 to about<br>
18 carbon atoms (preferably in an amount of between about<br>
5% and about 70% by weight collectively), wherein the<br><br>
constituent compounds of the liposomes are preferably in a<br>
ratio of about 37.5:12.5:33.3:16.7. Liposomes comprised of<br>
glycerol dilaurate/cholesterol/polyoxyethylene-10-stearyl<br>
ether/polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether (GDL liposomes) are<br>
most preferred. Preferably the liposomes are present in an<br>
amount, based upon the total volume of the composition, of<br>
from about 10 mg/mL to about 100 mg/mL, and more preferably<br>
from about 20 mg/mL to about 50 mg/mL. A ratio of about<br>
37.5:12.5:33.3:16.7 is most preferred. Suitable liposomes<br>
may preferably be prepared in accordance with the protocol<br>
set forth in Example 1, though other methods commonly used<br>
in the art are also acceptable. The above described<br>
composition may be prepared by combining the desired<br>
components in a suitable container and mixing them under<br>
ambient conditions in any conventional high shear mixing<br>
means well known in the art for non-ionic liposomes<br>
preparations, such as those disclosed in Niemiec et al.,<br>
"Influence of Nonionic Liposomal Composition On Topical<br>
Delivery of Peptide Drugs Into Pilosebacious Units: An In<br>
Vivo Study Using the Hamster Ear Model," 12 Pharm. Res.<br>
1184-88 (1995) ("Niemiec"), which is incorporated by<br>
reference herein in its entirety. We have found that the<br>
presence of these liposomes in the compositions of this<br>
invention may enhance the depigmenting capabilities of some<br>
of the compositions of this invention.<br>
Other preferable formulations may contain, for example,<br>
soybean milk or other liquid formulations derived directly<br>
from legumes or other suitable plant. For example, such a<br><br>
formulation may contain a large proportion of soybean milk,<br>
an emulsifier that maintains the physical stability of the<br>
soybean milk, and, optionally a chelating agent,<br>
preservatives, emollients, humectants and/or thickeners or<br>
gelling agents.<br>
Oil-in-water emulsions, water-in-oil emulsions, solvent-<br>
based formulations and aqueous gels known to those of skill<br>
in the art may also be utilized as vehicles for the delivery<br>
of the compositions of this invention.<br>
The source of active compound to be formulated will<br>
generally depend upon the particular form of the compound.<br>
Small organic molecules and peptidyl fragments can be<br>
chemically synthesized and provided in a pure form suitable<br>
for pharmaceutical/cosmetic usage. Products of natural<br>
extracts can be purified according to techniques known in the<br>
art. Recombinant sources of compounds are also available to<br>
those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
In alternative embodiments, the topically active<br>
pharmaceutical or cosmetic composition may be optionally<br>
combined with other ingredients such as moisturizers,<br>
cosmetic adjuvants, anti-oxidants, bleaching agents,<br>
tyrosinase inhibitors and other known depigmentation<br>
agents, surfactants, foaming agents, conditioners,<br>
humectants, fragrances, viscosifiers, buffering agents,<br>
preservatives, sunscreens and the like. The compositions of<br>
this invention may also contain active amounts of retinoids<br>
(i.e., compounds that bind to any members of the family of<br><br>
retinoid receptors), including, for example, tretinoin,<br>
retinol, esters of tretinoin and/or retinol and the like.<br>
Liquid derivatives and natural extracts made<br>
directly from plants or botanical sources may be<br>
employed in the compositions of this invention in a<br>
concentration (w/v) from about 1 to about 99%.<br>
Fractions of natural extracts and naturally-derived<br>
active ingredients such as STI may have a different<br>
preferred range, from about 0.01% to about 20% and, more<br>
preferably, from about 1% to about 10% of the<br>
composition. Of course, mixtures of the active agents<br>
of this invention may be combined and used together in<br>
the same formulation, or in serial applications of<br>
different formulations.<br>
Preferably, the compositions of this invention contain<br>
from about 20% to about 99% of extracts of botanical<br>
materials; and from about 1% to about 20% for fractions of<br>
natural extracts and naturally-derived active ingredients<br>
(such as protease inhibitors, e.g., soybean trypsin<br>
inhibitor or the like and mixtures of active ingredients)<br>
between one and two times daily for a period of time until<br>
the skin evidences a change to a more balanced appearance.<br>
Thereafter, once the change in appearance has been<br>
achieved, a lower concentration and dose from about 10% to<br>
about 90% for liquid derivatives and extracts of botanical<br>
materials; and from about 0.01% to about 5% for fractions<br>
of natural extracts and naturally-derived protease<br>
inhibitors such as STI or mixtures thereof), of active<br><br>
ingredient may be applied on a less frequent time schedule,<br>
e.g., about once per day to about twice per week. The<br>
effects of the active agents of this invention are<br>
reversible, therefore, in order to maintain these effects,<br>
continuous application or administration should be<br>
performed. The invention illustratively disclosed herein<br>
suitably may be practiced in the absence of any component,<br>
ingredient, or step which is not specifically disclosed<br>
herein.<br>
The compositions effective in the methods of this<br>
invention contain a safe and effective amount of non-<br>
denatured legume product, most preferably, a soy product.<br>
The topical compositions useful in the present invention<br>
involve formulations suitable for topical application to<br>
skin.<br>
Anti-microbial Treatment of Legume Product<br>
The surface of legume fruits often contain high<br>
levels of microorganisms. Thus, prior to use by humans,<br>
the legume product needs to be treated to reduce or<br>
eliminate such microorganisms.<br>
In one embodiment, the legume products of the<br>
present invention have a total microbial content of less<br>
than about 10,000 colony-forming units ("cfu") per gram.<br>
In a further embodiment, the soy products of the present<br>
invention have a microbial content of less than about<br>
1,000 cfu per gram (such as less than about 100 cfu per<br>
gram) of the legume product.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the legume products of the<br>
present invention have a total objectionable microbial<br>
content of less than 300 cfu per gram such as less than<br>
150 cfu per gram. In a further embodiment, the legume<br>
products of the present invention have an undetectable<br>
amount of any objectionable microbials for at least one<br>
gram (e.g., at least ten grams) of legume product.<br>
In one embodiment, the legume product is exposed to<br>
gamma irradiation. In a further embodiment, the legume<br>
product is exposed to between about 2 to about 30 kGy of<br>
gamma irradiation, such as between about 5 and about 10<br>
kGy of gamma irradiation. Applicants have unexpectedly<br>
found that such treatment reduces the microbial content<br>
of the legume product, while maintaining its biological<br>
activity (e.g., serine protease inhibitory activity).<br>
Applicants have also found that treatment of legume<br>
products with gamma irradiation maintains the cosmetic<br>
elegance of the legume product, such as maintained its<br>
natural colors and did not induce significant malodors.<br>
Other anti-microbial processes that also maintain<br>
the protease inhibitory activity of the legume product<br>
that can be practiced alone or in combination with gamma<br>
irradiation, include, but are not limited to, exposure to<br>
x-rays, high energy electron or proton beams, ultraviolet<br>
radiation, hydrostatic pressure, and addition of chemical<br>
agents possessing antimicrobial activity, and<br>
combinations thereof. A complete list of methods for<br>
microbial content reduction is set forth in<br><br>
"Disinfection, sterilization, and preservation" 4th<br>
edition, Seymour S. Block, pp. 887-888 (1991, Lea &amp;<br>
Febiger, Malvern, PA) .<br>
Applicants have found that processes using thermal<br>
treatment may result in a substantial loss in protease<br>
inhibitory activity and, thus, should be used with<br>
caution. For example, applicants have found that<br>
heating soymilk to 100oC for only 10 minutes reduced the<br>
trypsin inhibitory activity of the soymilk from 86%<br>
(when maintained at 4oC) to 46%. Applicants have found<br>
that heating soymilk can also result in a change of the<br>
color or odor of the soybean product.<br>
Topical Compositions<br>
The topical compositions useful in the present<br>
invention involve formulations suitable for topical<br>
application to skin. In one embodiment, the composition<br>
comprises the soy product and a cosmetically-acceptable<br>
topical carrier. In one embodiment, the cosmetically-<br>
acceptable topical carrier is from about 50% to abut<br>
99.99%, by weight, of the composition (e.g., from about<br>
80% to about 95%, by weight, of the composition.<br>
The compositions may be made into a wide variety of<br>
product types that include but are not limited to<br>
lotions, creams, gels, sticks, sprays, shaving creams,<br>
ointments, cleansing liquid washes and solid bars,<br>
shampoos, pastes, powders, mousses, shaving creams,<br>
wipes, patches, nail lacquers, wound dressing and<br>
adhesive bandages, hydrogels, films and make-up such as<br><br>
foundations, mascaras, and lipsticks. These product<br>
types may comprise several types of cosmetically<br>
acceptable topical carriers including, but not limited<br>
to solutions, emulsions (e.g., microemulsions and<br>
nanoemulsions), gels, solids and liposomes. The<br>
following are non-limitative examples of such carriers.<br>
Other carriers can be formulated by those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art.<br>
The topical compositions useful in the present<br>
invention can be formulated as solutions. Solutions<br>
typically include an aqueous solvent (e.g., from about<br>
50% to about 99.99% or from about 90% to about 99% of a<br>
cosmetically acceptable aqueous solvent).<br>
Topical compositions useful in the subject<br>
invention may be formulated as a solution comprising an<br>
emollient. Such compositions preferably contain from<br>
about 2% to about 50% of an emollient(s). As used<br>
herein, "emollients" refer to materials used for the<br>
prevention or relief of dryness, as well as for the<br>
protection of the skin. A wide variety of suitable<br>
emollients are known and may be used herein. Sagarin,<br>

Toiletry, and Fragrance Assoc., Washington, D.C., 7th<br>
Edition, 1997) (hereinafter "ICI Handbook") contains<br>
numerous examples of suitable materials.<br><br>
A lotion can be made from such a solution. Lotions<br>
typically comprise from about 1% to about 20% {e.g.,<br>
from about 5% to about 10%) of an emollient(s) and from<br>
about 50% to about 90% (e.g., from about 60% to about<br>
80%) of water.<br>
Another type of product that may be formulated from<br>
a solution is a cream. A cream typically comprises from<br>
about 5% to about 50% (e.g., from about 10% to about<br>
20%) of an emollient(s) and from about 45% to about 85%<br>
(e.g., from about 50% to about 75%) of water.<br>
Yet another type of product that may be formulated<br>
from a solution is an ointment. An ointment may<br>
comprise a simple base of animal or vegetable oils or<br>
semi-solid hydrocarbons. An ointment may comprise from<br>
about 2% to about 10% of an emollient(s) plus from about<br>
0.1% to about 2% of a thickening agent(s). A more<br>
complete disclosure of thickening agents or viscosity<br>
increasing agents useful herein can be found in Sagarin,<br>
Cosmetics, Science and Technology, 2nd Edition, Vol. 1,<br>
pp. 72-73 (1972) and the ICI Handbook pp. 1693-1697.<br>
The topical compositions useful in the present<br>
invention formulated as emulsions. If the carrier is an<br>
emulsion, from about 1% to about 10% (e.g., from about<br>
2% to about 5%) of the carrier comprises an<br>
emulsifier(s). Emulsifiers may be nonionic, anionic or<br>
cationic. Suitable emulsifiers are disclosed in, for<br>
example, U.S. Patent No. 3,755,560, U.S. Patent No.<br>

North American Edition, pp. 317-324 (1986), and the ICI<br>
Handbook, pp.1673-1686.<br>
Lotions and creams can be formulated as emulsions.<br>
Typically such lotions comprise from 0.5% to about 5% of<br>
an emulsifier(s). Such creams would typically comprise<br>
from about 1% to about 20% (e.g., from about 5% to about<br>
10%) of an emollient(s); from about 20% to about 80%<br>
(e.g., from 30% to about 70%) of water; and from about<br>
1% to about 10% (e.g., from about 2% to about 5%) of an<br>
emulsifier(s).<br>
Single emulsion skin care preparations, such as<br>
lotions and creams, of the oil-in-water type and water-<br>
in-oil type are well-known in the cosmetic art and are<br>
useful in the subject invention. Multiphase emulsion<br>
compositions, such as the water-in-oil-in-water type, as<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,254,105 and 4,960,764,<br>
are also useful in the subject invention. In general,<br>
such single or multiphase emulsions contain water,<br>
emollients, and emulsifiers as essential ingredients.<br>
The topical compositions of this invention can also<br>
be formulated as a gel (e.g., an aqueous gel using a<br>
suitable gelling agent(s)). Suitable gelling agents for<br>
aqueous gels include, but are not limited to, natural<br>
gums, acrylic acid and acrylate polymers and copolymers,<br>
and cellulose derivatives (e.g., hydroxymethyl cellulose<br>
and hydroxypropyl cellulose). Suitable gelling agents<br>
for oils (such as mineral, oil) include, but are not<br>
limited to, hydrogenated butylene/ethylene/styrene<br><br>
copolymer and hydrogenated ethylene/propylene/styrene<br>
copolymer. Such gels typically comprises between about<br>
0.1% and 5%, by weight, of such gelling agents.<br>
The topical compositions of the present invention can<br>
also be formulated into a solid formulation (e.g., a wax-<br>
based stick, soap bar composition, powder, or a wipe<br>
containing powder).<br>
The topical compositions useful in the subject<br>
invention may contain, in addition to the aforementioned<br>
components, a wide variety of additional oil-soluble<br>
materials and/or water-soluble materials conventionally<br>
used in compositions for use on skin, hair, and nails at<br>
their art-established levels.<br>

Mineral Water<br>
The legume product (e.g., soymilk) and compositions<br>
of the present invention may be prepared using a mineral<br>
water. In one embodiment, the mineral water has a<br>
mineralization of at least about. 200 mg/L (e.g., from<br>
about 300 mg/L to about 1000 mg/L). In one embodiment,<br>
the mineral water comprises at least about 10 mg/L of<br>
calcium and/or at least about 5 mg/L of magnesium.<br>
The composition and formulations containing such<br>
compositions of the present invention may be prepared<br>
using methodology that: is well known by an artisan of<br>
ordinary skill.<br>
Example 1: Gamma Irradiation of Legume Product<br><br>
Applicants have found that soymilk powder prior to<br>
any antimicrobial processing such as gamma irradiation<br>
has high levels microbial content, ranging from up to<br>
50,000 cfu per gram. Such products were also found to<br>
have detectable levels of objectionable microbial<br>
content, such as fecal streptococci, at levels up to<br>
20,000 cfu per gram.<br>
Applicants have exposed various amounts (e.g., from<br>
about 1 g to about 200 kg) of soymilk powder to gamma<br>
irradiation varying from 1 kGy to 16 kGy. The dose or<br>
gamma irradiation needed for a reduction a total<br>
microbial content to less than about 10 0 cfu per gram<br>
was found to be about 10 kGy. The dose for one leg<br>
reduction for fecal streptococci is determined to be<br>
about 3 kGy and a dose of about 5 kGy was found to<br>
consistently reduce this microbial content within a 10<br>
gram sample of soymilk powder to undetectable levels.<br>
However, the amount of gamma irradiation used on the<br>
legume product will ultimately be determined by the<br>
microbial content and size of the soy product to be so<br>
treated.<br>
Example 2: Trypsin Inhibitory Activity of Legume Product<br>
The inhibition of trypsin-induced cleavage of a<br>
fluorescent casein peptide was measured using the<br>
EnzChek™ protease assay kit, following manufacturer's<br>
instructions (EnzChek™ Protease Assay Kits Product<br>
Information, Revised 3/15/99; Molecular Probes, Eugene<br><br>
OR). In summary, various soy preparations were first<br>
diluted in 1X digestion buffer (provided in kit) and<br>
incubated at different concentrations with 1000 units of<br>
trypsin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in 1X digestion<br>
buffer. A pure serine protease inhibitor (soybean<br>
trypsin inhibitor, from Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was used as<br>
a positive control at 0.1, 0.01%, and 0.001% w/v. Then,<br>
1.0 mg/ml stock solution of BODIPY FL casein was prepared<br>
by adding 0.2 mL of deionized water to the vials supplied<br>
with this substrate (provided in kit) , then made to a<br>
final working concentration of 10 microgram/ml in<br>
digestion buffer. Following incubation of the trypsin,<br>
with or without the test material, with the BODIPY<br>
fluorescent casein substrate at room temperature for one<br>
hour, fluorescence was measured (excitation 485 nm<br>
/emission 530 nm) on a SpectraMax® Gemini microtiter<br>
plate reader (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale,<br>
CA) using Softmax® Pro 3.0 software (Molecular Devices<br>
Corporation). Each experiment was performed in three<br>
replicates and was repeated twice.<br>
This assay was performed on soy products processed<br>
seven different ways. Example A was soybeans ground<br>
into powder (Sunlight: Foods Corporation, Taipei County,<br>
Taiwan, R.O.C.). Example B was soybean powder of<br>
Example A exposed to about 8-15 kGy of gamma<br>
irradiation. Example C was soybean powder in which the<br>
oil in the soybean powder was removed by extraction<br>
(Soyafluff® 200W from Central Soya Company, Inc., Fort<br><br>
Weyne, IN) . Example D was soymilk powder made with<br>
dehulled soybeans and water that was subsequently-<br>
filtered and heated and spray dried (Devansoy Farms,<br>
Carroll, Iowa) and exposed to between about 7-9 kGy of<br>
gamma irradiation. Example E was soymilk powder obtained<br>
by mixing soy beans and water, heating the mixture<br>
overnight, and adding 1,3-butylene glycol to the mixture<br>
(Flavosterone SB from Ichimaru Pharcos Co., Ltd, Gifu<br>
Japan). Example F was soymilk powder obtained by mixing<br>
soy beans and water, heating the mixture overnight, and<br>
subsequently adding ethanol to the mixture (Flavosterone<br>
SE from Ichimaru Pharcos Co., Ltd, Gifu Japan) . Example<br>
G was an extract of soy proteins (Vegeseryl HGP LS 8 572<br>
from Laboratories Serobiologiques S.A., Pulnoy, France).<br>
These soy products were compared to Soy Trypsin<br>
Inhibitor (STI) (Sigma).<br>
The percent inhibition of trypsin cleavage of the<br>
substrate by the different soy preparations was<br>
calculated using Microsoft ExcelTM and is reported in<br>
Table 1.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Tested Product	Concentration	% Inhibition of<br>
Trypsin<br>
STI	0.01	43.0<br>
STI	0.1	76.1<br>
Example A	0.01	32.8<br>
Example A	0.1	67.1<br>
Example B	0.01	31.5<br>
Example B	0.1	67.2<br>
Example c	0.01	22.7<br><br>
Example C	0.1	36.2<br>
Example D	0.01	8.92<br>
Example D	0.1	17.4<br>
Example E	0.01	7.83<br>
Example E	0.1	10.8<br>
Example F	0.01	4.87<br>
Example F	0.1	5.99<br>
Example G	0.1	6.85<br>
As shown in Table 1, STI can inhibit trypsin-induced<br>
cleavage in a dose response manner. Example A, which is<br>
soybean powder, also significantly inhibited trypsin<br>
activity. Further gamma irradiation of the soybean<br>
powder (i.e., Example B) , while reducing the microbial<br>
content of the soybean powder, unexpectedly did not<br>
significantly impact the trypsin inhibition activity of<br>
the soybean powder. The heat and/or extraction<br>
processing of Examples C-G, however, did significantly<br>
reduce the trypsin inhibitory activity of the soybean<br>
powder.<br>
Topical Compositions<br>
The topical compositions useful in the present<br>
invention involve formulations suitable for topical<br>
application to skin.<br>
The composition preferably contains a non-denatured<br>
soy product and a cosmetically-acceptable topical<br>
carrier. The cosmetically-acceptable topical carrier is<br>
preferably from about 0.1% to about 99.99%, by weight, of<br>
the composition (more preferably, from about 80% to about<br>
95%, by weight, of the composition). Topical<br>
compositions useful in the subject invention may be<br><br>
formulated as a solution comprising an emollient, or<br>
emollients. Such compositions preferably contain from<br>
about 2% to about 50% of an emollient(s). A lotion can be<br>
made from such a solution. Lotions typically comprise<br>
from about 1% to about 20% (e.g., from about 5% to about<br>
10%) of an emollient(s) and from about 50% to about 90%<br>
(more preferably, from about 60% to about 80%) of water.<br>
A cream typically comprises from about 5% to about 50%<br>
(more preferably, from about 10% to about 20%) of an<br>
emollient(s) and from about 45% to about 85% (more<br>
preferably, from about 50% to about 75%) of water. The<br>
topical compositions useful in the present invention<br>
formulated as emulsions. If the carrier is an emulsion,<br>
from about 1% to about 10% (more preferably, from about<br>
2% to about 5%) of the carrier is made up of at least one<br>
emulsifier. Emulsifiers may be nonionic, anionic or<br>
cationic.<br>
The non-denatured soy product content of the<br>
compositions useful in the methods of this invention is<br>
preferably from about 0.001% to about 99.9% by weight of<br>
the composition. More preferably, the content should be<br>
from about 0.01% to about 50%, and most preferably from<br>
about 0.5% to about 50%. The compositions of this<br>
invention may be created in powder form, in which case<br>
the soy product content may be present in amounts of from<br>
about 1 to about 99% of the composition. Soy product can<br>

agents, and agents for hair, nail, and/or skin<br>
conditioning. AHA,antiseptic agents, essential oils,<br>
proteins, silicones and the like.<br>
Surprisingly, the compositions of this invention,<br>
when applied to the skin one or more times, act; to<br>
"balance" both the moisture level and sebum level of the<br>
skin. The same application of composition of this<br>
invention both confers moisture to dry areas of the skin<br>
and decreases sebum production in oily areas of the skin.<br>
Thus, it selectively restores moisture where needed and<br>
reduces the level of oiliness in areas where such<br>
reduction is desired.<br><br>
The following example illustrates, but does not<br>
limit the scope of the compositions and methods of this<br>
invention.<br>
Example 3: Total Soy Lotion for Skin Balancing<br>
A clinical study was designed to assess the<br>
potential of a novel Total Soy lotion to balance<br>
combination skin and to affect tactile properties. A<br>
five-week, half-face, double blind placebo-controlled<br>
clinical study was conducted on twenty-three female<br>
subjects ages 20r35 years with combination skin<br>
(Fitzpatrick type I - II). "Combination skin": was<br>
defined as facial skin having at least one oily area and<br>
one dry area on each of the half face. The oily and dry<br>
areas were determined by sebumeter reading at &gt; 2 00 g/cm2<br>
and 
or placebo on the designated side of the face daily for<br>
5 weeks. Measurements were taken at baseline, weeks 1, 3<br>
and 5 on the forehead, cheek and chin. Scaling,<br>
moisturization, oiliness and smoothness were evaluated<br>
by instrumental measurements and digital photography.<br>
The results indicated this Total Soy preparation<br>
significantly reduced sebum in oily patches (p
chin areas) and enhanced moisturization for dry patches<br>
as compared to placebo (p
were not observed in single tape stripping for scaling<br>
or digital photography. Subject self-assessments<br>
demonstrated enhanced skin smoothness and oil reduction.<br><br>
which correlated with the instrumental results.<br>
Approximately 70% of the subjects noted improvement on<br>
the soy treated side while only 17% on placebo treated<br>
side noted improvement in overall tone and texture. In<br>
summary, this clinical study demonstrated that the Total<br>
Soy preparation balanced tactile properties of<br>
combination skin by regulating skin oily and dry areas,<br>
i.e., selectively reduced oiliness of oily patches and<br>
enhanced moisturization of dry patches.<br>

at 0, 1, 3 and 5 weeks:<br>
-	Skin hydration by Novameter®<br>
-	Sebum analysis by Sebumeter®<br>
All study subjects also maintained a diary<br>
Methods of measurement<br>
Sebum measurement by Sebumeter:<br><br>
The technique chosen for sebum measurement is the<br>
Courage and Kzahaka Sebumeter Model SM810. The<br>
principle of the Sebumeter involves the use of<br>
photometry with special opaque plastic film in a hand-<br>
held cartridge. This film becomes more transparent as<br>
more sebum is collected or deposited onto it. For sebum<br>
measurements, the cartridge is placed onto the teat area<br>
for 30 seconds to absorb the surface sebum. The film is<br>
measured for transparency with a high sebum content<br>
causing a higher readout. The resulting Sebumeter value<br>
is calibrated for units of µg sebum/cm2.<br>
Moisturization measurement by Nova DPM 9003:<br>
It has been recognized that water plays a<br>
fundamental role in controlling and modifying the<br>
physical properties of stratum corneum. Skin electrical<br>
properties are expressed as its electric potential as its<br>
resistance to electric current flow. This resistance is<br>
determined by applying an external voltage across two<br>
surface sites and finding the transient and/or steady<br>
state patterns of transcutaneous electrical current flow<br>
between these sites. The measurements can be resistance<br>
, conductance or impedance. There is evidence that<br>
these electrical signals might correlate with skin<br>
surface hydration. Commercially available measurement<br>
devices using electrical methods allow quantitative<br>
evaluation of the skin function and moisturization. Such<br><br>
instruments include the Skicon, the Corneometer and the<br>
Dermal Phase Meter (DPM). In this study. Nova DPM 9003<br>
delivers impedance-based capacitance readings by-<br>
integrating selected measurements at varying frequencies<br>
of the applied alternating current. The higher the<br>
capacitance reading or the DPM reading is, the higher the<br>
skin hydration is.<br><br>
CRITERIA OF COMBINATION SKIN<br>
Subjects were categorized as having "combination<br>
skin" if their faces had at least one oily area (sebum<br>
level &gt; 200 mg/cm2) and one dry area (sebum level 
mg/cm2) on each half face. The Facial Assessment<br>
Template set forth in Figure 1 demonstrates how<br>
evaluation was identified with respect to each subject.<br>
Figure 1 demonstrates different evaluation sites on<br>
subject's face. The facial mask was designed and used<br>
for the evaluation.<br>
The Total Soy lotion treated sites had increased<br>
moisturization compared with placebo for dry patches<br>
(p
made 12-24 hours after topical applications. Figure 3<br>
demonstrates that Total Soy lotion balanced sebum levels<br>
of dry skin patches vs placebo (mean ± SD; p
Figure 4 above demonstrates that Total Soy lotion<br>
treated sites balanced oily skin patches (mean ± SD) .<br>
The Total Soy lotion selectively decreased sebum levels<br>

set forth in Figure 5.<br><br><br>
At the end of study (week 5) , for those reported<br>
subject evaluations, Total Soy was rated more favorably<br>
than placebo. Approximately 60% of the subjects noted<br>
improvement on the soy treated side while only 17% on<br>
placebo treated side noted improvement in overall tone<br>
and texture. Such improvements also included the fine<br>
wrinkle line reduction. Clearly, "total soy" also<br>
provides additional skin benefits in the areas of even<br>
tone and texture, softness, and wrinkle reduction as set<br>
forth in the abovementioned copending patent<br>
applications, Such compositions are described in<br>
copending U.S. patent applications Serial Nos.<br>
09/110,409, filed July 6, 1998, 09/206,249, filed<br>
December 7, 1998, 09/361,429, filed July 27, 1999,<br>
09/621,565, filed July 21, 2000 and 09/698,454, filed<br>
October 27, 2000, which are hereby incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
Among the placebo testing subjects, a significant<br>
portion (35.3%) reported the acne or breakout events than<br>
the total soy subjects (5.9%) (See Table 2 above). These<br>
results are significant. As one would expect, the oily<br><br>
skin or excess skin sebum is a necessary condition for<br>
acne-prone skin. The reduction of excessive sebum on the<br>
oily patches resulted in the reduction of acne breakout.<br>
Total soy can be used to treat the acne prone skin to<br>
reduce the likelihood of acne.<br>
The compositions of this invention, Total Soy<br>
contains a broad-spectrum of non-denatured active<br>
components that were shown to provide a number of skin<br>
care benefits. In this study on combination facial skin,<br>
we learn that:<br>
•	Total Soy lotion moisturized dry patches<br>
•	Total Soy lotion selectively reduced sebum levels of<br>
facial skin oily patches<br>
•	Total Soy lotion clinically evened out dry/oily<br>
patches in combination facial skin<br>
•	Total Soy effectively smoothed and softened facial<br>
skin texture<br>
Total soy's dual actions on sebum reduction and<br>
moisturizing are believed to be due to the fact that it<br>
comprises up to 40-50% protein, 20-30% of triglyericdes,<br>
made up of long chain fatty acids (C16-C20 and C22), of<br>
which, a large proportion is polyunsaturated fatty acids<br>
and 20-30% carbohydrates as well as minor components<br>
such as soy isoflavones, phytosterols, vitamins and<br>
minerals. These components can contribute to the<br>
reduction of excess sebum for oily or greasy skin areas<br>
and at the same time to impart the hydrating effect on<br>
the dry areas.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A composition for balancing the appearance of combination skin<br>
comprising a legume product.<br>
2.	The composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein said legume is soy.<br>
3.	The composition as claimed in claim 2, wherein said soy is total soy.<br>
4.	A method of balancing the appearance of combination skin comprising<br>
applying a legume product to skin having both oily and dry components.<br>
5.	The method as claimed in claim 4, wherein said legume product is a soy<br>
product.<br>
6.	The method as claimed in claim 5, wherein said soy product is total soy.<br><br>
The present invention features legume products, compositions containing such<br>
legume products, and the topical application of such legume products for treating<br>
combination skin and maintaining balanced facial skin.</td>
