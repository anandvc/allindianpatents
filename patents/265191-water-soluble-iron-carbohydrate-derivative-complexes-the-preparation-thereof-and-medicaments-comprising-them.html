				<td>Water-soluble iron-carbohydrate derivative complexes, the<br>
preparation thereof, and medicaments comprising them<br>
The present invention provides water-soluble iron-<br>
carbohydrate derivative complexes which are suitable for<br>
the therapy of iron deficiency states, and the preparation<br>
thereof, medicaments comprising them, and the use thereof<br>
in the prophylaxis or therapy of iron deficiency states.<br>
The medicaments are suitable in particular for parenteral<br>
administration.<br>
Anaemias caused by iron deficiency can be treated or<br>
treated prophylactically by administration of medicaments<br>
containing iron. The use of iron-carbohydrate complexes is<br>
known for this purpose. A preparation that is frequently<br>
used successfully in practice is based on a water-soluble<br>
iron(III) hydroxide-saccharose complex (Danielson,<br>
Salmonson, Derendorf, Geisser, Drug Res., Vol. 46 :<br>
615-621, 1996) . Iron-dextran complexes as well as complexes<br>
based on poorly obtainable pullulans (WO 02/46241) , which<br>
have to be prepared under pressure at high temperatures and<br>
with the involvement of hydrogenation steps, are also<br>
described in the prior art for parenteral administration.<br>
Further iron-carbohydrate complexes are conventional for<br>
oral administration.<br>
WO 2004/037865 in the name of the applicants discloses an<br>
iron preparation which is preferably administrable<br>
parenterally and which can be sterilised comparatively<br>
simply; the previously known parenterally administrable<br>
preparations based on saccharose or dextran were stable<br>
only at temperatures up to 100°C, which made sterilisation<br>
difficult. The preparation has reduced toxicity and<br>
involves a reduced risk of dangerous anaphylactic shocks<br>
inducible by dextran. The high stability of the complex<br>
permits a high administration dose or a high administration<br>
rate. The iron preparation can be produced from readily<br>
obtainable starting materials without any particular<br>
outlay. There are disclosed in particular water-soluble<br>
iron(III)-carbohydrate complexes based on the oxidation<br>
products of maltodextrins, and a process for the<br>
preparation thereof. These iron(III)-carbohydrate complexes<br>
are obtainable from an aqueous iron(III) salt solution and<br>
an aqueous solution of the product of the oxidation of one<br>
or more maltodextrins with an aqueous hypochlorite solution<br>
at an alkaline pH value of, for example, from 8 to 12,<br>
wherein when one maltodextrin is used its dextrose<br>
equivalent is from 5 to 2 0 and when a mixture of a<br>
plurality of maltodextrins is used the dextrose equivalent<br>
of the mixture is from 5 to 2 0 and the dextrose equivalent<br>
of the individual maltodextrins in the mixture is from 2 to<br>
40.<br>
T. Nakano et al., Nahrung/Food 47 (2002) No. 4, p. 274-278<br>
describe a process for the phosphorylation of inter alia<br>
dextrin by dry heating in the presence of phosphate.<br>
Degrees of phosphorylation of the dextrin of 1.07 %, 2.42 %<br>
and 3.2 % are mentioned, which are obtained in dependence<br>
on the temperature and moisture content of the dextrin. The<br>
resulting phosphorylated product is tested for its ability<br>
to solubilise phosphate. The possibility of replacing<br>
casein phosphopeptide as calcium phosphate absorption<br>
increasing agent by phosphorylated dextrin is discussed.<br>
Further possible synthesis methods for phosphorylated<br>
dextrins are also mentioned in the mentioned document, in<br>
particular drying with a phosphate-containing solution or<br>
dry phosphorylation with orthophosphate, with heating and<br>
in vacuo.<br>
M.Z. Sitohy et al. , Starch/Stärke 53 (2001), 317-322<br>
describe the phosphorylation of starch by mixing with a<br>
solution of monosodium and disodium phosphate, filtering<br>
off, drying, pulverisation and subsequent heating. The<br>
phosphorylated product is tested for its hydrolytic<br>
stability during acidic and enzymatic hydrolysis, and the<br>
use thereof in admixture with polyacrylate and urea in<br>
biodegradable plastics is proposed.<br>
US 4,841,040 describes the preparation of phosphorylated<br>
dextrins having a molecular weight of from 150 0 to<br>
40,000 daltons and a degree of substitution of from 0.30 to<br>
0.96 and their use as dispersing agents for aqueous<br>
suspensions of minerals and inorganic pigments having a<br>
high solids content, as a replacement for gum arable in<br>
gumming and ink solutions for lithography, and as a<br>
drilling fluid additive. The degree of substitution is<br>
thereby defined by the molar ratio of the derivatised<br>
anhydroglucose units to the total amount of anhydroglucose<br>
units within a molecule. This is referred to hereinbelow as<br>
the degree of molar substitution (MS) . The phosphorylated<br>
dextrins are obtained by oxidation and depolytnerisation of<br>
starch by reaction with sodium hypochlorite in alkaline<br>
medium and subsequent or prior phosphorylation, for example<br>
with phosphoric acid, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphoryl<br>
chloride or polymeric sodium orthophosphates, in particular<br>
sodium trimetaphosphate.<br>
CH-544 779 describes a process for the preparation of<br>
phosphorylated dextrins by heating a mixture of starch and<br>
a phosphoric acid solution at a pH of less than 5, with a<br>
reduced oxygen content, and then further heating in a<br>
second stage, with an even lower oxygen content, until the<br>
phosphorus compound is condensed with the starch product,<br>
and subsequent cooling with a. reduced oxygen content. The<br>
resulting dextrin phosphate has very high water solubility.<br>
Its usability as a surface size for papers and in the<br>
production of adhesives is likewise mentioned.<br>
WO 2006/082043 describes in the introduction some processes<br>
for the preparation of starch phosphates, for example<br>
according to the Neukom process (US 2,884,412) by<br>
suspension in an aqueous alkali phosphate solution,<br>
filtration, drying and tempering at temperatures of about<br>
14 0°C, in a homogeneous process using tetrapolyphosphoric<br>
acid in the presence of tributylamine in dimethylformamide<br>
(Towle et al., Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 6, (1972), 408-410)<br>
or heterogeneously in a slurry process in benzene with<br>
phosphoric anhydride (Tomasik et al. , Starch/Starke 43<br>
(1991), 66-69) . The document itself proposes a process for<br>
the preparation of highly substituted starch phosphates, in<br>
which starch is dissolved in a mixture of phosphating agent<br>
(in particular phosphate salts or urea phosphate) and water<br>
and, if the phosphating agent is free of urea, urea, the<br>
water is removed, and then a thermal reaction to give<br>
starch phosphate takes place. The resulting starch<br>
phosphate has a degree of substitution of phosphate groups<br>
of from 0.01 to 2.0 and a very low content of carbamate<br>
groups. The use of the resulting starch phosphates as an<br>
additive in mineral or dispersion-bonded building material<br>
systems, as an additive in pharmacy and cosmetics, as an<br>
anionic component for polyelectrolyte complexes and as a<br>
carrier material is proposed.<br>
US 3,732,207 discloses the preparation of dextrin esters<br>
using organic dibasic acid anhydrides, in particular<br>
succinic anhydride or maleic anhydride, by heating starch<br>
or dextrin having a residual moisture content of about 3 %<br>
in the presence of the organic acid anhydride in an acidic<br>
environment. A dextrin ester having a degree of molar<br>
substitution of from 0.02 to 0.04 is obtained.<br>
US 4,100,342 describes the preparation of dextrin esters by<br>
reaction of dextrin with acid anhydrides of non-aromatic<br>
carboxylic acids having from 2 to 4 carboxylic acid units<br>
in acetic acid in the presence of a tertiary amine as<br>
catalyst, and the use of the resulting dextrin esters as<br>
biodegradable components for increasing the cleaning action<br>
of detergents.<br>
WO 2004/064850 and WO 92/04904 disclose dextrin sulfates<br>
and their use, either alone or in combination with a<br>
bacteriostatic agent, as an antiviral composition, in<br>
particular for the treatment of HIV and other sexually<br>
transmittable diseases. The dextrin sulfates having a<br>
degree of substitution of up to 2 sulfate groups per<br>
glucose unit are prepared by hydrolysis of starch and<br>
subsequent sulfation. Trimethylamine/sulfur trioxide<br>
complex in an aqueous alkaline medium yields mainly the 2-<br>
sulfate, cyclamic acid in dimethylformamide yields the 6-<br>
sulfate, and acetylation, subsequent sulfation with<br>
trimethylamine/sulfur trioxide complex in dimethylform-<br>
amide, and finally removal of the acetyl group with aqueous<br>
sodium hydroxide yield the 3-sulfate. The action of the<br>
dextrin sulfates against HIV and their antilipidaemic<br>
action are likewise disclosed in these documents.<br>
However, none of the mentioned documents describes the<br>
formation of iron complexes with the resulting dextrin<br>
derivatives.<br>
The object of the present invention is, therefore, to<br>
provide novel iron-carbohydrate complexes which are<br>
suitable for the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia.<br>
The object is achieved by the complexes according to<br>
claim 1. Preferred forms of the complexes are defined in<br>
claims 2 and 3.<br>
The complexes according to the invention are obtained by<br>
the process defined in claims 4 to 10.<br>
Maltodextrins are used as starting material according to<br>
the invention. These are readily obtainable starting<br>
materials which are available commercially.<br>
For the preparation of the ligands of the complexes<br>
according to the invention, the maltodextrins are first<br>
oxidised in aqueous solution with hypochlorite solution.<br>
This process is already described in WO 2004/037865, the<br>
totality of the disclosure of which is incorporated by<br>
reference herein.<br>
There are suitable, for example, solutions of alkali<br>
hypochlorites, such as sodium hypochlorite solution.<br>
Commercial solutions can be used. The concentrations of the<br>
hypochlorite solutions are, for example, at least 13 wt.%,<br>
preferably of the order of magnitude of from 14 to 16 wt.%,<br>
in each case calculated as active chlorine. The solutions<br>
are preferably used in an amount such that approximately<br>
from 80 to 100 %, preferably approximately 90 %, of an<br>
aldehyde group is oxidised per maltodextrin molecule. In<br>
this manner, the reducing power determined by the glucose<br>
contents of the maltodextrin molecules is reduced to<br>
approximately 20 % or less, preferably to 10 % or less.<br>
The oxidation takes place in alkaline solution, for example<br>
a pH values of from 8 to 12, for example from 9 to 11. For<br>
the oxidation it is possible to work, for example, at<br>
temperatures of the order of magnitude of from 15 to 4 0°C,<br>
preferably from 2 0 to 35°C. The reaction times are, for<br>
example, of the order of magnitude of from 10 minutes to<br>
4 hours, for example from 1 to 1.5 hours.<br>
By means of the described procedure, the degree of<br>
depolymerisation of the maltodextrins used is kept low.<br>
Without giving a binding theory, it is assumed that the<br>
oxidation takes place predominantly at the terminal<br>
aldehyde group (or semiacetal group) of the maltodextrin<br>
molecules. For the sake of simplicity, this synthesis step<br>
is referred to hereinbelow as "C1 oxidation", but this term<br>
is not intended to be binding.<br>
It is also possible to catalyse the oxidation reaction of<br>
the maltodextrins. The addition of bromide ions, for<br>
example in the form of alkali bromides, for example sodium<br>
bromide, is suitable for this purpose. The amount of<br>
bromide added is not critical. It is kept as small as<br>
possible in order to obtain an end product (Fe complex)<br>
that is as simple to purify as possible. Catalytic amounts<br>
are sufficient. As mentioned, the addition of bromide is<br>
possible but not necessary.<br>
In addition, it is also possible, for example, to use the<br>
known ternary oxidation system hypochlorite/alkali<br>
bromide/2,2,6, 6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPO) for the<br>
oxidation of the maltodextrins. The procedure of oxidising<br>
maltodextrins with alkali bromide catalysis or using the<br>
ternary TEMPO system is described, for example, by Thaburet<br>
et al. in Carbohydrate Research 330 (2001) 21-29; the<br>
procedure described therein can be used according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Working up and isolation of the oxidised maltodextrins are<br>
carried out by adjusting the reaction solution to an<br>
approximately neutral pH by means of suitable acids or<br>
buffers, such as, for example, hydrochloric: acid, sulfuric<br>
acid or acetic acid.<br>
The oxidised reaction product can then be precipitated by<br>
addition of a suitable solvent in which it is substantially<br>
insoluble. An example of a suitable solvent is ethanol,<br>
which is preferably used in a concentration of from 8 0 to<br>
95 wt.%, particularly preferably from 90 to 94 wt.%, in a<br>
volume ratio ethanol:reaction solution of approximately<br>
from 1:5 to.1:10, preferably from 1:5 to 1:8. Further<br>
suitable precipitation solvents are methanol, propanol or<br>
acetone. The precipitate is then filtered off and dried in<br>
a conventional manner.<br>
Alternatively, the reaction solution can be purified by<br>
means of dialysis or membrane filtration and the product<br>
can be obtained by lyophilisation or spray drying.<br>
It is also possible, however, to use the C1-oxidised<br>
maltodextrin directly in the subsequent derivatisation step<br>
without isolating it.<br>
The subsequent derivatisation of the resulting C1-oxidised<br>
products takes place by conventional processes, known to<br>
the person skilled in the art, for the derivatisation of<br>
sugars, for example by oxidation, esterification with mono-<br>
or poly-functional inorganic or organic acids or acid<br>
derivatives, carboxyalkylation, addition of organic<br>
isocyanates, etherification, amidation, anhydride<br>
formation, etc.<br>
For example, an esterification can be carried out with<br>
organic acids or acid derivatives. Any carboxylic acids or<br>
reactive carboxylic acid derivatives known to the person<br>
skilled in the art can be used for the esterif ication,<br>
preferably acid chlorides, anhydrides or bromides. C1-C6-<br>
Carboxylic acid derivatives are preferably used for the<br>
esterification, particularly preferably acetic anhydride.<br>
The esterification is carried out under conventional<br>
reaction conditions, for example in aqueous solution or in<br>
a suitable solvent such as, for example, formamide,<br>
dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide or acetic acid. The<br>
reaction in aqueous solution can take place, for example,<br>
at a slightly basic pH of approximately from 7.5 to 10,<br>
preferably from 8 to 9.5 (the pH can be adjusted and kept<br>
constant during the reaction using any desired bases, for<br>
example alkali or alkaline earth hydroxides such as sodium<br>
or potassium hydroxide as well as alkali or alkaline earth<br>
carbonates) by addition of the reactive carboxylic acid<br>
derivative, for example acetyl chloride or acetic<br>
anhydride. When a different solvent is used, the same<br>
reagents are employed and suitable reaction conditions are<br>
chosen. The reaction can take place in the mentioned<br>
solvents at room temperature, with cooling or with heating.<br>
The reaction time is, for example, from 0.5 to 2 hours,<br>
preferably from 0.75 to 1.5 hours. Working up is carried<br>
out as described for the C1 oxidation by precipitation,<br>
filtering off and drying.<br>
An esterification with polybasic organic carboxylic acids<br>
can also take place in the same manner, for example the<br>
preparation of succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid,<br>
glutaric acid or adipic acid esters, it being possible for<br>
the second carboxyl group of the ester either to be free or<br>
to be in the form of the alkyl ester. The anhydrides, mixed<br>
anhydrides, chlorides or bromides or other reactive<br>
derivatives of the polybasic carboxylic acids are suitable<br>
for the preparation, for example in particular succinic<br>
anhydride, maleic anhydride, glutaric anhydride, adipic<br>
anhydride or fumaric acid dichloride. The reaction and<br>
working up are carried out as described for the<br>
esterification. Particular preference is given to<br>
esterification with succinic anhydride to give succinyl<br>
maltodextrin.<br>
The C1-oxidised maltodextrins can likewise be reacted to<br>
give carboxyalkyl derivatives. Suitable as reagent are<br>
carboxyalkyl halides known to the person skilled in the<br>
art, for example halocarboxylic acids such as chloro- or<br>
bromo-carboxylic acids or their sodium or potassium salts,<br>
for example C1-C6-carboxylic acids halogenated in any<br>
desired position, such as, for example, a- or (3-<br>
bromopropionic acid or, particularly preferably, chloro- or<br>
bromo-acetic acid.<br>
The reaction is carried out in a manner known to the person<br>
skilled in the art, for example in aqueous solution or in a<br>
suitable solvent such as, for example, formamide,<br>
dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide or acetic acid. In<br>
aqueous solution, the reaction is carried out, for example,<br>
at a basic pH (pH 11 to 14, preferably approximately 12.5<br>
to 14, adjustment using any desired bases, e.g. NaOH) . When<br>
a different solvent is used, the same reagents are employed<br>
and suitable reaction conditions are chosen. The reaction<br>
can take place in the mentioned solvents at room<br>
temperature, with cooling or with heating for, for example,<br>
from 0.5 to 5 hours, preferably approximately from 2.5 to<br>
3.5 hours. Working up and isolation are carried out as<br>
described for the esterification.<br>
The esterification with reactive derivatives of inorganic<br>
acids, for example the sulfation or phosphation, likewise<br>
take place by processes known to the person skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
The sulfation is carried out, for example, in aqueous<br>
solution or in a suitable solvent such as, for example,<br>
formamide, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide or acetic<br>
acid, using a suitable sulfation reagent, for example SO3-<br>
trimethylamine complex or cyclamic acid, at room<br>
temperature, with cooling or with heating, preferably, for<br>
example, at 3 0°C for a suitable time, for example from<br>
15 minutes to 2 hours, preferably for approximately<br>
3 0 minutes. Then, when water is used as solvent, the pH of<br>
the reaction solution is rendered strongly basic (e.g. to<br>
pH 12-13) and the solution is stirred further at a suitable<br>
temperature, for example at 3 0°C. After acidification to pH<br>
9.5 to 11, preferably approximately 10.5, using a suitable<br>
acid or a buffer, such as, for example, HCl, precipitation<br>
and isolation are carried out as described for the C1<br>
oxidation.<br>
The phosphation is carried out according to any process<br>
known to those skilled in the art. One possibility-<br>
comprises dissolving dextrin in water with the phosphating<br>
reagent and establishing a pH value of from 2 to 6,<br>
preferably approximately 3. Suitable phosphating reagents<br>
are any known reagents, a mixture of sodium dihydrogen<br>
phosphate/disodium hydrogen phosphate in a molar ratio of<br>
from 1:0.5 to 1:2.5, for example 1:1.8, preferably being<br>
used. The reaction solution can be precipitated with<br>
ethanol, methanol or acetone, for example, and the<br>
precipitate can be isolated and dried, or the reaction<br>
solution is concentrated to dryness by evaporation, for<br>
example in a rotary evaporator, and dried further,<br>
preferably at elevated temperature and in vacuo. After<br>
grinding, the product is heated in the dry state, for<br>
example to from 120 to 180°C, preferably from 150 to 170°C,<br>
preferably in vacuo, and then ground again and subsequently<br>
dissolved in water or a suitable solvent, preferably at an<br>
elevated temperature of, for example, 50°C Insoluble<br>
residues are then separated off, for example by<br>
centrifugation or filtration, and the resulting solution is<br>
purified by membrane filtration in order to remove free<br>
orthophosphate. The filtration can be monitored by IR<br>
spectroscopy or conductivity measurement. When all the<br>
orthophosphate has been removed, the solution is<br>
concentrated using a rotary evaporator and then<br>
precipitated and isolated as described for the<br>
esterification.<br>
C2/C3-Oxidised derivatives can. be obtained by oxidation,<br>
known to the person skilled in the art, of the C1-oxidised<br>
maltodextrin with a suitable oxidising agent such as, for<br>
example, NaOCl or NaIO4/NaOCl2. The oxidation is carried<br>
out, for example, in aqueous solution or in a suitable<br>
solvent such as dimethylformamide, formamide, dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide or acetic acid, at room temperature, with heating<br>
or with cooling. When water is used as solvent, the<br>
reaction takes place at a slightly basic, constant pH of<br>
from 7.5 to 9.5, preferably from 8.5 to 9.0, for example by<br>
sodium hypochlorite at approximately 50°C. The pH is then<br>
adjusted to neutral, for example by addition of HCl, and<br>
the product is subsequently precipitated and isolated as<br>
described for the esterification.<br>
By using different amounts of the respective reagents for<br>
the derivatisation, different degrees of molar substitution<br>
can be achieved. The degree of molar substitution is<br>
defined by the molar ratio of the derivatised<br>
anhydroglucose units to the total amount of anhydroglucose<br>
units within a molecule.<br>
The products are investigated by IR spectroscopy. In this<br>
manner it is possible to determine qualitatively whether<br>
the desired functional group has been introduced into the<br>
maltodextrin. The introduction of a carboxyl group, for<br>
example of an acetyl group, succinyl group or carboxymethyl<br>
group, can be monitored by augmentation of the band at<br>
1740 cm-1 in the IR spectrum (C=O valence vibration of<br>
COOR) . The successful C2/C3 oxidation can be monitored by<br>
augmentation of the band at 1640 cm-1 (C=O valence vibration<br>
of COO-) . The introduction of a sulfate group can be<br>
confirmed by increase of the bands at 1260 and 830 cm-1<br>
(valence vibrations of SO42-) . The introduction of a<br>
phosphate group can also be confirmed qualitatively by 31P-<br>
NMR spectroscopy. Polymer-bound monophosphate appears in<br>
the form of broad signals at about 0 to 2 ppm, while free<br>
monophosphate shows a sharp signal at about 0.7 ppm.<br>
The quantitative determination of the degree of molar<br>
substitution can be carried out by 1H-NMR spectroscopy or<br>
13C-NMR spectroscopy, by relating the intensity of a signal<br>
assigned to the introduced functional group to the<br>
intensity of a signal of the maltodextrin that has not been<br>
influenced by the derivatisation. In the case of<br>
phosphation, the quantitative determination of the degree<br>
of molar substitution can also be carried out by ICP-OES<br>
(Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy,<br>
total phosphate content) and ion chromatography coupled<br>
with conductivity measurement (content of free<br>
monophosphate).<br>
For the preparation of the complexes according to the<br>
invention, the resulting oxidised derivatised maltodextrins<br>
are reacted in aqueous solution with an iron(III) salt. To<br>
this end, the oxidised derivatised maltodextrins can be<br>
isolated and dissolved again; the resulting aqueous<br>
solutions of the oxidised derivatised maltodextrins can,<br>
however, also be used directly for further processing with<br>
aqueous iron(III) solutions.<br>
As iron(III) salts there can be used water-soluble salts of<br>
inorganic or organic acids or mixtures thereof, such as<br>
halides, for example chloride and bromide, or sulfates.<br>
Physiologically acceptable salts are preferably used. An<br>
aqueous solution of iron(III) chloride is particularly<br>
preferably used.<br>
It has been shown that the presence of chloride ions has an<br>
advantageous effect on the complex formation. Chloride ions<br>
can be added, for example, in the form of water-soluble<br>
chlorides, such as alkali metal chlorides, e.g. sodium<br>
chloride, potassium chloride or ammonium chloride.<br>
Preference is given, as mentioned, to the use of iron (III)<br>
in the form of the chloride.<br>
For the reaction, it is possible, for example, to mix the<br>
aqueous solution of the oxidised maltodextrin with an<br>
aqueous solution of the iron(III) salt. The procedure<br>
thereby is preferably such that the pH value of the mixture<br>
of oxidised maltodextrin and iron (III) salt during and<br>
immediately after mixing is initially strongly acidic or is<br>
sufficiently low that hydrolysis of the iron (III) salt does<br>
not occur, for example 2 or less, in order to avoid<br>
undesirable precipitation of iron hydroxides. When<br>
iron(III) chloride is used, it is generally not necessary<br>
to add an acid because aqueous solutions of iron(III)<br>
chloride can themselves be sufficiently acidic. When mixing<br>
has taken place, the pH value can be raised, for example,<br>
to values of the order of magnitude of equal to or greater<br>
than 5, for example up to 11, 12, 13 or 14. Raising of the<br>
pH value is preferably carried out slowly or gradually,<br>
which can be effected, for example, by first adding a weak<br>
base, for example to a pH of approximately 3; further<br>
neutralisation can then take place using a stronger base.<br>
Suitable weak bases are, for example, alkali or alkaline<br>
earth carbonates, bicarbonates, such as sodium and<br>
potassium carbonate or bicarbonate, or ammonia. Strong<br>
bases are, for example, alkali or alkaline earth<br>
hydroxides, such as sodium, potassium, calcium or magnesium<br>
hydroxide.<br>
The reaction can be furthered by heating. For example,<br>
temperatures of the order of magnitude of from 15°C to the<br>
boiling temperature can be applied. It is preferred to<br>
increase the temperature gradually. For example, heating<br>
can be carried out first to approximately from 15 to 70°C<br>
and then the temperature can be gradually increased to<br>
boiling.<br>
The reaction times are, for example, of the order of<br>
magnitude of from 15 minutes to several hours, e.g. from<br>
2 0 minutes to 4 hours, for example from 25 to 7 0 minutes,<br>
e.g. from 3 0 to 60 minutes.<br>
The reaction can take place in the weakly acidic range, for<br>
example at pH values of the order of magnitude of from 5 to<br>
6. It has been shown, however, that it is advantageous,<br>
although not necessary, to raise the pH value to higher<br>
values, up to 11, 12, 13 or 14, in the course of the<br>
complex formation. In order to complete the reaction, the<br>
pH value can then be lowered further, for example to the<br>
mentioned order of magnitude of from 5 to 6, by the<br>
addition of an acid. As acids there can be used inorganic<br>
or organic acids or mixtures thereof, in particular<br>
hydrohalic acids, such as hydrogen chloride or aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid.<br>
As mentioned, the complex formation is generally furthered<br>
by heating. For example, in the preferred embodiment in<br>
which the pH value is increased in the course of the<br>
reaction to ranges of from beyond 5 to 11 or 14, it is<br>
possible first to work at low temperatures of the order of<br>
magnitude of from 15 to 70°C, for example from 40 to 60°C,<br>
e.g. at approximately 50°C, whereupon, after again lowering<br>
the pH value to values of, for example, the order of<br>
magnitude of at least 5, gradual heating is carried out to<br>
temperatures of from above 50°C to the boiling temperature.<br>
The reaction times are of the order of magnitude of from<br>
15 minutes to several hours and can vary according to the<br>
reaction temperature. When the process is carried out with<br>
the temporary application of pH values that are above 5, it<br>
is possible to work at the elevated pH value for from 15 to<br>
70 minutes, for example, e.g.. for from 30 to 60 minutes,<br>
for example at temperatures up to 70°C, whereupon, after<br>
lowering the pH value to the range of the order of<br>
magnitude of at least 5, the reaction can be carried out<br>
for a further 15 to 70 minutes, e.g. 3 0 to 60 minutes, at<br>
temperatures of up to, for example, 70°C and optionally for<br>
a further 15 to 70 minutes, e.g. 3 0 to 60 minutes, at<br>
higher temperatures up to the boiling point.<br>
When the reaction has been carried out, the resulting<br>
solution can, for example, be cooled to room temperature<br>
and optionally diluted and optionally filtered. After<br>
cooling, the pH value can be adjusted to the neutral point<br>
or slightly below, for example to values of from 5 to 7, by<br>
addition of acid or base. There can be used as acids or<br>
bases, for example, those mentioned above for the reaction.<br>
The resulting solutions are purified and can be used<br>
directly for the preparation of medicaments. However, it is<br>
also possible to isolate the iron(III) complexes from the<br>
solution, for example by precipitation with an alcohol,<br>
such as an alkanol, for example ethanol. The isolation can<br>
also be carried out by spray drying. Purification can be<br>
carried out in a conventional manner, in particular in<br>
order to remove salts. This can be effected, for example,<br>
by reverse osmosis, it being possible for such a reverse<br>
osmosis to be carried out, for example, before the spray<br>
drying or before the direct use in medicaments.<br>
The resulting iron(III)-carbohydrate complexes have, for<br>
example, an iron content of from 10 to 40 % wt./wt., in<br>
particular from 20 to 35 % wt./wt. They are readily soluble<br>
in water. It is possible to prepare therefrom neutral<br>
aqueous solutions having an iron content of, for example,<br>
from 1 % wt./vol. to 20 % wt./vol. Such solutions can be<br>
sterilised by means of heat. The weight-average molecular<br>
weight Mw of the complexes so obtained is, for example,<br>
from 80 kDa to 800 kDa, preferably from 80 to 650 kDa,<br>
particularly preferably up to 350 kDa (determined by means<br>
of gel permeation chromatography, for example as described<br>
by Geisser et el. in Arzneim. Forsch/Drug Res. 42(II), 12,<br>
1439-1452 (1992), Section 2.2.5.).<br>
As mentioned, aqueous solutions can be prepared from the<br>
complexes according to the invention. Such solutions are<br>
suitable in particular for parenteral administration.<br>
However, they can also be administered orally or topically.<br>
They can be sterilised at high temperatures, e.g. at 121°C<br>
and above, with short contact times of at least 15 minutes<br>
with achievement of F0 = 15. F0 is the treatment time in<br>
minutes at a variable temperature that corresponds to the<br>
treatment time in minutes at 121°C calculated for an ideal<br>
microorganism having a temperature coefficient of microbial<br>
decomposition of 10. Preparations known hitherto had in<br>
some cases to be sterile filtered at room temperature<br>
and/or have preservatives, such as benzyl alcohol or<br>
phenol, added thereto. Such working steps or additives are<br>
not necessary according to the invention. It is possible to<br>
introduce the solutions of the complexes into ampoules, for<br>
example. For example, solutions of from 1 to 20 wt.%, for<br>
example 5 wt.%, can be introduced into vessels, such as<br>
ampoules or vials, of, for example, from 2 to 100 ml, for<br>
example up to 50 ml. The preparation of the parenterally<br>
administrable solutions can be carried out in a<br>
conventional manner, optionally with the concomitant use of<br>
additives conventional for parenteral solutions. The<br>
solutions can be so formulated that they can be<br>
administered as such by injection or as an infusion, for<br>
example in saline solution. For oral or topical<br>
administration, preparations can be formulated with<br>
appropriate conventional excipients and auxiliary-<br>
substances .<br>
The invention therefore further provides medicaments which<br>
are suitable in particular for parenteral, intravenous as<br>
well as intramuscular administration and also for oral or<br>
topical administration, and which can be used in particular<br>
for the treatment of iron deficiency anaemias. The<br>
invention therefore further provides the use of the<br>
iron(III)-carbohydrate derivative complexes according to<br>
the invention in the treatment and prophylaxis of iron<br>
deficiency anaemias or in the preparation of medicaments<br>
for in particular the parenteral treatment of iron<br>
deficiency anaemias. The medicaments are suitable for use<br>
in human and veterinary medicine.<br>
According to the invention it is possible for the first<br>
time to prepare iron complexes of maltodextrin derivatives.<br>
Compared with the iron-maltodextrin complexes known from WO<br>
2004/037865, the iron-maltodextrin derivative complexes<br>
according to the invention permit a specific and fine<br>
adjustment of the molecular weight over a wide range to<br>
higher molecular weights, which was not possible with the<br>
known complexes.<br>
The majority of the iron-maltodextrin derivative complexes<br>
exhibit a virtually unchanged degradation kinetics (© =<br>
0.5) as compared with the iron-maltodextrin complexes known<br>
from WO 2004/037865.<br>
Most derivatised maltodextrin complexes exhibit increased<br>
stability towards enzymatic degradation by amylase as<br>
compared with underivatised maltodextrin, which can promote<br>
retarded and uniform degradation of the iron-maltodextrin<br>
derivative complexes according to the invention in the<br>
body..<br>
The iron yields of the complex derivatives according to the<br>
invention reach 100 % (in particular in the case of the<br>
sulfated complex derivatives), as compared with 87 to 93 %<br>
in the known iron-maltodextrin complexes, which represents<br>
an economic advantage for production on a commercial scale.<br>
Examples<br>
In the present description and the examples which follow,<br>
dextrose equivalents are determined gravimetrically. To<br>
this end, the maltodextrins are reacted in aqueous solution<br>
with Fehling's solution, at boiling. The reaction takes<br>
place quantitatively, i.e. until no further discolouration<br>
of the Fehling's solution occurs. The precipitated<br>
copper(I) oxide is dried to a constant weight at 105°C and<br>
determined gravimetrically. The glucose content (dextrose<br>
equivalent) is calculated from the resulting values as %<br>
wt./wt. of maltodextrin dry substance. For example, it is<br>
possible to work with the following solutions: 25 ml of<br>
Fehling's solution I, mixed with 25 ml of Fehling's<br>
solution II; 10 ml of aqueous maltodextrin solution (10 %<br>
mol/vol.) (Fehling's solution I: 34.6 g of copper(II)<br>
sulfate dissolved in 500 ml of water; Fehling's solution<br>
II: 173 g of potassium sodium tartrate and 50 g of sodium<br>
hydroxide, dissolved in 400 ml of water).<br>

Example 1<br>
Preparation of C1-oxidised maltodextrin<br>
2 50 g of maltodextrin having a dextrose equivalent of 12<br>
were dissolved in 750 ml of water. 1.4 g of NaBr were<br>
added, and 78.4 g of NaOCl solution (14 to 16 wt.% active<br>
chlorine) were metered in in the course of 30 minutes, the<br>
pH being kept constant at 9.5 (±0.5) by addition of<br>
3 0 wt.% NaOH. The pH was then adjusted to 7.0 using HCl<br>
(20 wt.%), and the product was precipitated by addition of<br>
ethanol (92 wt.%) in a volume ratio of 1:6<br>
(solution:ethanol). The product was isolated by decanting<br>
off the supernatant solution and was dried for 24 hours at<br>
50°C and 125 mber.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of C1-oxidised maltodextrin<br>
10 0 g of maltodextrin (9.6 dextrose equivalents, determined<br>
gravimetrically) are dissolved at 25°C, with stirring, in<br>
300 ml of water and oxidised at pH 10 by addition of 30 g<br>
of sodium hypochlorite solution (14 to 16 wt.% active<br>
chlorine) and isolated and dried as in Example 1.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of C1-oxidised maltodextrin<br>
A mixture of 45 g of maltodextrin (6.6 dextrose<br>
equivalents, determined gravimetrically) and 45 g of<br>
maltodextrin (14.0 dextrose equivalents, determined<br>
gravimetrically) is dissolved at 25°C, with stirring, in<br>
300 ml of water and oxidised at pH 10 by addition of 25 g<br>
of sodium hypochlorite solution (14 to 16 wt. % active<br>
chlorine) and isolated and dried as in Example 1.<br>
Examples 4 to 7<br>
Acetylation<br>
2 00 g of maltodextrin obtained in Example 1 (1.23 mol of<br>
anhydroglucose) were dissolved at 25°C in 660 ml of water,<br>
and the pH was adjusted to 8.5 using 30 wt. % NaOH. Acetic<br>
anhydride was added at a rate of 1.7 ml/min. in various<br>
amounts shown in Table 1, the pH being kept constant at 8.5<br>
(± 0.5) by addition of 3 0 wt.. % NaOH. The solution was<br>
stirred for one hour at a constant pH of 8.5 (± 0.5) and<br>
then adjusted to 7. 0 using 2 0 wt. % HCl. The product was<br>
precipitated with ethanol (92 wt.%) in a volume ratio of<br>
1:6 (solution:ethanol). The product was isolated by<br>
decanting off the supernatant solution and was dried for<br>
24 hours at 50°C and 125 mbar.<br>
By varying the amount of added acetic anhydride, different<br>
degrees of acetylation were obtained. The results are shown<br>
in Table 1.<br>
Owing to the acetylation, the solubility of the<br>
maltodextrin derivative in ethanol increases, which results<br>
in a falling yield with an increasing degree of<br>
substitution.<br>
The degree of acetylation was determined qualitatively by<br>
IR spectroscopy and quantitatively by NMR spectroscopy.<br>
The acetylation can be monitored by IR spectroscopy by<br>
augmentation of the band at 1740 cm-1 (C=0 valence vibration<br>
of COOR). The degree of molar acetylation was determined by<br>
1H-NMR spectroscopy by the ratio of the intensity of the CH3<br>
signal at 2.0-2.3 ppm (acetyl group) to the intensity of<br>
the signal at 3.0-4.5 ppm and 5-6 ppm (7 protons of the<br>
anhydroglucose group).<br>
Examples 8 to 11<br>
Succinylation<br>
2 00 g of C1-oxidised maltodextrin obtained in Example 1 were<br>
dissolved in 655 ml of water. The pH was adjusted to 8.5<br>
using 30 wt. % NaOH, and succinic anhydride was added in<br>
portions at 25°C in the course of one hour, the pH being<br>
kept constant at 8.5 (±0.5) by addition of 3 0 wt. % NaOH.<br>
The pH was then adjusted to 7.0 by addition of 2 0 wt. % HC1<br>
and the product was precipitated with ethanol (92 wt.%) in<br>
a volume ratio solution:ethanol of 1:6. The product was<br>
isolated by decanting off the supernatant solution and was<br>
dried for 24 hours at 50°C and 125 mbar.<br>
By varying the added amount of succinic anhydride,<br>
different degrees of succinylation were obtained. The<br>
results are shown in Table 2.<br>
The succinylation did not significantly affect the<br>
solubility of the oxidised maltodextrin.<br>
The succinylation can be monitored qualitatively by IR<br>
spectroscopy by augmentation of the band at 174 0 cm-1 (C=0<br>
valence vibration of COOR/COOH). The degree of molar<br>
succinylation was determined by 1H-NMR spectroscopy by the<br>
ratio of the intensity of the two CH2 signals at 2.4-2.7 ppm<br>
(succinyl group) to the intensity of the signal at<br>
3.0-4.5 ppm and 5-6 ppm (7 protons of the anhydroglucose<br>
group).<br>
Examples 12 to 16<br>
Carboxymethylation<br>
200 g of C1-oxidised maltodextrin obtained in Example 1 were<br>
dissolved in 660 ml of water. 118 g of solid NaOH were<br>
added so that the pH was 13-14. Chloroacetic acid was added<br>
in portions in the course of 2 0 minutes, and then stirring<br>
was carried out at 25°C for 3 hours. The pH was then<br>
adjusted to 7.0 by addition of 20 wt. % HC1, and the product<br>
was precipitated with ethanol (92 wt.%) in a volume ratio<br>
solution:ethanol of 1:6. The product was isolated by<br>
decanting off the supernatant solution and was dried for<br>
24 hours at 50°C and 125 mbar.<br>
By varying the added amount of chloroacetic acid, different<br>
degrees of carboxymethylation were obtained. The results<br>
are shown in Table 3.<br>
The degrees of carboxymethylation achieved did not<br>
significantly affect the solubility of the oxidised<br>
maltodextrin.<br>
It is not possible to monitor the carboxymethylation by IR<br>
spectroscopy because of the low degrees of substitution in<br>
these examples. (No clear band at 174 0 cm-1 of the C=O<br>
valence vibration.) The degree of molar carboxymethylation<br>
was determined by 1H-NMR spectroscopy by the ratio of the<br>
intensity of the anomeric protons at 5.6 ppm<br>
(carboxymethylated anhydroglucose group) to the intensity<br>
of the signal of the anomeric protons at 4.8-5.8 ppm<br>
(anhydroglucose group without derivatisation).<br>
Examples 17 to 20<br>
Sulfation<br>
200 g of C1-oxidised maltodextrin obtained in Example 1 were<br>
dissolved in 600 ml of water and heated to 30°C. SO3-<br>
trimethylamine complex was added and the mixture was<br>
stirred at 3 0°C for 30 minutes (during which the suspension<br>
changed into a solution). 40 wt.% NaOH (1.7 equivalents,<br>
based on the molar amount of SO3-trimethylamine complex,<br>
corresponding to 18-141 ml depending on the degree of<br>
substitution) were added at a rate of 2.8 ml/min., and the<br>
solution was stirred at 30°C for 2.5 hours. The pH was<br>
adjusted to 10.5 with 2 0 wt.% HCl. The product was<br>
precipitated with 92 wt.% ethanol in a volume ratio<br>
solution:ethanol of 1:7 to 1:8. The product was isolated by<br>
decanting off the supernatant solution and was dried for<br>
24 hours at 50°C and 125 mbar.<br>
By varying the added amount of SO3-triethylamine complex,<br>
different degrees of sulfation were obtained. The results<br>
are shown in Table 4.<br>
The reason for the increasing yield of oxidised sulfated<br>
maltodextrin is the decreasing solubility of the product in<br>
ethanol.<br>
The degree of sulfation can be monitored qualitatively by<br>
IR spectroscopy (augmentation, of the bands at 1260 and<br>
83 0 cm-1, valence vibrations of SO42) . The degree of molar<br>
sulfation was determined by 13C-NMR spectroscopy by the<br>
ratio of the intensity of the C1 signal at 96 ppm (sulfated<br>
species) to the intensity of the C1 signal at 103 ppm (non-<br>
sulfated species).<br>
Examples 21 to 24<br>
Phosphation<br>
3 00 g of C1-oxidised maltodextrin obtained in Example 1,<br>
NaH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 (molar ratio 1:1.8) were dissolved in<br>
1.5 litres of water and the pH was adjusted to 3.0 using<br>
20 wt.% HCl. The solution was concentrated to dryness by<br>
evaporation in a rotary evaporator at 70°C and 125 mbar. The<br>
residue was dried for 16 hours at 50°C and 12 5 mbar. This<br>
product was ground and heated to 160°C over a period of<br>
4 hours at 750 mbar. This material was ground again and<br>
dissolved for one hour in water in a weight ratio of 1:4.4<br>
(solid:water) at 50°C. The solution was cooled to 2 5°C and<br>
the insoluble residues were separated off by centrifugation<br>
(550 0 rpm for 1 hour).<br>
In order to remove free orthophosphate, the resulting<br>
solution was filtered by membrane filtration using a<br>
nanofiltration membrane (Nitto-Denko NTR-7410, average NaCl<br>
retention 10 %) at 22 bar and a flow rate of<br>
180-210 litres/hour. The removal of the free orthophosphate<br>
was monitored by IR spectroscopy of the washed fractions.<br>
The solution of the oxidised phosphated maltodextrin was<br>
concentrated to 1 litre in a rotary evaporator at 60°C and<br>
80-250 mbar, and then the product was precipitated with<br>
ethanol in a volume ratio of 1:6 (solution:ethanol). The<br>
product was separated off by centrifugation of the<br>
suspension (5500 rpm for 1 hour) and was dried for 24 hours<br>
at 50°C and 125 mbar.<br>
By varying the added amount of the mixture of NaH2PO4 and<br>
Na2HPO4 in a molar ratio of 1:1.8, different degrees of<br>
phosphation were obtained. The results are shown in<br>
Table 5.<br>
The degree of molar substitution was determined by ICP-OES<br>
(Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy,<br>
total phosphate content) and ion chromatography coupled<br>
with conductivity measurement (content of free<br>
monophosphate).<br>
A qualitative determination of the content of free<br>
monophosphate was carried out by 31P-NMR spectroscopy.<br>
Polymer-bound monophosphate appears in the form of broad<br>
signals in the region of about 0-2 ppm, while free<br>
monophosphate exhibits a sharp peak at about 0.7 ppm. The<br>
broad signal at -10 ppm can be assigned to oligophosphates.<br>
Examples 25 to 29<br>
C2/C3 oxidation (two-stage synthesis)<br>
200 g of C1-oxidised maltodextrin obtained in Example 1 were<br>
dissolved in 600 ml of water and the solution was heated to<br>
50°C. The pH was adjusted to 8.5 to 9.0 using 20 wt.% HCl,<br>
and 20 g of NaOCl (14 to 16 % active chlorine) were added<br>
in a single batch. The residual amount of NaOCl was added<br>
at a rate of 5.8 ml/min., the pH being kept constant at 8.5<br>
(± 0.5) by addition of 3 0 wt.% NaOH. The solution was<br>
stirred for 1 hour at 50°C and pH 8.5 (± 0.5). The pH was<br>
then adjusted to 7 using 20 wt.% HCl. The product was<br>
precipitated with 92 wt.% ethanol in a volume ratio<br>
solution:ethanol of 1:6. The product was isolated by<br>
decanting off the supernatant solution and was dried for<br>
24 hours at 50°C and 125 mbar.<br>
Example 3 0<br>
C1/C2/C3 oxidation (single-stage synthesis, in situ<br>
derivatisation)<br>
200 g of maltodextrin having a dextrose equivalent of 12<br>
were dissolved in 660 ml of water and the solution was<br>
heated to 50°C. 1.1 g of NaBr were added, and 135.2 g of<br>
NaOCl solution (14 to 16 wt.% active chlorine) were metered<br>
in in the course of 3 0 minutes, the pH being kept constant<br>
at 9.5 (± 0.5) by addition of 3 0 wt.% NaOH. The solution<br>
was stirred for 1 hour at 50°C and pH 9.5 (± 0.5) . The pH<br>
was then adjusted to 7 using 20 wt.% HCl. The product was<br>
precipitated with 92 wt.% ethanol in a volume ratio<br>
solution:ethanol of 1:6. The product was isolated by<br>
decanting off the supernatant solution and was dried for<br>
2 4 hours at 5 0°C and 12 5 mbar.<br>
By varying the added amount of NaOCl (14-16 % active<br>
chlorine), different degrees of molar C2/C3 oxidation were<br>
obtained. The results are shown in Table 6.<br>
The variation in the isolated yield of the resulting<br>
products is small.<br>
It was possible to monitor the degree of C2/C3 oxidation by<br>
IR spectroscopy by an augmentation of the band at 1640 cm"1<br>
(C=0 valence vibration of COO-) .<br>
The degree of molar C2/C3 oxidation was determined by 13C-NMR<br>
spectroscopy by the ratio of the intensity of the COOH<br>
signal at 175 and 176 ppm (oxidised C2 and C3) to the<br>
intensity of the signal at 76-84 ppm (unoxidised C2) .<br>
General process specification 1: Preparation of iron<br>
complexes<br>
The preparation of iron complexes from the resulting<br>
oxidised derivatised maltodextrins was carried out in each<br>
case using 100 g of the maltodextrin derivative:<br>
To 352 g of iron(III) chloride solution (12 % wt./wt. Fe)<br>
there were added, with stirring (paddle stirrer) , at room<br>
temperature, first 100 g of the oxidised derivatised<br>
maltodextrin dissolved in 300 ml of water, and then 554 g<br>
of sodium carbonate solution (17.3 % wt./wt.).<br>
A pH of 11 was then established by addition of sodium<br>
hydroxide solution, and the solution was heated to 50°C and<br>
maintained at 5 0°C for 3 0 minutes. The mixture was then<br>
acidified to a pH of 5 to 6 by addition of hydrochloric<br>
acid, and the solution was maintained at 50°C for a further<br>
3 0 minutes and then heated to 97-98°C and maintained at that<br>
temperature for 3 0 minutes. After cooling the solution to<br>
room temperature, the pH value was adjusted to 6-7 by<br>
addition of sodium hydroxide solution. The solution was<br>
then filtered over a sterile filter and the complex was<br>
isolated by precipitation with ethanol in a ratio of 1:0.85<br>

having a degree of molar substitution &gt; 0.01 resulted in<br>
instable products.<br>
The iron contents of the carboxymethylated iron complexes<br>
were found to be slightly reduced as compared with the<br>
standard, and the molecular weights rose as the degree of<br>
substitution increased. The degradation kinetics at 50 %<br>
showed almost identical values compared with the standard.<br>
The Fe yields of the carboxymethylated iron complexes<br>
reached 97 %.<br>

maltodextrin as obtained in Example 1.<br>
The use of C2/C3-oxidised maltodextrin derivatives having a<br>
degree of molar substitution &gt; 0.01 resulted in instable<br>
products.<br>

molecular weights rose as the degree of substitution<br>
increased. The degradation kinetics at 50 % showed almost<br>
identical values compared with the standard. The Fe yields<br>
of the C2/C3-oxidised iron complexes reached 95 %.<br>

6 by addition of hydrochloric acid, and the solution was<br>
maintained at 50°C for a further 3 0 minutes and then heated<br>
to 97-98°C and maintained at that temperature for<br>
